  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I. &mdash; THE OLD DESK</h2>

  <p class="first">Not one of my keys will fit it: the old desk has been laid
  aside for years, and is covered with dust and rust. We do not make such
  strong boxes nowadays, for brass hinges and secret drawers have given place
  to flimsy morocco and russian leather; so we clap a Bramah lock, that Bramah
  himself cannot pick, on a black bag that the veriest bungler can rip open in
  five seconds with a penknife, and entrust our notes, bank and otherwise, our
  valuables, and our secrets, to this faithless repository with a confidence
  that deserves to be respected. But in the days when George the Third was
  king, our substantial ancestors rejoiced in more substantial workmanship: so
  the old desk that I cannot succeed in unlocking, is of shining rosewood,
  clamped with brass, and I shall spoil it sadly with the mallet and the
  chisel.</p>

  <p>What a medley it holds! Thank Heaven I am no speculative philosopher, or I
  might moralise for hours over its contents. First, out flies a withered leaf
  of geranium. It must have been dearly prized once, or it would never have
  been here; maybe it represented the hopes, the wealth, the all-in-all of two
  aching hearts: and they are dust and ashes now. To think that the flower
  should have outlasted them! the symbol less perishable than the faith! Then I
  come to a piece of much-begrimed and yellow paper, carefully folded, and
  indorsed with a date,&mdash;a receipt for an embrocation warranted specific
  in all cases of bruises, sprains, or lumbago; next a gold pencil-case, with a
  head of Socrates for a seal; lastly, much of that substance which is
  generated in all waste places, and which the vulgar call "flue." How it comes
  there puzzles equally the naturalist and the philosopher; but you shall find
  it in empty corners, empty drawers, empty pockets, nay, we believe in its
  existence in the empty heads of our fellow-creatures.</p>

  <p>In my thirst for acquisition, regardless of dusty fingers, I press the
  inner sides of the desk in hopes of discovering secret springs and hoarded
  repositories: so have poor men ere now found thousand-pound notes hid away in
  chinks and crannies, and straightway, giddy with the possession of boundless
  wealth, have gone to the Devil at a pace such as none but the beggar on
  horseback can command; so have old wills been fished out, and frauds
  discovered, and rightful heirs re-established, and society in general
  disgusted, and all concerned made discontented and uncomfortable&mdash;so
  shall I, perhaps&mdash;but the springs work, a false lid flies open, and I do
  discover a packet of letters, written on thin foreign paper, in the free
  straggling characters I remember so well. They are addressed to Sir H.
  Beverley, and the hand that penned them has been cold for years. So will
  yours and mine be some day, perhaps ere the flowers are out again; <i>O beate
  Sexti!</i> will you drink a glass less claret on that account? Buxom Mrs.
  Lalage, shall the dressmaker therefore put unbecoming trimmings in your
  bonnet? The "shining hours" are few, and soon past; make the best of them,
  each in your own way, only try and choose the right way:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">For the day will soon be over, and the minutes are of
  gold,<br>
  And the wicket shuts at sundown, and the shepherd leaves the fold.</p>

  <h3>LETTER I</h3>

  <p>"Those were merry days, my dear Hal, when we used to hear the 'chimes at
  midnight' with poor Brummell and Sir Benjamin;[#] very jolly times they were,
  and I often think, if health and pockets could have stood it, I should like
  to be going the pace amongst you all still. And yet how few of us are left.
  They have dropped off one by one, as they did the night we dyed the white
  rose red at the old place; and you, and I, and stanch old 'Ben,' were the
  only three left that could walk straight. Do you remember the corner of
  King-street, and 'Ben' stripped 'to the buff,' as he called it himself,
  'going-in' right royally at the tall fellow with the red head? I never saw
  such right-and-lefters, I never thought he had so much 'fight' in him; and
  you don't remember, Hal, but I do, how 'the lass with the long locks' bent
  over you when you were floored, like Andromache over a debauched Hector, and
  stanched the claret that was flowing freely from your nostrils, and gave you
  gin in a smelling-bottle, which you sucked down as though it were mother's
  milk, like a young reprobate as you were; nor do you remember, nor do I very
  clearly, how we all got back to 'The Cottage,' and finished with burnt
  curagoa, and a dance on the table by daylight. And now you and I are about
  the only two left, and I am as near ruined as a gentleman can be; and you
  must have lost your pen-feathers, Hal, I should think, though you were a
  goose that always could pick a living off a common, be it never so bare.
  Well, we have had our fun; and after all, I for one have been far happier
  since than I ever was in those roystering days; but of this I cannot bear to
  speak."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[#] The dandy's nickname for the Prince Regent.</p>

  <p>"Nor am I so much to be pitied now. I have got my colours and my
  sketch-book, after all; and there never was such a country as this for a man
  who has half an eye in his head. On these magnificent plains the lights and
  shades are glorious. Glorious, Hal, with a little red jagged in here and
  there towards sunset, and the ghostly maize waving and whispering, and the
  feathery acacias trembling in the lightest air, the russet tinge of the one
  and the fawn-coloured stems of the other melting so softly into the neutral
  tints of the sandy soil. I could paint a picture here that should be
  perfectly true to Nature&mdash;nay, more natural than the old dame
  herself&mdash;and never use but two colours to do it all! I am not going to
  tell you what they are: and this reminds me of my boy, and of a want in his
  organisation that is a sad distress to me. The child has not a notion of
  colour. I was painting out of doors yesterday, and he was standing
  by&mdash;bless him! he never leaves me for an instant&mdash;and I tried to
  explain to him some of the simplest rudiments of the godlike art. 'Vere,'
  said I, 'do you see those red tints on the tops of the far acacias, and the
  golden tinge along the back of that brown ox in the foreground?' 'Yes, papa!'
  was the child's answer, with a bewildered look. 'How should you paint them,
  my boy?' 'Well, papa, I should paint the acacias green, because they
  <i>are</i> green, and'&mdash;here he thought he had made a decided
  hit&mdash;'I should put the red into the ox, for he is almost more red than
  brown.' Dear child! he has not a glimmering of colour; but composition,
  that's his forte; and drawing, drawing, you know, which is the highest form
  of the art. His drawing is extraordinary&mdash;careless, but great breadth
  and freedom; and I am certain he could compose a wonderful picture, from his
  singular sensibility to beauty. Young as he is, I have seen the tears stand
  in his eyes when contemplating a fine view, or a really exquisite 'bit,' such
  as one sees in this climate every day. His raptures at his first glimpse of
  the Danube I shall never forget; and if I can only instil into him the
  principles of colour, you will see Vere will become the first painter of the
  age. The boy learns languages readily enough. He has picked up a good deal of
  Hungarian from his nurse. Such a woman, Hal! magnificent! Such colouring:
  deep brown tones, and masses of the richest grey hair, with superb, solemn,
  sunken eyes, and a throat and forehead tanned and wrinkled into the very
  ideal of a Canidia, or a Witch of Endor, or any fine old sorceress, 'all of
  the olden time.' I have done her in chalks, and in sepia, and in oils. I
  adore her in the former. She is, I fancy, a good, careful woman, and much
  attached to Vere, who promises to be an excellent linguist; but of this I
  cannot see the advantage. There is but one pursuit, in my opinion, for an
  intellectual being who is not obliged to labour in the fields for his daily
  bread, and that is Art. I have wooed the heavenly maid all my life. To me she
  has been sparing of her favours; and yet a single smile from her has gilded
  my path for many a long and weary day. She has beckoned me on and on till I
  feel I could follow her to the end of the world; she shielded me <i>in the
  dark hour</i>; she has brightened my lot ever since; she led me to nature,
  her grand reflection&mdash;for you know my theory, that art is reality, and
  nature but the embodiment of art; she has made me independent of the frowns
  of that other jade, Fortune, and taught me the most difficult lesson of
  all&mdash;to be content. What is wealth? You and I have seen it lavished with
  both hands, and its possessor weary, satiate, languid, and disgusted. What is
  rank? a mark for envy, an idol but for fools. Fame? a few orders on a tight
  uniform; a craving for more and more; even when we know the tastelessness of
  the food, to be still hungry for applause. Love? a sting of joy and a
  heartache for ever. Are they not all vanity of vanities? But your artist is
  your true creator. He can embody the noblest aspirations of his mind, and
  give them a reality and a name. You, Hal, who are the most practical,
  unimaginative, business-like fellow that ever hedged a bet or drove a
  bargain, have had such dreams betwixt sleeping and waking as have given you a
  taste of heaven, and taught you the existence of a fairy-land of which, to
  such as you, is only granted a far-away and occasional glimpse. What would
  you give to be able to embody such blissful visions and call them up at will?
  Let me have a camel's-hair brush, a few dabs of clay, and, behold! I am the
  magician before whose wand these dreams shall reappear tangibly,
  substantially, enduringly: alas! for mortal shortcomings, sometimes a little
  out of drawing, sometimes a little hard and cold; but still, Hal, I can make
  my own world, such as it is, and people it for myself; nor do I envy any man
  on earth, except, perhaps, a sculptor. To have perfected and wrought out in
  the imperishable marble the ideal of one's whole life, to walk round it, and
  smoke one's cigar and say, 'This will last as long as St. Paul's Cathedral or
  the National Debt, and this is mine, I made it'&mdash;must be a sensation of
  delight that even we poor painters, with our works comparatively of a day,
  can hardly imagine; but then, what we lose in durability we gain in
  reproduction: and so once more I repeat, let who will be statesman, warrior,
  stock-jobber, or voluptuary, but give me the pallet and the easel, the
  <i>d&eacute;lire d'un peintre</i>, the line of beauty and the brush!</p>

  <p>"Can you wonder that I should wish my boy to tread the same path? Had I
  but begun at his age, and worked as I <i>should</i> have worked, what might I
  have been now? Could I but make amends to him by leading him up the path to
  real fame, and see Vere the regenerator of modern art, I should die
  happy.</p>

  <p>"And now, Hal, I must ask you of your own pursuits and your own successes.
  I do not often see an English paper; but these are a fine sporting people,
  with a dash of our English tastes and love of horseflesh; and in a small
  pothouse where we put up last week, in the very heart of the Banat, I found a
  print of Flying Childers, and a <i>Bell's Life</i> of the month before last.
  In this I read that your Marigold colt was first favourite for the Derby, and
  I can only say that I hope he will win, as fervently as I should have done
  some years back, when he would have carried a large portion of my money, or
  at least of my credit, on his back. I have also gathered that your shorthorns
  won the prize at the great cattle-show. 'Who drives fat oxen must himself be
  fat.' I trust, therefore, that you are flourishing and thriving; also, that
  Constance, the most stately little lady I ever beheld at two years old, still
  queens it at the Manor-house. I will write again shortly, but must leave off
  now, as my boy is calling me to go out. He grows more like his poor mother
  every day, especially about the eyes.&mdash;Adieu, Hal; ever yours,</p>

  <p>"PHILIP EGERTON."</p>

  <p>LETTER II</p>

  <p>"The longer I linger here the more I become wedded to the land in which,
  after all, I have known the few hours of real happiness I ever spent. Yes,
  Hal, with all its guilt, with all its anxieties, with everything and
  everybody battling against me&mdash;that was my golden year, such as I shall
  never see again. She was so generous, so gentle, and so true; she sacrificed
  all so willingly for me, and never looked back. Such courage, such patience,
  and oh! such beauty; and to lose her after one short year. Well, it is my
  punishment, and I bear it; but if it had to be done again I would do it.
  Surely I was not so much to blame. Had she but lived I would have made her
  such amends. And after all she is mine&mdash;mine in her lonely grave under
  the acacias, and I shall meet her again. If the universe holds her I shall
  meet her again. Wearily the years have dragged on since I lost her, but every
  birthday is a milestone nearer home; and in the meantime I have Vere and my
  art. And we wander about this wild country, and scamper across its boundless
  plains, and I paint and smoke, and try to be happy.</p>

  <p>"We arrived here last night, and I need scarcely tell you that Edeldorf is
  as English as any place out of England can be, and my old friend but little
  altered during the last twenty years. You remember De Rohan at Melton and
  Newmarket, at Rome and at Paris. Wherever he lived he was quite the
  Englishman, and always rode a thoroughbred horse. It would indeed be
  ungrateful on your part to forget him. Need I remind you of the dinner at the
  old Club, and the procession afterwards, with some fourteen wax candles, to
  inspect The Switcher in your stables, at the risk of burning down the greater
  part of the town, and converting some of the best horses in England into an
  exceedingly tough grill. I can see the Count's face of drunken gravity now,
  as he felt carefully down the horse's forelegs, undeterred by the respectful
  stare of your groom, or the undisguised astonishment of the animal itself.
  'Vat is his name?' was the only question he asked of the polite Mr. Topthorn.
  'The Switcher, my lord,' was the reply. 'Ver' nice name,' said the Count, and
  bought him forthwith at a price that you yourself can best appreciate; but
  from that day to this he never could pronounce the animal's appellation; and
  although he rode 'The Svishare' both in England and here, and has got prints
  and pictures of him all over the house, 'The Svishare' he will continue to be
  till the end of time.</p>

  <p>"All this Anglo-mania, however, is not much appreciated in high places;
  and I can see enough without looking much below the surface to satisfy me
  that the Count is eyed jealously by the authorities, and that if ever they
  catch him tripping they will not spare his fortunes or his person. I fear
  there will be a row before long, and I would not trust the wild blood of my
  friends here if once they get the upper hand. Only yesterday an incident
  occurred that gave me a pretty correct idea of the state of feeling in this
  country, and the disaffection of the peasant to his imperial rulers. Vere and
  I were travelling along in our usual manner, occupying the front seat of a
  most dilapidated carriage, which I purchased at Bucharest for twenty ducats,
  with the nurse and the baggage behind. We had stopped for me to sketch an
  animated group, in the shape of a drove of wild horses being drafted and
  chosen by their respective owners, and Vere was clapping his hands and
  shouting with delight at the hurry-skurry of the scene (by the way, there was
  a white horse that I caught in a beautiful attitude, who comes out admirably
  and lights up the whole sketch), when an officer and a couple of Austrian
  dragoons rode into the midst of the busy horse-tamers, and very rudely
  proceeded to subject them to certain inquiries, which seemed to meet with
  sulky and evasive answers enough. After a time the Austrian officer, a
  handsome boy of twenty, stroking an incipient moustache, ordered the oldest
  man of the party to be pinioned; and placing him between his two soldiers,
  began to interrogate him in a most offensive and supercilious manner. The old
  man, who was what we should call in England a better sort of yeoman farmer,
  of course immediately affected utter ignorance of German; and as the young
  Austrian was no great proficient in Hungarian, I was compelled most
  unwillingly to interpret between them, Vere looking on meanwhile with his
  mouth wide open, in a state of intense bewilderment. The following is a
  specimen of the conversation:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"<i>Austrian Sub-Lieutenant</i>, in German&mdash;'Thou hast been hiding
  deserters; and so shalt thou be imprisoned, and fined, and suffer
  punishment.' I have to modify these threats into Hungarian.&mdash;'Brother,
  this noble officer seeks a deserter. Knowest thou of such an one?'</p>

  <p>"<i>Old Man</i>&mdash;'My father, I know nothing.'</p>

  <p>"<i>Austrian Officer</i>, with many expletives, modified as before by your
  humble servant&mdash;'You shall be punished with the utmost rigour if you do
  not give him up.'</p>

  <p>"<i>Old Man</i>, again&mdash;'My father, I know nothing.'</p>

  <p>"<i>Officer</i>, losing all patience, and gesticulating wildly with his
  sword&mdash;'Slave, brute, dog, tell me this instant which way he took, or I
  will have you hanged to that nearest tree, your family shall be imprisoned,
  and your village burnt to the ground.'</p>

  <p>"<i>Old Man</i>, as before&mdash;'My father, I know nothing.'</p>

  <p>"The case was getting hopeless; but the young officer had now thoroughly
  lost his temper, and ordered his men to tie the peasant up, and flog him
  soundly with a stirrup-leather. Here I thought it high time to interpose; I
  saw the wild Hungarian blood beginning to boil in the veins of some dozen
  dark scowling fellows, who had been occupied tending the horses. Eyes were
  flashing at the Austrians, and hands clutching under the sheepskin where the
  long knife lies. Fortunately the officer was a gentleman and an admirer of
  the English. With much difficulty I persuaded him to abandon his cruel
  intention, and to ride on in prosecution of his search; but it was when his
  back was turned that the tide of indignation against himself and his country
  swelled to the highest. The peasants' faces actually became convulsed with
  rage, their voices shook with fury, and threats and maledictions were poured
  on their masters enough to make one's very blood run cold. If ever they do
  get the upper hand, woe to the oppressor! There is nothing on earth so
  fearful as a Jacquerie. God forbid this fair land should ever see one.</p>

  <p>"We journeyed on in a different direction from the dragoons, but we caught
  occasional glimpses of their white coats as they gleamed through the acacias
  that skirted the road; and I was just thinking how well I could put them in
  with a dab or two of chalk against a thunder-storm, or a dark wood in the
  midst of summer, when the bright sun makes the foliage almost black, and
  debating in my own mind whether the officer would not have made a better
  sketch if his horse had been a light grey, when my postilion pulled up with a
  jerk that nearly chucked Vere out of the carriage, and, pointing to something
  in the road, assured 'my Excellency' that the horse was dying, and the rider,
  in all probability, lying killed under his beast. Sure enough, an over-ridden
  horse was prostrate in the middle of the road, and a young man vainly
  endeavouring to raise him by the bridle, and calling him by all the terms of
  endearment and abuse in the Hungarian vocabulary, without the slightest
  effect. Seeing our carriage, he addressed me in German, and with a
  gentlemanlike voice and manner begged to know in what direction I was
  travelling. 'I hope to get to Edeldorf to-night,' was my answer. He started
  at the name. 'Edeldorf!' said he; 'I, too, am bound for Edeldorf; can you
  favour me with a seat in your carriage?' Of course I immediately complied;
  and Vere and I soon had the stranger between us, journeying amicably on
  towards my old friend's chateau. You know my failing, Hal, so I need not tell
  you how it was that I immediately began to study my new acquaintance's
  physiognomy, somewhat, I thought, to his discomfiture, for at first he turned
  his head away, but after a while seemed to think better of it, and entered
  into conversation with much frankness and vivacity. The sun was getting low,
  and I think I could have sketched him very satisfactorily in that warm, soft
  light. His head was essentially that of a soldier; the brow deficient in
  ideality, but with the bold outlines which betoken penetration and
  forethought. Constructiveness fully developed, combativeness moderate, but
  firmness very strongly marked; the eye deep set, and, though small,
  remarkably brilliant; the jaw that of a strong, bold man, while the lines
  about the mouth showed great energy of character and decision. From the
  general conformation of his head I should have placed forethought as the
  distinguishing quality of his character, and I should have painted the rich
  brown tones of his complexion on a system of my own, which such a portrait
  would be admirably calculated to bring out. However, I could not well ask him
  to sit to me upon so short an acquaintance; so, while he and Vere chatted
  on&mdash;for they soon became great friends, and my new acquaintance seemed
  charmed to find a child speaking German so fluently&mdash;I began to
  speculate on the trade and character of this mysterious addition to our
  party. 'Hair cut short, moustache close clipped,' thought I, 'perfect German
  accent, and the broad Viennese dialect of the aristocracy, all this looks
  like a soldier; but the rough frieze coat, and huge shapeless riding boots
  could never belong to an officer of that neatest of armies&mdash;"the
  Imperial and Kingly." Then his muscular figure, and light active gait, which
  I remarked as he sprang into the carriage, would argue him one who was in the
  habit of practising feats of strength and agility. There is no mistaking the
  effects of the gymnasium. Stay, I have it, he is a fencing-master; that
  accounts for the military appearance, the quick glance, the somewhat worn
  look of the countenance, and he is going to Edeldorf, to teach De Rohan's boy
  the polite art of self-defence. So much the better. I, too, love dearly a
  turn with the foils, so I can have a glorious "set-to" with him to-morrow or
  the next day; and then, when we are more intimate, I can paint him. I think I
  shall do him in oils. I wish he would turn his head the least thing further
  this way.' I had got as far as this when my new friend did indeed turn his
  head round, and looking me full in the face, thus addressed me:&mdash;'Sir,
  you are an Englishman, and an honourable man. I have no right to deceive you.
  You incur great danger by being seen with me. I have no right to implicate
  you; set me down, and let me walk.' Vere looked more astonished than ever. I
  begged him to explain himself. 'I tell you,' said he, 'that I am a thief and
  a deserter. My name is posted at every barrack-gate in the empire. I am
  liable to be hanged, if taken. Are you not afraid of me now?' 'No,' exclaimed
  Vere, his colour heightening and his eyes glistening (oh! so like her). 'Papa
  and I will take care of you; don't be afraid.' My boy had anticipated what I
  was going to say; but I assured him that as I had taken him into my carriage
  I considered him as my guest, and come what would I never could think of
  abandoning him till we reached our destination. 'Of course,' I added, 'you
  are then free to come and go as you please. If you have done anything
  disgraceful, we need never know each other again. I do not wish to hear of
  it. You are to me only a belated traveller; permit me to add, a gentleman, to
  whom I am delighted to be of service. Will you smoke? Let me offer you a
  cigar.' The blood rushed to his face as he declined the proffered courtesy;
  for an instant he looked half offended, and then, seizing my hand, he
  exclaimed, 'If you knew all, you would pity me&mdash;nay, more, you would
  approve of what I have done.' He turned suddenly to Vere, and rather startled
  him by abruptly exclaiming, 'Boy, do you love your father? is he all the
  world to you?' 'Yes,' said Vere, colouring up again, 'of course I love papa,
  and Nurse "Nettich" too.' That worthy woman was fast asleep in the rumble.
  'Well,' said the stranger, more composedly, 'I love my father, too; he is all
  I have in the world, and for his sake I would do the same thing again. I will
  tell you all about it, and you shall judge between me and my crime.' But my
  new friend's story I must defer, my dear Hal, to another letter. So for the
  present, <i>Vive valeque</i>."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II. &mdash; THE DESERTER</h2>

  <p class="first">Dim and strange are the recollections that steal over me
  while I read these time-worn letters of one who, with all his faults, was the
  kindest, fondest, and best of enthusiasts. It seems like a dream; I cannot
  fancy that I am the child alluded to. It seems as though all this must have
  happened to some one else, and that I stood by and watched. Yet have I a
  vague and shadowy remembrance of the warm autumnal evening; the road soft and
  thick with dust; the creaking, monotonous motion of the carriage, and my
  waking up from an occasional nap, and finding myself propped by the strong
  arm of a stranger, and nestling my head upon his broad shoulder, whilst my
  father's kind face and eager eyes were turned towards my new acquaintance
  with the earnest comprehensive look I remember so well. My father always
  seemed to take in at a glance, not only the object that attracted his
  attention, but all its accessories, possible as well as actual. I believe he
  never left off painting in his mind. I remember nothing very distinctly; and
  no wonder, for my little brain must have been a strange chaos of shifting
  scenes and unexpected events, foreign manners and home ideas, to say nothing
  of a general confusion of tongues; for I could prattle French, German, and
  Hungarian, with a smattering of Turkish, not to mention my own native
  language; and I used them all indiscriminately. But my father's letters bring
  back much that I had otherwise forgotten, and whilst I read the story of the
  renegade, I can almost fancy I am leaning against his upright soldierlike
  form, and listening to the clear decided tones in which he told his tale.</p>

  <p>LETTER III</p>

  <p>"'I am a soldier, sir,' said my new acquaintance, whilst I leant back in
  the carriage smoking my cigar, and, <i>more meo</i>, Hal, made the most of my
  'study.' 'I am an Austrian soldier&mdash;at least I was a week ago&mdash;I
  would not give much for my chance if ever I come into the clutches of the
  "Double Eagle" again. Shall I tell you why I entered the Imperial army? All
  my life I have thought it best to be on the winning side. If I had been born
  an Englishman, oh, what happiness! I would have asked no better lot than to
  wander about with my dog and my gun, and be free. But a Croat, no, there is
  no liberty in Croatia. We must have masters, forsooth! territorial dues and
  seignorial rights; and we must bow and cringe and be trampled on by our own
  nobility. But these, too, have <i>their</i> masters, and I have seen the lord
  of many thousand acres tremble before a captain of dragoons. So I determined
  that if a military despotism was to be the order of the day, why I, too,
  would make a part of the great engine, perhaps some time I might come to
  wield it all. My father was appointed steward to a great lord in
  Hungary&mdash;perhaps, had he remained, I might never have left home, for I
  am his only child, and we two are alone in the world; besides, is not a son's
  first duty to obey his father?&mdash;but I could not bear to exchange the
  free open air, and my horse, and my gun, and my dogs (I had the best
  greyhounds in Croatia), for a leathern stool and an inkstand, and I said,
  "Father, I too will become an Austrian, and so some day shall I be a great
  man, perhaps a colonel, and then will I return once a year to see you, and
  comfort you in your old age." So I was sworn to obey the Emperor, and soon I
  learnt my exercise, and saw that to rise even in the Austrian army was not
  difficult for one who could see clearly before him, and could count that two
  and two make four, and never five.</p>

  <p>"'Very few men are soldiers at heart, and those who love the profession
  and would fain shine, can only see one way to success, and that must be the
  old-established track that has always been followed. If I wanted to move
  across that stream and had no boats, what should I do? I would try if it be
  too deep to wade. But the regulation says, soldiers shall not wade if the
  water be over a certain depth. So for six inches of water I must be defeated.
  That should not be my way; if it came no higher than their chins my men
  should cross; and if we could keep our muskets dry, where would be the harm?
  Well, I soon rose to be a corporal and a sergeant; and whilst I practised
  fencing and riding and gymnastics, I learnt besides something of gunnery and
  fortification, and the art of supplying an army with food. At last I was made
  lieutenant and paymaster of the regiment, for I could always calculate
  readily, and never shrank from trouble or feared responsibility. So I had
  good pay and good comrades, and was getting on. Meanwhile my poor father was
  distressing himself about my profession, and imagining all sorts of
  misfortunes that would happen to me if I remained a soldier. In his letters
  to me he always hinted at the possibility of some great success&mdash;at his
  hopes of, before long, placing me in an independent position; that I should
  leave the army to come and live with him, and we would farm an estate of our
  own, and never be parted any more. Poor old man! what do you think he built
  on? why, these foolish lotteries. Ticket after ticket did he purchase, and
  ticket after ticket came up a blank. At last, in his infatuation, he raised a
  sum of money&mdash;enough to obtain him all the numbers he had set his heart
  upon&mdash;for he mixed calculation with his gambling, which is certain
  ruin&mdash;and for this purpose he embezzled two thousand florins of his
  employer's property, and wasted it as he had done the rest. In his despair he
  wrote to me. What could I do? two thousand florins were in the pay-chest. I
  have it here in this leathern bag. I have saved my father; he is steward at
  Edeldorf. I shall see him to-night; after that I must fly the country. I will
  go to England, the land of the free. I am ruined, degraded, and my life is
  not worth twelve hours' purchase; but I do not regret it. Look at your boy,
  sir, and tell me if I am not right.' He is a fine fellow this, Hal, depend
  upon it; and though my own feelings as a gentleman were a little shocked at a
  man talking thus coolly of robbery in anything but the legitimate way on the
  turf, I could scarcely remonstrate with him now the thing was done; so I
  shook him by the hand, and promised him at any rate a safe convoy to
  Edeldorf, which we were now rapidly approaching. You like a fine place, Hal;
  you always did. I remember when you used to vow that if ever Fortune smiled
  upon you&mdash;and faith, it is not for want of wooing that you have missed
  the goddess's favours&mdash;how you would build and castellate and improve
  Beverley Manor, till, in my opinion as an artist and a man of associations,
  you would spoil it completely; but I think even your fastidious taste would
  be delighted with Edeldorf. The sun was just down as we drove into the park,
  and returned the salute of the smart Hussar mounting guard at the lodge; and
  the winding road, and smooth sward dotted with thorns, and those eternal
  acacias, reminded one of a gentleman's place in Old England, till we rounded
  the corner of a beautifully-dressed flower-garden, and came in view of the
  castle itself, with all its angles and turrets and embrasures, and mullioned
  windows, and picturesque ins-and-outs; the whole standing boldly out in a
  chiaro-oscuro against the evening sky, fast beginning to soften into
  twilight. Old De Rohan was on the steps to welcome me, his figure upright and
  noble as ever; his countenance as pleasing; but the beard and moustache that
  you and I remember so dark and glossy, now as white as snow; yet he is a very
  handsome fellow still. In mail or plate, leaning his arm on his helmet, with
  his beard flowing over a steel cuirass inlaid with gold, he would make a
  capital seneschal, or marshal of a tournament, or other elderly dignitary of
  the middle ages; but I should like best to paint him in dark velvet, with a
  skull-cap, as Lord Soulis, or some other noble votary of the magic art; and
  to bring him out in a dusky room, with one ray of vivid light from a lamp
  just over his temples, and gleaming off that fine, bold, shining forehead,
  from which the hair is now completely worn away."</p>

  <p>There are no more of the old dusty letters. Why these should have been
  tied up and preserved for so many years is more than I can tell. They have,
  however, reminded me of much in my youth that I had well-nigh forgotten. I
  must try back on my vague memories for the commencement of my narrative.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III. &mdash; "PAR NOBILE"</h2>

  <p class="first">"You shall play with my toys, and break them if you like,
  for my papa loves the English, and you are my English friend," said a
  handsome blue-eyed child to his little companion, as they sauntered
  hand-in-hand through the spacious entrance-hall at Edeldorf. The boy was
  evidently bent on patronising his friend. The friend was somewhat abashed and
  bewildered, and grateful to be taken notice of.</p>

  <p>"What is your name?&mdash;may I call you by your Christian name?" said the
  lesser child, timidly, and rather nestling to his protector, for such had the
  bigger boy constituted himself.</p>

  <p>"My name is Victor," was the proud reply, "and <i>you</i> may call me
  Victor, because I love you; but the servants must call me Count, because my
  papa is a count; and I am not an Austrian count, but a Hungarian. Come and
  see my sword." So the two children were soon busy in an examination of that
  very beautiful, but not very destructive plaything.</p>

  <p>They were indeed a strange contrast. Victor de Rohan, son and heir to one
  of the noblest and wealthiest of Hungary's aristocracy, looked all over the
  high-bred child he was. Free and bold, his large, frank blue eyes, and wide
  brow, shaded with clustering curls of golden brown, betokened a gallant,
  thoughtless spirit, and a kind, warm heart; whilst the delicate nostril and
  handsomely-curved mouth of the well-born child betrayed, perhaps, a little
  too much pride for one so young, and argued a disposition not too patient of
  contradiction or restraint. His little companion was as unlike him as
  possible, and indeed most people would have taken Victor for the English boy,
  and Vere for the foreign one. The latter was heavy, awkward, and ungainly in
  his movements, timid and hesitating in his manner, with a sallow complexion,
  and dark, deep-set eyes, that seemed always looking into a world beyond. He
  was a strange child, totally without the light-heartedness of his age, timid,
  shy, and awkward, but capable of strong attachments, and willing to endure
  anything for the sake of those he loved. Then he had quaint fancies, and
  curious modes of expressing them, which made other children laugh at him,
  when the boy would retire into himself, deeply wounded and unhappy, but too
  proud to show it. As he looks now at Victor's sword, with which the latter is
  vapouring about the hall, destroying imaginary enemies, Vere asks&mdash;</p>

  <p>"What becomes of the people that are killed, Victor?"</p>

  <p>"We ride over their bodies," says Victor, who has just delivered a
  finishing thrust at his phantom foe.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but what <i>becomes</i> of them?" pursues the child, now answering
  himself. "I think they come to me in my dreams; for sometimes, do you know, I
  dream of men in armour charging on white horses, and they come by with a wind
  that wakes me; and when I ask 'Nettich' who they are, she says they are the
  fairies; but I don't think they are fairies, because you know fairies are
  quite small, and have wings. No, I think they must be the people that are
  killed."</p>

  <p>"Very likely," replies Victor, who has not considered the subject in this
  light, and whose dreams are mostly of ponies and plum-cake&mdash;"very
  likely; but come to papa, and he will give us some grapes." So off they go,
  arm-in-arm, to the great banqueting-hall; and Vere postpones his
  dream-theories to some future occasion, for there is a charm about grapes
  that speaks at once to a child's heart.</p>

  <p>So the two boys make their entrance into the banqueting-hall, where De
  Rohan sits in state, surrounded by his guests. On his right is placed Philip
  Egerton, whose dark eye gleams with pleasure as he looks upon his son. Who
  but a father would take delight in such a plain, unattractive child? Vere
  glides quietly to his side, shrinking from the strange faces and gorgeous
  uniforms around; but Victor walks boldly up to the old Count, and demands his
  daily glass of Tokay, not as a favour, but a right.</p>

  <p>"I drink to Hungary!" says the child, looking full into the face of his
  next neighbour, a prince allied to the Imperial family, and a General of
  Austrian cavalry. "Monsieur le Prince, your good health! Come, clink your
  glass with me."</p>

  <p>"Your boy is a true De Rohan," says the good-natured Austrian, as he
  accepts the urchin's challenge, and their goblets ring against each other.
  "Will you be a soldier, my lad, and wear the white uniform?"</p>

  <p>"I will be a soldier," answers the child, "but not an Austrian soldier
  like you: Austrian soldiers are not so brave as Hungarians."</p>

  <p>"Well said, my little patriot," replies the amused General. "So you do not
  think our people are good for much? Why, with that sword of yours, I should
  be very sorry to face you with my whole division. What a Light Dragoon the
  rogue will make, De Rohan! see, he has plundered the grapes already." And the
  jolly prince sat back in his chair, and poured himself out another glass of
  "Imperial Tokay."</p>

  <p>"Hush, Victor!" said his father, laughing, in spite of himself, at his
  child's forwardness. "Look at your little English friend; he stands quiet
  there, and says nothing. I shall make an Englishman of my boy, Egerton; he
  shall go to an English school, and learn to ride and box, and to be a man. I
  love England and the English. Egerton, your good health! I wish my boy to be
  like yours. <i>Sapperment!</i> he is quiet, but I will answer for it he fears
  neither man nor devil."</p>

  <p>My father's face lighted up with pleasure as he pressed me to his side.
  Kind father! I believe he thought his ugly, timid, shrinking child was the
  admiration of all.</p>

  <p>"I think the boy has courage," he said, "but for that I give him little
  credit. All men are naturally brave; it is but education that makes us
  reflect; hence we learn to fear consequences, and so become cowards."</p>

  <p>"Pardon, <i>mon cher</i>," observed the Austrian General, with a laugh.
  "Now, my opinion is that all men are naturally cowards, and that we alone
  deserve credit who overcome that propensity, and so distinguish ourselves for
  what we choose to call bravery, but which we ought rather to term
  self-command. What say you, De Rohan? You have been in action, and 'on the
  ground,' too, more than once. Were you not cursedly afraid?"</p>

  <p>De Rohan smiled good-humouredly, and filled his glass.</p>

  <p>"Shall I tell you my opinion of courage?" said he, holding up the
  sparkling fluid to the light. "I think of courage what our Hungarian Hussars
  think of a breast-plate. 'Of what use,' say they, 'is cuirass and back-piece
  and all that weight of defensive armour? Give us a pint of wine in our
  stomachs, and we are <i>breastplate all over</i>.' Come, Wallenstein, put
  your breastplate on&mdash;it is very light, and fits very easily."</p>

  <p>The General filled again, but returned to the charge.</p>

  <p>"You remind me," said he, "of a conversation I overheard when I was a
  lieutenant in the first regiment of Uhlans. We were drawn up on the crest of
  a hill opposite a battery in position not half-a-mile from us. If they had
  retired us two hundred yards, we should have been under cover; but we never
  got the order, and there we stood. Whish! the round-shot came over our heads
  and under our feet, and into our ranks, and we lost two men and five horses
  before we knew where we were. The soldiers grumbled sadly, and a few seemed
  inclined to turn rein and go to the rear. Mind you, it is not fair to ask
  cavalry to sit still and be pounded for amusement; but the officers being
  <i>cowards by education</i>, Mr. Egerton, did their duty well, and kept the
  men together. I was watching my troop anxiously enough, and I heard one man
  say to his comrade, 'Look at Johann, Fritz! what a bold one he is; he thinks
  nothing of the fire; see, he tickles the horse of his front-rank man even
  now, to make him kick.'"</p>

  <p>"Exactly my argument," interrupted my father; "he was an uneducated man,
  consequently saw nothing to be afraid of. Bravery, after all, is only
  insensibility to danger."</p>

  <p>"Fritz did not think so," replied Wallenstein. "Hear his
  answer&mdash;'Johann is a blockhead,' he replied, 'he has never been under
  fire before, and does not know his danger; but you and I, old comrade, we
  deserve to be made corporals; for we sit quiet here on our horses, <i>though
  we are most cursedly afraid</i>.'"</p>

  <p>The guests all laughed; and the discussion would have terminated, but that
  De Rohan, who had drunk more wine than was his custom, and who was very proud
  of his boy, could not refrain from once more turning the conversation to
  Victor's merits, and to that personal courage by which, however much he might
  affect to make light of it in society, he set such store.</p>

  <p>"Well, Wallenstein," said he; "you hold that Nature makes us cowards; if
  so, my boy here ought to show something of the white feather. Come hither,
  Victor. Are you afraid of being in the dark?"</p>

  <p>"No, papa!" answered Victor, boldly; but added, after a moment's
  consideration, "except in the Ghost's Gallery. I don't go through the Ghost's
  Gallery after six o'clock."</p>

  <p>This <i>na ve</i> confession excited much amusement amongst the guests;
  but De Rohan's confidence in his boy's courage was not to be so shaken.</p>

  <p>"What shall I give you," said he, "to go and fetch me the old Breviary
  that lies on the table at the far end of the Ghost's Gallery?"</p>

  <p>Victor looked at me, and I at him. My breath came quicker and quicker. The
  child coloured painfully, but did not answer. I felt his terrors myself. I
  looked upon the proposed expedition as a soldier might on a forlorn hope; but
  something within kept stirring me to speak; it was a mingled feeling of
  emulation, pity, and friendship, tinged with that inexplicable charm that
  coming danger has always possessed for me&mdash;a charm that the
  constitutionally brave are incapable of feeling. I mastered my shyness with
  an effort, and, shaking all over, said to the master of the house, in a
  thick, low voice&mdash;</p>

  <p>"If you please, Monsieur le Comte, if Victor goes, I will go too."</p>

  <p>"Well said, little man!" "Bravo, boy!" "Vere, you're a trump!" in plain
  English from my father; and "In Heaven's name, give the lads a breastplate
  apiece, in the shape of a glass of Tokay!" from the jolly General, were the
  acclamations that greeted my resolution; and for one delicious moment I felt
  like a little hero. Victor, too, caught the enthusiasm; and, ashamed of
  showing less courage than his playfellow, expressed his readiness to
  accompany me,&mdash;first stipulating, however, with praise-worthy caution,
  that he should take his sword for our joint preservation; and also that two
  large bunches of grapes should be placed at our disposal on our safe return,
  "if," as Victor touchingly remarked, "we ever came back at all!" My father
  opened the door for us with a low bow, and it closed upon a burst of
  laughter, which to us, bound, as we fancied, on an expedition of unparalleled
  danger, sounded to the last degree unfeeling.</p>

  <p>Hand-in-hand we two children walked through the ante-room, and across the
  hall; nor was it until we reached the first landing on the wide, gloomy oak
  staircase, that we paused to consider our future plans, and to scan the
  desperate nature of our enterprise. There were but two more flights of steps,
  a green-baize door to go through, a few yards of passage to traverse, and
  then, Victor assured me, in trembling accents, we should be in the Ghost's
  Gallery. My heart beat painfully, and my informant began to cry.</p>

  <p>We laid our plans, however, with considerable caution, and made a solemn
  compact of alliance, offensive and defensive, that no power, natural or
  supernatural, was to shake. We were on no account whatsoever to leave go of
  each other's hands. Thus linked, and Victor having his sword drawn,&mdash;for
  the furtherance of which warlike attitude I was to keep carefully on his
  left,&mdash;we resolved to advance, if possible, talking the whole way up to
  the fatal table whereon lay the Breviary, and then snatching it up hastily,
  to return backwards, so as to present our front to the foe till we reached
  the green-baize door, at which point <i>sauve qui peut</i> was to be the
  order; and we were to rush back into the dining-room as fast as our legs
  could carry us. But in the event of our progress being interrupted by the
  ghost (who appeared, as Victor informed me, in the shape of a huge black dog
  with green eyes,&mdash;a description at which my blood ran cold,&mdash;and
  which he added had been seen once by his governess and twice by an old
  drunken Hussar who waited on him, and answered to the name of "Hans"), we
  were to lie down on our faces, so as to hide our eyes from the ghostly
  vision, and scream till we alarmed the house; but on no account, we repeated
  in the most binding and solemn manner&mdash;on no account were we to let go
  of each other's hands. This compact made and provided, we advanced towards
  the gallery, Victor feeling the edge and point of his weapon with an
  appearance of confidence that my own beating heart told me must be put on for
  the occasion, and would vanish at the first appearance of danger.</p>

  <p>And now the green door is passed and we are in the gallery; a faint light
  through the stained windows only serves to show its extent and general gloom,
  whilst its corners and abutments are black as a wolfs mouth. Not a servant in
  the castle would willingly traverse this gallery after dark, and we two
  children feel that we are at last alone, and cut off from all hopes of
  assistance or rescue. But the Breviary lies on the table at the far end, and,
  dreading the very sound of our own footsteps, we steal quietly on. All at
  once Victor stops short.</p>

  <p>"What is that?" says he, in trembling accents.</p>

  <p>The question alone takes away my breath, and I feel the drops break out on
  my lips and forehead. We stop simultaneously and listen. Encouraged by the
  silence, we creep on, and for an instant I experience that vague tumultuous
  feeling of excitement which is almost akin to pleasure. But hark!&mdash;a
  heavy breath!!&mdash;a groan!!! My hair stands on end, and Victor's hand
  clasps mine like a vice. I dare scarce turn my head towards the
  sound,&mdash;it comes from that far corner. There it is! A dark object in the
  deepest gloom of that recess seems crouching for a spring. "The
  ghost!&mdash;the ghost!!" I exclaim, losing all power of self-command in an
  agony of fear. "The dog!&mdash;the dog!!" shrieks Victor; and away we scour
  hard as our legs can carry us, forgetful of our solemn agreements and high
  resolves, forgetful of all but that safety lies before, and terror of the
  ghastliest description behind; away we scour, Victor leaving his sword where
  he dropped it at the first alarm, through the green door, down the oak
  staircase, across the hall, nor stop till we reach the banqueting-room, with
  its reassuring faces and its lights, cheering beyond measure by contrast with
  the gloom from which we have escaped.</p>

  <p>What shouts of laughter met us as we approached the table. "Well, Victor,
  where's the Breviary?" said the Count. "What! my boy, was Nature too strong
  for you in the dark, with nobody looking on?" asked the General. "See! he has
  lost his sword," laughed another. "And the little Englander,&mdash;he, too,
  was panic-struck," remarked the fourth. I shrank from them all and took
  refuge at my father's side. "Vere, I am ashamed of you," was all he said; but
  the words sank deep into my heart, and I bowed my head with a feeling of
  burning shame, that I had disgraced myself in my father's eyes for ever. We
  were sent to bed, and I shared Victor's nursery, under the joint charge of
  Nettich and his own attendant; but, do what I would, I could not sleep. There
  was a stain upon my character in the eyes of the one I loved best on earth,
  and I could not bear it. Though so quiet and undemonstrative, I was a child
  of strong attachments. I perfectly idolised my father, and now he was ashamed
  of me;&mdash;the words seemed to burn in my little heart. I tossed and
  tumbled and fretted myself into a fever, aggravated by the sounding snores of
  Nettich and the other nurse, who slept as only nurses can.</p>

  <p>At last I could bear it no longer. I sat up in bed and peered stealthily
  round. All were hushed in sleep. I determined to do or die. Yes, I would go
  to the gallery; I would fetch the Breviary and lay it on my father's table
  before he awoke. If I succeeded, I should recover his good opinion; if I
  encountered the phantom dog, why, he could but kill me, after all. I would
  wake Victor, and we would go together;&mdash;or, no,&mdash;I would take the
  whole peril, and have all the glory of the exploit, myself. I thought it over
  every way. At last my mind was made up; my naked feet were on the floor; I
  stole from the nursery; I threaded the dark passages; I reached the gallery;
  a dim light was shining at the far end, and I could hear earnest voices
  conversing in a low, guarded tone. Half-frightened and altogether confused, I
  stopped and listened.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV. &mdash; FATHER AND SON</h2>

  <p class="first">The Count's old steward has seen all go to rest in the
  castle; the lords have left the banqueting-room, and the servants, who have
  been making merry in the hall, are long ere this sound asleep. It is the
  steward's custom to see all safe before he lights his lamp and retires to
  rest; but to-night he shades it carefully with a wrinkled hand that trembles
  strangely, and his white face peers into the darkness, as though he were
  about some deed of shame. He steals into the Ghost's Gallery, and creeps
  silently to the farther end. There is a dark object muffled in a cloak in the
  gloomiest corner, and the light from the steward's lamp reveals a fine young
  man, sleeping with that thorough abandonment which is only observable in
  those who are completely outwearied and overdone. It is some minutes ere the
  old man can wake him.</p>

  <p>"My boy!" says he; "my boy, it is time for us to part. Hard, hard is it to
  be robbed of my son&mdash;robbed&mdash;" and the old man checks himself as
  though the word recalled some painful associations.</p>

  <p>"Ay, father," was the reply, "you know our old Croatian proverb, 'He who
  steals is but a borrower.' Nevertheless, I do not wish the Austrians to
  'borrow' me, in case I should never be returned; and it is unmannerly for the
  lieutenant to occupy the same quarters as the general. I must be off before
  dawn; but surely it cannot be midnight yet."</p>

  <p>"In less than an hour the day will break, my son. I have concealed you
  here because not a servant of the household dare set foot in the Ghost's
  Gallery till daylight, and you are safe; but twenty-four more hours must see
  you on the Danube, and you must come here no more. Oh, my boy! my
  boy!&mdash;lost to save me!&mdash;dishonoured that I might not be
  disgraced!&mdash;my boy! my boy!"&mdash;and the old man burst into a passion
  of weeping that seemed to convulse his very frame with agony.</p>

  <p>The son had more energy and self-command; his voice did not even shake as
  he soothed and quieted the old man with a protecting fondness like that of a
  parent for a child. "My father," said he, "there is no dishonour where there
  is no guilt. My first duty is to you, and were it to do again, I would do it.
  What? it was but a momentary qualm and a snatch at the box; and <i>now</i>you
  are safe. Father, I shall come back some day, and offer you a home. Fear not
  for me. I have it <i>here</i> in my breast, the stuff of which men make
  fortunes. I can rely upon myself. I can obey orders; and, father, when others
  are bewildered and confused, I can <i>command</i>. I feel it; I know it. Let
  me but get clear of the 'Eagle's' talons, and fear not for me, dear father, I
  shall see you again, and we will be prosperous and happy yet. But, how to get
  away?&mdash;have you thought of a plan? Can I get a good horse here? Does the
  Count know I am in trouble, and will he help me? Tell me all, father, and I
  shall see my own way, I will answer for it."</p>

  <p>"My gallant boy!" said the steward, despite of himself moved to admiration
  by the self-reliant bearing of his son; "there is but one chance; for the
  Count could not but hand you over to Wallenstein if he knew you were in the
  castle, and then it would be a pleasant jest, and the nearest tree. The
  General is a jovial comrade and a good-humoured acquaintance; but, as a
  matter of duty, he would hang his own son and go to dinner afterwards with an
  appetite none the worse. No, no. 'Trust to an Austrian's mercy and confess
  yourself!' I have a better plan than that. The Zingynies are in the village;
  they held their merrymaking here yesterday. I saw their Queen last night
  after you arrived. I have arranged it all with her. A gipsy's dress, a dyed
  skin, and the middle of the troop; not an Austrian soldier in Hungary that
  will detect you then. Banishment is better than death. Oh, my boy! my boy!"
  and once more the old man gave way and wept.</p>

  <p>"Forward, then, father!" said the young man, whom I now recognised as my
  travelling acquaintance; "there is no time to lose now. How can we get out of
  the castle without alarming the household? I leave all to you now; it will be
  my turn some day." And as he spoke he rose from the steps on which he had
  been lying when his recumbent form had so alarmed Victor and myself, and
  accompanied his father down a winding staircase that seemed let into the
  massive wall of the old building. My curiosity was fearfully excited. I would
  have given all my playthings to follow them. I crept stealthily on, naked
  feet and all; but I was not close enough behind, and the door shut quietly
  with a spring just as my hand was upon it, leaving me alone in the Ghost's
  Gallery. I was not the least frightened now. I forgot all about ghosts and
  Breviaries, and stole back to my nursery and my bed, my little head
  completely filled with a medley of stewards and soldiers and gipsies, and
  Austrian generals and military executions, and phantom dogs and secret
  staircases, and all the most unlikely incidents that crowd together in that
  busy organ&mdash;a child's brain.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V. &mdash; THE ZINGYNIES</h2>

  <p class="first">The morning sun smiles upon a motley troop journeying
  towards the Danube. Two or three lithe, supple urchins, bounding and dancing
  along with half-naked bodies, and bright black eyes shining through knotted
  elf-locks, form the advanced guard. Half-a-dozen donkeys seem to carry the
  whole property of the tribe. The main body consists of sinewy, active-looking
  men, and strikingly handsome girls, all walking with the free, graceful air
  and elastic gait peculiar to those whose lives are passed entirely in active
  exercise, under no roof but that of heaven. Dark-browed women in the very
  meridian of beauty bring up the rear, dragging or carrying a race of swarthy
  progeny, all alike distinguished for the sparkling eyes and raven hair,
  which, with a cunning nothing can overreach, and a nature nothing can tame,
  seem to be the peculiar inheritance of the gipsy. Their costume is striking,
  not to say grotesque. Some of the girls, and all the matrons, bind their
  brows with various coloured handkerchiefs, which form a very picturesque and
  not unbecoming head-gear; whilst in a few instances coins even of gold are
  strung amongst the jetty locks of the Zingynie beauties. The men are not so
  particular in their attire. One sinewy fellow wears only a goatskin shirt and
  a string of beads round his neck, but the generality are clad in the coarse
  cloth of the country, much tattered, and bearing evident symptoms of weather
  and wear. The little mischievous urchins who are clinging round their
  mothers' necks, or dragging back from their mothers' hands, and holding on to
  their mothers' skirts, are almost naked. Small heads and hands and feet, all
  the marks of what we are accustomed to term high birth, are hereditary among
  the gipsies; and we doubt if the Queen of the South herself was a more
  queenly-looking personage than the dame now marching in the midst of the
  throng, and conversing earnestly with her companion, a resolute-looking man
  scarce entering upon the prime of life, with a gipsy complexion, but a
  bearing in which it is not difficult to recognise the soldier. He is talking
  to his protectress&mdash;for such she is&mdash;with a military frankness and
  vivacity, which even to that royal personage, accustomed though she be to
  exact all the respect due to her rank, appear by no means displeasing. The
  lady is verging on the autumn of her charms (their summer must have been
  scorching indeed!) and though a masculine beauty, is a beauty nevertheless.
  Black-browed is she, and deep-coloured, with eyes of fire, and locks of jet,
  even now untinged with grey. Straight and regular are her features, and the
  wide mouth, with its strong, even dazzling teeth, betokens an energy and
  force of will which would do credit to the other sex. She has the face of a
  woman that would dare much, labour much, everything but <i>love</i> much. She
  ought to be a queen, and she is one, none the less despotic for ruling over a
  tribe of gipsies instead of a civilised community.</p>

  <p>"None dispute my word here," says she, "and my word is pledged to bring
  you to the Danube. Let me see a soldier of them all lay a hand upon you, and
  you shall see the gipsy brood show their teeth. A long knife is no bad weapon
  at close quarters. When you have got to the top of the wheel you will
  remember me!"</p>

  <p>The soldier laughed, and lightly replied, "Yours are the sort of eyes one
  does not easily forget, mother. I wish I were a prince of the blood in your
  nation. As I am situated now I can only be dazzled by so much beauty, and go
  my ways."</p>

  <p>The woman checked him sternly, almost savagely, though a few minutes
  before she had been listening, half amused, to his gay and not very
  respectful conversation.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" she said, "trifler. Once more I say, when the wheel has turned,
  remember me. Give me your hand; I can read it plainer so."</p>

  <p>"What, mother?" laughed out her companion. "Every gipsy can tell fortunes;
  mine has been told many a time, but it never came true."</p>

  <p>She was studying the lines on his palm with earnest attention. She raised
  her dark eyes angrily to his face.</p>

  <p>"Blind! blind!" she answered, in a low, eager tone. "The best of you
  cannot see a yard upon your way. Look at that white road, winding and winding
  many a mile before us upon the plain. Because it is flat and soft and smooth
  as far as we can see, will there be no hills on our journey, no rocks to cut
  our feet&mdash;no thorns to tear our limbs? Can you see the Danube rolling on
  far, far before us? Can you see the river you will have to cross some day, or
  can you tell me where it leads? I have the map of our journey here in my
  brain; I have the map of your career here on your hand. Once more I say, when
  the chiefs are in council, and the hosts are melting like snow before the
  sun, and the earth quakes, and the heavens are filled with thunder, and the
  shower that falls scorches and crushes and blasts&mdash;remember me! I follow
  the line of wealth: Man of gold! spoil on; here a horse, there a diamond;
  hundreds to uphold the right, thousands to spare the wrong; both hands full,
  and broad lands near a city of palaces, and a king's favour, and a nation of
  slaves beneath thy foot. I follow the line of pleasure: Costly amber; rich
  embroidery; dark eyes melting for the Croat; glances unveiled for the shaven
  head, many and loving and beautiful; a garland of roses, all for
  one&mdash;rose by rose plucked and withered and thrown away; one tender bud
  remaining; cherish it till it blows, and wear it till it dies. I follow the
  line of blood: it leads towards the rising sun&mdash;charging squadrons with
  lances in rest, and a wild shout in a strange tongue; and the dead wrapped in
  grey, with charm and amulet that were powerless to save; and hosts of many
  nations gathered by the sea&mdash;pestilence, famine, despair, and victory.
  Rising on the whirlwind, chief among chiefs, the honoured of leaders, the
  counsellor of princes&mdash;remember me! But ha! the line is crossed. Beware!
  trust not the sons of the adopted land; when the lily is on thy breast,
  beware of the dusky shadow on the wall; beware and remember me!"</p>

  <p>The gipsy stopped, and clung to him exhausted. For a few paces she was
  unable to support herself; the prophetic mood past, there was a reaction, and
  all her powers seemed to fail her at once; but her companion walked on in
  silence. The eagerness of the Pythoness had impressed even his strong,
  practical nature, and he seemed himself to look into futurity as he muttered,
  "If man can win it, I will."</p>

  <p>The gipsies travelled but slowly; and although the sun was already high,
  they had not yet placed many miles between the fugitive and the castle. This,
  however, was of no great importance. His disguise was so complete, that few
  would have recognised in the tattered, swarthy vagrant, the smart,
  soldier-like traveller who had arrived the previous evening at Edeldorf. From
  the conversation I had overheard in the Ghost's Gallery, I was alone in the
  secret, which, strange to say, I forbore to confide even to my friend Victor.
  But I could not forget the steward and his son; it was my first glimpse into
  the romance of real life, and I could not help feeling a painful interest in
  his fortunes, and an eager desire to see him at least safe off with his
  motley company. I was rejoiced, therefore, at Victor's early proposal, made
  the very instant we had swallowed our breakfasts, that we should take a ride;
  and notwithstanding my misgivings about a strange pony, for I was always
  timid on horseback, I willingly accepted his offer of a mount, and jumped
  into the saddle almost as readily as my little companion, a true Hungarian,
  with whom,</p>

  <p class="verse">Like Mad Tom, the chiefest care<br>
  Was horse to ride and weapon wear.</p>

  <p>Of course, Victor had a complete establishment of ponies belonging to
  himself; and equally of course, he had detailed to me at great length their
  several merits and peculiarities, with an authentic biography of his
  favourite&mdash;a stiff little chestnut, rejoicing in the name of
  "Gold-kind," which, signifying as it does "the golden-child," or darling, he
  seemed to think an exceedingly happy allusion to the chestnut skin and
  endearing qualities of his treasure.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, my pony was very quiet; and although, when mounted, my
  playfellow went off at score, we were soon some miles from Edeldorf, without
  any event occurring to upset my own equilibrium or the sobriety of my steed.
  Equally fortunately, we took the road by which the gipsies had travelled. Ere
  long, we overtook the cavalcade as it wound slowly along the plain. Heads
  were bared to Victor, and blessings called down upon the family of De Rohan;
  for the old Count was at all times a friend to the friendless, and a refuge
  to the poor.</p>

  <p>"Good luck to you, young Count! shall I tell your fortune?" said one.</p>

  <p>"Little, honourable cavalier, give me your hand, and cross it with a
  'zwantziger,'" said another.</p>

  <p>"Be silent, children, and let me speak to the young De Rohan," said the
  gipsy queen; and she laid her hand upon his bridle, and fairly brought
  Gold-kind to a halt.</p>

  <p>Victor looked half afraid, although he began to laugh.</p>

  <p>"Let me go," said he, tugging vigorously at his reins; "papa desired me
  not to have my fortune told."</p>

  <p>"Not by a common Zingynie," urged the queen, archly; "but I am the mother
  of all these. My pretty boy, I was at your christening, and have held you in
  my arms many a time. Let me tell your happy fortune."</p>

  <p>Victor began to relent. "If Vere will have his told first, I will," said
  he, turning half bashfully, half eagerly to me.</p>

  <p>I proffered my hand readily to the gipsy, and crossed it with one of the
  two pieces of silver which constituted the whole of my worldly wealth. The
  gipsy laughed, and began to prophesy in German. There are some events a child
  never forgets; and I remember every word she said as well as if it had been
  spoken yesterday.</p>

  <p>"Over the sea, and again over the sea; thou shalt know grief and hardship
  and losses, and the dove shall be driven from its nest. And the dove's heart
  shall become like the eagle's, that flies alone, and fleshes her beak in the
  slain. Beat on, though the poor wings be bruised by the tempest, and the
  breast be sore, and the heart sink; beat on against the wind, and seek no
  shelter till thou find thy resting-place at last. The time will
  come&mdash;only beat on."</p>

  <p>The woman laughed as she spoke; but there was a kindly tone in her voice
  and a pitying look in her bright eyes that went straight to my heart. Many a
  time since, in life, when the storm has indeed been boisterous and the wings
  so weary, have I thought of those words of encouragement, "The time will
  come&mdash;beat on."</p>

  <p>It was now Victor's turn, and he crossed his palm with a golden ducat ere
  he presented it to the sibyl. This was of itself sufficient to insure him a
  magnificent future; and as the queen perused the lines on his soft little
  hand, with its pink fingers, she indulged in anticipations of magnificence
  proportioned to the handsome donation of the child.</p>

  <p>"Thou shalt be a 'De Rohan,' my darling, and I can promise thee no
  brighter lot,&mdash;broad acres, and blessings from the poor, and horses, and
  wealth, and honours. And the sword shall spare thee, and the battle turn
  aside to let thee pass. And thou shalt wed a fair bride with dark eyes and a
  queenly brow; but beware of St. Hubert's Day. Birth and burial, birth and
  burial&mdash;beware of St. Hubert's Day."</p>

  <p>"But I want to be a soldier," exclaimed Victor, who seemed much
  disappointed at the future which was prognosticated for him; "the De Rohans
  were always soldiers. Mother, can't you make out I shall be a soldier?" still
  holding the little hand open.</p>

  <p>"Farewell, my children," was the only answer vouchsafed by the prophetess.
  "I can only read, I cannot write: farewell." And setting the troop in order,
  she motioned to them to continue their march without further delay.</p>

  <p>I took advantage of the movement to press near my acquaintance of the day
  before, whom I had not failed to recognise in his gipsy garb. Poor fellow, my
  childish heart bled for him, and, in a happy moment, I bethought me of my
  remaining bit of silver. I stooped from my pony and kissed his forehead,
  while I squeezed the coin into his hand without a word. The tears came into
  the deserter's eyes. "God bless you, little man! I shall never forget you,"
  was all he said; but I observed that he bit the coin with his large, strong
  teeth till it was nearly double, and then placed it carefully in his bosom.
  We turned our ponies, and were soon out of sight; but I never breathed a
  syllable to Victor about the fugitive, or the steward, or the Ghost's
  Gallery, for two whole days. Human nature could keep the secret no
  longer.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI. &mdash; SCHOOL</h2>

  <p class="first">In one of the pleasantest valleys of sweet Somersetshire
  stands a large red-brick house that bears unmistakably impressed on its
  exterior the title "School." You would not take it for a "hall," or an
  hospital, or an almshouse, or anything in the world but an institution for
  the rising generation, in which the ways of the wide world are so
  successfully imitated that, in the qualities of foresight, cunning,
  duplicity, and general selfishness, the boy may indeed be said to be "father
  to the man." The house stands on a slope towards the south, with a trim lawn
  and carefully-kept gravel drive, leading to a front door, of which the steps
  are always clean and the handles always bright. How a ring at that door-bell
  used to bring all our hearts into our mouths. Forty boys were we, sitting
  grudgingly over our lessons on the bright summer forenoons, and not one of us
  but thought that ring might possibly announce a "something" for him from
  "home." Home! what was there in the word, that it should call up such visions
  of happiness, that it should create such a longing, sickening desire to have
  the wings of a dove and flee away, that it should make the present such a
  blank and comfortless reality? Why do we persist in sending our children so
  early to school? A little boy, with all his affections developing themselves,
  loving and playful and happy, not ashamed to be fond of his sisters, and
  thinking mamma all that is beautiful and graceful and good, is to be torn
  from that home which is to him an earthly Paradise, and transferred to a
  place of which we had better not ask the urchin his own private opinion. We
  appeal to every mother&mdash;and it is a mother who is best capable of
  judging for a child&mdash;whether her darling returns to her improved in her
  eyes after his first half-year at school. She looks in vain for the pliant,
  affectionate disposition that a word from her used to be capable, of moulding
  at will, and finds instead a stubborn self-sufficient spirit that has been
  called forth by harsh treatment and intercourse with the mimic world of boys;
  more selfish and more conventional, because less characteristic than that of
  men. He is impatient of her tenderness now, nay, half ashamed to return it.
  Already he aspires to be a man, in his own eyes, and thinks it manly to make
  light of those affections and endearments by which he once set such store.
  The mother is no longer all in all in his heart, her empire is divided and
  weakened, soon it will be swept away, and she sighs for the white-frock days
  when her child was fondly and entirely her own. Now, I cannot help thinking
  the longer these days last the better. Anxious parent, what do you wish your
  boy to become? A successful man in after life?&mdash;then rear him tenderly
  and carefully at first. You would not bit a colt at two years old; be not
  less patient with your own flesh and blood. Nature is the best guide, you may
  depend. Leave him to the women till his strength is established and his
  courage high, and when the metal has assumed shape and consistency, to the
  forge with it as soon as you will. Hardship, buffetings, adversity, all these
  are good for the <i>youth</i>, but, for Heaven's sake, spare the
  <i>child</i>.</p>

  <p>Forty boys are droning away at their tasks on a bright sunshiny morning in
  June, and I am sitting at an old oak desk, begrimed and splashed with the
  inkshed of many generations, and hacked by the knives of idler after idler
  for the last fifty years. I have yet to learn by heart some two score lines
  from the Aeneid. How I hate Virgil whilst I bend over those dog's-eared
  leaves and that uncomfortable desk. How I envy the white butterfly of which I
  have just got a glimpse as he soars away into the blue sky&mdash;for no
  terrestrial objects are visible from our schoolroom window to distract our
  attention and interfere with our labours. I have already accompanied him in
  fancy over the lawn, and the garden, and the high white-thorn fence into the
  meadow beyond,&mdash;how well I know the deep glades of that copse for which
  he is making; how I wish I was on my back in its shadow now. Never mind,
  to-day is a half-holiday, and this afternoon I will spend somehow in a dear
  delicious ramble through the fairy-land of "out of bounds." The rap of our
  master's cane against his desk&mdash;a gentlemanlike method of awakening
  attention and asserting authority&mdash;startles me from my day-dream.
  "March," for we drop the Mr. prefixed, in speaking of our pedagogue, "March
  is a bit of a Tartar, and I tremble for the result."</p>

  <p>"Egerton to come up."</p>

  <p>Egerton goes up accordingly, with many misgivings, and embarks, like a
  desperate man, on the loathed <i>infandum Regina jubes</i>.</p>

  <p>The result may be gathered from March's observations as he returns me the
  book.</p>

  <p>"Not a line correct, sir; stand down, sir; the finest passage of the poet
  shamefully mangled and defaced; it is a perfect disgrace to Everdon. Remain
  in till five, sir; and repeat the whole lesson to Mr. Manners."</p>

  <p>"Please, sir, I tried to learn it, sir; indeed I did, sir."</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me, sir; <i>tried</i> to learn it, indeed. If it had been
  French or German, or&mdash;or any of these useless branches of learning, you
  would have had it by heart fast enough; but Latin, sir, Latin is the
  foundation of a gentleman's education; Latin you were sent here to acquire,
  and Latin, sir" (with an astounding rap on the desk), "you <i>shall</i>
  learn, or I'll know the reason why."</p>

  <p>I may remark that March, though an excellent scholar, professed utter
  contempt for all but the dead languages.</p>

  <p>I determined to make one more effort to save my half-holiday.</p>

  <p>"Please, sir, if I might look over it once more, I could say it when the
  second class goes down; please, sir, won't you give me another chance?"</p>

  <p>March was not, in schoolboy parlance, "half a bad fellow," and he did give
  me another chance, and I came up to him once more at the conclusion of
  school, having repeated the whole forty lines to myself without missing a
  word; but, alas! when I stood again on the step which led up to the dreaded
  desk, and gave away the book into those uncompromising hands, and heard that
  stern voice with its "Now, sir, begin," my intellects forsook me altogether,
  and while the floor seemed to rock under me, I made such blunders and
  confusion of the chief's oration to the love-sick queen, as drove March to
  the extremity of that very short tether which he was pleased to call his
  "patience," and drew upon myself the dreaded condemnation I had fought so
  hard to escape.</p>

  <p>"Remain in, sir, till perfect, and repeat to Mr. Manners, without a
  mistake&mdash;Mr. Manners, you will be kind enough to see, <i>without a
  mistake</i>! Boys!" (with another rap of the cane) "school's up." March locks
  his desk with a bang, and retires. Mr. Manners puts on his hat. Forty boys
  burst instantaneously into tumultuous uproar, forty pairs of feet scuffle
  along the dusty boards, forty voices break into song and jest and glee, forty
  spirits are emancipated from the prison-house into freedom and air and
  sunshine&mdash;forty, all save one.</p>

  <p>So again I turn to the <i>infandum Eegina Jubes</i>, and sit me down and
  cry.</p>

  <p>I had gone late to school, but I was a backward child in everything save
  my proficiency in modern languages. I had never known a mother, and the
  little education I had acquired was picked up in a desultory manner here and
  there during my travels with my father, and afterwards in a gloomy old
  library at Alton Grange, his own place in the same county as Mr. March's
  school. My father had remained abroad till his affairs made it imperative
  that he should return to England, and for some years we lived in seclusion at
  Alton, with an establishment that even my boyish penetration could discover
  was reduced to the narrowest possible limits. I think this was the idlest
  period of my life. I did no lessons, unless my father's endeavour to teach me
  painting, an art that I showed year after year less inclination to master,
  could be called so. I had but few ideas, yet they were very dear ones. I
  adored my father; on him I lavished all the love that would have been a
  mother's right; and having no other relations&mdash;none in the world that I
  cared for, or that cared for me, even nurse Nettich having remained in
  Hungary&mdash;my father was all-in-all. I used to wait at his door of a
  morning to hear him wake, and go away quite satisfied without letting him
  know. I used to watch him for miles when he rode out, and walk any distance
  to meet him on his way home. To please him I would even mount a quiet pony
  that he had bought on purpose for me, and dissemble my terrors because I saw
  they annoyed my kind father. I was a very shy, timid, and awkward boy,
  shrinking from strangers with a fear that was positively painful, and liking
  nothing so well as a huge arm-chair in the gloomy oak wainscoted library,
  where I would sit by the hour reading old poetry, old plays, old novels, and
  wandering about till I lost myself in a world of my own creating, full of
  beauty and romance, and all that ideal life which we must perforce call
  nonsense, but which, were it reality, would make this earth a heaven. Such
  was a bad course of training for a boy whose disposition was naturally too
  dreamy and imaginative, too deficient in energy and practical good sense. Had
  it gone on I must have become a madman; what is it but madness to live in a
  world of our own? I shall never forget the break-up of my dreams, the
  beginning, to me, of hard practical life.</p>

  <p>I was coiled up in my favourite attitude, buried in the depths of a huge
  arm-chair in the library, and devouring with all my senses and all my soul
  the pages of the <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>, that most voluminous and least
  instructive of romances, but one for which, to my shame be it said, I confess
  to this day a sneaking kindness. I was gazing on Queen Guenever, as I
  pictured her to myself, in scarlet and ermine and pearls, with raven hair
  plaited over her queenly brow, and soft violet eyes, looking kindly down on
  mailed Sir Launcelot at her feet. I was holding Arthur's helmet in the
  forest, as the frank, handsome, stalwart monarch bent over a sparkling rill
  and cooled his sunburnt cheek, and laved his chestnut beard, whilst the
  sunbeams flickered through the green leaves and played upon his gleaming
  corslet and his armour of proof. I was feasting at Camelot with the Knights
  of the Round Table, jesting with Sir Dinadam, discussing grave subjects of
  high import with Sir Gawain, or breaking a lance in knightly courtesy with
  Sir Tristram and Sir Bore; in short, I was a child at a spectacle, but the
  spectacle came and went, and grew more and more gorgeous at will. In the
  midst of my dreams in walked my father, and sat down opposite the old
  arm-chair.</p>

  <p>"Vere," said he, "you must go to school."</p>

  <p>The announcement took away my breath: I had never, in my wildest moments,
  contemplated such a calamity.</p>

  <p>"To school, papa; and when?" I mustered up courage to ask, clinging like a
  convict to the hope of a reprieve.</p>

  <p>"The first of the month, my boy," answered my father, rather bullying
  himself into firmness, for I fancy he hated the separation as much as I did;
  "Mr. March writes me that his scholars will reunite on the first of next
  month, and he has a vacancy for you. We must make a man of you, Vere; and
  young De Rohan, your Hungarian friend, is going there too. You will have lots
  of playfellows, and get on very well, I have no doubt; and Everdon is not so
  far from here, and&mdash;and&mdash;you will be very comfortable, I trust; but
  I am loth to part with you, my dear, and that's the truth."</p>

  <p>I felt as if I could have endured martyrdom when my father made this
  acknowledgment. I could do anything if I was only coaxed and pitied a little;
  and when I saw he was so unhappy at the idea of our separation, I resolved
  that no word or look of mine should add to his discomfort, although I felt my
  heart breaking at the thoughts of bidding him good-bye and leaving the
  Grange, with its quiet regularity and peaceful associations, for the noise
  and bustle and discipline of a large school. Queen Guenever and Sir Launcelot
  faded hopelessly from my mental vision, and in their places rose up stern
  forms of harsh taskmasters and satirical playfellows, early hours, regular
  discipline, Latin and Greek, and, worst of all, a continual bustle and a life
  in a crowd.</p>

  <p>There were two peculiarities in my boyish character which, more than any
  others, unfitted me for battling with the world. I had a morbid dread of
  ridicule, which made me painfully shy of strangers. I have on many an
  occasion stood with my hand on the lock of a door, dreading to enter the room
  in which I heard strange voices, and then, plunging in with a desperate
  effort, have retired again as abruptly, covered with confusion, and so
  nervous as to create in the minds of the astonished guests a very natural
  doubt as to my mental sanity. The other peculiarity was an intense love of
  solitude. I was quite happy with my father, but if I could not enjoy his
  society, I preferred my own to that of any other mortal. I would take long
  walks by myself&mdash;I would sit for hours and read by myself&mdash;I had a
  bedroom of my own, into which I hated even a servant to set foot&mdash;and
  perhaps the one thing I dreaded more than all besides in my future life was,
  that I should never, never, be <i>alone</i>.</p>

  <p>How I prized the last few days I spent at home; how I gazed on all the
  well-known objects as if I should never see them again; how the very chairs
  and tables seemed to bid me good-bye like old familiar friends. I had none of
  the lively anticipations which most boys cherish of the manliness and
  independence arising from a school-life; no long vista of cricket and
  football, and fame in their own little world, with increasing strength and
  stature, to end in a tailed coat, and even whiskers! No, I hated the idea of
  the whole thing. I expected to be miserable at Everdon, and, I freely
  confess, was not disappointed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII. &mdash; PLAY</h2>

  <p class="first">Dinner was over, and play-time begun for all but me, and
  again I turned to the <i>infandum Regina jubes</i>, and sat me down to
  cry.</p>

  <p>A kind hand, grimed with ink, was laid on my shoulder, a pair of soft blue
  eyes looked into my face, and Victor de Rohan, my former playfellow, my
  present fast friend and declared "chum," sat down on the form beside me, and
  endeavoured to console me in distress.</p>

  <p>"I'll help you, Egerton," said the warm-hearted lad; "say it to me; March
  is a beast, but Manners is a good fellow; Manners will hear you now, and we
  shall have our half-holiday after all."</p>

  <p>"I can't, I can't," was my desponding reply. "Manners won't hear me, I
  know, till I am perfect, and I never can learn this stupid sing-song story.
  How I hate Queen Dido&mdash;how I hate Virgil. You should read about
  Guenever, Victor, and King Arthur! I'll tell you about them this afternoon;"
  and the tears came again into my eyes as I remembered there was no afternoon
  for me.</p>

  <p>"Try once more," said Victor; "I'll get Manners to hear you; leave it to
  me; I know how to do it. I'll ask Ropsley." And Victor was off into the
  playground ere I was aware, in search of this valuable auxiliary.</p>

  <p>Now, Ropsley was the mainspring round which turned the whole of our little
  world at Everdon. If an excuse for a holiday could be found, Ropsley was
  entreated to ask the desired favour of March. If a quarrel had to be
  adjusted, either in the usual course of ordeal by battle, or the less
  decisive method of arbitration, Ropsley was always invited to see fair play.
  He was the king of our little community. It was whispered that he could spar
  better than Manners, and construe better than March: he was certainly a more
  perfect linguist&mdash;as indeed I could vouch for from my own
  knowledge&mdash;than Schwartz, who came twice a week to teach us a rich
  German-French. We saw his boots were made by Hoby, and we felt his coats
  could only be the work of Stulz, for in those days Poole was not, and we were
  perfectly willing to believe that he wore a scarlet hunting-coat in the
  Christmas holidays, and had visiting cards of his own. In person he was tall
  and slim, with a pale complexion, and waving, soft brown hair: without being
  handsome, he was distinguished-looking; and even as a boy, I have seen
  strangers turn round and ask who he was; but the peculiar feature of his
  countenance was his light grey eye, veiled with long black eyelashes. It
  never seemed to kindle or to waver or to wink; it was always the same, hard,
  penetrating, and unmoved; it never smiled, though the rest of his features
  would laugh heartily enough, and it certainly never wept. Even in boyhood it
  was the eye of a cool, calculating, wary man. He knew the secrets of every
  boy in the school, but no one ever dreamt of cross-questioning Ropsley. We
  believed he only stayed at Everdon as a favour to March, who was immensely
  proud of his pupil's gentlemanlike manners and appearance, as well as of his
  scholarly proficiency, although no one ever saw him study, and we always
  expected Ropsley was "going to leave this half." We should not have been the
  least surprised to hear he had been sent for by the Sovereign, and created a
  peer of the realm on the spot; with all our various opinions, we were
  unanimous in one creed&mdash;that nothing was impossible for Ropsley, and he
  need only try, to succeed. For myself, I was dreadfully afraid of this
  luminary, and looked up to him with feelings of veneration which amounted to
  positive awe.</p>

  <p>Not so Victor; the young Hungarian feared, I believe, nothing on earth,
  and <i>respected</i> but little. He was the only boy in the school who,
  despite the difference of age, would talk with Ropsley upon equal terms; and
  if anything could have added to the admiration with which we regarded the
  latter, it would have been the accurate knowledge he displayed of De Rohan's
  family, their history, their place in Hungary, all their belongings, as if he
  himself had been familiar with Edeldorf from boyhood. But so it was with
  everything; Ropsley knew all about people in general better than they did
  themselves.</p>

  <p>Victor rushed back triumphantly into the schoolroom, where I still sat
  desponding at my desk, and Ropsley followed him.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, Vere?" he asked, in a patronising tone, and calling me
  by my Christian name, which I esteemed a great compliment. "What's the
  matter?" he repeated; "forty lines of Virgil to say; come, that's not
  much."</p>

  <p>"But I <i>can't</i> learn it," I urged. "You must think me very stupid;
  and if it was French, or German, or English, I should not mind twice the
  quantity, but I cannot learn Latin, and it's no use trying."</p>

  <p>The older boy sneered; it seemed so easy to him with his powerful mind to
  get forty lines of hexameters by heart. I believe he could have repeated the
  whole <i>Aeneid</i> without book from beginning to end.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to go out to-day, Vere?" said he.</p>

  <p>I clasped my hands in supplication, as I replied, "Oh! I would give
  anything, <i>anything</i>, to get away from this horrid schoolroom, and
  'shirk out' with Victor and Bold."</p>

  <p>The latter, be it observed, was a dog in whose society I took great
  delight, and whom I kept in the village, at an outlay of one shilling per
  week, much to the detriment of my personal fortune.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said the great man; "come with me to Manners, and bring your
  book with you."</p>

  <p>So I followed my deliverer into the playground, with the <i>infandum
  Regina</i> still weighing heavily on my soul.</p>

  <p>Manners, the usher, was playing cricket with some dozen of the bigger
  boys, and was in the act of "going for a sixer." His coat and waistcoat were
  off, and his shirt-sleeves tucked up, disclosing his manly arms bared to the
  elbow; and Manners was in his glory, for, notwithstanding the beard upon his
  chin, our usher was as very a boy at heart as the youngest urchin in the
  lower class. A dandy, too, was Manners, and a wight of an imaginative turn of
  mind, which chiefly developed itself in the harmless form of bright visions
  for the future, teeming with romantic adventures, of which he was himself to
  be the hero. His past he seldom dwelt upon. His aspirations were
  military&mdash;his ideas extravagant. He was great on the Peninsula and Lord
  Anglesey at Waterloo; and had patent boxes in his high-heeled boots that only
  required the addition of heavy clanking spurs to complete the illusion that
  Mr. Manners ought to be a cavalry officer. Of his riding he spoke largely;
  but his proficiency in this exercise we had no means of ascertaining. There
  were two things, however, on which Manners prided himself, and which were a
  source of intense amusement to the urchins by whom he was
  surrounded:&mdash;these were, his personal strength, and his whiskers; the
  former quality was encouraged to develop itself by earnest application to all
  manly sports and exercises; the latter ornaments were cultivated and enriched
  with every description of "nutrifier," "regenerator," and "unguent" known to
  the hairdresser or the advertiser. Alas! without effect proportioned to the
  perseverance displayed; two small patches of fluff under the jaw-bones, that
  showed to greatest advantage by candlelight, being the only evidence of so
  much painstaking and cultivation thrown away. Of his muscular prowess,
  however, it behoved us to speak with reverence. Was it not on record in the
  annals of the school that when the "King of Naples," our dissipated pieman,
  endeavoured to justify by force an act of dishonesty by which he had done
  Timmins minor out of half-a-crown, Manners stripped at once to his
  shirt-sleeves, and "went in" at the Monarch with all the vigour and activity
  of some three-and-twenty summers against three-score? The Monarch, a
  truculent old ruffian, with a red neckcloth, half-boots, and one eye, fought
  gallantly for a few rounds, and was rather getting the best of it, when,
  somewhat unaccountably, he gave in, leaving the usher master of the field.
  Ropsley, who gave his friend a knee, <i>secundum artem</i>, and urged him,
  with frequent injunctions, to "fight high," attributed this easy victory to
  the forbearance of their antagonist, who had an eye to future trade and
  mercantile profits; but Manners, whose account of the battle I have heard
  more than once, always scouted this view of the transaction.</p>

  <p>"He went down, sir, as if he was shot," he would say, doubling his arm,
  and showing the muscles standing out in bold relief. "Few men have the biceps
  so well developed as mine, and he went down <i>as if he was shot</i>. If I
  had hit him as hard as I could, sir, I <i>must</i> have killed him!"</p>

  <p>Our usher was a good-natured fellow, notwithstanding.</p>

  <p>"I'll hear you in ten minutes, Egerton," said he, "when I have had my
  innings;" and forthwith he stretched himself into attitude, and prepared to
  strike.</p>

  <p>"Better give me your bat," remarked Ropsley, who was too lazy to play
  cricket in a regular manner. Of course, Manners consented; nobody ever
  refused Ropsley anything; and in ten minutes' time I had repeated the
  <i>infandum Regina</i>, and Ropsley had added some dozen masterly hits to the
  usher's score. Ropsley always liked another man's "innings" better than his
  own.</p>

  <p>Now the regulations at Everdon, as they were excessively strict, and based
  upon the principle that Apollo should always keep the bow at the utmost
  degree of tension, so were they eluded upon every available opportunity, and
  set at nought and laughed at by the youngest urchins in the school. We had an
  ample playground for our minor sports, and a meadow beyond, in which we were
  permitted to follow the exhilarating pastime of cricket, the share of the
  younger boys in that exciting amusement being limited to a pursuit of the
  ball round the field, and a prompt return of the same to their seniors,
  doubtless a necessary ingredient in this noble game, but one which is not
  calculated to excite enthusiastic pleasure in the youthful mind. From the
  playground and its adjacent meadow it was a capital offence to absent
  oneself. All the rest of Somersetshire was "out of bounds"; and to be caught
  "out of bounds" was a crime for which corporal punishment was the invariable
  reward. At the same time, the offence was, so to speak, "winked at." No
  inquiries were made as to how we spent half-holidays between one o'clock and
  seven; and many a glorious ramble we used to have during those precious six
  hours in all the ecstasy of "freedom,"&mdash;a word understood by none better
  than the schoolboy. A certain deference was, however, exacted to the
  regulations of the establishment; by a sort of tacit compact, it seemed to be
  understood that our code was so far Spartan as to make, not the crime, but
  the being "found out," a punishable offence, and boys were always supposed to
  take their chance. If seen in the act of escaping, or afterwards met by any
  of the masters in the surrounding country, we were liable to be flogged; and
  to do March justice, we always <i>were</i> flogged, and pretty soundly, too.
  Under these circumstances, some little care and circumspection had to be
  observed in starting for our rambles. Certain steps had been made in the
  playground wall, where it was hidden from the house by the stem of a fine old
  elm, and by dropping quietly down into an orchard beyond&mdash;an orchard, be
  it observed, of which the fruit was always plucked before it reached
  maturity&mdash;and then stealing along the back of a thick, high hedge, we
  could get fairly away out of sight of the school windows, and so make our
  escape.</p>

  <p>Now, on the afternoon in question we had planned an expedition in which
  Victor, and I, and my dog Bold had determined to be principal performers. Of
  the latter personage in the trio I must remark, that no party of pleasure on
  which we embarked was ever supposed to be perfect without his society. His
  original possessor was the "King of Naples," whom I have already mentioned,
  and who, I conclude, stole him, as he appeared one day tied to that personage
  by an old cotton handkerchief, and looking as wobegone and unhappy as a
  retriever puppy of some three months old, torn from his mamma and his
  brothers and sisters, and the comfortable kennel in which he was brought up,
  and transferred to the tender mercies of a drunken, poaching, dog-stealing
  ruffian, was likely to feel in so false a position. The "King" brought him
  into our playground on one of his tart-selling visits, as a specimen of the
  rarest breed of retrievers known in the West of England. The puppy seemed so
  thoroughly miserable, and looked up at me so piteously, that I forthwith
  asked his price, and after a deal of haggling, and a consultation between De
  Rohan and myself, I determined to become his purchaser, at the munificent sum
  of one sovereign, of which ten shillings (my all) were to be paid on the
  spot, and the other ten to remain, so to speak, on mortgage upon the animal,
  with the further understanding that he should be kept at the residence of the
  "King of Naples," who, in consideration of the regular payment of one
  shilling per week, bound himself to feed the same and complete his education
  in all the canine branches of plunging, diving, fetching and carrying, on a
  system of his own, which he briefly described as "fust-rate."</p>

  <p>With a deal of prompting from Manners, I got through my forty lines; and
  he shut the book with a good-natured smile as Ropsley threw down the bat he
  had been wielding so skilfully, and put on his coat.</p>

  <p>"Come and lunch with me at 'The Club,'" said he to Manners, whom he led
  completely by the nose; "I'll give you Dutch cheese, and sherry and
  soda-water, and a cigar. Hie! Vere, you ungrateful little ruffian, where are
  you off to? I want you."</p>

  <p>I was making my escape as rapidly as possible at the mention of "The
  Club," a word which we younger boys held in utter fear and detestation, as
  being associated in our minds with much perilous enterprise and gratuitous
  suffering. The Club consisted of an old bent tree in a retired corner of the
  playground, on the trunk of which Ropsley had caused a comfortable seat to be
  fashioned for his own delectation; and here, in company with Manners and two
  or three senior boys, it was his custom to sit smoking and drinking curious
  compounds, of which the ingredients, being contraband, had to be fetched by
  us, at the risk of corporal punishment, from the village of Everdon, an
  honest half-mile journey at the least.</p>

  <p>Ropsley tendered a large cigar to Manners, lit one himself, settled his
  long limbs comfortably on the seat, and gave me his orders.</p>

  <p>"One Dutch cheese, three pottles of strawberries&mdash;now attend,
  confound you!&mdash;two bottles of old sherry from 'The
  Greyhound,'&mdash;mind, the OLD sherry; half-a-dozen of soda-water, and a
  couple of pork-pies. Put the whole into a basket; they'll give you one at the
  bar, if you say it's for me, and tell them to put it down to my account. Put
  a clean napkin over the basket, and if you dirty the napkin or break the
  bottles, I'll break <i>your</i> head! Now be off! Manners, I'll take your two
  to one he does it without a mistake, and is back here under the
  five-and-twenty minutes."</p>

  <p>I did not dare disobey, but I was horribly disgusted at having to employ
  any portion of my half-holiday in so uncongenial a manner. I rushed back into
  the schoolroom for my cap, and held a hurried consultation with Victor as to
  our future proceedings.</p>

  <p>"He only got you off because he wanted you to 'shirk out' for him,"
  exclaimed my indignant chum; "it's a shame, <i>that</i> it is. Don't go for
  him, Vere; let's get out quietly, and be off to Beverley. It's the last
  chance, so old 'Nap' says" (this was an abbreviation for the "King of
  Naples," who was in truth a great authority both with Victor and myself);
  "and it's <i>such</i> a beautiful afternoon."</p>

  <p>"But what a licking I shall get from Ropsley," I interposed, with
  considerable misgivings; "he's sure to say I'm an ungrateful little beast. I
  don't like to be called ungrateful, Victor, and I don't like to be called a
  little beast."</p>

  <p>"Oh, never mind the names, and a licking is soon over," replied Victor,
  who learned little from his <i>Horace</i> save the <i>carpe
  diem</i>philosophy, and who looked upon the licking with considerably more
  resignation than did the probable recipient. "We shall just have time to do
  it, if we start now. Come on, old fellow; be plucky for once, and come
  on."</p>

  <p>I was not proof against the temptation. The project was a long-planned
  one, and I could not bear the thoughts of giving it up now. Many a time in
  our rambles had we surmounted the hill that looked down upon Beverley Manor,
  and viewed it from afar as a sort of unknown fairyland. What a golden time
  one's boyhood was! A day at Beverley was our dream of all that was most
  exciting in adventure, most voluptuous in delight; and now "Nap" had promised
  to accompany us to this earthly Paradise, and show us what he was pleased to
  term its "hins-an'-houts." Not all the cheeses of Holland should prevent my
  having one day's liberty and enjoyment. I weighed well the price: the certain
  licking, and the sarcastic abuse which I feared even more; and I think I held
  my half-holiday all the dearer for having to purchase it at such a cost.</p>

  <p>We were across the playground like lapwings. Ropsley, who was deep in his
  cigar and a copy of <i>Bell's Life</i>, which forbidden paper he caused
  Manners to take in for him surreptitiously, never dreamed that his behests
  could be treated with contempt, and hardly turned his head to look at us. We
  surmounted the wall with an agility born of repeated practice; we stole along
  the adjacent orchard, under covert of the well-known friendly hedge, and only
  breathed freely when we found ourselves completely out of sight of the house,
  and swinging along the Everdon lane at a schoolboy's jog, which, like the
  Highlander's, is equivalent to any other person's gallop. No pair of carriage
  horses can step together like two schoolboy "chums" who are in the constant
  habit of being late in company. Little boys as we were, Victor and I could do
  our five miles in the hour without much difficulty, keeping step like
  clockwork, and talking the whole time.</p>

  <p>In five minutes we were at the wicket of a small tumble-down building,
  with dilapidated windows and a ruinous thatched roof, which was in fact the
  dwelling of no less a personage than the "King of Naples," but was seldom
  alluded to by that worthy in more definite terms than "the old place," or "my
  shop"; and this only when in a particularly confidential mood&mdash;its
  existence being usually indicated by a jerk of the head towards his blind
  side, which was supposed to infer proper caution, and a decorous respect for
  the sanctity of private life. It was indeed one of those edifices of which
  the word "tenement" seems alone to convey an adequate description. The garden
  produce consisted of a ragged shirt and a darned pair of worsted stockings,
  whilst a venerable buck rabbit looked solemnly out from a hutch on one side
  of the doorway, and a pair of red-eyed ferrets shed their fragrance from a
  rough deal box on the other. "Nap" himself was not to be seen on a visitor's
  first entrance into his habitation, but generally appeared after a mysterious
  delay, from certain back settlements, of which one never discovered the exact
  "whereabout." A grimy old woman, with her skirts pinned up, was invariably
  washing the staircase when we called, and it was only in obedience to her
  summons that "Nap" himself could be brought forward. This dame possessed a
  superstitious interest in the eyes of us boys, on account of the mysterious
  relationship in which she stood to "Nap." He always addressed her as
  "mother"&mdash;but no boy at Everdon had yet ascertained whether this was a
  generic term significant of age and sex, an appellation of endearment to a
  spouse, or a tribute of filial reverence from a son.</p>

  <p>"Come, 'Nap,' look alive," halloed Victor, as we rushed up the narrow path
  that led from the wicket to the door, in breathless haste not to lose the
  precious moments of our half-holiday. "Now, mother, where is he?" added the
  lively young truant. "Time's up; 'Nap'&mdash;'Nap'!"&mdash;and the walls
  echoed to Victor's rich, laughing voice, and half-foreign accent. As usual,
  after an interval of a few minutes, "Nap" himself appeared at the back door
  of the cottage, with a pair of greased half-boots in one hand, and a ferret,
  that nestled confidingly against his cheek, in the other.</p>

  <p>"Sarvice, young gen'elmen," said "Nap," wiping his mouth with the back of
  his hand&mdash;"Sarvice, my lord; sarvice, Muster Egerton," repeated he, on
  recognising his two stanchest patrons. "Here, Bold! Bold!&mdash;you do know
  your master, sure-lie," as Bold came rollicking forth from the back-yard in
  which he lived, and testified his delight by many ungainly gambols and
  puppy-like freedoms, which were responded to as warmly by his delighted
  owner. My scale of affections at this period of life was easily defined. I
  loved three objects in the world&mdash;viz., my father, Victor, and Bold. I
  verily believe I cared for nothing on earth but those three; and certainly my
  dog came in for his share of regard. Bold, although in all the awkwardness of
  puppyhood, was already beginning to show symptoms of that sagacity which
  afterwards developed itself into something very few degrees inferior to
  reason, if indeed it partook not of that faculty which we men are anxious to
  assume as solely our own. He would already obey the slightest
  sign&mdash;would come to heel at a whisper from his owner or
  instructor&mdash;would drag up huge stones out of ten feet of water, with
  ludicrous energy and perseverance; and stand waiting for further orders with
  his head on one side, and an expression of comic intelligence on his handsome
  countenance that was delightfully ridiculous. He promised to be of great size
  and strength; and even at this period, when he put his forepaws on my
  shoulders and licked my face, he was considerably the larger animal of the
  two. Such familiarities, however, were much discouraged by "Nap."</p>

  <p>"If so be as you would keep a 'dawg,' real sporting and dawg-like,
  master," that philosopher would observe, "let un know his distance; I strikes
  'em whenever I can reach 'em. Fondlin' of 'em only spiles 'em&mdash;same as
  women."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; THE TRUANTS</h2>

  <p class="first">So the day to which we had looked forward with such delight
  had arrived at last. Our spirits rose as we got further and further from
  Everdon, and we never stopped to take breath or to look back till we found
  ourselves surmounting the last hill above Beverley Manor. By this time we had
  far outstripped our friend "Nap"&mdash;that worthy deeming it inconsistent
  with all his maxims ever to hurry himself. "Slow and sure, young gentlemen,"
  he observed soon after we started&mdash;"slow and sure wins the day. Do'ee go
  on ahead, and wait for I top of Buttercup Close. I gits on better arter a
  drop o' drink this hot weather. Never fear, squire, I'll not fail ye! Bold!
  Bold! you go on with your master." So "Nap" turned into the "Cat and Fiddle,"
  and we pursued our journey alone, not very sorry to be rid of our companion
  for the present; as, notwithstanding our great admiration for his many
  resources, his knowledge of animal life, his skilful method with rats, and
  general manliness of character, we could not but be conscious of our own
  inferiority in these branches of science, and of a certain want of community
  in ideas between two young gentlemen receiving a polite education at Everdon,
  and a rat-catching, dog-stealing poacher of the worst class.</p>

  <p>"It's as hot as Hungary," said Victor, seating himself on a stile, and
  taking off his cap to fan his handsome, heated face. "Oh, Vere, I wish I was
  back in the Fatherland! Do you remember the great wood at Edeldorf, and the
  boar we saw close to the ponies? And oh, Vere, how I should like to be upon
  Gold-kind once again!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Victor, I remember it all," I answered, as I flung myself down among
  the buttercups, and turned my cheek to the cool air that came up the
  valley&mdash;a breeze that blew from the distant hills to the southward, and
  swept across many a mile of beauty ere it sighed amongst the woods of
  Beverley, and rippled the wide surface of the mere; "I shall never forget
  Edeldorf, nor my first friend, Victor. But what made you think of Hungary
  just now?"</p>

  <p>"Why, your beautiful country," answered Victor, pointing to the luxuriant
  scene below us&mdash;a scene that could exist in England only&mdash;of rich
  meadows, and leafy copses, and green slopes laughing in the sunlight, dotted
  with huge old standard trees, and the deep shades of Beverley, with the white
  garden-wall standing out from amongst yew hedges, and rare pines, and exotic
  evergreens; while the grey turrets of the Manor House peeped and peered here
  and there through the giant elms that stirred and flickered in the summer
  breeze. The mere was glittering at our feet, and the distant uplands melting
  away into the golden haze of summer. Child as I was, I could have cried,
  without knowing why, as I sat there on the grass, drinking in beauty at every
  pore. What is it that gives to all beauty, animate or inanimate, a tinge of
  melancholy?&mdash;the greater the beauty, the deeper the tinge. Is it an
  instinct of mortality? the "bright must fade" of the poet? a shadowy regret
  for Dives, who, no more than Lazarus, can secure enjoyment for a day? or is
  it a vague yearning for something more perfect still?&mdash;a longing of the
  soul for the unattainable, which, more than all the philosophy in the
  universe, argues the necessity of a future state. I could not analyse my
  feelings. I did not then believe that others experienced the same sensations
  as myself. I only knew that, like Parson Hugh, I had "great dispositions to
  cry."</p>

  <p>"I wish I were a man, Vere," remarked Victor, as he pulled out his knife,
  and began to carve a huge V on the top bar of the stile. "I should like to be
  grown up now, and you too, Vere; what a life we would lead! Let me see, I
  should have six horses for myself, and three&mdash;no, four for you; and a
  pack of hounds, like Mr. Barker's, that we saw last half, coming home from
  hunting; and two rifles, both double-barrelled. Do you know, I hit the
  bull's-eye with papa's rifle, when Prince Vocqsal was at Edeldorf, and he
  said I was the best shot in Hungary for my age. Look at that crow, Vere,
  perching on the branch of the old hawthorn&mdash;I could put a bullet into
  him from here. Oh! I wish I had papa's rifle!"</p>

  <p>"But should you not like to be King of Hungary, Victor?" said I, for I
  admired my "chum" so ardently, that I believed him fit for any position,
  however exalted. "Should you not like to be king, and ride about upon a white
  horse, with a scarlet tunic and pelisse, and ostrich feathers in your hat,
  bowing right and left to the ladies at the windows, with a Hungarian
  body-guard clattering behind you, and the people shouting and flinging up
  their caps in the street?" I saw it all in my mind's eye, and fancied my
  friend the hero of the procession. Victor hesitated, and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I think I had rather be a General of Division, like Wallenstein, and
  command ten thousand cavalry; or better still, Vere, ride and shoot as well
  as Prince Vocqsal, and go up into the mountains after deer, and kill bears
  and wolves and wild boars, and do what I like. Wouldn't I just pack up my
  books, and snap my fingers at March, and leave Everdon to-morrow, if I could
  take you with me. But you, Vere, if you could have your own way, what would
  you be?"</p>

  <p>I was not long answering, for there was scarcely a day that I did not
  consider the subject; but my aspirations for myself were so humble, that I
  hesitated a little lest Victor should laugh at me, before I replied.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I will do whatever my father wishes, Victor; and I hope he will
  sometimes let me go to you; but if I could do exactly what I liked, if a
  fairy was at this moment to come out of that bluebell and offer me my choice,
  I should ask to be a doctor, Victor, and to live somewhere on this hill."</p>

  <p>"<i>Sappramento!</i>" exclaimed Victor, swearing, in his astonishment, his
  father's favourite oath&mdash;"a doctor, Vere! and why?"</p>

  <p>"Well," I answered, modestly, "I am not like you, Victor; I wish I were.
  Oh, you cannot tell how I wish I were you! To be high-born and rich, and heir
  to a great family, and to have everybody making up to one and admiring
  one&mdash;that is what I should call happiness. But I can never have the
  chance of that. I am shy and stupid and awkward, and&mdash;and,
  Victor"&mdash;I got it out at last, blushing painfully&mdash;"I know that I
  am ugly&mdash;<i>so ugly</i>! It is foolish to care about it, for, after all,
  it is not my fault; but I cannot help wishing for beauty. It is so painful to
  be remarked and laughed at, and I know people laugh at <i>me</i>. Why, I
  heard Ropsley say to Manners, only yesterday, after I had been fagging for
  him at cricket, 'Why, what an ugly little beggar it is!' and Manners said,
  'Yes,' and 'he thought it must be a great misfortune.' And Ropsley laughed
  so, I felt he must be laughing at me, as if I could help it! Oh, Victor, you
  cannot think how I long to be loved; that is why I should like to be a
  doctor. I would live up here in a small cottage, from which I could always
  see this beautiful view; and I would study hard to be very clever&mdash;not
  at Greek and Latin, like March, but at something I could take an interest in;
  and I would have a quiet pony, not a rantipole like your favourite Gold-kind;
  and I would visit the poor people for miles round, and never grudge time nor
  pains for any one in affliction or distress. I would <i>make</i> them fond of
  me, and it would be such happiness to go out on a day like this, and see a
  kind smile for one on everybody's face, good or bad. Nobody loves me now,
  Victor, except papa and you and Bold; and papa, I fear, only because he is my
  papa. I heard him say one day, long ago, to my nurse (you remember nurse
  Nettich?), 'Never mind what the boy is like&mdash;he is my own.' I fear he
  does not care for me for myself. You like me, Victor, because you are used to
  me, and because I like <i>you</i> so much; but that is not exactly the sort
  of liking I mean; and as for Bold&mdash;here, Bold! Bold! Why, what has
  become of the dog? He must have gone back to look for 'Nap.'"</p>

  <p>Sure enough Bold was nowhere visible, having made his escape during our
  conversation; but in his place the worthy "King of Naples" was to be seen
  toiling up the hill, more than three parts drunk, and with a humorous twinkle
  in his solitary eye which betokened mischief.</p>

  <p>"Now, young gents," observed the poacher, settling himself upon the stile,
  and producing from the capacious pockets of his greasy velveteen jacket an
  assortment of snares, night-lines, and other suspicious-looking articles;
  "now, young gents, I promised to show you a bit of sport comin' here to
  Beverley, and a bit of sport we'll have. Fust and foremost, I've agot to lift
  a line or two as I set yesterday in the mere; then we'll just take a turn
  round the pheasantry, for you young gentlemen to see the fowls, you know; Sir
  'Arry, he bain't a comin' back till next week, and Muster Barrells, the
  keeper, he's off into Norfolk, arter pinters, and such like. You keep the dog
  well at heel, squire. Why, whatever has become o' Bold?"</p>

  <p>Alas, Bold himself was heard to answer the question. Self-hunting in an
  adjoining covert, his deep-toned voice was loudly awakening the echoes, and
  scaring the game all over the Manor, to his own unspeakable delight and our
  intense dismay. Forgetful of all the precepts of his puppyhood, he scampered
  hither and thither; now in headlong chase of a hare; now dashing aside after
  a rabbit, putting up pheasants at every stride, and congratulating himself on
  his emancipation and his prowess in notes that could not fail to indicate his
  pursuits to keepers, watchers, all the establishment of Beverley Manor, to
  say nothing of the inhabitants of that and the adjoining parishes.</p>

  <p>Off we started in pursuit, bounding down the hill at our best pace. Old
  "Nap" making run in his own peculiar gait, which was none of the most
  graceful. Victor laughing and shouting with delight; and I frightened out of
  my wits at the temporary loss of my favourite, and the probable consequences
  of his disobedience.</p>

  <p>Long before we could reach the scene of Bold's misdoings, we had been
  observed by two men who were fishing in the mere, and who now gave
  chase&mdash;the one keeping along the valley, so as to cut us off in our
  descent; the other, a long-legged fellow, striding right up the hill at once,
  in case we should turn tail and beat a retreat. "Nap" suddenly
  disappeared&mdash;I have reason to believe he ensconced himself in a deep
  ditch, and there remained until the danger had passed away. Victor and I were
  still descending the hill, calling frantically to Bold. The keeper who had
  taken the lower line of pursuit was gaining rapidly upon us. I now saw that
  he carried a gun under his arm. My dog flashed out of a small belt of young
  trees in hot pursuit of a hare&mdash;tongue out, head down, and tail lowered,
  in full enjoyment of the chase. At the instant he appeared the man in front
  of me stopped dead short. Quick as lightning he lifted his long shining
  barrel. I saw the flash; and ere I heard the report my dog tumbled heels over
  head, and lay upon the sunny sward, as I believed in the agony of that
  moment, stone dead. I strained every nerve to reach him, for I could hear the
  rattle of a ramrod, as the keeper reloaded,&mdash;and I determined to cover
  Bold with my body, and, if necessary, to die with him. I was several paces
  ahead of Victor; whom I now heard calling me by name, but I could think of
  nothing, attend to nothing, but the prostrate animal in front. What a joy it
  Was when I reached him to find he was not actually killed. His fore-leg was
  frightfully mangled by the charge; but as I fell breathless by the side of my
  darling Bold, he licked my face, and I knew there was a chance for him
  still.</p>

  <p>A rough grasp was laid on toy shoulder, and a hoarse voice roused me:</p>

  <p>"Come, young man; I thought I'd drop on to you at last. Now you'll just
  come with me to Sir 'Arry, and we'll see what <i>he</i> has to say to this
  here."</p>

  <p>And on looking up I found myself in the hands of a strong, square-built
  fellow, with a velveteen jacket, and a double-barrelled gun under his arm,
  being no less a person than Sir Harry Beverley's head keeper, and the
  identical individual that had been watching us from the mere, and had made so
  successful a shot at Bold.</p>

  <p>"Come, leave the dog," he added; giving me another shake, and scrutinising
  my apparel, which was evidently not precisely of the description he had
  expected; "leave the dog&mdash;it's no great odds about him; and as for
  <i>you</i>, young gentleman, if you <i>be</i> a young gentleman, you
  <i>had</i>ought to be ashamed of yourself. It's not want as drove you to this
  trade. Come, none of that; you go quietly along of me; it's best for you, I
  tell you."</p>

  <p>I was struggling to free myself from his hold, for I could not bear to
  leave my dog. A thousand horrible anticipations filled my head. Trial,
  transportation, I knew not what, for I had a vague terror of the law, and had
  heard enough of its rigours in regard to the offence of poaching, to fill me
  with indescribable alarm; yet, through it all, I was more concerned for Bold
  than myself. My favourite was dying, I believed, and I could not leave
  him.</p>

  <p>I looked up in the face of my captor. He was a rough, hairy fellow; but
  there was an expression of kindliness in his homely features which encouraged
  me to entreat for mercy.</p>

  <p>"Oh, sir," I pleaded, "let me only take my dog; he's not so very heavy;
  I'll carry him myself. Bold, my darling Bold! He is my own dog, and I'd
  rather you'd kill me too than force me to leave him here."</p>

  <p>The man was evidently mollified, and a good deal puzzled into the bargain.
  I saw my advantage, and pressed it vigorously.</p>

  <p>"I'll go to prison willingly,&mdash;I'll go anywhere you tell
  me,&mdash;only do try and cure Bold. Papa will pay you anything if you'll
  only cure Bold. Victor! Victor!" I added, seeing my chum now coming up,
  likewise in custody, "help me to get this gentleman to save Bold."</p>

  <p>Victor looked flushed, and fiercer than I ever remembered to have seen
  that pretty boyish face. His collar was torn and his dress disordered. He had
  evidently struggled manfully with his captor, and the latter wiped his heated
  brow with an expression of mingled amusement and astonishment, that showed he
  was clearly at his wit's end what to make of his prize.</p>

  <p>"Blowed if I know what to say o' this here, Mr. Barrells," said he to his
  brother functionary. "This little chap's even gamer nor t'other one.
  <i>Run</i>! I never see such a one-er to run. If it hadn't been for the big
  hedge at the corner of the cow-pasture, I'd never a cotched 'un in a month o'
  Sundays; and when I went to lay hold, the young warmint out with his knife
  and offered to whip it into me. He's a rare boy this; I could scarce grip him
  for laughing; but the lad's got a sperret, bless'd if he ain't. I cut my own
  knuckles gettin' of it out of his hands." And he showed Victor's knife to his
  comrade as he spoke.</p>

  <p>Mr. Barrells was a man of reflection, as keepers generally are. He
  examined the knife carefully, and spoke in an undertone to his friend.</p>

  <p>"Do you see this here?" he remarked, pointing to the coronet which was
  inlaid in the steel; "and do you see that there?" he added, with a glance at
  Victor's gold watch-chain, of Parisian fabric. "Put this here and that there
  together, Bill, which it convinces me as these here little chaps is not them
  as we was a lookin' for. Your cove looks a gentleman all over; I knows the
  breed, Bill, and there's no mistake about the real thing; and my precious boy
  here, he wouldn't leave the dawg, not if it was ever so, though he's a very
  little 'un; he's a gentleman too; but that don't make no odds, Bill:
  gentlemen hadn't ought to be up to such-like tricks, nor haven't half the
  excuse of poor folks; and, gentlemen or no gentlemen, they goes before Sir
  'Arry, dog and all, as sure as my name's Barrells!"</p>

  <p>Victor and I looked at each other in hopeless despair; there was, then,
  nothing for it but to undergo the extreme penalty of the law. With hanging
  heads and blushing cheeks we walked between our captors; Bill, who seemed a
  good-natured fellow enough, carrying the unfortunate Bold on his shoulders.
  We thought our shame had reached its climax, but we were doomed to suffer
  even more degradation in this our first visit to Beverley Manor.</p>

  <p>As we threaded the gravel path of a beautiful shrubbery leading to the
  back offices of the Manor House, we met a young girl taking her afternoon's
  walk with her governess, whose curiosity seemed vividly excited by our
  extraordinary procession. To this day I can remember Constance Beverley as
  she stood before me then, the first time I ever saw her. She was scarcely
  more than a child, but her large serious dark eyes, her noble and somewhat
  sad expression of countenance, gave her an interest which mere childish
  beauty could never have possessed. There are some faces that we can discern
  even at such a distance as renders the features totally indistinct, as if the
  expression of countenance reached us by some magnetic process independent of
  vision, and such a face was that of Constance Beverley. I have often heard
  her beauty disputed. I have even known her called plain, though that was
  generally by critics of her own sex, but I never heard any one deny that she
  was <i>uncommon-looking</i>, and always certain to attract attention, even
  where she failed in winning admiration. Victor blushed scarlet, and I felt as
  if I must sink into the earth when this young lady walked up to the keeper,
  and asked him "what he was going to do with those people, and why he was
  taking them to papa?"</p>

  <p>Miss Constance was evidently a favourite with Mr. Barrells, for he stopped
  and doffed his hat with much respect whilst he explained to her the
  circumstance of our pursuit and capture. So long as he alluded only to our
  poaching offences, I thought the little lady looked on us with eyes of kindly
  commiseration; but when he hinted his suspicions of our social position, I
  observed that she immediately assumed an air of marked coldness, and
  transferred her pity to Bold.</p>

  <p>"So you see, Miss, I does my duty by Sir 'Arry without respect to rich or
  poor," was Mr. Barrells' conclusion to a long-winded oration addressed partly
  to the young lady, partly to her governess, and partly to ourselves, the
  shame-faced culprits; "and therefore it is as I brings these young gentlemen
  up to the justice-room, if so be, as I said before, they <i>be</i> young
  gentlemen; and so, Miss Constance, the law must take its course."</p>

  <p>"But you'll take care of the poor dog, Barrells; promise me you'll take
  care of the poor dog," was the young lady's last entreaty as she walked on
  with her governess; and a turn in the shrubbery hid her from our sight.</p>

  <p>"<i>What</i> a half-holiday this has been!" whispered I to my comrade in
  distress, as we neared the house that had so long been an object of such
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Victor, "but it's not over yet."</p>

  <p>Sir Harry was at the farm; we must wait for his return. Meantime we were
  shown into the servants' hall; a large stone chamber devoid of furniture,
  that reminded me of our schoolroom at Everdon&mdash;much as we hated the
  latter, what would we have given to be there now! Cold meat and ale were
  offered us; but, as may well be imagined, we had no appetite to partake of
  them, although in that respect our captors set us a noble example; remaining,
  however, on either side of us as turnkeys watch those who are ordered for
  execution. The servants of the household came one after another to stare at
  the unfortunate culprits, and made audible remarks on our dress and general
  appearance. Victor's beauty won him much favour from the female part of the
  establishment; and a housemaid with a wonderfully smart cap brought him a cup
  of tea, which he somewhat rudely declined. There was considerable discussion
  as to our real position in society carried on without the slightest regard to
  our presence. The under-butler, whose last place was in London, and whose
  professional anxiety about his spoons may have somewhat prejudiced him, gave
  it as his opinion that we belonged to what he called "the swell mob"; but Mr.
  Barrells, who did not seem to understand the term, "pooh-poohed" this
  suggestion with so much dignity as at once to extinguish that official, who
  incontinently retired to his pantry and his native obscurity. The women, who
  generally lean to the most improbable version of a story, were inclined to
  believe that we were sailors, and of foreign extraction; but the most
  degrading theory of all, and one that I am bound to confess met with a large
  majority of supporters, was to the effect that we were run-away 'prentices
  from Fleetsbury, and would be put in the stocks on our return to that market
  town. We had agreed not to give our names except as a last resource, my
  friend clinging, as I thought somewhat hopelessly, to the idea that Sir Harry
  would let us off with a reprimand, and we might get back to Everdon without
  March finding it out. So the great clock ticked loudly in the hall, and there
  we sat in mute endurance. As Victor had before remarked, "it was not over
  yet."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX. &mdash; ROPSLEY</h2>

  <p class="first">Ropsley smoked his cigar on the trunk of the old tree, and
  Manners drank in worldly wisdom from the lips of his junior, whom, however,
  he esteemed as the very guide-book of all sporting and fashionable life. It
  was the ambition of our usher to become a thorough man of the world; and, had
  he been born to a fortune and a title, there was no reason why he should not
  have formed a very fair average young nobleman. His tastes were frivolous
  enough, his egotism sufficiently developed, his manner formed on what he
  conceived the best model. All this was only absurd, I presume, because he was
  an usher; had he been a marquis, he would have shown forth as a "very
  charming person." His admiration of Ropsley was genuine, the latter's
  contempt for his adorer equally sincere, but better concealed. They sit
  puffing away at their cigars, watching the smoke wreathing up into the summer
  sky, and Manners coaxes his whiskers and looks admiringly at his friend.
  Ropsley's cigar is finished, and he dashes it down somewhat impatiently.</p>

  <p>"What can have become of that little wretch?" says he, with a yawn and a
  stretch of his long, well-shaped limbs; "he's probably made some stupid
  mistake, and I shall have to lick him after all. Manners, what have you done
  with the old dog-whip we used to keep for the lower boys?"</p>

  <p>"Safe in my desk," replies Manners, who, being a good-natured fellow,
  likes to keep that instrument of torture locked up; "but Egerton's a good
  little fellow; you mustn't be too hard upon him this time."</p>

  <p>"I never could see the difference between a good fellow and a bad one,"
  replies Ropsley. "If I want a thing done I choose the most likely person to
  do it; and if he fails it's his fault and not mine, and he must suffer for
  it. I've no prejudices, my good friend, and no feelings&mdash;they're only
  different words for the same thing; and, depend upon it, people get on much
  better without them. But come: let's walk down to the village, and look after
  him. I'll go and ask March if he wants anything 'down the road.'"</p>

  <p>Luckily for me, my chastiser had not proceeded half a mile upon his way,
  ere he met the "King of Naples" in person, hot and breathless, flustered with
  drink and running, and more incoherent than usual in his conversation and
  demeanour. He approached Ropsley, who was the most magnificent of his
  patrons, with hat in hand, and somewhat the air of a dog that knows he has
  done wrong.</p>

  <p>"What's up now, you old reprobate?" said the latter, in his most
  supercilious manner&mdash;a manner, I may observe, he adopted to all whom he
  could influence without conciliating, and which made the conciliation doubly
  winning to the favoured few&mdash;"What's up now? Drunk again, I suppose, as
  usual?"</p>

  <p>"Not drunk, squire&mdash;not drunk, as I'm a livin' man," replied the
  poacher, sawing the air in deprecation with a villainously dirty hand;
  "hagitated, perhaps, and over-anxious about the young gentlemen&mdash;Oh!
  them lads, them lads!" and he leered at his patron as much as to hint that he
  had a precious story to tell, if it was only made worth his while.</p>

  <p>"Come, no nonsense!" said Ropsley, sternly; "out with it. What's the
  matter? You've got De Rohan and Egerton into some scrape; I see it in your
  ugly old face. Tell me all about it this instant, or it will be worse for
  you."</p>

  <p>"Doan't hurry a man so, squire; pray ye, now, doan't. I be only out o'
  breath, and the lads they be safe enough by this time; but I wanted for you
  to speak up for me to the master, squire. I bain't a morsel to blame. I went
  a-purpose to see as the young gents didn't get into no mischief; I did,
  indeed. I be an old man now, and it's a long walk for me at my years," whined
  the old rascal, who was over at the Manor three nights a week when he thought
  the keepers were out of the way. "And the dog, he was most to blame, arter
  all; but the keepers they've got the young gents safe, enough,&mdash;and
  that's all about it." So saying, he stood bolt upright, like a man who has
  fired his last shot, and is ready to abide the worst. Truth to tell, the
  "King of Naples" was horribly afraid of Ropsley.</p>

  <p>The latter thought for a moment, put his hand in his pocket, and gave the
  poacher half-a-crown. "You hold your tongue," said he, "or you'll get into
  worse trouble than any of them. Now go home, and don't let me hear of your
  stirring out for twenty-four hours. Be off! Do you hear?"</p>

  <p>Old "Nap" obeyed, and hobbled off to his cottage, there to spend the term
  of his enforced residence in his favourite occupation of drinking, whilst
  Ropsley walked rapidly on to the village, and directed his steps to that
  well-known inn, "The Greyhound," of which every boy at Everdon School was
  more or less a patron.</p>

  <p>In ten minutes' time there was much ringing of bells and general confusion
  pervading that establishment; the curly-headed waiter (why do all waiters
  have curly hair?) rushed to and fro with a glass-cloth in his hand; the
  barmaid drooped her long ringlets over her own window-sill, within which she
  was to be seen at all hours of the day and night, like a pretty picture in
  its frame; the lame ostler stumped about with an activity foreign to his
  usual methodical nature, and a chaise and pair was ordered to be got ready
  immediately for Beverley Manor.</p>

  <p>Richard the Third is said to have been born with all his double teeth
  sharp set, and in good masticatory order. It is my firm belief that Ropsley
  was also ushered into the world with his wisdom teeth in a state of maturity.
  He had, indeed, an old head upon young shoulders; and yet this lad was
  brought up and educated by his mother until he was sent to school. Perhaps he
  was launched into the world too early; perhaps his recollections of home were
  not vivid enough to soften his character or awaken his feelings. When I first
  knew him he had been an orphan for years; but I am bound to say that the only
  being of whom he spoke with reverence was his mother. I never heard him
  mention her name but twice, and each time a soft light stole over his
  countenance and altered the whole expression of his features, till I could
  hardly believe it was the same person. From home, when a very little boy, he
  was sent to Eton; and after a long process of hardening in that mimic world,
  was transferred to Everdon, more as a private pupil than a scholar. Here it
  was that I first knew him; and great as was my boyish admiration for the
  haughty, aristocratic youth just verging upon manhood, it is no wonder that I
  watched and studied his character with an intensity born of my own ardent
  disposition, the enthusiasm of which was all the stronger for having been so
  repressed and concealed in my strange and solitary childhood. Most children
  are hero-worshippers, and my hero for the time was Ropsley.</p>

  <p>He was, I think, the only instance I can recollect of a mere boy proposing
  to himself a certain aim and end in life, and going steadily forward to its
  attainment without pause or deviation. I often think now, what is there that
  a man with ordinary faculties might not attain, would he but propose to
  himself at fourteen that position which he would wish to reach at forty? Show
  me the hill that six-and-twenty years of perseverance would fail to climb.
  But no; the boy never thinks of it at all&mdash;or if he does, he believes
  the man of forty to be verging on his grave, and too old to enjoy any of the
  pleasures of existence, should he have the means of indulging them. He will
  not think so when he has reached that venerable period; though, after all,
  age is a relative term, and too often totally irrespective of years. Many a
  heart is ruined and worn out long ere the form be bent or the head grown
  grey. But the boy thinks there is time enough; the youth grudges all that
  interferes with his pleasures; and the man only finds the value of energy and
  perseverance when it is too late to avail himself of them. Oh!
  opportunity!&mdash;opportunity!&mdash;phantom goddess of success, that not
  one in a million has decision to seize and make his own:&mdash;if hell be
  paved with good intentions, it might be roofed with lost opportunities.</p>

  <p>Ropsley, however, was no morbid whiner over that which is irretrievable.
  He never lost a chance by his own carelessness; and if he failed, as all must
  often fail, he never looked back. <i>Aide-toi, et Dieu t'aidera</i>, is a
  motto that comprises in five words the noblest code of philosophy; the first
  part of the sentence Ropsley had certainly adopted for his guidance, and to
  do him justice, he never was remiss in any sense of the word in helping
  himself.</p>

  <p>Poor, though of good family, his object was to attain a high position in
  the social world, power, wealth, and influence, especially the latter, but
  each and all as a means towards self-aggrandisement. The motive might not be
  amiable or noble, but it was better than none at all, and he followed it out
  most energetically. For this object he spared no pains, he feared no
  self-denial, he grudged no sacrifice. He was a scholar, and he meant to make
  the most of his scholarship, just as he made the most of his cricket-playing,
  his riding, his skill in all sports and exercises. He knew that his physical
  good looks and capabilities would be of service to him hereafter, and he
  cultivated them just as he stored and cultivated that intellect which he
  valued not for itself, but as a means to an end.</p>

  <p>"If I had fifty thousand a year," I once heard him say to Manners, "I
  should take no trouble about anything. Depend upon it, the real thing to live
  for is enjoyment. But if I had only forty-five thousand I should work like a
  slave&mdash;it would not <i>quite</i> give me the position I require."</p>

  <p>Such was Ropsley at this earliest period of our acquaintance.</p>

  <p>"Drive to Beverley Manor," said he, as he made himself thoroughly
  comfortable amongst the cushions, let down all the windows, and settled
  himself to the perusal of the last daily paper.</p>

  <p>Any other boy in the school would have gone in a gig.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X. &mdash; BEVERLEY MANOR</h2>

  <p class="first">Why does a country gentleman invariably select the worst
  room in the house for his own private apartment, in which he transacts what
  he is pleased to call his "business," and spends the greater part of his
  time? At Beverley Manor there were plenty of rooms, cheerful, airy, and
  well-proportioned, in which it would have been a pleasure to live, but none
  of these were chosen by Sir Harry for his own; disregarding the charms of the
  saloon, the drawing-room, the morning-room, the billiard-room, and the hall
  itself, which, with a huge fire-place and a thick carpet, was by no means the
  least comfortable part of the house,&mdash;he had retired to a small,
  ill-contrived, queer-shaped apartment, dark, dusty, and uncomfortable, of
  which the only recommendation was that it communicated directly with a
  back-staircase and offices, and did not require in its own untidiness any
  apology on the part of muddy visitors, who had not thought of wiping their
  boots and shoes as they came up. A large glass gun-case, filled with
  double-barrels, occupied one side of the room, flanked by book-shelves,
  loaded with such useful but not entertaining works as the <i>Racing
  Calendar</i>, <i>White's Farriery</i>, and <i>Hawker's Instructions to Young
  Sportsmen</i>. In one corner was a whip-stand, hung round with many an
  instrument of torture. The knotted dog-whip that reduced Ponto to reason in
  the golden stubbles; the long-thonged hunting-whip, that brought to mind at
  once the deep, fragrant woodland in November, with its scarlet coats flitting
  down the distant ride; and the straight, punishing "cut-and-thrust," that
  told of Derby and St. Leger, Ditch-In, Middle-Mile, and all the struggles of
  Epsom and Newmarket. In another was an instrument for measuring land, and a
  roll of plans by which acres were to be calculated and a system of thorough
  draining established, with a view to golden profits.</p>

  <p>"Draining!" remarked Sir Harry, in his younger days, to an assemblage of
  country gentlemen, who stood aghast at the temerity of his proposition, "I am
  no advocate for draining:"&mdash;voices were raised, and hands uplifted in
  pious horror and deprecation&mdash;"all I can say is, gentlemen, that I have
  drained my property till <i>I cannot get a farthing from it</i>" was Sir
  Harry's conclusive reasoning, which must have satisfied Mr. Mechi
  himself.</p>

  <p>A coloured engraving of the well-known Beverley shorthorn "Dandy" hung on
  one side of the fire-place, and on the other, a print of "Flying Childers,"
  as he appeared when going at the rate of a mile in a minute, apparently
  ridden by a highwayman in huge jack-boots and a flowing periwig. In the
  centre of the room was fixed a large leather-covered writing-table, and at
  this table sat Sir Harry himself, prepared to administer justice and punish
  all offenders. He was a tall, thin man, somewhat bent, and bald, with a
  hooked nose, and a bright, searching eye, evidently a thorough man of the
  world in thought, opinion, and feeling; the artificial will become second
  nature if long enough persisted in, and Sir Harry had served no short
  apprenticeship to the trade of fashion. His dress was peculiarly neat and
  gentleman-like, not the least what is now termed "slang," and yet with a
  something in it that marked the horseman. He was busy writing when we were
  ushered into the awful presence, and Victor and I had time to steal a look at
  each other, and to exchange a reassuring pressure of the hand. The young
  Hungarian raised his head frank and fearless as usual; I felt that I should
  like to sink into the ground, but yet was determined to stand by my
  friend.</p>

  <p>Mr. Barrells commenced a long oration, in which he was rapidly losing
  himself, when his master, whose attention was evidently occupied elsewhere,
  suddenly looked up, and cut him short with the pertinent inquiry&mdash;</p>

  <p>"What's all this about, Barrells? and why are these lads here?"</p>

  <p>"We are gentlemen, and not poachers;" and "Indeed, sir, it was Bold that
  got away!" exclaimed Victor and I simultaneously.</p>

  <p>At this instant a card was brought in by the butler, and placed in Sir
  Harry's hand; he looked at it for a moment, and then said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Immediate! very well, show the gentleman in."</p>

  <p>I thought I knew the step that came along the passage, but never was
  failing courage more grateful for assistance than was mine to recognise in
  Sir Harry's visitor the familiar person of my schoolfellow, Ropsley; I cared
  not a farthing for the promised licking now.</p>

  <p>"I have to apologise for disturbing you, Sir Harry," said he, standing as
  composed and collected as if he were in our schoolroom at Everdon;&mdash;even
  in the anxiety of the moment I remember thinking, "What would I give to
  possess 'manner' such as his;"&mdash;"I have to apologise for my rudeness"
  (Sir Harry bowed, and said, "Not at all;" I wondered what he meant by
  <i>that</i>), "but I am sure you will excuse me when I tell you that I am a
  pupil of Mr. March's at Everdon" (Sir Harry looked at the tall, well-dressed
  figure before him, and seemed surprised), "and these two young friends of
  mine belong to the same establishment. I heard quite accidentally, only an
  hour ago, of the scrape they had got into, and I immediately hurried over
  here to assure you that they can have had no evil intentions in trespassing
  on your property, and to apologise for their thoughtlessness, partly out of
  respect to you, Sir Harry, and partly, I am bound to say, for the credit of
  the school. I am quite sure that neither Egerton nor De Rohan&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sir Harry started. "Egerton! De Rohan!" he exclaimed; "not the son of my
  old friend Philip Egerton, not young Count de Rohan?&mdash;really,
  Mr.&mdash;" (he looked at the card he held in his hand), "really, Mr.
  Ropsley, I am very much obliged to you for rectifying this extraordinary
  mistake;" but even whilst he was speaking, I had run round the table to where
  he sat, and seizing his hand&mdash;I remember how cold it felt between my own
  little hot, trembling ones&mdash;exclaimed&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Oh! do you know my papa? then I am sure you will not punish us; only let
  us off this time, and give me back Bold, and we will promise never to come
  here again."</p>

  <p>The Baronet was not a demonstrative person, nor had he much patience with
  those who were; he pushed me from him, I thought rather coldly, and addressed
  himself once more to Ropsley.</p>

  <p>"Why, these boys are sons of two of the oldest friends I have in the
  world. I would not have had such a thing happen for a thousand pounds. I must
  apologise to you, young gentlemen, for the rudeness of my servants&mdash;Good
  heavens! ou were kept waiting in the hall: why on earth did you not give your
  names? Your father and I were at college together, Egerton; and as for you,
  Monsieur le Comte, had I known you were at Everdon, I would have made a point
  of going over to call upon you myself; but I have only just returned to the
  country, and that must be my excuse."</p>

  <p>Victor bowed gracefully: notwithstanding his torn jacket and disordered
  collar, he looked "the young Count" all over, and so I am sure thought Sir
  Harry. Ropsley was perfectly <i>gentlemanlike</i>, but Victor was naturally
  <i>high bred</i>.</p>

  <p>"Barrells, where are you going, Barrells?" resumed his master, for that
  discreet person, seeing the turn things were taking, was quietly leaving the
  room; "you always were the greatest fool that ever stood upon two legs: now
  let this be a warning to you&mdash;every vagabond in the county helps himself
  to my game whenever he pleases, and you never lay a finger on one of them; at
  last you insult and abuse two young gentlemen that any one but a born idiot
  could see were gentlemen, and bring them in here for
  poachers&mdash;<i>poachers!</i> as if you didn't know a poacher when you see
  one. Don't stand gaping there, you fool, but be off, and the other blockhead
  too. Hie! here; let the dog be attended to, and one of the watchers must lead
  him back to Everdon when he's well again. Now see to that, and never make
  such a stupid mistake again."</p>

  <p>"May I go and see Bold, sir?" said I, summoning up courage as my late
  captors quitted the room.</p>

  <p>"Quite right, my little man," replied the Baronet, "so you shall, this
  evening; but in the meantime, I hope you'll all stay and dine with me. I'll
  write to your master&mdash;what's his name?&mdash;and send you back in the
  carriage at night; what say you, Mr. Ropsley? I can give you a capital bottle
  of claret."</p>

  <p>So here were we, who one short hour before had been making up our minds to
  endure with fortitude the worst that could happen,&mdash;who had expected to
  be driven with ignominy from Beverley, and handed over to condign punishment
  on our return to school, if indeed we were fortunate enough to escape
  committal and imprisonment in the County Gaol,&mdash;now installed as
  honoured guests in the very mansion which we had so long looked upon as a
  <i>terra incognita</i> of fairyland, free to visit the "hins-and-houts" of
  Beverley, with no thanks to the "King of Naples" for his assistance, and, in
  short, raised at one step from the abyss of schoolboy despair to the height
  of schoolboy gratification. Victor's delight was even greater than mine as we
  were shown into a pretty little dressing-room overlooking the garden, to wash
  our hands before dinner. He said it reminded him of home, and made him feel
  "like a gentleman" once more.</p>

  <p>What a dinner that was to which we sat down in the stately old
  dining-room, served upon massive plate by a butler and two footmen, whose
  magnificence made me feel quite shy in my comparative insignificance. Ropsley
  of course seemed as much at home as if he was in the habit of dining there
  every day, and Victor munched away with an appetite that seemed to afford our
  good-natured host immense gratification. Soup and fish,
<i>entr&eacute;es</i> of
  every description, hashed venison, iced champagne&mdash;how grateful after
  our hot pursuit in the summer sun&mdash;and all the minor luxuries of silver
  forks, clean napkins, finger-glasses, etc., were indeed a contrast to the
  plain roast mutton and potatoes, the two-pronged fork, and washy table-beer
  of our Everdon bill-of-fare. What I liked, though, better than all the
  eatables and drinkables, was a picture opposite which I sat, and which
  riveted my attention so much as to attract the observation of Sir Harry
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Ha! Egerton," said he, "you are your father all over, I see. Just like
  him, wild about painting. Now I'll bet my life you're finding fault with the
  colouring of that picture. The last time he was here he vowed, if I would let
  him, he would paint it all over again; and yet it's one of the best pictures
  in England at this moment. What do you think of it, my boy? Could you paint
  as good a one?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," I replied modestly, and rather annoyed at my reverie being
  interrupted; "my father tries to teach me, but&mdash;but I cannot learn to
  paint."</p>

  <p>Sir Harry turned away, and Ropsley whispered something about "very
  odd"&mdash;"poor little fellow." The dessert had just been put on the table,
  and Victor was busy with his strawberries and cream. There must be some truth
  in magnetism, there must be something in the doctrine of attraction and
  repulsion: why do we like some people as we dislike others, without any
  shadow of a reason? Homoeopathists tell us that the nausea which contracts
  our features at the smell of a drug, is a provision of Nature to guard us
  against poison. Can it be that these antipathies are implanted in our being
  to warn us of those who shall hereafter prove our enemies? it is not a
  charitable theory nor a Christian-like, and yet in my experience of life I
  have found many instances in which it has borne a strange semblance of
  truth.</p>

  <p class="verse">"Men feel by instinct swift as light<br>
  The presence of the foe,<br>
  Whom God has marked in after years<br>
  To strike the mortal blow.<br>
  The other, though his brand be sheathed,<br>
  At banquet or in hall,<br>
  Hath a forebodement of the time<br>
  When one or both must fall."</p><br>

  <p>So sings "the minstrel" in his poem of <i>Bothwell</i>, but
  <i>Bothwell</i>was not written at the time of which I speak, and the only
  poetry I had ever heard to justify my antipathies was the homely quatrain of
  <i>Dr. Fell</i>. Still I felt somehow from that moment I hated Ropsley; it
  was absurd, it was ungrateful, it was ungentlemanlike, but it was
  undeniable.</p>

  <p>So I buried myself in the contemplation of the picture, which possessed
  for me a strange fascination. The subject was Queen Dido transfixed on her
  funeral pyre, the very <i>infandum regina</i> to whose history I owed so many
  school-room sorrows. I began to think I should never hate Virgil again. The
  whole treatment of the picture was to the last degree unnatural, and the
  colouring, even to my inexperienced eye, faulty and overdone. Yet that face
  of mute sorrow and resignation spoke at once to the heart; the Queen lay
  gazing on the distant galleys which were bearing away her love, and curling
  their beaks and curvetting, so to speak, up-hill on a green sea, in a manner
  that must have made the task of Palinurus no easy one when he undertook to
  steer the same. Her limbs were disposed stiffly, but not ungracefully, on the
  fatal couch, and her white bosom was pierced by the deadly blade. Yet on her
  sweet, sad countenance the artist had depicted with wonderful skill the
  triumph of mental over bodily anguish; and though the features retained all
  woman's softness and woman's beauty, you read the breaking heart beneath. I
  could have looked at that picture for hours, I was lost in it even then, but
  the door opened, and whilst Ropsley got up with a flourish and his most
  respectful bow, in walked the young lady whom we had met under far different
  circumstances some three hours before in the shrubbery, and quietly took her
  place by the side of her papa.</p>

  <p>As I looked from Queen Dido to Miss Constance I quite started; there was
  the very face as if it had walked out of the canvas. Younger, certainly, and
  with a more childish expression about the mouth, but the same queenly brow,
  the same sad, serious eyes, the same delicate features and oval shape; the
  fascination was gone from the picture now, and yet as I looked at the
  child&mdash;for child she was then&mdash;I experienced once more the old
  well-known pang of self-humiliation which so often poisoned my happiness; I
  felt so dull and awkward amongst these bright faces and polished manners, so
  ungainly and out of place where others were gay and at their ease. How I
  envied Victor's self-possession as he addressed the young lady with his
  pleasant, foreign accent, and a certain assurance that an English boy never
  acquires till he is verging on manhood. How willingly would I have exchanged
  places with any one of the party. How I longed to cast the outward slough of
  timidity and constraint, to appear as I felt myself in reality, an equal in
  mind and station and feelings to the rest. For the first time in my life, as
  I sat a mere child at that dinner-table, came the thrilling, maddening
  feeling to my heart&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Oh! that something would happen, something dreadful, something unheard
  of, that should strip from each of us all extraneous and artificial
  advantages, that should give us all a fair start on equal
  terms&mdash;something that should try our courage or our fortitude, and
  enable me to prove myself what I really am."</p>

  <p>It was the first spark of ambition that ever entered my boyish breast, but
  when once kindled, such sparks are never completely extinguished. Fortunate
  is it that opportunities are wanting to fan them into a flame, or we should
  ere long have the world in a blaze.</p>

  <p>Miss Constance took very little notice of us beyond a cold allusion to the
  well-being of my dog, and it was not till Sir Harry bade her take charge of
  Victor and myself, and lead us out through the garden to visit our wounded
  favourite, that we had any conversation with this reserved young lady. Sir
  Harry rang for another bottle of claret, and composed himself for a good chat
  upon racing matters with Ropsley, who was as much at home with everything
  connected with the turf as if he spent his whole time at Newmarket. Ropsley
  had even then a peculiar knack of being "all things to all men," and pleaded
  guilty besides to a very strong <i>penchant</i> for horse-racing. This latter
  taste raised him considerably in Sir Harry's estimation, who, like the rest
  of mankind, took great pleasure in beckoning the young along that path of
  pleasure which had nearly led to his own ruin. Well, we are all children to
  the last; was there one whit more wisdom in the conversation of the Baronet
  and his guest as to the relative merits of certain three-year-olds and the
  weight they could carry, than in the simple questions and answers of us three
  children, walking soberly along the soft garden sward in the blushing sunset?
  At first we were very decorous: no brocaded courtier of Queen Anne, leading
  his partner out to dance a minuet, could have been more polite and respectful
  than Victor; no dame of high degree, in hoop and stomacher, more stately and
  reserved than Miss Constance. I said little, but watched the pair with a
  strange, uncomfortable fascination. Ere long, however, the ice began to thaw,
  questions as to Christian names, and ages, and respective birthdays, brought
  on increased confidence and more familiar conversation. Constance showed us
  her doves, and was delighted to find that we too understood thoroughly the
  management of these soft-eyed favourites; the visit to Bold was another
  strong link in our dawning friendship; the little girl was so gentle and so
  pitiful, so caressing to the poor dog, and so sympathising with its master,
  that I could not but respond to her kindness, and overcame my timidity
  sufficiently to thank her warmly for the interest she took in poor Bold. By
  the time we had all enjoyed in turn the delights of a certain swing, and
  played a game at battledore and shuttlecock in the echoing hall, we were
  becoming fast friends, and had succeeded in interesting our new acquaintance
  extremely in all the details of schoolboy life, and our own sufferings at
  Everdon. I remarked, however, that Constance took far less notice of me than
  of Victor; with him she seemed frank and merry and at her ease; with me, on
  the contrary, she retained much of her early reserve, and I could not help
  fancying, rather avoided my conversation than otherwise. Well, I was used to
  being thrown in the background, and it was pleasure enough for me to watch
  that grave, earnest countenance, and speculate on the superhuman beauty of
  Queen Dido, to which it bore so strange a resemblance.</p>

  <p>It was getting too dark to continue our game. We had already lost the
  shuttlecock three times, and it was now hopelessly perched on the frame of an
  old picture in the hall; when the dining-room door opened, and Sir Harry came
  out, still conversing earnestly with his guest on the one engrossing
  topic.</p>

  <p>"I am much obliged to you for the hint," said the Baronet. "It never
  struck me before; and if your information is really to be depended on, I
  shall certainly back him. Strange that I should not have heard of the
  trial."</p>

  <p>"My man dare not deceive me, I assure you," answered Ropsley, his quiet,
  distinct tones contrasting with Sir Harry's, who was a little flushed and
  voluble after his claret. "He used to do odd jobs for me when I was in the
  sixth form at Eton, and I met him unexpectedly enough the other day in the
  High-street at Bath. He is a mason by trade, and is employed repairing
  Beckford's tower; by the way, he had heard of <i>Vathek</i>&mdash;I am not
  sure that he hasn't read it, so the fellow has some brains about him. Well, I
  knew he hadn't been hanging about Ascot all his life for nothing, so I
  described the colt to him, and bade him keep his eyes open when perched in
  mid-air these bright mornings, with such a command of Lansdowne. Why, he knew
  the horse as well as I did, and yesterday sent me a full account of the
  trial. I destroyed it immediately, of course, but I have it all here"
  (pointing to his forehead, where, indeed, Ropsley carried a curious
  miscellany of information). "He beat the mare at least fifty yards, and she
  was nearly that distance ahead of 'Slap-Jack,' so you may depend upon it he
  is a real flyer. I have backed him to win a large stake, at least, for a boy
  like me," added Ropsley, modestly; "and I do not mean to hedge a farthing of
  it."</p>

  <p>Sir Harry was delighted; he had found a "young one," as he called it,
  after his own heart; he declared he would not wish him "good-bye"; he must
  come over again and see the yearlings; he must accompany him to the Bath
  races. If he was to leave Everdon at the end of the half-year, he must come
  and shoot in September; nay, they would go to Doncaster together; in short,
  Sir Harry was fascinated, and put us all into the carriage, which he had
  ordered expressly to take us back to Everdon, with many expressions of
  hospitality and good-will.</p>

  <p>Bold was lifted on to the box, from whence he looked down with his tongue
  hanging out in a state of ludicrous helplessness and dismay. Miss Constance
  bade us a quiet "good-night" in tones so sweet that they rang in my ears half
  the way home, and so we drove off in state from the front door, as though we
  had not that very afternoon been brought in as culprits at the back.</p>

  <p>Ropsley was unusually silent during the whole journey. He had established
  his footing at Beverley Manor, perhaps he was thinking how "to make the most
  of it."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI. &mdash; DULCE DOMUM</h2>

  <p class="first">I must skip a few years; long years they were then to me; as
  I look back upon them now, they seem to have fleeted away like a dream.
  Victor and I are still at Everdon, but we are now the two senior boys in the
  school. De Rohan has grown into one of the handsomest youths you will often
  see. His blue eye is as clear and merry as ever, but the chestnut curls have
  turned dark and glossy, and the light, agile form is rapidly developing
  itself into a strong, symmetrical young man. He is still frank, gay, and
  unsophisticated; quick enough at his studies, but utterly without
  perseverance, and longing ardently for the time when he shall be free to
  embark upon a course of pleasure and dissipation. I am much altered too. With
  increasing growth and the assumption of the <i>toga virilis</i>, or that
  manly garment which schoolboys abruptly denominate "tails," I have acquired a
  certain degree of outward equanimity and self-command, but still suffer much
  from inward misgivings as to my own appearance and personal advantages.
  Hopelessly I consult the glass in our joint bed-room&mdash;the same glass
  that daily reflects Victor's handsome face and graceful figure&mdash;and am
  forced unwillingly to confess that it presents to me the image of a swarthy,
  coarse-featured lad, with sunken eyes and scowling eyebrows, sallow in
  complexion, with a wide, low forehead overhung by a profusion of bushy black
  hair; this unprepossessing countenance surmounting a short square figure,
  broad-shouldered, deep-chested, and possessed of great physical strength.
  Yes, I was proud of my strength. I shall never forget the day when first I
  discovered that nature had gifted me with one personal advantage, that I, of
  all others, was disposed most to appreciate. A lever had been left in the
  playground, by which the workmen, who were repairing the wall, intended to
  lift the stem of the well-known tree which had formerly constituted what we
  called "The Club." We boys had come out of school whilst the men were gone to
  dinner. Manners, the muscular, was delighted with such an opportunity of
  displaying his prowess; how foolish he looked when he found himself incapable
  of moving the huge inert mass&mdash;he said it was impossible; two boys
  attempted it, then three, still the great trunk remained motionless. I asked
  leave to try, amidst the jeers of all, for I was usually so quiet and
  undemonstrative that no one believed Egerton had, in schoolboy parlance,
  either "pith or pluck" in him. I laid my weight to it and heaved "with a
  will"; the great block of timber vibrated, moved, and rolled along the sward.
  What a triumph it was, and how I prided myself on it. I, too, had my ideal of
  what I should like to be, although I would not have confessed it to a soul. I
  wished to be like some <i>preux chevalier</i> of the olden time; my childish
  longing to be loved had merged into an ardent desire to be admired; I would
  have been brave and courteous and chivalrous and strong. Yes, in all the
  characters of the olden time that I so loved to study, strength was described
  as one of the first attributes of a hero. Sir Tristram, Sir Launcelot, Sir
  Bevis, were all "strong," and my heart leapt to think that if the opportunity
  ever arrived, my personal strength might give me a chance of distinguishing
  myself, when the beautiful and the gallant were helpless and overcome. But
  there was another qualification of which in my secret soul I had hideous
  misgivings,&mdash;I doubted my own courage: I knew I was nervous and timid in
  the common every-day pursuits of a schoolboy's life; I could not venture on a
  strange horse without feeling my heart in my mouth; I did not dare stop a
  ball that was bowled swiftly in to my wicket, nor fire a gun without shutting
  both eyes before I ventured to pull the trigger. What if I should be a coward
  after all? A <i>coward!</i> the thoughts of it almost drove me mad; and yet
  how could I tell but that I was branded with that hideous curse? I longed,
  yet dreaded, to know the worst.</p>

  <p>In my studies I was unusually backward for a boy of my age. Virgil, thanks
  to the picture of Dido, never to be forgotten, I had completely mastered; but
  mathematics, arithmetic&mdash;all that are termed the exact sciences&mdash;I
  appeared totally incapable of learning. Languages I picked up with
  extraordinary facility, and this alone redeemed me from the character of an
  irreclaimable dunce.</p>

  <p>"You <i>can</i> learn, sir, if you will," was March's constant remark,
  after I had arrived at the exalted position of a senior boy, to whom flogging
  and such coercive measures were inappropriate, and for whom "out of bounds"
  was not. "You <i>can</i> learn, or else why do I see you poring over Arabic
  and Sanscrit during play-hours, when you had much better be at cricket? You
  must have brains somewhere, but to save my life I can't find them. You can
  speak half-a-dozen languages, as I am informed, nearly as well as I can speak
  Latin, and yet if I set you to do a 'Rule of Three' sum, you make more
  blunders than the lowest little dunce in the school! Egerton, I can't make
  you out."</p>

  <p>It was breaking-up day at Everdon. Victor and I walked with our arms over
  each other's shoulders, up and down, up and down, in the old playground, and
  as we paced those well-worn flags, of which we knew every stone, my heart
  sank within me to think it was for the last, <i>last</i> time. What is there
  that we are not sorry to do for the last time? I had hated school as much as
  any schoolboy could; I had looked forward to my emancipation as the captive
  looks forward to the opening of his prison-door; and now the time was come,
  and I felt grieved and out of spirits to think that I should see the old
  place no more.</p>

  <p>"You must write to me constantly, Vere," said Victor, with an affectionate
  hug, as we took our hundredth turn. "We must never forget each other, however
  far apart, and next winter you must come again to Edeldorf; I shall be there
  when the shooting begins. Oh, Vere, you will be very dull at home."</p>

  <p>"No," I replied; "I like Alton Grange, and I like a quiet life. I am not
  of your way of thinking, Victor; you are never happy except in a bustle; I
  wish I were more like you;" and I sighed as I thought of the contrast between
  us.</p>

  <p>I do not know what brought it to my mind, but I thought of Constance
  Beverley, and the first time we saw her when we were all children together at
  Beverley Manor. Since then our acquaintance had indeed progressed but little;
  we scarcely ever met except on certain Sundays, when we took advantage of our
  liberty as senior boys to go to church at Fleetsbury, where from the gallery
  we could see right into the Beverley pew, and mark the change time had
  wrought on our former playfellow. After service, at the door we might perhaps
  exchange a stiff greeting and a few words before she and her governess got
  into the carriage; and this transcendent pleasure we were content to purchase
  with a broiling walk of some five miles on a dusty high-road, and a patient
  endurance of the longest sermon from the worthy rector of Fleetsbury, an
  excellent man, skilled in casuistry, and gifted with extraordinary powers of
  discourse. Victor, I think, took these expeditions in his own good-natured
  way, and seemed to care but little whether he went or not. One hot Sunday, I
  recollect he suggested that we should dispense with afternoon church
  altogether, and go to bathe instead, a proposal I scouted with the utmost
  indignation, for I looked forward to our meetings with a passionate longing
  for which I could not account even to myself, and which I never for an
  instant dreamed of attributing to the charms of Miss Beverley. I know not now
  what tempted me to ask the question, but I felt myself becoming bright
  scarlet as I inquired of my school-fellow whether he had not
  <i>other</i>friends in Somersetshire besides myself whom he would regret
  leaving. His reply ought to have set my mind at ease, if I was disturbed at
  the suspicion of his entertaining any <i>penchant</i> for Miss Beverley, for
  he answered at once in his own off-hand way&mdash;"None whatever that I care
  a sixpence about, not even that prim little girl and her governess, whom you
  drag me five miles every Sunday to see. No, Vere, if I could take you with
  me, I should sing for joy the whole way from here to London. As it is, I
  shall not break my heart: I am so glad to get away from this dull, dreadful
  place."</p>

  <p>Then he did not care for Miss Beverley, after all. Well, and what
  difference could that possibly make to me? Certainly, I was likely to see her
  pretty constantly in the next year or two, as our respective abodes would be
  but a short distance apart; but what of that? There could be nothing in
  common between the high-born, haughty young lady, and her awkward, repulsive
  neighbour. Yet I was glad, too, that Victor did not care for her. All my old
  affection for him came back with a gush, and I wrung his hand, and cried like
  a fool to think we were so soon to be parted, perhaps for years. The other
  boys were singing <i>Dulce domum</i> in the schoolroom, hands joined, dancing
  round and round, and stamping wildly with the chorus, like so many
  Bacchanals; they had no regrets, no misgivings; they were not going to leave
  for <i>good</i>. Even Manners looked forward to his temporary release with
  bright anticipations of amusement. He was to spend the vacation with a
  clerical cousin in Devonshire, the cousin of whom we all knew so much by
  report, and who, indeed, to judge by his relative's account, must have been
  an individual of extraordinary talents and attainments. The usher approached
  us with an expression of mingled pleasure and pain on his good-looking,
  vacant countenance. He had nearly finished packing his things, and was now
  knocking the dust out of those old green slippers I remembered when first I
  came to Everdon. He was a good-hearted fellow, and was sorry to lose his two
  old friends.</p>

  <p>"We shall miss you both very much next half," said he; "nothing but little
  boys here now. Everdon is not what it used to be. Dear me, we never have such
  a pupil as Ropsley now. When you two are gone there will be no one left for
  me to associate with: this is not a place for a man of energy, for a man that
  feels he is a man," added Manners, doubling his arm, and feeling if the
  biceps was still in its right place. "Here am I now, with a muscular frame, a
  good constitution, a spirit of adventure, and a military figure" (appealing
  to me, for Victor, as usual, was beginning to laugh), "and what chances have
  I of using my advantages in this circumscribed sphere of action? I might as
  well be a weak, puny stripling, without an atom of nerve, or manliness, or
  energy, for all the good I am likely to do here. I must cut it, Egerton; I
  must find a career; I am too good for an usher&mdash;an usher," he repeated,
  with a strong expression of disgust; "I, who feel fit to fight my way
  anywhere&mdash;I have mistaken my profession&mdash;I ought to have been an
  officer&mdash;a cavalry officer; that would have suited me better than this
  dull, insipid life. I must consult my cousin about it; perhaps we shall meet
  again in some very different scenes. What say you, De Rohan, should you not
  be surprised to see me at the head of a regiment?"</p>

  <p>Victor could conceal his mirth no longer, and Manners turned somewhat
  angrily to me. "You seem to be very happy as you are," I answered, sadly, for
  I was contrasting his well-grown, upright figure and simple fresh-coloured
  face, with my own repulsive exterior, and thinking how willingly I would
  change places with him, although he <i>was</i> an usher; "but wherever we
  meet, I am sure <i>I</i> shall be glad to see you again." In my own heart I
  thought Manners was pretty certain to be at Everdon if I should revisit it
  that day ten years, as I was used to these visionary schemes of his for the
  future, and had heard him talk in the same strain every vacation regularly
  since I first came to school.</p>

  <p>But there was little time now for such speculations. The chaises were
  driving round to the door to take the boys away. March bid us an affectionate
  farewell in his study. Victor and I were presented respectively with a
  richly-bound copy of <i>Horatius Flaccus</i> and <i>Virgilius
  Maro</i>&mdash;copies which, I fear, in after life, were never soiled by too
  much use. The last farewell was spoken&mdash;the last pressure of the hand
  exchanged&mdash;and we drove off on our different destinations; my friend
  bound for London, Paris, and his beloved Hungary; myself, longing to see my
  father once more, and taste the seclusion and repose of Alton Grange. To no
  boy on earth could a school-life have been more distasteful than to me; no
  boy could have longed more ardently for the peaceful calm of a domestic
  hearth, and yet I felt lonely and out of spirits even now, when I was going
  home.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII. &mdash; ALTON GRANGE</h2>

  <p class="first">A dreary old place was Alton Grange, and one which would
  have had a sobering, not to say saddening, effect, even on the most mercurial
  temperament. To one naturally of a melancholy turn of mind, its aspect was
  positively dispiriting. Outside the house the grounds were overgrown with
  plantations and shrubberies, unthinned, and luxuriating into a wilderness
  that was not devoid of beauty, but it was a beauty of a sombre and
  uncomfortable character. Every tree and shrub of the darkest hues, seemed to
  shut out the sunlight from Alton Grange. Huge cedars overshadowed the slope
  behind the house; hollies, junipers, and yew hedges kept the garden in
  perpetual night. Old-fashioned terraces, that should have been kept in
  perfect repair, were sliding into decay with mouldering walls and unpropped
  banks, whilst a broken stone sun-dial, where sun never shone, served but to
  attract attention to the general dilapidation around.</p>

  <p>It was not the old family place of the Egertons. That was in a northern
  county, and had been sold by my father in his days of wild extravagance, long
  ago; but he had succeeded to it in right of his mother, at a time when he had
  resolved, if possible, to save some remnant from the wreck of his property,
  and, when in England, he had resided here ever since. To me it was home, and
  dearly I loved it, with all its dulness and all its decay. The inside
  corresponded with the exterior. Dark passages, black wainscotings, everywhere
  the absence of light; small as were the windows, they were overhung with
  creepers, and the walls were covered with ivy; damp in winter, darkness in
  summer, were the distinguishing qualities of the old house. Of furniture
  there was but a scanty supply, and that of the most old-fashioned
  description: high-backed chairs of carved oak, black leathern
  <i>fauteuils</i>, chimney-pieces that the tallest housemaid could never reach
  to dust, would have impressed on a stranger ideas of anything but comfort,
  whilst the decorations were confined to two or three hideous old pictures,
  representing impossible sufferings of certain fabulous martyrs; and one or
  two sketches of my father's, which had arrived at sufficient maturity to
  leave the painting-room, and adorn the every-day life of the
  establishment.</p>

  <p>The last-named apartment was cheerful enough: it was necessarily supplied
  with a sufficiency of daylight, and as my father made it his own peculiar
  den, and spent the greater part of his life in it, there were present many
  smaller comforts and luxuries which might have been sought elsewhere in the
  house in vain. But no room was ever comfortable yet without a woman. Men have
  no idea of order without formality, or abundance without untidiness. My
  father had accumulated in his own particular retreat a heterogeneous mass of
  articles which should have had their proper places appointed, and had no
  business mixed up with his colours, and easel, and brushes. Sticks, whips,
  cloaks, umbrellas, cigar-boxes, swords, and fire-arms were mingled with
  lay-figures, models, studies, and draperies, in a manner that would have
  driven an orderly person out of his senses; but my father never troubled his
  head about these matters, and when he came in from a walk or ride, would
  fling his hat down in one corner of the room, the end of his cigar in
  another, his cloak or whip in a third, and begin painting again with an
  avidity that seemed to grow fiercer from the enforced abstinence of a few
  hours in taking necessary exercise. My poor father! I often think if he had
  devoted less attention to his art, and more to the common every-day business
  of life, which no one may neglect with impunity, how much better he would
  have succeeded, both as a painter and a man.</p>

  <p>He was hard at work when I came home from school. I knew well where to
  find him, and hurried at once to the painting-room. He was seated at his
  easel, but as I entered he drew a screen across the canvas, and so hid his
  work from my inquiring gaze. I never knew him do so before; on the contrary,
  it had always seemed his greatest desire to instil into his son some of his
  own love for the art; but I had hardly time to think of this ere I was in his
  arms, looking up once more in the kind face, on which I never in my whole
  life remembered to have seen a harsh expression. He was altered, though, and
  thinner than when I had seen him last, and his hair was now quite grey, so
  that the contrast with his flashing dark eye&mdash;brighter it seemed to me
  than ever&mdash;was almost unearthly. His hands, too, were wasted, and whiter
  than they used to be, and the whole figure, which I remembered once a tower
  of strength, was now sunk and fallen in, particularly about the chest and
  shoulders. When he stood up, it struck me, also, that he was shorter than he
  used to be, and my heart tightened for a moment at the thought that, he might
  be even now embarking on that long journey from which there is no return. I
  remembered him such a tall, handsome, stalwart man, and now he seemed so
  shrunk and emaciated, and quite to totter and lean on me for support.</p>

  <p>"You are grown, my boy," said he, looking fondly at me; "you are getting
  quite a man now, Vere; it will be sadly dull for you at the Grange: but you
  must stay with your old father for a time&mdash;it will not be for
  long&mdash;not for long," he repeated, and his eye turned to the screened
  canvas, and a glance shot from it that I could hardly bear to see&mdash;so
  despairing, yet so longing&mdash;so wild, and yet so fond. I had never seen
  him look thus before, and it frightened me.</p>

  <p>Our quiet meal in the old oak parlour&mdash;our saunter after dinner
  through the dark walks and shrubberies&mdash;all was so like the olden time,
  that I felt quite a boy again. My father lighted up for a time into his
  former good spirits and amusing sallies, but I remarked that after every
  flash he sank into a deeper dejection, and I fancied the tears were in his
  eyes as he wished me good-night at the door of the painting-room. I little
  thought when I went to bed that it was now his habit to sit brooding there
  till the early dawn of morning, when he would retire for three or four hours
  to his rest.</p>

  <p>So the time passed away tranquilly and dully enough at Alton Grange. My
  father was ever absorbed in his painting, but studied now with the door
  locked, and even I was only admitted at stated times, when the mysterious
  canvas was invariably screened. My curiosity, nay more, my interest, was
  intensely excited; I longed, yet feared, to know what was the subject of this
  hidden picture; twenty times was I on the point of asking my father, but
  something in his manner gave me to understand that it was a prohibited
  subject, and I forbore. There was that in his bearing which at once checked
  curiosity on a subject he was unwilling to reveal, and few men would have
  dared to question my father where he did not himself choose to bestow his
  confidence.</p>

  <p>I read much in the old library; I took long walks once more by myself; I
  got back to my dreams of Launcelot and Guenever, and knights and dames, and
  "deeds of high emprize." More than ever I experienced the vague longing for
  something hitherto unknown, that had unconsciously been growing with my
  growth, and strengthening with my strength,&mdash;the restless craving of
  which I scarcely guessed the nature, but which weighed upon my nervous,
  sensitive temperament till it affected my very brain. Had I but known then
  the lesson that was to be branded on my heart in letters of fire,&mdash;could
  I but have foreseen the day when I should gnaw my fetters, and yet not wish
  to be free,&mdash;when all that was good, and noble, and kindly in my nature
  should turn to bitter self-contempt, and hopeless, helpless
  apathy,&mdash;when love, fiercer than hatred, should scorch and sting the
  coward that had not strength nor courage to bear his burden upright like a
  man,&mdash;had I but known all this, I had better have tied a millstone round
  my neck, and slept twenty feet deep below the mere at Beverley, than pawned
  away hope, and life, and energy, and manhood, for a glance of her dark eyes,
  a touch of her soft hand, from the heiress of Beverley Manor.</p>

  <p>Yes, Alton Grange was distant but a short walk from Beverley. Many a time
  I found myself roaming through the old trees at the end of the park, looking
  wistfully at the angles and turrets of the beautiful Manor House, and
  debating within myself whether I ought or ought not to call and renew an
  acquaintance with the family that had treated me so kindly after the scrape
  brought on by Bold's insubordination. That favourite was now a mature and
  experienced retriever, grave, imperturbable, and of extraordinary sagacity.
  Poor Bold! he was the handsomest and most powerful dog I ever saw, with a
  solemn expression of countenance that denoted as much intellect as was ever
  apparent on the face of a human being. We were vastly proud of Bold's beauty
  at the Grange, and my father had painted him a dozen times, in the
  performance of every feat, possible or impossible, that it comes within the
  province of a retriever to attempt. Bold was now my constant companion; he
  knew the way to Beverley as well as to his own lair in my bed-room, where he
  slept. Day after day he and I took the same road; day after day my courage
  failed me at the last moment, and we turned back without making the intended
  visit. At last, one morning, while I strolled as usual among the old trees at
  one extremity of the park, I caught sight of a white dress rounding the
  corner of the house, and entering the front door. I felt sure it could only
  belong to one, and with an effort that quite surprised even myself, I
  resolved to master my absurd timidity, and walk boldly up to call.</p>

  <p>I have not the slightest recollection of my ringing the door-bell, nor of
  the usual process by which a gentleman is admitted into a drawing-room; the
  rush of blood to my head almost blinded me, but I conclude that instinct took
  the place of reason, and that I demeaned myself in no such incoherent manner
  as to excite the attention of the servants, for I found myself in the
  beautiful drawing-room, which I remembered I had thought such a scene of
  fairyland years before, and seated, hat in hand, opposite Miss Beverley.</p>

  <p>She must have thought me the stupidest morning visitor that ever obtained
  entrance into a country-house; indeed, had it not been for the good-natured
  efforts of an elderly lady with a hooked nose, who had been her governess,
  and was now a sort of companion, Miss Beverley would have had all the
  conversation to herself; and I am constrained to admit that once or twice I
  caught an expression of surprise on her calm sweet face, that could only have
  been called up by the very inconsequent answers of which I was guilty in my
  nervous abstraction. I was so taken up in watching and admiring her, that I
  could think of nothing else. She was so quiet and self-possessed, so gentle
  and ladylike, so cool and well-dressed. I can remember the way in which her
  hair was parted and arranged to this day. She seemed to me a being of a
  superior order, something that never could by any possibility belong to the
  same sphere as myself. She was more like the picture of Queen Dido than ever,
  but the queen, happy and fancy free, with kindly eyes and unruffled brow; not
  the deceived, broken-hearted woman on her self-selected death-bed. I am not
  going to describe her&mdash;perhaps she was not beautiful to
  others&mdash;perhaps I should have wished the rest of the world to think her
  positively hideous&mdash;perhaps she was <i>then</i> not so transcendently
  beautiful even to me; nay, as I looked, I could pick faults in her features
  and colouring. I had served a long enough apprenticeship to my father to be
  able to criticise like an artist, and I could see here a tint that might be
  deepened, there a plait that might be better arranged&mdash;I do not mean to
  say she was perfect&mdash;I do not mean to say that she was a goddess or an
  angel; but I do mean to say that if ever there was a face on earth which to
  me presented the ideal of all that is sweetest and most lovable in woman,
  that face was Constance Beverley's.</p>

  <p>And yet I was not in love with her; no, I felt something exalting,
  something exhilarating in her presence&mdash;she seemed to fill the void in
  my life, which had long been so wearisome, but I was not in love with
  her&mdash;certainly not then. I felt less shy than usual, I even felt as if I
  too had some claim to social distinction, and could play my part as well as
  the rest on the shifting stage. She had the happy knack of making others feel
  in good spirits and at their ease in her society. I was not insensible to the
  spell, and when Sir Harry came in, and asked kindly after his old friend, and
  promised to come over soon and pay my father a visit, I answered frankly and
  at once; I could see even the thoughtless Baronet was struck with the change
  in my manner, indeed he said as much.</p>

  <p>"You must come over and stay with us, Mr. Egerton," was his hospitable
  invitation; "or if your father is so poorly you cannot leave him, look in
  here any day about luncheon-time. I am much from home myself, but you will
  always find Constance and Miss Minim. Tell your father I will ride over and
  see him to-morrow. I only came back yesterday. How you're grown, my lad, and
  improved&mdash;isn't he, Constance?"</p>

  <p>I would have given worlds to have heard Constance's answer, but she turned
  the subject with an inquiry after Bold (who was at that instant waiting
  patiently for his master on the door-step), and it was time to take leave, so
  I bowed myself out, with a faithful promise, that I was not likely to forget,
  of calling again soon.</p>

  <p>"So she has not forgotten Bold," I said to myself, at least twenty times,
  in my homeward walk; and I think, fond as I had always been of my dog, I
  liked him that day better than ever.</p>

  <p>"Father," I said, as I sat that evening after dinner, during which meal I
  felt conscious that I had been more lively, and, to use an expressive term,
  "better company," than usual; "I must write to London for a new coat, that
  black one is quite worn out."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Vere," answered my father, abstractedly; "tell them to make it
  large enough&mdash;you grow fast, my boy."</p>

  <p>"Do you think I am grown, father? Indeed, I am not so very little of my
  age now; and do you know, I was the strongest boy at Everdon, and could lift
  a heavier weight than Manners the usher; but, father"&mdash;and here I
  hesitated and stammered, till reassured by the kind smile on his dear old
  face,&mdash;"I don't mind asking you, and I <i>do</i> so wish to
  know&mdash;am I so <i>very, very</i>&mdash;ugly?" I brought out the hated
  word with an effort&mdash;my father burst out laughing.</p>

  <p>"What an odd question&mdash;why do you wish to know, Vere?" he asked. I
  made no reply, but felt I was blushing painfully. My father looked wistfully
  at me, while an expression as of pain contracted his wan features; and here
  the conversation dropped.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII. &mdash; "LETHALIS ARUNDO"</h2>

  <p class="first">That week I went over again to Beverley; the next, I had a
  book to fetch for Constance from Fleetsbury, that she had long wished to
  read, and I took it to her a volume at a time. My father was still busy with
  his painting&mdash;Sir Harry had gone off to Newmarket&mdash;Miss Minim
  seemed delighted to find any one who could relieve the monotony of the Manor
  House, and Constance herself treated me, now that the first awkwardness of
  our re-introduction was over, like an old playmate and friend. I was happier
  than I had ever been in my life. I felt an elasticity of spirits, a
  self-respect and self-reliance that I had thought myself hitherto incapable
  of entertaining. Oh, the joy of that blindfold time! whilst our eyes are
  wilfully shut to the future that we yet know <i>must</i> come, whilst we bask
  in the sunshine and inhale the fragrance of the rose, nor heed the
  thunder-cloud sleeping on the horizon, and the worm creeping at the core of
  the flower. I looked on Constance as I would have looked on an angel from
  heaven. I did not even confess to myself that I loved her, I was satisfied
  with the intense happiness of the present, and trembled at the bare idea of
  anything that might break the spell, and interrupt the calm quiet of our
  lives. With one excuse or another, I was at Beverley nearly every day; there
  were flowers to be dried, for Constance was a great botanist, and I had taken
  up that study, as I would have taken up shoe-making, could I have seen her a
  minute a day longer for the pursuit,&mdash;there was music to be copied, and
  if I could do nothing else, I could point off those crabbed hieroglyphics
  like a very engraver. Then Miss Minim broke her fan, and I walked ten miles
  in the rain to get it mended, with an alacrity and devotion that must have
  convinced her it was not for <i>her</i> sake: and yet I loved Miss Minim
  dearly, she was so associated in my mind with Constance, that except the
  young lady's own, that wizened old face brought the blood to my brow more
  rapidly than any other in the world. Oh! my heart aches when I think of that
  beautiful drawing-room, opening into the conservatory, and Constance playing
  airs on the pianoforte that made my nerves tingle with an ecstasy that was
  almost painful. Miss Minim engaged with her crotchet-work in the background,
  and I, the awkward, ungainly youth, saying nothing, hardly breathing, lest I
  should break the spell; but gazing intently on the fair young face, with its
  soft kind eyes, and its thrilling smile, and the smooth, shining braids of
  jet-black hair parted simply on that pure brow. Mine was no love at first
  sight, no momentary infatuation that has its course and burns itself out, the
  fiercer the sooner, with its own unsustained violence. No; it grew and stole
  upon me by degrees, I drank it in with every breath I breathed&mdash;I fought
  against it till every moment of my life was a struggle; and yet I cherished
  and pressed it to my heart when all was done. I knew I was no equal for such
  as Miss Beverley, I knew I had no right even to lift my eyes to so much
  beauty and so much goodness&mdash;I, the awkward, ugly schoolboy, or at best
  the shrinking, unattractive youth, in whose homage there was nothing for a
  woman to take pride, even if she did not think it ridiculous; but
  yet&mdash;God! how I loved her. Not a blossom in the garden, not a leaf on
  the tree, not a ray of sunshine, nor a white cloud drifting over the heaven,
  but was associated in my mind with her who was all the world to me. If I saw
  other women, I only compared them with <i>her</i>; if I read of beauty and
  grace in my dear old romances, or hung over the exquisite casts and spirited
  studies of my father's painting-room, it was but to refer the poet's dream
  and the artist's conception back to my own ideal. How I longed for beauty,
  power, talent, riches, fame, everything that could exalt me above my fellows,
  that I might fling all down at <i>her</i> feet, and bid her trample on it if
  she would. It was bitter to think I had nothing to offer; and yet I felt
  sometimes there ought to be something touching in my self-sacrifice. I looked
  for no return&mdash;I asked for no hope, no favour, not even pity; and I gave
  my all.</p>

  <p>At first it was delightful: the halcyon days flitted on, and I was happy.
  Sir Harry, when at home, treated me with the greatest kindness, and seemed to
  find pleasure in initiating me into those sports and amusements which he
  himself considered indispensable to the education of a gentleman. He took me
  out shooting with him, and great as was my natural aversion to the slaying of
  unoffending partridges and innocent hares, I soon conquered my foolish
  nervousness about firing a gun, and became no mean proficient with the
  double-barrel. My ancient captor, the head keeper, now averred that "Muster
  Egerton was the <i>cooollest</i> shot he ever see for so young a gentleman,
  and <i>coool</i> shots is generally deadly!" The very fact of my not caring a
  straw whether I killed my game or not, removed at once that over-anxiety
  which is the great obstacle to success with all young sportsmen. It was
  sufficient for me to know that a day's shooting at her father's secured two
  interviews (morning and afternoon) with Constance, and I loaded, and banged,
  and walked, and toiled like the veriest disciple of Colonel Hawker that ever
  marked a covey. All this exercise had a beneficial effect on my health and
  spirits; I grew apace, I was no longer the square, clumsy-built dwarf; my
  frame was gradually developing itself into that of a powerful, athletic man.
  I was much taller than Constance now, and not a little proud of that
  advantage. Having no others with whom to compare myself, I began to hope that
  I was, after all, not much worse-looking than the rest of my kind; and by
  degrees a vague idea sprang up in my mind, though I never presumed to give it
  shape and consistency, that Constance might some day learn to look kindly
  upon me, and that perhaps, after many, many years, the time would come when I
  should dare to throw myself at her feet and tell her how I had worshipped
  her; not to ask for a return, but only to tell her how true, and hopeless and
  devoted had been my love. After that I thought I could die happy.</p>

  <p>Weeks grew to months, and months to years, and still no change took place
  in my habits and mode of life. My father talked of sending me to Oxford, for
  I was now grown up, but when the time came he was loth to part with me, and I
  had such a dread of anything that should take me away from Alton, that I
  hailed the abandonment of the scheme with intense joy. Constance went to
  London with Sir Harry during the season, and for two or three months of the
  glorious summer I was sadly low and restless and unhappy; but I studied hard
  during this period of probation, to pass the time, and when she came again,
  and gave me her hand with her old kind smile, I felt rewarded for all my
  anxieties, and the sun began to shine for me once more.</p>

  <p>I was a man now in heart and feelings, and loved with all a man's ardour
  and singleness of purpose, yet I never dreamed she could be mine. No; I shut
  my eyes to the future, and blindfold I struggled on; but I was no longer
  happy; I grew restless and excited, out of temper, petulant in trifles, and
  incapable of any fixed application or sustained labour. I was leading an
  aimless and unprofitable life; I was an idolater, and I was beginning to pay
  the penalty; little did I know then what would be my sufferings ere the
  uttermost farthing should be exacted. Something told me the time of my
  happiness was drawing to a close; there is a consciousness before we wake
  from a moral as well as a physical sleep, and my awakening was near at
  hand.</p>

  <p>It was a soft grey morning early in August, one of those beautiful summer
  days that we have only in England, when the sky is clouded, but the air pure
  and serene, and the face of nature smiling as though in a calm sleep. Not a
  breath stirred the leaves of the grand old trees in the park at Beverley, nor
  rippled the milk-white surface of the mere. The corn was ready for cutting,
  but scarce a sheaf had yet fallen before the sickle; it was the very meridian
  and prime of the summer's beauty, and my ladye-love had returned from her
  third London season, and was still Constance Beverley. It was later than my
  usual hour of visiting at the Manor, for my father had been unwell during the
  night, and I would not leave him till the doctor had been, so Constance had
  put on her hat and started for her morning's walk alone. She took the path
  that led towards Alton, and Bold and I caught sight at the same moment of the
  well-known white dress flitting under the old oaks in the park. My heart used
  to stop beating when I saw her, and now I turned sick and faint from sheer
  happiness. Not so Bold: directly he caught sight of the familiar form away he
  scoured like an arrow, and in less than a minute he was bounding about her,
  barking and frisking, and testifying his delight with an ardour that was
  responded to in a modified degree by the young lady. What prompted me I know
  not, but instead of walking straight on and greeting her, I turned aside
  behind a tree, and, myself unseen, watched the form of her I loved so fondly,
  as she stepped gracefully on towards my hiding-place; she seemed surprised,
  stopped, and looked about her, Bold meanwhile thrusting his nose into her
  small gloved hand.</p>

  <p>"Why, Bold," said she, "you have lost your master." And as she spoke she
  stooped down and kissed the dog on his broad, honest forehead. My heart
  bounded as if it would have burst; never shall I forget the sensations of
  that moment; not for worlds would I have accosted her then&mdash;it would
  have been sacrilege, it would have seemed like taking advantage of her
  frankness and honesty. No; I made a wide detour, still concealed behind the
  trees, and struck in upon the path in front of her as if I came direct from
  home. Why was it that her greeting was less cordial than usual? Why was it no
  longer "Vere" and "Constance" between us, but "Mr. Egerton" and "Miss
  Beverley"? She seemed ill at ease, too, and her tone was harder than usual
  till I mentioned my father's illness, when she softened directly. I thought
  there were <i>tears in her voice</i> as she asked me&mdash;</p>

  <p>"How could I leave him if he was so poorly?"</p>

  <p>"Because I knew you came back yesterday, Miss Beverley, and I would not
  miss being one of the first to welcome you home," was my reply.</p>

  <p>"Why do you call me Miss Beverley?" she broke in, with a quick glance from
  under her straw hat. "Why not 'Constance,' as you used?"</p>

  <p>"Then why not call me 'Vere'?" I retorted; but my voice shook, and I made
  a miserable attempt to appear unconcerned.</p>

  <p>"Very well, 'Constance' and 'Vere' let it be," she replied, laughing; "and
  now, Vere, how did you know I came back yesterday?"</p>

  <p>"Because I saw the carriage from the top of Buttercup Hill&mdash;because I
  watched there for six hours that I might make sure&mdash;because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I hesitated and stopped; she turned her head away to caress Bold. Fool!
  fool that I was! Why did I not tell her all then and there? Why did I not set
  my fate at once upon the cast? Another moment, and it was too late. When she
  turned her face again towards me it was deadly pale, and she began talking
  rapidly, but in a constrained voice, of the delights of her London season,
  and the gaieties of that to me unknown world, the world of fashionable
  life.</p>

  <p>"We have had so many balls and operas and dissipations, that papa says he
  is quite knocked up; and who do you think is in London, Vere, and who do you
  think has been dancing with me night after night?" (I winced), "who but your
  old schoolfellow, your dear old friend, Count de Rohan!"</p>

  <p>"Victor!" I exclaimed, and for an instant I forgot even my jealousy at the
  idea of any one dancing night after night with Constance, in my joy at
  hearing of my dear old schoolfellow. "Oh, tell me all about him&mdash;is he
  grown? is he good-looking? is he like what he was? is he going to stay in
  England? did he ask after me? is he coming down to see me at Alton?"</p>

  <p>"Gently," replied Constance, with her own sweet smile. "One question at a
  time, if you please, Vere, and I can answer them. He is grown, of course, but
  not more than other people; he is <i>very</i> good-looking, so everybody
  says, and <i>I</i> really think he must be, too; he is not nearly so much
  altered from what he was as a boy, as some one else I know" (with a sly
  glance at me), "and he talks positively of paying us a visit early in the
  shooting season, to meet another old friend of yours, Mr. Ropsley, who is to
  be here to-day to luncheon; I hope you will stay and renew your acquaintance,
  and talk as much 'Everdon' as you did when we were children; and now, Vere,
  we must go in and see papa, who has probably by this time finished his
  letters." So we turned and bent our steps (mine were most unwilling ones)
  towards the house.</p>

  <p>We had not proceeded far up the avenue, ere we were overtaken by a
  postchaise laden with luggage, and carrying a most irreproachable-looking
  valet on the box; as it neared us a well-known voice called to the boy to
  stop, and a tall, aristocratic-looking man got out, whom at first I had some
  difficulty in identifying as my former school-fellow, Ropsley, now a captain
  in the Guards, and as well known about London as the Duke of York's Column
  itself. He sprang out of the carriage, and greeted Constance with the air of
  an old friend, but paused and surveyed me for an instant from head to foot
  with a puzzled expression that I believe was only put on for the
  occasion,&mdash;then seized my hand, and declared I was so much altered and
  improved he had not known me at first. This is always gratifying to a youth,
  and Ropsley was evidently the same as he had always been&mdash;a man who
  never threw a chance away&mdash;but what good could <i>I</i> do him? Why
  should it be worth his while to conciliate such as me? I believe he never
  forgot the fable of the Lion and the Mouse.</p>

  <p>When the first salutations and inquiries after Sir Harry were over, he
  began to converse with Constance on all those topics of the London world with
  which women like so much to be made acquainted,&mdash;topics so limited and
  personal that they throw the uninitiated listener completely into the
  background. I held my tongue and watched my old schoolfellow. He was but
  little altered since I had seen him last, save that his tall figure had grown
  even taller, and he had acquired that worn look about the eyes and mouth
  which a few seasons of dissipation and excitement invariably produce even in
  the young. After detailing a batch of marriages, and a batch of "failures,"
  in all of which the names of the sufferers were equally unknown to me, he
  observed, with a peculiarly marked expression, to Constance, "Of course you
  know there never was anything in that report about De Rohan and Miss Blight;
  but so many people assured me it was true, that if I had not known Victor as
  well as I do, I should have been almost inclined to believe it."</p>

  <p>I watched Constance narrowly as he spoke, and I fancied she winced. Could
  it have been only my own absurd fancy? Ropsley proceeded, "I saw him
  yesterday, and he desired his kindest regards to you, and I was to say he
  would be here on the 3rd."</p>

  <p>"Oh! I am so glad!" exclaimed Constance, her whole countenance brightening
  with a joyous smile, that went like a knife to my foolish, inexperienced
  heart, that OUGHT to have reassured and made me happier than ever. Does a
  woman confess she is "delighted" to see the man she is really fond of? Is not
  that softened expression which pervades the human face at mention of the "one
  loved name" more akin to a tear than a smile? "He is so pleasant and so
  good-natured, and will enliven us all so much here;" she added, turning to
  me, "Vere, you must come over on the 3rd, and meet Count de Rohan; you know
  he is the oldest friend you have,&mdash;an older friend even than I am."</p>

  <p>I was hurt, angry, maddened already, and this kind speech, with the frank,
  affectionate glance that accompanied it, filled my bitter cup to overflowing.
  Has a woman no compunction? or is she ignorant of the power a few light
  commonplace words may have to inflict such acute pain? Constance
  <i>cannot</i> have guessed the feelings that were tearing at my heart; but
  she must have seen my altered manner, and doubtless felt herself aggrieved,
  and thought she had a right to be angry at my unjustifiable display of
  temper.</p>

  <p>"I thank you," I replied, coldly and distantly; "I cannot leave my father
  until he is better; perhaps De Rohan will come over and see us if he can get
  away from pleasanter engagements. I fear I have stayed too long already. I am
  anxious about my father, and must go home. Good-bye, Ropsley; good-morning,
  Miss Beverley. Here&mdash;Bold! Bold!"</p>

  <p>She looked scared for an instant, then hurt, and almost angry. She shook
  hands with me coldly, and turned away with more dignity than usual. Brute,
  idiot that I was! even Bold showed more good feeling and more sagacity than
  his master. He had been sniffing round Ropsley with many a low growl, and
  every expression of dislike which a well-nurtured dog permits himself towards
  his master's associates; but he looked wistfully back at Constance as she
  walked away, and I really thought for once he would have broken through all
  his habits of fidelity and subordination, and followed her into the
  house.</p>

  <p>What a pleasant walk home I had I leave those to judge who, like me, have
  dashed down in a fit of ill-temper the structure that they have taken years
  of pain, and labour, and self-denial to rear on high. Was this, then, my
  boasted chivalry&mdash;my truth and faith that was to last for ever&mdash;to
  fight through all obstacles&mdash;to be so pure, and holy, and unwavering,
  and to look for no return? I had failed at the first trial. How little I
  felt, how mean and unworthy, how far below my own standard of what a man
  should be&mdash;my ideal of worth, that I had resolved I would attain. And
  Ropsley, too&mdash;the cold, calculating, cynical man of the
  world&mdash;Ropsley must have seen it all. I had placed myself in his
  power&mdash;nay, more, I had compromised <i>her</i> by my own display of
  bitterness and ill-temper. What right had I to show any one how I loved her?
  nay, what right had I to love her at all? The thought goaded me like a sting.
  I ran along the foot-path, Bold careering by my side&mdash;I sprang over the
  stiles like a madman, as I was; but physical exertion produced at last a
  reaction on the mind. I grew gradually calmer and more capable of reasoning;
  a resolution sprang up in my heart that had never before taken root in that
  undisciplined soil. I determined to win her, or die in the attempt.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I thought, "from this very day I will devote all my thoughts, all
  my energies, to the one great work. Beautiful, superior, unattainable as she
  is, surely the whole devotion of a life must count for something&mdash;surely
  God will not permit a human being to sacrifice his very soul in vain."
  (Folly! folly! Ought I not to have known that this very worship was idolatry,
  blasphemy of the boldest, to offer the creature a tribute that belongs only
  to the Creator&mdash;to dare to call on His name in witness of my mad
  rebellion and disloyalty?) "Surely I shall some day succeed, or fall a victim
  to that which I feel convinced must be the whole aim and end of my existence.
  Yes, I will consult my kind old father&mdash;I will declare myself at once
  honestly to Sir Harry. After all, I, too, am a gentleman; I have talents; I
  will make my way; with such a goal in view I can do anything; there is no
  labour I would shrink from, no danger I should fear to face, with Constance
  as the prize of my success;" and I reached the old worn-out gates of Alton
  Grange repeating to myself several of those well-known adages that have so
  many premature and ill-advised attempts to answer for&mdash;"Fortune favours
  the bold;" "Faint heart never won fair lady;" "Nothing venture, nothing
  have," etc.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV. &mdash; THE PICTURE</h2>

  <p class="first">My father was very weak, and looked dreadfully ill: the
  doctor had recommended repose and absence of all excitement; "especially,"
  said the man of science, "let us abstain from painting. Gentle exercise,
  generous living, and quiet, absolute quiet, sir, can alone bring us round
  again." Notwithstanding which professional advice, I found the patient in his
  dressing-gown, hard at work as usual with his easel and colours, but this
  time the curtain was not hastily drawn over the canvas, and my father himself
  invited me to inspect his work.</p>

  <p>I came in heated and excited; my father was paler than ever, and seemed
  much exhausted. He looked very grave, and his large dark eyes shone with an
  ominous and unearthly light.</p>

  <p>"Vere," said he, "sit down by me. I have put off all I had to say to you,
  my boy, till I fear it is too late. I want to speak to you now as I have
  never spoken before. Where have you been this morning, Vere?"</p>

  <p>I felt my colour rising at the question, but I looked him straight in the
  face, and answered boldly, "At Beverley Manor, father."</p>

  <p>"Vere," he continued, "I am afraid you care for Miss Beverley,&mdash;nay,
  it is no use denying it," he proceeded; "I ought to have taken better care of
  you. I have neglected my duty as a father, and my sins, I fear, are to be
  visited upon my child. Look on that canvas, boy; the picture is finished now,
  and my work is done. Vere, that is your mother."</p>

  <p>It was the first time I had ever heard that sacred name from my father's
  lips. I had often wished to question him about her, but I was always shy, and
  easily checked; whilst he from whom alone I could obtain information, I have
  already said, was a man that brooked no inquiries on a subject he chose
  should remain secret, so that hitherto I had been kept in complete ignorance
  of the whole history of one parent. As I looked on her likeness now, I began
  for the first time to realise the loss I had sustained.</p>

  <p>The picture was of a young and gentle-looking woman, with deep, dark eyes,
  and jet-black hair; a certain thickness of eyebrows and width of forehead
  denoted a foreign origin; but whatever intensity of expression these
  peculiarities may have imparted to the upper part of her countenance, was
  amply redeemed by the winning sweetness of her mouth, and the delicate
  chiselling of the other features. She was pale of complexion, and looked
  somewhat sad and thoughtful; but there was a depth of trust and affection in
  those fond eyes that spoke volumes for the womanly earnestness and simplicity
  of her character. It was one of those pictures that, without knowing the
  original, you feel at once must be a likeness. I could not keep down the
  tears as I whispered, "Oh, mother, mother, why did I never know you?"</p>

  <p>My father's face grew dark and stern: "Vere," said he, "the time has come
  when I must tell you all. It may be that your father's example may serve as a
  beacon to warn you from the rock on which so many of us have made shipwreck.
  When I was your age, my boy, I had no one to control me, no one even to
  advise. I had unlimited command of money, a high position in society, good
  looks&mdash;I may say so without vanity now&mdash;health, strength, and
  spirits, all that makes life enjoyable, and I enjoyed it. I was in high
  favour with the Prince. I was sought after in society; my horses won at
  Newmarket, my jests were quoted in the Clubs, my admiration was coveted by
  the 'fine ladies,' and I had the ball at my foot. Do you think I was happy?
  No. I lived for myself; I thought only of pleasure, and of pleasure I took my
  fill; but pleasure is a far different thing from happiness, or should I have
  wandered away at the very height of my popularity and success, to live abroad
  by myself with my colours and sketch-book, vainly seeking the peace of mind
  which was not to be found at home? I was bored, Vere, as a man who leads an
  aimless life always is bored. Fresh amusements might stave off the mental
  disease for a time, but it came back with renewed virulence; and I cared not
  at what expense I purchased an hour's immunity with the remedy of fierce
  excitement. But I never was faithless to my art. Through it all I loved to
  steal away and get an hour or two at the easel. Would I had devoted my
  lifetime to it. How differently should I feel now.</p>

  <p>"One winter I was painting in the Belvidere at Vienna. A young girl
  timidly looked over my shoulder at my work, and her exclamation of artless
  wonder and admiration was so gratifying, that I could not resist the desire
  of making her acquaintance. This I achieved without great difficulty. She was
  the daughter of a bourgeois merchant, one not moving in the same society as
  myself, and, consequently, unknown to any of my associates. Perhaps this
  added to the charm of our acquaintance; perhaps it imparted the zest of
  novelty to our intercourse. Ere I returned to London, I was fonder of Elise
  than I had ever yet been of any woman in the world. Why did I not make her
  mine? Oh! pride and selfishness; I thought it would be a
  <i>m&eacute;salliance</i>&mdash;I thought my London friends would laugh at
  me&mdash;I thought I should lose my liberty.&mdash;Liberty, forsooth! when
  one's will depends on a fool's sneer. And yet I think if I had known her
  faith and truth, I would have given up all for her, even then. So I came back
  to England, and the image of my pale, lovely Elise haunted me more than I
  liked. I rushed deeper into extravagance and dissipation; for two years I
  gambled and speculated, and rioted, till at the end of that period I found
  ruin staring me in the face. I saved a competency out of the wreck of my
  property; and by Sir Harry's advice&mdash;our neighbour, Vere; you needn't
  wince, my boy&mdash;I managed to keep the old house here as a refuge for my
  old age. Then, and not till then, I thought once more of Elise&mdash;oh,
  hard, selfish heart!&mdash;not in the wealth and luxury which I ought to have
  been proud to offer up at her feet, but in the poverty and misfortune which I
  felt would make her love me all the better. I returned to Vienna, determined
  to seek her out and make her my own. I soon discovered her relatives; too
  soon I heard what had become of her. In defiance of all their wishes, she had
  resolutely refused to make an excellent marriage provided for her according
  to the custom of her country. She would give no reasons; she obstinately
  denied having formed any previous attachment; but on being offered the
  alternative, she preferred 'taking the veil,' and was even then a nun,
  immured in a convent within three leagues of Vienna. What could I do? Alas! I
  know full well what I ought to have done; but I was headstrong, violent, and
  passionate: never in my life had I left a desire ungratified, and now could I
  lose the one ardent wish of my whole existence for the sake of a time-worn
  superstition and an unmeaning vow? Thus I argued, and on such fallacious
  principles I acted.</p>

  <p>"Vere, my boy, right is right, and wrong is wrong. You always know in your
  heart of hearts the one from the other. Never stifle that instinctive
  knowledge, never use sophistry to persuade yourself you may do that which you
  feel you ought not. I travelled down at once to the convent. I heard her at
  vespers; I knew that sweet, silvery voice amongst all the rest. As I stood in
  the old low-roofed chapel, with the summer sunbeams streaming across the
  groined arches and the quaint carved pews, and throwing a flood of light
  athwart the aisle, while the organ above pealed forth its solemn tones, and
  called us all to repentance and prayer, how could I meditate the evil deed?
  How could I resolve to sacrifice her peace of mind for ever to my own wild
  happiness? Vere, I carried her off from the convent&mdash;I eluded all
  pursuit, all suspicion&mdash;I took her with me to the remotest part of
  Hungary, her own native country. For the first few weeks I believe she was
  deliriously happy, and then&mdash;it broke her heart. Yes, Vere, she believed
  she had lost her soul for my sake. She never reproached me&mdash;she never
  even repined in words; but I saw, day after day, the colour fading on her
  cheek, the light growing brighter in her sunken eye. She drooped like a lily
  with a worm at its core. For one short year I held her in my arms; I did all
  that man could to cheer and comfort her&mdash;in vain. She smiled upon me
  with the wan, woful smile that haunts me still; and she died, Vere, when you
  were born." My father hid his face for a few seconds, and when he looked up
  again he was paler than ever.</p>

  <p>"My boy," he murmured, in a hoarse, broken voice, "you have been
  sacrificed. Forgive me, forgive me, my child; <i>you are illegitimate</i>." I
  staggered as if I had been shot&mdash;I felt stunned and stupefied&mdash;I
  saw the whole desolation of the sentence which had just been passed upon me.
  Yes, I was a bastard; I had no right even to the name I bore. Never again
  must I hold my head up amongst my fellows; never again indulge in those
  dreams of future distinction, which I only now knew I had so cherished;
  <i>never, never</i> think of Constance more! It was all over now; there was
  nothing left on earth for me.</p>

  <p>There is a reaction in the nature of despair. I drew myself up, and looked
  my father steadily in the face.</p>

  <p>"Father," I said, "whatever happens, I am your son; do not think I shall
  ever reproach you. Even now you might cast me off if you chose, and none
  could blame you; but I will never forget you,&mdash;whatever happens, I will
  always love you the same." He shook in every limb, and for the first time in
  my recollection, he burst into a flood of tears; they seemed to afford him
  relief, and he proceeded with more composure&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I can never repay the injury I have done you, Vere; and now listen to me
  and forgive me if you can. All I have in the world will be yours; in every
  respect I wish you to be my representative, and to bear my name. No one knows
  that I was not legally married to <i>her</i>, except Sir Harry Beverley.
  Vere, your look of misery assures me that I have told you <i>too late</i>. I
  am indeed punished in your despair. I ought to have watched over you with
  more care. I had intended to make you a great man, Vere. In your childhood I
  always hoped that my own talent for art would be reproduced in my boy, and
  that you would become the first painter of the age, and then none would
  venture to question your antecedents or your birth. When I found I was to be
  disappointed in this respect, I still hoped that with the competency I shall
  leave you, and your own retired habits, you might live happily enough in
  ignorance of the brand which my misconduct has inflicted on you. But I never
  dreamed, my child, that you should set your heart on <i>his</i> daughter, who
  can alone cast this reproach in your teeth. It is hopeless&mdash;it is
  irretrievable. My boy, my boy! your prospects have been ruined, and now I
  fear your heart is breaking, and all through me. My punishment is greater
  than I can bear."</p>

  <p>My father stopped again. He was getting fearfully haggard, and seemed
  quite exhausted. He pointed to the picture which he had just completed.</p>

  <p>"Day after day, Vere," he murmured, "I have been working at that likeness,
  and day after day her image seems to have come back more vividly into my
  mind. I have had a presentiment, that when it was quite finished it would be
  time for me to go. It is the best picture I ever painted. Stand a little to
  the left, Vere, and you will get it in a better light. I must leave you soon,
  my boy, but it is to go to her. Forgive me, Vere, and think kindly of your
  old father when I am gone. Leave me now for a little, my boy; I must be
  alone. God bless you, Vere!"</p>

    <p class="caption">"My father was apparently asleep!"</p>
  </div>

  <p>I left the painting-room, and went into the garden to compose my mind, and
  recover, if possible, from the stunning effects of my father's intelligence.
  I walked up and down, like a man in a dream. I could not yet realise the full
  extent of my misery. The hours passed by, and still I paced the gravel walk
  under the yew-trees, and took no heed of time or anything else. At length a
  servant came to warn me that dinner was waiting, and I went back to the
  painting-room to call my father. The door was not locked, as it had hitherto
  been, and my father was apparently asleep, with his head resting on one arm,
  and the brush, fallen from his other hand, on the floor. As I touched his
  shoulder to wake him, I remarked that hand was clenched and stiff. Wake him!
  he would never wake again. How I lived through that fearful evening I know
  not. There was a strange confusion in the house,&mdash;running up and down
  stairs, hushed voices, ghostly whisperings. The doctors came. I know not what
  passed. They called it aneurism of the heart; I recollect that much; but
  everything was dim and indistinct till, a week afterwards, when the funeral
  was over, I seemed to awake from a dream, and to find myself alone in the
  world.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV. &mdash; BEVERLEY MERE</h2>

  <p class="first">What contrasts there are in life! Light and shade, Lazarus
  and Dives, the joyous spirit and the broken heart, always in juxtaposition.
  Here are two pictures not three miles apart.</p>

  <p>A pale, wan young man, dressed in black, with the traces of deep grief on
  his countenance, and his whole bearing that of one who is thoroughly overcome
  and prostrated by sorrow, sits brooding over an untasted breakfast; the room
  he occupies is not calculated to shed a cheering influence on his
  reflections: it is a long, low, black-wainscoted apartment, well stored with
  books, and furnished in a curious and somewhat picturesque style with massive
  chairs and quaintly carved cabinets. Ancient armour hangs from the walls,
  looming ghostly and gigantic in the subdued light, for although it is a
  bright October morning out-of-doors, its narrow windows and thick walls make
  Alton Grange dull and sombre and gloomy within. A few sketches, evidently by
  the hand of a master, are hung in favourable lights. More than one are
  spirited representations of a magnificent black-and-white retriever&mdash;the
  same that is now lying on the floor, his head buried between his huge, strong
  paws, watching his master's figure with unwinking eyes. That master takes no
  notice of his favourite. Occasionally he fixes his heavy glance on a picture
  hanging over the chimney-piece, and then withdraws it with a low stifled moan
  of anguish, at which the dog raises his head wistfully, seeming to recognise
  a too familiar sound. The picture is of a beautiful foreign-looking woman;
  its eyes and eyebrows are reproduced in that sorrow-stricken young man. They
  are mother and son; and they have never met. Could she but have seen me then!
  If ever a spirit might revisit earth to console the weary pilgrim here,
  surely it would be a mother's, bringing comfort to a suffering child. How I
  longed for her love and her sympathy. How I felt I had been robbed&mdash;yes,
  <i>robbed</i>&mdash;of my rights in her sad and premature death. Reader, have
  you never seen a little child, after a fall, or a blow, or some infantine
  wrong or grievance, run and hide its weeping face in its mother's lap? Such
  is the first true impulse of our childish nature, and it is never completely
  eradicated from the human breast. The strong, proud man, though he may almost
  forget her in his triumphs and successes, goes to his mother for consolation
  when he is overtaken by sorrow, deceived in his affections, wounded in his
  feelings, or sad and sick at heart. There he knows he is secure of sympathy
  and consolation; there he knows he will not be judged harshly, and as the
  world judges; there he knows that, do what he will, is a fountain of love and
  patience, never to run dry; and for one blessed moment he is indeed a child
  again. God help those who, like me, have never known a mother's love. Such
  are the true orphans, and such He will not forget.</p>

  <p>Bold loses patience at last, and pokes his cold, wet nose into my hand.
  Yes, Bold, it is no use to sit brooding here. "Hie, boy! fetch me my hat."
  The dog is delighted with his task: away he scampers across the hall&mdash;he
  knows well which hat to choose&mdash;and springing at the crape-covered one,
  brings it to me in his mouth, his fine honest countenance beaming with pride,
  and his tail waving with delight. We emerge through a glass door into the
  garden, and insensibly, for the first time since my father's death, we take
  the direction of Beverley Manor.</p>

  <p>This is a dark and sadly-shaded picture; let us turn to one of brighter
  lights and more variegated colouring. The sun is streaming into a beautiful
  little breakfast-room opening on a conservatory, with flowers, and a fountain
  of gold-fish, and all that a conservatory should have. The room itself is
  richly papered and ornamented, perhaps a little too profusely, with ivory and
  gilding. Two or three exquisite landscapes in water-colours adorn the walls;
  and rose-coloured hangings shed a soft, warm light over the furniture and the
  inmates. The former is of a light and tasteful description&mdash;low,
  soft-cushioned <i>fauteuils</i>, thin cane chairs, bright-coloured ottomans
  and footstools, Bohemian glass vases filled with flowers&mdash;everything
  gay, vivid, and luxurious; a good fire burning cheerfully on the hearth, and
  a breakfast-table, with its snowy cloth and bright silver belongings, give an
  air of homely comfort to the scene. The latter consists of four persons, who
  have met together at the morning meal every day now for several weeks.
  Constance Beverley sits at the head of the table making tea; Ropsley and Sir
  Harry, dressed in wondrous shooting apparel, are busily engaged with their
  breakfast; and Miss Minim is relating to the world in general her sufferings
  from rheumatism and neuralgia, to which touching narrative nobody seems to
  think it necessary to pay much attention. Ropsley breaks in abruptly by
  asking Miss Beverley for another cup of tea. He treats her with studied
  politeness, but never takes his cold grey eye off her countenance. The girl
  feels that he is watching her, and it makes her shy and uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"Any news, Ropsley?" says Sir Harry, observing the pile of letters at his
  friend's elbow; "no <i>officials</i>, I hope, to send you back to
  London."</p>

  <p>"None as yet, thank Heaven, Sir Harry," replies his friend; "and not much
  in the papers. We shall have war, I think."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't say so, Mr. Ropsley," observes Constance, with an anxious look.
  "I trust we shall never see anything so horrid again."</p>

  <p>Miss Minim remarks that "occasional wars are beneficial, nay, necessary
  for the welfare of the human race," illustrating her position by the familiar
  metaphor of thunderstorms, etc.; but Ropsley, who has quite the upper hand of
  Miss Minim, breaks in upon her ruthlessly, as he observes, "The funds gone
  down a fraction, Sir Harry, I see. I think one ought to sell. By-the-bye,
  I've a capital letter from De Rohan, at Paris. You would like to hear what he
  is about, Miss Beverley, I am sure."</p>

  <p>Constance winced and coloured. It was Ropsley's game to assert a sort of
  matter-of-course <i>tendresse</i> on her part for my Hungarian friend, which
  he insisted on so gradually, but yet so successfully, as to give him the
  power of making her uneasy at the mention of "De Rohan's" name. He wished to
  establish an influence over her, and this was the only manner in which he
  could do so; but Ropsley was a man who only asked to insert the point of the
  wedge, he could trust himself to do the rest. Yet, with all his knowledge of
  human nature, he made this one great mistake, he judged of women by the other
  half of mankind; so he looked pointedly at Constance as he added, "I'll read
  you what he says, or, perhaps, Miss Beverley, you would like to see his
  letter?"</p>

  <p>He had now driven her a little too far, and she turned round upon him.</p>

  <p>"Really, Mr. Ropsley, I don't wish to interfere with your correspondence.
  I hate to read other people's letters; and Count de Rohan has become such a
  stranger now that I have almost forgotten him."</p>

  <p>She was angry with herself immediately she had spoken. It seemed so like
  the remark of a person who was piqued. Ropsley would be more than ever
  convinced now that she cared for him. Sir Harry, too, looked up from his
  plate, apparently at his daughter's unusual vehemence. The girl bit her lips,
  and wished she had held her tongue. Ropsley saw he had marked up another
  point in the game.</p>

  <p>"Very true," said he, with his quiet, well-bred smile: "old playfellows
  and old school-days cannot be expected to last all one's life. However,
  Victor does not forget us. He seems to be very gay, though, and rather
  dissipated, at Paris; knows all the world and goes everywhere; ran a horse
  last week at Chantilly. You know Chantilly, Sir Harry."</p>

  <p>The Baronet's face brightened. He had won a cup, given by Louis Philippe,
  from all the foreigners there on one occasion, and he liked to be reminded of
  it.</p>

  <p>"Know it," said he, "I should think I do. Why, I trained Flibbertigibbet
  in the park here myself&mdash;I and the old coachman. We never sent him to my
  own trainer at Newmarket, but took him over ourselves, and beat them all.
  That was the cup you saw in the centre of the dinner-table yesterday. The
  two-year-old we tried at Lansdowne was his grandson. Ah! Ropsley, I wish I
  had taken your advice about him."</p>

  <p>Ropsley was, step by step, obtaining great influence over Sir Harry. He
  returned to the subject of old friendships.</p>

  <p>"By-the-bye, Miss Beverley, have you heard anything of poor Egerton? I
  fear his father's death will be a sad blow to him. I tremble for the
  consequences."</p>

  <p>And here he touched his forehead, with a significant look at Sir
  Harry.</p>

  <p>Constance was a true woman. She was always ready too vigorously to defend
  an absent friend, but she was no match for her antagonist; she could not keep
  cool.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" said she, angrily. "Why should you tremble, as you
  call it, for Vere?"</p>

  <p>Ropsley put on his most provoking air, as he answered, with a sort of
  playful mock deference&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, Miss Beverley, I am continually affronting you, this
  unlucky morning. First, I bore you about De Rohan, thinking you <i>do</i>care
  for your old friends; then I make you angry with me about Egerton, believing
  you <i>don't</i>. After all, I said no harm about him; nothing more than we
  all know perfectly well. He always was eccentric as a boy&mdash;he is more so
  than ever, I think, now; and I only meant that I feared any sudden shock or
  violent affliction might upset his nervous system, and, in short&mdash;may I
  ask you for a little more cream?&mdash;end in total derangement. The fact
  is," he added, <i>sotto voce</i>, to Sir Harry, "he is as mad as Bedlam
  now."</p>

  <p>He saw the girl's lip quiver, and her hand shake as she gave him his cup;
  but he kept his cold grey eye fastened on her. He seemed to read her most
  secret thoughts, and she feared him now&mdash;actually feared him. Well, it
  was always something gained. He proceeded good-humouredly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Do we shoot on the island to-day, Sir Harry?" he asked of his host.
  "Perhaps Miss Beverley will come over to our luncheon in her boat. How pretty
  you have made that island, Sir Harry; and what a place for ducks about
  sundown!"</p>

  <p>The island was a pet toy of Sir Harry's; he was pleased, as usual, with
  his friend's good taste.</p>

  <p>"Yes, come over to luncheon, Constance," said he. "You can manage the boat
  quite well that short way."</p>

  <p>"No, thank you, papa," answered Constance, with a glance at Ropsley; "the
  boat is out of repair, and I had rather not run the risk of an upset."</p>

  <p>"You used to be so fond of boating, Miss Beverley," observed Ropsley, with
  his scarcely perceptible sneer. "You and Egerton used to be always on the
  water. Perhaps you don't like it without a companion; pray don't think of
  coming on our account. I quite agree with you, it makes all the difference in
  a water-party."</p>

  <p>Constance began to talk very fast to her father.</p>

  <p>"I'll come, papa, after all, I think," said she; "it is such a beautiful
  day! and the boat will do very well, I dare say&mdash;and I'm so fond of the
  water, papa; and&mdash;and I'll go and put my bonnet on now. I've got two or
  three things to do in the garden before I start."</p>

  <p>So she hurried from the room, but not till Ropsley had presented her with
  a sprig of geranium he had gathered in the conservatory, and thanked her in a
  sort of mock-heroic speech for her kindness in so readily acceding to his
  wishes.</p>

  <p>Would he have been pleased or not, could he have seen her in the privacy
  of her own apartment, which she had no sooner reached than she dashed his
  gift upon the floor, stamping on it with her little foot as though she would
  crush it into atoms, while her bosom heaved, and her dark eyes filled with
  tears, shed she scarce knew why? She had a vague consciousness of
  humiliation, and an undefined feeling of alarm that she could not have
  accounted for even to herself, but which was very uncomfortable
  notwithstanding.</p>

  <p>The gentlemen put on their belts and shooting apparatus; and Ropsley, with
  the sneer deepening on his well-cut features, whispered to himself, "<i>Pour
  le coup, papillon, je te tiens</i>."</p>

  <p>Bold and I strolled leisurely along: the dog indulging in his usual
  vagaries on the way; his master brooding and thoughtful, reflecting on the
  many happy times he had trod the same pathway when he was yet in ignorance of
  the fatal secret, and how it was all over now. My life was henceforth to be a
  blank. I began to speculate, as I had never speculated before, on the objects
  and aims of existence. What had I done, I thought, that I should be doomed to
  be <i>so</i> miserable?&mdash;that I should have neither home nor relatives
  nor friends?&mdash;that, like the poor man whose rich neighbour had flocks
  and herds and vineyards, I should have but my one pet lamb, and even that
  should be taken away from me? Then I thought of my father's career&mdash;how
  I had been used to look up to him as the impersonation of all that was
  admirable and enviable in man. With his personal beauty and his princely air
  and his popularity and talent, I used to think my father must be perfectly
  happy. And now to find that he too had been living with a worm at his heart!
  But then he had done wrong, and he suffered rightly, as he himself confessed,
  for the sins of his youth. And I tried to think myself unjustly treated; for
  of what crimes had I been guilty, that I should suffer too? My short life had
  been blameless, orderly, and dutiful. Little evil had I done; but even then
  my conscience whispered&mdash;Much good had I left undone. I had lived for
  myself and my own affections; I had not trained my mind for a career of
  usefulness to my fellow-men. It is not enough that a human being should
  abstain from gross, palpable evil; he must follow actual good. It is better
  to go down into the market, and run your chance of the dirt that shall soil
  it, and the hands it shall pass through, in making your one talent ten
  talents, than to hide it up in a napkin, and stand aloof from your
  fellow-creatures, even though it should give you cause, like the Pharisee, to
  "thank God that you are not as other men are."</p>

  <p>"Steady, Bold! Heel, good dog, heel! You hear them shooting, I know, and
  you would like well to join the sport. Bang! bang! there they go again. It is
  Sir Harry and his guest at their favourite amusement. We will stay here, old
  dog, and perhaps we may see her once more, if only at a distance, and we
  shall not have had our walk for nothing." So Bold and I crouched quietly down
  amongst the tall fern, on a knoll in the park from whence we could see the
  Manor House and the mere, and Constance's favourite walk in the shrubbery
  which I had paced with her so often and so happily in days that seemed now to
  have belonged to another life.</p>

  <p>They were having capital sport in the island; it was a favourite preserve
  of Sir Harry; and although artificially stocked with pheasants&mdash;as
  indeed what coverts are not, for that most artificial of all field-sports
  which we call a <i>battue</i>?&mdash;it had this advantage, that the game
  could not possibly stray from its own feeding-place and home. Moreover, as
  the fine-plumaged old cocks went whirring up out of the copse, there was a
  great art in knocking them over before they were fairly on the wing, so that
  the dead birds might not fall into the water, but be picked up on <i>terra
  firma</i>, dry, and in good order to be put into the bag. Many a time had I
  stood in the middle ride, and brought them down right and left, to the
  admiration of my old acquaintance, Mr. Barrells, and the applause of Sir
  Harry. Many a happy day had I spent there, in the enjoyment of scenery, air,
  exercise, and sport (not that I cared much for the latter); but, above all,
  with the prospect of Constance Beverley bringing us our luncheon, or, at the
  worst, the certainty of seeing her on our return to the Manor House. How my
  heart ached to think it was all gone and past now!</p>

  <p>I watched the smoke from the sportsmen's guns as it curled up into the
  peaceful autumn sky. I heard the cheery voices of the beaters, and the tap of
  their sticks in the copse; but I could not see a soul, and was myself
  completely unseen. I felt I was looking on what had so long been my paradise
  for the last time, and I lost the consciousness of my own identity in the
  dreamy abstraction with which I regarded all around. It seemed to me as if
  another had gone through the experiences of my past life, or rather as if I
  was no longer Vere Egerton, but one who had known him and pitied him, and
  would take some little interest in him for the future, but would probably see
  very little of him again. I know not whether other men experience such
  strange fancies, or whether it is but the natural effect of continued sorrow,
  which stuns the mental sense, even as continued pain numbs that of the body;
  but I have often felt myself retracing my own past or speculating on my own
  future, almost with the indifference of an uninterested spectator. Something
  soon recalled me to myself. Bold had the eye of a hawk, but I saw her before
  Bold did; long ere my dog erected his silken ears and stopped his panting
  breath, my beating heart and throbbing pulses made me feel too keenly that I
  was Vere Egerton again.</p>

  <p>She seemed to walk more slowly than she used; the step was not so light;
  the head no longer carried so erect, so naughtily; she had lost the deer-like
  motion I admired so fondly; but oh! how much better I loved to see her like
  this. I watched as a man watches all he loves for the <i>last</i> time. I
  strove, so to speak, to print her image on my brain, there to be carried a
  life-long photograph. She walked slowly down towards the mere, her head
  drooping, her hands clasped before her, apparently deep, deep in her own
  thoughts. I would have given all I had in the world could I but have known
  what those thoughts were. She stopped at the very place where once before she
  had caressed Bold; she gathered a morsel of fern and placed it in her bosom;
  then she walked on faster, like one who wakes from a train of profound and
  not altogether happy reflections.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile I had the greatest difficulty in restraining my dog. Good,
  faithful Bold was all anxiety to scour off at first sight of her, and greet
  his old friend. He whined piteously when I forbade him. I thought she must
  have heard him; but no, she walked quietly on towards the water, loosed her
  little skiff from its moorings, got into it, and pushed off on the smooth
  surface of the mere.</p>

  <p>She spread the tiny sail, and the boat rippled its way slowly through the
  water. The little skiff was a favourite toy of Constance, and I had taught
  her to manage it very dexterously. At the most it would hold but two people;
  and many an hour of ecstasy had I passed on the mere in "The Queen Mab," as
  we sportively named it, drinking in every look and tone of my idolised
  companion: poison was in the draught, I knew it well, and yet I drank it to
  the dregs. Now I watched till my eyes watered, for I should never steer "The
  Queen Mab" again.</p>

  <p>A shout from the shore of the island diverted my attention. Sir Harry had
  evidently espied her, and was welcoming his daughter. I made out his figure,
  and that of Barrells, at the water's edge; whilst the report of a gun, and a
  thin column of white smoke curling upwards from the copse, betokened the
  presence of Ropsley among the beaters in the covert. When I glanced again at
  "The Queen Mab," it struck me she had made but little way, though her
  gossamer-looking sail was filled by the light breeze. She could not now be
  more than a hundred and fifty yards from her moorings, whilst I was myself
  perhaps twice that distance from the brink of the mere. Constance rises from
  her seat, and waves her hand above her head. Is that her voice? Bold hears it
  too, and starts up to listen. The white sail leans over. God in heaven! it is
  down! Vivid like lightning the ghastly truth flashes through my brain; the
  boat is waterlogged&mdash;she is sinking&mdash;my heart's darling will be
  drowned in my very sight; it is ecstasy to think I can die with her, if I
  cannot save her!</p>

  <p>"Bold! Bold! Hie, boy; go fetch her; hie, boy; hie!"</p>

  <p>The dog is already at the water-side; with his glorious, God-given
  instinct he has understood it all. I hear the splash as he dashes in; I see
  the circles thrown behind him as he swims; whilst I am straining every nerve
  to reach the water's edge. What a long three hundred yards it is! A lifetime
  passes before me as I speed along. I have even leisure to think of poor
  Ophelia and her glorious Dane. As I run I fling away coat, waistcoat, watch,
  and handkerchief. I see a white dress by the side of the white sail. My
  gallant dog is nearing it even now. The next instant I am overhead in the
  mere; and as I rise to the surface, shaking the water from my lips and hair,
  I feel, through all my fear and all my suspense, something akin to triumph in
  the long, vigorous strokes that are shooting me onwards to my goal. Mute and
  earnest I thank God for my personal strength, never appreciated till this
  day; for my hardy education, and my father's swimming lessons in the
  sluggish, far-away Theiss; for my gallant, faithful dog, who has reached her
  even now.</p>

  <p>"Hold on, Bold! her dress is floating her still. Hold on, good dog.
  Another ten seconds, and she is saved!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Once I thought we were gone. My strength was exhausted. I
  had reached the bank with my rescued love. Her pale face was close to mine;
  her long, wet hair across my mouth; she was conscious still, she never lost
  her senses or her courage. Once she whispered, "Bless you, my brave Vere."
  But the bank was steep, and the water out of our depth to the very edge. A
  root I caught at gave way. My overtaxed muscles refused to second me. It was
  hard to fail at the last. I could have saved myself had I abandoned my hold.
  It was delicious to know this, and then to wind my arm tighter round her
  waist, and to think we should sleep together for ever down there; but honest
  Bold grasped her once more in those vigorous jaws&mdash;she bore the marks of
  his teeth on her white neck for many a day. The relief thus afforded enabled
  me to make one desperate effort, and we were saved.</p>

  <p>She fainted away when she was fairly on the bank; and I was so exhausted I
  could but lie gasping at her side. Bold gave himself a vigorous shake and
  licked her face. Assistance, however, was near at hand; the accident had been
  witnessed from the island; Sir Harry and the keeper had shoved off
  immediately in their boat, and pulled vigorously for the spot. It was a
  heavy, lumbering craft, and they must have been too late. Oh, selfish heart!
  I felt that had I not succeeded in saving her, I had rather we had both
  remained under those peaceful waters; but selfish though it may have been,
  was it not ecstasy to think that I had rescued <i>her</i>&mdash;Constance
  Beverley, my own Constance&mdash;from death? I, the ungainly, unattractive
  man, for whom I used to think no woman could ever care; and she had called me
  "<i>her</i> brave Vere!" HERS! She could not unsay that; come what would,
  nothing could rob me of <i>that</i>. "Fortune, do thy worst," I thought, in
  my thrill of delight, as I recalled those words, "I am happy for evermore."
  Blind! blind! <i>Quem Deus vult perdere prius dementat</i>.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI. &mdash; PRINCESS VOCQSAL</h2>

  <p class="first">It was an accommodating <i>m&eacute;nage</i>, that of
Prince and
  Princess Vocqsal, and was carried on upon the same system, whether they were
  "immured," as Madame la Princesse called it, in the old chateau near
  Sieberiburgen, or disporting themselves, as now, in the sunshine and gaiety
  of <i>her</i> dear Paris, as the same volatile lady was pleased to term that
  very lively resort of the gay, the idle, and the good-for-nothing. It was the
  sort of <i>m&eacute;nage</i> people do not understand in England quite so
thoroughly
  as abroad; the system was simple enough&mdash;"live and let live" being in
  effect the motto of an ill-matched pair, who had better never have come
  together, but who, having done so, resolved to make the best of that which
  each found to be a bad bargain, and to see less of each other than they could
  possibly have done had they remained as formerly, simply an old cousin and a
  young one, instead of as now, husband and wife.</p>

  <p>Prince Vocqsal was the best of fellows, and the most sporting of
  Hungarians. Time was, "before the Revolution, <i>mon cher</i>"&mdash;a good
  while before it, he might have added&mdash;that the Prince was the handsomest
  man of his day, and not indisposed to use his personal advantages for the
  captivation of the opposite sex. His conquests, as he called them, in France,
  Spain, Italy, not to mention the Fatherland, were, by his own account, second
  only to those of Don Juan in the charming opera which bears the name of that
  libertine; but his greatest triumph was to detail, in strict confidence, of
  course, how he had met with <i>un grand succes</i> amongst <i>ces belles
  blondes Anglaises</i>, whose characters he was good enough to take away with
  a sweeping liberality calculated to alter a Briton's preconceived notions as
  to the propriety of those prudish dames whom he had hitherto been proud to
  call his countrywomen. I cannot say I consider myself bound to believe all an
  old gentleman, or a young one either, has to say on that score. Men are given
  to lying, and woman is an enigma better let alone. The Prince, however, clung
  stoutly to his fascinations, long after time, good living, and field-sports
  had changed him from a slim, romantic swain to a jolly, roundabout old
  gentleman. He dyed his moustaches and whiskers, wore a belt patented to check
  corpulency, and made up for the ravages of decay by the artifices of the
  toilet. He could ride extremely well (for a foreigner), not in the break-neck
  style which hunting men in England call "going," and which none except an
  Englishman ever succeeds in attaining; but gracefully, and like a gentleman.
  He could shoot with the rifle or the smooth-bore with an accuracy not to be
  surpassed, and was an "ace-of-diamonds man" with the pistol. Notwithstanding
  the many times his amours had brought him "on the ground," it was his chief
  boast that he had never killed his man. "I am sure of my <i>coup</i>, my
  dear," he would say, with an amiable smile, and holding you affectionately by
  the arm, "and I always take my antagonist just below the knee-pan. I sight a
  little over the ankle, and the rise of the ball at twelve paces hits the
  exact spot. There is no occasion to repeat my fire, and he lives to be my
  friend."</p>

  <p>Added to this he was a thorough <i>bon vivant</i>, and an excellent
  linguist. On all matters connected with field-sports he held forth in
  English, swearing hideously, under the impression that on these topics the
  use of frightful oaths was national and appropriate. He was past middle age,
  healthy, good-humoured, full of fun, and he did not care a straw for Princess
  Vocqsal.</p>

  <p>Why did he marry her? The reason was simple enough. Hunting, shooting,
  horse-racing, gaiety, hospitality, love, life, and libertinism, will make a
  hole in the finest fortune that ever was inherited, even in Hungary; and
  Prince Vocqsal found himself at middle age, or what he called the prime of
  life, with all the tastes of his youth as strong as ever, but none of its
  ready money left. He looked in the glass, and felt that even he must at
  length succumb to fate.</p>

  <p>"My cousin Rose is rich; she is moreover young and beautiful; <i>une femme
  tr&egrave;s distingu&eacute;e et tant soit peu coquette</i>. I must
sacrifice myself, and
  Comtesse Rose shall become Princess Vocqsal." Such was the fruit of the
  Prince's reflections, and it is but justice to add he made a most
  accommodating and good-humoured husband.</p>

  <p>Comtesse Rose had no objection to being Princess Vocqsal. A thousand
  flirtations and at least half-a-dozen <i>grandes passions</i>, had a little
  tarnished the freshness of her youthful beauty; but what she had lost in
  bloom she had gained in experience. Nobody had such a figure, so round, so
  shapely, of such exquisite proportions; nobody knew so well how to dress that
  figure to the greatest advantage. Her gloves were a study; and as for her
  feet and ankles, their perfection was only equalled by the generosity with
  which they were displayed. Then what accomplishments, what talents! She could
  sing, she could ride, she could waltz; she could play billiards, smoke
  cigarettes, drive four horses, shoot with a pistol, and talk sentiment from
  the depths of a low <i>fauteuil</i> like a very Sappho. Her lovers had
  compared her at different times to nearly all the heroines of antiquity,
  except Diana. She had been painted in every costume, flattered in every
  language, and slandered in every boudoir throughout Europe for a good many
  years; and still she was bright, and fresh, and sparkling, as if Old Time too
  could not resist her fascinations, but, like any other elderly gentleman,
  gave her her own way, and waited patiently for his turn. Thrice happy
  Princess Vocqsal!&mdash;can it be possible that you, too, are bored?</p>

  <p>She sits in her own magnificent <i>salon</i>, where once every week she
  "receives" all the most distinguished people in Paris. How blooming she looks
  with her back to the light, and her little feet crossed upon that low
  footstool. Last night she had "a reception," and it was gayer and more
  crowded than usual. Why did she feel a little dull to-day? Pooh! it was only
  a <i>migraine</i>, or the last French novel was so insufferably stupid;
  or&mdash;no, it was the want of excitement. She could not live without that
  stimulus&mdash;excitement she must and would have. She had tried politics,
  but the strong immovable will at the head of the Government had given her a
  hint that she must put a stop to <i>that</i>; and she knew his inflexible
  character too well to venture on trifling with <i>him</i>. She was tired of
  all her lovers, too; she began to think, if her husband were only thirty
  years younger, and less good-humoured, he would be worth a dozen of these
  modern adorers. <i>That</i> Count de Rohan, to be sure, was a good-looking
  boy, and seemed utterly fancy free. By-the-bye, he was not at the "reception"
  last night, though she asked him herself the previous evening at "the
  Tuileries." That was very rude; positively she must teach him better manners.
  A countryman, too; it was a duty to be civil to him. And a fresh character to
  study, it would be good sport to subjugate him. Probably he would call to-day
  to apologise for being so remiss. And she rose and looked in the glass at
  those eyes whose power needed not to be enhanced by the dexterous touch of
  rouge; at that long, glossy hair, and shapely neck and bosom, as a sportsman
  examines the locks and barrels of the weapon on which he depends for his
  success in the chase. The review was satisfactory, and Princess Vocqsal did
  not look at all bored now. She had hardly settled herself once more in a
  becoming attitude, ere Monsieur le Comte de Rohan was announced, and marched
  in, hat in hand, with all the grace of his natural demeanour, and the frank,
  happy air that so seldom survives boyhood. Victor was handsomer than ever,
  brimful of life and spirits, utterly devoid of all conceit or affectation;
  and moreover, since his father's death, one of the first noblemen of Hungary.
  It was a conquest worth making.</p>

  <p>"I thought you would not go back without wishing me good-bye," said the
  Princess, with her sweetest smile, and a blush through her rouge that she
  could summon at command&mdash;indeed, this weapon had done more execution
  than all the rest of her artillery put together. "I missed you last night at
  my reception; why did you not come?"</p>

  <p>Victor blushed too. How could he explain that a little supper-party at
  which some very fascinating ladies who were not of the Princess's
  acquaintance had <i>assisted</i>, prevented him. He stammered out some excuse
  about leaving Paris immediately, and having to make preparations for
  departure.</p>

  <p>"And you are really going," said she, in a melancholy, pleading tone of
  voice,&mdash;"going back to my dear Hungary. How I wish I could accompany
  you."</p>

  <p>"Nothing could be easier," answered Victor, laughing gaily; "if madame
  would but condescend to accept my escort, I would wait her convenience. Say,
  Princess, when shall it be?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, now you are joking," she said, looking at him from under her long
  eyelashes; "you know I cannot leave Paris, and you know that we poor women
  cannot do what we like. It is all very well for you men; you get your
  passports, and you are off to the end of the world, whilst we can but sit
  over our work and think."</p>

  <p>Here a deep sigh smote on Victor's ear. It began to strike him that he had
  made an impression; the feeling is very pleasant at first, and the young
  Hungarian was keenly alive to it. He spoke in a much softer tone now, and
  drew his chair a little nearer that of the Princess.</p>

  <p>"I need not go quite yet," he said, in an embarrassed tone, which
  contrasted strongly with his frank manner a few minutes earlier: "Paris is
  very pleasant, and&mdash;and&mdash;there are so many people here one
  likes."</p>

  <p>"And that like you," she interrupted, with an arch smile, that made her
  look more charming than ever. "One is so seldom happy," she added, relapsing
  once more into her melancholy air; "one meets so seldom with kindred
  spirits&mdash;people that understand one; it is like a dream to be allowed to
  associate with those who are really pleasing to us. A happy, happy dream; but
  then the waking is so bitter, perhaps it is wiser not to dream at all. No!
  Monsieur de Rohan, you had better go back to Hungary, as you proposed."</p>

  <p>"Not if you tell me to stay," exclaimed Victor, his eyes brightening, and
  his colour rising rapidly; "not if I can be of the slightest use or interest
  to you. Only tell me what you wish me to do, madame; your word shall be my
  law. Go or stay, I wait but for your commands."</p>

  <p>He was getting on faster than she had calculated; it was time to damp him
  a little now. She withdrew her chair a foot or so, and answered
  coldly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;I, Monsieur le Comte? I cannot possibly give you any command,
  except to ring that bell. The Prince would like to see you before you go. Let
  the Prince know Monsieur de Rohan is here," she added, to the servant who
  answered her summons. "You were always a great favourite of his&mdash;of
  <i>ours</i>, I may say;" and she bade him adieu, and gave him her soft white
  hand with all her former sweetness of manner; and told her servant, loud
  enough for her victim to hear, "to order the carriage, for she meant to drive
  in the Bois de Boulogne:" and finally shot a Parthian glance at him over her
  shoulder as she left the room by one door, whilst he proceeded by another
  towards the Prince's apartments.</p>

  <p>No wonder Victor de Rohan quitted the house not so wise a man as he had
  entered it; no wonder he was seen that same afternoon caracolling his bay
  horse in the Bois de Boulogne; no wonder he went to dress moody and out of
  humour, because, ride where he would, he had failed to catch a single glimpse
  of the known carriage and liveries of Princess Vocqsal.</p>

  <p>They met, however, the following evening at a concert at the Tuileries.
  The day after&mdash;oh, what good luck!&mdash;he sat next her at dinner at
  the English ambassador's, and put her into her carriage at night when she
  went home. Poor Victor! he dreamed of her white dress and floating hair, and
  the pressure of her gloved hand. Breakfast next morning was not half so
  important a meal as it used to be, and he thought the fencing-school would be
  a bore. She was rapidly getting the upper hand of young Count de Rohan.</p>

  <p>Six weeks afterwards he was still in Paris. The gardens of the Tuileries
  were literally sparkling in the morning sun of a bright Parisian day. The
  Zouaves on guard at the gate lounged over their firelocks with their usual
  reckless brigand air, and leered under every bonnet that passed them, as
  though the latter accomplishment were part and parcel of a Zouave's duty. The
  Rue de Rivoli was alive with carriages; the sky, the houses, the gilt-topped
  railings&mdash;everything looked in full dress, as it does nowhere but in
  Paris; the very flowers in the gardens were two shades brighter than in any
  other part of France. All the children looked clean, all the women well
  dressed; even the very trees had on their most becoming costume, and the long
  close alleys smelt fresh and delicious as the gardens of Paradise. Why should
  Victor de Rohan alone look gloomy and morose when all else is so bright and
  fair? Why does he puff so savagely at his cigar, and glance so restlessly
  under the stems of those thick-growing chestnuts? Why does he mutter between
  his teeth, "False, unfeeling! the third time she has played me this trick?
  No, it is not she. Oh! I should know her a mile off. She will not come. She
  has no heart, no pity. She will <i>not</i> come. <i>Sappramento!</i> there
  she is!"</p>

  <p>In the most becoming of morning toilettes, with the most killing little
  bonnet at the back of her glossy head, the best-fitting of gloves, and the
  tiniest of <i>chaussures</i>, without a lock out of its place or a fold
  rumpled, cool, composed, and beautiful, leaving her maid to amuse herself
  with a penny chair and a <i>feuilleton</i>, Princess Vocqsal walks up to the
  agitated Hungarian, and placing her hand in his, says, in her most bewitching
  accents, "Forgive me, my friend; I have risked so much to come here; I could
  not get away a moment sooner. I have passed the last hour in such agony of
  suspense!" The time to which the lady alludes has been spent, and well spent,
  in preparing the brilliant and effective appearance which she is now
  making.</p>

  <p>"But you have come at last," exclaims Victor, breathlessly. "I may now
  speak to you for the first time alone. Oh, what happiness to see you again!
  All this week I have been so wretched without you; and why were you never at
  home when I called?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Les convenances</i>, my dear Count," answers the lady. "Everything I
  do is watched and known. Only last night I was taxed by Madame
d'Alen&ccedil;on
  about you, and I could not help showing my confusion; and you&mdash;you are
  so foolish. What must people think?"</p>

  <p>"Let them think what they will," breaks in Victor, his honest truthful
  face pale with excitement. "I am yours, and yours alone. Ever since I have
  known you, Princess, I have felt that you might do with me what you will. Now
  I am your slave. I offer you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>What Victor was about to offer never came to light, for at that instant
  the well-tutored "Jeannette" rose from her chair, and hurriedly approaching
  her mistress, whispered to her a few agitated words. The Princess dropped her
  veil, squeezed Victor's hand, and in another instant disappeared amongst the
  trees, leaving the young Hungarian very much in love, very much bewildered,
  and not a little disgusted.</p>

  <p>One or two more such scenes, one or two more weeks of alternate delight,
  suspense, and disappointment, made poor Victor half beside himself. He had
  got into the hands of an accomplished flirt, and for nine men out of ten
  there would have been no more chance of escape than there is for the moth who
  has once fluttered within the magic ring of a ground-glass lamp. He may buzz
  and flap and fume as he will, but the more he flutters the more he singes his
  wings, the greater his struggles the less his likelihood of liberty. But
  Victor was at that age when a man most appreciates his own value: a few years
  earlier we want confidence, a few years later we lack energy, but in the
  hey-day of youth we do not easily surrender at discretion; besides, we have
  so many to console us, and we are so easily consoled. De Rohan began to feel
  hurt, then angry, lastly resolute. One night at the opera decided him. His
  box had a mirror in it so disposed as to reflect the interior of the
  adjoining one; a most unfair and reprehensible practice, by-the-bye, and one
  calculated to lead to an immensity of discord. What he saw he never
  proclaimed, but as Princess Vocqsal occupied the box adjoining his own, it is
  fair to suppose that he watched the movements of his mistress.</p>

  <p>She bit her lip, and drew her features together as if she had been stung,
  when on the following afternoon, in the Bois de Boulogne, Vicomte Lascar
  informed her, with his insipid smile, that he had that morning met De Rohan
  at the railway station, evidently en route for Hungary, adding, for the
  Princess was an excellent linguist, and Lascar prided himself much on his
  English, "'Ome, sweet 'ome, no place like 'ome."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII. &mdash; THE COMMON LOT</h2>

  <p class="first">"And so, you see, my dear Egerton, it is out of the
  question. I own to a great liking for your character. I think you behaved
  yesterday like a trump. I am too old for romance, and all that, but I can
  understand your feeling, my boy, and I am sorry for you. The objection I have
  named would alone be sufficient. Let it never be mentioned again. Your father
  was my oldest friend, and I hope you will not think it necessary to break
  with us; but marriage is a serious affair, and indeed is not to be thought
  of."</p>

  <p>"No hope, Sir Harry?" I gasped out; "years hence, if I could win fame,
  distinction, throw a cloak of honour over this accursed brand, give her a
  name to be proud of, is there no hope?"</p>

  <p>"None," replied Sir Harry; "these things are better settled at once. It is
  far wiser not to delude yourself into the notion that, because you are a
  disappointed man now, you are destined to become a great one hereafter.
  Greatness grows, Vere, just like a cabbage or a cauliflower, and must be
  tended and cultivated with years of labour and perseverance; you cannot pluck
  it down with one spring, like an apple from a bough. No, no, my lad; you will
  get over this disappointment, and be all the better for it. I am sorry to
  refuse you, but I must, Vere, distinctly, and for the last time. Besides, I
  tell you in confidence, I have other views for Constance, so you see it is
  totally out of the question. You may see her this afternoon, if you like. She
  is a good child, and will do nothing in disobedience to her father. Farewell,
  Vere, I am sorry for you, but the thing's done."</p>

  <p>So I walked out of the Baronet's room in the unenviable character of a
  disappointed suitor, and he went back to his farm book and his trainer's
  accounts, as coolly as if he had just been dismissing a domestic; whilst
  I&mdash;my misery was greater than I could bear&mdash;his last words seemed
  to scorch me. "I should get over it&mdash;I should be the better for it." And
  I felt all the time that my heart was breaking; and then, "he had other views
  for Constance;" not only must she never be mine, but I must suffer the
  additional pang of feeling that she belongs to another. "Would to God," I
  thought, "that we had sunk together yesterday, never to rise again!"</p>

  <p>I went to look for her in the shrubbery: I knew where I should find her;
  there was an old summer-house that we two had sat in many a time before, and
  I felt sure Constance would be there. She rose as I approached it: she must
  have seen by my face that it was all over. She put her hand in mine, and,
  totally unmanned, I bent my head over it, and burst into a flood of tears,
  like a child. I remember to this day the very pattern of the gown she wore;
  even now I seem to hear the soft, gentle accents in which she reasoned and
  pleaded with me, and strove to mitigate my despair.</p>

  <p>"I have long thought it must come to this, Vere," she said, with her dark,
  melancholy eyes looking into my very soul; "I have long thought we have both
  been much to blame, you to speak, and I to listen, as we have done: now we
  have our punishment. Vere, I will not conceal from you I suffer much. More
  for your sake than my own. I cannot bear to see you so miserable. You to whom
  I owe so much, so many happy hours, and yesterday my very life. Oh, Vere, try
  to bear it like a man."</p>

  <p>"I cannot, I cannot," I sobbed out; "no hope, nothing to look forward to,
  but a cheerless, weary life, and then to be forgotten. Oh that I had died
  with you, Constance, my beloved one, my own!"</p>

  <p>She laid her hand gently on my arm&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Forgotten, Vere," she said; "that is not a kind or a generous speech. I
  shall never forget you. Always, always I shall think of you, pray for you.
  Papa knows best what is right. I will never disobey him: he has not forbidden
  us to see each other; we may be very happy still. Vere, you must be my
  brother."</p>

  <p>"No more," I exclaimed, reproachfully, "no more?"</p>

  <p>"No more, Vere," she answered, quite gently, but in a tone that admitted
  of no further appeal. "Brother and sister, Vere, for the rest of our lives;
  promise me this," and she put her soft hand in mine, and smiled upon me; pure
  and sorrowful, like an angel.</p>

  <p>I was stung to madness by her seeming coldness, so different from my own
  wild, passionate misery.</p>

  <p>"Be it so," I said; "and as brother and sister must part, so must you and
  I. Anything now for freedom and repose; anything to drive your image from my
  mind. I tell you that from henceforth I am a desperate man. Nobody cares for
  me on earth,&mdash;no father, no mother, none for whom to live; and the one I
  prized most discards me now. Constance, you never can have loved me as I have
  loved. Cold, heartless, false! I will never see you again."</p>

  <p>She was quite bewildered by my vehemence. She looked round wildly at me,
  and her pale lip quivered, and her eyes filled with tears: even then I
  remained bitter and unmoved.</p>

  <p>"Farewell," I said, "farewell, Constance, and for ever."</p>

  <p>Her hand hung passively in mine, her "good-bye" seemed frozen on her lips;
  but she turned away with more than her usual majesty, and walked towards the
  house. I remarked that she dropped a white rose&mdash;fit emblem of her own
  dear self&mdash;on the gravel path, as she paced slowly along, without once
  turning her head. I was too proud to follow her and pick it up, but sprang
  away in an opposite direction, and was soon out of her sight.</p>

  <p>That night, when the wild clouds were flying across the moon, and the wind
  howled through the gloomy yews and the ghostly fir-trees, and all was sad and
  dreary and desolate, I picked up the white rose from that gravel path, and
  placed it next my heart. Faded, shrunk, and withered, I have got it still. My
  home was now no place for me. I arranged my few affairs with small
  difficulty, pensioned the two old servants my poor father had committed to my
  charge; set my house in order, packed up my things, and in less than a week I
  was many hundred miles from Alton Grange and Constance Beverley.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII. &mdash; OMAR PASHA</h2>

  <p class="first">It is high noon, and not a sound, save the occasional snort
  of an impatient steed, is to be heard throughout the lines. Picketed in rows,
  the gallant little chargers of the Turkish cavalry are dozing away the hours
  between morning and evening feed. The troopers themselves are smoking and
  sleeping in their tents; here and there may be seen a devout Mussulman
  prostrate on his prayer-carpet, his face turned towards Mecca, and his
  thoughts wholly abstracted from all worldly considerations. Ill-fed and worse
  paid, they are nevertheless a brawny, powerful race, their broad rounded
  shoulders, bull necks, and bowed legs denoting strength rather than activity;
  whilst their high features and marked swarthy countenances betray at once
  their origin, sprung from generations of warriors who once threatened to
  overwhelm the whole Western world in a tide that has now been long since at
  the ebb. Patient are they of hardship, and devoted to the Sultan and their
  duty, made for soldiers and nothing else, with their fierce, dogged
  resolution, and their childish obedience and simplicity. Hand-in-hand, two of
  them are strolling leisurely through the lines to release a restive little
  horse who has got inexplicably entangled in his own and his neighbour's
  picket-ropes, and is fighting his way out of his difficulty with teeth and
  hoofs. They do not hurry themselves, but converse peacefully as they pass
  along.</p>

  <p>"Is is true, Mustapha, that <i>Giaours</i> are still coming to join our
  Bey? The Padisha[#] is indeed gracious to these sons of perdition."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[#] The Sultan.</p>

  <p>"It is true, Janum;[#] may Allah confound them!" replies Mustapha,
  spitting in parenthesis between his teeth: "but they have brave hearts, these
  Giaours, and cunning heads, moreover, for their own devices. What good Moslem
  would have thought of sending his commands by wire, faster than they could be
  borne by the horses of the Prophet?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[#] "Oh my soul!" a colloquial term equivalent to the
  French "Mon cher."</p>

  <p>"Magic!" argues the other trooper; "black, unholy magic! There is but one
  Allah!"</p>

  <p>"What filth are you eating?" answers Mustapha, who is of a practical turn
  of mind. "Have not I myself seen the wire and the post, and do I not know
  that the Padisha sends his commands to the Ferik-Pasha by the letters he
  writes with his own hand?"</p>

  <p>"But you have never seen the letter," urges his comrade, "though you have
  ridden a hundred times under the lines."</p>

  <p>"Oh, mulehead, and son of a jackass!" retorts Mustapha, "do you not know
  that the letter flies so fast along the wire, that the eye of man cannot
  perceive it? They are dogs and accursed, these Giaours; but, by my head, they
  are very foxes in wit."</p>

  <p>"I will defile their graves," observes his comrade; and forthwith they
  proceeded to release the entangled charger, who has by this time nearly eaten
  his ill-starred neighbour; and I overhear this philosophical disquisition, as
  I proceed for orders to the Green Tent of Iskender Bey, commandant of the
  small force of cavalry attached to Omar Pasha's army in Bulgaria.</p>

  <p>As I enter the tent, I perceive two men seated in grave discussion, whilst
  a third stands upright in a respectful attitude. A <i>chaoosh</i>, or
  Serjeant, is walking a magnificently caparisoned bay Arab up and down, just
  beyond the tent-pegs; while an escort of lancers, with two or three more led
  horses, and a brace of English pointers, are standing a few paces off. The
  upright figure, though dressed in a Turkish uniform, with a red fez or
  skull-cap, I have no difficulty in recognising as Victor de Rohan. He grasps
  my hand as I pass, and whispers a few words in French, while I salute
  Iskender Bey, and await his orders.</p>

  <p>My chief is more than three parts drunk. He has already finished the best
  portion of a bottle of brandy, and is all for fighting, right or wrong, as,
  to do him justice, is his invariable inclination. To and fro he waves his
  half-grizzled head, and sawing the air with his right hand, mutilated of half
  its fingers by a blow from a Russian sabre, he repeats in German&mdash;</p>

  <p>"But the attack! Excellency; the attack! when will you let me loose with
  my cavalry? The attack! Excellency! the attack!"</p>

  <p>The person he addresses looks at him with a half-amused, half-provoked
  air, and then glancing at Victor, breaks into a covert smile, which he
  conceals by bending over a map that is stretched before him. I have ample
  time to study his appearance, and to wonder why I should have a sort of vague
  impression that I have seen that countenance before.</p>

  <p>He is a spare, sinewy man, above the middle height, with his figure
  developed and toughened by constant exercise. An excellent horseman, a
  practised shot, an adept at all field-sports, he looks as if no labour would
  tire him, no hardships affect his vigour or his health. His small head is set
  on his shoulders in the peculiar manner that always denotes physical
  strength; and his well-cut features would be handsome, were it not for a
  severe and somewhat caustic expression which mars the beauty of his
  countenance. His deep-set eye is very bright and keen; its glance seems
  accustomed to command, and also to detect falsehood under a threefold mask.
  He has not dealt half a lifetime with Asiatics to fail in acquiring that
  useful knack. He wears his beard and moustache short and close; they are</p>

  <p class="verse">Grizzled here and there,<br>
  But more with toil than age,</p>

  <p class="first">and add to his soldierlike exterior. His dress is simple
  enough; it consists of a close-fitting, dark-green frock, adorned only with
  the order of the Medjidjie, high riding-boots, and a crimson fez. A curved
  Turkish sabre hangs from his belt, and a double-barrelled gun of English
  workmanship is thrown across his knees. As he looks up from his map, his eye
  rests on me, and he asks Victor in German, "Who is that?"</p>

  <p>"An Englishman, who has joined your Excellency's force as an Interpreter,"
  answered my friend, "and who is now attached to Iskender Bey. I believe the
  Bey can give a good account of his gallantry on more than one occasion."</p>

  <p>"The Bey," thus appealed to, musters up a drunken smile, and observes, "A
  good swordsman, your Excellency, and a man of many languages. Sober too," he
  adds, shaking his head, "sober as a Mussulman, the first quality in a
  soldier."</p>

  <p>His Excellency smiles again at Victor, who presents me in due form, not
  forgetting to mention my name.</p>

  <p>The great man almost starts. He fixes on me that glittering eye which
  seems to look through me. "Where did you acquire your knowledge of
  languages?" he asks. "My aide-de-camp informs me you speak Hungarian even
  better than you do Turkish."</p>

  <p>"I travelled much in Hungary as a boy, Excellency," was my reply. "Victor
  de Rohan is my earliest friend: I was a child scarcely out of the nursery
  when I first made his acquaintance at Edeldorf."</p>

  <p>A gleam of satisfaction passed over his Excellency's face. "Strange,
  strange," he muttered, "how the wheel turns;" and then pulling out a small
  steel purse, but slenderly garnished, he selected from a few other coins an
  old silver piece, worn quite smooth and bent double. "Do you remember that?"
  said he, placing it in my hand.</p>

  <p>The gipsy troop and the deserter flashed across me at once. I was so
  confused at my own stupidity in not having recognised him sooner, that I
  could only stammer out, "Pardon, your Excellency&mdash;so long ago&mdash;a
  mere child."</p>

  <p>He grasped my hand warmly. "Egerton," said he, "boy as you were, there was
  heart and honour in your deed. Subordinate as I then was, I swore never to
  forget it. I have never forgotten it. You have made a friend for life in Omar
  Pasha."</p>

  <p>I could only bow my thanks, and the General added, "Come to me at
  head-quarters this afternoon. I will see what can be done for you."</p>

  <p>"But, Excellency, I cannot spare him," interposed Iskender Bey. "I have
  here an English officer, the bravest of the brave, but so stupid I cannot
  understand a word he says. I had rather be without sword or lance than lose
  my Interpreter. And then, Excellency, the attack to-morrow&mdash;the
  attack."</p>

  <p>Omar Pasha rose to depart. "I will send him back this evening with
  despatches," said he, saluting his host in the Turkish fashion, touching
  first the heart, then the mouth, then the forehead&mdash;a courtesy which the
  old fire-eater returned with a ludicrous attempt at solemnity.</p>

  <p>"De Rohan," he added, "stay here to carry out the orders I have given you.
  As soon as your friend can be spared from the Bey, bring him over with you,
  to remain at head-quarters. Salaam!" And the General was on his horse and
  away long before the Turkish guard could get under arms to pay him the proper
  compliments, leaving Iskender Bey to return to his brandy-bottle, and my old
  friend Victor to make himself comfortable in my tent, and smoke a quiet
  chibouque with me whilst we related all that had passed since we met.</p>

  <p>Victor was frank and merry as usual, spoke unreservedly of his
  <i>liaison</i> with Princess Vocqsal, and the reasons which had decided him
  on seeing a campaign with the Turkish army against his natural enemies, the
  Russians.</p>

  <p>"I like it, <i>mon cher</i>," said he, puffing at his chibouque, and
  talking in the mixture of French and English which seemed his natural
  language, and in which he always affirmed <i>he thought</i>. "There is
  liberty, there is excitement, there is the chance of distinction; and above
  all, there are <i>no women</i>. It suits my temperament, <i>mon cher:
  voyez-vous, je suis philosophe</i>. I like to change my bivouac day by day,
  to attach myself to my horses, to have no tie but that which binds me to my
  sabre, no anxieties but for what I shall get to eat. The General does all the
  thinking&mdash;<i>parbleu!</i> he does it <i>&agrave; merveille</i>; and
  I&mdash;why, I laugh and I ride away. Fill my chibouque again, and hand me
  that flask; I think there is a drop left in it. Your health, Vere, <i>mon
  enfant</i>, and <i>vive la guerre</i>!"</p>

  <p>"<i>Vive la guerre!</i>" I repeated; but the words stuck in my throat, for
  I had already seen something of the miseries brought by war into a peaceful
  country, and I could not look upon the struggle in which we were engaged with
  quite as much indifference as my volatile friend.</p>

  <p>"And you, Vere," he resumed, after draining the flask, "I heard you were
  with us weeks ago; but I have been absent from my chief on a reconnaissance,
  so I never could get an opportunity of beating up your quarters. What on
  earth brought you out here, my quiet, studious friend?"</p>

  <p>I could not have told him the truth to save my life. Any one but
  <i>him</i>, for I always fancied she looked on him with favouring eyes, so I
  gave two or three false reasons instead of the real one.</p>

  <p>"Oh," I replied, "everything was so changed after my poor father's death,
  and Alton was so dull, and I had no profession, no object in life, so I
  thought I might see a little soldiering. When they found I could speak
  Turkish, or rather when I told them so, they gave me every facility at the
  War Office; so I got a pair of jack-boots and a revolver, and here I am."</p>

  <p>"But Omar will make you something better than an Interpreter," urged
  Victor. "We must get you over to head-quarters, Vere. Men rise rapidly in
  these days; next campaign you might have a brigade, and the following one a
  division. This war will last for years; you are fit for something better than
  a Tergyman."[#]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[#] An Interpreter.</p>

  <p>"I think so too," I replied; "though, truth to tell, when I came out here
  I was quite satisfied with my present position, and only thirsted for the
  excitement of action. But this soldiering grows upon one, Victor, does it
  not? Yet I am loth to leave Iskender too; the old Lion stretched me his paw
  when I had no friends in Turkey, and I believe I am useful to him. At least I
  must stay with him now, for we shall be engaged before long, I can tell you
  that."</p>

  <p>"<i>Tant mieux</i>," retorted Victor, with flashing eyes; "old Brandy-face
  will ram his cavalry into it if he gets a chance. Don't let him ride too far
  forward himself, Vere, if you can help it, as he did when he cut his own way
  through that troop of hussars, and gave them another example of the stuff the
  Poles are made of. The Muscov nearly had him that time, though. It was then
  he lost the use of half his fingers, and got that crack over the head which
  has been an excuse for drunkenness ever since."</p>

  <p>"Drunk or sober," I replied, "he is the best cavalry officer we have; but
  make yourself comfortable, Victor, as well as you can. I recommend you to
  sleep on my divan for an hour or two; something tells me we shall advance
  to-night. To-morrow, old friend, you and I may sleep on a harder bed."</p>

  <p>"<i>Vive la guerre!</i>" replied Victor, gaily as before; but ere I had
  buckled on my sabre to leave the tent, the chibouque had fallen from his
  lips, and he was fast asleep.</p>

  <p>My grey Arab, "Injour,"[#] was saddled and fastened to a lance; my
  faithful Bold, who had accompanied me through all my wanderings, and who had
  taken an extraordinary liking for his equine companion, was ready to be my
  escort; a revolver was in my holster-pipe, a hunch of black bread in my
  wallet, and with my sabre by my side, and a pretty accurate idea of my route,
  I experienced a feeling of light-heartedness and independence to which I had
  long been a stranger. Poor Bold enjoyed his master's society all the more
  that, in deference to Moslem prejudices, I had now banished him from my tent,
  and consigned him to the company of my horses. He gambolled about me, whilst
  my snorting horse, shaking his delicate head, struck playfully at him with
  his fore-feet, as the dog bounded in front of him. Bad horseman as I always
  was, yet in a deep demi-pique Turkish saddle, with broad shovel stirrups and
  a severe Turkish bit, I felt thoroughly master of the animal I bestrode, and
  I keenly enjoyed the sensation.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[#] The Pearl.</p>

  <p>"Injour" was indeed a pearl of his race. Beautiful as a star, wiry and
  graceful as a deer, he looked all over the priceless child of the desert,
  whose blood had come down to him from the very horses of the Prophet,
  unstained through a hundred generations. Mettle, courage, and endurance were
  apparent in the smooth satin skin, the flat sinewy legs, the full muscular
  neck, broad forehead, shapely muzzle, wide red nostril, quivering ears, and
  game wild eye. He could gallop on mile after mile, hour after hour, with a
  stride unvarying and apparently untiring as clockwork; nor though he had a
  heavy man on his back did his pulses seem to beat higher, or his breath come
  quicker, when he arrived at the head-quarters of the Turkish army than when
  he had left my own tent an hour and a half earlier, the intervening time,
  much to poor Bold's distress, having been spent at a gallop. There was
  evidently a stir in Omar Pasha's quarters. Turkish officers were going and
  coming with an eagerness and alacrity by no means natural to those
  functionaries. An English horse, looking very thin and uncomfortable, was
  being led away from the tent, smoking from the speed at which he had been
  ridden. The sentry alone was totally unmoved and apathetic; a devout
  Mussulman, to him destiny was destiny, and there an end. Had the enemy
  appeared forty thousand strong, sweeping over his very camp, he would have
  fired his musket leisurely&mdash;in all probability it would not have gone
  off the first time&mdash;and awaited his fate, calmly observing, "Kismet![#]
  there is but one Allah!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[#] Destiny.</p>

  <p>More energetic spirits are fortunately within those green canvas walls;
  for there sits Omar Pasha, surrounded by the gallant little band of
  foreigners, chiefly Englishmen, who never wavered or hesitated for an
  instant, however desperate the task to be undertaken, and whom, it is but
  justice to say, the Turks were always ready to follow to the death. Very
  different is the expression on each countenance, for a council of war is
  sitting, and to-day will decide the fate of many a grey-coated Muscov and
  many a turbaned servant of the Prophet. A Russian prisoner has moreover just
  been brought in, and my arrival is sufficiently opportune to interpret, with
  the few words of Russian I have already picked up, between the unfortunate
  man and his captors. If he prove to be a spy, as is more than suspected, may
  Heaven have mercy on him, for the Turk will not.</p>

  <p>Omar Pasha's brow is contracted and stern. He vouchsafes me no look or
  sign of recognition as he bids me ask the prisoner certain pertinent
  questions on which life and death depend.</p>

  <p>"What is the strength of the corps to which you belong?"</p>

  <p>The man answers doggedly, and with his eyes fixed on the ground, "Twenty
  thousand bayonets."</p>

  <p>Omar Pasha compares his answer with the paper he holds in his hand. I
  fancy he sets his teeth a little tighter, but otherwise he moves not a muscle
  of his countenance.</p>

  <p>"At what distance from the Danube did you leave your General's
  head-quarters?"</p>

  <p>The prisoner pretends not to understand. My limited knowledge of his
  language obliges me to put the question in an involved form, and he seems to
  take time to consider his answer. There is nothing about the man to
  distinguish him from the common Russian soldier&mdash;a mere military serf.
  He is dressed in the long, shabby, grey coat, the greasy boots, and has a low
  overhanging brow, a thoroughly Calmuck cast of features, and an intensely
  stupid expression of countenance; but I remark that his hands, which are
  nervously pressed together, are white and slender, and his feet are much too
  small for their huge shapeless coverings.</p>

  <p>His eye glitters as he steals a look at the General, whilst he answers,
  "Not more than an hour and a half."</p>

  <p>Again Omar consults his paper, and a gleam passes over his face like that
  of a chess-player who has checkmated his adversary.</p>

  <p>"One more question," he observes, courteously, "and I will trouble you no
  longer. What force of artillery is attached to your General's <i>corps
  d'arm&eacute;e</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Eight batteries of field-cannon and four troops of horse artillery,"
  replies the prisoner, this time without a moment's hesitation; but the sweat
  breaks out on his forehead, for he is watching Omar Pasha's countenance, and
  he reads "death" on that impassible surface.</p>

  <p>"It is sufficient, gentlemen," observes the General to the officers who
  surround him. "Let him be taken to the rear of the encampment and shot
  forthwith."</p>

  <p>The prisoner's lip quivers nervously, but he shows extraordinary pluck,
  and holds himself upright as if on parade.</p>

  <p>"Poor devil!" says a hearty voice in English; and turning round, I see a
  good-looking, broad-shouldered Englishman, in the uniform of a brigadier, who
  is watching the prisoner with an air of pity and curiosity approaching the
  ludicrous. "Excellence," says he, in somewhat broken German, "will you not
  send him to me? I will undertake that he spreads no false reports about the
  camp. I will answer for his safety in my hands; he must not be permitted to
  communicate with any one, even by signs; but it is a pity to shoot him, is it
  not?"</p>

  <p>"I would do much to oblige you, Brigadier," replied Omar, with frank
  courtesy; "but you know the custom of war. I cannot in this instance depart
  from it&mdash;no, not even to oblige a friend;" he smiled as he spoke, and
  added in Turkish to an officer who stood beside him, "March him out, and see
  it done immediately. And now, gentlemen," he proceeded, "we will arrange the
  plan of attack. Mr. Egerton, your despatches are ready; let them reach
  Iskender Bey without delay. There will be work for us all to-morrow."</p>

  <p>At these words a buzz of satisfaction filled the tent; not an officer
  there but was determined to win his way to distinction <i>cote qui
  cote</i>. I felt I had received my dismissal, and bowed myself out. As I
  left the tent, I encountered the unfortunate Russian prisoner marching
  doggedly under escort to the place of his doom. When he caught sight of me he
  made a mechanical motion with his fettered hand, as though to raise it to his
  cap, and addressed me in French, of which language he had hitherto affected
  the most profound ignorance.</p>

  <p>"Comrade," said he, "order these men to give me five minutes. We are both
  soldiers; you shall do me a favour."</p>

  <p>I spoke to the "mulazim"[#] who commanded the guard. He pointed out an
  open space on which we were entering, and observed, "The Moscov has reached
  his resting-place at last. Five minutes are soon gone. What am I that I
  should disobey the Tergyman? Be it on my head, Effendi."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[#] Lieutenant.</p>

  <p>The Russian became perfectly composed. At my desire his arms were
  liberated, and the first use he made of his freedom was to shake me cordially
  by the hand.</p>

  <p>"Comrade," said he, in excellent French, and with the refined tone of an
  educated man, "we are enemies, but we are soldiers. We are civilised men
  among barbarians; above all, we are Christians among infidels. Swear to me by
  the faith we both worship that you will fulfil my last request."</p>

  <p>His coolness at this trying moment brought the tears into my eyes. I
  promised to comply with his demand so far as my honour as a soldier would
  permit me.</p>

  <p>He had stood unmoved surrounded by enemies, he had heard his death-warrant
  without shrinking for an instant; but my sympathy unmanned him, and it was
  with a broken voice and moistened eyes that he proceeded.</p>

  <p>"I am not what I seem. I hold a commission in the Russian army. Disguised
  as a private soldier I crossed the river of my own free will. I have
  sacrificed myself willingly for my country and my Czar. He will know it, and
  my brother will be promoted. The favour I ask you is no trifling one." He
  took a small amulet from his neck as he spoke; it was the image of his patron
  saint, curiously wrought in gold. "Forward this to my mother, she is the one
  I love best on earth. <i>Mother</i>," he repeated, in a low, heartbreaking
  voice, "could you but see me now!"</p>

  <p>I had fortunately a memorandum-book in my pocket. I tore out a leaf and
  handed him a pencil. He thanked me with such a look of gratitude as I never
  saw before on mortal face, wrote a few lines, wrapped the amulet in the
  paper, and inscribed on it the direction with a hand far steadier than my
  own. As he gave it me, the mulazim coolly observed, "Effendi! the time has
  expired," and ordered his men to "fall in." The Russian squeezed my hand, and
  drew himself up proudly to his full height, whilst his eye kindled, and the
  colour came once more into his cheek. As I mounted my horse, he saluted me
  with the grave courteous air with which a man salutes an antagonist in a
  duel.</p>

  <p>I could not bear to see him die. I went off at a gallop, but I had not
  gone two hundred paces before I heard the rattle of some half-dozen muskets.
  I pulled up short and turned round. Some inexplicable fascination forced me
  to look. The white smoke was floating away. I heard the ring of the men's
  ramrods as they reloaded; and where the Russian had stood erect and
  chivalrous while he bid me his last farewell, there was nothing now but a
  wisp of grey cloth upon the ground.</p>

  <p>Sick at heart, I rode on at a walk, with the bridle on my horse's neck.
  But a soldier's feelings must not interfere with duty. My despatches had to
  be delivered immediately, and soon I was once more speeding away as fast as I
  had come. An hour's gallop braced my nerves, and warmed the blood about my
  heart. As I gave Injour a moment's breathing time, I summoned fortitude to
  read the Russian's letter. My scholarship was more than sufficient to master
  its brief contents. It was addressed to the Countess D&mdash;, and consisted
  but of these few words: "Console thyself, my mother; I die in the true
  faith."</p>

  <p>He was a gallant man and a good.</p>

  <p>"If this is the stuff our enemies are made of," thought I, as I urged
  Injour once more to his speed, "there is, indeed&mdash;as Omar Pasha told us
  to-day&mdash;there is, indeed, 'work cut out for us all.'"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX. &mdash; "'SKENDER BEY"</h2>

  <p class="first">The old Lion is sober enough now. What a headache he ought
  to have after all that brandy yesterday: but the prospect of fighting always
  puts Iskender Bey to rights, and to-day he will have a bellyful, or we are
  much mistaken. At the head, in the rear, on the flanks of his small force,
  the fiery Pole seems to have eyes and ears for every trooper under his
  command. The morning is dark and cloudy; a small drizzling rain is falling,
  and effectually assists our manoeuvres. We have crossed the Danube in a few
  flat boats before daybreak, fortunately with no further casualty than the
  drowning of one horse, whose burial-service has been celebrated in the
  strongest oaths of the Turkish language. We have landed without opposition;
  and should we not be surprised by any outpost of the enemy, we are in a
  highly favourable position for taking our share in the combined attack.</p>

  <p>Victor de Rohan has been attached for the occasion to our commander's
  staff. He is accompanied by a swarthy, powerful man, mounted on a
  game-looking bay mare, the only charger of that sex present on the field.
  This worthy goes by the name of Ali Mesrour, and is by birth a Beloochee:
  fighting has been his trade for more than twenty years, and he has literally
  fought his way all over the East, till he found himself a sort of henchman to
  Omar Pasha on the banks of the Danube. He has accompanied De Rohan here from
  head-quarters, and sits on his mare by the Hungarian's side, grim and unmoved
  as becomes a veteran warrior. There is charlatanism in all trades. It is the
  affectation of the young soldier to be excited, keen, volatile, and jocose,
  while the older hand thinks it right to assume an air of knowing calmness,
  just dashed with a touch of sardonic humour. We are situated in a hollow,
  where we are completely hidden from the surrounding district: the river
  guards our rear and one of our flanks; a strong picket is under arms in our
  front; and beyond it a few videttes, themselves unseen, are peeping over the
  eminence before them. Our main body are dismounted, but the men are prepared
  to "stand to their horses" at a moment's notice, and all noise is strictly
  forbidden in the ranks. If we are surprised by a sufficiently strong force we
  shall be cut to pieces, for we have no retreat; if we can remain undiscovered
  for another hour or so, the game will be in our own hands.</p>

  <p>Iskender Bey is in Paradise. This is what he lives for; and to-day, he
  thinks, will see him a pasha or a corpse.</p>

  <p>"Tergyman," he whispers to me, whilst his sides shake, and his eyes kindle
  with mirth, "how little they think who is their neighbour. And the landing,
  Tergyman! the landing; the only place for miles where we could have
  accomplished it, and they had not even a sentry there. Oh, it is the best
  joke!" And Iskender dismounts from his horse to enjoy his laugh in comfort,
  while his swollen veins and bloodshot eyes betoken the severity of the
  internal convulsion, all the more powerful that he must not have it out in
  louder tones.</p>

  <p>"Another hour of this, at least," observes Victor, as he lights a large
  cigar, and hands another to the commandant, and a third to myself, "one more
  hour, Egerton, and then comes our chance. You have got a picked body of men
  to-day, Effendi!" he observes to the Bey; "and not the worst of the
  horses."</p>

  <p>"They are my own children to-day, Count," answers Iskender, with sparkling
  eyes. "There are not too many of the brood left; but the chickens are game to
  the backbone. What say you, Ali? These fellows are better stuff than your
  Arabs that you make such a talk about."</p>

  <p>The Beloochee smiles grimly, and pats his mare on the neck.</p>

  <p>"When the sun is low," he answers, "I shall say what I think; meanwhile
  work, and not talk, is before us. The Arab is no bad warrior, Effendi, on the
  fourth day, when the barley is exhausted, and there is no water in the
  skins."</p>

  <p>Iskender laughs, and points to the Danube. "There is water enough there,"
  he says, "for the whole cavalry of the Padisha, Egyptian guards, and all.
  Pah! don't talk of water, I hate the very name of it. Brandy is the liquor
  for a soldier&mdash;brandy and blood. Count de Rohan, your Hungarians don't
  fight upon water, I'll answer for it."</p>

  <p>"You know our proverb, Effendi," replies Victor, "'The hussar's horse
  drinks wine.' But the rain is coming on heavier," he adds, looking up at the
  clouds; "we shall have water enough to satisfy even a true Mussulman like
  Ali, presently. How slow the time passes. May I not go forward and
  reconnoitre?"</p>

  <p>The permission is willingly granted; and as my office is to-day a
  sinecure, I creep forward with Victor beyond our advanced posts to a small
  knoll, from which, without being seen, we can obtain a commanding view of the
  surrounding country.</p>

  <p>There is a flat extent in front of us, admirably adapted for the
  operations of cavalry; and a slight eminence covered with brushwood, which
  will conceal our movements for nearly half-a-mile farther.</p>

  <p>"The fools!" whispers Victor; "if they had lined that copse with riflemen,
  they might have bothered us sadly as we advanced."</p>

  <p>"How do you know they have not?" I whisper in reply; "not a man could we
  see from here; and their grey coats are exactly the colour of the soil of
  this unhappy country."</p>

  <p>Victor points to a flock of bustards feeding in security on the plain.
  "Not one of those birds would remain a second," says he, "if there were a
  single man in the copse. Do you not see that they have got the wind of all
  that brushwood? and the bustard, either by scent or hearing, can detect the
  presence of a human being as unerringly as a deer. But see; the mist is
  clearing from the Danube. It cannot but begin soon."</p>

  <p>Sure enough the mist was rolling heavily away from the broad, yellow
  surface of the river; already we could descry the towers and walls of
  Roustchouk, looming large, like some enchanted keep, above the waters. The
  rain, too, was clearing off, and a bit of blue sky was visible above our
  heads. In a few minutes the sun shone forth cheeringly, and a lark rose into
  the sky from our very feet, with his gladsome, heavenward song, as the boom
  of a cannon smote heavily on our ears; and we knew that, for to-day, the work
  of death had at last begun.</p>

  <p>The mist rose like a curtain: and the whole attack was now visible from
  our post. A few flats were putting off from the Bulgarian side of the river,
  crowded with infantry, whose muskets and accoutrements glittered in the
  fitful sunlight, loaded to the water's edge. It was frightful to think of the
  effect a round-shot might have on one of those crazy shallops, with its
  living freight. The Russian batteries, well and promptly served, were playing
  furiously on the river; but their range was too high, and the iron shower
  whizzed harmlessly over the heads of the attacking Moslem. A Turkish steamer,
  coolly and skilfully handled, was plying to and fro in support of her
  comrades, and throwing her shells beautifully into the Russian redoubts,
  where those unwelcome visitors created much annoyance and confusion. Victor's
  eyes lightened as he puffed at his cigar with an assumed
  <i>sang-froid</i>which it was easy to see he did not feel.</p>

  <p>"The old Lion won't stay here long," he whispered to me; "look back at him
  now, Vere. I told you so: there they go&mdash;'boots and saddles.' We, too,
  shall be at it in ten minutes. <i>Vive la guerre!</i>"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the trumpet rang out the order to "mount." Concealment was no
  longer necessary, and we rushed back to our horses, and placed ourselves on
  either side of our commander, ready to execute whatever orders he might
  choose to give.</p>

  <p>Iskender Bey was now cool as if on parade; nay, considerably cooler: for
  the rehearsal was more apt to excite his feelings than the play itself. He
  moved us forward at a trot. Once more he halted amongst the brushwood, from
  which the scared bustards were by this time flying in all directions; and
  whilst every charger's frame quivered with excitement, and even the proud
  Turkish hearts throbbed quicker under the Sultan's uniform, he alone appeared
  wholly unmoved by the stake he had to play in the great game. It was but the
  calm before the hurricane.</p>

  <p>From our new position we could see the boats of our comrades rapidly
  nearing the shore. Iskender, his bridle hanging over his mutilated arm, and
  his glass pressed to his eye, watched them with eager gaze. It was indeed a
  glorious sight. With a thrilling cheer, the Turkish infantry sprang ashore,
  and fixing bayonets as they rushed on, stormed the Russian redoubts at a run,
  undismayed and totally unchecked by the well-sustained fire of musketry, and
  the grape and canister liberally showered on them by the enemy. An English
  officer in the uniform of a brigadier, whom through my glass I recognised as
  the good-humoured intercessor for the prisoner in Omar Pasha's tent, led them
  on, waving his sword, several paces in front of his men, and encouraging them
  with a gallantry and daring that I was proud to feel were truly British.</p>

  <p>But the Russian redoubts were well manned, and a strong body of infantry
  were drawn up in support a few hundred paces in their rear; the guns, too,
  had been depressed, and the cannonade was terrible. Down went the red fez and
  the shaven head; Turkish sabre and French musket lay masterless on the sand,
  and many a haughty child of Osman gasped out his welling life-blood to slake
  the dry Wallachian soil. Wave your green scarfs, dark-eyed maids of Paradise!
  for your lovers are thronging to your gates. But the crimson flag is waving
  in the van, and the Russian eagle even now spreads her wings to fly away. A
  strong effort is made by the massive grey column which constitutes the
  enemy's reserve, but the English brigadier has placed himself at the head of
  a freshly-landed regiment&mdash;Albanians are they, wild and lawless robbers
  of the hills&mdash;and he sweeps everything before him. The redoubts are
  carried with a cheer, the gunners bayoneted, the heavy field-pieces turned on
  their former masters, and the Russian column shakes, wavers, and gives way.
  The glass trembles in Iskender's hand; his eye glares, and the veins of his
  forehead begin to swell: for him too <i>the</i> moment has come.</p>

  <p>"Count de Rohan," says he, while he shuts up his glass like a man who now
  sees his way clearly before him, "bring up the rear-guard. Tergyman! I have
  got them <i>here</i> in my hand!" and he clasps the mutilated fingers as he
  speaks. "Now I can crush them. The column will advance at a
  trot&mdash;'March!'"</p>

  <p>Rapidly we clear the space that intervenes between our former position and
  the retreating columns of the enemy&mdash;now to sweep down with our handful
  of cavalry on their flank, and complete the victory that has been so
  gallantly begun! For the first time the enemy appears aware of our proximity.
  A large body of cavalry moves up at a gallop to intercept us. We can see
  their commander waving his sword and giving his orders to his men; their
  number is far greater than our own, and Iskender is now indeed in his
  glory.</p>

  <p>"Form line!" he shouts in a voice of thunder, as he draws his glittering
  sabre and shakes it above his head. "Advance at a gallop!&mdash;charge!!"</p>

  <p>Victor de Rohan is on one side of him, the Beloochee and myself on the
  other; the wildest blood and the best horses in Turkey at our backs: and down
  we go like the whirlwind, with the shout of "<i>Allah! Allah!</i>" surging in
  our ears, lances couched and pennons fluttering, the maddened chargers
  thundering at their speed, and the life-blood mounting to the brain in the
  fierce ecstasy of that delirious moment.</p>

  <p>I am a man of peace, God knows! What have I to do with the folly of
  ambition&mdash;the tinsel and the glare and the false enthusiasm of war? And
  yet, with steel in his hand and a good horse between his knees, a man may
  well be excused for deeming such a moment as this worth many a year of
  peaceful life and homely duties. Alas! alas! is it all vanity? is <i>cui
  bono</i> the sum and the end of everything? Who knows? And yet it was
  glorious while it lasted!</p>

  <p>Long ere we reach them, the Russian cavalry wavers and hesitates. Their
  commander gallops nobly to the front. I can see him now, with his high
  chivalrous features, and long, fair moustache waving in the breeze. He
  gesticulates wildly to his men, and a squadron or two seem inclined to follow
  the example of their gallant leader. In vain: we are upon them even now in
  their confusion, and we roll them over, man and horse, with the very impetus
  of our charge. Lance-thrust and sabre-cut, stab, blow and ringing
  pistol-shot, make short work of the enemy. "<i>Allah! Allah!</i>" shout our
  maddened troopers, and they give and take no quarter. The fair-haired Colonel
  still fights gallantly on. Hopeless as it is he strives to rally his
  men&mdash;a gentleman and a soldier to the last. My comrade, the Beloochee,
  has his eye on him. They meet in the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>. The Colonel
deals a
  furious blow at his enemy with his long sabre, but the supple Asiatic
  crouches on his mare's neck, and wheels the well-trained animal at the same
  instant with his heel. His curved blade glitters for a moment in the sun. It
  seems to pass without resistance through the air; then the fair moustache is
  dabbled all in blood, and the Colonel's horse gallops masterless from the
  field.</p>

  <p>Victor de Rohan fights like a very Paladin, and even I feel the accursed
  spirit rising in my heart. The Russian cavalry are scattered like chaff
  before the wind. Their disorganised masses ride in upon their own infantry,
  who are vainly endeavouring to form with some regularity. The retreat becomes
  a general rout, and our Turkish troopers fly like hell-hounds to the
  pursuit.</p>

  <p>How might a reserve have turned the tables then! What a bitter lesson
  might have been taught us by a few squadrons of veteran cavalry, kept in hand
  by a cool and resolute officer. In vain Iskender rides and curses and
  gesticulates; he is himself more than half inclined to follow the example of
  his men. In vain the Beloochee entreats and argues, and even strikes the
  refractory with the flat of his sabre; our men have tasted blood, and are no
  longer under control. One regiment of Russian infantry, supported by a few
  hussars and a field-piece, are still endeavouring to cover the retreat.</p>

  <p>"De Rohan," exclaims Iskender, while the foam gathers on his lip and his
  features work with excitement, "I must have that gun! Forward, and follow
  me!"</p>

  <p>We placed ourselves at the head of two squadrons of the flower of our
  cavalry; veterans are they, well seasoned in all the artifices of war, and
  "<i>own children</i>"&mdash;so he delights to call them&mdash;to their chief.
  The Beloochee has also succeeded in rallying a few stragglers; and once more
  we rush to the attack.</p>

  <p>The Russian regiment, however, is well commanded, and does its duty
  admirably. The light field-piece opens on us as we advance, and a
  well-directed volley, delivered when we are within a few paces, checks us at
  the instant we are upon them. I can hear the Russian officer encouraging his
  men.</p>

  <p>"Well done, my children," says he, with the utmost
  <i>sang-froid</i>&mdash;"once more like that will be enough."</p>

  <p>Several of our saddles are emptied, and Iskender begins to curse.</p>

  <p>"Dogs!" he shouts, grinding his teeth, and spurring furiously
  forward&mdash;"dogs! I will be amongst you yet. Follow me, soldiers! follow
  me!"</p>

  <p>Meantime, the Russian hussars have been reinforced, and are now capable of
  showing a front. They threaten our flank, and we are forced to turn our
  attention to this new foe. The infantry hold their ground manfully, and
  Iskender, wheeling his men, rushes furiously upon the comparatively fresh
  regiment of hussars with his tired horses. The Beloochee and myself are still
  abreast. Despite of a galling fire poured in by the infantry upon our flank,
  the men advance readily to the attack. We are within six horses' lengths of
  the hussars. I am setting my teeth and nerving my muscles for the encounter,
  which must be fought out hand to hand, when&mdash;crash!&mdash;Injour bounds
  into the air, falls upon his head, recovers himself, goes down once more,
  rolls over me, and lies prostrate, shot through the heart. I disentangle
  myself from the saddle, and rise, looking wildly about me. One leg refuses to
  support my weight, but I do not know that my ankle-bone is broken by a
  musket-ball, and that I cannot walk three yards to save my life. A loose
  charger gallops over me and knocks me down once more. I cannot rise again.
  The short look I have just had has shown me our cavalry retiring, probably to
  obtain reinforcements. The Russian hussars are between me and them, whilst
  the desultory firing on my right tells me that the pursuit is still rolling
  away far into Wallachia. But all this is dim and indistinct. Again the old
  feeling comes on that it is not Vere Egerton, but some one else, who is lying
  there to die. A cold sweat covers my face; a deadly sickness oppresses me;
  the ground rises and heaves around me, and I grasp the tufts of trodden grass
  in my hands. The sound of church bells is in my ears. Surely it is the old
  bell at Alton; but it strikes painfully on my brain. A vision, too, fleets
  before me, of Constance, with her soft, dark eyes&mdash;the white dress makes
  me giddy&mdash;a flash as of fire seems to blind me, and I know and feel no
  more.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I was brought to my senses by the simple process of a
  Cossack dropping his lance into the fleshy part of my arm&mdash;no pleasant
  restorative, but in my case a most effectual one. The first sight that
  greeted my eyes was his little horse's girths and belly, and his own rough,
  savage countenance, looking grimly down upon me as he raised his arm to
  repeat the thrust. I muttered the few words of Russian I knew, to beg for
  mercy, and he looked at his comrades, as though to consult them on the
  propriety of acceding to so unheard-of a request as that of a wounded man for
  his life. A few paces off I saw the Beloochee, evidently taken prisoner,
  disarmed, and his head running with blood, but his whole bearing as dignified
  and unmoved as usual.</p>

  <p>In this awkward predicament I happily bethought me of the Russian
  prisoner's epistle.</p>

  <p>"Quarter, comrade! quarter!" I shouted as loudly as my failing voice would
  suffer me. "I have a letter from your officer. Here it is."</p>

  <p>"Osmanli?" inquired the Cossack, once more raising his arm to strike. I
  shuddered to think how quickly that steel lance-head might be buried in my
  body.</p>

  <p>"No, Inglis!" I replied, and the man lowered his weapon once more and
  assisted me to rise.</p>

  <p>Fortunately at this juncture an officer rode up, and to him I appealed for
  mercy and proper treatment as a prisoner of war. I misdoubted considerably
  the humanity of my first acquaintance, whose eyes I could see wandering over
  my person, as though he were selecting such accoutrements and articles of
  clothing as he thought would suit his own taste. The officer, who seemed of
  high rank, and was accompanied by an escort, fortunately spoke German, and I
  appealed eloquently to him in that language. He started at the superscription
  of the deserter's letter, and demanded of me sternly how I obtained it. In a
  few words I told him the history of the unfortunate spy, and he passed his
  gloved hand over his face as though to conceal his emotion.</p>

  <p>"You are English?" he observed rapidly, and looking uneasily over his
  shoulder at the same time. "We do not kill our English prisoners, barbarians
  as you choose to think us; but to the Turk we give no quarter. Put him on a
  horse," he added, to my original captor, who kept unpleasantly near: "do not
  ill-treat him, but bring him safely along with you. If he tries to escape,
  blow his brains out. As for that rascal," pointing to the Beloochee, "put a
  lance through him forthwith."</p>

  <p>A happy thought struck me. I determined to make an effort for Ali.
  "Excellence," I pleaded, "spare him, he is my servant."</p>

  <p>The Russian officer paused. "Is he not a Turk?" he asked, sternly.</p>

  <p>"No, I swear he is not," I replied. "He is my servant, and an
  Englishman."</p>

  <p>If ever a lie was justifiable, it was on the present occasion: I trust
  this <i>white</i> one may not be laid to my charge.</p>

  <p>"Bring them both on," said the Russian, still glancing anxiously to his
  rear. "Lieutenant Dolwitz, look to the party. Keep your men together, and
  move rapidly. This is the devil's own business, and our people are in full
  retreat." All this, though spoken in Russian, I was able to understand; nor
  did the hurried manner in which the great man galloped off shake my
  impression that he still dreaded a vision of Iskender Bey and his band of
  heroes thundering on his track.</p>

  <p>I was placed on a little active Cossack pony. The Beloochee's wrist was
  tied to mine, and he was forced to walk or rather run by my side; whenever he
  flagged a poke from the butt-end of a lance admonished him to mend his pace,
  and a Russian curse fell harmlessly on his ear. Still he preserved his
  dignity through it all; and so we journeyed onwards into Wallachia, and
  meditated on the chances of war and the changes that a day may bring
  forth.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX. &mdash; THE BELOOCHEE</h2>

  <p class="first">The pursuit was fast and furious. After crossing such a
  river as the Danube, in the teeth of a far superior force and under a heavy
  fire&mdash;after carrying the Russian redoubts with the bayonet, and driving
  their main body back upon its reserve, the Turkish troops, flushed and wild
  with victory, were not to be stopped by any soldiers on earth.</p>

  <p>Iskender's charge had completely scattered the devoted body that had so
  gallantly interposed to cover the retreat of their comrades, and a total rout
  of the Russian forces was the result. The plains of Wallachia were literally
  strewed with dismounted guns, broken ambulance wagons, tumbrils, ammunition
  carts, dead and dying, whilst still the fierce Moslem urged his hot pursuit.
  Straggler after straggler, reeking with haste and all agape with fear,
  reached the astonished town of Bucharest, and the reports in that
  pleasure-seeking capital were, as may well be imagined, of the most
  bewildering and contradictory description.</p>

  <p>Many a frightful scene was witnessed by the terrified Wallachian peasant,
  as fugitive after fugitive was overtaken, struck down and butchered by the
  dread pursuers. Nay, women and children were not spared in the general
  slaughter; and the hideous practice of refusing "quarter," which has so long
  existed between the Turkish and Russian armies, now bore ghastly fruit.</p>

  <p>A horse falls exhausted in a cart which contains some Russian wounded, and
  a woman belonging to their regiment. Its comrade vainly struggles to draw
  them through the slough in which they are fast. Half-a-dozen Turkish troopers
  are on their track, urging those game little horses to their speed, and
  escape is hopeless.</p>

  <p>Helpless and mutilated, the poor fellows abandon themselves to their fate.
  The Turks ride in and make short work of them, the Muscov dying with a stolid
  grim apathy peculiar to himself and his natural foe. The woman alone shows
  energy and quickness in her efforts to preserve her child. She covers the
  baby over with the straw at the bottom of the cart; wounded as she is in the
  confusion, and with an arm broken, she seeks to divert the attention of her
  ruthless captors. Satisfied with their butchery, they are about to ride on in
  search of fresh victims, and the mother's heart leaps to think that she has
  saved her darling. But the baby cries in its comfortless nest; quick as
  thought, a Turkish trooper buries his lance amongst the straw, and withdraws
  the steel head and gaudy pennon, reeking with innocent blood. The mother's
  shriek flies straight to Heaven. Shall the curse she invokes on that ruthless
  brute fall back unheard? Ride on, man of blood&mdash;ride on, to burn and
  ravage and slay; and when the charge hath swept over thee, and the field is
  lost, and thou art gasping out thy life-blood on the plain, think of that
  murdered child, and die like a dog in thy despair!</p>

  <p>By a route nearly parallel with the line of flight, but wandering through
  an unfrequented district with which the Cossacks seem well acquainted, the
  Beloochee and myself proceed towards our captivity. We have ample leisure to
  examine our guards, these far-famed Cossacks of whom warriors hear so much
  and see so little&mdash;the best scouts and foragers known, hardy, rapid, and
  enduring, the very eyes and ears of an army, and for every purpose except
  fighting unrivalled by any light cavalry in the world. My original captor,
  who still clings to me with a most unwelcome fondness, is no bad specimen of
  his class. He is mounted on a shaggy pony, that at first sight seems
  completely buried even under the middle-sized man it carries, but with a
  lean, good head, and wiry limbs that denote speed and endurance, when put to
  the test. In a snaffle bridle, and with its head up, the little animal goes
  with a jerking, springing motion, not the least impaired by its day's work,
  and the fact that it has now been without food for nearly twenty-four hours.
  Its master, the same who keeps his small bright eye so constantly fastened
  upon his prisoners, is a man of middle height, spare, strong, and sinewy,
  with a bushy red beard and huge moustache. His dress consists of enormously
  loose trousers, a tight-fitting jacket, and high leathern shako; and he sits
  with his knees up to his chin. His arms are a short sabre, very blunt, and
  useless, and a long lance, with which he delights to do effective service
  against a fallen foe. He has placed the Beloochee between himself and me; it
  seems that he somewhat mistrusts my companion, but considers myself, a
  wounded man on one of their own horses, safe from any attempt at escape. The
  Beloochee, notwithstanding that every word calls down a thwack upon his pate
  (wounded as it is by the sabre-cut which stunned him) from the shaft of a
  lance, hazards an observation, every now and then, in Turkish. It is
  satisfactory to find that our guardians are totally ignorant of that
  language. I remark, too, that Ali listens anxiously at every halt, and
  apparently satisfied with what he hears, though I for my own part can discern
  nothing, walks on in a cheerful frame of mind, which I attribute entirely to
  the Moslem stoicism. His conversation towards dusk consists entirely of
  curses upon his captors; and these worthies, judging of its tenor by the
  sound, and sympathising doubtless with the relief thus afforded, cease to
  belabour him for his remarks.</p>

  <p>At nightfall the rain came on again as in the morning; and at length it
  grew pitch dark, just as we entered a defile, on one side of which was a
  steep bank covered with short brushwood, and on the other a wood of young
  oaks nearly impenetrable.</p>

  <p>I felt the Beloochee's wrist press mine with an energy that must mean
  something.</p>

  <p>"Are you in pain?" he whispered in Turkish, adding a loud and voluble
  curse upon the Giaour, much out of unison with his British character, but
  which was doubtless mistaken for a round English oath.</p>

  <p>"Not much," I replied in the same language; "but sick and faint at
  times."</p>

  <p>"Can you roll off your horse, and down the bank on your left?" he added,
  hurriedly. "If you can, I can save you."</p>

  <p>"Save yourself," I replied; "how can I move a step with a ball in my
  ankle-bone?"</p>

  <p>"Silence!" interposed the Cossack, with a bang over the Beloochee's
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Both or none," whispered the latter after a few seconds' interval, "do
  exactly as I tell you."</p>

  <p>"Agreed," I replied, and waited anxiously for the result.</p>

  <p>Our Cossack was getting wet through. To his hardy frame such a soaking
  could scarcely be called an inconvenience; nevertheless, it created a longing
  for a pipe, and the tobacco-bag he had taken from Ali was fortunately not
  half emptied. As he stopped to fill and light his short silver-mounted
  meerschaum, the spoil of some fallen foe, the troopers in our rear passed on.
  We were left some ten paces behind the rest, and the night was as dark as
  pitch.</p>

  <p>Ali handed me a small knife: he had concealed that and one other tiny
  weapon in the folds of his sash when they searched him on the field of
  battle. I knew what he meant, and cut the cord that bound our wrists
  together; his other hand, meanwhile, to lull suspicion, caressed the
  Cossack's horse. That incautious individual blew upon his match, which
  refused to strike a good light.</p>

  <p>In a twinkling Ali's shawl was unwound from his body and thrown apparently
  over the Cossack's saddle-bow. The smothered report of a pocket-pistol smote
  on my ear, but the sound could not penetrate through those close Cashmere
  folds to the party in front, and they rode unconsciously forward. The
  Beloochee's hand, too, was on his adversary's throat; and one or two gasps,
  as they rolled together to the ground, made me doubt whether he had been
  slain by the ball from that little though effective weapon, or choked in the
  nervous gripe of the Asiatic.</p>

  <p>I had fortunately presence of mind to restrain my own horse, and catch the
  Cossack's by the bridle; the party in front still rode on.</p>

  <p>Ali rose from the ground. "The knife," he whispered hoarsely, "the
  knife!"</p>

  <p>Once, twice, he passed it through that prostrate body. "Throw yourself
  off," he exclaimed; "let the horses go. Roll down that bank, and we are
  saved!"</p>

  <p>I obeyed him with the energy of a man who knows he has but
  <i>one</i>chance. I scarcely felt the pain as I rolled down amongst the
  brushwood. I landed in a water-course full of pebbles, but the underwood had
  served to break my fall; and though sorely bruised and with a broken ankle, I
  was still alive. The Beloochee, agile as a cat, was by my side.</p>

  <p>"Listen," said he; "they are riding back to look for us. No horse on earth
  but <i>one</i> can creep down that precipice; lie still. If the moon does not
  come out, we are saved."</p>

  <p>Moments of dreadful suspense followed. We could hear the Cossacks shouting
  to each other above, and their savage yell when they discovered their slain
  comrade smote wildly on our ears. Again I urged the Beloochee to
  fly&mdash;why should he wait to die with me? I could scarcely scrawl, and a
  cold sickness came on at intervals that unnerved me totally.</p>

  <p>To all my entreaties he made but one reply, "Bakaloum" (We shall see), "it
  is our destiny. There is but one Allah!"</p>

  <p>The Cossacks' shouts became fainter and fainter. They seemed to have
  divided in search of their late prey. The moon, too, struggled out fitfully.
  It was a wild scene.</p>

  <p>The Beloochee whistled&mdash;a low, peculiar whistle, like the cry of a
  night-hawk. He listened attentively; again he repeated that prolonged,
  wailing note. A faint neigh answered it from the darkness, and we heard the
  tread of a horse's hoofs approaching at a trot.</p>

  <p>"It is Zuleika," he observed, quietly; "there is but one Allah!"</p>

  <p>A loose horse, with saddle and bridle, trotted up to my companion, and
  laid its head against his bosom. Stern as he was, he caressed it as a mother
  fondles a child. It was his famous bay mare, "the treasure of his heart,"
  "the corner of his liver,"&mdash;for by such endearing epithets he addressed
  her,&mdash;and now he felt indeed that he was saved.</p>

  <p>"Mount," he said, "in the name of the Prophet. I know exactly where we
  are. Zuleika has the wings of the wind; she laughs to scorn the heavy steeds
  of the Giaour; they swallow the dust thrown up by her hoofs, and Zuleika
  bounds from them like the gazelle. Oh, <i>jhanum</i>!&mdash;oh, my soul!"
  Once more he caressed her, and the mare seemed well worthy of his affection;
  she returned it by rubbing her head against him with a low neigh.</p>

  <p>I was soon in the saddle, with the Beloochee walking by my side. His iron
  frame seemed to acknowledge no fatigue. Once I suggested that the mare should
  carry double, and hazarded an opinion that by reducing the pace we might
  fairly increase the burden. The remark well-nigh cost me the loss of my
  preserver's friendship.</p>

  <p>"Zuleika," he exclaimed, with cold dignity, "Zuleika requires no such
  consideration. She is not like the gross horse of the Frank, who sinks and
  snorts, and struggles and fails, under his heavy burden. She would step
  lightly as a deer under three such men as we are. No, light of my eyes," he
  added, smoothing down the thin silky mane of his favourite, "I will walk by
  thee and caress thee, and feast my eyes on thy star-like beauty. Should the
  Giaour be on our track, I will mount thee with the Tergyman, and we will show
  him the mettle of a real daughter of the desert&mdash;my rose, my precious
  one!"</p>

  <p>She was, indeed, a high-bred-looking animal, although from her great
  strength in small compass she appeared less speedy than she really was. Her
  colour was a rich dark bay, without a single white hair. Her crest was high
  and firm as that of a horse; and her lean, long head and expressive
  countenance showed the ancestry by which her doting master set such store.
  Though the skin that covered those iron muscles so loosely was soft and
  supple as satin, she carried no flesh, and her deep ribs might almost be
  counted by the eye. Long in her quarters, with legs of iron and immense power
  in her back and loins, she walked with an elastic, springy gait, such as even
  my own Injour could not have emulated. She was of the highest breed in the
  desert, and as superior to other horses as the deer is to the donkey. I
  wondered how my friend had obtained possession of her; and as we plodded on,
  the Beloochee, who had recovered his good-humour, walking by my side,
  condescended to inform me of the process by which the invaluable Zuleika had
  become his own.</p>

  <p>"Tergyman!" said he, "I have journeyed through many lands, and with the
  exception of your country&mdash;the island of storms and snows&mdash;I have
  seen the whole world.[#] In my own land the mountains are high and rugged,
  the winters cold and boisterous; it rears <i>men</i> brave and powerful as
  <i>Rustam</i>, but we must look elsewhere for <i>horses</i>. Zuleika, you
  perceive, is from the desert: 'The nearer the sun, the nobler the steed.' She
  was bred in the tent of a scheik, and as a foal she carried on her back only
  such children as had a chief's blood in their veins."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[#] This is a common idea amongst Orientals when they
  have done Mecca and seen a greater part of Asia Minor.</p>

  <p>"From my youth up I have been a man of war, Effendi, and the word of
  command has been more familiar to my lips than the blessed maxims of the
  Prophet; but the time will come when I too shall be obliged to cross the
  narrow bridge that spans the abyss of hell. And if my naked feet have no
  better protection from its red-hot surface than deeds of arms and
  blood-stained victories, woe to me for ever! I shall assuredly fall headlong
  into the depths of fire.</p>

  <p>"Therefore I bethought me of a pilgrimage to Mecca, for he is indeed a
  true believer who has seen with his own eyes the shrine of the Blessed
  Prophet. Many and long were the days I passed under the burning sun of the
  desert; wearisome and slow was the march of the caravan. My jaded camel was
  without water. I said in my soul, 'It is my destiny to die.' Far behind the
  long array, almost out of hearing of their bells, my beast dragged his weary
  steps. I quitted his back and led him till he fell. No sooner was he down
  than the vultures gathered screaming around him, though not a speck had I
  seen for hours in the burning sky. Then I beheld a small cloud far off on the
  horizon; it was but of the size of one of these herdsmen's cottages, but
  black as the raven, and it advanced more rapidly than a body of horsemen. Ere
  I looked again it seemed to reach the heavens, the skies became dark as
  night, columns of sand whirled around me, and I knew the simoom was upon us
  and it was time to die.</p>

  <p>"How long I lay there I know not. When I recovered my consciousness, the
  caravan had disappeared, my camel was already stripped to the bones by the
  birds of prey, my mouth and nostrils were full of sand. Nearly suffocated,
  faint and helpless, it was some time ere I was aware of an Arab horseman
  standing over me, and looking on my pitiable condition with an air of
  kindness and protection.</p>

  <p>"'My brother,' he said, 'Allah has delivered thee into my hand. Mount, and
  go with me.'</p>

  <p>"He gave me water from a skin, he put me on his own horse till we were
  joined by his tribe; I went with him to his tents, and I became to him as a
  brother, for he had saved me at my need.</p>

  <p>"He was a scheik of the wild Bedouins: a better warrior never drew a
  sword. Rich was he too, and powerful; but of all his wives and children,
  camels, horses, and riches, he had two treasures that he valued higher than
  the pearl of Solomon&mdash;his bay mare and his daughter Zuleika."</p>

  <p>The Beloochee's voice trembled, and he paused. For a few seconds he
  listened as if to satisfy himself that the enemy were not on our track, and
  then nerving himself like a man about to suffer pain, and looking far into
  the darkness, he proceeded&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I saw her day after day in her father's tent. Soon I longed for her light
  step and gentle voice as we long for the evening breeze after the glare and
  heat of the day. At last I watched her dark eyes as we watch the guiding star
  by night in the desert. To the scheik I was as a brother. I was free to come
  and go in his tent, and all his goods were mine. Effendi! I am but a man, and
  I loved the girl. In less than a year I had become a warrior of their tribe;
  many a foray had I ridden with them, and many a herd of camels and drove of
  horses had I helped them to obtain. Once I saved the scheik's life with the
  very sword I lost to-day. Could they not have given me the girl? Oh! it was
  bitter to see her every hour, and to know she was promised to another!</p>

  <p>"A few days more and she was to be espoused to Achmet. He was the scheik's
  kinsman, and she had been betrothed to him from a child. I could bear it no
  longer. The maiden looked at me with her dark eyes full of tears. I had eaten
  the scheik's salt&mdash;he had saved me from a lingering death&mdash;he was
  my host, my friend, my benefactor, and I robbed him of his daughter. We fled
  in the night. I owned a horse that could outstrip every steed in the tribe
  save one. I took a leathern skin of water, a few handfuls of barley, and my
  arms. I placed Zuleika on the saddle in front of me, and at daybreak we were
  alone in the desert, she and I, and we were happy. When the sun had been up
  an hour, there was a speck in the horizon behind us. I told Zuleika we were
  pursued; but she bid me take courage, for my steed was the best in the tribe,
  said she, except her father's bay mare, and he suffered no one to mount that
  treasure but himself. She had loosed the bay mare the night before from her
  picket-ropes; it would be morning before they could find her, and there was
  nothing to fear. I took comfort, and pressed my bride to my heart.</p>

  <p>"In the desert, Effendi, it is not as with us. The Arab's life depends
  upon his horse, and he proves him as you would prove a blade. At two years
  old he rides him till his back bends,[#] and he never forgets the merits of
  the colt. Each horse's speed is as well known in the tribe as is each
  officer's rank in the army of the Padisha. Nothing could overtake my charger
  save the scheik's bay mare; and, thanks to Zuleika, the bay mare must be
  hours behind us."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[#] An Arab maxim, from which they are studious not to
  depart; their idea being that a horse's worst year is from three to four;
  during which period they let him run perfectly idle, but feeding him at the
  same time as if in full work: for, say they, "a horse's goodness goes in at
  his mouth." At five he is considered mature.</p>

  <p>"We galloped steadily on, and once more I looked over my shoulder. The
  speck had become larger and darker now, and I caught the gleam of a lance in
  the morning sun. Our pursuer must be nearing us; my horse too began to flag,
  for I had ridden fiercely, and he carried myself and my bride. Nevertheless,
  we galloped steadily on.</p>

  <p>"Once more I looked back. The object was distinct enough now; it was a
  horseman going at speed. Allah be praised! there was but one. Zuleika turned
  pale and trembled&mdash;my lily seemed to fade on my bosom. Effendi, I had
  resolved what to do."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI. &mdash; ZULEIKA</h2>

  <p class="first">"Man to man, and in the desert, I had but little to fear,
  yet when I saw Achmet's face, my heart turned to water within me. He was a
  brave warrior. I had ridden by his side many a time in deadly strife; but I
  had never seen him look like this before. When I turned to confront him, my
  horse was jaded and worn out&mdash;I felt that my life was in the hand of
  mine enemy.</p>

  <p>"'Achmet,' I said, 'let me go in peace; the maiden has made her
  choice&mdash;she is mine.'</p>

  <p>"His only answer was a lance-thrust that passed between Zuleika's body and
  my own. The girl clung fainting to my bosom, and encumbered my sword-arm. My
  horse could not withstand the shock of Achmet's charge, and rolled over me on
  the sand. In endeavouring to preserve Zuleika from injury, my yataghan
  dropped out of its sheath; my lance was already broken in the fall, and I was
  undermost, with the gripe of my adversary on my throat. Twice I shook myself
  free from his hold: and twice I was again overmastered by my rival. His eyes
  were like living coals, and the foam flew from his white lips. He was mad,
  and Allah gave him strength. The third time his grasp brought the blood from
  my mouth and nostrils. I was powerless in his hold. His right arm was raised
  to strike; I saw the blade quivering dark against the burning sky. I turned
  my eyes towards Zuleika; for even then I thought of <i>her</i>. The girl was
  a true Arab, faithful to the last. Once, twice, she raised her arm quick and
  deadly as the lightning. She had seized my yataghan when it dropped from its
  sheath, and she buried it in Achmet's body. I rose from the ground a living
  man, and I was saved by her.</p>

  <p>"Effendi, we took the bay mare, and left my jaded horse with the dead man.
  For days we journeyed on, and looked not back, nor thought of the past, for
  we were all in all to each other; and whilst our barley lasted and we could
  find water we knew that we were safe: so we reached Cairo, and trusted in
  Allah for the future. I had a sword, a lovely wife, and the best mare in the
  world; but I was a soldier, and I could not gain my bread by trade. I loathed
  the counters and the bazaar, and longed once more to see the horsemen
  marshalled in the field. So I fed and dressed the bay mare, and cleaned my
  arms, and leaving Zuleika in the bazaars, placed myself at the gate of the
  Pasha, and waited for an audience.</p>

  <p>"He received me kindly, and treated me as a guest of consideration; but he
  had a cunning twinkle in his eye that I liked not; and although I knew him to
  be as brave as a lion, I suspected he was as treacherous as the fox;
  nevertheless, 'the hungry man knows not dates from bread,' and I accepted
  service under him willingly, and went forth from his presence well pleased
  with my fate. 'Zuleika,' I thought, 'will rejoice to hear that I have
  employment, and I shall find here in Cairo a sweet little garden where I will
  plant and tend my rose.'</p>

  <p>"I thought to rejoin my love where I had left her, in the bazaar; but she
  was gone. I waited hours for her return; she came not, and the blood
  thickened round my heart. I made inquiries of the porters and water-carriers,
  and all the passers-by that I could find: none had seen her. One old woman
  alone thought she had seen a girl answering my description in conversation
  with a black, wearing the uniform of the Pasha; but she was convinced the
  girl had a fawn-coloured robe, or it might have been lilac, or perhaps
  orange, but it certainly was not green: this could not then be Zuleika, for
  she wore the colour of the Prophet. She was lost to me&mdash;she for whom I
  had striven and toiled so much; my heart sank within me; but I could not
  leave the place, and for months I remained at Cairo, and became a Yuz-Bashi
  in the Guards of the Pasha. But from that time to this I have had no tidings
  of Zuleika&mdash;my Zuleika."</p>

  <p>The Beloochee's face was deadly pale, and his features worked with strong
  emotion: it was evident that this fierce warrior&mdash;man of blood though he
  had been from his youth upward&mdash;had been tamed by the Arab girl. She was
  the one thing on earth he loved, and the love of such wild hearts is fearful
  in intensity. After a pause, during which he seemed to smother feelings he
  could not command, he proceeded in a hoarse, broken voice with his tale.</p>

  <p>"The days have never been so bright since I lost her, Effendi; but what
  would you? it was my kismet, and I submitted; as we must all submit when it
  is fruitless to struggle. Day by day I did my duty, and increased in the good
  opinion of the Pasha; but I cared for nothing now save only the bay mare, and
  I gave her the name of one whom I should never see again.</p>

  <p>"The Pasha was a haughty old warrior, lavish in his expenses, magnificent
  in his apparel, and above all, proud of his horses. Some of the swiftest and
  noblest steeds of the desert had found their way into his stables; and there
  were three things in the world which it was well known he would not refuse in
  the shape of a bribe, these were gold, beauty, and horse-flesh. Ere long he
  cast a wistful look on my bay mare Zuleika.</p>

  <p>"It is well known, Effendi, that an Arab mare of pure race is not to be
  procured. The sons of the desert are true to their principles, and although
  gold will buy their best horses, they are careful not to part with their
  mares for any consideration in the world. For long the Pasha would not
  believe that Zuleika was a daughter of that wonderful line which was blessed
  so many hundred years ago by the Prophet, nor was I anxious that he should
  learn her value, for I knew him to be a man who took no denial to his will.
  But when he saw her outstripping all competitors at the jereed; when he saw
  her day after day, at work or at rest, in hardship or in plenty, always
  smooth and sleek and mettlesome as you see her now, he began to covet so good
  an animal, and with the Pasha to covet was in one way or another to
  possess.</p>

  <p>"Many a hint was given me that I ought to offer him my bay mare as a
  present, and that I might then ask what I would; but to all these I turned a
  deaf ear; now that <i>she</i> was gone, what had I in the world but Zuleika?
  and I swore in my soul that death alone should part us. At length the Pasha
  offered me openly whatever sum I chose to name as the price of my mare, and
  suggested at the same time that if I continued obdurate, it might be possible
  that he should obtain the animal for nothing, and that I should never have
  occasion to get on horseback again. My life was in danger as well as my
  favourite. I determined, if it were possible, to save both.</p>

  <p>"I went to the Pasha's gate and demanded an audience, presenting at the
  same time a basket of fruit for his acceptance. He received me graciously,
  and ordered pipes and coffee, bidding me seat myself on the divan by his
  side.</p>

  <p>"'Ali,' said he, after a few unmeaning compliments, 'Ali, there are a
  hundred steeds in my stable. Take your choice of them and exchange with me
  your bay mare, three for one."</p>

  <p>"'Pasha!' I replied, 'my bay mare is yours and all that I have, but I am
  under an oath, that never in my life am I to <i>give</i> or <i>sell</i> her
  to any one.'</p>

  <p>"The Pasha smiled, and the twinkle in his eye betokened mischief. 'It is
  said,' he answered, 'an oath is an oath. There is but one Allah!'</p>

  <p>"'Nevertheless, Highness,' I remarked, 'I am at liberty to LOSE her. She
  may yet darken the door of your stable if you will match your best horse
  against her, the winner to have both. But you shall give me a liberal sum to
  run the race.'</p>

  <p>"The Pasha listened eagerly to my proposal. He evidently considered the
  race was in his own hands, and I was myself somewhat surprised at the
  readiness with which he agreed to an arrangement which he must have foreseen
  would end in the discomfiture and loss of his own steed without the gain of
  mine. I did not know yet the man with whom I had to deal.</p>

  <p>"'To-morrow, at sunrise,' said the Pasha, 'I am willing to start my horse
  for the race; and, moreover, to show my favour and liberality, I am willing
  to give a thousand piasters for every ten yards' start you may choose to
  take. If my horse outstrips your mare you return me the money, if you win you
  take and keep all.'</p>

  <p>"I closed with the proposal, and all night long I lay awake, thinking how
  I should preserve Zuleika in my own possession. That I should win I had no
  doubt, but this would only expose me to fresh persecutions, and eventually I
  should lose my life and my mare too. Towards sunrise a thought struck me, and
  I resolved to act upon it.</p>

  <p>"I would hold the Pasha to his word; I would claim a start of fifty yards,
  and a present of five thousand piasters. I would take the money immediately,
  and girth my mare for the struggle. With fifty yards of advantage, where was
  the horse in the world that could come up with Zuleika? I would fly with her
  once more into the desert, and take my chance. Better death with her, than
  life and liberty deprived of my treasure. I rose, prayed, went to the bath,
  and then fed and saddled my favourite, placing a handful of dates and a small
  bag of barley behind the saddle.</p>

  <p>"All Cairo turned out to see the struggle. The Pasha's troops were under
  arms, and a strong party of his own guards, the very regiment to which I
  belonged, was marshalled to keep the ground. We were to run a distance of two
  hours[#] along the sand. Lances pointed out our course, and we were to return
  and finish in front of a tent pitched for the Pasha himself. His ladies were
  present, too, in their gilded <i>arabas</i>, surrounded by a negro guard. As
  I led my mare up they waved their handkerchiefs, and one in particular seemed
  restless and uneasy. I imagined I heard a faint scream from the interior of
  her <i>araba</i>; but the guard closed round it, and ere I had looked a
  second time it had been driven from the ground. Just then the Pasha summoned
  myself and my competitor to his tent. I cast my eye over my antagonist. He
  was considerably lighter than I was, and led a magnificent chestnut stallion,
  the best in the Pasha's stables; but when I looked at its strong but short
  form, and thought of Zuleika's elastic gait and lengthy stride, I had no
  fears for the result."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[#] About seven miles. The Asiatic always counts space by
  time, and an hour is equivalent to something over a league.</p>

  <p>"I saluted the Pasha, and made my request. 'Highness,' I said, 'I claim a
  start of fifty yards and five thousand piasters. Let the money be paid, that
  I may take it with me and begin.'</p>

  <p>"'It is well,' replied the Pasha; '<i>Kiatib</i>,' he added, to his
  secretary, 'have you prepared the "backshish" for Ali Mesrour? Bestow it on
  him with a blessing, that he may mount and away,' and again the cruel eye
  twinkled with its fierce grim humour. Effendi, my heart sank within me when I
  saw two sturdy slaves bring out a sack, evidently of great weight, and
  proceed to lay the burden on my pawing mare. 'What is this?' I exclaimed,
  aghast; 'Highness, this is treachery! I am not to carry all that weight!'</p>

  <p>"'Five thousand piasters, oh my soul!' replied the Pasha, with his most
  ferocious grin; 'and all of it <i>in copper</i>, too. Mount, in the name of
  the Prophet, and away!'</p>

  <p>"My adversary was already in his saddle; the sack was fastened in front of
  mine. I saw that if I made the slightest demur, it would be considered a
  sufficient excuse to deprive me of my mare, perhaps of my life. With a prayer
  to Allah, I got into my saddle. Zuleika stepped proudly on, as though she
  made but little of the weight; and I took my fifty yards of start, and as
  much more as I could get. The signal-shot was fired, and we were off. Zuleika
  sniffed the air of the desert, and snorted in her joy. Despite of the
  piasters, she galloped on. Effendi, from that day to this I have seen neither
  my antagonist in the race, nor the negro guard, nor the gilded <i>arabas</i>,
  nor the Pasha's angry smile. I won my mare, I won my life and freedom; also I
  carried off five thousand piasters of the Pasha's money, and doubtless four
  times a day he curses me in his prayers, but yonder is the dawn, and here is
  the Danube. Sick and faint you must be, Tergyman! Yet in two hours more we
  shall reach Omar Pasha's tent, for I myself placed a picket of our soldiers
  on either bank at yonder spot, and they have a boat; so take courage for a
  little time longer, and confess that the breath of the morning here is
  sweeter than the air of a Russian prison. Who can foretell his destiny? There
  is but one Allah!"</p>

  <p>I had not the tough frame of my Beloochee friend; before we reached the
  waterside I had fainted dead away. I remembered no more till I awoke from my
  fever in an hospital tent at head-quarters. On that weary time of prostration
  and suffering it is needless for me to dwell. Ere I could sit upright in bed
  the winter had commenced, the season for field operations was over, and the
  army established in cantonments. There was a lull, too, before the storm. The
  Allies had not yet put forth their strength, and it was far from improbable
  that the war might even then be near its conclusion.</p>

  <p>Victor had determined to return to Hungary, and insisted on my
  accompanying him. Weak, maimed, and emaciated, I could be of no service to my
  chief, or to the great General who had so kindly recognised me. I had nothing
  to keep me in Turkey; I had nothing to take me to England. No, no, anywhere
  but there. Had I but won a name, I should have rejoiced to return into
  Somersetshire, to see Constance once again&mdash;to repay her coldness with
  scorn&mdash;perhaps to pass her without speaking&mdash;or, bitterer still, to
  greet her with the frankness and ease of a mere acquaintance. But what was I,
  to dream thus? A mere adventurer, at best a poor soldier of fortune, whose
  destiny, sooner or later, would be but to fatten a battle-field or encumber a
  trench, and have his name misspelt in a <i>Gazette</i>. No, no, anywhere but
  England, and why not Hungary? Victor's arguments were unanswerable; and once
  more&mdash;but oh! how changed from the quiet, thoughtful child&mdash;I was
  again at Edeldorf.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII. &mdash; VAL RIE</h2>

  <p class="first">"I tell you I saw them led out under my very windows to be
  shot. Two and two they marched, with their heads erect, and their gait as
  haughty as if they were leading the assault. Thirteen of them in all, and the
  oldest not five-and-forty. Oh! woe to the Fatherland!&mdash;the best blood in
  Hungary was shed on that fearful day,&mdash;the gallant, the true-hearted,
  who had risen at the first call, and had been the last to fail. Taken with
  arms in their hands, forsooth! What should be in a gentleman's hands but arms
  at such a time? Oh, that I had but been a man!" The girl's dark eyes flashed,
  and her beautiful chiselled nostril dilated as she threw her head back, and
  stamped her little foot on the floor. None of your soft-eyed beauties was
  Val&eacute;rie de Rohan, but one who sparkled and blazed, and took your
admiration
  fairly by storm. Those who are experienced in such matters affirm that these
  are the least dangerous of our natural enemies, and that your regular
  heart-breaker is the gentle, smiling, womanly woman, who wins her way into
  the citadel step by step, till she pervades it all, and if she leaves it,
  leaves desolation and ruin behind her. But of this I am incapable of giving
  an opinion; all I know is, Val&eacute;rie grew soft enough as she went on.</p>

  <p>"I knew every man of them intimately; not one but had been my father's
  guest&mdash;my poor father, even then fined and imprisoned in Comorn for the
  manly part he had played. Not one of them but had been at our 'receptions' in
  the very room from the windows of which I now saw them marching forth to die;
  and not one but as he passed me lifted his unfettered hand to his head, and
  saluted me with a courtly smile. Last of all came Adolphe Zersky, my own
  second cousin, and the poor boy was but nineteen. I bore it all till I saw
  him; but when he passed under my very eyes, and smiled his usual
  light-hearted smile, and waved his handkerchief to me, and pressed it to his
  lips&mdash;a handkerchief I had embroidered for him with my own
  hands&mdash;and called out blithesomely, as though he were going to a
  wedding, 'Good-morning, Comtesse Val&eacute;rie; I meant to have called to-
day, but
  have got a previous engagement,' I thought my heart would break. He looked
  prouder than any of them; I hardly think he would have been set free if he
  could. He was a true Hungarian. God bless him!&mdash;I heard the shots that
  struck them down. I often dream I hear them now. They massacred poor Adolphe
  last of all&mdash;he retained his <i>sang-froid</i> to the end. The Austrian
  officer on guard was an old schoolfellow, and Adolphe remarked to im with a
  laugh, just before they led him out, 'I say, Fritz, if they mean to keep us
  here much longer, they really ought to give us some breakfast!'</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Egerton, it was a cruel time. I had borne the bombardment well
  enough. I had seen our beautiful town reduced to ruins; and I never winced,
  for I am the daughter of a Hungarian; but I gave way when they butchered my
  friends, and wept&mdash;oh, how I wept! What else could I do? We poor weak
  women have but our tears to give. Had I <i>but</i> been born a man!"</p>

  <p>Once more Val&eacute;rie's eye flashed, and the proud, wild look gleamed
over her
  features; while a vague idea that for same days had pervaded my brain began
  to assume a certain form, to the effect that Val&eacute;rie de Rohan was a
very
  beautiful woman, and that it was by no means disagreeable to have such a
  nurse when one was wounded in body, or such a friend when one was sick at
  heart. And she treated me as a <i>real</i> friend: she reposed perfect
  confidence in me; she told me of all her plans and pursuits, her romantic
  ideas, and visionary schemes for the regeneration of her country, for she was
  a true patriot; lastly, she confessed to a keen admiration for my profession
  as a soldier, and a tender pity for my wounds. Who would not have such a
  friend? Who would not follow with his eyes such a nurse as she glided about
  his couch?</p>

  <p>It is useless to attempt the description of a woman. To say that
Val&eacute;rie
  had dark, swimming eyes, and jet-black hair, twisted into a massive crown on
  her superb head, and round arms and white hands sparkling with jewels, and a
  graceful floating figure, shaped like a statue, and dressed a little too
  coquettishly, is merely to say that she was a commonplace handsome person,
  but conveys no idea of that subtle essence of beauty&mdash;that nameless
  charm which casts its spell equally over the wisest as the weakest, and which
  can no more be expressed by words than it can be accounted for by reason. Yet
  Val&eacute;rie was a woman who would have found her way straight to the
hearts of
  most men. It seems like a dream to look back to one of those happy days of
  contented convalescence and languid repose. Every man who has suffered keenly
  in life must have felt that there is in the human organisation an instinctive
  reaction and resistance against sorrow, a natural tendency to take advantage
  of any lull in the storm, and a disposition to deceive ourselves into the
  belief that we are forgetting for the time that which the very effort proves
  we too bitterly remember. But even this artificial repose has a good effect.
  It gives us strength to bear future trials, and affords us also time for
  reflections which, in the excitement of grief, are powerless to arrest us for
  a moment.</p>

  <p>So I lay on the sofa in the drawing-room at Edeldorf, and rested my
  wounded leg, and shut my eyes to the future, and drew a curtain (alas, what a
  transparent one it was!) over the past. There was everything to soothe and
  charm an invalid. The beautiful room, with its panelled walls and polished
  floor, inlaid like the costliest marquetry, a perfect mosaic of the forest;
  the light cane chairs and brocaded ottomans scattered over its surface; the
  gorgeous cabinets of ebony and gold that filled the spaces between the
  windows, reflected in long mirrors that ran from floor to ceiling; the gems
  of Landseer, reproduced by the engraver, sparkling on the walls&mdash;for the
  Hungarian is very English in his tastes, and loves to gaze through the mist
  at the antlered stag whom Sir Edwin has captured in the corrie, and
  reproduced in a thousand halls; or to rest with the tired pony and the boy in
  <i>sabots</i> at the halting-place; or to exchange humorous glances with the
  blacksmith who is shoeing that wondrously-drawn bay horse, foreshortened into
  nature, till one longs to pat him;&mdash;all this created a beautiful
  interior, and <i>from</i> all this I could let my eyes wander away, through
  the half-opened window at the end, over the undulating park, with its
  picturesque acacias, far, far athwart the rich Hungarian plain, till it
  crossed the dim line of trees marking the distant Danube, and reached the
  bold outline of hills beyond the river, melting into the dun vapours of an
  afternoon sky.</p>

  <p>And there was but one object to intercept the view. In the window sat
  Comtesse Val&eacute;rie, her graceful head bent over her work, her pretty
hands
  flitting to and fro, so white against the coloured embroidery, and her soft
  glance ever and anon stealing to my couch, while she asked, with a
  foreigner's <i>empressement</i>, which was very gratifying, though it might
  mean nothing, whether I had all I wanted, and if my leg pained me, and if I
  was not wearying for Victor's return from the <i>chasse</i>?</p>

  <p>"And you were here years ago, when I was almost a baby, and I was away on
  a visit to my aunt at Pesth. Do you know, I always felt as if we were old
  friends, even the first day you arrived with Victor, and were lifted out of
  the carriage, so pale, so suffering! Oh, how I pitied you! but you are much
  better now."</p>

  <p>"How can I be otherwise," was my unavoidable reply, "with so kind a nurse
  and such good friends as I find here?"</p>

  <p>"And am I <i>really</i> useful to you? and do you think that my care
  <i>really</i> makes you better? Oh! you cannot think how glad I am to know
  this. I cannot be a soldier myself, and bear arms for my beloved country; but
  I can be useful to those who have done so, and it makes me so proud and so
  happy!"</p>

  <p>The girl's colour rose, and her eyes sparkled and moistened at once.</p>

  <p>"But I have not fought for Hungary," I interposed, rather bluntly. "I have
  no claim on your sympathies&mdash;scarcely on your pity."</p>

  <p>"Do not say so," she exclaimed, warmly. "Setting apart our regard for you
  as my brother's friend, it is our enemy with whom you have been
  fighting&mdash;our oppressor who has laid you now on a wounded couch, far
  from your own country and your friends. Do you think I can tolerate a
  Russian? he is but one degree better than an Austrian! And I can
  <i>hate</i>&mdash;I tell you I can hate to some purpose!"</p>

  <p>She looked as if she could. What a strange girl she was!&mdash;now so soft
  and tender, like a gentle ring-dove; anon flashing out into these gleams of
  fierceness like a tigress. I was beginning to be a little afraid of her. She
  seemed to divine my thoughts, for she laughed merrily, and resumed, in her
  usual pleasant voice&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You do not yet know me, Mr. Egerton. I am a true De Rohan, and we are as
  strong in our loves as in our hatreds. Beware of either! I warn you," she
  added archly, "we are a dangerous race to friend or foe."</p>

  <p>Was this coquetry, or the mere playful exuberance of a girl's spirits? I
  began to feel a curious sensation that I had thought I should never feel
  again&mdash;I am not sure that it was altogether unpleasant.</p>

  <p>Val&eacute;rie looked at me for a moment, as if she expected me to say
something;
  then bent her head resolutely down to her frame, and went on in a low, rapid
  voice&mdash;</p>

  <p>"We are a strange family, Mr. Egerton, we 'De Rohans'; and are a true type
  of the country to which we belong. We are proud to be thought real
  Hungarians&mdash;warm-hearted, excitable, impatient, but, above all, earnest
  and sincere. We are strong for good and for evil. Our tyrants may break our
  hearts, but they cannot subdue our spirit. We look forward to the time which
  <i>must</i> come at last. 'Hope on, hope ever!' is our motto: a good
  principle, Mr. Egerton, is it not?"</p>

  <p>As I glanced at her excited face and graceful figure, I could not help
  thinking that there must be many an aspiring Hungarian who would love well to
  hear such a sentiment of encouragement from such lips, and who would be ready
  and willing to hope on, though the ever would be a long word for one of those
  ardent, impulsive natures. She worked on in silence for a few minutes, and
  resumed.</p>

  <p>"You will help us, you English, we all feel convinced. Are you not the
  champions of liberty all over the world? And you are so like ourselves in
  your manners and thoughts and principles. Tell me, Mr. Egerton, and do not be
  afraid to trust me, <i>is it not true</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Is not <i>what</i> true?" I asked, from the sofa where I lay, apathetic
  and dejected, a strange contrast to my beautiful companion.</p>

  <p>She went to the door, listened, and closed it carefully, then looked out
  at the open window, and having satisfied herself there was not a soul within
  ear-shot, she came back close to my couch, and whispered, "An English prince
  on the throne of Hungary, our constitution and our parliaments once more,
  and, above all, deliverance from the iron yoke of Austria, which is crushing
  us down to the very earth!"</p>

  <p>"I have never heard of it," said I, with difficulty suppressing a smile at
  the visionary scheme, which must have had its origin in some brain heated and
  enthusiastic as that of my beautiful companion; "nor do I think, if that is
  all you have to look to, that there is much hope for Hungary."</p>

  <p>She frowned angrily.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" she answered, "you are cautious, Mr. Egerton: you will not trust me,
  I can see&mdash;but you might do so with safety. We are all
  '<i>right-thinkers</i>' here. Though they swarm throughout the land, I do not
  believe a Government spy has ever yet set foot within the walls of Edeldorf;
  but I tell you, if <i>you</i> will not help us, we are lost. You laugh to see
  a girl like me interest herself so warmly about politics, but with us it is a
  question of life and death. Women, as well as men, have all to gain or all to
  lose. I repeat, if you do not help us we have nothing left to hope for.
  Russia will take our part, and we shall fall open-eyed into the trap. Why,
  even as enemies, they succeeded in ingratiating themselves with the
  inhabitants of a conquered country. Yes, Hungary was a <i>conquered
  country</i>, and the soldiers of the Czar were our masters. They respected
  our feelings, they spared our property, they treated us with courtesy and
  consideration, and they lavished gold with both hands, which was supplied to
  them by their own Government for the purpose. It is easy to foresee the
  result. The next Russian army that crosses the frontier will march in as
  deliverers, and Austria <i>must</i> give way. They are generous in promises,
  and unequalled in diplomacy. They will flatter our nobles and give us back
  our constitution; nay, for a time we shall enjoy more of the outward symbols
  of freedom than have ever yet fallen to our lot. And <i>merely</i> as a
  compliment, <i>merely</i> as a matter of form, a Russian Grand-Duke will
  occupy the palace at Pesth, and assume the crown of St. Stephen simply as the
  guardian of our liberties and our rights. Then will be told once more the
  well-known tale of Russian intrigue and Russian pertinacity. A pretence of
  fusion and a system of favouritism will gradually sap our nationality and
  destroy our patriotism, and in two generations it will be Poland over again.
  Well, even that would be better than what we have to endure now."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say," I asked, somewhat astonished to find my companion so
  inveterate a <i>hater</i>, notwithstanding that she had warned me of this
  amiable eccentricity in her character,&mdash;"do you mean to say that, with
  all your German habits and prejudices, nay, with German as your very mother
  tongue, you would prefer the yoke of the Czar to that of the Kaiser?"</p>

  <p>She drew herself up, and her voice quite trembled with anger as she
  replied&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The Russians do not beat women. Listen, Mr. Egerton, and then wonder if
  you can at my bitter hatred of the Austrian yoke. She was my own aunt, my
  dear mother's only sister. I was sitting with her when she was arrested. We
  were at supper with a small party of relations and friends. For the moment we
  had forgotten our danger and our sorrows and the troubles of our unhappy
  country. She had been singing, and was actually seated at the pianoforte when
  an Austrian Major of Dragoons was announced. I will do him the justice to say
  that he was a gentleman, and performed his odious mission kindly and
  courteously enough. At first she thought there was some bad news of her
  husband, and she turned deadly pale; but when the officer stammered out that
  his business was with <i>her</i>, and that it was his duty to arrest her upon
  a charge of treason, the colour came back to her cheek, and she never looked
  more stately than when she placed her hand in his, with a graceful bow, and
  told him, as he led her away, that 'she was proud to be thought worthy of
  suffering for her country.' They took her off to prison that night; and it
  was not without much difficulty and no little bribery that we were permitted
  to furnish her with a few of those luxuries that to a lady are almost the
  necessaries of life. We little knew what was coming. Oh! Mr. Egerton, it
  makes my blood boil to think of it. Again, I say, were I only a
  <i>man</i>!"</p>

  <p>Val&eacute;rie covered her face with her hands for a few seconds ere she
resumed
  her tale, speaking in the cold, measured tones of one who forces the tongue
  to utter calmly and distinctly that which is maddening and tearing at the
  heart.</p>

  <p>"We punish our soldiers by making them run the gauntlet between their
  comrades, Mr. Egerton, and the process is sufficiently brutal to be a
  favourite mode of enforcing discipline in the Austrian army. Two hundred
  troopers form a double line, at arm's-length distance apart, and each man is
  supplied with a stout cudgel, which he is ordered to wield without mercy. The
  victim walks slowly down between the lines, stripped to the waist, and at the
  pace of an ordinary march. I need hardly say that ere the unfortunate reaches
  the most distant files he is indeed a ghastly object. I tell you, this
  high-born lady, one of the proudest women in Hungary, was brought out to
  suffer that degrading punishment&mdash;to be beaten like a hound. They had
  the grace to leave her a shawl to cover her shoulders; and with her head
  erect and her arms folded on her bosom, she stepped nobly down the tyrant's
  ranks. The first two men refused to strike; they were men, Mr. Egerton, and
  they preferred certain punishment to the participation in such an act. They
  were made examples of forthwith. The other troopers obeyed their orders, and
  she reached the goal bleeding, bruised, and mangled&mdash;she, that beautiful
  woman, a wife and a mother. Ah! you may grind your teeth, my friend, and your
  dog there under the sofa may growl, but it is true, I tell you, <i>true</i>,
  I saw her myself when she returned to prison, and she still walked, <i>so</i>
  nobly, <i>so</i> proudly, like a Hungarian, even then. Think of our feelings
  and of those of her own children; think of her husband's. Mr. Egerton, what
  would you have done had you been that woman's husband?"</p>

  <p>"Done!" I exclaimed furiously, for my blood boiled at the bare recital of
  such brutality, "I would have shot the Marshal through the heart, wheresoever
  I met him, were it at the very altar of a church."</p>

  <p>Val&eacute;rie's pale face gleamed with delight at my violence.</p>

  <p>"You say well," she exclaimed, clasping her hands together convulsively;
  "you say well. Woman as I am, I would have dipped my hands in his blood. But
  no, no, revenge is not for slaves like us; we must suffer and be still.
  Hopeless of redress, and unable to survive such dishonour, her husband blew
  his brains out. What would you have? it was but a victim the more. But it is
  not forgotten&mdash;no, it is not forgotten, and the Marshal lives in the
  hearts of our Hungarian soldiers, the object of an undying, unrelenting
  hatred. I will tell you an instance that occurred but the other day. Two
  Hungarian riflemen, scarcely more than boys, on furlough from the army of
  Italy, were passing through the town where he resides. Weary, footsore, and
  hungry, they had not wherewithal to purchase a morsel of food. The Kaiser
  does not overpay his army, and allows his uniform to cover the man who begs
  his bread along the road. An old officer with long moustaches saw these two
  lads eyeing wistfully the hot joints steaming in the windows of a
  <i>caf&eacute;</i>.</p>

  <p>"'My lads,' he said, 'you are tired and hungry, why do you not go in and
  dine?'</p>

  <p>"'Excellency,' they replied, 'we come from the army of Italy; we have
  marched all the way on foot, we have spent our pittance, and we are
  starving.'</p>

  <p>"He gave them a few florins and bade them make merry; he could not see a
  soldier want, he said, for he was a soldier too. The young men stepped
  joyfully into the <i>caf&ecirc;</i>, and summoned the waiter forthwith.</p>

  <p>"'Do you know,' said he, 'to whom you have just had the honour of
  speaking? that venerable old man is Marshal Haynau.'</p>

  <p>"The two soldiers rushed from the room; ere the Marshal had reached the
  end of the street they had overtaken him; they cast his money at his feet,
  and departed from him with a curse that may have been heard in Heaven, but
  was happily inaudible at the nearest barrack. So is it with us all; those two
  soldiers had but heard of his cruelty, whilst I, I had stood by and seen her
  wounds dressed after her punishment. Judge if I do not <i>love</i> him! But,
  alas! I am but a woman, a poor weak woman; what can I do?"</p>

  <p>As she spoke, we heard Victor's step approaching across the lawn, and
  Val&eacute;rie was once more the graceful, high-born lady, with her assured
carriage
  and careless smile. As she took up her embroidery and greeted her brother
  playfully, with an air from the last new opera, hummed in the richest,
  sweetest voice, who would have guessed at the volcano of passions concealed
  beneath that calm and almost frivolous exterior. Are women possessed of a
  double existence, that they can thus change on the instant from a betrayal of
  the deepest feelings to a display of apparently utter heartlessness? or are
  they only accomplished hypocrites, gifted with no <i>real</i> character at
  all, and putting on joy or sorrow, smiles or tears, just as they change their
  dresses or alter the trimmings of their bonnets, merely for effect? I was
  beginning to study them now in the person of Val&eacute;rie, and to draw
comparisons
  between that lady and my own ideal. It is a dangerous occupation,
  particularly for a wounded man; and one better indeed for all of us, in
  sickness or in health, let alone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII. &mdash; FOREWARNED</h2>

  <p class="first">It was a pleasant life that we led in the fine old castle at
  Edeldorf. Victor was always an enthusiast in field-sports, and since his
  return from the war he devoted himself to the pursuit of wild animals more
  assiduously than ever. This was no less a measure of prudence than of
  inclination on the part of my friend. An inveterate Nimrod seldom busies
  himself much with politics, and as the antecedents of the De Rohans had
  somewhat compromised that patriotic family in the eyes of the Government, its
  present representative was looked on less unfavourably in the character of a
  young thoughtless sportsman, than he would have been as a disaffected man
  brooding in solitude, and reserving his energies for more dangerous
  occupations.</p>

  <p>Moreover, to one who loved the fresh breath of morning and the crack of
  the rifle, Edeldorf was a perfect paradise. Within a ride of two hours its
  hills furnished many a pair of antlers for the castle hall, and the wild boar
  whetted his tusks upon the stem of many a fine old forest tree in its deep
  woodlands. An occasional wolf and a possible bear or two enhanced the
  interest of the chase; and when the Count quitted his home at early morning,
  belted and equipped for his work, he could promise himself a day of as varied
  enjoyment as the keenest sportsman could desire.</p>

  <p>I was getting rapidly better, but still unable to accompany my friend on
  these active expeditions. I am not sure that I longed very eagerly to
  participate in their delights. As I got stronger, I think I felt less
  inclined to break my habits of convalescence and helplessness&mdash;a
  helplessness that made me very dependent on Val&eacute;rie de Rohan.</p>

  <p>I was awaking from a pleasant dream of evening skies and perfumed
  orange-groves and soft music, with a dim vision of floating hair and muslin
  dresses, when Victor, with a lighted candle in his hand, entered my
  apartment&mdash;a habit he had acquired in boyhood, and which he continued
  through life&mdash;to bid me "Good-morning," and favour me with his
  anticipations of his day's amusement.</p>

  <p>"I wish you were well enough to come with me, Vere," said he, as he peered
  out into the dark morning, not yet streaked with the faintest vestige of
  dawn. "There is nothing like shooting, after all; war is a mistake, Vere, and
  an uncomfortable process into the bargain; but shooting, I find, gives one
  quite as much excitement, and has the advantage of being compatible with a
  comfortable dwelling and plenty to eat every day. I have changed my note,
  Vere, and I say <i>Vive la chasse!</i> now."</p>

  <p>"Did you wake me to tell me that?" I yawned out, as I warded the light of
  the candle from my sleepy eyes, "or do you wish me to get out of my warm bed
  this cold morning and hold a discussion with you on the comparative
  attraction of shooting men and beasts? The former is perhaps the more
  exciting, but the latter the more innocent."</p>

  <p>Victor laughed. "You lazy, cold Englander!" he replied; "I woke you as I
  always do when I anticipate a pleasant day, that I may tell you all I expect
  to do. In the first place, I shall have a delightful ride up to the hills; I
  wish you could accompany me. A cigar before dawn, after a cup of coffee, is
  worth all the smoking of the rest of the twenty-four hours put together. I
  shall gallop the whole way, and a gallop counts for something in a day's
  happiness. Confess <i>that</i>, at least, you cold, unimpassioned
  mortal."</p>

  <p>I pointed to my wounded leg, and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Oh! you will soon be able to get on horseback, and then we two must
  scamper about across the country once more, as we used to do when we were
  boys," resumed Victor; "in the meantime, Val&eacute;rie will take care of
you, and
  you must get well as quick as you can. What a charming ride it is up to the
  hills: I shall get there in two hours at the outside, for Caspar goes like
  the wind; then to-day we mean to beat the woods at the farthest extremity of
  the Waldenberg, where my poor father shot the famous straight-horned stag
  years and years ago. There are several wild boar in the ravine at the bottom,
  and it was only the season before last that Vocqsal shot a bear within twenty
  yards of the waterfall."</p>

  <p>"By the bye," I interrupted him, "are bears and boars and red-deer the
  only game you have in view? or are there not other attractions as fascinating
  as shooting, in the direction of the Waldenberg?"</p>

  <p>It was a random shaft, but it hit the mark; Victor positively blushed, and
  I could not help thinking as I watched him, what a handsome fellow he was. A
  finer specimen of manly beauty you would hardly wish to see than the young
  Count de Rohan, as he stood there in his green shooting-dress, with his
  powder-horn slung across his shoulder, and his hunting-knife at his waist.
  Victor was now in the full glow of youthful manhood, tall, active, and
  muscular, with a symmetry of frame that, while it was eminently graceful,
  qualified him admirably for athletic exercises, and a bearing that can best
  be described by the emphatic term "high-bred." There was a woman's beauty in
  his soft blue eyes and silky hair of the richest brown, but his marked
  features, straight, determined eyebrows, and dark, heavy moustaches, redeemed
  the countenance, notwithstanding its bright winning expression, from the
  charge of effeminacy. Perhaps, after all, the greatest charm about him was
  his air of complete enjoyment and utter forgetfulness of self. Every thought
  of his mind seemed to pass across his handsome face; and to judge by
  appearances, the thoughts were of the pleasantest description, and now he
  absolutely blushed as he hurried on without taking any notice of my
  remark&mdash;</p>

  <p>"If I can bring Val&eacute;rie back a bear-skin for her sledge, I shall
be quite
  satisfied; and I will tell you all about my <i>chasse</i> and my day's
  adventures over a cigar when I return. Meantime, my dear fellow, take care of
  yourself, order all my carriages and horses, if they are of the slightest use
  to you, and farewell, or rather <i>au revoir</i>."</p>

  <p>I heard him humming his favourite waltz as he strode along the gallery (by
  the way, the very Ghost's Gallery of our childish adventure), and in another
  minute his horse's hoofs were clattering away at a gallop into the darkness.
  Whilst I turned round in bed with a weary yawn, and after patting Bold's
  head&mdash;a compliment which that faithful animal returned by a low growl,
  for the old dog, though true and stanch as ever, was getting very savage
  now,&mdash;I composed myself to cheat a few more hours of convalescence in
  sleep. What a contrast to my friend! Weary, wounded, and disappointed, I
  seemed to have lived my life out, and to have nothing more now to hope or to
  fear. I had failed in ambition, I had made shipwreck in love. I was grey and
  old in heart, though as yet young in years; whilst Victor, at the same age as
  myself, had all his future before him, glowing with the sunshine of good
  health, good spirits, and prosperity. Let us follow the child of fortune as
  he gallops over the plain, the cool breath of morning fanning his brow and
  lifting his clustering hair.</p>

  <p>To a man who is fond of riding&mdash;and what Hungarian is
  not?&mdash;there is no country so fascinating as his own native plains, where
  he can gallop on mile after mile, hour after hour, over a flat surface,
  unbroken even by a molehill, and on a light sandy soil, just so soft as to
  afford his horse a pleasant easy footing, but not deep enough to distress
  him. Although I could never myself appreciate the ecstatic pleasures of a
  gallop, or comprehend why there should be a charm about a horse that is not
  possessed by the cow, the giraffe, the hippopotamus, or any other animal of
  the larger order of mammalia, I am not so prejudiced as to be unaware that in
  this respect I am an exception to the general run of my countrymen. Now, I
  cannot shut my eyes to the fact that there are men whose whole thoughts and
  wishes centre themselves in this distinguished quadruped; who grudge not to
  ruin their wives and families for his society; and who, like the Roman
  Emperor, make the horse the very high-priest of their domestic hearth. To
  such I would recommend a gallop on a hard-puller over the plains of Hungary.
  Let him go! There is nothing to stop him for forty miles; and if you cannot
  bring him to reason in about a minute and a half, you must for ever forfeit
  your claim to be enrolled amongst the worshipful company of Hippodami to
  which it seems the noblest ambition of aspiring youth to belong. A deacon of
  the craft was my friend Victor; and I really believe he enjoyed a pleasure
  totally unknown to the walking biped, as he urged Caspar along at speed, his
  fine figure swaying and yielding to every motion of the horse, with a pliancy
  that, we are informed by those who pique themselves on such matters, can only
  be acquired by long years of practice superinduced on a natural, or, as they
  would term it, "heaven-born," aptitude to excel in the godlike art.</p>

  <p>So Victor galloped on like Mazeppa, till the dawn "had dappled into day";
  and save to light a fresh cigar, gave Caspar no breathing-time till the sun
  was above the horizon, and the dew-drops on the acacias glittered like
  diamonds in the morning light. As he quitted the plains at last, and dropped
  his rein on his horse's neck, while he walked him slowly up the stony road
  that led to the Waldenberg, he caught sight of a female figure almost in the
  shadow of the wood, the flutter of whose dress seemed to communicate a
  corresponding tremor to Victor's heart. The healthy glow paled on his cheek,
  and his pulses beat fitfully as he urged poor Caspar once more into a gallop
  against the hill, none the less energetically that for nearly a mile a turn
  in the road hid the object of interest from his sight. What a crowd of
  thoughts, hopes, doubts, and fears passed through his mind during that long
  mile of uncertainty, which, had they resolved themselves into words, would
  have taken the following form:&mdash;"Can she have really come here to meet
  me, after all? Who else would be on the Waldenberg at this early hour? What
  can have happened?&mdash;is it possible that she has walked all this way on
  purpose to see me alone, if only for five minutes, before our <i>chasse</i>
  begins? Then she loves me, after all!&mdash;and yet she told me herself she
  was so volatile, so capricious. No, it is impossible!&mdash;she won't risk so
  much for me. And yet it is&mdash;it must be! It is just her figure, her
  walk,&mdash;how well I know them. I have mistrusted, I have misjudged her;
  she is, after all, true, loving, and devoted. Oh! I will make her such
  amends." Alas! poor Victor; the lady to whom you are vowing so deep a
  fidelity&mdash;to whom you are so happy to think you owe so much for her
  presence on the wild Waldenberg&mdash;is at this moment drinking chocolate in
  a comfortable dressing-room by a warm stove at least ten miles off; and
  though you might, and doubtless would, think her extremely lovely in that
  snowy <i>robe de chambre</i>, with its cherry-coloured ribbons, I question
  whether you would approve of the utter indifference which her countenance
  displays to all sublunary things, yourself included, with the exception of
  that very dubious French novel on her knee, which she is perusing or rather
  devouring with more than masculine avidity. Better draw rein at once, and
  ride back to Edeldorf, for one hundred yards more will undeceive you at the
  turn round that old oak-tree; and it is no wonder that you pull up in utter
  discomfiture, and exclaim aloud in your own Hungarian, and in tones of bitter
  disgust&mdash;"Psha! it's only a Zingynie, after all."</p>

  <p>"<i>Only</i> a Zingynie, Count de Rohan!" replied a dark majestic old
  woman, with a frown on her fine countenance and a flash in her dark eye, as
  she placed herself across the road and confronted the astonished horseman;
  "<i>only</i> your father's friend and your own; <i>only</i> an interpreter of
  futurity, who has come to warn you ere it be too late. Turn back, Victor de
  Rohan, to your own halls at Edeldorf. I have read your horoscope, and it is
  not good for you to go on."</p>

  <p>Victor had by this time recovered his good-humour; he forced a few florins
  into the woman's unwilling hand. "Promise me a good day's sport, mother!" he
  said, laughingly, "and let me go. I ought to be there already."</p>

  <p>"Turn back, my child, turn back," said the gipsy; "I will save you if I
  can. Do you know that there is danger for you on the Waldenberg? Do you know
  that I&mdash;I, who have held you in my arms when you were a baby, have
  walked a-foot all the way from the Banat on purpose to warn you? Do you think
  I know not why you ride here day after day, that you may shoot God's wild
  animals with that bad old man? Is it purely for love of sport, Victor de
  Rohan? Answer me that!"</p>

  <p>He waxed impatient, and drew his reins rudely from the woman's grasp.</p>

  <p>"Give your advice when it is asked, mother," said he, "and do not delay me
  any longer. If you want food and shelter, go down to Edeldorf. I can waste no
  more time with a chattering old woman here."</p>

  <p>She was furious; she flung the money he had given her down beneath his
  horse's feet. Tears rose to her eyes, and her hand shook with passion as she
  pointed with outstretched arm in the direction of the Waldenberg.</p>

  <p>"Ay, go on," said she, "go on, and neglect the gipsy's warning till it is
  too late. Oh! you are a nobleman and a soldier, and you know best; a man of
  honour, too, and you will go <i>there</i>. Listen to me once for all, Victor
  de Rohan, for I loved you as a baby, and I would save you even now, if I
  could. I slept by the waters of the Danube, and I saw in a vision the child I
  had fondled in my arms full-grown and handsome, and arrived at man's estate.
  He was dressed as you are now, with powder-horn and hunting-knife slung over
  his broad shoulders, and the rifle that he set such store by was in his hand.
  He spoke kindly and smilingly as was his wont, not angrily as you did now. He
  was mounted on a good horse, and I was proud to watch him ride gallantly away
  with St. Hubert's blessing and my own. Again I saw him, but this time not
  alone. There was a fair and lovely woman by his side, dressed in white, and
  he hung his head, and walked listlessly and slowly, as though his limbs were
  fettered and he was sore and sick at heart. I could not bear to think the boy
  I had loved was no longer free; and when he turned his face towards me it was
  pale and sorrowful, and there was suffering on his brow. Then my dream
  changed, and I saw the Waldenberg, with its rugged peaks and its waving
  woods, and the roar of the waterfall sounded strange and ominous in my ears;
  and there were clouds gathering in the sky, and the eagle screamed as he
  swept by on the blast, and the rain plashed down in large heavy drops, and
  every drop seemed to fall chill upon my heart. Then I sat me down, weary and
  sorrowful, and I heard the measured tread of men, and four noble-looking
  foresters passed by me, bearing a body covered with a cloak upon their
  shoulders, and one said to the other, 'Alas for our master! is it not St.
  Hubert's day?' But a corner of the cloak fell from the face of him they
  carried, and I knew the pale features, damp with death, and the rich brown
  hair falling limp across the brow&mdash;it was the corpse of him whom I had
  loved as a baby and watched over as a man, and I groaned in my misery and
  awoke. Oh, my boy, my young handsome De Rohan, turn, then, back from the
  Waldenberg, for the old Zingynie's sake."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, mother," replied Victor, impatiently; "St. Hubert's day is
  past; I cannot help your bad dreams, or stay here to prate about them all
  day. Farewell! and let me go." He turned his horse's head from her as he
  spoke, and went off at a gallop.</p>

  <p>The old gipsy woman looked after him long and wistfully, as the clatter of
  his horse's hoofs died away on the stony causeway; she sat down by the
  roadside, buried her face in her cloak, and wept bitterly and passionately;
  then she rose, picked up the money that lay neglected on the ground, and took
  her way down the hill, walking slow and dejected, like one who is hopelessly
  and grievously disappointed, and ever and anon muttering to herself, in words
  that seemed to form something between a curse and a prayer.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV. &mdash; "ARCADES AMBO"</h2>

  <p class="first">Prince Vocqsal possessed a delightful shooting-box in the
  immediate vicinity of the Waldenberg; and, as a portion of those magnificent
  woodlands was on his property, he and the De Rohans, father and son, had long
  established a joint guardianship and right of sporting over that far-famed
  locality. Perhaps what the Prince called a shooting-box, an Englishman's less
  magnificent notions would have caused him to term a country-house; for the
  "chalet," as Madame la Princesse delighted to name it, was a roomy,
  commodious dwelling, with all the appliances of a comfortable mansion,
  furnished in the most exquisite taste. She herself had never been induced to
  visit it till within the last few weeks&mdash;a circumstance which had not
  seemed to diminish its attractions in the eyes of the Prince; now, however, a
  suite of apartments was fitted up expressly for "Madame," and this return to
  primitive tastes and rural pleasures, on the part of that fastidious lady,
  was hailed by her domestics with astonishment, and by her husband with a
  good-humoured and ludicrous expression of dismay. To account for the change
  in Madame's habits, we must follow Victor on his solitary ride, the pace of
  which was once more reduced to a walk as soon as he was beyond the gipsy's
  ken. Who does not know the nervous anxiety with which we have all of us
  sometimes hurried over the beginning of a journey, only to dawdle out its
  termination, in absolute dread of the very moment which yet we long for so
  painfully.</p>

  <p>Now, it was strange that so keen a sportsman as Victor, one, moreover,
  whose ear was as practised as his eye was quick, should have been deceived in
  the direction from which he heard the reports of at least half-a-dozen shots,
  that could only have been fired from the gun of his friend the Prince, whom
  he had promised faithfully to meet that morning at a certain well-known pass
  on the Waldenberg. It was strange that, instead of riding at once towards the
  spot where he must have seen the smoke from a gun actually curling up amongst
  the trees, he should have cantered off in an exactly opposite direction, and
  never drawn rein till he arrived at the gate of a white house surrounded by
  acacias, at least five miles from the familiar and appointed trysting-place,
  and in a part of the Waldenberg by no means the best stocked with game.</p>

  <p>It was strange, too, that he should have thought it necessary to inform
  the grim hussar who opened the door how he had unaccountably missed the
  Prince in the forest, and had ridden all this distance out of his way to
  inquire about him, and should have asked that military-looking individual, in
  a casual manner, whether it was probable Madame la Princesse could put him in
  the right way of finding his companion, so as not to lose his day's sport. It
  might have occurred to the hussar, if not too much taken up with his
  moustaches, that the simplest method for so intimate a friend would have been
  to have asked at once if "Madame was at home," and then gone in and
  prosecuted his inquiries in person. If a shrewd hussar, too, he may have
  bethought him that the human biped is something akin to the ostrich, and is
  persuaded, like that foolish bird, that if he can only hide his head, no one
  can detect his great long legs. Be this how it may, the official never moved
  a muscle of his countenance, and in about half-a-minute Victor found himself,
  he did not exactly know how, alone with "Madame" in her boudoir.</p>

  <p>She gave him her hand, with one of those sunny smiles that used to go
  straight to the Hungarian's heart. Madame was never demonstrative; although
  her companion would joyfully have cast himself at her feet and worshipped
  her, she wilfully ignored his devotion; and while she knew from his own lips
  that he was her lover, nor had the slightest objection to the avowal, she
  persisted in treating him as a commonplace friend. It was part of her system,
  and it seemed to answer. Princess Vocqsal's lovers were always wilder about
  her than those of any other dame half her age and possessed of thrice her
  beauty. She had the knack of managing that strange compound of vanity,
  recklessness, and warm affections which constitutes a man's heart; and she
  took a great delight in playing on an instrument of which she had sounded all
  the chords, and evoked all the tones, till she knew it thoroughly, and
  undervalued it accordingly.</p>

  <p>Victor had very little to say! he who was generally so gay and unabashed
  and agreeable. His colour went and came, and his hand positively shook as he
  took hers&mdash;so cold, and soft, and steady&mdash;and carried it to his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"What, lost again in the Waldenberg?" said she, with a laugh, "and within
  five leagues of Edeldorf. Count de Rohan, you are really not fit to be
  trusted by yourself; we must get you some one to take care of you."</p>

  <p>Victor looked reproachfully at her.</p>

  <p>"Rose," he stammered, "you laugh at me; you despise me. Again I have
  succeeded in seeing you without creating suspicion and remark; but I have had
  to do that which is foreign to my nature, and you know not what it costs me.
  I have had to act, if not to speak, a lie. I was to have met the Prince at
  the waterfall, and I wilfully missed him that I might come down here to
  inquire which way he had gone; I felt like a coward before the eye of the
  very servant who opened your door; and all to look on you for five
  minutes&mdash;to carry back with me the tones of your beloved voice, and live
  upon them for weeks in my dreary home, till I can see you again. Rose! Rose!
  you little know how I adore you."</p>

  <p>"But I cannot pity you in this instance, Monsieur le Comte," replied the
  lady; "I cannot, indeed. Here you are, in my comfortable boudoir, with a warm
  stove, and a polished floor, and your choice of every arm-chair and sofa in
  the room, instead of stamping about on that bleak and dreary Waldenberg, with
  your hands cold and your feet wet, and a heavy rifle to carry, and in all
  probability nothing to shoot. Besides, sir, does my company count for
  nothing, instead of that of <i>Monsieur le Prince</i>? It may be bad taste,
  but I confess that, myself, I very much prefer my own society to his." And
  the Princess laughed her cheerful ringing laugh, that seemed to come straight
  from the heart.</p>

  <p>Victor sighed. "You will never be serious, Rose, for a minute
  together."</p>

  <p>"Serious!" she replied, "no! why should I? Have I not cause to be merry? I
  own I might have felt <i>triste</i> and cross to-day if I had been
  disappointed; but you are come, <i>mon cher Comte</i>, and everything is
  <i>couleur de rose</i>."</p>

  <p>This was encouraging; and Victor opened the siege once more. He loved her
  with all the enthusiasm and ardour of his warm Hungarian heart. Wilfully
  shutting his eyes to ruin, misery, and crime, he urged her to be his&mdash;to
  fly with him&mdash;to leave all for his sake. He vowed to devote himself to
  her, and her alone. He swore he would obey her lightest word, and move heaven
  and earth to fulfil her faintest wish for the rest of his life, would she but
  confide her happiness to him. He was mad&mdash;he was miserable without her:
  life was not worth having unless gilded by her smiles; he would fly his
  country if she did not consent: he would hate her, he would never see her
  more, and a great deal to the same purpose, the outpouring of an eager,
  generous nature, warped by circumstances to evil; but in vain; the lady was
  immovable; she knew too well the value of her position to sacrifice it for so
  empty an illusion as love. Prudence, with the Princess, stood instead of
  principle; and Prudence whispered, "Keep all you have got, there is no need
  to sacrifice anything. You have all the advantage, take care to retain it. He
  may break his chains to-day, but he will come back voluntarily and put them
  on again to-morrow! it is more blessed to <i>receive</i> than to
  <i>give</i>." Such was the Princess's reasoning, and she remained firm and
  cold as a rock. At last his temper gave way, and he reproached her bitterly
  and ungenerously.</p>

  <p>"You do not love me," he said; "cold, false, and heartless, you have
  sacrificed me to your vanity; but you shall not enjoy your triumph long; from
  henceforth I renounce you and your favour&mdash;from this day I will never
  set eyes on you again. Rose! for the last time I call you by that dear name;
  Rose! for the last time, Farewell!"</p>

  <p>She tried the old conquering glance once more, but it failed. She even
  pressed his hand, and bade him wait and see the Prince on his return, but in
  vain. For the time, her power was gone. With lips compressed, and face as
  white as ashes, Victor strode from the room. In less than five minutes he was
  mounted, and galloping furiously off in the direction of Edeldorf.</p>

  <p>Princess Vocqsal was a sad coquette, but she was a woman after all. She
  went to the window, and gazed wistfully after the horseman's figure as it
  disappeared amongst the acacias.</p>

  <p>"Alas!" she thought, "poor Victor, it is too late now! So gallant, so
  loving, and so devoted. Ten years ago I had a heart to give, and you should
  have had it then, wholly and unreservedly; but now&mdash;what am I now? Oh
  that I could but be as I was then! Too late! too late!"</p>

  <p>Her <i>femme-de-chambre</i> attributed Madame's <i>migraine</i> entirely
  to the weather and the dulness of the country, so different from Paris, or
  even Vienna; for that domestic at once perceived her mistress's eyes were red
  with weeping, when she went to dress. But sal volatile and rouge, judiciously
  applied, can work wonders. The Princess never looked more brilliant than when
  she descended to dinner, and she sat up and finished her French novel that
  night before she went to bed.</p>

  <p>Victor must have been half-way home when, leaning on his sister's arm, I
  crept out into the garden to enjoy an hour of fresh air and sunshine in the
  company of my sedulous nurse and charming companion. Val&eacute;rie and I
had spent
  the morning together, and it had passed like a dream. She had made my
  breakfast, which she insisted on giving me in truly British fashion, and
  poured out my tea herself, as she laughingly observed, "<i>comme une meess
  Anglaise</i>." She had played me her wild Hungarian airs on the pianoforte,
  and sung me her plaintive national songs, with sweetness and good-humour. She
  had even taught me a new and intricate stitch in her embroidery, and bent my
  stubborn fingers to the task with her own pretty hands; and now, untiring in
  her care and kindness, she was ready to walk out with me in the garden, and
  wait upon all my whims and fancies as a nurse does for a sick child. I could
  walk at last with no pain, and but little difficulty. Had I not been so well
  taken care of, I think I should have declared myself quite recovered; but
  when you have a fair round arm to guide your steps, and a pair of soft eyes
  to look thrillingly into yours&mdash;as day after day a gentle voice entreats
  you not to hurry your convalescence and "attempt to do too much," it is a
  great temptation to put off as long as possible the evil hour when you must
  declare yourself quite sound again, and begin once more to walk alone.</p>

  <p>So Val&eacute;rie and I paced up and down the garden, and drank in new
life at
  every pore in the glad sunshine and the soft balmy air.</p>

  <p>It was one of those days which summer seems to have forgotten, and which
  we so gladly welcome when we find it at the close of autumn. A warm, mellow
  sunshine brightened the landscape, melting in the distance into that golden
  haze which is so peculiarly the charm of this time of year: while the fleecy
  clouds, that seemed to stand still against the clear sky, enhanced the depth
  and purity of that wondrous, matchless blue. Not a breath stirred the rich
  yellow leaves dying in masses on the trees; and the last rose of the garden,
  though in all the bloom of maturity, had shed her first petal, and paid her
  first tribute to decay. Val&eacute;rie plucked it, and gave it me with a
smile, as
  we sat down upon a low garden seat at one extremity of the walk. I thanked
  her, and, I know not why, put it to my lips before I transferred it to the
  buttonhole of my coat. There was a silence of several minutes.</p>

  <p>I broke it at last by remarking "that I should soon be well now, and must
  ere long bid adieu to Edeldorf."</p>

  <p>She started as though I had interrupted a train of pleasant thoughts, and
  answered, with some commonplace expression of regret and hope, that "I would
  not hurry myself;" but I thought her voice was more constrained than usual,
  and she turned her head away as she spoke.</p>

  <p>"Val&eacute;rie," I said&mdash;and this was the first time I had ever
called her
  by her Christian name&mdash;"it is no use disguising from oneself an
  unpleasant truth: my duty, my character, everything bids me leave my happy
  life here as soon as I am well enough. You may imagine how much I shall
  regret it, but you cannot imagine how grateful I feel for all your kindness
  to me. Had you been my sister, you could not have indulged me more. It is not
  my nature to express half I feel, but believe me, that wherever I go, at any
  distance of time or place, the brightest jewel in my memory will be the name
  of the Comtesse de Rohan."</p>

  <p>"You called me Val&eacute;rie just now," said she, quickly.</p>

  <p>"Well, of Val&eacute;rie, then," I replied. "Your brother is the oldest
friend I
  have&mdash;older even than poor Bold." That sagacious dog had lain down at
  our feet, and was looking from one to the other with a ludicrous expression
  of wistful gravity, as if he could not make it all out. Why should he have
  reminded me at that instant so painfully of the glorious struggle for life
  and death in Beverley mere? That face! that face! would it never cease to
  haunt me with its sweet, sad smile? "Yes, Val&eacute;rie," I proceeded,
"that he
  should have received me as a brother is only what I expected, but your
  unwearying kindness overpowers me. Believe me, I feel it very deeply, and I
  shall leave you, oh! with such regret!"</p>

  <p>"And we too shall regret you very much," answered Val&eacute;rie, with
flushed
  cheeks and not very steady tones. "But can you not stay a little longer? your
  health is hardly re-established, though your wound is healed,
  and&mdash;and&mdash;it will be very lonely when you are gone."</p>

  <p>"Not for you," I replied; "not for the young Comtesse de Rohan (well,
  Val&eacute;rie, then), admired and sought after by all. Beautiful and
distinguished,
  go where you will, you are sure to command homage and affection. No, it is
  all the other way, <i>I</i> shall be lonely, if you like."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but men are so different," said she, with a glance from under those
  long, dark eyelashes. "Wherever they go they find so much to interest, so
  much to occupy them, so much to do, so many to love."</p>

  <p>"Not in my case," I answered, rather pursuing my own train of thoughts
  than in reply to my companion. "Look at the difference between us. You have
  your home, your brother, your friends, your dependants, all who can
  appreciate and return your affection; whilst I, I have nothing in the world
  but my horses and my sword."</p>

  <p>She looked straight into my face, a cloud seemed to pass over her
  features, and she burst into tears. In another moment she was sobbing on my
  breast as if her heart would break.</p>

  <p>A horse's hoofs were heard clattering in the stable yard, and as Victor,
  pale and excited, strode up the garden, Val&eacute;rie rushed swiftly into the
  house.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV. &mdash; "DARK AND DREARY"</h2>

  <p class="first">The pea-soup thickness of a London fog is melting into
  drizzling rain. The lamp-posts and area railings in Mayfair are dripping with
  wet, like the bare copses and leafless hedges miles off in the country. It is
  a raw, miserable day, and particularly detestable in this odious town, as a
  tall old gentleman seems to think who has just emerged from his hotel into
  the chill, moist atmosphere; and whose well-wrapped-up exterior, faultless
  goloshes, and neat umbrella denote one of that class who are seldom to be met
  with in the streets during the winter season. As he picks his way along the
  sloppy pavement, he turns to scan the action of every horse that splashes by,
  and ventures, moreover, on sundry peeps under passing bonnets with a
  pertinacity, and, at the same time, an air of unconsciousness that prove how
  habit can become second nature. The process generally terminates in
  disappointment, not to say disgust, and Sir Harry Beverley&mdash;for it is no
  less a person than the Somersetshire Baronet&mdash;walks on, apparently more
  and more dissatisfied with the world in general at every step he takes. As he
  paces through Grosvenor-square he looks wistfully about him, as though for
  some means of escape. He seems bound on an errand for which he has no great
  fancy, and once or twice he is evidently on the point of turning back.
  Judging by his increase of pace in South Audley-street, his courage would
  appear to be failing him rapidly; but the aspect of Chesterfield House, the
  glories of which he remembers well in its golden time, reassures him; and
  with an inward ejaculation of "poor D'Orsay!" and a mental vision of that
  extraordinary man, who conquered the world with the aid only of his whiskers
  and his cab-horse, Sir Harry walks on. "They are pleasant to look back upon,"
  thinks the worn old "man of the world"&mdash;"those days of Crocky's and
  Newmarket, and cheerful Melton, with its brilliant gallops, and cozy little
  dinners, and snug parties of whist. London, too, was very different in my
  time. Society was not so large, and <i>we</i>" (meaning the soliloquist and
  his intimate friends) "could do what we liked. Ah! if I had my time to come
  over again!" and something seems to knock at Sir Harry's heart, as he thinks,
  if indeed he could live life over once more, how differently he would spend
  it. So thinks every man who lives for aught but doing good. It is dreadful at
  last to look along the valley that was once spread before us so glad and
  sunny, teeming with corn, and wine, and oil, and to see how barren we have
  left it. Count your good actions on your fingers, as the wayfarer counts the
  miles he has passed, or the trader his gains, or the sportsman his
  successes&mdash;can you reckon one a day? a week? a month? a year? And yet
  you will want a large stock to balance those in the other scale. Man is a
  reasoning being and a free agent: he makes a strange use of both
  privileges.</p>

  <p>At last Sir Harry stops in front of a neat little house with the brightest
  of knockers and the rosiest of muslin curtains, and flowers in its windows,
  and an air of cheerful prettiness even in this dull dark day.</p>

  <p>A French servant, clean and sunshiny as French servants always are,
  answers the visitor's knock, and announces that "Monsieur" has been "de
  Service"; or in other words, that Captain Ropsley has that morning come "off
  guard." Whilst the Baronet divests himself of his superfluous clothing in an
  outer room, let us take a peep at the Guardsman in his luxurious little
  den.</p>

  <p>Ropsley understands comfort thoroughly, and his rooms are as tastefully
  furnished and as nicely arranged as though there were present the genius of
  feminine order to preside over his retreat. Not that such is by any means the
  case. Ropsley is well aware that he owes much of his success in life to the
  hardness of his heart, and he is not a man to throw away a single point in
  the game for the sake of the sunniest smile that ever wreathed a fair false
  face. He is no more a man of pleasure than he is a man of business, though
  with him pleasure is business, and business is pleasure. He has a sound
  calculating head, a cool resolute spirit, an abundance of nerve, no
  sentiment, and hardly any feeling whatever. Just the man to succeed, and he
  does succeed in his own career, such as it is. He has established a
  reputation for fashion, a position in the world; with a slender income he
  lives in the highest society, and on the best of everything; and he has no
  one to thank for all these advantages but himself. As he lies back in the
  depths of his luxurious armchair, smoking a cigar, and revelling in the
  coarse witticisms of Rabelais, whose strong pungent satire and utter want of
  refinement are admirably in accordance with his own turn of mind, a
  phrenologist would at once read his character in his broad but not prominent
  forehead, his cold, cat-like, grey eye, and the habitual sneer playing round
  the corners of an otherwise faultless mouth. Handsome though it be, it is not
  a face the eye loves to look upon. During the short interval that elapses
  between his servant's announcement and his visitor's entrance, Ropsley has
  time to dismiss Rabelais completely from his mind, to run over the salient
  points of the conversation which he is determined to have with Sir Harry, and
  to work out "in the rough" two or three intricate calculations, which are
  likely somewhat to astonish that hitherto unconscious individual. He throws
  away his cigar, for he defers to the prejudices of the "old school," and
  shaking his friend cordially by the hand, welcomes him to town, stirs the
  fire, and looks, as indeed he feels, delighted to see him.</p>

  <p>Sir Harry admires his young friend much, there is something akin in their
  two natures; but the acquired shrewdness of the elder man is no match for the
  strong intellect and determined will of his junior.</p>

  <p>"I have come up as you desired, my dear fellow," said the Baronet, "and
  brought Constance with me. We are at &mdash;'s Hotel, where, by the way,
  they've got a deuced bad cook: and having arrived last night, here I am this
  morning."</p>

  <p>Ropsley bowed, as he always did, at the mention of Miss Beverley's name;
  it was a queer sort of half-malicious little bow. Then looking her father
  straight in the face with his cold bright eye, he said, abruptly&mdash;"We've
  got into a devil of a mess, and I required to see you immediately."</p>

  <p>Sir Harry started, and turned pale. It was not the first "devil of a mess"
  by a good many that he had been in, but he felt he was getting too old for
  the process, and was beginning to be tired of it.</p>

  <p>"Those bills, I suppose," he observed, nervously; "I expected as
  much."</p>

  <p>Ropsley nodded. "We could have met the two," said he, "and renewed the
  third, had it not been for Green's rascality and Bolter's failure. However,
  it is too late to talk of all that now; read that letter, Sir Harry, and then
  tell me whether you do not think we are what Jonathan calls 'slightly up a
  tree.'"</p>

  <p>He handed the Baronet a lawyer's letter as he spoke. The latter grew paler
  and paler as he proceeded in its perusal; at its conclusion he crushed it in
  his hand, and swore a great oath.</p>

  <p>"I can do nothing more," he said, in a hoarse voice; "I am dipped now till
  I cannot get another farthing. The estate is so tied up with those accursed
  marriage-settlements, that I must not cut a stick of timber at my own door.
  If Bolter had paid we could have gone on. The villain! what right had he to
  incur liabilities he could not meet, and put honest men in the hole?"</p>

  <p>"What right, indeed?" answered the Guardsman, with a quiet smile, that
  seemed to say he thought the argument might apply to other cases than that of
  poor Bolter. "I am a man of no position, Sir Harry, and no property; if I go
  I shall scarcely be missed. Now with you it is different: your fall would
  make a noise in the world, and a positive crash down in Somersetshire" (the
  Baronet winced). "However, we should neither of us like to lose caste and
  character without an effort. Is there <i>nothing</i> can be done?"</p>

  <p>Sir Harry looked more and more perplexed. "Time," he muttered, "time; if
  we could only get a little time. Can't you see these fellows, my dear
  Ropsley, and talk to them a little, and show them their own interests? I give
  you carte blanche to act for me. I must trust all to you. I don't see my
  way."</p>

  <p>Ropsley pushed a wide red volume, something like an enlarged betting-book,
  across the table. It was his regimental order-book, and on its veracious
  columns was inscribed the appalling fact that "leave of absence had been
  granted to Lieutenant and Captain Ropsley for an indefinite period, on
  <i>urgent private affairs</i>." Sir Harry's hand trembled as he returned it.
  He had been so accustomed to consult his friend and confederate on all
  occasions, he had so completely acquired the habit of deferring to his
  judgment and depending on his energy, that he felt now completely at a loss
  as he thought of the difficulties he should have to face unassisted and
  alone. It was with unconcealed anxiety that he gasped out, "D&mdash; it,
  Ropsley, you don't mean to leave the ship just at the instant she gets
  aground!"</p>

  <p>"I have only secured my retreat, like a good general," answered Ropsley,
  with a smile; "but never fear, Sir Harry, I have no intention of leaving you
  in the lurch. Nevertheless, you are a man of more experience than myself, you
  have been at this sort of thing for a good many years: before we go any
  further, I should like to ask you once more, is there no plan you can hit
  upon, have you nothing to propose?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, on my honour," answered Sir Harry. "I am at my wits' end. The
  money must be got, and paid too, for these fellows won't hear of a
  compromise. I can't raise another farthing. You must have been cleared out
  long ago. Ropsley, it strikes me we are both beaten out of the field."</p>

  <p>"Not yet, Sir Harry," observed Ropsley, quietly; "I have a plan, if you
  approve of it, and think it can be done."</p>

  <p>"By Jove! I always said you were the cleverest fellow in England," burst
  out poor Sir Harry, eagerly grasping at the shadow of a chance. "Let us have
  it, by all means. Approve of it! I'll approve of anything that will only get
  us clear of this scrape. Come, out with it, Ropsley. What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Sir Harry," said Ropsley, for the Baronet was pacing nervously
  up and down the room; "let us talk things over quietly, and in a
  business-like manner. Ever since the day that I came over to Beverley from
  Everdon&mdash;(by the way, that was the first good bottle of claret I drank
  in Somersetshire)&mdash;ever since that day you and I have been intimate
  friends. I have profited by your experience and great knowledge of the world;
  and you, I think, have derived some advantage from my energy and painstaking
  in the many matters with which we have been concerned. I take all the credit
  of that affair about the mines in Argyllshire, and it would be affectation on
  my part to pretend I did not know I had been of great use to you in the
  business."</p>

  <p>"True enough, my dear fellow," answered the Baronet, looking somewhat
  alarmed; "if I had not sold, as you advised, I should have been 'done' that
  time, and I confess in all probability&mdash;" "ruined," the Baronet was
  going to say, but he checked himself, and substituted the expression, "much
  hampered now."</p>

  <p>"Well, Sir Harry," resumed his friend, "you and I are men of the world; we
  all know the humbug fellows talk about friendship and all that. It would be
  absurd for us to converse in such a strain, but yet a man has his likes and
  dislikes. You are one of the few people I care for, and I will do for you
  what I would not do for any other man on earth."</p>

  <p>Sir Harry stared. Though by no means a person of much natural penetration,
  he had yet an acquired shrewdness, the effect of long intercourse with his
  fellow-creatures, which bade him as a general rule to mistrust a kindness;
  and he looked now as if he scented a <i>quid pro quo</i> in the generous
  expressions of his associate.</p>

  <p>Ropsley kept his cold grey eye fixed on him, and proceeded&mdash;"I have
  already said, I am a 'man of straw,' and if I <i>go</i> it matters little to
  any one but myself. They will ask after me for two days in the bow-window at
  White's, and there will be an end of it. I sell out, which will not break my
  heart, as I hate soldiering; and I start quietly for the Continent, where I
  go to the devil my own way, and at my own pace. <i>Festina lente</i>; I am a
  reasonable man, and easily satisfied. You will allow that this is not your
  case."</p>

  <p>Poor Sir Harry could only shuffle uneasily in his chair, and bow his
  acquiescence.</p>

  <p>"Such being the state of affairs," proceeded Ropsley, and the hard grey
  eye grew harder than ever, and seemed to screw itself like a gimlet into the
  Baronet's working physiognomy; "such being the state of affairs, of course
  any sacrifice I make is offered out of pure friendship, regard, and esteem
  for yourself. Psha! it's nonsense talking like that! My dear fellow, I like
  you; I always have liked you; the pleasantest hours of my life have been
  spent in your house, and I'll see you out of this scrape, if I ruin myself,
  stock, lock, and barrel, for it!"</p>

  <p>Sir Harry flushed crimson with delight and surprise; yet the latter
  feeling predominated more than was pleasant, as he recollected the
  old-established principle of himself and his clique, "Nothing for nothing,
  and very little for a halfpenny."</p>

  <p>"Now, Sir Harry, I'll tell you what I will do. Five thousand will clear us
  for the present. With five thousand we could pay off the necessary debts,
  take up that bill of Sharon's, and get a fresh start. When they saw we were
  not completely floored, we could always renew, and the turn of the tide would
  in all probability set us afloat again. Now the question is, <i>how</i> to
  get at the five thousand? It will not come out of Somersetshire, I
  <i>think</i>?"</p>

  <p>Sir Harry shook his head, and laughed a hard, bitter laugh. "Not five
  thousand pence," he said, "if it was to save me from hanging to-morrow!"</p>

  <p>"And you really do not know which way to turn?"</p>

  <p>"No more than a child," answered Sir Harry. "If you fail me, I must give
  in. If you can help me, and <i>yourself too</i>, out of this scrape, why, I
  shall say what I always did&mdash;that you are the cleverest of fellows and
  the best of friends."</p>

  <p>"I think it can be done," said the younger man, but he no longer looked
  his friend in the face; and a faint blush, that faded almost on the instant,
  passed over his features. He had one card left in his hand; he had kept it to
  the last; he thought he ought to play it now. "I have never told you, Sir
  Harry, that I have a few acres in Ireland, strictly tied up in the hands of
  trustees, but with their consent I have power to sell. It is all the property
  I have left in the world; it will raise the sum we require, and&mdash;it
  shall follow the rest."</p>

  <p>This was true enough. Gambler, libertine, man of pleasure as he was,
  Ropsley had always kept an eye to the main chance. It was part of his system
  to know all sorts of people, and to be concerned in a small way with several
  speculative and money-making schemes. After the passing of the Irish
  Encumbered Estates Bill, it so happened that a fortunate investment at
  Newmarket had placed a few loose thousands to the credit side of our
  Guardsman's account at Cox and Co.'s. He heard casually of a capital
  investment for the same, within a day's journey of Dublin, as he was dining
  with a party of stock-jobbing friends in the City. Six hours afterwards
  Ropsley was in the train, and in less than six weeks had become the
  proprietor of sundry remunerative Irish acres, the same which he was now
  prepared unhesitatingly to sacrifice in the cause of gratitude, which with
  this philosopher, more than most men, might be fairly termed "a lively sense
  of benefits to come."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it shall follow the rest," he repeated, stirring the fire
  vigorously, and now looking studiously <i>away</i> from the man he was
  addressing,&mdash;"Sir Harry, you are a man of the world&mdash;you know me
  thoroughly, we cannot humbug each other. Although I would do much for your
  sake, you cannot think that a fellow sacrifices his last farthing simply
  because he and his confederate have made a mistake in their calculations. No,
  Sir Harry, your honour is dear to me as my own&mdash;nay, dearer, for I now
  wish to express a hope that we may become more nearly connected than we have
  ever been before, and that the ties of relationship may give me a right, as
  those of friendship have already made it a pleasure, to assist you to the
  best of my abilities."</p>

  <p>Sir Harry opened his mouth and pushed his chair back from the fire.
  Hampered, distressed, ruined as he was, it <i>did</i> seem a strong measure
  thus to sell Constance Beverley, so to speak, for "a mess of pottage"; and
  the bare idea of such a contract for the moment took away the Baronet's
  breath. Not that the notion was by any means a strange one to his mind; for
  the last two or three years, during which he had associated so much with the
  Guardsman, and had so many opportunities of appreciating his talents,
  shrewdness, and attractive qualities, the latter had been gradually gaining a
  complete ascendancy over his mind and character. Sir Harry was like a child
  in leading-strings in the hands of his confederate; and it had often occurred
  to him that it would be very pleasant, as as well as advantageous, always to
  have this mainstay on which to rely&mdash;this "ready-reckoner," and man of
  inexhaustible resources, to consult on every emergency. Vague ideas had
  sometimes crossed the Baronet's brain, that it was just possible his daughter
  might be brought to <i>like</i> well enough to marry (for <i>loving</i> was
  not a word in her father's vocabulary) an agreeable man, into whose society
  she was constantly thrown; and then, as Constance was an heiress, and the
  Baronet himself would be relieved from divers pecuniary embarrassments on her
  marriage, by the terms of a certain settlement with which we have nothing to
  do&mdash;why, it would be a delightful arrangement for all parties, and
  Ropsley could come and live at Beverley, and all be happy together.</p>

  <p>Such were the ideas that vaguely floated across the Baronet's mind in
  those moments of reflection of which he allowed himself so few; but he was a
  father, and a kind one, with all his faults; and it had never yet entered his
  head either to force his daughter's inclinations, or even to encourage with
  his own influence any suitor who was not agreeable to the young lady. He was
  fond of Constance, in his own way&mdash;fonder than of anything in the world,
  save his own comfort, and a very stirring and closely-contested race at
  Newmarket. So he looked, as indeed he felt, somewhat taken aback by Ropsley's
  proposal, which his own instinct as a gentleman told him was peculiarly
  ill-timed.</p>

  <p>He laughed nervously, and thanked his friend for his kindness.</p>

  <p>"With regard to&mdash;Miss Beverley," he stammered; "why&mdash;you know,
  my dear Ropsley,&mdash;business is business, and pleasure is pleasure.
  I&mdash;I&mdash;had no wish,&mdash;at least I had not made up my
  mind&mdash;or rather, I had no absolute intention that my daughter should
  settle so early in life. You are aware she is an heiress&mdash;a very great
  heiress" (Ropsley was indeed, or they would not have been at this point of
  discussion now), "and she might look to making a great match; in fact,
  Constance Beverley might marry anybody. Still, I never would thwart her
  inclinations; and if you think, my dear fellow, you can make yourself
  agreeable to her, why, I should make no objections, as you know there is no
  man that I should individually like better for a son-in-law than
  yourself."</p>

  <p>Ropsley rose, shook his new papa cordially by the hand, rang for luncheon,
  and rather to the Baronet's discomfiture, seemed to look upon it at once as a
  settled thing.</p>

  <p>"My business will not take long," said he, helping his guest to a large
  glassful of sherry. "You do not go abroad for another week; I can make all my
  arrangements, <i>our</i> arrangements, I should say, by that time. Why should
  we not travel together? My servant is the best courier in Europe; you will
  have no trouble whatever, only leave it all to me."</p>

  <p>Sir Harry hated trouble. Sir Harry liked the Continent. The scheme was
  exactly suited to his tastes and habits; so it was settled they should all
  start at once&mdash;a family party.</p>

  <p>And where is the young lady all this time? the prime origin of so much
  scheming, the motive power of all this mechanism? In the front drawing-room
  of the gloomy hotel she sits over the fire, buried deep in thought&mdash;to
  judge by her saddened countenance&mdash;not of the most cheering description.
  Above the fire-place hangs a large engraving of Landseer's famous
  Newfoundland dog, that "Member of the Humane Society" whom he has
  immortalised with his pencil. The lady sighs as she gazes on the broad,
  honest forehead, the truthful, intelligent face, the majestic attitude
  denoting strength in repose. Either the light is very bad in this room, or
  the glass over that engraving is dim and blurred, and the dog seems crouching
  in a mist, or are Constance Beverley's dark eyes dimmed with tears?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI. &mdash; "SURVEILLANCE"</h2>

  <p class="first">I did not question my friend as to his success in the
  <i>chasse</i>. Victor was evidently ill at ease, and after a few commonplace
  remarks returned to his apartments, from whence he did not reappear till
  dinner-time. Val&eacute;rie, too, was nowhere to be found, and I spent the
afternoon
  in the <i>salon</i> with a strange visitor, who was announced by the groom of
  the chambers as Monsieur Stein, and whose business at Edeldorf I confess I
  was at a loss to discover.</p>

  <p>The time passed agreeably enough. I was indisposed for reflection, a
  process which, under existing circumstances, could only have involved me in a
  labyrinth of perplexities; and my new acquaintance was possessed of a fund of
  information and small talk which must have been acquired by much intercourse
  with the world.</p>

  <p>He seemed perfectly familiar with English habits and English politics,
  professing great admiration for the one and interest in the other. He had
  <i>served</i> too, he said, although I did not make out exactly in what
  grade; and altogether he was evidently a man of varied experience and
  considerable acquirements.</p>

  <p>Silent as I naturally am, and especially reserved with strangers, there
  was something about my new acquaintance that led me to be communicative in
  spite of myself. His whole address and exterior were so thoroughly
  <i>confidential</i>, his manner so easy and unaffected; there was so much
  good-humour and <i>bonhommie</i> in his quiet smile and subdued enunciation,
  that I found myself almost unconsciously detailing events and imparting
  information with a facility of which I should have once thought I was
  incapable. Monsieur Stein listened, and bowed, and smiled, and put in a
  slight query here, or hazarded an observation there, which proved that he too
  was well acquainted with the topics on which I was enlarging; nor did he fail
  to compliment me on the lucid manner in which he was good enough to say I had
  explained to him the whole system of Turkish politics, and the relations of
  that tottering country with our own. As we went to make our toilets before
  dinner, I could not help asking my friend, the groom of the chambers, whose
  arm assisted me upstairs (ah! it was Val&eacute;rie's the night before!),
"who he
  was, this Monsieur Stein, who had arrived so unexpectedly, and had not yet
  seen the Count?" The man's face assumed a comical expression of mingled
  terror and disgust as he professed an utter ignorance of the guest; but when
  I added an inquiry as to whether he was a friend of Count Victor, his
  disclaimer was far more vigorous than the occasion seemed to demand. "Well,"
  thought I, "I shall know all about it from Val&eacute;rie this evening;" and
  proceeded with my toilet&mdash;shall I confess it?&mdash;with more pains than
  I had ever taken in my life before.</p>

  <p>But when we met at dinner a chill seemed to have fallen on our party,
  hitherto so merry and vivacious. Victor, though polite and courteous as ever,
  was reserved, absent, and out of spirits. Val&eacute;rie turned red and
white by
  turns, answered only by monosyllables, and never once allowed her eyes to
  wander in my direction. I, too, felt sad and preoccupied. My coming departure
  seemed to cast a damp over my spirits; and yet when I thought of
Val&eacute;rie's
  unconcealed regret, and frank avowal of interest in my future, my heart leapt
  with a strange, startling thrill, half of pleasure, half of pain. Monsieur
  Stein, however, appeared to suffer from none of these uncomfortable
  sensations. He ate, he drank, he talked, he made the agreeable, and amidst it
  all he seemed to note with a lynx-eye the gorgeous furniture, the glittering
  plate, the host of servants attired in their gaudy hussar uniforms, the
  choice wine, and excellent cookery, for which the <i>m&eacute;nage</i> of
Edeldorf
  had always been remarkable. In the brilliant light that shed its glare over
  the dining-table I was able to examine my new acquaintance more minutely than
  I had previously done before we went to dress. He seemed to me, without
  exception, the <i>least</i> remarkable man I had ever met. He was neither
  young nor old, neither dark nor fair, neither short nor tall, stout nor thin;
  his dress, that of a civilian, was plain and unstudied in the extreme; his
  demeanour, quiet and unaffected, was in admirable keeping with his whole
  exterior. There was nothing military about the man save a closely-clipped and
  carefully-trained moustache; but this warlike appendage was again
  contradicted by a slight stoop, and a somewhat hesitating gait, by no means
  that of a soldier. His eye, too, of a cold, dead grey, with light eyelashes,
  was soft and sleepy. Once I fancied I caught a lightning glance directed at
  Val&eacute;rie; but the orbs were so quickly veiled by their drooping lids
that I
  could not be satisfied it was more than a trick of my own imagination.
  Altogether M. Stein was a man that in England would have been described
  emphatically as "very gentlemanlike," for want of any more characteristic
  qualifications; in France he would have been passed over as an
  undemonstrative cipher; my friends the Turks would have conferred a silent
  approval on his quiet, unassuming demeanour. Why was it that in Hungary his
  presence should act as what we call at home "a wet blanket"?</p>

  <p>Dinner progressed slowly. Monsieur Stein addressed himself chiefly to
  Count de Rohan; and I could not help remarking that the latter's answers to
  his guest were marked by a caution and reserve totally foreign to his usual
  straightforward manner and off-hand way of saying whatever came uppermost.
  His air gave me the idea of a man who was determined not to be <i>pumped</i>.
  He drank less wine also than usual; and altogether was certainly not at his
  ease. Val&eacute;rie, too, whenever she raised her eyes from the tablecloth,
glanced
  uneasily towards Monsieur Stein; and when I made a casual remark to her,
  answered so absently and stiffly as to cause me for my part to feel
  uncomfortable and <i>de trop</i> in this small ill-organised party. It was a
  relief to all of us when coffee made its appearance, and the newly-arrived
  guest, giving his hand to Val&eacute;rie with a courtly bow, led her back to
the
  drawing-room, whilst I followed with Victor, and took the opportunity of
  whispering to my old friend, in English&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Who is this gentleman, Victor, that seems to know a little of everything
  and everybody, and whose thirst for information seems so unquenchable?"</p>

  <p>"Hush!" replied Victor, with an uneasy look at the couple in front of us;
  "he speaks English as well as you do, though I dare say he told you not. My
  dear Vere, for Heaven's sake, to-night sit still and hold your tongue!"</p>

  <p>At this instant Val&eacute;rie turned round, and addressed some trifling
  observation to her brother, but with a warning expression of countenance that
  seemed to tell him he had been overheard. The next moment we were seated
  round her work-table, chatting as gaily upon the merits of her embroidery as
  though we were all the most intimate friends in the world. Certainly ladies'
  work promotes conversation of the most harmless and least suspicious
  description; and I think it would indeed have been difficult to affix a
  definite meaning to the remarks made by any one of us on the intricacies of
  Countess Val&eacute;rie's stitching, or the skill displayed by that lady in
her
  graceful and feminine employment.</p>

  <p>The evening dragged on. Monsieur Stein conversed freely on the state of
  the country, the condition of the peasantry, the plans of the Government, and
  a projected railroad, for the construction of which he did not seem to think
  it possible the Austrian exchequer would ever be able to pay. Victor
  listened, and scarcely spoke; Val&eacute;rie seemed interested in the
railway, and
  determined to pursue that subject as long as possible; whilst I sat, out of
  spirits, and, truth to tell, out of humour, a silent observer of all three. I
  was deprived of my habitual occupations, and missed the care and interest to
  which I was accustomed as an invalid. Val&eacute;rie did not make my tea for
me as
  usual, nor explain to me, for the hundredth time, the cunning splendour of
  her embroidery, nor ask for my assistance in the thousand trifling ways with
  which a woman makes you fancy you are essential to her comfort; and I was
  childish enough to feel sad, if not a little sulky, in consequence. At last I
  lost patience, and throwing down abruptly the paper which I had been reading,
  I asked Countess Val&eacute;rie to "give us a little music," adding in perfect
  innocence, "Do play that beautiful march out of 'The
Honij&agrave;dy'&mdash;it is so
  inspiriting and so thoroughly national!"</p>

  <p>If a shell had fallen into the room, and commenced its whizzing operations
  under Val&eacute;rie's work-table, it could not have created greater
consternation
  than did my very natural request. The Countess turned deadly pale, and her
  hand trembled so that she could scarcely hold her needle. Victor rose from
  his chair with a tremendous oath, and walking off to the fire-place (for he
  was sufficiently an Englishman to prefer a grate to a stove), commenced
  stirring an already huge fire with much unnecessary energy, talking the whole
  time as if to drown my unlucky observation. Monsieur Stein flashed one of his
  lightning glances&mdash;there was no mistaking it this time&mdash;upon the
  whole of us, and then relapsed into his previous composure; whilst I felt
  that I had committed some unpardonable <i>gaucherie</i>, but could not, for
  the life of me, discover how or why.</p>

  <p>It was hopeless that evening to make any more attempts at conversation.
  Even the guest seemed to think he had exerted himself sufficiently, and at an
  earlier hour than usual we retired for the night. When I came down next
  morning he was gone.</p>

  <p>Victor did not appear at breakfast, and Val&eacute;rie's excuses for her
brother
  were delivered with a degree of restraint and formality which made me feel
  very uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"Victor was busy," she said, "with the steward and the land-agent. He had
  a great deal to do; he would not be at leisure for hours, but he would see me
  before he started on his journey."</p>

  <p>"Journey!" said I; "what journey does he mean to take? and what is all
  this mystery and confusion? Pardon me, Countess Val&eacute;rie, I am a
  straightforward man, Victor is my oldest friend, and I do claim to be in the
  secret, if I can be of any assistance or comfort to you in anything."</p>

  <p>She looked at me once more with the frank, confiding look that reminded me
  so of <i>another</i>; and putting her hand in mine, she said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I know we can trust you; I know <i>I</i> can trust you. Victor is
  <i>compromised</i>; he must go to Vienna to clear himself. He has yesterday
  received a hint that amounts indeed to an order. We are not even free to live
  on our own lands," she added bitterly, and with the old gleam of defiance
  flashing over her features; "the proudest noble in Hungary is but a serf
  after all."</p>

  <p>"And Monsieur Stein?" I asked, for I was beginning to penetrate the
  mystery.</p>

  <p>"Is an agent of police," she replied, "and one of the cleverest in the
  Emperor's service. Did you remark how <i>civil</i> we were forced to be to
  him? Did you not notice Victor's constrained and uncomfortable manner? Whilst
  he remained, that man was our master&mdash;that low-born spy our master! This
  is what we have come to. His mission was understood plainly enough by both of
  us. He came with a hint from the Emperor that we were very remiss in our
  attendance at Court; that his Imperial Majesty valued our loyalty too much to
  doubt its sincerity; and that it would be better, <i>all things
  considered</i>, if we were to spend the winter at Vienna. Also, I doubt not,
  information was required as to what our English friend was about; and when it
  is reported&mdash;as reported it will be&mdash;that his musical taste leads
  him to admire 'the march in the Honij&agrave;dy,' why we shall probably be
put under
  'surveillance' for six months, and be obliged to reside in the capital for a
  year or two, till we have got thoroughly Austrianised, when we shall return
  here, feeling our degradation more bitterly than ever."</p>

  <p>"And why may I not consult my own taste in music?" I inquired; "or what is
  there so deadly in that beautiful march which you play with such brilliancy
  and spirit?"</p>

  <p>Val&eacute;rie laughed.</p>

  <p>"Do you not know," said she, "that the Honij&agrave;dys were nearly
connected
  with our ancestors&mdash;that the De Rohans, originally Norman, only became
  Hungarian through their alliance with that princely family&mdash;a race who
  were never found wanting when it was necessary to assert the independence of
  their country? It was a Honij&agrave;dy that rolled the Turks back from the
very
  gates of Vienna. It was a Honij&agrave;dy that first resisted the oppression
of
  Austrian despotism. It was a Honij&agrave;dy that shed the last drop of
noble blood
  spilt in our late struggle for independence. The finest of our operas is
  founded on the history of this devoted family, and the Honij&agrave;dy march
is the
  very gathering tune of all who hate the iron yoke under which we groan. Only
  look at the faces of a Hungarian audience as they listen to its forbidden
  tones&mdash;for it must now only be played in secret&mdash;and you comprehend
  why, of all the airs that ever were composed, the last you should have asked
  for in the presence of Monsieur Stein was the march in 'The
Honij&agrave;dy.'"</p>

  <p>"I do truly regret my indiscretion," was my reply; "but if Victor is
  compelled to go to Vienna, I shall certainly accompany him. It is not my
  practice to abandon a friend, and <i>such</i> a friend, in his distress.
  Though I can be of little use, my presence may be some comfort and amusement
  to him; besides, the very fact of my proceeding straight into the lion's
  mouth will show that I have not been staying here with any ulterior
  views."</p>

  <p>"You are, indeed, true as steel," replied Val&eacute;rie, with a frank,
honest
  smile, that went straight to my heart. "We will all start together this very
  afternoon; and I am glad&mdash;at least it is far better&mdash;that you
  should not be parted from your nurse till you are quite strong again. Your
  presence will be a great comfort to my brother, who is&mdash;" Val&eacute;rie
  hesitated, blushed up to her forehead, and added, abruptly, "Mr. Egerton,
  have you not remarked any difference in Victor lately?"</p>

  <p>I replied, that "I thought his spirits were less mercurial than formerly,
  but that probably he had the anticipation of yesterday's domiciliary visit
  hanging over him, which would at once account for any amount of discontent
  and depression."</p>

  <p>"No, it is not that," answered Val&eacute;rie, with increasing
embarrassment. "It
  is worse even than that. My poor Victor! I know him so well&mdash;I love him
  so much! and he is breaking his noble heart for one who is totally unworthy
  of him. If there is one being on earth that I hate and despise more than
  another, it is a <i>coquette</i>," added the girl, with flashing eyes; "a
  woman who is so wanting in womanly pride as to lay herself out for
  admiration&mdash;so false to her own nature as to despise it when it is
  won."</p>

  <p>"All women like admiration," I ventured to interpose very humbly, for it
  struck me that the young Countess herself was in this respect no abnormal
  variety of her species; "and I conclude that in this, as in everything else,
  difficulty enhances the pleasure of success."</p>

  <p>She darted a reproachful look at me from under her dark eyelashes, but she
  had her say out notwithstanding.</p>

  <p>"No woman," she exclaimed, "has a right any more than a man, to trifle
  with the affections of another. Why should any one human being, for the sake
  of an hour's amusement, or the gratification of a mere passing vanity,
  inflict on another the greatest pain which mortal heart can suffer? You would
  be thought a monster so to torture the body; and are not the pangs of the
  soul infinitely worse to bear? No! I repeat it, she has deceived my brother
  with her silver accents and her false, false smiles; she is torturing the
  noblest, truest, kindest heart that ever brave man bore, and I hate her for
  it with a deadly, quenchless hatred!"</p>

  <p>I never found Val&eacute;rie so charming as when she thus played the
termagant.
  There was something so <i>piquante</i> in her wild, reckless manner on these
  occasions&mdash;in the flash of her bright eyes, the play of her chiselled
  features, and the attitude of her lithe, graceful figure, when she said she
  <i>hated</i>, that I could have found it in my heart to make her say she
  hated me rather than not hear the well-known word. I replied accordingly,
  rather mischievously I own&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Do you not think, Val&eacute;rie, you are throwing away a great deal of
  indignation unnecessarily? Men are not so sensitive as you seem to think. We
  do not break our hearts very readily, I assure you; and even when we do, we
  mend them again nearly as good as new. Besides, the rest of you take
  compassion on us when we are ill-treated by one. They console us, and we
  accept their consolation. If the rose is not in bloom, what shall prevent us
  from gathering the violet? Decidedly, Countess Val&eacute;rie, we are more
  philosophers than you."</p>

  <p>"You do not know Victor, if you say so," she burst forth. "You do not
  think as you speak. You are a dishonest reasoner, and you try to impose upon
  <i>me</i>! I tell you, <i>you</i> are the last man in the world to hold such
  opinions. You are wrong, and you know you are wrong, and you only speak thus
  to provoke me. I judge of others by myself. I believe that all of us are more
  or less alike, and I know that <i>I</i> could never forgive such an injury.
  What! to be led on day by day, to feel if not to confess a preference, to
  find it bit by bit eating into one's being, till at length one belongs no
  longer to oneself, but knows one's whole existence to be wrapped up in
  another, and then at the last moment to discover that one has been deceived!
  that one has been giving gold for silver! that the world is empty, and the
  heart dead for ever! I know what I should do."</p>

  <p>"What <i>would</i> you do?" I asked, half amused and half alarmed at her
  excited gestures.</p>

  <p>"Take a De Rohan's revenge, if I broke my heart for it the next instant,"
  she replied: and then, as if ashamed of her enthusiasm, and the passion into
  which she had very unnecessarily put herself, rushed from the room.</p>

  <p>"What a dangerous lady to have anything to do with," I remarked to Bold,
  as he rose from the hearthrug, with a stretch and a yawn. "Well, old dog, so
  you and I are bound for Vienna this afternoon; I wonder what will come of it
  all?"</p>

  <p>Yet there was a certain pleasant excitement about my position, too. It was
  evident that Val&eacute;rie took more than a common interest in her brother's
  friend. Her temper had become very variable of late; and I had remarked that
  although, until the scene in the garden, she had never shunned my society,
  she had often appeared provoked at any expression of opinion which I chanced
  to hazard contrary to her own. She had also of late been constantly absent,
  <i>distraite</i>, and preoccupied, sometimes causelessly satirical, bitter,
  and even rude, in her remarks. What could it all mean? was I playing with
  edged tools? It might be so. Never mind, never mind, Bold; anything,
  <i>anything</i> for excitement and forgetfulness of the days gone by.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII. &mdash; GHOSTS OF THE PAST</h2>

  <p class="first">Every one has heard of the gentleman who went to spend a
  fortnight at Vienna in the prime of his youth, and died there at a ripe old
  age, having never afterwards been beyond the walls of the town. Though the
  climate is allowed to be detestable, the heat of summer being aggravated by a
  paucity of shade and a superabundance of dust, whilst the rigorous cold of
  winter is enhanced by the absence of fire-places and the scarcity of fuel;
  though the streets are narrow and the carriages numerous, the hotels always
  full, and the shops very dear; though the police is strict and officious to a
  degree, and its regulations tyrannical in the extreme; though every house,
  private as well as public, must be closed at ten o'clock, and a ball-giver or
  lady who "receives" must have a special permission from the
  Government,&mdash;yet, with all these drawbacks, no city in the world, not
  even lively Paris itself, seems so popular with pleasure-seekers as Vienna.
  There is a gaiety in the very air of the town: a smiling, prosperous
  good-humour visible on the countenances of its inhabitants, a picturesque
  beauty in the houses, a splendid comfort in the shops, and a taste and
  magnificence in the public buildings, which form a most attractive <i>tout
  ensemble</i>.</p>

  <p>Then you lead a pleasant, cheerful, do-nothing sort of life. You have your
  coffee in bed, where you can also read a novel in perfect comfort, for German
  beds have no curtains to intercept the morning light, or make a bonfire of
  the nocturnal student. You perform an elaborate toilet (are not Vienna gloves
  the only good fits in the world?), and you breakfast about noon in the
  <i>salon</i> of some luxurious hotel, where you may sit peradventure between
  an Austrian Field-Marshal, decorated with a dozen or so of orders, and a
  Polish beauty, who counts captives by the hundred, and breaks hearts by the
  score. Neither will think it necessary to avoid your neighbourhood as if you
  had confluent small-pox, and your eye as if you were a basilisk, simply
  because you have not had the advantage of their previous acquaintance. On the
  contrary, should the courtesies of the table or any chance occurrence lead
  you to hazard a remark, you will find the warrior mild and benevolent, the
  beauty frank and unaffected. Even should you wrap yourself up in your truly
  British reserve, they will salute you when they depart; and people may say
  what they will about the humbug and insincerity of mere politeness, but there
  can be no doubt that such graceful amenities help to oil the wheels of life.
  Then if you like to walk, have you not the Prater, with its fine old trees
  and magnificent red deer, and its endless range of woodland scenery,
  reminding you of your own Windsor forest at home; if you wish to drive, there
  is much beautiful country in the immediate vicinity of the town; or would you
  prefer a quiet chat in the friendly intimacy of a morning visit, the Viennese
  ladies are the most conversational and the most hospitable in the world. Then
  you dine at half-past five, because the opera begins at seven, and with such
  a band who would miss the overture? Again, you enter a brilliant,
  well-lighted apartment, gay with well-dressed women and Austrian officers in
  their handsome uniforms, all full of politeness, <i>bonhommie</i>, and real
  kindness towards a stranger. Perhaps you occupy the next table to Meyerbeer,
  and you are more resolved than ever not to be too late. At seven you enjoy
  the harmony of the blessed, at a moderate outlay that would hardly pay for
  your entrance half-price to a farce in a London theatre, and at ten o'clock
  your day is over, and you may seek your couch.</p>

  <p>I confess I liked Vienna very much. My intimacy with Victor gave me at
  once an introduction into society, and my old acquaintance with the German
  language made me feel thoroughly at home amongst these frank and warm-hearted
  people. It has always appeared to me that there is more homely kindliness,
  more <i>heart</i>, and less straining after effect in German society than in
  any other with which I am acquainted. People are less artificial in Vienna
  than in Paris or in London, better satisfied to be taken for what they really
  are, and not what they wish to be, more tolerant of strangers, and less
  occupied about themselves.</p>

  <p>I spent my days very happily. Victor had recovered his spirits, those
  constitutional good spirits that in the young it requires so much suffering
  to damp, that once lost never return again. Val&eacute;rie was charming as
ever, it
  may be a little more reserved than formerly, but all the more kind and
  considerate on that account; then when I wearied of society and longed for
  solitude and the indulgence of my own reflections, could I not pace those
  glorious galleries of ancient art, and feast my eyes upon the masterpieces of
  Rubens or Franceschini, in the Hotel Liechtenstein and the Belvedere? My
  father's blood ran in my veins, and although I had always lacked execution to
  become a painter, keenly and dearly could I appreciate the excellencies of
  the divine art. Ah! those Rubenses, I can see them now! the glorious athletic
  proportions of the men, heroes and champions every one; the soft, sensuous
  beauty of the women,&mdash;none of your angels, or goddesses, or idealities,
  but, better still, warm, breathing, loving, palpable women, the energy of
  action, the majesty of repose, the drawing, the colouring, but above all the
  honest manly sentiment that pervades every picture. The direct intention so
  truthfully carried out to bid the human form and the human face express the
  passions and the feelings of the human heart. I could look at them for
  hours.</p>

  <p>Val&eacute;rie used to laugh at me for what she called my new
passion&mdash;my
  devotion to art; the goddess whom I had so neglected in my childhood, when
  with my father's assistance I might have wooed and won from her some scraps
  of favour and encouragement. One morning I prevailed on Victor and his sister
  to accompany me to the Hotel Liechtenstein, there to inspect for the
  hundredth time what the Countess termed my "last and fatal attachment," a
  Venus and Adonis of Franceschini, before which I could have spent many a long
  day, quenching the thirst of the eye. It was in my opinion the
  <i>chef-d'oeuvre</i> of the master; and yet, taking it as a whole, there was
  no doubt it was far from a faultlessly-painted picture. The Adonis appeared
  to me stiffly and unskilfully drawn, as he lay stretched in slumber, with his
  leash of hounds, undisturbed by the nymphs peering at him from behind a tree,
  or the fat golden-haired Cupids playing on the turf at his feet. All this
  part of the picture I fancied cold and hard; but it was the Venus herself
  that seemed to me the impersonation of womanly beauty and womanly love.
  Emerging from a cloud, with her blue draperies defining the rounded symmetry
  of her form, and leaving one exquisite foot bare, she is gazing on the
  prostrate hunter with an expression of unspeakable tenderness and
  self-abandonment, such as comes but once in a lifetime over woman's face. One
  drooping hand carelessly lets an arrow slip through its fingers, the other
  fondling a rosy Cupid on her knee, presses his cheek against her own, as
  though the love overflowing at her heart must needs find relief in the
  caresses of her child.</p>

  <p>"It is my favourite picture of all I ever saw, except one," I remarked to
  my two companions as we stopped to examine its merits; I to point out its
  beauties, they maliciously to enumerate its defects.</p>

  <p>"And that other?" asked Val&eacute;rie, with her quick, sharp glance.</p>

  <p>"Is one you never saw," was my reply, as I thought of the "Dido" in the
  old dining-room at Beverley. "It is an Italian painting with many faults, and
  probably you would not admire it as much as I do."</p>

  <p>Val&eacute;rie was not listening; her attention was fixed on a party of
strangers
  at the other end of the room. "<i>Tenez, ce sont des Anglais</i>," said she,
  with that intuitive perception of an islander which seems born in all
  continental nations. I knew it before she spoke. The party stopped and turned
  round&mdash;two gentlemen and a lady. I only saw <i>her</i>; of all the
  faces, animate and inanimate, that looked downward with smiles, or upward
  with admiration, in that crowded gallery, there was but one to me, and that
  one, was Constance Beverley's.</p>

  <p>I have a confused recollection of much hand-shaking and "How-do-you-do's?"
  and many expressions of wonder at our meeting <i>there</i>, of all places in
  the world, which did not strike me as so <i>very</i> extraordinary after all.
  And Val&eacute;rie was <i>so</i> enchanted to make Miss Beverley's
acquaintance; she
  had heard so much of her from Victor, and it was so delightful they should
  all be together in Vienna just at this gay time; and was as affectionate and
  demonstrative as woman always is with her sister; and at the same time
  scanned her with a comprehensive glance, which seemed to take in at once the
  charms of mind and body, the graces of nature and art, that constituted the
  weapons of her competitor. For women are always more or less rivals; and with
  all her keenness of affections and natural softness of disposition, there is
  an unerring instinct implanted in the breast of every one of the gentler sex,
  which teaches her that her normal state is one of warfare with her
  kind&mdash;that "her hand is against every woman, and every woman's hand
  against her."</p>

  <p>I dared not look in Miss Beverley's face as I shook her hand; I fancied
  her voice was <i>harder</i> than it used to be. I was sure her manner to
  <i>me</i> was as cold as the merest forms of politeness would admit. She took
  Victor's arm, however, with an air of <i>empressement</i> very foreign to the
  reserve which I remembered was so distinguishing a characteristic in her
  demeanour. I heard her laughing at his remarks, and recalling to him scenes
  in London and elsewhere, which seemed to afford great amusement to themselves
  alone. Even Ropsley looked graver than usual, but masked his astonishment, or
  whatever it was, under a great show of civility to Val&eacute;rie, who
received his
  attentions, as she did those of every stranger, with a degree of pleasure
  which it was not in her nature to conceal. Sir Harry fell to my share, and I
  have a vague recollection of his being more than ever patronising and
  paternal, and full of good advice and good wishes; but the treasures of his
  wisdom and his little worldly sarcasms were wasted on a sadly heedless
  ear.</p>

  <p>I put him into his carriage, where <i>she</i> was already seated. I
  ventured on one stolen look at the face that had been in my dreams, sleeping
  and waking, for many a long day. It was pale and sad; but there was a hard,
  fixed expression that I did not recognise, and she never allowed her eyes to
  meet mine.</p>

  <p>How cold the snowy streets looked; and the dull grey sky, as we walked
  home to our hotel&mdash;Victor and Ropsley on either side of Val&eacute;rie,
whilst
  I followed, soberly and silently, in the rear.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII. &mdash; LA DAME AUX CAMELLIAS</h2>

  <p class="first">"My dear, you <i>must</i> go to this ball," said Sir Harry
  to his daughter, as they sat over their morning chocolate in a spacious room
  with a small glazed stove, very handsome, very luxurious, and <i>very
  cold</i>. "You have seen everything else here; you have been a good deal in
  society. I have taken you everywhere, although you know how 'going out' bores
  me; and now you refuse to go to the best thing of the year. My dear, you
  <i>must</i>!"</p>

  <p>"But a masked ball, papa," urged Constance. "I never went to one in my
  life; indeed, if you please, I had rather not."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, child, everybody goes; there's your friend Countess
Val&eacute;rie
  wild about it, and Victor, and even sober Vere Egerton, but of course
  <i>he</i> goes in attendance on the young Countess&mdash;besides, Ropsley
  wishes it."</p>

  <p>Constance flushed crimson, then grew white, and bit her lip. "Captain
  Ropsley's wishes have nothing to do with me, papa," said she, with more than
  her usual stateliness; "I do not see what right he has to express a wish at
  all."</p>

  <p>Sir Harry rose from his chair; he was getting very feeble in his limbs,
  though he stoutly repudiated the notion that he grew a day older in strength
  and spirits. He walked twice across the room, went to his daughter's chair,
  and took her hand in his. She knew what was coming, and trembled all
  over.</p>

  <p>"My dear child," said he, with a shaky attempt at calmness, and a nervous
  quivering of his under lip&mdash;for loving, obedient, devoted as she was;
  Sir Harry stood in awe of his daughter&mdash;"you remind me I wish to speak
  to you on the subject of Captain Ropsley, and his intimacy with ourselves.
  Constance, has it never occurred to you what all this must eventually lead
  to?"</p>

  <p>She looked up at him with her clear, shining eyes, and replied&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It has, papa, and I quite dread the end of it."</p>

  <p>"You know, dear, how I have encouraged him," continued her father, without
  noticing the unpropitious remark; "you can guess my wishes without my
  speaking more plainly. He is an excellent fellow&mdash;clever, popular,
  agreeable, and good-looking. There can be no objection, of course, on
  <i>your</i> side. I think your old father has not done so badly for you after
  all&mdash;eh, Constance?" and Sir Harry made a feeble attempt at a laugh,
  which stopped, and, as it were, "went out" all of a sudden.</p>

  <p>She looked him full in the face. Truth shone brightly in the depths of
  those clear eyes.</p>

  <p>"Papa," said she, slowly and steadily, "do you really mean you wish me
  to&mdash;to marry Captain Ropsley?"</p>

  <p>"You ladies jump at conclusions very fast," answered the Baronet, still
  striving, shakingly, to be jocose. "<i>Rem acu tetigisti</i>. Ha, ha! I have
  not forgotten my Latin, or that I was young once, my dear. You have run your
  needle into the very heart of the matter, you little witch! That is indeed my
  earnest wish and intention."</p>

  <p>He changed at once into a tone of majestic and uncompromising decision,
  but he only looked at her askance, and once more left his place to amble up
  and down the room. She never took her eye off his face.</p>

  <p>"And suppose I should tell you, papa, that I cannot comply with your wish;
  that I hate and loathe the very sight of the man whom you would make my
  husband; that I fear and distrust his intimacy with you more than anything in
  the world; that I implore you, papa, dear papa, to give up this dreadful
  idea; that for this once, and once only, you would listen to me, be guided by
  me, and, at any sacrifice, that you would break immediately and for ever with
  that bad, reckless, unprincipled man&mdash;what should you say then?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him for an instant with a vague sort of half-hope in her
  truthful, shining eyes; but it was more resignation than disappointment that
  clouded her face over immediately afterwards.</p>

  <p>"Say, my dear," answered the Baronet, gaily, but his teeth were set tight
  as he spoke; "why I should say that my girl was a romantic little fool,
  instead of one of the cleverest women of my acquaintance; or, more likely
  still, I should say she was joking, in order to try her father's patience and
  indulgence to the utmost. Listen to me, Constance. I have reasons of my own
  for wishing to see you married&mdash;of course I mean well married, and
  safely settled in life&mdash;never mind what they are; it may be that I am
  getting old, and feel that I have not much time to lose. Well, I have
  promised you to Ropsley&mdash;of course with your own consent. In these days
  we don't lock up our refractory children, or use force when persuasion alone
  is necessary. Heaven forbid!" Sir Harry said it with an expression of
  countenance somewhat contradictory of his language. "But I feel sure I need
  only point out to you what my wishes are to have your sincere co-operation.
  You behaved so well once before, you will behave well this time. Constance, I
  am not used to entreat; you cannot surely refuse me now?"</p>

  <p>She burst into tears</p>

  <p>"Oh, papa," she said, "anything&mdash;anything but this."</p>

  <p>He thought to try the old sarcastic mood that had done him good service
  with many a woman before.</p>

  <p>"What, we are premature, are we, Miss Beverley? We cannot forget old days
  and childish absurdities. We must, of course, be more sensitive than our
  boyish adorer. Psha! my dear, it's perfectly absurd; why, you can see with
  your own eyes that Vere Egerton is hopelessly entangled with that bold
  Hungarian girl, and I can tell you, to my certain knowledge, that he is to
  marry her forthwith. What she can see in his ugly face is more than I can
  make out; but this I suppose is prejudice on my part. Good Heaven! Constance,
  are you really afraid of seeing them together to-night? You!
  <i>my</i>daughter! the proud Miss Beverley?"</p>

  <p>The old reprobate knew how to manage a woman still. He had served a long
  apprenticeship to the trade, and paid pretty dearly for his lessons in his
  time.</p>

  <p>She did not cry now.</p>

  <p>"Papa, I will go to the ball," was all she said; and Sir Harry thought it
  wiser to push matters no further for the present.</p>

  <p>Our little party had been established in Vienna for several weeks when the
  above-mentioned conversation took place; and the De Rohans were living on
  terms of close intimacy with the Beverleys. Ropsley made no secret of his
  engagement to Constance, and bestowed all the attentions of a future husband
  on the unwilling girl with a tact which made escape impossible. Victor took
  his place as an old friend by her side, and she seemed to find the more
  pleasure in his society that it relieved her from the Guardsman's sarcastic
  though amusing conversation, and, as I once overheard her remark, with a deep
  sigh, "reminded her of old times." Val&eacute;rie and I were, as usual,
inseparable;
  but there was something of late in the manner of the young Countess which
  grated on my feelings. She was gay, volatile, demonstrative as ever; but I
  missed those fits of abstraction, that restless, preoccupied air which seems
  so charming when we fancy we can guess the cause; and altogether I never was
  so much in danger of falling in love with Val&eacute;rie as now, when, piqued,
  hopeless, and miserable, I felt I was uncared for by every one on
  earth&mdash;even by her. I was one too many in the party. Sir Harry seemed
  worldly, sharp, and in good spirits, as usual. Ropsley scheming, composed,
  self-contained, and successful. Victor lively, careless, and like his former
  self again. Constance haughty and reserved, habitually silent, and preserving
  an exterior of icy calmness. Val&eacute;rie sparkling, triumphant, and
  <i>coquette</i> as possible. Only Bold and I were out of spirits; the old dog
  resenting with truly British energy the indignity of an enforced muzzle,
  without which no animal of his species was allowed to go at large in the
  streets of Vienna; whilst his master was wearied and ill at ease, tired of an
  aimless, hopeless life, and longing for the excitement of action, or the
  apathy of repose.</p>

  <p>Such were the ingredients of the party that dined together at that
  well-known hotel rejoicing in the appellation of "Munsch," on the day of the
  masked ball, to which all Vienna meant to go, to be mystified for pleasure,
  and have its secrets told and its weaknesses published for amusement.</p>

  <p>Many were the glances of admiration cast at our table, and many, I doubt
  not, were the comparisons made between the stately beauty of the Englishwoman
  and the brilliant charms of her Hungarian friend. I sat next to
Val&eacute;rie, and
  opposite Miss Beverley&mdash;the latter scarcely ever spoke to me now, and,
  save a formal greeting when we met and parted, seemed completely to ignore my
  existence; but she tolerated Bold, and the dog lay curled up under the table
  at her feet, keeping watch and ward over her&mdash;faithful Bold!&mdash;as he
  used to do long, long ago. Ropsley held forth upon the political state of
  Europe; and although Victor and Sir Harry expressed loudly their admiration
  of his sentiments, and the lucid manner in which he expressed them, I have
  yet reason to believe that, as he spoke in English, a very garbled and
  eccentric translation of his remarks reached the imperial and kingly bureau
  of police. Constance and Val&eacute;rie seemed to have some secret
understanding
  which called forth a smile even on the pale face of the former, whilst the
  latter was exuberant in mirth and spirits, and was ardently anticipating the
  pleasures of the ball. I was roused from my dreamy state of abstraction by
  her lively voice.</p>

  <p>"Vere," she exclaimed, with a sly glance across the table at her friend,
  "we are engaged for the first dance, you know."</p>

  <p>She always called me "Vere," now, in imitation of her brother.</p>

  <p>"Are we?" was my somewhat ungallant reply. "I was not aware of it, I do
  not think I shall go to the ball."</p>

  <p>"Not go to the ball!" exclaimed Val&eacute;rie; "and I have told you the
colour
  of my dress and everything. Not go to the ball! do you hear him, Victor? do
  you hear him, Sir Harry? do you hear him, Captain Ropsley?"</p>

  <p>"We can hardly believe it," replied the latter, with a quiet smile; "but,
  Countess Val&eacute;rie, he does not deserve your confidence: will you not
tell
  <i>us</i> what your dress is to be?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody but Vere," persisted the Countess, with another arch smile at
  Constance; "you know he is engaged to me, at least for this evening. But he
  is cross and rude, and deserves to be mystified and made unhappy. But
  seriously, Vere, you <i>will</i> go? Ask him, Miss Beverley; he won't refuse
  <i>you</i>, although he is so ungallant towards <i>me</i>."</p>

  <p>Constance looked up for a moment, and in a dry, measured voice, like a
  child repeating a lesson, said, "I hope you will go, Mr. Egerton;" and then
  resumed the study of her plate, paler and more reserved than ever.</p>

  <p>I heard Bold's tail wagging against the floor. "What have I done to offend
  her," I thought, "that she will thus scarcely even deign to speak to me?" I
  bowed constrainedly, and said nothing; but the torture was beginning to get
  more severe than I could bear, and making an excuse that I should be late for
  the opera, whither none of my companions were going, I hurried from the
  table, Val&eacute;rie giving me as I rose a camellia from her bouquet, and
charging
  me to return it to her at the ball. "I shall count upon you, Vere," she said,
  as I adjusted it in my coat, "and keep myself disengaged."</p>

  <p>I threaded my way through the dirty streets to the opera. I ensconced
  myself in the corner of the De Rohans' box; and resting my head on my hand, I
  began to reflect for the first time for many weeks on my position and my
  prospects. I could not conceal from myself that I was no longer justified in
  living on the terms of intimacy with Victor and his sister which had so long
  constituted such an agreeable distraction in my life. It was evident that
  Val&eacute;rie considered me in the light of something more than a friend,
and it
  was due to the lady, to her brother, and to myself, that such a misconception
  should be rectified at once and for ever. I was well aware in my heart of
  hearts that Constance Beverley was still, as she would always be, the idol of
  my life, but I was too proud to confess this even to myself. It was evident
  that she cared no longer for the friend of her childhood, that she was
  totally indifferent as to what became of the nameless, ill-starred adventurer
  who had once presumed to ask her to be his; and I ground my teeth as I told
  myself I was too proud, far too proud, to care for any woman that did not
  care for me. But I could not lead this life of inaction and duplicity any
  longer. No, I was well now, I was able to walk again (and I thought of my
  gentle nurse with a sigh). I would not go to the ball to-night; I would leave
  Vienna to-morrow; it was far better not to see Miss Beverley again, better
  for me at least, and ought I not to consult my own interest first? Others
  were selfish. I would be selfish too! Even Val&eacute;rie, I had no doubt,
was just
  like all other women; she wouldn't care, not she! And yet she was a frank,
  open-hearted girl, too. Poor Val&eacute;rie! And mechanically I placed the
camellia
  she had given me to my lips, and raised my eyes to examine the house for the
  first time since my entrance.</p>

  <p>What was my surprise to remark the action I have just described imitated
  exactly by a lady in a box opposite mine, but whose face was so turned away
  from me, and so masked, moreover, by a bouquet she held in her hand, that I
  could not identify her features, or even make out whether she was young or
  old, handsome or plain! All I could see was a profusion of rich brown hair,
  and a well-turned arm holding the bouquet aforesaid, with the odours of which
  she seemed much gratified, so perseveringly did she apply it to her face.
  After a short interval, I adjusted my opera-glass and took a long survey of
  the flower-loving dame. As soon as she was sure she had attracted my
  attention, she once more applied the white camellia to her lips with much
  energy and fervour, still, however, keeping her face as far as possible
  turned away from me, and shaded by the curtains of her box. Three times this
  absurd pantomime was enacted. So strong a partiality for so scentless a
  flower as the camellia could not be accidental; and at last I made up my mind
  that, in all probability, she mistook me for somebody else, and would soon
  find out her error without my giving myself any further trouble on the
  subject. I had too much to occupy my own mind to distress myself very long
  about the <i>Dame aux Camellias</i>; and I turned my attention to the stage,
  to seek relief, if only for half-an-hour, from the thoughts that were
  worrying at my heart.</p>

  <p>The ballet of <i>Sattinella</i> was being enacted, and a man must have
  been indeed miserable who could entirely withdraw his attention from the
  magnificent figure of Marie Taglioni, as she bounded about in the character
  of that fire-born Temptress, a very impersonation of grace, symmetry, beauty,
  and <i>diablerie</i>. The moral of the piece is very properly not developed
  till the end, and it is too much to expect of a human heart that it shall
  sympathise with the unfortunate victim of Satan's charming daughter as long
  as his tortures are confined to performing wondrous bounds towards the
  footlights in her fiendish company, and resting her diabolical form upon his
  knee in the most graceful and bewitching attitude that was ever invented
  below, and sent up expressly for the delectation of a Viennese audience.
  Neither did I think the "first male dancer" very much to be pitied when he
  was inveigled into a beautiful garden by moonlight, where he discovered the
  whole <i>corps de ballet</i> arranged in imitation of statues, in the most
  fascinating of <i>poses plastiques</i>, and so well drilled as scarcely even
  to wink more than the very marble it was their part to represent. Soft music
  playing the whole time, and fountains, real fountains, spouting and splashing
  the entire depth of the stage, constituted the voluptuous accessories of the
  scene, and it was not till the senses of the spectators had been thoroughly
  entranced by beauty and melody&mdash;by all that could fascinate the eye and
  charm the ear, that the whole spectacle changed to one of infernal splendour;
  the fountains becoming fireworks, the pure and snowy statues turning to
  gorgeous she-devils of the most diabolical beauty and fierceness, whilst
  Sattinella herself, appearing in a bewitching costume of crimson and flames,
  carried off the bewildered victim of her blandishments, to remain bound to
  her for ever in the dominions of her satanic father.</p>

  <p>Having once got him, it is understood that she will never let him go
  again, and I could not pity him very sincerely notwithstanding.</p>

  <p>The opera was over, the company rapidly departing, and I stood alone at
  the stove in the crush-room, wondering why the house was not burnt down every
  time this beautiful ballet was performed, and speculating lazily between
  whiles as to whether I was ever likely to witness an opera again. I was one
  of the last spectators left in the house, and was preparing to depart, when a
  female figure, cloaked and hooded, passed rapidly under my very nose, and as
  she did so, pressed a camellia to her lips in a manner which admitted of no
  misconception as to her motive. I could not see her face, for a black satin
  hood almost covered it, but I recognised the rounded arm and the handsome
  bouquet which I had before remarked in the opposite box. Of course I gave
  instantaneous chase, and equally of course came up with the lady before she
  reached her carriage. She turned round as she placed her foot on the step,
  and dropped her fan upon the muddy pavement; I picked it up, and returned it
  to her with a bow. She thanked me in French, and whispered hurriedly,
  "Monsieur will be at the Redouten-Saal to-night?" I was in no humour for an
  adventure, and answered "No." She repeated in a marked manner, "Yes, monsieur
  will be at the ball; monsieur will find himself under the gallery of the
  Emperor's band at midnight. <i>De grace</i>, monsieur will not refuse this
  <i>rendezvous</i>."</p>

  <p>"I had not intended to go," was my unavoidable reply, "but of course to
  please Madame it was my duty to make any sacrifice. I would be at the
  appointed place at the appointed time."</p>

  <p>She thanked me warmly and earnestly. "She had travelled night and day for
  a week, the roads were impassable, frightful, the fatigue unheard of. She had
  a <i>migraine</i>, she had not slept for nights, and yet she was going to
  this ball. I would not fail her, I would be sure to be there.
  <i>Adieu</i>&mdash;no, <i>au revoir</i>."</p>

  <p>So the carriage drove off, splashing no small quantity of mud over my face
  and toilet. As I returned to my hotel to dress, I wondered what was going to
  happen <i>now</i>.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch29"
     name="ch29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX. &mdash; "A MERRY MASQUE"</h2>

  <p class="first">It was a beautiful sight, one calculated to inspire feelings
  of mirth and gaiety, even in a heart ill at ease with itself. Such a
  ball-room as the Redouten-Saal is perhaps hardly to be seen elsewhere in
  Europe. Such music I will venture to say can only be heard in Vienna, where
  the whole population, from the highest to the lowest, seem to live only that
  they may dance. Everybody knows the effect of brilliant light on the animal
  spirits; the walls of these magnificent rooms are of a pale fawn colour,
  almost approaching to white&mdash;the very shade that best refracts and
  enhances the effect of hundreds of wax candles, shedding their soft radiance
  on the votaries of pleasure below. No wonder people are in good spirits; no
  wonder they throng the spacious halls, or parade the long galleries above,
  and looking down from their elevated position, pass many a pointed jest and
  humorous sally on the varied scene that crowds the floor below. No wonder
  they frequent the refreshment-rooms that skirt these galleries, and flirt and
  talk nonsense, and quiz each other with the cumbrous vivacity of the Saxon
  race. When I entered from the quiet street I was dazzled by the glare, and
  almost stupefied by the hum of many voices, and the pealing notes of one of
  those waltzes which Strauss seems to have composed expressly to remind the
  fallen children of Adam of their lost Paradise. From a boy music has made me
  melancholy&mdash;the sweeter the sadder; and although it is a morbid unmanly
  feeling, which I have striven hard to overcome, it has always conquered me,
  it will always conquer me to the last. I felt bitterly out of place amongst
  these pleasure-worshippers. What had I to do here, where all were merry and
  full of enjoyment? My very dress was out of keeping with the scene, for I was
  one of a very small minority in civil attire. Gorgeous uniforms, white, blue,
  and green, glittered all over the ball-room; for in Austria no officer
  nowadays ever appears out of uniform; and as an army of six hundred thousand
  men is officered almost exclusively from the aristocracy, the fair ball-goers
  of Vienna find no lack of partners in gaudy and warlike attire. The ladies
  were all masked; not so their respective cavaliers, it being part of the
  amusement of these balls that the gentler sex alone should appear
  <i>incognito</i>, and so torment their natural prey at more than their usual
  advantage; thus many a poisoned dart is planted, many a thrust driven
  securely home, without a chance of a parry or fear of a return. Though Pity
  is represented in a female garb, it seems to me that woman, when she does
  strike, strikes harder, straighter, swifter, more unsparingly than man.
  Perhaps she suffers as much as she inflicts, and this makes her ruthless and
  reckless&mdash;who knows? if so, she would rather die than acknowledge it.
  These are not thoughts for a ball, and yet they crowded on me more and more
  as I stood under the musicians' gallery, gazing vacantly at the throng.</p>

  <p>Victor and his party had not yet arrived. I was sure to distinguish them
  by Ropsley's scarlet uniform, and I was also sure that in such an assemblage
  of military connoisseurs the costume of Queen Victoria's body-guard would
  attract observation and remark that could not pass unnoticed even by so
  preoccupied a spectator as myself. Besides, I knew the colour of
Val&eacute;rie's
  dress; it was to be pink, and of some fabric, beautiful exceedingly, of which
  I had forgotten the name as soon as told. I was consequently sure of finding
  them whenever I wished, so I stood quietly in my corner, and watched the
  crowd go by, without caring to mingle in the stream or partake of the
  amusements every one else seemed to find so delightful. How poor and vapid
  sounded the conversation of the passers-by; how strained the efforts at wit;
  how forced and unnatural the attempts at mystification! The Germans are too
  like ourselves to sustain for any length of time the artificial pace of
  badinage and repartee. It is not the genius of the nation, and they soon come
  to a humble jog-trot of old trite jokes, or, worse still, break down
  completely, and stop once for all. The only man that seemed in his element
  was a French <i>attach&eacute;</i>, and he indeed entered into the spirit of
the
  thing with a zest and enthusiasm of truly Parisian origin. Surrounded by
  masks, he kept up a fire of witticism, which never failed or diminished for
  an instant; like the juggler who plays with half-a-dozen balls, now one, now
  another, now all up in air at once. The Frenchman seemed to ask no respite,
  to shrink from no emergency; he was little, he was ugly, he was not even
  gentleman-like, but he was "the right man in the right place," and the ladies
  were enchanted with him accordingly. Surrounded by his admirers, he was at a
  sufficient distance for me to watch his proceedings without the risk of
  appearing impertinent, and so I looked on, half amused at his readiness, half
  disgusted with his flippancy, till I found my attention wandering once more
  to my own unprofitable and discontented thoughts.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mouton gui r&ecirc;ve</i>," said a voice at my elbow, so close that
it made
  me start.</p>

  <p>I turned rapidly round, and saw a lady standing so near that her dress
  touched mine, masked, of course, and thoroughly disguised in figure and
  appearance. Had it not been for the handsome arm and the camellia she held to
  her lips, I should not have recognised her as the lady I had spoken to at the
  door of the Opera, and who had appointed to meet me at this very spot&mdash;a
  <i>rendezvous</i> which, truth to tell, I had nearly forgotten.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mouton gui r&ecirc;ve</i>," she repeated, and added, in the same
language,
  "Your dreams must be very pleasant if they can thus abstract you from all
  earthly considerations, even music and dancing, and your duty towards the
  fair sex."</p>

  <p>"Now what <i>can</i> this woman want with me? I wish she would let me
  alone," was my inward thought: but my outward expression thereof was couched
  in more polite language.</p>

  <p>"Dreaming! of course I was dreaming&mdash;and of Madame; so bright a
  vision, that I could hardly hope ever to see it realised. I place myself at
  Madame's feet as the humblest of her slaves."</p>

  <p>She laughed in my face. "Do not attempt compliments," she said, "it is not
  your <i>m&eacute;tier</i>. The only thing I like about you English is your
frankness
  and straight-forward character. Take me upstairs. I want to speak seriously
  to you. Don't look so preoccupied."</p>

  <p>At this instant I recognised Ropsley's scarlet uniform showing to great
  advantage on his tall person in the distance; I could not help glancing
  towards the part of the room in which I knew the pink dress was to be found,
  for the pink dress would of course have entered with Ropsley, and where the
  pink dress was there would be <i>another</i>, whom, after to-night, I had
  resolved <i>never, never</i> to see again.</p>

  <p>My mysterious acquaintance had now hooked herself on to my arm, and as we
  toiled up the stairs it was necessary to say something. I said the first
  thing that occurred to me. "How did you know I was an Englishman?" She
  laughed again.</p>

  <p>"<i>Not</i> by your French," she answered; "for without compliment, you
  speak it as well as I do; but who except an Englishman would go to sleep with
  his eyes open in such a place as this? who else would forget such a
  <i>rendezvous</i> as I gave you here? who else, with a pretty woman on his
  arm (I <i>am</i> a pretty woman, though I don't mean to unmask), would be
  longing to get away, and hankering after a pink dress and a black domino at
  the other end of the room? You needn't wince, my friend; I know all your
  secrets. You were in the seventh heaven when I interrupted you. I wish you
  would come down to earth again."</p>

  <p>I will not say where I wished <i>she</i> would go down to, but I answered
  gravely and politely enough&mdash;"It was not to tell me this you stopped
  your carriage after the opera to-night; tell me how I can serve you&mdash;I
  am at the disposition of Madame, though I am at a loss to discover what she
  means by her pink dresses and black dominoes."</p>

  <p>"I will not laugh at you for being serious," she replied. "I am serious
  myself now, and I shall be for the next ten minutes. Frankly, I know you; I
  know all about you. I know the drawing-room at Edeldorf, and I know
Val&eacute;rie
  de Rohan&mdash;don't look so frightened, your secret is safe with me. Be
  equally frank, Monsieur l'Interpr&egrave;te, and interpret something for me,
under
  promise of secrecy. You are an Englishman," she added, hurriedly, her manner
  changing suddenly to one of earnestness, not unmixed with agitation; "can I
  depend upon you?"</p>

  <p>"Implicitly, Madame," was my reply.</p>

  <p>"Then tell me why Victor de Rohan is constantly at the Htel Munsch with
  his foreign friends; tell me why he is always in attendance on that proud
  young lady, that frigid specimen of an English 'meess'? Is it true, I only
  ask you&mdash;tell me, is it true?"</p>

  <p>Agitated as was the questioner, her words smote home to her listener's
  heart. How blind I had been, living with them every day, and never to see it!
  while here was a comparative stranger, one at least who, by her own account,
  had been absent from Vienna for weeks, and she was mistress of the details of
  our every-day life; she had been watching like a lynx, whilst I was sleeping
  or dreaming at my post; well, it mattered little which, now. The hand that
  held her bouquet was shaking visibly, but her voice was steady and even
  slightly sarcastic as she read her answer in my face, and resumed&mdash;</p>

  <p>"What I have heard, then, is true, and Count de Rohan is indeed an
  enviable man. You need not say another word, Monsieur l'Interpr&egrave;te, I
am
  satisfied. I thank you for your kindness. I thank you for your patience; you
  may kiss my hand;" and she gave it me with the air of a queen. "I am an old
  friend of his and of his family; I shall go and congratulate him; you need
  not accompany me. Adieu! good sleep and pleasant dreams to you."</p>

  <p>I followed her with my eyes as she moved away. I saw her walk up to
  Victor, who had a lady in blue, Constance, of course, upon his arm. She
  passed close by him and whispered in his ear. He started, and I could see
  that he turned deadly pale. For an instant he hesitated as if he would follow
  her, but in a twinkling she was lost amongst the crowd, and I saw her no more
  that night.</p>

  <p>I threaded my way to where Ropsley in his scarlet uniform was conversing
  with a knot of distinguished Austrian officers; they were listening to his
  remarks with attention, and here, as elsewhere, in the ball-room at Vienna as
  in the playground at Everdon, it seemed natural that my old school-fellow
  should take the lead. Sir Harry was by his side occasionally putting in his
  word, somewhat <i>mal-&agrave;-propos</i>, for though a shrewd capable man,
foreign
  politics were a little out of Sir Harry's depth. Behind him stood the
  much-talked-of pink dress; its wearer was closely masked, but I knew the
  flowers she held in her hand, and I thought now was the time to bid
Val&eacute;rie a
  long farewell. She was a little detached from her party, and I do not think
  expected me so soon, for she started when I spoke to her, but bowed in
  acquiescence, and put her arm within mine when I proposed to make the tour of
  the room with her, although, true to the spirit of a masquerade, not a word
  escaped her lips. I led her up to the galleries, and placed a seat for her
  apart from the crowd. I did not quite know how to begin, and contrary to her
  wont, Val&eacute;rie seemed as silently disposed as myself. At last I took
courage,
  and made my plunge.</p>

  <p>"I have asked to speak to you, to wish you good-bye," I said. "I am going
  away to-morrow. For my own sake I must stay here no longer. I am going back
  to the East. I am well now, and anxious to be on service again. I have stayed
  in the Fatherland far too long as it is. To-morrow at daybreak Bold and I
  must be <i>en route</i> for Trieste." I paused; she winced, and drew in her
  breath quickly, but bowed her head without speaking, and I went
  on&mdash;"Mine has been a strange lot, and not a very happy one; and this
  must account to you for my reserved, unsociable conduct, my seeming
  ingratitude to my best and kindest friends. Believe me, I am not ungrateful,
  only unhappy. I might have been, I ought to have been a very different man. I
  shall to-night bid you farewell, perhaps for ever. You are a true friend; you
  have always borne and sympathised with me. I will tell you my history; bear
  and sympathise with me now. I have been a fool and an idolater all my life;
  but I have been at least consistent in my folly, and true in my idolatry.
  From my earliest boyhood there has been but one face on earth to me, and that
  one face will haunt me till I die. Was it my fault, that seeing her every day
  I could not choose but love her? that loving her I would have striven heart
  and soul, life and limb, to win her? And I failed. I failed, though I would
  have poured out my heart's blood at her feet. I failed, and yet I loved her
  fondly, painfully, madly as ever. Why am I an exile from my country&mdash;a
  wanderer on the face of the earth&mdash;a ruined, desperate man? Why, because
  of her. And yet I would not have it otherwise, if I could. It is dearer to me
  to sorrow for her sake, than it could ever have been to be happy with
  another. Val&eacute;rie, God forbid you should ever know what it is to love
as I
  have done. God forbid that the feeling which ought to be the blessing and the
  sunshine of a life should turn to its blight and its curse!
Val&eacute;rie!"</p>

  <p>She was shaking all over; she was weeping convulsively under her mask: I
  could hear her sobs, and yet I was pitiless. I went on. It was such a relief
  in the selfishness of my sorrow, to pour out the pent-up grief of years, to
  tell any one, even that merry, light-hearted girl, how bitterly I had
  suffered&mdash;how hopeless was my lot. It was not that I asked for sympathy,
  it was not that I required pity; but it seemed a necessity of my being, that
  I should establish in the ears of one living witness the fact of my great
  sorrow, ere I carried it away with me, perhaps to my grave. And all this time
  the melody of the "Weintrauben" was pealing on, as if in mockery. Oh, that
  waltz! How often she had played it to me in the drawing-room at Beverley!
  Surely, surely, it must smite that cold heart even now.</p>

  <p>My companion's sobs were less violent, but she grasped the bouquet in her
  hand till every flower drooped and withered with the pressure.</p>

  <p>"Val&eacute;rie," I continued, "do not think me vain or presumptuous. I
speak to
  you as a man who has death looking him in the face. I am resolved never to
  return. I am no braver than my neighbours, but I have nothing on earth to
  live for, and I pray to die. I can speak to you now as I would not dare to
  speak if I thought ever to look in your face again. You have been my
  consoler, my sister, my friend. Oh, I could have dared to love you,
Val&eacute;rie;
  to strive for you, to win you, had I but been free. You are, perhaps, far
  worthier than that proud, unfeeling girl, and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;it
  cannot be. Farewell, Val&eacute;rie, dear Val&eacute;rie; we shall never
meet again. You
  will be happy, and prosperous, and beloved; and you will think sometimes of
  the poor wounded bird whose broken wing you healed, only that it might fly
  away once more into the storm. As for me, I have had no future for years. I
  live only in the past. Bold and I must begin our wanderings again
  to-morrow&mdash;Bold whom she used to fondle, whom I love for her sake. It is
  not every man, Countess Val&eacute;rie, that will sacrifice his all to an
idea, and
  that idea a false one!"</p>

  <p>"Stop, Vere!" she gasped out wildly; "hush, for mercy's sake, hush!"</p>

  <p>Oh! that voice, that voice! was I dreaming? was it possible? was I mad?
  Still the wild tones of the "Weintrauben" swelled and sank upon mine ear;
  still the motley crowd down below were whirling before my sight; and as
  surely as I saw and heard, so surely was it Constance Beverley who laid her
  hand in mine, and tearing down her mask, turned upon me a look so wild, so
  mournful, so unearthly, that, through all my astonishment, all my confusion,
  it chilled me to the heart. Many a day afterwards&mdash;ay, in the very jaws
  of death, that look haunted me still.</p>

  <p>"So true," she muttered; "oh, misery, misery! too late."</p>

  <p>"Forgive me, Miss Beverley," I resumed, bitterly, and with cold
  politeness; "this communication was not intended for you. I meant to bid
  Countess Val&eacute;rie farewell. You have accidentally heard that which I
would
  have died sooner than have told you. It would be affectation to deny it now.
  I shall not annoy you any further. I congratulate you on your many conquests,
  and wish you good-bye."</p>

  <p>She was weeping once more, and wrung my hand convulsively.</p>

  <p>"Vere, Vere," she pleaded, "do not be so hard upon me; so bitter, so
  mocking, so unlike yourself. Spare me, I entreat you, for I am very
  miserable. You do nob know how I am situated. You do not know how I have
  struggled. But I must not talk thus <i>now</i>."</p>

  <p>She recovered her self-command with a strong effort, and pale as death,
  she spoke steadily on.</p>

  <p>"Vere, we may not make our own lot in life; whatever is, is for the best.
  It is too late to think of what might have been. Vere, dear Vere, you are my
  brother&mdash;you never can be more to me than a dear,
  <i>dear</i>brother."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" I gasped, for her words, her voice, her trembling frame, her
  soft, sweet, mournful looks, had raised once more a legion of hopes that I
  thought were buried for ever in my breast; and despite my cruel taunts, I
  loved her, even whilst I smote, as the fierce human heart can love, and tear,
  and rend, and suffer the while, far, far more keenly than its victim.</p>

  <p>"Because I am the promised wife of another. Your friend, Count de Rohan,
  proposed for me this very day, and I accepted him."</p>

  <p>She was standing up as she said it, and she spoke in a steady measured
  voice; but she sat down when she had finished, and tried to put her mask on
  again. Her fingers trembled so that she could not tie the strings.</p>

  <p>I offered her my arm, and we went downstairs. Not a word did we exchange
  till we had nearly reached the place where Sir Harry was still standing
  talking to Victor de Rohan. Ropsley, in his scarlet uniform, was whirling
  away with a lady in a blue dress, whose figure I recognised at once for that
  of the Countess Val&eacute;rie. It was easy to discover that the young
ladies, who
  resembled each other in size and stature, had changed dresses; and the
  Countess, to enhance the deception, had lent her bouquet to her friend. I was
  giddy and confused, like a man with his death-hurt, but pride whispered in my
  ear to bear it in silence and seeming unconcern.</p>

  <p>Three paces more would bring us to Sir Harry. I should never see her
  again. In a short time she might perhaps read my name in the <i>Gazette</i>,
  and then hard, haughty, false as she was, she would like to know that I had
  been true to her to the last. No, I would not part with her in anger; my
  better angel conquered, and I wrung her hand, and whispered, "God bless you,
  Constance." "God bless you, Vere," she replied; and the pressure of those
  soft trembling fingers thrilled on mine for many a day.</p>

  <p>I recollect but little more of that ball in the Redouten-Saal. I believe I
  congratulated Victor on his approaching marriage. I believe I wished
Val&eacute;rie
  good-bye, and was a little disappointed at the resignation with which she
  accepted my departure. I have a vague impression that even Ropsley, usually
  so calm, so selfish, so unsympathising, accompanied me home, under the
  impression that I was ill. My mind had been overstrung, and I walked about
  like a man in a dream. But morning came at last, and with my cased sword
  under my arm, and Bold in a leash at my feet, I stood on the platform of the
  railway-station, waiting for the departure of my train. An English servant,
  in the well-known livery, touched his hat as he put a letter into my hand.
  Miser that I was! I would not read it till I was fairly settled in the
  carriage. Little thought the faded belle, with her false front, opposite me,
  or the fat man, with a seal-ring on his fore-finger, by my side, how that
  scrap of paper was all my wealth on earth; but they were honest Germans, and
  possessed that truest of all politeness, which does as it would be done by.
  No inquisitive regards annoyed me during its perusal; no impertinent sympathy
  remarked on the tears which I am ashamed to say fell thick and fast upon it
  ere it closed. I have it by me now, that yellow well-worn paper. I have read
  those delicate womanly characters by scorching sunlight, by the faint glimmer
  of a picket's lantern, far away on the boundless sea, cramped and close in
  the stifling tent. If indeed "every bullet has its billet," and any one of
  them had been destined to lodge in my bosom, it must have found its way right
  through that fragile shield&mdash;ay, carried in with it the very words which
  were ineffaceably engraven on my heart. No wonder I can remember it all. Here
  it is:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Vere, you must not judge me as men are so prone to judge
  women&mdash;harshly, hastily, uncharitably. We are not all frivolous,
  selfish, and fond of change, caring only for our amusements, our
  <i>conquests</i>, as you call them, and our enmities. You were bitter and
  cruel to me last night. Indeed, indeed, I feel you had a right to be so,
  Vere. I am so, <i>so</i> sorry for you. But you must not think I have treated
  you unkindly, or with want of confidence. Remember how you have avoided me
  ever since we came to Vienna; remember how you have behaved to me as a
  stranger, or at most a mere acquaintance; how you have never once inquired
  about my prospects, or alluded to old times. Perhaps you were right; perhaps
  you felt hurt, proud, and angry; and yet, Vere, I had expected better things
  from <i>you</i>. Had I been in your place I think I could have forgiven, I
  think I could have cared for, sympathised with, and respected one whom I was
  forbidden to love. If I were a man, it seems to me that I should not place
  happiness, however great, as the one sole aim of my existence; that I should
  strive to win honour and distinction, to benefit my fellow-men, and above
  all, to fulfil my duty, even with no higher reward here below than my own
  approval. Vere, when a man feels he is doing right, others think so too. I
  could be proud, oh! so proud, of my brother. Yes, Vere, it is my turn to
  implore now, and I entreat you let me be a sister, a very dear sister to you.
  As such I will tell you all my griefs, all my doings; as such I can confide
  in you, write to you, think of you, pray for you, as indeed I do, Vere, every
  morning and evening of my life. And now let us dismiss at once and for ever
  the thoughts of what might have been. The past is beyond recall&mdash;the
  present, as you used to say, does not exist. The future none can call their
  own. There is but one reality in life, and that is Right. Vere, I have done
  right. I have followed the path of duty. Brother, I call upon you for your
  help along the rough steep way; you have never failed me yet, you will not
  fail me now.</p>

  <p>"You know my mother died when I was very young. Since then my father has
  fulfilled the duties of both parents towards his child. As I have grown older
  and seen more of the world, I have been better able to appreciate his
  affection and devotion to myself. A little girl must have been a sad clog
  upon a man like my dear father, a high-spirited gentleman, fond of the world,
  fond of society, fond of pleasure. Besides, had it not been for me, he would
  have married again, and he preferred to sacrifice his happiness to his child.
  Can I ever repay him? No. Whatever may have been his faults, he has been a
  kind, kind father to me. I will tell you all frankly, Vere, as this is the
  last time the subject can ever be mentioned between us. Had I been free to
  choose, I would have been yours. I am not ashamed&mdash;nay, I am
  <i>proud</i> to own it. But you know how impossible it was, how absolutely my
  father forbade it. To have disobeyed him would have been wicked and
  ungrateful. I feel that even you would not have respected me had I done so.
  But of late he has become most anxious to see me settled in life. From his
  own hints, and Captain Ropsley's open assertions, it seems this alone can
  stave off some dreadful evil. I do not understand it. I only know I am bound
  to do all in my power for papa; and that he is entangled with that bad,
  unprincipled man I feel convinced. Oh, Vere, it might have been far, far
  worse. In accepting Count de Rohan I have escaped a great and frightful
  danger. Besides, I esteem him highly, I like his society, I admire his open,
  honourable character. I have known him all my life; he is your oldest
  friend&mdash;I need not enlarge upon his merits to you. His sister, too, is a
  charming, frank-hearted girl. From all I heard, from all I saw, I had hoped,
  Vere, that she had effaced in your mind the unhappy recollections of former
  days. She is beautiful, accomplished, and attractive; can you wonder that I
  believed what I was told, and judged, besides, by what I saw? Even now we
  might be related. You seem to like her, and she would make any one happy.
  Forgive me, Vere, forgive me for the suggestion. It seems so unfeeling now,
  whilst I have your tones of misery ringing in my ears; and yet, Heaven knows,
  <i>your</i> happiness is the wish nearest my heart. Consult only <i>that</i>,
  and I shall be satisfied. To hear of your welfare, your success, will make me
  happy. I cannot, I must not write to you again. You yourself would not wish
  it. I ought to write no more now. I feel for you, Vere; I know how you must
  suffer, but the steel must be tempered in the fire, and it is through
  suffering that men learn to be great and good. There are other prizes in life
  besides happiness. There is an hour coming for us all, when even the dearest
  and closest will have to part. May we both be ready when that hour arrives.
  And now it is time to bid the long farewell; our paths in life must
  henceforth be separate. Do not think unkindly of me, Vere; I may not be with
  you, but I may be proud of you, and wish you every happiness. Forget
  me&mdash;yet not altogether. Dear, <i>dear</i> brother, God bless you! and
  farewell!</p>

  <p>"Take care of poor Bold."</p>

  <p>So it was really over at last. Well, and what then? Had it not been over,
  to all intents and purposes, long ago? Yes, there was something worth living
  for, after all. There was no bitterness now, for there was nothing to hope;
  the cup had been drained to the dregs, and the very intoxication of the
  draught had passed away, but it had invigorated the system and given new life
  to the heart. It was much to feel that I had been valued and appreciated by
  such a woman&mdash;much to know that my name would never fall unmeaningly on
  her ear. And I would be worthy, I would never fail. The sacrifice should be
  perfected. And though I might never see her again on earth, I would preserve
  her image pure and unsullied in my heart of hearts. Constance Beverley should
  henceforth and for ever be my ideal of all that was purest and noblest and
  best beloved in woman.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch30"
     name="ch30"></a>CHAPTER XXX. &mdash; THE GOLDEN HORN</h2>

  <p class="first">"Johnny, want to see the bazaar?" The speaker was a Greek of
  the lowest class, depraved and dirty, with a flexibility of limb and cunning
  of countenance only to be seen in the present representatives of that race
  who once furnished the sculptor with his glorious ideal of godlike strength
  and intellectual beauty. I longed to kick him&mdash;the climate of
  Constantinople is provocative of irritation, and I felt that with my bushy
  beard, my Oriental demeanour, my acquaintance with Turkish habits and
  proficiency in the language, it was irritating to be called "Johnny," and
  asked to "see the bazaar," as though I had been the smoothest and ruddiest
  ensign, disembarked for a day's leave from yonder crowded troop-ship, an
  innocent lamb frisking in the sun on my way up to the shambles before
  Sebastopol.</p>

  <p>Yes, I was pretty well acclimatised in Turkey now. A year and more had
  passed over my head since I had left Vienna, the morning after that memorable
  ball at the Redouten-Saal, and what changes had that year brought forth! Sir
  Harry Beverley was gathered to his fathers, and an investigation into that
  worthy gentleman's affairs had explained much that was hitherto
  incomprehensible in his conduct as to his daughter's marriage and his
  connection with Ropsley. The latter had played his game scientifically
  throughout. He was aware that on a proper settlement being made, by marriage
  or otherwise, for his daughter, Sir Harry would obtain the fee-simple of
  certain property which, until such an event, he only held in trust for the
  young lady's benefit; and as these were the sole funds to which the
  far-seeing Guardsman could look to liquidate Sir Harry's debts to himself,
  incurred no one knew exactly how, it was his object to expedite as speedily
  as possible the marriage of my early love. As she was an heiress he would
  have had no objection to wed her himself, and indeed, as we have already
  seen, had entered into terms with her father for the furtherance of this
  object. That scheme was, however, defeated by her own determination, and it
  had long been apparent to my mind that Constance had only married my old
  friend Victor to escape from the dreadful alternative of becoming Ropsley's
  wife: that such an alliance promised but ill for the future happiness of both
  I could not conceal from myself, and yet so selfish is the human heart, so
  difficult is it to shake the "trail of the serpent" from off the flowerets of
  our earthly love, I could not regret as I ought to have done that the two
  people whom most I cared for in the world, should not be as devoted to each
  other as is essential to the happiness of those whom the tie of marriage has
  bound indissolubly together.</p>

  <p>Ah! she was Countess de Rohan now, living at Edeldorf in all that state
  and luxury which she was so well calculated to adorn; and I, what had I done
  since we parted for ever at the masquerade? Well, I had striven to fulfil her
  wishes&mdash;to rise to honour and distinction, to be worthy of her
  friendship and esteem. Fame I had gained none, but I had done my duty. Omar
  Pasha, my kind patron, who had never forgotten the child that sympathised
  with him at Edeldorf, had expressed himself satisfied with my services; and
  'Skender Bey, drunk or sober, never passed me without a cordial grasp of the
  hand. For more than a year I had shared the fortunes of the Turkish commander
  and the Turkish army. I had seen the merits of those poor, patient, stanch,
  unflinching troops, and the shortcomings of their corrupt and venal officers.
  I knew, none better, how the Turkish soldier will bear hunger, thirst,
  privation, ill-usage, and arrears of pay without a murmur; how, with his
  implicit faith in destiny, and his noble self-sacrifice in the cause of God
  and the Sultan, he is capable of endurance and effort such as put the ancient
  Spartan to the blush&mdash;witness the wan faces, the spectral forms, gaunt,
  famine-stricken and hollow-eyed, that so doggedly carried out the behests of
  the tameless defender of Kars. I had seen him starved and cheated that his
  colonel might gormandise&mdash;ay! and, in defiance of the Prophet, drink to
  intoxication of the forbidden liquid&mdash;and I wondered not, as none who
  knew the nation need wonder, that Russian gold will work its way to the
  defeat of a Turkish army far more swiftly than all the steel that bristles
  over the thronging columns of the Muscovite. Keep the Pasha's hands clean, or
  make it worth his while to be faithful to his country&mdash;forbid the
  northern eagle from spreading his wing over the Black Sea, and you may trust
  the Turkish soldier that not a Russian regiment ever reaches the gates of
  Constantinople. All this I had seen, and for long I was content to cast in my
  lot with this brave people, struggling against the invader; but my own
  countrymen were in arms scarce two hundred miles off, the siege of Sebastopol
  was dragging wearily on from day to day&mdash;I felt that I would fain be
  under the dear old English flag, would fain strike one blow surrounded by the
  kindly English faces, cheered by the homely English tongues. She was more
  likely to hear of me, too, if I could gain some employment with the English
  army; and this last argument proved to me too painfully what I had vainly
  striven to conceal from myself, how little these long months of trials,
  privations, and excitement had altered the real feelings of my heart. Would
  it be always so? Alas, alas! it was a weary lot!</p>

  <p>"Johnny, want to see the bazaar?" He woke me from my day-dream, but I felt
  more kindly towards him now, more cosmopolitan, more charitable. In such a
  scene as that, how could any man, a unit in such a throng, think only of his
  own individual interests or sufferings?</p>

  <p>Never since the days of the Crusaders&mdash;ay, scarcely even in that
  romantic time, was there seen such a motley assemblage as now crowded the
  wooden bridge that traverses the Golden Horn between bustling, dirty,
  dissonant Pera, and stately, quiet, dignified Stamboul, those two suggestive
  quarters that constitute the Turkish capital. On that bridge might be seen a
  specimen of nearly every nation under the sun&mdash;the English soldier with
  his burly, upright figure, and staid, well-disciplined air; the rakish
  Zouave, with his rollicking gait, and professed libertinism of demeanour,
  foreign to the real character of the man. Jauntily he sways and swaggers
  along, his hands thrust into the pockets of his enormous red petticoat
  trousers, his blonde hair shaved close <i>&agrave; la Khabyle</i>, and his
fair
  complexion burnt red by an African sun long before he came here, "en route,
  voyez-vous," to fill the ditch of the Malakhoff. "Pardon," he observes to a
  tall, stately Persian, fresh from Astracan, whom he jostles unwittingly, for
  a Frenchman is never impolite, save when he really <i>intends</i> insult; the
  fire-worshipper, in his long sad-coloured robes and high-pointed cap,
  wreathes his aquiline nose into an expression of stately
  astonishment&mdash;for a Persian, too, has his notions of good breeding, and
  is extremely punctilious in acting up to them. His picturesque costume,
  however, and dignified bearing, are lost upon the Zouave, for a gilded
  <i>araba</i> is at the moment passing, with its well-guarded freight, and the
  accursed Giaour ogles these flowers of the harem with an impudent pertinacity
  of truly Parisian growth. The beauties, fresh from their bath, attempt, with
  henna-tinted fingers, to draw their thin veils higher over their radiant
  features, their bed-gown-looking dresses tighter round their plump forms; an
  arrangement which by some fatality invariably discloses the beauties of face
  and figure more liberally than before. Here a Jew, in his black dress and
  solemn turban, is counting his gains attentively on his fingers; there an
  Armenian priest, with square cap and long dusky draperies, tells his prayers
  upon his sandal-wood beads. A mad dervish, naked to the loins, his hair
  knotted in elf-locks, his limbs macerated by starvation, howls out his
  unearthly dirge, to which nobody seems to pay attention, save that Yankee
  skipper in a round hat, fresh from Halifax to Balaklava, who is much
  astonished, if he would only confess it, and who sets down in his mental
  log-book all that he sees and hears in this strange country as an "almighty
  start." Italian sailors, speaking as much with their fingers as their
  tongues, call perpetually on the Virgin; whilst Greeks, Maltese, and Ionian
  Islanders scream and gesticulate, and jabber and cheat whenever and however
  they can. Yonder an Arab from the desert stalks grim and haughty, as though
  he trod the burning sands of his free, boundless home. Armed to the teeth,
  the costly shawl around his waist bristling with pistols and sword and deadly
  yataghan, he looks every inch the tameless war-hawk whose hand is against
  every man, and every man's hand against him. Preoccupied as he is, though,
  and ill at ease, for he has left his steed in a stable from whence he feels
  no certainty that priceless animal may not be stolen ere he returns; and
  should he lose his horse, what will his very life avail him then?
  Nevertheless he can sneer bitterly on that gigantic Ethiopian&mdash;a slave,
  of course&mdash;who struts past him in all the borrowed importance of a great
  man's favourite. At Constantinople, as at New Orleans,&mdash;in the City of
  the Sultan as in the Land of the Free&mdash;the swarthy skin, the flattened
  features, and the woolly hair of the negro denote the slave. That is a tall,
  stalwart fellow, though, and would fetch his price in South Carolina fast
  enough, were he put up for sale to the highest bidder. Such a lot he need not
  dread here, and he leads some half-dozen of his comrades, like himself,
  splendidly dressed and armed, with a confident, not to say bellicose air,
  that seems to threaten all bystanders with annihilation if they do not
  speedily make way for his master the Pasha. And now the Pasha himself comes
  swinging by at the fast easy walk of his magnificent Turkish charger, not
  many crosses removed from the pure blood of the desert. The animal seems
  proud of its costly accoutrements, its head-stall embossed with gold, and
  housings sown with pearls, nor seems inclined to flag or waver under the
  goodly weight it carries so jauntily. A gentleman of substantial proportions
  is the Pasha; broad, strong, and corpulent, with the quiet, contented air of
  one whose habitual life is spent amongst subordinates and inferiors. He is a
  true Turk, and it is easy to trace in his gestures and
  demeanour&mdash;haughty, grave and courteous&mdash;the bearing of the
  dominant race. His stout person is buttoned into a tight blue frock-coat, on
  the breast of which glitters the diamond order of the Medjidjie, and a fez or
  crimson skull-cap, with a brass button in the crown, surmounts his broad,
  placid face, clean and close shaved, all but the carefully trimmed black
  moustache. A plain scimitar hangs at his side, and the long chibouques, with
  their costly amber mouthpieces, are carried by the pipe-bearer in his rear.
  The cripple asking for alms at his horse's feet narrowly escapes being
  crushed beneath its hoofs; but in Turkey nobody takes any trouble about
  anybody else, and the danger being past, the cripple seems well satisfied to
  lie basking in the sun on those warm boards, and wait for his destiny like a
  true Mussulman as he is. Loud are the outcries of this Babel-like throng; and
  the porters of Galata stagger by under enormous loads, shouting the while
  with stentorian lungs, well adapted to their Herculean frames. Water-carriers
  and sweetmeat-venders vie with each other in proclaiming the nature of their
  business in discordant tones; a line of donkeys, bearing on their patient
  backs long planks swaying to and fro, are violently addressed by their
  half-naked drivers in language of which the poetic force is equalled only by
  the energetic enunciation; and a string of Turkish firemen, holloaing as if
  for their lives, are hurrying&mdash;if an Osmanli can ever be said to
  hurry&mdash;to extinguish one of those conflagrations which periodically
  depopulate Pera and Stamboul.</p>

  <p>The blue sparkling water, too, is alive with traffic, and is indeed
  anything but a "silent highway." Graceful ca ques, rowed by their
  lightly-clad watermen&mdash;by far the most picturesque of all the dwellers
  by the Bosphorus&mdash;shoot out in all directions from behind vessels of
  every rig and every tonnage; the boatmen screaming, of course, on every
  occasion, at the very top of their voices. All is bustle, confusion, and
  noise; but the tall black cedars in the gardens of the Seraglio-palace tower,
  solemn and immovable, into the blue cloudless sky, for there is not a breath
  of air stirring to fan the scorching noon, and the domes and minarets of
  Stamboul's countless mosques glitter white and dazzling in the glare. It is
  refreshing to watch the ripple yonder on the radiant Bosphorus, where the
  breeze sighs gently up from the sea of Marmora&mdash;alas! we have not a
  chance of it elsewhere; and it is curious to observe the restless white
  sea-fowl, whom the Turks believe to be the lost souls of the wicked, scouring
  ever along the surface of the waters, seemingly without stay or intermission,
  during the livelong day. It is ominous, too; mark that enormous vulture
  poised aloft on his broad wing, like a shadow of evil impending over the
  devoted city. There are few places in the world so characteristic as the
  bridge between Galata[#] and Stamboul.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[#] The suburb of Pera lying next the Bosphorus, a
  locality combining the peculiarities of our own Smithfield, St. Giles's, and
  Billingsgate in their worst days. There is another bridge across the Golden
  Horn, higher up; but its traffic, compared to that of its neighbour, is as
  that of Waterloo to London Bridge.</p>

  <p>And now the traffic is brought to a stand-still, for the huge fabric has
  to be opened, and swings back on its hinges for the passage of some mighty
  craft moving slowly on to the inner harbour to refit. It is a work of time
  and labour: the former article is of considerably less value to our Moslem
  friends than the latter, and is lavished accordingly; but though business may
  be suspended for the nonce, noise increases tenfold, every item of the throng
  deeming the present an opportune moment at which to deliver his, her, or its
  opinion on things in general. Nimble fingers roll the fragrant cigarette, and
  dissonant voices rise above the white spiral smoke into the clear bright air.
  Close behind me I recognise the well-known Saxon expletive adjuring
  <i>Johnny</i> to "drive on,"&mdash;said "Johnny" invariably returning a
  blessing for a curse, but "driving on," if by that expression is meant
  activity and progress, as little as may be. Turning round, I confront a
  florid Saxon face, with bushy beard and whiskers, surmounting a square form
  that somehow I think I have seen before. "Scant greeting serves in time of
  strife," and taking my chance of a mistake, I salute my neighbour
  politely.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Manners, I believe? I am afraid you do not recollect me."</p>

  <p>"<i>Major</i> Manners, sir; <i>Major</i> Manners&mdash;very much at your
  service," is the reply, in a tone of mild correction. "No; I confess you have
  the advantage of me. And yet&mdash;can it be? Yes, it is&mdash;Vere
  Egerton!"</p>

  <p>"The same," I answered, with a cordial grasp of the hand; "but it is
  strange we should meet here, of all places in the world."</p>

  <p>"I always told you I was born to be a soldier, Egerton," said the usher,
  with his former jaunty air of good-humoured bravado; "and here I am amongst
  the rest of you. Bless me, how you're grown! I should not have known you had
  you not spoken to me. And I&mdash;don't you think I am altered, eh? improved
  perhaps, but certainly altered&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>I glanced over my friend's dress, and agreed with him most cordially as to
  the <i>alteration</i> that had taken place in his appearance. The eye gets so
  accustomed to difference of costume at Constantinople, that it is hardly
  attracted by any eccentricity of habit, however uncommon; but when my
  attention was called by Manners himself to his exterior, I could not but
  confess that he was apparelled in a style of gorgeous magnificence, such as I
  had never seen before. High black riding-boots of illustrious polish, with
  heavy steel spurs that would have become Prince Rupert; crimson pantaloons
  under a bright green tunic, single-breasted, and with a collar <i>&agrave; la
  guillotine</i>, that showed off to great advantage the manly neck and huge
  bushy beard, but at the same time suggested uncomfortable ideas of sore
  throats and gashing sabre-strokes; a sash of golden tissue, and a sword-belt,
  new and richly embroidered, sustaining a cavalry sabre nearly four feet
  long,&mdash;all this was more provocative of admiration than envy; but when
  such a <i>tout ensemble</i> was surmounted by a white beaver helmet with a
  red plume, something of a compromise between the head-dress of the champion
  at Astley's and that which is much affected by the Prince Consort, the
  general effect, I am bound to confess, became striking in the extreme.</p>

  <p>"I see," said I; "I admire you very much; but what is it?&mdash;the
  uniform, I mean. Staff corps? Land Transport? What?"</p>

  <p>"Land Transport, indeed!" replied Manners, indignantly. "Not a bit of
  it&mdash;nothing half so low. The Bashi-Bazouks&mdash;Beatson's
  Horse&mdash;whatever you like to call them. Capital service&mdash;excellent
  pay&mdash;the officers a jovial set of fellows; and really&mdash;eh now?
  confess, a magnificent uniform. Come and join us, Egerton&mdash;we have lots
  of vacancies; it's the best thing out."</p>

  <p>"And your men?" I asked, for I had heard of these Bashi-Bazouks and their
  dashing leader. "What sort of soldiers are they?&mdash;can you depend upon
  them?"</p>

  <p>"I'd lead them anywhere," replied my enthusiastic friend, whose experience
  of warfare was as yet purely theoretical. "The finest fellows you ever saw;
  full of confidence in their officers, and such horsemen! Talk of your English
  dragoons! why, <i>our</i> fellows will ride up to a brick wall at a gallop,
  and pull up dead short; pick a glove off the ground from the saddle, or put a
  bullet in it when going by as hard as they can lay legs to the ground. You
  should really see them under arms. <i>My opinion is</i>, they are the finest
  cavalry in the world."</p>

  <p>"And their discipline?" I continued, knowing as I did something of these
  wild Asiatics and their predatory and irregular habits.</p>

  <p>"Oh, discipline!" answered my embryo warrior; "bother the discipline! we
  mustn't begin by giving them too much of that; besides, it's nonsense to
  drill those fellows, it would only spoil their <i>dash</i>. They behave very
  well in camp. I have been with them now six weeks, and we have only had one
  row yet."</p>

  <p>"And was that serious?" I asked, anxious to obtain the benefit of such
  long experience as my friend's.</p>

  <p>"Serious"&mdash;replied Manners, thoughtfully; "well, it was serious;
  pistols kept popping off, and I thought at one time things were beginning to
  look very ugly, but the chief soon put them to rights. They positively adore
  him. I don't know whether he punished the ringleaders. However," added he,
  brightening up, "you must expect these sort of things with Irregulars. It was
  the first time I ever was shot at, Egerton; it's not half so bad as I
  expected: we are all dying to get into the field. Hollo! they have shut the
  bridge again, and I must be getting on. Which way are you going?&mdash;to the
  Seraskerat? Come and dine with me to-day at Messirie's&mdash;Salaam!"</p>

  <p>And Manners strutted off, apparently on the best of terms with himself,
  his uniform, and his Bashi-Bazouks. Well! he, too, had embarked on the stormy
  career of war. It was wonderful how men turned up at Constantinople, on their
  way to or from the Front. It seemed as if society in general had determined
  on making an expedition to the East. Dandies from St. James's-street were
  amusing themselves by amateur soldiering before Sebastopol, and London fine
  ladies were to be seen mincing about on the rugged stones of Pera, talking
  bad French to the astonished Turks with a confidence that was truly touching.
  It was Europe invading Asia once more, and I could not always think Europe
  showed to advantage in the contrast. A native Turk, calm, dignified, kindly,
  and polite, is a nobler specimen of the human race than a bustling French
  barber or a greedy German Jew; and of the two latter classes Pera was
  unfortunately full even to overflowing. Well, it was refreshing to have
  crossed the bridge at last&mdash;to have left behind one the miserable
  attempt at Europeanism, the dirt, the turmoil, and the discomfort of Pera,
  for the quiet calm, the stately seclusion, and the venerable magnificence of
  Stamboul.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch31"
     name="ch31"></a>CHAPTER XXXI. &mdash; THE SERASKER T</h2>

  <p class="first">True believers were thronging in and out of the great mosque
  of St. Sophia, pious in the consciousness of their many prostrations,
  rigorous in their observance of the hour of prayer. A <i>mollah</i> was
  shouting from one of the minarets, calling north, south, east, and west on
  all the faithful servants of the Prophet to offer up their daily orisons; and
  the infidel, as we term him, responded zealously to the call. Business was
  drowsily nodding in the bazaar; and the tradesman, sitting cross-legged on
  his counter, pointed feebly with his pipe towards the rich wares which his
  customer seemed barely to have energy to select. Slipshod Turkish ladies,
  accompanied by their negro damsels, were tripping slowly home from the bath,
  peeping at the Giaour through the thin folds of their <i>yashmaks</i> with
  curiosity not untempered by scorn. Pot-bellied children, pashas in miniature,
  holding up their garments with one hand, whilst they extended the henna-dyed
  fingers of the other, waddled after the stranger, now spitting at him with
  precocious fanaticism, now screaming out something about "Bono Johnny" and
  "Para," in unseemly cupidity for an alms. Dogs, gorged and sleepy, the
  recognised scavengers of the streets, lay coiled up in each shady corner and
  recess. Everything betokened somnolence and repose. The very sentry at the
  gate of the Seraskerat had laid his musket carefully aside, and was himself
  leaning against the wall in an attitude of helpless resignation and
  imbecility. My Turkish uniform, and his knowledge of my person as attached to
  the staff of Omar Pasha, served somewhat to arouse him; but ere he was fairly
  under arms I was already in the inner court of the Seraskerat, and beyond
  reach of his challenge or salute. What a contrast did it present to our own
  Horse-Guards, to which office it is a corresponding institution!
  Notwithstanding our boasted superiority, notwithstanding the proverbial
  supineness and indolence of the Sultan's officials, the comparison was hardly
  in favour of our London head-quarters for the hindrance of military affairs.
  Here was no helpless messenger, whose business it seems to be to <i>know
  nothing</i>, and who, answering every question with the unfailing "I will go
  and inquire," disappears and is seen no more. Here was no supercilious clerk,
  whose duty would appear to enjoin concealment of all he <i>does</i> know, and
  an imperative necessity of throwing difficulties in everybody's way. Here was
  no lingering for hours in an ante-room, to obtain a five minutes' interview
  of authoritative disapprobation on the one hand, and submissive
  disappointment on the other. On the contrary, at the foot of the stairs
  leading to the Seraskier's apartments were collected a posse of bustling,
  smart attendants, all alive and willing to assist in whatever was going on.
  Foreign officers, chiefly Hungarians, passed to and fro in eager conclave or
  thoughtful meditation. Interpreters were on the alert to solve a difficulty,
  and well-bred, active horses stood saddled and bridled, ready to start at a
  moment's notice with an order or a despatch. A knavish dragoman was jabbering
  bad Italian to a Jewish-looking individual, who I concluded must be a
  contractor; and a tall colonel of Turkish cavalry rolling a cigarette in his
  brown, well-shaped fingers, stood looking on in dignified indifference, as if
  he understood every word of their conversation, but considered it
  immeasurably beneath his haughty notice.</p>

  <p>I sent up my name by a slim-waisted young officer, a Turk of the modern
  school, with long hair and varnished boots, over which, however, he was
  forced to wear indiarubber goloshes, that on going into the presence of a
  superior he might pay the indispensable compliment of uncovering his feet;
  and almost ere I had followed him three steps upstairs he had returned, and
  informing me that I was expected, held aside the curtain, under which I
  passed into the presence of the Seraskier.</p>

  <p>Again, how unlike the Horse-Guards! the room, though somewhat bare of
  furniture, was gorgeously papered, painted, and decorated, in the florid
  style of French art; a cut-glass chandelier hung from the centre of the
  ceiling, and richly-framed mirrors adorned the walls. From the windows the
  eye travelled over the glorious Bosphorus, with its myriads of shipping, to
  the Asiatic shore, where beautiful Scutari, with its background of hills and
  cypresses, smiled down upon the waters now gleaming like a sheet of burnished
  gold. A low divan, covered with velvet cushions and costly shawls, stretched
  round three sides of the apartment, and on this divan were seated in solemn
  conclave the greatest general of the day and the Seraskier or
  Commander-in-Chief of the Turkish army.</p>

  <p>Some knotty point must have been under discussion before I entered, for
  Omar Pasha's brow was perplexed and clouded, and a dead silence, interrupted
  only by the bubble of the Seraskier's <i>narghileh</i>, reigned between the
  two. The latter motioned me courteously to seat myself by the side of my
  chief; an attendant brought me a spoonful of sweetmeat, a tiny cup of strong,
  thick coffee, and an amber-tipped chibouque adorned with priceless diamonds,
  and filled with tobacco such as the houris will offer to the true believer in
  Paradise. I knew my assistance would soon be required; for although Omar
  Pasha is a good Turkish scholar, few men save those to whom it is almost a
  mother-tongue can converse fluently for any length of time with a Turk in his
  own language: so I smoked in silence and waited patiently till I was
  wanted.</p>

  <p>True to the custom of the country, Omar Pasha resumed the conversation in
  an indifferent tone, by a polite inquiry after his Excellency's health,
  "which must have suffered from his exertions in business during the late
  heats."</p>

  <p>To this his Excellency replied, "that he had been bled, and derived great
  benefit from it; but that the sight of his Highness, Omar Pasha, had done him
  more good than all the prescriptions of the <i>Hakim</i>."</p>

  <p>A long silence, broken only as before; Omar Pasha, who does not smoke,
  waxing impatient, but keeping it down manfully.</p>

  <p>The Seraskier at length remarked, without fear of contradiction, that "his
  Highness was exceedingly welcome at Constantinople," and that "God is
  great."</p>

  <p>Such self-evident truths scarcely furnished an opening for further
  comment, but Omar Pasha saw his opportunity, and took advantage of it.</p>

  <p>"Tell the Seraskier," said he to me, as being a more formal manner of
  acknowledging his courtesy, "that his welcome is like rain on a parched soil;
  that Constantinople is the paradise of the earth, but the soldier ought not
  to leave his post, and I must return to the army, taking with me those
  supplies and arrears of pay of which I stand in need."</p>

  <p>All this I propounded in the florid hyperbole of the East.</p>

  <p>"Assuredly," answered the Seraskier, a stout, sedate, handsome personage,
  who looked as if nothing could ruffle or discompose him, and was therefore
  the very man for the place,&mdash;"Assuredly, the beard of his Highness
  overflows with wisdom; there is but one God."</p>

  <p>This was undeniable, but hardly conclusive; Omar Pasha came again to the
  attack.</p>

  <p>"I have made a statement of my wants, and the supplies of arms,
  ammunition, and money, that I require. The army is brave, patient, and
  faithful; they are the children of the Sultan, and they look to their father
  to be fed and clothed. That statement has been forwarded to your Excellency
  through the proper channels. When the children ask for bread and powder to
  fight the accursed 'Moscov,' what is their general to reply?"</p>

  <p>"Bakaloum" (we shall see), answered the Seraskier, perfectly unmoved. "If
  your Highness's statement has been duly forwarded, doubtless it has reached
  our father the Sultan, with the blessing of God. Our father is all-powerful;
  may he live for a thousand years."</p>

  <p>Omar Pasha began to lose patience.</p>

  <p>"But have you not seen and read it yourself?" he exclaimed, with rising
  colour; "do you not acknowledge the details? do you not know the urgency of
  our wants? have you not taken measures for supplying them?"</p>

  <p>The Seraskier was driven into a corner, but his <i>sang-froid</i> did not
  desert him for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I have seen the statement," said he, "and it was cleverly and fairly
  drawn up. The war is a great war, and it has great requirements. By the
  blessing of God, the armies of the faithful will raze the walls of
  Sebastopol, and drive the 'Moscov' into the sea. Kismet&mdash;it is destiny,
  praise be to Allah!"</p>

  <p>"Before I set foot on board ship, before I leave the quay at Tophana, I
  must have those supplies shipped and ready to sail," urged Omar Pasha, now
  thoroughly roused, and showing his European energy in strong contrast to the
  Oriental apathy of the other; "I cannot proceed without them, I must have
  them by the end of the month. Orders must be sent out to-night&mdash;will you
  promise me this?"</p>

  <p>"Bakaloum" (we shall see), replied the Seraskier, and after a few
  unmeaning compliments the audience ended, and I accompanied my chief
  downstairs into the courtyard of the Seraskerat.</p>

  <p>"And this, my dear Egerton," said he, as he mounted his horse to proceed
  to his own quarters, "is one of the many difficulties with which I have to
  contend. Nobody knows anything&mdash;nobody cares for anything&mdash;nobody
  <i>does</i> anything. If we had but a Government, if we were not paralysed,
  why, with such an army as mine I could have done much. As it is, we are worse
  than useless. If the men have no shoes, no powder, no bread, and I apply to
  the authorities, as I have done to-day, it is 'Bakaloum'" (we shall see). "We
  shall indeed see some fine morning when the troops have all deserted, or are
  starved to death in their tents. Every official, high and low, seems only to
  look out for himself; what is there for us but to follow the example? And yet
  what chances lost! what an army thrown away!"</p>

  <p>"But the Allies will soon take the place," I remarked, wishing to look on
  the bright side of things if possible, "and then our plan of a campaign is
  feasible enough. We shall sweep the whole of the Crimea, and strike him such
  a blow in Asia as will cripple our old friend the 'Rusky' for many a long
  day."</p>

  <p>Omar smiled and shook his head. "Too many masters, friend Egerton," he
  replied; "too many masters. The strings are pulled in Paris, and
  London&mdash;ay, and in Vienna too. Diplomatists who do not know their own
  business are brought forward to teach us ours, and what is a general to do?
  There should be but one head to two hands. Here we have it all the other way.
  No, no, it is all 'Bakaloum' together, and we must make the best of it! I
  will send for you to-morrow if I want you."</p>

  <p>As he rode away in his long dark overcoat and crimson fez, I looked after
  his manly, nervous figure, and thought to myself what a commander would that
  have been in any other service in the world. Had he but chanced to be born a
  Pole instead of a Croat, would the Danube still form a line of demarcation
  between the eagle and its prey? Would the Sultan be even now basking in
  beauty and revelling in champagne amongst the enervating delights of the
  Seraglio gardens? Would the balance of power in Europe be still held in
  equipoise? and the red flag, with its star and crescent, still flaunt over
  the thronging masts of the Golden Horn?</p>

  <p>Several of my old acquaintances crowded round me ere I left the courtyard
  of the Seraskerat, welcoming me back to Constantinople, and eager to learn
  all the thrilling news of the day; every man believing every other to be
  better informed than himself as to all that was going on in front. I could
  gratify them but little, as my duty had now for some considerable period
  removed me from the scene of active operations. Truth to tell, I longed
  ardently to be in the field once more.</p>

  <p>Amongst others, my old comrade, Ali Mesrour, the Beloochee, touched me on
  the shoulder, and greeted me with the heartfelt cordiality that no Asiatic
  ever assumes save with a fast and well-tried friend. The last time I had seen
  him he was engaged with some half-dozen Cossacks on the heights above Baidar,
  in the most romantic portion of the Crimea. He had kept them gallantly at
  lance's length for more than ten minutes, and made his escape after all,
  wounded in two places, and leaving three of his enemies dismounted on the
  field. Then he was ragged, jaded, dirty, and half-starved, for we were all on
  short rations about that time; now I should hardly have recognised him,
  sleek, handsome, and debonair, dressed, moreover, with unparalleled
  magnificence, and carrying, as is the custom of these warriors, all his
  worldly wealth in the jewelled hilt of his dagger, the mounting of his
  pistols, and the costly shawls that protected his head and wound about his
  middle. He seized my right hand, and pressed it to his heart, his eyes, and
  his forehead; then poured forth a volume of welcomes in the picturesque
  language of the East.</p>

  <p>Could I do less than ask after the welfare of Zuleika, the gallant animal
  to whom I owed liberty and life?</p>

  <p>"Allah has preserved her," replied the Beloochee, "and she is now in a
  stable not far from this spot. Her skin is sleek and fair; she is still my
  soul, and the corner of my heart."</p>

  <p>"May she live a thousand years," was my comment; "to her and her master I
  am indebted for being here now. She is one of the best friends I ever
  had."</p>

  <p>The Beloochee's eyes sparkled at the recollection.</p>

  <p>"It was a favourable night," he answered, "and destiny was on our side.
  The dog of a Cossack! What filth I made him devour! How he rolled in the
  dust, and gasped at the kisses of my sharp knife! The Effendi rode in pain
  and weakness, but Allah strengthened him. The Effendi can walk now as well as
  when he left his mother's side."</p>

  <p>We were strolling together down one of the shady narrow streets that lead
  to the water's edge, for I was on my return to Pera, and the Beloochee, in
  his delight at meeting his old comrade, would not suffer me to proceed alone.
  It was about five o'clock in the afternoon, and the scorching heat which had
  reigned all day was at last tempered with the breeze from the Black Sea. Oh!
  blessings on that breeze from the north! Without it how could we have endured
  the stifling atmosphere of Roumelia in the dog-days? By one of those
  wonderful arrangements of nature, which, after all (being accounted for on
  natural principles), would be far more wonderful were they not so, this
  welcome air began to blow every day at the same hour. I used to look for it
  as for the coming of a friend. If he was not with me at half-past three, he
  was sure not to be later than five-and-twenty minutes to four; and when he
  did come, I received him with bare brow and open arms. Ere we reached the
  bridge, the climate, from being well-nigh unbearable had become delightful,
  and all the inhabitants of Constantinople seemed to have turned out to drink
  in new life at every pore, and enjoy the unspeakable refreshment of a lowered
  temperature, till the dews should fall and the sun go down.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch32"
     name="ch32"></a>CHAPTER XXXII. &mdash; A TURK'S HAREM</h2>

  <p class="first">As we neared the water's edge, my companion started and
  turned perfectly livid, as if labouring under some fearfully strong emotion.
  True to his self-command, however, he allowed no other outward sign to betray
  his feelings. In front of us walked a Turkish lady, closely veiled, of
  course, and accompanied by a female negro slave. Following the Beloochee's
  gaze, I observed by the lady's dress and demeanour that she was of high rank,
  and in all probability the property of some great man, a Pasha at least. At
  that time a black attendant argued no inferiority on the part of the mistress
  as it does now. It is only since the peace of '56 that the negro woman has
  been at such a discount in Stamboul as to fill every corner of the streets
  with her lamentations, looking in vain for a purchaser, a master, and a
  home.</p>

  <p>The cause of this sudden fall in the value of a strong, serviceable
  article, which had hitherto commanded a fair and remunerative price, is to be
  found as usual in the enterprise of speculators, and the luxurious tendencies
  of an unfeeling public. The far-seeing slave-dealers who provide the Turkish
  market with Circassian wares had no difficulty in foretelling that the Treaty
  of Paris would abandon to their fate those gallant mountaineers of the
  Caucasus who have so long and so manfully struggled for independence from the
  Russian yoke, and that soon they must bid an eternal farewell to their
  lucrative traffic in Circassian beauty, and their judicious supply of wives
  for the Pashas of Constantinople. Accordingly, ere the treaty came into
  operation, and the Government of the Czar was authorised to forbid the export
  of its new subjects, they proceeded to buy up, far and near, every eligible
  young lady of Circassian origin, and forward her as speedily as possible to
  the Emporium of Matrimony at Constantinople. Nor was this so hard a lot for
  these mountain-daisies as it may at first sight appear. They are taught to
  look upon the slave-market of the Turkish capital as the arena in which they
  are to contend for the prizes of life&mdash;namely, comfortable quarters,
  luxurious baths, a house full of slaves, and a rich master. To be deprived of
  her season at Stamboul is a bitter disappointment to a Circassian belle. We
  in England cannot understand this. Our fair Anglo-Saxons broil in London
  through the dog-days simply and entirely for the exquisite delights of its
  amusements and its society. Who ever heard of an English girl going to a ball
  with any ulterior view but that of dancing? Who ever detected her paying her
  modest court to an elderly Pasha (of the Upper House) for the sake of having
  jewels and amber, and gilded arabas and slaves, at her disposal? Who ever
  knew a blooming rose of June, that would have made the treasure of his life
  to Lazarus, and changed his gloomy dwelling to a bower of Paradise,
  transplanted by her own desire to the hothouses of Dives, there to queen it
  for a day among all his plants and exotics, and then pine neglected and
  withering away? No, no, we know nothing of such doings, but the trade
  flourishes handsomely in the East, and consequently the spring and summer of
  '56 saw Constantinople literally <i>smothered</i> in beauty. I use the word
  advisedly, for an Oriental enslaver, in the language of Burns, is "a lass who
  has acres of charms," and a Pasha purchases his wife as he does his mutton,
  by the pound. Now, demand and supply, like action and reaction, are "equal
  and contrary," nor is woman more than any other marketable commodity exempt
  from the immutable law; so when this invasion of beauty came pouring into
  Constantinople, the value even of a Circassian decreased steadily in an
  alarming ratio, till a damsel that, in the golden days of gallantry, would
  have fetched a hundred and fifty pounds sterling, was now to be bought
  "warranted" for five! Mark the sequel. Luxury crept in amongst the lower
  classes. The poor Turkish artisan, ambitioning a Circassian bride, sold his
  tools, his all&mdash;nay, his faithful black wives&mdash;to purchase the
  unheard-of blessing. The poor negro women were turned adrift into the
  streets. Who was to bid for them? During the worst period of the panic, black
  women were selling in Constantinople at a shilling a dozen!</p>

  <p>The Beloochee griped my arm hard. "It is Zuleika!" he whispered between
  his set teeth. "She has not seen me&mdash;she does not know I am here.
  Perhaps she has forgotten me!"</p>

  <p>"Let us follow her," said I, for in truth I sympathised with poor Ali, and
  my English blood boiled at the manner in which he had been deprived of his
  bride.</p>

  <p>The Beloochee loosened his dagger in its sheath, and drew the folds of his
  shawl tighter round his waist. "Effendi," said he, "you are a true
  comrade&mdash;Bismillah! the end is yet to come."</p>

  <p>The lady and her attendant walked provokingly slow, looking at every
  object of curiosity on their way, and making it exceedingly difficult for us
  to adapt our pace to theirs without exciting observation in the passers-by.
  At length they reached the waterside, and summoning a ca que, pushed out into
  the Bosphorus. We were speedily embarked in another, and following in their
  wake, our ca gee, or boatman, at once penetrating our intentions, and
  entering into the spirit of the thing with all the fondness for mischief and
  intrigue so characteristic of his class. As we glided along over the rippling
  waters we had ample time to dispose our plans, the object of which was to
  give the Beloochee an opportunity of communicating with his lost love, to
  learn, and, if possible, to rescue her from her fate. "Keep close to that ca
  que," said I to our sympathising waterman, "and when we are secure from
  observation go up alongside." The rascal showed all his white teeth, as he
  grinned intelligence and approval.</p>

  <p>So we glided down the beautiful Bosphorus, past marble palaces and
  glittering kiosks, till we came under the very walls of a building, more
  magnificent than any we had yet passed, with a wide frontage towards the
  water, supported on shafts as of smoothest alabaster, the closed lattices of
  which, with its air of carefully-guarded seclusion, denoted the harem of some
  great dignitary of the empire, who was in the habit of retiring hither to
  solace himself after the labours of government and the cares of state.
  Through a gate of iron trellis-work, beautifully designed and wrought, we
  caught a glimpse of a lovely garden, rich in gorgeous hues, and sparkling
  with fountains murmuring soothingly on the ear, whilst from the lofty doors,
  securely clamped and barred, wide steps of marble reached down to the water's
  edge, lipped and polished by the lazy ripple of the waves.</p>

  <p>Here we brought our bark alongside the object of our chase, but we had
  reckoned without our host in counting on the imperturbability of a lady's
  nerves, for no sooner had the Beloochee turned his face towards Zuleika, and
  whispered a few short syllables straight from his heart, than with a loud
  shriek she tossed her hands wildly above her head, and fainted dead away in
  the bottom of the ca que.</p>

  <p>At that instant the boat's nose touched the lower step of the palace, and
  the negro woman, almost as helpless as her mistress, began screaming loudly
  for assistance, whilst a guard of blacks opening the huge double doors came
  swarming down to the water's edge, scowling ominously at the Beloochee and
  myself, who with our mischievous boatman had now shoved off and remained at
  some distance from the shore.</p>

  <p>There was but one thing to be done, and that quickly. "<i>Hakim!</i>" I
  shouted to the blacks, who were bearing the lifeless form of the girl up the
  palace steps; "I am a doctor, do you want my assistance?" and at the same
  time I handed my pencil-case and the back of a letter to my comrade. Alas! he
  could not write, but in a hurried whisper entreated me, if possible, to
  communicate with Zuleika, and bear her the message which he confided to me
  from his old and faithful love.</p>

  <p>By dint of threats and a kick or two, I prevailed on my friend the ca gee,
  who began to think the fun was getting too hot for him, to pull ashore; and
  boldly mounting the steps, I informed the chief of the harem-guard
  authoritatively that I was a physician, and that if the Khanum's (lady's)
  life was to be saved, not a moment must be lost. She was evidently a
  favourite wife of her lord, for her fainting-fit seemed to have caused much
  commotion in the household, and during his absence the major-domo of the
  harem took upon himself, not without many misgivings and much hesitation, to
  admit me, a Giaour and a <i>man</i>, within the sacred and forbidden
  precincts.</p>

  <p>The Turks have a superstitious reverence for the science of medicine,
  which they believe, and not without reason, to be practised by the Franks
  more successfully than by themselves. To my adoption of the character of a
  <i>Hakim</i> I owed my present immunity and my entrance into that sanctum of
  a Turk's house, which it is considered indecorous even to <i>mention</i> in
  conversation with its master.</p>

  <p>I do not lay claim to more courage than my neighbours, and I confess it
  was with a beating heart that I followed the helpless form of Zuleika borne
  by her swarthy attendants up the palace steps, through the massive doors
  which swung and closed behind me, as if to shut out all chance of escape, to
  find myself at the top of a handsome staircase, on the very threshold of the
  women's apartment. What confusion my entrance created! Shrieks and jeers and
  stifled laughter resounded on all sides, whilst black eyes flashed inquiring
  glances at the Frankish doctor, veiled, indeed, but scarcely dimmed by the
  transparent folds of the <i>yashmak</i>, and loosely-clad forms, in all the
  colours of the rainbow, flitted hither and thither, with more demonstration
  of activity than the occasion seemed to warrant.</p>

  <p>I had heard much of the discipline of these caged birds, and pictured to
  myself, with sympathising pity, their isolated condition, cut off from
  friends and relatives, weighed down by all the fetters of wedlock, but denied
  the consolations of domestic happiness, and had imagined that the Turkish
  woman was probably the most unhappy of all the daughters of Eve. What a deal
  of commiseration thrown away! Perhaps no woman in the world is more
  completely her own mistress in her own way than is the wife of a Turkish
  dignitary. Habit reconciles her to the veil, which indeed is of the thinnest
  material, and is almost her only restriction. She can walk abroad for
  business or pleasure, attended by only one female slave, and with such a
  convoy comes and goes unquestioned. It is only of very late years that an
  English lady could walk through the streets of London without at least as
  efficient a guard. The Oriental beauty, too, has her own hours, and her own
  apartments. Even her lord himself, he whom we picture as a turbaned
  Blue-beard, despotic in his own household, the terror of his wives and
  servants, preserves a chivalrous etiquette towards the lady that adorns his
  harem. He does not venture to cross the threshold of her apartment should he
  find her slippers placed outside. It is a signal that he is not wanted, and
  nothing would induce him to be guilty of such an act of rudeness as to go in.
  He comes at stated times, and his visits are always preceded by due notice.
  He lavishes handsome presents on his departure, and when he is unable to sun
  himself in the sight of her beauty, in consequence of his other engagements,
  and the rest of the suns in whose rays it is his duty to bask, he provides
  her with ca ques and <i>arabas</i> to take her abroad, and furnishes her with
  plenty of pin-money to spend in the delightful occupation of shopping.</p>

  <p>The chief of the negro-guard looked wistfully at me as I accompanied him,
  rolling the whites of his eyes in evident uncertainty and perturbation. As,
  however, Zuleika was still senseless, it seemed absolutely necessary that I
  should prescribe for her before my departure, and, accordingly, he motioned
  me to follow the stout blacks who were carrying her into the very inner
  recesses of the harem.</p>

  <p>As I passed through those luxuriously-furnished apartments, I could not
  refrain from casting many a curious glance around at the diverse implements
  and accessories of the Turkish toilette, the many devices practised here, as
  in all lands, by the ladies, to "keep them beautiful or leave them neat."
  Costly shawls, silks from India, muslins like the web of a gossamer, and
  brocades stiff and gorgeous as cloth of gold, were scattered about in
  unlimited profusion, mixed with amber beads, massive gold chains, necklaces,
  bracelets, and anklets, French watches set to Turkish time, precious stones
  of every value and hue, sandal-wood fans, and other rare knick-knacks, mixed
  up with the most insignificant articles one can imagine, such as card-racks,
  envelope-cases of papier-mach&eacute;, small brushes with oval mirrors at
the back,
  and all sorts of trifles sent out from Paris, and bought in Pera, to amuse
  those grown-up children. The rooms were lofty and spacious, but the
  casements, even those that overlooked the gardens, jealously closed, and the
  lattices almost impervious even to the cool northern breeze. Bath-rooms
  opened from either side of the apartments, and every appliance for that
  Turkish luxury was of the most complete kind. At length we reached the room
  appropriated to Zuleika's especial use, and as her bearers laid her on the
  divan I observed that in this, more than in any other apartment of the
  palace, luxury reigned supreme. I argued Zuleika must be, at least for the
  present, the reigning favourite and queen of the seraglio.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch33"
     name="ch33"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII. &mdash; MY PATIENT</h2>

  <p class="first">"With the blessing of Allah! rub the palms of her hands with
  saffron!"</p>

  <p>"Allah-Illah! Allah-Illah!&mdash;tickle the soles of her feet with
  feathers!"</p>

  <p>"It is destiny! In the name of the Prophet pour cold water down her back!"
  "Room for the Frankish <i>Hakim</i>!" "May dogs defile the grave of the
  Giaour!"</p>

  <p>Such were the exclamations that followed me into the apartment of Zuleika;
  for the Moslem daughters of Eve are not exempt from the curiosity attributed
  by tradition to the common mother; and have, moreover, superinduced on that
  pardonable failing certain prejudices of their own against the Christian
  unbeliever, whom, even when availing themselves of his assistance, they do
  not scruple to curse fluently, spitting the while between their teeth with
  considerable energy and effect.</p>

  <p>Pending the application of their customary remedies, which in my ignorance
  of fainting-fits I judged to be the professional course of treatment, the
  ladies of the harem crowded and chatted at the door, peering over each
  other's shoulders, advancing a step into the apartment, retiring in confusion
  with a giggle and a scream, flirting atrociously with their negro
  guards&mdash;men of ebony without and ice within, as indeed they had need
  be&mdash;and otherwise to the best of their abilities increasing the general
  confusion.</p>

  <p>One alone came boldly forward to my assistance; venerable she was, but a
  dame whom age, though it had deprived her of charms, had not robbed of the
  enchanting timidity of youth.</p>

  <p>In her efforts to assist the sufferer she had cast her veil aside, but
  true to Oriental modesty she scrupulously covered her mouth[#] (and a very
  black set of teeth) with her hand even while she addressed me. Authoritative
  in her manner, and evidently accustomed to despotic sway in this part of the
  establishment, I confess I sincerely pitied the Pasha to whom this energetic
  lady must for several years have belonged. She came close up to me, tore the
  <i>yashmak</i> from Zuleika's face, and exclaimed in tones which admitted of
  no dispute&mdash;</p>

  <p class="footnote">[#] A curious custom peculiar to the sex all over the
  East. The veil, indeed, seems only adopted as a screen for the mouth, since
  the eyes are suffered to flash undimmed by its transparent folds. Should a
  Turkish woman be surprised by chance without her <i>yashmak</i>, she
  immediately claps her hand to her lips, and so remains till the male stranger
  has passed by.</p>

  <p>"Bring otto of roses to anoint our dove; strip her at once from head to
  foot; and kick the Giaour downstairs!"</p>

  <p>It was now time to assume a certain amount of dignified authority. I waved
  away the uncompromising old lady with the air of a magician dismissing his
  familiar; I ordered the lattice to be immediately thrown
  open&mdash;fortunately it looked towards the east, which was considered much
  to enhance the virtue of the breeze that stole through its aperture&mdash;and
  taking advantage of the returning animation which dawned on Zuleika's
  countenance, I repeated an incantation in English&mdash;if I remember right
  it was the negro melody of "<i>Oh, Susannah!</i>" accompanying the monotonous
  tones with appropriate gestures, until my patient opened her languishing
  black eyes, glanced heavily around her, and sitting upright on her couch,
  announced herself completely recovered.</p>

  <p>My popularity was now at the flood. Had I administered the simple remedies
  which I have since been informed are beneficial in such cases, I should,
  however successful, have been looked upon merely in the light of a common
  practitioner; but that the lady should recover to the tones of a popular air,
  accompanied by a deportment of ludicrous solemnity, constituted a success
  which stamped me at once as a proficient in the Black Art, and won for me
  unqualified obedience and respect, not wholly devoid of fear.</p>

  <p>To take advantage of the happy moment, I pulled my watch from my pocket,
  and placing my finger on the patient's wrist, bid the imperious dame
  aforesaid remark how the pulsations corresponded with the ticks of that
  instrument. This, too, was a great discovery, and the watch was handed round
  for examination to all the curious inmates of the harem in turn.</p>

  <p>I then ordered the room to be cleared, and insisted that I should be left
  alone with my patient until the minute-hand of my watch had reached the
  favourable hour.</p>

  <p>This I knew would give me five minutes' conversation with Zuleika, and as
  I expected the Pasha home at every instant, I could not afford more than this
  short space of time to give my friend the Beloochee's message and plead his
  cause. The room was speedily cleared, not, however, without much laughing,
  screaming, and scuffling in the passage. As soon as I was alone with Zuleika,
  I whispered gently in her ear not to be afraid, but to trust me, as I came
  from him she loved best in the world.</p>

  <p>The girl started, and began to tremble violently; she was so pale that I
  dreaded another fainting-fit, and the consequent destruction of my reputation
  as a doctor. Though an Arab, she was a <i>woman</i>; and at this crisis of
  her destiny was of course paralysed by fear and totally incapable of acting
  for herself. Had her emotion mastered her once more, the golden opportunity
  would have been lost; there was nothing for it but to work upon her feelings,
  and I proceeded in a tone of indifference&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You have forgotten him. He bids me say that 'the rose has been
  transplanted into a garden of purer air and cooler streams; he has seen with
  his own eyes that she is blooming and fragrant, and he is satisfied. He
  rejoices in your happiness, and bids you farewell!'"</p>

  <p>She burst into a flood of tears; her woman's heart was touched, as I hoped
  it would be, by the sentiment I had put into her lover's mouth, and the
  relief thus afforded brought her composure and self-command. She came of a
  race, too, that never lacked courage or fortitude, and the wild desert-blood
  soon mantled once more in her rich, soft cheek&mdash;the tameless spirit of
  the Bedouin soon flashed again from her large dark eyes.</p>

  <p>"Effendi!" she replied, in a firm though mournful voice, "my father's
  daughter can never forget. Bid him think no more of the rose he cherished so
  fondly. She has been plucked from the stem, and now she is drooping and
  withering away."</p>

  <p>"But Allah suffers not the flowers to perish," I proceeded in Oriental
  metaphor, while she clasped her slender hands and seemed to look through me
  with her glittering eyes. "He sends the dews from heaven to refresh them at
  night. A wild bird will sing to the rose before dawn, and she will open her
  petals and bloom once more fresh and glistening in the morning sun. Zuleika,
  have you completely forgotten Ali Mesrour?"</p>

  <p>At the sound of his name a soft, saddened expression stole over her eager
  face, large drops gathered in her drooping eyelashes, and it was with a
  thrilling voice that she replied&mdash;"Never! never! once more to see him,
  only once more to hear his voice, and so to die! so to die!" she repeated,
  looking dreamily as if into the hopeless future.</p>

  <p>"It is destiny," was my answer. "There is but one Allah! An hour before
  dawn there will be a ca que at the garden gate. Zuleika must contrive the
  rest. The risk is great, but 'the diver cannot fetch pearls without wetting
  his hair.' Will Zuleika promise?"</p>

  <p>"I promise!" was all she had time to reply, for at this instant no slight
  commotion was heard in the household, and looking from the casement I
  perceived an eight-oared ca que brought alongside of the palace steps, from
  which a pipe-bearer springing rapidly ashore, followed by a more sedate
  personage, evidently a <i>kiatib</i>, or secretary, heralded the great man of
  the party, who, emerging from the shade of a white silk umbrella, hitherto
  held carefully over him by a third official, now laboured majestically up the
  marble steps, pausing occasionally to draw a long breath, and looking around
  him the while with an air of corpulent satisfaction that no one but a Turk
  could imitate with the slightest prospect of success.</p>

  <p>It was indeed the Pasha himself&mdash;the fortunate possessor of the
  magnificent dwelling, the owner of all these negro slaves, this gorgeous
  retinue, these beautiful women&mdash;and more still, the lord and master of
  poor Zuleika. I thought it better to meet him on the threshold than to risk
  his astonishment and displeasure by awaiting his entrance into the harem;
  accordingly I hurried down to the court-yard of his palace, and presented
  myself before him with a mixture of Eastern courtesy and European
  self-respect, such as never fails to impress a Turk with the feeling that in
  the presence of a Frank he is himself but of an inferior order of
  mankind.</p>

  <p>"Salaam, Effendi!" was the observation of the proprietor, as polite and
  unmoved as if he had expected me all day. "You are welcome! My house with all
  it contains is at your disposal!" He motioned me courteously into a large,
  handsome apartment on the ground-floor of the palace, bid me to be seated,
  and clapping his palms together, called for pipes and coffee; then placing
  himself comfortably on the divan, he crossed his hands over his stomach, and
  repeated, "You are welcome!" after which he sat perfectly silent, nodding his
  head from side to side, and peering curiously at me out of his small,
  twinkling grey eyes.</p>

  <p>He was an enormously fat man, buttoned up of course into the usual
  single-breasted frock-coat, on the outside of which glittered the diamond
  order of the Medjidjie. His huge, shapeless legs were encased in European
  trousers of the widest dimensions, and terminated in varnished Wellington
  boots, from which he had just cast off a pair of india-rubber goloshes. It
  was the modern Turkish costume, affected by the Sultan himself, and a dress
  so ill-adapted for the dog-days at Constantinople can hardly be imagined; yet
  every official, every dignitary, every military man, is now clad in these
  untoward habiliments, for which they have discarded the picturesque draperies
  of their ancestors; so that the fine old Turk, "shawled to the eyes, and
  bearded to the nose," is only to be seen in Stamboul amongst the learned
  professions and the inferior orders of tradesmen and mechanics. A red fez was
  the single characteristic article of clothing worn by the Pasha; and a more
  villainous expression of countenance than that which it overshadowed, it has
  seldom been my lot to confront. We stared at each other without speaking. It
  would have been ill-bred on the part of my host to ask me what I wanted, and
  I should have been guilty of an equal solecism in entering on my business
  until I had partaken of the customary refreshment.</p>

  <p>Coffee was ere long brought in by negro slaves armed to the teeth, and of
  savage, scowling aspect. It was served in delicate filigree cups, set with
  priceless diamonds. Long chibouques were then filled and lighted. As I
  pressed the pure amber to my lips, and inhaled the fragrant aroma of the
  narcotic weed, I resolved to brazen it out manfully; but never, never again
  to find myself in such another scrape, no, not for all the warriors in
  Beloochistan, nor all the "Zuleikas" that ever eloped with them from the
  desert.</p>

  <p>I thought I would say nothing of my visit to the harem. I judged, and
  rightly, that neither the ladies themselves, nor the negro-guard, whose duty
  it was to watch over those caged birds, would be over anxious to communicate
  the breach of discipline which had just been enacted, and that, although the
  secret was sure to ooze out in the course of a day or two, it was needless to
  anticipate the turmoil and disturbance which would attend its discovery.</p>

  <p>But what excuse to make for my ill-timed visit? How to account for my
  intrusion on the leisure of so great a man as Papoosh Pasha, one of the
  half-dozen highest dignitaries of the empire, the friend and counsellor of
  the Sultan himself, even then fresh from the sacred precincts of the Seraglio
  Palace, where he had been helping sundry other ponderous Pashas to mismanage
  the affairs of his country, and to throw dust in the eyes of the enervated
  voluptuary who held the reins of power in a sadly palsied grasp. I too must
  take a leaf out of the book of Asiatic duplicity. I had seen a ship full of
  wounded dropping her anchor as I came along; there must have been another
  attack on the stronghold at Sebastopol&mdash;I was pretty safe in surmising,
  with no satisfactory result. I would pretend then that I had been sent to
  inform his Excellency of the particulars, and accordingly I puffed forth a
  volume of pure white smoke towards the ceiling, and advanced under cover of
  the discharge.</p>

  <p>"His Highness has sent me hither in haste to inform your Excellency of the
  great news from the front. Am I too late to be the fortunate bearer, or has
  your Excellency already heard the particulars from the Elshie?"[#]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[#] The ambassador.</p>

  <p>He darted a keen, suspicious glance at me, and replied gravely enough,
  "The war goes on prosperously in the front. We shall yet sweep 'the Moscov'
  from the face of the earth!"</p>

  <p>"I am desired to inform your Excellency," I resumed, determined to
  persevere at all hazards, "that the Allies have again attacked the place. The
  Moscov came out in great numbers to repel the assault; the French have
  suffered severely; the Turkish troops covered the retreat with great
  gallantry and steadiness; fifteen hundred Russians remained dead upon the
  field; many more are disabled; Sebastopol must surrender within ten
  days."</p>

  <p>"Mashallah!" replied the Pasha, laying his pipe down by his side; but for
  the life of me I could not make out whether or not he believed a word I had
  been telling him.</p>

  <p>"Have I fulfilled my duty to your Excellency?" I continued, becoming every
  moment more and more anxious to make my escape. "I am at your Excellency's
  disposal; I am the humblest of your slaves. Have I your permission to
  depart?"</p>

  <p>He looked uneasily around, but there seemed no apparent excuse for delay.
  It was evident to me that he wished to communicate with his retainers, but
  that his politeness forbade him to do so in my presence, and a Turk never
  allows any emergency to make him forget the exigencies of etiquette. He bade
  me farewell with much cordiality, ordered a horse to be got ready to carry me
  home, and dismissed me with many expressions of affection, but with the same
  fierce twinkle in that cunning leaden eye that had already more than once
  warned me to beware.</p>

  <p>Many and devoted were the Pasha's retainers; hundreds slept on his mats,
  and followed at his heels, but I question whether I, the poor nameless
  Interpreter, could not command a greater amount of affection, courage, and
  fidelity, in the breast of my one trusty four-footed slave and companion,
  than existed in the whole retinue, black and white, of the Oriental
  dignitary.</p>

  <p>Bold had followed me through my wanderings, faced with me many of the
  dangers of warfare, and shared in all its privations. The old dog was getting
  very time-worn now, quite grizzled about the muzzle, and ludicrously solemn,
  both in countenance and demeanour. To the world in general his temper was
  anything but conciliatory, and it required little provocation to make him set
  his mark on man or beast that affronted him; but with me he was always the
  same, obedient, devoted, and affectionate. He accompanied me everywhere, and
  would wait for hours in the court-yards of the Seraskerat or the Embassy,
  till his master emerged from the long-watched portal, when he would rise,
  give himself a lazy shake, and stalk on gravely by my side, occasionally
  thrusting his wet cold nose into my hand, and scowling at all strangers, even
  of his own species, with a very ominous "<i>noli me tangere</i>" expression,
  that forbade the slightest approach to familiarity.</p>

  <p>Now the dog is an unclean animal to the Mussulman, and although his life
  is spared, as being the authorised scavenger of the streets, the true
  disciple of the Prophet scrupulously shuns all contact with the brute that
  the Christian loves to train as a servant and cherish as a friend. There is a
  curious old Arabic legend, which, although not to be found in the Koran, is
  recognised by the faithful as a trustworthy tradition, and to believe in
  which is esteemed an essential point of doctrine by the devout, that accounts
  for this unkindly superstition. Freely translated, it runs much in the
  following fashion:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"When Allah had created the land and the sea, the mountains, the forests,
  the flowers, and the precious stones, he looked, and behold there was beauty
  and silence all over the earth.</p>

  <p>"Then Allah created the birds and the beasts and the fishes; all things
  that swim, and creep, and fly, and run, and every living thing rejoiced in
  the sunshine.</p>

  <p>"So Allah rested from his work in the Garden of Eden, by the Four Rivers,
  and looked around him, and behold the whole earth was astir in the forepart
  of the day.</p>

  <p>"Then the breeze blew, and the waters laughed and rippled, and the birds
  sang, and the blossoms fell.</p>

  <p>"So the angels smiled, and said, Praise be to Allah. It is very
  good&mdash;Allah! Bismillah!</p>

  <p>"Then Allah saw that there were none of the inhabitants of earth that
  could smile as the angels smiled, or walk erect and praise him with the face
  to heaven.</p>

  <p>"For the steed was grazing downward, and the lion lay couched in his lair,
  and the eagle, though she turned her eye to the sun, had neither praise nor
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Then Allah took clay, and moistened it, and fashioned it till the sun
  went down.</p>

  <p>"And Allah rested from his work, and left it in the Garden of Eden, by the
  Great Tree, where the Four Rivers spring.</p>

  <p>"Now Gabriel walked in the garden, and he stopped where the work of Allah
  lay plastic on the sward, and the star shone bright on his forehead, for he
  praised Allah in his heart.</p>

  <p>"And Shaitn came to walk in the garden, to cool his brow, and he stopped
  over against Gabriel and mocked.</p>

  <p>"And Shaitn said, 'What is this, that I may know it, and name it, and
  claim my share in it for my own?'</p>

  <p>"And Gabriel answered, 'Praise be to Allah; who has made all things well.
  This is Allah's work, and it shall be the perfection of all. Bismillah!'</p>

  <p>"Then Shaitn laughed once more, and he turned the image over with his
  foot, so that it stood on all fours, with its face to the dust, and spat upon
  it, and said, 'It is empty! On my eyes be it!'</p>

  <p>"And in the morning there was silence in Eden, for the work of Allah had
  been defiled.</p>

  <p>"And Allah said, 'This is the doing of Shaitn. Behold, I will make of it
  yet another brute, and it shall be called the Dog, and be accursed.</p>

  <p>"'And I will take other clay, and fashion another image that shall smile
  as the angels smile, and walk erect with its face to heaven, and I will call
  it Man.'</p>

  <p>"And Shaitn cowered behind the Great Tree and listened to the voice of
  Allah, and though he trembled, he smiled.</p>

  <p>"For Shaitn knew that he would have his share in the Man as in the
  beast."</p>

  <p>Poor Bold, unconscious of his excommunication, hurried up to me in the
  court-yard of the Pasha's palace, where a fine horse, richly caparisoned, was
  being brought alongside the mounting-block for my use. In doing so the dog's
  tail, waving to greet his master, touched the hand of a tall
  forbidding-looking negro that stood by, grinning from ear to ear, as is the
  custom of his countrymen. The black swore a great oath, and kicked my dog
  savagely in the jaws. As Bold pinned him by the leg, I caught him such a
  buffet under the ear as knocked him fairly into the dust; from which abject
  position he embraced my feet and called me "his father." With some little
  difficulty I rated Bold off his prostrate foe, and mounting my horse, or
  rather the Pasha's, rode quietly to my hotel, where I dismissed the steed,
  and the groom who had accompanied him on foot, with a "<i>baksheesh</i>," and
  thought nothing more of the transaction. "A word and a blow" is as common a
  proceeding in Constantinople as at Donnybrook fair, though it leads to far
  different results; inasmuch as in the former abode of despotic authority and
  slavish submission it is very generally the only argument that is capable of
  enforcing proper subordination and respect.</p>

  <p>It is seldom that a man loses his temper, even under the greatest
  provocation, without having cause, sooner or later, to regret his want of
  self-command. There are few of our fellow-creatures so unimportant that it is
  not worth while to conciliate them, none that may not some time have it in
  their power to inflict on us an injury; besides, an angry man is only less
  contemptible than a frightened one. And, like everything else that is
  unchristianlike, it is surely ungentlemanlike to put oneself in a passion.
  There was not much in knocking down a negro slave for his brutality towards
  my favourite, yet, ere long, I had cause bitterly to rue that I had not let
  him alone.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[#] Porters.</p>

  <p>The REAL thing from the Crimea, in a curiously worn-out shell jacket,
  patched and darned, stained and tarnished, with a bronzed face, a bushy beard
  of two years' growth, and a slight limp that for the rest of his life will
  bid him "remember the fifth of November," and the turning of the tide upon
  the declivity of Inkermann.</p>

  <p>Two or three English merchants, like crows, to be seen all over the world,
  and everywhere in the same dress, with white shirts, and honest broad-cloth
  coats, that remind one of home; a Queen's messenger, with tweed
  shooting-jacket and official forage-cap, clean shaved and clear-looking,
  after the bad passage and gale of wind he is sure at all seasons to encounter
  in the Mediterranean, a miracle to us <i>habitu&eacute;s</i> of the place,
being
  actually as fresh from London as yonder copy of <i>The Times</i> newspaper,
  which came with him by the same mail, the only unfeathered biped in creation
  that thoroughly carries out the idea of "Here to-day, gone to-morrow." Such
  are the concomitants of the scene upon which I enter at the door of
  Messirie's hotel, that well-known rendezvous in Pera where congregate all
  that have any connection with the mother country; a place where every rumour
  is to be heard with its latest embellishments, and where, for the sum of
  seventeen francs a day, I can command a moderate breakfast, a dinner into the
  components of which it is better not to inquire, and a murky bedroom, where
  the fierce mosquito shall drain my life-blood all the weary night.</p>

  <p>"Is Major Manners in the hotel?" I inquire, as I throw myself off the
  Pasha's horse, and, glancing at a face in the street very like that of the
  man I knocked down some three-quarters of an hour ago, reflect what a family
  resemblance reigns amongst the wretched sons of Ham. Bold is in his worst of
  humours, and growls ominously. "Is Major Manners here?" I repeat, and three
  Greek servants, with an abortive attempt to pronounce the Frankish name,
  shrug their shoulders and open their hands to express the hopeless imbecility
  in which they rejoice. I perceive a stout man in a white hat, picking his
  teeth unconcernedly in the passage, and, recognising him for the master, I
  apply at once for the information I require. He looks contemptuously at me in
  reply, and, turning his broad back upon me, walks off without deigning to
  take any further notice of a customer; but I have been here before, and I
  know there is balm in Gilead. I know that in a certain little room on the
  left I shall find the hostess, and that she, the mainstay and prop of the
  establishment, will spare no pains to assist a countryman. Kindly Madame
  Messirie! always ready to aid one in a difficulty, always busy, always
  good-humoured, always so thoroughly English, it was quite refreshing to hear
  the tones of your homely voice, and fancy oneself in the "White Lion," or the
  "Blue Bear," or some other pleasant hostelry, with post-horses and a bar, and
  an ostler's bell, far away in merry England.</p>

  <p>"Vere Egerton! can that be you?" said a voice that I thought I recognised,
  as I entered the sanctum in which the hostess reigned supreme. "Little
  Egerton, as I'm alive, growed out of knowledge, and doubtless by this time a
  Pasha with three tails, and a true believer. Tell me all about the process of
  conversion and the tenets of your faith."</p>

  <p>It was indeed Ropsley,&mdash;Ropsley the Guardsman&mdash;Ropsley the
  dandy, but how altered! The attenuated <i>rou&eacute;</i> of former days had
grown
  large and muscular, his face was brown and healthy, his forehead frank and
  open, the clear grey eye was brighter and quicker than it used to be; it had
  caught the ready, eager glance of those who look death habitually in the
  face, but had lost much of the cruel, calculating, leaden expression I
  remembered so well. Despite his worn-out uniform, the rents in which showed
  here and there a red flannel shirt,&mdash;despite his close-cropped hair and
  flowing beard,&mdash;I could not but confess to myself, as I grasped his
  hand, that Ropsley looked ten years younger and ten times handsomer than when
  I saw him last.</p>

  <p>Yes, I met him cordially, and as an old friend. 'Tis true he had been my
  greatest enemy, 'tis true he had inflicted on me a wound, the scar of which I
  felt I should carry to my grave; but months had passed away since then;
  months which, crowding events upon events, had seemed like years; months of
  danger, labour, hardship, and tribulation. Of what avail is suffering if it
  does not soften and purify the heart? Why are those that mourn blessed, if it
  is not that they learn the bitter lesson grief alone can teach? My task had
  been a hard one&mdash;how hard none knew save the poor humbled scholar who
  conned it day by day, and blistered the page with his tears; but I had
  conquered it at last, and so I freely forgave Ropsley, and clasped him by the
  hand.</p>

  <p>"You dine here, of course," he said, in his old half-humorous,
  half-sarcastic voice. "Madame Messirie, princess of Pera, and queen of my
  soul, order a place to be set for my friend the Pasha, and lots of champagne
  to be put in ice. I have only just come down from the front; I have scarcely
  had a decent dinner, or seen a silver fork, for a year and a half. It's an
  endless business, this, Egerton; hammer, hammer, hammer, yet nothing comes of
  it, and the old place looks whiter and more inviting than ever, but we
  <i>can't get in</i>!"</p>

  <p>"And the Mamelon?" said I, eager for the last news from the spot to which
  millions of hearts were reaching, all athirst for hope.</p>

  <p>"Got it at last," was his reply, "at least, our neighbours have; I hope
  they'll keep it. We made a sad mess last week, Egerton; lost no end of men,
  and half our best officers. Whew! I say nothing, only mark my words, if
  ever&mdash;but there's the bell! Never mind the siege now. War's a mistake,
  but dinner (if you can get it) never deceives you." And so saying, the
  <i>ci-devant</i> dandy patted me on the back, and pushed me before him into
  the well-lighted and now crowded <i>salon</i>.</p>

  <p>In that strange country, so thoroughly Asiatic, which we call Turkey in
  Europe, there were so few links to connect us with the life of civilisation
  which seemed to have passed from us like a dream, that it was no wonder we
  clung to Messirie's hotel and thronged its <i>table d'hte</i> with a
  constancy and devotion less to be attributed to its own intrinsic merits than
  to the associations and reminiscences it called forth. Here were to be met
  all the gallant fellows who were going to, or coming from, the front. Heroes,
  whose names were destined to gild the page of history, might here be seen
  drinking bad tea and complaining of the butter like ordinary mortals; but
  always in the highest spirits, as men seem invariably to be during the short
  lulls of a campaign. When you are likely to be shot next Monday week, if you
  have small hopes, you have few anxieties. Here, too, you might sit opposite a
  diplomatist, who was supposed to know the innermost secrets of the court at
  Vienna, and to be advised of what "the Austrians meant to do," whilst rubbing
  shoulders with you as he helped himself to fish; and confronting the man of
  ciphers, some heroic refugee, Pole, Croat, or Hungarian, whose name was in
  every journal in Europe, as it was inscribed on every military post in
  Austria or Russia, munched away with a capital appetite, and appeared only
  conspicuous for the extreme modesty and gentleness of his demeanour.
  Contractors of every nation jabbered in every language, nor was the supple
  Armenian, grafting the bold spirit of European speculation on his own
  Oriental duplicity, wanting to grasp his share of the plunder, which John
  Bull was so magnanimously offering as a premium to every description of
  fraud. Even the softer sex was not without its representatives. Two or three
  high-born English ladies, whose loving hearts had brought them hovering as
  near the seat of war as it was possible for a non-combatant to venture, daily
  shed the light of their presence at the dinner-table, and were silently
  welcomed by many a bold spirit with a degree of chivalrous enthusiasm, of
  which, anxious and pre-occupied, they were but little aware. A man must have
  been living for months among men, must have felt his nature gradually
  brutalising amidst the hardships, the sufferings, and the horrors of war,
  thoroughly to appreciate the softening influence of a woman's, and especially
  of a <i>countrywoman's</i>, society. Even to look on those waving white
  dresses, those gentle English faces, with their blooming cheeks and rich
  brown hair, was like a draught of water to a pilgrim in a weary land. It
  reminded us of home&mdash;of those we loved&mdash;and we went our way back
  into the desert a thought saddened, perhaps, yet, for all that, kindlier and
  happier men.</p>

  <p>"What a meeting!" exclaimed Manners, as, gorgeously arrayed in the
  splendours of a full-dress uniform, he took his seat by my side and shook
  hands with Ropsley, who returned his greeting with a cordial pressure and a
  look of quiet amusement in his eye that almost upset my gravity: "Everdon at
  Constantinople!" continued our former usher; "we only want De Rohan to make
  our gathering quite perfect!"</p>

  <p>I winced, and for the first time in my life I saw Ropsley colour, but
  Manners was too much occupied to notice the emotion of either of us; for,
  during his many visits to Constantinople, the dashing officer of
  Bashi-Bazouks had made such numerous acquaintances, and become so necessary
  an ingredient in the society of Pera, that there seemed to be hardly an
  individual at table, from the <i>attach&eacute;</i> of the Embassy down to the
  last-joined officer of the Commissariat, with whom he was not on terms of
  intimate familiarity. He had scarcely taken his seat and unfolded his
  dinner-napkin, ere the cross-fire of greetings and inquiries began. Manners,
  too, in the sunshine of all his popularity, had expanded into a wag; and
  although his witticisms were of a somewhat profound order, and not always
  very apparent to the superficial observer, they were generally well received;
  for a wag was a scarcer article in Constantinople than at the front.</p>

  <p>So Manners proceeds with his dinner in great satisfaction and glory. After
  a couple of glasses of champagne he becomes overpoweringly brilliant. He is
  good enough, too, to take upon himself the onerous task of drilling the
  waiters, which he affects in bad French, and of abusing the deficiencies of
  the <i>cuisine</i>; a topic affording, indeed, ample scope for declamation.
  The waiters, especially a cunning old Greek, with a most villainous
  expression of countenance, betray an immense respect for Manners, tinged with
  an amused sort of amazement, and always help him first.</p>

  <p>They bring him a dish of hare, large of limb and venerable in point of
  years. Our Bashi-Bazouk exclaims indignantly, "<i>Qu'est que
&ccedil;a?</i>"</p>

  <p>"<i>C'est un li&egrave;vre, M'sieur</i>," replies the waiter, with a forced
  smile, as of one who expects a jest he will not comprehend.</p>

  <p>"<i>C'est un chat!</i>" gasps out Manners, glaring indignantly on the
  official.</p>

  <p>"<i>Pardon, M'sieur,</i>" says the waiter, "<i>c'est trop gros pour un
  chat.</i>"</p>

  <p>"<i>Chat</i>," repeats Manners; "<i>Chat</i> THOMAS!" he adds, in a
  sepulchral voice, and with a frowning brow. The waiter shrinks abashed, the
  company laugh, and Manners's observation counts for a joke.</p>

  <p>By this time conversation begins to buzz pretty freely around. Everybody
  drinks champagne, and tongues soon become loosened by the exhilarating fluid.
  Various topics are discussed, including a new beauty that has just arrived
  from Smyrna, of French extraction, and supposed to possess a fortune that
  sounds perfectly fabulous when calculated in francs. Manners listens
  attentively, for he has not totally abandoned the idea of combining the
  excitement of war with the pursuit of beauty&mdash;properly gilded, of
  course&mdash;and his maxim is that "None but the brave deserve the fair." Her
  praises, however, as also her name and address, are intercepted by the
  voluble comments of two stout gentlemen, his neighbours, on the utter
  incapacity of the Turkish Government, and the hopeless imbecility of "the
  people of this unhappy country, Sir,&mdash;a people without a notion of
  progress&mdash;-destined to decay, Sir, from the face of the earth," as the
  stouter of the two, a British merchant, who is about investing in land here,
  remarks to his neighbour, a jovial Frenchman, who has already bought many a
  fertile acre in the neighbourhood of Constantinople, under the new
  Hatti-Sheriff;[#] and who replies, fixing his napkin securely in his
  button-hole&mdash;</p>

  <p class="footnote">[#] An act empowering foreigners to hold land in
  Turkey.</p>

  <p>"<i>Pourri, voyez-vous, mon cher. Crac! &Ccedil;a ne durera pas trois
  ans.</i>"</p>

  <p>Opposite these worthies, an ensign in the Guards, and the Queen's
  messenger, who is of a theatrical turn, are busy with the character, private
  as well as professional, of a certain star of the Opera, whom the latter has
  already criticised in the execution of his duty at Vienna, and an ardent
  desire to hear whom haunts the former enthusiast to such a degree, even in
  the very trenches, that he longs to attack and take Sebastopol single-handed,
  in order to get home again before she leaves London for the winter. The
  Turkish Ministry, changing as it does about once a week; the policy of
  Austria; the Emperor Napoleon's energy; the inefficiency of our own
  Commissariat; the ludicrous blunders of the War Office, and the last retort
  courteous of Lord Stratford, all come in for their share of remark from
  prejudiced observers of every party and every opinion; but by degrees one
  voice rises louder than the rest, one individual attracts the notice of the
  whole dinner-table, and nowise abashed, but rather encouraged by the
  attention he commands, details volubly his own account of the capture of the
  Mamelon. He is a Frenchman, and a civilian, but somehow he has a red ribbon
  on his breast, and belongs to the Legion of Honour, so he "assisted," as he
  calls it, at the attack; and if he speaks truth, it must indeed have been an
  awful sight, and one in which his countrymen outdid themselves for valour,
  and that quality peculiar to the soldiers of France which they term
  <i>&eacute;lan</i>, a word it is hopeless to think of translating. His
opinions are
  decided, if not satisfactory; his plan of storming the place an excellent
  one, if it could only be carried out.</p>

  <p>"We have taken the Mamelon!" says he, "and what remains? Bah! The
  Malakhoff Tower is the key to the whole position. What would you have? Every
  simple soldier in the army knows it as well as you and I do. I tell you I
  'assisted' at the capture of the <i>Mamelon Vert</i>. They received us with a
  fire, well sustained, of grape and small arms. Our ammunition failed us at
  the critical moment. I was in the ditch&mdash;<i>me!</i>&mdash;when the
  Zouaves came on with their yell&mdash;the 152nd of the line were in front of
  them. It must be carried with the bayonet!&mdash;<i>Pflan!</i>&mdash;our
  little red pantaloons were swarming up the work and over the parapet ere you
  could count ten&mdash;the tricolor was hoisted and the guns spiked in a
  twinkling&mdash;that is the only way to arrange these affairs. Now, see
  here&mdash;you have your Redan, you others&mdash;you have sapped up to it, as
  near as you can get. There must be a combined attack. You cannot hold it till
  we have silenced that little rogue of a Malakhoff. What to do? One of these
  '<i>four mornings</i>,' as it was with the Mamelon so will it be with the
  Malakhoff! Give me a thick column, with the Zouaves in front and rear. These
  are not follies. I advance my column under cover&mdash;I pour in a
  volley!&mdash;I rush on with the bayonet! At the same moment the Redan falls.
  Your Guards and Scotchmen run in with their heads, a thousand cannon support
  you with their fire, the Allies hold the two most important defences, the
  Garden Batteries are silenced. Chut! the place is ours! France and England
  are looking on. I do not say that this will be done; but this is how it ought
  to be done. If your generals are fools, what is that to me? I am not a
  general&mdash;I!&mdash;but a simple civilian!&mdash;Waiter, a cigar! <i>Qui
  vivra, verra</i>."</p>

  <p>It is all <i>pipe-clay</i>, as the soldiers call it, now. The one
  engrossing topic silences every other. Alma, Inkermann, Lord Raglan's flank
  march, and the earlier incidents of the siege, are related by the very men
  who took an active share in those deeds of glory. Two cavalry officers, both
  wounded on the fatal day, recapitulate once more the <i>pros</i> and
  <i>cons</i> of the immortal charge at Balaklava&mdash;a question that has
  been vexed and argued till the very actors themselves in that most brilliant
  of disasters scarcely know how they got in, and still less how they ever got
  out. Though struck down by the same shell, and within ten yards of one
  another, each takes a diametrically opposite view of the whole transaction
  from his comrade. They differ materially as to time, position, pace, and
  results; above all, as to the merits of the leader whose wreath of laurels
  faded as undeservedly as it bloomed prematurely.</p>

  <p>"I was close behind him the whole way," says the one; "I never saw a
  fellow so cool in my life, or so well 'got up.' He regulated every stride of
  that good chestnut horse like clock-work. When we came into fire, our line
  was dressed as if on parade. I know it by my own squadron. Will you tell me
  <i>that</i> man lost his head?"</p>

  <p>"But where was he after we rode through the guns?" replied the other.
  "Answer me that! I grant you he took us in like a <i>brick</i>. But why
  didn't he bring us out? I never saw him after I was hit, and I <i>must</i>
  have seen him if he had rallied the first line, and been in his proper place
  to look out for his support. You were close to me, old fellow! I never knew
  before that bob-tailed Irish horse of yours could gallop a mile and a half.
  You were sickish, my boy, for I saw your face; but your eyesight was
  unimpaired. Tell me, did <i>you</i> see him, and what was he doing?"</p>

  <p>"I <i>did</i>, I'll swear!" answers the partisan, as fine a specimen of a
  young hussar as ever drew a sword. "And I'll tell you what he was doing.
  Mind, I don't say it because I <i>like him</i>, for I don't. Confound him! he
  put me under arrest once in Dublin, and I believe it was only because my
  boots weren't well blacked. But I saw him, with my own eyes, striking at
  three Cossacks, who were prodding him with their long lances; and if poor old
  Champion had not dropped under me just at that moment, I'd have gone in and
  had a shy to help him, if I lost my stick. No, no! he's game as a pebble, let
  them say what they will; and if it wasn't for those cursed papers, he'd have
  had all the credit he deserves. It was the quickest thing I ever rode to, my
  boy," adds the young one, rather flushed, and drinking off his champagne at a
  gulp in his excitement. "He had a <i>lead</i>, and he kept it right well, and
  I won't hear him run down."</p>

  <p>"I don't care," replies his friend. "I maintain it's a general's duty to
  know everything that's going on. I maintain he ought to have stood still and
  looked about him (to be sure, we couldn't see much in that smoke); ay! and,
  if necessary, waited there for the Heavies to come up. Now, I'll prove it to
  you in five minutes, if you'll only listen, you obstinate young beggar! Do
  you remember, just before we were both hit, your saying to me, 'What a go
  this is!' and my answering, 'Whatever we do, we must keep the men together,
  but half my horses are blown.' Do you remember that?"</p>

  <p>"I <i>admit</i> nothing," answers the young man, laughing, "but I do
  remember that. It was just before we saw that strong body of Russian cavalry
  in rear of the guns, and I don't make out now why they weren't down upon
  us."</p>

  <p>"Never mind that," pursues his opponent. "They behaved very steadily, and
  retired in good order; but you remember the circumstance. Well, he was then
  about six horses' lengths from us on our fight."</p>

  <p>"On our left," interposes the younger man&mdash;"on our left; for I
  remember poor Blades was knocked over between me and him."</p>

  <p>"On our <i>right</i>," persists the other. "I am certain of it, my dear
  fellow, for I remarked at the time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am positive he was on our left! I remember it as well as if it was
  yesterday."</p>

  <p>"I could take my oath he was on our right; for I recollect seeing his
  sabretasche swinging."</p>

  <p>"Left!" says one, "Right!" says the other; and they never advance one step
  farther in the discussion, which will be prolonged far into the night, to the
  consumption of much brandy and water, together with countless cigars, but
  with no further result.</p>

  <p>If no two men see any one action of common life in the same light, how
  hopeless must it be to endeavour to get at the true statement of an event
  which takes place in the presence of a crowd of witnesses, all excited, all
  in peril of their lives, all enveloped in the dense smoke of a hundred guns,
  all maddening with the fierce, blood-stirring turmoil of such a deed of arms
  as the death-ride at Balaklava.</p>

  <p>The instant dinner is finished, and coffee served, cigars are lit. It is a
  signal for the ladies to retire, and our handsome countrywomen sail out of
  the room, with that stately walk that none but an English lady ever succeeds
  in effecting. Many a glance follows them as they disappear; many a stout
  heart tightens under its scarlet covering, to think of the ideal at
  home&mdash;her gloves, her dress, her fragrant hair, her graceful gestures,
  and the gentle smile that may never gladden him again. Men are strange
  mixtures! the roughest and the coldest exteriors sometimes hide the most
  sensitive feelings; and when I hear a man professing audacious libertinism,
  and a supreme contempt for women, I always mistrust the bravado that is but a
  covering for his weakness, and set him down at once as a puppet, that a pair
  of white hands&mdash;if one only knew where to find them&mdash;can turn and
  twist and set aside at will.</p>

  <p>Ropsley was much softer in his manner than he used to be. Had he, too,
  experienced the common fate? Was the dandy Guardsman no longer impervious,
  <i>nulli penetrabilis astro</i>? Painful as was the subject, he talked much
  of the De Rohans. He had seen Constance married; he had heard repeatedly from
  Victor during the past year; and though he evidently knew my hopes and their
  disappointment, by the tenderness with which he handled the subject, he could
  not resist enlarging on the topic, and talking to me of that family, in which
  I could never cease to take the warmest interest. I winced, and yet I
  listened, for I longed to know and hear of her even now. I would have lain
  quietly on the rack only to be told of her welfare. It <i>was</i> painful
  too. Perhaps there is no moment at which the heart feels so empty&mdash;at
  which the hopelessness of a loss is so completely realised, as when we hear
  the idol of our lives talked of in a matter-of-course way, as being totally
  unconnected with, and independent of, ourselves.</p>

  <p>I remarked that, of his own accord, Ropsley never mentioned
Val&eacute;rie. To an
  inquiry of mine as to the welfare of my kind and handsome nurse, he gave, I
  thought, rather an abrupt reply; and, turning suddenly round to Manners,
  asked him "if there was nothing to be done in the evening in this stupid
  place?" To which our gallant Bashi-Bazouk, who considered himself responsible
  for our amusement, answered delightedly, "No opera yet, Ropsley, though we
  shall have one in six weeks; no evening parties either, except a few amongst
  the French inhabitants&mdash;delightful people, you know, and very select. I
  am invited to-night to a little music, not far from here. I could take you
  both, if you like, with <i>me</i>. As friends of mine you would be most
  welcome. You speak French, Ropsley, if I remember right?"</p>

  <p>"A little," replied the latter, much amused, "but <i>not</i> with <i>your
  accent</i>;" which, indeed, was true enough; for he had lived a good deal at
  Paris, and knew Chantilly as well as Newmarket. "Am I well enough dressed,
  though, for your fastidious friends?" he added, glancing, not without a gleam
  of inward satisfaction, from his own war-worn, threadbare uniform, to
  Manners's brilliant and somewhat startling costume.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't be better!" replied the latter; "looks workmanlike, and all
  that. This time next year I only hope mine will be half as good. Meanwhile,
  come along, you and Egerton; never mind your cigars, they all smoke
  here."</p>

  <p>"What! ladies and all, at these <i>select</i> parties?" laughed Ropsley.
  "I thought we were going amongst a lot of duchesses: but I hope they don't
  drink as well?"</p>

  <p>"Custom of the country, my dear sir," replied Manners, gravely&mdash;"only
  cigarettes, of course. If a young lady offers to roll you one, don't refuse
  it. These little things are matters of etiquette, and it is as well to know
  beforehand." So, drilling us on the proper behaviour to be observed at a Pera
  party, our cicerone swaggered out into the night air, clanking his spurs, and
  rattling his sabre, with a degree of jingling vigour which seemed to afford
  him unlimited satisfaction. It was rather good to see Ropsley of the
  Guards&mdash;the man who had the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> to all the best houses
in
  London, the arbiter of White's, the quoted of diners-out, the favourite of
  fine ladies&mdash;listening with an air of the greatest attention to our
  former usher's lectures on the proper deportment to be assumed in the company
  to which he was taking us, and thanking him with the utmost gravity for his
  judicious hints and kind introduction to the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of Pera
  society.</p>

  <p>"Go home, Bold, go home." The old dog <i>would</i> accompany me out of the
  hotel, <i>would</i> persist in following close at my heel along the narrow
  street. Not a soul but our three selves seemed to be wandering about this
  beautiful starlight night. The Turkish sentry was sound asleep on his post; a
  dark figure, probably some houseless <i>hamaul</i>, crouched near the
  sentry-box. Savage Bold wanted to fly at it as he passed.</p>

  <p>"How cantankerous the old dog grows," remarked Ropsley, as Bold stalked
  behind us, ears erect, and bristling all over with defiance. Ere we were
  fifty yards from the hotel he stopped short and barked loudly; a footstep was
  rapidly approaching up the street. Murders and robberies were at this time so
  frequent in Constantinople, that every passenger was an object of mistrust in
  the dark. We, however, were three strong men, all armed, and had nothing to
  fear. Bold, too, seemed to recognise the step. In another moment the
  Beloochee overtakes us, and with even a more imperturbable air than usual
  salutes me gravely, and whispers a few words in my ear. On my reply, he
  places my hand against his forehead, and says, "The brothers of the sword are
  brothers indeed. Effendi, you know Ali Mesrour, the son of Abdul. From
  henceforth my life is at the disposal of my Frankish brother."</p>

  <p>A hurried consultation between the three Englishmen succeeds. Manners
  makes a great virtue of sacrificing sundry waltzes on which he seems to have
  set his heart, and is pathetic about the disappointment his absence will too
  surely inflict on Josephine, and Philippine, and Seraphine, but is amazingly
  keen and full of spirits notwithstanding. Ropsley, no longer the
  unimpressionable, apathetic dandy, whom nothing can excite or amuse, enters
  with zest into our project, and betrays a depth of feeling,&mdash;nay, a
  touch of romance&mdash;of which I had believed him incapable. Bold is ordered
  peremptorily to "go home," and obeys, though most unwillingly, stopping some
  twenty paces off, and growling furiously in the darkness. Two and two we
  thread the narrow streets that lead down to the water's edge. The Beloochee
  is very silent, as is his wont, but ever and anon draws his shawl tighter
  round his waist, and loosens his dagger in its sheath. It is evident that he
  means <i>real business</i>. Manners and Ropsley chat and laugh like boys out
  of school. The latter never seemed half so boyish as now; the former will be
  a boy all his life&mdash;so much the better for him. At the bridge Ali gives
  a low shrill whistle. It reminds me of the night we escaped from the Cossacks
  in Wallachia; but the good mare this time is safe in her stable, and little
  thinks of the errand on which her master is bound. The whistle is answered
  from the water, and a double-oared ca que, with its white-robed watermen,
  looms through the darkness to take us on board. As we glide silently up the
  Bosphorus, listening to the unearthly chorus of the baying wild-dogs
  answering each other from Pera to Stamboul, Manners produces a revolver from

  <h2><a id="ch35"
     name="ch35"></a>CHAPTER XXXV. &mdash; "THE WOLF AND THE LAMB."</h2>

  <p class="first">Papoosh Pasha is taking his <i>kief</i>[#] in his harem. Two
  softly shaded lamps, burning perfumed oil, shed a voluptuous light over the
  apartment. Rich carpets from the looms of Persia are spread upon the floor;
  costly shawls from Northern India fall in graceful folds over the low divan
  on which he reclines. Jewel-hilted sabres, silver-sheathed daggers, and
  firearms inlaid with gold, glitter above his head, disposed tastefully
  against the walls, and marking the warlike character of the owner; for
  Papoosh Pasha, cruel, sensual, and corrupt to the very marrow, is
  nevertheless as brave as a lion.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[#] Repose.</p>

  <p>Two <i>nautch-girls</i> belonging to his seraglio have been dancing their
  voluptuous measure for his gratification. As they stand now unveiled, panting
  and glowing with their exertions, the rich Eastern blood crimsoning their
  soft cheeks, and coursing wildly through their shapely, pliant limbs, the old
  man's face assumes a placid expression of content only belied by the gleam in
  that wicked eye, and he is good enough to wave his amber-tipped pipe-stick in
  token of dismissal, and to express his approbation by the single word
  "<i>Peki</i>" (very well). The girls prostrate themselves before their lord,
  their silver armlets and anklets ringing as they touch the floor, and
  bounding away like two young antelopes, flit from the presence, apparently
  not unwilling to escape so easily. Papoosh Pasha is left alone with the
  favourite; but the favourite looks restless and preoccupied, and glances ever
  and anon towards the casement which opens out into the garden of the
  seraglio, now beginning to glisten in the light of the rising moon, and
  breathing the odours of a thousand flowers, heavy and fragrant with the dews
  of night. This part of the harem is on the ground floor, and is a retreat
  much affected by his Highness for the facility with which the breeze steals
  into it from the Bosphorus.</p>

  <p>Zuleika is dressed in all the magnificence of her richest Oriental
  costume. Her tiny feet, arched in true Arabian symmetry, are bare to the
  ankle, where her voluminous muslin trousers are gathered in by a bracelet, or
  more correctly an anklet, set with rubies and emeralds. A string of beads of
  the purest lemon-coloured amber marks the outlines of her slender waist, and
  terminates a short, close-fitting jacket of pink satin, embroidered with
  seed-pearls, open at the bosom, and with long sleeves fringed by lace of
  European manufacture. This again is covered by a large loose mantle of
  <i>green</i> silk, carelessly thrown over the whole figure. Zuleika has not
  forgotten that she is lineally descended from the Prophet, and wears his
  colour accordingly. Her hands, in compliance with Eastern custom, are dyed
  with <i>henna</i>, but even this horrid practice cannot disguise the symmetry
  of her tapered fingers; and although the hair is cut short on her left
  temple, the long raven locks from the other side are gathered and plaited
  into a lustrous diadem around her brows. She has pencilled her lower
  eyelashes with some dark substance that enhances their natural beauty, but
  even this effort of the toilette has not succeeded in imparting the
  languishing expression which a Turkish beauty deems so irresistible. No; the
  gleam in Zuleika's eye is more that of some wild animal, caught but not tamed
  glancing eagerly around for a chance of escape, and ready to tear the hand
  that would caress it and endeavour to reconcile it to its fetters.</p>

  <p>She does not look as if she loved you, Papoosh Pasha, when you order her
  to your feet, and stroke her hair with your fat hand, and gloat on that
  mournful, eager face with your little twinkling eye. Better be a bachelor,
  Papoosh Pasha, and confine yourself to the solace of coffee and pipes, and
  busy your cunning intellect with those puzzling European politics, and look
  after the interests of your dissipated master the Sultan, than take a wild
  bird to your bosom that will never know you or care for you, or cease to pine
  and fret, and beat her breast against the bars of the cage in which you have
  shut her up.</p>

  <p>The old man sinks back upon his cushions with a sigh of corporeal
  contentment. His fat person is enveloped in a flowing shawl-gown, which
  admits of his breathing far more freely than does that miserable tight
  frock-coat he wore all day. He has gorged himself with an enormous meal,
  chiefly composed of fat substances, vegetables, and sweetmeats. He has had
  his tiny measure of hot strong coffee, and is puffing forth volumes of smoke
  from a long cherry-stick pipe. He bids Zuleika kneel at his feet and sing him
  to his rest. The girl glances eagerly towards the window, and seems to
  listen; she dare not move at once to the casement and look out, for her lord
  is mistrustful and suspicious, and woe to her if she excites his jealousy to
  such a pitch that she cannot lull it to sleep again. She would give him an
  opiate if she dared, or something stronger still, that should settle all
  accounts; but there is a dark story in the harem of a former
  favourite&mdash;a Circassian&mdash;who tried to strike the same path for
  freedom, and failed in the attempt. She has long slept peacefully some forty
  fathom deep in the sparkling Bosphorus, and the ca ques that take her former
  comrades to the Sweet-Waters glide along over her head without disturbing her
  repose. Since then, whenever Papoosh Pasha drinks in the women's apartment,
  he has the gallantry to insist on a lady pledging him first before he puts
  his own fat lips to the bowl.</p>

  <p>"Come hither, Zuleika, little dove," says the old man, drawing her towards
  him; "light of my eyes and pearl of my heart, come hither that I may lay my
  head on thy bosom, and sleep to the soft murmurings of thy gentle voice."</p>

  <p>The girl obeys, but glances once more uneasily towards the window, and
  takes her place with compressed lips, and cheeks as pale as death. A long
  Albanian dagger, the spoil of some lawless chief, hangs temptingly within
  arm's length. Another such caress as that, Papoosh Pasha, and who shall
  ensure you that she does not bury it in your heart!</p>

  <p>But a more feminine weapon is in her hand&mdash;a three-stringed lute or
  gittern, incapable of producing much harmony, but nevertheless affording a
  plaintive and not inappropriate accompaniment to the measured chant with
  which the reigning Odalisque lulls her master to his rest. The tones of her
  voice are very wild and sad. Ever and anon she stops in her music and listens
  to the breathing of the Pasha; so surely he opens his eyes, and raising his
  head from her lap bids her go on,&mdash;not angrily nor petulantly, but with
  a quiet overbearing malice that irritates the free spirit of the girl to the
  quick. She strikes the gittern with no unskilful hand; and although her voice
  is mournful, it is sweet and musical as she sings; but the glance of her eye
  denotes mischief, and I had rather be sleeping over a powder magazine with my
  lighted chibouque in my mouth, than pillow my head, as you are doing, Papoosh
  Pasha, on the lap of a woman maddened by tyranny and imprisonment,&mdash;her
  whole being filled with but two feelings&mdash;Love stronger than death;
  Hatred fiercer than hell. And this is the caged bird's song:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Down in the valley where the Sweet-Waters meet&mdash;where the
  Sweet-Waters meet under the chestnut trees,&mdash;</p>

  <p>There Hamed had a garden; and the wild bird sang to the Rose.</p>

  <p>In the garden were many flowers, and the pomegranate grew in the midst.
  Fair and stately she grew, and the fruit from her branches dropped like dew
  upon the sward.</p>

  <p>And Hamed watered the tree and pruned her, and lay down in the cool
  freshness of her shade.</p>

  <p>Beautiful was the pomegranate, yet the wild bird sang to the Rose.</p>

  <p>The Lily bent lowly to the earth, and drooped for very shame, because the
  breeze courted the Lily and kissed her as he swept by to meet the
  Sweet-Waters under the chestnut trees.</p>

  <p>For the Lily was the fairest of flowers; yet the wild bird sang to the
  Rose.</p>

  <p>Then there came a blast from the desert, and the garden of Hamed was
  scorched and withered up;</p>

  <p>And the pomegranate sickened and died; and Hamed cut her down by the
  roots, and sowed corn over the place of her shade.</p>

  <p>And the breeze swept on, and stayed not, though the Lily lay trampled into
  the earth.</p>

  <p>Every flower sickened and died; yet the wild bird sang to the Rose.</p>

  <p>In the dawn of early morning, when the sky is green with longing, and the
  day is at hand,</p>

  <p>When the winds are hushed, and the waters sleep smiling, and the stars are
  dim in the sky:</p>

  <p>When she pines for his coming, and spreads her petals to meet him, and
  droops to hear his note;</p>

  <p>When the garden gate is open, and the watchers are asleep, and the last,
  <i>last</i> hope is dying,&mdash;will the wild bird come to the Rose?</p>

  <p>The concluding lines she sang in a marked voice there was no mistaking,
  and I doubt if they did not thrill to the heart's core of more than one
  listener.</p>

  <p>The moon had now fairly risen, and silvered the trees and shrubs in the
  harem garden with her light, leaving, however, dense masses of shade athwart
  the smooth lawn and under the walls of the building. Cypress and cedar
  quivered in her beams. Not a breath of air stirred the feathery leaves of the
  tall acacia, with its glistening stem; and the swelling ripple of the
  Bosphorus plashed drowsily against the marble steps. All was peace and
  silence and repose. Far enough off to elude observation, yet within hail, lay
  our ca que, poised buoyantly on the waters, and cutting with its dark outline
  right athwart a glittering pathway as of molten gold. Close under the harem
  window, concealed by the thick foliage of a broad-leaved creeper, Ali Mesrour
  and myself crouched, silent and anxious, scarce daring to breathe, counting
  with sickening eagerness the precious moments that were fleeting by, so
  tedious yet so soon past. Twenty paces farther off, under a dark group of
  cypresses, lay Ropsley and Manners ready for action, the latter with his hand
  in his bosom caressing the trusty revolver by which he set such store.</p>

  <p>Everything had as yet gone off prosperously. We had landed noiseless and
  unobserved. The garden gate, thanks to woman's foresight and woman's cunning,
  had been left open. The sentry on guard, like all other Turkish sentries when
  not before an enemy, had lain down, enveloped in his great-coat, with his
  musket by his side, and was snoring as only a true son of Osman can snore
  after a bellyful of <i>pilaff</i>. If his lord would but follow his example,
  it might be done; yet never was old man so restless, so ill at ease, so
  wakefully disposed as seemed Papoosh Pasha.</p>

  <p>We could see right into the apartment, and the rich soft lamplight brought
  out in full relief the faces and figures of its two occupants. Zuleika sat
  with her feet gathered under her on the divan: one hand still held the lute;
  the other was unwillingly consigned to the caresses of her lord. The old
  man's head reclined against her bosom; his parted lips betokened rest and
  enjoyment; his eyes were half closed, yet there was a gleam of vigilant
  malice upon his features that denoted anything but sleep. The poor girl's
  face alternated from a scowl of withering hatred to a plaintive expression of
  heart-broken disappointment. Doubtless she was thinking "the last,
  <i>last</i> hope is dying, and the wild bird is not coming to the rose."</p>

  <p>Ali Mesrour gazed on her he loved. If ever there was a trying situation,
  it was his&mdash;to see her even now in the very embrace of his
  enemy&mdash;so near, yet so apart. Few men could have enough preserved their
  self-command not to betray even by the workings of the countenance what a
  storm of feelings must be wasting the heart; yet the Beloochee moved not a
  muscle; his profile, turned towards me, was calm and grim as that of a
  statue. Once only the right hand crept stealthily towards his dagger, but the
  next moment he was again as still as death. The Pasha whispered something in
  the girl's ear, and a gleam of wild delight sparkled on her face as she
  listened. She rose cheerfully, left the room with a rapid, springing step,
  and returned almost immediately with a flask under her arm, and a huge goblet
  set with precious stones in her hand. Papoosh Pasha, true believer and
  faithful servant of the Prophet, it needs not the aid of a metal-covered
  cork, secured with wire, to enable us to guess at the contents of that
  Frankish flask. No sherbet of roses is poured into your brimming
  goblet&mdash;no harmless, unfermented liquor, flavoured with cinnamon or
  other lawful condiment; but the creaming flood of amber-coloured champagne
  whirls up to the very margin, and the Pasha's eye brightens with satisfaction
  as he stretches forth his hand to grasp its taper stem. Cunning and careful
  though, even in his debauches, he proffers the cup to Zuleika ere he
  tastes.</p>

  <p>"Drink, my child," says the old hypocrite, "drink of the liquid such as
  the houris are keeping in Paradise for the souls of the true believers; drink
  and fear not&mdash;it is lawful. <i>Allah Kerim</i>!"</p>

  <p>Zuleika wets her lips on the edge, and hands the cup to her lord, who
  drains it to the dregs, and sets it down with a sigh of intense
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"It is lawful," he continues, wiping his moustaches. "It is not forbidden
  by the blessed Prophet. Wine indeed is prohibited to the true believer, but
  the Prophet knew not the flavour of champagne, and had he tasted it, he would
  have enjoined his servants to drink it four times a day. Fill again, Zuleika,
  oh my soul! Fill again! There is but one Allah!"</p>

  <p>The girl needs no second bidding; once and again she fills to the brim;
  once and again the Pasha drains the tempting draught; and now the little
  twinkling eye dims, the cherry-stick falls from the opening fingers, the
  Pasha's head sinks upon Zuleika's bosom, and at last he is fast asleep.
  Gently, tenderly, like a mother soothing a child, she hushes him to his rest.
  Stealthily, slowly she transfers his head from her own breast to the
  embroidered cushions. Dexterously, noiselessly, see extricates herself from
  his embrace. A low whistle, scarcely perceptible, reaches her ear from the
  garden, and calls the blood into her cheek; and yet, a very woman even now,
  she turns to take one last look at him whom she is leaving for ever. A cool
  air steals in from the window, and plays upon the sleeper's open neck and
  throat. She draws a shawl carefully, nay, caressingly, around him. Brute,
  tyrant, enemy though he is, yet there have been moments when he was kindly
  and indulgent towards her, for she was his favourite; and she will not leave
  him in anger at the last. Fatal delay! mistaken tenderness! true woman!
  always influenced by her feelings at the wrong time! What did that moment's
  weakness cost us all? She had crossed the room&mdash;we were ready to receive
  her&mdash;her foot was on the very window-sill; another moment and she would
  have been in Ali's arms, when a footstep was heard rapidly approaching up the
  street, a black figure came bounding over the garden wall, closely followed
  by a large English retriever, and shouting an alarm wildly at the top of his
  voice. As the confused sentry fired off his musket in the air; as the Pasha's
  guards and retainers woke and sprang to their arms; as the Beloochee glared
  wildly around him; as Ropsley, no longer uninterested, swore volubly in
  English, and Manners drew the revolver from his bosom, Bold, for the second
  time that day, pinned a tall negro slave by the throat, and rolling him over
  and over on the sward, made as though he would have worried him to death in
  the garden.</p>

  <p>It was, however, too late; the alarm was given, and all was discovered.
  The man I had struck in the afternoon of that very day had dogged me ever
  since, in hopes of an opportunity to revenge himself. He had followed me from
  place to place, overheard my conversation, and watched all those to whom I
  spoke. He had crouched under the sentry-box at the door of Messirie's hotel,
  had tracked us at a safe distance down to the very water's edge, and had seen
  us embark on our mysterious expedition. With the cunning of his race, he
  guessed at once at our object, and determined to frustrate it. Unable, I
  conclude, at that late hour to get a ca que, he had hastened by land to his
  master's house, and, as the event turned out, had arrived in time to
  overthrow all our plans. He was followed in his turn by my faithful Bold,
  who, when so peremptorily ordered to leave us, had been convinced there was
  something in the wind, and accordingly transferred his attentions to the
  figure that had been his object of distrust the live-long day. How he worried
  and tore at him, and refused to relinquish his hold. Alas! alas! it was too
  late&mdash;too late!</p>

  <p>The Pasha sprang like a lion from his lair. At the same instant, Ali
  Mesrour and myself bounded lightly through the open window into the
  apartment. Zuleika flung herself with a loud shriek into her lover's arms.
  Manners and Ropsley came crowding in behind us, the former's revolver
  gleaming ominously in the light. The Pasha was surrounded by his enemies, but
  he never faltered for an instant. Hurrying feet and the clash of arms
  resounded along the passages; lights were already twinkling in the garden;
  aid was at hand, and, Turk, tyrant, voluptuary though he was, he lacked not
  the courage, the promptitude which aids itself. At a glance he must have
  recognised Ali; or it might have been but the instinct of his nation which
  bid him defend his women. Quick as thought, he seized a pistol that hung
  above his couch, and discharged it point-blank at the Beloochee's body. The
  bullet sped past Zuleika's head and lodged deep in her lover's bosom. At the
  same instant that Ropsley, always cool and collected in an emergency, dashed
  down both the lamps, Ali's body lurched heavily into my arms, and poor
  Zuleika fell senseless on the floor.</p>

  <p>The next moment a glare of light filled the apartment. Crowds of slaves,
  black and white, all armed to the teeth, rushed in to the rescue. The Pasha,
  perfectly composed, ordered them to seize and make us prisoners. Encumbered
  by the Beloochee's weight, and outnumbered ten to one, we were put to it to
  make good our retreat, and ere we could close round her and carry her off,
  two stout negroes had borne the still senseless Zuleika through the open
  doorway into the inner chambers of the palace. Placing the Beloochee between
  myself and Ropsley, we backed leisurely into the garden, the poor fellow
  groaning heavily as we handed him through the casement, and so made our way,
  still fronting the Pasha and his myrmidons, towards our ca que, which at the
  first signal of disturbance had been pulled rapidly in shore. Manners covered
  our retreat with great steadiness and gallantry, keeping the enemy at bay
  with his revolver, a weapon with which one and all showed much disinclination
  to make further acquaintance. By this time shrieks of women pervaded the
  palace. The blacks, too, jabbered and gesticulated with considerably more
  energy than purpose, half-a-dozen pistol shots fired at random served to
  increase the general confusion, which even their lord's presence and
  authority were completely powerless to quell, and thus we were enabled to
  reach our boat, and shove off with our ghastly freight into the comparative
  safety of the Bosphorus.</p>

  <p>"He will never want a doctor more," said Ropsley, in answer to an
  observation from Manners, as, turning down the edge of the Beloochee's
  jacket, he showed us the round livid mark that, to a practised eye, told too
  surely of the irremediable death-wound. "Poor fellow, poor fellow," he added,
  "he is bleeding inwardly now, he will be dead before we reach the
  bridge."</p>

  <p>Ali opened his eyes, and raising his head, looked around as though in
  search of some missing face.</p>

  <p>"Zuleika," he whispered, "Zuleika!" and sank back again with a piteous
  expression of hopeless, helpless misery on his wan and ghastly features. The
  end was obviously near at hand, his cheeks seemed to have fallen in the last
  few minutes, dark circles gathered round his eyes, his forehead was damp and
  clammy, and there was a light froth upon his ashy lips. Yet as death
  approached he seemed to recover strength and consciousness; a true Mussulman,
  the grave had for him but few terrors, and he had confronted the grim monarch
  so often as not to wince from him at last when really within his grasp.</p>

  <p>He reared himself in the boat, and supported by my arm, which was wound
  round his body, made shift to sit upright and look about him, wildly,
  dreamily, as one who looks for the last time. "Effendi," he gasped, pressing
  my hand, "Effendi, it is destiny. The good mare&mdash;she is my brother's!
  Oh, Zuleika! Zuleika!"</p>

  <p>A strong shudder convulsed his frame, his jaw dropped, I thought he was
  gone, but he recovered consciousness once more, snatched wildly at his sword,
  which he half drew, and whispering faintly, "Turn me to the East! There is
  but one Allah!" his limbs collapsed&mdash;his head sunk upon my
  shoulder&mdash;and so he died.</p>

  <p>Row gently, brawny watermen, though your freight is indeed but the shell
  which contained even now a gallant, faithful spirit. One short hour ago, who
  so determined, so brave, so sagacious as the Beloochee warrior? and where is
  he now? That is not Ali Mesrour whom you are wafting so sadly, so smoothly
  towards the shore. Ali Mesrour is far away in space, in the material Paradise
  of your own creed, with its inexhaustible sherbets, and its cool gardens, and
  its dark-eyed maidens waving their green scarfs to greet the long-expected
  lover; or to the unknown region, the shadowy spirit-land of a loftier, nobler
  faith, the mystical world on which Religion herself dare hardly speculate,
  where "the tree shall be known by its fruits," "where the wicked cease from
  troubling, and the weary are at rest."</p>

  <p>So we carried him reverently and mournfully to the house he had occupied;
  and we laid him out in his warrior dress, with his arms by his side and his
  lance in his hand, and ere the morrow's sun was midway in the heavens, the
  earth had closed over him in his last resting-place, where the dark cypresses
  are nodding and whispering over his tomb, and the breeze steals gently up
  from the golden Bosphorus, smiling and radiant, within a hundred paces of his
  grave.</p>

  <p>The good bay mare has never left my possession. For months she was
  restless and uncomfortable, neighing at every strange step, and refusing her
  food, as if she pined truly and faithfully for her master. He came not, and
  after a time she forgot him; and another hand fed and cared for her, and she
  grew sleek and fat and light-hearted. What would you? It is a world of
  change. Men and women, friends and favourites, lovers and beloved, all must
  forget and float with the stream and hurry on; if there be an
  exception&mdash;if some pale-eyed mourner, clinging to the bank, yearns
  hopelessly for the irrevocable Past, what matter, so the stream can eddy
  round him, and laugh and ripple by? Let him alone! he is not one of us. God
  forbid!</p>

  <p>Of Zuleika's fate I shudder to think. Though I might well guess she could
  never expect to be forgiven, it was long before surmise approached certainty,
  and even now I strive to hope against hope, to persuade myself that there may
  still be a chance. At least I am thankful Ali was spared the ghastly tidings
  that eventually came to my ears&mdash;a tale that escaped the lips of a
  drunken ca gee, and in which I fear there is too much truth.</p>

  <p>Of course the attack on the Pasha's palace created much scandal throughout
  Constantinople; and equally of course, a thousand rumours gained credence as
  to the origin and object of the disturbance. The English officers concerned
  received a hint that it would be advisable to get out of the way as speedily
  as possible; and I was compelled to absent myself for a time from my kind
  friend and patron, Omar Pasha. One person set the whole thing down as a
  drunken frolic; another voted it an attempt at burglary of the most
  ruffian-like description; and the Turks themselves seemed inclined to resent
  it as a gratuitous insult to their prejudices and customs. A stalwart ca gee,
  however, being, contrary to his religion and his practice, inebriated with
  strong drink, let out in his cups that, if he dared, he could tell more than
  others knew about the attack on the palace of Papoosh Pasha, and its sequel.
  Influenced by a large bribe, and intimidated by threats, he at length made
  the following statement:&mdash;"That the evening after the attack, about
  sun-down, he was plying off the steps of Papoosh Pasha's palace; that he was
  hailed by a negro guard, who bade him approach the landing-place; that two
  other negroes then appeared, bearing between them a sack, carefully secured,
  and obviously containing something weighty; that they placed it carefully in
  the bottom of his ca que, and that more than once he distinctly saw it move;
  that they desired him to pull out into mid-stream, and when there, dropped
  the sack overboard; that it sunk immediately, but that he fancied he heard a
  faint shriek as it went down, and saw the bubbles plainly coming up for
  several seconds at the place where it disappeared; further, that the negro
  gave him fifty piastres over his proper fare for the job, and that he himself
  had been uncomfortable and troubled with bad dreams ever since."</p>

  <p>Alas, poor Zuleika! there is but little hope that you survived your lover
  four-and-twenty hours. The wild bird came, indeed, as he had promised, in the
  early morning, to the rose, but the wild bird got his death-wound; and the
  rose, I fear, lies many a fathom deep in the clear, cold waters of the silent
  Bosphorus.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch36"
     name="ch36"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI. &mdash; "THE FRONT"</h2>

  <p class="first">Man has been variously defined by philosophers as a cooking
  animal (the truth of this definition, unless when applied to our Gallic
  neighbours, I stoutly contest), as a reasoning animal (this likewise will
  hardly hold water), as a self-clothing animal, as an omnivorous one, as an
  unfeathered biped, and as an improved specimen of the order of Simiae without
  the tail! None of these definitions will I accept as expressing exactly the
  conditions and necessities of our species. I believe man to be an animal fed
  on excitement&mdash;the only one in creation that without that pabulum, in
  some shape or another, languishes, becomes torpid, and loses its noblest
  energies both of mind and body. Why do men drink, quarrel, gamble, and waste
  their substance in riotous living? Why does Satan, according to good Dr.
  Watts, always provide work "for idle hands to do"? Why, but because man
  <i>must</i> have excitement. If he have no safety-valve for his surplus
  energies in the labour which earns his daily bread, they will find vent
  through some other channel, either for good or evil, according to his bias
  one way or the other. There is no such thing as repose on the face of the
  earth; "push on&mdash;keep moving," such is the motto of humanity. If we are
  not making we must be marring, but we cannot sit still. How else do we
  account for the proverbial restlessness of the sailor when he has been a few
  weeks ashore? How else can we conceive it possible for a rational being,
  whilst enjoying the luxuries and liberty of a landsman's existence, to pine
  for the hardships, the restraint, the utter discomfort which every one must
  necessarily experience on board ship? How, except upon this principle, can we
  understand the charm of a soldier's life, the cheering influence of a
  campaign? It is most unnatural to like rigid discipline, short rations,
  constant anxiety, and unremitting toil. A wet great-coat on the damp earth is
  a bad substitute for a four-post bed, with thick blankets, and clean sheets
  not innocent of the warming-pan. A tent is a miserable dwelling-place at the
  best of times, and is only just preferable to the canopy of heaven in very
  hot or very cold, or very windy or very wet weather. There is small amusement
  in spending the livelong night in sleepless watching for an enemy, and little
  satisfaction in being surprised by the same about an hour before dawn. It is
  annoying to be starved, it is irritating to be frightened, it is
  uncomfortable to be shot,&mdash;yet are all these casualties more or less
  incidental to the profession of arms; and still the recruiting sergeant
  flaunts his bunch of ribbons in every market town throughout merry England,
  and still the bumpkin takes the shilling, and sings in beery strains, "Huzza
  for the life of a soldier!"</p>

  <p>And I too had tasted of the fierce excitement of strife&mdash;had drunk of
  the stimulating draught which, like some bitter tonic, creates a constant
  craving for more&mdash;had been taught by the influence of custom and
  companionship to loathe the quiet dreamy existence which was my normal state,
  and to long for the thrill of danger, the variety and unholy revelry of
  war.</p>

  <p>So I returned with Ropsley to the Crimea. I had small difficulty in
  obtaining leave from Omar Pasha to resign, at least for a time, my
  appointment on his personal staff.</p>

  <p>"They are queer fellows, my adopted countrymen," said his Highness, in his
  dry, humorous manner, and with his quaint smile, "and the sooner you get out
  of the way, friend Egerton, the better. I shall be asked all sorts of
  questions about you myself; and if you stay here, why, the nights are dark
  and the streets are narrow. Some fine morning it might be difficult to wake
  you, and nobody would be a bit the wiser. Our Turk has his peculiar notions
  about the laws of honour, and he cannot be made to comprehend why he should
  risk his own life in taking yours. Besides, he is ridiculously sensitive
  about his women, particularly with a Christian. Had you been a good
  Mussulman, now, Egerton, it could have been easily arranged. You might have
  bought the lady, got drunk on champagne with old Papoosh Pasha, and set up a
  harem of your own. Why don't you become a convert, as I did? The process is
  short, the faith simple, the practice satisfactory. Think it over, my good
  Interpreter, think it over. Bah! in ten minutes you would be as good a
  Mussulman as I am, and better." And his Highness laughed, and bid me
  "Good-bye," for he had a good deal upon his hands just then, being on the eve
  of marriage with his <i>fifth</i> wife, a young lady twelve years of age,
  daughter to his Imperial Majesty the Sultan, and bringing her husband a
  magnificent dowry of jewels, gold, and horses, in addition to many broad and
  fertile acres in Anatolia, not to mention a beautiful kiosk near Scutari and
  a stately palace on the Bosphorus, without which adventitious advantages she
  might perhaps have hardly succeeded in winning the heart of so experienced a
  warrior as Omar Pasha.</p>

  <p>Thus it was that I found myself one broiling sunny morning leaning over
  the side of a transport, just then dropping her anchor in Balaklava Bay.</p>

  <p>The scorching rocks frowned down on the scorching sea; the very planks on
  the deck glistened with the heat. There was no shade on land, and not a
  breath of air ruffled the shining bosom of the water. The harbour was full,
  ay, choked with craft of every rig and every tonnage; whilst long,
  wicked-looking steamers and huge, unwieldy troop-ships dotted the surface of
  the land-locked bay. The union-jack trailed idly over our stern, the men were
  all on deck, gazing with eager faces on that shore which combined for
  <i>them</i> the realities of history with the fascinations of romance. Young
  soldiers were they, mostly striplings of eighteen and twenty summers, with
  the smooth cheeks, fresh colour, and stalwart limbs of the Anglo-Saxon
  race&mdash;too good to fill a trench! And yet what would be the fate of at
  least two-thirds of that keen, light-hearted draft? <i>Vestigia nulla
  retrorsum</i>. Many a time has it made my heart ache to see a troop-ship
  ploughing relentlessly onward with her living freight to "the
  front,"&mdash;many a time have I recalled Aesop's fable, and the foot-prints
  that were all <i>towards</i> the lion's den,&mdash;many a time have I thought
  how every unit there in red was himself the centre of a little world at home;
  and of the grey heads that would tremble, and the loving faces that would
  pale in peaceful villages far away in England, when no news came from foreign
  parts of "our John," or when the unrelenting <i>Gazette</i> arrived at last
  and proclaimed, as too surely it would, that he was coming back "never, never
  no more."</p>

  <p>Boom!&mdash;there it is again! Every eye lightens at that dull, distant
  sound. Every man's pulse beats quicker, and his head towers more erect, for
  he feels that he has arrived at the <i>real thing</i> at last. No sham
  fighting is going on over yonder, not two short leagues from where he
  stands&mdash;no mock bivouac at Chobham, nor practice in Woolwich Marshes,
  nor meaningless pageant in the Park: that iron voice carries <i>death</i>
  upon its every accent. For those in the trenches it is a mere echo&mdash;the
  unregarded consequence that necessarily succeeds the fierce rush of a
  round-shot or the wicked whistle of a shell; but for us here at Balaklava it
  is one of the pulsations of England's life-blood&mdash;one of the ticks, so
  to speak, of that great Clock of Doom which points ominously to the downfall
  of the beleaguered town.</p>

  <p>Boom! Yes, there it is again; you cannot forget why you are here. Day and
  night, sunshine and storm, scarce five minutes elapse in the twenty-four
  hours without reminding you of the work in hand. You ride out from the camp
  for your afternoon exercise, you go down to Balaklava to buy provisions, or
  you canter over to the monastery at St. George's to visit a sick
  comrade&mdash;the iron voice tolls on. In the glare of noon, when everything
  else seems drowsy in the heat, and the men lie down exhausted in the
  suffocating trenches&mdash;the iron voice tolls on. In the calm of evening,
  when the breeze is hushed and still, and the violet sea is sleeping in the
  twilight&mdash;the iron voice tolls on. So when the flowers are opening in
  the morning, and the birds begin to sing, and reviving nature, fresh and
  dewy, seems to scatter health and peace and good-will over the
  earth&mdash;the iron voice tolls on. Nay, when you wake at midnight in your
  tent from a dream of your far-away home&mdash;oh! what a different scene to
  this!&mdash;tired as you may be, ere you have turned to sleep once more, you
  hear it again. Yes, at midnight as at noon, at morn as at evening, every day
  and all day long, Death is gathering his harvest&mdash;and the iron voice
  tolls on.</p>

  <p>"Very slack fire they seem to be keeping up in the front," yawns out
  Ropsley, who has just joined me on deck, and to whom the siege and all its
  accessories are indeed nothing new. Many a long and weary month has he been
  listening to that sound; and what with his own ideas on the subject, and the
  information a naturally acute intellect has acquired touching the proceedings
  of the besiegers, his is indeed a familiarity which "breeds contempt."</p>

  <p>"Any news from the camp?" he shouts out to a middy in a man-of-war's boat
  passing under our stern. The middy, a thorough specimen of an English boy,
  with his round laughing face and short jacket, stands up to reply.</p>

  <p>"Another sortie! No end of fellows killed; and <i>they say</i> the
  Malakhoff is blown up."</p>

  <p>Our young soldiers listen eagerly to the news. They have heard and read of
  the Malakhoff for many a day, and though their ideas of the nature and
  appearance of that work are probably of a somewhat confused description, they
  are all athirst for intelligence, and prepared to swallow everything
  connected with the destruction of that or any other of the defences with a
  faith that is, to say the least of it, a sad temptation to the
  laughter-loving informant.</p>

  <p>A middy, though from some organic cause of which I am ignorant, is always
  restless and impatient towards the hour of noon; and our friend plumps down
  once more in the stern of his gig, and bids his men "give way"; for the sun
  is by this time high in the heavens; so we take our places in the ship's boat
  which our own captain politely provides for us, and avoiding the confusion of
  a disembarkation of men and stores, Ropsley, Bold, and I leap ashore at
  Balaklava, unencumbered save by the slender allowance of luggage which a
  campaign teaches the most luxurious to deem sufficient.</p>

  <p>Ashore at Balaklava! What a scene of hurry and crowding and general
  confusion it is! Were it not that every second individual is in uniform and
  bearded to the waist, it would appear more like the mart of some peaceful and
  commercial sea-port, than the threshold of a stage on which is being fought
  out to the death one of the fiercest and most obstinate struggles which
  History has to record on her blood-stained pages. There are no women, yet the
  din of tongues is perfectly deafening. Hurrying to and fro, doing as little
  work with as much labour as possible, making immense haste with small speed,
  and vociferating incessantly at the top of their voices, Turks and Tartars,
  Armenians, Greeks, and Ionians, all accosted by the burly English soldier
  under the generic name of "Johnny," are flitting aimlessly about, and wasting
  her Majesty's stores in a manner that would have driven the late Mr. Hume
  frantic. Here a trim sergeant of infantry, clean and orderly, despite his
  war-worn looks and patched garments, drives before him a couple of swarthy
  nondescripts, clad in frieze, and with wild elf-locks protruding over their
  jutting foreheads, and twinkling Tartar eyes. They stagger under huge sacks
  of meal, which they are carrying to yonder storehouse, with a sentry pacing
  his short walk at the door. The sacks have been furnished by contract, so the
  seams are badly sewn; and the meal, likewise furnished by contract, and of
  inferior quality, is rapidly escaping, to leave a white track in the mud,
  also a contract article, and of the deepest, stickiest, and most enduring
  quality. The labours of the two porters will be much lightened ere they reach
  their destination; but this is of less moment, inasmuch as the storehouse to
  which they are proceeding is by no means watertight, and the first
  thunderstorm that sweeps in from the Black Sea is likely much to damage its
  contents. It is needless to add that this edifice of thin deal planks has
  been constructed by contract for the use of her Majesty's Government.</p>

  <p>A little farther on, a train of mules, guided by a motley crowd of every
  nation under heaven, and commanded by an officer in the workmanlike uniform
  of the Land Transport, is winding slowly up the hill. They have emerged from
  a perfect sea of mud, which even at this dry season shows not the least
  tendency to harden into consistency, and they will probably arrive at the
  front in about four hours, with the loss of a third only of their cargo,
  consisting of sundry munitions which were indispensable last week, and might
  have been of service the day before yesterday, but the occasion for which has
  now passed away for ever.</p>

  <p>A staff officer on a short sturdy pony gallops hastily by, exchanging a
  nod as he passes with a beardless cornet of dragoons, whose English charger
  presents a curious study of the anatomy of a horse. He pulls up for an
  instant to speak to Ropsley, and the latter turns to me and says&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Not so bad as I feared, Vere. It was a mere sortie, after all, and we
  drove them back very handsomely, with small loss on our side. The only
  officer killed was young &mdash;, and he was dying, poor fellow! at any rate,
  of dysentery."</p>

  <p>This is the news of the day here, and the trenches form just such a
  subject of conversation before Sebastopol as does the weather in a
  country-house in England&mdash;a topic never new, but never entirely worn
  out.</p>

  <p>Side by side, Ropsley and myself are journeying up the hill towards the
  front. A sturdy batman has been in daily expectation of his master's return,
  and has brought his horses down to meet him. It is indeed a comfort to be
  again in an English saddle&mdash;to have the lengthy, powerful frame of an
  English horse under one&mdash;and to hear the homely, honest accents of a
  <i>provincial</i> English tongue. When a man has been long amongst
  foreigners, and especially serving with foreign troops, it is like being at
  home again to be once more within the lines of a British army; and to add to
  the pleasure of our ride, although the day is cloudless and insufferably hot
  in the valleys, there is a fresh breeze up here, and a pure bracing air that
  reaches us from the heights on which the army is encamped.</p>

  <p>It is a wild, picturesque scene, not beautiful, yet full of interest and
  incident. Behind us lies Balaklava, with its thronging harbour and its busy
  crowds, whose hum reaches us even here, high above the din. It is like
  looking down on an ant-hill to watch the movements of the shifting swarm.</p>

  <p>On our right, the plain, stretching far and wide, is dotted with the Land
  Transport&mdash;that necessary evil so essential to the very existence of an
  army; and their clustering wagons and scattered beasts carry the eye onwards
  to a dim white line formed by the neat tents and orderly encampment of the
  flower of French cavalry, the gallant and dashing Chasseurs d'Afrique.</p>

  <p>On our left, the stable call of an English regiment of Light Dragoons
  reaches us from the valley of Kadikoi, that Crimean Newmarket, the doings of
  which are actually chronicled in <i>Bell's Life</i>! Certainly an
  Englishman's nationality is not to be rooted out of him even in the jaws of
  death. But we have little time to visit the race-course or the lines&mdash;to
  pass our comments on the condition of the troopers, or gaze open-mouthed at
  the wondrous field-batteries that occupy an adjoining encampment&mdash;moved
  by teams of twelve horses each, perhaps the finest animals of the class to be
  seen in Europe, with every accessory of carriage, harness, and appointments,
  so perfect as not to admit of improvement, yet, I believe, not found to
  answer in actual warfare. Our interest is more awakened by another scene. We
  are on classic ground now, for we have reached the spot whence</p>

  <p class="verse">Into the valley of death<br>
  Rode the six hundred!</p>

  <p>Yes, stretching down from our very feet lies that mile-and-a-half gallop
  which witnessed the boldest deed of chivalry performed in ancient or modern
  times. Well might the French general exclaim, "<i>C'est magnifique!</i>"
  although he added, significantly, "<i>mais ce n'est pas la guerre.</i>" The
  latter part of his observation is a subject for discussion, but of the former
  there is and there can be but one opinion. <i>Magnifique</i> indeed it must
  have been to see six hundred horsemen ride gallantly down to almost certain
  death&mdash;every heart beating equally high, every sword striking equally
  hard and true.</p>

  <p class="verse">Groom fought like noble, squire like knight,<br>
  As fearlessly and well.</p>

  <p>Not a child in England at this day but knows, as if he had been there, the
  immortal battle of Balaklava. It is needless to describe its situation, to
  dwell upon the position they were ordered to carry, or the fire that poured
  in upon front, flanks, ay, and rear, of the attacking force. This is all
  matter of history; but as the valley stretched beneath us, fresh, green, and
  smiling peacefully in the sun, it required but little imagination to call up
  the stirring scene of which it had been the stage. Here was the very ground
  on which the Light Brigade were drawn up; every charger quivering with
  excitement, every eye flashing, every lip compressed with the sense of coming
  danger. A staff officer rides up to the leader, and communicates an order.
  There is an instant's pause. Question and reply pass like lightning, and the
  aide-de-camp points to a dark, grim mass of artillery bristling far away down
  yonder in the front. Men's hearts stop beating, and many a bold cheek turns
  pale, for there is more excitement in uncertainty than in actual danger. The
  leader draws his sword, and faces flush, and hearts beat high once more.
  Clear and sonorous is his voice as he gives the well-known word; gallant and
  chivalrous his bearing as he takes his place&mdash;that place of
  privilege&mdash;<i>in front</i>&mdash;"<i>Noblesse oblige</i>" and can he be
  otherwise than gallant and chivalrous and devoted, for is he not a
  <i>gentleman?</i> and yet, to the honour of our countrymen be it spoken, not
  a man of that six hundred, of any rank, but was as gallant and chivalrous and
  devoted as he&mdash;he has said so himself a hundred times.</p>

  <p>So the word is given, and the squadron leaders take it up, and the Light
  Brigade advances at a gallop; and a deadly grasp is on the sword, and the
  charger feels his rider's energy as he grips him with his knees, and holding
  him hard by the head urges him resolutely forward&mdash;to death!</p>

  <p>And now they cross the line of fire: shot through the heart, an
  aide-de-camp falls headlong from the saddle, and his loose horse gallops on,
  wild and masterless, and wheels in upon the flank, and joins the squadron
  once more. It has begun now. Man upon man, horse upon horse, are shot down
  and rolled over; yet the survivors close in, sterner, bolder, fiercer than
  before, and still the death-ride sweeps on.</p>

  <p>"Steady, men&mdash;forward!" shouts a chivalrous squadron leader, as he
  waves his glittering sword above his head, and points towards the foe. Clear
  and cheerful rings his voice above the tramp of horses and the rattle of
  small-arms and the deadly roar of artillery. He is a model of beauty, youth,
  and gallantry&mdash;the admired of men, the darling of women, the hope of his
  house.&mdash;Do not look again.&mdash;A round-shot has taken man and horse;
  he is lying rolled up with his charger, a confused and ghastly mass. Forward!
  the squadron has passed over him, and still the death-ride sweeps on.</p>

  <p>The gaps are awful now, the men told off by threes look in vain for the
  familiar face at right or left; every trooper feels that he must depend on
  himself and the good horse under him, but there is no wavering. Officers
  begin to have misgivings as to the result, but there is no hesitation. All
  know they are galloping to destruction, yet not a heart fails, not a rein is
  turned. Few, very few are they by this time, and still the death-ride sweeps
  on. They disappear in that rolling sulphurous cloud, the portal of another
  world; begrimed with smoke, ghastly with wounds, comrade cannot recognise
  comrade, and officers look wildly round for their men; but the guns are still
  before them&mdash;the object is not yet attained&mdash;the enemy awaits them
  steadily behind his gabions, and the fire from his batteries is mowing them
  down like grass. If but one man is left, that one will still press forward:
  and now they are on their prey. A tremendous roar of artillery shakes the
  air. Mingled with the clash of swords and the plunge of horses, oath, prayer,
  and death-shriek fly to heaven. The batteries are reached and carried. The
  death-ride sweeps over them, and it is time to return.</p>

    <p class="caption">"The batteries are reached and carried."</p>
  </div>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">In twos, and threes, and single files, the few survivors
  stagger back to the ground, from whence, a few short minutes ago, a gallant
  band had advanced in so trim, so orderly, so soldier-like a line.</p>

  <p>The object has been attained, but at what a sacrifice? Look at yon
  stalwart trooper sinking on his saddle-bow, sick with his death-hurt, his
  head drooping on his bosom, his sword hanging idly in his paralysed right
  hand, his failing charger, wounded and feeble, nobly bearing his master to
  safety ere he falls to rise no more. The soldier's eye brightens for an
  instant as he hears the cheer of the Heavy Brigade completing the work he has
  pawned his life to begin. Soon that eye will glaze and close for ever. Men
  look round for those they knew and loved, and fear to ask for the comrade who
  is down, stiff and stark, under those dismounted guns and devastated
  batteries; horses come galloping in without riders; here and there a
  dismounted dragoon crawls feebly back to join the remnants of what was once
  his squadron, and by degrees the few survivors get together and form
  something like an ordered body once more. It is better not to count them,
  they are so few, so <i>very</i> few. Weep, England, for thy chivalry! mourn
  and wring thy hands for that disastrous day; but smile with pride through thy
  tears, thrill with exultation in thy sorrow, to think of the sons thou canst
  boast, of the deed of arms done by them in that valley before the eyes of
  gathered nations&mdash;of the immortal six hundred&mdash;thy children, every
  man of them, that rode the glorious death-ride of Balaklava!</p>

  <p>"That was a stupid business," observed Ropsley, as he brought his horse
  alongside of mine, and pointed down the valley; "quite a mistake from
  beginning to end. What a licking we deserved to get, and what a licking we
  <i>should</i> have got if our dragoons were not the only cavalry in the world
  that will <i>ride straight</i>!"</p>

  <p>"And yet what a glorious day!" I exclaimed, for the wild cheer of a charge
  seemed even now to be thrilling in my ears. "What a chance for a man to have!
  even if he did not survive it. What a proud sight for the army! Oh, Ropsley,
  what would I give to have been there!"</p>

  <p>"<i>Not whist</i>, my dear fellow," replied my less enthusiastic friend;
  "that is not the way to <i>play the game</i>, and no man who makes mistakes
  deserves to win. I have a theory of my own about cavalry, they should never
  be offered too freely. I would almost go so far as to say they should not be
  used till a battle is won. At least they should be kept in hand till the last
  moment, and then let loose like lightning. What said the Duke? 'There are no
  cavalry on earth like mine, but I can only use them <i>once</i>;' and no man
  knew so well as he did the merits and the failings of each particular arm.
  Nor should you bring the same men out again too soon after a brilliant
  charge; let them have a little time to get over it, they will <i>come</i>
  again all the better. Never <i>waste</i> anything in war, and never run a
  chance when you can stand on a certainty. But here we are at the camp of the
  First Division. Yonder you may catch a glimpse of the harbour and a few
  houses of the town of Sebastopol. How quiet it looks this fine day! quite the
  sort of place to take the children to for sea-bathing at this time of the
  year! I am getting tired of the <i>outside</i>, though, Egerton; I sometimes
  think we shall <i>never</i>get in. There they go again," he added, as a white
  volume of smoke rose slowly into the clear air, and a heavy report broke
  dully on our ears; "there they go again, but what a slack fire they seem to
  be keeping up; we shall never do any good till we try a <i>coup de main</i>,
  and take the place by assault;" so speaking, Ropsley picked his way carefully
  amongst tent-ropes and tent-pegs, and all the impediments of a camp, to reach
  the main street, so to speak, of that canvas town, and I followed him, gazing
  around me with a curiosity rather sharpened than damped by the actual warfare
  I had already seen on so much smaller a scale.</p>

  <p>There must have been at least two hundred thousand men at that time
  disposed around the beleaguered town, this without counting the Land
  Transport and followers of an army, or the crowds of non-combatants that
  thronged the ports of Kamiesch and Balaklava. The white town of tents
  stretched away for miles, divided and subdivided into streets and alleys; you
  had only to know the number of his regiment to find a private soldier, with
  as great a certainty as you could find an individual in London if you knew
  the number of his house and the name of the street where he
  resided&mdash;always pre-supposing that the soldier had not been killed the
  night before in the trenches, a casualty by no means to be overlooked. We
  rode down the main street of the Guards' division, admired the mountaineer on
  sentry at the adjoining camp of the Highland brigade, and pulled up to find
  ourselves at home at the door of Ropsley's tent, to which humble abode my
  friend welcomed me with as courteous an air and as much concern for my
  comfort as he would have done in his own luxurious lodgings in the heart of
  May-fair. A soldier's life had certainly much altered Ropsley for the better.
  I could see he was popular in his regiment. The men seemed to welcome back
  the Colonel (a captain in the Guards holds the rank of lieutenant-colonel in
  the army), and his brother officers thronged into the tent ere we had well
  entered it ourselves, to tell him the latest particulars of the siege, and
  the ghastly news that every morning brought fresh and bloody from the
  trenches.</p>

  <p>As a stranger, or rather as a guest, I was provided with the seat of
  honour, an old, shrivelled bullock-trunk that had escaped the general loss of
  baggage on the landing of the army, previous to the battle of the Alma, and
  which, set against the tent-pole for a "back," formed a commodious and
  delightful resting-place; the said tent-pole, besides being literally the
  main-stay and prop of the establishment, fulfilling all the functions of a
  wardrobe, a chest of drawers, and a dressing-table; for from certain nails
  artfully disposed on its slender circumference, depended the few articles of
  costume and necessaries of the toilet which formed the whole worldly wealth
  of the <i>ci-devant</i> London dandy.</p>

  <p>The dandy aforesaid, sitting on his camp-bedstead in his ragged
  flannel-shirt, and sharing that seat with two other dandies more ragged than
  himself, pledged his guest in a silver-gilt measure of pale ale, brought up
  from Balaklava at a cost of about half-a-guinea a bottle, and drank with a
  gusto such as the best-flavoured champagne had never wooed from a palate
  formerly too delicate and fastidious to be pleased with the nectar of the
  immortals themselves, now appreciating with exquisite enjoyment the strongest
  liquids, the most acrid tobacco, nay, the Irish stew itself, cooked by a
  private soldier at a camp-fire, savoury and delicious, if glutinous with
  grease and reeking of onions.</p>

  <p>"Heavy business the night before last," said a young Guardsman with a
  beautiful girlish face, and a pair of uncommonly dirty hands garnished with
  costly rings&mdash;a lad that looked as if he ought to be still at school,
  but uniting the cool courage of a man with the mischievous light-hearted
  spirits of a boy. "Couldn't get a wink of sleep for them at any
  time&mdash;never knew 'em so restless. Tell you what, Colonel, 'rats leave a
  falling house,' it's my belief there's <i>something up</i> now, else why were
  we all relieved at twelve o'clock instead of our regular twenty-four hours in
  the trenches? Good job for me, for I breakfasted with the General, and a
  precious blow-out he gave me. Turkey, my boys! and cherry-brandy out of a
  shaving-pot! Do you call that nothing?"</p>

  <p>"Were you in the advanced trenches?" inquired Ropsley, stopping our young
  friend's gastronomic recollections; "and did you see poor &mdash;
  killed?"</p>

  <p>The lad's face fell in an instant; it was with a saddened and altered
  voice that he replied&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Poor Charlie! yes, I was close to him when he was hit. You know it was
  his first night in the trenches, and he was like a boy out of school. Well,
  the beggars made a sortie, you know, on the left of our right attack: they
  couldn't have chosen a worse place; and he and I were with the light company
  when we drove them back. The men behaved admirably, Colonel; and poor Charlie
  was so delighted, not being used to it, you know," proceeded the urchin, with
  the gravity of a veteran, "that it was impossible to keep him within bounds.
  He had a revolver (that wouldn't go off, by the way), and he had filled a
  soda-water bottle with powder and bullets and odd bits of iron, like a sort
  of mimic shell. Well, this thing burst in his hand, and deuced near blew his
  arm off, but it only made him keener. When the Russians retired, he actually
  ran out in front and threw stones at them. I tried all I could to stop him."
  (The lad's voice was getting husky now.) "Well, Colonel, it was bright
  moonlight, and I saw a Russian private take a regular 'pot-shot' at poor
  Charlie. He hit him just below the waist-belt; and we dragged him into the
  trenches, and there he&mdash;he died. Colonel, this 'baccy of yours is very
  strong; I'll&mdash;I'll just walk into the air for a moment, if you'll excuse
  me. I'll be back directly."</p>

  <p>So he rose and walked out, with his face turned from us all; and though
  there was nothing to be ashamed of in the weakness, I think not one of us but
  knew he had gone away to have his "cry" out, and liked him all the better for
  his mock manliness and his feeling heart.</p>

  <p>Ere he came back again the bugles were sounding for afternoon parade.
  Orderly corporals were running about with small slips of paper in their
  hands, the men were falling in, and the fresh relief, so diminished every
  four-and-twenty hours, was again being got ready for the work of death in the
  trenches.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch37"
     name="ch37"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII. &mdash; "A QUIET NIGHT"</h2>

  <p class="first">On an elevated plateau, sloping downward to a ravine
  absolutely paved with iron, in the remains of shot and shell fired from the
  town during its protracted and vigorous defence, are formed in open column
  "the duties" from the different regiments destined to carry on the siege for
  the next four-and-twenty hours. Those who are only accustomed to see British
  soldiers marshalled neat and orderly in Hyde Park, or manoeuvring like
  clock-work in "the Phoanix," would hardly recognise in that motley, war-worn
  band the staid and uniform figures which they are accustomed to contemplate
  with pride and satisfaction as the "money's-worth" of a somewhat oppressive
  taxation. The Highlanders&mdash;partly from the fortune of war, partly from
  the nature of their dress&mdash;are less altered from their normal exterior
  than the rest of the army, and the Guardsman's tall figure and bear-skin cap
  still stamp him a Guardsman, notwithstanding patched clothing and much-worn
  accoutrements; but some of the line regiments, which have suffered
  considerably during the siege, present the appearance of regular troops only
  in their martial bearing and the scrupulous discipline observed within their
  ranks. To the eye of a soldier, however, there is something very pleasing and
  "workmanlike" in the healthy, confident air of the men, and the
  "matter-of-course" manner in which they seem to contemplate the duty before
  them. Though their coats may be out at elbows, their firelocks are bright and
  in good order, while the havresacks and canteens slung at their sides seem to
  have been carefully replenished with a view to keeping up that physical
  vigour and stamina for which the British soldier is so celebrated, and which,
  with his firm reliance on his officers, and determined bull-dog courage,
  render him so irresistible an enemy.</p>

  <p>There are no troops who are so little liable to panic&mdash;whose
  <i>morale</i>, so to speak, it is so difficult to impair, as our own.
  Napoleon said they "never knew when they were beaten." And how often has this
  generous ignorance saved them from defeat! Long may it be ere they learn the
  humiliating lesson! But that they are not easily disheartened may be gathered
  from the following anecdote, for the truth of which many a Crimean officer
  will readily vouch:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Two days after the disastrous attack of the 18th of June, 1855, a private
  soldier on fatigue duty was cleaning the door-step in front of Lord Raglan's
  quarters; but his thoughts were running on far other matters than holystone
  and whitewash, for on a staff officer of high rank emerging from the sacred
  portal, he stopped the astonished functionary with an abrupt request to
  procure him an immediate interview with the Commander-in-Chief.</p>

  <p>"If you please, Colonel," said the man, standing at "attention," and
  speaking as if it was the most natural thing in the world, "if it's not too
  great a liberty, I wants to see the General immediate and particular!"</p>

  <p>"Impossible! my good fellow," replied the Colonel&mdash;who, like most
  brave men, was as good-natured as he was fearless&mdash;"if you have any
  complaint to make, tell it me; you may be sure it will reach Lord Raglan, and
  if it is just, it will be attended to."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, it's not exactly a complaint," replied the soldier, now
  utterly neglecting the door-step, "but more a request, like; and I wanted to
  see his lordship special, if so be as it's not contrary to orders."</p>

  <p>The Colonel could hardly help laughing at the coolness with which so
  flagrant a military solecism was urged, but repeated that Lord Raglan was
  even then engaged with General Pelissier, and that the most he could do for
  his importunate friend was to receive his message and deliver it to the
  Commander-in-Chief at a favourable opportunity.</p>

  <p>The man reflected an instant, and seemed satisfied. "Well, Colonel," he
  said, "we <i>knows you</i>, and we <i>trusts</i> you. I speak for myself and
  comrades, and what I've got to say to the General is this here. We made a bad
  business o' Monday, and we knows the reason why. You let <i>us</i> alone.
  There's plenty of us to do it; only you give us leave, and issue an order
  that not an officer nor a non-commissioned officer is to interfere, and
  <i>we</i>, the private soldiers of the British army, will have that place for
  you if we pull the works down with our fingers, and crack the stones with our
  teeth!"</p>

  <p>"And what," said the Colonel, utterly aghast at this unheard-of proposal,
  "what&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What time will we be under arms to do it?" interrupted the delighted
  delegate, never doubting but that his request was now as good as
  granted,&mdash;"why, at three o'clock to-morrow morning; and you see,
  Colonel, when the thing's done, if me and my company <i>wasn't the first lads
  in!</i>"</p>

  <p>Such is the material of which these troops are made who are now waiting
  patiently to be marched down to the nightly butchery of the trenches.</p>

  <p>"It reminds one of the cover-side at home," remarked Ropsley, as we
  cantered up to the parade, and dismounted; "one meets fellows from all parts
  of the camp, and one hears all the news before the sport begins. There goes
  the French relief," he added, as our allies went slinging by, their jaunty,
  disordered step, and somewhat straggling line of march, forming as strong a
  contrast to the measured tramp and regular movements of our own soldiers, as
  did their blue frock-coats and crimson trousers to the <i>v&eacute;ritable
  rouge</i>for which they had conceived so high a veneration. Ere they have
  quite disappeared, our own column is formed. The brigade-major on duty has
  galloped to and fro, and seen to everything with his own eyes. Company
  officers, in rags and tatters, with swords hung sheathless in worn white
  belts, and wicker-covered bottles slung in a cord over the hip, to balance
  the revolver on the other side,&mdash;and brave, gentle hearts beating under
  those tarnished uniforms, and sad experiences of death, and danger, and
  hardship behind those frank faces, and honest, kindly smiles,&mdash;have
  inspected their men and made their reports, and "fallen in" in their proper
  places; and the word is given, and its head moves off&mdash;"By the left;
  quick march!"&mdash;and the column winds quietly down into the valley of the
  shadow of death.</p>

  <p>Ropsley is field-officer of the night, and I accompany him on his
  responsible duty, for I would fain see more of the town that has been in all
  our thoughts for so long, and learn how a siege is urged on so gigantic a
  scale.</p>

  <p>The sun is just setting, and gilds the men's faces, and the tufts of arid
  grass above their heads in the deepening ravine, with a tawny orange hue,
  peculiar to a sunset in the East. The evening is beautifully soft and still,
  but the dust is suffocating, rising as it does in clouds from the measured
  tread of so many feet; and there is a feeling of depression, a weight in the
  atmosphere, such as I have often observed to accompany the close of day on
  the shores of the Black Sea. Even the men seem to feel its
  influence&mdash;the whispered jest, the ready smile which usually accompanies
  a march, is wanting; the youngest ensign looks thoughtful, and as if he were
  brooding on his far-off home; and the lines deepen on many a bearded
  countenance as we wind lower and lower down the ravine, and reach the first
  parallel, which to some now present must be so forcible a reminder of
  disappointed hopes, fruitless sacrifices, and many a true and hearty comrade
  who shall be friend and comrade no more.</p>

  <p>Ropsley has a plan of the works in his hand, which he studies with eager
  attention. He hates soldiering&mdash;so he avows&mdash;yet is he an
  intelligent and trustworthy officer. With his own ideas on many points at
  variance with the authorities, and which he never scruples to avow, he yet
  rigidly carries out every duty entrusted to him, and if the war should last,
  promises to ascend the ladder as rapidly as any of his comrades. It is not
  the path he would have chosen to distinction, nor are the privations and
  discomforts of a soldier's life at all in harmony with his refined
  perceptions and luxurious habits; but he has embarked on the career, and,
  true to his principle, he is determined to "make the most of it." I think,
  too, that I can now perceive in Ropsley a spice of romance foreign to his
  earlier character. It is a quality without which, in some shape or other,
  nothing great was ever yet achieved on earth. Yet how angry would he be if he
  knew that I had thought he had a grain of it in his strong practical
  character, which he flatters himself is the very essence of philosophy and
  common-sense.</p>

  <p>As we wind slowly up the now well-trodden covered way of the first
  parallel, from the shelter of which nothing can be seen of the attack or
  defence, I am forcibly reminded of the passages in a theatre, which one
  threads with blindfold confidence, in anticipation of the blaze of light and
  excitement on which one will presently emerge. Ropsley smiles at the conceit
  as I whisper it in his ear.</p>

  <p>"What odd fancies you have!" says he, looking up from the plan on which he
  has been bending his earnest attention. "Well, you won't have long to wait
  for the opera; there's the first bar of the overture already!" As he speaks
  he pulls me down under the embankment, while a shower of dust and gravel, and
  a startling explosion immediately in front, warn us that the enemy has thrown
  a shell into the open angle of the trench, with a precision that is the less
  remarkable when we reflect how many months he has been practising to attain
  it.</p>

  <p>"Very neatly done," observes Ropsley, rising from his crouching attitude
  with the greatest coolness; "they seldom trouble one much so soon as this.
  Probably a compliment to you, Egerton," he adds, laughing. "Now let us see
  what the damage is."</p>

  <p>Stiff and upright as the ramrod in his firelock, which rattles to his
  salute, a sergeant of the Guards marches up and makes his
  report:&mdash;"Privates Wood and Jones wounded slightly, sir; Lance-corporal
  Smithers killed."</p>

  <p>They pass us as they are taken to the rear; the lance-corporal has been
  shot through the heart, and must have died instantaneously. His face is calm
  and peaceful, his limbs are disposed on the stretcher as if he slept. Poor
  fellow! 'Tis quick work, and in ten minutes he is forgotten. My first feeling
  is one of astonishment, at my own hardness of heart in not being more shocked
  at his fate.</p>

  <p>So we reach the advanced trenches without more loss. It is now getting
  quite dark, for the twilight in these latitudes is but of short duration. A
  brisk fire seems to be kept up on the works of our allies, responded to by
  the French gunners with ceaseless activity; but our own attack is
  comparatively unmolested, and Ropsley makes his arrangements and plants his
  sentries in a calm, leisurely way that inspires the youngest soldier with
  confidence, and wins golden opinions from the veterans who have spent so many
  bleak and weary nights before Sebastopol.</p>

  <p>We are now in the advanced trenches. Not three hundred paces to our front
  are yawning the deadly batteries of the Redan. The night is dark as pitch.
  Between the intervals of the cannonade, kept up so vigorously far away on our
  right, we listen breathlessly as the night-breeze sweeps down to us from the
  town, until we can almost fancy we hear the Russians talking within their
  works. But the "pick, pick" of our own men's tools, as they enlarge the
  trench, and their stifled whispers and cautious tread, deaden all other
  sounds. Each man works with his firelock in his hand; he knows how soon it
  may be needed. Yet the soldier's ready jest and quaint conceit is ever on the
  lip, and many a burst of laughter is smothered as it rises, and enjoyed all
  the more keenly for the constraint.</p>

  <p>"Not so much noise there," says Ropsley, in his quiet, authoritative tone,
  as the professed buffoon of the light company indulges in a more lively sally
  than usual; "I'll punish any man that speaks above a whisper. Come, my lads,"
  he adds good-humouredly, "keep quiet now, and perhaps it will be OUR turn
  before the night is over!" The men return to their work with a will, and not
  another word is heard in the ranks.</p>

  <p>The officers have established a sort of head-quarters as a <i>place
  d'armes</i>, or re-assembling spot, near the centre of their own "attack."
  Three or four are coiled up in different attitudes, beguiling the long, dark
  hours with whispered jests and grave speculations as to the intentions of the
  enemy. Here a stalwart captain of Highlanders stretches his huge frame across
  the path, puffing forth volumes of smoke from the short black pipe that has
  accompanied him through the whole war&mdash;the much-prized "cutty" that was
  presented to him by his father's forester when he shot the royal stag in the
  "pass abune Craig-Owar"; there a slim and dandy rifleman passes a
  wicker-covered flask of brandy-and-water to a tall, sedate personage who has
  worked his way through half-a-dozen Indian actions to be senior captain in a
  line regiment, and who, should he be fortunate enough to survive the present
  siege, may possibly arrive at the distinguished rank of a Brevet-Major. He
  prefers his own bottle of cold tea; as it gurgles into his lips the
  Highlander pulls a face of disgust.</p>

  <p>"Take those long, indecent legs of yours out of the way, Sandy," says a
  merry voice, the owner of which, stumbling over these brawny limbs in the
  darkness, makes his way up to Ropsley, and whispers a few words in his ear
  which seem to afford our Colonel much satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"You couldn't have done it better," says he to the new arrival, a young
  officer of engineers, the "bravest of the brave," and the "gayest of the
  gay;" "I could have spared you a few more men, but it is better as it is. I
  hate harassing our fellows, if we can help it. What will you have to
  drink?"</p>

  <p>"A drain at the flask first, Colonel," answers the light-hearted soldier;
  "I've been on duty now, one way or another, for eight-and-forty hours, and
  I'm about beat. Sandy, my boy, give us a whiff out of 'the cutty.' I'll sit
  by you. You remind me of an opera-dancer in that dress. Mind you dine with me
  to-morrow, if you're not killed."</p>

  <p>The Highlander growls out a gruff affirmative. He delights in his volatile
  friend; but he is a man of few words, although his arm is weighty and his
  brain is clear.</p>

  <p>A shell shrieks and whistles over our heads. We mark it revolving, bright
  and beautiful, like a firework through the darkness. It lights far away to
  our rear, and bounds once more from the earth ere it explodes with a loud
  report.</p>

  <p>"Not much mischief done by that gentleman," observes Ropsley, taking the
  cigar from his mouth; "he must have landed clear of all our people. We shall
  soon have another from the same battery. I wish I knew what they are doing
  over yonder," he adds, pointing significantly in the direction of the
  Redan.</p>

  <p>"I think I can find out for you, Colonel," says the engineer; "I am going
  forward to the last 'sap,' and I shall not be very far from them there. Your
  sharpshooters are just at the corner, Green," he adds to the rifleman, "won't
  you come with me?" The latter consents willingly, and as they rise from their
  dusty lair I ask leave to accompany them, for my curiosity is fearfully
  excited, and I am painfully anxious to know what the enemy is about. The last
  "sap" is a narrow and shallow trench, the termination of which is but a short
  distance from the Russian work. It is discontinued at the precipitous
  declivity which here forms one side of the well-known Woronzoff ravine; and
  from this spot, dark as it is, the sentry can be discerned moving to and
  fro&mdash;a dusky, indistinct figure&mdash;above the parapet of the
  Redan.</p>

  <p>The engineer officer and Green of the Rifles seat themselves on the very
  edge of the ravine; the former plucks a blade or two of grass and flings them
  into the air.</p>

  <p>"They can't hear us with this wind," says he. "What say you, Green;
  wouldn't it be a good lark to creep in under there, and make out what they're
  doing?"</p>

  <p>"I'm game!" says Green, one of those dare-devil young gentlemen to be
  found amongst the subalterns of the British army, who would make the same
  reply were it a question of crossing that glacis in the full glare of day to
  take the work by assault single-handed. "Put your sword off, that's all,
  otherwise you'll make such a row that our own fellows will think they're
  attacked, and fire on us like blazes. Mind you, my chaps have had lots of
  practice, and can hit a haystack as well as their neighbours. Now then, are
  you ready? Come on."</p>

  <p>The engineer laughed, and unbuckled his sabre.</p>

  <p>"Good-afternoon, Mr. Egerton, in case I shouldn't see you again," said he;
  and so the two crept silently away upon their somewhat hazardous
  expedition.</p>

  <p>I watched their dark figures with breathless interest. The sky had lifted
  a little, and there was a ray or two of moonlight struggling fitfully through
  the clouds. I could just distinguish the two English officers as they crawled
  on hands and knees amongst the slabs of rock and inequalities of ground which
  now formed their only safety. I shuddered to think that if I could thus
  distinguish their forms, why not the Russian riflemen?&mdash;and what chance
  for them then, with twenty or thirty "Mini&eacute;s" sighted on them at
point-blank
  distance? However, "Fortune favours the brave;" the light breeze died away,
  and the moon was again obscured. I could see them no longer, and I knew that
  by this time they must have got within a very few paces of the enemy's
  batteries, and that discovery was now certain death. The ground, too,
  immediately under the Russian work was smoother and less favourable to
  concealment than under our own. The moments seemed to pass very slowly. I
  scarcely dared to move, and the tension of my nerves was absolutely painful,
  every faculty seeming absorbed in one concentrated effort of listening.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a short, sharp stream of light, followed by the quick, angry
  report of the Mini&eacute;&mdash;then another and another&mdash;they
illumine the
  night for an instant; and during that instant I strain my eyes in vain to
  discover the two dark creeping forms. And now a blinding glare fills our
  trenches&mdash;the figures of the men coming out like phantoms in their
  different attitudes of labour and repose. The enemy has thrown a fire-ball
  into our works to ascertain what we are about. Like the pilot-fish before the
  shark, that brilliant messenger is soon succeeded by its deadly followers,
  and ere I can hurry back to the rallying-point of the attack, where I have
  left Ropsley and his comrades, a couple of shells have already burst amongst
  our soldiers, dealing around them their quantum of wounds and death, whilst a
  couple more are winging their way like meteors over our heads, to carry the
  alarm far to the rear, where the gallant blue-jackets have established a
  tremendous battery, and are at this moment in all probability chafing and
  fretting that they are not nearer the point of danger.</p>

  <p>"Stand to your arms! Steady, men, steady!" is the word passed from soldier
  to soldier along the ranks, and the men spring like lions to the parapet,
  every heart beating high with courage, every firelock held firmly at the
  charge. They are tired of "long bowls" now, and would fain have it out with
  the bayonet.</p>

  <p>The fire from the Redan lights up the intervening glacis, and as I rush
  hurriedly along the trench, stooping my head with instinctive precaution, I
  steal a glance or two over the low parapet, which shows me the figure of a
  man running as hard as his legs can carry him towards our own rallying-point.
  He is a mark for fifty Russian rifles, but he speeds on nevertheless. His
  cheery voice rings through all the noise and confusion, as he holloas to our
  men not to fire at him.</p>

  <p>"Hold on, my lads," he says, leaping breathlessly into the trench; "I've
  had a precious good run for it. Where's the Colonel?"</p>

  <p>His report is soon made. It is the young officer of engineers who thus
  returns in haste from his reconnoitring expedition. His companion, Green, has
  reached his own regiment by another track, for they wisely separated when
  they found themselves observed, and strange to say, notwithstanding the
  deadly fire through which they have "run the gauntlet," both are unwounded.
  The engineer confers with Ropsley in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"They only want to draw off our attention, Colonel," says he; "I am quite
  sure of it. When I was under the Redan I could hear large bodies of men
  moving towards their left. That is the point of attack, depend upon it. There
  they go on our right! I told you so. Now we shall have it, hot and heavy, or
  I'm mistaken."</p>

  <p>Even while he speaks a brisk fire is heard to open on our right flank. The
  clouds clear off, too, and the moon, now high in the heavens, shines forth
  unveiled. By her soft light we can just discern a dark, indistinct mass
  winding slowly along across an open space of ground between the Russian
  works. The rush of a round-shot from one of our own batteries whizzes over
  our heads. That dusky column wavers, separates, comes together again, and
  presses on. Ropsley gets cooler and cooler, for it is coming at last.</p>

  <p>"Captain McDougal," says he to that brawny warrior, who does not look the
  least like an opera-dancer now, as he rears his six feet of vigour on those
  stalwart supporters, "I can spare all the Highlanders; form them directly,
  and move to your right flank. Do not halt till you reach the ground I told
  you of. The Rifles and our own light company will stand fast! Remainder,
  right, form four deep&mdash;march!"</p>

  <p>There is an alarm along the whole line. Our allies are engaged in a brisk
  cannonade for their share, and many an ugly missile hisses past our ears from
  the foe, or whistles over our heads from our own supports. Is it to be a
  general attack?&mdash;a second Inkermann, fought out by moonlight? Who knows?
  The uncertainty is harassing, yet attended with its own thrilling
  excitement&mdash;half a pleasure, half a pain.</p>

  <p>A few of our own people (we cannot in the failing light discover to what
  regiment they belong) are giving way before a dense mass of Russian infantry
  that outnumber them a hundred to one. They have shown a determined front for
  a time, but they are sorely pressed and overpowered, and by degrees they give
  back more and more. The truth must out&mdash;they are on the point of turning
  tail and running away. A little fiery Irishman stands out in front of them; a
  simple private is he in the regiment, and never likely to reach a more
  exalted rank, for, like all great men, he has a darling weakness, and the
  temptation to which he cannot but succumb is inebriety&mdash;the pages of the
  Defaulters' Book call it "habitual drunkenness." Nevertheless, he has the
  heart of a hero. Gesticulating furiously, and swearing, I regret to say, with
  blasphemous volubility, he tears the coat from his back, flings his cap on
  the ground, and tossing his arms wildly above his head, thus rebukes, like
  some Homeric hero, his more prudent comrades&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Och, bad luck to ye, rank cowards and shufflers that ye are! and bad luck
  to the day I listed! and bad luck to the rig'ment that's disgracin' me! Would
  I wear the uniform, and parade like a soldier again, when it's been dirtied
  by the likes of you? 'Faith, not I, ye thunderin' villains. I'll tread and
  I'll trample the coat, and the cap, and the facin's, and the rest of it; and
  I'll fight in my shirt, so I will, if they come on fifty to one. Hurroo!"</p>

  <p>Off goes his musket in the very faces of the enemy; with a rush and a yell
  he runs at them with the bayonet. His comrades turn, and strike in vigorously
  with the hero. Even that little handful of men serves for an instant to check
  the onward progress of the Russians. By this time the supports&mdash;Guards,
  Highlanders, and the flower of the British infantry&mdash;are pouring from
  their entrenchments; a tremendous fire of musketry opens from the whole line;
  staff officers are galloping down hurry-skurry from the camp. Far away above
  us, on those dark heights, the whole army will be under arms in ten minutes.
  The Russian column wavers once more&mdash;breaks like some wave against a
  sunken rock; dark, flitting figures are seen to come out, and stagger, and
  fall; and then the whole body goes to the right-about and returns within its
  defences, just as a mass of heavy clouds rising from the Black Sea sweeps
  across the moon, and darkness covers once more besiegers and besieged.</p>

  <p>We may lie down in peace now till the first blush of dawn rouses the
  riflemen on each side to that sharp-shooting practice of which it is their
  custom to take at least a couple of hours before breakfast. We may choose the
  softest spots in those dusty, covered ways, and lean our backs against
  gabions that are getting sadly worn out, and in their half-emptied
  inefficiency afford but an insecure protection even from the conical ball of
  the wicked "Mini&eacute;." We may finish our flasks of brandy-and-water and
our
  bottles of cold tea, and get a few winks of sleep, and dream of home and the
  loved ones that, except in the hours of sleep, some of us will never see
  more. All these luxuries we may enjoy undisturbed. We shall not be attacked
  again, for this is what the soldiers term "A <i>quiet</i> night in the
  trenches."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch38"
     name="ch38"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII. &mdash; THE GROTTO</h2>

  <p class="first">It is not <i>all</i> fighting, though, before Sebastopol.
  Without coinciding entirely with the somewhat Sancho Panza-like philosophy
  which affirms that the "latter end of a feast is better than the beginning of
  a fray," there is many a gallant fellow who has not the slightest objection
  to take his share of both; and from the days of Homer's heavy-handed heroes,
  down to those of the doughty Major Dugald Dalgetty himself, a good
  commissariat has always been considered essential to the success of all
  warlike enterprise. Every campaigner knows what a subject of speculation and
  excitement is afforded by the prospect of "what he will have for dinner," and
  the scantiness of that meal, together with the difficulty of providing for
  it, seems but to add to the zest with which it is enjoyed. Many a quaint
  incident and laughable anecdote is related of the foraging propensities of
  our allies, particularly the Zouaves, who had learned their trade in Algeria,
  and profited by the lessons of their Khabyle foe. The Frenchman, moreover,
  knows how to <i>cook</i> a dinner <i>when</i> he has filched it, which is
  more than can be said for our own gallant countrymen.</p>

  <p>Had it not been for Fortnum and Mason&mdash;names which deserve to be
  immortalised, and which will ever be remembered with gratitude by the British
  army&mdash;our heroes would indeed have been badly off for luxurious living
  on that bracing and appetite-giving plateau. Yet, thanks to the energy of
  this enterprising firm, Amphitryons were enabled to indulge their taste for
  hospitality, and guests to admire and criticise the merits of the very
  commendable delicacies placed before them.</p>

  <p>A dinner-party at Sebastopol, just out of cannon-shot, had something
  inexpressibly enlivening in its composition. There was no lack of news, no
  lack of laughter, no lack of eatables and drinkables, above all, no lack of
  hunger and thirst. The same faces were to be seen around the board that might
  have been met with at any dinner-table in London, but white neckcloths and
  broadcloth had given place to tawny beards and tarnished uniforms, whilst the
  bronzed countenances and high spirits of the party formed an exhilarating
  contrast to the weary looks and vapid conversation which makes London
  society, in its own intrinsic attractions, the stupidest in the world.</p>

  <p>The sun's last rays are lighting up that well-known hill where sleeps "the
  bravest of the brave," he whose name will go down to our children's children
  coupled with Inkermann, as that of Leonidas with Thermopylae. He whose fall
  evoked a deed of chivalry such as minstrel and troubadour snatched from
  oblivion in the olden time, and handed down to us for a beacon along the
  pathway of honour. Had they ever a nobler theme than this? A chief falls,
  surrounded and overpowered, in his desperate attempt to retrieve the fortunes
  of a day that he deems all but lost. His friend and comrade, faint and
  mangled, turns once more into the battle, and bestrides the form of the
  prostrate hero. One to ten, the breathless and the wounded against the fresh
  and strong, but the heart of an English gentleman behind that failing sword,
  beat down and shattered by the thirsty bayonets. An instant the advance is
  checked. An instant and they might both have been saved. Oh, for but one
  half-dozen of the towering forms that are even now mustering to the rescue!
  They are coming through the smoke! Too late&mdash;too late! the lion-hearted
  chieftain and the gentle, chivalrous warrior are down, slain, trampled, and
  defaced, but side by side on the bed of honour; and though the tide sweeps
  back, and the broken columns of the Muscovite are driven, routed and
  shattered, to the rear, <i>their</i> ears are deaf to the shout of victory,
  <i>their</i> laurel wreaths shall hang vacant and unworn, for they shall rise
  to claim them no more.</p>

  <p>The setting sun is gilding their graves&mdash;the white buildings of
  Sebastopol smile peacefully in his declining rays&mdash;the sea is blushing
  violet under the rich purple of the evening sky. The allied fleets are dotted
  like sleeping wild-fowl over the bosom of the deep; one solitary steamer
  leaves its long dusky track of smoke to form a stationary cloud, so smooth is
  the water that the ripple caused by the sunken ships can be plainly discerned
  in the harbour, and the Russian men-of-war still afloat look like children's
  toys in the distance of that clear, calm atmosphere. The bleak and arid
  foreground, denuded of vegetation, and trampled by a thousand footmarks, yet
  glows with the warm orange hues of sunset, and the white tents contrast
  pleasingly with here and there the richer colouring of some more stationary
  hut or storehouse. It is an evening for peace, reflection, and repose; but
  the dull report of a 68-pounder smites heavily on the ear from the town, and
  a smart soldier-servant, standing respectfully at "attention," observes, "The
  General is ready, sir, and dinner is upon the table."</p>

  <p>In a grotto dug by some Tartar hermit out of the cool earth are assembled
  a party of choice spirits, who are indeed anchorites in nothing but the
  delight with which they greet the refreshing atmosphere of their
  banqueting-hall. A flight of stone steps leads down into this well-contrived
  vault, in so hot a climate no contemptible exchange for the stifling interior
  of a tent, or even the comparative comfort of a wooden hut thoroughly baked
  through by the sun. A halting figure on crutches is toiling painfully down
  that staircase, assisted, with many a jest at their joint deficiencies, by a
  stalwart, handsome Guardsman, a model of manly strength and symmetry, but
  lacking what he is pleased to term his "liver wing." They are neither of them
  likely to forget the Crimea whilst they live. Ere they reach the bottom they
  are overtaken by a cavalry officer with jingling spurs and noisy scabbard,
  who, having had a taste of fighting, such as ought to have satisfied most
  men, at Balaklava, is now perpetually hovering about the front, disgusted
  with his enforced idleness at Kadikoi, and with a strong impression on his
  mind&mdash;which he supports by many weighty arguments&mdash;that a few
  squadrons of Dragoons would be valuable auxiliaries to a storming party, and
  that a good swordsman on a good horse can "go anywhere and do anything."</p>

  <p>"I think we are all here now," says the host; "Monsieur le
G&eacute;n&eacute;ral, shall
  we go to dinner?"</p>

  <p>The individual addressed gives a hearty affirmative. He is a stout,
  good-humoured-looking personage, with an eagle eye, and an extremely tight
  uniform covered with orders and decorations. He is not yet too fat to get on
  horseback, though the privations of campaigning seem to increase his
  rotundity day by day, and he expects ere long to go to battle, like an
  ancient Scythian, in his war-chariot. By that time he will be a marshal of
  France, but meanwhile he pines a little for the opera, and enjoys his dinner
  extremely. He occupies the seat of honour on the right hand of his host. The
  latter bids his guests welcome in frank, soldier-like style; and whilst the
  soup is handed round, and those bearded lips are occupied with its merits,
  let us take a look round the table at the dozen or so of guests, some of whom
  are destined ere long to have their likenesses in every print-shop in merry
  England. First of all the dinner-giver himself&mdash;a square, middle-sized
  man, with a kindling eye, and a full, determined voice that suggests at once
  the habit of command&mdash;a kindly though energetic manner, and a
  countenance indicative of great resolution and clear-headedness; perhaps the
  best drill in the British army, and delighting much in a neat touch of parade
  tactics even before an enemy. Many a Guardsman nudged his comrade with a grin
  of humorous delight when, on a certain 20th of September, his old colonel
  coolly doubled a flank company in upon the rear of its battalion, and smiled
  to see the ground it would otherwise have occupied ploughed and riddled by
  the round-shot that was pouring from the enemy's batteries in position on the
  heights above the Alma. The British soldier likes coolness above all things;
  and where in command of foreign troops an officer should rave and gesticulate
  and tear his hair to elicit a corresponding enthusiasm from his men, our own
  phlegmatic Anglo-Saxons prefer the quiet smile and the good-humoured
  "<i>Now</i>, my lads!" which means so much.</p>

  <p>On the left, and facing the Frenchman, sits a middle-aged decided-looking
  man, somewhat thoughtful and abstracted, yet giving his opinions in a clear
  and concise manner, and with a forcible tone and articulation that denote
  great energy and firmness of character. His name, too, is destined to fill
  the page of history&mdash;his future is bright and glowing before him, and
  none will grudge his honours and promotion, for he is endeared to the army by
  many a kindly action, and it has been exertion for their welfare and watching
  on their behalf, that have wasted his strong frame with fever, and turned his
  hair so grey in so short a time. Soldier as he is to his heart's core, he
  would fain be outside in the sunset with his colours and his sketch-book,
  arresting on its pages the glorious panorama which is even now passing away;
  but he is listening attentively to his neighbour, a handsome young man in the
  uniform of a simple private of Zouaves, and is earnestly occupied in "getting
  a wrinkle," as it is termed, concerning the interior economy and discipline
  of that far-famed corps. The Zouave gives him all the information he can
  desire with that peculiarly frank and fascinating manner which is fast dying
  out with the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i>, for though a private of Zouaves he
is a
  marquis of France, the representative of one of the oldest families in the
  Empire, and a worthy scion of his chivalrous race. Rather than not draw the
  sword for his country, he has resigned his commission in that body of
  household cavalry termed "The Guides," and entered as a trooper in the
  Chasseurs d'Afrique: a display of martial enthusiasm for which he has been
  called out from the ranks of his original corps and publicly complimented by
  the Empress Eug&eacute;nie herself. Arrived in the Crimea, he found his new
comrades
  placed in enforced idleness at far too great a distance from active
  operations to suit his taste, and he forthwith exchanged once more into the
  Zouaves, with whom he took his regular share of duty in the trenches, and he
  is now enjoying a furlough of some six hours from his quarters, to dine with
  an English general, and cultivate the <i>entente cordiale</i> which
  flourishes so vigorously on this Crimean soil. Alas for the gallant spirit,
  the graceful form, the warm noble heart! no bird of ill omen flew across his
  path as he came to-day to dinner, no warning note of impending death rang in
  his ears to give him notice of his doom. To-night he is as gay, as lively, as
  cheerful as usual; to-morrow he will be but a form of senseless clay, shot
  through the head in the trenches.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the champagne goes round, and is none the less appreciated that
  although there is an abundance of bottles, there is a sad deficiency of
  glasses. A light-hearted aide-de-camp, well accustomed to every emergency,
  great or small, darts off to his adjoining tent, from which he presently
  returns, bearing two tin cups and the broken remains of a coffee-pot; with
  these auxiliaries dinner progresses merrily, and a fat turkey&mdash;how
  obtained it is needless to inquire&mdash;is soon reduced to a skeleton. A
  little wit goes a long way when men are before an enemy; and as the
  aide-de-camp strongly repudiates the accusation of having purloined this
  hapless bird, jokes are bandied about from one to another, every one wishing
  to fasten on his neighbour the accusation of knowing how to "make war support
  war."</p>

  <p>The English officers are a long way behind their allies in this useful
  accomplishment; and the French general shakes his jolly sides as he relates
  with much gusto sundry Algerian experiences of what we should term larceny
  and rapine, but which his more liberal ideas seem to consider excusable, if
  not positively meritorious.</p>

  <p>"The best foragers I had in Algeria," says he, "were my best soldiers too.
  If I wanted fresh milk for my coffee, I trusted to the same men that formed
  my storming parties, and I was never disappointed in one case or the other.
  In effect, they were droll fellows, my Zouaves
Indig&egrave;nes&mdash;cunning too,
  as the cat that steals cream; the Khabyles could keep nothing from them. If
  we entered their tents, everything of value was taken away before you could
  look round. To be sure we could carry nothing with us, but that made no
  difference. I have seen the men wind shawls round their waists that were
  worth a hundred louis apiece, and throw them aside on a hot day on the march.
  There was one Khabyle chief who was very conspicuous for the magnificent
  scarlet cashmere which he wore as a turban. On foot or on horseback, there he
  was, always fighting and always in the front. Heaven knows why, but the men
  called him Bobouton, and wherever there was a skirmish Bobouton was sure to
  be in the thick of it. One day I happened to remark 'that I was tired of
  Bobouton and his red shawl, and I wished some one would bring me the turban
  and rid me of the wearer.' A little swarthy Zouave, named
P&eacute;p&eacute;, overheard my
  observation. '<i>Mon Colonel</i>,' said he, with a most ceremonious bow,'
  to-morrow is your <i>jour de f&ecirc;te</i>&mdash;will you permit me to
celebrate
  it by presenting you with the scarlet turban of Bobouton?' I laughed, thanked
  him, and thought no more about it.</p>

  <p>"The following morning, at sunrise, I rode out to make a reconnaissance. A
  party, of whom P&eacute;p&eacute; was one, moved forward to clear the
ground. Contrary to
  all discipline and <i>ordonnance</i>, my droll little friend had mounted a
  magnificent pair of epaulettes. Worn on his Zouave uniform, the effect was
  the least thing ridiculous. As I knew of no epaulettes in the camp besides my
  own, I confess I was rather angry, but the enemy having opened a sharp fire
  upon my skirmishers, I did not choose to sacrifice an aide-de-camp by bidding
  him ride on and visit P&eacute;p&eacute; with condign punishment; so,
reserving to myself
  that duty on his return, I watched him meanwhile through my glass with an
  interest proportioned to my regard for my epaulettes, an article not too
  easily replaced in Algeria. Nor were mine the only eyes that looked so
  eagerly on the flashing bullion. Bobouton soon made his appearance from
  behind a rock, and by the manner in which he and P&eacute;p&eacute; watched,
and, so to
  speak, 'stalked' each other, I saw that a regular duel was pending between
  the two. In fine, after very many manoeuvres on both sides, the Zouave
  incautiously exposed himself at a distance of eighty or ninety paces, and was
  instantaneously covered by his watchful enemy. As the smoke cleared away from
  the Khabyle's rifle, poor P&eacute;p&eacute; sprang convulsively in the air,
and fell
  headlong on his face. 'Tenez!' said I to myself, 'there is
P&eacute;p&eacute; shot through
  the heart, and I shall never see my epaulettes again.'</p>

  <p>"The Khabyle rushed from his hiding-place to strip his fallen antagonist.
  Already his eyes glittered with delight at the idea of possessing those
  tempting ornaments&mdash;already he was within a few feet of the prostrate
  body, when 'crack!' once more I heard the sharp report of a rifle, and
  presto, like some scene at a carnival, it was Bobouton that lay slain upon
  the rocks, and P&eacute;p&eacute; that stood over him and stripped him of
the spoils of
  war. In another minute he unrolled the red turban at my horse's feet. '<i>Mon
  Colonel</i>,' said he, 'accept my congratulations for yourself and your
  amiable family. Accept also this trifling token of remembrance taken from
  that incautious individual who, like the mouse in the fable, thinks the cat
  must be dead because she lies prostrate without moving. And accept, moreover,
  my thanks for the loan of these handsome ornaments, without the aid of which
  I could not have procured myself the pleasure of presenting my worthy colonel
  with the shawl of <i>ce malheureux Bobouton</i>.' The rascal had stolen them
  out of my tent the night before, though my aide-de-camp slept within two
  paces of me, and my head rested on the very box in which they were
  contained."</p>

  <p>"Alas! we have no experiences like yours, General," says a tall, handsome
  colonel of infantry, with the Cape and Crimean ribbons on his breast;
  "wherever we have made war with savages, they have had nothing worth taking.
  A Kaffre chief goes to battle with very little on besides his skin, and that
  is indeed scarce worth the trouble of stripping. When we captured Sandilli, I
  give you my word he had no earthly article upon his person but a string of
  blue beads, and yet he fought like a wildcat to make his escape."</p>

  <p>"Your health, my friend," replies the General, clinking his glass with
  that of his new acquaintance. "You have been in Caffraria? Ah! I should have
  known it by your decorations. Are they not a fierce and formidable enemy? Is
  it not a good school for war? Tell me, now"&mdash;looking round the table for
  an explanation&mdash;"why do you not reserve South Africa, you others, as we
  do the northern shore, to make of it a drill-ground for your soldiers and a
  school for your officers? It would cost but little&mdash;a few hundred men a
  year would be the only loss. Bah!&mdash;a mere trifle to the richest and most
  populous country in the world. I do not understand your English <i>sang-
  froid</i>. Why do you not establish <i>your</i> Algeria at the Cape?"</p>

  <p>Many voices are immediately raised in explanation; but it is difficult to
  make the thorough soldier&mdash;the man who has all his life been the
  military servant of a military Government&mdash;understand how repugnant
  would be such a proceeding to the feelings of the British people&mdash;how
  contrary to the whole spirit of their constitution. At length, with another
  glass of champagne, a new light seems to break in upon him. "Ah!" says he,
  "it would not be approved of by <i>Le Times</i>; now I understand perfectly.
  We manage these matters better with us. <i>Peste!</i> if we go to war, there
  it is. We employ our <i>Gazettes</i> to celebrate our victories. Your health,
  <i>mon G&eacute;n&eacute;ral</i>; this is indeed a wearisome business in
which we are
  engaged&mdash;a life totally brutalising. Without change, without
  manoeuvring, and without pleasure: what would you? I trust the next campaign
  in which we shall meet may be in a civilised country&mdash;the borders of the
  Rhine, for instance; what think you?&mdash;where, instead of this barbarian
  desert, you find a village every mile, and a good house in every village,
  with a bottle of wine in the cellar, a smoked ham in the chimney, and a
  handsome Saxon <i>blonde</i> in the kitchen. '<i>A la guerre, comme &agrave;
la
  guerre, n'est ce pas, mon G&eacute;n&eacute;ral?</i>'"</p>

  <p>The company are getting merry and talkative; cigars are lit, and coffee is
  handed round; the small hours are approaching, and what Falstaff calls the
  "sweet of the night" is coming on, when the tramp and snort of a horse are
  heard at the entrance of the grotto, a steel scabbard rings upon the stone
  steps, and although the new-comer's place at one end of the table has been
  vacant the whole of dinner-time, he does not sit down to eat till he has
  whispered a few words in the ear of the English general, who receives the
  intelligence with as much coolness as it is imparted.</p>

  <p>In five minutes the grotto is cleared of all save its customary occupants.
  The French general has galloped off to his head-quarters; the English
  officers are hurrying to their men; each as he leaves the grotto casts a look
  at an ingenious arrangement at its mouth, which, by means of a diagram formed
  of white shells, each line pointing to a particular portion of the attack,
  enables the observer to ascertain at once in which direction the fire is most
  severe. The originator of this simple and ingenious indicator meanwhile sits
  down for a mouthful of food. He has brought intelligence of the sortie
  already described, and which will turn out the troops of all arms in about
  ten minutes; but in the meantime he has five to spare, and, being very
  hungry, he makes the best use of his time. As the light from the solitary
  lamp brings into relief that square, powerful form&mdash;that statue-like
  head, with its fearless beauty and its classical features&mdash;above all,
  the frank, kindly smile, that never fades under difficulties, and the clear,
  unwavering eye that never quails in danger,&mdash;any physiognomist worthy of
  the name would declare "that man was born to be a hero!" And the
  physiognomist would not be mistaken.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch39"
     name="ch39"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX. &mdash; THE REDAN</h2>

  <p class="first">The days dragged on in the camp. Sometimes wearily enough,
  sometimes enlivened by a party of pleasure to Baidar, an expedition to the
  monastery of St. George, a general action at the Tchernaya, a hurdle-race at
  Kadikoi, or some trifling excitement of the same kind. Already the great heat
  was beginning to be tempered by the bracing air of autumn, and the army was
  more than half inclined to speculate on the possibility of another long
  dreary winter before Sebastopol.</p>

  <p>But the time had come at last. The blow so long withheld was to be
  launched in earnest, and for a day or two before the final and successful
  assault, men's minds seemed to tell them&mdash;they scarce knew
  why&mdash;that a great change was impending, and that every night might now
  be the last on which the dogged valour of the besieged would man those
  formidable defences that, under the names of the Malakhoff, the Redan, etc.,
  had for so long occupied the attention of France, England, and indeed the
  whole of Europe.</p>

  <p>I was sitting outside Ropsley's tent, sharing my breakfast of hard biscuit
  with Bold, at daybreak of a fine September morning. The old dog seemed on
  this occasion to have renewed his youth, and was so demonstrative and
  affectionate as to call down a strong reproof from Ropsley, with whom he was
  never on very friendly terms, for laying his broad paw on the well-brushed
  uniform of the Colonel. "Tie the brute up, Vere," said he, carefully removing
  the dirt from his threadbare sleeve, "or he will follow us on parade. Are you
  ready? if so, come along. I would not be late to-day of all days, for a
  thousand a year."</p>

  <p>I remained in his rear, as he completed the inspection of his company. I
  had never seen the men so brisk or so smartly turned out, and there was an
  exhilarated yet earnest look on their countenances that denoted their own
  opinion of the coming day. Ropsley himself was more of the <i>bon
  camarade</i>, and less of the "fine gentleman" than usual. As we marched down
  to the trenches side by side, he talked freely of old times,&mdash;our
  school-days at Everdon, our later meeting at Beverley, and, by a natural
  transition, turned the subject of conversation to Victor de Rohan and his
  sister Val&eacute;rie. I had never known him allude to the latter of his own
accord
  before. He seemed to have something on his mind which pride or mistrust, or
  both, would not permit him to bring out. At last, apparently with a strong
  effort, he whispered hurriedly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Vere, I've a favour to ask you&mdash;if I should be <i>hit</i> to-day by
  chance, and badly, you know, I should like you to write and remember me to
  the De Rohans, and&mdash;and&mdash;particularly to Countess Val&eacute;rie.
If ever
  you should see her again, you might tell her so."</p>

  <p>I pressed his hand in answer, and I thought his voice was hoarser as he
  resumed.</p>

  <p>"Vere, it is not often I confess myself wrong, but I have wronged you
  fearfully. If I'm alive to-morrow I'll tell you all; if not, Vere, can
  you&mdash;<i>can</i> you forgive me?"</p>

  <p>"From my heart," was all I had time to reply, for at that instant up rode
  the leader of the assault, and Ropsley's voice was calm and measured, his
  manner cold and cynical as ever, while he answered the short and military
  catechism usual on such occasions.</p>

  <p>"Then it's all right," was the remark of the mounted officer, in as
  good-humoured and jovial a tone as if the affair in hand were a mere question
  of one of his own Norfolk battues; "and what a fine morning we've got for the
  business," he added, dismounting, and patting his horse as it was led away,
  ere he turned round to put himself at the head of the storming party.</p>

  <p>I watched him as one watches a man whose experiences of danger have given
  him a fascination perfectly irresistible to inferior minds. It was the same
  officer whom I have already mentioned as the latest arrival to disturb the
  dinner-party in the grotto, but to-day he looked, if possible, more cheerful,
  and in better spirits than his wont. I thought of his antecedents, as they
  had often been related to me by one of his oldest friends,&mdash;of his
  unfailing good-humour and kindliness of disposition&mdash;of his popularity
  in his regiment&mdash;of his skill and prowess at all sports and pastimes,
  with the gloves, the foils, the sharp-rowelled spurs of the hunting-field, or
  the velvet cap that fails to protect the steeplechaser from a broken
  neck&mdash;of his wanderings in the desert amongst the Bedouin Arabs, and his
  cold bivouacs on the prairie with the Red Indians&mdash;of his lonely ride
  after the Alma, when, steering by the stars through a country with which he
  was totally unacquainted, he arrived at the fleet with the news of the famous
  flank march to Balaklava&mdash;of his daring <i>sang-froid</i> when "the
  thickest of war's tempest lowered" at Inkermann, and of the daily dangers and
  privations of the weary siege, always borne and faced out with the same merry
  light-hearted smile; and now he was to <i>lead the assault</i>.</p>

  <p>None but a soldier knows all that is comprised in those three simple
  words&mdash;the coolness, the daring, the lightning glance, the ready
  resource, the wary tactics, and the headlong gallantry which must all be
  combined successfully to fill that post of honour; and then to think that the
  odds are ten to one he never comes back alive!</p>

  <p>As I looked at his athletic frame and handsome, manly face, as I returned
  his cordial, off-hand greeting, as courteous to the nameless Interpreter as
  it would have been to General Pelissier himself, my heart tightened to think
  of what might&mdash;nay, what <i>must</i> surely happen on that fire-swept
  glacis, unless he bore indeed a life charmed with immunity from shot and
  steel.</p>

  <p>Man by man he inspected the Forlorn Hope,&mdash;their arms, their
  ammunition pouches, their scaling-ladders, all the tackle and paraphernalia
  of death. For each he had a word of encouragement, a jest, or a smile.
  Ropsley and his company were to remain in support in the advanced trenches.
  All was at length reported "ready," and then came the awful hush that ever
  ushers in the most desperate deeds&mdash;the minutes of pale and breathless
  suspense, that fly so quickly and yet seem to pass like lead&mdash;when the
  boldest cheek is blanched, and the stoutest heart beats painfully, and the
  change to action and real peril is felt to be an unspeakable relief to
  all.</p>

  <p>A cold wet nose was poked into my hand. Bold had tracked me from the camp,
  and had followed me even here; nothing would induce him now to quit my side,
  for even the dog seemed to think something awful was impending, and watched
  with red, angry eyes and lowered tail and bristling neck, as if he too had
  been "told off" for the attack.</p>

  <p>A roar of artillery shakes the air; our allies have opened their fire on
  the Malakhoff, and their columns are swarming like bees to the assault.
  Battalion after battalion, regiment after regiment, come surging through the
  ditch, to break like waves on the sea-shore, as the depressed guns of the
  enemy hew awful gaps in their ranks&mdash;to break indeed but to re-form, and
  as fresh supports keep pressing them on from the rear, to dash upwards
  against the earthwork, and to overflow and fling themselves from the parapet
  in the face of the Russian gunners below.</p>

  <p>The Muscovite fights doggedly, and without dream of surrender or retreat.
  Hand to hand the conflict must be decided with the bayonet, and the little
  Zouaves shout, and yell, and stab, and press onward, and revel, so to speak,
  in the wild orgy of battle.</p>

  <p>But the Northman is a grim, uncompromising foe, and more than once the
  "red pantaloons" waver and give back, and rally, and press on again to death.
  Instances of gallantry and self-devotion are rife amongst the officers. Here,
  a young captain of infantry flings himself alone upon the bayonets of the
  enemy, and falls pierced with a hundred wounds; there, an old white-headed
  colonel, <i>d&eacute;cor&eacute;</i> up to his chin, draws an ominous
revolver, and
  threatens to shoot any one of his own men through the head that shows the
  slightest disinclination to rush on. "<i>Ma foi</i>," says he, "<i>c'est pour
  encourager les autres!</i>" The southern blood boils up under the influence
  of example, and if French troops are once a little flushed with success,
  their <i>&eacute;lan</i>, as they call that quality for which we have no
  corresponding expression, is irresistible. The Russians cannot face the
  impetuosity of their charge; already many of the guns are spiked, and the
  gunners bayoneted; the grey-coated columns are yielding ground foot by foot;
  fresh troops pour in over the parapet, for the living are now able to pass
  unscathed over the dead, with whom the ditch is filled. The fire of the
  Russians is slackening, and their yell dies away fainter on the breeze. A
  French cheer, wild, joyous, and unearthly, fills the air,&mdash;it thrills in
  the ears of Pelissier, sitting immovable on his horse at no great distance
  from the conflict; his telescope is pressed to his eye, and he is watching
  eagerly for the well-known signal. And now he sees it! A gleam of fierce joy
  lights up his features, and as the tricolor of France is run up to the crest
  of the Malakhoff, he shuts his glass with a snap, dismounts from his horse,
  and rolling himself round in his cloak, lies down for a few minutes' repose,
  and observes, with a zest of which none but a Frenchman is capable,
  "<i>Tenez! voil&agrave; mon baton de Mar&eacute;chal!</i>"</p>

  <p>His are not the only eyes eagerly watching the progress of the attack;
  many a veteran of both armies is busied recalling all his own experiences and
  all his knowledge of warfare, to calculate the probabilities of their success
  whose task it is to cross that wide and deadly glacis which is swept by the
  batteries of the Redan.</p>

  <p>The men are formed for the assault, and the word is given to advance.</p>

  <p>"Now, my lads," says the leader, "keep cool&mdash;keep steady&mdash;and
  keep together&mdash;we'll do it handsomely when we're about it. Forward!"</p>

  <p>It is related of him whom Napoleon called "the bravest of the brave," the
  famous Ney, that he was the only officer of that day who could preserve his
  <i>sang-froid</i> totally unmoved when standing with <i>his back</i> to a
  heavy fire. Many a gallant fellow facing the enemy would pay no more regard
  to the missiles whistling about his ears, than to the hailstones of an April
  shower; but it was quite a different sensation to <i>front</i> his own
  advancing troops, and never look round at the grim archer whose every shaft
  might be the last. What the French Marshal, however, piqued himself upon as
  the acme of personal courage and conduct, our English leader seems to
  consider a mere matter-of-course in the performance of an every-day duty.
  Step by step, calm, collected, and good-humoured, he regulates the movements
  of the attacking force. Fronting their ranks, as if he were on parade, he
  brings them out of their sheltering defences into the iron storm, now pouring
  forth its deadly wrath upon that rocky plateau which <i>must</i> be crossed
  in defiance of everything.</p>

  <p>"Steady, men," he observes once more, as he forms them for the desperate
  effort; "we'll have them <i>out of that</i> in ten minutes. Now, my lads!
  Forward, and follow me!"</p>

  <p>The cocked hat is waving amongst the smoke&mdash;the daring Colonel is
  forward under the very guns&mdash;with a British cheer, the Forlorn Hope dash
  eagerly on, comrade encouraging comrade, side by side, shoulder to
  shoulder&mdash;hearts throbbing wild and high, and a grip of iron on good
  "Brown Bess." Men live a lifetime in a few such moments. There are two
  brothers in that doomed band who have not met for years&mdash;they quarrelled
  in their hot youth over their father's grave, about the quiet orchard and the
  peaceful homestead that each had since longed so painfully to see once more;
  and now they have served, with half the globe between them, and each believes
  the other to have forgotten him, and the orchard and the homestead have
  passed away from their name for ever. They would weep and be friends if they
  could meet again. There are but four men between them at this moment, and two
  are down, stark and dead, and two are dragging their mangled bodies slowly to
  the rear, and the brothers are face to face under the fatal batteries of the
  Redan.</p>

  <p>"Is't thou, my lad?" is all the greeting that passes in that wild moment;
  but the blackened hands meet with a convulsive clasp, and they are brothers
  once more, as when, long ago, they hid their sturdy little faces in their
  mother's gown. Thank God for that! In another minute it would have been too
  late, for Bill is down, shot through the lungs, his white belts limp and
  crimson with blood; and John, with a tear in his eye, and something betwixt
  an oath and a prayer upon his lips, is rushing madly on, for the cocked hat
  is still waving forward amongst the smoke. and the Colonel is still cheering
  them after him into the jaws of death.</p>

  <p>But soldiers, even British soldiers, are but men, and the fire grows so
  deadly that the attacking force cannot but be checked in its headlong charge.
  The line breaks&mdash;wavers&mdash;gives way&mdash;the awful glacis is
  strewed with dead and dying&mdash;groans and curses, and shrieks for
  "<i>water! water!</i>" mingle painfully with the wild cheers, and the
  trampling feet, and the thunder of the guns; but volumes of smoke, curling
  low and white over the ground, veil half the horrors of that ghastly scene;
  yet through the smoke can be discerned some three or four figures under the
  very parapet of the Redan, and the cocked hat and square frame of the Colonel
  are conspicuous amongst the group.</p>

  <p>It must have been a strange sight for the few actors that reached it
  alive. A handful of men, an officer or two, a retiring enemy, a place half
  taken, and an eager longing for reinforcements to complete the victory.</p>

  <p>An aide-de-camp is despatched to the rear; he starts upon his mission to
  traverse that long three hundred yards, swept by a deadly cross-fire, that
  blackens and scorches the very turf beneath his feet. Down he goes headlong,
  shot through the body ere he has "run the gauntlet" for a third of the way.
  Another and another share the same fate! What is to be done? The case is
  urgent, yet doubtful; it demands promptitude, yet requires consideration. Our
  Colonel is a man who never hesitates or wavers for an instant. He calls up a
  young officer of the line, one of the few survivors on the spot; even as he
  addresses him, the rifleman on his right lurches heavily against him, shot
  through the loins, and a red-coated comrade on his left falls dead at his
  feet, yet the Colonel is, if possible, cooler and more colloquial than
  ever.</p>

  <p>"What's your name, my young friend?" says he, shaking the ashes from a
  short black pipe with which he has been refreshing himself at intervals with
  much apparent zest. The officer replies, somewhat astonished, yet cool and
  composed as his commander. The Colonel repeats it twice over, to make sure he
  has got it right, glances once more at the enemy, then looking his new
  acquaintance steadily in the face, observes&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Do I seem to be in a <i>funk</i>, young man?"</p>

  <p>"No," replies the young officer, determined not to be outdone, "not the
  least bit of one, any more than myself."</p>

  <p>The Colonel laughs heartily. "Very well," says he; "now, if I'm shot, I
  trust to you to do me justice. I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I must
  communicate with my supports. Every aide-de-camp I send gets knocked over.
  I'm no use here alone&mdash;I can't take the Redan single-handed&mdash;so I'm
  going back myself. It's only three hundred yards, but I can't run quite so
  fast as I used, so if I'm killed, I shall expect you to bear witness that I
  didn't go voluntarily into that cross-fire because <i>I was afraid</i>."</p>

  <p>The young officer promised, and the Colonel started on his perilous
  errand. On the success of his mission or the tactics of that attack it is not
  my province to enlarge. Amongst all the conflicting opinions of the public,
  there is but one as to the daring gallantry and cool promptitude displayed on
  that memorable day by the leader of the assault.</p>

  <p>Every man, however, moves in his own little world, even at the taking of
  Sebastopol. It was not for a nameless stranger, holding no rank in the
  service, to run into needless danger, and I was merely in the trenches as a
  looker-on, therefore did I keep sedulously under cover and out of fire. It is
  only the novice who exposes himself unnecessarily, and I had served too long
  with Omar Pasha not to appreciate the difference between the cool,
  calculating daring that willingly accepts a certain risk to attain a certain
  object, and the vainglorious foolhardiness that runs its head blindly against
  a wall for the mere display of its own intrinsic absurdity.</p>

  <p>That great general himself was never known to expose his life
  unnecessarily. He would direct the manoeuvres of his regiments, and display
  the tactics for which he was so superior, at a safe distance from the fire of
  an enemy, as long as he believed himself sufficiently near to watch every
  movement, and to anticipate every stratagem of the adversary; but if it was
  advisable to encourage his own troops with his presence, to head a charge, or
  rally a repulse, who so daring and so reckless as the fortunate Croatian
  adventurer?</p>

  <p>And yet, with all my care and all my self-denial&mdash;for indeed, on
  occasions such as these, curiosity is a powerful motive, and there is a
  strange instinct in man's wilful heart that urges him into a fray&mdash;I had
  a narrow escape of my own life, and lost my oldest friend and comrade during
  the progress of the attack.</p>

  <p>I was gazing eagerly through my double glasses&mdash;the very same that
  had often done me good service in such different scenes&mdash;to watch the
  forms of those devoted heroes who were staggering and falling in the smoke,
  when a stray shell, bursting in the trench behind me, blew my forage-cap from
  my head, and sent it spinning over the parapet on to the glacis beyond.
  Involuntarily I stretched my hand to catch at it as it flew away, and Bold,
  who had been crouching quietly at my heel, seeing the motion, started off in
  pursuit. Ere I could check him, the old dog was over the embankment, and in
  less than a minute returned to my side with the cap in his mouth. The men
  laughed, and cheered him as he laid it at my feet.</p>

  <p>Poor Bold! poor Bold! he waved his handsome tail, and reared his great
  square head as proudly as ever; but there was a wistful expression in his eye
  as he looked up in my face, and when I patted him the old dog winced and
  moaned as if in pain. He lay down, though quite gently, at my feet, and let
  me turn him over and examine him. I thought so&mdash;there it was, the small
  round mark in his glossy coat, and the dark stain down his thick
  foreleg&mdash;my poor old friend and comrade, must I lose you too? Is
  everything to be taken from me by degrees? My eyes were blinded with
  tears&mdash;the rough soldiers felt for me, and spared my favourite some
  water from their canteens; but he growled when any one offered to touch him
  but myself, and he died licking my hand.</p>

  <p>Even in the turmoil and confusion of that wild scene I could mourn for
  Bold. He was the one link with my peaceful boyhood, the one creature that she
  and I had both loved and fondled, and now <i>she</i> was lost to me for ever,
  and Bold lay dead at my feet. Besides, I was fond of him for his own
  sake&mdash;so faithful, so true, so attached, so brave and devoted&mdash;in
  truth, I was very, <i>very</i> sorry for poor Bold.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch40"
     name="ch40"></a>CHAPTER XL. &mdash; THE WAR-MINISTER AT HOME</h2>

  <p class="first">Except at the crisis of great convulsions, when the man with
  the bayonet is the only individual that clearly knows what he has got to do
  and how to do it, the soldier is but the puppet upon the stage, while the
  diplomatist pulls the strings from behind the scenes. Before Sebastopol the
  armies of England, France, and Sardinia keep watch and ward, ever ready for
  action; at Vienna, the spruce <i>attach&eacute;</i> deciphers and makes his
  <i>pr&eacute;cis</i> of those despatches which decide the soldier's fate. Is
it to
  be peace or war? Has Russia entered into a league with the Austrian
  Government, or is the Kaiser, in his youthful enthusiasm, eager for an appeal
  to arms, and forgetful of his defenceless capital, not thirty leagues from
  the Polish frontier, and innocent of a single fortified place between its
  walls and the enemy, prepared to join heart and hand with France and England
  against the common foe? These are questions everybody asks, but nobody seems
  able to answer. On the Bourse they cause a deal of gambling, and a
  considerable fluctuation in the value of the florin as computed with
  reference to English gold. Minor capitalists rise and fall, and Rothschild
  keeps on adding heap to heap. Money makes money, in Austria as in England;
  nor are those moustached and spectacled merchants smoking cigars on the
  Bourse one whit less eager or less rapacious than our own smooth speculators
  on the Stock Exchange. The crowd is a little more motley, perhaps, and a
  little more demonstrative, but the object is the same.</p>

  <p>"And what news have you here this morning, my dear sir?" observes a
  quiet-looking, well-dressed bystander who has just strolled in, to a
  plethoric individual, with a double chin, a double eye-glass, and a red
  umbrella, who is making voluminous entries in a huge pocket-book. The
  plethoric man bows to the ground, and becomes exceedingly purple in the
  face.</p>

  <p>"None, honourable sir, none," he replies, with a circular sweep of his hat
  that touches his toes; "the market is flat, honourable sir, flat, and money,
  if possible, scarcer than usual."</p>

  <p>Whereat the stout man laughs, but breaks off abruptly, as if much alarmed
  at the liberty he has taken. The well-dressed gentleman turns to some one
  else with the same inquiry, and, receiving a less cautious answer, glances at
  his fat friend, who pales visibly under his eye. They are all afraid of him
  here, for he is no other than our old acquaintance, Monsieur Stein, clean,
  quiet, and undemonstrative as when we saw him last in the drawing-room at
  Edeldorf. Let us follow him as he walks out and glides gently along the
  street in his dark, civil attire, relieved only by a bit of ribbon at the
  button-hole.</p>

  <p>All great men have their weaknesses. Hercules, resting from his labours,
  spun yarns with Omphale; Antony combined fishing and flirtation; Person loved
  pale ale, and refreshed himself copiously therewith; and shall not Monsieur
  Stein, whose Protean genius can assume the characters of all these heroes,
  display his taste for the fine arts in so picturesque a capital as his own
  native Vienna? He stops accordingly at a huge stone basin ornamenting one of
  its squares, and, producing his note-book, proceeds to sketch with masterly
  touches the magnificent back and limbs of that bronze Triton preparing to
  launch his harpoon into the depths below. Sly Monsieur Stein! is it thus you
  spread your nets for the captivation of unwary damsels, and are you always
  rewarded by so ready a prey as that well-dressed <i>soubrette</i> who is
  peeping on tiptoe over your shoulder, and expressing her artless admiration
  of your talent in the superlative exclamations of her Teutonic idiom?</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, honourable sir, that I so bold am, as so to overlook your
  wondrously-beautiful design, permit me to see it a little nearer. I thank
  you, love-worthy sir."</p>

  <p>Monsieur Stein is too thoroughly Austrian not to be the pink of
  politeness. He doffs his hat, and hands her the note-book with a bow. As she
  returns it to him an open letter peeps between the leaves, and they part and
  march off on their several ways with many expressions of gratitude and
  politeness, such as two utter strangers make use of at the termination of a
  chance acquaintanceship; yet is the <i>soubrette</i> strangely like
  Jeannette, Princess Vocqsal's <i>femme de chambre</i>; and the letter which
  Monsieur Stein reads so attentively as he paces along the sunny side of the
  street, is certainly addressed to that lady in characters bearing a strong
  resemblance to the handwriting of Victor, Count de Rohan.</p>

  <p>Monsieur Stein pockets the epistle&mdash;it might be a receipt for
  <i>sour-krout</i> for all the effect its perusal has on his impassible
  features&mdash;and proceeds, still at his equable, leisurely pace, to the
  residence of the War-Minister.</p>

  <p>While he mounts the steps to the second floor, on which are situated the
  apartments of that functionary, and combs out his smooth moustaches, waiting
  the convenience of the porter who answers the bell, let us take a peep
  inside.</p>

  <p>The War-Minister is at his wit's end. His morning has been a sadly
  troubled one, for he has been auditing accounts, to which pursuit he
  cherishes a strong disinclination, and he has received a letter from the
  Minister of the Interior, conveying contradictory orders from the Emperor, of
  which he cannot make head or tail. Besides this, he has private annoyances of
  his own. His intendant has failed to send him the usual supplies from his
  estates in Galicia; he is in debt to his tailor and his coach-maker, but he
  must have new liveries and an English carriage against the next Court ball;
  his favourite charger is lame, and he does not care to trust himself on any
  of his other horses; and, above all, he has sustained an hour's lecture this
  very morning, when drinking coffee in his dressing-gown, from Madame la
  Baronne, his austere and excellent spouse, commenting in severe terms on his
  backslidings and general conduct, the shortcomings of which, as that virtuous
  dame affirms, have not failed to elicit the censure of the young Emperor
  himself. So the War-Minister has drunk three large tumblers of
  <i>schwartz-bier</i>, and smoked as many cigars stuck up on end in the bowl
  of a meerschaum pipe, the combined effects of which have failed to simplify
  the accounts, or to reconcile the contradictory instructions of the
  Court.</p>

  <p>He is a large, fine-looking man, considerably above six feet in height.
  His grey-blue uniform is buttoned tightly over a capacious chest, covered
  with orders, clasps, and medals; his blue eyes and florid complexion denote
  health and good-humour, not out of keeping with the snowy moustaches and hair
  of some three-score winters. He looks completely puzzled, and is bestowing an
  uneasy sort of attention, for which he feels he must ere long be taken to
  task, upon a very charming and well-dressed visitor of the other sex, no less
  a person, indeed, than that "<i>odious intrigante</i>," as Madame la Baronne
  calls her, the Princess Vocqsal.</p>

  <p>She is as much at home here in the War-Minister's apartments as in her own
  drawing-room. She never loses her <i>aplomb</i>, or her presence of mind. If
  his wife were to walk in this minute she would greet her with amiable
  cordiality; and, to do Madame la Baronne justice, though she abuses the
  Princess in all societies, her greeting would be returned with the warmth and
  kindness universally displayed to each other by women who hate to the death.
  Till she has got her antagonist <i>down</i>, the female fencer never takes
  the button off her foil.</p>

  <p>"You are always so amiable and good-humoured, my dear Baron," says the
  Princess, throwing back her veil with a turn of her snowy wrist, not lost
  upon the old soldier, "that you will, I am sure, not keep us in suspense. The
  Prince wishes his nephew to serve the Emperor; he is but a boy yet. Will he
  be tall enough for the cavalry? A fine man looks so well on horseback!"</p>

  <p>The Baron was justly proud of his person. This little compliment and the
  glance that accompanied it were not thrown away. He looked pleased, then
  remembered his wife, and looked sheepish, then smoothed his moustache, and
  inquired the age of the candidate.</p>

  <p>"Seventeen next birthday," replied the Princess. "If it were not for this
  horrid war we would send him to travel a little. Do you think the war will
  last, Monsieur le Baronne?" added she, na vely.</p>

  <p>"You must ask the Foreign Minister about that," replied he, completely
  thrown off his guard by her innocence. "We are only soldiers here, we do not
  pull the strings, Madame. We do what we are told, and serve the Emperor and
  the ladies," he added, with a low bow and a leer.</p>

  <p>"Then will you put him into the Cuirassiers immediately, Monsieur?" said
  the Princess, with her sweetest smile; "we wish no time to be lost&mdash;now
  <i>do</i>, to please <i>me</i>."</p>

  <p>The Baron was rather in a dilemma; like all men in office, he hated to
  bind himself by a promise, but how to refuse that charming woman
  anything?&mdash;at last he stammered out&mdash;"Wait a little, Madame, wait,
  and I will do what I can for you; it is impossible just now, for we are going
  to reduce the army by sixty thousand men."</p>

  <p>While he spoke, Monsieur Stein was announced, and the Princess rose to
  take her leave; she had got all she wanted now, and did not care to face a
  thousand Baronesses. As she went downstairs, she passed Monsieur Stein
  without the slightest mark of recognition, and he, too, looked admiringly
  after her, as if he had never seen her before. The Baron, by this time pining
  for more <i>schwartz-bier</i>, and another cigar, devoutly hoped his new
  visitor, with whose person and profession he was quite familiar, would not
  stay long; and the Princess, as she tripped past the <i>Huissier</i> at the
  entrance, muttered, "Sixty thousand men&mdash;then it <i>will</i> be peace: I
  thought so all along. My poor Baron! what a soft old creature you are! Well,
  I have tried everything now, and this speculating is the strongest excitement
  of all, even better than making Victor jealous!" but she sighed as she said
  it, and ordered her coachman to drive on at once to her stock-broker.</p>

  <p>The presence of Monsieur Stein did not serve to re-establish either the
  clear-headedness or the good-humour of the War-Minister. The ostensible
  errand on which he came was merely to obtain some trifling military
  information concerning the garrison at Pesth, without which the co-operation
  of the police would not have been so effectual, in annoying still further the
  already exasperated Hungarians; but in the course of conversation, Monsieur
  Stein subjected the Baron to a process familiarly called "sucking the
  brains," with such skill that, ere the door was closed on his unwelcome
  visitor, the soldier felt he had placed himself&mdash;as indeed was
  intended&mdash;completely in the power of the police-agent. All his sins of
  omission and commission, his neglect of certain contracts, and his issuing of
  certain orders; his unpardonable lenity at his last tour of inspection, his
  unlucky expression of opinions at direct variance with those of his young
  Imperial master:&mdash;all these failures and offences he felt were now
  registered in letters never to be effaced,&mdash;on the records of Monsieur
  Stein's secret report; and what was more provoking still, was to think that
  he had, somehow or another, been insensibly led on to plead guilty to
  half-a-dozen derelictions, which he felt he might as consistently have
  denied.</p>

  <p>As he sat bolt upright in his huge leathern chair, and turned once more to
  "sublime tobacco" for consolation and refreshment, his thoughts floated back
  to the merry days when he was young and slim, and had no cares beyond his
  squadron of Uhlans, no thought for the morrow but the parade and the ball.
  "Ah!" sighed the Baron to himself as he knocked the ash off his cigar with a
  ringed fore-finger, "I would I were a youngling again; the troop-accounts
  were easily kept, the society of my comrades was pleasanter than the Court.
  One never meets with such beer now as we had at Debreczin; and oh! those
  Hungarian ladies, how delightful it was to waltz before one grew fat, and
  flirt before one grew sage. I might have visited the charming Princess then,
  and no one would have found fault with me; no one would have
  objected&mdash;Heigh-ho! there was no Madame la Baronne in those
  days&mdash;<i>now</i> it is so different. <i>Sapperment</i>! Here she
  comes!"</p>

  <p>Though the Baron was upwards of six feet, and broad in
  proportion&mdash;though he had distinguished himself more than once before
  the enemy, and was covered with orders of merit and decorations for
  bravery&mdash;nay, though he was the actual head of the six hundred thousand
  heroes who constituted the Austrian army, he quailed before that little
  shrivelled old woman, with her mouth full of black teeth, and her hair
  dressed <i>&agrave; l'Imp&eacute;ratrice</i>.</p>

  <p>We profane not the mysteries of Hymen&mdash;"Caudle" is a name of no
  exclusive nationality. We leave the Baron, not without a shudder, to the
  salutary discipline of his excellent monitress.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch41"
     name="ch41"></a>CHAPTER XLI. &mdash; WHEELS WITHIN WHEELS</h2>

  <p class="first">We must follow Monsieur Stein, for that worthy has got
  something to do; nay, he generally has his hands full, and cannot, indeed, be
  accused of eating the bread of idleness. It is a strange system of
  government, that of the Austrian empire; and is, we believe, found to answer
  as badly as might be expected from its organisation. The State takes so
  paternal an interest in the sayings and doings of its children, as to judge
  it expedient to support a whole staff of officials, whose sole duty it is to
  keep the Government informed respecting the habits, actions, everyday life,
  and secret thoughts and opinions of the general public. Nor do these
  myrmidons, whose number exceeds belief, and who add seriously to the national
  expenditure, fail to earn their pay with praiseworthy diligence. In all
  societies, in all places of pleasure or business, where half-a-dozen people
  may chance to congregate, <i>there</i> will be an agent of police, always in
  plain clothes, and generally the least conspicuous person in the throng. The
  members of this corps are, as may be supposed, chosen for their general
  intelligence and aptitude, are usually well-informed, agreeable men, likely
  to lead strangers into conversation, and excellent linguists. As an instance
  of their ubiquity, I may mention an incident that occurred within my own
  knowledge to an officer in the British service, when at Vienna, during the
  war. That officer was dining in the <i>salon</i> of an hotel, and there were
  present, besides his own party, consisting of Englishmen, and one Hungarian
  much disaffected to the Government, only two other strangers, sitting quite
  at the farther extremity of the room, and apparently out of ear-shot. The
  conversation at my friend's table was, moreover, carried on in English, and
  turned upon the arrest of a certain Colonel Trr by the Austrian authorities
  at Bucharest, a few days previously.</p>

  <p>This Colonel Trr, be it known, was a Hungarian who had deserted from the
  Austrian service, and entering that of her Majesty Queen Victoria, had been
  employed in some commissariat capacity in Wallachia, and taken prisoner at
  Bucharest by the very regiment to which he had previously belonged. The
  question was much vexed and agitated at the time, as to the Austrian right
  over a deserter on a neutral soil, and Colonel Trr became for the nonce an
  unconscious hero. The officer to whom I have alluded, having listened
  attentively to the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> of the case, as set forth by
  his friends, dismissed the subject with military brevity, in these
  words:&mdash;"If you say he deserted his regiment before an enemy, I don't
  care what countryman he is, or in whose service, <i>the sooner they hang him
  the better!</i>" This ill-advised remark, be it observed, was made <i>sotto
  voce</i>, and in his own language. His surprise may be imagined when, on
  perusing the Government papers the following morning, he read the whole
  conversation, translated into magniloquent German, and detailed at length as
  being the expressed opinion of the British army and the British public on the
  case of Colonel Trr.</p>

  <p>I am happy to be able to observe, <i>en passant</i>, that the latter
  gentleman was not hanged at all, but escaped, after a deal of diplomatic
  correspondence, with a six weeks' imprisonment in the fortress of Comorn, and
  has since been seen taking his pleasure in London and elsewhere.</p>

  <p>To return to Monsieur Stein. It is evening, and those who have permission
  from the police to give a party, have lighted their lamps and prepared their
  saloons for those receptions in which the well-bred of all nations, and
  particularly the ladies, take so incomprehensible a delight. At Vienna, every
  house must be closed at ten o'clock; and those who wish to give balls or
  evening parties must obtain a direct permission to do so, emanating from the
  Emperor himself. So when they <i>do</i> go out, they make the most of it, and
  seem to enjoy the pleasure with an additional zest for the prohibition to
  which it is subject.</p>

  <p>Let us follow Monsieur Stein into that brilliantly-lighted room, through
  which he edges his way so unobtrusively, and where, amongst rustling
  toilettes, crisp and fresh from the dressmaker, and various uniforms on the
  fine persons of the Austrian aristocracy, his own modest attire passes
  unobserved. This is no <i>bourgeois</i> gathering, no assemblage of the
  middle rank, tainted by mercantile enterprise, or disgraced by talent, which
  presumes to rise superior to <i>blood</i>. No such thing; they are all the
  "<i>haute vol&eacute;e</i>" here, the "<i>cr&egrave;me de la
cr&egrave;me</i>," as they themselves
  call it in their bad French and their conventional jargon. Probably Monsieur
  Stein is the only man in the room that cannot count at least sixteen
  quarterings&mdash;no such easy matter to many a member of our own House of
  Peers; and truth to tell, the Austrian aristocracy are a personable,
  fine-looking race as you shall wish to see. Even the eye of our imperturbable
  police-agent lights up with a ray of what in any other eye would be
  admiration, at the scene which presents itself as he enters. The rooms are
  spacious, lofty, and magnificently furnished in the massive, costly style
  that accords so well with visitors in full dress. The floors are beautifully
  inlaid and polished; as bright, and nearly as slippery, as ice. The walls are
  covered with the <i>chef d'oeuvres</i> of the old masters, and even the
  dome-like ceilings are decorated with mythological frescoes, such as would
  convert an enthusiast to paganism at once. Long mirrors fill up the
  interstices between the panellings, and reflect many a stalwart gallant, and
  many a "lady bright and fair." There is no dancing, it is merely a
  "reception"; and amongst the throng of beauties congregated in that assembly,
  impassible Monsieur Stein cannot but admit that the most captivating of them
  all is Princess Vocqsal.</p>

  <p>So thinks the War-Minister, who, forgetful of accounts and
  responsibilities, regardless even of the threatening glances darted at him
  from the other end of the room by his excellent wife, is leaning over the
  back of the Princess's seat, and whispering, in broad Viennese German, a
  variety of those soft platitudes which gentlemen of three-score are apt to
  fancy will do them as good service at that age as they did thirty years ago.
  The Baron is painfully agreeable, and she is listening, with a sweet smile
  and a pleasant expression of countenance, assumed for very sufficient
  reasons. In the first place, she owes him a good turn for the information
  acquired this morning, and the Princess always pays her debts when it costs
  her nothing; in the second, she wishes, for motives of her own, to strengthen
  her influence with the Court party as much as possible; and lastly, she
  enjoys by this means the innocent pleasure of making two people
  unhappy&mdash;viz. Madame la Baronne, who is fool enough to be jealous of her
  fat old husband; and one other watching her from the doorway, with a pale,
  eager face, and an expression of restless, gnawing anxiety, which it is
  painful to behold.</p>

  <p>Victor de Rohan, what are you doing here, like a moth fluttering round a
  candle? wasting your time, and breaking your heart for a woman that is not
  worth one throb of its generous life-blood; that cannot appreciate your
  devotion, or even spare your feelings? Why are you not at Edeldorf, where you
  have left <i>her</i> sad and lonely, one tear on whose eyelash is worth a
  thousand of the false smiles so freely dealt by that heartless, artificial,
  worn woman of the world? For shame, Victor! for shame! And yet, as our friend
  the Turk says, "<i>Kismet</i>! It is destiny!"</p>

  <p>He is dressed in a gorgeous Hussar uniform, his own national costume, and
  right well does its close fit and appropriate splendour become the stately
  beauty of the young Count de Rohan. At his side hangs the very sword that
  flashed so keenly by the waters of the Danube, forward in the headlong charge
  of old Iskender Bey. On its blade is engraved the Princess's name; she knows
  it as well as he does, yet ten to one she will pretend to forget all about
  it, should he allude to the subject to-night. Ah! the blade is as bright as
  it was in those merry campaigning days, but Victor's face has lost for ever
  the lightsome expression of youth; the lines of passion and self-reproach are
  stamped upon his brow, and hollowed round his lip, and he has passed at one
  stride from boyhood to middle age.</p>

  <p>He makes a forced movement, as though to speak to her, but his button is
  held by a jocose old gentleman, whose raptures must find vent on the
  engrossing topic of Marie Taglioni's graceful activity; and he has to weather
  the whole person and draperies of a voluminous German dowager ere he can
  escape from his tormentor. In the meantime Monsieur Stein has been presented
  to the Princess, and she allows him to lead her into the tea-room, for a cup
  of that convenient beverage which continental nations persist in considering
  as possessed of medicinal virtue.</p>

  <p>"I have the unhappiness to have escaped Madame's recollection," observed
  the police-agent, as he placed a chair for the Princess in a corner secure
  from interruption, and handed her cup; "it is now my good fortune to be able
  to restore something that she has lost," and he looked at her with those keen
  grey eyes, as though to read her very soul, while he gave her the letter
  which had been placed in his pocket-book by faithless Jeannette. "If she
  cares for him," thought Monsieur Stein, "she will surely show it now, and I
  need take no further trouble with <i>her</i>. If not, she is the very woman I
  want, for the fool is madly in love with her, and upon my word it is not
  surprising!"</p>

  <p>Monsieur Stein looked at women with hypercritical fastidiousness, but, as
  he himself boasted, at the same time, quite "<i>en philosophe</i>."</p>

  <p>The Princess, however, was a match for the police-agent; she never winced,
  or moved a muscle of her beautiful countenance. With a polite "Excuse me,"
  she read the letter through from beginning to end, and turning quietly round
  inquired, "How came you by this, Monsieur?"</p>

  <p>Unless it leads to a <i>revoke</i>, a lie counts for nothing with a
  police-agent, so he answered at once, "Sent to my <i>bureau</i> from the
  office, in consequence of an informality in the post-mark."</p>

  <p>"You have read it?" pursued the Princess, still calm and unmoved.</p>

  <p>"On my honour, no!" answered he, with his hand on his heart, and a low
  bow.</p>

  <p>She would have made the better spy of the two, for she could read even his
  impassible face, and she knew as well as he did himself that he had, so she
  quietly returned him the letter, of which she judged, and rightly, that he
  had kept a copy; and laying her gloved hand on his sleeve, observed, with an
  air of bewitching candour&mdash;"After that affair at Comorn, you and I can
  have no secrets from each other, Monsieur. Tell me frankly what it is that
  your employers require, and the price they are willing to pay for my
  co-operation."</p>

  <p>She could not resist the temptation of trying her powers, even on Monsieur
  Stein; and he, although a police-agent, was obliged to succumb to that low,
  sweet voice, and the pleading glance by which it was accompanied. A little
  less calmly than was his wont, and with almost a flush upon his brow, he
  began&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You are still desirous of that appointment we spoke of yesterday for the
  Prince?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Ma foi</i>, I am," she answered, with a merry smile; "without it we
  shall be ruined, for we are indeed overwhelmed with debt."</p>

  <p>"You also wish for the earliest intelligence possessed by the Government
  as to the issues of peace and war?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I do, my dear Monsieur Stein; how else can I speculate to
  advantage?"</p>

  <p>"And you would have the attainder taken off your cousin's estates in the
  Banat in your favour?"</p>

  <p>The Princess's eyes glistened, and a deep flush overspread her face. This
  was more than she had ever dared to hope for. This would raise her to
  affluence, nay, to splendour, once again. No price would be too great to pay
  for this end, and she told Monsieur Stein so, although she kept down her
  raptures and stilled her beating heart the while.</p>

  <p>"All this, Princess, I can obtain for you," said he; "all this has been
  promised me, and I have got it in writing. In less than a month the
  Government will have redeemed its pledge, and in return you shall do us one
  little favour."</p>

  <p>"<i>C'est un trahison, n'est ce pas?</i>" she asked quickly, but without
  any appearance of shame or anger; "I know it by the price you offer. Well, I
  am not scrupulous&mdash;say on."</p>

  <p>"Scarcely that," he replied, evidently emboldened by her coolness; "only a
  slight exertion of feminine influence, of which no woman on earth has so much
  at command as yourself. Listen, Princess; in three words I will tell you all.
  Count de Rohan loves you passionately&mdash;madly. You know it
  yourself;&mdash;forgive my freedom; between you and me there must be no
  secrets. You can do what you will with him."&mdash;(He did not see her blush,
  for she had turned away to put down her cup.)&mdash;"He will refuse you
  nothing. This is your task:&mdash;there is another conspiracy hatching
  against the Government; its plot is not yet ripe, but it numbers in its ranks
  some of the first men in Hungary. Your compatriots are very stanch; even I
  can get no certain information. Several of the disaffected are yet unknown to
  me. Young Count de Rohan has a list of their names; that list I trust to you
  to obtain. Say, Princess, is it a bargain?"</p>

  <p>She was fitting her glove accurately to her taper fingers.</p>

  <p>"And the man that you were good enough to say adores me so devotedly,
  Monsieur," she observed, without lifting her eyes to his face, "what will you
  do with him? shoot him as you did his cousin in 1848?"</p>

  <p>"He shall have a free pardon," replied the police-agent, "and permission
  to reside on his lands. He is not anxious to leave the vicinity of the
  Waldenberg, I believe," he added mischievously.</p>

  <p>"<i>Soit</i>," responded the Princess, as she rose to put an end to the
  interview. "Now, if you will hand me my bouquet we will go into the other
  room."</p>

  <p>As he bowed and left her, Monsieur Stein felt a certain uncomfortable
  misgiving that he had been guilty of some oversight in his game. In vain he
  played it all again in his own head, move for move, and check for check; he
  could not detect where the fault lay, and yet his fine instinct told him that
  somewhere or another he had made a mistake. "It is all that woman's
  impassible face," he concluded at last, in his mental soliloquy, "that
  forbids me to retrieve a blunder or detect an advantage. And what a beautiful
  face it is!" he added almost aloud, as for an instant the official was
  absorbed in the man.</p>

  <p>In the meantime Victor was getting very restless, very uncomfortable, and,
  not to mince matters, very cross.</p>

  <p>No sooner had the Princess returned to the large <i>salon</i> than he
  stalked across the room, twirling his moustaches with an air of unconcealed
  annoyance, and asked her abruptly, "How she came to know that ill-looking
  Monsieur Stein, and why he had been flirting with her for the last half-hour
  in the tea-room?"</p>

  <p>"That gentleman in plain clothes?" answered she, with an air of utter
  unconsciousness and perfect good-humour; "that is one of my ancient friends,
  Monsieur le Comte; shall I present him to you?"</p>

  <p>This was another refined method of tormenting her lovers. The Princess had
  one answer to all jealous inquiries as to those whom she favoured with her
  notice&mdash;"<i>Un de mes anciens amis</i>," was a vague and general
  description, calculated to give no very definite or satisfactory information
  to a rival.</p>

  <p>"Have a care, Madame," whispered Victor angrily; "you will make some of
  your ancient friends into your deadliest enemies if you try them so far."</p>

  <p>She looked lovingly up at him, and he softened at once.</p>

  <p>"Now it is <i>you</i> that are unkind, Victor," she said in a low soft
  voice, every tone of which thrilled to the young Count's heart. "Why will you
  persist in quarrelling with me? I, who came here this very evening to see you
  and to do you a kindness?"</p>

  <p>"Did you know I should be in Vienna so soon?" he exclaimed eagerly. "Did
  you receive my letter?"</p>

  <p>"I did, indeed," she replied, with a covert smile, as she thought of the
  mode in which that missive had reached her, and she almost laughed outright
  (for the Princess had a keen sense of the ludicrous) at the strange
  impersonation made by Monsieur Stein of Cupid's postman; "but, Victor," she
  added, with another beaming look, "I go away to-morrow. Very early in the
  morning I must leave Vienna."</p>

  <p>He turned paler than before, and bit his lip. "So I might as well have
  stayed at home," he exclaimed in a voice of bitter annoyance and pique, none
  the less bitter that it had to be toned down to the concert pitch of good
  society. "Was it to see you for five minutes here in a crowd that I travelled
  up so eagerly and in such haste? To make my bow, I suppose, like the merest
  acquaintance, and receive my <i>cong&eacute;</i>. Pardon, Madame la
Princesse, I
  need not receive it twice. I wish you good-evening; I am going now!"</p>

  <p>She, too, became a shade paler, but preserved the immovable good-humour on
  which she piqued herself, as she made him a polite bow, and turned round to
  speak to the Russian Minister, who, covered with orders, at that moment came
  up to offer his obeisance to the well-known Princess Vocqsal. Had he not
  constant advices from his intriguing Court to devote much of his spare time
  to this fascinating lady? And had she not once in her life baffled all the
  wiles of St. Petersburg, and stood untempted by its bribes? Ill-natured
  people affirmed that another Power paid a higher price, which accounted
  satisfactorily for the lady's patriotism, but the Autocrat's Minister had his
  secret orders notwithstanding.</p>

  <p>And now she is deep in a lively argument, in which polished sarcasm and
  brilliant repartee are bandied from lip to lip, each pointed phrase eliciting
  a something better still from the Princess's soft mouth, till her
  audience&mdash;diplomatists of many years' standing, warriors shrewd in
  council and dauntless in the field, grey ambassadors and beardless
  <i>attach&eacute;s</i>&mdash;hang enraptured on her accents, and watch her
looks
  with an unaccountable fascination; whilst Victor de Rohan, hurt, moody, and
  discontented, stalks fiercely to the doorway and mutters to himself, "Is it
  for this I have given up home, friends, honour, and self-respect? To be a
  mere puppet in the hands of a coquette, a woman's plaything, and not even a
  favourite plaything, after all!"</p>

  <p>Ladies have a peculiar gift which is enjoyed by no other members of the
  creation whatsoever. We allude to that extraordinary property by which,
  without any exertion of the visual organs, they can discern clearly all that
  is going on above, below, around, and behind them. If a man wants to
  <i>see</i> a thing he requires to <i>look at it</i>. Not so with the other
  sex. Their subtler instinct enables them to detect that which must be made
  palpable to <i>our</i> grosser senses. How else could Princess Vocqsal, whose
  back was turned to him, and who was occupied in conversation with the
  <i>&eacute;lite</i> of Austrian diplomatic society, arrive at the certainty
that
  Victor was not gone, as he had threatened&mdash;that he still lingered
  unwillingly about the doorway, and now hailed as deliverers those prosy
  acquaintances from whom, in the early part of the evening, he had been so
  impatient to escape?</p>

  <p>And yet he despised himself for his want of manhood and resolution the
  while; and yet he reproached himself with his slavish submission and unworthy
  cowardice; and yet he lingered on in hopes of one more glance from her eye,
  one more pressure from her soft gloved hand. He had parted with her in anger
  before, and too well he knew the bitter wretchedness of the subsequent hours;
  he had not fortitude enough, he <i>dared</i> not face such an ordeal
  again.</p>

  <p>So she knew he was not going yet; and, confident in her own powers,
  pleased with her position, and proud of her conquests, she sparkled on.</p>

  <p>"That's a clever woman," said an English <i>attach&eacute;</i> to his
friend, as
  they listened in the circle of her admirers.</p>

  <p>And the friend, who was a little of a satirist, a little of a philosopher,
  a little of a poet, and yet, strange to say, a thorough man of the world,
  replied&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Too clever by half, my boy, or I'm very much mistaken. Ninety-nine women
  out of a hundred are natural-born angels, but the hundredth is a devil
  incarnate, and <i>that's</i> her number, Charlie, you may take my word for
  it!"</p>

  <p>And now a strange movement rises in that crowded assembly. A buzz of
  voices is heard&mdash;lower, but more marked than the ordinary hum of
  conversation. Something seems to have happened. A lady has fainted, or an
  apoplectic general been taken suddenly ill, or a candelabrum has fallen, and
  the magnificent hotel is even now on fire? None of these casualties, however,
  have occurred. Voices rise higher in question and reply. "Is it
  true?"&mdash;"I can't believe it!"&mdash;"They knew nothing of it to-day on
  the Bourse."&mdash;"Another stock-jobbing report."&mdash;"Immense loss on
  both sides." These are the disjointed sentences that reach the ear, mingled
  with such terms as the Malakhoff&mdash;the Redan&mdash;the north
  side&mdash;General Pelissier, etc. etc. English and French diplomatists
  exchange curious glances, and at length rumour takes a definite form, and it
  is boldly asserted that intelligence has that day arrived of the fall of
  Sebastopol.</p>

  <p>Tongues are loosened now. Surmise and speculation are rife upon future
  events. Men speak as they wish, and notwithstanding the presence of Monsieur
  Stein and several other secret agents of police, many a bold opinion is
  hazarded as to the intentions of the Government and the issues of the great
  contest. Princess Vocqsal scarcely breathes while she listens. If, indeed,
  this should lead to peace, her large investments will realise golden profits.
  She feels all the palpitating excitement of the gambler, yet does the hue not
  deepen on her cheek, nor the lustre kindle brighter in her eye. Monsieur
  Stein, who alone knows her secrets, as it is his business to know the secrets
  of every one, feels his very soul stirred within him at such noble
  self-command.</p>

  <p>For a moment he thinks that were he capable of human weaknesses he could
  <i>love</i> that woman; and in pure admiration, as one who would fain prove
  still further a beautiful piece of mechanism, he steps up to the Princess,
  and informs her that "Now, indeed, doubt is at an end, for reliable
  intelligence has arrived that Sebastopol has fallen!"</p>

  <p>"Sebastopol has fallen," she repeats with her silver laugh; "then the war
  has at last really begun!"</p>

  <p>Her audience applaud once more. "<i>Ma foi, ce n'est pas mal</i>," says
  the French Minister, and Monsieur Stein is on the verge of adoration; but
  there is by this time a general move towards the door: carriages are being
  called, and it is time to go away, the departure of the guests being somewhat
  accelerated by the important news which has just been made public. Victor is
  still lingering on the staircase. Many a bright eye looks wistfully on his
  handsome form, many a soft heart would willingly waken an interest in the
  charming young Count de Rohan, but the Hungarian has caught the malady in its
  deadliest form&mdash;the "love fever," as his own poets term it, is wasting
  his heart to the core, and for him, alas! there is but one woman on earth,
  and she is coming downstairs at this moment, attended by the best-dressed and
  best-looking <i>attach&eacute;</i> of the French Legation.</p>

  <p>Somewhat to this young gentleman's disgust, she sends him to look for her
  carriage, and taking Victor's arm, which he is too proud to offer, she bids
  him lead her to the cloak-room, and shawl her as he used to do with such
  tender care.</p>

  <p>He relents at once. What <i>is</i> there in this woman that she can thus
  turn and twist him at her will? She likes him best thus&mdash;when he is
  haughty and rebellious, and she fears that at last she may have driven him
  too far and have lost him altogether; the uncertainty creates an interest and
  excitement, which is pleasure akin to pain, but it is so delightful to win
  him back again,&mdash;<i>such</i> a triumph to own him and tyrannise over him
  once more! It is at moments of reconciliation such as these that the Princess
  vindicates her woman-nature, and becomes a very woman to the heart.</p>

  <p>"You are angry with me, Victor," she whispers, leaning heavily on his arm,
  and looking downwards as she speaks; "angry with me, and without a cause. You
  would not listen to me an hour ago, you were so cross and impatient. Will you
  listen to me now?"</p>

  <p>The tears were standing in the strong man's eyes. "Speak on," he said;
  "you do with me what you like, I could listen to you for ever."</p>

  <p>"You were irritated because I told you I was about to leave Vienna. You
  have avoided me the whole evening, and left me to be bored and annoyed by
  that wearisome tribe of diplomatists, with their flat witticisms and their
  eternal politics. Why did you not stay to hear me out? Victor, it is true I
  go to-morrow, but I go to the Waldenberg."</p>

  <p>How changed his face was now; his eye sparkled and his whole countenance
  lightened up. He looked like a different man. He could only press the arm
  that clung to his own; he could not speak.</p>

  <p>"Will you continue to <i>bouder</i> me?" proceeded the Princess in a
  playful, half-malicious tone; "or will you forgive me and be friends for that
  which is, after all, your own fault? Oh, you men! how hasty and violent you
  are; it is lucky we are so patient and so good-tempered. The Waldenberg is
  not so very far from Edeldorf. You might ask me there for your <i>jour de
  f&ecirc;te</i>. I have not forgotten it, you see. Not a word more, Count de
Rohan;
  I must leave you now. Here is my carriage. Adieu,&mdash;no, not adieu, <i>mon
  ami, au revoir</i>!"</p>

  <p>Why was it such a different world to Victor from what it had been ten
  short minutes ago, from what it would assuredly be the next time they met,
  and her caprice and <i>coquetterie</i> were again exhibited to drive him
  wild? Was it worth all these days of uncertainty and anxious longing; all
  these fits of jealousy and agonies of self-reproach; to be deliriously happy
  every now and then for a short ten minutes? Was any woman on earth worthy of
  all that Victor de Rohan sacrificed for the indulgence of his guilty love?
  Probably not, but it would have been hard to convince him. He was not as wise
  as Solomon; yet Solomon, with all his wisdom, seems to have delivered himself
  up a willing captive to disgrace and bondage&mdash;fettered by a pair of
  white arms&mdash;held by a thread of silken hair. Oh, vanity of vanities!
  "<i>this is</i> also vanity and vexation of spirit."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch42"
     name="ch42"></a>CHAPTER XLII. &mdash; "TOO LATE"</h2>

  <p class="first">For a wounded campaigner on crutches, or a wasted
  convalescent slowly recovering from an attack of Crimean fever, there are few
  better places for the re-establishment of health than the hotel at Therapia.
  It is refreshing to hear the ripple of the Bosphorus not ten feet distant
  from one's bedroom window; it is life itself to inhale the invigorating
  breeze that sweeps down, unchecked and uncontaminated, from the Black Sea; it
  is inspiriting to gaze upon the gorgeous beauty of the Asiatic coast, another
  continent not a mile away. And then the smaller accessories of comfortable
  apartments, good dinners, civilised luxuries, and European society, form no
  unwelcome contrast to the Crimean tent, the soldier's rations, and the
  wearisome routine of daily and hourly duty.</p>

  <p>But a few days after the taking of Sebastopol, I was once more in Turkey.
  Ropsley, the man of iron nerves and strong will&mdash;the man whom danger had
  spared, and sickness had hitherto passed by, was struck down by
  fever&mdash;that wasting, paralysing disease so common to our countrymen in
  an Eastern climate&mdash;and was so reduced and helpless as to be utterly
  incapable of moving without assistance. He had many friends, for Ropsley was
  popular in his regiment and respected throughout the army; but none were so
  thoroughly disengaged as I; it seemed as if I could now be of little use in
  any capacity, and to my lot it fell to place my old school-fellow on board
  ship, and accompany him to Therapia, <i>en route</i> for England on sick
  leave.</p>

  <p>My own affairs, too, required that I should revisit Somersetshire before
  long. The wreck of my father's property, well nursed and taken care of by a
  prudent man of business, had increased to no contemptible provision for a
  nameless child. If I chose to return to England, I should find myself a
  landed proprietor of no inconsiderable means, should be enabled to assume a
  position such as many a man now fighting his way in the world would esteem
  the acme of human felicity, and for me it would be but dust and ashes! What
  cared I for broad acres, local influence, good investments, and county
  respectability&mdash;all the outward show and empty shadows for which people
  are so apt to sacrifice the real blessings of life? What was it to me that I
  might look round from my own dining-room on my own domain, with my own
  tenants waiting to see me in the hall? An empty heart can have no
  possessions; a broken spirit is but a beggar in the midst of wealth, whilst
  the whole universe, with all its glories, belongs alone to him who is at
  peace with himself. I often think how many a man there is who lives out his
  three-score years and ten, and never knows what <i>real</i> life is, after
  all. A boyhood passed in vain aspirations&mdash;a manhood spent in struggling
  for the impossible&mdash;an old age wasted in futile repinings, such is the
  use made by how many of our fellow-creatures of that glorious streak of light
  which we call existence, that intervenes between the eternity which hath
  been, and the eternity which shall be? Oh! to lie down and rest, and look
  back upon the day's hard labour, and feel that something has been
  wrought&mdash;that something has been <i>won!</i> and so to sleep&mdash;happy
  here&mdash;happy for evermore. Well, on some natures happiness smiles even
  here on earth&mdash;God forbid it should be otherwise!&mdash;and some must
  content themselves with duty instead. Who knows which shall have the best of
  it when all is over? For me, it was plain at this period that I must do my
  <i>devoir</i>, and leave all to Time, the great restorer in the moral, as he
  is the great destroyer in the physical, world. The years of excitement (none
  know how strong) that I had lately passed, followed by a listless, hopeless
  inactivity, had produced a reaction on my spirits which it was necessary to
  conquer and shake off. I resolved to return to England, to set my house in
  order&mdash;to do all the good in my power, and first of all, strenuously to
  commence with that which lay nearest my hand, although it was but the humble
  task of nursing my old school-fellow through an attack of low fever.</p>

  <p>My patient possessed one of those strong and yet elastic natures which
  even sickness seems unable thoroughly to subdue. The Ropsley on a couch of
  suffering and lassitude, was the same Ropsley that confronted the enemy's
  fire so coolly in the Crimea, and sneered at the follies of his friends so
  sarcastically in St. James's street. Ill as he was, and utterly prostrated in
  body, he was clear-headed and ready-witted as ever. With the help of a
  wretchedly bad grammar, he was rapidly picking up Turkish, by no means an
  easy language for a beginner; and, taking advantage of my society, was
  actually entering upon the rudiments of Hungarian, a tongue which it is next
  to impossible for any one to acquire who has not spoken it, as I had done, in
  earliest childhood. He was good-humoured and patient, too, far more than I
  should have expected, and was never anxious or irritable, save about his
  letters. I have seen him, however, turn away from a negative to the eager
  inquiry "Any letters for me?" with an expression of heart-sick longing that
  it pained me to witness on that usually haughty and somewhat sneering
  countenance.</p>

  <p>But it came at last. Not many mornings after our arrival at Therapia there
  was a letter for Ropsley, which seemed to afford him unconcealed
  satisfaction, and from that day the Guardsman mended rapidly, and began to
  talk of getting up and packing his things, and starting westward once
  more.</p>

  <p>So it came to pass that, with the help of his servant, I got him out of
  bed and dressed him, and laid him on the sofa at the open window, where he
  could see the light ca ques dancing gaily on the waters, and the restless
  sea-fowl flitting eternally to and fro, and could hear the shouts of the
  Turkish boatmen, adjuring each other, very unnecessarily, not to be too
  hasty; and the discordant cries of the Greek population scolding, and
  cheating, and vociferating on the quay.</p>

  <p>We talked of Hungary. I loved to talk of it now, for was it not <i>her</i>
  country of whom I must think no more? And Ropsley's manner was kinder, and
  his voice softer, than I had ever thought it before. Poor fellow! he was weak
  with his illness, perhaps, yet hitherto I had remarked no alteration in his
  cold, impassible demeanour.</p>

  <p>At last he took my hand, and in a hollow voice he said&mdash;"Vere, you
  have returned me good for evil. You have behaved to me like a brother. Vere,
  I believe you really are a Christian!"</p>

  <p>"I hope so," I replied quietly, for what had I but that?</p>

  <p>"Yes," he resumed, "but I don't mean conventionally, because your
  godfathers and godmothers at your baptism said you were&mdash;I mean
  <i>really</i>. I don't believe there is a particle of <i>humbug</i> about
  you. Can you forgive your enemies?"</p>

  <p>"I have already told you so," I answered; "don't you remember that night
  in the trenches? besides, Ropsley, I shall never consider you my enemy."</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what cuts me to the heart," he replied, flushing up over
  his wan, wasted face. "I have injured you more deeply than any one on earth,
  and I have received nothing but kindness in return. Often and often I have
  longed to tell you all&mdash;how I had wronged you, and how I had repented,
  but my pride forbade me till to-day. It is dreadful to think that I might
  have died, and never confessed to you how hard and how unfeeling I have been.
  Listen to me, and then forgive me if you can. Oh, Vere, Vere! had it not been
  for me and my selfishness, you might have married Constance Beverley!"</p>

  <p>I felt I was trembling all over; I covered my face with my hands and
  turned away, but I bade him go on.</p>

  <p>"Her father was never averse to you from the first. He liked you, Vere,
  personally, and still more for the sake of your father, his old friend. There
  was but one objection. I need not dwell upon it; and even that he could have
  got over, for he was most anxious to see his daughter married, and to one
  with whom he could have made his own terms. He was an unscrupulous man, Sir
  Harry, and dreadfully pressed for money. When in that predicament people will
  do things that at other times they would be ashamed of, as I know too well.
  And the girl too, Vere, she loved you&mdash;I am sure of it&mdash;she loved
  you, poor girl, with all her heart and soul."</p>

  <p>I looked him straight in the face&mdash;"Not a word of <i>her</i>,
  Ropsley, as you are a gentleman!" I said. Oh, the agony of that moment! and
  yet it was not all pain.</p>

  <p>"Well," he proceeded, "Sir Harry consulted me about the match. You know
  how intimate we were, you know what confidence he had in my judgment. If I
  had been generous and honourable, if I had been such a man as <i>you</i>,
  Vere, how much happier we should all be now; but no, I had my own ends in
  view, and I determined to work out my own purpose, without looking to the
  right or left, without turning aside for friend or foe. Besides, I hardly
  knew you then, Vere. I did not appreciate your good qualities. I did not know
  your courage, and constancy, and patience, and kindliness. I did not know
  yours was just the clinging, womanly nature, that would never get over the
  crushing of its best affections&mdash;and I know it now too well. Oh, Vere,
  you never can forgive me! And yet," he added, musingly, more to himself than
  to me,&mdash;"and yet, even had I known all this, had you been my own
  brother, I fear my nature was then so hard, so pitiless, so uncompromising,
  that I should have gone straight on towards my aim, and blasted your
  happiness without scruple or remorse. <i>Remorse</i>," and the old look came
  over him, the old sneering look, that wreathed those handsome features in the
  wicked smile of a fallen angel&mdash;"if a man means to <i>repent</i> of what
  he has done, he had better not <i>do it</i>. My maxim has always been, 'never
  look back,'&mdash;'<i>vestigia, nulla retrorsum</i>'&mdash;and yet to-day I
  cannot help retracing, ay, and bitterly <i>regretting</i>, the past.</p>

  <p>"I have told you I had my own ends in view. I wished to marry the heiress
  myself. Not that I loved her, Vere&mdash;do not be angry with me for the
  confession&mdash;I never loved her the least in the world. She was far too
  placid, too conventional, too like other girls, to make the slightest
  impression on me. My ideal of a woman is, a bold, strong nature, a keen
  intellect, a daring mind, and a dazzling beauty that others must fall down
  and worship. I never was one of your sentimentalists. A violet may be a very
  pretty flower, and smell very sweet, but I like a camellia best, and all the
  better because you require a hothouse to raise it in. But, if I did not care
  for Miss Beverley, I cared a good deal for Beverley Manor, and I resolved
  that, come what might, Beverley Manor should one day be mine. The young lady
  I looked upon as an encumbrance that must necessarily accompany the estate.
  You know how intimate I became with her father, you know the trust he reposed
  in me, and the habit into which he fell, of doing nothing without my advice.
  That trust, I now acknowledge to you, I abused shamefully; of that habit I
  took advantage, solely to further my own ends, totally irrespective of my
  friend. He confided to me in very early days his intention of marrying his
  daughter to the son of his old friend. He talked it over with me as a scheme
  on which he had set his heart, and, above all, insisted on the advantage to
  himself of making, as he called it, his own terms with you about settlements,
  etc. I have already told you he was involved in difficulties, from which his
  daughter's marriage could alone free him, with the consent of her husband. I
  need not enter into particulars. I have the deeds and law papers at my
  fingers' ends, for I like to understand a business thoroughly if I embark on
  it at all, but it is no question of such matters now. Well, Vere, at first I
  was too prudent to object overtly to the plan. Sir Harry, as you know, was an
  obstinate, wilful man, and such a course would have been the one of all
  others most calculated to wed him more firmly than ever to his original
  intention; but I weighed the matter carefully with him day by day, now
  bringing forward arguments in favour of it, now starting objections, till I
  had insensibly accustomed him to consider it by no means as a settled affair.
  Then I tried all my powers upon the young lady, and there, I confess to you
  freely, Vere, I was completely foiled. She never liked me even as an
  acquaintance, and she took no pains to conceal her aversion. How angry she
  used to make me sometimes!&mdash;I <i>hated</i> her so, that I longed to make
  her mine, if it were only to humble her, as much as if I had loved her with
  all my heart and soul. Many a time I used to grind my teeth and mutter to
  myself, 'Ah! my fair enemy, I shall live to make you rue this treatment;' and
  I swore a great oath that, come what might, she should never belong to Vere
  Egerton. I even tried to create an interest in her mind for Victor de Rohan,
  but the girl was as true as steel. I have been accustomed to read characters
  all my life, women's as well as men's, it is part of my profession;" and
  Ropsley laughed once more his bitter laugh; "and many a trifling incident
  showed me that Constance Beverley cared for nobody on earth but you. This
  only made me more determined not to be beat; and little by little, with hints
  here and whispers there, assisted by your own strange, solitary habits, and
  the history of your poor father's life and death, I persuaded Sir Harry that
  there was madness in your family, and that you had inherited the curse. From
  the day on which he became convinced of this, I felt I had won my race. No
  power on earth would then have induced him to let you marry his daughter, and
  the excuse that he made you on that memorable afternoon, when you had so
  gallantly rescued her from death, was but a gentlemanlike way of getting out
  of his difficulty about telling you the real truth. Vere, that girl's courage
  is wonderful. She came down to dinner that night with the air of an empress,
  but with a face like marble, and a dull, stony look in her eyes that made
  even me almost rue what I had done. She kept her room for a fortnight
  afterwards, and I cannot help feeling she has never looked as bright
  since.</p>

  <p>"When you went away I acknowledge I thought the field was my own. In
  consideration of my almost ruining myself to preserve him from shame, Sir
  Harry promised me his daughter if I could win her consent, and you may depend
  upon it I tried hard to do so. It was all in vain; the girl hated me more and
  more, and when we all met so unexpectedly in Vienna, I saw that my chance of
  Beverley Manor was indeed a hopeless one. Sir Harry, too, was getting very
  infirm. Had he died before his daughter's marriage, his bills for the money I
  had lent him were not worth the stamps on which they were drawn. My only
  chance was her speedy union with some one rich enough to make the necessary
  sacrifices, and again I picked out Victor de Rohan as the man. We all thought
  then you were engaged to his sister Val&eacute;rie."</p>

  <p>Ropsley blushed scarlet as he mentioned that name.</p>

  <p>"And it was not my part to conceal the surmise from Miss Beverley. 'She
  was <i>so</i> glad, she was <i>so</i> thankful,' she said, 'she was
  <i>so</i>happy, for Vere's sake'; and a month afterwards she was Countess de
  Rohan, with the handsomest husband and the finest place in Hungary. It was a
  <i>mariage de convenance</i>, I fear, on both sides. I know now, what I allow
  I did not dream of then, that Victor himself was the victim of an unfortunate
  attachment at the time, and that he married the beautiful Miss Beverley out
  of pique. Sir Harry died, as you know, within three months. I have saved
  myself from ruin, and I have destroyed the happiness on earth of three people
  that never did me the slightest harm. Vere, I do not deserve to be forgiven,
  I do not deserve ever to rise again from this couch; and yet there is
  <i>one</i> for whose sake I would fain get well&mdash;<i>one</i> whom I
  <i>must</i> see yet again before I die."</p>

  <p>He burst into tears as he spoke. Good heaven! this man was mortal after
  all&mdash;an erring, sinful mortal, like the rest of us, with broken pride,
  heartfelt repentance, thrilling hopes and fears. Another bruised reed, though
  he had stood so defiant and erect, confronting the whirlwind and the
  thunderbolt, but shivered up, and cowering at the whisper of the "still small
  voice." Poor fellow! poor Ropsley! I pitied him from my heart, while he hid
  his face in his hands, and the big tears forced themselves through his wasted
  fingers; freely I forgave him, and freely I told him so.</p>

  <p>After a time he became more composed, and then, as if ashamed of his
  weakness, assumed once more the cold satirical manner, half sarcasm, half
  pleasantry, which has become the conventional disguise of the world in which
  such men as Ropsley delight to live. Little by little he confided to me the
  rise and progress of his attachment to Val&eacute;rie&mdash;at which I had
already
  partly guessed&mdash;acknowledged how, for a long time, he had imagined that
  I was again a favoured rival, destined ever to stand in his way; how my
  sudden departure from Vienna and her incomprehensible indifference to that
  hasty retreat had led him to believe that she had entertained nothing but a
  girl's passing inclination for her brother's comrade; and how, before he
  reached his regiment in the Crimea, she had promised to be his on the
  conclusion of the war. "I never cared for any other woman on earth," said
  Ropsley, once more relapsing into the broken accents of real, deep feeling.
  "I never reflected till I knew her, what a life mine has been. God forgive
  me, Vere; if we had met earlier, I should have been a different man. I have
  received a letter from her to-day. I shall be well enough to move by the end
  of the week. Vere, I <i>must</i> go through Hungary, and stop at Edeldorf on
  my way to England!"</p>

  <p>As I walked out to inhale the evening breeze and indulge my own thoughts
  in solitude by the margin of the peaceful Bosphorus, I felt almost stunned,
  like a man who has sustained a severe fall, or one who wakes suddenly from an
  astounding dream. And yet I might have guessed long ago at the purport of
  Ropsley's late revelations. Diffident as I was of my own merits, there had
  been times when my heart told me, with a voice there was no disputing, that I
  was beloved by Constance Beverley; and now it was with something like a
  feeling of relief and exhilaration that I recalled the assurance of that fact
  from one himself so interested and so difficult to deceive as Ropsley. "And
  she loved me all along," I thought, with a thrill of pleasure, sadly dashed
  with pain. "She was true and pure, as I always thought her; and even now,
  though she is wedded to another, though she never can be mine on earth,
  perhaps&mdash;" And here I stopped, for the cold, sickening impossibility
  chilled me to the marrow, and an insurmountable barrier seemed to rise up
  around me and hem me in on every side. It was sin to love her, it was sin to
  think of her now. Oh! misery! misery! and yet I would give my life to see her
  once more! So my good angel whispered in my ear, "You must never look on her
  again; for the rest of your time you must tread the weary path alone, and
  learn to be kindly, and pure, and holy for <i>her</i> sake." And self
  muttered, "Where would be the harm of seeing her just once again?&mdash;of
  satisfying yourself with your own eyes that she is happy?&mdash;of learning
  at once to be indifferent to her presence? You <i>must</i> go home. Edeldorf
  lies in your direct road to England; you cannot abandon Ropsley in his
  present state, with no one to nurse and take care of him. Victor is your
  oldest friend, he would be hurt if you did not pay him a visit. It would be
  more courageous to face the Countess at once, and get it over." And I
  listened now to one and now to the other, and the struggle raged and tore
  within me the while I paced sadly up and down "by the side of the sounding
  sea."</p>

  <p>"Egerton! how goes it? Let me present to you my friends," exclaimed a
  voice I recognised on the instant, as, with lowered head and dreamy vision, I
  walked right into the centre of a particularly smart party, and was "brought
  up," as the sailors say, "all standing," by a white silk parasol and a mass
  of flounces that almost took my breath away. When you most require solitude,
  it generally happens that you find yourself forced into society, and with all
  my regard for our <i>ci-devant</i> usher, I never met Manners, now a jolly
  Colonel of Bashi-Bazouks, with so little gratification as at this moment. I
  am bound to admit, however, that on his side all was cordiality and delight.
  Dressed out to the utmost magnificence of his gorgeous uniform, spurs
  clanking, and sabretasche jingling, his person stouter, his beard more
  exuberant, his face more florid and prosperous than ever, surrounded, too, by
  a bevy of ladies of French extraction and Pera manners, the "soldier of
  fortune," for such he might fairly be called, was indeed in his glory. With
  many flourishes and compliments in bad French, I was presented successively
  to Mesdemoiselles Philippine, and Josephine, and Seraphine, all dark-eyed,
  black-haired, sallow-faced, but by no means bad-looking, young ladies, all
  apparently bent upon the capture and destruction of anything and everything
  that came within range of their artillery, and all apparently belonging
  equally to my warlike and fortunate friend. He then took me by the arm, and
  dropping behind the three graces aforesaid, informed me, in tones of
  repressed exultation, how his fortune was made at last, how he now commanded
  (the dearest object of his ambition) a regiment of actual cavalry, and how he
  was on the eve of marriage with one of the young ladies in front of us, with
  a dowry of a hundred thousand francs, who loved him to distraction, and was
  willing to accompany him to Shumla, there to take the lead in society, and
  help him to civilise his regiment of Bashi-Bazouks.</p>

  <p>"I always told you I was fit for something, Egerton," said
  Lieutenant-Colonel Manners, with a glow of exultation on his simple face;
  "and I have made my own way at last, in despite of all obstacles. It's pluck,
  sir, that makes the man! pluck and <i>muscle</i>," doubling his arm as he
  spoke, in the old Everdon manner. "I have done it at last, and you'll see, my
  dear Egerton, I shall live to be a general."</p>

  <p>"I hope from my heart you may," was my reply, as I bade him "farewell,"
  and congratulated him on his position, his good fortune, and his bride;
  though I never made out exactly whether it was Mademoiselle Josephine, or
  Philippine, or Seraphine who was to enjoy the unspeakable felicity of
  becoming Mrs. Colonel Manners.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch43"
     name="ch43"></a>CHAPTER XLIII. &mdash; "THE SKELETON"</h2>

  <p class="first">It is one of the conventional grievances of the world to
  mourn ever the mutability of human affairs, the ever-recurring changes
  incidental to that short span of existence here which we are pleased to term
  Life, as if the scenes and characters with which we are familiar were always
  being mingled and shifted with the rapidity and confusion of a pantomime. It
  has often struck me that the circumstances which encircle us do <i>not</i> by
  any means change with such extraordinary rapidity and facility&mdash;that,
  like a French road, with its mile after mile of level fertility and unvarying
  poplars, our path is sometimes for years together undiversified by any great
  variety of incident, any glimpse of romance; and that the same people, the
  same habits, the same pleasures, and the same annoyances seem destined to
  surround and hem us in from the cradle to the grave. Which is the most
  numerous class, those who fear their lot <i>may</i> change, or those who hope
  it <i>will</i>? Can we make this change for ourselves? Are we the slaves of
  circumstances, or is not that the opportunity of the strong which is the
  destiny of the weak? Surely it must be so&mdash;surely the stout heart that
  struggles on must win at last&mdash;surely man is a free agent; and he who
  fails, fails not because his task is impossible, but that he himself is faint
  and weak and infatuated enough to hope that he alone will be an exception to
  the common lot, and achieve the prize without the labour, <i>Sine pulvere
  palma</i>.</p>

  <p>The old castle at Edeldorf, at least, is but little changed from what I
  recollect it in my quiet boyhood, when with my dear father I first entered
  its lofty halls and made acquaintance with the beautiful blue-eyed child that
  now sits at the end of that table, a grown-up, handsome man. Yes, once more I
  am at Edeldorf. Despite all my scruples, despite all the struggles between my
  worse and better self, I could not resist the temptation of seeing her in her
  stately home; of satisfying myself with my own eyes that she was happy, and
  of bidding her a long and last farewell. Oh! I thirsted to see her just once
  again, only to see her, and then to go away and meet her never, never more.
  Therefore Ropsley and I journeyed through Bulgaria and up the Danube, and
  arrived late at Edeldorf, and were cordially welcomed by Victor, and dressed,
  and came down to dinner, and so I saw her.</p>

  <p>She was altered, too; so much altered, and yet it was the well-known face,
  <i>her</i> face still; but there were lines on the white forehead I
  remembered once so smooth and fair, and the eyes were sunk and the cheek pale
  and fallen; when she smiled, too, the beautiful lips parted as sweetly as
  their wont, but the nether one quivered as though it were more used to
  weeping than laughing, and the smile vanished quickly, and left a deeper
  shadow as it faded. She was not happy. I was <i>sure</i> she was not happy,
  and shall I confess it? the certainty was not to me a feeling of unmixed
  pain. I would have given every drop of blood in my body to make her so, and
  yet I could not grieve as I felt I ought to grieve, that it was
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>Perhaps one of the greatest trials imposed on us by the artificial state
  of society in which we live, is the mask of iron that it forces us to wear
  for the concealment of all the deeper and stronger feelings of our nature.
  There we sit in that magnificent hall, hung around with horn of stag and tusk
  of boar, and all the trophies of the chase, waited on by Hungarian retainers
  in their gorgeous hussar uniforms, before a table heaped to profusion with
  the good things that minister to the gratification of the palate, and
  conversing upon those light and frivolous topics beyond which it is treason
  to venture, while the hearts probably of every one of us are far, far distant
  in some region of pain unknown and unguessed by all save the secret
  sufferers, who hide away their hoarded sorrows under an exterior of flippant
  levity, and affect to ignore their neighbour's wounds as completely as they
  veil their own. What care Ropsley or Val&eacute;rie whether <i>perdrix aux
  champignons</i> is or is not a better thing than <i>dindon aux truffes</i>?
  They are dying to be alone with each other once more&mdash;she, all anxiety
  to hear of his campaign and his illness; he, restless and preoccupied till he
  can tell her of his plans and prospects, and the arrangements that must be
  concluded before he can make her his own. Both, for want of a better
  grievance, somewhat disgusted that the order of precedence in going to dinner
  has placed them opposite each other, instead of side by side. And yet
  Val&eacute;rie, who sits by me, seems well pleased to meet her old friend
once more;
  if I had ever thought she really cared for me, I should be undeceived now,
  when I mark the joyous frankness of her manner, the happy blush that comes
  and goes upon her cheek, and the restless glances that ever and anon she
  casts at her lover's handsome face through the epergne of flowers and fruit
  that divides them. No, they think as little of the ball of conversation which
  we jugglers toss about to each other, and jingle and play with and despise,
  as does the pale stately Countess herself, with her dark eyes and her dreamy
  look apparently gazing far into another world. She is not watching Victor,
  she seems scarcely aware of his presence: and yet many a young wife as
  beautiful, as high-spirited, and as lately married, would sit uneasily at the
  top of her own table, would frown, and fret, and chafe to see her handsome
  husband so preoccupied by another as is the Count by the fair guest on his
  right hand&mdash;who but wicked Princess Vocqsal?</p>

  <p>That lady has, according to custom, surrounded herself by a system of
  fortification wherewith, as it were, she seems metaphorically to set the
  world at defiance: a challenge which, to do her justice, the Princess is ever
  ready to offer, the antagonist not always willing to accept. She delights in
  being the object of small attentions, so she invariably requires a footstool,
  an extra cushion or two, and a flask of eau de Cologne, in addition to her
  bouquet, her fan, her gloves, her pocket-handkerchief, and such necessary
  articles of female superfluity. With these outworks and fences within which
  to retire on the failure of an attack, it is easy to carry out a system of
  aggressive warfare; and whether it is the presence of his wife that makes the
  amusement particularly exciting, or whether Count de Rohan has made himself
  to-day peculiarly agreeable, or whether it is possible, though this
  contingency is extremely unlikely, that the Prince has <i>told her not</i>,
  certainly Madame la Princesse is taking unusual pains, and that most
  unnecessarily, to bring Victor into more than common subjection to her
  fascinations.</p>

  <p>She is without contradiction the best-dressed woman in the room; her light
  gossamer robe, fold upon fold, and flounce upon flounce, floats around her
  like a drapery of clouds; her gloves fit her to a miracle; her
  exquisitely-shaped hands and round white arms bear few ornaments, but these
  are of the rarest and costliest description; her blooming, fresh complexion
  accords well with those luxuriant masses of soft brown hair escaping here and
  there from its smooth shining folds in large glossy curls. Her rich red lips
  are parted with a malicious smile, half playful, half coquettish, that is
  inexpressibly provoking and attractive; while, although the question as to
  whether she does really rouge or not is still undecided, her blue eyes seem
  positively to dance and sparkle in the candle-light. Her voice is low, and
  soft, and silvery; all she says racy, humorous, full of meaning, and to the
  point. Poor Victor de Rohan!</p>

  <p>He, too, is at first in unusually high spirits; his courteous, well-bred
  manner is livelier than his wont, but the deferential air with which he
  responds to his neighbour's gay remarks is dashed by a shade of sarcasm, and
  I, who know him so well, can detect a tone of bitter irony in his voice, can
  trace some acute inward pang that ever and anon convulses for a moment his
  frank, handsome features. I am sure he is ill at ease, and dissatisfied with
  himself. I observe, too, that, though he scarcely touches the contents of his
  plate, his glass is filled again and again to the brim, and he quaffs off his
  wine with the eager feverish thirst of one who seeks to drown reflection and
  remorse in the Lethean draught. Worst sign of all, and one which never fails
  to denote mental suffering, his spirits fall in proportion to his potations,
  and that which in a well-balanced nature "makes glad the heart of man," seems
  but to clog the wings of Victor's fancy, and to sink him deeper and deeper in
  despondency. Ere long he becomes pale, silent, almost morose, and the
  charming Princess has all the conversation to herself.</p>

  <p>But one individual in the party attends thoroughly to the business in
  hand. Without doubt, for the time being he has the best of it. Prince Vocqsal
  possesses an excellent appetite, a digestion, as he says himself, that, like
  his conscience, can carry a great weight and be all the better for it; a
  faultless judgment in wine, and a tendency to enjoy the pleasures of the
  table, enhanced, if possible, by the occasional fit of gout with which this
  indulgence must unfortunately be purchased. Fancy-free is the Prince, and
  troubled neither by memories of the past, misgivings for the present, nor
  anxieties for the future. Many such passive natures there are&mdash;we see
  them every day. Men who are content to take the world as it is, and, like the
  ox in his pasture, browse, and bask, and ruminate, and never wish to overleap
  the boundary that forbids them to wander in the flowery meadow beyond. And
  yet it may be that these too have once bathed in the forbidden stream, the
  lava-stream that scorches and sears where it touches; it may be that the
  heart we deem so hard, so callous, has been welded in the fire, and beaten on
  the anvil, till it has assumed the consistency of steel. It winced and
  quivered once, perhaps nearly broke, and now it can bid defiance even to the
  memory of pain. Who knows? who can tell his neighbour's history, or guess his
  neighbour's thoughts? who can read the truth, even in the depth of those eyes
  that look the fondest into his own? Well! there is One that knows all
  secrets, and He will judge, but not as man judges.</p>

  <p>So Prince Vocqsal thinks not of the days that are past, the hearts he has
  broken, the friends he has lost, the duels he has fought, the money he has
  squandered, the chances he has thrown away; or, if he does allow his mind to
  dwell for an instant on such trifles, it is with a sort of dreamy
  satisfaction at the quantity of enjoyment he has squeezed out of life, tinged
  with a vague regret that so much of it is over. Why, it was but to-day that,
  as he dressed for dinner, he apostrophised the grimacing image in his
  looking-glass,&mdash;"Courage, <i>mon gaillard</i>," muttered the Prince,
  certainly not to his valet, who was tightening his waistbelt, "courage! you
  are worth a good many of the young ones, still, and your appetite is as good
  as it was at sixteen."</p>

  <p>He is splendid now, though somewhat apoplectic. His wig curls over his
  magnificent head in hyacinthine luxuriance, his dyed whiskers and moustache
  blush purple in the candlelight; his neckcloth is tied somewhat too tight,
  and seems to have forced more than a wholesome quantity of blood into his
  face and eyes, but its whiteness is dazzling, and the diamond studs beneath
  it are of extraordinary brilliance; nor does his waistbelt, though it defies
  repletion, modify in any great degree the goodly outline of the corpulent
  person it enfolds. Altogether he is a very jolly-looking old gentleman, and
  the only one of the party that seems for the nonce to be "the right man in
  the right place."</p>

  <p>Constance listens to him with a weary, abstracted air; perhaps she has
  heard that story about the bear and the waterfall once or twice before,
  perhaps she does not hear it now, but she bends her head courteously towards
  him, and looks kindly at him from out of her deep, sad eyes.</p>

  <p>"Champagne, if you please," says the Prince, interrupting the thread of
  his narrative, by holding up his glass to be replenished; "and so, Madame,
  the bear and I were <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> at about ten paces apart, and my
rifle
  was empty. The last shot had taken effect through his lungs, and he coughed
  and held his paw to the pit of his stomach, so like a Christian with a cold,
  that, even in my very precarious position, I could not help laughing
  outright. Ten paces is a short distance, Madame, a very short distance, when
  your antagonist feels himself thoroughly aggrieved, and advances upon you
  with a red, lurid eye, and a short angry growl. I turned and looked behind me
  for a run&mdash;I was always a good runner," remarks the Prince, with a
  downward glance of satisfaction, the absurdity of which, I am pained to see,
  does not even call a smile to his listener's pale face&mdash;"but it was no
  question of running here, for the waterfall was leaping and foaming forty
  feet deep below, and the trees were so thick on either side, that escape by a
  flank movement was impossible. It was the very spot, Victor, where I killed
  the woodcocks right and left the morning you disappointed me so shamefully,
  and left me to have all the sport to myself."&mdash;Victor bows courteously,
  drinks her husband's health, and glances at the Princess with a bitter
  smile.&mdash;"The very spot where I hope you will place me to-morrow at your
  grand <i>chasse</i>. Peste! 'tis strange how passionately fond I still am of
  the chase. Well, Madame, indecision is not usually my weakness, but before I
  could make up my mind what to do, the bear was upon me. In an instant he
  embraced me with his huge hairy arms, and I felt his hot breath against my
  very face. My rifle was broken short off by the stock, and I heard my watch
  crack in my waistcoat pocket. I thought it was my ribs. I have seen your
  wrestlers in England, Madame, and I have once assisted in your country at an
  exhibition of '<i>The Box</i>' but such an encounter as I now had to sustain
  was more terrible than anything I ever witnessed fought out fairly between
  man and man. Fortunately a ball through the back part of the head, and
  another through the lungs, had somewhat diminished the natural force of my
  adversary, or I must have succumbed; and by a great exertion of strength on
  my part, I managed to liberate one hand and make a grasp for my
  hunting-knife. Horror! it had fallen from the sheath, but by the mercy of
  Heaven and the blessing of St. Hubert, it had caught in my boot, and I never
  felt before how dear life was as when I touched the buckhorn handle of my
  last friend; three, four times in succession I buried the long keen blade in
  the bear's side; at each thrust he gave a quick, convulsive sob, but he
  strained me tighter and tighter to his body, till I thought my very
  blood-vessels would burst with the fearful pressure. At last we fell, and
  rolled over and over towards the waterfall. In the hasty glance I had
  previously cast behind me, I had remarked a dead fir-tree that stood within a
  yard or so of the precipice; I remember the thought had darted through my
  mind, that if I could reach it I might be safe, and the reflection as
  instantaneously followed, that a bear was a better climber than a Hungarian.
  Never shall I forget my sensations when, in our last revolution, I caught a
  glimpse of that naked tree. I shut my eyes then, for I knew it was all over,
  but I gave him one more stab, and a hearty one, with my hunting-knife.
  Splash! we reached the water together, and went down like a couple of stones,
  down, down to the very bottom, but fortunately it was the deepest part of the
  pool, and we unclosed our embrace the instant we touched the
  surface&mdash;the bear, I believe, was dead before he got there, and I
  thought myself fortunate in being able to swim ashore, whilst the brown body
  of my late antagonist went tumbling and whirling down the foaming torrent
  below. I recovered his skin, Madame, to make a cover for my arm-chair, but I
  have never been fond of water since. Give me a glass of Tokay, if you
  please."</p>

  <p>"And did you sustain no further harm from your encounter?" asked
  Constance, rousing herself from her abstraction with an effort, and bending
  politely towards the Prince, who was drinking his Tokay with immense
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"Only the marks of his claws on my shoulder," replied he, smacking his
  lips after his draught. "I have got them there to this day. Is it not so,
  Rose?" he added, appealing to his wife with a hearty laugh.</p>

  <p>She turned her head away without condescending to notice him. Victor bit
  his lip with a gesture of impatience, and the Countess, rising slowly and
  gracefully, gave her hand to the Prince to lead her back to the drawing-room,
  whither we all followed in the same order as that in which we had proceeded
  to dinner.</p>

  <p>"Do you not feel like a wounded man once more?" observed Val&eacute;rie,
gaily,
  to me, as I stood, coffee-cup in hand, with my back to the fireplace, like a
  true Englishman. "Is it not all exactly as you left it? the easiest arm-chair
  and my eternal embroidery-frame, and your own sofa where you used to lie so
  wonderfully patient, and look out of window at the sunset. Constance has
  established herself there now, and considers it her peculiar property. Oh,
  Vere (I shall always call you Vere), is she not charming? I am so fond of
  her!"</p>

  <p>Slow torture! but never mind, it is but for to-night&mdash;this experiment
  must never be repeated. Go on, Countess Val&eacute;rie, happy, unconscious
  executioner.</p>

  <p>"You English people are delightful, when one knows you well, although at
  first you are so cold and undemonstrative. Now, Constance, though she is so
  quiet and melancholy-looking, though she never laughs, and rarely smiles, has
  the energy and the activity of a dozen women when it is a question of doing
  good. You have no idea of what she is here amongst our own people. They
  worship the very ground she walks on&mdash;they call her 'the good angel of
  Edeldorf.' But she over-exerts herself; she is not strong: she looks ill,
  very ill. Vere, do you not think so?"</p>

  <p>For the first time since we entered the drawing-room I glanced in the
  direction of the Countess de Rohan, but her face was turned from me; she was
  still occupied with Prince Vocqsal, who, old enough to appreciate the value
  of a good listener, was devoting himself entirely to her amusement. No, I
  could not see the pale, well-known face, but the light streamed off her
  jet-black hair, and memory probed me to the quick as its shining masses
  recalled the wet, heavy locks of one whose life I saved in Beverley Mere.</p>

  <p>"Come and play the march in 'The Honij&agrave;dy,'" said Ropsley, leading
his
  <i>fianc&eacute;e</i> gaily off to the pianoforte. "<i>On revient toujours
&agrave; ses
  premiers amours</i>, but I really cannot allow you to flirt with Egerton any
  more," he added, with a smile of such thorough confidence and affection in
  his promised bride as altered the whole expression of his countenance, and
  lit it up with a beauty I had never before imagined it to possess.</p>

  <p>"Not <i>that</i>," she answered, looking anxiously round, "but 'Cheer,
  boys! cheer!' as often as you like, now we have got you back again." And they
  walked away together, a happy, handsome pair as one should wish to see.</p>

  <p>I could not have borne it much longer. I gasped for solitude as a man
  half-stifled gasps for air. With an affectation of leisurely indifference, I
  strolled into the adjoining billiard-room. I passed close to the Countess,
  but she never turned her head, so engrossed was she with the conversation of
  Prince Vocqsal. I walked on through the spacious conservatory. I even stopped
  to examine an exotic as I passed. At length I reached a balcony in which that
  structure terminated, and sinking into a chair that stood in one corner, out
  of sight and interruption, I leaned my forehead against the cold iron
  railing, and prayed for fortitude and resignation to my lot.</p>

  <p>The fresh night air cooled and composed me. A bright moonlight flickered
  and glistened over the park. The tones of Val&eacute;rie's pianoforte,
softened by
  distance, stole sadly, yet soothingly, on my ear. The autumn breeze, hushed
  to a whisper, seemed to breathe of peace and consolation. I felt that the
  strength I had asked would be given; that though the fight was not yet over,
  it would be won at last; that although, alas! the sacrifice was still to be
  offered, I should have power to make it, and the higher the cost, the holier,
  the more acceptable it would be. More than once the Devil's sophistry
  prompted me to repine; more than once I groaned aloud to think that
  <i>she</i>, too, was sacrificed unworthily, that her happiness, like my own,
  was lost beyond recall. "Oh," I thought, in the bitterness of my agony, "I
  could have given her up to one that <i>loved</i> her, I could have rejoiced
  in her welfare, and forgotten <i>myself</i> in the certainty of her
  happiness. I could have blessed him thankfully for his care and tenderness
  towards that transplanted flower, and lived on contented, if not happy, to
  think that I had not offered up my own broken heart in vain; but to see her
  neglected and pining&mdash;her dignity insulted&mdash;her rights trampled
  on&mdash;another, immeasurably her inferior, filling the place in her
  husband's affections to which she had an undoubted right! Victor! Victor! you
  were my earliest friend, and yet I can almost <i>curse</i> you from my
  soul!"</p>

  <p>But soon my better nature triumphed; I saw the path of duty plain before
  me, I determined to follow it, and struggle on, at whatever cost. I had lived
  for her all my life. I would live for her still. Perhaps when I became an old
  grey man she would know it; perhaps&mdash;never in this life&mdash;perhaps
  she might bless me for it in another; but it should be done! Could I but make
  a certainty of Victor's <i>liaison</i> with the Princess, could I but obtain
  <i>a right</i> to speak to him on the subject! I would make him one last
  appeal that should <i>force</i> him back to his duty. I would, if necessary,
  tell him the whole truth, and shame him by my own sacrifice into the right
  path. I felt a giant's strength and a martyr's constancy; once more I leaned
  my head upon the cold iron rail, and the opportunity that I asked for seemed
  to come when I least expected it.</p>

  <p>In such a mood as I then was, a man takes no note of time; I could not
  tell how long I had been sitting there in the solemn peaceful night, it might
  have been minutes, it might have been hours, but at length the click of
  billiard-balls, which had been hitherto audible in the adjoining apartment,
  ceased altogether, a man's step and the rustle of a lady's dress were heard
  in the conservatory, and when they reached within six paces of me, Victor
  placed a chair for Princess Vocqsal under the spreading branches of a
  brilliant azalea, and seated himself at her side. She dropped her bracelet on
  the smooth tesselated floor as she sat down; he picked it up and clasped it
  on her arm: as he did so I caught a glimpse of his face: he was deadly pale,
  and as he raised his eyes to hers, their wild mournful appealing glance
  reminded me of poor Bold's last look when he died licking my hand. The
  Princess, on the contrary, shone if possible more brilliant than ever; there
  was a settled flush, as of triumph, on her cheek, and her whole countenance
  bore an impress of determined, uncompromising resolution, which I had already
  remarked as no uncommon expression on those lovely features.</p>

  <p>My first impulse was to confront them at once, and take my departure; but
  I have already said I suffered from constitutional shyness to a great degree,
  and I was unwilling to face even my old friend with such traces of strong
  emotion as I knew must be visible on my exterior. I was most unwilling to
  play the eavesdropper. I felt that, as a man of honour, I was inexcusable in
  not instantly apprising them of my presence; yet some strange, inexplicable
  fascination that I could not resist, seemed to force me to remain where I
  was, unnoticed and unsuspected. Ere they had spoken three words I was in
  possession of the whole truth, that truth which a few minutes earlier I had
  been so anxious to ascertain. I do not attempt to excuse my conduct, I am
  aware that it admits of no palliation, that no one can be guilty of an act of
  espial and still remain <i>a gentleman</i>; but I state the fact as it
  occurred, and can only offer in extenuation the fever of morbid excitement
  into which I had worked myself, and my unwavering resolution to save Victor,
  in spite of his own infatuation, for her sake in whose behalf I did not
  hesitate thus to sacrifice even my honour.</p>

  <p>"Anything but <i>that</i>, Rose, my adored Rose; anything but that,"
  pleaded the Count; and his voice came thick and hoarse, whilst his features
  worked convulsively with the violence of his feelings. "Think of what I have
  been to you, think of all my devotion, all my self-denial. You cannot doubt
  me: it is impossible; you cannot mistrust me <i>now</i>; but, as you have a
  woman's heart, ask me for anything but <i>that</i>."</p>

  <p>She was clasping and unclasping the bracelet he had placed upon her arm,
  her head drooped over the jewel, but she raised her soft lustrous eyes to
  his, and with a witching, maddening glance, of which he knew too well the
  power, murmured&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Give it me, Victor, <i>dear</i> Victor! you have never refused me
  anything since I have known you."</p>

  <p>"Nor would I now, were it anything that is in my power to give," he burst
  out hurriedly, and in accents of almost childish impatience; "I tell you,
  that for your sake I would cast everything to the winds&mdash;fortune,
  friends, home, country, life itself. Drop by drop, you should have the best
  blood in my body, and I would thank you and bless you for accepting it; but
  this is more than all, Rose&mdash;this is my honour. Could you bear to see me
  a disgraced and branded man? could you bear to feel that I <i>deserved</i> to
  have my arms reversed and my name scouted? Could you care for me if it were
  so? Oh, Rose, you have never loved me if you ask for this!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you are right," she answered coldly, "perhaps I never did. You
  have often told me I am very hard-hearted&mdash;Victor," she added, after a
  pause, with a sudden change of manner, and another of those soft fond looks
  that made such wild work with her victim&mdash;"do you think I would ask a
  man I did not care for to make such a sacrifice? Oh, Victor! you little know
  a woman's heart&mdash;you have cruelly mistaken mine."</p>

  <p>The fond eyes filled with tears as she spoke. Victor was doomed. I knew it
  from that moment. He scarcely made an effort to save himself now.</p>

  <p>"And you ask for this as a last proof of my devotion. You are not
  satisfied yet. It is not enough that I have given you the whole happiness of
  my life, you must have that life itself as well&mdash;nay, even that is too
  little," he added with bitter emphasis, "I must offer up the unstained honour
  of the De Rohans in addition to all!"</p>

  <p>Another of those speaking, thrilling glances. Oh, the old, old story!
  Samson and Delilah&mdash;Hercules and Omphale&mdash;Antony and Cleopatra, on
  the ruins of an empire&mdash;or plain Jack and Gill at the fair. Man's
  weakness is woman's opportunity, and so the world goes on.</p>

  <p>"Victor," she said, "it is for <i>my</i> sake."</p>

  <p>The colour mounted in his cheek, and he rose to his feet like a man. The
  old look I had missed all the evening on his face came back once more, the
  old look that reminded me of shouting squadrons by the Danube, and a dash to
  the front with AH Mesrour and brave Iskender Bey. His blood was up, and his
  lance in rest now, stop him who can!</p>

  <p>"So be it," he said, calmly and distinctly, but with his teeth clenched
  and his nostril dilated, like that of a thorough-bred horse after a gallop.
  "So be it! and never forget, Rose, in the long dark future, never forget that
  it was for your sake: and now listen to me. I betray my own and my father's
  friends, I complete an act of treachery such as is yet unknown in the annals
  of my country, such as her history shall curse for its baseness till the end
  of time. I devote to ruin and death a score of the noblest families, a score
  of the proudest heads in Hungary. I stain my father's shield, I break my own
  oaths. Life, and honour, and all, I cast away at one throw, and, Rose, it is
  for your sake!"</p>

  <p>She was weeping now&mdash;weeping convulsively, with her face buried in
  her hands; but he heeded it not, and went on&mdash;</p>

  <p>"All this I am willing to do, Rose, because I love you; but mark the
  consequence. As surely as I deliver you this list"&mdash;he drew a paper from
  his breast as he spoke&mdash;"so surely I proclaim my treachery to the world,
  so surely I give myself over to the authorities, so surely I march up to the
  scaffold at the head of that devoted band who were once my friends, and
  though they think it shame that their blood should soak the same planks as
  mine, though they turn from me in disgust, even on the verge of another
  world, so surely will I die amongst them as boldly, as unflinchingly, as the
  most stainless patriot of them all!"</p>

  <p>"No, no," she sobbed out; "never, never; do you think I have no feeling?
  do you think I have no heart? I have provided for your safety long ago. I
  have got your free pardon in a written promise, your life and fortune are
  secure, your share in the discovery will never be made known. Victor, do you
  think I have not taken care of <i>you</i>?"</p>

  <p>Even then his whole countenance softened. This man, whose proud spirit she
  had so often trampled on, whose kind heart she had so often wounded, from
  whom she asked so much&mdash;ay, so much as his bitterest enemy would have
  shrunk from taking&mdash;was ready and willing to give her all, and to bless
  the very hand that smote him to the death. He spoke gently and caressingly
  now. He bent over her chair, and looked down at her with kind, sad eyes.</p>

  <p>"Not so," he said, "Rose, not so. I am glad you did not sacrifice me. I
  like to think you would have saved me if you could; but I cannot accept the
  terms. To-morrow is my birthday, Rose. It is St. Hubert's day, and I have a
  grand <i>chasse</i> here, as you know. Many of these devoted gentlemen will
  be at Edeldorf to-morrow. Give us at least that one day. In twenty-four hours
  from this time you can forward your information to Vienna; after that, you
  and I will meet no more on earth. Rose, dear Rose," he murmured, as he placed
  the paper in her hand, "it is the <i>last</i> present I shall give
  you&mdash;make the most of it."</p>

  <p>Why did she meddle with politics, woman as she was in her heart of hearts?
  What had she to do with Monsieur Stein, and Government intrigues, and a
  secret police, and all that complicated machinery which is worked by gold
  alone, and in which the feelings count for nothing? State information might
  go to other quarters; fortunes be made on the Bourse by other speculators;
  her husband wait for his appointment till doomsday, and the attainder remain
  unreversed on the estates in the Banat as long as the Danube flowed downward
  from its source;&mdash;what cared Princess Vocqsal? She looked up, smiling
  through her tears, like a wet rose in the sunshine. She took the list from
  his hand; once, twice, she pressed the paper to her lips, then tore it in a
  thousand fragments, and scattered them abroad over the shining floor of the
  conservatory, to mingle with the shed blossoms of the azalea, to be swept
  away with the decayed petals of the camellias, to be whirled hither and
  thither by the breeze of morning to oblivion, but to rise up between her and
  him who now stood somewhat aghast by her side, never, never more!</p>

  <p>She put her hand almost timidly in his. "Victor," she said, in a soft, low
  voice, "you have conquered. I am yours now in defiance of all. Oh, Victor,
  Victor, you do indeed love me!"</p>

  <p>He looked startled, scared, almost as if he could not understand her; he
  shook in every limb, whilst she was composed and even dignified.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, rising from her chair, "I will trifle with you no longer
  now. I know what I do; I see the gulf into which I plunge. Misery, ruin, and
  crime are before me; but I fear <i>nothing</i>. Victor de Rohan! when I leave
  Edeldorf, I leave it with you, and with you I remain for ever."</p>

  <p>They walked out of the conservatory side by side. I do not think they
  exchanged another word; and I remained stunned, motionless, stupefied, like a
  man who wakes from some ghastly and bewildering dream.</p>

  <p>The striking of the Castle clock roused me to consciousness&mdash;to a
  conviction of the importance of time, and the necessity for immediate action.
  It was now midnight. Early to-morrow we should all be on the alert for the
  grand battue on the Waldenberg, for which preparations had been making for
  several days. I should scarcely have an opportunity of speaking in private to
  my friend, and the day after it might be too late. No, to-night I must see
  Victor before he slept: to-night I must warn him from the abyss into which he
  was about to fall, confess to him the dishonourable act of which I had been
  guilty, sustain his anger and contempt as I best might, and plead her cause
  whom I must never see again. More than once&mdash;I will not deny it&mdash;a
  rebellious feeling rose in my heart. Why are these things so? Why is she not
  mine whom I have loved so many dark and lonely years? Why must Victor, after
  the proof he has given to-night of more than human devotion, never be happy
  with her for whose sake he did not hesitate to offer up all that was far
  dearer to him than life? But I had long learnt the true lesson, that
  "Whatever is, is right"&mdash;that Providence sees not with our eyes, nor
  judges with our judgment; and that we must not presume to question, much less
  dare to repine. I hurried through the billiard-room towards Victor's
  apartments; I had then to traverse the drawing-room, and a little snug
  retreat in which it used to be our custom to finish the evening with a social
  cigar, and to which, in former days Val&eacute;rie was sometimes to be
prevailed
  upon to bring her work. Here I found Ropsley and Prince Vocqsal comfortably
  established, apparently with no idea of going to bed yet for hours. They had
  never met till to-day, but seemed to suit each other admirably, all that was
  ludicrous in the Prince's character and conversation affording a ceaseless
  fund of amusement to the Guardsman; while the latter's high prowess as a
  sportsman, and intimate acquaintance with the turf, rendered him an object of
  great interest and admiration to the enthusiastic Hungarian. Ropsley, with
  restored health and his ladye-love under the same roof with him, was in the
  highest spirits, and no wonder.</p>

  <p>"Don't run away, Vere," said he, catching me by the arm as I passed behind
  his chair; "it's quite early yet. Have a quiet weed before turning in."
  Adding, in an amused whisper, "He's an immense trump, this! That's his third
  cigar and his fourth tumbler of brandy-and-soda since we came here; and he's
  telling me now how he once pinked a fellow in the Bois de Boulogne for
  wearing revolutionary shirt buttons. In English, too, my dear fellow; it's as
  good as a play."</p>

  <p>Even as he spoke I heard a door shut in the passage, and I hurried away,
  leaving the new acquaintances delighted with each other's society.</p>

  <p>In the gallery I met Victor's French valet with a bundle of clothes over
  his arm, humming an air from a French opera. "Could I see the Count?" "Alas!
  I was a few seconds too late!" The valet "was in despair&mdash;he was
  desolate&mdash;it was impossible. Monsieur had even now retired to the
  apartments of Madame!" "I must do it to-morrow," thought I; "perhaps I may
  find an opportunity when the <i>chasse</i> is over." And I went to bed with a
  heavy, aching heart.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch44"
     name="ch44"></a>CHAPTER XLIV. &mdash; THE GIPSY'S DREAM</h2>

  <p class="first">It is a calm, clear night; a narrow crescent moon, low down
  on the horizon, scarcely dims the radiance of those myriads of stars which
  gem the entire sky. It is such a night as would have been chosen by the
  Chaldean to read his destiny on the glittering page above his head&mdash;such
  a night as compels us perforce to think of other matters than what we shall
  eat and what we shall drink&mdash;as brings startlingly to our minds the
  unsolved question, Which is Reality&mdash;the Material of to-day or the Ideal
  of to-morrow? Not a cloud obscures the diamond-sprinkled vault above; not a
  tree, not an undulation, varies the level plain extending far and wide below.
  Dim and indistinct, its monotonous surface presents a vague idea of boundless
  space, the vastness of which is enhanced by the silence that reigns around.
  Not a breath of air is stirring, not a sound is heard save the lazy plash and
  ripple of the Danube, as it steals away under its low swampy banks, sluggish
  and unseen. Yet there is life breathing in the midst of this apparent
  solitude: human hearts beating, with all their hopes and fears, and joys and
  sorrows, in this isolated spot. Even here beauty pillows her head on the
  broad chest of strength; infancy nestles to the refuge of a mother's bosom;
  weary labour lies prone and helpless, with relaxed muscles and limp,
  powerless limbs; youth dreams of love, and age of youth; and sleep spreads
  her welcome mantle over the hardy tribe who have chosen this wild waste of
  Hungary for their lair.</p>

  <p>It is long past midnight; their fires have been out for hours; their tents
  are low and dusky, in colour almost like the plain on which they are pitched;
  you might ride within twenty yards of it, and never know you were near a
  gipsy's encampment, for the Zingynie loves to be unobserved and secret in his
  movements; to wander here and there, with no man's leave and no man's
  knowledge; to come and go unmarked and untrammelled as the wind that lifts
  the elf-locks from his brow. So he sleeps equally well under the coarse
  canvas of a tent or the roof of a clear cold sky; he pays no rent, he owns no
  master, and he believes that, of all the inhabitants of earth, he alone is
  free.</p>

  <p>And now a figure rises from amongst the low dusky tents, and comes out
  into the light of the clear starry sky, and looks steadfastly towards the
  east as if watching for the dawn, and turns a fevered cheek to the soft night
  air, as yet not fresh and cold enough to promise the approach of day. It is
  the figure of a woman past the prime of life, nay, verging upon age, but who
  retains all the majesty and some remains of the beauty which distinguished
  her in bygone days; who even now owns none of the decay of strength or
  infirmity of gait which usually accompanies the advance of years, but who
  looks, as she always did, born to command, and not yet incapable of enforcing
  obedience to her behests. It is none other than the Zingynie queen who
  prophesied the future of Victor de Rohan when he was a laughing golden-haired
  child; whose mind is anxious and ill at ease for the sake of her darling now,
  and who draws her hood further over her head, binds her crimson handkerchief
  tighter on her brows, and looks once more with anxious glance towards the
  sky, as she mutters&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Three hours to dawn, and then six more till noon; and once, girl, thou
  wast light-footed and untiring as the deer. Girl!" and she laughs a short,
  bitter laugh. "Well, no matter&mdash;girl, or woman, or aged crone, the heart
  is always the same; and I will save him&mdash;save him, for the sake of the
  strong arm and the fair, frank face that have been mouldering for years in
  the grave!"</p>

  <p>She is wandering back into the past now. Vivid and real as though it had
  happened but yesterday, she recalls a scene that took place many a long year
  ago in the streets of Pesth. She was a young, light-hearted maiden then: the
  acknowledged beauty of her tribe, the swiftest runner, the most invincible
  pedestrian to be found of either sex in the bounds of Hungary. Not a little
  proud was she of both advantages, and it was hard to say on which she plumed
  herself the most. In those days, as in many others of its unhappy history,
  that country was seething with internal faction and discontent; and the
  Zingynies, from their wandering habits, powers of endurance, and immunity
  from suspicion, were constantly chosen as the bearers of important despatches
  and the means of communication between distant conspirators, whilst they were
  themselves kept in utter ignorance of the valuable secrets with which they
  were entrusted.</p>

  <p>The gipsy maiden had come up to Pesth on an errand of this nature all the
  way from the Banat. Many a flat and weary mile it is; yet though she had
  rested but seldom and partaken sparingly of food, the girl's eye was as
  bright, her step as elastic, and her beauty as dazzling as when she first
  started on her journey. In such a town as the capital of Hungary she could
  not fail to attract attention and remark. Ere long, while she herself was
  feasting her curiosity with innocent delight on the splendours of the shop
  windows and the many wonders of a city so interesting to this denizen of the
  wilderness, she found herself the centre of a gazing and somewhat turbulent
  crowd, whose murmurs of approbation at her beauty were not unmixed with jeers
  and even threats of a more formidable description. Swabes were they mostly,
  and Croatians, who formed this disorderly mob; for your true Hungarian, of
  whatever rank, is far too much of a gentleman to mix himself up with a street
  riot or vulgar brawl, save upon the greatest provocation. There had been
  discontent brewing for days amongst the lowest classes; the price of bread
  had gone up, and there was a strong feeling abroad against the landholders,
  and what we should term in England the agricultural interest generally.</p>

  <p>The mob soon recognised in the Zingynie maiden one of the messengers of
  their enemies. From taunts and foul abuse they proceeded to overt acts of
  insolence; and the handsome high-spirited girl found herself at bay,
  surrounded by savage faces, and rude, insulting tongues. Soon they began to
  hustle and maltreat her, with cries of "Down with the gipsy!"&mdash;"Down
  with the go-between of our tyrants!"&mdash;"To the stake with the
  fortune-teller!"&mdash;"To the Danube with the witch!" Imprudently she drew
  her long knife and flashed it in the faces of the foremost; for an instant
  the curs gave back, but it was soon struck from her hand, and any immunity
  that her youth and beauty might have won from her oppressors was, by this
  ill-judged action, turned to more determined violence and aggression. Already
  they had pinioned her arms, and were dragging her towards the
  river&mdash;already she had given herself up for lost, when a lane was seen
  opening in the crowd, and a tall powerful man came striding to her rescue,
  and, as he elbowed and jostled his way through her tormentors, asked
  authoritatively, "What was the matter, and how they could dare thus to
  maltreat a young and beautiful girl?"</p>

  <p>"She is a witch!" replied one ruffian who had hold of her by the wrist,
  "and we are going to put her in the Danube. <i>You</i> are an aristocrat, and
  you shall keep her company!"</p>

  <p>"Shall I?" replied the stranger, and in another instant the insolent
  Swabe, spitting out a mouthful of blood and a couple of front teeth, measured
  his length upon the pavement. The crowd began to retire, but they were fierce
  and excited, and their numbers gave them confidence. A comrade of the fallen
  ruffian advanced upon the champion with bared knife and scowling brow.
  Another of those straight left-handers, delivered flush from the shoulder,
  and he lay prostrate by his friend. The stranger had evidently received his
  fighting education in England, and the instructions of science had not been
  thrown away on that magnificent frame and those heavy muscular limbs. It was
  indeed no other than the last Count de Rohan, Victor's father, the associate
  of the Prince of Wales, the friend of Philip Egerton and Sir Harry Beverley:
  lastly, what was more to the purpose at the present juncture, the pupil of
  the famous Jackson. Ere long the intimidated mob ceased to interfere, and the
  nobleman, conducting the frightened gipsy girl with as much deference as
  though she had been his equal in rank and station, never left her till he had
  placed her in his own carriage, and forwarded her, with three or four stout
  hussars as her escort, half-way back on her homeward journey. There is a
  little bit of romance safe locked up and hidden away somewhere in a corner of
  every woman's heart. What was the great Count de Rohan to the vagabond
  Zingynie maiden but a "bright particular star," from which she must always
  remain at a hopeless and immeasurable distance? Yet even now, though her hair
  is grey and her brow is wrinkled&mdash;though she has loved and suffered, and
  borne children and buried them, and wept and laughed, and hoped and feared,
  and gone the round of earthly joys and earthly sorrows&mdash;the colour
  mounts to her withered cheek, and the blood gathers warmer round her heart,
  when she thinks of that frank, handsome face, with its noble features and its
  fearless eyes, and the kindly smile with which it bade her farewell.
  Therefore has she always felt a thrilling interest in all that appertains to
  the Count de Rohan; therefore has she mourned him with many a secret tear and
  many a hidden pang; therefore has she loved and cherished and watched over
  his child as though he had been her own, exhausting all her skill and all her
  superstition to prognosticate for him a happy future&mdash;to ward off from
  him the evil that she reads too surely in the stars will be his lot.</p>

  <p>Once she has warned him&mdash;twice she has warned him&mdash;will the
  third time be too late? She shudders to think how she has neglected him.
  To-morrow&mdash;nay, to-day (for it is long past midnight), is the
  anniversary of his birth, the festival of St. Hubert, and she would have
  passed it over unnoticed, would have forgotten it, but for last night's
  dream. The coming morning strikes chill to her very marrow as she thinks what
  a strange, wild, eerie dream it was.</p>

  <p>She dreamed that she was sitting by the Danube; far, far away down yonder,
  where its broad yellow flood, washing the flat, fertile shores of Moldavia,
  sweeps onward to the Black Sea, calm, strong, and not to be stemmed by mortal
  hand, like the stream of Time&mdash;like the course of destiny.</p>

  <p>Strange voices whispered in her ears, mingled with the plash and ripple of
  the mighty river; voices that she could not recognise, yet of which she felt
  an uncomfortable consciousness that she had heard them before. It was early
  morning, the raw mist curled over the waters, and her hair&mdash;how was
  this?&mdash;once more black and glossy as the raven's wing, was dank and
  dripping with dew. There was a babe, too, in her lap, and she folded the
  child tighter to her bosom for warmth and comfort. It nestled and smiled up
  in her face, though it was none of hers; no gipsy blood could be traced in
  those blue eyes and golden locks; it was De Rohan's heir: how came it here?
  She asked the question aloud, and the voices answered all at once and
  confusedly, with an indistinct and rushing sound. Then they were silent, and
  the river plashed on.</p>

  <p>She felt very lonely, and sang to the child for company a merry gipsy
  song. And the babe laughed and crowed, and leapt in her arms with delight,
  and glided from her hands; and the waters closed over its golden head, and it
  was gone. Then the voices moaned and shrieked, still far away, dim and
  indistinct; and the river plashed sullenly on.</p>

  <p>But the child rose from the waves, and looked back and smiled, and shook
  the drops from its golden hair, and struck out fearlessly down the stream. It
  had changed, too, and the blue eyes and the clustering curls belonged to a
  strong, well-grown young man. Still she watched the form eagerly as it swam,
  for something reminded her of one she used to think the type of manhood years
  and years ago. The voices warned her now to rise and hasten, but the river
  plashed on sullenly as before.</p>

  <p>She must run to yonder point, marked as it is by a white wooden cross. Far
  beyond it the stream whirls and seethes in a deep eddying pool, and she must
  guide the swimmer to the cross, and help him to land there, or he will be
  lost&mdash;De Rohan's child will be drowned in her sight. How does she know
  it is called St. Hubert's Cross? Did the voices tell her? They are whispering
  still, but fainter and farther off. And the river plashes on sullenly, but
  with a murmur of fierce impatience now.</p>

  <p>She waves frantically to the swimmer, and would fain shout to him aloud,
  but she cannot speak; her shawl is wound so tight round her bosom that it
  stops her voice, and her fingers struggle in vain amongst the knots. Why will
  he not turn his head towards her?&mdash;why does he dash so eagerly on? proud
  of his strength, proud of his mastery over the flood&mdash;his father's own
  son. Ah! he hears it too. Far away, past the cross and the whirlpool, down
  yonder on that sunny patch of sand, sits a mermaid, combing her long bright
  locks with a golden comb. She sings a sweet, wild, unearthly melody&mdash;it
  would woo a saint to perdition! Hark! how it mingles with the rushing voices
  and the plash of the angry river!</p>

  <p>The sand is deep and quick along the water's edge; she sinks in it up to
  the ankles, weights seem to clog her limbs, and hands she cannot see to hold
  her back; breathless she struggles on to reach the cross, for there is a bend
  in the river there, and he will surely see her, and turn from the song of the
  mermaid, and she will drag him ashore and rescue him from his fate. The
  voices are close in her ears now, and the river plashing at her very
  feet.</p>

  <p>So she reaches the cross at last, and with frantic gestures&mdash;for she
  is still speechless&mdash;waves him to the shore. But the mermaid beckons him
  wildly on, and the stream, seizing him like a prey, whirls him downwards
  eddying past the cross, and it is too late now. See! he turns his head at
  last, but to show the pale, rigid features of a corpse.</p>

  <p>The voices come rushing like a hurricane in her ears; the plash of the
  river rises to a mighty roar. Wildly the mermaid tosses her white arms above
  her head, and laughs, and shrieks, and laughs again, in ghastly triumph. The
  dreamer has found her voice now, and in a frenzy of despair and horror she
  screams aloud.</p>

  <p>With that scream she awoke, and left her tent for the cool night air, and
  counted the hours till noon; and so, with no more preparation, she betook
  herself to her journey, goaded with the thought that there might be time even
  yet.</p>

  <p>It is sunrise now; a thousand gladsome tokens of life and happiness wake
  with the morning light. The dew sparkles on herb and autumn flower; the lark
  rises into the bright, pure heaven; herds of oxen file slowly across the
  plain. Hope is ever strong in the morning; and the gipsy's step is more
  elastic, her brow grows clearer and her eye brighter, as she calculates the
  distance she has already traversed, and the miles that yet lie between her
  and the woods and towers of Edeldorf. A third of the journey is already
  accomplished; in another hour the summit of the Waldenberg ought to be
  visible, peering above the plain. She has often trod the same path before,
  but never in such haste as now.</p>

  <p>A tall Hungarian peasant meets her, and recognising her at once for a
  gipsy, doffs his hat, and bids her "Good-morrow, mother!" and craves a
  blessing from the Zingynie, for though he has no silver, he has a paper
  florin or two in his pocket, and he would fain have his fortune told, and so
  while away an hour of his long, solitary day only just begun. With flashing
  eyes and impatient gestures she bans him as she passes, for she cannot brook
  even an instant's delay, and the curse springs with angry haste to her lips.
  He crosses himself in terror as he walks on, and all day he will be less
  comfortable that he encountered a gipsy's malison at sunrise.</p>

  <p>A village lies in her road; many a long mile before she reaches it, the
  white houses and tall acacias seem to mock her with their distinct outlines
  and their apparent proximity&mdash;will it <i>never</i> be any nearer? but
  she arrives there at last, and although she is weary and footsore, she dreams
  not of an instant's delay for refreshment or repose. Flocks of geese hiss and
  cackle at her as she passes: from the last cottage in the street a little
  child runs merrily out with a plaything in its hand, it totters and falls
  just across her path; as she replaces it on its legs she kisses it, that dark
  old woman, on its bright young brow. It is a good omen, and she feels easier
  about her heart now; she walks on with renewed strength and
  elasticity&mdash;she will win yet.</p>

  <p>Another hour, the sun is high in the heavens, and autumn though it be, the
  heat scorches her head through her crimson handkerchief and her thick grey
  hair. Ah! she is old now; though the spirit may last for ever, the limbs fail
  in despite of it; what if she has miscalculated her strength? what if she
  cannot reach the goal after all? Courage! the crest of the Waldenberg shows
  high above the plain. Edeldorf, as she knows well, lies between her and that
  rugged range of hills, but she quails to think from what a distance the
  waving woods of De Rohan's home should be visible, and that they are not yet
  in sight. Her limbs are very weary, and the cold drops stand on her brow, for
  she is faint and sick at heart. Gallantly she struggles on.</p>

  <p>It is a tameless race, that ancient nation of which we know not the
  origin, and speculate on the destiny in vain. It transmits to its descendants
  a strain of blood which seems as invincible by physical fatigue as it is
  averse to moral restraint. Lake some wild animal, like some courser of pure
  Eastern breed, the gipsy gained second strength as she toiled. Three hours
  after sunrise she was literally fresher and stronger than when she met and
  cursed the astonished herdsman in the early morning; and as the distance
  decreased between the traveller and her destination, as the white towers of
  Edeldorf stood out clearer and clearer in the daylight, glad hope and kindly
  affection gushed up in her heart, and, lame, wearied, exhausted as she was, a
  thrill of triumph shot through her as she thought she might see her darling
  in time to warn him even now.</p>

  <p>At the lodge gate she sinks exhausted on a stone. A dashing hussar
  mounting guard, as befits his office, scans her with an astonished look, and
  crosses himself more than once with a hurried, inward prayer. He is a bold
  fellow enough, and would face an Austrian cuirassier or a Russian bayonet as
  readily and fearlessly as a flask of strong Hungarian wine, but he quails and
  trembles at the very thought of the Evil Eye.</p>

  <p>"The Count! the Count!" gasps out the breathless Zingynie, "is he at the
  Castle? can I see Count Victor?"</p>

  <p>"All in good time, mother!" replies he good-naturedly; "the Count is gone
  shooting to the Waldenberg. The carriages have but just driven by; did you
  not see them as you came here?"</p>

  <p>"And the Count, is he not riding, as is his custom? will he not pass by
  here as he gallops on to overtake them? Has my boy learned to forget the
  saddle, and to neglect the good horse that his father's son should love?"</p>

  <p>"Not to-day, mother," answered the hussar. "All the carriages are gone
  to-day, and the Count sits in the first with a bright, beautiful lady, ah,
  brighter even than our Countess, and more beautiful, with her red lips and
  her sunny hair."</p>

  <p>All hussars are connoisseurs in beauty.</p>

  <p>"My boy, my boy," mutters the old woman; and the hussar, seeing how ill
  she looks, produces a flask of his favourite remedy, and insists on her
  partaking of its contents. It brings the colour back to her cheek, and the
  blood to her heart.</p>

  <p>"And they are gone to the Waldenberg! and I ought to reach it by the
  mountain-path before them even now. Oh, for one hour of my girlhood! one hour
  of the speed I once thought so little of! I would give all the rest of my
  days for that hour now. To the Waldenberg!"</p>

  <p>"To the Waldenberg!" answered the hussar, taking the flask (empty) from
  his lips; but even while he spoke she was gone.</p>

  <p>As she followed the path towards the mountain, a large raven flew out of
  the copse-wood on her left, and hopped along the track in front of her. Then
  the gipsy's lips turned ashy-white once more, for she knew she was too
  late.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch45"
     name="ch45"></a>CHAPTER XLV. &mdash; RETRIBUTION</h2>

  <p class="first">Carriage after carriage drove from Edeldorf to the foot of
  the Waldenberg, and deposited its living freight in a picturesque gorge or
  cleft of the mountain, where the only road practicable for wheels and axles
  terminated, and whence the sportsman, however luxurious, must be content to
  perform the remainder of his journey on foot. A hearty welcome and a
  sumptuous breakfast at the Castle had commenced the day's proceedings; but
  Madame de Rohan had kept her room on the plea of indisposition, and the only
  ladies of the party were the Princess and Countess Val&eacute;rie. Victor
was in
  unusual spirits, a strange, wild happiness lighted up his eye, and spread a
  halo over his features; but he was absent and preoccupied at intervals, and
  his inconsequent answers and air of distraction more than once elicited marks
  of undisguised astonishment from his guests. The Princess was more subdued in
  manner than her wont. I watched the two with a painful interest, all the
  keener that my opportunity had not yet arrived, and that the confidence in my
  own powers, which had supported me the previous evening, was now rapidly
  deserting me, as I reflected on the violence of my friend's fatal attachment,
  and the character of her who was his destiny. If I should fail in persuading
  him, as was more than probable, what would be the result? What ought I to do
  next? I had assumed a fearful responsibility, yet I determined not to shrink
  from it. Val&eacute;rie was gay and good-humoured as usual. It had been
arranged
  that the two ladies should accompany the sportsmen to the trysting-place at
  the foot of the mountain, and then return to the Castle. The plan originated
  with Val&eacute;rie, who thus, enjoyed more of her lover's society. Nor did
it meet
  with the slightest opposition from Victor, who, contrary to his usual custom
  of riding on horseback to the mountain, starting after all his guests were
  gone, and then galloping at speed to overtake them, had shown no
  disinclination to make a fourth in his own barouche, the other three places
  being occupied by an Austrian grandee and Prince and Princess Vocqsal. Had he
  adhered to his usual custom, the Zingynie would have met him before he
  reached the lodge. English thorough-bred horses, harnessed to carriages of
  Vienna build, none of them being drawn by less than four, make light of
  distance, and it seemed but a short drive to more than one couple of our
  party, when we reached the spot at which our day's sport was likely to
  commence.</p>

  <p>A merry, chattering, laughing group we were. On a level piece of
  greensward, overshadowed by a few gigantic fir-trees, and backed by the bluff
  rise of the copse-clothed mountain, lounged the little band of gentlemen for
  whose amusement all the preparations had been made, whose accuracy of eye and
  readiness of finger were that day to be tested by the downfall of bear and
  wolf, deer and wild-boar, not to mention such ignoble game as partridges,
  woodcocks, quail, and water-fowl, or such inferior vermin as hawk and
  buzzard, marten and wild-cat, all of which denizens of the wilderness were to
  be found in plenty on the Waldenberg. A picturesque assemblage it was,
  consisting as it did of nearly a score of the first noblemen in
  Hungary&mdash;men who bore the impress of their stainless birth not only in
  chivalry of bearing and frank courtesy of manner, but in the handsome faces
  and stately frames that had come down to them direct from those mailed
  ancestors whose boast it used to be that they were the advanced guard of
  Germany and the very bulwarks of Christendom. As I looked around on their
  happy, smiling faces, and graceful, energetic forms, my blood ran cold to
  think how the lightest whisper of one frail woman might bring every one of
  those noble heads to the block; how, had she indeed been more or less than
  woman, a cross would even now be attached to every one of those time-honoured
  names on that fatal list which knows neither pity nor remorse. And when I
  looked from those unconscious men to the fair arbitress of their fate, with
  her little French bonnet and coquettish dress, with her heightened colour and
  glossy hair, I thought, if the history of the world were ever
  <i>really</i>laid bare, what a strange history it would be, and how unworthy
  we should find had been the motives of some of the noblest actions, how
  paltry the agency by which some of the greatest convulsions on record had
  been effected.</p>

  <p>She was fastening Victor's powder-horn more securely to its string, and I
  remarked that her fingers trembled in the performance of that simple office.
  She looked wistfully after him, too, as he waved his hat to bid her adieu,
  and stood up in the carriage to watch our ascending party long after she had
  started on her homeward journey. She who was generally so proud, so
  undemonstrative, so careful not to commit herself by word or deed! could it
  have been a presentiment? I felt angry with her then; alas! alas! my anger
  had passed away long before the sun went down.</p>

  <p>"Help me to place the guns, Vere," said Victor in his cheerful,
  affectionate voice, as we toiled together up the mountain-side, and reached
  the first pass at which it would be necessary to station a sportsman, well
  armed with rifle and smooth-bore, to be ready for whatever might come. "I can
  depend upon <i>you</i>, for I know your shooting; so I shall put you above
  the waterfall. Vocqsal and I will take the two corners just below; and if
  there is an old boar in the Waldenberg, he <i>must</i> come to one of us. I
  expect a famous day's sport, if we manage it well. I used to say '<i>Vive la
  guerre</i>,' Vere&mdash;don't you remember?&mdash;but it's '<i>Vive la
  chasse</i>' now, and has been for a long time with me."</p>

  <p>He looked so happy; he was so full of life and spirits, I could not help
  agreeing with his head forester, a tall, stalwart Hungarian, who followed him
  about like his shadow, when he muttered, "It does one good to see the Count
  when he gets on the mountain. He is like <i>himself</i> now."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the beaters, collected from the neighbouring peasantry, and who
  had been all the previous day gradually contracting the large circle they had
  made, so as to bring every head of game, and indeed every living thing, from
  many a mile round, within the range of our fire-arms, might be heard drawing
  nearer and nearer, their shrill voices and discordant shouts breaking wildly
  on the silence of the forest, hitherto uninterrupted, save by the soft
  whisper of the breeze, or the soothing murmur of the distant waterfall. Like
  the hunter when he hears the note of a hound, and erects his ears, and snorts
  and trembles with excitement, I could see many of my fellow-sportsmen change
  colour and fidget upon their posts; for well they knew that long before the
  beater's cry smites upon the ear it is time to expect the light-bounding
  gambol of the deer, the stealthy gallop of the wolf, the awkward advance of
  the bear, or the blundering rush of the fierce wild-boar himself; and as they
  were keen and experienced sportsmen, heart and soul in the business of the
  day, their quick glances and eager attitudes showed that each was determined
  no inattention on his own part should baulk him of his prey.</p>

  <p>One by one Victor placed them in their respective situations, with a jest
  and a kind word and a cordial smile for each. Many a hearty friend remarked
  that day how Count de Rohan's voice was gayer, his manner even more
  fascinating than usual, his whole bearing more full of energy and happiness
  and a thorough enjoyment of life.</p>

  <p>At last he had placed them, all but Ropsley and myself, and there was no
  time to be lost, for the cry of the beaters came louder and louder on the
  breeze; and already a scared buzzard or two, shooting rapidly over our heads,
  showed that our neighbourhood was disturbed, and the game of every
  description must ere long be on foot.</p>

  <p>"Take the Guardsman above the waterfall, Vere, and put him by the old
  oak-tree," said Victor, fanning his brow with his hat after his exertions.
  "He can command both the passes from there, and get shooting enough to remind
  him of Sebastopol. You take the glade at the foot of the bare rock. Keep well
  under cover. I have seen two boars there already this season. I shall stay
  here opposite the Prince. Halloa! Vocqsal, where are you?"</p>

  <p>"Here," replied that worthy, from the opposite side of the torrent, where
  he had ensconced himself in a secure and secret nook, commanding right and
  left an uninterrupted view of two long narrow vistas in the forest, and
  promising to afford an excellent position for the use of that heavy
  double-barrelled rifle which he handled with a skill and precision the result
  of many a year's practice and many a triumphant <i>coup</i>.</p>

  <p>Unlike the younger sportsmen, Prince Vocqsal's movements were marked by a
  coolness and confidence which was of itself sufficient to predicate success.
  He had taken off the resplendent wig which adorned his "imperial front"
  immediately on the departure of the ladies, and transferred it to the
  capacious pockets of a magnificent green velvet shooting-coat, rich in gold
  embroidery and filagree buttons of the same precious metal. Its place was
  supplied by a black skull-cap, surmounted by a wide-brimmed, low hat. On the
  branches of the huge old tree under which he was stationed he had hung his
  powder-horn, loading-rod, and shooting apparatus generally, in such positions
  as to ensure replenishing his trusty rifle with the utmost rapidity; and
  taking a hunting-knife from his belt, he had stuck it, like a Scottish
  Highlander, in his right boot. Since his famous encounter with the bear at
  this very spot, the Prince always liked to wear his "best friend," as he
  called it, in that place. These arrangements being concluded to his own
  satisfaction, he took a goodly-sized hunting-flask from his pocket, and,
  after a hearty pull at its contents, wiped his moustache, and looked about
  him with the air of a man who had made himself thoroughly comfortable, and
  was prepared for any emergency.</p>

  <p>"Here I am, Victor," he shouted once more, "established <i>en
  factionnaire</i>. Don't shoot point-blank this way, and keep perfectly quiet
  after you hear the action has commenced."</p>

  <p>Victor laughingly promised compliance, and Ropsley and I betook ourselves,
  with all the haste we could make, to our respective posts.</p>

  <p>It was a steep, though not a long climb, and we had little breath to spare
  for conversation. Yet it seemed that something more than the exhausting
  nature of our exercise sealed our lips and checked our free interchange of
  thought. There was evidently something on Ropsley's mind; and he, too,
  appeared aware that there was a burden on mine. It was not till I reached the
  old oak-tree at which he was to be stationed, and was about to leave him for
  my own place, that he made the slightest remark. Then he only said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Vere, what's the matter with De Rohan? There's something very queer about
  him to-day; have you not observed it."</p>

  <p>I made some excuse about his keen zest for field-sports, and his
  hospitable anxiety that his guests should enjoy their share of the day's
  amusement, but the weight at my heart belied my commonplace words, and when I
  reached the station assigned me I sank down on the turf oppressed and crushed
  by a foreboding of some sudden and dreadful evil.</p>

  <p>Soon a shot afar off at the extreme edge of the wood warned me that the
  sport had commenced; another and yet another followed in rapid succession.
  Branches began to rustle and dry twigs to crack as the larger game moved
  onwards to the centre of the fatal circle. A fine brown bear came shambling
  clumsily along within twenty yards of my post; I hit him in the shoulder,
  and, watching him as he went on to mark if my ball had taken effect, saw him
  roll over and over down the steep mountain-side, at the same moment that the
  crack of Ropsley's unerring rifle reached my ear, and a light puff of smoke
  from the same weapon curled and clung around the fir-trees above his
  hiding-place. A "Bravo" of encouragement sprang to my lips, but I checked it
  as it rose, for at that instant an enormous wild-boar emerged from the covert
  in front of me; he was trotting along leisurely enough, and with an
  undignified and ungraceful movement sufficiently ludicrous, but his quick eye
  must have caught the gleam of my rifle ere I could level it, for he stopped
  dead short, turned aside with an angry grunt, and dashed furiously down the
  hill towards the waterfall. "Boar forward!" shouted I, preparing to follow
  the animal, but in a few moments a shot rang sharply through the woodlands,
  succeeded instantaneously by another, and then a scream&mdash;a long, full,
  wild, ear-piercing scream! and then the ghastly, awful silence that seems to
  tell so much. I knew it all long before I reached him, and yet of those few
  minutes I have no distinct recollection. There was a group of tall figures
  looking down; a confused mass of rifles, powder-horns, and shooting-gear; a
  hunting-flask lying white and glittering on the green turf; and an old woman
  with a bright crimson handkerchief kneeling over <i>something</i> on the
  ground. Every one made way for me to pass, they seemed to treat me with a
  strange, awe-stricken respect&mdash;perhaps they knew I was his
  friend&mdash;his oldest friend&mdash;and there he lay, the brave, the bright,
  the beautiful, stretched at his length, stone dead on the cold earth, shot
  through the heart&mdash;by whom? by Prince Vocqsal.</p>

  <p>I might have known there was no hope. I had heard such screams before
  cleaving the roar of battle&mdash;death shrieks that are only forced from man
  when the leaden messenger has reached the very well-spring of his life. I
  need not have taken the cold clammy hand in mine, and opened his dress, and
  looked with my own eyes upon the blue livid mark. It was all over; there was
  no more hope for him than for the dead who have lain a hundred years in the
  grave. This morning he was Count de Rohan; Victor de Rohan, my dear old
  friend. I thought of him a merry, blue-eyed child, and then I wept; and my
  head got better, and so I learned by degrees what had happened.</p>

  <p><a id="pic4"

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">"I might have known there was no hope."</p>
  </div>

  <p>The boar had dashed down at speed towards the waterfall He had crossed the
  range of Count de Rohan's rifle, but the Count&mdash;and on this fact the
  forester laid great stress&mdash;the Count had missed his aim, and the animal
  almost instantaneously turned towards Prince Vocqsal. The Prince's rifle rang
  clear and true; with his usual cool precision he had waited until the quarry
  was far past the line of his friend's ambush, and had pulled the trigger in
  perfect confidence as to the result. He, too, had failed for once in the very
  act of skill on which he so prided himself. His ball missing the game had
  struck against the hard knot of an old tree beyond it, and glancing thence
  almost at right angles, had lodged in poor Victor's heart at the very moment
  when the exhausted Zingynie, staggering with fatigue, had reached his post,
  murmuring a few hoarse words of warning, and an entreaty to abandon the sport
  only for that day. As he turned to greet her, the fatal messenger arrived,
  and with a convulsive bound into the air, and one loud scream, he fell dead
  at her feet.</p>

  <p>Old Prince Vocqsal seemed utterly stupefied. He could neither be prevailed
  upon to quit the body, nor did it seem possible to make him comprehend
  exactly what had happened, and the share which he had himself borne so
  unwittingly in the dreadful catastrophe. The Zingynie, on the contrary,
  although pale as death, was composed and almost majestic in her grief. To her
  it was the fulfilment of a prophecy&mdash;the course of that destiny which is
  not to be checked nor stayed. As she followed the body, with head erect and
  measured tread, she looked neither to right nor left, but her black eyes
  flashed with awful brilliance as she fastened the dilated orbs on what had
  once been Victor de Rohan, and murmured in a low chant words which I now
  remembered, for the first time, to have heard many years before, words of
  which I now knew too well the gloomy significance. "Birth and
  Burial&mdash;Birth and Burial&mdash;Beware of St. Hubert's Day!"</p>

  <p>So we bore him down to Edeldorf, slowly, solemnly, as we bear one to his
  last resting-place. Down the beautiful mountain-side, with its russet
  copsewood, and its fine old oaks, and its brilliant clothing of autumnal
  beauty; down the white sandy road between the vine-gardens, with their
  lightsome foliage and their clusters of blushing grapes, and the buxom
  peasant-women, and ruddy, happy children, even now so gay and noisy, but
  hushed and horror-bound as they stopped to look and learn; down across the
  long level plain, where the flocks were feeding securely, and the cattle
  stood dreamily, and clouds of insects danced and hovered in the beams of an
  afternoon sun. Slowly, solemnly, we wound across the plain; slowly, solemnly,
  we reached the wide park-gates. A crowd of mourners, gathering as we went,
  followed eager and silent in the rear. Slowly, solemnly, we filed up the long
  avenue between the acacias, bearing the lord of that proud domain, the last
  of the De Rohans, to his ancestral home.</p>

  <p>Two ladies were walking in the garden as we approached the house; I caught
  sight of their white dresses before they had themselves perceived our ghastly
  train. They were Constance de Rohan, and Rose, Princess Vocqsal.</p>

  <p>There was deep and holy mourning, there were bitter scalding tears that
  night in the Castle of Edeldorf. On the morrow, when the sun rose, there was
  one broken heart within its walls.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch46"
     name="ch46"></a>CHAPTER XLVI. &mdash; VAE VICTIS!</h2>

  <p class="first">Val&eacute;rie de Rohan is Mrs. Ropsley now; she has
dropped the
  rank of Countess, and prides herself upon the facility with which she has
  adopted the character of an English matron. She speaks our language, if
  anything, a little less correctly than when I knew her first; never shakes
  hands with any of her male acquaintances, and cannot be brought to take a
  vehement interest in Low Church bishops, parliamentary majorities, or the
  costly shawls and general delinquencies of her pretty next-door neighbour,
  whose private history is no concern of yours or mine. In all other respects
  she is British enough to be own grand-daughter to Boadicea herself. She makes
  her husband's breakfast punctually at ten; comes down in full morning toilet,
  dressed for the day, bringing with her an enormous bunch of keys, such as we
  bachelors scrutinise with mysterious awe, and of the utility of which,
  inasmuch as they are invariably forgotten and left on the breakfast-table, we
  nourish vague and secret doubts; further, she studies Shakspeare and Burke
  (not the statesman, but the compiler of that national work which sets forth
  the pedigrees of peers and baronets, and honourable messieurs and mesdames)
  with divided ardour, and although she thinks London a little <i>triste</i>,
  believes her own house in Belgravia to be a perfect paradise, and loves its
  lord and hers with a pure, simple, and entire devotion. Mrs. Ropsley is very
  happy, and so is he.</p>

  <p>"The boy is father to the man." I can trace in the late
  Guardsman&mdash;who relinquished his profession at the Peace&mdash;the same
  energy, the same calculating wisdom, the same practical good sense, that
  distinguished his youth; but he has lost the selfishness which made his
  earlier character so unamiable, and has acquired in its stead an enlarged
  view of the duties and purposes of life, a mellower tone of thought, a deeper
  sense of feeling as to its pleasures and its pains. He has discovered that
  the way to be happy is not to surround oneself with a rampart of worldly
  wisdom, not to cover the human breast with a shield of cynical defiance,
  which always fails it at its need, but to take one's share manfully and
  contentedly of the roses as of the thorns&mdash;no more ashamed to luxuriate
  in the fragrance of the one, than to wince from the sharp points of the
  other. He entered on life with one predominant idea, and that one perhaps the
  least worthy of all those which sanguine boyhood proposes so ardently to
  itself; but he had purpose and energy, and though self was his idol, he
  worshipped with a perseverance and consistency worthy of a better cause.
  Circumstances, which have warped so many to evil, rescued him at the turning
  point of his destiny. When he met Val&eacute;rie at Vienna, he was rapidly
hardening
  into a bold, bad man, but the affection with which she inspired him saved
  him, as such affection has saved many a one before, from that most dangerous
  state of all in which he lies who has nothing to care for, nothing to hope,
  and consequently nothing to fear. Oh! you who have it in your power to save
  the fallen, think of this. How slight is the cable that tows many a goodly
  vessel into port; what a mere thread will buoy up a drowning man; do not
  stand on the bank and wag your heads, and say, "I told you so;" stretch but a
  little finger, throw him the rope that lies to your hand; nay, think it no
  shame to wet your feet and bring him gently and tenderly ashore, for is he
  not your brother?</p>

  <p>The good work that Val&eacute;rie's influence had begun, was perfected by
the
  hardships and horrors of the Crimean campaign. No man could witness the
  sufferings so cheerfully borne, or take his share in the kindly offices so
  heartily interchanged on that dreary plateau above Sebastopol, without
  experiencing an improvement in his moral being, and imbibing far more correct
  notions than he had entertained before as to the <i>realities</i> of life and
  death. No man could take his turn of duty day by day in the trenches, see
  friends and comrades one by one struck down by grape-shot, or withering from
  disease, and not feel that he too held life on a startlingly uncertain
  tenure; that if the material were indeed all-in-all, he had no business
  there; that the ideal has a large share even in this life, and will probably
  constitute the very essence of that which is to come. It is a mistake to
  suppose that danger hardens the heart; on the contrary, it renders it
  peculiarly alive to the softer and kindlier emotions. The brave are nearly
  always gentler, more susceptible, than apparently weaker natures; and many a
  man who does not quail at the roar of a battery, who confronts an advancing
  column with a careless smile and a pleasant jest upon his lips, will wince
  like a child at an injury or an unkindness dealt him from the hand he
  loves.</p>

  <p>Ropsley, too, had many a pang of remorse to contend with, many an hour of
  unavailing regret, as he looked back to the mischief he had wrought by his
  unscrupulous schemes for his own benefit&mdash;the misery, to which in his
  now softened nature he was keenly alive, that a thoughtless selfishness had
  brought on his oldest and dearest friends. Poor Victor married in haste, when
  piqued and angry with one who, whatever might be her faults, was the only
  woman on earth to <i>him</i>. Constance Beverley, driven into this alliance
  by his own false representations, and her father's ill-judged vehemence.
  Another old school-fellow, whom he was at last beginning to value and esteem,
  attributing the wreck of all he hoped and cherished in the world to this
  fatal marriage; and he himself ere long wishing to be connected by the
  nearest and dearest ties with those whose future he had been so instrumental
  in blasting, and who could not but look upon him as the prime source and
  origin of all their unhappiness.</p>

  <p>No wonder Ropsley was an altered man; no wonder Victor's sudden and awful
  death made a still further impression on his awakened feelings; no wonder he
  prized the blessing he had won, and determined to make himself worthy of a
  lot the golden joys of which his youth would have sneered at and despised,
  but which he was grateful to find his manhood was capable of appreciating as
  they deserved.</p>

  <p>Happiness stimulates some tempers to action, as grief goads others to
  exertion; and Ropsley is not one to remain idle. Though Edeldorf has passed
  away from the name of De Rohan for evermore, he has attained a large fortune
  with his wife; but affluence and comfort alone will not fill up the measure
  of such a man's existence, and his energetic character will be sure to find
  some outlet for the talents and acquirements it possesses. Politics will
  probably be his sphere; and those who know of what efforts a bold far-seeing
  nature is capable, when backed by study, reflection, above all, common sense;
  and when blessed with a happy home of love on which to rest, and from which
  to gather daily new hope and strength, will not think me over sanguine in
  predicting that something more than a "<i>Hic Jacet</i>" will, in the fulness
  of time, be carved on Ropsley's tombstone; that he will do something more in
  his generation than eat and drink, and pay his son's debts, and make a will,
  and so lie down and die, and be forgotten.</p>

  <p>It is good to be firm, strong-minded, and practical; it is good to swim
  with the stream, and, without ever losing sight of the landing-place, to lose
  no advantage of the current, no lull of the back-water, no rippling eddy in
  one's favour. It is not good to struggle blindly on against wind and tide, to
  trust all to a gallant heart, to neglect the beacon and the landmark, to go
  down at last, unconquered it may be in spirit, but beaten and submerged for
  all that, in fact. There is an old tale of chivalry which bears with it a
  deep and somewhat bitter moral: of a certain knight who, in the madness of
  his love, vowed to cast aside his armour and ride three courses through the
  m&ecirc;l&eacute;e with no covering save his lady's night-weeds. Helm,
shield, and
  corslet, mail and plate, and stout buff jerkin, all are cast aside. With
  bared brow and naked breast the knight is up and away!&mdash;amongst those
  gathering warriors clad from head to foot in steel. Some noble
  hearts&mdash;God bless them!&mdash;turn aside to let him pass; but many a
  fierce blow and many a cruel thrust are delivered at the devoted champion in
  the throng. Twice, thrice he rides that fearful gauntlet; and ere his good
  horse stops, the white night-dress is fluttering in rags&mdash;torn and
  hacked, and saturated with blood. It is a tale of Romance, mark that! and the
  knight recovers, to be happy. Had it been Reality, his ladye might have wrung
  her hands over a clay-cold corpse in vain. Woe to him who sets lance in rest
  to ride a tournament with the world! Woe to the warm imagination, the kindly
  feelings, the generosity that scorns advantage, the soft and vulnerable
  heart! How it bleeds in the conflict, how it suffers in the defeat! Yet are
  there some battles in which it is perhaps nobler to lose than to win. Who
  shall say in what victory consists? "Discretion is the better part of
  valour," quoth Prudence; but Courage, with herald-voice, still shouts, "Fight
  on! brave knights, fight on!"</p>

  <p>In the tomb of his fathers, in a gloomy vault, where a light is constantly
  kept burning, sleeps Victor de Rohan, my boyhood's friend, my more than
  brother. Many a stout and warlike ancestor lies about him; many a bold
  Crusader, whose marble effigy, with folded hands and crossed legs, makes
  silent boast that he had struck for the good cause in the Holy Land, rests
  there, to shout and strike no more. Not one amongst them all that had a
  nobler heart than he who joined them in the flower of manhood&mdash;the last
  of his long and stainless line. As the old white-haired sexton opens the door
  of the vault to trim and replenish the glimmering death-lamp, a balmy breeze
  steals in and stirs the heavy silver fringe on the pall of Victor's
  coffin&mdash;a balmy breeze that plays round the statue of the Virgin on the
  chapel roof, and sweeps across many a level mile of plain, and many a fair
  expanse of wood and water, till it reaches the fragrant terraces and the
  frowning towers of distant Sieben-brgen&mdash;a balmy breeze that cools the
  brow of yon pale drooping lady, who turns an eager, wistful face towards its
  breath. For why? It blows direct from where he sleeps at Edeldorf.</p>

  <p>She is not even clad in mourning, yet who has mourned him as she has done?
  She might not even see him borne to his last home, yet who so willingly would
  lay her down by his side, to rest for ever with him in the grave?</p>

  <p>Alas for you, Rose, Princess Vocqsal!&mdash;you who must needs play with
  edged tools till they cut you to the quick!&mdash;you who must needs rouse
  passions that have blighted you to the core!&mdash;you who never knew you had
  a heart till the eve of St. Hubert's Day, and found it empty and broken on
  the morrow of that festival!</p>

  <p>She tends that old man now with the patience and devotion of a
  saint&mdash;that old childish invalid in his garden chair, prattling of his
  early exploits, playing contentedly with his little dog, fretful and
  impatient about his dinner. This is all that a paralytic stroke, acting on a
  constitution weakened by excess, has left of Prince Vocqsal.</p>

  <p>Nor is the wife less altered than her husband. Who would recognise in
  those pale sunken features, in that hair once so sunny, now streaked with
  whole masses of grey, in that languid step and listless, fragile form, the
  fresh, sparkling roseate beauty of the famous Princess Vocqsal? She has done
  with beauty now; she has done with love and light, and all that constitute
  the charm and the sunshine of life; but she has still a duty to perform; she
  has still an expiation to make; and with a force and determination which many
  a less erring nature might fail to imitate, she has set herself resolutely to
  the task.</p>

  <p>Save to attend to her religious duties, comprising many an act of severe
  and grievous penance, she never leaves her patient. All that woman's care and
  woman's tenderness can provide, she lavishes on that querulous invalid; with
  woman's instinct of loving that which she protects, he is dearer to her now
  than anything on earth; but oh! it is a sad, sad face that she turns to the
  breeze from Edeldorf.</p>

  <p>Her director comes to see her twice a day; he is a grave, stern
  priest&mdash;an old man who has shriven criminals on the scaffold&mdash;who
  has accustomed himself to read the most harrowing secrets of the human soul.
  He should be dead to sensibility, and blunted to all softer emotions, yet he
  often leaves the Princess with tears in his grave cold eyes.</p>

  <p>She is a Roman Catholic; do not therefore argue that her repentance may
  not avail. She has been a sinner&mdash;scarlet, if you will, of the deepest
  dye; do not therefore say that the door of mercy will be shut in her face.
  There are sins besides those of the feelings&mdash;crimes which spring from
  more polluted sources than the affections. The narrow gate is wide enough for
  all. If you are striving to reach it, walking hopefully along the strait
  path, it is better not to turn aside and take upon yourself the punishment of
  every prostrate bleeding sinner; if you must needs stop, why not bind the
  gaping wounds, and help the sufferer to resume the uphill journey? There are
  plenty of flints lying about, we know&mdash;heavy, sharp, and
  three-cornered&mdash;such as shall strike the poor cowering wretch to the
  earth, never to rise again. Which of us shall stoop to lift one of them in
  defiance of Divine mercy? Which of us shall dare to say, "I am qualified to
  cast the first stone at her"?</p>

  <h2><a id="ch47"
     name="ch47"></a>CHAPTER XLVII. &mdash; THE RETURN OF SPRING</h2>

  <p class="first">The smoke curls up once more from the chimneys of Alton
  Grange; the woman in possession, she with the soapy arms and unkempt hair,
  who was always cleaning with no result, has been paid for her occupancy and
  sent back to her own untidy home in the adjoining village. The windows are
  fresh painted, the lawn fresh mown, the garden trimmed, and the walks rolled;
  nay, the unwonted sound of wheels is sometimes heard upon the gravel sweep in
  front of the house, for the country neighbours, a race who wage unceasing war
  against anything mysterious, and whose thirst for "news," and energy in the
  acquisition of gossip, are as meritorious as they are uncalled for, have
  lavished their attentions on the solitary, and welcomed him back to his
  lonely home far more warmly than he deserves. The estate, too, has been at
  nurse ever since he went away. An experienced man of business has taken it
  into his own especial charge, but somehow the infant has not attained any
  great increase of vigour under his fostering care, and the proprietor is
  ungrateful enough to think he could have managed it better for himself.
  Inside, the house is dark and gloomy still. I miss poor Bold dreadfully.
  After a day of attention to those trivial details which the landowner
  dignifies with the title of "business," or worse still, of vacant, dreary
  hours passed in listless apathy, it is very lonely to return to a solitary
  dinner and a long silent evening, to feel that the wag of a dog's tail
  against the floor would be company, and to own there is solace in the
  sympathy even of a brute's unreasoning eye. It is not good for man to be
  alone, and that is essentially a morbid state in which solitude is felt to be
  a comfort and a relief; more especially does the want of occupation and
  companionship press upon one who has been leading a life of busy every-day
  excitement such as falls to the lot of the politician or the soldier; and it
  has always appeared to me that the worst of all possible preparations for the
  quiet, homely duties of a country gentleman, are the very two professions so
  generally chosen as the portals by which the heir of a landed estate is to
  enter life. It takes years to tame the soldier, and the politician seldom
  <i>really</i> settles down at all; but of course you will do what your
  fathers did&mdash;if the boy is dull, you will gird a sword upon his thigh;
  if he is conceited, you will get him into Parliament, and fret at the obtuse
  deafness of the House. Perhaps you may as well be disappointed one way as the
  other; whatever you do with him, by the time he is thirty you will wish you
  had done differently, and so will he. Action, however, is the only panacea
  for despondency; work, work, is the remedy for lowness of spirits. What am I
  that I should sit here with folded hands, and repine at the common lot? There
  are none so humble but they can do some little good, and in this the poor are
  far more active than the rich. Let me take example by the day labourers at my
  gate. There is a poor family not a mile from here who sadly lack assistance,
  and whom for the last fortnight I have neglected to visit. A gleam of
  sunshine breaks in through the mullioned window, and gilds even the black oak
  wainscoting: the clouds are passing rapidly away, I will take my hat and walk
  off at once towards the common. Oh, the hypocrisy of human motives! The poor
  family are tenants of Constance de Rohan; their cottage lies in the direct
  road to Beverley Manor.</p>

  <p>It has been raining heavily, and the earth is completely saturated with
  moisture. The late spring, late even for England, is bursting forth almost
  with tropical luxuriance. Dank and dripping, the fragrant hedges glisten in
  the noonday beams. Brimful is every blossom in the orchard, fit chalice for
  the wild bird or the bee. Thick and tufted, the wet grass sprouts luxuriantly
  in the meadow-lands where the cowslip hangs her scented head, and the
  buttercup, already dry, reflects the sunshine from its golden hollow. The
  yellow brook laughs merrily on beneath the foot-bridge, and the swallows
  shoot hither and thither high up against the clear blue sky. How fresh and
  tender is the early green of the noble elms in the foreground, and the
  distant larches on the hill. How sweet the breath of spring; how fair and
  lovable the smile upon her face. How full of hope and promise and life and
  light and joy. Oh, the giant capacity for happiness of the human heart! Oh,
  what a world it might be! What a world it is!</p>

  <p>The children are playing about before the door of the cottage on the
  common. Dirty, and noisy, and rosy, the little urchins stare, wonder-struck,
  at the stranger, and disappear tumultuously into certain back settlements,
  where there are a garden, and a beehive, and a pig. An air of increased
  comfort pervades the dwelling, and its mistress has lost the wan, anxious
  look it pained me so to see some ten days ago. With a corner of her apron she
  dusts a chair for me to sit down, and prepares herself for a gossip, in which
  experience tells me the talking will be all one way. "Her 'old man' is gone
  out to-day for the first time to his work. He is quite stout again at last,
  but them low fevers keeps a body down terrible, and the doctor's stuff was no
  good, and she thinks after all it's the fine weather as has brought him
  round; leastways, that and the broth Lady Beverley sent him from the Manor
  House; and she to come up herself only yesterday was a week, through a pour
  of rain, poor dear! for foreign parts has not agreed with her, and she's not
  so rosy as she were when I knew her first, but a born angel all the same, and
  ever will be."</p>

  <p>Tears were in the good woman's eyes, and her voice was choked. I stayed to
  hear no more. Lady Beverley, as she called her, was, then, once more at home.
  She had been here&mdash;here on this very spot, but one short week ago. I
  could have knelt down and kissed the very ground she had trodden. I longed if
  it was only to see her footprints. I, who had schooled myself to such a pitch
  of stoicism and apathy, who had stifled and rooted out and cut down the germs
  of passion till I had persuaded myself that they had ceased to exist, and
  that my heart had become hard and barren as the rock,&mdash;I, who had
  thought that when the time came I should meet her in London with a kindly
  greeting, as became an old friend, and never turn to look the way she went;
  and now, because she had been here a week ago, because there was a
  possibility of her being at the moment within three miles of where I stood,
  to feel the blood mounting to my brow, the tears starting to my
  eyes,&mdash;oh! it was scarlet shame, and yet it was burning happiness
  too.</p>

  <p>The sun shone brighter, the birds sang more merrily now. There was no
  longer a mockery in the spring. The dry branch seemed to blossom once
  more&mdash;the worn and weary nature to imbibe fresh energies and renewed
  life. There was hope on this side the grave, hope that might be cherished
  without bitterness or remorse. Very dark had been the night, but day was
  breaking at last. Very bitter and tedious had been the winter, but spring,
  real spring, was bursting forth. I could hardly believe in the prospect of
  happiness thus opened to me. I trembled to think of what would be my destiny
  if I should lose it all again.</p>

  <p>In the ecstasy of joy, as in the tumult of uncertainty and the agony of
  grief, there is but one resource for failing human strength, how feeble and
  failing none know so well as those whom their fellows deem the noblest and
  the strongest. That resource has never yet played man false at his need. The
  haughty brow may be compelled to stoop, the boasted force of will be turned
  aside, the proud spirit be broken and humbled to the dust, the race be lost
  to the swift and the battle go against the strong, but the victory shall be
  wrested, the goal shall be attained by the clasped hands and the bended
  knees, and the loving heart that through good and evil has trusted
  steadfastly to the end.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I may lock the old desk now. I have told my tale; 'tis but
  the every-day story of the ups and downs of life&mdash;the winnings and
  losings of the game we all sit down to play. One word more, and I have
  done.</p>

  <p>In the solitude of my chamber I took from its hiding-place a withered
  flower; once it had been a beautiful white rose, how beautiful, how
  cherished, none knew so well as I. Long and steadfastly I gazed at it,
  conjuring up the while a vision of that wild night, with its flying clouds
  and its waving fir-trees, and the mocking moonlight shining coldly on the
  gravel path, and the bitterness of that hour, the bitterness of all that had
  yet fallen to my lot, and so I fell asleep. And behold it seemed to be noon,
  midsummer-noon in a garden of flowers, hot and bright and beautiful. The
  butterfly flitted in the sunshine, and the wood-pigeon mourned sweetly and
  sadly in the shade. Little children with laughing eyes played and rolled
  about upon the sward, and ran up, warm and eager, to offer me posies of the
  choicest flowers. One by one I refused them all, for amongst the pride of the
  garden there was none to me like my own withered rose that I had cherished so
  long, and I turned away from each as it was brought me, and pressed her
  closer to my heart where she always lay.</p>

  <p>Then, even as I clasped her she bloomed in her beauty once more, fresh and
  pure and radiant as of old, steeping my very soul in fragrance, a child of
  earth indeed, but wafting her sweetness up to heaven.</p>

  <p>And I awoke, and prayed that it might not be all a dream.</p>
