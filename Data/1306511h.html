  <h2><a name="ch01"
     id="ch01">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The busy turmoil of the town had been hushed for some hours;
  the moon and stars were keeping silent watch over Alexandria, and many of the
  inhabitants were already in the land of dreams. It was deliciously
  fresh&mdash;a truly gracious night; but, though peace reigned in the streets
  and alleys, even now there was in this pause for rest a lack of the soothing
  calm which refreshes and renews the spirit of man. For some few weeks there
  had been an oppressive and fevered tension in the repose of night. Every
  house and shop was closed as securely as though it were done, not only to
  secure slumber against intrusion, but to protect life and property from the
  spoiler; and instead of tones of jollity and mirth the sleeping city echoed
  the heavy steps and ringing arms of soldiers. Now and again, when the Roman
  word of command or the excited cry of some sleepless monk broke the silence,
  shops and doors were cautiously opened and an anxious face peered out, while
  belated wanderers shrunk into gateways or under the black shadow of a wall as
  the watch came past. A mysterious burden weighed on the Heart of the busy
  city and clicked its pulses, as a nightmare oppresses the dreamer.</p>

  <p>On this night of the year of our Lord 391, in a narrow street leading from
  the commercial harbor known as Kibotus, an old man was slinking along close
  to the houses. His clothes were plain but decent, and he walked with his head
  bent forward looking anxiously on all sides; when the patrol came by he
  shrank into the shadow; though he was no thief he had his reasons for keeping
  out of the way of the soldiery, for the inhabitants, whether natives or
  strangers, were forbidden to appear in the streets after the harbor was
  closed for the night.</p>

  <p>He stopped in front of a large house, whose long, windowless wall extended
  from one side street to the next, and pausing before the great gate, he read
  an inscription on which the light fell from a lamp above: "The House of the
  Holy Martyr. His widow here offers shelter to all who need it. He that giveth
  to the poor lendeth to the Lord."</p>

  <p>"At how much per cent I wonder?" mattered the old man and a satirical
  smile curled his bearuless lips. A heavy thud with the knocker rang through
  the silent street, and after a few short questions from within and equally
  curt replies from without, a small door was opened in the great gate. The
  stranger was on the point of crossing the vestibule when a human creature
  crept up to him on all fours, and clutched his ancle with a strong hand,
  exclaiming in a hoarse voice: "As soon as the door is shut&mdash;an entrance
  fee; for the poor, you know."</p>

  <p>The old man flung a copper piece to the gatekeeper who tried it, and then,
  holding on to the rope by which he was tied to a post like a watch-dog, he
  whined out "Not a drop to wet a Christian's lips?"</p>

  <p>"It has not rained for some time," retorted the stranger, who proceeded to
  open a second door which led into a vast court-yard open to the blue vault of
  heaven. A few torches stuck against the pillars and a small fire on the
  pavement added thin smoky, flickering light to the clear glory of the stars,
  and the whole quadrangle was full of a heavy, reeking atmosphere, compounded
  of smoke and the steam of hot food.</p>

  <p>Even in the street the wanderer had heard the dull buzz and roar which now
  met his ear as a loud medley of noises and voices, rising from hundreds of
  men who were encamped in the wide space before him&mdash;in groups or singly,
  sleeping and snoring, or quarrelling, eating, talking and singing as they
  squatted on the ground which was strewn with straw.</p>

  <p>The inn was full, and more than half of the humble guests were monks who,
  during the last two days, had flowed into the city from every Cenoby, Laura
  and hermitage in the desert, and from most of the monasteries in the
  surrounding district&mdash;the 'Nitriote Nome'. Some of them had laid their
  heads close together for confidential whispering, others squabbled loudly,
  and a large group in the northern angle of the court had raised a psalm which
  mingled strangely with the "three," "four," "seven," of the men who were
  playing 'mora', and the cry of the cook inviting purchasers to his stall
  spread with meat, bread, and onions.</p>

  <p>At the end of the court furthest from the gateway there was a covered way,
  on to which a row of doors opened leading to the rooms devoted to families of
  women and children, each apartment being divided into two by a curtain across
  the middle. The stranger made his way into one of these rooms, where he was
  warmly welcomed by a young man, who was occupied in cutting a Kopais reed
  into a mouth-piece for a double flute, and by a tall matronly woman.</p>

  <p>The new-comer's name was Karnis and he was the head of a family of
  wandering singers who had arrived in Alexandria only the day before from
  Rome. His surroundings were poor and mean, for their ship had been attacked
  off the African coast by a band of pirates, and though they had saved their
  lives they had lost everything they possessed. The young owner of the vessel,
  to whom he owed his safety, had procured him admission to this Xenodochium,*
  kept by his mother the Widow Mary; Karnis had, however, found it far from
  comfortable, and had gone forth at noon to seek other quarters.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* A refuge or inn. ]</p>

  <p>"All in vain!" said he, as he wiped the heat drops from his forehead. "I
  have hunted Medius half the city through and found him at last at the house
  of Posidonius the Magian, whose assistant he is. There was singing behind a
  curtain&mdash;wretched rubbish; but there were some old airs too with an
  accompaniment on the flutes, in the style of Olympus, and really not so
  bad.</p>

  <p>"Then spirits appeared. By Sirius a queer business altogether! Medius is
  in the midst of it all. I arranged the chorus and sang with them a little.
  All I got for it was a little dirty silver&mdash;there! But as for a
  lodging&mdash;free quarters!&mdash;there are none to be found here for
  anything above an owl; and then there is the edict&mdash;that cursed
  edict!"</p>

  <p>During this speech the younger man had exchanged meaning glances with his
  mother. He now interrupted Karnis, saying in a tone of encouragement:</p>

  <p>"Never mind, father; we have something good in view."</p>

  <p>"You have?" said the old man with an incredulous shrug, while his wife
  served him with a small roast chicken, on a stool which did duty for a
  table.</p>

  <p>"Yes father, we!" the lad went on, laying aside his knife. "You know we
  vowed an offering to Dionysus for our escape, since he himself once fell into
  the hands of pirates, so we went at once to his temple. Mother knew the way;
  and as we&mdash;she, I mean, and Dada and myself..."</p>

  <p>"Heh! what is this?" interrupted Karnis, now for the first time noticing
  the dish before him. "A fowl&mdash;when we are so miserably poor? A whole
  fowl, and cooked with oil?" He spoke angrily, but his wife, laying her hand
  on his shoulder, said soothingly:</p>

  <p>"We shall soon earn it again. Never a sesterce was won by fretting. Enjoy
  to-day's gifts and the gods will provide for to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" asked Karnis in an altered key. "To be sure when a roast fowl
  flies into one's mouth instead of a pigeon... But you are right as usual,
  Herse, as usual, only&mdash;here am I battening like a senator while
  you&mdash;I lay a wager you have drunk nothing but milk all day and eaten
  nothing but bread and radishes. I thought so? Then the chicken must pretend
  to be a pheasant and you, wife, will eat this leg. The girls are gone to bed?
  Why here is some wine too! Fill up your cup, boy. A libation to the God!
  Glory to Dionysus!" The two men poured the libation on the floor and drank;
  then the father thrust his knife into the breast of the bird and began his
  meal with a will, while Orpheus, the son, went on with his story:</p>

  <p>"Well, the temple of Dionysus was not to be found, for Bishop Theophilus
  has had it destroyed; so to what divinity could we offer our wreath and cake?
  Here in Egypt there is none but the great Mother Isis. Her sanctuary is on
  the shore of Lake Mareotis and mother found it at once. There she fell into
  conversation with a priestess who, as soon as she learnt that my mother
  belonged to a family of musicians&mdash;though Dame Herse was cautious in
  announcing this fact&mdash;and hoped to find employment in Alexandria, led
  her away to a young lady who was closely veiled. This lady," Orpheus went
  on&mdash;he not only played the flute but took the higher parts for a man's
  voice and could also strike the lyre&mdash;"desired us to go to her later at
  her own house, where she would speak with us. She drove off in a fine
  carriage and we, of course followed her orders; Agne was with us too. A
  splendid house! I never saw anything handsomer in Rome or Antioch. We were
  kindly received, and with the lady there were another very old lady and a
  tall grave man, a priest I should fancy or a philosopher, or something of
  that kind."</p>

  <p>"Not some Christian trap?" asked Karnis suspiciously. "You do not know
  this place, and since the edict..."</p>

  <p>"Never fear, father! There were images of the gods in the halls and
  corridors, and in the room where we were received by Gorgo, the beautiful
  daughter of Porphyrius, there was an altar before an image of Isis, quite
  freshly anointed.&mdash;This Porphyrius is a very rich merchant; we learnt
  that afterwards, and many other things. The philosopher asked us at once
  whether we were aware that Theodosius had lately promulgated a new edict
  forbidding young maidens to appear in public as singers or
  flute-players."</p>

  <p>"And did Agne hear that?" said the old man in a low voice as he pointed to
  the curtain.</p>

  <p>"No, she and Dada were in the garden on to which the room opened, and
  mother explained at once that though Agne was a Christian she was a very good
  girl, and that so long as she remained in our service she was bound to sing
  with us whenever she was required. The philosopher exclaimed at once: 'The
  very thing!' and they whispered together, and called the girls and desired
  them to show what they could do."</p>

  <p>"And how did they perform?" asked the old man, who was growing
  excited.</p>

  <p>"Dada warbled like a lark, and Agne&mdash;well you know how it always is.
  Her voice sounded lovely but it was just as usual. You can guess how much
  there is in her and how deep her feeling is but she never quite brings it
  out. What has she to complain of with us? And yet whatever she sings has that
  mournful, painful ring which even you can do nothing to alter. However, she
  pleased them better than Dada did, for I noticed that Gorgo and the gentleman
  glanced at each other and at her, and whispered a word now and then which
  certainly referred to Ague. When they had sung two songs the young lady came
  towards us and praised both the girls, and asked whether we would undertake
  to learn something quite new. I told her that my father was a great musician
  who could master the most difficult things at the first hearing."</p>

  <p>"The most difficult! Hm ... that depends," said the old man. "Did she show
  it you?"</p>

  <p>"No; it is something in the style of Linus and she sang it to us."</p>

  <p>"The daughter of the rich Porphyrius sang for your entertainment? Yours?"
  said Karnis laughing. "By Sirius! The world is turning upside down. Now that
  girls are forbidden to perform to the gentlefolks, art is being cultivated by
  the upper classes; it cannot be killed outright. For the future the listeners
  will be paid to keep quiet and the singers pay for the right of torturing
  their ears&mdash;our ears, our luckless ears will be victimized."</p>

  <p>Orpheus smiled and shook his head; then, again dropping his knife, he went
  on eagerly:</p>

  <p>"But if you could only hear her! You would give your last copper piece to
  hear her again."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" muttered his father. "Well, there are very good teachers here.
  Something by Linus did you say she sang?"</p>

  <p>"Something of that kind; a lament for the dead of very great power:
  'Return, oh! return my beloved, came back&mdash;come home!' that was the
  burthen of it. And there was a passage which said: 'Oh that each tear had a
  voice and could join with me in calling thee!' And how she sang it, father! I
  do not think I ever in my life heard anything like it. Ask mother. Even
  Dada's eyes were full of tears."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was beautiful," the mother agreed. "I could not help wishing that
  you were there."</p>

  <p>Karnis rose and paced the little room, waving his arms and muttering:</p>

  <p>"Ah! so that is how it is! A friend of the Muses. We saved the large
  lute&mdash;that is well. My chlamys has an ugly hole in it&mdash;if the girls
  were not asleep ... but the first thing to-morrow Ague... Tell me, is she
  handsome, tall?"</p>

  <p>Herse had been watching her excitable husband with much satisfaction and
  now answered his question: "Not a Hera&mdash;not a Muse&mdash;decidedly not.
  Hardly above the middle height, slightly made, but not small, black eyes,
  long lashes, dark straight eyebrows. I could hardly, like Orpheus, call her
  beautiful..."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, mother.&mdash;Beautiful is a great word, and one my father has
  taught me to use but rarely; but she&mdash;if she is not beautiful who
  is?&mdash;when she raised her large dark eyes and threw back her head to
  bring out her lament; tone after tone seemed to come from the bottom of her
  heart and rise to the furthest height of heaven. Ah, if Agne could learn to
  sing like that! 'Throw your whole soul into your singing.'&mdash;You have
  told her that again and again. Now, Gorgo can and does. And she stood there
  as steady and as highly strung as a bow, every note came out with the ring of
  an arrow and went straight to the heart, as clear and pure as possible."</p>

  <p>"Be silent!" cried the old man covering his ears with his hands. "I shall
  not close an eye till daylight, and then ... Orpheus, take that
  silver&mdash;take it all, I have no more&mdash;go early to market and buy
  flowers&mdash;laurel branches, ivy, violets and roses. But no lotuses though
  the market here is full of them; they are showy, boastful things with no
  scent, I cannot bear them. We will go crowned to the Temple of the
  Muses."</p>

  <p>"Buy away, buy all you want!" said Herse laughing, as she showed her
  husband some bright gold pieces. "We got that to-day, and if all is well...
  "Here she paused, pointed to the curtain, and went on again in a lower tone:
  "It all depends of course, on Agne's playing us no trick."</p>

  <p>"How so? Why? She is a good girl and I will..."</p>

  <p>"No, no," said Herse holding him back. "She does not know yet what the
  business is. The lady wants her..."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"To sing in the Temple of Isis."</p>

  <p>Karnis colored. He was suddenly called from a lovely dream back to the
  squalid reality. "In the Temple of Isis," he said gloomily. "Agne? In the
  face of all the people? And she knows nothing about it?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, father."</p>

  <p>"No? Well then, if that is the case ... Agne, the Christian, in the Temple
  of Isis&mdash;here, here, where Bishop Theophilus is destroying all our
  sanctuaries and the monks outdo their master. Ah, children, children, how
  pretty and round and bright a soap-bubble is, and how soon it bursts. Do you
  know at all what it is that you are planning? If the black flies smell it out
  and it becomes known, by the great Apollo! we should have fared better at the
  hands of the pirates. And yet, and yet.&mdash;Do you know at all how the girl
  ...?"</p>

  <p>"She wept at the lady's singing," interrupted Herse eagerly, "and, silent
  as she generally is, on her way home she said: 'To sing like that! She is a
  happy girl!'"</p>

  <p>Karnis looked up with renewed confidence.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, "that is my Agne. Yes, yes, she truly loves her divine
  art. She can sing, she will sing! We will venture it, if you, I, all of us
  die for it!</p>

  <p>"Herse, Orpheus, what have we to lose? Our gods, too, shall have their
  martyrs. It is a poor life that has no excitement. Our art&mdash;why, all I
  have ever had has been devoted to it. I make no boast of having sacrificed
  everything, and if gold and lands were again to be mine I would become a
  beggar once more for the sake of art: We have always held the divine Muse
  sacred, but who can keep up a brave heart when he sees her persecuted! She
  may only be worshipped in darkness in these days, and the Queen of Gods and
  men shuns the light like a moth, a bat, an owl. If we must die let it be with
  and for Her! Once more let pure and perfect song rejoice this old heart, and
  if afterwards ... My children, we have no place in this dim, colorless world.
  While the Arts lived there was Spring on the earth. Now they are condemned to
  death and it is Winter. The leaves fall from all the trees, and we piping
  birds need groves to sing in. How often already has Death laid his hand on
  our shoulder, every breath we draw is a boon of mercy&mdash;the extra length
  given in by the weaver, the hour of grace granted by the hangman to his
  victim! Our lives are no longer our own, a borrowed purse with damaged copper
  coins. The hard-hearted creditor has already bent his knuckles, and when he
  knocks the time is up. Once more let us have one hour of pure and perfect
  enjoyment, and then we will pay up capital and interest when we must."</p>

  <p>"It cannot and will not be yet," said Herse resolutely, but she wiped her
  eyes with her band. "If Agne sings even, so long as she does it without
  coercion and of her own free-will no Bishop can punish us."</p>

  <p>"He cannot, he dare not!" cried the old man. "There are still laws and
  judges."</p>

  <p>"And Gorgo's family is influential as well as rich. Porphyrius has power
  to protect us, and you do not yet know what a fancy he has taken to us. Ask
  mother."</p>

  <p>"It is like a story," Herse put in. "Before we left, the old
  lady&mdash;she must be eighty or more&mdash;took me aside and asked me where
  we were lodging. I told her at the Widow Mary's and when she heard it she
  struck her crutch on the floor. 'Do you like the place?' she asked. I told
  her not at all, and said we could not possibly stop here."</p>

  <p>"Quite right!" cried Karnis. "The monks in the court-yard will kill us as
  dead as rats if they hear us learning heathen hymns."</p>

  <p>"That is what I told her; but the old lady did not allow me to finish; she
  drew me close to her and whispered, 'only do as my granddaughter wishes and
  you shall be safely housed and take this for the present'&mdash;and she put
  her hand into the purse at her girdle, gave the gold into my hand, and added
  loud enough for the others to hear: 'Fifty gold pieces out of my own pocket
  if Gorgo tells me that she is satisfied with your performance.'"</p>

  <p>"Fifty gold pieces!" cried Karnis clasping his hands. "That brightens up
  the dull grey of existence. Fifty, then, are certain. If we sing six times
  that makes a talent,* and that will buy back our old vineyard at Leontium. I
  will repair the old Odeum&mdash;they have made a cowhouse of it&mdash;and
  when we sing there the monks may come and listen! You laugh? But you are
  simpletons&mdash;I should like to see who will forbid my singing on my own
  land and in my own country. A talent of gold!</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Estimated in 1880 at $1100 ]</p>

  <p>"It is quite enough to pay on account, and I will not agree to any bargain
  that will not give me the field-slaves and cattle. Castles in the air, do you
  say? But just listen to me: We are sure you see of a hundred gold pieces at
  least..." He had raised his voice in his eagerness and while he spoke the
  curtains had been softly opened, and the dull glimmer of the lamp which stood
  in front of Orpheus fell on a head which was charming in spite of its
  disorder. A quantity of loose fair hair curled in papers stuck up all over
  the round head and fell over the forehead, the eyes were tired and still half
  shut, but the little mouth was wide awake and laughing with the frank
  amusement of light-hearted youth.</p>

  <p>Karnis, without noticing the listener, had gone on with his visionary
  hopes of regaining his estates by his next earnings, but at this point the
  young girl, holding the curtain in her right hand, stretched out her plump
  left arm and begged in a humble whine:</p>

  <p>"Good father Karnis, give me a little of your wealth; five poor little
  drachmae!"</p>

  <p>The old man started; but he instantly recovered himself and answered good-
  naturedly enough:</p>

  <p>"Go back to bed, you little hussy. You ought to be asleep instead of
  listening there!"</p>

  <p>"Asleep?" said the girl. "While you are shouting like an orator against
  the wind! Five drachmae, father. I stick to that. A new ribband for me will
  cost one, and the same for Agne, two. Two I will spend on wine for us all,
  and that makes the five."</p>

  <p>"That makes four&mdash;you are a great arithmetician to be sure!"</p>

  <p>"Four?" said Dada, as much amazed as though the moon had fallen. "If only
  I had a counting-frame. No, father, five I tell you&mdash;it is five."</p>

  <p>"No, child, four; and you shall have four," replied her father. "Plutus is
  at the door and to-morrow morning you shall both have garlands."</p>

  <p>"Yes, of violets, ivy and roses," added Dame Herse. "Is Agne asleep?"</p>

  <p>"As sound as the dead. She always sleeps soundly unless she lies wide
  awake all the night through. But we were both so tired&mdash;and I am still.
  It is a comfort to yawn. Do you see how I am sitting?"</p>

  <p>"On the clothes-chest?" said Herse.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and the curtain is not a strong back to the seat. Fortunately if I
  fall asleep I shall drop forwards, not backwards."</p>

  <p>"But there is a bed for each of you," said the mother, and giving the girl
  a gentle push she followed her into the sleeping-alcove. In a few minutes she
  came out again.</p>

  <p>"That is just like Dada!" she exclaimed. "Little Papias had rolled off the
  chest on which he was sleeping, so the good girl had put him into her bed and
  was sitting on the chest herself, tired as she was."</p>

  <p>"She would do anything for that boy," said Karnis. "But it is past
  midnight. Come, Orpheus, let us make the bed!"</p>

  <p>Three long hen-coops which stood piled against the wall were laid on the
  ground and covered with mats; on these the tired men stretched their limbs,
  but they could not sleep.</p>

  <p>The little lamp was extinguished, and for an hour all was still in the
  dark room. Then, suddenly, there was a loud commotion; some elastic object
  flew against the wall with a loud flap, and Karnis, starting up, called out:
  "Get out&mdash;monster!"</p>

  <p>"What is it?" cried Herse who had also been startled, and the old man
  replied angrily:</p>

  <p>"Some daemon, some dog of a daemon is attacking me and giving me no peace.
  Wait, you villain&mdash;there, perhaps that will settle you," and he flung
  his second sandal. Then, without heeding the rustling fall of some object
  that he had hit by accident, he gasped out:</p>

  <p>"The impudent fiend will not let me be. It knows that we need Agne's
  voice, and it keeps whispering, first in one ear and then in the other, that
  I should threaten to sell her little brother if she refuses; but
  I&mdash;I&mdash;strike a light, Orpheus!&mdash;She is a good girl and rather
  than do such a thing..."</p>

  <p>"The daemon has been close to me too," said the son as he blew on the
  spark he had struck.</p>

  <p>"And to me too," added Herse nervously. "It is only natural. There are no
  images of the gods in this Christian hovel. Away, hateful serpent! We are
  honest folks and will not agree to any vile baseness. Here is my amulet,
  Karnis; if the daemon comes again you must turn it round&mdash;you know
  how."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch02"
     id="ch02">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Early next morning the singers set out for the house of
  Porphyrius. The party was not complete, however, for Dada had been forced to
  remain at home. The shoes that the old man had flung to scare away the daemon
  had caught in the girl's dress which she had just washed, and had dragged it
  down on to the earth; she had found it in the morning full of holes burnt by
  the ashes into the damp material. Dada had no other presentable garment, so,
  in spite of her indignant refusal and many tears, she had to remain indoors
  with Papias. Agne's anxious offers to stay in her place with the little boy
  and to lend Dada her dress, both Karnis and his wife had positively refused;
  and Dada had lent her aid&mdash;at first silently though willingly and then
  with her usual merriment&mdash;in twining garlands for the others and in
  dressing Agne's smooth black plaits with a wreath of ivy and violets.</p>

  <p>The men were already washed, anointed and crowned with poplar and laurel
  when a steward arrived from Porphyrius to bid them follow him to his master's
  house. But a small sacrifice was necessary, for the messenger desired them to
  lay aside their wreaths, which would excite ill-feeling among the monks, and
  certainly be snatched off by the Christian mob. Karnis when he started was
  greatly disappointed, and as much depressed as he had been triumphant and
  hopeful a short time before.</p>

  <p>The monks, who had gathered outside the Xenodochium, glanced with scowling
  suspicion at the party, who could not recover the good spirits with which
  they had begun the day till they were fairly out of the narrow, gloomy
  alleys, reeking with tar and salt fish, that adjoined the harbor, and where
  they had to push their way through a dense throng. The steward led the van
  with Herse, talking freely in reply to her enquiries.</p>

  <p>His master, he said, was one of the great merchants of the city, whose
  wife had died twenty years since in giving birth to Gorgo. His two sons were
  at present absent on their travels. The old lady who had been so liberal in
  her treatment of the singers was Damia, the mother of Porphyrius. She had a
  fine fortune of her own, and notwithstanding her great age was still
  respected as the soul of business in the household, and as a woman deeply
  versed in the mysterious sciences. Mary, the pious Christian, who had founded
  the "House of the Holy Martyr," was the widow of Apelles, the brother of
  Porphyrius, but she had ceased all intercourse with her husband's family.
  This was but natural, as she was at the head of the Christian women of
  Alexandria, while the household of Porphyrius&mdash;though the master himself
  had been baptized&mdash;was as thoroughly heathen as any in Alexandria.</p>

  <p>Karnis heard nothing of all this, for he came last of the party. Orpheus
  and Agne followed next to Herse and the steward, and after them came two
  slaves, carrying the lutes and pipes. Agne walked with downcast eyes, as if
  she desired to avoid seeing all that surrounded her, though when Orpheus
  addressed her she shyly glanced up at him and answered briefly and timidly.
  They presently came out of an obscure alley by the canal connecting Kibotus
  with Lake Mareotis where the Nile-boats lay at anchor. Karnis drew a deeper
  breath, for here the air was clear and balmy; a light northerly breeze
  brought the refreshing fragrance of the sea, and the slender palm-trees that
  bordered the canal threw long shadows mingling with the massive shade of the
  sycamores. The road was astir with busy groups, birds sang in the trees, and
  the old musician drank in the exciting and aromatic atmosphere of the
  Egyptian Spring with keen enjoyment.</p>

  <p>As they reached the middle of the steep bridge across the canal he
  involuntarily stood still, riveted by the view of the southwest. In his
  excitement he threw up his arms, his eyes glistened with moisture and with
  the enthusiasm of youth, and, as was always the case when his emotions were
  stirred by some glorious work of God or man, an image rose to his mind, all
  unbidden&mdash;the image of his eldest son, now dead, but in life his closest
  and most sympathetic comrade. He felt as though his hand could grasp the
  shoulder of that son, too early snatched away, whose gifts had far
  transcended those of the surviving Orpheus&mdash;as though he too could gaze
  with him on the grand scene that lay before him.</p>

  <p>On a platform of rocks and mighty masonry rose a structure of wonderful
  magnificence and beauty, so brilliantly illuminated by the morning sun that
  its noble proportions and gorgeous colors showed in dazzling splendor and
  relief. Over the gilt dome bent the cloudless blue of the African sky, and
  the polished hemisphere shone, as radiant as the sun whose beams it
  reflected. Sloping planes for vehicles, and flights of steps for pedestrians
  led up to the gates. The lower part of this wonderful edifice&mdash;the great
  Temple of Serapis&mdash;was built to stand forever, and the pillars of the
  vestibule supported a roof more fitted to the majesty of the gods than to the
  insignificance of mortals; priests and worshippers moved here like children
  among the trunks of some gigantic forest. Round the cornice, in hundreds of
  niches, and on every projection, all the gods of Olympus and all the heroes
  and sages of Greece seemed to have met in conclave, and stood gazing down on
  the world in gleaming brass or tinted marble. Every portion of the building
  blazed with gold and vivid coloring; the painter's hand had added life to the
  marble groups in high relief that filled the pediments and the smaller
  figures in the long row of metopes. All the population of a town might have
  found refuge in the vast edifice and its effect on the mind was like that of
  a harmonious symphony of adoration sung by a chorus of giants.</p>

  <p>"All hail! Great Serapis! I greet thee in joyful humility, thankful that
  Thou hast granted to my old eyes to see Thy glorious and eternal temple once
  again!" murmured Karnis in devout contemplation. Then, appealing to his wife
  and son, he pointed in silence to the building. Presently, however, as he
  watched Orpheus gazing in speechless delight at its magnificent proportions
  he could not forbear.</p>

  <p>"This," he began with fervid enthusiasm, "is the stronghold of Serapis the
  King of the Gods! A work for all time. Its youth has lasted five hundred
  years, its future will extend to all eternity.&mdash;Aye, so it is; and so
  long as it endures in all its glory the old gods cannot be deposed!"</p>

  <p>"No one will ever dare to touch a stone of it," said the steward. "Every
  child in Alexandria knows that the world will crumble into dust and ashes if
  a finger is laid on that Temple, and the man who ventures to touch the sacred
  image..."</p>

  <p>"The god can protect himself!" interrupted the singer. "But you&mdash;you
  Christian hypocrites who pretend to hate life and love death&mdash;if you
  really long so vehemently for the end of all things, you have only to fall
  upon this glorious structure.&mdash;Do that, do that&mdash;only do that!"</p>

  <p>The old man shook his fist at the invisible foe and Herse echoed his
  words:</p>

  <p>"Aye, aye, only do that!" Then she added more calmly: "Well, if everything
  comes to an end at once the enemies of the gods will die with us; and there
  can be nothing terrible in perishing at the same time with everything that is
  beautiful or dear to us."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," said the steward, "the Bishop has put out his hand to
  touch the sanctuary. But our noble Olympius would not suffer the sacrilegious
  host to approach, and they had to retire with broken heads. Serapis will not
  be mocked; he will stand though all else perish. 'Eternity,'the priest tells
  us, 'is to him but as an instant, and while millions of generations bloom and
  fade, he is still and forever the same!'"</p>

  <p>"Hail, all hail to the great god!" cried Orpheus with hands outstretched
  towards the temple.</p>

  <p>"Yea, hail! for everlasting glory shall be his!" repeated his father.
  "Great is Serapis, and his house and his image shall last..."</p>

  <p>"Till the next full moon!" said a passer-by in a tone of sinister mockery,
  shaking his fist in the face, as it were, of the god. Orpheus turned quickly
  to punish the prophet of evil; but he had disappeared in the crowd and the
  tide of men had borne him onwards. "Till the next full moon!" murmured Agne,
  who had shuddered at her companion's rapturous ejaculations, and she glanced
  uneasily at Orpheus; but by the time Herse addressed her a minute or two
  later she had controlled the expression of her features, and the matron's
  heart was gladdened by her bright smile. Nay, many a young Alexandrian,
  passing the group on foot or in a carriage, looked at her a second time, for
  that smile lent a mysterious charm to her pale, calm face. Nor had it faded
  away when they had crossed the bridge and were nearing the shores of the
  lake, for an idea once conceived lingered long in Agne's mind; and as she
  walked on in the bright glory of the morning's sun her mind's eye was fixed
  on a nocturnal scene&mdash;on the full moon, high in the sky&mdash;on the
  overthrow of the great idol and a glittering army among the marble ruins of
  the Serapeum. Apostles and martyrs soared around, the Saviour sat enthroned
  in glory and triumph, while angels, cradled on the clouds that were his
  footstool, were singing beatific hymns which sounded clearly in her ear above
  the many-voiced tumult of the quays. The vision did not vanish till she was
  desired to get into the boat.</p>

  <p>Herse was a native of Alexandria and Karnis had passed some of the best
  years of his life there; but to Orpheus and Agne all was new, and even the
  girl, when once she had escaped from the crowd and noise which oppressed her,
  took an interest in the scene and asked a question now and then. The younger
  man had not eyes enough to see all that claimed his attention and
  admiration.</p>

  <p>There were the great sluice-gates at the entrance to the canal that joined
  the lake to the sea&mdash;there, in a separate dock, lay the splendid
  imperial Nile-boats which served to keep up communication between the
  garrison of Alexandria and the military stations on the river&mdash;there,
  again, were the gaudy barges intended for the use of the 'comes', the prefect
  and other high officials&mdash;and there merchant-vessels of every size lay
  at anchor in countless number. Long trains of many-colored sails swept over
  the rippling lake like flights of birds across a cornfield, and every inch of
  the shore was covered with stores or buildings. Far away to the south long
  trellices of vine covered the slopes, broken by the silvery glaucous tones of
  the olive-groves, and by clumps of towering palms whose crowns mingled to
  form a lofty canopy. White walls, gaudily-painted temples and private villas
  gleamed among the green, and the slanting rays of the low sun, shining on the
  drops that fell from the never-resting wheels and buckets that irrigated the
  land, turned them into showers of diamonds. These water-works, of the most
  ingenious construction, many of them invented and contrived by scientific
  engineers, were the weapons with which man had conquered the desert that
  originally surrounded this lake, forcing it into green fertility and
  productiveness of grain and fruit. Nay, the desert had, for many centuries,
  here ceased to exist. Dionysus the generous, and the kindly garden-gods had
  blest the toil of men, and yet, now, in many a plot&mdash;in all which
  belonged to Christian owners&mdash;their altars lay scattered and
  overthrown.</p>

  <p>During the last thirty years much indeed was changed, and nothing to the
  satisfaction of old Karnis; Herse, too, shook her head, and when the rowers
  had pulled them about half-way across, she pointed to a broad vacant spot on
  the bank where a new building was just rising above the soil, and said sadly
  to her husband:</p>

  <p>"Would you know that place again? Where is our dear old temple gone? The
  temple of Dionysus." Karnis started up so hastily that he almost upset the
  boat, and their conductor was obliged to insist on his keeping quiet; he
  obeyed but badly, however, for his arms were never still as he broke out:</p>

  <p>"And do you suppose that because we are in Egypt I can keep my living body
  as still as one of your dead mummies? Let others keep still if they can! I
  say it is shameful, disgraceful; a dove's gall might rise at it! That
  splendid building, the pride of the city and the delight of men's eyes,
  destroyed&mdash;swept away like dust from the road! Do you see? Do you see, I
  say? Broken columns, marble capitals, here, there and everywhere at the
  bottom of the lake&mdash;here a head and there a torso! Great and noble
  masters formed those statues by the aid of the gods, and they&mdash;they,
  small and ignoble as they are, have destroyed them by the aid of evil
  daemons. They have annihilated and drowned works that were worthy to live
  forever! And why? Shall I tell you? Because they shun the Beautiful as an owl
  shuns light. Aye, they do! There is nothing they hate or dread so much as
  beauty; wherever they find it, they deface and destroy it, even if it is the
  work of the Divinity. I accuse them before the Immortals&mdash;for where is
  the grove even, not the work of man but the special work of Heaven itself?
  Where is our grove, with its cool grottos, its primaeval trees, its shady
  nooks, and all the peace and enjoyment of which it was as full as a ripe
  grape is full of sweet juice?"</p>

  <p>"It was cut down and rooted up," replied the steward. "The emperor gave
  the sanctuary over to Bishop Theophilus and he set to work at once to destroy
  it. The temple was pulled down, the sacred vessels went into the melting-pot,
  and the images were mutilated and insulted before they were thrown into the
  lime-kiln. The place they are building now is to be a Christian church. Oh!
  to think of the airy, beautiful colonnades that once stood there, and then of
  the dingy barn that is to take their place!"</p>

  <p>"Why do the gods endure it? Has Zeus lost his thunderbolts?" cried Orpheus
  clenching his hands, and paying no heed to Agne who sat pale and sternly
  silent during this conversation.</p>

  <p>"Nay, he only sleeps, to wake with awful power," said the old man. "See
  those blocks of marble and ruins under the waves. Swift work is destruction!
  And men lost their wits and looked on at the crime, flinging the delight of
  the gods into the water and the kiln. They were wise, very wise; fishes and
  flames are dumb and cannot cry to heaven. One barbarian, in one hour can
  destroy what it has taken the sublimest souls years, centuries, to create.
  They glory in destruction and ruin and they can no more build up again such a
  temple as stood there than they can restore trees that have taken six hundred
  years to grow. There&mdash;out there, Herse, in the hollow where those black
  fellows are stirring mortar&mdash;they have given them shirts too, because
  they are ashamed of the beauty of men's bodies&mdash;that is where the grotto
  was where we found your poor father."</p>

  <p>"The grotto?" repeated his wife, looking at the spot through her tears,
  and thinking of the day when, as a girl, she had hurried to the feast of
  Dionysus and sought her father in the temple. He had been famous as a gem-
  cutter. In obedience to the time-honored tradition in Alexandria, after
  intoxicating himself with new wine in honor of the god, he had rushed out
  into the street to join the procession. The next morning he had not returned;
  the afternoon passed and evening came and still he did not appear, so his
  daughter had gone in search of him. Karnis was at that time a young student
  and, as her father's lodger, had rented the best room in the house. He had
  met her going on her errand and had been very ready to help her in the
  search; before long they had found the old man in the ivy-grown grotto in the
  grove of Dionysus&mdash;motionless and cold, as if struck by lightning. The
  bystanders believed that the god had snatched him away in his intoxicated
  legion.</p>

  <p>In this hour of sorrow Karnis had proved himself her friend, and a few
  months after Herse had become his wife and gone with him to Tauromenium in
  Sicily.</p>

  <p>All this rose before her mind, and even Karnis sat gazing dumbly at the
  waves; for every spot where some decisive change has occurred in our lives
  has power to revive the past when we see it again after a long absence. Thus
  they all sat in silence till Orpheus, touching his father, pointed out the
  temple of Isis where he had met the fair Gorgo on the previous day. The old
  man turned to look at the sanctuary which, as yet, remained intact.</p>

  <p>"A barbarous structure!" he said bitterly. "The art of the Egyptians has
  long been numbered with the dead and the tiger hungers only for the
  living!"</p>

  <p>"Nay, it is not such a bad piece of work," replied the steward, "but it is
  out of their reach; for the ground on which it stands belongs to my old
  mistress, and the law protects private property.&mdash;You must at your
  leisure inspect the ship-yard here; it is perhaps the most extensive in the
  world. The timber that is piled there&mdash;cedar of Lebanon, oak from Pontus
  and heavy iron-wood from Ethiopia&mdash;is worth hundreds of talents."</p>

  <p>"And does all that belong to your master?"</p>

  <p>"No; the owner is the grandson of a freedman, formerly in his family. Now
  they are very rich and highly respected, and Master Clemens sits in the
  Senate. There he is&mdash;that man in a white robe."</p>

  <p>"A Christian, I should imagine," observed the singer.</p>

  <p>"Very true;" replied the steward. "But what is good remains good, and he
  is a worthy and excellent man notwithstanding. He keeps a tight hand over the
  ship-yard here and over the others too by the harbor of Eunostus. Only
  Clemens can never let other people have their own opinions; in that he is
  just like the rest of them. Every slave he buys must become a Christian and
  his sons are the same; even Constantine, though he is an officer in the
  imperial army and as smart and clever a soldier as lives.&mdash;As far as we
  are concerned we leave every man to his own beliefs. Porphyrius makes no
  secret of his views and all the vessels we use in the corn-trade are built by
  Christians.&mdash;But here we are."</p>

  <p>The boat stopped at a broad flight of marble steps which led from the lake
  into the garden of Porphyrius' house. Karnis as he walked through the grounds
  felt himself at greater ease, for here the old gods were at home; their
  statues gleamed among the dark clumps of evergreens, and were mirrored in the
  clear tanks, while delicious perfumes were wafted from the garlanded shrines
  and freshly anointed altars, to greet the newcomers.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch03"
     id="ch03">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The family of musicians were kindly received, but they were
  not immediately called upon to perform, for as soon as Damia heard that the
  pretty fair-haired child who had pleased her so much the day before had been
  obliged to remain at home, she had one of her granddaughter's dresses brought
  out, and requested Herse to go back to fetch her. Some slaves were to
  accompany Herse and transfer all her little property on board a Nile-boat
  belonging to Porphyrius, which was lying at anchor just off the ship-yard. In
  this large barge there were several cabins which had often accommodated
  guests, and which would now serve very well as a residence for Karnis and his
  party. Indeed, it was particularly well suited for a family of musicians, for
  they could practise there undisturbed, and Gorgo could at any time pay them a
  visit.</p>

  <p>Herse went back to the Xenodochium with a lighter heart; her son also
  returned to the city to replace a number of necessaries that had been lost on
  board ship, and Karnis, rejoicing to be out of the monk-haunted asylum had
  remained in the men's room in the house of his new patron, enjoying the good
  things which abounded there. He felt as though he was here once more at home
  after years of exile. Here dwelt the spirit of his fathers; here he found men
  who enjoyed life after his own fashion, who could share his enthusiasms and
  his hatreds. He drank noble liquor out of an elegantly carved onyx cup, all
  that he heard soothed his ears, and all that he said met with entire
  sympathy. The future prospects of his family, till now so uncertain, were
  hardly inferior to those which his vivid imagination had painted the night
  before. And even if Fortune should again desert him, the hours of present
  enjoyment should be written down to the profit side of life, and remain a
  permanent gain at any rate in memory.</p>

  <p>The venerable Damia, her son Porphyrius, and the fair Gorgo were in fact a
  trio such as are rarely met with. The master of the house, more cautious than
  the women, was inclined to think that his mother and daughter had been
  somewhat overhasty and imprudent in their advances and he had at first
  received Karnis with considerable reserve; but after a short interview he had
  convinced himself that the musician was a man of unusual culture and superior
  stamp. The old lady had, from the first, been predisposed in his favor, for
  she had read in the stars last night that the day was to bring her a
  fortunate meeting. Her wish was law, and Karnis could not help smiling when
  she addressed her son, whose hair had long been grey and who looked fully
  competent to manage his own household, as "my child," not hesitating to scold
  and reprove him. Her cathedra was a high arm-chair which she never quitted
  but to be carried to her observatory on the roof of the house, where she kept
  her astrological tablets and manuscripts. The only weakness about her was in
  her feet; but strong, and willing arms were always at her disposal to carry
  her about&mdash;to table, into her sleeping-room, and during the daytime out
  to sunny spots in the garden. She was never so happy as when Helios warmed
  her back with his rays, for her old blood needed it after the long
  night-watches that she still would keep in her observatory. Even during the
  hottest noon she would sit in the sun, with a large green umbrella to shade
  her keen eyes, and those who desired to speak with her might find shade as
  best they could. As she stood, much bent, but propped on her ivory crutches,
  eagerly following every word of a conversation, she looked as though she were
  prepared at any moment to spring into the middle of it and interrupt the
  speaker. She always said exactly what she meant without reserve or ruth; and
  throughout her long life, as the mistress of great wealth, she had always
  been allowed to have her own way. She asserted her rights even over her son,
  though he was the centre of a web whose threads reached to the furthest
  circumference of the known world. The peasants who tilled the earth by the
  Upper and Lower Nile, the shepherds who kept their flocks in the Arabian
  desert, in Syria, or on the Silphium meads of Cyrenaica, the wood-cutters of
  Lebanon and Pontus, the mountaineers of Hispania and Sardinia, the brokers,
  merchants, and skippers of every port on the Mediterranean, were bound by
  these threads to the villa on the shore of Mareotis, and felt the tie when
  the master there&mdash;docile as a boy to his mother's will&mdash;tightened
  or released his hold.</p>

  <p>His possessions, even in his youth, had been so vast that their increment
  could bring no added enjoyment to him or his family, and yet their increase
  had become his life's task. He strove for a higher sum to figure on the
  annual balance sheet, as eagerly as an athlete strives for a prize; and his
  mother not only inspected the account, but watched every important
  undertaking with keen interest. When her son and his colleagues doubted over
  some decision it was she who gave the casting vote; but though her advice in
  most cases proved sound and profitable, she herself ascribed this less to her
  own acumen and knowledge of the world than to the hints she obtained from the
  stars and from magical calculations. Her son did not follow her in these
  speculations, but he rarely disputed the conclusions that she drew from her
  astrological studies. While she was turning night into day he was glad to
  entertain a few learned friends, for all the hours of leisure that he could
  snatch from his pursuit of fortune, he devoted to philosophy, and the most
  distinguished thinkers of Alexandria were happy to be received at the
  hospitable table of so rich a patron. He was charmed to be called "Callias,"*
  and the heathen teachers at the schools of the Museum and Serapeum regarded
  him as a faithful ally. It was known that he had been baptized, but he never
  liked to hear the fact mentioned. He won all hearts by his perfect modesty,
  but even more perhaps by a certain air of suffering and melancholy which
  protected the wealthy merchant against the envy of detractors.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The noble Athenian family of Callias was famed for its
  wealth and splendor. ]</p>

  <p>In the course of her conversation with Karnis the old lady enquired
  particularly as to the antecedent history of Agne, for if there had been a
  stain on her character, or if she were by birth a slave, Gorgo could not of
  course be seen with her in public, and in that case Karnis would have to
  teach the lament of Isis to some freeborn singer. Karnis in reply could only
  shrug his shoulders, and beg the ladies and Porphyrius to judge for
  themselves when he should have related the young girl's story.</p>

  <p>Three years since, he said, he had been staying at Antioch at the time of
  a violent outbreak against the levying of certain taxes. There had been much
  bloodshed, and he and his family had got out of the city as quickly as they
  could. It was growing dusk when they turned into a wayside inn, where they
  found Agne and her little brother captives to a soldier. During the night the
  girl had crept up to the little boy's bed, and to comfort and lull him had
  begun to sing him a simple song. The singer's voice was so pure and pathetic
  that it had touched both him and his wife and they had at once purchased the
  girl and her brother for a small sum. He had simply paid what the soldier
  asked, not regarding the children in the light of slaves; nor had he had any
  description of them written out, though it was, no doubt, in his power to
  treat them as slaves and to sell them again, since the sale had taken place
  before witnesses who might still be found. He had afterwards learnt from the
  girl that her parents were Christians and had settled in Antioch only a few
  years previously; but she had no friends nor relatives there. Her father,
  being a tax-collector in the service of the Emperor, had moved about a great
  deal, but she remembered his having spoken of Augusta Trevirorum* in Belgica
  Prima, as his native place.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Now Trier or Trves, on the Moselle. ]</p>

  <p>Agne had witnessed the attack on her father's house by the angry mob who
  had killed her parents, their two slaves, and her elder brother. Her father
  must certainly have been an official of some rank, and probably, as it would
  seem, a Roman citizen, in which case&mdash;as Porphyrius agreed&mdash;both
  the young girl and her little brother could legally claim their freedom. The
  insurgents who had dragged the two children out into the street had been
  driven off by the troops, and it was from them that Karnis had rescued them.
  "And I have never regretted it," added the old musician, "for Agne is a
  sweet, gentle soul. Of her voice I need say nothing, since you yourselves
  heard it yesterday."</p>

  <p>"And were quite delighted with it!" cried Gorgo. "If flowers could sing it
  would be like that!"</p>

  <p>"Well, well," said Karnis. "She has a lovely voice&mdash;but she wants
  wings. Something&mdash;what, I know not, keeps the violet rooted to the
  soil."</p>

  <p>"Christian scruples," said the merchant, and Damia added:</p>

  <p>"Let Eros touch her&mdash;that will loosen her tongue."</p>

  <p>"Eros, always Eros!" repeated Gorgo shrugging her shoulders. "Nay, love
  means suffering&mdash;those who love drag a chain with them. To do the best
  of which he is capable man needs only to be free, true, and in health."</p>

  <p>"That is a great deal, fair mistress," replied Karnis eagerly. "With these
  three gifts the best work is done. But as to Agne&mdash;what can be further
  from freedom than a girl bound to service? her body, to be sure is healthy,
  but her spirit suffers; she can get no peace for dread of the Christian's
  terrors: Sin, Repentance, and Hell..."</p>

  <p>"Oh, we know how their life is ruined!" interrupted the old lady. "Was it
  Agne who introduced you to Mary's Asylum?"</p>

  <p>"No, noble lady."</p>

  <p>"But how then&mdash;that prudent saint generally selects her guests, and
  those that are not baptized ..."</p>

  <p>"She certainly sheltered heathens on this occasion."</p>

  <p>"I am much surprised. Tell me how it happened."</p>

  <p>"We were at Rome," began Karnis, "and my patron there persuaded Marcus,
  Mary's son, to take us on board his ship at Ostia. We dropped anchor at
  Cyrene, where the young master wanted to pick up his brother and bring him
  also to Alexandria."</p>

  <p>"Then is Demetrius here?" asked Porphyrius.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. He came on board at Cyrene. Hardly had we got fairly to sea
  again when we saw two pirate ships. Our trireme was at once turned round, but
  in our hurry to regain the harbor we stuck fast on a sand bank; the boats
  were at once put out to save the passengers and Cynegius, the consul..."</p>

  <p>"Cynegius&mdash;on his way here!" exclaimed Porphyrius, much excited.</p>

  <p>"He landed yesterday with us in the harbor of Eunostus. The secretaries
  and officers of his suite filled one boat and Marcus and his brother were
  getting into the other with their men. We, and others of the free passengers,
  should have been left behind if Dada ..."</p>

  <p>"That pretty little blonde?" asked Damia.</p>

  <p>"The very same. Marcus had taken a great fancy to her prattle and her
  songs during the voyage&mdash;no nightingale can sing more clearly&mdash;and
  when she begged and prayed him he gave way at once, and said: he would take
  her in his boat. But the brave child declared that she would jump into the
  sea before she would leave without us."</p>

  <p>"Well done!" cried the old lady, and Porphyrius added:</p>

  <p>"That speaks well for her and for you."</p>

  <p>"So after all Marcus found room for us in the boat&mdash;for all of us,
  and we got safely to land. A few days after we all came on in a troop-ship:
  Cynegius, the two brothers and the rest, all safe and sound; and, as we had
  lost everything we possessed, Marcus gave us a certificate which procured our
  admission into his mother's Xenodochium. And then the gods brought me and
  mine under the notice of your noble daughter."</p>

  <p>"Then Cynegius is here, positively here?" asked Porphyrius once more.
  Karnis assured him that he was, and the merchant, turning to his mother, went
  on:</p>

  <p>"And Olympius has not yet come home. It is always the same thing; he is as
  rash as a boy. If they should take him! The roads are swarming with monks.
  There is something astir. Bring out the chariot, Syrus, at once; and tell
  Atlas to be ready to accompany me. Cynegius here!&mdash;Ha, ha! I thank the
  gods!"</p>

  <p>The last exclamation was addressed to a man who at this instant came into
  the room, muffled up to the eyes. He threw off the hood of his cloak and the
  wrapper that went round his throat, concealing his long white beard, and as
  he did so he exclaimed with a gasp for breath:</p>

  <p>"Here I am once more!&mdash;Cynegius is here and matters look serious my
  friend."</p>

  <p>"You have been to the Museum?"</p>

  <p>"Without any obstruction. I found them all assembled. Brave lads. They are
  all for us and the gods. There are plenty of weapons. The Jews* are not
  stirring, Onias thinks he may vouch for that; and we must surely be a match
  for the monks and the imperial cohorts."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* At that time about two-fifths of the whole population.
  ]</p>

  <p>"If the gods only stand by us to-day and tomorrow," replied Porphyrius
  doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"For ever, if only the country people do their duty!" cried the other.
  "But who is this stranger?"</p>

  <p>"The chief of the singers who were here yesterday," replied Gorgo.</p>

  <p>"Karnis, the son of Hiero of Tauromenium," said the musician, bowing to
  the stranger, whose stately figure and handsome, thoughtful head struck him
  with admiration.</p>

  <p>"Karnis of Tauromenium!" exclaimed the newcomer with glad surprise. "By
  Hercules! a strange meeting. Your hand, your hand, old man. How many years is
  it since we last emptied a wine-jar together at the house of old Hippias?
  Seven lustres have turned our hair grey, but we still can stand upright.
  Well, Karnis son of Hiero&mdash;and who am I?"</p>

  <p>"Olympius&mdash;the great Olympius!" cried Karnis, eagerly grasping the
  offered hand. "May all the gods bless this happy day!"</p>

  <p>"All the gods?" repeated the philosopher. "Is that what you say? Then you
  have not crawled under the yoke of the cross?"</p>

  <p>"The world can rejoice only under the auspices of the gods!" cried Karnis
  excitedly.</p>

  <p>"And it shall rejoice still, we will save it from gloom!" added the other
  with a flash of vehemence.</p>

  <p>"The times are fateful. We must fight; and no longer over trifles; we
  cannot now break each other's heads over a quibble, or believe that the whole
  world hangs on the question whether the instant of death is the last minute
  of this life or the first of the next. No&mdash;what now remains to be
  decided is whether the old gods shall be victorious, whether we shall
  continue to live free and happy under the rule of the Immortals, or whether
  we shall bow under the dismal doctrine of the carpenter's crucified son; we
  must fight for the highest hopes and aims of humanity."</p>

  <p>"I know," interrupted Karnis, "you have already done battle valiantly for
  great Serapis. They wanted to lay hands on his sanctuary but you and your
  disciples put them to rout. The rest got off scot-free ..."</p>

  <p>"But they have taught me the value of my head," said Olympius laughing.
  "Evagrius prices it at three talents. Why, you might buy a house with the
  money and a modest man could live upon the interest. This worthy man keeps me
  concealed here. We must talk over a few things, Porphyrius; and you, Gorgo,
  do not forget the solemn festival of Isis. Now that Cynegius is here it must
  be made as splendid as possible, and he must tell the Emperor, who has sent
  him, what temper we Alexandrians are in. But where is the dark maiden I saw
  yesterday?"</p>

  <p>"In the garden," replied Gorgo.</p>

  <p>"She is to sing at the foot of the bier!" cried Olympius. "That must not
  be altered."</p>

  <p>"If I can persuade her&mdash;she is a Christian," said Karnis
  doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"She must," said the philosopher positively. "It will be a bad lookout
  indeed for the logic and rhetoric of Alexandria if an old professor and
  disputant cannot succeed in turning a young girl's resolutions upside down.
  Leave that to me. I shall find time for a chat with you by and bye, friend
  Karnis. How in the world does it happen that you, who so often have helped us
  with your father's coin, have come down to be the chief of a band of
  travelling musicians? You will have much to tell me, my good friend; but even
  such important matters must give way to those that are more pressing. One
  word with you, Porphyrius."</p>

  <p>Agne had been all this time awaiting Herse's return in the colonnade that
  ran along the garden-front of the house. She was glad to be alone, and it was
  very comfortable to rest on the soft cushions under the gilt-coffered ceiling
  of the arcade. At each end stood large shrubs covered with bunches of violet-
  blue flowers and the spreading branches cast a pleasant shade on the couch
  where she sat; the beautiful flowers, which were strange to her, were
  delightfully fragrant, and from time to time she helped herself to the
  refreshments which Gorgo herself had brought out to her. All she saw, heard,
  and felt, was soothing to her mind; never had she seen or tasted juicier
  peaches, richer bunches of grapes, fresher almonds or more tempting cakes; on
  the shrubs in the garden and on the grass-plots between the paths there was
  not a dead leaf, not a dry stem, not the tiniest weed. The buds were swelling
  on the tall trees, shrubs without end were covered with blossoms&mdash;white,
  blue, yellow, and red&mdash;while, among the smooth, shining leaves of the
  orange and lemon trees, gleamed the swelling fruit. On a round tank close at
  hand some black swans were noiselessly tracing evanescent circles and
  uttering their strange lament. The song of birds mingled with the plash of
  fountains, and even the marble statues, for all that they were dumb, seemed
  to be enjoying the sweet morning air and the stir and voice of nature.</p>

  <p>Yes, she could be happy here; as she peeled a peach and slowly swallowed
  the soft fragrant mouthfuls, she laughed to remember the hard ship's-biscuit,
  of the two previous days' fare. And it was Gorgo's privilege to revel in
  these good things day after day, year after year. It was like living in Eden,
  in the perpetual spring of man's first blissful home on earth. There could be
  no suffering here; who could cry here, who could be sorrowful, who could die?
  ... Here a new train of thought forced itself upon her. She was still so
  young, and yet she was as familiar with the idea of death as she was with
  life; for whenever she had happened to tell any minister of her creed that
  she was an orphan and a slave, and deeply sad and sorrowful, the joys of
  eternity in Paradise had always been described to her for her consolation,
  and it was in hopes of Heaven that her visionary nature found such a modicum
  of comfort as might suffice to keep the young artist-soul from despair. And
  now it struck her that it must be hard, very hard to die, in the midst of all
  this splendor. Living here must be a foretaste of the joys of
  Paradise&mdash;and in the next world, among the angels of Heaven, in the
  presence of the Saviour&mdash;would it not be a thousand times more beautiful
  even than this? She shuddered, for, sojourning here, she was no longer to be
  counted as one of the poor and humble sufferers to whom Christ had promised
  the Kingdom of Heaven&mdash;here she was one of the rich, who had nothing to
  hope for after death.</p>

  <p>She pushed the peaches away with a feeling of oppression, and closed her
  eyes that she might no longer see all these perishable splendors and sinful
  works of the heathen, which pandered only to the senses. She longed to remain
  miserable and poor on earth, that she might rejoin her parents and dwell with
  them eternally.</p>

  <p>To her it was not a belief but a certainty that her father and mother were
  dwelling in Heaven, and she had often felt moved to pray that she might die
  and be reunited to them; but she must not die yet, for her little brother
  still needed her care. The kind souls whom she served let him lack for
  nothing, it is true, that could conduce to his bodily welfare; still, she
  could not appear before her parents without the little one in her hand, and
  he would be lost eternally if his soul fell into the power of the enemies of
  her faith. Her heart ached when she reflected that Karnis, who was certainly
  not one of the reprobate and whom she affectionately revered as a master in
  the art she loved&mdash;that Herse, and the light-hearted Dada, and Orpheus
  even, must all be doomed to perish eternally; and to save Orpheus she would
  willingly have forfeited half the joys of Paradise. She saw that he was no
  less an idolater than his parents; and yet, day by day, she prayed that his
  soul might be saved, and she never ceased to hope for a miracle&mdash;that he
  too might see a vision, like Paul, and confess the Saviour. She was so happy
  when she was with him, and never happier than when it was her fortune to sing
  with him, or to his admirable accompaniment on the lute. When she could
  succeed in forgetting herself completely, and in giving utterance by her
  lovely voice to all that was highest and best in her soul, he, whose ear was
  no less sensitive and appreciative than his father's, would frankly express
  his approval, and in these moments life was indeed fair and precious.</p>

  <p>Music was the bond between her and Orpheus, and when her soul was stirred
  she could feel and express herself in music. Song was the language of her
  heart, and she had learnt by experience that it was a language which even the
  heathen could both use and understand. The Eternal Father himself must find
  joy in such a voice as Gorgo's. She was a heathen, and yet she had thrown
  into her song all that Agne herself could feel when she lifted up her heart
  in passionate prayer. The Christian&mdash;so she had often been
  taught&mdash;must have no part with the idolaters; but it was God himself who
  had cast her on the hands of Karnis, and the Church commanded that servants
  should obey their masters. Singing seemed to her to be a language in itself,
  bestowed by God on all living creatures, even on the birds, wherein to speak
  to Him; so she allowed herself to look forward with pleasure to an
  opportunity of mingling her own voice with that of the heathen lady.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch04"
     id="ch04">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Not long after Porphyrius and the philosopher had retired to
  a private room Herse returned with Dada. Gorgo's blue spangled dress, which
  Damia had sent her, suited the girl to perfection; but she was quite out of
  breath, and her hair was in disorder. Herse, too, looked agitated, her face
  was red and she dragged little Papias, whose hand she held, rather roughly at
  her heels.</p>

  <p>Dada was evidently abashed; less by reason of the splendor that surrounded
  her than because her foster-mother had strictly enjoined her to be very quiet
  and mannerly in the presence of their patrons. She felt shy and strange as
  she made her low courtesy to the old lady; but Damia seemed to be pleased
  with the timid grace of her demeanor, for she offered her her hand&mdash;an
  honor she usually conferred only on her intimates, bid her stoop, and gave
  her a kiss, saying kindly: "You are a good brave girl. Fidelity to your
  friends is pleasing in the sight of the gods, and finds its reward even among
  men."</p>

  <p>Dada, obeying a happy impulse, threw herself on her knees before the old
  woman, kissed her hands, and then, sitting on her heels, nestled at her
  feet.</p>

  <p>Gorgo, however, noticing Herse's agitation, asked what had happened to
  them. Some monks, Herse explained, had followed them on the road hither, had
  snatched Dada's lyre from the slave who was carrying it and pulled the wreath
  out of her hair. Damia was furious as she heard it, and trembled with rage as
  she railed at the wild hordes who disgraced and desecrated Alexandria, the
  sacred home of the Muses; then she began to speak once more of the young
  captain, Mary's son, to whom the troupe of singers owed their lives.</p>

  <p>"Marcus," said she, "is said to be a paragon of chastity. He races in the
  hippodrome with all the gallants of the town and yet&mdash;if it is true it
  is a miracle&mdash;he shuns women as though he were a priest already. His
  mother is very anxious that he should become one; but he, by the grace of
  Aphrodite, is the son of my handsome Appelles, who, if he had gazed into
  those blue eyes all the way from Rome to Alexandria, would have surrendered
  at mercy; but then he would also have conquered them&mdash;as surely as I
  hope to live till autumn. You need not blush so, child. After all, Marcus is
  a man like other men. Keep your eyes open, Dame Herse!"</p>

  <p>"Never fear!" cried Herse. "And I have need to keep them open I am sorry
  to say. The young captain, who on board ship was so bashful and retiring, as
  soon as he was on land altered his time. While we were away this morning he
  crept into his own mother's inn like a ferret, opened the door of our room
  with the keys of which he has the command&mdash;it is shameful!&mdash;and
  proposed to the girl to fly, to leave us&mdash;she is the daughter of a dear
  sister of mine&mdash;and go with him; who but he knows where!"</p>

  <p>Damia struck the floor with her crutch and, interrupting the indignant
  matron with a spiteful laugh, exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha! The saintly Mary's most saintly son! Such wonders do not happen
  every day! Here, Dada&mdash;here; take this ring, it has been worn by a woman
  who once was young and who has had many lovers. Close&mdash;come close, my
  sweet child."</p>

  <p>Dada looked up at the old lady with puzzled eyes; Damia bent her head
  close to the girl's, and whispered, softly but vehemently in her ear:</p>

  <p>"Only turn that milksop's head, make him so madly and desperately in love
  with you that he does not know which way to turn for delicious torment. You
  can do it I know, and if you do&mdash;well, I make no promises; but on the
  day when all Alexandria is talking of that woman's son as wandering out,
  night after night, to watch under the window of the fair Dada, the heathen
  singer&mdash;when he drives you out in the face of day and in his own
  chariot, down the Canopic Way and past his mother's door&mdash;then child,
  ask, claim whatever you will, and old Damia will not refuse it."</p>

  <p>Then raising her head she added to the others:</p>

  <p>"In the afternoon, my friends, you can take possession of your new
  quarters. Go with them, Dada. By-and-bye we will find you a pretty room in
  the tower. Come and see me very often, sweet one, and tell me all your
  prettiest tales. When I am not too busy I shall always be glad to see you,
  for you and I have a secret you know."</p>

  <p>The girl stood up, looking uneasily at the old woman; Damia nodded
  knowingly, as much as to say that they quite understood each other and again
  offered her hand to Dada; but Dada could not kiss it; she turned and followed
  the others more gravely than usual.</p>

  <p>Gorgo guessed what the old lady would be at with Dada; as soon as the
  party of singers had taken leave she went up to her grandmother and said
  reproachfully:</p>

  <p>"That little fair thing will find no difficulty in making a fool of
  Marcus; for my part I hardly know him, but why should he pay for his mother's
  sins against you? How can he help..."</p>

  <p>"He cannot help it," interrupted Damia with decisive abruptness. "He can
  do nothing to save his mother, any more than you can help being a child of
  twenty and bound to hold your tongue till your opinion is asked."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The family of musicians had all met on board the barge which was lying at
  anchor in the lake, off the ship-yard. Orpheus had just been an eye-witness
  of the disturbance which prevailed throughout the city, and the wild howls
  and cries that were audible in the distance confirmed his report; but the
  waters of the lake were an unruffled mirror of blue, the slaves in the
  ship-yard were at work as usual, and the cooing turtle-doves flew from palm
  to palm.</p>

  <p>No signs of troubled times were to be seen in the floating home of the
  wanderers. The steward had provided for everything. There were rooms and beds
  to spare in the vessel; the large deck-cabin was a comfortable sitting-room,
  and from the little galley at the prow came a savory smell of cooking and a
  cheerful clang of pots and pans.</p>

  <p>"This is living!" exclaimed Karnis, stretching himself comfortably on a
  divan. "This abode seems made on purpose for our noble selves! Sit down,
  mother, make yourself at home. Here we are people of consequence, and if it
  were only to make things pleasant for the slaves we must behave as though we
  had never known people who take their meals squatted round an earthen bowl,
  and clawing out the broken meat. Enjoy the gifts of the present&mdash;who
  knows how long this golden hour may last! Ah, wife, it reminds us of former
  times! It would be very pleasant to be like this, side by side, and help
  ourselves from a table all our own to dainty dishes which we had not assisted
  in cooking. For you, old woman, have done everything with your own hands for
  so long, that you deserve to have some one to wait on you for once."</p>

  <p>A little table was placed by each divan and covered with appetizing food;
  the steward mixed some fine wine of the country with fresh, clear water,
  Orpheus offered the libation, and Karnis spiced the meal with jests and tales
  of his youth, of which he had been reminded by his meeting with his old
  friend and comrade Olympius.</p>

  <p>Dada interrupted him frequently, laughing more loudly and recklessly than
  usual; she was in a fever of excitement and Herse did not fail to remark it.
  The good woman was somewhat uneasy. The very fact that her husband always
  gave himself up heart and soul to the influences of the hour&mdash;though she
  was glad that he should enjoy this good fortune to the utmost&mdash;made her
  look beyond the present into the future. She had seen with her own eyes the
  tumult that was rife in Alexandria, and felt that they had arrived at an
  inauspicious moment. If it should come to a struggle between the Christians
  and the Heathen, Karnis, finding that his old friend Olympius was the head of
  his party, would infallibly seize the sword, and if, then, the victory
  remained with the Christians no mercy would be shown to those who had fought
  for the old gods. Gorgo's wish that Agne should sing in the temple of Isis
  was another source of anxiety; for if it came to that they might, only too
  probably, be accused of perverting a Christian to heathen worship, and be
  condemned to a severe penalty. All this had worn a very different aspect
  yesterday when she had thought of Alexandria as the gay home of her youth;
  but now she saw what a change had taken place in these thirty years. The
  Church had risen on the ruins of the Temple, and monks had forced the
  sacrificing priests into the background.</p>

  <p>Karnis and his troupe were musicians of no ordinary stamp; still the law
  concerning singing-girls might place him in peril, especially now
  that&mdash;to make matters worse&mdash;a young Christian was paying court to
  his pretty niece. What catastrophes might not be called down on his hapless
  head if so influential a woman as Marcus' mother Mary should come to know of
  her son's backsliding! Herse had long perceived how attractive that little
  simpleton was to all men&mdash;old and young&mdash;and when one of the
  lovers, of whom she had no lack, happened to take her fancy she was apt to
  forget herself and play a too audacious game; but as soon as she found she
  had gone too far and somewhat committed herself she would draw back and meet
  him, if she could not avoid him, with repellent and even unmannerly coldness.
  Again and again had Herse scolded and warned her, but Dada always answered
  her reproofs by saying that she could not make herself different from what
  she was, and Herse had never been able to remain stern and severe in the face
  of the foolish excuses that Dada put forward so convincingly.</p>

  <p>To-day the good woman could not quite make up her mind whether it would be
  wiser to warn Dada against Marcus and desire her to repel any advances he
  might attempt to make, or to let bygones be bygones. She knew full well how a
  trifling incident gains importance when undue emphasis is laid on it; she
  therefore had merely asked the girl what secret she could have with old Damia
  and had accepted some evasive subterfuge in reply, while, at the same time,
  she guessed the truth and was quite determined not to remit her watchfulness.
  For a time, at any rate, she thought she would let matters go their own way,
  and never mention the young fellow's name; but her husband spoilt this plan,
  for with the eager jollity of a man very much at his ease after a good dinner
  he called upon Dada to tell their the whole history of the young Christian's
  invasion in the morning. Dada at first was reticent, but the old man's
  communicative humor proved infectious and she presently told her story:</p>

  <p>"I was sitting alone with the poor little boy, like&mdash;well I do not
  know what like&mdash;you must find a comparison for yourselves. I was
  comforting myself with the reflection that the key was on the inside and the
  door locked, for I was getting frightened as the monks began to sing in the
  yard below, one part going off to the left, as it were, and the other part to
  the right. Did you ever see two drunken men walking arm in arm, and lurching
  first to one side and then to the other? You may laugh, but by the nine Muses
  it was just like that. Then Papias grew tired and cross and kept asking where
  Agne was, till at last he began to cry. When I asked him what he was crying
  for, he said he had forgotten, I really am patient&mdash;you must all allow
  that&mdash;I did not do anything to him, but, just to give him something to
  play with, I took out the key, for there was nothing else at hand that he
  could not break, and gave it to him and told him to play a tune on it. This
  delighted him, and he really did it quite prettily. Then I looked over my
  burnt dress and was horrified to see how large the holes were, and it struck
  me that I might turn it, because when you turn a thing the spots, you know,
  do not show."</p>

  <p>"You have invented that this very minute," cried Orpheus laughing. "We
  know you. If you can only turn the laugh against yourself..."</p>

  <p>"No, really," cried Dada, "the idea flew through my head like a bird
  through a room; but I remembered at once that a hole burnt through shows on
  both sides, so I threw the dress aside as past mending and sat down on the
  low stool to peep through the wicket by the door out at the yard; the singing
  had stopped and the silence frightened me almost as much. Papias had stopped
  his piping too, and was sitting in the corner where Orpheus sat to write his
  letter to Tauromenium."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Orpheus, "the inkstand was there, that the steward of the
  inn had lent us the day before."</p>

  <p>"Just so; and when mother came in, there he was, dipping his finger in the
  ink, and painting his white dress&mdash;you can study the pattern at your
  leisure.&mdash;But no not interrupt me.&mdash;Well, I was looking into the
  court-yard; it was quite empty; all the monks were gone. Suddenly a tall
  young man in a white dress with a beautiful sky-blue border appeared through
  the great gate. The gate-keeper crawled after him very humbly as far as his
  rope would allow and even the steward spoke to him with both hands pressed to
  his breast as if he had a faithful heart on the right side as well as the one
  on the left. This young man&mdash;it was our kind friend Marcus, of
  course&mdash;crossed the court, taking a zigzag at first, as a snipe flies,
  and then came towards our door. The steward and the gate-keeper had both
  vanished.&mdash;Do you remember the young Goths whom their father took to
  bathe in the Tiber last winter, when it was so cold? And how they first stood
  on the brink and dipped their toes in, and then ran away and when they came
  back again just wetted their heads and chests? But they had to jump in at
  last when their father shouted some barbaric words to them&mdash;I can see
  them now. Well, Marcus was exactly like those boys; but at last he suddenly
  walked straight up to our door and knocked."</p>

  <p>"He remembered your pretty face no doubt," laughed Karnis.</p>

  <p>"May be. However, I did not stir. I kept as still as a mouse, sitting on
  my stool and watching him through the key-hole, till presently he called out:
  'Is no one there?' Then I forgot and answered: 'They are all out!' Of course
  I had betrayed myself&mdash;but it is impossible to think of everything at
  once. Oh! yes&mdash;you may laugh. And he smiled too&mdash;he is a very
  handsome fellow&mdash;and desired me most pressingly to open the door as he
  had something of the greatest importance to say to me. I said he could talk
  very well through the gap at the top; that Pyramus and Thisbe had even kissed
  through a chink in a wall. But he would not see the joke; he got graver and
  more earnest, and insisted, saying that our fate, his and mine, hung on that
  hour, and that not a soul must overhear what he had to say. The top of the
  door was too high to whisper through, so there was nothing for it but to ask
  Papias for the key; however, he did not know where he had put it. I
  afterwards thought of asking him what he had done with his flute and he
  fetched it then at once.&mdash;In short, the key was nowhere to be found. I
  told Marcus this and he wrung his hands with vexation; but in a few minutes
  the inn-steward, who must have been hiding to listen behind a pillar,
  suddenly appeared as if he had dropped from the skies, took a key out of his
  girdle, threw the door wide open, and vanished as if the earth had swallowed
  him.</p>

  <p>"There we stood, Marcus and I, face to face. He was quite agitated; I
  really believe the poor fellow was trembling, and I did not feel very
  confident; however, I asked him what it was that he wanted. Then he recovered
  himself a little: 'I wished,'&mdash;he began; so I went on: 'Thou
  wishedst,'&mdash;and it might have gone on to the end: 'he wished, we
  wished'&mdash;-and so forth, like the children at school at Rome, when we
  were learning Greek; but, Papias came to the rescue, for he ran up to Marcus
  and asked him to toss him up high, as he used to do on board ship. Marcus did
  as he was asked, and then he suddenly broke out into such a torrent of words
  that I was quite terrified. First he said so many fine things that I quite
  expected a declaration of love, and was trying to make up my mind whether I
  would laugh him out of it or throw myself into his arms&mdash;for he really
  is a dear, good, handsome fellow&mdash;and if you would like to know the
  truth I should have been very willing to oblige him&mdash;to a certain
  extent. But he asked me nothing, and from talking of me&mdash;listen to this
  Father Karnis&mdash;and saying that the great Father in Heaven had granted me
  every good gift, he went on to speak of you as a wicked, perverse and
  reprobate old heathen."</p>

  <p>"I will teach him!" exclaimed Karnis shaking his fist.</p>

  <p>"Nay, but listen," Dada went on. "He praised you and mother for a great
  many things; but do you know what he says is wrong? He says you will imperil
  my psyche&mdash;my soul, my immortal soul. As if I had ever heard of any
  Psyche but the Psyche whom Eros loved!"</p>

  <p>"That is quite another thing," said Karnis very seriously. "In many songs,
  you know, I have tried to make you uplift your soul to a higher flight. You
  have learnt to sing, and there is no better school for a woman's soul than
  music and singing. If that conceited simpleton&mdash;why, he is young enough
  to be my grandson&mdash;if he talks any such nonsense to you again you may
  tell him from me ..."</p>

  <p>"You will tell him nothing," cried Herse, "for we can have nothing
  whatever to do with the Christian. You are my own sister's child and I desire
  and order you&mdash;do you hear&mdash;to keep out of his way, if he ever
  tries to come near you again ..."</p>

  <p>"Who is likely to find us here?" said Dada. "Besides, he has no such ideas
  and motives as you suppose. It is what he calls my soul that he cares for and
  not myself; and he wanted to take me away, not to his own house, but to some
  man who would be the physician of my soul, he said. I am generally ready
  enough to laugh, but what he said was so impressive and solemn, and so
  wonderfully earnest and startling that I could not jest over it. At last I
  was more angry at his daring to speak to me in such a way than any of you
  ever thought I could be, and that drove him half mad. You came in, mother,
  just as the gentleman had fallen on his knees to implore me to leave
  you."</p>

  <p>"And I gave him my mind on the subject," retorted Herse with grim
  satisfaction. "I let him know what I thought of him. He may talk about the
  soul&mdash;what he is after is the girl. I know these Christians and I know
  what the upshot will be. He will take advantage of the edict to gain his
  ends, and then you will be separated from us and shut up in a reformatory or
  a refuge or a cloister or whatever they call their dismal prisons, and will
  learn more about your soul than you will care to know. It will be all over
  then with singing, and laughter, and amusement. Now you know the truth, and
  if you are wise you will keep out of his way till we leave Alexandria; and
  that will be as soon as possible, if you listen to reason, Karnis."</p>

  <p>She spoke with such earnest conviction that Dada remained silent with
  downcast eyes, and Karnis sat up to think the matter over.</p>

  <p>However, there was no time now for further reflection; the steward came in
  and desired that he, with his son and Agne should go at once to Gorgo to
  practise the lament of Isis.</p>

  <p>This command did not include Herse and Dada, who remained on the barge.
  Herse having plenty to occupy her in the lower rooms, Dada went on deck and
  watched the others on their way to the house; then she sat looking at the
  shipwrights at their work and tossed fruit and sweetmeats, the remains of
  their dessert, for the children to catch who were playing on the shore.
  Meanwhile she thought over Marcus' startling speech, Damia's injunctions and
  Herse's warnings.</p>

  <p>At first it seemed to her that Herse might be right, but by degrees she
  fell back into her old conviction that the young Christian could mean no harm
  by her; and she felt as sure that he would find her out wherever she might
  hide herself, as that it was her pretty and much-admired little person that
  he sought to win, and not her soul&mdash;for what could such an airy nothing
  as a soul profit a lover? How rapturously he had described her charms, how
  candidly he had owned that her image was always before him even in his
  dreams, that he could not and would not give her up&mdash;nay, that he was
  ready to lay down his life to save her soul. Only a man in love could speak
  like this and a man so desperately in love can achieve whatever he will. On
  her way from the Xenodochium to the house of Porphyrius she had passed him in
  his chariot, and had admired the splendid horses which he turned and guided
  with perfect skill and grace. He was scarcely three years older than herself;
  he was eighteen&mdash;but in spite of his youth and simplicity he was not
  unmanly; and there was something in him&mdash;something that compelled her to
  be constantly thinking of him and asking herself what that something was. Old
  Damia's instructions troubled her; they took much of the charm from her dream
  of being loved by Marcus, clasped in his arms, and driven through the city in
  his chariot.</p>

  <p>It was impossible&mdash;yes, quite impossible, she was sure&mdash;that
  they should have parted forever; as she sat, thinking still of him and
  glancing from time to time at the toiling carpenters, a boat pulled up at the
  landing close to the barge out of which jumped an officer of the imperial
  guard. Such a handsome man! with such a noble, powerful, sunburnt face, a
  lightly waving black beard, and hair that fell from under his gold helmet!
  The short-sword at his side showed him to be a tribune or prefect of cavalry,
  and what gallant deeds must not this brilliant and glittering young warrior
  have performed to have risen to such high rank while still so young! He stood
  on the shore, looking all round, his eyes met hers and she felt herself
  color; he seemed surprised to see her there and greeted her respectfully with
  a military salute; then he went on towards the unfinished hulk of a large
  ship whose bare curved ribs one or two foremen were busily measuring with
  tape and rule.</p>

  <p>An elderly man of dignified aspect was standing close by, who, as Dada had
  already discovered, was the head of the ship-yard, and the warrior hastened
  towards him. She heard him say: "Father," and in the next instant she saw the
  old man open his arms and the officer rush to embrace him.</p>

  <p>Dada never took her eyes off the couple who walked on, arm in arm and
  talking eagerly, till they disappeared into a large house on the further side
  of the dockyard.</p>

  <p>"What a handsome man!" Dada repeated to herself, but while she waited to
  see him return she gazed across the lake by which Marcus might find his way
  to her. And as she lingered, idly dreaming, she involuntarily compared the
  two men. There were fine soldiers in plenty in Rome, and the ship-builder's
  son was in no particular superior to a hundred others; but such a man as
  Marcus she had never before seen&mdash;there could hardly be such another in
  the world. The young guard was one fine tree among a grove of fine trees; but
  Marcus had something peculiar to himself, that distinguished him from the
  crowd, and which made him exceptionally attractive and lovable. His image at
  length so completely filled her mind that she forgot the handsome officer,
  and the shipmaster and every one else.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch05"
     id="ch05">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Karnis and his two companions were a long time away. Dada
  had almost forgotten her wish to see the young soldier once more, and after
  playing with little Papias for some time, as she might have played with a
  dog, she began to feel dull and to think the quiet of the boat intolerable.
  The sun was sinking when the absentees returned, but she at once reminded
  Karnis that he had promised to take her for a walk and show her Alexandria.
  Herse, however, forbid her going on such an expedition till the following
  day. Dada, who was more irritable and fractious than usual, burst into tears,
  flung the distaff that her foster-mother put into her hand over the side of
  the ship, and declared between her sobs that she was not a slave, that she
  would run away and find happiness wherever it offered. In short she was so
  insubordinate that Herse lost patience and scolded her severely. The girl
  sprang up, flung on a handkerchief and in a moment would have crossed the
  plank to the shore; Karnis, however, held her back.</p>

  <p>"Why, child," he said, "do you not see how tired I am?" The appeal had its
  effect; Dada recovered her reason and tried to look up brightly, but her eyes
  were still tearful and heavy and she could only creep away into a corner and
  cry in silence. The old man's heart was very soft towards the girl; he would
  have been glad only to speak a few kind words to her and smoothe down her
  hair; however, he made an effort, and whispering a few words to his wife said
  he was ready, if Dada wished it, to take her as far as the Canopic way and
  the Bruchium.</p>

  <p>Dada laughed with delight, wiped away her tears, flung her arms round the
  musician's neck and kissed his brown cheeks, exclaiming:</p>

  <p>"You are the best of them all! Make haste, and Agne shall come too; she
  must see something of the city."</p>

  <p>But Agne preferred to remain on board, so Karnis and Dada set out
  together. Orpheus followed them closely for, though the troops had succeeded
  in quelling the uproar, the city was still in a state of ferment. Closely
  veiled, and without any kind of adornment&mdash;on this Herse had positively
  insisted&mdash;the girl, clinging to the old man's arm, made her way through
  the streets, asking questions about everything she saw; and her spirits rose,
  and she was so full of droll suggestions that Karnis soon forgot his fatigue
  and gave himself up to the enjoyment of showing her the old scenes that he
  knew and the new beauties and improvements.</p>

  <p>In the Canopic way Dada was fairly beside herself with delight. Houses
  like palaces stood arrayed on each side. Close to the buildings ran a covered
  arcade, and down the centre of the roadway there was a broad footpath shaded
  by sycamores. This fine avenue swarmed with pedestrians, while on each side
  chariots, drawn by magnificent horses, hurried past, and riders galloped up
  and down; at every step there was something new and interesting to be
  seen.</p>

  <p>Rome, even, could not boast of a handsomer street, and Dada expressed her
  delight with frank eagerness; but Karnis did not echo her praises; he was
  indignant at finding that the Christians had removed a fine statue of the
  venerable Nile-god surrounded by the playful forms of his infant children,
  which had formerly graced the fountain in the middle of the avenue, and had
  also overthrown or mutilated the statues of Hermes that had stood by the
  roadside. Orpheus sympathized in his wrath which reached its climax when, on
  looking for two statues, of Demeter and of Pallas Athene, of which Karnis had
  spoken to his son as decorating the gateway of one of the finest houses in
  the city, they beheld instead, mounted on the plinths, two coarsely-wrought
  images of the Lamb with its Cross.</p>

  <p>"Like two rats that have been caught under a stone!" cried the old man.
  "And what is most shameful is that I would wager that they have destroyed the
  statues which were the pride of the town and thrown them on a rubbish heap.
  In my day this house belonged to a rich man named Philippus. But
  stop&mdash;was not he the father of our hospitable protector ..."</p>

  <p>"The steward spoke of Porphyrius as the son of Philippus," Orpheus
  said.</p>

  <p>"And Philippus was a corn merchant, too," added Karnis. "Demeter was
  figurative of a blessing on the harvest, for it was from that the house
  derived its wealth, and Pallas Athene was patroness of the learning that was
  encouraged by its owners. When I was a student here every wealthy man
  belonged to some school of philosophy. The money-bag did not count for
  everything. Heathen or Jew, whether engaged in business or enjoying the
  revenues of an inherited fortune, a man was expected to be able to talk of
  something besides the price of merchandise and the coming and sailing of
  vessels."</p>

  <p>During this conversation Dada had withdrawn her hand from the old man's
  arm to raise her veil, for two men had gone up to the gate between the images
  that had roused Karnis to wrath, and one of them, who at this instant knocked
  at the door, was Mary's son.</p>

  <p>"Father, see, there he is!" cried Dada, as the door was opened, speaking
  louder than was at all necessary to enable her companion to hear her; the
  musician at once recognized Marcus, and turning to his son he said:</p>

  <p>"Now we may be quite sure! Porphyrius and this young Christian's father
  were brothers. Philippus must have left his house to his eldest son who is
  the one that is dead, and it now belongs no doubt to Mary, his widow. I must
  admit, child, that you choose your adorers from respectable families!"</p>

  <p>"I should think so," said the girl laughing. "And that is why he is so
  proud. My fine gentleman has not even a glance to cast at us. Bang! the door
  is shut. Come along, uncle!"</p>

  <p>The young man in question entered the hall of his father's house with his
  companion and paused there to say in a tone of pressing entreaty: "Only come
  and speak with my mother; you really must not leave like this."</p>

  <p>"How else?" said the other roughly. "You stick to your way, I will go
  mine. You can find a better steward for the estate&mdash;I go to-morrow. May
  the earth open and swallow me up if I stay one hour longer than is absolutely
  necessary in this demented place. And after all Mary is your mother and not
  mine."</p>

  <p>"But she was your father's wife," retorted Marcus.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, or you would not be my brother. But she&mdash;I have amply
  repaid any kindness she ever did me by ten years of service. We do not
  understand each other and we never shall."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, you will indeed. I have been in church and prayed&mdash;nay, do
  not laugh&mdash;I prayed to the Lord that he would make it all work right and
  He&mdash;well, you have been baptized and made one of His flock."</p>

  <p>"To my misfortune! You drive me frantic with your meek and mild ways,"
  cried the other passionately. "My own feet are strong enough for me to stand
  on and my hand, though it is horny, can carry out what my brain thinks
  right."</p>

  <p>"No, no, Demetrius, no. You see, you believe in the old gods..."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said the other with increasing irritation. "You are merely
  talking to the winds, and my time is precious. I must pack up my small
  possessions, and for your sake I will say a few words of farewell when I take
  the account-books to your mother. I have land enough belonging to myself
  alone, at Arsinoe; I know my own business and am tired of letting a woman
  meddle and mar it. Good-bye for the present, youngster. Tell your mother I am
  coming; I shall be with her in just an hour."</p>

  <p>"Demetrius!" cried the lad trying once more to detain his brother; but
  Demetrius freed himself with a powerful wrench and hurried across the court-
  yard&mdash;gay with flowers and with a fountain in the middle&mdash;into
  which the apartments of the family opened, his own among the number.</p>

  <p>Marcus looked after him sadly; they differed too widely in thought and
  feeling ever to understand each other completely, and when they stood side by
  side no one would have imagined that they were the sons of one father, for
  even in appearance they were strongly dissimilar. Marcus was slight and
  delicate, Demetrius, on the contrary, broad-shouldered and large-boned.</p>

  <p>After this parting from his half-brother Marcus betook himself to the
  women's rooms where Mary, after superintending the spinning and other work of
  the slave-girls, in the rooms at the back, was wont to sit during the
  evening. He found his mother in eager conversation with a Christian priest of
  advanced age, an imposing personage of gentle and dignified aspect. The
  widow, though past forty, might still pass for a handsome woman: it was from
  her that her son had inherited his tall, thin figure with narrow shoulders
  and a slight stoop, his finely-cut features, white skin and soft, flowing,
  raven-black hair. Their resemblance was rendered all the more striking by the
  fact that each wore a simple, narrow circlet of gold-round the head; nay it
  would have seemed some unusual trick of Nature's but that their eyes were
  quite unlike. Hers were black, and their gaze was shrewd and sharp and
  sometimes sternly hard; while the dreamy lustre of her son's, which were
  blue, lent his face an almost feminine softness.</p>

  <p>She must have been discussing some grave questions with the old man, for,
  as the young man entered the room, she colored slightly and her long, taper
  fingers impatiently tapped the back of the couch on which she was
  lounging.</p>

  <p>Marcus kissed first the priest's hand and then his mother's, and, after
  enquiring with filial anxiety after her health, informed her that Demetrius
  would presently be coming to take leave of her.</p>

  <p>"How condescending?" she said coldly. "You know reverend Father what it is
  that I require of him and that he refuses. His peasants&mdash;always his
  peasants! Now can you tell me why they, who must feel the influence and power
  of their masters so much more directly than the lower class in towns, they,
  whose weal or woe so obviously depends on the will of the Most High, are so
  obstinately set against the Gospel of Salvation?"</p>

  <p>"They cling to what they are used to," replied the old man. "The seed they
  sow bore fruit under the old gods; and as they cannot see nor handle our
  Heavenly Father as they can their idols, and at the same time have nothing
  better to hope for than a tenth or a twentieth of the grain..."</p>

  <p>"Yes, mine and thine&mdash;the miserable profit of this world!" sighed the
  widow. "Oh! Demetrius can defend the idolatry of his favorites warmly enough,
  never fear. If you can spare the time, good Father, stay and help me to
  convince him."</p>

  <p>"I have already stayed too long," replied the priest, "for the Bishop has
  commanded my presence. I should like to speak to you, my dear Marcus;
  to-morrow morning, early, will you come to me? The Lord be with you,
  beloved!"</p>

  <p>He rose, and as he gave Mary his hand she detained him a moment signing to
  her son to leave them, and said in a low tone:</p>

  <p>"Marcus must not suspect that I know of the error into which he has been
  led; speak roundly to his conscience, and as to the girl, I will take her in
  hand. Will it not be possible for Theophilus to grant me an interview?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly, at present," replied the priest. "As you know, Cynegius is here
  and the fate of the Bishop and of our cause hangs on the next few days. Give
  up your ambitious desires I beseech you, daughter, for even if Theophilus
  were to admit you I firmly believe, nay&mdash;do not be angry&mdash;I can but
  hope that he would never give way on this point."</p>

  <p>"No?" said the widow looking down in some embarrassment; but when her
  visitor was gone she lifted her head with a flash of wilful defiance.</p>

  <p>She then made Marcus, who had on the previous day given her a full account
  of his voyage from Rome, tell her all that had passed between himself and
  Demetrius; she asked him how he liked his horse, whether he hoped to win the
  approaching races, and generally what he had been doing and was going to do.
  But it did not escape her notice that Marcus was more reticent than usual and
  that he tried to bring the conversation round to his voyage and to the guests
  in the Xenodochium; however, she always stopped him, for she knew what he was
  aiming at and would not listen to anything on that subject.</p>

  <p>It was not till long after the slaves had lighted the three-branched
  silver lamps that Demetrius appeared. His stepmother received him kindly and
  began to talk on indifferent subjects; but he replied with ill-disguised
  impatience, for he had not come to chatter and gossip. She fully understood
  this; but it pleased her to check and provoke him and she did it in a way
  which vividly reminded him of his early days, of the desolation and
  unhappiness that had blighted his young life when this woman had taken the
  place of his own tender gentle mother, and come between him and his father.
  Day after day, in that bygone time, she had received him just as she had this
  evening: with words that sounded kindly, but with a cold, unloving heart. He
  knew that she had always seen his boyish errors and petty faults in the worst
  light, attributing them to bad propensities and innate wickedness, that she
  had injured him in his father's eyes by painting a distorted image of his
  disposition and doings&mdash;and all these sins he could not forgive her. At
  the time of his father's assassination Demetrius was already grown to man's
  estate, and as the eldest son it would have been his right and duty to take
  part with his uncle Porphyrius in the management of the business; but he
  could not endure the idea of living in the same place with his stepmother,
  so, having a pronounced taste for a country life, he left the widow in
  possession of the house in the Canopic street, persuaded his uncle to pay
  over his father's share in the business in hard cash and then had quitted
  Alexandria to take entire charge of the family estates in Cyrenaica. In the
  course of a few years he had become an admirable farmer; the landowners
  throughout the province were glad to take his advice or follow his example,
  and the accounts which he now laid on the table by the side of Mary's
  couch&mdash;three goodly rolls&mdash;proved by the irrefragable evidence of
  figures that he had actually doubled their revenues from the estates of which
  he had been the manager. He had earned his right to claim his independence,
  to persist in his own determinations and to go his own way; he was animated
  by the pride of an independent nature that recklessly breaks away from a
  detested tie when it has means at command either to rest without anxiety or
  to devote its energies to new enterprise.</p>

  <p>When Demetrius had allowed his stepmother time enough for subjects in
  which he took no interest, he laid his hand on the account-books and abruptly
  observed that it was now time to talk seriously. He had already explained to
  Marcus that he could no longer undertake to meet her requirements; and as,
  with him, to decide was to act, he wished at once to come to a decision as to
  whether he should continue to manage the family estates in the way he thought
  proper, or should retire and devote himself to the care of his own land. If
  Mary accepted the latter alternative he would at once cancel their deed of
  agreement, but even then he was very willing to stay on for a time in
  Cyrenaica, and put the new steward, when she had appointed one, in the way of
  performing his onerous duties. After that he would have nothing more to do
  with the family estates. This was his last word; and whichever way she
  decided, they might part without any final breach, which he was anxious to
  avoid if only for the sake of Marcus.</p>

  <p>Demetrius spoke gravely and calmly; still, the bitterness that filled his
  soul imparted a flavor to his speech that did not escape the widow, and she
  replied with some emphasis that she should be very sorry to think that any
  motives personal to herself had led to his decision; she owed much, very
  much, to his exertions and had great pleasure in expressing her obligations.
  He was aware, of course, that the property he had been managing had been
  purchased originally partly with her fortune and partly out of her husband's
  pocket, and that half of it was therefore hers and half of it the property of
  Marcus and himself; but that by her husband's will the control and management
  were hers absolutely. She had endeavored to carry out the intentions of her
  deceased husband by entrusting the stewardship of the estate to Demetrius
  while he was still quite young; under his care the income had increased, and
  she had no doubt that in the future he might achieve even greater results; at
  the same time, the misunderstandings that the whole business had given rise
  to were not to be endured, and must positively be put an end to, even if
  their income were to diminish by half.</p>

  <p>"I," she exclaimed, "am a Christian, with my whole heart and soul. I have
  dedicated my body and life to the service of my Saviour. What shall all the
  treasures of the world profit me if I lose my soul; and that, which is my
  immortal part, must inevitably perish if I allow my pockets to be filled by
  the toil of heathen peasants and slaves. I therefore must insist&mdash;and on
  this point I will not yield a jot&mdash;that our slaves in Cyrenaica, a flock
  of more than three thousand erring sheep, shall either submit to be baptized
  or be removed to make way for Christians."</p>

  <p>"That is to say ..." began Demetrius hastily.</p>

  <p>"I have not yet done," she interrupted. "So far as the peasants are
  concerned who rent and farm our land they all, without exception&mdash;as you
  said yesterday&mdash;are stiff-necked idolaters. We must give them time to
  think it over, but the annual agreement will not be renewed with any who will
  not pledge themselves to give up the old sacrifices and to worship the
  Redeemer. If they submit they will be safe&mdash;in this world and the next;
  if they refuse they must go, and the land must be let to Christians in their
  stead."</p>

  <p>"Just as I change this seat for another!" said Demetrius with a laugh, and
  lifting up a heavy bronze chair he flung it down again on the hard mosaic
  pavement so that the floor shook.</p>

  <p>Maria started violently.</p>

  <p>"My body may tremble," she said in great excitement, "but my soul is firm
  when its everlasting bliss is at stake. I insist&mdash;and my representative,
  whether he be you or another, must carry my orders into effect without an
  hour's delay&mdash;I insist that every heathen shrine, every image of the
  field and garden-gods, every altar and sacred stone which the heathens use
  for their idolatrous practices shall be pulled down, overthrown, mutilated
  and destroyed. That is what I require and insist on."</p>

  <p>"And that is what I will never consent to," cried Demetrius in a voice
  like low thunder. "I cannot and will not. These things have been held
  precious and sacred to men for thousands of years and I cannot, will not,
  blow them off the face of the earth, as you blow a feather off your cloak.
  You may go and do it yourself; you may be able to achieve it."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked Mary drawing herself up with a glance of
  indignant protest.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;if any one can do it you can!" repeated Demetrius
  imperturbably. "I went to-day to seek the images of our forefathers&mdash;the
  venerable images that were clear to our infancy, the portraits of our
  fathers' fathers and mothers, the founders of the honor of our race. And
  where are they? They have gone with the protectors of our home, the pride and
  ornament of this house&mdash;of the street, of the city&mdash;the Hermes and
  Pallas Athene that you&mdash;you flung into the lime-kiln. Old Phabis told me
  with tears in his eyes. Alas poor house that is robbed of its past, of its
  glory, and of its patron deities!"</p>

  <p>"I have placed it under a better safeguard," replied Maria in a tremulous
  voice, and she looked it Marcus with an appeal for sympathy. "Now, for the
  last time, I ask you: Will you accede to my demands or will you not?"</p>

  <p>"I will not," said Demetrius resolutely.</p>

  <p>"Then I must find a new agent to manage the estates."</p>

  <p>"You will soon find one; but your land&mdash;which is our land
  too&mdash;will become a desert. Poor land! If you destroy its shrines and
  sanctuaries you will destroy its soul; for they are the soul of the land. The
  first inhabitants gathered round the sanctuary, and on that sanctuary and the
  gods that dwell there the peasant founds his hopes of increase on what he
  sows and plants, and of prosperity for his wife and children and cattle and
  all that he has. In destroying his shrines you ruin his hopes, and with them
  all the joy of life. I know the peasant; he believes that his labors must be
  vain if you deprive him of the gods that make it thrive. He sows in hope, in
  the swelling of the grain he sees the hand of the gods who claim his joyful
  thanksgiving after the harvest is gathered in. You are depriving him of all
  that encourages and uplifts and rejoices his soul when you ruin his shrines
  and altars!"</p>

  <p>"But I give him other and better ones," replied Mary.</p>

  <p>"Take care then that they are such as he can appreciate," said Demetrius
  gravely. "Persuade him to love, to believe, to hope in the creed you force
  upon him; but do not rob him of what he trusts in before he is prepared to
  accept the substitute you offer him.&mdash;Now, let me go; we are neither of
  us in the temper to make the best arrangements for the future. One thing, at
  any rate, is certain: I have nothing more to do with the estate."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch06"
     id="ch06">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">After leaving his stepmother Demetrius made good use of his
  time and dictated a number of letters to his secretary, a slave he had
  brought with him to Alexandria, for the use of the pen was to him unendurable
  labor. The letters were on business, relating to his departure from Cyrenaica
  and his purpose of managing his own estates for the future, and when they lay
  before him, finished, rolled up and sealed, he felt that he had come to a
  mile-stone on his road, a landmark in his life. He paced the room in silence,
  trying to picture to himself the fate of the slaves and peasants who, for so
  many years, had been his faithful servants and fellow-laborers, whose
  confidence he had entirely won, and many of whom he truly loved. But he could
  not conceive of their life, their toil or their festivals, bereft of images,
  offerings, garlands, and hymns of rejoicing. To him they were as children,
  forbidden to laugh and play, and he could not help once more recurring to his
  boyhood and the day of his going to school, when, instead of running and
  shouting in his father's sunny garden, he had been made to sit still and
  silent in a dull class-room. And now had the whole world reached such a
  boundary line in existence beyond which there was to be no more freedom and
  careless joy&mdash;where a ceaseless struggle for higher things must begin
  and never end?</p>

  <p>If the Gospel were indeed true, and if all it promised could ever find
  fulfilment, it might perhaps be prudent to admit the sinfulness of man and to
  give up the joys and glories of this world to win the eternal treasure that
  it described. Many a good and wise man whom he had known&mdash;nay the
  Emperor, the great and learned Theodosius himself&mdash;was devoted heart and
  soul to the Christian faith, and Demetrius knew from his own experience that
  his mother's creed, in which he had been initiated as a boy and from which
  his father, after holding him at the font had perverted him at an early age,
  offered great consolations and enduring help to those whose existence was one
  of care, poverty, and suffering. But his laborers and servants? They were
  healthy and contented. What power on earth could induce them&mdash;a race
  that clung devotedly to custom&mdash;to desert the faith of their fathers,
  and the time-honored traditions to which they owed all the comforts and
  pleasures of life, or to seek in a strange creed the aid which they already
  believed that they possessed.</p>

  <p>He did not repent of his determination; but he nevertheless said to
  himself that, when once he was gone, Mary would proceed only too soon on the
  work of extermination and destruction; and every temple on the estate, every
  statue, every whispering grotto, every shrine and stone anointed by pious
  hands, doomed now to perish, rose before his fancy.</p>

  <p>Demetrius was accustomed to rise at cock-crow and go to bed at an early
  hour, and he was on the point of retiring even before the usual time, when
  Marcus came to his room and begged him to give him yet an hour.</p>

  <p>"You are angry with my mother," said the younger man with a look of
  melancholy entreaty, "but you know there is nothing that she would not
  sacrifice for the faith. And you can smile so bitterly! But only put yourself
  in my place. Loving my mother as I do, it is acutely painful to me to see
  another person&mdash;to see you whom I love, too, for you are my friend and
  brother&mdash;to see you, I say, turn your back on her so completely. My
  heart is heavy enough to-day I can tell you."</p>

  <p>"Poor boy!" said the countryman. "Yes, I am truly your friend, and am
  anxious to remain so; you are not to blame in this business&mdash;and for
  that matter, I am anything but cheerful. You have chosen to say: Down with
  the shrines! Perish all those who do not think as we do! Still, look at the
  thing as you will, in some cases certainly violence must ensue&mdash;nay, if
  no blood is shed it will be a wonder! You sum up the matter in one common
  term: The heathen peasants on the estate. My view of it is totally different;
  I know these farmers and their wives and children, each one by name and by
  sight. There is not one but is ready to bid me good day and shake my hand or
  kiss my dress. Many a one has come to me in tears and left me happy.&mdash;By
  the great Zeus! no one ever accused me of being soft-hearted, but I could
  wish this day that I were harder; and my blood turns to gall as I
  ask&mdash;What is all this for&mdash;to what possible end?"</p>

  <p>"For the sake and honor of the faith, Demetrius; for the eternal salvation
  of our people."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" retorted Demetrius with a drawl, "I know better. If that and
  that alone were intended you would build churches and chapels and send us
  worthy priests&mdash;Eusebius and the like&mdash;and would try to win men's
  hearts to your Lord by the love you are always talking so much about. That
  was my advice to your mother, only this morning. I believe the end might be
  attained by those means, among us as elsewhere; ultimately it will, no doubt,
  be gained&mdash;but not to-day nor to-morrow. A peasant, when he had become
  accustomed to the church and grasped a trust in the new God, would of his own
  accord give up the old gods and their sanctuaries; I could count you off a
  dozen such instances. That I could have looked on at calmly, for I want only
  men's arms and legs and do not ask for their souls; but to burn down the old
  house before you have collected wood and stone to build a new one I call
  wicked.&mdash;It is cruelty and madness, and when so shrewd a woman as your
  mother is bent on carrying through such a measure, come what may, there is
  something more behind it."</p>

  <p>"You think she wants to get rid of you&mdash;you, Demetrius!" interrupted
  Marcus eagerly. "But you are mistaken, you are altogether wrong. What you
  have done for the estate ..."</p>

  <p>"Oh! as for that!" cried the other, "what has my work to do with all this?
  Ere the year is out everything that can remind us of the heathen gods is to
  be swept away from the hamlets and fields of the pious Mary. That is what is
  intended! Then they will hurry off to the Bishop with the great news and to
  crown one marvel with another, the reversion will be secured of a martyr's
  nimbus. And this is what all this zeal is for&mdash;this and nothing
  else!"</p>

  <p>"You are speaking of my mother, remember!" cried Marcus, looking at his
  brother with a touching appeal in his eyes. Demetrius shook his shaggy head
  and spoke more temperately as he went on:</p>

  <p>"Yes, child, I had forgotten that&mdash;and I may be mistaken of course,
  for I am no more than human. Here one thing follows so close on another, and
  in this house I feel so battered and storm-tossed, that I hardly know myself.
  But old Phabis tells me that steps are being seriously taken to procure the
  title of Martyr for our father Apelles."</p>

  <p>"My mother is quite convinced that he died for the faith, and she loved
  him devotedly ..."</p>

  <p>"Then it is so!" cried Demetrius, grinding his teeth and thumping his fist
  down on the table. "The lies sown by one single man have produced a deadly
  weed that is smothering this miserable house! You&mdash;to be sure, what can
  you know of our father? I knew him; I have been present when he and his
  friends, the philosophers, have laughed to scorn things which not only you
  Christians but even pious heathen regard as sacred. Lucretius was his
  evangelist, and the Cosmogony of that utter atheist lay by his pillow and was
  his companion wherever he went."</p>

  <p>"He admired the heathen poets, but he was a Christian all the same,"
  replied Marcus.</p>

  <p>"Neither more nor less than Porphyrius, our uncle, or myself," retorted
  his brother. "Since the day when our grandfather Philippus was baptized,
  wealth and happiness have deserted this house. He gave up the old gods solely
  that he might not lose the right of supplying the city and the Emperor with
  corn, and became a Christian and made his sons Christians. But he had us
  educated by his heathen friends, and though we passed for Christians we were
  not so in fact. When it was absolutely necessary he showed himself in church
  with us; but our daily life, our pleasures, our pastimes were heathen, and
  when life began for us in earnest we offered a bleeding sacrifice to the
  gods. It was impossible to retract honestly, since a renegade Christian
  returning to the worship of the old gods is incapacitated by law from making
  a will. You know this; and when you ask me why I am content to live alone,
  without either wife or child&mdash;and I love children, even those of other
  people&mdash;a solitary man dragging out my days and nights joylessly
  enough&mdash;I tell you: I am openly and honestly a worshipper of our old
  gods, and I will not go to church because I scorn a lie. What should I do
  with children who, in consequence of my retractation, must forfeit all I
  might leave them? It was this question of inheritance only that induced my
  father to have us baptized and to make a pretense of Christianity. He set out
  for Petra with his Lucretius in his satchel&mdash;I packed it with my own
  hands into his money-bag&mdash;to put in a claim to supply grain to the 'Rock
  city.' He was slain on his way. home; most likely by his servant Anubis, who
  certainly knew what money he had with him, and who vanished and left no
  trace. Because&mdash;about the same time&mdash;a band of Saracens had fallen
  on some Christian anchorites and travellers, in the district between Petra
  and Aila, your mother chose to assume a right to call our father a martyr!
  But she knew his opinions full well, I tell you, and shed many a tear over
  them, too.&mdash;Now she has expended vast sums on church-building, she has
  opened the Xenodochium and pours her money by lavish handfuls clown the
  insatiable throats of monks and priests. To what end? To have her husband
  recognized as a martyr. Hitherto her toil and money have been wasted. In my
  estimation the Bishop is a perfectly detestable tyrant, and if I know him at
  all he will take all she will give and never grant her wish. Now she is
  preparing her great move, and hopes to startle him into compliance by a new
  marvel. She thinks that, like a juggler who turns a white egg black, she can
  turn a heathen district into a Christian one by a twist of her finger.
  Well&mdash;so far as I am concerned I will have nothing to do with the
  trick."</p>

  <p>During this harangue Marcus had alternately gazed at the floor and fixed
  his large eyes in anguish on his brother's face. For some minutes he found
  nothing to reply, and he was evidently going through a bitter mental
  struggle. Demetrius spoke no more, but arranged the sheets of papyrus that
  strewed the table. At length Marcus, after a deep sigh, broke out in a tone
  of fervent conviction and with a blissful smile that lighted up his whole
  face:</p>

  <p>"Poor mother! And others misunderstand her just as you do; I myself was in
  danger of doubting her. But I think that now I understand her perfectly. She
  loved my father so completely that she hopes now to win for his immortal soul
  the grace which he, in the flesh, neglected to strive after. He was baptized,
  so she longs to win, by her prayers and oblations, the mercy of the Lord who
  is so ready to forgive. She herself firmly believes in the martyrdom of her
  beloved dead, and if only the Church will rank him among those who have died
  for Her, he will be saved, and she will find him standing in the pure
  radiance of the realms above, with open arms, overflowing with fervent love
  and gratitude, to welcome the faithful helpmate who will have purged his
  soul. Yes, now I quite understand; and from this day forth I will aid and
  second her; the hardest task shall not be too hard, the best shall not be too
  good, if only we may open the gates of Heaven to my poor father's imperilled
  soul."</p>

  <p>As he spoke his eye glistened with ecstatic light; his brother, too, was
  touched, and to hide his emotion, he exclaimed, more recklessly and sharply
  than was his wont:</p>

  <p>"That will come all right, never fear, lad!" But he hastily wiped his eyes
  with his hand, slapped Marcus on the shoulder, and added gaily: "It is better
  to choke than to swallow down the thing you think right, and it never hurt a
  man yet to make a clean breast of his feelings, even if we do not quite agree
  we understand each other the better for it. I have my way of thinking, you
  have yours; thus we each know what the other means; but after the tragedy
  comes the satyr play, and we may as well finish this agitating evening with
  an hour's friendly chat."</p>

  <p>So saying Demetrius stretched himself on a divan and invited Marcus to do
  the same, and in a few minutes their conversation had turned, as usual, to
  the subject of horses. Marcus was full of praises of the stallions his
  brother had bred for him, and which he had ridden that very day round the
  Myssa in the Hippodrome, and his brother added with no small complacency:</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The Myssa was the Meta, or turning-post. ]</p>

  <p>"They were all bred from the same sire and from the choicest mares. I
  broke them in myself, and I only wish... But why did you not come to the
  stables this morning?"</p>

  <p>"I could not," replied Marcus coloring slightly. "Then we will go to-
  morrow to Nicopolis and I will show you how to get Megaera past the
  Taraxippios."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The terror of the horses. ]</p>

  <p>"To-morrow?" said Marcus somewhat embarrassed. "In the morning I must go
  to see Eusebius and then..."</p>

  <p>"Well, then?"</p>

  <p>"Then I must&mdash;I mean I should like..."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Well, to be sure I might, all the same.&mdash;But no, it is not to be
  done&mdash;I have..."</p>

  <p>"What, what?" cried Demetrius with increasing impatience: "My time is
  limited and if you start the horses without knowing my way of managing them
  they will certainly not do their best. As soon as the market begins to fill
  we will set out. We shall need a few hours for the Hippodrome, then we will
  dine with Damon, and before dark..."</p>

  <p>"No, no," replied Marcus, "to-morrow, certainly, I positively
  cannot..."</p>

  <p>"People who have nothing to do always lack time," replied the other. "Is
  to-morrow one of your festivals?"</p>

  <p>"No, not that=-and Good Heavens! If only I could..."</p>

  <p>"Could, could!" cried Demetrius angrily and standing close in front of his
  brother with his arms folded. "Say out honestly: 'I will not go,' or else,
  'my affairs are my own secret and I mean to keep it.'&mdash;But give me no
  more of your silly equivocations."</p>

  <p>His vehemence increased the younger man's embarrassment, and as he stood
  trying to find an explanation which might come somewhat near the truth and
  yet not betray him, Demetrius, who had stood watching him closely, suddenly
  exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"By Aphrodite, the daughter of the foam! it is a love affair&mdash;an
  assignation.&mdash;Woman, woman, always woman!"</p>

  <p>"An assignation!" cried Marcus shaking his head. "No indeed, no one
  expects me; and yet&mdash;I had rather you should misunderstand me than think
  that I had lied. Yes&mdash;I am going to seek a woman; and if I do not find
  her to-morrow, if in the course of tomorrow I do not succeed in my heart's
  desire, she is lost&mdash;not only to me, though I cannot give up the
  heavenly love for the sake of the earthly and fleshly&mdash;but to my Lord
  and Saviour. It is the life&mdash;the everlasting life or death of one of
  God's loveliest creatures that hangs on to-morrow's work."</p>

  <p>Demetrius was greatly astonished, and it was with an angry gesture of
  impatience that he replied:</p>

  <p>"Again you have overstepped the boundary within which we can possibly
  understand each other. In my opinion you are hardly old enough to undertake
  the salvation of the imperilled souls of pretty women. Take care what you are
  about, youngster! It is safe enough to go into the water with those who can
  swim, but those who sink are apt to draw you down with them. You are a good-
  looking young fellow, you have money and fine horses, and there are women
  enough who are only too ready to spread their nets abroad..."</p>

  <p>"What are you thinking of?" cried Marcus passionately. "It is I who am the
  fisher&mdash;a fisher of souls, and so every true believer ought to be.
  She&mdash;she is innocence and simplicity itself, in spite of her roguish
  sauciness. But she has fallen into the hands of a reprobate heathen, and
  here, where vice prowls about the city like a roaring lion, she will be
  lost&mdash;lost, if I do not rescue her. Twice have I seen her in my dreams;
  once close to the cavern of a raging dragon, and again on the edge of a
  precipitous cliff, and each time an angel called out to me and bid me save
  her from the jaws of the monster, and from falling into the abyss. Since then
  I seem to see her constantly; at meals, when I am in company, when I am
  driving,&mdash;and I always hear the warning voice of the angel. And now I
  feel it a sacred duty to save her&mdash;a creature on whom the Almighty has
  lavished every gift he ever bestowed on the daughters of Eve&mdash;to lead
  her into the path of Salvation."</p>

  <p>Demetrius had listened to his brother's enthusiastic speech with growing
  anxiety, but he merely shrugged his shoulders and said:</p>

  <p>"I almost envy you your acquaintance with this favorite of the gods; but
  you might, it seems to me, postpone the work of salvation. You were away from
  Alexandria for half a year, and if she could hold out so long as that
  ..."</p>

  <p>"Do not speak so; you ought not to speak so!" cried Marcus, pressing his
  hand on his heart as though in physical pain. "But I have no time to lose,
  for I must at once find out where the old singer has taken her. I am not so
  inexperienced as you seem to think. He has brought her here to trade in her
  beauty, and enrich himself. Why, you, too, saw her on board ship; I, as you
  know, had arranged for them to be taken in at my mother's Xenodochium."</p>

  <p>"Whom?" asked Demetrius folding his hands.</p>

  <p>"The singers whom I brought with me from Ostia. And now they have
  disappeared from thence, and Dada ..."</p>

  <p>"Dada!" cried Demetrius, bursting into a loud laugh without heeding Marcus
  who stepped up to him, crimson with rage. "Dada! that little fair puss! You
  see her day and night and an angel calls upon you to save that child's merry
  soul? You ought to be ashamed of yourself, boy! Why, what shall I wager now?
  I will stake this roll of gold that I could make her come with me to-
  morrow&mdash;with me, a hard-featured countryman, freckled all over like a
  plover's egg, where my clothes do not protect my skin, and with hair on end
  like the top of a broom&mdash;yes, that she will follow me to Arsinoe or
  wherever I choose to bid her. Let the hussy go, you simple innocent. Such a
  Soul as hers is of small account even in a less exclusive Heaven than yours
  is."</p>

  <p>"Take back those words!" cried Marcus, beside himself and clenching his
  fist. "But that is just like you! Your impure eyes and heart defile purity
  itself, and see spots even in the sun. Nothing is too bad for a 'singing
  girl,'I know. But that is just the marrow of the matter; it is from that very
  curse that I mean to save her. If you can accuse her of anything, speak; if
  not, and if you do not want to appear a base slanderer in my eyes, take back
  the words you have just spoken!"</p>

  <p>"Oh! I take them back of course," said Demetrius indifferently. "I know
  nothing of your beauty beyond what she has herself said to me and you and
  Cynegius and his Secretaries&mdash;with her pretty, saucy eyes. But the
  language of the eye, they say, is not always to be depended on; so take it as
  unsaid. And, if I understood you rightly, you do not even know where the
  singers are hiding? If you have no objection, I will help you to seek them
  out."</p>

  <p>"That is as you please," answered Marcus hotly. "All your mockery will not
  prevent my doing my duty."</p>

  <p>"Very right, very right," said his brother. "Perhaps this damsel is unlike
  all the other singing-girls with whom I used so often to spend a jolly
  evening in my younger days. Once, at Barca, I saw a white raven&mdash;but
  perhaps after all it was only a dove. Your opinion, in this case, is at any
  rate better founded than mine, for I never thought twice about the girl and
  you did.&mdash;But it is late; till to-morrow, Marcus."</p>

  <p>The brothers parted for the night, but when Demetrius found himself alone
  he walked up and down the room, shaking his head doubtfully. Presently, when
  his body-slave came in to pack for him, he called out crossly:</p>

  <p>"Let that alone&mdash;I shall stay in Alexandria a few days longer."</p>

  <p>Marcus could not go to bed; his brother's scorn had shaken his soul to the
  foundations. An inward voice told him that his more experienced senior might
  be right, but at the same time he hated and contemned himself for listening
  to its warnings at all. The curse that rested on Dada was that of her
  position; she herself was pure&mdash;as pure as a lily, as pure as the heart
  of a child, as pure as the blue of her eyes and the ring of her voice. He
  would obey the angel's behest! He could and he must save her!</p>

  <p>In the greatest excitement he went out of the house, through the great
  gate, into the Canopic way, and walked on. As he was about to turn down a
  side street to go to the lake he found the road stopped by soldiers, for this
  street led past the prefect's house where Cynegius, the Emperor's emissary,
  was staying; he had come, it was said, to close the Temples, and the excited
  populace had gathered outside the building, during the afternoon, to signify
  their indignant disapprobation. At sundown an armed force had been called out
  and had dispersed the crowd; but it was by another road that the young
  Christian at length made his way to the shore.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch07"
     id="ch07">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">While Marcus was restlessly wandering on the shore of
  Mareotis, dreaming of Dada's image and arranging speeches of persuasive
  eloquence by which to touch her heart and appeal to her soul, silence had
  fallen on the floating home of the singers. A light white mist, like a filmy
  veil&mdash;a tissue of clouds and moonbeams&mdash;hung over the lake. Work
  was long since over in the ship-yard, and the huge skeletons of the
  unfinished ships threw weird and ghostly shadows on the silvered strand-forms
  like black visions of crayfish, centipedes, or enormous spiders.</p>

  <p>From the town there came not a sound; it lay in the silence of intoxicated
  sleep. The Roman troops had cleared the streets, the lights were dead in
  every house, and in all the alleys and squares; only the moon shone over the
  roofs of Alexandria, while the blazing beacon of the light-house on the
  north-eastern point of the island of Pharos shone like a sun through the
  darkness.</p>

  <p>In a large cabin in the stern of the vessel lay the two girls, on soft
  woollen couches and covered with rugs. Agne was gazing wide-eyed into the
  darkness; Dada had long been asleep, but she breathed painfully and her rosy
  lips were puckered now and then as if she were in some distress. She was
  dreaming of the infuriated mob who had snatched the garland from her
  hair&mdash;she saw Marcus suddenly interfere to protect her and rescue her
  from her persecutors&mdash;then she thought she had fallen off the gangway
  that led from the land to the barge, and was in the water while old Damia
  stood on the shore and laughed at her without trying to help her. Night
  generally brought the child sound sleep or pleasant dreams, but now one
  hideous face after another haunted her.</p>

  <p>And yet the evening had brought her a great pleasure. Not long after their
  return from their walk the steward had come down to the boat and brought her
  a very beautiful dress, with greetings from his old mistress; he had at the
  same time brought an Egyptian slave-woman, well skilled in all the arts of
  the toilet, who was to wait upon her so long as she remained in Alexandria.
  Dada had never owned such a lovely dress! The under-robe was of soft
  sea-green bombyx silk, with a broad border, delicately embroidered, of a
  garland of roses and buds. The peplos was of the same color and decorated to
  match; costly clasps of mosaic, representing full-blown roses and set in oval
  gold settings, fastened it on the shoulders. In a separate case were a gold
  girdle, a bracelet, also of gold, in the shape of a snake, a gold crescent
  with a rose, like those on the shoulder-clasps, in its centre, and a metal
  mirror of spotless lustre.</p>

  <p>The slave, a middle-aged woman with a dark cunning face, had helped her to
  put on this new garment; she had also insisted on dressing her hair, and all
  the time had never ceased praising the charms that nature had bestowed on her
  young mistress, with the zeal of a lover.</p>

  <p>Agne had looked on smiling, good-naturedly handing the slave the pins and
  ribbands she had needed, and sincerely rejoicing in her companion's beauty
  and delight.</p>

  <p>At last Dada had made her appearance in the deckroom and was greeted by
  many an Ah! and Oh! of admiration from the men of the party, including
  Medius, the singer whom Karnis had met in the street. Even Herse, who had
  received her quite disagreeably on her return from the city, could not
  suppress a smile of kindly approval, though she shook her finger at her
  saying:</p>

  <p>"The old lady has set her heart on turning your head completely I see. All
  that is very pretty, but all the good it will do will be to rouse spiteful
  tongues. Remember, Dada, that you are my sister's child; I promise you I
  shall not forget it, and I shall keep my eye upon you."</p>

  <p>Orpheus made haste to light every lamp and taper, of which there were
  plenty, for the barge was handsomely furnished, and when Dada was plainly
  visible in the brilliant illumination Karnis exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"You look like a senator's daughter! Long live the Fair!"</p>

  <p>She ran up to him and kissed him; but when Orpheus walked all round her,
  examining the fineness of the tissue and the artistic finish of the clasps,
  and even turned the snake above her round elbow, she sharply bid him let her
  be.</p>

  <p>Medius, a man of the age of Karnis who had formerly been his intimate
  companion, never took his eyes off the girl, and whispered to the old
  musician that Dada would easily carry off the palm for beauty in Alexandria,
  and that with such a jewel in his keeping he might recover wealth and
  position and by quite honest means. At his suggestion she then assumed a
  variety of attitudes; she stood as Hebe, offering nectar to the gods&mdash;as
  Nausicae, listening to the tale of Odysseus&mdash;and as Sappho, singing to
  her lyre. The girl was delighted at all this, and when Medius, who kept close
  to her, tried to persuade her to perform in a similar manner in the magical
  representations at the house of Posidonius, before a select company of
  spectators, she clapped her hands exclaiming:</p>

  <p>"You took me all round the city, father, and as your reward I should like
  to earn back your pretty vineyards, I should stand like this, you know, and
  like this&mdash;to be stared at. I only hope I might not be seized with a
  sudden impulse to make a face at the audience. But if they did not come too
  close I really might ..."</p>

  <p>"You could do no better than to play the parts that Posidonius might give
  you," interrupted Medius. "His audiences like to see good daemons, the kindly
  protecting spirits, and so forth. You would have to appear among clouds
  behind a transparent veil, and the people would hail you with acclamations or
  even raise their hands in adoration."</p>

  <p>All this seemed to Dada perfectly delightful, and she was on the point of
  giving her hand to Medius in token of agreement, when her eye caught the
  anxious gaze of the young Christian girl who stood before her with a deep
  flush on her face. Agne seemed to be blushing for her. The color rushed to
  her own cheeks, and shortly saying: "No&mdash;after all, I think not," she
  turned her back on the old man and threw herself on the cushions close to
  where the wine-jug was standing. Medius now began to besiege Karnis and Herse
  with arguments, but they refused all his offers as they intended quitting
  Alexandria in a few days, so he had no alternative but to submit. Still, he
  did not altogether throw up the game, and to win Dada's consent, at any rate,
  he made her laugh with a variety of comical pranks and showed her some
  ingenious conjuring tricks, and ere long their floating home echoed with
  merriment, with the clinking of wine-cups and with songs, in which even Agne
  was obliged to take part. Medius did not leave till near midnight and Herse
  then sent them all to bed.</p>

  <p>As soon as the slave had undressed her young mistress and left the girls
  alone, Dada threw herself into the arms of Agne who was on the point of
  getting into bed, and kissed her vehemently, exclaiming: "You are
  much&mdash;so much better than I! How is that you always know what is
  right?"</p>

  <p>Then she lay down; but before she fell asleep she once more spoke to Agne:
  "Marcus will find us out, I am certain," she said, "and I should really like
  to know what he has to say to me."</p>

  <p>In a few minutes sleep had sealed her eyes, but the Christian girl lay
  awake; her thoughts would not rest, and Sleep, who the night before had taken
  her to his heart, to-night would not come near her pillow; so much to agitate
  and disturb her soul had taken place during the day.</p>

  <p>She had often before now been a silent spectator of the wild rejoicings of
  the musician's family, and she had always thought of these light-hearted
  creatures as spendthrifts who waste all their substance in a few days to
  linger afterwards through years of privation and repentance. Troubled, as she
  could not fail to be, as to the eternal salvation of these lost souls, though
  happy in her own faith, she had constantly turned for peace to her Saviour
  and always found it; but to-night it was not so, for a new and unexpected
  temptation had sprung up for her in the house of Porphyrius.</p>

  <p>She had heard Gorgo sing again, and joined her own voice with hers.
  Dirges, yearning hymns, passionate outpourings in praise of the mighty and
  beautiful divinity had filled her ear and stirred her soul with an ecstatic
  thrill, although she knew that they, were the composition of heathen poets
  and had first been sung to the harmony of lutes by reprobate idolaters. And
  yet, and yet they had touched her heart, and moved her soul to rapture, and
  filled her eyes with tears.</p>

  <p>She could not but confess to herself that she could have given no purer,
  sweeter, or loftier expression to her own woes, thankfulness, aspirations,
  and hopes of ever lasting life and glory, than this gifted creature had given
  to the utterance of her idolatry. Surprise, unrest, nay, some little jealousy
  had been mingled with her delight at Gorgo's singing. How was it that this
  heathen could feel and utter emotions which she had always conceived of as
  the special privilege of the Christian, and, for her own part, had never felt
  so fervently as in the hours when she had drawn closest to her Lord? Were not
  her own sentiments the true and right ones; had her intercourse with these
  heathens tainted her?</p>

  <p>This doubt disturbed her greatly; it must be based on something more than
  mere self-torture, for she had not once thought of asking to whom the
  two-part hymn, with its tender appeal, was addressed, when Karnis had first
  gone through it with her alone; nor even subsequently, when she had sung it
  with Gorgo&mdash;timidly at first, more boldly the second time, and finally
  without a mistake, but carried completely away by the beauty and passion of
  the emotions it expressed.</p>

  <p>She knew now, for Karnis himself had told her. It was the Lament of Isis
  for her&mdash;lost husband and brother&mdash;oh that horrible heathen
  confusion!&mdash;The departed Osiris. The wailing widow, who called on him to
  return with "the silent speech of tears," was that queen of the idolater's
  devils whose shameful worship her father had often spoke of with horror.
  Still, this dirge was so true and noble, so penetrated with fervent, agonized
  grief, that it had gone to her heart. The sorrowing Mother of God, Mary
  herself, might thus have besought the resurrection of her Son; just thus must
  the "God-like maid"&mdash;as she was called in the Arian confession of her
  father&mdash;have uttered her grief, her prayers, and her longings.</p>

  <p>But it was all a heathen delusion, all the trickery and jugglery of the
  Devil, though she had failed to see through it, and had given herself up to
  it, heart and soul. Nay, worse! for after she had learnt that Gorgo was to
  represent Isis and she herself Nephthys, the sister of the divine pair, she
  had opposed the suggestion but feebly, even though she knew that they were to
  sing the hymn together in the Temple of Isis; and when Gorgo had clasped her
  in her arms with sisterly kindness, begging her not to spoil her plans but to
  oblige her in this, she had not repulsed the tempter with firm decision, but
  merely asked for time to think it over.</p>

  <p>How indeed could she have found the heart to refuse the noble girl, whose
  beauty and voice had so struck and fascinated her, when she flung her arms
  round her neck, looked into her eyes and earnestly besought her:</p>

  <p>"Do it for my sake, to please me. I do not ask you to do anything wicked.
  Pure song is acceptable to every god. Think of your lament, if you like, as
  being for your own god who suffered on the cross. But I like singing with you
  so much; say yes. Do not refuse, for my sake!"</p>

  <p>She had thrown her arms so gladly, so much too gladly round the heathen
  lady&mdash;for she had a loving heart and no one else had ever made it a
  return in kind&mdash;and clinging closely to her she had said:</p>

  <p>"As you will; I will do whatever you like."</p>

  <p>Then Orpheus, too, had urged her to oblige Gorgo, and himself, and all of
  them; and it had seemed almost impossible to refuse the first request that
  the modest youth&mdash;to whom she would willingly have granted anything and
  everything&mdash;had ever made. Still, she had held back; and in her anxious
  bewilderment, not daring to think or act, she had tried every form of excuse
  and postponement. She would probably have been awkward enough about this, but
  Gorgo was content to press her no further, and when, after leaving the house,
  she had summoned up courage to refuse to enter the Temple of Isis, Karnis had
  only said: "Be thankful that this gifted lady, the favorite of the Muses,
  should think you worthy to sing with her. We will see about the rest by-and-
  bye."</p>

  <p>Now, in the watches of the sleepless night, she saw clearly the abyss
  above which she was standing. She, like Judas, was on the point of betraying
  her Saviour; not indeed for money, but in obedience to the transient sound of
  an earthly voice, for the pleasure of exercising her art, to indulge a
  hastily-formed liking; nay, perhaps because it satisfied her childish vanity
  to find herself put on an equality with a lady of rank and wealth, and
  matched with a singer who had roused Karnis and Orpheus to such ardent
  admiration.</p>

  <p>She was an enigma to herself; while passages out of the Bible crowded on
  her memory to reproach her conscience.</p>

  <p>There lay Dada's embroidered dress. Worn for the first time this day, in a
  month it would be unpresentably shabby and then, ere long, flung aside as
  past wearing. Like this&mdash;just like this&mdash;was every earthly
  pleasure, every joy of this brief existence. Alas, she certainly was not
  happy here in Karnis' sense of the word; but in the other world there were
  joys eternal, and she had only to deny herself the petty enjoyments of this
  life to secure unfailing and everlasting happiness in the next. There she
  would find an endless flow of all her soul could desire, there perhaps she
  might be allowed to cool the lips of Gorgo, as Lazarus cooled those of the
  rich man.</p>

  <p>She was quite clear now what her answer would be to-morrow, and, firmly
  resolved not to allow herself to think of singing in the Temple of Isis, she
  at last fell asleep just as the light began to dawn in the east. She did not
  wake till late, and it was with downcast eyes and set lips that she went with
  Karnis and Orpheus to the house of Porphyrius.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch08"
     id="ch08">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When the steward went to summons the musicians to his
  master's house he had again had no bidding for Dada, and she was very
  indignant at being left behind. "That old cornsack's daughter," she said,
  "was full of her airs, and would have nothing to say to them excepting to
  make use of them for her own purposes!" If she had not been afraid of being
  thought intrusive she would have acted on old Damia's invitation to visit her
  frequently, and have made her appearance, in defiance of Gorgo, dropping like
  a shooting-star into the midst of their practising. It never occurred to her
  to fancy that the young lady had any personal dislike to her, for, though she
  might be ignored and forgotten, who had ever had any but a kind word for her.
  At the same time she assumed the right of feeling that "she could not bear"
  the haughty Gorgo, and as the party set out she exclaimed to Agne, "Well, you
  need not kill her for me, but at any rate, I send her no greeting; it is a
  shame that I should be left to mope alone with Herse. Do not be surprised if
  you find me turned to a stark, brown mummy&mdash;for we are in Egypt, you
  know, the land of mummies. I bequeath my old dress to you, my dear, for I
  know you would never put on the new one. If you bewail me as you ought I will
  visit you in a dream, and put a sugarplum in your mouth&mdash;a cake of
  ambrosia such as the gods eat. You are not even leaving me Papias to
  tease!"</p>

  <p>For in fact Agne's little brother, dressed in a clean garment, was to be
  taken to Gorgo who had expressed a wish to see him.</p>

  <p>When they had all left the ship Dada soon betrayed how superficial her
  indignation had been; for, presently spying through the window of the cabin
  the young cavalry officer's grey-bearded father, she sprang up the narrow
  steps&mdash;barefoot as she was accustomed to be when at home&mdash;and threw
  herself on a cushion to lean over the gunwale of the upper deck, which was
  shaded by a canvas awning, to watch the ship-yard and the shore-path. Before
  she had begun to weary of this occupation the waiting-slave, who had been up
  to the house to put various matters in order, came back to the vessel, and
  squatting down at her feet was ready to give her all the information she
  chose to require. Dada's first questions naturally related to Gorgo. The
  young mistress, said the slave, had already dismissed many suitors, the sons
  of the greatest families of Alexandria, and if her suspicions&mdash;those of
  Sachepris, the slave&mdash;were well founded, all for the sake of the old
  shipbuilder's son, whom she had known from childhood and who was now an
  officer in the Imperial guard. However, as she opined, this attachment could
  hardly lead to marriage, since Constantine was a zealous Christian and his
  family were immeasurably beneath that of Porphyrius in rank; and though he
  had distinguished himself greatly and risen to the grade of Prefect, Damia,
  who on all occasions had the casting-vote, had quite other views for her
  granddaughter.</p>

  <p>All this excited Dada's sympathies to the highest pitch, but she listened
  with even greater attention when her gossip began to speak of Marcus, his
  mother, and his brother. In this the Egyptian slave was the tool of old
  Damia. She had counted on being questioned about the young Christian, and as
  soon as Dada mentioned his name she shuffled on her knees close up to the
  girl, laid her hand gently on her arm and looking up into her eyes with a
  meaning flash, she whispered in broken Greek&mdash;and hastily, for Herse was
  bustling about the deck: "Such a pretty mistress, such a young mistress as
  you, and kept here like a slave! If the young mistress only chose she could
  easily&mdash;quite easily&mdash;have as good a lover as our Gorgo, and
  better; so pretty and so young! And I know some one who would dress the
  pretty mistress in red gold and pale pearls and bright jewels, if sweet Dada
  only said the word."</p>

  <p>"And why should sweet Dada not say the word?" echoed the girl gaily. "Who
  is it that has so many nice things and all for me? You&mdash;I shall never
  remember your name if I live to be as old as Damia..."</p>

  <p>"Sachepris, Sachepris is my name," said the woman, "but call me anything
  else you like. The lover I mean is the son of the rich Christian, Mary. A
  handsome man, my lord Marcus; and he has horses, such fine horses, and more
  gold pieces than the pebbles on the shore there. Sachepris knows that he has
  sent out slaves to look for the pretty mistress. Send him a token&mdash;write
  to my lord Marcus."</p>

  <p>"Write?" laughed Dada. "Girls learn other things in my country; but if I
  could&mdash;shall I tell you something? I would not write him a line. Those
  who want me may seek me!"</p>

  <p>"He is seeking, he is trying to find the pretty mistress," declared the
  woman; "he is full of you, quite full of you, and if I dared..."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I would go and say to my lord Marcus, quite in a secret..."</p>

  <p>"Well, what? Speak out, woman."</p>

  <p>"First I would tell him where the pretty mistress is hidden; and then say
  that he might hope once&mdash;this evening perhaps&mdash;he is not far off,
  he is quite near this ... over there; do you see that little white house? It
  is a tavern and the host is a freedman attached to the lady Damia, and for
  money he would shut his shop up for a day, for a night, for many
  days.&mdash;Well, and then I would say&mdash;shall I tell you all? My lord
  Marcus is there, waiting for his pretty mistress, and has brought her dresses
  that would make the rose-garment look a rag. You would have gold too, as much
  gold as heart can wish. I can take you there, and he will meet you with open
  arms."</p>

  <p>"What, this evening?" cried Dada, and the blue veins swelled on her white
  forehead. "You hateful, brown serpent! Did Gorgo teach you such things as
  this? It is horrible, disgraceful, sickening!"</p>

  <p>So base a proposal was the last thing she would ever have expected from
  Marcus&mdash;of all men in the world, Marcus, whom she had imagined so good
  and pure! She could not believe it; and as her glance met the cunning glitter
  of the Egyptian's eyes her own sparkled keenly, and she exclaimed with a
  vehemence and decision which her attendant had never suspected in her:</p>

  <p>"It is deceit and falsehood from beginning to end! Go, woman, I will hear
  no more of it. Why should Marcus have come to you since yesterday if he does
  not know where I am? You are silent&mdash;you will not say? ... Oh! I
  understand it all. He&mdash;I know he would never have ventured it. But it is
  your 'noble lady Damia'&mdash;that old woman, who has told you what to say.
  You are her echo, and as for Marcus... Confess, confess at once, you
  witch..."</p>

  <p>"Sachepris is only a poor slave," said the woman raising her hands in
  entreaty. "Sachepris can only obey, and if the pretty mistress were to tell
  my lady Damia ..."</p>

  <p>"It was she then who sent for me to go to the little tavern?"</p>

  <p>The woman nodded. "And Marcus?"</p>

  <p>"If the pretty mistress had consented ..."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;but Great Isis! if you tell of me!"</p>

  <p>"I will not tell; go on."</p>

  <p>"I should have gone to my lord Marcus and invited him, from you ..."</p>

  <p>"It is shameful!" interrupted Dada, and a shudder ran through her slight
  frame. "How cruel, how horrible it is! You&mdash;you will stay here till the
  others come home and then you will go home to the old woman. I thank the
  gods, I have two hands and need no maid to wait upon me! But look
  there&mdash;what is the meaning of that? That pretty litter has stopped and
  there is an old man signing to you."</p>

  <p>"It is the widow Mary's house steward," whined the woman, while Dada
  turned pale, wondering what a messenger from Marcus' mother could want
  here.</p>

  <p>Herse, who had kept a watchful eye on the landing-plank, on Dada's
  account, had also seen the approach of the widow's messenger and suspected a
  love-message from Marcus; but she was utterly astounded when the old man
  politely but imperiously desired her&mdash;Herse to get into the litter which
  would convey her to his mistress's house. Was this a trap? Did he merely want
  to tempt her from the vessel so as to clear the way for his young master?
  No&mdash;for he handed her a tablet on which there was a written message, and
  she, an Alexandrian, had been well educated and could read:</p>

  <p>"Mary, the widow of Apelles, to the wife of Karnis, the singer." And then
  followed the same urgent request as she had already received by word of
  mouth. To reassure herself entirely she called the slave-woman aside, and
  asked her whether Phabis was indeed a trust worthy servant of the widow's.
  Evidently there was no treason to be apprehended and she must obey the
  invitation, though it disturbed her greatly; but she was a cautious woman,
  with not only her heart but her brains and tongue in the right place, and she
  at once made up her mind what must be done under the circumstances. While she
  gave a few decorative touches to her person she handed the tablet to the
  waiting-woman, whom she had taken into her own room, and desired her to carry
  it at once to her husband, and tell him whither she had gone, and to beg him
  to return without delay to take care of Dada. But what if her husband and son
  could not come away? The girl would be left quite alone, and then... The
  picture rose before her anxious mind of Marcus appearing on the scene and
  tempting Dada on shore&mdash;of her niece stealing away by herself even, if
  the young Christian failed to discover her present residence&mdash;loitering
  alone along the Canopic way or the Bruclumn, where, at noon, all that was
  most disreputable in Alexandria was to be seen at this time of year&mdash;she
  saw, shuddered, considered&mdash;and suddenly thought of an expedient which
  seemed to promise an issue from the difficulty. It was nothing new and a
  favorite trick among the Egyptians; she had seen is turned to account by a
  lame tailor at whose house her father had lodged, when he had to go out to
  his customers and leave his young negress wife alone at home. Dada was lying
  barefoot on the deck: Herse would hide her shoes.</p>

  <p>She hastily acted on this idea, locking up not only Dada's sandals, but
  also Agne's and her own, in the trunk they had saved; a glance at the slave's
  feet assured her that hers could be of no use.</p>

  <p>"Not if fire were to break out," thought she, "would my Dada be seen in
  the streets with those preposterous things on her pretty little feet."</p>

  <p>When this was done Herse breathed more freely, and as she took leave of
  her niece, feeling perhaps that she owed her some little reparation, she said
  in an unusually kind tone:</p>

  <p>"Good bye, child. Try to amuse yourself while I am gone. There is plenty
  to look at here, and the others will soon be back again. If the city is
  fairly quiet this evening we will all go out together, to Canopus, to eat
  oysters. Good bye till we meet again, my pet!" She kissed the child, who
  looked up at her in astonishment, for her adopted mother was not usually
  lavish of such endearments.</p>

  <p>Before long Dada was alone, cooling herself with her new fan and eating
  sweetmeats; but she could not cease thinking of the shameful treachery
  planned by old Damia, and while she rejoiced to reflect that she had not
  fallen into the net, and had seen through the plot, her wrath against the
  wicked old woman and Gorgo&mdash;whom she could not help
  including&mdash;burnt within her. Meanwhile she looked about her, expecting
  to see Marcus, or perhaps the young officer. Finding it impossible to think
  any evil of the young Christian, and having already trusted him so far, her
  fancy dwelt on him with particular pleasure; but she was curious, too, about
  the prefect, the early love of the proud merchant's daughter.</p>

  <p>Time went on; the sun was high in the heavens, she was tired of staring,
  wondering and thinking, and, yawning wearily, she began to consider whether
  she would make herself comfortable for a nap, or go down stairs and fill up
  the time by dressing herself up in her new garments. However, before she
  could do either, the slave returned from her errand to the house, and a few
  moments after she espied the young officer crossing the ship-yard towards the
  lake; she sat up, set the crescent straight that she wore in her hair, and
  waved her fan in a graceful greeting.</p>

  <p>The cavalry prefect, who knew that, of old, the barge was often used by
  Porphyrius' guests, though he did not happen to have heard who were its
  present occupants&mdash;bowed, with military politeness and precision, to the
  pretty girl lounging on the deck. Dada returned the greeting; but this seemed
  likely to be the end of their acquaintance, for the soldier walked on without
  turning round. He looked handsomer even than he had seemed the day before;
  his hair was freshly oiled and curled, his scale-armor gleamed as brightly,
  and his crimson tunic was as new and rich as if he were going at once to
  guard the Imperial throne. The merchant's daughter had good taste, but her
  friend looked no less haughty than herself. Dada longed to make his
  acquaintance and find out whether he really had no eyes for any one but
  Gorgo. To discover that it was not so, little as she cared about him
  personally, would have given her infinite satisfaction, and she decided that
  she must put him to the test. But there was no time to lose, so, as it would
  hardly do to call after him, she obeyed a sudden impulse, flung overboard the
  handsome fan which had been in her possession but one day, and gave a little
  cry in which alarm and regret were most skilfully and naturally
  expressed.</p>

  <p>This had the wished-for effect. The officer turned round, his eyes met
  hers, and Dada leaned far over the boat's side pointing to the water and
  exclaiming:</p>

  <p>"It is in the water&mdash;it has fallen into the lake!&mdash;my fan!"</p>

  <p>The officer again bowed slightly; then he walked from the path down to the
  water's edge, while Dada went on more quietly:</p>

  <p>"There, close there! Oh, if only you would! ...</p>

  <p>"I am so fond of the fan, it is so pretty. Do you see, it is quite
  obliging? it is floating towards you!" Constantine had soon secured the fan,
  and shook it to dry it as he went across the plank to the vessel. Dada
  joyfully received it, stroked the feathers smooth, and warmly thanked its
  preserver, while he assured her that he only wished he could have rendered
  her some greater service. He was then about to retire with a bow no less
  distant than before, but he found himself unexpectedly detained by the
  Egyptian slave who, placing herself in his way, kissed the hem of his tunic
  and exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"What joy for my lord your father and the lady your mother, and for poor
  Sachepris! My lord Constantine at home again!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, at home at last," said the soldier in a deep pleasant voice. "Your
  old mistress is still hale and hearty? That is well. I am on my way to the
  others."</p>

  <p>"They know that you have come," replied the slave. "Glad, they are all
  glad. They asked if my lord Constantine forgot old friends."</p>

  <p>"Never, not one!"</p>

  <p>"How long now since my lord Constantine went away&mdash;two, three years,
  and just the same. Only a cut over the eyes&mdash;may the hand wither that
  gave the blow!"</p>

  <p>Dada had already observed a broad scar which marked the soldier's brow as
  high up as she could see it for the helmet, and she broke in:</p>

  <p>"How can you men like to slash and kill each other? Just think, if that
  cut had been only a finger's breadth lower&mdash;you would have lost your
  eyes, and oh! it is better to be dead than blind. When all the world is
  bright not to be able to see it; what must that be! The whole earth in
  darkness so that you see nothing&mdash;no one; neither the sky, nor the lake,
  nor the boat, nor even me."</p>

  <p>"That would indeed be a pity," said the prefect with a laugh and a
  shrug.</p>

  <p>"A pity!" exclaimed Dada. "As if it were nothing at all! I should find
  something else to say than that. It gives me a shudder only to think of being
  blind. How dreadfully dull life can be with one's eyes open! so what must it
  be when they are of no use and one cannot even look about one. Do you know
  that you have done me not one service only, but two at once?"</p>

  <p>"I?" said the officer.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you. But the second is not yet complete. Sit down awhile, I
  beg&mdash;there is a seat. You know it is a fatal omen if a visitor does not
  sit down before he leaves.&mdash;That is well.&mdash;And now, may I ask you:
  do you take off your helmet when you go into battle? No.&mdash;Then how could
  a swordcut hurt your forehead?"</p>

  <p>"In a hand to hand scuffle," said the young man, "everything gets out of
  place. One man knocked my helmet off and another gave me this cut in my
  face."</p>

  <p>"Where did it happen?"</p>

  <p>"On the Savus, where we defeated Maximus."</p>

  <p>"And had you this same helmet on?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly."</p>

  <p>"Oh! pray let me look at it! I can still see the dent in the metal; how
  heavy such a thing must be to wear!"</p>

  <p>Constantine took off his helmet with resigned politeness and put it into
  her hands. She weighed it, thought it fearfully heavy, and then lifted it up
  to put it on her own fair curls; but this did not seem to please her new
  acquaintance, and saying rather shortly: "Allow me&mdash;" he took it from
  her, set it on his head and rose.</p>

  <p>But Dada pointed eagerly to the seat.</p>

  <p>"No, no," she said, "I have not yet had enough of your second kindness. I
  was on the point of death from sheer tedium; then you came, just in time; and
  if you want to carry out your work of mercy you must tell me something about
  the battle where you were wounded, and who took care of you afterwards, and
  whether the women of Pannonia are really as handsome as they are said to
  be..."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to say that I have not time," interrupted the officer.
  "Sachepris here is far better qualified to amuse you than I; some years
  since, at any rate, she lead a wonderful store of tales. I wish you a
  pleasant day!"</p>

  <p>And with this farewell greeting, Constantine left the vessel, nor did he
  once look back at it or its pretty inhabitant as he made his way towards the
  house of Porphyrius.</p>

  <p>Dada as she gazed after him colored with vexation; again she had done a
  thing that Herse and&mdash;which she regretted still more&mdash;that Agne
  would certainly disapprove of. The stranger whom she had tried to draw into a
  flirtation was a really chivalrous man. Gorgo might be proud of such a lover;
  and if now, he were to go to her and tell her, probably with some annoyance,
  how provokingly he had been delayed by that pert little singing-girl, it
  would be all her own fault. She felt as though there were something in her
  which forced her to seem much worse than she really was, and wished to be.
  Agne, Marcus, the young soldier&mdash;nay, even Gorgo, were loftier and
  nobler than she or her people, and she was conscious for the first time that
  the dangers from which Marcus had longed to protect her were not the
  offspring of his fancy. She could not have found a name for them, but she
  understood that she was whirled and tossed through life from one thing to
  another, like a leaf before the wind, bereft of every stay or holdfast,
  defenceless even against the foolish vagaries of her own nature. Everyone,
  thought the girl to herself, distrusted and suspected her, and, solely
  because she was one of a family of singers, dared to insult and dishonor her.
  A strange spite against Fate, against her uncle and aunt, against herself
  even, surged up in her, and with it a vague longing for another and a better
  life.</p>

  <p>Thus meditating she looked down into the water, not noticing what was
  going on around her, till the slave-woman, addressing her by name, pointed to
  a carriage drawn up at the side of the road that divided the grove of the
  Temple of Isis from the ship-yard, and which the Egyptian believed that she
  recognized as belonging to Marcus. Dada started up and ran off to the cabin
  to fetch her shoes, but everything in the shape of a sandal had vanished, and
  Herse had been wise when she had looked at those of the Egyptian, for Dada
  did the same and would not have hesitated to borrow them if they had been a
  little less dirty and clumsy.</p>

  <p>Herse, no doubt, had played her this trick, and it was easy to guess why!
  It was only to divert her suspicions that the false woman had been so
  affectionate at parting. It was cheating, treachery-cruel and shameful! She,
  who had always submitted like a lamb&mdash;but this was too much&mdash;this
  she could not bear&mdash;this! ... The slave-woman now followed her to desire
  her to come up on deck; a new visitor had appeared on the scene, an old
  acquaintance and fellow-voyager: Demetrius, Marcus' elder brother.</p>

  <p>At any other time she would have made him gladly welcome, as a companion
  and comfort in her solitude; but he had chosen an evil hour for his visit and
  his proposals, as the girl's red cheeks and tearful eyes at once told
  him.</p>

  <p>He had come to fetch her, cost him what it might, and to carry her away to
  his country-home, near Arsinoe on the coast. It was not that he had any mad
  desire to make her his own, but that he thought it his most urgent duty to
  preserve his inexperienced brother from the danger into which his foolish
  passion for the little singing-girl was certain to plunge him. A purse full
  of gold, and a necklace of turquoise and diamonds, which he had purchased
  from a jeweller in the Jews' quarter for a sum for which he had often sold a
  ship-load of corn or a whole cellar full of wine or oil, were to supplement
  his proposals; and he went straight to the point, asking the girl simply and
  plainly to leave her friends and accompany him to Arsinoe. When she asked
  him, in much astonishment, "What to do there?" he told her he wanted a
  cheerful companion; he had taken a fancy to her saucy little nose, and though
  he could not flatter himself that he had ever found favor in her eyes he had
  brought something with him which she would certainly like, and which might
  help him to win her kindness. He was not niggardly, and if this&mdash;and
  this&mdash;and he displayed the sparkling necklace and laid the purse on her
  pillow&mdash;could please her she might regard them as an earnest of more, as
  much more as she chose, for his pockets were deep.</p>

  <p>Dada did not interrupt him, for the growing indignation with which she
  heard him took away her breath. This fresh humiliation was beyond the bounds
  of endurance; and when at last she recovered her powers of speech and action,
  she flung the purse off the divan, and as it fell clattering on the floor,
  she kicked it away as far as possible, as though it were plague-tainted.
  Then, standing upright in front of her suitor, she exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Shame upon you all! You thought that because I am a poor girl, a singing-
  girl, and because you have filthy gold... Your brother Marcus would never
  have done such a thing, I am very sure! ... And you, a horrid peasant! ... If
  you ever dare set foot on this vessel again, Karnis and Orpheus shall drive
  you away as if you were a thief or an assassin! Eternal Gods! what is it that
  I have done, that everyone thinks I must be wicked? Eternal Gods..."</p>

  <p>And she burst into loud spasmodic sobs and vanished down the steps that
  led below.</p>

  <p>Demetrius called after her in soothing words and tones, but she would not
  listen. Then he sent down the slave to beg Dada to grant him a hearing, but
  the only answer he received was an order to quit the barge at once.</p>

  <p>He obeyed, and as he picked up the purse he thought to himself:</p>

  <p>"I may buy ship and vineyard back again; but I would send four more after
  those if I could undo this luckless deed. If I were a better and a worthier
  man, I might not so easily give others credit for being evil and
  unworthy."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch09"
     id="ch09">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The town of Alexandria was stirred to its very foundations.
  From dawn till night every centre of public traffic and intercourse was the
  scene of hostile meetings between Christians and heathen, with frequent frays
  and bloodshed, only stopped by the intervention of the soldiery. Still, as we
  see that the trivial round of daily tasks is necessarily fulfilled, even when
  the hand of Fate lies heaviest on a household, and that children cannot
  forego their play even when their father is stretched on his death-bed, so
  the minor interests of individual lives pursued their course, even in the
  midst of the general agitation and peril.</p>

  <p>The current of trade and of public business was, of course, checked at
  many points, but they never came to a stand-still. The physician visited the
  sick, the convalescent made his first attempt, leaning on a friendly arm, to
  walk from his bedroom to the "viridarium," and alms were given and received.
  Hatred was abroad and rampant, but love held its own, strengthening old ties
  and forming new ones. Terror and grief weighed on thousands of hearts, while
  some tried to make a profit out of the prevailing anxiety, and
  others&mdash;many others&mdash;went forth, as light-hearted as ever, in
  pursuit of pleasure and amusement.</p>

  <p>Horses were ridden and driven in the Hippodrome, and feasts were held in
  the pleasure-houses of Canopus, with music and noisy mirth; in the public
  gardens round the Paneum cock-fighting and quail-fighting were as popular as
  ever, and eager was the betting in new gold or humble copper. Thus may we see
  a child, safe on the roof of its father's house, floating its toy boat on the
  flood that has drowned them all out; thus might a boy fly his gaudy kite in
  the face of a gathering storm; thus does the miser, on whom death has already
  laid its bony hand, count his hoarded coin; thus thoughtless youth dances
  over the heaving soil at the very foot of a volcano. What do these care for
  the common weal? Each has his separate life and personal interests. What he
  himself needs or desires&mdash;the greatest or the least&mdash;is to him more
  important and more absorbing than the requirements of the vast organism in
  which he is no more than a drop of blood or the hair of an eyelash.</p>

  <p>Olympius was still in concealment in the house of
  Porphyrius&mdash;Olympius, whose mind and will had formerly had such
  imperious hold on the fate of the city, and to whose nod above half of the
  inhabitants were still obedient. Porphyrius and his family shared his views
  and regarded themselves as his confederates; but, even among them, the minor
  details of life claimed their place, and Gorgo, who entered into the struggle
  for the triumph of the old gods, gave but a half-hearted attention to the
  great cause to which she was enthusiastically devoted, because a companion of
  her childhood, to whose attentions she had every claim, delayed his visit
  longer than was kind.</p>

  <p>She had performed her 'Isis' lament the day before with all her heart and
  soul, and had urgently claimed Agne's assistance; but to-day, though she had
  been singing again and well, she had stopped to listen whenever she heard a
  door open in the adjoining room or voices in the garden, and had sung
  altogether with so much less feeling and energy than before that Karnis
  longed to reprove her sharply enough. This, however, would have been too
  indiscreet, so he could only express his annoyance by saying to his son, in a
  loud whisper:</p>

  <p>"The most remarkable gifts, you see, and the highest abilities are of no
  avail so long as Art and Life are not one and the same&mdash;so long as Art
  is not the Alpha and Omega of existence, but merely an amusement or a
  decoration."</p>

  <p>Agne had been true to herself, and had modestly but steadfastly declared
  that she could not possibly enter the temple of Isis, and her refusal had
  been accepted quite calmly, and without any argument or controversy. She had
  not been able to refuse Gorgo's request that she would repeat to-day the
  rehearsal she had gone through yesterday, since, to all appearance, her
  cooperation at the festival had been altogether given up. How could the girl
  guess that the venerable philosopher, who had listened with breathless
  admiration to their joint performance, had taken upon himself to dissipate
  her doubts and persuade her into compliance?</p>

  <p>Olympius laid the greatest stress on Agne's assistance, for every one who
  clung to the worship of the old gods was to assemble in the sanctuary of
  Isis; and the more brilliant and splendid the ceremony could be made the more
  would that enthusiasm be fired which, only too soon, would be put to crucial
  proof. On quitting the temple the crowd of worshippers, all in holiday garb,
  were to pass in front of the Prefect's residence, and if only they could
  effect this great march through the city in the right frame of mind, it might
  confidently be expected that every one who was not avowedly Jew or Christian,
  would join the procession. It would thus become a demonstration of
  overwhelming magnitude and Cynegius, the Emperor's representative, could not
  fail to see what the feeling was of the majority of the towns folk, and what
  it was to drive matters to extremes and lay hands on the chief temples of
  such a city.</p>

  <p>To Olympius the orator, grown grey in the exercise of logic and eloquence,
  it seemed but a small matter to confute the foolish doubts of a wilful girl.
  He would sweep her arguments to the winds as the storm drives the clouds
  before it; and any one who had seen the two together&mdash;the fine old man
  with the face and front of Zeus, with his thoughtful brow and broad chest,
  who could pour forth a flood of eloquence fascinatingly persuasive or
  convincingly powerful, and the modest, timid girl&mdash;could not have
  doubted on which side the victory must be.</p>

  <p>To-day, for the first time, Olympius had found leisure for a prolonged
  interview with his old friend Karnis, and while the girls were in the garden,
  amusing little Papias by showing him the swans and tame gazelles, the
  philosopher had made enquiries as to the Christian girl's history and then
  had heard a full account of the old musician's past life. Karnis felt it as a
  great favor that his old friend, famous now for his learning&mdash;the leader
  of his fellow-thinkers in the second city of the world, the high-priest of
  Serapis, to whose superior intellect he himself had bowed even in their
  student days&mdash;should remember his insignificant person and allow him to
  give him the history of the vicissitudes which had reduced him&mdash;the
  learned son of a wealthy house&mdash;to the position of a wandering
  singer.</p>

  <p>Olympius had been his friend at the time when Karnis, on leaving college,
  instead of devoting himself to business and accounts, as his father wished,
  had thrown himself into the study of music, and at once distinguished himself
  as a singer, lute-player and leader of heathen choirs. Karnis was in
  Alexandria when the news reached him of his father's death. Before quitting
  the city he married Herse, who was beneath him alike in birth and in fortune,
  and who accompanied him on his return to Tauromenium in Sicily, where he
  found himself the possessor of an inheritance of which the extent and
  importance greatly astonished him.</p>

  <p>At Alexandria he had been far better acquainted with the theatre than with
  the Museum or the school of the Serapeum; nay, as an amateur, he had often
  sung in the chorus there and acted as deputy for the regular leader. The
  theatre in his native town of Tauromenium had also been a famous one of old,
  but, at the time of his return, it had sunk to a very low ebb. Most of the
  inhabitants of the beautiful city nestling at the foot off Etna, had been
  converted to Christianity; among them the wealthy citizens at whose cost the
  plays had been performed and the chorus maintained. Small entertainments were
  still frequently given, but the singers and actors had fallen off, and in
  that fine and spacious theatre nothing was ever done at all worthy of its
  past glories. This Karnis deeply regretted, and with his wonted energy and
  vigor he soon managed to win the interest of those of his fellow-citizens who
  remained faithful to the old gods and had still some feeling for the music
  and poetry of the ancient Greeks, in his plans for their revival.</p>

  <p>His purpose was to make the theatre the centre of a reaction against the
  influence of the Christians, by vieing with the Church in its efforts to win
  back the renegade heathen and confirming the faithful in their adhesion. The
  Greeks of Tauromenium should be reminded from the stage-boards of the might
  of the old gods and the glories of their past. To this end it was needful to
  restore the ruined theatre, and Karnis, after advancing the greater part of
  the money required, was entrusted with the management. He devoted himself
  zealously to the task, and soon was so successful that the plays at
  Tauromenium, and the musical performances in its Odeum, attracted the
  citizens in crowds, and were talked of far and wide. Such success was of
  course only purchased at a heavy cost, and in spite of Herse's warnings,
  Karnis would never hesitate when the object in view was the preservation or
  advancement of his great work.</p>

  <p>Thus passed twenty years; then there came a day when his fine fortune was
  exhausted, and a time when the Christian congregation strained every nerve to
  deal a death-blow to the abomination of desolation in their midst. Again and
  again, and with increasing frequency, there were sanguinary riots between the
  Christians who forced their way into the theatre and the heathen audience,
  till at last a decree of the Emperor Theodosius prohibited the performance of
  heathen plays or music.</p>

  <p>Now, the theatre at Tauromenium, for which Karnis had either given or
  advanced his whole inheritance, had ceased to exist, and the usurers who,
  when his own fortune was spent, had lent him moneys on the security of the
  theatre itself&mdash;while it still flourished&mdash;or on his personal
  security, seized his house and lands and would have cast him into the
  debtor's prison if he had not escaped that last disgrace by flight. Some good
  friends had rescued his family and helped them to follow him, and when they
  rejoined him he had begun his wanderings as a singer. Many a time had life
  proved miserable enough; still, he had always remained true to his art and to
  the gods of Olympus.</p>

  <p>Olympius had listened to his narrative with many tokens of sympathy and
  agreement, and when Karnis, with tears in his eyes, brought his story to a
  close, the philosopher laid his hand on his friend's shoulder and drawing him
  towards him, exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Well done, my brave old comrade! We will both be faithful to the same
  good cause! You have made sacrifices for it as I have; and we need not
  despair yet. If we triumph here our friends in a thousand towns will begin to
  look up. The reading of the stars last night, and the auguries drawn from
  this morning's victims, portend great changes. What is down to the ground
  to-day may float high in the air to-morrow. All the signs indicate: 'A fall
  to the Greatest;' and what can be greater than Rome, the old tyrant queen of
  the nations? The immediate future, it is true, can hardly bring the final
  crash, but it is fraught with important consequences to us. I dreamed of the
  fall of the Caesars, and of a great Greek Empire risen from the ruins,
  powerful and brilliant under the special protection of the gods of Olympus;
  and each one of us must labor to bring about the realization of this dream.
  You have set a noble example of devotion and self-sacrifice, and I thank you
  in the name of all those who feel with us&mdash;nay, in the name of the gods
  themselves whom I serve! The first thing to be done now is to avert the blow
  which the Bishop intends shall strike us by the hand of Cynegius&mdash;it has
  already fallen on the magnificent sanctuary of the Apamaean Zeus. If the
  ambassador retires without having gained his purpose the balance will be
  greatly&mdash;enormously, in our favor, and it will cease to be a folly to
  believe in the success of our cause."</p>

  <p>"Ah! teach us to hope once more," cried the musician. "That in itself is
  half the victory; still, I cannot see how this delay..."</p>

  <p>"It would give us time, and that is what we want," replied Olympius.
  "Everything is in preparation, but nothing is ready. Alexandria, Athens,
  Antioch, and Neapolis are to be the centres of the outbreak. The great
  Libanius is not a man of action, and even he approves of our scheme. No less
  a man than Florentin has undertaken to recruit for our cause among the
  heathen officers in the army. Messala, and the great Gothic captains Fraiut
  and Generid are ready to fight for the old gods. Our army will not lack
  leaders..."</p>

  <p>"Our army!" exclaimed Karnis in surprise. "Is the matter so far
  advanced?"</p>

  <p>"I mean the army of the future," cried Olympius enthusiastically. "It does
  not count a man as yet, but is already distributed into several legions. The
  vigor of mind and body&mdash;our learned youth on one hand and strong-armed
  peasantry on the other&mdash;form the nucleus of our force. Maximus could
  collect, in the utmost haste, the army which deprived Gratian of his throne
  and life, and was within a Hair-breadth of overthrowing Theodosius; and what
  was he but an ambitious rebel, and what tempted his followers but their hopes
  of a share in the booty? But we&mdash;we enlist them in the name of the
  loftiest ideas and warmest desires of the human heart, and, as the prize of
  victory, we show them the ancient faith with freedom of thought&mdash;the
  ancient loveliness of life. The beings whom the Christians can win
  over&mdash;a patch-work medley of loathsome Barbarians&mdash;let them wear
  out their lives as they choose! We are Greeks&mdash;the thinking brain, the
  subtle and sentient soul of the world. The polity, the empire, that we shall
  found on the overthrow of Theodosius and of Rome shall be Hellenic, purely
  Hellenic. The old national spirit, which made the Greeks omnipotent against
  the millions of Darius and Xerxes, shall live again, and we will keep the
  Barbarians at a distance as a Patrician forbids his inferiors to count
  themselves as belonging to his illustrious house. The Greek gods, Greek
  heroism, Greek art and Greek learning, under our rule shall rise from the
  dust&mdash;all the more promptly for the stringent oppression under which
  their indomitable spirit has so long languished."</p>

  <p>"You speak to my heart!" cried Karnis. "My old blood flows more swiftly
  already, and if I only had a thousand talents left to give..."</p>

  <p>"You would stake them on the future Greek Empire," said Olympius eagerly.
  "And we have adherents without number who feel as you do, my trusty friend.
  We shall succeed&mdash;as the great Julian would have succeeded but for the
  assassins who laid him low at so early an age; for Rome..."</p>

  <p>"Rome is still powerful."</p>

  <p>"Rome is a colossus built up of a thousand blocks; but among them a
  hundred and more be but loosely in their places, and are ready to drop away
  from the body of the foul monster&mdash;sooner rather than later. Our shout
  alone will shake them down, and they will fall on our side, we may choose the
  best for our own use. Ere long&mdash;a few months only&mdash;the hosts will
  gather in the champaign country at the foot of Vesuvius, by land and by sea;
  Rome will open its gates wide to us who bring her back her old gods; the
  Senate will proclaim the emperor deposed and the Republic restored.
  Theodosius will come out against us. But the Idea for which we go forth to
  fight will hover before us, will stir the hearts of those soldiers and
  officers who would gladly&mdash;ah! how gladly-sacrifice to the Olympian gods
  and who only kiss the wounds of the crucified Jew under compulsion. They will
  desert from the labarum, which Constantine carried to victory, to our
  standards; and those standards are all there, ready for use; they have been
  made in this city and are lying hidden in the house of Apollodorus.
  Heaven-sent daemons showed them in a vision to my disciple Ammonius, when he
  was full of the divinity and lost in ecstasy, and I have had them made from
  his instructions."</p>

  <p>"And what do they represent?"</p>

  <p>"The bust of Serapis with the 'modius' on his head. It is framed in a
  circle with the signs of the zodiac and the images of the great Olympian
  deities. We have given our god the head of Zeus, and the corn-measure on his
  head is emblematic of the blessing that the husbandman hopes for. The zodiac
  promises us a good star, and the figures representing it are not the common
  emblems, but each deeply significant. The Twins, for instance, are the
  mariner's divinities, Castor and Pollux; Hercules stands by the Lion whom he
  has subdued; and the Fishes are dolphins, which love music. In the Scales,
  one holds the cross high in the air while the other is weighed down by
  Apollo's laurel-wreath and the bolts of Zeus; in short, our standard displays
  everything that is most dear to the soul of a Greek or that fills him with
  devotion. Above all, Nike hovers with the crown of victory. If only fitting
  leaders are to be found at the centres of the movement, these standards will
  at once be sent out, and with them arms for the country-folk. A place of
  meeting has already been selected in each province, the pass-word will be
  given, and a day fixed for a general rising."</p>

  <p>"And they will flock round you!" interrupted Karnis, "and&mdash;I, my son,
  will not be absent. Oh glorious, happy, and triumphant day! Gladly will I die
  if only I may first live to see the smoking offerings sending up their
  fragrance to the gods before the open doors of every temple in Greece; see
  the young men and maidens dancing in rapt enthusiasm to the sound of lutes
  and pipes, and joining their voices in the chorus! Then light will shine once
  more on the world, then life will once more mean joy, and death a departure
  from a scene of bliss."</p>

  <p>"Aye, and thus shall it be!" cried Olympius, fired by this eager
  exposition of his own excitement, and he wrung the musician's hand. "We will
  restore life to the Greeks and teach them to scorn death as of yore. Let the
  Christians, the Barbarians, make life miserable and seek joy in death, if
  they list! But the girls have ceased singing. There is still much to be done
  to-day, and first of all I must confute the objections of your recalcitrant
  pupil."</p>

  <p>"You will not find it an easy task," said Karnis. "Reason is a feeble
  weapon in contending with a woman."</p>

  <p>"Not always," replied the philosopher. "But you must know how to use it.
  Leave me to deal with the child. There are really no singing-women left here;
  we have tried three, but they were all vulgar and ill taught. This girl, when
  she sings with Gorgo, has a voice that will go to the heart of the audience.
  What we want is to fire the crowd with enthusiasm, and she will help us to do
  it."</p>

  <p>"Well, well. But you, Olympius, you who are the very soul of the revulsion
  we hope for, you must not be present at the festival. Indeed, sheltered as
  you are under Porphyrius' roof, there is a price on your head, and this house
  swarms with slaves, who all know you; if one of them, tempted by filthy lucre
  ..."</p>

  <p>"They will not betray me," smiled the philosopher. "They know that their
  aged mistress, Damia, and I myself command the daemons of the upper and lower
  spheres, and that at a sign from her or from me they would instantly perish;
  and even if there were an Ephialtes among them, a spring through that
  loop-hole would save me. Be easy, my friend. Oracles and stars alike foretell
  me death from another cause than the treason of a slave."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Olympius followed Agne into the garden where he found her
  sitting by the marble margin of a small pool, giving her little brother
  pieces of bread to feed the swans with. He greeted her kindly and, taking up
  the child, showed him a ball which rose and fell on the jet of water from the
  fountain. Papias was not at all frightened by the big man with his white
  beard, for a bright and kindly gleam shone in his eyes, and his voice was
  soft and attractive as he asked him whether he had such another ball and
  could toss it as cleverly as the fountain did.</p>

  <p>Papias said: "No," and Olympius, turning to Agne, went on:</p>

  <p>"You should get him a ball. There is no better plaything, for play ought
  to consist in pleasant exertion which is in itself its object and gain. Play
  is the toil of a little child; and a ball, which he can throw and run after
  or catch, trains his eye, gives exercise to his limbs and includes a double
  moral which men of every age and position should act upon: To look down on
  the earth and keep his gaze on the heavens."</p>

  <p>Agne nodded agreement and thanks, while Olympius set the child down and
  bid him run away to the paddock where some tame gazelles were kept. Then,
  going straight to the point, he said:</p>

  <p>"I hear you have declined to sing in the temple of Isis; you have been
  taught to regard the goddess to whom many good men turn in faith and
  confidence, as a monster of iniquity, but, tell me, do you know what she
  embodies?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Agne looking down; but she hastily rose from her seat and
  added with some spirit: "And I do not want to know, for I am a Christian and
  your gods are not mine."</p>

  <p>"Well, well; your beliefs, of course, differ from ours in many points:
  still, I fancy that you and I have much in common. We belong to those who
  have learnt to 'look upwards'&mdash;there goes the ball, up again!&mdash;and
  who find comfort in doing so. Do you know that many men believe that the
  universe was formed by concurrence of mechanical processes and is still
  slowly developing, that there is no divinity whose love and power guard,
  guide and lend grace to the lives of men?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! yes, I have been obliged to hear many such blasphemous things in
  Rome!"</p>

  <p>"And they ran off you like water off the silvery sheen of that swan's
  plumage as he dips and raises his neck. Those who deny a God are, in your
  estimation, foolish or perhaps abominable?"</p>

  <p>"I pity them, with all my heart."</p>

  <p>"And with very good reason. You are an orphan and what its parents are to
  a child the divinity is to every member of the human race. In this Gorgo, and
  I, and many others whom you call heathen, feel exactly as you do; but
  you&mdash;have you ever asked yourself why and how it is that you, to whom
  life has been so bitter, have such a perfect conviction that there is a
  benevolent divinity who rules the world and your own fate to kindly ends?
  Why, in short, do you believe in a God?"</p>

  <p>"I?" said Ague, looking puzzled, but straight into his face. "How could
  anything exist without God? You ask such strange questions. All I can see was
  created by our Father in Heaven."</p>

  <p>"But there are men born blind who nevertheless believe in Him."</p>

  <p>"They feel Him just as I see Him."</p>

  <p>"Nay you should say: 'As I believe that I see and feel Him.' But I, for my
  part, think that the intellect has a right to test what the soul only
  divines, and that it must be a real happiness to see this divination proved
  by well-founded arguments, and thus transformed to certainty. Did you ever
  hear of Plato, the philosopher?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Karnis often speaks of him when he and Orpheus are discussing things
  which I do not understand."</p>

  <p>"Well, Plato, by his intellect, worked out the proof of the problem which
  our feelings alone are so capable of apprehending rightly. Listen to me: If
  you stand on a spit of land at the entrance to a harbor and see a ship in the
  distance sailing towards you&mdash;a ship which carefully avoids the rocks,
  and makes straight for the shelter of the port&mdash;are you not justified in
  concluding that there is, on board that ship, a man who guides and steers it?
  Certainly. You not only may, but must infer that it is directed by a pilot.
  And if you look up at the sky and contemplate the well-ordered courses of the
  stars&mdash;when you see how everything on earth, great and small, obeys
  eternal laws and unerringly tends to certain preordained ends and issues, you
  may and must infer the existence of a ruling hand. Whose then but that of the
  Great Pilot of the universe&mdash;the Almighty Godhead.&mdash;Do you like my
  illustration?"</p>

  <p>"Very much. But it only proves what I knew before."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, you must, I think, be pleased to find it so beautifully
  expressed."</p>

  <p>"Certainly."</p>

  <p>"And must admire the wise man who thought out the comparison.
  Yes?&mdash;Well, that man again was one of those whom you call heathen, who
  believed as we believe, and who at the same time worked out the evidence of
  the foundations of his faith for you as well as himself. And we, the later
  disciples of Plato* have gone even further than our master, and in many
  respects are much nearer to you Christians than you perhaps suspect. You see
  at once, of course, that we are no more inclined than you to conceive of the
  existence of the world and the destiny of man as independent of a God?
  However, I dare say you still think that your divinity and ours are as far
  asunder as the east from the west. But can you tell me where any difference
  lies?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Known as the school of the Neo-Platonists. ]</p>

  <p>"I do not know," said Ague uneasily. "I am only an ignorant girl; and who
  can learn the names even of all your gods?"</p>

  <p>"Very true," said Olympius. "There is great Serapis, whose temple you saw
  yesterday; there is Apollo, to whom Karnis prefers to offer sacrifice; there
  is Isis the bountiful, and her sister Nephthys, whose lament you and my young
  friend sing together so thrillingly; and besides these there are more
  immortals than I could name while Gorgo&mdash;who is leading your little
  brother to the lake out there&mdash;walked ten times from the shore to us and
  back; and yet&mdash;and yet my child, your God is ours and ours is
  yours."</p>

  <p>"No, no, He is not, indeed!" cried Agne with increasing alarm.</p>

  <p>"But listen," Olympius went on, with the same kind urgency but with
  extreme dignity, "and answer my questions simply and honestly. We are agreed,
  are we not?&mdash;that we perceive the divinity in the works of his creation,
  and even in his workings in our own souls. Then which are the phenomena of
  nature in which you discern Him as especially near to you? You are silent. I
  see, you have outlived your school-days and do not choose to answer to an
  uninvited catechism. And yet the things I wish you to name are lovely in
  themselves and dear to your heart; and if only you did not keep your soft
  lips so firmly closed, but would give me the answer I ask for, you would
  remember much that is grand and beautiful. You would speak of the pale light
  of dawn, the tender flush that tinges the clouds as the glowing day-star
  rises from the waves, of the splendor of the sun-as glorious as truth and as
  warm as divine love. You would say: In the myriad blossoms that open to the
  morning, in the dew that bathes them and covers them with diamonds, in the
  ripening ears in the field, in the swelling fruit on the trees&mdash;in all
  these I see the mercy and wisdom of the divinity. I feel his infinite
  greatness as I gaze on the wide expanse of deep blue sea; it comes home to me
  at night when I lift my eyes to the skies and see the sparkling hosts of
  stars roll over my head. Who created that countless multitude, who guides
  them so that they glide past in glorious harmony, and rise and set,
  accurately timed to minutes and seconds, silent but full of meaning,
  immeasurably distant and yet closely linked with the fate of individual
  men?&mdash;All this bears witness to the existence of a God, and as you
  contemplate it and admire it with thankful emotion, you feel yourself drawn
  near to the Omnipotent. Aye, and even if you were deaf and blind, and lay
  bound and fettered in the gloom of a closely-shut cavern, you still could
  feel if love and pity and hope touched your heart. Rejoice then, child! for
  the immortals have endowed you with good gifts, and granted you sound senses
  by which to enjoy the beauty of creation. You exercise an art which binds you
  to the divinity like a bridge; when you give utterance to your whole soul in
  song that divinity itself speaks through you, and when you hear noble music
  its voice appeals to your ear. All round you and within you, you can
  recognize its power just as we feel it&mdash;everywhere and at all times.</p>

  <p>"And this incomprehensible, infinite, unfettered, bountiful and infallibly
  wise Power, which penetrates and permeates the life of the universe as it
  does the hearts of men, though called by different names in different lands,
  is the same to every race, wherever it may dwell, whatever its language or
  its beliefs. You Christians call him the Heavenly Father, we give him the
  name of the Primal One. To you, too, your God speaks in the surging seas, the
  waving corn, the pure light of day; you, too, regard music which enchants
  your heart, and love which draws man to man, as his gifts; and we go only a
  step further, giving a special name to each phenomenon of nature, and each
  lofty emotion of the soul in which we recognize the direct influence of the
  Most High; calling the sea Poseidon, the corn-field Demeter, the charm of
  music Apollo, and the rapture of love Eros. When you see us offering
  sacrifice at the foot of a marble image you must not suppose that the
  lifeless, perishable stone is the object of our adoration. The god does not
  descend to inform the statue; but the statue is made after the Idea figured
  forth by the divinity it is intended to represent; and through that Idea the
  image is as intimately connected with the Godhead, as, by the bond of Soul,
  everything else that is manifest to our senses is connected with the
  phenomena of the supersensuous World. But this is beyond you; it will be
  enough for you if I assure you that the statue of Demeter, with the sheaf in
  her arms, is only intended to remind us to be grateful to the Divinity for
  our daily bread&mdash;a hymn of praise to Apollo expresses our thanks to the
  Primal One for the wings of music and song, on which our soul is borne
  upwards till it feels the very presence of the Most High. These are names,
  mere names that divide us; but if you were called anything else than
  Agne&mdash;Ismene, for instance, or Eudoxia&mdash;would you be at all
  different from what you are?&mdash;There you see&mdash;no, stay where you
  are&mdash;you must listen while I tell you that Isis, the much&mdash;maligned
  Isis, is nothing and represents nothing but the kindly influences of the
  Divinity, on nature and on human life. What she embodies to us is the
  abstraction which you call the loving-kindness of the Father, revealed in his
  manifold gifts, wherever we turn our eyes. The image of Isis reminds us of
  the lavish bounties of the Creator, just as you are reminded by the cross,
  the fish, and the lamb, of your Redeemer. Isis is the earth from whose
  maternal bosom the creative God brings forth food and comfort for man and
  beast; she is the tender yearning which He implants in the hearts of the
  lover and the beloved one; she is the bond of affection which unites husband
  and wife, brother and sister, which is rapture to the mother with a child at
  her breast and makes her ready and able for any sacrifice for the darling she
  has brought into the world. She shines, a star in the midnight sky, giving
  comfort to the sorrowing heart; she, who has languished in grief, pours balm
  into the wounded souls of the desolate and bereaved, and gives health and
  refreshment to the suffering. When nature pines in winter cold or in summer
  drought and lacks power to revive, when the sun is darkened, when lies and
  evil instincts alienate the soul from its pure first cause, then Isis uplifts
  her complaint, calling on her husband, Osiris, to return, to take her once
  more in his arms and fill her with new powers, to show the benevolence of God
  once more to the earth and to us men. You have learnt that lament; and when
  you sing it at her festival, picture yourself as standing with the Mother of
  Sorrows&mdash;the mother of your crucified divinity, by his open grave, and
  cry to your God that he may let him rise from the dead."</p>

  <p>Olympius spoke the last words with excited enthusiasm as though he were
  certain of the young girl's consent; but the effect was not what he counted
  on; for Agne, who had listened to him, so far, with increasing agitation,
  setting herself against his arguments like a bird under the fascinating glare
  of the snake's eye, at this last address seemed suddenly to shake off the
  spell of his seductive eloquence as the leaves drop from the crown of a tree
  shaken by the blast; the ideas of her Saviour and of the hymn she was to sing
  were utterly irreconcilable in her mind; she remembered the struggle she had
  fought out during the night, and the determination with which she had come to
  the house this morning. All the insidious language she had just heard was
  forgotten, swept away like dust from a rocky path, and her voice was firmly
  repellent as she said:</p>

  <p>"Your Isis has nothing in common with the Mother of our God, and how can
  you dare to compare your Osiris with the Lord who redeemed the world from
  death?"</p>

  <p>Olympius, startled at the decision of her tone, rose from his seat, but he
  went on, as though he had expected this refusal:</p>

  <p>"I will tell you&mdash;I will show you. Osiris&mdash;we will take him as
  being an Egyptian god, instead of Serapis in whose mysterious attributes you
  would find much to commend itself even to a Christian soul&mdash;Osiris, like
  your Master, voluntarily passed through death&mdash;to redeem the world from
  death&mdash;in this resembling your Christ. He, the Risen One, gives new
  light, and life, and blossom, and verdure to all that is darkened, dead and
  withered. All that seems to have fallen a prey to death is, by him, restored
  to a more beautiful existence; he, who has risen again, can bring even the
  departed soul to a resurrection; and when during this life its high aims have
  kept it unspotted by the dust of the sensual life, and he, as the judge, sees
  that it has preserved itself worthy of its pure First Cause, he allows it to
  return to the eternal and supreme Spirit whence it originally proceeded.</p>

  <p>"And do not you, too, strive after purification, to the end that your soul
  may find an everlasting home in the radiant realms? Again and again do we
  meet with the same ideas, only they bear different forms and names. Try to
  feel the true bearing of my words, and then you will gladly join in the
  pathetic appeal to the sublime god to return. How like he is to your Lord! Is
  he not, like your Christ, a Saviour, and risen from the dead? The Temple or
  the Church&mdash;both are the sanctuaries of the Deity. By the ivy-wreathed
  altar of the weeping goddess, at the foot of the tall cypresses which cast
  their mysterious shadows on the snowy whiteness of the marble steps on which
  lies the bier of the god, you will feel the sacred awe which falls upon every
  pure soul when it is conscious of the presence of the Deity&mdash;call Him
  what you will.</p>

  <p>"Isis, whom you now know, and who is neither more nor less than a
  personification of divine mercy, will make you a return by restoring you to
  the freedom for which you pine. She will allow you to find a home in some
  Christian house through our intervention, in acknowledgment of the pious
  service you are rendering, not to her but to the faith in divine goodness.
  There you may live with your little brother, as free as heart can desire.
  To-morrow you will go with Gorgo to the temple of the goddess ..."</p>

  <p>But Agne broke in on his speech: "No, I will not go with her!"</p>

  <p>Her cheeks were scarlet and her breath came short and fast with excitement
  as she went on:</p>

  <p>"I will not, I must not, I cannot! Do what you will with me: sell me and
  my brother, put us to turn a mill&mdash;but I will not sing in the
  temple!"</p>

  <p>Olympius knit his brows; his beard quivered and his lips parted in wrath,
  but he controlled himself and going close to the girl he laid his hand on her
  shoulder and said in a deep grave tone of fatherly admonition:</p>

  <p>"Reflect, child, pause; think over what I have been saying to you;
  remember, too, what you owe the little one you love, and to-morrow morning
  tell us that you have duly weighed your answer. Give me your hand, my
  daughter; believe me, Olympius is one of your sincerest well-wishers."</p>

  <p>He turned his back on her and was going in doors. In front of the house
  Porphyrius and Karnis were standing in eager colloquy. The news that Marcus'
  mother Mary had sent for Herse had reached the singer, and his vivid fancy
  painted his wife as surrounded by a thousand perils, threatened by the widow,
  and carried before the judges. The merchant advised him to wait and see what
  came of it, as did Damia and Gorgo who were attracted to the spot by the
  vehemence of the discussion; but Karnis would not be detained, and he and
  Orpheus hurried off to the rescue. Thus Agne was left alone in the garden
  with her little brother, and perceiving that no one paid any further
  attention to their proceedings, she fell on her knees, clasped the child
  closely to her and whispered:</p>

  <p>"Pray with me, Papias; pray, pray that the Lord will protect us, and that
  we may not be turned out of the way that leads us to our parents! Pray, as I
  do!"</p>

  <p>For a minute she remained prostrate with the child by her side. Then,
  rising quickly, she took him by the hand and led him in almost breathless
  haste through the garden-gate out into the road, bending her steps towards
  the lake and then down the first turning that led to the city.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Agne's flight remained unperceived for some little time, for
  every member of the merchant's household was at the moment intent on some
  personal interest. When Karnis and Orpheus had set out Gorgo was left with
  her grandmother and it was not till some little time after that she went out
  into the colonnade on the garden side of the house, whence she had a view
  over the park and the shore as far as the ship-yard. There, leaning against
  the shaft of a pillar, under the shade of the blossoming shrubs, she stood
  gazing thoughtfully to the southward.</p>

  <p>She was dreaming of the past, of her childhood's joys and privations. Fate
  had bereft her of a mother's love, that sun of life's spring. Below her, in a
  splendid mausoleum of purple porphyry, lay the mortal remains of the
  beautiful woman who had given her birth, and who had been snatched away
  before she could give her infant a first caress. But all round the solemn
  monument gardens bloomed in the sunshine, and on the further side of the wall
  covered with creepers, was the ship-yard, the scene of numberless delightful
  games. She sighed as she looked at the tall hulks, and watched for the man
  who, from her earliest girlhood, had owned her heart, whose image was
  inseparable from every thing of joy and beauty that she had ever known, and
  every grief her young soul had suffered under.</p>

  <p>Constantine, the younger son of Clemens the shipbuilder, had been her
  brothers' companion and closest friend. He had proved himself their superior
  in talents and gifts, and in all their games had been the recognized leader.
  While still a tiny thing she would always be at their heels, and Constantine
  had never failed to be patient with her, or to help and protect her, and then
  came a time when the lads were all eager to win her sympathy for their games
  and undertakings. When her grandmother read in the stars that some evil
  influences were to cross the path of Gorgo's planet, the girl was carefully
  kept in the house; at other times she was free to go with the boys in the
  garden, on the lake or to the ship-yard. There the happy playmates built
  houses or boats; there, in a separate room, old Melampus modelled
  figure-heads for the finished vessels, and he would supply them with clay and
  let them model too. Constantine was an apt pupil, and Gorgo would sit quiet
  while he took her likeness, till, out of twenty images that he had made of
  her, several were really very like. Melampus declared that his young master
  might be a very distinguished sculptor if only he were the son of poor
  parents, and Gorgo's father appreciated his talent and was pleased when the
  boy attempted to copy the beautiful busts and statues of which the house was
  full; but to his parents, and especially his mother, his artistic
  proclivities were an offence. He himself, indeed, never seriously thought of
  devoting himself to such a heathenish occupation, for he was deeply
  penetrated by the Christian sentiments of his family, and he had even
  succeeded in inflaming the sons of Porphyrius, who had been baptized at an
  early age, with zeal for their faith. The merchant perceived this and
  submitted in silence, for the boys must be and remain Christians in
  consequence of the edict referring to wills; but the necessity for confessing
  a creed which was hateful to him was so painful and repulsive to a nature
  which, though naturally magnanimous was not very steadfast, that he was
  anxious to spare his sons the same experience, and allowed them to accompany
  Constantine to church and to wear blue&mdash;the badge of the
  Christians&mdash;at races and public games, with a shrug of silent
  consent.</p>

  <p>With Gorgo it was different. She was a woman and need wear no colors; and
  her enthusiasm for the old gods and Greek taste and prejudices were the
  delight of her father. She was the pride of his life, and as he heard his own
  convictions echoed in her childish prattle, and later in her conversation and
  exquisite singing, he was grateful to his mother and to his friend Olympius
  who had implanted and cherished these feelings in his daughter. Constantine's
  endeavors to show her the beauty of his creed and to win her to Christianity
  were entirely futile; and the older they grew, and the less they agreed, the
  worse could each endure the dissent of the other.</p>

  <p>An early and passionate affection attracted the young man to his charming
  playfellow; the more ardently he cherished his faith the more fervently did
  he desire to win her for his wife. But Olympius' fair pupil was not easy of
  conquest; nay, he was not unfrequently hard beset by her questions and
  arguments, and while, to her, the fight for a creed was no more than an
  amusing wrestling match, in which to display her strength, to him it was a
  matter in which his heart was engaged.</p>

  <p>Damia and Porphyrius took a vain pleasure in their eager discussions, and
  clapped with delight, as though it were a game of skill, when Gorgo
  laughingly checkmated her excited opponent with some unanswerable
  argument.</p>

  <p>But there came a day when Constantine discovered that his eager defence of
  that which to him was high and holy, was, to his hearers, no more than a
  subject of mockery, and henceforth the lad, now fast growing to manhood, kept
  away from the merchant's house. Still, Gorgo could always win him back again,
  and sometimes, when they were alone together, the old strife would be
  renewed, and more seriously and bitterly than of old. But while he loved her,
  she also loved him, and when he had so far mastered himself as to remain away
  for any length of time she wore herself out with longing to see him. They
  felt that they belonged to each other, but they also felt that an insuperable
  gulf yawned between them, and that whenever they attempted to clasp hands
  across the abyss a mysterious and irresistible impulse drove them to open it
  wider, and to dig it deeper by fresh discussions, till at last Constantine
  could not endure that she, of all people, should mock at his Holy of Holies
  and drag it in the dust.</p>

  <p>He must go&mdash;he must leave Gorgo, quit Alexandria, cost what it might.
  The travellers' tales that he had heard from the captains of trading-vessels
  and ships of war who frequented his father's house had filled him with a love
  of danger and enterprise, and a desire to see distant lands and foreign
  peoples. His father's business, for which he was intended, did not attract
  him. Away&mdash;away&mdash;he would go away; and a happy coincidence opened a
  path for him.</p>

  <p>Porphyrius had taken him one day on some errand to Canopus; the elder man
  had gone in his chariot, his two sons and Constantine escorting him on
  horseback. At the city-gates they met Romanus, the general in command of the
  Imperial army, with his staff of officers, and he, drawing rein by the great
  merchant's carriage, had asked him, pointing to Constantine, whether that
  were his son.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Porphyrius, "but I wish he were." At these words the ship-
  master's son colored deeply, while Romanus turned his horse round, laid his
  hand on the young man's arm and called out to the commander of the cavalry of
  Arsinoe: "A soldier after Ares' own heart, Columella! Do not let him
  slip."</p>

  <p>Before the clouds of dust raised by the officers' horses as they rode off,
  had fairly settled, Constantine had made up his mind to be a soldier. In his
  parents' house, however, this decision was seen under various aspects. His
  father found little to say against it, for he had three sons and only two
  shipyards, and the question seemed settled by the fact that Constantine, with
  his resolute and powerful nature, was cut out to be a soldier. His pious
  mother, on the other hand, appealed to the learned works of Clemens and
  Tertullian, who forbid the faithful Christian to draw the sword; and she
  related the legend of the holy Maximilianus, who, being compelled, under
  Diocletian, to join the army, had suffered death at the hands of the
  executioner rather than shed his fellow-creatures' blood in battle. The use
  of weapons, she added, was incompatible with a godly and Christian life.</p>

  <p>His father, however, would not listen to this reasoning; new times, he
  said, were come; the greater part of the army had been baptized; the Church
  prayed for, victory, and at the head of the troops stood the great
  Theodosius, an exemplar of an orthodox and zealous Christian.</p>

  <p>Clemens was master in his own house, and Constantine joined the heavy
  cavalry at Arsinoe. In the war against the Blemmyes he was so fortunate as to
  merit the highest distinction; after that he was in garrison at Arsinoe, and,
  as Alexandria was within easy reach of that town, he was in frequent
  intercourse with his own family and that of Porphyrius. Not quite three years
  previously, when a revolt had broken out in favor of the usurper Maximus in
  his native town, Constantine had assisted in suppressing it, and almost
  immediately afterwards he was sent to Europe to take part in the war which
  Theodosius had begun, again against Maximus.</p>

  <p>An unpleasant misunderstanding had embittered his parting from Gorgo; old
  Damia, as she held his hand had volunteered a promise that she and her
  granddaughter would from time to time slay a beast in sacrifice on his
  behalf. Perhaps she had had no spiteful meaning in this, but he had regarded
  it as an insult, and had turned away angry and hurt. Gorgo, however, could
  not bear to let him go thus; disregarding her grandmother's look of surprise,
  she had called him back, and giving him both hands had warmly bidden him
  farewell. Damia had looked after him in silence and had ever afterwards
  avoided mentioning his name in Gorgo's presence.</p>

  <p>After the victory over Maximus, Constantine, though still very young, was
  promoted to the command of the troop in the place of Columella, and he had
  arrived in Alexandria the day before at the head of his 'ala miliaria'.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The ala miliaria consisted of 24 'turmae' or 960
  mounted troopers under the conduct of a Prefect. ]</p>

  <p>Gorgo had never at any time ceased to think of him, but her passion had
  constantly appeared to her in the light of treason and a breach of faith
  towards the gods, so, to condone the sins she committed on one side by zeal
  on another, she had come forth from the privacy of her father's house to give
  active support to Olympius in his struggle for the faith of their ancestors.
  She had become a daily worshipper at the temple of Isis, and the hope of
  hearing her sing had already mere than once filled it to overflowing at high
  festivals. Then, while Olympius was defending the sanctuary of Serapis
  against the attacks of the Christians, she and her grandmother had become the
  leaders of a party of women who made it their task to provide the champions
  of the faith with the means of subsistence.</p>

  <p>All this had given purpose to her life; still, every little victory in
  this contest had filled her soul with regrets and anxieties. For months and
  years she had been conspicuous as the opponent of her lover's creed, and the
  bright eager child had developed into a grave girl a clear-headed and
  resolute woman. She was the only person in the house who dared to contradict
  her grandmother, and to insist on a thing when she thought it right. The
  longing of her heart she could not still, but her high spirit found food for
  its needs in all that surrounded her, and, by degrees, would no doubt have
  gained the mastery and have been supreme in all her being and doing, but that
  music and song still fostered the softer emotions of her strong, womanly
  nature.</p>

  <p>The news of Constantine's return had shaken her soul to the foundations.
  Would it bring her the greatest happiness or only fresh anguish and
  unrest?</p>

  <p>She saw him coming!&mdash;The plume of his helmet first came in sight
  above the bushes, and then his whole figure emerged from among the shrubbery.
  She leaned against the pillar for support now, for her knees trembled under
  her. Tall and stately, his armor blazing in the sunshine, he came straight
  towards her&mdash;a man, a hero&mdash;exactly as her fancy had painted him in
  many a dark and sleepless hour. As he passed her mother's tomb, she felt as
  though a cold hand laid a grip on her beating heart. In a swift flash of
  thought she saw her own home with its wealth and splendor, and then the ship-
  builder's house-simple, chillingly bare, with its comfortless rooms; she felt
  as though she must perish, nipped and withered, in such a home. Again she
  thought of him standing on his father's threshold, she fancied she could hear
  his bright boyish laugh and her heart glowed once more. She forgot for the
  moment&mdash;clear-headed woman though she was, and trained by her
  philosopher to "know herself"&mdash;she forgot what she had fully
  acknowledged only the night before: That he would no more give up his Christ
  than she would her Isis, and that if they should ever reach the dreamed-of
  pinnacle of joy it must be for an instant only, followed by a weary length of
  misery. Yes&mdash;she forgot everything; doubts and fears were cast aside; as
  his approaching footsteps fell on her ear, she could hardly keep herself from
  flying, open armed, to meet him.</p>

  <p>He was standing before her; she offered him her hand with frank gladness,
  and, as he clasped it in his, their hearts were too full for words. Only
  their eyes gave utterance to their feelings, and when he perceived that hers
  were sparkling through tears, he spoke her name once, twice&mdash;joyfully
  and yet doubtfully, as if he dared not interpret her emotion as he would. She
  laid her left hand lightly on his which still grasped her right, and said
  with a brilliant smile: "Welcome, Constantine, welcome home! How glad I am to
  see you back again!"</p>

  <p>"And I&mdash;and I ... "he began, greatly moved.</p>

  <p>"O Gorgo! Can it really be years since we parted?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed," she said. "Anxious, busy, struggling years!"</p>

  <p>"But to-day we celebrate the festival of Peace," he exclaimed fervently.
  "I have learnt to leave every man to go his own way so long as I am allowed
  to go mine. The old strife is buried; take me as I am and I, for my part,
  will think only of the noble and beautiful traits in which your nature is so
  rich. The fruit of all wholesome strife must be peace; let us pluck that
  fruit, Gorgo, and enjoy it together. Ah! as I stand here and gaze out over
  the gardens and the lake, hearing the hammers of the shipwrights, and
  rejoicing in your presence, I feel as though our childhood might begin all
  over again&mdash;only better, fuller and more beautiful!"</p>

  <p>"If only my brothers were here!"</p>

  <p>"I saw them."</p>

  <p>"Oh! where?"</p>

  <p>"At Thessalonica, well and happy&mdash;I have letters for you from
  them."</p>

  <p>"Letters!" cried Gorgo, drawing away her hand. "Well, you are a tardy
  messenger! Our houses are within a stone's throw, and yet in a whole day,
  from noon till noon, so old a friend could not find a few minutes to deliver
  the letters entrusted to him, or to call upon such near neighbors ..."</p>

  <p>"First there were my parents," interrupted the young soldier. "And then
  the tyrant military duty, which kept me on the stretch from yesterday
  afternoon till an hour or two since. Romanus robbed me even of my sleep, and
  kept me in attendance till the morn had set. However, I lost but little by
  that, for I could not have closed my eyes till they had beheld you! This
  morning again I was on duty, and rarely have I ridden to the front with such
  reluctance. After that I was delayed by various details; even on my way
  here&mdash;but for that I cannot be sorry for it gave me this chance of
  finding you alone. All I ask now is that we may remain so, for such a moment
  is not likely to be repeated.&mdash;There, I heard a door... "</p>

  <p>"Come into the garden," cried Gorgo, signing to him to follow her. "My
  heart is as full as yours. Down by the tank under the old sycamores&mdash;we
  shall be quietest there."</p>

  <p>Under the dense shade of the centenarian trees was a rough-hewn bench that
  they themselves had made years before; there Gorgo seated herself, but her
  companion remained standing.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" he exclaimed. "Here&mdash;here you must hear me! Here where we have
  been so happy together!"</p>

  <p>"So happy!" she echoed softly,</p>

  <p>"And now," he went on, "we are together once more. My heart beats wildly,
  Gorgo; it is well that this breastplate holds it fast, for I feel as though
  it would burst with hope and thankfulness."</p>

  <p>"Thankfulness?" said Gorgo, looking down.</p>

  <p>"Yes, thankfulness&mdash;sheer, fervent passionate gratitude! What you
  have given me, what an inestimable boon, you yourself hardly know; but no
  emperor could reward love and fidelity more lavishly than you have
  done&mdash;you, the care and the consolation, the pain and the joy of my
  life! My mother told me&mdash;it was the first thing she thought of&mdash;how
  you shed tears of grief on her bosom when the false report of my death
  reached home. Those tears fell as morning dew on the drooping hopes in my
  heart, they were a welcome such as few travellers find on their return home.
  I am no orator, and if I were, how could speech in any way express my
  feelings? But you know them&mdash;you understand what it is, after so many
  years ..."</p>

  <p>"I know," she said looking up into his eyes, and allowing him to seize her
  hand as he dropped on the bench by her side. "If I did not I could not bear
  this&mdash;and I freely confess that I shed many more tears over you than you
  could imagine. You love me, Constantine ..."</p>

  <p>He threw his arm round her; but she disengaged herself, exclaiming:</p>

  <p>"Nay&mdash;I implore you, not so&mdash;not yet, till I have told you what
  troubles me, what keeps me from throwing myself wholly, freely into the arms
  of happiness. I know what you will ask&mdash;what you have a right to ask;
  but before you speak, Constantine, remember once more all that has so often
  saddened our life, even as children, that has torn us asunder like a
  whirlwind although, ever since we can remember, our hearts have flowed
  towards each other. But I need not remind you of what binds us&mdash;that we
  both know well, only too well..."</p>

  <p>"Nay," he replied boldly: "That we are only beginning to know in all its
  fullness and rapture. The other thing the whirlwind of which you speak, has
  indeed tossed and tormented me, more than it has you perhaps; but since I
  have known that you could shed tears for me and love me I have had no more
  anxieties; I know for certain that all must come right! You love me as I am,
  Gorgo. I am no dreamer nor poet; but I can look forward to finding life
  lovely and noble if shared with you, so long as one&mdash;only one thing is
  sure. I ask you plainly and truly: Is your heart as full of love for me as
  mine is for you? When I was away did you think of me every day, every night,
  as I thought of you, day and night without fail?"</p>

  <p>Gorgo's head sank and blushes dyed her cheeks as she replied: "I love you,
  and I have never even thought of any one else. My thoughts and yearnings
  followed you all the while you were away ... and yet ... oh, Constantine!
  That one thing ..."</p>

  <p>"It cannot part us," said the young man passionately, "since we have
  love&mdash;the mighty and gracious power which conquers all things! When love
  beckon: the whirlwind dies away like the breath from a child's lips; it can
  bridge over any abyss; it created the world and preserves the existence of
  humanity, it can remove mountains&mdash;and these are the most beautiful
  words of the greatest of the apostles: 'It is long suffering and kind, it
  believes all things, hopes all things' and it knows no end. It remains with
  us till death and will teach us to find that peace whose bulwark and
  adornment, whose child and parent it is!"</p>

  <p>Gorgo had looked lovingly at him while he spoke, and he, pressing her hand
  to his lips went on with ardent feeling:</p>

  <p>"Yes, you shall be mine&mdash;I dare, and I will go to ask you of your
  father. There are some words spoken in one's life which can never be
  forgotten. Once your father said that he wished that I was his son. On the
  march, in camp, in battle, wherever I have wandered, those words have been in
  my mind; for me they could have but one meaning: I would be his son&mdash;I
  shall be his son when Gorgo is my wife!&mdash;And now the time has come
  ..."</p>

  <p>"Not yet, not to-day," she interrupted eagerly. "My hopes are the same as
  yours. I believe with you that our love can bring all that is sweetest into
  our lives. What you believe I must believe, and I will never urge upon you
  the things that I regard as holiest. I can give up much, bear much, and it
  will all seem easy for your sake. We can agree, and settle what shall be
  conceded to your Christ and what to our gods&mdash;but not to-day; not even
  to-morrow. For the present let me first carry out the task I have
  undertaken&mdash;when that is done and past, then... You have my heart, my
  love; but if I were to prove a deserter from the cause to-day or to-morrow it
  would give others&mdash;Olympius&mdash;a right to point at me with
  scorn."</p>

  <p>"What is it then that you have undertaken?" asked Constantine with grave
  anxiety.</p>

  <p>"To crown and close my past life. Before I can say: I am yours, wholly
  yours ..."</p>

  <p>"Are you not mine now, to-day, at once?" he urged.</p>

  <p>"To day-no," she replied firmly. "The great cause still has a claim upon
  me; the cause which I must renounce for your sake. But the woman who gives
  only one person reason to despise her signs the death-warrant of her own
  dignity. I will carry out what I have undertaken... Do not ask me what it is;
  it would grieve you to know.&mdash;The day after tomorrow, when the feast of
  Isis is over..."</p>

  <p>"Gorgo, Gorgo!" shouted Damia's shrill voice, interrupting the young girl
  in her speech, and half a dozen slave-women came rushing out in search of
  her.</p>

  <p>They rose, and as they went towards the house Constantine said very
  earnestly:</p>

  <p>"I will not insist; but trust my experience: When we have to give
  something up sooner or later, if the wrench is a painful one, the sooner and
  the more definitely it is done the better. Nothing is gained by postponement
  and the pain is only prolonged. Hesitation and delay, Gorgo, are a barrier
  built up by your own hand between us and our happiness. You always had
  abundance of determination; be brave then, now, and cut short at once a state
  of things that cannot last."</p>

  <p>"Well, well," she said hurriedly. "But you must not, you will not require
  me to do anything that is beyond my strength, or that would involve breaking
  my word. To-morrow is not, and cannot be yours; it must be a day of
  leave-taking and parting. After that I am yours, I cannot live without you. I
  want you and nothing else. Your happiness shall be mine; only, do not make it
  too hard to me to part from all that has been dear to me from my infancy.
  Shut your eyes to tomorrow's proceedings, and then&mdash;oh! if only we were
  sure of the right path, if only we could tread it together! We know each
  other so perfectly, and I know, I feel, that it will perhaps be a comfort to
  our hearts to be patient with each other over matters which our judgment
  fails to comprehend or even to approve. I might be so unutterably happy; but
  my heart trembles within me, and I am not, I dare not be quite glad yet."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The young soldier was heartily welcomed by his friends of
  the merchant's family; but old Damia was a little uneasy at the attitude
  which he and Gorgo had taken up after their first greeting. He was agitated
  and grave, she was eager and excited, with an air of determined
  enterprise.</p>

  <p>Was Eros at the bottom of it all? Were the young people going to carry out
  the jest of their childhood in sober earnest? The young officer was handsome
  and attractive enough, and her granddaughter after all was but a woman.</p>

  <p>So far as Constantine was concerned the old lady had no personal objection
  to him; nay, she appreciated his steady, grave manliness and, for his own
  sake, was very glad to see him once more; but to contemplate the ship-
  builder's son&mdash;the grandson of a freedman&mdash;a Christian and devoted
  to the Emperor, even though he were a prefect or of even higher
  grade&mdash;as a possible suitor for her Gorgo, the beautiful heiress of the
  greater part of her wealth&mdash;the centre of attraction to all the gilded
  youth of Alexandria&mdash;this was too much for her philosophy; and, as she
  had never in her life restrained the expression of her sentiments, though she
  gave him a friendly hand and the usual greeting, she very soon showed him, by
  her irony and impertinence, that she was as hostile to his creed as ever.</p>

  <p>She put her word in on every subject, and when, presently,
  Demetrius&mdash;who, after Dada's rebuff, had come on to see his
  uncle&mdash;began speaking of the horses he had been breeding for Marcus, and
  Constantine enquired whether any Arabs from his stables were to be purchased
  in the town, Damia broke out:</p>

  <p>"You out-do your crucified God in most things I observe! He could ride on
  an ass, and a stout Egyptian nag is not good enough for you."</p>

  <p>However, the young officer was not to be provoked; and though he was very
  well able to hold his own in a strife of words, he kept himself under control
  and pretended to see nothing in the old woman's taunts but harmless
  jesting.</p>

  <p>Gorgo triumphed in his temperate demeanor, and thanked him with grateful
  glances and a silent grasp of the hand when opportunity offered.</p>

  <p>Demetrius, who had also known Constantine as a boy, and who, through
  Porphyrius, had sold him his first charger, met him very warmly and told him
  with a laugh that he had seen him before that day, that he had evidently
  learnt something on his travels, that he had tracked the prettiest head of
  game in all the city; and he slapped him on the shoulder and gave him what he
  meant to be a very knowing glance. Constantine could not think where
  Demetrius had seen him or what he meant; while Gorgo supposed that he alluded
  to her, and thought him perfectly odious.</p>

  <p>Porphyrius pelted the prefect with questions which Constantine was very
  ready to answer, till they were interrupted by some commotion in the garden.
  On looking out they saw a strange and unpleasing procession, headed by Herse
  who was scolding, thumping and dragging Dada's Egyptian slave, while her
  husband followed, imploring her to moderate her fury. Behind them came
  Orpheus, now and then throwing out a persuasive word to soothe the indignant
  matron. This party soon came up with the others, and Herse, unasked, poured
  out an explanation of her wrath.</p>

  <p>She had had but a brief interview with Mary, Marcus' mother, for she had
  positively opposed the Christian lady's suggestion that Karnis and his family
  would do well to quit Alexandria as soon as possible, accepting an
  indemnification from Mary herself. To the widow's threats of seeking the
  intervention of the law, she had retorted that they were not public singers
  but free citizens who performed for their own enjoyment; to the anxious
  mother's complaints that Dada was doing all she could to attract Marcus, she
  had answered promptly and to the point that her niece's good name would
  certainly out-weigh anything that could be said against a young man to whom
  so much license was allowed in Alexandria. She would find some means of
  protecting her own sister's child. Mary had replied that Herse would do well
  to remember that she&mdash;Mary&mdash;had means at her command of bringing
  justice down on those who should attempt to entrap a Christian youth, and
  tempt him into the path of sin.</p>

  <p>This had closed the interview. Herse had found her husband and son waiting
  for her at the door of Mary's house and had at once returned with them to the
  ship. There an unpleasant surprise awaited them; they had found no one on
  board but the Egyptian slave, who told them that Dada had sent her on shore
  to procure her some sandals; on her return the girl had vanished. The woman
  at the same time declared that she had seen Agne and her brother leave the
  garden and make for the high-road.</p>

  <p>So far as the Christian girl was concerned Herse declared there would be
  no difficulty; but Dada, her own niece, had always clung to them faithfully,
  and though Alexandria was full of sorcerers and Magians they could hardly
  succeed in making away with a fullgrown, rational, and healthy girl. In her
  inexperience she had, no doubt, gone at the bidding of some perfidious
  wretch, and the Egyptian witch, the brown slave had, of course, had a finger
  in the trick. She would accuse no one, but she knew some people who would be
  only too glad if Dada and that baby-faced young Christian got into trouble
  and disgrace together. She delivered herself of this long story with tears of
  rage and regret, angrily refusing to admit any qualifying parentheses from
  her husband, to whose natural delicacy her rough and vociferous complaints
  were offensive in the presence of the high-bred ladies of the house. Old
  Damia, however, had listened attentively to her indignant torrent of words,
  and had only shrugged her shoulders with a scornful smile at the implied
  accusation of herself.</p>

  <p>Porphyrius, to whom the whole business was simply revolting, questioned
  Herse closely and when the facts were clearly established, and it also was
  plainly proved that Agne had escaped from the garden, he desired the slave-
  woman to tell her story of all that had occurred during the absence of
  Karnis, promising her half a dozen stripes from the cane on the soles of her
  feet for every false word she might utter. The threat was enough to raise a
  howl from the Egyptian; but this Porphyries soon put a stop to, and
  Sachepris, with perfect veracity, told her tale of all that had happened till
  Herse's return to the vessel. The beginning of the narrative was of no
  special interest, but when she was pressed to go faster to the point she went
  on to say:</p>

  <p>"And then&mdash;then my lord Constantine came to us on the ship, and the
  pretty mistress laughed with him and asked him to take off his helmet,
  because the pretty mistress wanted to see the cut, the great sword-cut above
  his eyes, and my lord Constantine took it off."</p>

  <p>"It is a lie!" exclaimed Gorgo.</p>

  <p>"No, no; it is true. Sachepris does not want her feet flayed, mistress,"
  cried the slave. "Ask my lord Constantine himself."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I went on board," said Constantine. "Just as I was crossing the
  ship-yard a young girl dropped her fan into the lake. I fished it out at her
  request, and carried it back to her."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that was it," cried Sachepris. "And the pretty mistress laughed with
  my lord Constantine&mdash;is it not true?&mdash;and she took his helmet out
  of his hand and weighed it in hers ..."</p>

  <p>"And you could stop on your way here to trifle with that child?" cried
  Gorgo wrathfully. "Pah! what men will do!"</p>

  <p>These words portended rage and intense disgust to Constantine. "Gorgo!" he
  cried with a reproachful accent, but she could not control her indignation
  and went on more vehemently than ever:</p>

  <p>"You stopped&mdash;with that little hussy&mdash;on your way to
  me&mdash;stopped to trifle and flirt with her! Shame! Yes, I say shame! Men
  are thought lucky in being light-hearted, but, for my part, may the gods
  preserve me from such luck! Trifling, whispering, caressing&mdash;a tender
  squeeze of the hand&mdash;solemnly, passionately earnest!&mdash;And what
  next? Who dares warrant that it will not all be repeated before the shadows
  are an ell long on the shore!"</p>

  <p>She laughed, a sharp, bitter laugh; but it was a short one. She ceased and
  turned pale, for her lover's face had undergone a change that terrified her.
  The scar on his forehead was purple, and his voice was strange, harsh and
  hoarse as he leaned forward to bring his face on a level with hers, and
  said:</p>

  <p>"Even if you had seen me with your own eyes you ought not to have believed
  them! And if you dare to say that you do believe it, I can say Shame! as well
  as you. My life may be at stake but I say: Shame!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke he clutched the back of a chair with convulsive fury and stood
  facing the girl like an avenging god of war, his eyes flashing to meet hers.
  This was too much for old Damia; she could contain herself no longer, and
  striking her crutch on the floor she broke out:</p>

  <p>"What next shall we hear! You threaten and storm at the daughter of this
  house as if she were a soldier in your camp! Listen to me, my fine gentleman,
  and mind what I say: In the house of a free Alexandrian citizen no one has
  any right to give his orders&mdash;be he Caesar, Consul or Comes; he has only
  to observe the laws of good manners." Then turning to Gorgo she shook her
  head with pathetic emphasis; "This, my love, is the consequence of too much
  familiar condescension. Come, an end of this! Greeting and parting often go
  hand in hand."</p>

  <p>The prefect turned on his heel and went towards the steps leading to the
  garden; but Gorgo flew after him and seized his hand, calling out to the old
  woman:</p>

  <p>"No, no, grandmother; he is in the right, I am certain he is in the right.
  Stop, Constantine&mdash;wait, stay, and forgive my folly! If you love me,
  mother, say no more&mdash;he will explain it all presently."</p>

  <p>The soldier heaved a sigh of relief and assented in silence, while the
  slave went on with her story: "And when my lord Constantine was gone, my lord
  Demetrius came and he&mdash;but what should poor Sachepris say&mdash;ask my
  lord Demetrius himself to tell you."</p>

  <p>"That is soon done," replied Demetrius, who had failed to understand a
  great deal of all that had been going forward. "My brother Marcus is over
  head and ears in love with the little puss&mdash;she is a pretty
  creature&mdash;and to save that simple soul from mischief I thought I would
  take the business on my own shoulders which are broader and stronger than
  his. I went boldly to work and offered the girl&mdash;more shame for me, I
  must say&mdash;the treasures of Midas; however, offering is one thing and
  accepting is another, and the child snapped me up and sent me to the right
  about&mdash;by Castor and Pollux! packed me off with my tail between my legs!
  My only comfort was that Constantine had just quitted the pretty little
  hussy. By the side of the god of war, thought I, a country Pan makes but a
  poor figure; but this Ares was dismissed by Venus, and so, if only to keep up
  my self-respect, I was forced to conclude that the girl, with all her
  pertness, was of a better sort than we had supposed. My presents, which would
  have tempted any other girl in Alexandria to follow a cripple to Hades, she
  took as an insult; she positively cried with indignation, and I really
  respect pretty little Dada!"</p>

  <p>"She is my very own sister's child," Herse threw in, honestly angered by
  the cheap estimation in which every one seemed to hold her adopted child. "My
  own sister's," she insisted, with an emphasis which seemed to imply that she
  had a whole family of half-sisters. "Though we now earn our bread as singers,
  we have seen better days; and in these hard times Croesus to-day may be Irus
  to-morrow. As for us, Karnis did not dissipate his money in riotous living.
  It was foolish perhaps but it was splendid&mdash;I believe we should do the
  same again; he spent all his inheritance in trying to reinstate Art. However,
  what is the use of looking after money when it is gone! If you can win it, or
  keep it you will be held of some account, but if you are poor the dogs will
  snap at you!&mdash;The girl, Dada&mdash;we have taken as much care of her as
  if she were our own, and divided our last mouthful with her before now.
  Karnis used to tease her about training her voice&mdash;and now, when she
  could really do something to satisfy even good judges&mdash;now, when she
  might have helped us to earn a living-now..."</p>

  <p>The good woman broke down and burst into tears, while Karnis tried to
  soothe and comfort her.</p>

  <p>"We shall get on without them somehow," he said. "'Nil desperandum' says
  Horace the Roman. And after all they are not lizards that can hide in the
  cracks of the walls; I know every corner of Alexandria and I will go and hunt
  them up at once."</p>

  <p>"And I will help you, my friend," said Demetrius, "We will go to the
  Hippodrome&mdash;the gentry you will meet with there are capital blood-hounds
  after such game as the daughter of your 'own sister,' my good woman. As to
  the black-haired Christian girl&mdash;I have seen her many a time on board
  ship..."</p>

  <p>"Oh! she will take refuge with some fellow-Christians," remarked
  Porphyrius. "Olympius told me all about her. I know plenty of the same sort
  in the Church. They fling away life and happiness as if they were
  apple-peelings to snatch at something which they believe to constitute
  salvation. It is folly, madness! pure unmitigated madness! To have sung in
  the temple of the she-devil Isis with Gorgo and the other worshippers would
  have cost her her seat in Paradise. That, as I believe, is the cause of her
  flight."</p>

  <p>"That and nothing else!" cried Karnis. "How vexed the noble Olympius will
  be. Indeed, Apollo be my witness! I have not been so disturbed about anything
  for many a day. Do you happen to recollect," he went on, turning to
  Demetrius, "our conversation on board ship about a dirge for Pytho? Well, we
  had transposed the lament of Isis into the Lydian mode, and when this young
  lady's wonderful voice gave it out, in harmony with Agne's and with Orpheus'
  flute, it was quite exquisite! My old heart floated on wings as I listened!
  And only the day after to-morrow the whole crowd of worshippers in the temple
  of Isis were to enjoy that treat!&mdash;It would have roused them to
  unheard-of enthusiasm. Yesterday the girl was in it, heart and soul; nay,
  only this morning she and the noble Gorgo sang it through from beginning to
  end. One more rehearsal to-morrow, and then the two voices would have given
  such a performance as perhaps was never before heard within the temple
  walls."</p>

  <p>Constantine had listened to this rhapsody with growing agitation; he was
  standing close to Gorgo, and while the rest of the party held anxious
  consultation as to what could be done to follow up and capture the fugitives,
  he asked Gorgo in a low voice, but with gloomy looks:</p>

  <p>"You intended to sing in the temple of Isis? Before the crowd, and with a
  girl of this stamp?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said firmly.</p>

  <p>"And you knew yesterday that I had come home?" She nodded.</p>

  <p>"And yet, this morning even, while you were actually expecting me, you
  could practise the hymn with such a creature?"</p>

  <p>"Agne is not such another as the girl who played tricks with your helmet,"
  replied Gorgo, and the black arches of her eyebrows knit into something very
  like a scowl. "I told you just now that I was not yours today, nor to-morrow.
  We still serve different gods."</p>

  <p>"Indeed we do!" he exclaimed, so vehemently that the others looked round,
  and old Damia again began to fidget in her chair.</p>

  <p>Then with a strong effort he recovered himself and, after standing for
  some minutes gazing in silence at the ground, he said in a low tone:</p>

  <p>"I have borne enough for to-day. Gorgo, pause, reflect. God preserve me
  from despair!"</p>

  <p>He bowed, hastily explained that his duties called him away, and left the
  spot.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The amateurs of horse-racing who assembled in the Hippodrome
  could afford no clue to Dada's hiding-place, because she had not, in fact,
  run away with any gay young gallant. Within a few minutes of her sending
  Sachepris to fetch her a pair of shoes, Medius had hailed her from the shore;
  he wanted to speak with Karnis, and having come on an ass it was not in vain
  that the incensed damsel entreated him to take her with him. He had in fact
  only come to try to persuade Karnis and his wife to spare Dada for a few
  performances, such as he had described, in the house of Posidonius. His hopes
  of success had been but slender; and now the whole thing had settled itself,
  and Dada's wish that her people should not, for a while, know where to find
  her was most opportune for his plans.</p>

  <p>In the days when Karnis was the manager of the theatre at Tauromenium
  Medius had led the chorus, and had received much kindness at the hands of the
  girl's uncle. All this, he thought, he could now repay, for certainly his old
  patron was poor enough, and he intended honestly to share with his former
  benefactor the profits he expected to realize with so fair a prodigy as Dada.
  No harm could come to the girl, and gold&mdash;said he to
  himself&mdash;glitters as brightly and is just as serviceable, even when it
  has been earned for us against our will.</p>

  <p>Medius, being a cautious man, made the girl bring her new dress away with
  her, and the girdle and jewels belonging to it, and his neat hands packed
  everything into the smallest compass. He filled up the basket which he took
  for the purpose with sweetmeats, oranges and pomegranates "for the children
  at home," and easily consoled Dada for the loss of her shoes. He would lead
  the ass and she should ride. She covered her face with a veil, and her little
  feet could be hidden under her dress. When they reached his house he would at
  once have "a sweet little pair of sandals" made for her by the shoemaker who
  worked for the wife of the Comes and the daughters of the Alabarch.* These
  preparations and the start only took a few minutes; and their rapid search
  and broken conversation caused so much absurd confusion that Dada had quite
  recovered her spirits and laughed merrily as she tripped bare-foot across the
  strand. She sprang gaily on to the little donkey and as they made their way
  along the road, the basket containing her small wardrobe placed in front of
  her on the ass's shoulders, she remarked that she should be mistaken for the
  young wife of a shabby old husband, returning from market with a load of
  provisions.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The chief of the Jewish colony in Alexandria. ]</p>

  <p>She was delighted to think of what Herse's face would be when, on her
  return home, she should discover that the prisoner could make her escape even
  without shoes.</p>

  <p>"Let her have a good hunt for me!" she cried quite enchanted. "Why should
  I always be supposed to be ready for folly and wickedness! But one thing I
  warn you: If I am not comfortable and happy with you, and if I do not like
  the parts you want me to fill, we part as quickly as we have come
  together.&mdash;Why are you taking me through all these dirty alleys? I want
  to ride through the main streets and see what is going on." But Medius would
  not agree to this, for in the great arteries of the town there were
  excitement and tumult, and they might think themselves fortunate if they
  reached his house unmolested.</p>

  <p>He lived in a little square, between the Greek quarter and Rhacotis where
  the Egyptians lived, and his house, which was exactly opposite the church of
  St. Marcus, accommodated Medius himself, his wife, his widowed daughter and
  her five children, besides being crammed from top to bottom with all sorts of
  strange properties, standing or hanging in every available space. Dada's
  curiosity had no rest, and by the time she had spent a few hours in the house
  her host's pretty little grandchildren were clinging to her with devoted
  affection.</p>

  <p>Agne had not been so fortunate as to find a refuge so easily. With no
  escort, unveiled, and left entirely to her own guidance, leading the little
  boy, she hurried forward, not knowing whither. All she thought was to get
  away&mdash;far away from these men who were trying to imperil her immortal
  soul.</p>

  <p>She knew that Karnis had actually bought her, and that she was, therefore,
  his property and chattel. Even Christian doctrine taught her that the slave
  must obey his master; but she could not feel like a slave, and if indeed she
  were one her owner might destroy and kill her body, but not her soul. The
  law, however, was on the side of Karnis, and it allowed him to pursue her and
  cast her into prison. This idea haunted her, and for fear of being caught she
  avoided all the chief thoroughfares and kept close to the houses as she stole
  through the side streets and alleys. Once, in Antioch, she had seen a runaway
  slave, who, having succeeded in reaching a statue of the Emperor and laying
  his hand on it, was by that act safe from his pursuers. There must surely be
  such a statue somewhere in Alexandria&mdash;but where? A woman, of whom she
  enquired, directed her down a wider street that would take her into the
  Canopic Way. If she crossed that and went down the first turning to the left
  she would reach a large open square in the Bruchium, and there, in front of
  the Prefect's residence and by the side of the Bishop's house, stood the new
  statue of Theodosius.</p>

  <p>This information, and the mention of the Bishop, gave a new course to her
  proceedings. It was wrong to defy and desert her master, but to obey him
  would be deadly sin. Which must she choose and which avoid? Only one person
  could advise in such a case&mdash;only one could relieve her mind of its
  difficulties and terrors: The Shepherd of souls in the city&mdash;the Bishop
  himself. She too was a lamb of his flock; to him and to no one else could she
  turn.</p>

  <p>This thought fell on her heart like a ray of light dispersing the clouds
  of uncertainty and alarm. With a deep breath of relief she took the child in
  her arms and told him&mdash;for he was whimpering to know where she was
  taking him, and why he might not go back to Dada&mdash;that they were going
  to see a good, kind man who would tell them the way home to their father and
  mother. Papias, however, still wailed to go to Dada and not to the man.</p>

  <p>Half insisting and half coaxing him with promises, she dragged him along
  as far as the main street. This was full of an excited throng; soldiers on
  foot and on horseback were doing what they could to keep the peace, and the
  bustle amused the little boy's curiosity so that he soon forgot his
  homesickness. When, at length, Ague found the street that led to the
  Prefect's house she was fairly carried along by the surging, rushing mob. To
  turn was quite impossible; the utmost she could do was to keep her wits about
  her, and concentrate her strength so as not to be parted from the child.
  Pushed, pulled, squeezed, scolded, and abused by other women for her folly in
  bringing a child out into such a crowd, she at last found herself in the
  great square. A hideous hubbub of coarse, loud voices pierced her
  unaccustomed ears; she could have sunk on the earth and cried; but she kept
  up her courage and collected all her energies, for she saw in the distance a
  large gilt cross over a lofty doorway. It was like a greeting and welcome
  home. Under its protection she would certainly, find rest, consolation and
  safety.</p>

  <p>But how was she to reach it? The space before her was packed with men as a
  quiver is packed with arrows; there was not room for a pin between. The only
  chance of getting forward was by forcing her way, and nine-tenths of the
  crowd were men&mdash;angry and storming men, whose wild and strange demeanor
  filled her with terror and disgust. Most of them were monks who had flocked
  in at the Bishop's appeal from the monasteries of the desert, or from the
  Lauras and hermitages of Kolzum by the Red Sea, or even from Tabenna in Upper
  Egypt, and whose hoarse voices rent the air with vehement cries of: "Down
  with the idols! Down with Serapis! Death to the heathen!"</p>

  <p>This army of the Saviour whose very essence was gentleness and whose
  spirit was love, seemed indeed to have deserted from his standard of light
  and grace to the blood-stained banner of murderous hatred. Their matted locks
  and beards fringed savage faces with glowing eyes; their haggard or paunchy
  nakedness was scarcely covered by undressed hides of sheep and goats; their
  parched skins were scarred and striped by the use of the scourges that hung
  at their girdles. One&mdash;a "crown bearer"&mdash;had a face streaming with
  blood, from the crown of thorns which he had vowed to wear day and night in
  memory and imitation of the Redeemer's sufferings, and which on this great
  occasion he pressed hard into the flesh with ostentatious martyrdom. One,
  who, in his monastery, had earned the name of the "oil-jar," supported
  himself on his neighbors' arms, for his emaciated legs could hardly carry his
  dropsical carcass which, for the last ten years, he had fed exclusively on
  gourds, snails, locusts and Nile water. Another was chained inseparably to a
  comrade, and the couple dwelt together in a cave in the limestone hills near
  Lycopolis. These two had vowed never to let each other sleep, that so their
  time for repentance might be doubled, and their bliss in the next world
  enhanced in proportion to their mortifications in this.</p>

  <p>One and all, they were allies in a great fight, and the same hopes, ideas,
  and wishes fired them all. The Abominable Thing&mdash;which imperilled
  hundreds of thousands of souls, which invited Satan to assert his dominion in
  this world&mdash;should fall this day and be annihilated forever! To them the
  whole heathen world was the "great whore;" and though the gems she wore were
  beautiful to see and rejoiced the mind and heart of fools, they must be
  snatched from her painted brow; they would scourge her from off the face of
  the redeemed earth and destroy the seducer of souls forever. "Down with the
  idols! Down with Serapis! Down with the heathen!" Their shouts thundered and
  bellowed all about Agne; but, just as the uproar and crush were at the worst,
  a tall and majestic figure appeared on a balcony above the cross and extended
  his hand in calm and dignified benediction towards the seething mass of
  humanity. As he raised it all present, including Ague, bowed and bent the
  knee.</p>

  <p>Agne felt, knew, that this stately man was the Bishop whom she sought, but
  she did not point him out to her little brother, for his aspect was that of
  some proud sovereign rather than of "the good, kind man" of whom she had
  dreamed. She could never dare to force her way into the presence of this
  great lord! How should the ruler over a million souls find time or patience
  for her and her trivial griefs?</p>

  <p>However, there must be within his dwelling sundry presbyters and deacons,
  and she would address herself to one of them, as soon as the crowd had
  dispersed enough for her to make her way to the door beneath the cross.
  Twenty times at least did she renew her efforts, but she made very small
  progress; most of the monks, as she tried to squeeze past them, roughly
  pushed her back; one, on whose arm she ventured to lay her hand, begging him
  to make way for her, broke out into shrieks as though a serpent had stung
  him, and when the crush brought her into contact with the crown-bearer he
  thrust her away exclaiming:</p>

  <p>"Away woman! Do not touch me, spawn of Satan tool of the evil one! or I
  will tread you under foot!"</p>

  <p>Retreat had been as impossible as progress, and long hours went by which
  to her seemed like days; still she felt no fatigue, only alarm and disgust,
  and, more than anything else, an ardent desire to reach the Bishop's palace
  and take counsel of a priest. It was long past noon when a diversion took
  place which served at any rate to interest and amuse the crying child.</p>

  <p>On the platform above the doorway Cynegius came forth&mdash;Cynegius, the
  Emperor's delegate; a stout man of middle height, with a shrewd round head
  and a lawyer's face. State dignitaries, Consuls and Prefects had, at this
  date, ceased to wear the costume that had marked the patricians of old
  Rome&mdash;a woollen toga that fell in broad and dignified folds from the
  shoulders; a long, close-fitting robe had taken its place, of purple silk
  brocade with gold flowers. On the envoy's shoulder blazed the badge of the
  highest officials, a cruciform ornament of a peculiarly thick and costly
  tissue. He greeted the crowd with a condescending bow, a herald blew three
  blasts on the tuba, and then Cynegius, with a wave of his hand introduced his
  private secretary who stood by his side, and who at once opened a roll he
  held and shouted at the top of a ringing voice:</p>

  <p>"Silence in Caesar's name!"</p>

  <p>The trumpet then sounded for the fourth time, and silence so complete fell
  on the crowded square that the horses of the mounted guard in front of the
  Prefect's house could be heard snorting and champing.</p>

  <p>"In Caesar's name," repeated the official, who had been selected for the
  duty of reading the Imperial message. Cynegius himself bent his head, again
  waved his hand towards his secretary, and then towards the statues of the
  Emperor and Empress which, mounted on gilt standards, were displayed to the
  populace on each side of the balcony; then the reading began:</p>

  <p>"Theodosius Caesar greets the inhabitants of the great and noble city of
  Alexandria, by Cynegius, his faithful ambassador and servant. He knows that
  its true and honest citizens confess the Holy Faith in all piety and
  steadfastness, as delivered to believers in the beginning by Peter, the
  prince of the Apostles; he knows that they hold the true Christian faith, and
  abide by the doctrine delivered by the Holy Ghost to the Fathers of the
  Church in council at Nicaea.</p>

  <p>"Theodosius Caesar who, in all humility and pride, claims to be the sword
  and shield, the champion and the rampart of the one true faith, congratulates
  his subjects of the great and noble city of Alexandria inasmuch as that most
  of them have turned from the devilish heresy of Arius, and have confessed the
  true Nicaean creed; and he announces to them, by his faithful and noble
  servant Cynegius, that this faith and no other shall be recognized in
  Alexandria, as throughout his dominions.</p>

  <p>"In Egypt, as in all his lands and provinces, every doctrine opposed to
  this precious creed shall be persecuted, and all who confess, preach or
  diffuse any other doctrine shall be considered heretics and treated as
  such."</p>

  <p>The secretary paused, for loud and repeated shouts of joy broke from the
  multitude. Not a dissentient word was heard-indeed, the man who should have
  dared to utter one would certainly not have escaped unpunished. It was not
  till the herald had several times blown a warning blast that the reader could
  proceed, as follows:</p>

  <p>"It has come to the ears of your Caesar, to the deep grieving of his
  Christian soul, that the ancient idolatry, which so long smote mankind with
  blindness and kept them wandering far from the gates of Paradise, still,
  through the power of the devil, has some temples and altars in your great and
  noble city. But because it is grievous to the Christian and clement heart of
  the Emperor to avenge the persecutions and death which so many holy martyrs
  have endured at the hands of the bloodthirsty and cruel heathen on their
  posterity, or on the miscreant and&mdash;misbelieving enemies of our holy
  faith&mdash;and because the Lord hath said 'vengeance is
  mine'&mdash;Theodosius Caesar only decrees that the temples of the heathen
  idols in this great and noble city of Alexandria shall be closed, their
  images destroyed and their altars overthrown. Whosoever shall defile himself
  with blood, or slay an innocent beast for sacrifice, or enter a heathen
  temple, or perform any religious ceremony therein, or worship any image of a
  god made by hands-nay, or pray in any temple in the country or in the city,
  shall be at once required to pay a fine of fifteen pounds of gold; and
  whosoever shall know of such a crime being committed without giving
  information of it, shall be fined to the same amount."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Codex Theodosianus XVI, 10, 10. ]</p>

  <p>The last words were spoken to the winds, for a shout of triumph, louder
  and wilder than had ever before been heard even on this favorite
  meeting-place of the populace, rent the very skies. Nor did it cease, nor
  yield to any trumpet-blast, but rolled on in spreading waves down every
  street and alley; it reached the ships in the port, and rang through the
  halls of the rich and the hovels of the poor; it even found a dull echo in
  the light-house at the point of Pharos, where the watchman was trimming the
  lamp for the night; and in an incredibly short time all Alexandria knew that
  Caesar had dealt a death-blow to the worship of the heathen gods.</p>

  <p>The great and fateful rumor was heard, too, in the Museum and the
  Serapeum; once more the youth who had grown up in the high schools of the
  city, studying the wisdom of the heathen, gathered together; men who had
  refined and purified their intellect at the spring of Greek philosophy and
  fired their spirit with enthusiasm for all that was good and lovely in the
  teaching of ancient Greece&mdash;these obeyed the summons of their master,
  Olympius, or flew to arms under the leadership of Orestes, the Governor, for
  the High-Priest himself had to see to the defences of the
  Serapeum.&mdash;Olympius had weapons ready in abundance, and the youths
  rapidly collected round the standards he had prepared, and rushed into the
  square before the Prefect's house to drive away the monks and to insist that
  Cynegius should return forthwith to Rome with the Emperor's edict.</p>

  <p>Young and noble lads were they who marched forth to the struggle, equipped
  like the Helleman soldiers of the palmy days of Athens; and as they went they
  sang a battle-song of Callinus which some one&mdash;who, no one could
  tell&mdash;had slightly altered for the occasion:</p>

  <p>"Come, rouse ye Greeks; what, sleeping still! Is courage dead, is shame
  unknown? Start up, rush forth with zealous will, And smite the mocking
  Christians down!"</p>

  <p>Everything that opposed their progress was overthrown. Two maniples of
  foot-soldiers who held the high-road across the Bruchium attempted to turn
  them, but the advance of the inflamed young warriors was irresistible and
  they reached the street of the Caesareum and the square in front of the
  Prefect's residence. Here they paused to sing the last lines of their
  battlesong:</p>

  <p>"Fate seeks the coward out at home, He dies unwept, unknown to fame, While
  by the hero's honored tomb Our grandsons' grandsons shall proclaim: 'In the
  great conflict's fiercest hour He stood unmoved, our shield and tower.'"</p>

  <p>It was here, at the wide opening into the square, that the collision took
  place: on one side the handsome youths, crowned with garlands, with their
  noble Greek type of heads, thoughtful brows, perfumed curls, and anointed
  limbs exercised in the gymnasium&mdash;on the other the sinister fanatics in
  sheep-skin, ascetic visionaries grown grey in fasting, scourging, and
  self-denial.</p>

  <p>The monks now prepared to meet the onset of the young enthusiasts who were
  fighting for freedom of thought and enquiry, for Art and Beauty. Each side
  was defending what it felt to be the highest Good, each was equally in
  earnest as to its convictions, both fought for something dearer and more
  precious than this earthly span of existence. But the philosophers' party had
  swords; the monks' sole weapon was the scourge, and they were accustomed to
  ply that, not on each other but on their own rebellious flesh. A wild and
  disorderly struggle began with swingeing blows on both sides; prayers and
  psalms mingling with the battle-song of the heathen. Here a monk fell
  wounded, there one lay dead, there again lay a fine and delicate-looking
  youth, felled by the heavy fist of a recluse. A hermit wrestled hand to hand
  with a young philosopher who, only yesterday had delivered his first lecture
  on the Neo-Platonism of Plotinus to an interested audience.</p>

  <p>And in the midst of this mad struggle stood Agne with her little brother,
  who clung closely to her skirts and was too terrified to shed a tear or utter
  a cry. The girl was resolutely calm, but she was too utterly terror-stricken
  even to pray. Fear, absorbing fear had stunned her thoughts; it overmastered
  her like some acute physical pain which began in her heart and penetrated
  every fibre of her frame.</p>

  <p>Even while the Imperial message was being read she had been too frightened
  to take it all in; and now she simply shut her eyes tight and hardly
  understood what was going on around her, till a new and different noise
  sounded close in her ears: the clatter of hoofs, blare of trumpets and shouts
  and screams. At last the tumult died away and, when she ventured to open her
  eyes and look about her, the place all round her was as clear as though it
  had been swept by invisible hands; here and there lay a dead body and there
  still was a dense crowd in the street leading to the Caesareum, but even that
  was dispersing and retreating before the advance of a mounted force.</p>

  <p>She breathed freely once more, and released the child's head from the
  skirt of her dress in which he had wrapped and buried it. The end of her
  alarms was not yet come, however, for a troop of the young heathen came
  flying across the square in wild retreat before a division of the heavy
  cavalry, which had intervened to part the combatants.</p>

  <p>The fugitives came straight towards her; again she closed her eyes
  tightly, expecting every instant to find herself under the horses' feet. Then
  one of the runaways knocked down Papias, and she could bear no more; her
  senses deserted her, her knees failed under her, she lost consciousness, and
  with a dull groan she fell on the dusty pavement. Close to her, as she lay,
  rushed the pursued and the pursuers&mdash;and at last, how long after she
  knew not, when she recovered her senses she felt as if she were floating in
  the air, and presently perceived that a soldier had her in his arms and was
  carrying her like a child.</p>

  <p>Fresh alarms and fresh shame overwhelmed the poor girl; she tried to free
  herself and found him quite ready to set her down. When she was once more on
  her feet and felt that she could stand she glanced wildly round her with
  sudden recollection, and then uttered a hoarse cry, for her mouth and tongue
  were parched:</p>

  <p>"Christ Jesus! Where is my brother?" She pushed back her hair with a
  desperate gesture, pressing her hands to her temples and peering all round
  her with a look of fevered misery.</p>

  <p>She was still in the square and close to the door of the Prefect's house;
  a man on horseback, in all probability her preserver's servant, was following
  them, leading his master's horse. On the pavement lay wounded men groaning
  with pain; the street of the Caesareum was lined with a double row of
  footsoldiers of Papias no sign!</p>

  <p>Again she called him, and with such deep anguish in her voice, which was
  harsh and shrill with terror, that the young officer looked at her with
  extreme compassion.</p>

  <p>"Papias, Papias&mdash;my little brother! O God my Saviour!&mdash;where,
  where is the child?"</p>

  <p>"We will have him sought for," said the soldier whose voice was gentle and
  kind. "You are too young and pretty&mdash;what brought you into this crowd
  and amid such an uproar?"</p>

  <p>She colored deeply and looking down answered low and hurriedly: "I was
  going to see the Bishop."</p>

  <p>"You chose an evil hour," replied Constantine, for it was he who had found
  her lying on the pavement and who had thought it only an act of mercy not to
  trust so young and fair a girl to the protection of his followers. "You may
  thank God that you have got off so cheaply. Now, I must return to my men. You
  know where the Bishop lives? Yes, here. And with regard to your little
  brother... Stay; do you live in Alexandria?" "No, my lord."</p>

  <p>"But you have some relation or friend whom you lodge with?"</p>

  <p>"No, my lord. I am ... I have ... I told you, I only want to see my lord
  the Bishop."</p>

  <p>"Very strange! Well, take care of yourself. My time is not my own; but by-
  and-bye, in a very short time, I will speak to the city watchmen; how old is
  the boy?"</p>

  <p>"Nearly six."</p>

  <p>"And with black hair like yours?"</p>

  <p>"No, my lord&mdash;fair hair," and as she spoke the tears started to her
  eyes. "He has light curly hair and a sweet, pretty little face."</p>

  <p>The prefect smiled and nodded. "And if they find him," he went on,
  "Papias, you say, is his name where is he to be taken?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know, my lord, for&mdash;and yet! Oh! my head aches, I cannot
  think&mdash;if only I knew... If they find him he must come here&mdash;here
  to my lord the Bishop."</p>

  <p>"To Theophilus?" said Constantine in surprise. "Yes, yes&mdash;to him,"
  she said hastily. "Or&mdash;stay&mdash;to the gate-keeper at the Bishop's
  palace."</p>

  <p>"Well, that is less aristocratic, but perhaps it is more to the purpose,"
  said the officer; and with a sign to his servant, he twisted his hand in his
  horse's mane, leaped into the saddle, waved her a farewell, and rejoined his
  men without paying any heed to her thanks.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There was much bustle and stir in the hall of the Episcopal
  palace. Priests and monks were crowding in and out; widows, who, as
  deaconesses, were entrusted with the care of the sick, were waiting, bandages
  in hand, and discussing their work and cases, while acolytes lifted the
  wounded on to the litters to carry them to the hospitals.</p>

  <p>The deacon Eusebius, whom we have met as the spiritual adviser of Marcus,
  was superintending the good work, and he took particular care that as much
  attention should be shown to the wounded heathen as to the Christians.</p>

  <p>In front of the building veterans of the twenty-first legion paced up and
  down in the place of the ordinary gate-keepers, who were sufficient
  protection in times of peace.</p>

  <p>Agne looked in vain for any but soldiers, but at last she slipped in
  unobserved among the men and women who were tending the wounded. She was
  terribly thirsty, and seeing one of the widows mixing some wine and water and
  offer it to one of the wounded men who pushed it away, she took courage and
  begged the deaconess to give her a drink. The woman handed her the cup at
  once, asking to whom she belonged that she was here.</p>

  <p>"I want to see my lord, the Bishop," replied Agne, but then correcting
  herself, she added hastily: "If I could see the Bishop's gate-keeper, I might
  speak to him."</p>

  <p>"There he is," said the deaconess, pointing to an enormously tall man
  standing in the darkest and remotest corner of the hall. The darkness
  reminded her for the first time that it was now evening. Night was drawing
  on, and then where could she take refuge and find shelter? She shuddered and
  simply saying: "Thank you," she went to the man who had been pointed out to
  her and begged that if her little brother should be found and brought to him,
  he would take charge of him.</p>

  <p>"To be sure," said the big man good-naturedly. "He can be taken to the
  orphanage of the 'Good Samaritan' if they bring him here, and you can enquire
  for him there."</p>

  <p>She then made so bold as to ask if she could see a priest; but for this
  she was directed to go to the church, as all those who were immediately
  attached to the Bishop were to-day fully occupied, and had no time for
  trifles. Agne, however, persisted in her request till the man lost patience
  altogether and told her to be off at once; but at this instant three
  ecclesiastics came in at the door by which her friend was on guard, and Agne,
  collecting all her courage, went up to one of them, a priest of advanced age,
  and besought him urgently:</p>

  <p>"Oh! reverend Father, I beg of you to hear me. I must speak to a priest,
  and that man drives me away and says you none of you have time to attend to
  me!"</p>

  <p>"Did he say that!" asked the priest, and he turned angrily on the culprit
  saying: "The Church and her ministers never lack time to attend to the needs
  of any faithful soul&mdash;I will follow you, brothers.&mdash;Now, my child,
  what is it that you need?"</p>

  <p>"It lies so heavily on my soul," replied Agne, raising her eyes and hands
  in humble supplication. "I love my Saviour, but I cannot always do exactly as
  I should wish, and I do not know how I ought to act so as not to fall into
  sin."</p>

  <p>"Come with me," said the priest, and leading the way across a small
  garden, he took her into a wide open court and from thence in at a side door
  and up a flight of stairs which led to the upper floor. As she followed him
  her heart beat high with painful and yet hopeful excitement. She kept her
  hands tightly clasped and tried to pray, but she could hardly control her
  thoughts of her brother and of all she wanted to say to the presbyter.</p>

  <p>They presently entered a lofty room where the window-shutters were closed,
  and where a number of lamps, already lighted, were hanging over the cushioned
  divans on which sat rows of busy scribes of all ages.</p>

  <p>"Here we are," said the priest kindly, as he seated himself in an easy-
  chair at some little distance from the writers. "Now, tell me fully what
  troubles you; but as briefly as you can, for I am sparing you these minutes
  from important business."</p>

  <p>"My lord," she began, "my parents were freeborn, natives of Augusta
  Trevirorum. My father was a collector of tribute in the Emperor's service
  ..."</p>

  <p>"Very good&mdash;but has this anything to do with the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, it has. My father and mother were good Christians and in the
  riots at Antioch&mdash;you remember, my lord, three years ago&mdash;they were
  killed and I and my brother&mdash;Papias is his name ..."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes&mdash;go on."</p>

  <p>"We were sold. My master paid for us&mdash;I saw the money; but he did not
  treat us as slaves. But now he wants me&mdash;he, Sir, is wholly devoted to
  the heathen gods-and he wants me ..."</p>

  <p>"To serve his idols?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, reverend Father, and so we ran away."</p>

  <p>"Quite right, my child."</p>

  <p>"But the scriptures say that the slave shall obey his master?"</p>

  <p>"True; but higher than the master in the flesh is the Father in Heaven,
  and it is better a thousand times to sin against man than against God."</p>

  <p>This conversation had been carried on in an undertone on account of the
  scribes occupied at the desks; but the priest raised his voice with his last
  words, and he must have been heard in the adjoining room, for a heavy curtain
  of plain cloth was opened, and an unusually deep and powerful voice
  exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Back again already, Irenaeus! That is well; I want to speak with
  you."</p>

  <p>"Immediately, my lord&mdash;I am at your service in a moment.&mdash;Now,
  my child," he added, rising, "you know what your duty is. And if your master
  looks you up and insists on your assisting at the sacrifice or what ever it
  may be, you will find shelter with us. My name is Irenaeus."</p>

  <p>Here he was again interrupted, for the curtain was lifted once more and a
  man came out of the inner room whom no one could forget after having once met
  him. It was the Bishop whom Agne had seen on the balcony; she recognized him
  at once, and dropped on her knees to kiss the hem of his robe in all
  humility. Theophilus accepted the homage as a matter of course, hastily
  glancing at the child with his large keen eyes; Agne not daring to raise
  hers, for there was certainly something strangely impressive in his aspect.
  Then, with a wave of his long thin hand to indicate Agne, he asked:</p>

  <p>"What does this girl want?"</p>

  <p>"A freeborn girl&mdash;parents Christian&mdash;comes from Antioch..."
  replied Irenaeus. "Sold to a heathen master&mdash;commanded to serve
  idols&mdash;has run away and now has doubts ..."</p>

  <p>"You have told her to which Lord her service is due?" interrupted the
  Bishop. Then, turning to Agne, he said: "And why did you come here instead of
  going to the deacon of your own church?"</p>

  <p>"We have only been here a few days," replied the girl timidly, as she
  ventured to raise her eyes to the handsome face of this princely prelate,
  whose fine, pale features looked as if they had been carved out of
  marble.</p>

  <p>"Then go to partake of the sacred Eucharist in the basilica of Mary,"
  replied the Bishop. "It is just now the hour&mdash;but no, stop. You are a
  stranger here you say; you have run away from your master&mdash;and you are
  young, very young and very... It is dark too. Where are you intending to
  sleep?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know," said Agne, and her eyes filled with tears.</p>

  <p>"That is what I call courage!" murmured Theophilus to the priest, and then
  he added to Agne: "Well, thanks to the saints, we have asylums for such as
  you, here in the city. That scribe will give you a document which will secure
  your admission to one. So you come from Antioch? Then there is the refuge of
  Seleucus of Antioch. To what parish* did your parents belong?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Parochia in Latin. ]</p>

  <p>"To that of John the Baptist?"</p>

  <p>"Where Damascius was the preacher?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, holy Father. He was the shepherd of our souls."</p>

  <p>"What! Damascius the Arian?" cried the Bishop. He drew his fine and
  stately figure up to its most commanding height and closed his thin lips in
  august contempt, while Irenaeus, clasping his hands in horror, asked her:</p>

  <p>"And you&mdash;do you, too, confess the heresy of Arius?"</p>

  <p>"My parents were Arians," replied Agne in much surprise. "They taught me
  to worship the godlike Saviour."</p>

  <p>"Enough!" exclaimed the Bishop severely. "Come Irenaeus."</p>

  <p>He nodded to the priest to follow him, opened the curtain and went in
  first with supreme dignity.</p>

  <p>Agne stood as if a thunderbolt had fallen, pale, trembling and desperate.
  Then was she not a Christian? Was it a sin in a child to accept the creed of
  her parents? And were those who, after charitably extending a saving hand,
  had so promptly withdrawn it&mdash;were they Christians in the full meaning
  of the All-merciful Redeemer?</p>

  <p>Agonizing doubts of everything that she had hitherto deemed sacred and
  inviolable fell upon her soul; doubts of everything in heaven and earth, and
  not merely of Christ and of his godlike, or divine goodness&mdash;for what
  difference was there to her apprehension in the meaning of the two words
  which set man to hunt and persecute man? In the distress and hopeless dilemma
  in which she found herself, she shed no tears; she simply stood rooted to the
  spot where she had heard the Bishop's verdict.</p>

  <p>Presently her attention was roused by the shrill voice of an old writer
  who called out to one of the younger assistants.</p>

  <p>"That girl disturbs me, Petubastis; show her out." Petubastis, a pretty
  Egyptian lad, was more than glad of an interruption to his work which somehow
  seemed endless to-day; he put aside his implements, stroked back the black
  hair that had fallen over his face, and removing the reed-pen from behind his
  ear, stuck in a sprig of dark blue larkspur. Then he tripped to the door,
  opened it, looked at the girl with the cool impudence of a connoisseur in
  beauty, bowed slightly, and pointing the way out said with airified
  politeness:</p>

  <p>"Allow me!"</p>

  <p>Agne at once obeyed and with a drooping head left the room; but the young
  Egyptian stole out after her, and as soon as the door was shut he seized her
  hand and said in a whisper: "If you can wait half an hour at the bottom of
  the stairs, pretty one, I will take you somewhere where you will enjoy
  yourself."</p>

  <p>She had stopped to listen, and looked enquiringly into his face, for she
  had no suspicion of his meaning; the young fellow, encouraged by this, laid
  his hand on her shoulder and would have drawn her towards him but that she,
  thrusting him from her as if he were some horrible animal, flew down the
  steps as fast as her feet could carry her, and through the courtyard back
  into the great entrance-hall.</p>

  <p>Here all was, by this time, dark and still; only a few lamps lighted the
  pillared space and the flare of a torch fell upon the benches placed there
  for the accommodation of priests, laymen and supplicants generally.</p>

  <p>Utterly worn out&mdash;whether by terror or disappointment or by hunger
  and fatigue she scarcely knew&mdash;she sank on a seat and buried her face in
  her hands.</p>

  <p>During her absence the wounded had been conveyed to the sick-houses; one
  only was left whom they had not been able to move. He was lying on a mattress
  between two of the columns at some little distance from Agne, and the light
  of a lamp, standing on a medicine-chest, fell on his handsome but bloodless
  features. A deaconess was kneeling at his head and gazed in silence in the
  face of the dead, while old Eusebius crouched prostrate by his side, resting
  his cheek on the breast of the man whose eyes were sealed in eternal sleep.
  Two sounds only broke the profound silence of the deserted hall: an
  occasional faint sob from the old man and the steady step of the soldiers on
  guard in front of the Bishop's palace. The widow, kneeling with clasped
  hands, never took her eyes off the face of the youth, nor moved for fear of
  disturbing the deacon who, as she knew, was praying&mdash;praying for the
  salvation of the heathen soul snatched away before it could repent. Many
  minutes passed before the old man rose, dried his moist eyes, pressed his
  lips to the cold hand of the dead and said sadly:</p>

  <p>"So young&mdash;so handsome&mdash;a masterpiece of the Creator's hand!...
  Only to-day as gay as a lark, the pride and joy of his mother-and now! How
  many hopes, how much triumph and happiness are extinct with that life. O Lord
  my Saviour, Thou hast said that not only those who call Thee Lord, Lord,
  shall find grace with our Father in Heaven, and that Thou hast shed Thy blood
  for the salvation even of the heathen&mdash;save, redeem this one! Thou that
  are the Good Shepherd, have mercy on this wandering sheep!"</p>

  <p>Stirred to the bottom of his soul the old man threw up his arms and gazed
  upwards rapt in ecstasy. But presently, with an effort, he said to the
  deaconess:</p>

  <p>"You know, Sister, that this lad was the only son of Berenice, the widow
  of Asclepiodorus, the rich shipowner. Poor, bereaved mother! Only yesterday
  he was driving his guadriga out of the gate on the road to Marea, and
  now&mdash;here! Go and tell her of this terrible occurrence. I would go
  myself but that, as I am a priest, it might be painful to her to learn of his
  tragic end from one of the very men against whom the poor darkened youth had
  drawn the sword. So do you go, Sister, and treat the poor soul very tenderly;
  and if you find it suitable show her very gently that there is One who has
  balm for every wound, and that we&mdash;we and all who believe in
  Him&mdash;lose what is dear to us only to find it again. Tell her of hope:
  Hope is everything. They say that green is the color of hope, for it is the
  spring-tide of the heart. There may be a Spring for her yet."</p>

  <p>The deaconess rose, pressed a kiss on the eyes of the dead youth, promised
  Eusebius that she would do her best and went away. He, too, was about to
  leave when he heard a sound of low sobbing from one of the benches. He stood
  still to listen, shook his old head, and muttering to himself:</p>

  <p>"Great God&mdash;merciful and kind... Thou alone canst know wherefore Thou
  hast set the rose-garland of life with so many sharp thorns," he went up to
  Agne who rose at his approach.</p>

  <p>"Why, my child," he said kindly, "what are you weeping for? Have you, too,
  lost some dear one killed in the fray?"</p>

  <p>"No, no," she hastily replied with a gesture of terror at the thought.</p>

  <p>"What then do you want here at so late an hour?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing&mdash;nothing," she said. "That is all over! Good God, how long I
  must have been sitting here&mdash;I&mdash;I know I must go; yes, I know
  it."</p>

  <p>"And are you alone-no one with you?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head sadly. The old man looked at her narrowly.</p>

  <p>"Then I will take you safe home," he said. "You see I am an old man and a
  priest. Where do you live, my child?"</p>

  <p>"I? I..." stammered Agne, and a torrent of scalding tears fell down her
  cheeks. "My God! my God! where, where am I to go?"</p>

  <p>"You have no home, no one belonging to you?" asked the old man. "Come,
  child, pluck up your courage and tell me truly what it is that troubles you;
  perhaps I may be able to help you."</p>

  <p>"You?" she said with bitter melancholy. "Are not you one of the Bishop's
  priests?"</p>

  <p>"I am a deacon, and Theophilus is the head of my church; but for that very
  reason ..."</p>

  <p>"No," said Agne sharply, "I will deceive no one. My parents were Arians,
  and as my beliefs are the same as theirs the Bishop has driven me away as an
  outcast, finally and without pity."</p>

  <p>"Indeed," said Eusebius. "Did the Bishop do that? Well, as the head of a
  large community of Christians he, of course, is bound to look at things in
  their widest aspect; small things, small people can be nothing to him. I, on
  the contrary, am myself but a small personage, and I care for small things.
  You know, child, that the Lord has said 'that in his Father's kingdom there
  are many mansions,' and that in which Arius dwells is not mine; but it is in
  the Father's kingdom nevertheless. It cannot be so much amiss after all that
  you should cling to the creed of your parents. What is your name?"</p>

  <p>"Agne."</p>

  <p>"Agne, or the lamb. A pretty, good name! It is a name I love, as I, too,
  am a shepherd, though but a very humble one, so trust yourself to me, little
  lamb. Tell me, why are you crying? And whom do you seek here? And how is it
  that you do not know where to find a home?"</p>

  <p>Eusebius spoke with such homely kindness, and his voice was so full of
  fatherly sympathy that hope revived in Agne's breast, and she told him with
  frank confidence all he wanted to know.</p>

  <p>The old man listened with many a "Hum" and "Ha"&mdash;then he bid her
  accompany him to his own house, where his wife would find a corner that she
  might fill.</p>

  <p>She gladly agreed, and thanked him eagerly when he also told the
  doorkeeper to bring Papias after them if he should be found. Relieved of the
  worst of her griefs, Agne followed her new friend through the streets and
  lanes, till they paused at the gate of a small garden and he said: "Here we
  are. What we have we give gladly, but it is little, very little. Indeed, who
  can bear to live in luxury when so many are perishing in want and
  misery?"</p>

  <p>As they went across the plot, between the little flower-beds, the deacon
  pointed to a tree and said with some pride: "Last year that tree bore me
  three hundred and seven peaches, and it is still healthy and productive."</p>

  <p>A hospitable light twinkled in the little house at the end of the garden,
  and as they entered a queer-looking dog came out to meet his master, barking
  his welcome. He jumped with considerable agility on his fore-legs, but his
  hind legs were paralyzed and his body sloped away and stuck up in the air as
  though it were attached to an invisible board.</p>

  <p>"This is my good friend Lazarus," said the old man cheerfully. "I found
  the poor beggar in the road one day, and as he was one of God's creatures,
  although he is a cripple, I comfort myself with the verse from the Psalms:
  'The Lord has no joy in the strength of a horse, neither taketh he pleasure
  in any man's legs.'"</p>

  <p>He was so evidently content and merry that Agne could not help laughing
  too, and when, in a few minutes, the deacon's wife gave her a warm and
  motherly reception she would have been happier than she had been for a long
  time past, if only her little brother had not been a weight on her mind and
  if she had not longed so sadly to have him safe by her side. But even that
  anxiety presently found relief, for she was so weary and exhausted that,
  after eating a few mouthfuls, she was thankful to lie down in the clean bed
  that Elizabeth had prepared for her, and she instantly fell asleep. She was
  in the old deacon's bed, and he made ready to pass the night on the couch in
  his little sitting-room.</p>

  <p>As soon as the old couple were alone Eusebius told his wife how and where
  he had met the girl and ended by saying:</p>

  <p>"It is a puzzling question as to these Arians and other Christian
  heretics. I cannot be hard on them so long as they cling faithfully to the
  One Lord who is necessary to all. If we are in the right&mdash;and I firmly
  believe that we are&mdash;and the Son is of one substance of the Father, he
  is without spot or blemish; and what can be more divine than to overlook the
  error of another if it concerns ourselves, or what more meanly human than to
  take such an error amiss and indulge in a cruel or sanguinary revenge on the
  erring soul? Do not misunderstand me. I, unfortunately&mdash;or rather, I
  say, thank God!&mdash;I have done nothing great here on earth, and have never
  risen to be anything more than a deacon. But if a boy comes up to me and
  mistakes me for an acolyte or something of that kind, is that a reason why I
  should flout or punish him? Not a bit of it.</p>

  <p>"And to my belief our Saviour is too purely divine to hate those who
  regard Him as only 'God-like.' He is Love. And when Arius goes to Heaven and
  sees Jesus Christ in all His divine glory, and falls down before Him in an
  ecstasy of joy and repentance, the worst the Lord will do to him will be to
  take him by the ear and say: 'Thou fool! Now thou seest what I really am; but
  thine errors be forgiven!'"</p>

  <p>Elizabeth nodded assent. "Amen," she said, "so be it.&mdash;And so, no
  doubt, it will be. Did the Lord cast out the woman taken in adultery? Did he
  not give us the parable of the Samaritan?&mdash;Poor little girl! We have
  often wished for a daughter and now we have found one; a pretty creature she
  is too. God grants us all our wishes! But you must be tired, old man; go to
  rest now."</p>

  <p>"Directly, directly," said Eusebius; but then, striking his forehead with
  his hand, he went on in much annoyance: "And with all this tumult and worry I
  had quite forgotten the most important thing of all: Marcus! He is like a
  possessed creature, and if I do not make a successful appeal to his
  conscience before he sleeps this night mischief will come of it. Yes, I am
  very tired; but duty before rest. It is of no use to contradict me, Mother.
  Get me my cloak; I must go to the lad." And a few minutes later the old man
  was making his way to the house in the Canopic street.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Dread and anxiety had taken possession of the merchant's
  household after Constantine had left them. Messengers came hurrying in, one
  after another, to request the presence of Olympius. A heathen secretary of
  Evagrius the Governor, had revealed what was astir, and the philosopher had
  at once prepared to return to the Serapeum. Porphyrius himself ordered his
  closed harmamaxa to be brought out, and undertook to fetch weapons and
  standards to the temple from a storehouse where they were laid by. This
  building stood on a plot of ground belonging to him in Rhacotis, behind a
  timber-yard which was accessible from the streets in front and behind, but
  sheltered from the public gaze by sheds and wood-stacks.</p>

  <p>The old aqueduct, which supplied the courts of sacrifice and the
  Subterranean crypts of the temple where the mysteries of Serapis were
  celebrated, passed close by the back-wall of this warehouse. Since the
  destruction of the watercourse, under the Emperor Julian, the underground
  conduit had been dry and empty, and a man by slightly stooping could readily
  pass through it unseen into the Serapeum. This mysterious passage had lately
  been secretly cleared out, and it was now to be used for the transport of the
  arms to the temple precincts.</p>

  <p>Damia had been present at the brief but vehement interview between her son
  and Olympius, and had thrown in a word now and again: "It is serious, very
  serious!" or, "Fight it out&mdash;no quarter!"</p>

  <p>The parting was evidently a very painful one to Olympius; when the
  merchant held out both his hands the older man clasped them in his and held
  them to his breast, saying: "Thanks, my friend; thanks for all you have done.
  We have lived&mdash;and if now we perish it is for the future happiness of
  our grandchildren. What would life be to you and me if it were marred by
  scourgings and questionings?&mdash;The omens read ill, and if I am not
  completely deceived we are at the beginning of the end. What lies beyond! ...
  we as philosophers must meet it calmly. The supreme Mind that governs us has
  planned the universe so well, that it is not likely that those things of
  which we now have no knowledge should not also be ordered for the best. The
  pinions of my soul beat indeed more freely and lightly as I foresee the
  moment when it shall be released from the burden of this flesh!"</p>

  <p>The High-Priest raised his arms as though indeed he were prepared to soar
  and uttered a fervent and inspired prayer in which he rehearsed to the gods
  all that he and his had done in their honor and vowed to offer them fresh
  sacrifices. His expressions were so lofty, and his flow of language so
  beautiful and free, that Porphyrius did not dare to interrupt him, though
  this long delay on the part of the leader of the cause made him intolerably
  anxious. When the old man&mdash;who was as emotional as a boy&mdash;ceased
  speaking, his white beard was wet with tears, and seeing that even Damia's
  and Gorgo's eyes were moist, he was preparing to address them again; but
  Porphyrius interposed. He gave him time only to press his lips to Datnia's
  hand and to bid Gorgo farewell.</p>

  <p>"You were born into stirring times," he said to her, "but under a good
  sign. Two worlds are in collision; which shall survive?&mdash;For you, my
  darling, I have but one wish: May you be happy!"</p>

  <p>He left the room and the merchant paced up and down lost in gloomy
  thoughts. Presently, as he caught his mother's eye fixed uneasily upon him,
  he murmured, less to her than to himself: "If he can think thus of what the
  end will be, who can still dare to hope?" Damia drew herself up in her
  chair.</p>

  <p>"I," she exclaimed passionately, "I&mdash;I dare, and I do hope and trust
  in the future. Is everything to perish which our forefathers planned and
  founded? Is this dismal superstition to overwhelm and bury the world and all
  that is bright and beautiful, as the lava stream rolled over the cities of
  Vesuvius? No, a thousand times no! Our retrograde and cowardly generation,
  which has lost all heart to enjoy life in sheer dread of future annihilation,
  may perhaps be doomed by the gods, as was that of Deucalion's day.
  Well&mdash;if so, what must be must! But such a world as they dream of never
  can, never will last. Let them succeed in their monstrous scheme! if the
  Temple of temples, the House of Serapis, were to be in ashes and the image of
  the mighty god to be dashed to pieces, what then... I say what then? Then
  indeed everything will be at an end&mdash;we, everybody; but they too, they,
  too, will perish."</p>

  <p>She clenched her fist with hatred and revenge and went on: "I know what I
  know&mdash;there are legible and infallible signs, and it is given to me to
  interpret them, and I tell you: It is true, unerringly true, as every
  Alexandrian child has learnt from its nurse: When Serapis falls the earth
  will collapse like a dry puff-ball under a horse's hoof. A hundred oracles
  have announced it, it is written in the prophecies of the heavenly bodies,
  and in the scroll of Fate. Let them be! Let it come! The end is sweet to
  those who, in the hour of death, can see the enemy thrust the sword into his
  own breast."</p>

  <p>The old woman sank back panting and gasping for breath, but Gorgo hastened
  to support her in her arms and she soon recovered. Hardly had she opened her
  eyes again than, seeing her son still in the room, she went on angrily:</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;here still? Do you think there is any time to spare? They will
  be waiting, waiting for you! You have the key and they need weapons."</p>

  <p>"I know what I am about," replied Porphyrius calmly. "All in good time. I
  shall be on the spot long before the youngsters have assembled. Cyrus will
  bring me the pass-words and signs; I shall send off the messengers, and then
  I shall still be in time for action."</p>

  <p>"Messengers! To whom?"</p>

  <p>"To Barkas. He is at the head of more than a thousand Libyan peasants and
  slaves. I shall send one, too, to Pachomius to bid him win us over adherents
  among the Biamite fishermen and the population of the eastern Delta."</p>

  <p>"Right, right&mdash;I know. Twenty talents&mdash;Pachomius is
  poor&mdash;twenty talents shall be his, out of my private coffer, if only
  they are here in time."</p>

  <p>"I would give ten, thirty times as much if they were only here now!" cried
  the merchant, giving way for the first time to the expression of his real
  feelings. "When I began life my father taught me the new superstitions. Its
  chains still hang about me; but in this fateful hour I feel more strongly
  than ever, and I mean to show, that I am faithful to the old gods. We will
  not be wanting; but alas! there is no escape for us now if the Imperial party
  are staunch. If they fall upon us before Barkas can join us, all is lost; if,
  on the contrary, Barkas comes at once and in time, there is still some hope;
  all may yet be well. What can a party of monks do? And as yet only our
  Constantine's heavy cavalry have come to the assistance of the two legions of
  the garrison."</p>

  <p>"Our Constantine!" shrieked Damia. "Whose? I ask you, whose? We have
  nothing to do with that miserable Christian!"</p>

  <p>But Gorgo turned upon her at once:</p>

  <p>"Indeed, grandmother," she exclaimed, quivering with rage, "but we have!
  He is a soldier and must do his duty; but he is fondly attached to us."</p>

  <p>"Us, us?" retorted the old woman with a laugh. "Has he sworn love to you,
  let me ask? Has he? and you-do you believe him, simple fool? I know him, I
  know him! Why, for a scrap of bread and a drop of wine from the hand of his
  priest he would see you and all of us plunged into misery! But see, here are
  the messengers."</p>

  <p>Porphyrius gave his instructions to the young men who now entered the
  hall, hurried them off, clasped Gorgo in a tender embrace and then bent over
  his mother to kiss her&mdash;a thing he had not done for many a day. Old
  Damia laid aside her stick, and taking her son's face in both her withered
  hands, muttered a few words which were half a fond appeal and half a magical
  formula, and then the women were alone. For a long while both were silent.
  The old woman sat sunk in her arm-chair while Gorgo stood with her back
  against the pedestal of a bust of Plato, gazing meditatively at the ground.
  At last it was Damia who spoke, asking to be carried into the women's
  rooms.</p>

  <p>Gorgo, however, stopped her with a gesture, went close to her and said:
  "No, wait a minute, mother; first you must hear what I have to say."</p>

  <p>"What you have to say?" asked her grandmother, shrugging her
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I have never deceived you; but one thing I have hitherto concealed
  from you because I was never till this morning sure of it myself&mdash;now I
  am. Now I know that I love him."</p>

  <p>"The Christian?" said the old woman, pushing aside a shade that screened
  her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Constantine; I will not hear you abuse him." Damia laughed sharply,
  and said in a tone of supreme scorn:</p>

  <p>"You will not? Then you had better stop your ears, my dear, for as long as
  my tongue can wag..."</p>

  <p>"Hush, grandmother, say no more," said the girl resolutely. "Do not
  provoke me with more than I can bear. Eros has pierced me later than he does
  most girls and has done it but once, but how deeply you can never know. If
  you speak ill of him you only aggravate the wound and you would not be so
  cruel! Do not&mdash;I entreat you; drop the subject or else..."</p>

  <p>"Or else?"</p>

  <p>"Or else I must die, mother&mdash;and you know you love me."</p>

  <p>Her tone was soft but firm; her words referred to the future, but that
  future was as clear to Gorgo's view as if it were past. Damia gave a hasty,
  sidelong glance at her grandchild, and a cold chill ran through her;
  the&mdash;girl stood and spoke with an air of inspiration&mdash;she was full
  of the divinity as Damia thought, and the old woman herself felt as though
  she were in a temple and in the immediate presence of the Immortals.</p>

  <p>Gorgo waited for a reply, but in vain; and as her grandmother remained
  silent she went back to her place by the pedestal. At last Damia raised her
  wrinkled face, looked straight in the girl's eyes and asked:</p>

  <p>"And what is to be the end of it?"</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;what?" said Gorgo gloomily and she shook her head. "I ask
  myself and can find no answer, for his image is ever present to me and yet
  walls and mountains stand between us. That face, that image&mdash;I might
  perhaps force myself to shatter it; but nothing shall ever induce me to let
  it be defiled or disgraced! Nothing!"</p>

  <p>The old woman sank into brooding thought once more; mechanically she
  repeated Gorgo's last word, and at intervals that gradually became longer she
  murmured, at last scarcely audibly: "Nothing&mdash;nothing!"</p>

  <p>She had lost all sense of time and of her immediate surroundings, and
  long-forgotten sorrows crowded on her memory: The dreadful day when a young
  freedman&mdash;a gifted astronomer and philosopher who had been appointed her
  tutor, and whom she had loved with all the passion of a vehement
  nature&mdash;had been kicked out of her father's house by slaves, for daring
  to aspire to her hand. She had given him up&mdash;she had been forced to do
  so; and after she was the wife of another and he had risen to fame, she had
  never given him any token that she had not forgotten him. Two thirds of a
  century lay between that happy and terrible time, and the present. He had
  been dead many a long year, and still she remembered him, and was thinking of
  him even now. A singular effort of fancy showed her herself, as she had then
  been, and Gorgo&mdash;whom she saw not with her bodily eyes, though the girl
  was standing in front of her&mdash;two young creatures side by side. The two
  were but one in her vision; the same anguish that embittered one life now
  threatened the other. But after all she, Damia, had dragged this grief after
  her through the weary decades, like the iron ball at the end of a chain which
  keeps the galley-slave to his place at the oar, and from which he can no more
  escape than from a ponderous and ever-present shadow; and Gorgo's sorrow
  could not at any rate be for long, since the end of all things was at
  hand&mdash;it was coming slowly but with inevitable certainty, nearer and
  nearer every hour.</p>

  <p>When had a troop of enthusiastic students and hastily-collected peasant-
  soldiers ever been able to snake an effectual stand against the hosts of
  Rome? Damia, who only a few minutes since had spoken with such determined
  encouragement to her son, had terrible visions of the Imperial legions
  putting Olympius to rout, with the Libyans under Barkas and the Biamite
  rabble under Pachomius; storming the Serapeum and reducing it to ruin:
  Firebrands flying through its sacred halls, the roof giving way, the vaults
  falling in; the sublime image of the god&mdash;the magnificent work of
  Bryaxis&mdash;battered by a hail of stones, and sinking to mingle with the
  reeking dust. Then a cry rose up from all nature, as though every star in
  heaven, every wave of ocean, every leaf of the forest, every blade in the
  meadow, every rock on the shore and every grain of sand in the measureless
  desert had found a voice; and this universal wail of "Woe, woe!" was drowned
  by rolling thunder such as the ear of man had never heard, and no mortal
  creature could hear and live. The heavens opened, and out of the black gulf
  of death-bearing clouds poured streams of fire; consuming flames rose to meet
  it from the riven womb of earth, rushing up to lick the sky. What had been
  air turned to fire and ashes, the silver and gold stars fell crashing from
  the firmament, and the heavens themselves bowed and collapsed, burying the
  ruined earth. Ashes, ashes, fine grey dusty ashes pervaded space, till
  presently a hurricane rose and swept away the chaos of gloom, and vast
  nothingness yawned before her: a bottomless abyss&mdash;an insatiable throat,
  swallowing down with greedy thirst all that was left; till where the world
  had been, with gods and men and all their works, there was only nothingness;
  hideous, inscrutable and unfathomable. And in it, above it, around
  it&mdash;for what are the dimensions of nothingness?&mdash;there reigned the
  incomprehensible Unity of the Primal One, in calm and pitiless self-
  concentration, beyond&mdash;the Real, nay even beyond the
  Conceivable&mdash;for conception implies plurality&mdash;the Supreme One of
  the Neo-Platonists to whose school she belonged.</p>

  <p>The old woman's blood ran cold and hot as she pictured the scene; but she
  believed in it, and chose to believe in it; "Nothing, nothing ..." which she
  had begun by muttering, insensibly changed to "Nothingness, nothingness!" and
  at last she spoke it aloud.</p>

  <p>Gorgo stood spellbound as she gazed at her grandmother. What had come over
  her? What was the meaning of this glaring eye, this gasping breath, this
  awful expression in her face, this convulsive action of her hands? Was she
  mad? And what did she mean by "Nothingness, nothingness..." repeated in a
  sort of hollow cry?</p>

  <p>Terrified beyond bearing she laid her hand on Dalnia's shoulder, saying:
  "Mother, mother! wake up! What do you mean by saying 'nothingness,
  nothingness' in that dreadful way?"</p>

  <p>Dainia collected her scattered wits, shivered with cold and then said,
  dully at first, but with a growing cheerfulness that made Gorgo's blood run
  cold: "Did I say 'nothingness'? Did I speak of the great void, my child? You
  are quick of hearing. Nothingness&mdash;well, you have learnt to think; are
  you capable of defining the meaning of the word&mdash;a monster that has
  neither head nor tail, neither front nor back&mdash;can you, I say, define
  the idea of nothingness?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, mother?" said Gorgo with growing alarm.</p>

  <p>"No, she does not know, she does not understand," muttered the old woman
  with a dreary smile. "And yet Melampus told me, only yesterday, that you
  understood his lesson on conic sections better than many men. Aye, aye,
  child; I, too, learnt mathematics once, and I still go through various
  calculations every night in my observatory; but to this day I find it
  difficult to conceive of a mathematical point. It is nothing and yet it is
  something. But the great final nothingness!&mdash;And that even is nonsense,
  for it can be neither great nor small, and come neither sooner nor later. Is
  it not so, my sweet? Think of nothing&mdash;who cannot do that; but it is
  very hard to imagine nothingness. We can neither of us achieve that. Not even
  the One has a place in it. But what is the use of racking our brains? Only
  wait till to-morrow or the day after; something will happen then which will
  reduce our own precious persons and this beautiful world to that nothingness
  which to-day is inconceivable. It is coming; I can hear from afar the brazen
  tramp of the airy and incorporeal monster. A queer sort of
  giant&mdash;smaller than the mathematical point of which we were speaking,
  and yet vast beyond all measurement. Aye, aye; our intelligence, polyp-like,
  has long arms and can apprehend vast size and wide extent; but it can no more
  conceive of nothingness than it can of infinite space or time.</p>

  <p>"I was dreaming that this monstrous Nought had come to his kingdom and was
  opening a yawning mouth and toothless jaws to swallow its all down into the
  throat that it has not got&mdash;you, and me, and your young officer, with
  this splendid, recreant city and the sky and the earth. Wait, only wait! The
  glorious image of Serapis still stands radiant, but the cross casts an
  ominous shadow that has already darkened the light over half the earth! Our
  gods are an abomination to Caesar, and Cynegius only carries out his
  wishes..."</p>

  <p>Here Damia was interrupted by the steward, who rushed breathless into the
  room, exclaiming:</p>

  <p>"Lost! All is lost! An edict of Theodosius commands that every temple of
  the gods shall be closed, and the heavy cavalry have dispersed our
  force."</p>

  <p>"Ah ha!" croaked the old woman in shrill accents. "You see, you see! There
  it is: the beginning of the end! Yes&mdash;your cavalry are a powerful force.
  They are digging a grave&mdash;wide and deep, with room in it for many: for
  you, for me, and for themselves, too, and for their Prefect.&mdash;Call
  Argus, man, and carry me into the Gynaeconitis* and there tell us what has
  happened." In the women's room the steward told all he knew, and a sad tale
  it was; one thing, however, gave him some comfort: Olympius was at the
  Serapeunt and had begun to fortify the temple, and garrison it with a strong
  force of adherents.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The women's apartment. ]</p>

  <p>Damia had definitively given up all hope, and hardly heeded this part of
  his story, while on Gorgo's mind it had a startling effect. She loved
  Constantine with all the fervor of a first, and only, and long-suppressed
  passion; she had repented long since of her little fit of suspicion, and it
  would have cost her no perceptible effort to humble her pride, to fly to him
  and pray for forgiveness. But she could not&mdash;dared not&mdash;now, when
  everything was at stake, renounce her fidelity to the gods for whose sake she
  had let him leave her in anger, and to whom she must cling, cost what it
  might; that would be a base desertion. If Olympius were to triumph in the
  struggle she might go to her lover and say: "Do you remain a Christian, and
  leave me the creed of my childhood, or else open my heart to yours." But, as
  matters now stood, her first duty was to quell her passion and retrain
  faithful to the end, even though the cause were lost. She was Greek to the
  backbone; she knew it and felt it, and yet her eye had sparkled with pride as
  she heard the steward's tale, and she seemed to see Constantine at the head
  of his horsemen, rushing upon the heathen and driving them to the four winds
  like a flock of sheep. Her heart beat high for the foe rather than for her
  hapless friends&mdash;these were but bruised reeds&mdash;those were the
  incarnation of victorious strength.</p>

  <p>These divided feelings worried and vexed her; but her grandmother had
  suggested a way of reconciling them. Where he commanded victory followed, and
  if the Christians should succeed in destroying the image of Serapis the
  joints of the world would crack and the earth would crumble away. She herself
  was familiar with the traditions and the oracles which with one consent
  foretold this doom; she had learnt them as an infant from her nurse, from the
  slave-women at the loom, from learned men and astute philosophers&mdash;and
  to her the horrible prophecy meant a solution of every contradiction and the
  bitter-sweet hope of perishing with the man she loved.</p>

  <p>As it grew dark another person appeared: the Moschosphragist* from the
  temple of Serapis, who, every day, examined the entrails of a slaughtered
  beast for Damia; to-day the augury had been so bad that he was almost afraid
  of revealing it. But the old woman, sure of it beforehand, took his
  soothsaying quite calmly, and only desired to be carried up to her
  observatory that she might watch the risings of the stars.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The examiner of sacrificed animals. ]</p>

  <p>Gorgo remained alone below. From the adjoining workrooms came the
  monotonous rattle of the loom at which, as usual, a number of slaves were
  working.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the clatter ceased. Damia had sent a slave-girl down to say that
  they might leave off work and rest till next day if they chose. She had
  ordered that wine should be distributed to them in the great hall, as freely
  as at the great festival of Dionysus.</p>

  <p>All was silent in the Gynaeconitis. The garlands of flowers, which Gorgo
  herself had helped some damsels of her acquaintance to twine for the temple
  of Isis, lay in a heap-the steward had told her that the venerable sanctuary
  was to be closed and surrounded by soldiers. This then put an end to the
  festival; and she could have been heartily glad, for it relieved her of the
  necessity of defying Constantine; still, it was with tender melancholy that
  she thought of the gentle goddess in whose sanctuary she had so often found
  comfort and support. She could remember, as a tiny child, gathering the first
  flowers in her little garden, and sticking them in the ground near the tank
  from which water was fetched for libations in the temple; with the
  pocketmoney given her by her elders, she had bought perfumes to pour on the
  altars of the divinity; and often when her heart was heavy she had found
  relief in prayer before the marble statue of the goddess. How splendid had
  the festivals of Isis been, how gladly and rapturously had she sung in their
  honor! Almost everything that had lent poetry and dignity to her childhood
  had been bound up with Isis and her sanctuary&mdash;and now it was closed and
  the image of the divine mother was perhaps lying in fragments in the
  dirt!</p>

  <p>Gorgo knew all the lofty ideals which lay at the foundation of the worship
  of this goddess; but it was not to them that she had turned for help, but to
  the image in whose mystical strength she trusted. And what had already been
  done to Isis and her temple might soon be done to Serapis and to his
  house.</p>

  <p>She could not bear the thought, for she had been accustomed to regard the
  Serapeum as the very heart of the universe&mdash;the centre and fulcrum on
  which the balance of the earth depended; to her, Serapis himself was
  inseparable from his temple and its atmosphere of magical and mystical power.
  Every prophecy, every Sibylline text, every oracle must be false if the
  overthrow of that image could remain unpunished&mdash;if the destruction of
  the universe failed to follow, as surely as a flood ensues from a breach in a
  dyke. How indeed could it be otherwise, according to the explanation which
  her teacher had given her of the Neo-Platonic conception of the nature of the
  god?</p>

  <p>It was not Serapis but the great and unapproachable One&mdash;supreme
  above comprehension and sublime beyond conception, for whose majesty every
  name was too mean, the fount and crown of Good and Beauty, in whole all that
  exists ever has been and ever shall be. He it was who, like a brimful vessel,
  overflowed with the quintessence of what we call divine; and from this
  effluence emanated the divine Mind, the pure intelligence which is to the One
  what light is to the sun. This Mind with its vitality&mdash;a life not of
  time but of eternity&mdash;could stir or remain passive as it listed; it
  included a Plurality, while the One was Unity, and forever indivisible. The
  concept of each living creature proceeded from the second: The eternal Mind;
  and this vivifying and energizing intelligence comprehended the prototypes of
  every living being, hence, also, of the immortal gods&mdash;not themselves
  but their idea or image. And just as the eternal Mind proceeded from the One,
  so, in the third place, did the Soul of the universe proceed from the second;
  that Soul whose twofold nature on one side touched the supreme Mind, and, on
  the other, the baser world of matter. This was the immortal Aphrodite,
  cradled in bliss in the pure radiance of the ideal world and yet unable to
  free herself from the gross clay of matter fouled by sensuality and the
  vehicle of sin.</p>

  <p>The head of Serapis was the eternal Mind; in his broad breast slept the
  Soul of the Universe, and the prototypes of all created things; the world of
  matter was the footstool under his feet. All the subordinate forces obeyed
  him, the mighty first Cause, whose head towered up to the realm of the
  incomprehensible and inconceivable One. He was the sum total of the universe,
  the epitome of things created; and at the same time he was the power which
  gave them life and intelligence and preserved them from perishing by
  perpetual procreation. It was his might that kept the multiform structure of
  the material and psychical world in perennial harmony. All that
  lived&mdash;Nature and its Soul as much as Man and his Soul&mdash;were
  inseparably dependent on him. If he&mdash;if Serapis were to fall, the order
  of the universe must be destroyed; and with him: The Synthesis of the
  Universe&mdash;the Universe itself must cease to exist.</p>

  <p>But what would survive would not be the nothingness&mdash;the void of
  which her grandmother had spoken; it would be the One&mdash;the cold,
  ineffable, incomprehensible One! This world would perish with Serapis; but
  perhaps it might please that One to call another world into being out of his
  overflowing essence, peopled by other and different beings.</p>

  <p>Gorgo was startled out of these meditations by a wild tumult which came up
  from the slaves' hall some distance off and reached her ears in the women's
  sitting-room. Could her grandmother have opened the wine stores all too
  freely; were the miserable wretches already drunk?</p>

  <p>No, the noise was not that of a troop of slaves who have forgotten
  themselves, and given the rein to their wild revelry under the influence of
  Dionysus! She listened and could distinctly hear lamentable howls and wild
  cries of grief. Something frightful must have happened! Had some evil
  befallen her father? Greatly alarmed she flew across the courtyard to the
  slaves' quarters and found the whole establishment, black and white alike, in
  a state of frenzy. The women were rushing about with their hair unbound over
  their faces, beating their breasts and wailing, the men squatted in silence
  with their wine-cups before them untouched, softly sobbing and whining.</p>

  <p>What had come upon them&mdash;what blow had fallen on the house?</p>

  <p>Gorgo called her old nurse and learnt from her that the Moschosphragist
  had just told them that the troops had been placed all round the Serapeum and
  that the Emperor had commanded the Prefect of the East to lay violent hands
  on the temple of the King of gods. Today or to-morrow the crime was to be
  perpetrated. They had been warned to pray and repent of their sins, for at
  the moment when the holiest sanctuary on earth should fall the whole world
  would crumble into nothingness. The entrails of the beast sacrificed by Damia
  had been black as though scorched, and a terrific groan had been heard from
  the god himself in the great shrine; the pillars of the great hypostyle had
  trembled and the three heads of Cerberus, lying at the feet of Serapis; had
  opened their jaws.</p>

  <p>Gorgo listened in silence to the old woman's story; and all she said in
  reply was: "Let them wail."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The day had flown swiftly for Dada under the roof of Medius;
  there were costumes and scenery in wonderful variety for her to look over;
  the children were bright and friendly, and she had enjoyed playing with them,
  for all her little tricks and rhymes, which Papias was familiar with by this
  time, were to them new and delightful. It amused her, too, to see what the
  domestic difficulties were of which the singer had described himself as being
  a victim.</p>

  <p>Medius was one of those men who buy everything that strikes them as
  cheap&mdash;for instance, that very morning, at Kibotus he had stood to watch
  a fish auction and had bought a whole tub-full of pickled fish for "a mere
  trifle;" but when, presently, the cargo was delivered, his wife flew into a
  great rage, which she vented first on the innocent lad who brought the fish,
  and then on the less innocent purchaser. They would not get to the bottom of
  the barrel and eat the last herring, she asserted, till they were a century
  old. Medius, while he disputed so monstrous a statement, vehemently declared
  that such wholesome and nutritious food as those fish was undoubtedly
  calculated to prolong the lives of the whole family to an exceptionally great
  age.</p>

  <p>This discussion, which was not at all by way of a jest, amused Dada far
  more than the tablets, cylinders and cones covered with numbers and
  cabalistic signs, to which Medius tried to direct her attention. She darted
  off in the midst of his eager explanations to show his grandchildren how a
  rabbit sniffs and moves his ears when he is offered a cabbage-leaf.</p>

  <p>The report, which reached them in the afternoon, of the proceedings in the
  square by the Prefect's house, disturbed Medius greatly, and he set off at
  once for the scene of action.</p>

  <p>He did not return till evening, and then he looked like an altered man. He
  must have witnessed something very terrible, for his face was as pale as
  death, and his usually confident and swaggering manner had given place to a
  stricken and care-worn air. He walked up and down the room, groaning as he
  went; he flung himself on the divan and stared fixedly at the ground; he
  wandered into the atrium and gazed cautiously out on the street. Dada's
  presence seemed suddenly to be the source of much anxiety to him, and the
  girl, painfully conscious of this, hastened to tell him that she would prefer
  to return home at once to her uncle and aunt.</p>

  <p>"You can please yourself," was all he said, with a shrug and a sigh. "You
  may stay for aught I care. It is all the same now!"</p>

  <p>So far his wife had left him to himself, for she was used to his violent
  and eccentric behavior whenever anything had crossed him; but now she
  peremptorily desired to be informed what had happened to him and he at once
  acceded. He had been unwilling to frighten them sooner than was needful, but
  they must learn it sooner or later: Cynegius had arrived to overthrow the
  image of Serapis, and what must ensue they knew only too well. "To-day," he
  cried, "we will live; but by to-morrow&mdash;a thousand to one-by to-morrow
  there will be an end of all our joys and the earth will swallow up the old
  home and us with it!"</p>

  <p>His words fell on prepared ground; his wife and daughter were appalled,
  and as Medius went on to paint the imminent catastrophe in more vivid colors,
  his energy growing in proportion to its effect on them, they began at first
  to sob and whimper and then to wail loudly. When the children, who by this
  time were in bed, heard the lamentations of their elders, they, too, set up a
  howl, and even Dada caught the infection. As for Medius himself, he had
  talked himself into such a state of terror by his own descriptions of the
  approaching destruction of the world that he abandoned all claim to his proud
  reputation as a strong-minded man, and quite forgot his favorite theory that
  everything that went by the name of God was a mere invention of priests and
  rulers to delude and oppress the ignorant; at last he even went so far as to
  mutter a prayer, and when his wife begged to be allowed to join a family of
  neighbors in sacrificing a black lamb at daybreak, he recklessly gave her a
  handful of money.</p>

  <p>None of the party closed an eye that night. Dada could not bear to remain
  in the house. Perhaps all these horrors existed only in Medius' fancy; but if
  destruction were indeed impending, she would a thousand times rattier perish
  with her own relations than with these people, in whom there was
  something&mdash;she did not know what&mdash;for which she felt a deep
  aversion. This she explained to her host early in the day and he was ready to
  set out at once and restore her to the care of Karnis.</p>

  <p>In fact, the purpose for which he had needed her must certainly come to
  nothing. He himself was attached to the service of Posidonius, a great
  magician and wizard, to whom half Alexandria flocked&mdash;Christians, Jews,
  and heathens&mdash;in order to communicate with the dead, with gods and with
  demons, to obtain spells and charms by which to attract lovers or injure
  foes, to learn the art of becoming invisible, or to gain a glimpse into the
  future. In the performance which was being planned Dada was to have appeared
  to a bereaved mother as the glorified presence of her lost daughter; but the
  disturbance in the city had driven the matron, who was rich, to take refuge
  in the country the previous afternoon. Nor was it likely that the sorcerer's
  other clients&mdash;even if all turned out better than could be
  hoped&mdash;would venture into the streets by night. Rich people were timid
  and suspicious; and as the Emperor had lately promulgated fresh and more
  stringent edicts against the magic arts, Posidonius had thought it prudent to
  postpone the meeting. Hence Medius had at present no use for the girl; but he
  affected to agree so readily to her wishes merely out of anxiety to relieve
  Isarnis as soon as possible of his uneasiness as to her fate.</p>

  <p>The morning was bright and hot, and the town was swarming with an excited
  mob soon after sunrise. Terror, curiosity and defiance were painted on every
  face; however, Medius and his young companion made their way unhindered as
  far as the temple of Isis by the lake. The doors of the sanctuary were
  closed, and guarded by soldiers; but the southern and western walls were
  surrounded by thousands and thousands of heathen. Some hundreds, indeed, had
  passed the night there in prayer, or in sheer terror of the catastrophe which
  could not fail to ensue, and they were kneeling in groups, groaning, weeping,
  and cursing, or squatting in stolid resignation, weary, crushed and hopeless.
  It was a heart-rending sight, and neither Dada&mdash;who till this moment had
  been dreading Dame Herse's scolding tongue far more than the destruction of
  the world&mdash;nor her companion could forbear joining in the wail that rose
  from this vast multitude. Medius fell on his knees groaning aloud and pulled
  the girl down beside him; for, upon the wall that enclosed the temple
  precincts, they now saw a priest who, after holding the sacred Sistrum up to
  view and muttering some unintelligible prayers and invocations, proceeded to
  address the people.</p>

  <p>He was a short stout man, and the sweat streamed down his face as he stood
  under the blazing sun to sketch a fearful picture of the monstrous doom which
  was hanging over the city and its inhabitants. He spoke with pompous
  exaggeration, in a shrill, harsh voice, wiping his face meanwhile with his
  white linen robe or gasping for air, when breath failed him, like a fish
  stranded on the beach. All this, however, did not trouble his audience, for
  the hatred that inspired his language, and the terror of the immediate future
  which betrayed itself in every word exactly reflected their feelings. Dada
  alone was moved to mirth; the longer she looked at him the more she felt
  inclined to laugh; besides, the day was so bright&mdash;a pigeon on the wall
  pattered round his mate, nodding and wriggling after the funny manner of
  pigeons in love&mdash;and, above all, her heart beat so high and she had such
  a happy instinctive feeling that all was ordered for the best, that the world
  seemed to her a beautiful and fairly secure dwelling-place, in spite of the
  dark forebodings of the zealous preacher. On the eve of destruction the earth
  must surely look differently from this; and it struck her as highly
  improbable that the gods should have revealed their purpose to such a queer
  old driveller as this priest, and have hidden it from other men. The very
  fact that this burly personage should prophesy evil with such conviction made
  her doubt it; and presently, when the plumes of three or four helmets became
  visible behind the speaker, and a pair of strong hands grasped his thick
  ancles and suddenly dragged him down from his eminence and back into the
  temple, she could hardly keep herself from laughing outright.</p>

  <p>Now, however, there was more real cause for alarm a trumpet-blast was
  heard, and a maniple of the twenty-second legion marched down in close order
  on the crowd who fled before them. Medius was one of the first to make off;
  Dada kept close to his side, and when, in his alarm, he fairly took to his
  heels, she did the same; for, in spite of the reception she apprehended, she
  felt that the sooner she could rejoin her own people the better. Never till
  now had she known how dear they were to her. Herse might scold; but her
  sharpest words were truer and better than the smooth flattery of Medius. It
  was a joy to think of seeing them again&mdash;Agne, too, and little
  Papias&mdash;and she felt as though she were about to meet them after years
  of separation.</p>

  <p>By this time they were at the ship-yard, which was divided only by a lane
  from the Temple-grove; there lay the barge. Dada pulled off her veil and
  waved it in the air, but the signal met with no response. They were at the
  house, no doubt, for some men were in the very act of drawing up the wooden
  gangway which connected the vessel with the land. Medius hurried forward and
  was so fortunate as to overtake the steward, who had been superintending the
  operation, before he reached the garden-gate.</p>

  <p>The old man was rejoiced to see them, and told them at once that his old
  mistress had promised Herse to give Dada shelter if she should return to
  them. But Dada was proud. She had no liking for Gorgo or her grandmother; and
  when she had caught up to Medius, quite out of breath, she positively refused
  the old lady's hospitality.</p>

  <p>The barge was deserted. Karnis&mdash;so the steward informed her&mdash;had
  withdrawn to the temple of Serapis with his son, intending to assist in its
  defence; and Herse had accompanied them, for Olympius had said that women
  would be found useful in the beleaguered sanctuary, in preparing food for the
  combatants and in nursing the wounded.</p>

  <p>Dada stood looking at their floating home, utterly disappointed and
  discouraged. She longed to follow her aunt and to gain admission to the
  Serapeutn; but how could she do this now, and of what use could she hope to
  be? There was nothing heroic in her composition, and from her infancy she had
  always sickened at the sight of blood. She had no alternative but to return
  with Medius, and take refuge under his roof.</p>

  <p>The singer gave her ample time for reflection; he had seated himself, with
  the steward, under the shade of a sycamore, and the two men were absorbed in
  convincing each other, by a hundred arguments which they had picked up during
  the last day or two, how inevitably the earth must be annihilated if the
  statue of Serapis should be overthrown. In the warmth of their discussion
  they paid no heed to the young girl, who was sitting on a fallen Hermes by
  the road-side. Her vigorous and lively temperament rendered her little apt to
  dream, or even meditate, in broad daylight; but the heat and the recent
  excitement had overwrought her and she felt into a drowsy reverie. Now and
  again, as her heavy head drooped on her breast, she fancied the Serapeum had
  actually fallen; then, as she raised it again, she recovered her
  consciousness that it was hot, that she had lost her home, and that she must,
  however unwillingly, return with Medius. But at length her eyelids closed,
  and as she sat in the full blaze of the sun, a rosy light filled her eyes and
  a bright vision floated before her: Marcus took the modius&mdash;the corn
  measure&mdash;from the head of the statue of Serapis and offered it to her;
  it was quite full of lilies and roses and violets, and she was delighted with
  the flowers and thanked him warmly when he set the modius down before her. He
  held out his hands to her calmly and kindly, and she gave him hers, feeling
  very happy under the steady, compassionate gaze of his large eyes which had
  often watched her, on board ship, for some minutes at a time. She longed to
  say something to him, but she could not speak; and she looked on quite
  unmoved as the statue of the god and the hall in which it stood were wrapt in
  flames. No smoke mingled with this clear and genial blaze, but it compelled
  her to shade her dazzled eyes; and as she lifted her hand she woke to see
  Medius standing in front of her.</p>

  <p>He desired her to come home with him at once, and she rose to obey,
  listening in silence to his assurances that the lives of Karnis and Orpheus
  would not be worth a sesterce if they fell into the hands of the Roman
  soldiers.</p>

  <p>She walked on, more hopeless and depressed than she had ever felt in her
  life before, past the unfinished hulks in the ship-yard where no one was at
  work to-day when, coming down the lane that divided the wharf from the temple
  precincts, she saw an old man and a little boy. She had not time to ask
  herself whether she saw rightly or was mistaken before the child caught sight
  of her, snatched his hand away from that of his companion, and flew towards
  her, shouting her name. In the next moment little Papias had rushed
  rapturously into her arms and, as she lifted him up, had thrown his hands
  round her neck, clinging to her as if he would never leave go again, while
  she hugged him closely for joy, and kissed him with her eyes full of tears.
  She was herself again at once; the sad and anxious girl was the lively Dada
  once more.</p>

  <p>The man who had been leading the little boy was immediately besieged with
  questions, and from his answers they learnt that he had found the child the
  evening before at the corner of a street, crying bitterly; that he had taken
  him home, and with some little difficulty had ascertained from him that he
  belonged to some people who were living on board a barge, close to a
  ship-yard. In spite of the excitement that prevailed he had brought the child
  home as soon as possible, for he could fancy how anxious his parents must be.
  Dada thanked the kind-hearted artisan with sincere warmth, and the man,
  seeing how happy the girl and the child were at having met, went his way
  quite satisfied.</p>

  <p>Medius had stood by and had said nothing, but he looked on the pretty
  little boy with much favor. If the earth were not to crumble into nothingness
  after all, this child would be a real treasure trove; and when Dada begged
  him to find a corner for Papias in his house, though he hinted at the
  smallness of his earnings and the limited space at his command, he yielded,
  if reluctantly, to her entreaties, on her offering him her gold brooch to
  cover his expenses.</p>

  <p>As they made their way back she cast many loving glances at the child; she
  was extremely fond of him, and he seemed a link to bind her to her own
  people.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The singer's wife and daughter had joined some neighbors in
  sacrificing a black lamb to Zeus, a ceremony that was usual on the occasion
  of earthquakes or very severe storms; but it was done very secretly, for the
  edicts prohibiting the sacrifice of victims to the gods were promptly and
  rigidly enforced. The more the different members of the family came into
  contact with other citizens, the more deeply rooted was their terror that the
  end of all things was at hand. As soon as it was dark the old man buried all
  his savings, for even if everyone else were to perish, he felt that
  he&mdash;though how or why he knew not&mdash;might be exempt from the common
  doom.</p>

  <p>The night was warm, and great and small alike slept&mdash;or lay
  awake&mdash;under the stars so as not to be overwhelmed by the crash of roofs
  and walls; the next day was oppressively hot, and the family cowered in a row
  in the scanty shade of a palm and of a fig-tree, the only growth of any size
  in the singer's garden. Medius himself, in spite of the scorching sun, could
  not be still.</p>

  <p>He rushed off to the town again and again, but only to return each time to
  enhance the anguish of the household by relating all sorts of horrors which
  he had picked up in his wanderings. They were obliged to satisfy their hunger
  with bread, cheese, and fruit, for the two slave-women positively refused to
  risk their lives by cooking in the house.</p>

  <p>Medius' temper varied as he came and went; now he was gentle and
  affectionate, and then again he raged like a madman; and his wife outdid him.
  At one moment she would abandon him and the children, while she anointed the
  household altar and put up prayers; at the next she railed at the baseness
  and cruelty of the gods. When her husband brought the news that the Serapeum
  was surrounded by the Imperial troops, she scoffed and spit at the sacred
  images, and five minutes later she was vowing a sacrifice to the deities of
  Olympus. The general confusion was distracting; as the sun rose, the anguish,
  physical and mental, of the whole family greatly increased, and by noon had
  reached an appalling pitch.</p>

  <p>Dada looked on intensely disgusted, and only shook her head when one or
  another of her companions was sure she felt a shock of earthquake or heard
  the roll of distant thunder. She could not explain to herself why she, who
  was usually timid enough, was exempt from the universal panic though she felt
  deeply pitiful towards the terrified women and children. None of them
  troubled themselves about her; the day dragged on with intolerable slowness,
  quenching all her gay vivacity, while she was utterly exhausted by the
  scorching African sun, of which, till now, she had never known the power. At
  last, in the afternoon, she found the little garden, which was by this time
  heated like an oven, quite unbearable, and she looked round for Papias. The
  child was sitting on the wall looking at the congregation streaming into the
  basilica of St. Mark. Dada followed his example, and when the many-voiced
  psalms rang out of the open door of the church, she listened to the music,
  for it seemed long since she had heard any, and after wiping the perspiration
  from the little boy's face with her peplos, she pointed to the building and
  said: "It must be nice and cool in there."</p>

  <p>"Of course it is," said Papias.</p>

  <p>"It is never too hot in church. I will tell you what&mdash;we will go
  there." This was a bright idea; for, thought Dada, any place must be
  pleasanter than this; and she felt strongly tempted, too, to see the inside
  of one of Agne's temples and to sing once more, or, at any rate, hear others
  sing.</p>

  <p>"Come along," she said, and they stole through the deserted house to get
  into the street by the atrium. Medius saw them, but he made no attempt to
  detain them; he had sunk into lethargic indifference. It was not an hour
  since he had taken stock of his life and means, setting the small figure of
  his average income against his hospitality to Dada and her little companion;
  but then, again, he had calculated that, if all went well, he might make
  considerable profits out of the girl and the child. Now, he felt it was all
  the same to him whether he and his family and Dada met their doom in the
  house or out of it.</p>

  <p>Dada and Papias soon reached the church of St. Mark, the oldest Christian
  basilica in the city. It consisted of a vestibule&mdash;the narthex&mdash;and
  the body of the church, a very long hall, with a flat roof ceiled with
  stained wood and supported on a double row of quite simple columns. This
  space was divided into two parts by a screen of pierced work; the innermost
  portion had a raised floor or podium, on which stood a table with chairs
  placed round it in a semicircle. The centre seat was higher and more richly
  decorated than the others. These chairs were unoccupied; a few deacons in
  'talares' of light-colored brocade were busied about the table.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the vestibule there was a small tank; here a number of
  penitents had collected who, with their flayed ribs and abject lamentations,
  offered a more melancholy spectacle than even the terrified crowd whom Dada
  had seen the day before, gathered round the temple of Isis. Indeed, site
  would have withdrawn at once but that Papias dragged her forward, and when
  she had passed through the great door into the nave she breathed a sigh of
  relief. A soothing sense of respite came over her, such as she had rarely
  felt; for the lofty building, which was only half full, was deliciously cool
  and the subdued light was restful to her eyes. The slight perfume of incense
  and the sober singing of the assembled worshippers were soothing to her
  senses, and, as she took a seat on one of the benches, she felt sheltered and
  safe.</p>

  <p>The old church struck her as a home of perfect peace; in all the city, she
  thought, there could hardly be another spot where she might rest so quietly
  and contentedly. So for some little time she gave herself up, body and soul,
  to the refreshing influences of the coolness, the solemnity, the fragrance
  and the music; but presently her attention was attracted to two women in the
  seats just in front of her.</p>

  <p>One of them, who had a child on her arm, whispered to her neighbor:</p>

  <p>"You here, Hannah, among the unbaptized? How are you going on at
  home?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot stay long," was the answer. "It is all the same where one sits,
  and when I leave I shall disturb no one. But my heart is heavy; the child is
  very bad. The doctor says he cannot live through the day, and I felt as if I
  must come to church."</p>

  <p>"Very right, very right. Do you stay here and I will go to your house at
  once; my husband will not mind waiting."</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much, but Katharine is staying with the boy and he is
  quite safe there."</p>

  <p>"Then I will stay and pray with you for the dear little child."</p>

  <p>Dada had not missed a word of this simple dialogue. The woman whose child
  was ill at home, and who had come here to pray for strength or mercy, had a
  remarkably sweet face; as the girl saw the two friends bow their heads and
  fold their hands with downcast eyes, she thought to herself: "Now they are
  praying for the sick child ..." and involuntarily she, too, bent her curly
  head, and murmured softly: "O ye gods, or thou God of the Christians, or
  whatever thou art called that hast power over life and death, make this poor
  woman's little son well again. When I get home again I will offer up a cake
  or a fowl&mdash;a lamb is so costly."</p>

  <p>And she fancied that some invisible spirit heard her, and it gave her a
  vague satisfaction to repeat her simple supplication over and over again.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile a miserable blind dwarf had seated himself by her side; near him
  stood the old dog that guided him. He held him by a string and had been
  allowed to bring his indispensable comrade into the church. The old man
  joined loudly and devoutly in the psalm which the rest of the congregation
  were singing; his voice had lost its freshness, no doubt, but he sang in
  perfect tune. It was a pleasure to Dada to listen, and though she only half
  understood the words of the psalm she easily caught the air and began to sing
  too, at first timidly and hardly audibly; but she soon gained courage and,
  following the example of little Papias, joined in with all her might.</p>

  <p>She felt as though she had reached land after a stormy and uncomfortable
  voyage, and had found refuge in a hospitable home; she looked about her to
  discover whether the news of the approaching destruction of the world had not
  penetrated even here, but she could not feel certain; for, though many faces
  expressed anguish of mind, contrition, and a passionate desire&mdash;perhaps
  for help or, perhaps, for something quite different&mdash;not a cry of
  lamentation was to be heard, such as had rent the air by the temple of Isis,
  and most of the men and women assembled here were singing, or praying in
  silent absorption. There were none of the frenzied monks who had terrified
  her in the Xenodochium and in the streets; on this day of tumult and anxiety
  they are devoting all their small strength and great enthusiasm to the
  service of the Church militant.</p>

  <p>This meeting, at so unusual an hour, had been convened by Eusebius, the
  deacon of the district, with the intention of calming the spirits of those
  who had caught the general infection of alarm. Dada could see the old man
  step up into a raised pulpit on the inner side of the screen which parted the
  baptized from the unbaptized members of the congregation; his silvery hair
  and beard, and the cheerful calm of his face, with the high white forehead
  and gentle, loving gaze, attracted her greatly. She had heard Karnis speak of
  Plato, and knew by heart some axioms of his doctrine, and she had always
  thought of the sage as a young man; but in advanced age, she fancied, he
  might have looked like Eusebius. Aye, and it would have well beseemed this
  old man to die, like the great Athenian, at a mirthful wedding-feast.</p>

  <p>The priest was evidently about to give a discourse, and much as she
  admired him, this idea prompted her to quit the church; for, though she could
  sit still for hours to hear music, she found nothing more irksome than to be
  compelled to listen for any length of time to a speech she might not
  interrupt. She was therefore rising to leave; but Papias held her back and
  entreated her so pathetically with his blue baby-eyes not to take him away
  and spoil his pleasure that she yielded, though the opportunity was favorable
  for moving unobserved, as the woman in front of her was preparing to go and
  was shaking hands with her neighbor. She had indeed risen from her seat when
  a little girl came in behind her and whispered, loud enough for Dada's keen
  ears to catch the words: "Come mother, come home at once. He has opened his
  eyes and called for you. The physician says all danger is over."</p>

  <p>The mother in her turn whispered to her friend in glad haste: "All is
  well!" and hurried away with the girl. The friend she had left raised her
  hands and eyes in thanksgiving, and Dada, too, smiled in sympathy and
  pleasure. Had the God of the Christian heard her prayer with theirs.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the preacher had ended his preliminary prayer and began to
  explain to his hearers that he had bidden them to the church in order to warn
  them against foolish terrors, and to lead them into the frame of mind in
  which the true Christian ought to live in these momentous times of
  disturbance. He wished to point out to his brethren and sisters in the Lord
  what was to be feared from the idols and their overthrow, what the world
  really owed to the heathen, and what he expected from his fellow-believers
  when the splendid and imminent triumph of the Church should be achieved.</p>

  <p>"Let us look back a little, my beloved," he said, after this brief
  introduction. "You have all heard of the great Alexander, to whom this noble
  city owes its existence and its name. He was a mighty instrument in the hand
  of the Lord, for he carried the tongue and the wisdom of the Greeks
  throughout all lands, so that, in the fulness of time, the doctrine which
  should proceed from the only Son of God might be understood by all nations
  and go home to all hearts. In those days every people had its own idols by
  hundreds, and in every tongue on earth men put up their prayers to the
  supreme Power which makes itself felt wherever mortal creatures dwell. Here,
  by the Nile, after Alexander's death, reigned the Ptolemies; and the Egyptian
  citizens of Alexandria prayed to other gods than their Greek neighbors, so
  that they could never unite in worshipping their divinities; but
  Philadelphus, the second Ptolemy, a very wise man, gave them a god in common.
  In consequence of a vision seen in a dream he had the divinity brought from
  Sinope, on the shores of Pontus, to this town. This idol was Serapis, and he
  was raised to the throne of divinity here, not by Heaven, but by a shrewd and
  prudent man; a grand temple was built for him, which is to this day one of
  the wonders of the world, and a statue of him was made, as beautiful as any
  image ever formed by the hand of man. You have seen and know them both, and
  you know too, how, before the gospel was preached in Alexandria, crowds of
  all classes, excepting the Jews, thronged the Serapeum.</p>

  <p>"A dim perception of the sublime teaching of the Lord by whom God has
  redeemed the world had dawned, even before His appearance on earth, on the
  spirit of the best of the heathen, and in the hearts of those wise men
  who&mdash;though not born into the state of grace&mdash;sought and strove
  after the truth, after inward purity, and an apprehension of the Almighty.
  The Lord chose them out to prepare the hearts of mankind for the good
  tidings, and make them fit to receive the gospel when the Star should rise
  over Bethlehem.</p>

  <p>"Many of these sages had infused precious doctrine into the worship of
  Serapis before the hour of true redemption had come. They enjoined the
  servants of Serapis to be more zealous in the care of the soul than in that
  of the body, for they had detected the imperishable nature of the spiritual
  and divine part of man; they saw that we are brought into existence by sin
  and love, and we must therefore die to our sinful love and rise again through
  the might of love eternal. These Hellenes, like the Egyptian sages of the
  times of the Pharaohs, divined and declared that the soul was held
  responsible after death for all it had done of good or evil in its mortal
  body. They distinguished virtue and sin by the eternal law, which was written
  in the hearts even of the heathen, to the end that they, by nature, might do
  the works of the law; nay, there were some of their loftiest spirits who,
  though they knew not the Lord, it is true, required the repentance in the
  sinner, in the name of Serapis, and pronounced that it was good to give up
  the delusive joys and vain pleasures of the flesh and to break away from the
  evil&mdash;whether of body or of soul&mdash;which we are led into by the
  senses. They called upon their disciples to hold meetings for meditation
  whereby they might discern truth and the divinity; and the vast precincts of
  the Serapeum contained cells and alcoves for penitents and devotees, in which
  many a soul touched by grace, dead to the world and absorbed in the
  contemplation of such things as they esteemed high and heavenly, has ripened
  to old age and death.</p>

  <p>"But, my beloved, the Light in which we rejoice, through no merits or
  deserts of our own, had not yet been shed on the lost children of those days
  of darkness; and all those noble, and indeed most admirable efforts were
  polluted by an admixture, even here, of coarse superstition, bloody
  sacrifices, and foolish adoration of perishable stone idols and beasts
  without understanding; and in other places by the false and delusive arts of
  Magians and sorcerers. Even the dim apprehension of true salvation was
  darkened and distorted by the subtleties of a vain and inconsistent
  philosophy, which held a theory as immutably true one day and overthrew or
  denied it the next. Thus, by degrees, the temple of the idol of Sinope
  degenerated into a stronghold of deceit and bloodshed, of the basest
  superstition, the pleasures of the flesh, and abominations that cried to
  Heaven. Learning, to be sure, was still cherished in the halls of the
  Serapeum; but its disciples turned with hardened hearts from the truth which
  was sent into the world by the grace of God, and they remained the prophets
  of error. The doctrines which the sages had associated with the idea of
  Serapis, debased and degraded by the most contemptible trivialities; lost all
  their worth and dignity; and after the great Apostle to whom this basilica is
  dedicated, had brought the gospel to Alexandria, the idol's throne began to
  totter, and the tidings of salvation shook its foundations and brought it to
  the verge of destruction in spite of the persecutions, in spite of the edicts
  of the apostate Julian, in spite of the desperate efforts of the
  philosophers, sophists, and heathen&mdash;for our Lord and Master, Jesus
  Christ, has given certainty and actuality to the fleeting shadow of half-
  divined truth which lies in the core of the worship of Serapis. The pure and
  radiant star of Christian love has risen in the place of the dim nebulous
  mist of Serapis; and just as the moon pales when the sun appears triumphant,
  the worship of Serapis has died away in a thousand places where the gospel
  has been received. Even here, in Alexandria, its feeble flame is kept alive
  only by infinite care, and if the might of our pious and Christian Emperor
  makes itself felt-tomorrow, or next day&mdash;then, my beloved, it will
  vanish in smoke, and no power on earth can fan it into life again. Not our
  grandsons, no, but our own children will ask: Who&mdash;what was Serapis? For
  he who shall be overthrown is no longer a mighty god but an idol bereft of
  his splendor and his dignity. This is no struggle of might against might; it
  is the death-stroke given to a wounded and vanquished foe. The tree is rotten
  to the core and can crush no one in its fall, but it will cover all who stand
  near it with dust and rubbish. The sovereign has outlived his dominion, and
  when his fingers drop the sceptre few indeed will bewail him, for the new
  King has already mounted the throne and His is the Kingdom, and the power,
  and the glory, forever! Amen."</p>

  <p>Dada had listened to the deacon's address with no particular interest, but
  the conclusion struck her attention. The old man looked dignified and honest;
  but Father Karnis was a well-meaning man, no doubt, and one of those who are
  wont to keep on the winning side. How was it that the preacher could draw so
  pitiable a picture of the very same god whose greatness her uncle had praised
  in such glowing terms only two days since? How could the same thing appear so
  totally different to two different people?</p>

  <p>The priest looked more sagacious than the musician; Marcus, the young
  Christian, had a most kind heart; there was not a better or gentler creature
  under the sun than Agne&mdash;it was quite possible that Christianity was
  something very different in reality from what her foster parents chose to
  represent. As to the frightful consequences of the overthrow of the temple of
  Serapis, on that point she was completely reassured, and she prepared to
  listen with greater attention as Eusebius went on:</p>

  <p>"Let us rejoice, beloved! The great idol's days are numbered! Do you know
  what that false worship has been in our midst? It has been like a splendid
  and richly-dressed trireme sailing, plague-stricken, into a harbor full of
  ships and boats. Woe to those who allow themselves to be tempted on board by
  the magnificence of its decorations! How great is their chance of infection,
  how easily they will carry it from ship to ship, and from the ships on to the
  shore, till the pestilence has spread from the harbor to the city! Let us
  then be thankful to those who destroy the gorgeous vessel, who drive it from
  amongst us, or sink or burn it. May our Father in Heaven give courage to
  their hearts, strength to their hands and blessing on their deeds! When we
  hear: 'Great Serapis has fallen to the earth and is no more, we and the world
  are free from him!' then, in this city, and wherever Christians dwell and
  worship, let a solemn festival be held.</p>

  <p>"But still let us be just, still let us bear in mind all the great and
  good gifts that the trireme brought to our parents when it rode the waves
  manned by a healthy crew. If we do, it will be with sincere pity that we
  shall watch the proud vessel sink to the bottom, and we shall understand the
  grief of those whom once it bore over ebb and flow, and who believe they owe
  every thing to it. We shall rejoice doubly, too, to think that we ourselves
  have a safe bark with stout planks and strong masts, and a trustworthy pilot
  at the helm; and that we may confidently invite others to join us on board as
  soon as they have purified themselves of the plague with which they have been
  smitten.</p>

  <p>"I think you will all have understood this parable. When Serapis falls
  there will be lamentation and woe among the heathen; but we, who are true
  Christians, ought not to pass them by, but must strive to heal and save the
  wounded and sick at heart. When Serapis falls you must be the
  physicians&mdash;healers of souls, as the Lord hath said; and if we desire to
  heal, our first task must be to discover in what the sufferings consist of
  those we wish to succor, for our choice of medicine must depend on the nature
  of the injury.</p>

  <p>"What I mean is this: None can give comfort but those who know how to
  sympathize with the soul that craves it, who feel the sorrows of others as
  keenly as though they were their own. And this gift, my brethren, is, next to
  faith, the Christian grace which of all others best pleases our Heavenly
  Master.</p>

  <p>"I see it in my mind's eye! The ruined edifice of the Serapeum, the
  masterpiece of Bryaxis laid in fragments in the dust, and thousands of
  wailing heathen! As the Jews wept and hung their harps on the trees by the
  waters of Babylon when they remembered Zion, so do I see the heathen weep as
  they think of the perished splendor. They themselves, indeed, ruined and
  desecrated the glory they bewail; and when something higher and purer took
  its place they hardened their hearts, and, instead of leaving the dead to
  bury their dead and throwing themselves hopefully into the new life, they
  refused to be parted from the putrefying corpse. They were fools, but their
  folly was fidelity; and if we can win them over to our holy faith they will
  be faithful unto death, as they have been to their old gods, clinging to
  Jesus and earning the crown of life. 'There will be more joy in Heaven over
  one sinner that repenteth than over ninety and nine that need no
  repentance,'&mdash;that you have heard; and whichever among you loves the
  Saviour can procure him a great joy if he guides only one of these weeping
  heathen into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"But perhaps you will ask: Is not the sorrow of the heathen a vain thing?
  What is it after all that they bewail? To understand that, try to picture to
  yourselves what it is that they think they are losing. Verily it is not a
  small matter, and it includes many things for which we and all mankind owe
  them a debt of gratitude. We call ourselves Christians and are proud of the
  name; but we also call ourselves Hellenes, and are proud of that name too. It
  was under the protection of the old gods, whose fall is about to be
  consummated, that the Greeks achieved marvellous deeds, nurturing the gifts
  of the intellect which the Almighty bestowed on their race, like faithful
  gardeners, and making them bring forth marvellous fruit. In the realm of
  thought the Greek is sovereign of the nations, and he has given to perishable
  matter a perfection of form which has elevated and vivified it to
  immortality. Nothing more beautiful has ever been imagined or executed,
  before or since, or by any other people, than was produced by Greece in its
  prime. But perhaps you will ask, why did not the Redeemer come down among our
  fathers in those glorious days? Because beauty, as they conceived and still
  conceive of it, is a mere perishable accident of matter, and because a race
  which thus devoted every thought and feeling to an inspired and fervent
  worship of beauty&mdash;which was so absorbed in the contemplation of the
  visible, could have no longing for the invisible which is the real life that
  came down among us with the only-begotten Son of God. Nevertheless Beauty is
  beautiful; and when the time shall come when the visible is married to the
  invisible, when eternal Truth is clothed in perfect form, then, and not till
  then, will the ideal which our fathers strove after in the great old days be
  realized, by the grace of the Saviour.</p>

  <p>"But this visible beauty, which they so passionately cherished, does us
  good service too, so long as we do not allow it to dazzle us and lead us
  astray from the one thing needful. To whom, if not to the heathen Hellenes,
  do our great teachers owe, under God, the noble art of coordinating their
  loftiest feelings, and casting them in forms which are intelligible to the
  Christian and at once instruct, delight, and edify him? It was in a heathen
  school that each one of your pastors&mdash;that even I, the humblest of
  them&mdash;studied that rhetoric which enables me to utter with a flowing
  tongue the things which the Spirit gives me to speak to you; and if some day
  there are Christian schools, in which our sons may acquire the same power,
  they must adopt many of the laws devised by the heathen. If in the future we
  are rich enough to raise churches to the Almighty, to the Virgin Mary and the
  great Saints, in any way worthy of their sublime merits, we shall owe our
  skill to the famous architects of heathen Hellas. We are indebted to the arts
  of the heathen for a thousand things in daily use, beside numberless others
  that lend charm to existence. Yes, my beloved, when we consider all they did
  for us we cannot in justice withhold our tribute of gratitude and
  admiration.</p>

  <p>"Nor can we doubt that the best of them were acceptable to the Almighty
  himself, for he granted to them to see darkly and from afar what he has
  brought nigh to us, and poured into our hearts by divine revelation. You all
  know the name of Plato. He, from whom Salvation was hidden, saw remotely, by
  presentiment as it were, many things which to us, the Redeemed, are clear and
  plain and near. He perceived the relation of earthly beauty and heavenly
  truth. The great gift of Love binds and supports us all and Plato gave the
  name of the divine Eros, that is divine love, to an inspired devotion to the
  Imperishable. He placed goodness&mdash;the Good&mdash;at the top of the great
  scale of Ideas which he constructed. The Good was, to him, the highest Idea
  and the uttermost of which we can conceive:&mdash;Good, whose properties he
  made manifest by every means his lofty and lucid mind could command. This
  heathen, my brethren and sisters, was well worthy of the grace bestowed on
  us. Do justice then to the blinded souls, justice in Plato's sense of the
  word; he calls the virtue of reason Wisdom; the virtue of spirit Courage, and
  the virtue of the senses Temperance. Well, well! 'Prove all things and hold
  fast that which is good.' That is to say: consider what may be worth anything
  in the works of the heathen that it may be duly preserved; but, on the other
  hand, tread all that is idolatry in the dust, all that brings the unclean
  thing among us, all that imperils our souls and bodies, or anything that is
  high and pure in life; but do not forget, my beloved, all that the heathen
  have done for us. Be temperate in all things; avoid excess of zeal; for thus,
  and thus only, can we be just. 'It is not to hate, but to love each other
  that we are here.' It was not a Christian but Sophocles, one of the greatest
  of the heathen, who uttered those words, and he speaks them still to us!"</p>

  <p>Eusebius paused and drew a deep breath.</p>

  <p>Dada had listened eagerly, for it pleased her to hear all that she had
  been wont to prize spoken of here with due appreciation. But since Eusebius
  had begun to discourse about Plato she had been disturbed by two men sitting
  just in front of her. One was tall and lean, with a long narrow head, and the
  other a shorter and more comfortable-looking personage. The first fidgeted
  incessantly, nudging and twitching his companion, and looking now and then as
  if he were ready to start up and interrupt the preacher. This behavior
  evidently annoyed his neighbors who kept signing to him to be quiet and
  hushing him down, while he took no notice of their demonstrations but kept
  clearing his throat with obtrusive emphasis and at last scraped and shuffled
  his feet on the floor, though not very noisily. But Eusebius began again:</p>

  <p>"And now, my brethren, how ought we to demean ourselves in these fateful
  times of disturbance? As Christians; only&mdash;or rather, by God's aiding
  grace as Christians in the true sense of our Lord and Master, according to
  the precepts given by Him through the Apostles. Their words shall be mine.
  They say there are two paths&mdash;the path of Life and the path of Death,
  and there is a great difference between them. The path of Life is this:
  First, Thou shalt love God who hath created thee; next thou shalt love thy
  neighbor as thyself, and whatsoever thou wouldst men should do unto thee even
  so do unto them; but what thou wouldst not have done unto thee do thou not to
  them. And the sum of the doctrine contained in these words is this: Bless
  those that curse you, pray for your enemies and repent for those who
  persecute you, for 'if ye love them that love you what thank have ye? Do not
  even the heathen the same?' Love those that hate you and you will have no
  enemies.</p>

  <p>"Take this teaching of the holy Apostles to heart this day. Beware of
  mocking or persecuting those who have been your enemies. Even the nobler
  heathen regarded it as an act of grace to respect the conquered foe, and to
  you, as Christians, it should be a law. It is not so hard to forgive an enemy
  when we regard him as a possible friend in the future; and the Christian can
  go so far as to love him when he remembers that every man is his brother and
  neighbor, and equally precious in the sight of the Saviour who is dearer to
  us than life.</p>

  <p>"The heathen, the idolater, is the Christian's archfoe; but soon he will
  be in fetters at our feet. And, then, my brethren, pray for him; for if the
  Almighty, who is without spot or stain and perfect beyond words, can forgive
  the sinner, ye who are base and guilty may surely forgive. 'Fishers of souls'
  we all should be; try to fulfil the injunction. Draw the enemy to you by
  kindness and love; show him by your example the beauty of the Christian life;
  let him perceive the benefits of Salvation; lead those whose gods and temples
  we have overthrown, into our churches; and when, after triumphing over those
  blind souls by the sword, we have also conquered them by love, faith and
  prayer&mdash;when they can rejoice with us in the Redemption by our Lord
  Jesus Christ&mdash;then shall we all be as one fold under one shepherd, and
  peace and joy shall reign in the city which is now torn by dissension and
  strife."</p>

  <p>At this point the preacher was interrupted, for a loud uproar broke out in
  the Narthex,* shouts and cries of men fighting, mingled with the dull roar of
  a bull.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The vestibule of the early Christian basilica which
  was open to penitents. ]</p>

  <p>The congregation started to their feet in extreme consternation, and the
  door was flung open and a host of heathen youths rushed into the nave,
  followed by an overwhelming force of Christians from whom they had sought
  refuge in the sanctuary. Here they turned at bay to make a last desperate
  resistance. Garlands, stripped of their leaves and flowers, still crowned
  their heads and hung over their shoulders. They had been attacked close to
  the church, by a party of monks when in the act of driving a gaily-decorated
  steer to the temple of Apollo, in defiance of the Imperial edict; and the
  beast, terrified by the tumult, had rushed into the narthex for shelter.</p>

  <p>The fight in the church was a short one; the idolaters were soon
  vanquished; but Eusebius threw himself between them and the monks, and tried
  to save the victims from the revengeful fury of the conquerors. The women had
  all made for the door, but they did not venture out into the vestibule, for
  the young bull was still raging there, trampling or tossing everything that
  came in his way. At last, however, a soldier of the city-watch dealt him a
  sword-thrust in the neck, and he fell rolling in his own blood. At once the
  congregation forced their way out, shrieking with alarm and excitement, Dada
  among the number, dragging the child with her. Papias pulled with all his
  might to keep her back, declaring with vehement insistence that he had seen
  Agne in the church and wanted to go back to her. Dada, however, neither heard
  nor heeded; frightened out of her wits she went on with the crowd, taking him
  with her.</p>

  <p>She never paused till she reached the house of Medius, quite out of
  breath; but then, as the little boy still asserted that he had seen his
  sister in the sanctuary, she turned back with him, as soon as the throng had
  dispersed. In the church there was no one to hinder them; but they got no
  further than the dividing screen, for on the floor beyond lay the mutilated
  and bleeding bodies of many a youth who had fallen in the contest.</p>

  <p>How she made her way back to the house of Medius once more she never knew.
  For the first time she had been brought face to face with life in hideous
  earnest, and when the singer went to look for her in her room, at dusk, he
  was startled to find her bright face clouded and her eyes dim with tears. How
  bitterly she had been weeping Medius indeed could not know; he ascribed her
  altered appearance to fear of the approaching cataclysm and was happy to be
  able to tell her, in all good faith, that the danger was as good as over.
  Posidonius, the Magian, had been to see him, and had completely reassured
  him. This man, whose accomplice he had been again and again in producing
  false apparitions of spirits and demons, had once gained an extraordinary
  influence over him by casting some mysterious spell upon him and reducing his
  will to abject subjection to his own; and this magician, who had recovered
  his own self-possession, had assured him, with an inimitable air of
  infallibility, that the fall of the Temple of Serapis would involve no
  greater catastrophe than that of any old worn-out statue. Since this
  announcement Medius had laughed at his own alarms; he had recovered his
  "strong-mindedness," and when Posidonius had given him three tickets for the
  Hippodrome he had jumped at the offer.</p>

  <p>The races were to be run next day, in spite of the general panic that had
  fallen on the citizens; and Dada, when he invited her to join him and his
  daughter in-the enjoyment of so great a treat, dried her eyes and accepted
  gleefully.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Alarming as was the outlook in Alexandria, the races, were
  to be held as usual. This had been decided only a few hours since at the
  Bishop's palace, and criers had been sent abroad throughout the streets and
  squares of the city to bid the inhabitants to this popular entertainment. In
  the writing-office of the Ephemeris,* which would be given to the public the
  first thing in the morning, five hundred slaves or more were occupied in
  writing from dictation a list of the owners of the horses, of the
  'agitatores' who would drive them, and of the prizes offered to the winners,
  whether Christians or heathen.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Ephemeris&mdash;The news-sheet, which was brought out,
  not only in Rome, but in all the cities of the Empire, and which kept the
  citizens informed of all important events. ]</p>

  <p>The heat in the Episcopal council-hall had been oppressive, and not less
  so the heat of temper among the priests assembled there; for they had fully
  determined, for once, not to obey their prelate with blind submission, and
  they knew full well that Theophilus, on occasion, if his will were opposed,
  could not merely thunder but wield the bolt.</p>

  <p>Besides the ecclesiastical members of the council, Cynegius, the Imperial
  legate&mdash;Evagrius, the Prefect&mdash;and Romanus, the commander-in-chief
  and Comes of Egypt,&mdash;had all been present. The officials of the
  Empire&mdash;Roman statesmen who knew Alexandria and her citizens well, and
  who had often smarted under the spiritual haughtiness of her
  Bishop&mdash;were on the prelate's side. Cynegius was doubtful; but the
  priests, who had not altogether escaped the alarms that had stricken the
  whole population, were so bold as to declare against a too hasty decision,
  and to say that the celebration of the games at a time of such desperate
  peril was not only presumptuous but sinful, and a tempting of God.</p>

  <p>In answer to a scornful enquiry from Theophilus as to where the danger lay
  if&mdash;as the Comes promised&mdash;Serapis were to be overthrown on the
  morrow, one of the assembly answered in the name of his colleagues. This man,
  now very old, had formerly been a wonderfully successful exorcist, and,
  notwithstanding that he was a faithful Christian, he was the leader of a
  gnostic sect and a diligent student of magic. He proceeded to argue, with all
  the zeal and vehemence of conviction, that Serapis was the most terrible of
  all the heathen daemons, and that all the oracles of antiquity, all the
  prophecies of the seers, and all the conclusions of the Magians and
  astrologers would be proved false if his fall&mdash;which the present
  assembly could only regard as a great boon from Heaven&mdash;did not entail
  some tremendous convulsion of nature.</p>

  <p>At this Theophilus gave the reins to his wrath; he snatched a little
  crucifix from the wall above his episcopal throne, and broke it in fragments,
  exclaiming in deep tones that quavered with wrath:</p>

  <p>"And which do you regard as the greater: The only-begotten Son of God, or
  that helpless image?" And he flung the pieces of the broken crucifix down on
  the table round which they were sitting. Then, as though horror-stricken at
  his own daring act, he fell on his knees, raised his eyes and hands in
  prayer, and gathering up the broken image, kissed it devoutly.</p>

  <p>This rapid scene had a tremendous effect. Amazement and suspense were
  painted on every face, not a hand, not a lip moved as Theophilus rose again
  and cast a glance of proud and stern defiance round the assembly, which each
  man took to himself. For some moments he remained silent, as though awaiting
  a reply; but his repellent mien and majestic bearing made it sufficiently
  clear that he was ready to annihilate any opponent. In fact none of the
  priests contradicted him; and, though Evagrius looked at him with a doubting
  shake of his shrewd head, Cynegius on the other hand nodded assent. The
  Bishop, however, seemed to care for neither dissent nor approval, and it was
  in brief and cutting terms, with no flourish of rhetoric, that he laid it
  down that wood and stone had nothing to do with the divine Majesty, even
  though they were made in the image of all that was Holy and worshipful or
  were most lavishly beautified by the hand of man with the foul splendors of
  perishable wealth. The greater the power ascribed by superstition to the base
  material&mdash;whatever form it bore&mdash;the more odious must it be to the
  Christian. Any man who should believe that a daemon could turn even a breath
  of the Most High to its own will and purpose, would do well to beware of
  idolatry, for Satan had already laid his clutches somewhere on his robe.</p>

  <p>At this sweeping accusation many a cheek colored wrathfully, and not a
  word was spoken when the Bishop proceeded to require of his hearers that, if
  the Serapeum should fall into the hands of the Imperial troops, it should be
  at once and ruthlessly destroyed, and that his hearers should not cease from
  the work of ruin till this scandal of the city should be swept from the face
  of the earth.</p>

  <p>"If then the world crumbles to atoms!" he cried, "well and good&mdash;the
  heathen are right and we are wrong, and in that case it were better to
  perish; but as surely as I sit on this throne by the grace of God, Serapis is
  the vain imagining of fools and blind, and there is no god but the God whose
  minister I am!"</p>

  <p>"Whose Kingdom is everlasting, Amen!" chanted an old priest; and Cynegius
  rose to explain that he should do nothing to hinder the total overthrow of
  the temple and image.</p>

  <p>Then the Comes spoke in defence of the Bishop's resolution to allow the
  races to be held, as usual, on the morrow. He sketched a striking picture of
  the shallow, unstable nature of the Alexandrians, a people wholly given over
  to enjoyment. The troops at his command were few in number in comparison with
  the heathen population of the city, and it was a very important matter to
  keep a large proportion of the worshippers of Serapis occupied elsewhere at
  the moment of the decisive onset. Gladiator-fights were prohibited, and the
  people were tired of wild beasts; but races, in which heathen and Christian
  alike might enter their horses for competition, must certainly prove most
  attractive just at this time of bitter rivalry and oppugnancy between the two
  religions, and would draw thousands of the most able-bodied idolaters to the
  Hippodrome. All this he had already considered and discussed with the Bishop
  and Cynegius; nay, that zealous destroyer of heathen worship had come to
  Alexandria with the express purpose of overthrowing the Serapeum; but, as a
  prudent statesman, he had first made sure that the time and circumstances
  were propitious for the work of annihilation. All that he had here seen and
  heard had only strengthened his purpose; so, after suggesting a few possible
  difficulties, and enjoining moderation and mercy as the guiding principles of
  his sovereign, he commanded, in the Emperor's name, that the sanctuary of
  Serapis should be seized by force of arms and utterly destroyed, and that the
  races should be held on the morrow.</p>

  <p>The assembled council bowed low; and when Theophilus had closed the
  meeting with a prayer he withdrew to his ungarnished study, with his head
  bent and an air of profound humility, as though he had met with a defeat
  instead of gaining a victory.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The fate of the great god of the heathen was sealed, but in the wide
  precincts of the Serapeum no one thought of surrender or of prompt defeat.
  The basement of the building, on which stood the grandest temple ever erected
  by the Hellenes, presented a smooth and slightly scarped rampart of
  impregnable strength to the foe. A sloping way extended up over a
  handsomely-decorated incline, and from the middle of the grand curve
  described by this road, two flights of steps led up to the three great doors
  in the facade of the building.</p>

  <p>The heathen had taken care to barricade this approach in all haste, piling
  the road and steps with statuary-images of the gods of the finest
  workmanship, figures and busts of kings, queens, and heroes, Hermes, columns,
  stelae, sacrificial stones, chairs and benches-torn from their places by a
  thousand eager hands. The squared flags of the pavement and the granite
  blocks of the steps had been built up into walls and these were still being
  added to after the besiegers had surrounded the temple; for the defenders
  tore down stones, pilasters, gutters and pieces of the cornice, and flung
  them on to the outworks, or, when they could, on to the foe who for the
  present were not eager to commence hostilities.</p>

  <p>The captains of the Imperial force had miscalculated the strength of the
  heathen garrison. They supposed a few hundreds might have entrenched
  themselves, but on the roof alone above a thousand men were to be seen, and
  every hour seemed to increase the number of men and women crowding into the
  Serapeum. The Romans could only suppose that this constantly growing
  multitude had been concealed in the secret halls and chambers of the temple
  ever since Cynegius had first arrived, and had no idea that they were still
  being constantly reinforced.</p>

  <p>Karnis, Herse, and Orpheus, among others, had made their way thither from
  the timber-yard, down the dry conduit, and an almost incessant stream of the
  adherents of the old gods had preceded and followed them.</p>

  <p>While Eusebius had been exhorting his congregation in the church of St.
  Mark to Christian love towards the idolaters, these had collected in the
  temple precincts to the number of about four thousand, all eager for the
  struggle. A vast multitude! But the extent of the Serapeum was so enormous
  that the mass of people was by no means densely packed on the roof, in the
  halls, and in the underground passages and rooms. There was no crowding
  anywhere, least of all in the central halls of the temple itself; indeed, in
  the great vestibule crowned with a dome which formed the entrance, in the
  vast hall next to it, and in the magnificent hypostyle with a semicircular
  niche on the furthest side in which stood the far-famed image of the god,
  there were only scattered groups of men, who looked like dwarfs as the eye
  compared them with the endless rows of huge columns.</p>

  <p>The full blaze of day penetrated nowhere but into the circular vestibule,
  which was lighted by openings in the drum of the cupola that rested on four
  gigantic columns. In the inner hall there was only dim twilight; while the
  hypostyle was quite dark, but for a singularly contrived shaft of light which
  produced a most mysterious effect.</p>

  <p>The shadows of the great columns in the fore hall, and of the double
  colonnade on each side of the hypostyle, lay like bands of crape on the many-
  colored pavement; borders, circles, and ellipses of mosaic diversified the
  smooth and lucent surface, in which were mirrored the astrological figures
  which sparkled in brighter hues on the ceiling, the trophies of symbols and
  mythological groups that graced the walls in tinted high relief, and the
  statues and Hermes between the columns. A wreath of lovely forms and colors
  dazzled the eye with their multiplicity and profusion, and the heavy
  atmosphere of incense which filled the halls was almost suffocating, while
  the magical and mystical signs and figures were so many and so new that the
  enquiring mind, craving for an explanation and an interpretation of all these
  incomprehensible mysteries, hardly dared investigate them in detail.</p>

  <p>A heavy curtain, that looked as though giants must have woven it on a loom
  of superhuman proportions, hung, like a thick cloud shrouding a mountain-
  peak, from the very top of the hypostyle, in grand folds over the niche
  containing the statue, and down to the floor; and while it hid the sacred
  image from the gaze of the worshipper it attracted his attention by the
  infinite variety of symbolical patterns and beautiful designs which were
  woven in it and embroidered on it.</p>

  <p>The gold and silver vessels and precious jewels that lay concealed by this
  hanging were of more value than many a mighty king's treasure; and everything
  was on so vast a scale that man shuddered to feel his own littleness, and the
  mind sought some new standard of measurement by which to realize such
  unwonted proportions. The finite here seemed to pass into the infinite; and
  as the spectator gazed up, with his head thrown back, at the capitals of the
  lofty columns and the remote height of the ceiling, his sight failed him
  before he had succeeded in distinguishing or even perceiving a small portion
  only of the bewildering confusion of figures and emblems that were crowded on
  to the surface. Greek feeling for beauty had here worked hand in hand with
  Oriental taste for gorgeous magnificence, and every detail could bear
  examination; for there was not a motive of the architecture, not a work of
  sculpture, painting, or mosaic, not a product of the foundry or the loom,
  which did not bear the stamp of thorough workmanship and elaborate finish.
  The ruddy, flecked porphyry, the red, white, green, or yellow marbles which
  had been used for the decorations were all the finest and purest ever wrought
  upon by Greek craftsmen. Each of the hundreds of sculptured works which here
  had found a home was the masterpiece of some great artist; as the curious
  visitor lingered in loving contemplation of the mosaics on the polished
  floor, or examined the ornamental mouldings that framed the reliefs, dividing
  the walls into panels, he was filled with wonder and delight at the beauty,
  the elegance and the inventiveness that had given charm, dignity, and
  significance to every detail.</p>

  <p>Adjoining these great halls devoted especially to the worship of the god,
  were hundreds of courts, passages, colonnades and rooms, and others not less
  numerous lay underground. There were long rows of rooms containing above a
  hundred thousand rolls of books, the famous library of the Serapeum, with
  separate apartments for readers and copyists; there were store-rooms,
  refectories and assembly-rooms for the high-priests of the temple, for
  teachers and disciples; while acrid odors came up from the laboratories, and
  the fragrance of cooking from the kitchen and bake-houses. In the very
  thickness of the walls of the basement were cells for penitents and recluses,
  long since abandoned, and rooms for the menials and slaves, of whom hundreds
  were employed in the precincts; under ground spread the mystical array of
  halls, grottoes, galleries and catacombs dedicated to the practice of the
  Mysteries and the initiation of neophytes; on the roof stood various
  observatories&mdash;among them one erected for the study of the heavens by
  Eratosthenes, where Claudius Ptolemaeus had watched and worked. Up here
  astronomers, star-gazers, horoscopists and Magians spent their nights, while,
  far below them, in the temple-courts that were surrounded by store-houses and
  stables, the blood of sacrificed beasts was shed and the entrails of the
  victims were examined.</p>

  <p>The house of Serapis was a whole world in little, and centuries had
  enriched it with wealth, beauty, and the noblest treasures of art and
  learning. Magic and witchcraft hedged it in with a maze of mystical and
  symbolical secrets, and philosophy had woven a tissue of speculation round
  the person of the god. The sanctuary was indeed the centre of Hellenic
  culture in the city of Alexander; what marvel then, that the heathen should
  believe that with the overthrow of Serapis and his temple, the earth, nay the
  universe itself must sink into the abyss?</p>

  <p>Anxious spirits and throbbing hearts were those that now sought shelter in
  the Serapeum, fully prepared to perish with their god, and yet eager with
  enthusiasm to avert his fall if possible.</p>

  <p>A strange medley indeed of men and women had collected within these sacred
  precincts! Grave sages, philosophers, grammarians, mathematicians,
  naturalists, and physicians clung to Olympius and obeyed him in silence.
  Rhetoricians with shaven faces, Magians and sorcerers, whose long beards
  flowed over robes embroidered with strange figures; students, dressed after
  the fashion of their forefathers in the palmy days of Athens; men of every
  age, who dubbed themselves artists though they were no more than imitators of
  the works of a greater epoch, unhappy in that no one at this period of
  indifference to beauty called upon them to prove what they could do, or to
  put forth their highest powers. Actors, again, from the neglected theatres,
  starving histrions, to whom the stage was prohibited by the Emperor and
  Bishop, singers and flute-players; hungry priests and temple-servitors
  expelled from the closed sanctuaries; lawyers, scribes, ships' captains,
  artisans, though but very few merchants, for Christianity had ceased to be
  the creed of the poor, and the wealthy attached themselves to the faith
  professed by those in authority.</p>

  <p>One of the students had contrived to bring a girl with him, and several
  others, seeing this, went back into the streets by the secret way and brought
  in damsels of no very fair repute, till the crowd of men was diversified by a
  considerable sprinkling of wreathed and painted girls, some of them the
  outcast maids of various temples, and others priestesses of higher character,
  who had remained faithful to the old gods or who practised magic arts.</p>

  <p>Among these women one, a tall and dignified matron in mourning robes, was
  a conspicuous figure. This was Berenice, the mother of the young heathen who
  had been ridden down and wounded in the skirmish near the Prefect's house,
  and whose eyes Eusebius had afterwards closed. She had come to the Serapeum
  expressly to avenge her son's death and then to perish with the fall of the
  gods for whom he had sacrificed his young life. But the mad turmoil that
  surrounded her was more than she could bear; she stood, hour after hour,
  closely veiled and absorbed in her own thoughts, neither raising her eyes nor
  uttering a word, at the foot of a bronze statue of justice dispensing rewards
  and punishments.</p>

  <p>Olympius had entrusted the command of the little garrison of armed men to
  Memnon, a veteran legate of great experience, who had lost his left arm in
  the war against the Goths. The high-priest himself was occupied alternately
  in trying to persuade the hastily-collected force to obey their leader, and
  in settling quarrels, smoothing difficulties, suppressing insubordination,
  and considering plans with reference to supplies for his adherents, and the
  offering of a great sacrifice at which all the worshippers of Serapis were to
  assist. Karnis kept near his friend, helping him so far as was possible;
  Orpheus, with others of the younger men, had been ordered to the roof, where
  they were employed&mdash;under the scorching sun, reflected from the copper-
  plated covering and the radiating surface of the dome&mdash;in loosening
  blocks of stone from the balustrade to be hurled down to-morrow on the
  besieging force.</p>

  <p>Herse devoted herself to the sick and wounded, for a few who had ventured
  forth too boldly to aid in barricading the entrance, had been hurt by arrows
  and lances flung by the idle soldiery; and a still greater number were
  suffering from sun-stroke in consequence of toiling on the top of the
  building.</p>

  <p>Inside the vast, thick-walled halls it was much cooler than in the streets
  even, and the hours glided fast to the besieged heathen. Many of them were
  fully occupied, or placed on guard; others were discussing the situation, and
  disputing or guessing at what the outcome might, or must be. Numbers, panic-
  stricken or absorbed in pious awe, sat huddled on the ground, praying,
  muttering magical formulas, or wailing aloud. The Magians and astrologers had
  retired with knots of followers into the adjoining studies, where they were
  comparing registers, making calculations, reading signs, devising new
  formulas and defending them against their opponents.</p>

  <p>An incessant bustle went on, to and fro between these rooms and the great
  library, and the tables were covered with rolls and tablets containing
  ancient prophecies, horoscopes and potent exorcisms. Messengers, one after
  another, were sent out from thence to command silence in the great halls,
  where the assembled youths and girls were kissing, singing, shouting and
  dancing to the shrill pipe of flutes and twang of lutes, clapping their
  hands, rattling tambourines&mdash;in short, enjoying to the utmost the few
  hours that might yet be theirs before they must make the fatal leap into
  nothingness, or at least into the dim shades of death.</p>

  <p>The sun was sinking when suddenly the great brazen gong was loudly struck,
  and the hard, blatant clatter rent the air of the temple-hall. The mighty
  waves of sound reverberated from the walls of the sanctuary like the surge of
  a clangorous sea, and sent their metallic vibration ringing through every
  room and cell, from the topmost observatory-turret to the deepest vault
  beneath, calling all who were within the precincts to assemble. The holy
  places filled at once; the throng poured in through the vestibule, and in a
  few minutes even the hypostyle, the sanctum of the veiled statue, was full to
  overflowing. Without any distinction of rank or sex, and regardless of all
  the usual formalities or the degrees of initiation which each had passed
  through, the worshippers of Serapis crowded towards the sacred niche, till a
  chain, held up by neokores* at a respectful distance from the mystical spot,
  checked their advance. Densely packed and in almost breathless silence, they
  filled the nave and the colonnades, watching for what might befall.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Temple-servants. ]</p>

  <p>Presently a dull low chant of men's voices was heard. This went on for a
  few minutes, and then a loud pean in honor of the god rang through the temple
  with an accompaniment of flutes, cymbals, lutes and trumpets.</p>

  <p>Karnis had found a place with his wife and son; all three, holding hands,
  joined enthusiastically in the stirring hymn; and, with them, Porphyrius, who
  by accident was close to them, swelling the song of the multitude. All now
  stood with hands uplifted and eyes fixed in anxious expectancy on the
  curtain. The figures and emblems on the hanging were invisible in the
  gloom&mdash;but now-now there was a stir, as of life, in the ponderous
  folds,&mdash;they moved&mdash;they began to ripple like streams, brooks,
  water-falls, recovering motion after long stagnation&mdash;the curtain slowly
  sank, and at length it fell so suddenly that the eye could scarcely note the
  instant. From every lip, as but one voice, rose a cry of admiration,
  amazement, and delight, for Serapis stood revealed to his people.</p>

  <p>The noble manhood of the god sat with dignity on a golden throne that was
  covered with a blaze of jewels; his gracious and solemn face looked down on
  the crowd of worshippers. The hair that curled upon his thoughtful brow, and
  the kalathos that crowned it were of pure gold At his feet crouched Cerberus,
  raising his three fierce heads with glistening ruby eyes. The body of the
  god&mdash;a model of strength in repose&mdash;and the drapery were of gold
  and ivory. In its perfect harmony as a whole, and the exquisite beauty of
  every detail, this statue bore the stamp of supreme power and divine majesty.
  When such a divinity as this should rise from his throne the earth indeed
  might quake and the heavens tremble! Before such a Lord the strongest might
  gladly bow, for no mortal ever shone in such radiant beauty. This Sovereign
  must triumph over every foe, even over death&mdash;the monster that lay
  writhing in impotent rage at his feet!</p>

  <p>Gasping and thrilled with pious awe, enraptured but dumb with reverent
  fear, the assembled thousands gazed on the god dimly revealed to them in the
  twilight, when suddenly, for a moment of solemn glory, a ray of the setting
  sun&mdash;a shaft of intense brightness&mdash;pierced the star-spangled apse
  of the niche and fell on the lips of the god as though to kiss its Lord and
  Father.</p>

  <p>A shout like a thunder-clap-like the roar of breakers on a reef, burst
  from the spectators; a shout of triumph so mighty that the statues quivered,
  the brazen altars rang, the hangings swayed, the sacred vessels clattered and
  the lamps trembled and swung; the echo rolled round the aisles like a
  whirlpool at the flood, and was dashed from pillar to column in a hundred
  wavelets of sound. The glorious sun still recognized its lord; Serapis still
  reigned in undiminished might; he had not yet lost the power to defend
  himself, his world and his children!</p>

  <p>The sun was gone, night fell on the temple and suddenly there was a
  swaying movement of the apse above the statue; the stars were shaken by
  invisible hands, and colored flames twinkled with dazzling brightness from a
  myriad five-rayed perforations. Once more the god was revealed to his
  worshippers under a flood of magical glory, and now fully visible in his
  unique beauty. Again the great halls rang with the acclamations of the
  delirious throng; Olympius stepped forth, arrayed in a flowing robe with the
  insignia and decorations of the high-priesthood; standing in front of the
  image he poured on the pedestal a libation to the gods out of a golden cup,
  and waved a censer of the costliest incense. Then, in burning words, he
  exhorted all the followers of Serapis to fight and conquer for their god,
  or&mdash;if need must&mdash;to perish for and with him. He added a fervent
  prayer in a loud ringing voice&mdash;a cry for help that came from the bottom
  of his heart, and went to the souls of his hearers.</p>

  <p>Then a solemn hymn was chanted as the curtain was raised; and while the
  assembled multitude watched it rise in reverent silence, the temple-servants
  lighted the lamps that illuminated the sanctuary from every cornice and
  pillar.</p>

  <p>Karnis had left hold of his companions' hands, for he wanted to wipe away
  the tears of devotional excitement that flowed down his withered cheeks;
  Orpheus had thrown his arms round his mother, and Porphyrius, who had joined
  a group of philosophers and sages, sent a glance of sympathy to the old
  musician.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">By an hour after sunset the sacrifice of a bull in the great
  court of the Serapeum was consummated, and the Moscosphragist announced that
  the god had graciously accepted it&mdash;the examination of the entrails
  showed more favorable indications than it had the day before. The flesh of
  the slaughtered beast went forthwith to the kitchen; and, if the savor of
  roast beef that presently rose up was as grateful to Serapis as to his
  worshippers, they might surely reckon on a happy issue from the struggle.</p>

  <p>The besieged, indeed, were, ere long, in excellent spirits; for Olympius
  had taken care to store the cellars of the sanctuary with plenty of good
  wine, and the happy auguries drawn from the appearance of the god and the
  state of the victim had filled them with fresh confidence. As there was not
  sleeping accommodation for nearly all the men, they had to turn night into
  day; and as, to most of them, life consisted wholly in the enjoyment of the
  moment, and all was delightful that was new or strange, they soon eat and
  drank themselves into a valiant frame of mind.</p>

  <p>Couches, such as they were wont to be on at meals, there were not, so each
  man snatched up the first thing he could lay his hands on to serve as a seat.
  When cups were lacking the jugs and vessels from the sanctuary were sent for,
  and passed from one to another. Many a youth lounged with his head in some
  fair one's lap; many a girl leaned back to back with some old man; and as
  flowers were not to be had, messengers were sent to the town to buy them,
  with vine-wreaths and other greenery.</p>

  <p>They were easily procured, and with them came the news that the races were
  to be held next morning.</p>

  <p>This information was regarded by many as being of the first importance;
  Nicarchus, the son of the rich Hippocleides, and Zenodotus a weaver of
  tapestry&mdash;whose quadriga had once proved victorious&mdash;hastily made
  their way into the town to give the requisite orders in their stables, and
  they were closely followed by Hippias, the handsome agitator, who was the
  favorite driver in the arena for the horses belonging to wealthy owners. In
  the train of these three every lover of horses vanished from the scene, with
  a number of Hippias' friends, and of flower-sellers, door-keepers, and
  ticket-holders-in short, of all who expected to derive special pleasure or
  profit from the games. Each man reflected that one could not be missed, and
  as the god was favorably disposed he might surely contrive to defend his own
  temple till after the races were over; they would then return to conquer or
  die with the rest.</p>

  <p>Then some others began to think of wives and children in bed at home, and
  they, too, departed; still, by far the larger proportion remained
  behind&mdash;above three thousand in all, men and women. These at once
  possessed themselves of the half-emptied wine-jars left by the deserters; gay
  music was got up, and then, wreathed with garlands on their heads and
  shoulders, and 'filled with the god' they drank, shouted and danced far into
  the night. The merry feast soon became a wild orgy; loud cries of Evoe, and
  tumultuous singing reached the ears of the Magians, who had once more settled
  down to calculations and discussions over their rolls and tablets.</p>

  <p>The mother of the youth that had been killed still sat huddled at the foot
  of the statue of justice, enduring the anguish of listening to these drunken
  revels with dull resignation. Every shout of laughter, every burst of mad
  mirth from the revellers above cut her to the heart&mdash;and yet, how they
  would have gladdened her if only one other voice could have mingled with
  those hundreds! When Olympius, still in his fullest dress, and carrying his
  head loftily as became him, made his way through the temple at the head of
  his subordinates, he noticed Berenice&mdash;whom he had known as a proud and
  happy mother&mdash;and begged her to join the friends whom he had bidden to
  his own table; but she dreaded any social contact with men whom she knew, and
  preferred to remain where she was at the feet of the goddess.</p>

  <p>Wherever the high-priest went he was hailed with enthusiasm: "Rejoice," he
  would say to encourage the feasters, cheering them with wise and fervid
  exhortations, reminding them of Pharaoh Mycerinus who, having been told by an
  oracle that he had only six years to live, determined to prove the prophecy
  false, and by carousing through every night made the six years allotted to
  him a good dozen.</p>

  <p>"Imitate him!" cried Olympius as he raised a cup to his lips, "crowd the
  joys of a year into the few hours that still are left us, and pour a libation
  to the god as I do, out of every cup ere you drink."</p>

  <p>His appeal was answered by a rapturous shout; the flutes and cymbals piped
  and clanged, metal cups rang sharply as the drinkers pledged each other, and
  the girls thumped their tambourines, till the calf-skin droned and the bells
  in the frames tinkled shrilly.</p>

  <p>Olympius thanked them, and bowed on all sides, as he walked from group to
  group of his adherents. Seldom, indeed, had his heart beat so high! His end
  perhaps was very near, but it should at least be worthy of his life.</p>

  <p>He knew how the sunbeam had been reflected so as to kiss the statue's
  lips. For centuries had this startling little scene and the sudden
  illumination of the niche round the head of the god been worked in precisely
  the same way at high festivals;* these were mere stimulants to the dull souls
  of the vulgar who needed to be stirred up by the miraculous power of the god,
  which the elect recognized throughout the universe, in the wondrous
  co-operation of forces and results in nature, and in the lives of men. He,
  for his part, firmly believed in Serapis and his might, and in the prophecies
  and calculations which declared that his fall must involve the dissolution of
  the organic world and its relapse into chaos.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* They are mentioned by Rufinus. ]</p>

  <p>Many winds were battling in the air, each one driving the ship of life
  towards the whirlpool. To-day or to-morrow&mdash;what matter which? The
  threatened cataclysm had no terrors for Olympius. One thing only was a pang
  to his vanity: No succeeding generations would preserve the memory of his
  heroic struggle and death for the cause of the gods. But all was not yet
  lost, and his sunny nature read in the glow of the dying clay the promise and
  dawn of a brilliant morrow. If the expected succor should arrive&mdash;if the
  good cause should triumph here in Alexandria&mdash;if the rising were to be
  general throughout Greek heathendom, then indeed had he been rightly named
  Olympius by his parents&mdash;then he would not change places with any god of
  Olympus&mdash;then the glory of his name, more lasting than bronze or marble,
  would shine forth like the sun, so long as one Greek heart honored the
  ancient gods and loved its native land.</p>

  <p>This night&mdash;perhaps its last&mdash;should see a grand, a sumptuous
  feast; he invited his friends and adherents&mdash;the leaders of spiritual
  life in Alexandria&mdash;to a 'symposium', after the manner of the
  philosophers and dilettanti of ancient Athens, to be held in the great
  concert-hall of the Serapeum.</p>

  <p>How different was its aspect from that of the Bishop's council-chamber!
  The Christians sat within bare walls, on wooden benches, round a plain table;
  the large room in which Olympius received his supporters was magnificently
  decorated, and furnished with treasures of art in fine inlaid work, beaten
  brass and purple stuffs-a hall for kings to meet in. Thick cushions, covered
  with lion and panther-skins, tempted fatigue or indolence; and when the hero
  of the hour joined his guests, after his progress through the precincts,
  every couch was occupied. To his right lay Helladius, the famous grammarian
  and high-priest of Zeus; Porphyrius, the benefactor of the Serapeum, was on
  his left; even Karnis had been allotted a place in his old friend's social
  circle, and greatly appreciated the noble juice of the grape, that was passed
  round, as well as the eager and intelligent friction of minds, from which he
  had long been cut off.</p>

  <p>Olympius himself was unanimously chosen Symposiarch, and he invited the
  company to discuss, in the first instance, the time-honored question: Which
  was the highest good?</p>

  <p>One and all, he said, they were standing on a threshold, as it were; and
  as travellers, quitting an old and beloved home to seek a new and unknown one
  in a distant land, pause to consider what particular joy that they have known
  under the shelter of the old Penates has been the dearest, so it would beseem
  them to reflect, at this supreme moment, what had been the highest good of
  their life in this world. They were on the eve, perhaps, of a splendid
  victory; but, perchance, on the other hand, their foot was already on the
  plank that led from the shore of life to Charon's bark.</p>

  <p>The subject was a familiar one and a warm discussion was immediately
  started. The talk was more flowery and brilliant, no doubt, than in old
  Athens, but it led to no deeper views and threw no clearer light on the
  well-worn question. The wranglers could only quote what had been said long
  since as to the highest Good, and when presently Helladius called upon them
  to bring their minds to bear on the nature of humanity, a vehement
  disputation arose as to whether man were the best or the worst of created
  beings. This led to various utterances as to the mystical connection of the
  spiritual and material worlds, and nothing could be more amazing than the
  power of imagination which had enabled these mystical thinkers to people with
  spirits and daemons every circle of the ladder-like structure which connected
  the incomprehensible and self-sufficing One with the divine manifestation
  known as Man. It became quite intelligible that many Alexandrians should fear
  to fling a stone lest it might hit one of the good daemons of which the air
  was full&mdash;a spirit of light perhaps, or a protecting spirit. The more
  obscure their theories, the more were they overloaded with image and
  metaphor; all simplicity of statement was lost, and yet the disputants prided
  themselves on the brilliancy of their language and the wealth of their ideas.
  They believed that they had brought the transcendental within the grasp of
  intelligent sense, and that their empty speculations had carried them far
  beyond the narrow limits of the Ancients.</p>

  <p>Karnis was in raptures; Porphyrius only wished for Gorgo by his side, for,
  like all fathers, he would rather that his child should have enjoyed this
  supreme intellectual treat than himself.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>In Porphyrius' house, meanwhile, all was gloom and anxiety. In spite of
  the terrific heat Damia would not be persuaded to come down from the turret-
  room where she had collected all the instruments, manuals and formulas used
  by astrologers and Magians. A certain priest of Saturn, who had a great
  reputation as a master of such arts, and who, for many years, had been her
  assistant whenever she sought to apply her science to any important event,
  was in attendance&mdash;to give her the astrological tables, to draw circles,
  ellipses or triangles at her bidding, to interpret the mystical sense of
  numbers or letters, which now and then escaped her aged memory; he made her
  calculations or tested those she made herself, and read out the incantations
  which she thought efficacious under the circumstances. Occasionally, too, he
  suggested some new method or fresh formula by which she might verify her
  results.</p>

  <p>She had fasted, according to rule, the whole forenoon, and was frequently
  so far overcome by the heat as to drop asleep in the midst of her studies;
  then, when she woke with a start, if her assistant had meanwhile worked out
  his calculation to a result contrary to her anticipations, she took him up
  sharply and made him begin again from the beginning. Gorge, went up from time
  to time; but, though she offered the old woman refreshment prepared by her
  own hand, she could not persuade her even to moisten her lips with a little
  fruitsyrup, for to break the prescribed fast might endanger the accuracy of
  her prognostications and the result of all her labor. However, when she
  seemed to doze, her granddaughter sprinkled strong waters about the room to
  freshen the air, poured a few drops on the old lady's dress, wiped the dews
  from her brow, and fanned her to cool her. Damia submitted to all this; and
  though she had only closed her weary eyes, she pretended to be asleep in
  order to have the pleasure of being cared for by her darling.</p>

  <p>Towards noon she dismissed the Magian and allowed herself a short interval
  of rest and sleep; but as soon as she woke she collected her wits, and set to
  work again with fresh zeal and diligence. When, at last, she had mastered all
  the signs and omens, she knew for certain that nothing could avert the awful
  doom foretold by the oracles of old.</p>

  <p>The fall of Serapis and the end of the world were at hand.</p>

  <p>The Magian covered his head as he saw, plainly demonstrated, how she had
  reached this conclusion, and he groaned in sincere terror; she, however,
  dismissed him with perfect equanimity, handing him her purse, which she had
  filled in the morning, and saying:</p>

  <p>"To last till the end."</p>

  <p>The sun was now long past the meridian and the old woman, quite worn out,
  threw herself back in her chair and desired Gorgo to let no one disturb her;
  nay, not to return herself till she was sent for. As soon as Damia was alone
  she gazed at herself in a mirror for some little time, murmuring the seven
  vocables incessantly while she did so; and then she fixed her eyes intently
  on the sky. These strange proceedings were directed to a particular end, she
  was endeavoring to close her senses to the external world, to become blind,
  deaf, and impervious to everything material&mdash;the polluting burthen which
  divided her divine and spiritual part from the celestia fount whence it was
  derived; to set her soul free from its earthly shroud&mdash;free to gaze on
  the god that was its father. She had already more than once nearly attained
  to this state by long fasting and resolute abstraction and once, in a moment
  she could never forget, had enjoyed the dizzy ecstasy of feeling herself
  float, as it were through infinite space, like a cloud, bathed in glorious
  radiance. The fatigue that had been gradually over powering her now seconded
  her efforts; she soon felt slight tremor; a cold sweat broke out all over
  her; she lost all consciousness of her limbs, and all sense of sighs and
  hearing; a fresher and cooler air seemed to revive not her lungs only, but
  every part of her body, while undulating rays of red and violet light danced
  before her eyes. Was not their strange radiance an emanation from the eternal
  glory that she sought? Was not some mysterious power uplifting her, bearing
  her towards the highest goal? Was her soul already free from the bondage of
  the flesh? Had she indeed become one with God and had her earnest seeking for
  the Divinity ended in glorification? No; her arms which she had thrown up as
  if to fly, fell by her side it was all in vain. A pain&mdash;a trifling pain
  in her foot, had brought her down again to the base world of sense which she
  so ardently strove to soar away from.</p>

  <p>Several times she took up the mirror, looked in it fixedly as before, and
  then gazed upwards; but each time that she lost consciousness of the material
  world and that her liberated soul began to move its unfettered pinions, some
  little noise, the twitch of a muscle, a fly settling on her hand, a drop of
  perspiration falling from her brow on to her cheek, roused her senses to
  reassert themselves.</p>

  <p>Why&mdash;why was it so difficult to shake off this burthen of mortal
  clay? She thought of herself as of a sculptor who chisels away all
  superfluous material froth his block of marble, to reveal the image of the
  god within; but it was easier to remove the enclosing stone than to release
  the soul from the body to which it was so closely knit. Still, she did not
  give up the struggle to attain the object which others had achieved before
  her; but she got no nearer to it&mdash;indeed, less and less near, for,
  between her and that hoped-for climax, rose up a series of memories and
  strange faces which she could not get rid of. The chisel slipped aside, went
  wrong or lost its edge before the image could be extracted from the
  block.</p>

  <p>One illusion after another floated before her eyes first it was Gorgo, the
  idol of her old heart, lying pale and fair on a sea of surf that rocked her
  on its watery waste&mdash;up high on the crest of a wave and then deep down
  in the abyss that yawned behind it. She, too&mdash;so young, a hardly-opened
  blossom&mdash;must perish in the universal ruin, and be crushed by the same
  omnipotent hand that could overthrow the greatest of the gods; and a glow of
  passionate hatred snatched her away from the aim of her hopes. Then the dream
  changed she saw a scattered flock of ravens flying in wide circles, at an
  unattainable height, against the clouds; suddenly they vanished and she saw,
  in a grey mist, the monument to Porphyrius' wife, Gorgo's long-departed
  mother. She had often visited the mausoleum with tender emotion, but she did
  not want to see it now&mdash;not now, and she shook it off; but in its place
  rose up the image of her daughter-in-law herself, the dweller in that tomb,
  and no effort of will or energy availed to banish that face. She saw the dead
  woman as she had seen her on the last fateful occasion in her short life. A
  solemn and festal procession was passing out through the door of their house,
  headed by flute-players and singing-girls; then came a white bull; a garland
  of the scarlet flowers of the pomegranate* hung round its massive neck, and
  its horns were gilt. By its side walked slaves, carrying white baskets full
  of bread and cakes and heaps of flowers, and these were followed by others,
  bearing light-blue cages containing geese and doves. The bull, the calves,
  the flowers and the birds were all to be deposited in the temple of
  Eileithyia, as a sacrifice to the protecting goddess of women in child-birth.
  Close behind the bull came Gorgo's mother, dressed with wreaths, walking
  slowly and timidly, with shy, downcast eyes-thinking perhaps of the anguish
  to come, and putting up a silent prayer.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* This tree was regarded as the symbol of fertility, on
  account of its many-seeded fruit. ]</p>

  <p>Damia followed with the female friends of the house, the clients and their
  wives and some personal attendants, all carrying pomegranates in the right
  hand, and holding in the left a long wreath of flowers which thus connected
  the whole procession.</p>

  <p>In this order they reached the ship-yard; but at that spot they were met
  by a band of crazy monks from the desert monasteries, who, seeing the beast
  for sacrifice, abused them loudly, cursing the heathen. The slaves
  indignantly drove them off, but then the starveling anchorites fell upon the
  innocent beast which was the chief abomination in their eyes. The bull tossed
  his huge head, snuffing and snorting to right and left, stuck out his tail
  and rushed away from the boy whose guidance he had till now meekly followed,
  flung a monk high in the air with his huge horns, and then turned in his fury
  on the women who were behind.</p>

  <p>They fled like a flock of doves on which a hawk comes swooping down; some
  were driven quite into the lake and others up against the paling of the
  shipyard, while Damia herself&mdash;who was going through it all again in the
  midst of her efforts to rise to the divinity&mdash;and the young wife whom
  she had vainly tried to shelter and support, were both knocked down. To that
  hour of terror Gorgo owed her birth, while to her mother it was death.</p>

  <p>On the following day Alexandria beheld a funeral ceremony as solemn, as
  magnificent, and as crowded as though a conquering hero were being entombed;
  it was that of the monk whom the bull had gored; the Bishop had proclaimed
  that by this attack on the abomination of desolation&mdash;the
  blood-sacrifice of idolatry&mdash;he had won an eternal crown in
  Paradise.</p>

  <p>But now the black ravens crossed Damia's vision once more, till presently
  a handsome young Greek gaily drove them off with his thyrsus. His powerful
  and supple limbs shone with oil, applied in the gymnasium of Timagetes, the
  scene of his frequent triumphs in all the sports and exercises of the
  youthful Greeks. His features and waving hair were those of her son Apelles;
  but suddenly his aspect changed: he was an emaciated penitent, his knees bent
  under the weight of a heavy cross; his widow, Mary, had declared him a martyr
  to the cause of the crucified Jew and defamed his memory in the eyes of his
  own son and of all men. Damia clenched her trembling hands. Again those
  ravens came swirling round, flapping their wings wildly over the prostrate
  penitent.</p>

  <p>Then her husband appeared to her, calmly indifferent to the birds of ill-
  omen. He looked just as she remembered him many&mdash;so many years ago, when
  he had come in smiling and said: "The best stroke of business I ever did! For
  a sprinkling of water I have secured the corn trade with Thessalonica and
  Constantinople; that is a hundred gold solidi for each drop."</p>

  <p>Yes, he had made a good bargain. The profits of that day's work were
  multiplied by tens, and water, nothing in the world but Nile
  water&mdash;Baptismal water the priest had called it&mdash;had filled her
  son's money-bags, too, and had turned their plot of land into broad estates;
  but it had been tacitly understood that this sprinkling of water established
  a claim for a return, and this both father and son had solemnly promised. Its
  magic turned everything they touched to gold, but it brought a blight on the
  peace of the household. One branch, which had grown up in the traditions of
  the old Macedonian stock, had separated from the other; and her husband's
  great lie lay between them and the family still living in the Canopic way,
  like a wide ocean embittered with the salt of hatred. That he had infused
  poison into his son's life and compelled him, proud as he was, to forfeit the
  dignity of a free and high-minded man. Though devoted in his heart to the old
  gods he had humbled himself, year after year, to bow the knee with the hated
  votaries of the Christian faith, and in their church, to their crucified
  Lord, and had publicly confessed Christ. The water&mdash;the terrible
  thaumaturgic stream&mdash;clung to him more inseparably than the brand-mark
  on a slave's arm. It could neither be dried up nor wiped away; for if the
  false Christian, who was really a zealous heathen, had boldly confessed the
  Olympian gods and abjured the odious new faith, the gifts of the all-powerful
  water and all the possessions of their old family would be confiscated to the
  State and Church, and the children of Porphyrius, the grandchildren of the
  wealthy Damia, would be beggars. And this&mdash;all this&mdash;for the sake
  of a crucified Jew.</p>

  <p>The gods be praised the end of all this wretchedness was at hand! A thrill
  of ecstasy ran through her as she reflected that with herself and her
  children, every soul, everything that bore the name of Christian would be
  crushed, shattered and annihilated. She could have laughed aloud but that her
  throat was so dry, her tongue so parched; but her scornful triumph was
  expressed in every feature, as her fancy showed her Marcus riding along the
  Canopic street with that little heathen hussy Dada, the singing girl, while
  her much-hated daughter-in-law looked after them, beating her forehead in
  grief and rage.</p>

  <p>Quite beside herself with delight the old woman rocked backwards and
  forwards in her chair; not for long, however, for the black birds seemed to
  fill the whole room, describing swift, interminable spirals round her head.
  She could not hear them, but she could see them, and the whirling vortex
  fascinated her; she could not help turning her head to follow their flight;
  she grew giddy and she was forced to try to recover her balance.</p>

  <p>The old woman sat huddled in her chair, her hands convulsively clutching
  the arms, like a horseman whose steed has run away with him round and round
  the arena; till at length, worn out by excitement and exhaustion, she became
  unconscious, and sank in a heap on the ground, rigid and apparently
  lifeless.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Gorgo, when she had left her grandmother, could not rest.
  Her lofty calmness of demeanor had given way to a restless mood such as she
  had always contemned severely in others, since she had ceased to be a
  vehement child and grown to be a woman. She tried to beguile the alarm that
  made her pulses beat so quickly, and the heart-sickness that ached like a
  wound, by music and singing; but this only added to her torment. The means by
  which she could usually recover her equanimity of mind had lost their
  efficacy, and Sappho's longing hymn, which she began to sing, had only served
  to bring the fervid longing of her own heart to light&mdash;to set it, as it
  were, in the full glare of the sun. She had become aware that every fibre,
  every nerve of her being yearned for the man she loved; she would have thrown
  away her life like a hollow nut for one single hour of perfect joy with him
  and in him. The faith in the old gods, the heathen world which contained the
  ideal of her young soul, her detestation of Christianity, her beautiful
  art&mdash;everything, in short, that had filled the spiritual side of her
  life, was cast into the shade by the one absorbing passion that possessed her
  soul. Every feeling, every instinct, urged her to abandon herself entirely to
  her lover, and yet she never for one instant doubted which side she would
  take in the approaching conflict of the great powers that ruled the world.
  The last few hours had only confirmed her conviction that the end of all
  things was at hand. The world was on the eve of destruction; she foresaw that
  she must perish&mdash;perish with Constantine, and that, in her eyes, was a
  grace from the gods.</p>

  <p>While Damia was vainly struggling to liberate her soul from the bondage of
  the flesh, Gorgo had been wandering uneasily about the house; now going to
  the slaves, encouraging them with brave words, and giving them employment to
  keep them from utter desperation, and then stealing up to see whether her
  grandmother might not by this time be in need of her. As it grew dark she
  observed that several of the women, and even some of the men, had made their
  escape. These were such as had already shown a leaning towards the new faith,
  and who now made off to join their fellow-Christians, or to seek refuge in
  the churches under the protection of the crucified God whose supreme power
  might, perhaps, even yet, avert the impending catastrophe.</p>

  <p>Twice had Porphyrius sent a messenger to assure his mother and daughter
  that all was well with him, that a powerful party was prepared to defend the
  Serapeum, and that he should pass the night in the temple. The Romans were
  evidently hesitating to attack it, and if, next morning, the heathen should
  succeed in repelling the first onset, reinforcements might yet be brought up
  in time. Gorgo could not share these hopes; a client of her father's had
  brought in a rumor that the Biamites, after advancing as far as Naucratis,
  had been dispersed by a few of the Imperial maniples. Fate was stalking on
  its way, and no one could give it pause.</p>

  <p>The evening brought no coolness, and when it was already quite dark, as
  her grandmother had not yet called her, Gorgo could no longer control her
  increasing anxiety, so, after knocking in vain at the door of the
  observatory, she went in. Her old nurse preceded her with a lamp, and the two
  women stood dumb with consternation, for the old lady lay senseless on the
  ground. Her head was thrown back against the seat of the chair off which she
  had slipped, and her pale face was lifeless and horrible to look at, with its
  half-closed eyes and dropped jaw. Wine, water, and strong essences were all
  at hand, and they laid the unconscious woman on a couch intended for the
  occasional use of the wearied observer. In a few minutes they had succeeded
  in reviving the old lady; but her eyes rested without recognition on the girl
  who knelt by her side, and she murmured to herself: "The ravens&mdash;where
  are they gone? Ravens!"</p>

  <p>Her glance wandered round the room, to the tablets and rolls which had
  been tossed off the couch and the table to make room for her, and for the
  lamps and medicaments. They lay in disorder on the floor, and the sight of
  this confusion produced a favorable excitement and reaction; she succeeded in
  expressing herself in husky accents and broken, hardly intelligible
  sentences, so far as to scold them sharply for their irreverence for the
  precious documents, and for the disorder they had created. The waiting-woman
  proceeded to pick them up: but Damia again became unconscious. Gorgo bathed
  her brow and tried to pour some wine between her teeth, but she clenched them
  too firmly, till the slave-woman came to her assistance and they succeeded in
  making Damia swallow a few drops. The old woman opened her eyes, smacking her
  tongue feebly; but she took the cup into her own hand to hold it to her lips;
  and though she trembled so that half the contents were spilt, she drank
  eagerly till it was quite empty. "More," she gasped with the eagerness of
  intense thirst, "more&mdash;I want drink!"</p>

  <p>Gorgo gave her a second and a third draught which Damia drank with equal
  eagerness; then, with a deep breath, she looked up fully conscious, at her
  granddaughter.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, child," she said. "Now I shall do very well for a little
  while. The material world and all that belongs to it weighs us down and
  clings to us like iron fetters. We may long and strive to be free, but it
  pursues us and holds us fast. Only those who are content with their miserable
  humanity can enjoy it. They laugh, as you know, at Praxilla, the poetess,
  because she makes the dying Adonis lament, when face to face with death, that
  he is forced to leave the apples and pears behind him. But is not that subtly
  true? Yes, yes; Praxilla is right! We fast, we mortify ourselves&mdash;I have
  felt it all myself&mdash;to partake of divinity. We almost perish of hunger
  and thirst, when we might be so happy if only we would be satisfied with
  apples and pears! No man has ever yet succeeded in the great effort; those
  who would be truly happy must be content with small things. That is what
  makes children so happy. Apples and pears! Well, everything will be at an end
  for me ere long&mdash;even those. But if the great First Cause spares himself
  in the universal crash, there is still the grand idea of Apples and Pears;
  and who knows but that it may please Him, when this world is destroyed, to
  frame another to come after it. Will He then once more embody the ideas of
  Man&mdash;and Apples and Pears? It would be plagiarism from himself. Nay, if
  He is merciful, He will never again give substance to that hybrid idea called
  Man; or, if He does, He will let the poor wretch be happy with apples and
  pears&mdash;I mean trivial joys; for all higher joys, be they what they may,
  are vanity and vexation... Give me another draught. Ah, that is good! And
  to-morrow is the end. I could find it in my heart to regret the good gifts of
  Dionysus myself; it is better than apples and pears; next to that comes the
  joy that Eros bestows on mortals, and there must be an end to all that, too.
  That, however, is above the level of apples and pears. It is great, very
  great happiness, and mingled therefor with bitter sorrow. Rapture and
  anguish&mdash;who can lay down the border line that divides them? Smiles and
  tears alike belong to both. And you are weeping? Aye, aye&mdash;poor child!
  Come here and kiss me." Damia drew the head of the kneeling girl close to her
  bosom and pressed her lips to Gorge's brow. Presently, however, she relaxed
  her embrace and, looking about the room, she exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"How you have mixed and upset the book-rolls! If only I could show you how
  clearly everything agrees and coincides. We know now exactly how it will all
  happen. By the day after to-morrow there will be no more earth, no more sky;
  and I will tell you this, child: If, when Serapis falls, the universe does
  not crumble to pieces like a ruinous hovel, then the wisdom of the Magians is
  a lie, the course of the stars has nothing to do with the destinies of the
  earth and its inhabitants, the planets are mere lamps, the sun is no more
  than a luminous furnace, the old gods are marsh-fires, emanations from the
  dark bog of men's minds&mdash;and the great Serapis... But why be angry with
  him? There is no doubt&mdash;no if nor but... Give me the diptychon and I
  will show you our doom. There&mdash;just here&mdash;my sight is so dazzled, I
  cannot make it out.&mdash;And if I could, what matter? Who can alter here
  below what has been decided above? Leave me to sleep now, and I will explain
  it all to you to-morrow if there is still time. Poor child, when I think how
  we have tormented you to learn what you know, and how industrious you have
  been! And now&mdash;to what end? I ask you, to what end? The great gulf will
  swallow up one and all."</p>

  <p>"So be it, so be it!" cried Gorgo interrupting her. "Then, at any rate,
  nothing that I love on earth will be lost to me before I die!"</p>

  <p>"And the enemy will perish in the same ruin!" continued Damia, her eyes
  sparkling with revived fire. "But where shall we go to&mdash;where? The soul
  is divine by nature and cannot be destroyed. It must return&mdash;say, am I
  right or wrong?&mdash;It will return to its first fount and cause; for like
  attracts and absorbs like, and thus our deification, our union with the god
  will be accomplished."</p>

  <p>"I believe it&mdash;I am sure of it!" replied Gorgo with conviction.</p>

  <p>"You are sure of it?" retorted the old woman. "But I am not. For our
  clearest knowledge is but guesswork when it is not based on numbers. Nothing
  is proved or provable but by numbers, but they are surer than the rocks in
  the sea; that is why I believe in our coming doom, for, on those tablets, we
  have calculated it to a certainty. But who can calculate evidence of the
  future fate of the soul? If, indeed, the old order should not pass
  away&mdash;if the depths should remain below and the empyrean still keep its
  place above&mdash;then, to be sure, your studies would not be in vain; for
  then your soul, which is fixed on spiritual, supernatural and sublime
  conceptions, would be drawn upwards to the great Intelligence of which it is
  the offspring, to the very god, and become one with him&mdash;absorbed into
  him, as the rain-drop fallen from a cloud rises again and is reunited to its
  parent vapor. Then&mdash;for there may be a metempsychosis&mdash;your songful
  spirit might revive to inform a nightingale, then ..."</p>

  <p>Damia paused; and gazed upwards as if in ecstasy, and it was not till a
  few minutes later that she went on, with a changed expression in her face:
  "Then my son's widow, Mary, would be hatched out of a serpent's egg and would
  creep a writhing asp... Great gods! the ravens! What can they mean? They come
  again. Air, air! Wine! I cannot&mdash;I am choking&mdash;take it
  away!&mdash;To-morrow&mdash;to-day... Everything is going; do you
  see&mdash;do you feel? It is all black&mdash;no, red; and now black again.
  Everything is sinking; hold me, save me; the floor is going from under
  me.&mdash;Where is Porphyrius? Where is my son?&mdash;My feet are so cold;
  rub them. It is the water! rising&mdash;it is up to my knees. I am
  sinking&mdash;help! save me! help!" The dying woman fought with her arms as
  if she were drowning; her cries for help grew fainter, her head drooped on
  her laboring chest, and in a few minutes she had breathed her last in her
  grandchild's arms, and her restless, suffering soul was free.</p>

  <p>Never before had Gorgo seen death. She could not persuade herself that the
  heart which had been so cold for others, but had throbbed so warmly and
  tenderly for her, was now stilled for ever; that the spirit which, even in
  sleep, had never been at rest, had now found eternal peace. The slave-woman
  had hastily taken her place, had closed the dead woman's eyes and mouth, and
  done all she could to diminish the horror of the scene, and the terrible
  aspect of the dead in the sight of the girl who had been her one darling. But
  Gorgo had remained by her side, and, while she did everything in her power to
  revive the stiffening body, the overwhelming might of Death had come home to
  her with appalling clearness. She felt the limbs of one she had loved growing
  cold and rigid under her hands, and her spirit rose in obstinate rebellion
  against the idea that annihilation stood between her and the woman who had so
  amply filled a mother's place. She insisted on having every method of
  resuscitation tried that had ever been heard of, and made her nurse send for
  physicians, though the woman solemnly assured her that human help was of no
  avail: then she sent for the priest of Saturn who&mdash;as the dead woman
  herself had told her&mdash;knew mighty spells which had called back many a
  departed spirit to the body it had quitted.</p>

  <p>When, at last, she was alone and gazed on the hard, set features of the
  dead, though she shuddered with horror, she so far controlled herself as to
  press her lips in sorrow and gratitude to the thin hand whose caresses she
  had been wont to accept as a mere matter of course. How cold and heavy it
  was! She shivered and dropped it, and the large rings on the fingers rattled
  on the wooden frame of the couch. There was no hope; she understood that her
  friend and mother was indeed dead and silent forever.</p>

  <p>Deep and bitter grief overwhelmed her completely, with the sense of
  abandoned loneliness, the humiliating feeling of helplessness against a
  brutal power that marches on, scorning humanity, as a warrior treads down the
  grass and flowers in his path. She fell on her knees by the corpse, sobbing
  passionately, and crying like an indignant child when a stronger companion
  has robbed it of some precious possession. She wept with rage at her own
  impotence; and her tears flowed faster and faster as she more fully realized
  how lonely she was, and what a blow this must be to her father. In this hour
  no pleasant reminiscences of past family happiness came to infuse a drop of
  sweetness into the bitterness of her grief. Only one reflection brought her
  any comfort, and that was the thought that the grave which had yawned already
  for her grandmother would soon, very soon, open for herself and all living
  souls. On the table, close at hand, lay the evidence of their impending doom,
  and a longing for that end gradually took complete possession of her,
  excluding every other feeling. Thinking of this she rose from her knees and
  ceased to weep.</p>

  <p>When, presently, her waiting-woman should return, she was resolved to
  leave the house at once; she could not bear to stay; her feelings and duty
  alike indicated the place where she might find the last hour's happiness that
  she expected or desired of life. Her father must learn from herself, and not
  from a stranger, of the loss that had befallen them, and she knew that he was
  in the Serapeum&mdash;on the very spot where she might hope next morning to
  meet Constantine. It would be her lover's duty to open the gate to
  destruction, and she would be there to pass through it at his side.</p>

  <p>She waited a long, long time, but at last there was a noise on the stairs.
  That was her nurse's step, but she was not alone. Had she brought the leech
  and the exorciser? The door opened and the old steward came in, carrying a
  three-branched lamp; then followed the slave-woman, and then&mdash;her heart
  stood still then came Constantine and his mother.</p>

  <p>Gorgo, pale and speechless, received her unexpected visitors. The nurse
  had failed to find the physician, whose aid would, at any rate, have come too
  late; and as the housekeeper had taken herself off with others of the
  Christian slaves, the faithful soul had said to herself that "her child"
  would want some womanly help and comfort in her trouble, and had gone to the
  house of their neighbor Clemens, to entreat his wife to come with her to see
  the dead, and visit her forlorn young mistress. Constantine, who had come
  home a short time previously, had said nothing, but had accompanied the two
  women.</p>

  <p>While Constantine gazed with no unkindly feelings at the still face of
  Damia&mdash;to whom, after all, he owed many a little debt of
  kindness&mdash;and then turned to look at Gorgo who stood downcast, pale, and
  struggling to breathe calmly, Dame Marianne tried to proffer a few words of
  consolation. She warmly praised everything in the dead woman which was not in
  her estimation absolutely reprobate and godless, and brought forward all the
  comforting arguments which a pious Christian can command for the edification
  and encouragement of those who mourn a beloved friend; but to Gorgo all this
  well-meant discourse was as the babble of an unknown tongue; and it was only
  when, at length, Marianne went up to her and drew her to her motherly bosom,
  to kiss her, and bid her be welcome under Clelnens' roof till Porphyrius
  should be at home again, that she understood that the good woman meant
  kindly, and honestly desired to help and comfort her.</p>

  <p>But the allusion to her father reminded her of the first duty in her path;
  she roused her energies, thanked Marianne warmly, and begged her only to
  assist her in carrying the corpse into the thalamos, and then to take charge
  of the keys. She herself, she explained, meant at once to seek her father,
  since he ought to learn from no one but herself of his mother's death. Nor
  would she listen for a moment to her friend's pressing entreaties that she
  would put off this task, and pass the night, at any rate, under her roof.</p>

  <p>Constantine had kept in the background; it was not till Gorgo approached
  the dead and gave the order to carry the body down into the house that he
  came forward, and with simple feeling offered her his hand. The girl looked
  frankly in his face, and, as she put her hand in his, she said in a low
  voice: "I was unjust to you, Constantine. I insulted and hurt you; but I
  repented sincerely, even before you had left the house. And you owe me no
  grudge, I know, for you understood how forlorn I must be and came to see me.
  There is no ill-feeling, is there, nothing to come between us?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, nothing!" he eagerly exclaimed, seizing her other hand with
  passionate fervor.</p>

  <p>She felt as if all the blood in her body had rushed in a full tide to her
  heart&mdash;as if he were some part of her very being, that had been torn
  out, snatched from her, and that she must have back again, even if it cost
  them both their life and happiness. The impulse was irresistible; she drew
  away her hands from his grasp and flung them round his neck, clinging to him
  as a weary child clings to its mother. She did not know how it had come
  about&mdash;how such a thing was possible, but it was done; and without
  paying any heed to Marianne, who looked on in dismay while her son's lips
  were pressed to the brow and lips of the lovely idolatress, she wept upon her
  lover's shoulders, feeling a thousand roses blossoming in her soul and a
  thousand thorns piercing and tearing her heart.</p>

  <p>It had to be, that she felt; it was at once their union and their parting.
  Their common destiny was but for a moment, and that moment had come and gone.
  All that now retrained for them was death&mdash;destruction, with all things
  living; and she looked forward to this, as a man watches for the dawn after a
  sleepless night. Marianne stood aside; she dimly perceived that something
  vital was going on, that something inevitable had happened which would admit
  of no interference. Gorgo, as she freed herself from Constantine's embrace,
  stood strangely solemn and unapproachable. To the simple matron she was an
  inscrutable riddle to which she could find no clue; but she was pleased,
  nevertheless, when Gorgo came up to her and kissed her hand. She could not
  utter a word, for she felt that whatever she might say, it would not be the
  right thing; and it was a real relief to her to busy herself over the removal
  of the body, in which she could be helpful.</p>

  <p>Gorgo had covered the dead face; and when old Damia had been carried down
  to the thalamos and laid in state on the bridal bed, she strewed the couch
  with flowers.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the priest of Saturn had been found, and he declared in all
  confidence that no power on earth could have recalled this departed soul.
  Damia's sudden end and the girl's great grief went to his faithful heart, and
  he gladly acceded to Gorgo's request that he would wait for her by the
  garden-gate and escort her to the Serapeum. When he had left them she gave
  the keys of her grandmother's chests and cupboards into Marianne's keeping;
  then she went into the adjoining room, where Constantine had been waiting
  while she decked the bed of death, and bid him a solemn, but apparently calm,
  farewell. He put out his arm to clasp her to his heart, but this she would
  not permit; and when he besought her to go home with them she answered sadly,
  "No, my dearest ... I must not; I have other duties to fulfil."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied emphatically, "and I, too&mdash;I have mine. But you
  have given yourself to me. You are my very own; you belong to me only, and
  not to yourself; and I desire, I command you to yield to my first request. Go
  with my mother, or stay here, if you will, with the dead. Wherever your
  father may be, it is not, cannot be, the right place for you&mdash;my
  betrothed bride. I can guess where he is. Oh! Gorgo, be warned.</p>

  <p>"The fate of the old gods is sealed. We are the stronger and to-morrow,
  yes to-morrow&mdash;by your own head, by all I hold dear and
  sacred!&mdash;Serapis will fall!"</p>

  <p>"I know it," she said firmly. "And you are charged to lay hands on the
  god?"</p>

  <p>"I am, and I shall do it."</p>

  <p>She nodded approbation and then said submissively and sweetly: "It is your
  duty, and you cannot do otherwise. And come what may we are one, Constantine,
  forever one. Nothing can part us. Whatever the future may bring, we belong to
  each other, to stand or fall together. I with you, you with me, till the end
  of time." She gave him her hand and looked lovingly into his eyes; then she
  threw herself into his mother's arms and kissed her fondly.</p>

  <p>"Come, come with me, my child," said Marianne; but Gorgo freed herself,
  exclaiming: "Go, go; if you love me leave me; go and let me be alone."</p>

  <p>She went back into the thalamos where the dead lay at peace, and before
  the others could follow her she had opened a door hidden behind some tapestry
  near the bed, and fled into the garden.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The night was hot and gloomy. Heavy clouds gathered in the
  north, and wreaths of mist, like a hot vapor-bath, swayed over the
  crisply-foaming wavelets that curled the lustreless waters of the Mareotis
  Lake. The moon peeped, pale and shrouded, out of a russet halo, and ghostly
  twilight reigned in the streets, still heated by the baked walls of the
  houses.</p>

  <p>To the west, over the desert, a dull sulphurous yellow streaked the black
  clouds, and from time to time the sultry air was rent by a blinding flash
  sent across the firmament from the north. There was a hot, sluggish wind
  blowing from the southwest, which drove the sand across the lake into the
  streets; the fine grit stung: and burnt the face of the wanderer who hurried
  on with half-closed eyes and tightly-shut lips. A deep oppression seemed to
  have fallen on nature and on man; the sudden gusts of the heated breeze, the
  arrow-like shafts of lightning, the weird shapes and colors of the clouds,
  all combined to give a sinister, baleful and portentous aspect to this night,
  as though skies and waters, earth and air were brooding over some tremendous
  catastrophe.</p>

  <p>Gorgo had thrown a veil and handkerchief round her head and followed the
  priest with an aching brow and throbbing heart. When she heard a step behind
  her she started-for it might be Constantine following her up; when a gust of
  wind flung the stinging sand in her face, or the storm-flash threw a lurid
  light on the sky, her heart stood still, for was not this the prelude to the
  final crash.</p>

  <p>She was familiar with the way they were going, but its length seemed to
  have stretched tenfold. At last, however, they reached their destination. She
  gave the pass-word at the gate of her father's timber-yard and exchanged the
  signs agreed upon; in a few minutes she had made her way through the piles of
  beams and planks that screened the entrance to the aqueduct&mdash;a slave who
  knew her leading the way with a light&mdash;and she and her companion entered
  the underground passage.</p>

  <p>It was hot and close; bats, scared by the flare of the torch, fluttered
  round her with a ghostly rustle, startling and disgusting her; still, she
  felt less alarm here than outside; and when, as she went forward she thought
  of the great temple she was coming to, of its wonderful beauty and solemn
  majesty, she only cared to press onward to that refuge of ineffable splendor
  where all would be peace. To die there, to perish there with her lover, did
  not seem hard; nay, she felt proud to think that she might await death in the
  noblest edifice ever raised to a god by mortal hands. Here Fate might have
  its way; she had known the highest joy she had ever dreamed of, and where on
  earth was there a sublimer tomb than this sanctuary of the sovereign of the
  universe, whose supremacy even the other gods acknowledged with
  trembling!</p>

  <p>She had known the sacred halls of the temple from her childhood, and she
  pictured them as filled with thousands of lofty souls, united in this supreme
  hour by one feeling and one purpose. She even fancied she could hear the
  inspired and heartfelt strains of the enthusiasts who were prepared to give
  their lives for the god of their fathers, that she breathed the odor of
  incense and burnt sacrifices, that she saw the chorus of youths and maidens,
  led by priests and dancing with solemn grace in mazy circles round the
  flower-decked altars. There among the elders who had gathered round Olympius
  to meditate devoutly on the coming doom and on the inmost meaning of the
  mysteries&mdash;among the adepts who were anxiously noting, in the
  observatories of the Serapeum, the fateful courses of the stars, the swirling
  of the clouds and the flight of birds, she would doubtless find her father;
  and the fresh wound bled anew as she remembered that she was the bearer of
  news which must deeply shock and grieve him. Still, no doubt, she would find
  him wrapped in dignified readiness for the worst, sorrowing serenely for the
  doomed world, and so her melancholy message would come to a prepared and
  resigned heart.</p>

  <p>She had no fear of the crowd of men she would find in the Serapeum. Her
  father and Olympius were there to protect her, and Dame Herse, too, would be
  a support and comfort; but even without those three, on such a night as
  this&mdash;the last perhaps that they might ever see&mdash;she would have
  ventured without hesitation among thousands, for she firmly believed that
  every votary of the gods was awaiting his own end and the crash of falling
  skies with devout expectancy, and perhaps with not less terror than
  herself.</p>

  <p>These were her thoughts as she and her guide stopped at a strong door.
  This was presently opened and they found themselves in an underground
  chamber, devoted to the mysteries of the worship of Serapis, in which the
  adepts were required to go through certain severe ordeals before they were
  esteemed worthy to be received into the highest order of the
  initiated&mdash;the Esoterics. The halls and corridors which she now went
  through, and which she had never before seen, were meagrely lighted with
  lamps and torches, and all that met her eye filled her with reverent awe
  while it excited her imagination. Everything, in fact&mdash;every room and
  every image&mdash;was as unlike nature, and as far removed from ordinary
  types as possible, in arrangement and appearance. After passing through a
  pyramidal room, with triangular sides that sloped to a point, she came to one
  in the shape of a polygonal prism. In a long, broad corridor she had to walk
  on a narrow path, bordered by sphinxes; and there she clung tightly to her
  guide, for on one side of the foot-way yawned a gulf of great depth. In
  another place she heard, above her head, the sound of rushing waters, which
  then fell into the abyss beneath with a loud roar. After this she came upon a
  large grotto, hewn in the living rock and defended by a row of staring
  crocodiles' heads, plated with gold; the heavy smell of stale incense and
  acrid resins choked her, and her way now lay over iron gratings and past
  strangely contrived furnaces. The walls were decorated with colored reliefs:
  Tantalus, Ixion, and Sisyphus toiling at his stone, looked down on her in
  hideous realism as she went. Rock chambers, fast closed with iron doors, as
  though they enclosed inestimable treasures or inscrutable secrets, lay on
  either hand, and her dress swept against numerous images and vessels closely
  shrouded in hangings.</p>

  <p>When she ventured to look round, her eye fell on monstrous forms and
  mystical signs and figures; if she glanced upwards, she saw human and animal
  forms, and mixed with these the various constellations, sailing in
  boats&mdash;the Egyptian notion of their motions&mdash;along the back of a
  woman stretched out to an enormous length; or, again, figures by some Greek
  artist: the Pleiades, Castor and Pollux as horsemen with stars on their
  heads, and Berenice's star-gemmed hair.</p>

  <p>The effect on the girl was bewildering, overpowering, as she made her way
  through this underground world. The things she had glimpses of were very
  sparely illuminated, nay scarcely discernible, and yet appallingly real; what
  mysteries, what spells might not be hidden in all she did not see! She felt
  as if the end of life, which she was looking for, had already begun, as if
  she had already gone down, alive, into Hades.</p>

  <p>The path gradually sloped upwards and at last she ascended, by a spiral
  staircase, to the ground-floor of the temple. Once or twice she had met a few
  men, but solemn silence reigned in those subterranean chambers.</p>

  <p>The sound of their approaching and receding steps had only served to make
  her aware of the complete stillness. This was just as it should be&mdash;just
  as she would have it. This peace reminded her of the profound silence of
  nature before a tempest bursts and rages.</p>

  <p>Gorgo took off her veil as she went up the stairs, shook out the folds of
  her dress, and assumed the dignified and reverent demeanor which became a
  young girl of rank and position when approaching the altars of the divinity.
  But as she reached the top a loud medley of noises and voices met her
  ear-flutes, drums?&mdash;The sacred dance, she supposed, must be going
  on.</p>

  <p>She came out into a room on one side of the hypostyle; her companion
  opened a high door, plated with gilt bronze and silver, and Gorgo followed
  him, walking gravely with her head held high and her eyes fixed on the
  ground, into the magnificent hall where the sacred image sat enthroned in
  veiled majesty. They crossed the colonnade at the side of the hypostyle and
  went down two steps into the vast nave of the temple.</p>

  <p>The wild tumult that she had heard on first opening the door had surprised
  and puzzled her; but now, as she timidly looked up and around her, she felt a
  shock of horror and revulsion such as might come over a man who, walking by
  night and believing that he is treading on flowers, suddenly finds that the
  slimy slope of a bottomless bog is leading him to perdition. She tottered and
  clutched at a statue, gazing about her, listening to the uproar, and
  wondering whether she were awake or dreaming.</p>

  <p>She tried not to see and hear what was going on there; it was revolting,
  loathsome, horrible; but it was too manifest to be overlooked or ignored; its
  vulgarity and horror forced it on her attention. For some time she stood
  spell-bound, paralyzed; but then she covered her face with her hands;
  maidenly shame, bitter disillusion, and pious indignation at the gross
  desecration of all that she deemed most sacred and inviolable surged up in
  her stricken soul, and she burst into tears, weeping as she had never wept in
  all her life before. Sobbing bitterly, she wrapped her face in her veil, as
  though to protect herself from storm and chill.</p>

  <p>No one heeded her; her companion had left her to seek her father. She
  could only await his return, and she looked round for a hiding place. Then
  she observed a woman in mourning garb sitting huddled at the foot of the
  statue of justice; she recognized her as the widow of Asclepiodorus and
  breathed more freely as she went up to her and said, between her sobs "Let me
  sit by you; we can mourn together."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, come," said the other; and without enquiring what Gorgo's
  trouble might be, moved only by the mysterious charm of finding another in
  like sorrow with herself, she drew the girl to her and bending over her, at
  length found relief in tears.</p>

  <p>The two weeping women sat in silence, side by side, while in front of them
  the orgy went on its frantic course. A party of men and women were dancing
  down the hall, singing and shouting. Flutes yelled, cymbals clanged, drums
  rattled and droned, without either time or tune. Drunken pastophori had flung
  open the rooms where the vestments and sacred vessels were kept, and from
  these treasuries the ribald mob had dragged forth panther-skins such as the
  priests wore when performing the sacred functions, brass cars for carrying
  sacrifices, wooden biers on which the images of the gods were borne in solemn
  processions, and other precious objects. In a large room adjoining, a party
  of students and girls were concocting some grand scheme for which they needed
  much time and large supplies of wine; but most of those who had possessed
  themselves of the plunder had taken it into the hypostyle and were vying with
  each other in extravagant travesties.</p>

  <p>A burly wine-grower was elected to represent Dionysus and was seated with
  nothing but some wreaths of flowers to cover his naked limbs, in a
  four-wheeled sacrificial car of beaten brass. An alabaster wine-jar stood
  between his fat knees, and his heavy body rolled with laughter as he was
  drawn in triumph through the sacred arcades by a shouting rabble, as fast as
  they could run. Numbers of the intoxicated crew, mad with excitement and
  wine, had cast off their clothes which lay in heaps between the pillars,
  soaking in puddles of spilt wine. In their wild dance the girls' hair had
  fallen about their heated faces, tangled with withered leaves and faded
  flowers, and the men, young and old alike, leaped and waltzed like possessed
  creatures, flourishing thyrsus-staves and the emblems of the lusty
  wine-god.</p>

  <p>A small band of priests and philosophers ventured into the chaos in the
  hope of quelling the riot, but a tipsy flute-player placed himself in front
  of them and throwing back his head blew a furious blast to heaven on his
  double pipe, shrill enough to wake the dead, while a girl seconded him by
  flinging her tambourine in the face of the intruding pacificators. It bounced
  against the shaft of a column, and then fell on the shaven head of a
  priestling, who seized it and tossed it back. The game was soon taken up, and
  before long, one tambourine after another was flying over the heads of the
  frenzied crew. Every one was eager to have one, and sprung to catch them,
  scuffling and struggling and making the parchment sound on his neighbor's
  head.</p>

  <p>Some of the women had jumped on to the processional biers and were being
  carried round the hall by staggering youths, screaming with alarm and
  laughter; if one of them lost her balance and fell she was captured with
  shrieks of merriment and forced to mount her insecure eminence again.
  Presently the car of Dionysus came to wreck over the body of an unconscious
  toper, but no one stopped to set it right; and though the hapless
  representative of the god howled loudly to them to stop while he extricated
  himself from the machine, in which he had stuck, it was in vain; the score or
  so of youths who were dragging it tore on, passing close by Gorgo, who noted
  with indignation, that the brasswork of the axles was cutting deeply into the
  splendid mosaic of the pavement. At last the burly god fell out by his sheer
  weight, and his followers restored him to consciousness by taking him by the
  heels and dipping his towzled and bleeding head into a huge jar of wine and
  water. Then some hundreds of his drunken votaries danced madly round the
  rescued god; and as all the tambourines were split and the flute-players had
  no breath left, time was kept by beating with thyrsus-staves against the
  pillars, while three men, who had found the brazen tubas among the temple
  vessels, blew with all their might and main.</p>

  <p>Strong opposition, however, was roused by this mad uproar. A party of
  worshippers, in the first place, rebelled against it; these had been standing
  with veiled heads, near the statue of Serapis, muttering exorcisms after a
  Magian and howling lamentably at intervals; then a preacher, who had
  succeeded in collecting a little knot of listeners, bid the trumpeters cease;
  and finally, a party of actors and singers, who had assembled in the outer
  hall to perform a satira play, tried to stop them, though they themselves
  were making such a noise that the trumpet-blast could have affected them but
  little. When the players found that remonstrance had no effect they rushed
  into the hypostyle and tried to reduce the musicians to silence by force.</p>

  <p>Then a frenzied contest began; but the combatants were soon separated; the
  actors and their antagonists fell on each other's necks, and a Homeric poet,
  who had compiled an elegy for the evening on the "Gods coerced by the hosts
  of the new superstition," made up simply of lines culled from the Iliad and
  Odyssey, seized this favorable opportunity. He had begun to read it at the
  top of his voice, screaming down the general din, when everything was
  forgotten in the excitement caused by the entrance of a procession which was
  the successful result of many raids on the temple-treasuries and
  lumber-rooms.</p>

  <p>A storm of applause greeted its appearance; the tipsiest stammered out his
  approval, and the picture presented to drunken eyes was indeed a beautiful
  and gorgeous one. On a high platform-intended for the display of a small
  image of Serapis and certain symbols of the god, at great
  festivals&mdash;Glycera, the loveliest hetaira of the town, was drawn in
  triumph through the temple. She reclined in a sort of bowl representing a
  shell, placed at the top of the platform, and on the lower stages sat groups
  of fair girls, swaying gently with luxurious grace, and flinging flowers down
  to the crowd who, with jealous rivalry, strove to catch them. Everyone
  recognized the beautiful hetaira as Aphrodite, and she was hailed, as with
  one voice, the Queen of the World. The men rushed forward to pour libations
  in her honor, and to join hands and dance in a giddy maze round her car.</p>

  <p>"Take her to Serapis!" shouted a drunken student. "Marry her to the god.
  Heavenly Love should be his bride!"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;take her to Serapis," yelled another. "It is the wedding of
  Serapis and Glycera."</p>

  <p>The crazy rabble pushed the machine towards the curtain, with the
  beautiful, laughing woman on the top, and her bevy of languishing
  attendants.</p>

  <p>Until this instant the vivid lightning outside, and the growling of
  distant thunder had not been heeded by the revellers, but now a blinding
  flash lighted up the hall and, at the same instant, a tremendous peal crashed
  and rattled just above them, and shook the desecrated shrine. A sulphurous
  vapor came rolling in at the openings just below the roof, and this first
  flash was immediately followed by another which seemed to have rent the vault
  of heaven, for it was accompanied by a deafening and stunning roar and a
  terrific rumbling and creaking, as though the metal walls of the firmament
  had burst asunder and fallen in on the earth&mdash;on Alexandria&mdash;on the
  Serapeum.</p>

  <p>The whole awful force of an African tempest came crashing down upon them;
  the wild revel was stilled; the trembling topers dropped their cups, fevered
  checks turned pale, the dancers parted and threw up their hands in agonized
  supplication, words of lust and blasphemy died on their lips and turned to
  prayers and muttered charms. The terrified nymphs that surrounded Venus
  sprang from the car, and the foam-born goddess in the shell tried to free
  herself from the garlands and gauzes in which she was involved, shrieking
  aloud when she perceived that she could not descend unaided from her elevated
  position. Other voices mingled with hers&mdash;lamenting, cursing, and
  entreating; for now the rainclouds burst, and through the window-openings
  poured a cold flood, chilling and wetting the drunken mob within.</p>

  <p>The storm raved through the halls and corridors; lightning and thunder
  raged fiercely overhead; and the terrified wretches, suddenly sobered, rushed
  about or huddled together, like ants whose nest has been upturned. And into
  the midst of this dismayed throng rushed Orpheus, the son of Karnis, who had
  been till now on guard on the roof, crying out: "The world is coming to an
  end, the heavens are opening! Father&mdash;where is my father?"</p>

  <p>And everyone believed him; they snatched off their garlands, tore their
  hair and gave themselves up to the utmost despair. Wailing, sobbing, howling-
  furious, but impotent, they appealed to each other; and though they had no
  hope of living to see another morning, or perhaps another hour, each one
  thought only of himself, of his garments, and of how he might best cover his
  limbs that shivered with terror and cold. From the Scuffling mob round the
  heaps of cast-off clothes came deep groans, piteous weeping, the shrieks of
  women, and the despairing moans of the panic-stricken wretches.</p>

  <p>It was a fearful scene, at once heart-rending and revolting; Gorgo looked
  on, gnashing her teeth with rage and disgust, and only wishing for the end of
  the world and of her own life as a respite from it all. These crazed and
  miserable wretches, cowardly fools, these beasts in the guise of human
  beings, deserved no better than to perish; but was it conceivable that the
  supreme being should destroy the whole of the beautiful and wisely-planned
  world for the sake of this base and loathsome rabble.</p>

  <p>It thundered, it lightened, the foundations of the temple shook&mdash;but
  she no longer looked for the final crash; she had ceased to believe in the
  majesty, the power and the purity of the divinity behind the veil. Her cheeks
  burnt with shame, she felt it a disgrace ever to have been numbered among his
  adherents; and, as the howling of the terrified crowd grew every moment
  louder and wilder, the memory of Constantine's grave and fearless manliness
  rose before her, in all its strength and beauty. She was his, his wholly and
  forever; and for the future all that was his should be hers: his love, his
  home, his noble purpose&mdash;and his God.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The doubtful light of dawn was beginning to break through
  the storm- clouds as they exhausted their fury on the Serapeum, but the
  terrified heathen did not notice it. No captain, no prophet, no comforter had
  come to revive their courage and hopes; for Olympius and his guests, the
  leaders of the intellectual life of Alexandria&mdash;and among them the chief
  priests of the sanctuary&mdash;were tardy in making their appearance.</p>

  <p>The lightning-flash which had fallen on the brassplated cupola, and then
  discharged its force along a flagstaff, had alarmed even the sages and
  philosophers; and the Symposium had come to an abrupt end but little more
  dignified than the orgy in the temple-halls. Few, to be sure, of the high-
  priest's friends had allowed themselves to be so far scared as to betray
  their terrors frankly; on the contrary, when the crack of doom really seemed
  to have sounded, rhetoric and argument grew even more eager than before round
  Olympius' table; and Gorgo's opinion of her fellow-heathen might not have
  been much raised if she could have heard Helladius, the famous philologist
  and biographer, reciting verses from "Prometheus bound," his knees quaking
  and lips quivering as he heard the thunder; or seen Ammonius, another
  grammarian who had written a celebrated work on "The Differences of
  Synonyms," rending his robe and presenting his bared breast as a target to
  the lightning, with a glance round at the company to challenge their
  admiration. His heroic display was, unfortunately, observed by few; for most
  of them, including Eunapius, a neo-platonic philosopher distinguished as a
  historian and an implacable foe of the Christians, had wrapped their heads in
  their robes and were awaiting the end in sullen resignation. Some had dropped
  on their knees and were praying with uplifted hands, or murmuring
  incantations; and a poet, who had been crowned for a poem entitled: "Man the
  Lord and Master of the Gods," had fainted with fear, and his laurel-wreath
  had fallen into a dish of oysters.</p>

  <p>Olympius had risen from his place as Symposiarch and was leaning against a
  door-post awaiting death with manly composure. Father Karnis, who had made
  rather too free with the wine-cup, but had been completely sobered by the
  sudden fury of the storm, had sprung up and hastened past the high-priest to
  seek his wife and son; he knew they could not be far off, and desired to
  perish with them.</p>

  <p>Porphyrius and his next neighbor, Apuleius, the great physician, were
  among those who had covered their faces. Porphyrius could look forward more
  calmly than many to the approaching crisis; for, as a cautious man and far-
  seeing merchant, he had made provision for every contingency. If, in spite of
  a Christian victory, the world should still roll on, and if the law which
  declared invalid the will of an apostate should be enforced against him, a
  princely fortune, out of the reach of Church or State, lay safe in the hands
  of a wealthy and trustworthy friend for his daughter's use; if, on the other
  hand, heaven and earth met in a common doom, he had by him an infallible
  remedy against a lingering and agonizing death.</p>

  <p>The whole party had sat during some long and anxious minutes, listening to
  the appalling thunder-claps, when Orpheus rushed into the banqueting-room,
  with the same frenzied and terror-stricken haste as before, among the
  revellers, crying: "It is the end-all is over! The world is falling asunder!
  Fire is come down from heaven! The earth is in flames already&mdash;I saw it
  with my own eyes! I have come down from the roof...</p>

  <p>"Father! Where is my father?"</p>

  <p>At this news the company started up in fresh alarm, Pappus, the
  mathematician, cried out: "The conflagration has begun! Flame and fire are
  falling from the skies!"</p>

  <p>"Lost-lost!" wailed Eunapius; while Porphyrius hastily felt in the folds
  of his purple garment, took out a small crystal phial and went, pale but
  calm, up to the high-priest. He laid his hand on the arm of the friend whom
  he had looked up to all his life with affectionate admiration, and said with
  an expression of tender regret:</p>

  <p>"Farewell. We have often disputed over the death of Cato&mdash;you
  disapproving and I approving it. Now I follow his example. Look&mdash;there
  is enough for us both."</p>

  <p>He hastily put the phial to his mouth, and part of the liquid had passed
  his lips before Olympius understood the situation and seized his arm. The
  effect of the deadly fluid was instantly manifest; but Porphyrius had hardly
  lost consciousness when Apuleius had rushed to his side. The physician had
  succumbed to the universal panic and resigned himself doggedly to Fate; but
  as soon as an appeal was made to his medical skill and he heard a cry for
  help, he had thrown off the wrapper from his head and hastened to the
  merchant's side to combat the effects of the poison, as clear-headed and
  decisive as in his best hours by the bed of sickness or in the
  lecture-room.</p>

  <p>When the very backbone of the soul seems to be broken, a sense of duty is
  the one and last thing that holds it together and keeps it upright; and
  nature has implanted in us such a strong and instinctive regard for
  life&mdash;which we are so apt to contemn&mdash;that even within a few paces
  of the grave we cherish and foster it as carefully as in its prime, when the
  end seems still remote.</p>

  <p>The merchant's desperate deed had been done under the very eyes of
  Orpheus, and the newer horror so completely overshadowed the older, that he
  hastened unbidden to help the physician lay the unconscious man on the
  nearest couch; but then he went off again in search of his parents. Olympius,
  however, who at the sight of his friend's weakness had suddenly comprehended
  how much depended, in these last hours, on his own resolute demeanor,
  detained the youth, and sternly desired him to give an exact and clear
  account of what had happened on the roof. The young musician obeyed; and his
  report was certainly far from reassuring.</p>

  <p>A ball of fire had fallen with a terrific noise on the cupola, mingling
  with flames that seemed to rise like streams of fire from the earth. Then,
  again the heavens had opened with a blinding flash and Orpheus had
  seen&mdash;with his own eyes seen&mdash;a gigantic monster&mdash;an uprooted
  mountain perhaps&mdash;which had slowly moved towards the back-wall of the
  Serapeum with an appalling clatter; and not rain, but rivers, rushing
  torrents of water, had poured down on the men on guard.</p>

  <p>"It is Poseidon," cried the lad, "bringing up the ocean against the
  temple, and I heard the neighing of his horses. It was not an illusion, I
  heard it with my own ears..."</p>

  <p>"The horses of Poseidon!" interrupted Olympius. "The horses of the
  Imperial cavalry were what you heard!"</p>

  <p>He ran to the window with the activity of a younger man and, lifting the
  curtain, looked out to the eastward. The storm had vanished as rapidly as it
  had come up and it was day. Over the rosy skirts of Eos hung a full and heavy
  robe of swelling grey and black clouds, edged with a fringe of sheeny gold.
  To the north a sullen flash now and then zigzagged across the dark sky, and
  the roll of the thunder was faint and distant; but the horses whose neighing
  had affrighted Orpheus were already near; they were standing close to the
  southern or back-wall of the temple, in which there was no gate or entrance
  of any kind. What object could the Imperial cavalry have in placing
  themselves by that strong and impenetrable spot?</p>

  <p>But there was no time for much consideration, for at this instant the
  gong, which was sounded to call the defenders of the Serapeum together, rang
  through the precincts.</p>

  <p>Olympius needed no spur or encouragement. He turned to his guests with the
  passion and fire of a fanatical leader, of the champion of a great but
  imperilled cause, and bid them be men and stand by him to resist the foe till
  death. His voice was husky with excitement as he spoke his brief but vehement
  call to arms, and the effect was immense, precisely because the speaker,
  carried away by the tide of feeling, had not tried to impress the learned and
  eloquent men whom he addressed by any tricks of elocution or choice of words.
  They, too, were fired by the spark of the old man's enthusiasm; they gathered
  round him, and followed him at once to the rooms where the weapons had been
  deposited for use.</p>

  <p>Breastplates girt on to their bodies, and swords wielded in their hands
  made soldiers of the sages at once, and inspired them with martial ardor.
  Little was spoken among these heroes of "the mighty word." They were bent on
  action. Olympius Had desired Apuleius to go into his private room adjoining
  the hypostyle with Porphyrius, on whose senseless and rigid state no
  treatment had as yet had any effect. Some of the temple-servants carried the
  merchant down a back staircase, while Olympius hastily and silently led his
  comrades in arms up the main steps into the great halls of the temple.</p>

  <p>Here the chivalrous host were doomed to surprise and disappointment
  greater than the most hopeless of them was prepared to meet. Olympius himself
  for a moment despaired; for his ecstatic adherents had during the night
  turned to poltroons and tipplers, and the sacred precincts of the sanctuary
  looked as if a battle had been fought and lost there. Broken and bruised
  furniture, smashed instruments, garments torn and wet, draggled wreaths, and
  faded flowers were strewn in every direction. The red wine lay in pools like
  blood on the scarred beauties of the inlaid pavement; here and there, at the
  foot of a column, lay an inert body&mdash;whether dead or merely senseless
  who could guess?&mdash;and the sickening reek of hundreds of dying lamps
  filled the air, for in the confusion they had been left to burn or die as
  they might.</p>

  <p>And how wretched was the aspect of the sobered, terror-stricken, worn-out
  men and women. An obscure consciousness of having insulted the god and
  incurred his wrath lurked in every soul. To many a one prompt death would
  have seemed most welcome, and one man&mdash;a promising pupil of Helladius,
  had actually taken the leap from existence into the non-existence which, as
  he believed, he should find beyond the grave; he had run his had violently
  against a pillar, and lay at the foot of it with a broken skull.</p>

  <p>With reeling brains, aching brows, and dejected hearts, the unhappy
  creatures had got so far as to curse the present; and those who dared to
  contemplate the future thought of it only as a bottomless abyss, towards
  which the flying hours were dragging them with unfelt but irresistible force.
  Time was passing&mdash;each could feel and see that; night was gone, it would
  soon be day; the storm had passed over, but instead of the inexorable powers
  of nature a new terror now hung over them: the no less inexorable power of
  Caesar. To the struggle of man against the gods there was but one possible
  end: Annihilation. In the conflict of man against man there might yet be, if
  not victory, at least escape. The veteran Memnon, with his one arm, had kept
  watch on the temple-roof during that night's orgy, planning measures for
  repulsing the enemy's attack, till the storm had burst on him and his
  adherents with the "artillery of heaven." Then the greater portion of the
  garrison had taken refuge in the lower galleries of the Serapeum, and the old
  general was left alone at his post, in the blinding and deafening tempest. He
  threw his remaining arm round a statue that graced the parapet of the roof to
  save himself from being swept or washed away; and he would still have shouted
  his orders, but that the hurricane drowned his voice, and none of his few
  remaining adherents could have heard him speak. He, too, had heard the
  champing of horses and had seen the moving mountain which Orpheus had
  described. It was in fact a Roman engine of war; and, faithful though he was
  to the cause he had undertaken, something like a feeling of joy stirred his
  warrior's soul, as he looked down on the fine and well-drilled men who
  followed the Imperial standards under which he had, ere now, shed his best
  blood. His old comrades in arms had not forgotten how to defy the tempest,
  and their captains had been well advised in preparing to attack first what
  seemed the securest side of the temple. The struggle, he foresaw, would be
  against tried soldiers, and it was with a deep curse and a smile of bitter
  scorn that he thought of the inexperienced novices under his command. It was
  only yesterday that he had tried to moderate Olympius' sanguine dreams, and
  had said to him: "It is not by enthusiasm but by tactics that we defeat a
  foe!"</p>

  <p>The skill and experience he had to contend with were in no respect
  inferior to his own; and he would know, only too soon, what the practical
  worth might be of the daring and enthusiastic youths whom he had undertaken
  to command, and of whom he still had secret hopes for the best.</p>

  <p>The one thing to do was to prevent the Christians from effecting the
  breach which they evidently intended to make in the back-wall, before the
  Libyan army of relief should arrive; and, at the same time, to defend the
  front of the temple from the roof. There was a use for every one who could
  heave a stone or flourish a sword; and when he thought over the number of his
  troops he believed he might succeed in holding the building for some
  considerable time. But he was counting on false premises, for he did not know
  how attractive the races had proved to his "enthusiastic youth" and how great
  a change had come over most of them.</p>

  <p>As soon as the wind had so far subsided that he could stand alone, he went
  to collect those that still remained, and to have the brass gong sounded
  which was to summon the combatants to their posts. Its metallic clang rang
  loud and far through the dim dawn; a deaf man might have heard it in the
  deepest recess of the sanctuary&mdash;and yet the minutes slipped by&mdash;a
  quarter of an hour&mdash;and no one had come at its call. The old captain's
  impatience turned to surprise, his surprise became wrath. The messengers he
  sent down did not return and the great moving shed of the Romans was brought
  nearer and nearer to the southern side of the temple, screening the miners
  from the rare missiles which the few men remaining with him cast clown by his
  orders.</p>

  <p>The enemy were evidently making a suitable foundation on which to place
  the storming engine&mdash;a beam with a ram's head of iron-to make a breach
  in the temple-wall. Every minute's delay on the part of the besieged was an
  advantage to the enemy. A hundred-two hundred more hands on the roof, and
  their tactics might yet be defeated.</p>

  <p>Tears of rage, of the bitter sense of impotence, started to the old
  soldier's eyes; and when, at length, one of his messengers came back and told
  him that the men and women alike seemed quite demented, and all and each
  refused to come up on the roof, he uttered a wrathful curse and rushed down-
  stairs himself.</p>

  <p>He stormed in on the trembling wretches; and when he beheld with his own
  eyes all that his volunteers had done dining that fateful night, he raved and
  thundered; asked them, rather confusedly perhaps, if they knew what it was to
  be expected to command and find no obedience; scolded the refractory, driving
  some on in front of him; and then, as he perceived that some of them were
  making off with the girls through the door leading to the secret passage, he
  placed himself on guard with his sword drawn, and threatened to cut down any
  who attempted to escape.</p>

  <p>In the midst of all this Olympius and his party had come into the ball and
  seeing the commander struggling, sword in hand, with the recalcitrant
  fugitives, where the noise was loudest, he and his guests hastened to the
  rescue and defended the door against the hundreds who were crowding to fly.
  The old man was grieved to turn the weapons they had seized in their sacred
  ardor, against the seceders from their own cause; but it had to be. While the
  loyal party&mdash;among them Karnis and Orpheus&mdash;guarded the passage to
  the underground rooms with shield and lance, Olympius took council of the
  veteran captain, and they rapidly decided to allow all the women to depart at
  once and to divide the men into two parties-one to be sent to fight on the
  roof, and the other to defend the wall where the Roman battering-ram was by
  this time almost ready to attack.</p>

  <p>The high-priest took his stand boldly between his adherents and the would-
  be runaways and appealed to them in loud and emphatic tones to do their duty.
  They listened to him silently and respectfully; but when he ended by stating
  that the women were commanded to withdraw, a terrific outcry was raised, some
  of the girls clung to their lovers, while others urged the men to fight their
  way out.</p>

  <p>Several, however, and among them the fair Glycera who a few hours since
  had smiled down triumphantly on her worshippers as Aphrodite, availed
  themselves at once of the permission to quit this scene of horrors, and made
  their way without delay to the subterranean passages. They had adorers in
  plenty in the city. But they did not get far; they were met by a
  temple-servant flying towards the great hall, who warned them to return
  thither at once: the Imperial soldiers had discovered the entrance to the
  aqueduct and posted sentries in the timber-yard. They turned and followed him
  with loud lamentations, and hardly had they got back into the temple when a
  new terror came upon them: the iron battering-ram came with a first heavy
  shock, thundering against the southern wall.</p>

  <p>The Imperial troops were in fact masters of the secret passage; and they
  had begun the attack on the Serapeum in earnest. It was serious&mdash;but all
  was not yet lost; and in this fateful hour Olympius and Memnon proved their
  mettle. The high-priest commanded that the great stone trap-doors should be
  dropped into their places, and that the bridges across the gulfs, in the
  underground rooms reserved for the initiated, should be destroyed; and this
  there was yet time to do, for the soldiers had not yet ventured into those
  mysterious corridors, where there could not fail to be traps and men in
  ambush. Memnon meanwhile had hurried to the spot where the battering-ram had
  by this time dealt a second blow, shouting as he went to every man who was
  not a coward to follow him.</p>

  <p>Karnis, Orpheus and the rest of the high-priest's guests obeyed his call
  and gathered round him; he commanded that everything portable should be
  brought out of the temple to be built into a barricade behind the point of
  attack, and that neither the most precious and beautiful statues, nor the
  brass and marble stelae and altar-slabs should be spared. Screened by this
  barricade, and armed with lances and bows&mdash;of which there were plenty at
  hand&mdash;he proposed, when the breach was made, to check the further
  advance of the foe.</p>

  <p>He was not ill-pleased that the only way of escape was cut off; and as
  soon as he had seen the statues dragged from their pedestals, the
  altar-stones removed from the sacred places they had filled for half a
  century, benches and jars piled together and a stone barricade thus fairly
  advanced towards completion, he drafted off a small force for the defences on
  the roof. There was no escape now; and many a one who, to the very last, had
  hoped to find himself free, mounted the stairs reluctantly, because he would
  there be more immediately in the face of the foe than when defending the
  breach.</p>

  <p>Olympius distributed weapons, and went from one to another, speaking words
  of encouragement; presently he found Gorgo who, with the bereaved widow, was
  still sitting at the foot of the statue of justice. He told her that her
  father was ill, and desired a servant to show her the way to his private
  room, that she might help the leech in attending on him. Berenice could not
  be induced to stir; she longed only for the end and was persuaded that it
  could not be far off. She listened eagerly to the blows of the
  battering-engine; each one sounded to her like a shock to the very structure
  of the universe. Another&mdash;and another&mdash;and at last the ancient
  masonry must give way and the grave that had already opened for her husband
  and her son would yawn to swallow her up with her sorrows. She shuddered and
  drew her hood over her face to screen it from the sun which now began to
  shine in. Its light was a grievance to her; she had hoped never to see
  another day.</p>

  <p>The women, and with them a few helpless weaklings, had withdrawn to the
  rotunda, and before long they were laughing as saucily as ever.</p>

  <p>From the roof blocks of stone and broken statues were hailing down on the
  besiegers, and in the halls below, the toiler who paused to wipe the sweat
  from his brow would brook no idleness in his comrade; the most recalcitrant
  were forced to bestir themselves, and the barricade inside the southern wall
  soon rose to a goodly height. No rampart was ever built of nobler materials;
  each stone was a work of art and had been reverenced for centuries as
  something sacred, or bore in an elegant inscription the memorial of noble
  deeds. This wall was to protect the highest of the gods, and among the
  detachment told off to defend it, were Karnis, his son, and his wife.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Gorgo sat by the bed of her apparently lifeless father,
  gazing fondly at the worn and wax-like features, and listening to his
  breathing, now soft and easy and again painful and convulsive, as it
  fluttered through his nostrils. She held his cold damp hand tightly clasped,
  or stroked it gently, or now and then, when his closed eyelids quivered,
  raised it tenderly to her lips.</p>

  <p>The room in which they were lay on one side of the hypostyle and behind
  the right-hand&mdash;or western&mdash;colonnade; more forward, therefore,
  than the veiled statue and to its left hand. The noise of the toilers at the
  barricade and the crash of the blows of the battering-ram came up from just
  below, and at each thud of the engine the senseless man started convulsively
  and a look of intense pain crossed his face. But, though it was indeed
  grievous to Gorgo to see her father suffering, though she told herself again
  and again that, ere long, the sanctuary must fall into the hands of the
  Christians, she felt safe, thankful and sheltered up here, in her old
  friend's half-lighted and barely-furnished room, shut off, at any rate, from
  the frenzied wretches of whom she thought only with loathing and fear.</p>

  <p>She was wearied out with her night of unrest, but the agitation and
  excitement she had gone through were still vividly present to her mind, and
  even on the comfortable couch in her own snug room at home her perturbed
  spirit would have prevented her sleeping. Her brain was still in a ferment,
  and here, in comparative peace, she had time to think over all she had gone
  through during the last few hours, and the catastrophes that had befallen her
  grandmother and her father. She had exchanged but few words with the
  physician, who was still unceasingly busy in trying to restore his patient to
  consciousness, and who had assured her that he had every hope of her father's
  recovery.</p>

  <p>But at length the girl looked up with an eager gaze and said, sadly
  enough: "You said something about an antidote to poison, Apuleius? Then my
  father tried to escape the final destruction by attempting to kill
  himself.&mdash;Is it so?"</p>

  <p>The leech looked at her keenly, and after confirming her suspicion and
  explaining to her exactly how the fateful deed had been accomplished, he went
  on:</p>

  <p>"The storm had completely unnerved him&mdash;it unmanned us all&mdash;and
  yet that was only the prelude to the tremendous doom which is hanging over
  the universe. It is at hand; we can hear its approach; the stones are
  yielding! the Christian's engines are opening the way for it to enter!"</p>

  <p>Apuleius spoke in a tone of sinister foreboding, and the falling stones
  dislodged by the battering-ram thundered a solemn accompaniment to his
  prophecy. Gorgo, turned pale; but it was not the physician's ominous speech
  that alarmed her, but the quaking of the walls of the room. Still, the
  Serapeum was built for eternity; the ram might bring down a wall, but it
  could not destroy or even shake the building itself.</p>

  <p>Outside, the hubbub of fighting men grew louder and louder every minute,
  and Apuleius, increasingly anxious, went to the door to listen. Gorgo could
  see that his hands trembled! he&mdash;a man&mdash;was frightened, while she
  felt no anxiety but for her suffering father! Through that breach Constantine
  would enter&mdash;and where he commanded she was safe. As to the destruction
  of the universe&mdash;she no longer believed in it. When the physician turned
  round and saw her calmly and quietly wiping the cold drops from the sick
  man's brow, he said gloomily: "Of what use is it to shut our eyes like the
  ostrich. They are fighting down there for life or death&mdash;we had better
  prepare for the end. If they venture&mdash;and they will&mdash;to lay a
  sacrilegious hand on the god, besiegers and besieged alike&mdash;the whole
  world together, must perish."</p>

  <p>But Gorgo shook her head. "No, no," she cried, with zealous confidence.
  "No, Apuleius, Serapis is not what you believe him to be; for, if he were,
  would he suffer his enemies to overthrow his temple and his image? Why does
  he not, at this supreme moment, inspire his worshippers with courage? I have
  seen the men&mdash;mere boys&mdash;and the women who have assembled here to
  fight for him. They are nothing but drivellers and triflers. If the master is
  like his men it serves him right if he is overthrown; to weep for him would
  be waste of woe!"</p>

  <p>"And can the daughter of Porphyrius say this?" exclaimed the leech.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Apuleius, yes. After what I have seen, and heard, and endured this
  night, I cannot speak otherwise. It was shameful, horrible, sickening; I
  could rage at the mere thought of being supposed to be one of that debased
  crew. It is disgrace and ignominy even to be named in the same breath! A god
  who is served as this god has been is no god of mine! And you&mdash;you are
  learned&mdash;a sage and a philosopher&mdash;how can you believe that the God
  of the Christians when he has conquered and crippled yours, will ever permit
  Serapis to destroy His world and the men He created?"</p>

  <p>Apuleius drew himself up. "Are you then a Christian?" he asked swiftly and
  sternly.</p>

  <p>But Gorgo could not reply; she colored deeply and Apuleius vehemently
  repeated his question: "Then you really are a Christian?"</p>

  <p>She looked frankly in his face: "No," she said, "I am not; but I wish I
  were."</p>

  <p>The physician turned away with a shrug; but Gorgo drew a breath of relief,
  feeling that her avowal had lifted a heavy burthen from her soul. She hardly
  knew how the bold and momentous confession had got itself spoken, but she
  felt that it was the only veracious answer to the physician's question.</p>

  <p>They spoke no more; she was better pleased to remain silent, for her own
  utterance had opened out to her a new land of promise&mdash;of feeling and of
  thought.</p>

  <p>Her lover henceforth was no longer her enemy; and as the tumult of the
  struggle by the breach fell on her ear, she could think with joy of his
  victorious arms. She felt that this was the purer, the nobler, the better
  cause; and she rejoiced in the love of which he had spoken as the support and
  the stay of their future life together&mdash;as sheltering them like a tower
  of strength and a mighty refuge. Compared with that love all that she had
  hitherto held dear or indispensable as gracing life, now seemed vain and
  worthless; and as she looked at her father's still face, and remembered how
  he had lived and what he had suffered, she applied those words of Paul which
  Constantine had spoken at their meeting after his return, to him, too; and
  her heart overflowed with affection towards her hapless parent. She knew full
  well the meaning of the deep lines that marked his lips and brow; for
  Porphyrius had never made any secret of his distress and vexation whenever he
  found himself compelled to confess a creed in which he did not honestly
  believe. This great falsehood and constant duplicity, this divided allegiance
  to two masters, had poisoned the existence of a man by nature truthful; and
  Gorgo knew for whose sake and for what reasons he had subjected himself to
  this moral martyrdom. It was a lesson to her to see him lying there, and his
  look of anguish warned her to become, heart and soul, a Christian as she felt
  prompted. She would confess Christ for love's sake-aye, for love's sake; for
  in this hour the thing she saw most clearly in the faith which she purposed
  to adopt, and of which Constantine had so often spoken to her with
  affectionate enthusiasm, was Everlasting Love.</p>

  <p>Never in her life had she felt so much at peace, so open to all that was
  good and beautiful; and yet, outside, the strife grew louder and more
  furious; the Imperial tuba sounded above the battle-cry of the heathen, and
  the uproar of the struggle came nearer and nearer.</p>

  <p>The battering-ram had made a large breach in the southern wall, and,
  protected by their shed, the heavy-armed infantry of the twenty-second legion
  had forced their way up; but many a veteran had paid for his rashness with
  his life, for the storming party had been met by a perfect shower of arrows
  and javelins. Still, the great shield had turned many a spear, and many an
  arrow had glanced harmless from the brazen armor and helmets; the men that
  had escaped pressed onwards, while fresh ranks of soldiers made their way in,
  over the bodies of the fallen. The well-drilled foe came creeping up to the
  barricade on their knees, and protected by bronze bucklers, while others, in
  the rear, flung lances and arrows over their heads at the besieged. A few of
  the heathen fell, and the sight of their blood had a wonderful effect on
  their comrades. Rage surged up in the breasts of the most timid, and fear
  vanished before the passion for revenge; cowardice turned to martial ardor,
  and philosophers and artists thirsted for blood. The red glare of strife
  danced before the eyes of the veriest book-worm; fired by the terrible
  impulse to kill, to subdue, to destroy the foe, they fought desperately and
  blindly, staking their lives on the issue.</p>

  <p>Karnis, that zealous votary of the Muses, stood with Orpheus, on the very
  top of the barricade throwing lance after lance, while he sang at the top of
  his voice snatches of the verses of Tyrtaeus, in the teeth, as it were, of
  the foe who were crowding through the breach; the sweat streamed from his
  bald head and his eye flashed fire. By his side stood his son, sending swift
  arrows from an enormous bow. The heavy curls of his hair had come unbound and
  fell over his flushed face. When he hit one of the Imperial soldiers his
  father applauded him eagerly; then, collecting all his strength, flung
  another lance, chanting a hexameter or a verse of an ode. Herse crouched half
  hidden behind a sacrificial stone which lay at the top of the
  hastily-constructed rampart, and handed weapons to the combatants as they
  needed them. Her dress was torn and blood-stained, her grey hair had come
  loose from the ribbands and crescent that should have confined it; the worthy
  matron had become a Megaera and shrieked to the men: "Kill the dogs! Stand
  steady! Spare never a Christian!"</p>

  <p>But the little garrison needed no incitement; the fevered zeal which
  possessed them wholly, seconded their thirst for blood and doubled their
  strength.</p>

  <p>An arrow, shot by Orpheus, had just glanced over the breastplate and into
  the throat of a centurion who had already set foot on the lowest step, when
  Karnis suddenly dropped the spear he was preparing to fling and fell without
  a cry. A Roman lance had hit him, and he lay transfixed by the side of a
  living purple fount, like a rock in the surf from which a sapling has sprung.
  Orpheus saw his father's life-blood flowing and fell on his knees by his
  side; but the old man pointed to the bow that his son had cast aside and
  murmured eagerly: "Leave me&mdash;let me be. What does it matter about me?
  Fight&mdash;for the gods&mdash;I say. For the gods! Go on, aim truly!"</p>

  <p>But the lad would not leave the dying man, and seeing how deeply the spear
  had struck to the old man's heart he groaned aloud, throwing up his arms in
  despair. Then an arrow hit his shoulder, another pierced his neck, and he,
  too, fell gasping for breath. Karnis saw him drop, and painfully raised
  himself a little to help him; but it was too much for him; he could only
  clench his fist in helpless fury and chant, half-singing, half-speaking, as
  loud he was able, Electra's curse:</p>

  <p>"This my last prayer, ye gods, do not disdain! For them turn day to night
  and joy to pain!"</p>

  <p>But the heavy infantry, who by this time were crowding through the breach,
  neither heard nor heeded his curse. He lost consciousness and did not recover
  it till Herse, after lifting up her son and propping him against a plinth,
  pressed a cloth against the stump of the lance still remaining in the wound
  to staunch the swiftly flowing blood, and sprinkled his brow with wine. He
  felt her warm tears on his face, and as he looked up into her kind, faithful
  eyes, brimming over with tears of sympathy and regret, his heart melted to
  tenderness. All the happiest hours of the life they had spent together
  crowded on his memory; he answered her glance with a loving and grateful gaze
  and painfully held out his hand. Herse pressed it to her lips, weeping
  bitterly; but he smiled up at her, nodding his head and repeating again and
  again the line from Lucian: "Be comforted: you, too, must soon follow."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes&mdash;I shall follow soon," she repeated with sobs. "Without
  you, without either of you, without the gods&mdash;what would become of me
  here."</p>

  <p>And she turned to her son who, fully conscious, had followed every word
  and every gesture of his parents and tried himself to say something. But the
  arrow in his neck choked his breath, and it was such agony to speak that he
  could only say hoarsely: "Father mother!" But these poor words were full of
  deep love and gratitude, and Karnis and Herse understood all he longed to
  express.</p>

  <p>Tears choked the poor woman's utterance so that neither of the three could
  say another word, but they were at any rate close together, and could look
  lovingly in each other's eyes. Thus passed some few minutes of peace for
  them, in spite of the blare of trumpets, and shrieks and butchery; but
  Herse's kerchief was dyed and soaked with her husband's blood, and the old
  man's eyes were glazed and staring as they wandered feebly on the scene, as
  though to get a last general picture of the world in which they had always
  sought to see only what was fair. Suddenly they remained fixed on the face of
  a statue of Apollo, which had been flung on to the barricade; and the longer
  they dwelt on the beautiful countenance of the god the more they sparkled
  with a clear transfigured gleam. Once more, with a final effort, he raised
  his heavy hand and pointed to the sun-crowned head of the immortal youth
  while he softly murmured:</p>

  <p>"He&mdash;he&mdash;all that was fair in existence&mdash;Orpheus,
  Herse&mdash;we owe it all to him. He dies with us.&mdash;They&mdash;the
  enemy&mdash;in conquering us conquer thee! They dream of a Paradise beyond
  death; but where thou reignest, O Phoebus, there is bliss even on earth! They
  boast that they love death and hate life; and when they are the victors they
  will destroy lute and pipe, nay, if they could, would exterminate beauty and
  extinguish the sun. This beautiful happy world they would have dark, gloomy,
  melancholy, hideous; thy kingdom, great Phoebus, is sunny, joyful and bright
  ...!" Here his strength failed him; but presently he rallied once more and
  went on, with eager eyes: "We crave for light, for music, lutes and
  pipes&mdash;for perfumed flowers on careless brows&mdash;we&mdash;hold me up
  Herse&mdash;and thou, heal me, O Phoebus Apollo!&mdash;Hail, all hail! I
  thank thee&mdash;thou hast accepted much from me and hast given me all! Come,
  thou joy of my soul! Come in thy glorious chariot, attended by Muses and
  Hours! See, Orpheus, Herse&mdash;do you see Him coming?"</p>

  <p>He pointed with a confident gesture to the distance; and his anxious eyes
  followed the indication of his hand; he raised himself a little by a last
  supreme effort; but instantly fell back; his head sank on the bosom of his
  faithful partner and a stream of blood flowed from his quivering lips. The
  votary of the Muses was dead; and a few minutes after Orpheus, too, fell
  senseless.</p>

  <p>War-cries and trumpet-calls rang and echoed through the Serapeum. The
  battle was now a hand-to-hand fight; the besiegers had surmounted the
  barricade and stood face to face with the heathen. Herse saw them coming; she
  snatched the dart from her husband's wound, and fired by hatred and a wild
  thirst for vengeance, she rushed upon the besiegers with frantic and helpless
  fury, cursing them loudly. She met the death she craved; a javelin struck her
  and she fell close to her husband and son. Her death struggle was a short
  one; she had only time and strength to extend a hand to lay on each before
  she herself was a corpse.</p>

  <p>The battle raged round the heap of dead; the Imperial troops drove the
  garrison backwards into the temple-halls, and the plan of attack which had
  been agreed upon at a council of war held in the palace of the Comes, was
  carried out, point by point, with cool courage and irresistible force. A few
  maniples pursued the fugitives into the main entrance hall, helped them to
  force the gates open, and then drove them down the slope and steps, over the
  stones that had been heaped up for protection, and into the very arms of the
  division placed in front of the temple. These at once surrounded them and
  took them prisoners, as the hunter traps the game that rushes down upon him
  when driven by the dogs and beaters. Foremost to fly were the women from the
  rotunda, who were welcomed with acclamations by the soldiers.</p>

  <p>But those who now tried to defend themselves found no quarter. Berenice
  had picked up a sword that was lying on the ground and had opened a vein with
  the point of it; her body, bathed in blood, was found at the foot of the
  statue of justice.</p>

  <p>No sooner had the Christians mastered the barricade than a few maniples
  had been sent up to the roof, and the defenders had been compelled to
  surrender or to throw themselves from the parapet. Old Memnon, who had been
  fighting against his Imperial master and could hope for no mercy, sprang at
  once into the gulf below, and others followed his example; for the end of all
  things was now close at hand, and to the nobler souls to die voluntarily in
  battle for great Serapis seemed finer and worthier than to languish in the
  enemy's chains.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The terrific storm of the preceding night had thrown the
  whole city into dismay. Everyone knew the danger that threatened Serapis, and
  what must ensue if he were overthrown; and everyone had thought that the end
  of the world had indeed come. But the tempest died away; the sun's bright
  glow dispersed the clouds and mist; sea and sky smiled radiantly blue, and
  the trees and herbage glistened in revived freshness.</p>

  <p>Not yet had the Romans dared to lay hands on the chief of the gods, the
  patron and protector of the city. Serapis had perhaps sent the lightning,
  thunder and rain as a message to warn his foes. If only they might abstain
  from the last, worst crime of desecrating his image!</p>

  <p>Nor was this the hope of the heathen only; on the contrary: Jews and
  Christians no less dreaded the fall of the god and of his temple. He was the
  pride, the monumental glory of the city of Alexander; the centre of
  foundations and schools which benefited thousands. The learning which was the
  boast of Alexandria dwelt under his protection; to the Serapeum was attached
  a medical Faculty which enjoyed the reputation of being the first in the
  world; from its observatory the course of the year was forecast and the
  calendar was promulgated. An hour's slumber in its halls brought prophetic
  dreams, and the future must remain undivined if Serapis were to fall, for the
  god revealed it to his priests, not merely by the courses and positions of
  the stars, but by many other signs; and it was a delight and a privilege to
  look forward from the certain, tangible present to the mysteries of the
  morrow.</p>

  <p>Even Christian seers answered the questionings of their followers in a way
  which portended the worst, and it was a grief to many of the baptized to
  think of their native city without Serapis and the Serapeum, just as we
  cannot bear to cut down a tree planted by the hand of an ancestor, even
  though it may darken our home. The temple ought to be closed, bloody
  sacrifices to the god should be prohibited&mdash;but his image&mdash;the
  noblest work of Bryaxis&mdash;to mutilate, or even to touch that would be a
  rash, a fateful deed, treason to the city and an outrage on the world.</p>

  <p>Thus thought the citizens; thus, too, thought the soldiers, who were
  required by military discipline to draw the sword against the god in whom
  many of them believed.</p>

  <p>As the news spread that the troops were to attack the Serapeum early next
  morning, thousands of spectators collected, and filled the temple itself in
  breathless anxiety to watch the issue of the struggle.</p>

  <p>The sky was as clear and blue as on any other fine day; but over the sea
  to the north lay a light stratum of clouds&mdash;the harbingers perhaps of
  the appalling blackness which the god would presently bring up against his
  enemies.</p>

  <p>The men who had defended the Serapeum were led away; it had been
  determined in a council of war that they should be treated with clemency, and
  Cynegius had proclaimed free and full pardon to every prisoner who would
  swear never, for the future, to sacrifice to the god or worship in his
  temple.</p>

  <p>Not one of the hundreds who had fallen into the hands of the Romans had
  refused to take the oath; they dispersed at once, though with suppressed
  fury, many of them joining the crowd who stood waiting and watching for the
  next step to be taken by the Romans&mdash;for the final crash of the
  universe, perhaps.</p>

  <p>The doors of the temple were thrown wide open; the temple-servants and
  hundreds of soldiers were busied in clearing the steps and approaches of the
  stones and fragments of statuary with which the heathen had encumbered them.
  As soon as this task was finished the dead and wounded were removed; among
  those who still breathed was Orpheus, the son of Karnis. Those who had been
  so happy as to escape in the defence of the sanctuary and had mingled with
  the crowd were besieged with questions, and all agreed that the statue of the
  god was as yet inviolate.</p>

  <p>The citizens were relieved, but ere long were startled by a new alarm; an
  Ala of heavy cavalry came upon the scene, opening a way for an immensely long
  procession whose chanted psalms rang out from afar, loud above the cries and
  murmurs of the mob, the clatter of harness, and stamping of horses. It was
  clear now where the monks had been. They were not usually absent when there
  was a skirmish with the heathen; but, till this moment, they had been seen
  only in twos or threes about the Serapeum. Now they came forward shouting a
  psalm of triumph, their eyes glaring, wilder and more ruthless than ever.</p>

  <p>The Bishop marched at their head, in his vestments, under a magnificent
  canopy; his lofty stature was drawn to its full height and his lips were
  firmly closed.</p>

  <p>He looked like a stern judge about to mount the tribunal to pronounce
  sentence with inexorable severity on some execrable crime.</p>

  <p>The crowd quailed.</p>

  <p>The Bishop and the monks in the Serapeum, meant the overthrow of the
  statue of the sovereign god&mdash;death and destruction. The boldest turned
  pale; many who had left wife and children at home stole away to await the end
  of the world with those they loved; others remained to watch the menaced
  sanctuary, cursing or praying; but the greater number, men and women alike,
  crowded into the temple, risking their lives to be present at the stupendous
  events about to be enacted there and which promised to be a drama of
  unequalled interest.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the ascent the Comes rode forth to meet the Bishop,
  leaped from his saddle and greeted him with reverence. The Imperial legate
  had not made his appearance; he had preferred to remain for the present at
  the prefect's house, intending to preside, later in the day, at the races as
  the Emperor's representative, side by side with the Prefect
  Evagrius&mdash;who also kept aloof during the attack on the Serapeum. After a
  brief colloquy, Romanus signed to Constantine, the captain of the cavalry;
  the troop dismounted, and, led by their officer, marched up the slope that
  led to the great gate of the Serapeum. They were followed by the Comes with
  his staff; next to him pale and somewhat tremulous came some of the city
  officials and a few Christian members of the senate; and then the
  Bishop&mdash;who had preferred to come last&mdash;with all the Christian
  priesthood and a crowd of chanting monks. The train was closed by a division
  of heavy-armed infantry; and after them the populace rushed in, unchecked by
  the soldiers who stood outside the temple.</p>

  <p>The great halls of the Serapeum had been put in order as well as possible
  in so short a time. Of all those who, the day before, had crowded in to
  defend the god and his house, none were left but Porphyrius and those who
  were nursing him. After a long and agonizing period of silence heavy fists
  came thundering at the door. Gorgo started up to unbolt it, but Apuleius held
  her back; so it was forced off its hinges and thing into the temple-aisle on
  which the room opened. At the same instant a party of soldiers entered the
  room and glanced round it enquiringly.</p>

  <p>The physician turned as pale as death, and sank incapable of speech on a
  seat by his patient's couch; but Gorgo turned with calm dignity to the
  centurion who led the intruders, and explained to him who she was, and that
  she was here under the protection of the leech to tend her suffering father.
  She concluded by asking to speak with Constantine the prefect of cavalry, or
  with the Comes Romanus, to whom she and her father were well known.</p>

  <p>There was nothing unusual in a sick man being brought into the Serapeum
  for treatment, and the calm, undoubting superiority of Gorgo's tone as well
  as the high rank of the men whose protection she appealed to, commanded the
  centurion's respectful consideration; however, his orders were to send every
  one out of the temple who was not a Roman soldier, so he begged her to wait a
  few minutes, and soon returned with the legate Volcatius, the captain of his
  legion. This knightly patrician well knew&mdash;as did every lover of
  horses&mdash;the owner of the finest stable in Alexandria, and was quite
  willing to allow Gorgo and Apuleius to remain with their patient; at the same
  time he warned them that a great catastrophe was imminent. Gorgo, however,
  persisted in her wish to be by her father's side, so he left her a guard to
  protect them.</p>

  <p>The soldiers were too busy to linger; instead of replacing the door they
  had torn down, they pushed it out of their way; and Gorgo, seeing that her
  father remained in precisely the same condition, drew back the curtain which
  was all that now divided them from the hypostyle, and looked out over the
  heads of a double row of soldiers. They were posted close round the lower
  step of the platform that raised the hypostyle above the nave and the
  colonnades on each side of it.</p>

  <p>In the distance Gorgo could see a vast body of men slowly approaching in
  detachments, and with long pauses at intervals. They stopped for some time in
  the outer hall, and before they entered the basilica twenty Christian priests
  came in with strange gestures and a still stranger chant; these were
  exorcists, come to bann the evil spirits and daemons that must surely haunt
  this high place of idolatry and abominations. They carried crosses which they
  flourished like weapons against an unseen foe, and touched the columns with
  them, the pavement and the few remaining statues; they fell on their knees,
  making the sign of the cross with the left hand; and, finally, they ranged
  themselves like soldiers in three ranks in front of the niche containing the
  statue, pointed their crosses at the god, and recited in loud, angry, and
  commanding tones the potent anathemas and mysterious formulas which they
  thought calculated to expel the most reprobate and obdurate of all the
  heathen devils. A host of acolytes, following at their heels, swung their
  censers about the plague-spot&mdash;the shrine of the king of idols; while
  the exorcists dipped wands into a cauldron carried by their attendants, and
  sprinkled the mystical figures on the hanging and on the mosaic pavement.</p>

  <p>All this occupied several minutes. Then&mdash;and Gorgo's heart beat
  high&mdash;then Constantine came in, armed and equipped, and behind him an
  Ala of picked men, the elite of his troop; bearded men with tanned and
  scarred faces. Instead of swords they carried axes, and they were followed by
  sappers bearing tall ladders which, by Constantine's orders, they leaned up
  against the niche. The infantry ranged under the colonnades at the sides were
  evidently startled at the sight of these ladders, and Gorgo could perceive by
  the trembling of the curtain near which she and Apuleius were standing, how
  deeply the physician was agitated. It was as though the axe had been
  displayed with which a king was about to be decapitated.</p>

  <p>Now the Bishop came in with the municipal dignitaries; priests and monks,
  chanting as they walked, filled the broad hall, incessantly making the sign
  of the cross; and the crowd that poured into the hypostyle pressed as far
  forward as they were allowed by the chain which the soldiers held
  outstretched between them and their superiors.</p>

  <p>The populace-heathen and Christian of every sect and degree-filled the
  aisles, too; but the chain also kept them off the upper end, on to which the
  room opened in which Porphyrius lay; so that Gorgo's view of the curtain and
  apse remained unhindered.</p>

  <p>The psalm rang loudly through the temple-courts above the murmur and
  grumble of the angry, terrified and expectant mob. They were prepared for the
  worst; each one knew the crime which was to be perpetrated, and yet few,
  perhaps, really believed that any one would dare to commit it. Whichever way
  she looked Gorgo saw only white faces, stamped with passion, dismay, and
  dread. The very priests and soldiers themselves had turned pale, and stood
  with bloodless cheeks and set teeth, staring at the ground; some, to disguise
  their alarm, cast wrathful and defiant glances at the rebellious mob, who
  tried to drown the psalm-singing in loud menaces and curses, and the echoes
  of the great building doubled their thousand voices.</p>

  <p>A strange unrest seethed in this dense mass of humanity. The heathen were
  trembling with rage, clutching their amulets and charms, or shaking angry
  fists; the Christians thrilled with anxiety and pious zeal, and used their
  hands to lift the cross or to ward off the evil one with outstretched
  fingers. Every face and every gesture, the muttered curses and pious
  hymns&mdash;all showed that some terrible and fateful event was impending
  over all. Gorgo herself felt as though she were standing on the brink of a
  crater, while air and earth heaved around her; she felt and saw the eruption
  of the volcano threatening, every instant, to burst at her feet, and to choke
  and ruin every living thing.</p>

  <p>The uproar among the heathen grew louder and louder; fragments of stone
  and wood came flying towards the spot where the Bishop and officials were
  standing; but, suddenly, the tumult ceased, and, as if by a miracle, there
  was silence&mdash;perfect silence&mdash;in the temple. It was as though at a
  sign from the Omnipotent Ruler the storm-lashed ocean had turned to the calm
  of a land-locked lake. At a nod from the Bishop some acolytes had stepped up
  to the niche where the statue of the god was shrouded and the curtain, which
  till now had hidden it, slowly began to fall.</p>

  <p>There sat Serapis, looking down in majestic indifference, as cold and
  unapproachable as if his sublime dignity was far removed above the petty
  doings of the crawling humanity at his feet; and the effect was as impressive
  now as it had been the evening before. How beautiful&mdash;how marvellously
  grand and lofty was this work of human hands! Even the Christians could not
  repress a low, long-drawn murmur of surprise, admiration, and astonishment.
  The heathen were at first silent, overcome by pious awe and ecstasy; but then
  they broke out in a loud and triumphant shout, and their cries of "Hail to
  Serapis!" "Serapis, reign forever!" rang from pillar to pillar and echoed
  from the stony vault of the apse and ceiling.</p>

  <p>Gorgo crossed her hands over her bosom as she saw the god revealed in his
  glorious beauty. Spotlessly pure, complete and perfect, the noble statue
  stood before her; an idol indeed, and perishable&mdash;but still divine as a
  matchless work, wrought by the loving hands of a votary of the god, inspired
  by the immortals. She gazed spell-bound on the form which, though human,
  transcended humanity as eternity transcends time, as the light of the sun
  transcended the blazing beacon on Pharos; and she said to herself that it was
  impossible that an irreverent hand should be laid on this supremely lovely
  statue, crowned with the might of undying beauty.</p>

  <p>She saw that even the Bishop drew back a step when the curtain had fallen,
  and his lips parted involuntarily to utter a cry of admiration like the
  others; but she saw, too, that he closed them again and pressed them more
  firmly together; that his eye sparkled with a fiercer light as the shout of
  the heathen rose to heaven, that the knotted veins on his high forehead
  swelled with rage as he heard the cry of "Serapis, Hail, all hail!" Then she
  noted the Comes, as he whispered soothing words in the prelate's ear, praying
  him perhaps to spare the statue&mdash;not as an idol, but as a work of art;
  as he turned from Theophilus with a shrug; and then&mdash;her heart stood
  still, and she had to cling to the curtain&mdash;he pointed to the statue,
  with a nod of intelligence to Constantine. The young officer bowed with
  military formality and gave a word of command to his men, which was drowned
  by the wild cries of the heathen as soon as they apprehended with dismay what
  its import was.</p>

  <p>The veterans were stirred. A subaltern officer, putting the standard he
  bore into the hands of the man next to him and taking his axe from him
  instead, rushed towards the statue, gazed up at it&mdash;and then, letting
  the axe sink, withdrew slowly to rejoin the others who still stood
  hesitating, looking at each other with doubting and defiant eyes.</p>

  <p>Once more Constantine shouted his order, louder and more positively than
  before; but the men did not move. The subaltern flung his axe on the ground
  and the rest followed his example, pointing eagerly to the god, and
  vehemently adjuring their prefect&mdash;refusing apparently to obey his
  commands&mdash;for he went to the recalcitrant standard-bearer, a grey-haired
  veteran, and laying his hand on the man's shoulder shook him angrily,
  evidently threatening him and his comrades.</p>

  <p>In these brave souls a struggle was going on, between their sense of
  discipline and devotion to their fine young leader, and their awe of the god;
  it was visible in their puzzled faces, in their hands raised in supplication.
  Constantine, however, relentlessly repeated his order; and, when they still
  refused to obey, he turned his back on their ranks with a gesture of bitter
  contempt, and shouted his commands to the infantry posted by the colonnade
  behind which Gorgo was watching all these proceedings.</p>

  <p>But these also were refractory. The heathen were triumphant, and
  encouraged the soldiers with loud cries to persist.</p>

  <p>Constantine turned once more to his own men, and finding them obstinate in
  their disobedience, he went forward himself to where the ladders were
  standing, moved one of them from the wall and leaned it up against the body
  of the statue, seized the axe that lay nearest, and mounted from rung to
  rung. The murmurs of the heathen were suddenly silenced; the multitude were
  so still that the least sound of one plate of armor against another was
  audible, that each man could hear his neighbor breathe, and that Gorgo
  fancied she could hear her own heart throb.</p>

  <p>The man and the god stood face to face, and the man who was about to lay
  hands on the god was her lover. She watched his movements with breathless
  interest; she longed to call out to him, to follow him as he mounted the
  ladder, to fall on his neck and keep him from committing such
  sacrilege&mdash;not out of fear of the ruin he might bring upon the world,
  but only because she felt that the first blow he should deal to this
  beautiful and unique work of art might wreck her love for him, as his axe
  would wreck the ivory. She was not afraid for him; he seemed to her
  inviolable and invulnerable; but her whole soul shuddered at the deed which
  he was steeling himself to perpetrate. She remembered their happy childhood
  together, his own artistic attempts, the admiration with which he had gazed
  at the great works of the ancient sculptors&mdash;and it seemed impossible
  that he, of all men he, should lay hands on that masterpiece, that he, of all
  men, should be the one to insult, mutilate and ruin it. It was
  not&mdash;could not be true!</p>

  <p>But there he was, at the top of the ladder; he passed the axe from his
  left hand to his right, and leaning back a little, looked at the head of the
  god from one side. She could see his face plainly, and note every movement
  and look; she watched him keenly, and saw the loving and compassionate
  expression with which he fixed his gaze on the noble features of Serapis, saw
  him clutch his left hand to his heart as if in pain. The crowd below might
  fancy that he lacked courage, that he was absorbed in prayer, or that his
  soul shrank from dealing the fateful blow to the great divinity; but she
  could see that he was bidding a silent farewell, as it were, to the sublime
  work of an inspired artist, which it pained and shocked him to destroy. And
  this comforted her; it gave her views of the situation a new direction, and
  suggested the question whether he, a soldier and a Christian, when commanded
  by his superior to do this deed ought to shrink or hesitate, if he were
  indeed, heart and soul, what, after all, he was. Her eyes clung to him, as a
  frightened child clings to its mother's neck; and the expectant thousands, in
  an agony of suspense, like her, saw nothing but him.</p>

  <p>Stillness more profound never reigned in the heart of the desert than now
  in this vast and densely-crowded hall. Of all man's five senses only one was
  active: that of sight; and that was concentrated on a single object a man's
  hand holding an axe. The hearts of thousands stood still, their breath was
  suspended, there was a singing in their ears, a dazzling light in their
  eyes&mdash;eyes that longed to see, that must see&mdash;and that could not;
  thousands stood there like condemned criminals, whose heads are on the block,
  who hear the executioner behind them, and who still, on the very threshold of
  death, hope for respite and release.</p>

  <p>Gorgo found no answer to her own questionings; but she, too, wanted to
  see&mdash;must see. And she saw Constantine close his eyes, as though he
  dared not contemplate the deed that Fate had condemned him to do; she saw him
  lay his left hand on the god's sacred beard, saw him raise his right for the
  fatal blow&mdash;saw, heard, felt the axe crash again and again on the cheek
  of Serapis&mdash;saw the polished ivory fall in chips and shavings, large and
  small, on the stone floor, and leap up with an elastic rebound or shiver into
  splinters. She covered her face with her hands and hid her head in the
  curtain, weeping aloud. She could only moan and sob, and feel nothing, think
  nothing but that a momentous and sinister act had been perpetrated. An
  appalling uproar like the noise of thunder and the beating of surf rose up on
  every side, but she heeded it not; and when at length the physician called
  her by her name, when she turned from the curtain and once more looked out,
  instead of the sublime image of the god she saw in the niche a shapeless log
  of wood, a hideous mass against which several ladders were propped, while the
  ground was heaped and strewed with scraps of ivory, fragments of gold-plate,
  and chips of marble. Constantine had disappeared; the ladders and the plinth
  of the statue were covered with a swarm of soldiers and monks who were
  finishing the work of destruction. As soon as the young officer had struck
  the first blow, and the god had submitted in abject impotence, they had
  rushed upon him and saved their captain the trouble of ending the task he had
  begun.</p>

  <p>The great idol was desecrated. Serapis was no more&mdash;the heaven of the
  heathen had lost its king. The worshippers of the deposed god, sullen,
  furious, and bitterly disabused, made their way out of the temple and looked
  up at the serene blue sky, the unclouded sunshine, for some symptoms of an
  avenging tempest; but in vain.</p>

  <p>Theophilus had also quitted the scene with the Comes, leaving the work of
  devastation in the competent hands of the monks. He knew his skin-clad
  adherents well; and he knew that within a very few days not an idol, not a
  picture, not a token would remain intact to preserve the memory of the old
  gods; a thousand slaves charged to sweep the Serapeum from the face of the
  earth would have given his impatience twenty times as long to wait. The Comes
  went off at once to the Hippodrome, preceded by hundreds who had hurried off
  to tell the assembled multitude that Alexandria had lost her god.</p>

  <p>Constantine, however, had not left the temple; he had withdrawn into one
  of the aisles and seated himself on the steps, where he remained, sunk in
  thought and gazing at the ground. He was a soldier and took service and
  discipline in earnest. What he had done he had been forced to do; but no one
  could guess how hard it had been to him to fulfil this terrible duty. His own
  act was abominable in his eyes, and yet he would have done it again
  to-morrow, if it had again been required of him under similar circumstances.
  He bewailed the beautiful statue as a lost treasure of art; but he felt that
  it was indispensable that it should perish out of the world. And at the same
  time he thought of Gorgo, wondering how she&mdash;who had only the day before
  pledged herself to him, whom he loved with fervent passion, to whom, as he
  well knew, his faith was something monstrous in its contempt for
  beauty&mdash;would bear to learn that he, her lover, was the man who, like
  some coarse barbarian, had defaced this noble work and ruined this vision of
  beauty, no less dear to him than it was to her. Still, as he sat brooding and
  searching the very depths of his soul, he could not help feeling that he had
  certainly acted rightly and would do the same again, even at the risk of
  losing her. To him Gorgo, was the noblest of God's creatures, and how could
  he have borne to go through life at her side with a stain on his honor? But
  he did not conceal from himself the fact that his deed had opened a wide gulf
  between them; and it was with deep pathos that his thoughts recurred to the
  antique conception of tragedy&mdash;of fate which pursues its innocent
  victims as though they were guilty. This day perhaps would witness the sunset
  of his life's joy, would drive him forth once more to war&mdash;to fight, and
  do nothing but fight, till death should meet him on the battle-field. And as
  he sat there his eyes grew dim and heavy and his head fell on his heaving
  breast.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he felt a light touch on his shoulder, and turning round, he saw
  Gorgo standing with her hand outstretched; he started to his feet, seized it
  with eager passion and looking sadly into the young girl's eyes said, with
  deep emotion:</p>

  <p>"I would I might hold this hand forever&mdash;but you will leave me, you
  will turn from me when I tell you of the deed that mine has done."</p>

  <p>"I know it," she said firmly. "And it was a hard task even for you&mdash;a
  painful duty&mdash;was it not?"</p>

  <p>"Terrible! horrible!" he exclaimed with a shudder, as he recalled the
  feelings of that momentous instant. She looked sympathetically into his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"And you did it," she cried, "because you felt that you must and will be
  wholly what you profess to be? It is right&mdash;the only right; I feel it
  so. I will try to imitate you, and rise above the half-heartedness which is
  the bane of existence, and which makes the firm path of life a trembling,
  swaying bridge. I am yours, wholly yours; I have none other gods but yours,
  and for love of you I will learn to love your God&mdash;for you have often
  and often called him a God of Love."</p>

  <p>"And He is a God of Love!" cried Constantine, "and you will know him and
  confess him even without teaching; for our Saviour lives in every heart that
  is filled with love. Oh! Gorgo, I have destroyed that beautiful idol, but I
  will let you see that even a Christian can duly value and cherish beauty in
  his home and in his heart."</p>

  <p>"I am sure of it," she exclaimed joyfully. "The world goes on its way and
  does not quake, in spite of the fall of Serapis; but I feel as though in my
  inmost soul a world had perished and a new one was created, nobler and purer,
  and perhaps even more lovely than the old one!"</p>

  <p>He pressed her hand to his lips; she signed to him to follow her and led
  the way to her father's couch. Porphyrius was sitting up, supported in the
  physician's arms; his eyes were open, and as they entered he greeted them
  with a faint smile.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The spacious Hippodrome was filled with some thousands of
  spectators. At first many rows of seats had been left vacant, though usually
  on the eve of the great races, the people would set out soon after midnight
  and every place would be filled long before the games began; indeed the upper
  tiers of the tribune, which were built of wood and were free to all comers,
  with standing-room behind, were commonly so crowded early in the morning that
  the crush ended in a free fight.</p>

  <p>On this occasion, the storm of the previous night, the anxiety caused by
  the conflict round the Serapeum, and the prevalent panic as to the
  approaching end of the world, kept great numbers away from their favorite
  diversion; but when the sky recovered its radiant blue, and when it became
  known that the statue of Serapis had escaped uninjured in the siege of his
  sanctuary&mdash;when Cynegius, the Imperial legate, and Evagrius, the city-
  prefect, had entered the theatre with much pomp, followed by several senators
  and ladies and gentlemen of rank-Christians, Heathen, and Jews&mdash;the most
  timid took courage; the games had been postponed for an hour, and before the
  first team was led into the arched shed whence the chariots started, the
  seats, though less densely packed than usual, were amply filled.</p>

  <p>The number of chariots entered for competition was by no means smaller
  than on former occasions, for the heathen had strained every nerve to show
  their fellow-citizens of different creeds, and especially Caesar's
  representative, that, in spite of persecution and in defiance of Imperial
  edicts, they were still a power worthy of consideration. The Christians, on
  their part, did their utmost to outdo the idolaters on the same ground where,
  not long since, they had held quite the second place.</p>

  <p>The Bishop's epigram: That Christianity had ceased to be the religion of
  the poor, was amply confirmed; the greater proportion of the places for
  senators, officials and rich citizens were occupied by its adherents, and the
  men and women who professed the Faith were by no means behind their heathen
  peers in magnificence of dress and jewels.</p>

  <p>The horses, too, entered by the Christians could not fail to please the
  connoisseur, as they punctually made their appearance behind the starting-
  place, though he might have felt more confidence&mdash;and not without
  reason&mdash;in the heathen steeds, and more particularly in their drivers,
  each of whom had won on an average nine races out of ten.</p>

  <p>The horses in the quadriga with which Marcus, the son of Mary, made his
  appearance in the arena had never before been driven in the Hippodrome.
  Demetrius, the owner's brother, had bred and trained them&mdash;four
  magnificent black Arabs&mdash;and they excited much interest among the
  knowing judges who were wont to collect and lounge about the 'oppidum', as it
  was called, behind the 'carceres'* to inspect the racers, predict the winner,
  offer counsel to the drivers, and make bets. These perfect creatures were
  perhaps as fine as the famous team of golden bays belonging to Iphicrates,
  which so often had proved victorious; but the agitatores, or drivers,
  attracted even more interest than the horses. Marcus, though he knew how to
  handle the reins&mdash;he had already been seen in experimental
  races&mdash;could hardly hold his own against Hippias, the handsome young
  heathen, who, like most of the drivers in the arena, was an agitator by
  profession. A story was told of his having driven over a bridge which was not
  quite as wide as the outside edges of his chariot-wheels; and there were many
  witnesses to the feat he had performed of writing his mistress' name with his
  chariot-tracks in the sand of the Hippodrome.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The covered sheds or stalls in which the horses were
  brought to wait for the start. ]</p>

  <p>The betting was freest and the wagers highest on Hippias and the team
  belonging to Iphicrates. Some few backed Marcus and his Arabs, but for
  smaller sums; and when they compared the tall but narrow-shouldered figure of
  the young Christian with the heroic breadth of Hippias' frame, and his
  delicate features, dreamy blue eyes and downy black moustache with the
  powerful Hermes-head of his rival, they were anxious about their money. If
  his brother now, the farmer Demetrius&mdash;who was standing by the horses'
  heads&mdash;or some well-known agitator had held the reins, it would have
  been a pleasure and a profit to back such horses. Marcus had been abroad,
  too, and men shrugged their shoulders over that, for it was not till the last
  few days that he had been seen exercising his horses in the Hippodrome.</p>

  <p>Time was going on, and the Imperial envoy, who had been elected to preside
  as judge, at length took his place; Demetrius whispered a few last words of
  advice to his brother and went back into the arena. He had secured a good
  place on the stone podium and on the shady side, though there were several
  seats vacant among those belonging to his family; but he did not care to
  occupy one of these, preferring to keep out of the way of his step-mother,
  who had made her appearance with a senator and his wife to whom she was
  related. He had not seen her for two days; his promise to Karnis that he
  would try to find Dada, had kept him fully occupied, and he had done his best
  in all earnest to discover the girl.</p>

  <p>The honest indignation with which this young creature had refused his
  splendid offers, in spite of the modest circumstances of her life, had roused
  his respect, and he had felt it an insult to himself and to his brother when
  Gorgo had spoken of her with contempt. For his part, he had never met with
  any one more fascinating; he could not cease dreaming of her, and the thought
  that she might be swallowed up in the foul mire of a great city made him
  miserable. His brother had the first claim on her and he would not dispute
  it; while he had sought her unweariedly in every resort of the young and
  gay&mdash;nay even in Canopus&mdash;he had only meant to place her in safety,
  as a treasure which runs a risk of being lost to the family, though, when at
  last its possession is secured, it becomes the property of the member who can
  prove the best right of ownership. But all his efforts had been in vain; and
  it was in an unhappy mood that he went at last to the Hippodrome. There the
  bitter hostility and party-feeling which he had everywhere observed during
  his present visit to his native city, were not less conspicuous than they had
  been in the streets. The competing chariots usually arrived at the
  amphitheatre in grand procession, but this had not been thought advisable in
  the prevailing excitement; they had driven into the oppidum singly and
  without any display; and the images of the gods, which in former days had
  always been placed on the spina* before the games began, had long since
  fallen into disuse.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The spina was the division down the middle of the
  arena. At each end of it were placed the metae or goals, at a distance from
  it of about 13 feet. The spina was originally constructed of wood,
  subsequently it was of stone, and its height was generally about 29 feet. The
  spina in the Circus of Caracalla was more than 900 feet long. ]</p>

  <p>All this was vexatious to Demetrius, and when he had taken his seat it was
  in no pleasant temper that he looked round at the ranks of spectators.</p>

  <p>His step-mother was sitting on the stuffed bench covered with lion-skins
  which was reserved for the family. Her tunic and skirt displayed the color
  blue of the Christian charioteer, being made of bright blue and silver
  brocade of a beautiful pattern in which the cross, the fish, and the
  olive-branch were elegantly combined. Her black hair was closely and simply
  smoothed over her temples and she wore no garland, but a string of large grey
  pearls, from which hung a chaplet of sapphires and opals, lying on her
  forehead. A veil fell over the back of her head and she sat gazing into her
  lap as if she were absorbed in prayer; her hands were folded and held a
  cross. This placid and demure attitude she deemed becoming to a Christian
  matron and widow. Everyone might see that she had not come for worldly
  pleasure, but merely to be present at a triumph of her
  fellow-Christians&mdash;and especially her son&mdash;over the idolaters.
  Everything about her bore witness to the Faith, even the pattern on her dress
  and the shape of her ornaments; down to the embroidery on her silk gloves, in
  which a cross and an anchor were so designed as to form a Greek X, the
  initial letter of the name of Christ. Her ambition was to appear simple and
  superior to all worldly vanities; still, all she wore must be rich and
  costly, for she was here to do honor to her creed. She would have regarded it
  as a heathen abomination to wear wreaths of fresh and fragrant flowers,
  though for the money which that string of pearls had cost she might have
  decked the circus with garlands from end to end, or have fed a hundred poor
  for a twelvemonth. It seems so much easier to cheat the omniscient Creator of
  the Universe than our fellow-fools!</p>

  <p>So Dame Maria sat there in sour and virtuous dignity, looking like the
  Virgin Mary as painters and sculptors were at that time wont to represent
  her; and her farmer-son shuddered whenever his eye fell on his step-mother.
  It did him good, by contrast, to hear a hearty peal of laughter that came up
  from the lowest ranks of the podium. When he had discovered the spot from
  whence it proceeded he could hardly believe his eyes, for there sat the
  long-sought Dada, between an old man and a young woman, laughing as though
  something had just occurred to amuse her extremely. Demetrius stretched his
  limbs with a feeling of relief and satisfaction; then he rose, and seeing his
  city agent seated just behind the girl, he begged him to change places with
  him, as he thought it advisable not to lose sight of the game now it was
  caught; the old man was very ready to oblige him and went up to the other
  seat with a meaning smile.</p>

  <p>For the first time since she could recollect anything Dada had spent a
  sleepless night. Whether the wind and thunder would have sufficed to keep her
  awake who can tell; but the thoughts that had whirled through her brain had
  been varied and exciting enough to rob her of sleep. Her own people who were
  fighting for Serapis&mdash;how were they faring; and Agne&mdash;what had
  become of her? Then her mind turned to the church, and the worthy old
  priest's sermon; to the races that she was to see&mdash;and the face and
  figure of the handsome young Christian rose vividly and irresistibly before
  her fancy. Of course&mdash;of course, she wished his horses to win; but it
  was strange enough that she, Karnis' niece, should be on the side of the
  Christians. Stranger still that she had entirely ceased to believe in all the
  abuse which, from her earliest childhood, she had heard heaped on the
  followers of the crucified Jew. It could only be that Karnis had never been
  able to forgive them for having ruined his theatre at Tauromenium, and so,
  perhaps, had never known them thoroughly.</p>

  <p>She had enjoyed many a happy hour at the festivals of the old gods; and
  they were no doubt beautiful and festive divinities, or terrible when they
  were wroth; still, in the depths of her soul there had for some time lurked a
  vague, sweet longing which found no fulfilment in any heathen temple. She
  knew no name for it and would have found it hard to describe, but in the
  church, listening to the prayers and hymns and the old deacon's discourse, it
  had for the first time been stilled; she had felt then and there that,
  helpless and simple as she was, and even if she were to remain parted from
  her foster parents, she need never feel abandoned, but could rest and hope in
  a supreme, loving, and helpful power. And indeed she needed such a protector;
  she was so easily beguiled. Stephanion, a flute-player she had known in Rome,
  had wheedled everything she had a fancy for out of poor Dada, and when she
  had got into any mischief laid it all on Dada's shoulders. There must be
  something particularly helpless about her, for everyone, as a matter of
  course, took her in hand and treated her like a child, or said things that
  made her angry.</p>

  <p>In the Hippodrome, however, she forgot everything in the present pleasure,
  and was happy enough in finding herself in the lowest row of places, in the
  comfortable seats on the shady side, belonging to Posidonius, the wealthy
  Magian. This was quite different from her experience in Rome, where once, in
  the Circus Maximus, she had stood in the second tier of the wooden gallery
  and had been squeezed and pushed, while no one had taken any notice of her
  and she had only seen the races from a distance, looking down on the heads of
  the men and horses. Herse never would take her a second time, for, as they
  came out, they had been followed and spoken to by men, young and old; and
  after that her aunt had fancied she never could be safe, scenting danger at
  every turn, and would not allow her ever again to go out alone in the
  city.</p>

  <p>This was altogether a much finer place, for here she was parted from the
  race-course only by a narrow watercourse which, as it happened, was bridged
  over just in front of her; the horses would pass close to her; and besides,
  it was pleasant to be seen and to feel conscious of a thousand flattering
  glances centered on herself.</p>

  <p>Even the great Cynegius, Caesar's envoy and deputy, who had often noticed
  her on board ship, turned again and again to look at her. He was carried in
  on a golden litter by ten huge negroes, preceded by twelve lictors bearing
  fasces wreathed with laurel; and he took his seat, robed in purple and
  embroidery, on a magnificent throne in the middle of the tribune above the
  starting sheds; however, Dada troubled herself no more about the overdressed
  old man.</p>

  <p>Her eyes were everywhere, and she made Medius or his daughter name
  everybody and explain everything. Demetrius was delighted with her eager
  enjoyment; presently, nudging the singer, she whispered to him with much
  satisfaction:</p>

  <p>"Look how the people down below are craning their necks to look at us! My
  dress is so very pretty&mdash;I wonder where your friend Posidonius gets
  these lovely roses. There are above a hundred buds in this garland across my
  shoulders and down to my girdle, I counted them in the litter as I came
  along. It is a pity they should die so soon; I shall dry the leaves and make
  scent of them."</p>

  <p>Demetrius could not resist the temptation; he leaned forward and said over
  her shoulder: "There are hardly enough for that."</p>

  <p>At this unexpected address Dada looked round, and she blushed as she
  recognized Marcus' brother; he, however, hastened to assure her that he
  deeply regretted his audacious proposals of two days since, and the girl
  laughed, and said that he had come off worst, and that she might have sent
  him away a little more civilly perhaps; but the truth was she had been out of
  temper to begin with&mdash;any one would be cross that was treated as Dame
  Herse had treated her: hiding her shoes and leaving her a prisoner on the
  deck of a barge in the middle of a lake! Then she introduced him to Medius,
  and finally enquired about Marcus and his horses, and whether he had any
  chance of winning the race.</p>

  <p>The countryman answered all her questions; and when, presently, a flower-
  girl came along the ranks of seats, selling wreaths of blue and red flowers
  and ribbands, Demetrius bought two lovely olive-wreaths to fling to the
  winner&mdash;his brother he hoped. Medius and his daughter wore red
  knots&mdash;the color of the Heathen, and Dada, following their example, had
  a similar bow on her shoulder; now, however, she accepted a blue ribband that
  Demetrius bought for her and pinned it in the place of the red one as being
  the color of Marcus, to the old singer's great annoyance. Demetrius laughed
  loudly in his deep bass tones, declaring that his brother was already most
  anxious to win, and that, when he saw her with these ribbands he would strain
  every nerve, in gratitude for her partisanship. He could assure her that
  Marcus thought of her constantly.</p>

  <p>"I am glad of that," she said simply; and she added that it was the same
  with her, for she had been thinking all night of Marcus and his horses.
  Medius could not help remarking that Karnis and Herse would take it very ill
  that she should display the Christian color to-day of all days; to which she
  only replied that she was sorry for that, but that she liked blue better than
  red. The answer was so abrupt and short that it startled Demetrius, who had
  hitherto seen Dada gentle and pliant; and it struck him at once how deep an
  aversion the girl felt for her present protectors.</p>

  <p>There was music, as usual, in the towers at either end of the row of
  carceres; but it was less stirring and cheerful than of yore, for flutes, and
  several of the heathen airs had been prohibited. Formerly, too, the
  Hippodrome had been a place where lovers could meet and where many a
  love-affair had been brought to a happy climax; but to-day none of the
  daughters of the more respectable families were allowed to quit the women's
  apartments in their own homes, for danger was in the air; the course of
  events in the Serapeum had kept many of the younger men from witnessing the
  races, and some mysterious influence seemed to weigh upon the gaiety and
  mirth of which the Hippodrome on a gala day was usually the headquarters.</p>

  <p>Wild excitement, expectation strung to the highest pitch, and party-
  feeling, both for and against, had always, of course, been rife here; but to-
  day they were manifest in an acuter form&mdash;hatred had added its taint and
  lent virulence to every emotion. The heathen were oppressed and angered,
  their rights abridged and defied; they saw the Christians triumphant at every
  point, and hatred is a protean monster which rages most fiercely and most
  venomously when it has lurked in the foul career of envy.</p>

  <p>The Christians could hate, too, and they hated the idolaters who gloried
  with haughty self-sufficiency in their intellectual inheritance; the
  traditions of a brilliant past. They, who had been persecuted and contemned,
  now had the upper hand; they were in power, and the more insolently they
  treated their opponents, the more injustice they did them, and the less the
  victimized heathen were able to revenge themselves, the more bitterly did the
  Christians detest the party they contemned as superstitious idolaters. In
  their care for the soul&mdash;the spiritual and divine part&mdash;the
  Christians had hitherto neglected the graces of the body; thus the heathen
  had remained the undisputed masters of the palaestra and the hippodrome. In
  the gymnasium the Christian refused even to compete, for the exhibition of
  his naked body he regarded as an abomination; but on the race-course he had
  lately been willing to display his horses, and many times had disputed the
  crown with the hereditary victors, so that, even here, the heathen felt his
  time-honored and undisputed supremacy endangered. This was
  intolerable&mdash;this must be averted&mdash;the mere thought of being beaten
  on this ground roused the idolaters to wrath and malice. They displayed their
  color in wreaths of scarlet poppies, pomegranate flowers and red roses, with
  crimson ribbands and dresses; white and green, the colors formerly adopted by
  the competitors, were abandoned; for all the heathen were unanimous in
  combining their forces against the common foe. The ladies used red sun-shades
  and the very baskets, in which the refreshments were brought for the day,
  were painted red.</p>

  <p>The widow Mary, on the other hand, and all the Christians were robed in
  blue from head to foot, their sandals being tied with blue ribbands; and
  Dada's blue shoulder-knot was in conspicuous contrast to her bright
  rose-colored dress.</p>

  <p>The vendors of food who wandered round the circus had eggs dyed blue and
  red, cakes with sugared icing and refreshing drinks in jars of both colors.
  When a Christian and a Heathen found themselves seated side by side, each
  turned a shoulder to the other, or, if they were forced to sit face to face,
  eyed each other with a scowl.</p>

  <p>Cynegius did all he could to postpone the races as long as possible; he
  was anxious to wait till the Comes had finished his task in the Serapeum, so
  that the troops might be free to act in any emergency that might arise before
  the contests in the Hippodrome were fairly ended. Time did not hang heavy on
  his hands for the vast multitude here assembled interested him greatly,
  though he had frequently been a spectator of similar festivities in Rome and
  Constantinople; but this crowd differed in many particulars from the populace
  of those cities. In the topmost tiers of free seats black and brown faces
  predominated greatly over white ones; in the cushioned and carpeted ranks of
  the stone podium&mdash;the lower portion of the amphitheatre&mdash;mingled
  with Greeks and Egyptians, sat thousands of splendidly dressed men and women
  with strongly-marked Semitic features: members of the wealthy Jewish
  community, whose venerable head, the Alabarch, a dignified patriarch in Greek
  dress, sat with the chief members of the senate, near the envoy's
  tribune.</p>

  <p>The Alexandrians were not a patient race and they were beginning to rebel
  against the delay, making no small noise and disturbance, when Cynegius rose
  and with his white handkerchief waved the signal for the races to begin. The
  number of spectators had gradually swelled from fifty to sixty and to eighty
  thousand; and no less than thirty-six chariots were waiting behind the
  carceres ready to start.</p>

  <p>Four 'missus' or races were to be run. In each of the three first twelve
  chariots were to start, and in the fourth only the leaders in the three
  former ones were to compete. The winner of the olive-wreath and palmbranch in
  this final heat would bear the honors of the day; his party would be
  victorious and he would quit the Hippodrome in triumph.</p>

  <p>Lots were now drawn in the oppidum to decide which shed each chariot was
  to start from, and in which naissus each was to run. It was Marcus' fate to
  start among the first lot, and, to the horror of those who had backed his
  chances, Hippias, the hero of the Hippodrome, was his rival, with the four
  famous bays.</p>

  <p>Heathen priests poured libations to Poseidon, and Phoebus Apollo, the
  patron divinities of horses and of the Hippodrome&mdash;for sacrifices of
  blood were prohibited; while Christian presbyters and exorcists blessed the
  rival steeds in the name of the Bishop. A few monks had crept in, but they
  were turned out by the heathen with bitter jeers, as unbidden intruders.</p>

  <p>Cynegius repeated his signal. The sound of the tuba rang through the air,
  and the first twelve chariots were led into the starting-sheds. A few minutes
  later a machine was set in motion by which a bronze eagle was made to rise
  with outspread wings high into the air, from an altar in front of the
  carceres; this was the signal for the chariots to come forth from their
  boxes. They took up their positions close behind a broad chalk line, traced
  on the ground with diagonal slope, so as to reduce the disadvantage of
  standing outermost and having a larger curve to cover.</p>

  <p>Until this moment only the privileged possessors of the seats over the
  carceres had been able, by craning backwards, to see the horses and drivers;
  now the competitors were visible to the multitude which, at their first
  appearance, broke out into vociferous applause. The agitatores had to exert
  all their strength to hold in the startled and eager teams, and make them
  stand even for a few short minutes; then Cynegius signalled for the third
  time. A golden dolphin, which had been suspended from a beam, and on which
  the eye of every charioteer was fixed, dropped to the ground, a blast on the
  'salpinx', or war-trumpet, was sounded, and forty-eight horses flew forth as
  though thrown forward by one impulsion.</p>

  <p>The strength of four fine horses whirled each light, two-wheeled chariot
  over the hard causeway as though it were a toy. The down-pour of the previous
  night had laid the dust; the bright sunshine sparkled and danced in rapidly-
  changing flashes, mirrored in the polished gilding of the bronze or the
  silver fittings of the elegantly-decorated, semicircular cars in which the
  drivers stood.</p>

  <p>Five blue and seven red competitors had drawn the first lots. The eye
  rested with pleasure on the sinewy figures whose bare feet seemed rooted to
  the boards they stood on, while their eyes were riveted on the goal they were
  striving to reach, though&mdash;as the eye of the archer sees arrow, bow and
  mark all at once&mdash;they never lost sight of the horses they were guiding.
  A close cap with floating ribbands confined their hair, and they wore a short
  sleeveless tunic, swathed round the body with wide bands, as if to brace
  their muscles and add to their strength. The reins were fastened around the
  hips so as to leave the hands free, not only to hold them but also to ply the
  whip and use the goad. Each charioteer had a knife in his girdle, to enable
  him to release himself, in case of accident, from a bond that might prove
  fatal.</p>

  <p>Before long the bay team was leading alone. Behind were two Christian
  drivers, followed by three red chariots; Marcus was last of all, but it was
  easy to see that it was by choice and not by necessity that he was hanging
  back. He was holding in his fiery team with all his strength and
  weight&mdash;his body thrown back, his feet firmly set with his knees against
  the silver bar of the chariot, and his hands gripping the reins. In a few
  minutes he came flying past Dada and his brother, but he did not see them. He
  had not even caught sight of his own mother, while the professional
  charioteers had not failed to bow to Cynegius and nod to their friends. He
  could only keep his eyes and mind fixed on his horses and on the goal.</p>

  <p>The multitude clapped, roared, shouted encouragement to their party,
  hissed and whistled when they were disappointed&mdash;venting their utmost
  indignation on Marcus as he came past behind the others; but he either heard
  them not or would not hear. Dada's heart beat so wildly that she thought it
  would burst. She could not sit still; she started to her feet and then flung
  herself back on her cushions, shouting some spurring words to Marcus in the
  flash of time when he might perhaps hear them. When he had passed, her head
  fell and she said sadly enough: "Poor fellow!&mdash;We have bought our
  wreaths for nothing after all, Demetrius!"</p>

  <p>But Demetrius shook his head and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Nay," he said, "the boy has iron sinews in that slight body. Look how he
  holds the horses in! He is saving their strength till they need it. Seven
  times, child, seven times he has to go round this great circus and past the
  'nyssa'. You will see, he will catch up what he has lost, yet. Hippias, you
  see, is holding in his horses, too; it is his way of giving himself airs at
  starting. Now he is close to the 'nyssa'&mdash;the 'kampter'&mdash;the 'meta'
  they call it at Rome; the smaller the bend he can make round it the better
  for him, but it is risky work. There&mdash;you see!&mdash;They drive round
  from right to left and that throws most of the work on the lefthand beast; it
  has to turn almost in its own length. Aura, our first horse, is as supple as
  a panther and I trained her to do it, myself.&mdash;Now, look out there! that
  bronze figure of a rearing horse&mdash;the 'Taraxippos' they call it&mdash;is
  put there to frighten the horses, and Megaera, our third horse, is like a mad
  thing sometimes, though she can go like a stag; every time Marcus gets her
  quietly past the Taraxippos we are nearer to success.&mdash;Look, look,=-the
  first chariot has got round the nyssa! It is Hippias! Yes, by Zeus, he has
  done it! He is a detestable braggart, but he knows his business!"</p>

  <p>This was one of the decisive moments of the race. The crowd was silent;
  expectation was at the utmost pitch of tension, and Dada's eyes were fixed
  spell-bound on the obelisk and on the quadrigas that whirled round the
  bourn.</p>

  <p>Next to Hippias came a blue team, and close behind were three red ones.
  The Christian who had succeeded in reaching the nyssa second, boldly took his
  horses close round the obelisk, hoping to gain space and get past Hippias;
  but the left wheel of his chariot grazed the granite plinth, the light car
  was overset, and the horses of the red chariot, whose noses were almost on
  his shoulder, could not be pulled up short in time. They fell over the
  Christian's team which rolled on the ground; the red chariot, too, turned
  over, and eight snorting beasts lay struggling in the sand.</p>

  <p>The horses in the next chariot bolted as they were being driven past this
  mass of plunging and neighing confusion; they defied their driver's impotent
  efforts and galloped across the course back into the caiceres.</p>

  <p>The rest had time and space enough to beware of the wreck and to give it a
  wide berth, among them Marcus. The melee at the Meta had excited his steeds
  almost beyond control, and as they tore past the Taraxippos the third horse,
  Megaera, shied violently as Demetrius had predicted. She flung herself on one
  side, thrust her hind quarters under the pole, and kicked desperately,
  lifting the chariot quite off the ground; the young charioteer lost his
  footing and slipped. Dada covered her face with her hands, and his mother
  turned pale and knit her brows with apprehension. The youth was still
  standing; his feet were on the sand of the arena; but he had a firm grip on
  the right-hand spiral ornament that terminated the bar round the chariot.
  Many a heart stood still with anxiety, and shouts of triumph and mockery
  broke from the red party; but in less than half a minute, by an effort of
  strength and agility, he had his knees on the foot-board, and then, in the
  winking of an eye, he was on his feet in the chariot, had gathered up the
  reins and was rushing onward.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, however, Hippias had far outstripped all the rest, and as he
  flew past the carceres he checked his pace, snatched a cup from a lemonade-
  seller, tossed the contents down his throat with haughty audacity amid the
  plaudits of the crowd, and then dashed on again. A wide gap, indeed, still
  lay between him and Marcus.</p>

  <p>By the time the competitors again came round to the nyssa, the slaves in
  attendance had cleared away the broken chariots and led off the horses. A
  Christian still came next to Hippias followed by a red agitator; Marcus had
  gained on the others and was now fourth.</p>

  <p>In the third round the chariot of the red driver in front of Marcus made
  too sharp a turn and ran up against the granite. The broken car was dragged
  on by the terrified beasts, and the charioter with it, till, by the time they
  were stopped, he was a corpse. In the fifth circuit the Christian who till
  now had been second to Hippias shared the same fate, though he escaped with
  his life; and then Marcus drove past the starting-sheds next to Hippias.</p>

  <p>Hippias had ceased to flout and dally. In spite of the delay that Marcus
  had experienced from the Taraxippos, the space that parted his bays from the
  black Arabs had sensibly diminished, round after round; and the interest of
  the race now centered entirely in him and the young Christian. Never before
  had so passionate and reckless a contest been fought out on this venerable
  race-course, and the throng of spectators were carried away by the almost
  frenzied rivalry of the two drivers. Not a creature in the upper tiers had
  been able to keep his seat; men and women alike had risen to their feet and
  were shouting and roaring to the competitors. The music in the towers might
  have ceased, so completely was it drowned by the tumult in the
  amphitheatre.</p>

  <p>Only the ladies, in the best places above the starting-sheds, preserved
  their aristocratic calm; Still, when the seventh and decisive round was
  begun, even the widow Mary leaned forward a little and clasped her hands more
  tightly over the cross in her lap. Each time that Marcus had driven round the
  obelisk or past the Taraxippos, Dada had clutched her head with her hands and
  set her teeth in her lip; each time, as he happily steered clear of the fatal
  stone and whirled past the dreadful bronze statue, she had relaxed her grip
  and leaned back in her seat with a sigh of relief. Her sympathy made her one
  with Marcus; she felt as if his loss must be her death and his victory her
  personal triumph.</p>

  <p>During the sixth circuit Hippias was still a long way ahead of the young
  Christian; the distance which lay between Marcus and the team of bays seemed
  to have become a fixed quantity, for, do what he could, he could not diminish
  it by a hand-breadth. The two agitatores had now completely altered their
  tactics; instead of holding their horses in they urged them onward, leaning
  over the front of their chariots, speaking to the horses, Shouting at them
  with hoarse, breathless cries, and flogging them unsparingly. Steamy sweat
  and lathering foam streaked the flanks of the desperate, laboring brutes,
  while clouds of dust were flung up from the dry, furrowed and trampled soil.
  The other chariots were left further and further behind those of Hippias and
  Marcus, and when, for the seventh and last time, these two were nearing the
  nyssa, the crowd for a moment held its breath, only to break out into louder
  and wilder cries, and then again to be hushed. It seemed as though their
  exhausted lungs found renewed strength to shout with double energy when their
  excitement had kept them silent for a while.</p>

  <p>Dada spoke no more; pale and gasping, she sat with her eyes fixed on the
  tall obelisk and on the cloud of dust which, as the chariots neared the
  nyssa, seemed to grow denser. At about a hundred paces from the nyssa she
  saw, above the sandy curtain, the red cap of Hippias flash past, and
  then&mdash;close behind it&mdash;the blue cap worn by Marcus. Then a
  deafening, thundering roar from thousands of throats went up to heaven,
  while, round the obelisk&mdash;so close to it that not a horse, not a wheel
  could have found room between the plinth and the driver-the blue cap came
  forward out of the cloud, and, behind it now&mdash;no longer in front, though
  not more than a length behind&mdash;came the red cap of Hippias. When within
  a few feet of the nyssa, Marcus had overtaken his antagonist, had passed the
  point with a bold and perilously close turn, and had left the bays behind
  him.</p>

  <p>Demetrius saw it all, as though his eye had power to pierce the dust-
  cloud, and now he, too, lost his phlegmatic calm. He threw up his arms as if
  in prayer and shouted, as though his brother could hear him:</p>

  <p>"Well done, splendid boy! Now for the kentron&mdash;the goad&mdash;drive
  it in, send it home if they die for it! Give it them well!"</p>

  <p>Dada, who could only guess what was happening, looked round at him, asking
  in tremulous tones: "Has he passed him? Is he gaining on him? Will he win?"
  But Demetrius did not answer; he only pointed to the foremost of the flying
  clouds on which the second was fast advancing, and cried in a frenzy of
  excitement:</p>

  <p>"Death and Hades! The other is catching him up. The dog, the sneak! If
  only the boy would use his goad. Give it them, Marcus! Give it them, lad!
  Never give in now! Great Father Poseidon!&mdash;there&mdash;there!&mdash;no!
  I can hardly stand&mdash;Yes, he is still in front, and
  now&mdash;now&mdash;this must settle it! Thunder and lightning! They are
  close together again&mdash;may the dust choke him! No&mdash;it is all right;
  my Arabs are in front! All is well, keep it up, lad, well done! We have
  won!"</p>

  <p>The horses were pulled up, the dust settled; Marcus, the Christian, had
  won the first missus. Cynegius held out the crown to the victor, who bowed to
  receive it. Then he waved his hand to his mother, who graciously waved hers
  in return, and he drove into the oppidurn and was lost to sight.</p>

  <p>Hippias flung down his whip in a rage, but the triumphant shouts of the
  Christians drowned the music, the trumpet-blasts and the angry murmurs of the
  defeated heathen. Threatening fists were shaken in the air, while behind the
  carceres the drivers and owners of the red party scolded, squabbled and
  stormed; and Hippias, who by his audacious swagger had given away the race to
  their hated foe&mdash;to the Blues, the Christians&mdash;narrowly escaped
  being torn in pieces.</p>

  <p>The tumult and excitement were unparalleled; but Dada saw and heard
  nothing. She sat in a blissful dream, gazing into her lap, while tears of
  joyful reaction rolled down her cheeks. Demetrius saw her tears and was glad;
  then, pointing out Mary to the girl, he informed her that she was the mother
  of Marcus. And he registered a secret vow that, cost what it might, he would
  bring his victorious brother and this sweet child together.</p>

  <p>The second and third missus, like the first, were marked by serious
  accidents; both, however, were won for the Red party. In the fourth, the
  decisive race, there were but three competitors: Marcus and the two heathen
  winners. Demetrius watched it with less anxiety; he knew that his Arabs were
  far superior to the Egyptian breed in staying power, and they also had the
  advantage of having had a longer rest. In fact, the final victory was
  adjudged to the young Christian.</p>

  <p>Long before it was decided Dada had been impatiently fingering her
  wreaths, and could hardly wait any longer to fling them into Marcus' chariot.
  When it was all over she might perhaps have an opportunity of speaking to
  him; and she thought how delightful his voice was and what fine, kind eyes he
  had. If only he were to bid her be his, she would follow him whither and
  wherever he desired, whatever Karnis and Herse might say to the contrary. She
  thought no one could be so glad of his success as she was; she felt as if she
  belonged to him, had always belonged to him, and only some spiteful trick of
  Fate had come between them.</p>

  <p>There was a fresh blast of trumpets; the victor, in obedience to a time-
  honored custom, was to drive round the arena at a foot-pace and show his
  brave team to the multitude. He came nearer and nearer, and Demetrius
  proposed that they should cross the little watercourse that parted the podium
  from the arena and follow the chariot, so as to give his brother the wreaths
  instead of flinging them to him. The girl colored and could say neither yes
  or no; but she rose, hung one of the olive-crowns on her arm with a happy,
  bashful smile, and handed the other to her new friend; then she followed him
  across the little bridge on to the race-course which, now that the games were
  over, was crowded with Christians.</p>

  <p>The brothers exchanged pleased greetings from afar, but Marcus did not see
  Dada till she was close to him and stood, with a shy but radiant glance of
  intense delight, holding out the olive-wreath for his acceptance. He felt as
  though Heaven had wrought a miracle in his favor. Never before had he thought
  her half so lovely. She seemed to have grown since he had seen her last, to
  have gained a deeper and nobler expression; and he observed, too, the blue
  favors on her shoulder and among the roses that crowned her fair curls.
  Gladness and surprise prevented his speaking; but he took the garland she
  offered him and, seizing her hands, stammered out: "Thanks&mdash;thank you,
  Dada."</p>

  <p>Their eyes met, and as he gazed into her face he forgot where he was, did
  not even wonder why his brother had suddenly turned away and, beginning some
  long-winded speech, had rushed after a man who hastily covered his head and
  tried to escape; he did not notice that thousands of eyes were fixed on him,
  and among them his mother's; he could merely repeat: "thanks" and
  "Dada"&mdash;the only words he could find. He would perhaps have gone on
  repeating them, but that he was interrupted; the 'porta
  libitinaria'&mdash;the gate through which the dead or injured were usually
  carried out, was thrown open, and a rabble of infuriated heathen rushed in,
  crying: "Serapis is fallen! They have destroyed the image of Serapis! The
  Christians are ruining the sanctuaries of the gods!"</p>

  <p>A sudden panic seized the assembled multitude; the Reds rushed down from
  their places into the arena to hear the details and ask questions&mdash;ready
  to fight for the god or to fly for safety. In an instant the victor's chariot
  was surrounded by an angry mob; Dada clutched it for protection, and Marcus,
  without pausing to reflect&mdash;indeed hardly master of his own
  actions&mdash;turned and lifted her into it by his side; then, urging his
  horses forward, he forced a way through the crowd, past the caiceres. He
  glanced anxiously up at the seats but could nowhere see his mother, so he
  guided the exhausted beasts, steaming with sweat and dappled with foam,
  through the open gate and out of the circus. His stable-slaves had run after
  him; he released himself from the reins on his hips and flung them to the
  grooms. Then he helped Dada to leap from the car.</p>

  <p>"Will you come with me?" he asked her simply; and the girl's reply was:
  "Wherever you bid me."</p>

  <p>At the news that Serapis was overthrown Dame Mary had started from her
  seat with eager haste that ill-became her dignity and, under the protection
  of the body-guard in attendance on Cynegius, had found her way to her
  litter.</p>

  <p>In the Hippodrome the tumult rose to a riot; Reds and Blues rushed from
  the upper tiers, down the ranks of the podium and into the dusty race-course;
  falling on each other tooth and nail like wild beasts; and the bloody
  fray&mdash;no uncommon termination to the day, even in more peaceful
  times&mdash;lasted till the Imperial soldiery parted the unarmed
  combatants.</p>

  <p>The Bishop was triumphant; his adherents had won the day at every point;
  nor was he sorry to learn that Olympius, Helladius, Ainmonius and many other
  spiritual leaders of the heathen world had succeeded in escaping. They might
  come back; they might preach and harangue as much as they chose: their power
  was broken. The Church had nothing now to fear from them, and their
  philosophy and learning would still and always be valuable in the mental
  training of her priests.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The great Hippodrome of Alexandria was outside the Canopic
  gate, on the northern side of the road leading to Eleusis which to-day was
  crowded with passengers, all moving in the same direction. The tumult roused
  by the intelligence that Serapis was overthrown made all the more peaceful
  and peace-loving of the spectators hurry homewards; and as these, for the
  most part, were of the richer classes, who came and went in litters or
  chariots, their conveyances left but scanty space on the wide causeway for
  foot passengers, still, there they were, in considerable numbers, all wending
  their way towards the city, and the heathen who came rushing towards the
  Hippodrome behind the first heralds of the disaster, had great difficulty in
  making their way against the stream.</p>

  <p>Marcus and Dada allowed themselves to be carried onward by the throng
  which was tending towards the city-walls and the Canopic gate. Phabis, Mary's
  old steward, whose duty it had been to help his young master to dress after
  the races were over, had snatched the agitator's cap from the youth's head
  and flung a cloak over his shoulders, hastily following him as he went off
  with the young girl by his side. The old man quite understood what was in the
  wind for he it was who had conducted Dame Herse to his mistress' presence. He
  had thought her a shrewd and kind-hearted woman, and it now struck him that
  she must certainly have been in the right when she accused Marcus of designs
  on her pretty niece. At the time he had refused to believe it, for he had
  never in his life detected his young master in any underhand or forbidden
  courses; but, after all, Marcus was his father's son, and, in his younger
  days, the old man had often and often had to risk his skin in Apelles'
  love-intrigues. And now it was the Son's turn&mdash;and if he were to take
  his fancy for that pretty chit as seriously as he did most things, if he got
  the notion into his head of marrying the little singer&mdash;what a storm
  there was brewing between him and his mother!</p>

  <p>The old man did his best to keep up with Marcus who did not see or heed
  him, for his eyes and attention were centered on the fair companion who was
  clinging to his arm, while he tried to force a passage through the mob,
  towards the gate. Miracle on miracle seemed to him to have been wrought in
  his behalf; for Heaven had not only sent him Dada, but she was wearing blue
  ribbands; and when he asked her why, she had replied "For your sake, and
  because I like your Faith."</p>

  <p>He was tired to death; but as soon as Dada had put her hand through his
  arm he lead felt refreshed as if by magic. His swollen and blistered hands,
  to be sure, were painful and his shoulders ached and winced from stiffness;
  but as she pressed his arm to her side and looked up gladly in his
  face&mdash;telling him how happy she was while he responded: "And how I love
  you!"&mdash;he felt himself in Heaven, and pain and discomfort were
  forgotten. The crush did not allow them to say more than a few words; but the
  things their eyes and lips could smile were sweeter and dearer than anything
  they had ever known before.</p>

  <p>They had got through the gate and were in the Canopic way when Dada
  suddenly perceived that his lips were white, and felt the arm tremble on
  which her hand was lying. She asked him what ailed him; he made no reply, but
  put his hand to his head, so she led him aside into the public garden that
  lay to their right between the little Stadium and the Maeandrian circus. In
  this pretty spot, fresh with verdure and spring flowers, she soon found a
  bench shaded by a semicircular screen of dark-tufted tamarisk, and there she
  made him lie down. He yielded at once, and his pale face and fixed gaze
  showed her that he was in a fainting state. Indeed, he must be quite worn out
  by the terrible struggle of the race, and after it was over he had not given
  himself time to take a cup of drink or a scrap of food for refreshment. It
  was only too natural that his strength should fail him, so, without feeling
  at all alarmed but only very pitiful and anxious to help, she ran back to a
  fruit-stall which they had passed at the entrance to the garden from the
  street.</p>

  <p>How glad she was that she still had the four drachmae which she had coaxed
  out of Karnis in the Xenodochium that evening; she could buy whatever she
  liked for her lover. When she went back-loaded with oranges, apples, hard-
  boiled eggs, bread and salt, in the skirt of her dress that she gathered up
  with one hand, and with a flask of wine and water, and a gourdbowl in the
  other-she found him still lying unconscious. However, when she had moistened
  his forehead and lips he opened his eyes, and then she peeled him an orange
  as daintily as she could and begged him to try it, and as she was herself
  very hungry she took a hearty share. She was enchanted at making him her
  guest, and at finding that he enjoyed the simple meal and soon was quite
  revived. In fact, in a few minutes he had altogether recovered his strength
  and consciousness of satisfaction; and as he lay back with Dada's hand in
  his, gazing happily and thankfully into her sweet eyes, a sense of peace,
  rest and bliss came over him such as he had never before known. He thought he
  had never tasted such delicious food, or such exquisite wine as the wretched
  Mareotic from the fruitstall. He took the apple she had begun eating out of
  her hand and bit it where her white teeth had been; he made her drink first
  out of the gourd-cup, and, as one of the three eggs she had brought with her
  was bad, they had quite a little battle for the last, till he finally gave
  way and eat it.</p>

  <p>When they had finished Dada's purchases to the last mouthful she asked
  him, for the first time, where he meant to take her, and he said he intended
  placing her in the house of his former tutor, Eusebius, the deacon, where she
  would be a welcome guest and find her old companion Agne. Of this she was
  sincerely glad; and when, on hearing the title of Deacon, she questioned
  Marcus further, and identified Eusebius as the worthy old man whose discourse
  in the basilica had so deeply impressed her, she told Marcus how she had gone
  into the church, and how, from that hour, she had felt at peace. A quite new
  feeling had sprung up in her soul, and since then she had constantly longed
  to see him again and talk it all over with him:&mdash;The little she had
  learnt of Christian doctrine did her heart good and had given her comfort and
  courage. The world was so beautiful, and there were many more good men than
  bad. It was a pleasure to love one's neighbor, and as for forgiving a
  wrong&mdash;that she had never found difficult. It must be good to live on
  earth if everyone loved his neighbor as she loved him and he loved her; and
  life could not be a great hardship if in every trouble there was some one who
  was always ready to hear our cry and help us, out of pure beneficence.</p>

  <p>Her innocent talk was to Marcus the greatest marvel of this day of
  miracles. The soul which he had dreamed that he was called to save had, of
  its own accord, turned to walk in the path of salvation; he went on to tell
  her of the things which he felt to be most sublime and glorious in his creed,
  and at length he confessed that, though he had always loved his neighbor for
  Christ's sake, never till now had true and perfect love been revealed to him.
  No power on earth could now part him from her, and when she should have been
  baptized there would be no further difficulty; their love might last till,
  and beyond, death, through all the ages of eternity. And she listened to him,
  perfectly content; and said that she was his, wholly his, now, and for ever
  and ever.</p>

  <p>There were to-day but few people in the garden which was usually full in
  the afternoon, of idlers, and of children with their nurses; but the
  disturbance in the streets had kept these at home, and the idlers had found
  more to attract them at the Hippodrome and in the crowded roads. This favored
  the lovers, who could sit hand in hand, looking into each other's eyes; and
  when old Phabis, who had lost sight of them long since, at length discovered
  them in the park, he could see from his lurking-place as he crept closer,
  that his young master, after glancing cautiously round, pressed a kiss on the
  little singer's hair, and then on her eyes and at last on her lips.</p>

  <p>The hours flew fast between serious talk and delightful dalliance, and
  when they tore themselves away from their quiet retreat it was already dusk.
  They soon found themselves in the Canopic way, in the thick of the crowd
  which they were now occasionally obliged to meet, for those who were making
  homewards had long since dispersed, and thousands were still crowding to the
  Hippodrome where a brisk fight was still going on. As they passed his
  mother's house Marcus paused and, pointing it out to Dada, told her that the
  day was not far distant when he should bring her home hither. But the girl's
  face fell.</p>

  <p>"Oh no!" she exclaimed, in a low voice. "Not here-not to this great palace
  in a street. Let us live in a little house, quite quietly, by ourselves. A
  house with a garden, and a seat in the shade. Your mother lives here!"</p>

  <p>And then she blushed scarlet and looked down. He guessed, however, what
  was passing in her mind, and bid her only to have patience, for as soon as
  she was a baptized Christian Eusebius would intercede for her. And he spoke
  warmly of his mother's piety and virtues, and asked Dada if she had seen her
  at the races.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied timidly; and when he went on to ask her if she had not
  thought Mary very handsome and dignified, she answered frankly:
  "Yes&mdash;very; but then she is so tall and grand-looking-she must wish for
  a daughter-in-law very different from a poor, forsaken orphan like me&mdash;a
  mere singer, looked down upon by every one! It is different with you; you are
  satisfied with me as I am, and you know that I love you. If I never find my
  uncle again I have no one on earth to care for me but you; but I want no
  other, for you are my one and only hope, and to live for you and with you is
  enough. Only you must never leave me or I shall die! But you never can, for
  you told me that my soul was dearer to you than your own life; and so long as
  I have you and your love I shall grow better and better every day; but if you
  ever let me be parted from you I shall be utterly lost. Yes, understand that
  once for all&mdash;ruined and lost, body and soul!&mdash;I do not know what
  it is that terrifies me, but do let us go on, away from this house. Suppose
  your mother were to see us!"</p>

  <p>He did as she wished and tried to soothe her, praising his mother's
  virtues with the affectionate blindness of a son; but she only half listened
  to his eulogy, for, as they approached Rhacotis* the throng grew denser, they
  had no opportunities for conversation, they could think of nothing but
  battling their way through the crowd; still, they were happy.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The quarter of the city inhabited by the Egyptians. It
  was the old town close to which Alexander the Great built his splendid new
  city. ]</p>

  <p>They thus got to the street of the Sun&mdash;one of the main arteries of
  the city cutting the Canopic way at right angles&mdash;and they went down it
  towards the Gate of Helios in the south wall. The Serapeum lay to their
  right, several streets leading to it from the street of the Sun. To reach the
  house where Eusebius lived they ought to have turned down the street of the
  Acropolis, but a compact mass of frenzied creatures came storming down it
  from the Serapeum, and towards them. The sun was now fast setting over the
  City of the Dead on the western horizon. Marcus tried to get out of the
  middle of the road and place Dada in safety by the house at the corner, but
  in vain; the rabble that came crowding out of the side street was mad with
  excitement, and could think of nothing but the trophies it had snatched from
  the temple. Several dozen men, black and white alike&mdash;and among them
  some monks and even women, had harnessed themselves to an enormous truck,
  commonly used for the carriage of beams, columns, and heavy blocks of stone,
  on which they had erected a huge but shapeless mass of wood, the core, and
  all that remained, of the image of Serapis; this they were dragging through
  the streets.</p>

  <p>"To the Hippodrome! Burn it! Down with the idols! Look at the divine form
  of Serapis! Behold the god!"</p>

  <p>These were the cries that rent the air from a thousand throats, an ear-
  splitting accompaniment to the surging storm of humanity.</p>

  <p>The monks had torn the desecrated block from the niche in the Serapeum,
  hauled it through the courts on to the steps, and were now taking it to the
  arena where it was to be burnt. Others of their kidney, and some of the
  Christian citizens who had caught the destructive mania, had forced their way
  into the temple of Anubis, hard by the Serapeumn, where they had overthrown
  and wrecked the jackal-headed idols and the Canopic gods&mdash;four huge jars
  with lids representing respectively a man's head, an ape's, a hawk's and a
  jackal's. They were now bearing these heads in triumph, while others were
  shouldering the limbs of broken statues of Apollo, of Athene, or of
  Aphrodite, or carrying the fragments in baskets to cast them into the flames
  in the Hippodrome after the wooden stock of the great Serapis. The mob had
  broken off the noses of all the heads, had smeared the marble with pitch, or
  painted it grossly with the red paint they had found in the writing-rooms of
  the Sera peum. Every one who could get near enough to the remains of the
  statue, or to a fragment of a ruined idol, spit upon it, struck it or thrust
  at it; and not a heathen had, as yet, dared to interfere.</p>

  <p>Behind the oak block of the image of Serapis and the other trophies of
  victory, came an endless stream of men of all ages, of monks and of women,
  compelling a large carruca* that had fallen into their hands, and which they
  had completely surrounded, to keep pace with them. The two fine horses that
  drew it had to be led by the bridle; they were trembling with terror and
  excitement and made repeated attempts to kick over the pole or to rear.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* A four-wheeled chariot used in the city and for
  travelling. ]</p>

  <p>In this vehicle was Porphyrius, who had fully recovered consciousness, and
  by his side sat Gorgo. Constantine had not stirred from the side of the
  convalescent till Apuleius had pronounced him out of all danger; but then the
  young officer's duty had called him away. The merchant had hailed the news of
  his daughter's, union with the companion of her childhood as a most
  satisfactory and long-expected event.</p>

  <p>A party of the Prefect's guards had been charged to bring the carriage for
  Porphyrius to the door of the temple, and the abbot of a monastery at
  Arsinoe, who was well known to the Prefect, undertook to escort them on their
  road home and protect them from the attacks of the raving mob. At the spot
  where the side street intersected the street of the Sun, and where Marcus and
  Dada had been forced to stop, unable either to proceed or to return, a troop
  of armed heathen had given the Christian rabble a check at the very moment
  when the carruca came up, and falling on the foe who had mocked and insulted
  their most sacred treasure, began a furious fray. Quite close to the young
  lovers a heathen cut down a Christian who was carrying the besmirched head of
  a Muse. Dada clung in terror to Marcus, who was beginning to be seriously
  alarmed for her when, looking round for aid or refuge, he caught sight of his
  brother forcing his way through the throng, and gesticulating vehemently. The
  farmer was telegraphing to the occupants of the carruca as well, and when he
  at last reached Marcus he briefly explained to him that the first thing to be
  done was to place Dada in safety.</p>

  <p>Only too glad to be out of the crush and danger, the girl nimbly climbed
  into the chariot, and, after hastily greeting the father and daughter, signed
  to Marcus to follow her; but Demetrius held his brother back, and it was
  hurriedly agreed that Dada should be sent for that evening to the house of
  Porphyrius. Demetrius whispered a few words of enthusiastic praise of the
  little singer into Gorgo's ear; then the carriage moved on again. Many of the
  heathen who had collected round it recognized Porphyrius, the noble friend of
  the great Olympius, and cleared a passage for him, so that at last he got out
  of the gate uninjured, and turned into the quieter street of Euergetes which
  led to the temple of Isis, the ship-yard and the merchant's residence.</p>

  <p>But few words were exchanged in the chariot, for it was only step by step
  and with considerable difficulty that the horses could get along. It was now
  quite dark and the mob had spread even into this usually deserted
  quarter.</p>

  <p>A flaring glow that tinged the temple, the wharf and the deep sky itself
  with a gorgeous crimson glare, showed very plainly what the populace were
  employed in doing. The monks had set fire to the temple of Isis and the
  flames had been driven by the northwest wind down into the ship-yard, where
  they had found ample food in the enormous timber stacks and the skeletons of
  ships. Tall jets of rushing and crackling sparks were thrown skywards to
  mingle with the paler stars. Porphyrius could see what danger his house was
  in; but thanks to the old steward's foresight and the indefatigable diligence
  of the slaves, it escaped the conflagration.</p>

  <p>The two brothers, meanwhile, had left the mob far behind them. Demetrius
  was not alone, and as soon as he had introduced Marcus to his companion, an
  abbot of friendly mien, the monk warmly expressed his pleasure at meeting
  another son of Apelles, to whom he had once owed his life. Demetrius then
  told his brother what his adventures had been during the last few hours, and
  where he had met this worthy Father.</p>

  <p>While taking Dada down into the arena to join Marcus, he had caught sight
  of Anubis, the Egyptian slave who had been his father's companion in his last
  memorable journey to Syria, and who, since the death of Apelles, had totally
  disappeared, the countryman had instantly followed him, seized him&mdash;not
  without a struggle and some little danger&mdash;and then had him led off by
  the city-guard to the prison by the Prefect's house. Once secured he had been
  induced to speak, and his narrative proved beyond a doubt that Apelles had
  perished in a skirmish with the Saracens; the Egyptian slave had only taken
  advantage of his master's death to make off with the money he had with him.
  He had found his way to Crete, where he had purchased a plot of ground with
  his plunder; but then, craving to see his wife and children once more, he had
  come back to fetch them away to his new home. Finally, to confirm the truth
  of his story, which&mdash;clearing him apparently of the murder of his
  master&mdash;did not invite implicit belief, he told Demetrius that he had
  seen in Alexandria, only the day before, a recluse who had been present when
  Apelles fell, and Demetrius had at once set out to find this monk, enquiring
  among those who had swarmed into the city. He had very soon been successful;
  Kosnias, who since then had been elected abbot of the monastery to which he
  belonged, now again told Marcus the story of his father's heroic courage in
  the struggle with the freebooters who had attacked his caravan. Apelles, he
  said, had saved his life and that of two other anchorites, one of whom was in
  Alexandria at this very time. They were travelling from Hebron to Aila, a
  party of seven, and had placed themselves under the protection of the
  Alexandrian merchant's escort; everything had gone well till the infidel
  Saracens had fallen upon them in the high land south of Petra. Four of the
  monks had been butchered out of hand; but Apelles, with a few of the more
  resolute spirits in the company, had fought the heathen with the valor of a
  lion. He, Kosmas, and his two surviving comrades had effected their escape,
  while Apelles engaged the foe; but from a rocky height which they climbed in
  their flight they saw him fall, and from that hour they had always mentioned
  him in their prayers. It would be an unspeakable satisfaction to him to do
  his utmost to procure for such a man as Apelles the rank he deserved in the
  list of martyrs for the Faith.</p>

  <p>Marcus, only too happy, wanted to hurry away at once to his mother and
  tell her what he had heard, but Demetrius detained him. The Bishop-he told
  his brother&mdash;had desired his immediate presence, to be congratulated on
  his victory; his first duty was to obey that mandate, and he should at once
  avail himself of its favorable opportunity to obtain for his deceased parent
  the honor he had earned.</p>

  <p>It rather startled Marcus to find his brother taking its interest in a
  matter which, so lately, he had vehemently opposed; however, he proceeded at
  once to the episcopal palace, accompanied by the abbot, and half an hour
  later Demetrius, who had awaited his return, met him coming out with
  sparkling eyes. The Prelate, he said, had received him very graciously, had
  thanked him for his prowess and had bid him crave a reward. He at once had
  spoken of his father, and called the recluse to witness to the facts. The
  Bishop had listened his story, and had ended by declaring himself quite
  willing to put the name of Apelles on the list of the Syrian martyrs.
  Theophilus had been most unwilling hitherto to reject the petitions of so
  good and illustrious Christian as Mary; and now, after such ample testimony
  as to the manner of her husband's death, it was with sincere satisfaction
  that he bestowed this high mark of honor on the Christian victor and his
  admirable mother. "So now," added the young man, "I shall fly home, and how
  happy my mother will be..."</p>

  <p>But Demetrius would not allow him to finish his sentence. He laid his hand
  on the young man's shoulder saying: "Patience, my dear fellow, patience! You
  must stay with me for the present, and not go to your mother till I have
  settled everything that is necessary. Do not contradict me I entreat you,
  unless you want to deprive me of the happiness of remedying an injustice to
  your pretty Dada. What you most desire for yourself and her is your mother's
  blessing&mdash;and do you think that will be easy to obtain? Far from it,
  lad! But I can manage it for you; and I will, too, if only you will do as I
  bid you, and if the old Heathen's niece can be induced to be baptized..."</p>

  <p>"She is a Christian already!" exclaimed Marcus eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Well then, she can be yours to-morrow," Demetrius went on calmly, "if you
  listen to the advice of your older and wiser brother. It cannot be very hard
  upon you, for you must own that if I had not fought it out with
  Anubis&mdash;and the rascal bit all he could reach like a trapped
  fox&mdash;if I had not got him locked up and almost run my legs off in
  hunting down the worthy abbot, our father would never have enjoyed the
  promotion which he is at last to obtain. Who would ever have believed that I
  should get any satisfaction out of this 'Crown of Martyrdom'? By the gods! It
  is by no means impossible, and I hope the manes of the deceased will forgive
  me for your sake. But it is getting late, so only one thing more: for my own
  share of the business all I claim is my right to tell your mother myself of
  all that has occurred; you, on your part, must go at once to Eusebius and beg
  him to receive Dada in his house. If he consents&mdash;and he certainly
  will&mdash;take him with you to our uncle Porphyrius and wait there till I
  come; then, if all goes well, I will take you and Dada to your
  mother&mdash;or, if not, we will go with Eusebius."</p>

  <p>"Dada to my mother!" cried Marcus. "But what will she..."</p>

  <p>"She will receive her as a daughter," interrupted his brother, "if you
  hold your tongue about the whole business till I give you leave to
  speak.&mdash;There, the tall gate-keeper is closing the episcopal palace, so
  nothing more can come out of there to-night. You are a lucky
  fellow&mdash;well good-bye till we meet again; I am in a hurry."</p>

  <p>The farmer went off, leaving Marcus with a thousand questions still
  unasked. However, the young man did his bidding and went, hopeful though not
  altogether free from doubts, to find his old tutor and friend.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch27"
     id="ch27">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">While Marcus carried out his brother's instructions Dada was
  expecting him and Eusebius with the greatest impatience. Gorgo had charged
  her waiting- woman to conduct the girl into the music-room and to tell her
  that she would join her there if her father was in such a state as to allow
  of it. Some refreshments were brought in to her, all delicate and tempting
  enough; but Dada would not touch them, for she fancied that the merchant's
  daughter was avoiding her intentionally, and her heart ached with a sense of
  bereavement and loneliness. To distract her thoughts she wandered round the
  room, looking at the works of art that stood against the walls, feeling the
  stuffs with which the cushions were covered and striking a lute which was
  leaning against the pedestal of a Muse. She only played a few chords, but
  they sufficed to call up a whole train of memories; she sank on a divan in
  the darkest corner she could find in the brilliantly-lighted room, and gave
  herself up to reviewing the many events of the last few days. It was all so
  bright, so delightful, that it hardly seemed real, and her hopes were so
  radiantly happy that for a moment she trembled to think of their
  fulfilment&mdash;but only for a moment; her young soul was full of confidence
  and elation, and if a doubt weighed it down for an instant it was soon cast
  off and her spirit rose with bold expectancy.</p>

  <p>Her heart overflowed with happiness and thankfulness as she thought of
  Marcus and his love for her; her fancy painted the future always by his side,
  and though her annoyance at Gorgo's continued absence, and her dread of her
  lover's mother slightly clouded her gladness, the sense of peace and rapture
  constantly came triumphantly to the front. She forgot time as it sped, till
  at length Gorgo made her appearance.</p>

  <p>She had not deliberately kept out of the little singer's way; on the
  contrary, she had been detained by her father, for not till now had she dared
  to tell him that his mother, the beloved mistress of his house, was no more.
  In the Serapeum she had not mentioned it, by the physician's orders; and now,
  in addition, through the indiscretion of a friend, he had received some
  terrible tidings which had already been known for some hours in the city and
  which dealt him a serious blow. His two sons were in Thessalonica, and a
  ship, just arrived from thence, brought the news-only too well substantiated,
  that fifteen thousand of the inhabitants of that town had been treacherously
  assassinated in the Circus there.</p>

  <p>This hideous massacre had been carried out by the Imperial troops at
  Caesar's command, the wretched citizens having been bidden to witness the
  races and then ruthlessly butchered. A general of the Imperial army&mdash;a
  Goth named Botheric&mdash;had been killed by the mob, and the Emperor had
  thus avenged his death.</p>

  <p>Porphyrius knew only too well that his sons would never have been absent
  from any races or games. They certainly must have been among the spectators
  and have fallen victims to the sword of the slaughterer. His mother and two
  noble sons were snatched from him in a day; and he would again have had
  recourse to poison as a refuge from all, if a dim ray of hope had not
  permitted him to believe in their escape. But all the same he was sunk in
  despair, and behaved as though he had nothing on earth left to live for.
  Gorgo tried to console him, encouraged his belief in her brothers' possible
  safety, reminded him that it was the duty of a philosopher to bear the
  strokes of Fate with fortitude; but he would not listen to her, and only
  varied his lamentations with bursts of rage.</p>

  <p>At last he said he wished to be alone and reminded Gorgo that she ought to
  go to Dada. His daughter obeyed, but against her will; in spite of all that
  Demetrius had said in the young girl's favor she felt a little shy of her,
  and in approaching her more closely she had something of the feeling of a
  fine lady who condescends to enter the squalid hovel of poverty. But her
  father was right: Dada was her guest and she must treat her with
  kindness.</p>

  <p>Outside the door of the music-room she dried away her tears for her
  brothers, for her emotion seemed to her too sacred to be confessed to a
  creature who boldly defied the laws laid down by custom for the conduct of
  women. From Dada's appearance she felt sure that all those lofty ideas, which
  she herself had been taught to call "moral dignity" and "a yearning for the
  highest things," must be quite foreign to this girl with whom her cousin had
  condescended to intrigue. She felt herself immeasurably her superior; but it
  would be ungenerous to allow her to see this, and she spoke very kindly; but
  Dada answered timidly and formally.</p>

  <p>"I am glad," Gorgo began, "that accident brought you in our way;" and Dada
  replied hastily: "I owe it to your father's kindness, and not to
  accident."</p>

  <p>"Yes, he is very kind," said Gorgo, ignoring Dada's indignant tone. "And
  the last few hours have brought him terrible sorrows. You have heard, no
  doubt, that he has lost his mother; you knew her&mdash;she had taken quite a
  fancy to you, I suppose you know."</p>

  <p>"Oh! forget it!" cried Dada.</p>

  <p>"She was hard to win," Gorgo went on, "but she liked you. Do you not
  believe me? You should have seen how carefully she chose the dress you have
  on at this minute, and matched the ornaments to wear with it."</p>

  <p>"Pray, pray say no more about it," Dada begged. "She is dead, and I have
  forgiven her&mdash;but she thought badly, very badly of me."</p>

  <p>"It is very bad of you to speak so," interrupted Gorgo, making no attempt
  to conceal her annoyance at the girl's reply. "She&mdash;who is
  dead&mdash;deserves more gratitude for her liberality and kindness!"</p>

  <p>Dada shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No," she said firmly. "I am grateful, even for the smallest kindness; I
  have not often met with disinterested generosity. But she had an end in
  view&mdash;I must say it once for all. She wanted to make use of me to bring
  shame on Marcus and grief on his mother. You surely must know it; for why
  should you have thought me too vile to sing with you if you did not believe
  that I was a good-for-nothing hussy, and quite ready to do your dead
  grandmother's bidding? Everybody, of course, looked down upon us all and
  thought we must be wicked because we were singers; but you knew better; you
  made a distinction; for you invited Agne to come to your house and sing with
  you.&mdash;No, unless you wish to insult me, say no more about my owing the
  dead lady a debt of gratitude!"</p>

  <p>Gorgo's eyes fell; but presently she looked up again and said:</p>

  <p>"You do not know what that poor soul had suffered. Mary, her son's widow,
  had been very cruel to her, had done her injuries she could never
  forgive&mdash;so perhaps you are right in your notion; but all the same, my
  grandmother had a great liking for you&mdash;and after all her wish is
  fulfilled, for Marcus has found you and he loves you, too, if I am not
  mistaken!"</p>

  <p>"If you are not mistaken!" retorted Dada. "The gods forefend!&mdash;Yes,
  we have found each other, we love each other. Why should I conceal it?"</p>

  <p>"And Mary, his mother&mdash;what has she to say to it?" asked Gorgo.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," replied Dada abashed.</p>

  <p>"But she is his mother, you know!" cried Gorgo severely. "And he will
  never&mdash;never&mdash;marry against her will. He depends on her for all
  that he has in the world."</p>

  <p>"Then let her keep it!" exclaimed Dada. "The smaller and humbler the home
  he gives me the better I shall like it. I want his love and nothing more.
  All&mdash;all he desires of me is right and good; he is not like other men;
  he does not care for nothing but my pretty face. I will do whatever he bids
  me in perfect confidence; and what he thinks about me you may judge for
  yourself, for he is going to put me in the care of his tutor Eusebius."</p>

  <p>"Then you have accepted his creed?" asked Gorgo. "Certainly I have," said
  Dada.</p>

  <p>"I am glad of that for his sake," said the merchant's daughter. "And if
  the Christians only did what their preachers enjoin on them one might be glad
  to become one. But they make a riot and destroy everything that is fine and
  beautiful. What have you to say to that&mdash;you, who were brought up by
  Karnis, a true votary of the Muses?"</p>

  <p>"I?" said Dada. "There are bad men everywhere, and when they rise to
  destroy what is beautiful I am very sorry. But we can love it and cherish it
  all the same."</p>

  <p>"You are happy indeed if you can shut your eyes at the dictates of your
  heart!" retorted Gorgo, but she sighed. "Happy are they and much to be envied
  who can compel their judgment to silence when it is grief to hear its voice.
  I&mdash;I who have been taught to think, cannot abandon my judgment; it
  builds up a barrier between me and the happiness that beckons me. And yet, so
  long as truth remains the highest aim of man, I will bless the faculty of
  seeking it with all the powers of my mind. My betrothed husband, like yours,
  is a Christian; and I would I could accept his creed as unflinchingly as you;
  but it is not in my nature to leap into a pool when I know that it is full of
  currents and whirlpools.&mdash;However, the present question has to do with
  you and not with me. Marcus, no doubt, will be happy to have won you; but if
  he does not succeed in gaining his mother's consent he will not continue
  happy you may rely upon it. I know these Christians! they cannot conceive of
  any possible joy in married life without their parents' blessing, and if
  Marcus defies his mother he will torture his conscience and lead a
  death-in-life, as though he were under some heavy load of guilt."</p>

  <p>"For all that, and all that," Dada insisted, "he can no more be happy
  without me than I can without him. I have never in my life paid court to any
  one, but I have always met with kindness. Why then should I not be able to
  win his mother's heart? I will wager anything and everything that she will
  take kindly to me, for, after all, she must be glad when she sees her son
  happy. Eusebius will speak for us and she will give its her blessing! But if
  it is not to be, if I may never be his wife honestly and in the face of the
  world, still I will not give him up, nor he me. He may deal with me as he
  will&mdash;as if he were my god and I were his slave!"</p>

  <p>"But, my poor child, do you know nothing of womanly honor and womanly
  dignity?" cried Gorgo clasping her hands. "You complain of the lot of a
  singing-girl, and the cruel prejudices of the world&mdash;and what are you
  saying? Let me have my way, you would say, or I scorn your morality?"</p>

  <p>"Scorn!" exclaimed Dada firing up. "Do you say I scorn morality? No,
  indeed no. I am an insignificant little person; there is nothing proud or
  great about me, and as I know it full well I am quite humble; in all my life
  I never dared to think of scorn, even of a child. But here, in my heart,
  something was awoke to life&mdash;through Marcus, only through
  him&mdash;something that makes me strong; and when I see custom and tradition
  in league against me because I am a singer, when they combine to keep me out
  of what I have a right to have&mdash;well, within these few hours I have
  found the spirit to defend myself, to the death if need be! What you call
  womanly honor I have been taught to hold as sacred as you yourself, and I
  have kept it as untainted as any girl living. Not that I meant to do anything
  grand, but you have no idea of what it is when every man thinks he has a
  right to oppress and insult a girl and try to entrap her. You, and others
  like you, know nothing of small things, for you are sheltered by walls and
  privileges. We are every man's game, while they approach you as humbly as if
  you were goddesses.&mdash;Besides! It is not only what I have heard from
  Karnis, who knows the world and fine folks like you; I have seen it for
  myself at Rome, in the senators' houses, where there were plenty of young
  lords and great men's daughters&mdash;for I have not gone through life with
  my eyes shut; with you love is like lukewarm water in a bath, but it catches
  us like fire. Sappho of Lesbos flung herself from the Leucadian rock because
  Phaon flouted her, and if I could save Marcus from any calamity by doing the
  same, I would follow her example.&mdash;You have a lover, too; but your
  feeling for him, with all the 'intellect' and 'reflections,' and 'thought' of
  which you spoke, cannot be the right one. There is no but or if in my love at
  any rate; and yet, for all that, my heart aches so sorely and beats so
  wildly, I will wait patiently with Eusebius and submit to whatever I am
  bidden.&mdash;And in spite of it all you condemn me unheard, for you... But
  why do you stand and look like that? You look just like you did that time
  when I heard you sing. By all the Muses! but you, too, like us, have some
  fire in your veins, you are not one of the lukewarm sort; you are an artist,
  and a better one than I; and if you ever should feel the right love,
  then&mdash;then take care lest you break loose from propriety and
  custom&mdash;or whatever name you give to the sacred powers that subdue
  passion&mdash;even more wildly than I&mdash;who am an honest girl, and mean
  to remain so, for all the fire and flame in my breast!"</p>

  <p>Gorgo remembered the hour in which she had, in fact, proffered to the man
  of her choice as a free gift, the love which, by every canon of propriety,
  she ought only to have granted to his urgent wooing. She blushed and her eyes
  fell before the humble little singer; but while she was considering what
  answer she could make men's steps were heard approaching, and presently
  Eusebius and Marcus entered the room, followed by Gorgo's lover. Constantine
  was in deep dejection, for one of his brothers had lost his life in the
  burning of his father's ship-yard, and as compared with this grief, the
  destruction of the timber stores which constituted the chief part of his
  wealth scarcely counted as a calamity.</p>

  <p>Gorgo had met him with a doubtful and embarrassed air; but when she learnt
  of the blow that had fallen on him and his parents, she clung to him
  caressingly and tried to comfort him. The others sympathized deeply with his
  sorrow; but soon it was Dada's turn to weep, for Eusebius brought the news of
  her foster-parent's death in the fight at the Serapeum, and of Orpheus being
  severely wounded.</p>

  <p>The cheerful music-room was a scene of woe till Demetrius came to conduct
  his brother and Dada to the widow Mary who was expecting them. He had arrived
  in a chariot, for he declared his legs would no longer carry him. "Men," said
  he, "are like horses. A swift saddle-horse is soon tired when it is driven in
  harness and a heavy cart-horse when it is made to gallop. His hoofs were
  spoilt for city pavements, and scheming, struggling and running about the
  streets were too much for his country brains and wore him out, as trotting
  under a saddle would weary a plough-horse. He thanked the gods that this day
  was over. He would not be rested enough till to-morrow to be really glad of
  all his success."&mdash;But in spite of this assertion he was radiant with
  overflowing satisfaction, and that in itself cheered the mourners whom he
  tried to encourage. When he said they must be going, Gorgo kissed the little
  singer; indeed, as soon as she saw how deeply she was grieved, shedding
  bitter but silent tears, she had hastened to take her in her arms and comfort
  her like a sister.</p>

  <p>Constantine, Gorgo and old Eusebius were left together, and the young girl
  was longing to unburden her over-full heart. She had agreed to her lover's
  request that she would at once accompany him to see his sorrowing parents;
  still, she could not appear before the old Christian couple and crave their
  blessing in her present mood. Recent events had embittered her happy belief
  in the creed into which she had thrown herself, and much as it pained her to
  add a drop to Constantine's cup of sorrow, duty and honesty commanded that
  she should show him the secrets of her soul and the doubts and questionings
  which had begun to trouble her. The old priest's presence was a comfort to
  her; for her earnest wish was to become a Christian from conviction; as soon
  as they were alone she poured out before them all the accusations she had to
  bring against the adherents of their Faith: They had triumphed in ruining the
  creations of Art; the Temple of Isis and the ship-yard lay in ashes,
  destroyed by Christian incendiaries; their tears were not yet dry when they
  flowed afresh for the sons of Porphyrius&mdash;Christians
  themselves&mdash;who, unless some happy accident had saved them, must have
  perished with thousands of innocent sufferers&mdash;believers and infidels
  together&mdash;by the orders of the Emperor whom Constantine had always
  lauded as a wise sovereign and pious Christian, as the Defender of the Faith,
  and as a faithful disciple of the Redeemer.</p>

  <p>When, at last, she came to an end of her indictment she appealed to
  Constantine and Eusebius to defend the proceedings of their co-religionists,
  and to give her good grounds for confessing a creed which could sanction such
  ruthless deeds.</p>

  <p>Neither the Deacon nor his pupil attempted to excuse these acts; nay,
  Constantine thought they were in plain defiance of that high law of Love
  which the Christian Faith imposes on all its followers. The wicked servant,
  he declared, had committed crimes in direct opposition to the spirit and the
  letter of the Master.</p>

  <p>But this admission by no means satisfied Gorgo; she represented to the
  young Christian that a master must be judged by the deeds of his servant; she
  herself had turned from the old gods only because she felt such intense
  contempt for their worshippers; but now it had been her lot to see&mdash;the
  Deacon must pardon her for saying so&mdash;that many a Christian far outdid
  the infidels in coarse brutality and cruelty. Such an experience had filled
  her with distrust of the creed she was required to subscribe to&mdash;she was
  shaken to the very foundations of her being.</p>

  <p>Eusebius had, till now, listened in silence; but as she ended he went
  towards her, and asked her gently whether she would think it right to turn
  the fertilizing Nile from its bed and leave its shores dry, because, from
  time to time, it destroyed fields and villages in the excess of its
  overflow?"This day and its deeds of shame," he went on sadly, "are a blot on
  the pure and sublime book of the History of our Faith, and every true
  Christian must bitterly bewail the excesses of a frenzied mob. The Church
  must no less condemn Caesar's sanguinary vengeance; it casts a shade on his
  honor and his fair name, and his conscience no doubt will punish him for such
  a crime. Far be it from me to defend deeds which nothing can justify..."</p>

  <p>But Gorgo interrupted him. "All this," she said, "does not alter the fact
  that such crimes are just as possible and as frequent with you, as with those
  whom I am expected to give up, and who ..."</p>

  <p>"But it is not merely on account of their ill deeds that you are giving
  them up, Gorgo," Constantine broke in. "Confess, dear girl, that your wrath
  makes you unjust to yourself and your own heart. It was not out of aversion
  for the ruthless and base adherents of the old gods but&mdash;as I hope and
  believe&mdash;out of love for me that you consented to adopt my
  faith&mdash;our faith."</p>

  <p>"True, true," she exclaimed, coloring as she remembered the doubts Dada
  had cast on the truth of her love.</p>

  <p>"True, out of love for you&mdash;love of Love and of peace, I consented to
  become a Christian. But with regard to the deeds committed by your followers,
  tell me yourself&mdash;and I appeal to you reverend Father&mdash;what
  inspired them: Love or Hate."</p>

  <p>"Hate!" said Constantine gloomily; and Eusebius added sorrowfully</p>

  <p>"In these dark days our Faith is seen under an aspect that by no means
  fairly represents its true nature, noble lady; trust my words! Have you not
  yourself seen, even in your short life, that what is highest and greatest can
  in its excess, be all that is most hideous? A noble pride, if not kept within
  bounds, becomes overweening ambition; the lovely grace of humility
  degenerates into an indolent sacrifice of opinion and will; high-hearted
  enterprise into a mad chase after fortune, in which we ride down everything
  that comes in the way of success. What is nobler than a mother's love, but
  when she fights for her child she becomes a raving Megaera. In the same way
  the Faith&mdash;the consoler of hearts&mdash;turns to a raging wild-beast
  when it stoops to become religious partisanship. If you would really
  understand Christianity you must look neither down to the deluded masses, and
  those ambitious worldlings who only use it as a means to an end by inflaming
  their baser passions, nor up to the throne, where power translates the
  impulse of a disastrous moment into sinister deeds. If you want to know what
  true and pure Christianity is, look into our homes, look at the family life
  of our fellow believers. I know them well, for my humble functions lead me
  into daily and hourly intercourse with them. Look to them if you purpose to
  give your hand to a Christian and make your home with him. There, my child,
  you will see all the blessings of the Saviour's teaching, love and soberness,
  pitifulness to the poor and a real heart-felt eagerness to forgive injuries.
  I have seen a Christian bestow his last crust on his hapless foe, on the
  enemy of his house, on the Heathen or the Jew, because they, too, are men,
  because our neighbor's woes should be as our own&mdash;I have seen them taken
  in and cherished as though they were fellow-Christians.&mdash;There you will
  find a striving after all that is good, a never-fading hope in better days to
  come, even under the worst afflictions; and when death requires the sacrifice
  of all that is dearest, or swoops down on life itself, a firm assurance of
  the forgiveness of sins through Christ. Believe me, mistress, there is no
  home so happy as that of the Christian; for he who really apprehends the
  Saviour and understands his teaching need not mar his own joys in this life
  to the end that he may be a partaker of the bliss of the next. On the
  contrary: He who called the erring to himself, who drew little children to
  his heart, who esteemed the poor above the rich, who was a cheerful guest at
  wedding-feasts, who bid us gain interest on the spiritual talents in our
  care, who commanded us to remember Him at a social meal, who opened hearts to
  love&mdash;He longed to release the life of the humblest creature from want
  and suffering. Where love and peace reign must there not be happiness? And as
  He preached love and peace above all else, He cannot have desired that we
  should intentionally darken our lives on earth and load them with sorrow and
  miseries in order to will our share of Heaven. The soul that is full of the
  happy confidence of being one with Him and his love, is released from the
  bondage of sin and sorrow, even here below; for Jesus has taken all the sins
  and pains of the world on himself; and if Fate visits the Christian with the
  heaviest blows he bears them in silence and patience. Our Lord is Love
  itself; neither hatred nor envy are known to Him as they are to the gods of
  the Heathen; and when he afflicts us, it is as the wise and tender pastor of
  our souls, and for our good. The omniscient Lord knows his own counsel, and
  the Christian submits as a child does to a wise father whose loving kindness
  he can always trust; nay, he can even thank him for sorrow and pain as though
  they were pleasurable benefits."</p>

  <p>Gorgo shook her head.</p>

  <p>"That all sounds very beautiful and good; it is required of the Christian,
  and sometimes, no doubt, fulfilled; but the Stoa demands the same virtues of
  its disciples. You, Constantine, knew Damon the Stoic, and you will remember
  how strictly he enjoined on all that they should rise superior to pain and
  grief. And then, when his only daughter lost her sight&mdash;she was a great
  friend of mine&mdash;he behaved like one possessed. My father, too, has often
  spoken to you of philosophy as a help to contemning the discomforts of life,
  and bearing the sports of Fate with a lofty mind; and now? You should see the
  poor man, reverend Father. What good have all the teachings of the great
  master done him?"</p>

  <p>"But he has lost so much&mdash;so much!" sighed Constantine thinking of
  his own loss; and Eusebius shook his head.</p>

  <p>"In sorrow such as his, no philosophy, no mental effort can avail. The
  blows that wound the affections can only be healed by the affections, and not
  by the intellect and considerations of reason. Faith, child! Faith is the
  true Herb of Grace. The intellect is its foe; the feelings are its native
  soil where it finds constant nourishment; and however deep the bleeding wound
  of the mourner may be, Faith can heal it and reconcile the sufferer to his
  loss. You have been taught to value a fine understanding, to measure
  everything by it, to build everything on its decisions. To you the knowledge
  you have attained to by argument and inference is supreme; but the Creator
  has given us a heart as well as a brain; our affections, too, stir and grow
  in their own way, and the knowledge they can attain to, my child, is Faith.
  You love&mdash;and Love is part of your affections; and now take my advice;
  do not let that reasoning intelligence, which has nothing to do with love,
  have anything to say in the matter; cherish your love and nurture it from the
  rich stores of your heart; thus only can it thrive to beauty and
  harmony.&mdash;And this must suffice for to-day, for I have already kept the
  wounded waiting too long in the Serapeum. If you desire it, another time I
  will show you Christianity in all its depth and beauty, and your love for
  this good man will prepare the way and open your heart to my teaching. A day
  will come when you will be able to listen to the voice of your heart as
  gladly as you have hitherto obeyed the dictates of your intellect; something
  new will be born in you which you will esteem as a treasure above all you
  ever acquired by reason and thought. That day will assuredly dawn on you; for
  he whom you love has opened the path for you that leads to the gates of
  Truth; and as you seek you will not fail to find.&mdash;And so farewell. When
  you crave a teacher you have only to come to him&mdash;and I know he will not
  have long to wait."</p>

  <p>Gorgo looked thoughtfully at the old man as he went away and then went
  with Constantine to see his parents. It was in total silence that they made
  their way along the short piece of road to the house of Clemens. Lights were
  visible in the viridarium and the curtains of the doorway were drawn back; as
  they reached the threshold Constantine pointed to a bier which had been
  placed in the little court among the flower-beds; his parents were on their
  knees by the side of it.</p>

  <p>Neither he nor Gorgo ventured to disturb their wordless devotions, but
  presently the ship-master rose, drawing his fine, stalwart figure to its full
  height; then turning his kind, manly, grave face to his wife, who had also
  risen to her feet, he laid one hand on her still abundant white hair and held
  out the other which she took in hers. Mariamne dried her eyes and looked up,
  in her husband's face as he said firmly and calmly:</p>

  <p>"The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away!'She hid her face on his
  shoulder and responded sadly but fervently:</p>

  <p>"Blessed be the name of the Lord!"</p>

  <p>"Yea&mdash;Blessed!" repeated Clemens emphatically but he passed his arm
  across his eyes. "For thirty-two years hath He lent him to us; and in our
  hearts ..." and he struck his broad breast, "in here, he will never die for
  you or for me. As for the rest&mdash;and there was a deal of property of our
  own and of other folks in these wood-piles&mdash;well, in time we shall get
  over that. We may bless the Almighty for what we have left!"</p>

  <p>Gorgo felt her lover's hand grasp hers more tightly and she understood
  what he meant; she clung closer to him and whispered softly: "Yes, that is
  grand&mdash;that is the Truth."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch28"
     id="ch28">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In the great house in the Canopic street it was late ere all
  was quiet for the night. Even Demetrius, in spite of his fatigue, broke
  through his rule of "early to bed"; he felt he must see the reaping of the
  harvest he had sown for his brother.</p>

  <p>It had been no easy task to persuade Mary to accede to his importunities,
  but to his great joy he at last succeeded.</p>

  <p>He would have met with a rough dismissal if he had begun by praising Dada
  and expressing his wish to see her married to Marcus; he had gained his point
  inch by inch, very quietly; but when he had explained to her that it was in
  his hands to secure the martyr's crown for her husband she had turned
  suspicious and ironical, had made him swear that it was true, threatening him
  with punishments in this world and in the next; but he had let it all pass
  over his head, had solemnly sworn as she desired him, pledging not merely the
  salvation of his soul but his possessions in this world; till, at length,
  convinced that it really was in his power to gratify the dearest wish of her
  heart, she had yielded somewhat and altered her demeanor. Still, he had not
  spoken a word to help her through her deliberations and bewilderment, but had
  left her to fight out the hard struggle with her own soul; not without some
  malicious enjoyment but also not without anxiety, till the first decisive
  question was put to him by his stepmother.</p>

  <p>She had heard that Dada was quite resolved to be baptized, and having once
  more made sure of the fact that the girl was anxious to become a Christian,
  she next asked:</p>

  <p>"And it was Marcus who won her to the faith?"</p>

  <p>"He alone."</p>

  <p>"And you can swear that she is a pure-minded and well-conducted girl?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, with the firmest conviction."</p>

  <p>"I saw her in the arena&mdash;she is pretty, uncommonly charming
  indeed&mdash;and Marcus ...?"</p>

  <p>"He has set his heart on the girl, and I am sure that his passion is
  sincere and unselfish. On the other hand I need hardly remind you that in
  this city there are many women, even among those of the first rank, whose
  birth and origin are far more doubtful than those of your son's little
  friend, for she, at any rate, is descended from free and respectable parents.
  Her uncle's connections are among the best families in Sicily; not that we
  need trouble ourselves about that, for the wife of Philip's grandson would
  command respect even if she were only a freed-woman."</p>

  <p>"I know, I know," murmured Mary, as though all this were of minor
  importance in her eyes; and then for some little time she remained silent. At
  last she looked up and exclaimed in a voice that betrayed the struggle still
  going on in her soul:</p>

  <p>"What have I to care for but my child's happiness? In the sight of God we
  are all equal&mdash;great and small alike; and I myself am but a weak woman,
  full of defects and sins&mdash;but for all that I could have wished that the
  only son of a noble house might have chosen differently. All I can say is
  that I must look upon this marriage as a humiliation laid upon me by the
  Almighty&mdash;still, I give it my sanction and blessing, and I will do
  freely and with my whole heart if my son's bride brings as her
  marriage-portion the one thing which is the first and last aim of all my
  desires: The everlasting glory of Apelles. The martyr's crown will open the
  gates of Heaven to him&mdash;who was your father, too, Demetrius. Gain that
  and I myself will lead the singer to my son's arms."</p>

  <p>"That is a bargain!" cried Demetrius&mdash;and soon after midnight he had
  retired to rest, after seeing Mary fulfil her promise to give a parental
  blessing to the betrothed pair.</p>

  <p>A few weeks later Dada and Gorgo were both baptized, and both by the name
  of Cecilia; and then, at Mary's special entreaty, Marcus' marriage was
  solemnized with much pomp by the Bishop himself.</p>

  <p>Still, and in spite of the lavish demonstrations of more than motherly
  affection which the widow showered her daughter-in-law, Dada felt a stranger,
  and ill at ease in the great house in the Canopic way. When Demetrius, a few
  weeks after their marriage, proposed Marcus that he should undertake the
  management of family estates in Cyrenaica, she jumped at the suggestion; and
  Marcus at once decided to act upon it when his brother promised to remain
  with him for the first year or two, helping him with his advice and
  instructions.</p>

  <p>Their fears lest Mary should oppose the project, proved unfounded; for,
  though the widow declared that life would be a burden to her without her
  children, she soon acceded to her son's wishes and admitted that they were
  kind and wise. She need not fear isolation, for, as the widow of the martyred
  Apelles, she was the recognized leader of the Christian sisterhood in the
  town, and preferred working in a larger circle than that of the family. She
  always spoke with enthusiasm to her visitors of her daughter-in-law Cecilia,
  of her beauty, her piety and her gentleness; in fact, she did all she could
  to make it appear that she herself had chosen her son's wife. But she did not
  care to keep this "beloved daughter" with her in Alexandria, for the foremost
  position in every department of social life was far more certain to be
  conceded to the noble widow of a "martyred witness" in the absence of the
  pretty little converted singer.</p>

  <p>So the young couple moved to Cyrenaica, and Dada was happy in learning to
  govern her husband's large estates with prudence and good sense. The gay
  singing-girl became a capable housewife, and the idle horse-loving Marcus a
  diligent farmer. For three years Demetrius staid with them as adviser and
  superintendent; even afterwards he frequently visited them, and for months at
  a time, and he was wont to say:</p>

  <p>"In Alexandria I am heart and soul, a Heathen, but in the house with your
  Cecilia I am happy to be a Christian."</p>

  <p>Before they quitted the city a terrible blow fell on Eusebius. The sermon
  he had delivered just before the overthrow of Serapes, to soothe the excited
  multitude and guide them in the right way, had been regarded by the Bishop of
  the zealot priests, who happened to be present, as blasphemous and as
  pandering to the infidels; Theophilus, therefore, had charged his nephew
  Cyril&mdash;his successor in the see&mdash;to verify the facts and enquire
  into the deacon's orthodoxy. It thus came to light that Agne, an Arian, was
  not only living under his roof, but had been trusted by him to nurse certain
  sick persons among the orthodox; the old man was condemned by Cyril to severe
  acts of penance, but Theophilus decided that he must be deprived of his
  office in the city, where men of sterner stuff were needed, and only allowed
  the charge of souls in a country congregation.</p>

  <p>It was a cruel blow to the venerable couple to be forced to quit the house
  and the little garden where they had been happy together for half a lifetime;
  however, the change proved to be to their advantage, for Marcus invited his
  worthy teacher to be the spiritual pastor of his estates. The churches he
  built for his peasants were consecrated by Eusebius, whose mild doctrine and
  kindly influence persuaded many laborers and slaves to be baptized and to
  join his flock of disciples. But the example and amiability of their young
  mistress was even more effectual than his preaching. Men and women, slaves
  and free, all adored and respected her; to imitate her in all she did could
  only lead to honor and happiness, could only be right and good and wise. Thus
  by degrees, and without the exertion of any compulsion, the temples and
  shrines on the Martyr's inheritance were voluntarily abandoned, and fell into
  ruin and decay.</p>

  <p>It was the same on the property of Constantine, which lay at no more than
  a day's journey from that of Marcus; the two young couples were faithful
  friends and good neighbors. The estate which had come into Constantine's
  possession had belonged to Barkas, the Libyan, who, with his troops, had been
  so anxiously and vainly expected to succor the Serapeum. The State had
  confiscated his extensive and valuable lands, and the young officer, after
  retiring from the service, had purchased them with the splendid fortune left
  to Gorgo by her grandmother.</p>

  <p>The two sons of Porphyrius had, as it proved, been so happy as to escape
  in the massacre at Thessalonica; and as they were Christians and piously
  orthodox, the old man transferred to them, during his lifetime, the chief
  share of his wealth; so that henceforth he could live
  honestly&mdash;alienated from the Church and a worshipper of the old gods,
  without anxiety as to his will. The treasures of art which Constantine and
  Gorgo found in the house of Barkas they carefully preserved, though, ere
  long, few heathen were to be found even in this neighborhood which had
  formerly been the headquarters of rebellion on behalf of the old
  religion.</p>

  <p>Papias was brought up with the children of Marcus and Dada Cecilia, while
  his sister Agne, finding herself relieved of all care on his account, sought
  and found her own way through life.</p>

  <p>Orpheus, after seeing his parents killed in the fight at the Serapeum, was
  carried, sorely wounded, to the sick-house of which Eusebius was spiritual
  director. Agne had volunteered to nurse him and had watched by his couch day
  and night. Eusebius had also brought Dada and Papias to visit them, and Dada
  had promised, on behalf of Marcus, that Agne and her brother should always be
  provided for, even in the event of the good Deacon's death. The little boy
  was for the moment placed in Eusebius' care, and it was a cause of daily
  rejoicing to Agne to hear from the kind old man of all the charming qualities
  he discovered in the child who was perfectly happy with the old folks, and
  who, though he was always delighted to see his sister, was quite content to
  part from her and return home with Eusebius, or with Dada, to whole he was
  devoted.</p>

  <p>Orpheus recognized no one, neither Agne nor the child&mdash;and when
  visitors had been to see him, in his fevered ravings he would talk more
  vehemently than ever of great Apollo and other heathen divinities. Then he
  would fancy that he was still fighting in the Serapeum and butchering
  thousands of Christian foes with his own hand. Agne, whom he rarely
  recognized for a moment, would talk soothingly to him, and even try to say a
  few words about the Saviour and the life to come; but he always interrupted
  her with blasphemous exclamations, and cursed and abused her. Never had she
  gone through such anguish of soul as by his bed of suffering, and yet she
  could not help gazing at his face; and when she told herself that he must
  soon be no more, that the light of his eyes would cease to shine on hers, she
  felt as though the sun were about to be extinguished and the earth darkened
  for all time. However, his healthy vigor kept him lingering for many days and
  nights.</p>

  <p>On the last evening of his life he took Agne for a Muse, and calling to
  her to come to him seized her hand and sank back unconscious, never to move
  again. She stood there as the minutes slowly passed, waiting in agonized
  suspense till his hand should be cold in hers; and as she waited she
  overheard a dialogue between two deaconesses who were watching by a sleeping
  patient. One of them was telling the other that her sister's husband, a
  mason, had died an obdurate heathen and a bitter enemy of the Christian
  Church. Then Dorothea, his widow, had devoted herself to saving his soul; she
  left her children, abandoning them to the charity of the congregation, and
  had withdrawn to a cloister to pray in silence and unceasingly for the soul
  of her deceased husband. At first he used to appear to her in her dreams,
  with furious gestures, accompanied by centaurs and goat-footed creatures, and
  had desired her to go home to her children and leave his soil in peace, for
  that he was in very good quarters with the jolly devils; but soon after she
  had seen him again with scorched limbs, and he lead implored her to pray
  fervently for mercy on him, for that they were torturing him cruelly in
  hell.</p>

  <p>Dorothea had then retired into the desert of Kolzoum where she was still
  living in a cave, feeding on herbs, roots, and shell-fish thrown up on the
  sea-shore. She had schooled herself to do without sleep, and prayed day and
  night for her husband's soul; and she lead obtained strength never to think
  of anything but her own and her husband's salvation, and to forget her
  children completely. Her fervid devotion had at length met with full reward;
  for some little time her husband had appeared to her in a robe of shining
  light and often attended by lovely angels.</p>

  <p>Agne had not lost a word of this narrative, and when, next morning, she
  felt the cold hand of the dead youth and looked at his drawn and
  pain-stricken features, she shuddered with vague terrors: he, she thought,
  like Dorothea's husband, must have hell-torments to endure. When she
  presently found herself alone with the corpse she bent over it and kissed the
  pale lips, and swore to herself that she would save his soul.</p>

  <p>That same evening she went back to Eusebius and told him of her wish to
  withdraw to the desert of Koizoum and become a recluse. The old man besought
  her to remain with him, to take charge of her little brother, and not to
  abandon him and his old wife; for that it was a no less lovely Christian duty
  to be compassionate and helpful, and cherish the feeble in their old age. His
  wife added her entreaties and tears; but a sudden chill had gripped Agne's
  heart; dry-eyed and rigid she resisted their prayers, and took leave of her
  benefactors and of Papias. Bare-foot and begging her way, she started for the
  south-east and reached the shores of the Red Sea. There she found the
  stonemason's widow, emaciated and haggard, with matted hair, evidently dying.
  Agne remained with her, closed her eyes, and then lived on as Dorothea had
  lived, in the same cave, till the fame of her sanctity spread far beyond the
  boundaries of Egypt.</p>

  <p>When Papias had grown to man's estate and was installed as steward to
  Demetrius, he sought his sister many times and tried to persuade her to live
  with him in his new home; but she never would consent to quit her solitary
  cell. She would not have exchanged it for a king's palace; for Orpheus
  appeared to her in nightly visions, radiant with the glories of Heaven; and
  time was passing and the hour drawing near when she might hope to be with him
  once more.</p>

  <p>The widow Mary, in her later years, made many pilgrimages to holy places
  and saintly persons, and among others to Agne, the recluse; but she would
  never be induced to visit Cyrenaica, whither she was frequently invited by
  her children and grandchildren; some more powerful excitant was needed to
  prompt her to face the discomforts of a journey.</p>

  <p>The old Heathen cults had completely vanished from the Greek capital long
  before her death. With it died the splendor and the power of the second city
  in the world; and of all the glories of the city of Serapis nothing now
  remains but a mighty column* towering to the skies, the last surviving
  fragment of the beautiful temple of the sovereign-god whose fall marked so
  momentous an epoch in the life of the human race. But, like this pillar,
  outward Beauty&mdash;the sense of form that characterized the heathen
  mind&mdash;has survived through the ages. We can gaze up at the one and the
  other, and wherever the living Truth&mdash;the Spirit of
  Christianity&mdash;has informed and penetrated that form of Beauty, the
  highest hopes of old Eusebius have been realized. Their union is solemnized
  in Christian Art.</p><br>
