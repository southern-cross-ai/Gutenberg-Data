  <h2><a id="part1"

  <h3>BY G.K. CHESTERTON</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was merely the accident of his hour, the call of his age,
  which made Tennyson a philosophic poet. He was naturally not only a pure
  lover of beauty, but a pure lover of beauty in a much more peculiar and
  distinguished sense even than a man like Keats, or a man like Robert Bridges.
  He gave us scenes of Nature that cannot easily be surpassed, but he chose
  them like a landscape painter rather than like a religious poet.</p>

  <p><a id="pic02"
     name="pic02"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300301h-images/Tennyson02.jpg"

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption"><a href="#bn1">Click here for more information</a></p>
  </div>

  <p>Above all, he exhibited his abstract love of the beautiful in one most
  personal and characteristic fact. He was never so successful or so triumphant
  as when he was describing not Nature, but art. He could describe a statue as
  Shelley could describe a cloud. He was at his very best in describing
  buildings, in their blending of aspiration and exactitude.</p>

  <p><a id="pic03"
     name="pic03"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300301h-images/Tennyson03.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>He found to perfection the harmony between the rhythmic recurrences of
  poetry and the rhythmic recurrences of architecture. His description, for
  example, of the Palace of Art is a thing entirely victorious and unique. The
  whole edifice, as described, rises as lightly as a lyric, it is full of the
  surge of the hunger for beauty; and yet a man might almost build upon the
  description as upon the plans of an architect or the instructions of a
  speculative builder. Such a lover of beauty was Tennyson, a lover of beauty
  most especially where it is most to be found, in the works of man. He loved
  beauty in its completeness, as we find it in art, not in its more glorious
  incompleteness as we find it in Nature.</p>

  <p><a id="pic04"
     name="pic04"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300301h-images/Tennyson04.jpg"

    <p class="caption"><a href="#bn2">Click here for more information</a></p>
  </div>

  <p>There is, perhaps, more loveliness in Nature than in art, but there are
  not so many lovely things. The loveliness is broken to pieces and scattered:
  the almond tree in blossom will have a mob of nameless insects at its root,
  and the most perfect cell in the great forest-house is likely enough to smell
  like a sewer. Tennyson loved beauty more in its collected form in art,
  poetry, and sculpture; like his own "Lady of Shalott," it was his office to
  look rather at the mirror than at the object. He was an artist, as it were,
  at two removes: he was a splendid imitator of the splendid imitations. It is
  true that his natural history was exquisitely exact, but natural history and
  natural religion are things that can be, under certain circumstances, more
  unnatural than anything in the world.</p>

  <p>In reading Tennyson's natural descriptions we never seem to be in physical
  contact with the earth. We learn nothing of the coarse good-temper and rank
  energy of life. We see the whole scene accurately, but we see it through
  glass. In Tennyson's works we see Nature indeed, and hear Nature, but we do
  not smell it. But this poet of beauty and a certain magnificent idleness
  lived at a time when all men had to wrestle and decide. It is not easy for
  any person who lives in our time, when the dust has settled and the spiritual
  perspective has been restored, to realise what the entrance of the idea of
  evolution meant for the men of those days. To us it is a discovery of another
  link in a chain which, however far we follow it, still stretches back into a
  divine mystery.</p>

  <p><a id="pic06"
     name="pic06"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

    <p class="caption"><a href="#bn3">Click here for more information</a></p>
  </div>

  <p>To many of the men of that time it would appear from their writings that
  it was the heart-breaking and desolating discovery of the end and origin of
  the chain. To them had happened the most black and hopeless catastrophe
  conceivable to human nature; they had found a logical explanation of all
  things. To them it seemed that an Ape had suddenly risen to gigantic stature
  and destroyed the seven heavens. It is difficult, no doubt, for us in
  somewhat subtler days to understand how anybody could suppose that the origin
  of species had anything to do with the origin of being. To us it appears that
  to tell a man who asks who made his mind that evolution made it, is like
  telling a man who asks who rolled a cab-wheel over his leg that revolution
  rolled it.</p>

  <p>To state the process is scarcely to state the agent. But the position of
  those who regarded the opening of the "Descent of Man" as the opening of one
  of the seals of the last days, is a great deal sounder than people have
  generally allowed.</p>

  <p>It has been constantly supposed that they were angry with Darwinism
  because it appeared to do something or other to the Book of Genesis; but this
  was a pretext or a fancy. They fundamentally rebelled against Darwinism, not
  because they had a fear that it would affect Scripture, but because they had
  a fear, not altogether unreasonable or ill-founded, that it would affect
  morality. Man had been engaged, through innumerable ages, in a struggle with
  sin.</p>

  <p>The evil within him was as strong as he could cope with&mdash;it was as
  powerful as a cannonade and as enchanting as a song. But in this struggle he
  had always had Nature on his side. He might be polluted and agonised, but the
  flowers were innocent and the hills were strong. All the armoury of life, the
  spears of the pinewood and the batteries of the lightning, went into battle
  beside him. Tennyson lived in the hour when, to all mortal appearance, the
  whole of the physical world deserted to the devil.</p>

  <p>The universe, governed by violence and death, left man to fight alone,
  with a handful of myths and memories. Men had now to wander in polluted
  fields and lift up their eyes to abominable hills. They had to arm themselves
  against the cruelty of flowers and the crimes of the grass.</p>

  <p>The first honour, surely, is to those who did not faint in the face of
  that confounding cosmic betrayal; to those who sought and found a new
  vantage-ground for the army of Virtue. Of these was Tennyson, and it is
  surely the more to his honour, since he was the idle lover of beauty of whom
  we have spoken. He felt that the time called him to be an interpreter.
  Perhaps he might even have been something more of a poet if he had not sought
  to be something more than a poet. He might have written a more perfect
  Arthurian epic if his heart had been as much buried in prehistoric sepulchres
  as the heart of Mr. W. B. Yeats. He might have made more of such poems as
  "The Golden Year" if his mind had been as clean of metaphysics and as full of
  a poetic rusticity as the mind of William Morris. He might have been a
  greater poet if he had been less a man of his dubious and rambling age. But
  there are some things that are greater than greatness; there are some things
  that no man with blood in his body would sell for the throne of Dante, and
  one of them is to fire the feeblest shot in a war that really awaits
  decision, or carry the meanest musket in an army that is really marching by.
  Tennyson may even have forfeited immortality: but he and the men of his age
  were more than immortal; they were alive.</p>

  <p>Tennyson had not a special talent for being a philosophic poet, but he had
  a special vocation for being a philosophic poet. This may seem a
  contradiction, but it is only because all the Latin or Greek words we use
  tend endlessly to lose their meaning.</p>

  <p class="first"><a href="#bn6"
     id="pic12"

        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>A vocation is supposed to mean merely a taste or faculty, just as economy
  is held to mean merely the act of saving. Economy means the management of a
  house or community. If a man starves his best horse, or causes his best
  workman to strike for more pay, he is not merely unwise, he is uneconomical.
  So it is with a vocation. If this country were suddenly invaded by some huge
  alien and conquering population, we should all be called to become soldiers.
  We should not think in that time that we were sacrificing our unfinished work
  on Cattle-Feeding or our hobby of fretwork, our brilliant career at the Bar
  or our taste for painting in water-colours. We should all have a call to
  arms. We should, however, by no means agree that we all had a vocation for
  arms. Yet a vocation is only the Latin for a call.</p>

  <p>In a celebrated passage in "Maud," Tennyson praised the moral effects of
  war, and declared that some great conflict might call out the greatness even
  of the pacific swindlers and sweaters whom he saw around him in the
  Commercial age. He dreamed, he said, that if&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">...The battle-bolt sang from the three-decker out on the
  foam,<br>
  Many a smooth-faced, snub-nosed rogue would leap from his counter or
  till,<br>
  And strike, were it but with his cheating yard-wand, home.</p>

  <p>Tennyson lived in the time of a conflict more crucial and frightful than
  any European struggle, the conflict between the apparent artificiality of
  morals and the apparent immorality of science. A ship more symbolic and
  menacing than any foreign three-decker hove in sight in that time&mdash;the
  great, gory pirate-ship of Nature, challenging all the civilisations of the
  world. And his supreme honour is this, that he behaved like his own imaginary
  snub-nosed rogue.</p>

  <p>His honour is that in that hour he despised the flowers and embroideries
  of Keats as the counter-jumper might despise his tapes and cottons. He was by
  nature a hedonistic and pastoral poet, but he leapt from his poetic counter
  and till and struck, were it but with his gimcrack mandolin, home.</p>

  <p>Tennyson's influence on poetry may, for a time, be modified. This is the
  fate of every man who throws himself into his own age, catches the echo of
  its temporary phrases, is kept busy in battling with its temporary delusions.
  There are many men whom history has for a time forgotten to whom it owes more
  than it could count. But if Tennyson is extinguished it will be with the most
  glorious extinction. There are two ways in which a man may
  vanish&mdash;through being thoroughly conquered or through being thoroughly
  the Conqueror. In the main the great Broad Church philosophy which Tennyson
  uttered has been adopted by every one. This will make against his fame. For a
  man may vanish as Chaos vanished in the face of creation, or he may vanish as
  God vanished in filling all things with that created life.</p>

  <p class="first">IT is easy to exaggerate, and equally easy to underrate, the
  influence of Tennyson on his age as an intellectual force. It will be
  exaggerated if we regard him as a great original mind, a proclaimer or
  revealer of novel truth. It will be underrated if we overlook the great part
  reserved for him who reveals, not new truth to the age, but the age to
  itself, by presenting it with a miniature of its own highest, and frequently
  unconscious, tendencies and aspirations. Not Dryden or Pope were more
  intimately associated with their respective ages than Tennyson with that
  brilliant period to which we now look back as the age of Victoria. His figure
  cannot, indeed, be so dominant as theirs.</p>

  <p>The Victorian era was far more affluent in literary genius than the
  periods of Dryden and Pope; and Tennyson appears as but one of a splendid
  group, some of whom surpass him in native force of mind and intellectual
  endowment. But when we measure these illustrious men with the spirit of their
  age, we perceive that&mdash;with the exception of Dickens, who paints the
  manners rather than the mind of the time, and Macaulay, who reproduces its
  average but not its higher mood&mdash;there is something as it were sectarian
  in them which prevents their being accepted as representatives of their epoch
  in the fullest sense.</p>

  <p>In some instances, such as Carlyle and Browning and Thackeray, the cause
  may be an exceptional originality verging upon eccentricity; in others, like
  George Eliot, it may be allegiance to some particular scheme of thought; in
  others, like Ruskin and Matthew Arnold, exclusive devotion to some particular
  mission. In Tennyson, and in him alone, we find the man who cannot be
  identified with any one of the many tendencies of the age, but has affinities
  with all. Ask for the composition which of all contemporary compositions
  bears the Victorian stamp most unmistakably, which tells us most respecting
  the age's thoughts respecting itself, and there will be little hesitation in
  naming "Locksley Hall."</p>

  <p>Tennyson returns to his times what he has received from them, but in an
  exquisitely embellished and purified condition; he is the mirror in which the
  age contemplates all that is best in itself. Matthew Arnold would perhaps not
  have been wrong in declining to recognise Tennyson as "a great and powerful
  spirit" if "power" had been the indispensable condition of "greatness"; but
  he forgot that the receptive poet may be as potent as the creative. His cavil
  might with equal propriety have been aimed at Virgil. In truth, Tennyson's
  fame rests upon a securer basis than that of some greater poets, for
  acquaintance with him will always be indispensable to the history of thought
  and culture in England.</p>

  <p>What George Eliot and Anthony Trollope are for the manners of the period,
  he is for its mind: all the ideas which in his day chiefly moved the elect
  spirits of English society are to be found in him, clothed in the most
  exquisite language, and embodied in the most consummate form. That they did
  not originate with him is of no consequence whatever. We cannot consider him,
  regarded merely as a poet, as quite upon the level of his great immediate
  predecessors; but the total disappearance of any of these, except Wordsworth,
  would leave a less painful blank in our intellectual history than the
  disappearance of Tennyson.</p>

  <p>Beginning, even in his crudest attempts, with a manner distinctly his own,
  he attained a style which could be mistaken for that of no predecessor
  (though most curiously anticipated by a few blank-verse lines of William
  Blake), and which no imitator has been able to rival. What is most truly
  remarkable is that while much of his poetry is perhaps the most artificial in
  construction of any in our language, and much again wears the aspect of
  bird-like spontaneity, these contrasted manners evidently proceed from the
  same writer, and no one would think of ascribing them to different hands. As
  a master of blank verse Tennyson, though perhaps not fully attaining the
  sweetness of Coleridge or the occasional grandeur of Wordsworth and Shelley,
  is upon the whole the third in our language after Shakespeare and Milton,
  and, unlike Shakespeare and Milton, he has made it difficult for his
  successors to write blank verse after him.</p>

  <p>Tennyson is essentially a composite poet. Dryden's famous verses, grand in
  expression, but questionable in their application to Milton, are perfectly
  applicable to him; save that, in making him, Nature did not combine two
  poets, but many.</p>

  <p>This is a common phenomenon at the close of a great epoch; it is almost
  peculiar to Tennyson's age that it should then have heralded the appearance
  of a new era; and that, simultaneously with the inheritor of the past,
  perhaps the most original and self-sufficing of all poets should have
  appeared in the person of Robert Browning. A comparison between these
  illustrious writers would lead us too far; we have already implied that
  Tennyson occupies the more conspicuous place in literary history on account
  of his representative character.</p>

  <p>The first important recognition of Tennyson's genius came from Stuart
  Mill, who, partly perhaps under the guidance of Mrs. Taylor, evinced about
  1835 a remarkable insight into Shelley and Browning as well as Tennyson. In
  the course of his observations he declared that all that Tennyson needed to
  be a great poet was a system of philosophy, to which Time would certainly
  conduct him.</p>

  <p>If he only meant that Tennyson needed "the years that bring the
  philosophic mind," the observation was entirely just; if he expected the poet
  either to evolve a system of philosophy for himself or to fall under the sway
  of some great thinker, he was mistaken.</p>

  <p>Had Tennyson done either he might have been a very great and very
  interesting poet; but he could not have been the poet of his age: for the
  temper of the time, when it was not violently partisan, was liberally
  eclectic. There was no one great leading idea, such as that of evolution in
  the last quarter of last century, so ample and so characteristic of the age
  that a poet might become its disciple without yielding to party what was
  meant for mankind.</p>

  <p>Two chief currents of thought there were; but they were antagonistic, even
  though Mr. Gladstone has proved that a very exceptional mind might find room
  for both. Nothing was more characteristic of the age than the reaction
  towards mediaeval ideas, headed by Newman, except the rival and seemingly
  incompatible gospel of "the railway and the steamship" and all their
  corollaries.</p>

         alt="Illustration"

  </div><br>

  <p>It cannot be said that Tennyson, like Gladstone, found equal room for both
  ideals in his mind, for until old age had made him mistrustful and querulous
  he was essentially a man of progress. But his choice of the Arthurian legend
  for what he intended to be his chief work, and the sentiment of many of his
  most beautiful minor poems, show what attraction the mediaeval spirit also
  possessed for him; nor, if he was to be in truth the poetical representative
  of his period, could it have been otherwise.</p>

  <p>He is not, however, like Gladstone, alternately a mediaeval and a modern
  man; but he uses mediaeval sentiment with exquisite judgment to mellow what
  may appear harsh or crude in the new ideas of political reform, diffusion of
  education, mechanical invention, free trade, and colonial expansion.</p>

  <p>The Victorian, in fact, finds himself nearly in the position of the
  Elizabethan, who also had a future and a past; and, except in his own, there
  is no age in which Tennyson would have felt himself more at home than in the
  age of Elizabeth. He does, indeed, in "Maud" react very vigorously against
  certain tendencies of the age which he disliked; but this is not in the
  interest of the mediaeval or any other order of ideas incompatible with the
  fullest development of the nineteenth century. If the utterance here appears
  passionate, it must be remembered that the poet writes as a combatant.</p>

  <p>When he constructs, there is nothing more characteristic of him than his
  sanity. The views on female education propounded in "The Princess" are so
  sound that good sense has supplied the place of the spirit of prophecy, which
  did not tabernacle with Tennyson. "In Memoriam" is a most perfect expression
  of the average theological temper of England in the nineteenth century. As in
  composition, so in spirit, Tennyson's writings have all the advantages and
  all the disadvantages of the golden mean.</p>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>By virtue of this golden mean Tennyson remained at an equal distance from
  revolution and reaction in his ideas, and equally remote from extravagance
  and insipidity in his work. He is essentially a man of the new time; he
  begins his career steeped in the influence of Shelley and Keats, without whom
  he would never have attained the height he did&mdash;a height nevertheless,
  in our opinion, appreciably below theirs, if he is regarded simply as a poet.
  But he is a poet and much else; he is the interpreter of the Victorian
  era&mdash;firstly to itself, secondly to the ages to come. Had even any poet
  of greater genius than himself arisen in his own day, which did not happen,
  he would still have remained the national poet of the time in virtue of his
  universality.</p>

  <p>Some personal friends&mdash;<i>splendide mendaces</i>&mdash;have hailed
  him as our greatest poet since Shakespeare. This is absurd; but it is true
  that no other poet since Shakespeare has produced a body of poetry which
  comes so near to satisfying all tastes, reconciling all tendencies, and
  registering every movement of the intellectual life of the period. Had his
  mental balance been less accurately poised, he might have been the laureate
  of a party, but he could not have been the laureate of the nation.</p>

  <p>As an intellectual force he is, we think, destined to be powerful and
  durable because the charm of his poetry will always keep his ideas before the
  popular mind; and these ideas will always be congenial to the solid,

  <p>Philosophically and theologically, Tennyson is even more conspicuously the
  representative of the average English mind of his day. Not that he is a
  fusion of conflicting tendencies, but that he occupies a central position,
  equally remote from the excesses of scepticism and the excesses of devotion.
  This position he is able to fill from his relation to Coleridge, the great
  exponent of the <i>via media</i>; not, as in former days, between
  Protestantism and Romanism, but between orthodoxy and free thought.</p>

  <p>Tennyson cannot, indeed, be termed Coleridge's intellectual heir. As a
  thinker he is far below his predecessor, and almost devoid of originality;
  but as a poet he fills up the measure of what was lacking in Coleridge, whose
  season of speculation hardly arrived until the season of poetry was past.</p>

  <p>Tennyson was but one of a band of auditors&mdash;it might be too much to

  a Cambridge man, and who, short and unsatisfactory as had been his residence

  <p>Such another school, only lacking a poet, had flourished at Cambridge in
  the seventeenth century, and now came up again like long-buried seeds in a

  <p>When the natural moodiness of Tennyson's temperament is considered, the
  prevalent optimism of his ideas, both as regards the individual and the
  State, appears infinitely creditable to him. These are ideas natural to sane
  and reflecting Englishmen, unchallenged in quiet times, but which may be
  obscured or overwhelmed in seasons of great popular excitement. The
  intellectual force of Tennyson is perhaps chiefly shown in the art and
  attractiveness with which they are set forth; even much that might have
  appeared tame or prosaic is invested with all the charms of imagination, and
  commends itself to the poet equally with the statesman.</p>

  <p>Tennyson is not the greatest of poets, but appreciation of his poems is
  one of the surest criteria of poetical taste; he is not one of the greatest
  of thinkers, but agreement with his general cast of thought is an excellent
  proof of sanity; many singers have been more Delphic in their inspiration,
  but few, by maxims of temperate wisdom, have provided their native land with
  such a Palladium.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn2"
     name="bn2"></a><b>Somersby Rectory, the birthplace of Alfred
     Tennyson</b></p>

  <p class="note">Alfred Tennyson was born on Sunday, August 6th, 1809, at
  Somersby, a village in North Lincolnshire between Horncastle and Spilsby. His
  father, the Rev. Dr. George Clayton Tennyson, Rector of Somersby, married in
  1805 Elizabeth Fytche, daughter of the Vicar of Louth, in the same county;
  and, of their twelve children, Alfred was the fourth.</p>

  <p class="note">He always spoke with affectionate remembrance of his early
  home: of the woodbine trained round his nursery window; of the
  mediaeval-looking dining-hall, with its pointed stained-glass casements; of
  the pleasant drawing-room, lined with bookshelves and furnished with yellow
  upholstery. The lawn in front of the house, where he composed his early poem,
  "A Spirit Haunts the Year's Last Hours," was overshadowed on one side by
  wych-elms, on the other by larch and sycamore trees.</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn1"
     name="bn1"></a><b>Somersby Brook</b></p>

  <p class="note">On the south was a path bounded by a flower-border, and
  beyond "a garden bower'd close" sloping gradually to the field at the bottom
  of which ran the Somersby Brook</p>

  <p class="poem">That loves<br>
  To purl o'er matted cress and ribbed sand,<br>
  Or dimple in the dark of rushy coves,<br>
  Drawing into his narrow earthen urn<br>
  In every elbow and turn,<br>
  The filtered tribute of the rough woodland.</p>

  <p class="note">The charm and beauty of this brook haunted the poet
  throughout his life, and to it he especially dedicated, "Flow down, cold
  rivulet, to the sea." Tennyson did not, however, attribute his famous poem,
  "The Brook," to the same source of inspiration, declaring it was not
  addressed to any stream in particular.</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn3"
     name="bn3"></a><b>Tennyson's Mother/ Somersby Church</b></p>

  <p class="note">Tennyson was exceedingly fortunate in the environment of his
  childhood and the early influence exercised by his parents. His mother was of
  a sweet and gentle disposition, and devoted herself entirely to the welfare
  of her husband and her children. Her son is said to have taken her as a model
  in "The Princess"; and he certainly gave a more or less truthful description
  of this "remarkable and saintly woman" in his poem "Isabel":&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">Locks not wide-dispread,<br>
  Madonna-wise on either side her head;<br>
  Sweet lips whereon perpetually did reign<br>
  The summer calm of golden charity.</p>

  <p class="note">Tennyson's father was a man of marked physical strength and
  stature, called by his parishioners "The stern Doctor." In 1807 he was
  appointed to the living of Somersby, and that of the adjoining village of Bag
  Enderby, and this position he held until his death, on March 16th, 1831, at
  the age of fifty-two. He was buried in the old country churchyard, where
  "absolute stillness reigns," beneath the shade of the rugged little tower. In
  his time the roof of the church was covered with thatch, as were also those
  of the cottages in its immediate vicinity.</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn4"
     name="bn4"></a><b>Bag Enderby Church</b></p>

  <p class="note">The livings of Somersby and Bag Enderby were held conjointly,
  service being conducted at one church in the morning and at the other in the
  afternoon. Dr. Tennyson read his sermons at Bag Enderby from the quaint
  high-built pulpit, Alfred listening to them from the squire's roomy
  pew.</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn5"
     name="bn5"></a><b>Louth/The Grammar School, Louth</b></p>

  <p class="note">At the age of seven Tennyson was sent to school at Louth, a
  market-town which may fairly lay claim to having been a factor of some
  importance in his early life. His maternal grandmother lived in Westgate
  Place, her house being a second home to the young Tennysons. The old Grammar
  School where Alfred received the early portion of his education is now no
  longer in existence. Tennyson's recollections of it and of the Rev. J. Waite,
  at that time the head-master, were not pleasant. "How I did hate that
  school!" he wrote later. "The only good I got from it was the memory of the
  words <i>Sonus desilientis aquae</i>, and of an old wall covered with wild
  weeds opposite the school windows."</p>

  <p class="note">Tennyson's first connected poems were composed at Louth, and
  in this town also his first published work saw the light, appearing in a
  volume entitled "Poems by Two Brothers," issued in 1827 by Mr. J. Jackson, a
  bookseller. The two brothers were Charles and Alfred Tennyson.</p>

  <p class="note">After a school career which lasted four years, Alfred
  returned to Somersby to continue his studies under his father's tuition. This
  course of instruction was supplemented by classics at the hands of a Roman
  Catholic priest, and music-lessons given him by a teacher at Horncastle.</p>

  <p class="note">In 1828 Charles and Alfred Tennyson followed their elder
  brother Frederick to Trinity College, Cambridge. They began their university
  life in lodgings at No. 12, Rose Crescent, moving later to Trumpington
  Street, No. 57, Corpus Buildings. Of his early experiences of life at
  Cambridge, Alfred wrote to his aunt: "I am sitting owl-like and solitary in
  my rooms (nothing between me and the stars but a stratum of tiles). The hoof
  of the steed, the roll of the wheel, the shouts of drunken Gown and drunken
  Town come up from below with a sea-like murmur...The country is so
  disgustingly level, the revelry of the place so monotonous, the studies of
  the University so uninteresting, so much matter of fact. None but dry-headed,
  calculating, angular little gentlemen can take much delight in them."</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn6"
     name="bn6"></a><b>Arthur Hallam (from the bust by Chantrey)</b></p>

  <p class="note">It was at Trinity College that Tennyson first made the
  acquaintance of Arthur Hallam, youngest son of the historian, whose
  friendship so profoundly influenced the poet's character and genius. "He
  would have been known if he had lived," wrote Tennyson, "as a great man, but
  not as a great poet; he was as near perfection as mortal man could be."</p>

  <p class="note">In February 1831 Tennyson left Cambridge without taking a
  degree, and returned to Somersby, his father dying within a month of his
  arrival. From this time onward Hallam became an intimate visitor at the
  Rectory, and formed an attachment for his friend's sister Emily. In July 1832
  Tennyson and Hallam went touring on the Rhine, and at the close of the year
  appeared the volume of "Poems by Alfred Tennyson," which contained, amongst
  others, "The Lady of Shalott," "The Miller's Daughter," "The Palace of Art,"
  "The Lotos Eaters," and "A Dream of Fair Women."</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn7"
     name="bn7"></a><b>"The Lady of Shalott"</b></p>

  <p class="note">"Well I remember this poem," wrote Fitzgerald, with reference
  to 'The Lady of Shalott,' "read to me, before I knew the author, at Cambridge
  one night in 1832 or 3, and its images passing across my head, as across the
  magic mirror, while half asleep on the mail-coach to London 'in the creeping
  dawn' that followed."</p>

  <p class="poem">There she weaves by night and day<br>
  A magic web with colours gay.<br>
  She has heard a whisper say,<br>
  A curse is on her if she stay<br>
  To look down to Camelot.<br>
  She knows not what the curse may be,<br>
  And so she weaveth steadily,<br>
  And little other care hath she,<br>
  The Lady of Shalott.</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn8"
     name="bn8"></a><b>"Mariana in the South"</b></p>

  <p class="note">The idea of "Mariana in the South" came to Tennyson as he was
  travelling between Narbonne and Perpignan. Hallam interpreted it to be the
  "expression of desolate loneliness."</p>

  <p class="poem">Till all the crimson changed, and past<br>
  Into deep orange o'er the sea,<br>
  Low on her knees herself she cast,<br>
  Before Our Lady murmur'd she;<br>
  Complaining, "Mother, give me grace<br>
  To help me of my weary load,"<br>
  And on the liquid mirror glow'd<br>
  The clear perfection of her face.</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn9"
     name="bn9"></a><b>Stockworth Mill</b></p>

  <p class="note">Of these earlier poems none added more to Tennyson's growing
  reputation than "The Miller's Daughter." It was probably written at
  Cambridge, and the poet declared that the mill was no particular mill, or if
  he had thought of any mill it was that of Trumpington, near Cambridge. But
  various touches in the poem seem to indicate that the haunts of his boyhood
  were present in his mind.</p>

  <p class="note">Stockworth Mill was situated about two miles along the banks
  of the Somersby Brook, the poet's favourite walk, and might very well have
  inspired the setting of these beautiful verses.</p>

  <p class="poem">I loved the brimming wave that swam<br>
  Thro' quiet meadows round the mill,<br>
  The sleepy pool above the dam,<br>
  The pool beneath it never still,<br>
  The meal-sacks on the whiten'd floor,<br>
  The dark round of the dripping wheel,<br>
  The very air about the door<br>
  Made misty with the floating meal.</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn10"
     name="bn10"></a><b>The Palace of Art</b></p>

  <p class="note">In the volume of 1832, several stanzas of "The Palace of Art"
  were omitted, because Tennyson thought the poem was too full. "'The Palace of
  Art,'" he wrote in 1890, "is the embodiment of my own belief that the Godlike
  life is with man and for man."</p>

  <p class="note">Amongst the "marvellously compressed word pictures" of this
  poem is the beautiful one of our illustration on page 11.</p>

  <p class="poem">Or in a clear-wall'd city on the sea.<br>
  Near gilded organ-pipes, her hair<br>
  Wound with white roses, slept St. Cecily;<br>
  An angel look'd at her.</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn11"
     name="bn11"></a><b>Clevedon Church</b></p>

  <p class="note">On the 15th of September, 1838, Arthur Hallam died suddenly
  at Vienna. His remains were brought to England, and laid finally to rest in
  the old and lonely church beside the sea at Clevedon, on January 3rd,
  1834.</p>

  <p class="poem">When on my bed the moonlight falls,<br>
  I know that in thy place of rest<br>
  By that broad water of the west<br>
  There comes a glory on the walls.</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn12"
     name="bn12"></a><b>"In Memoriam"</b></p>

  <p class="note">Tennyson's whole thoughts were absorbed in memories of his
  friend, and he continually wrote fragmentary verses on the one theme which
  filled his heart, many of them to be embodied seventeen years later in the
  completed "In Memoriam."</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn13"
     name="bn13"></a><b>The home of Emily Sellwood, at Horncastle/Grasby
     Church</b></p>

  <p class="note">In 1830 Tennyson first met Emily Sellwood, who twenty years
  later became his wife. Horncastle was the nearest town to Somersby, and in
  the picturesque old market-square stood the red-brick residence of Mr. Henry
  Sellwood, a solicitor. The young Sellwoods being much of the same age as the
  Tennysons, a friendship sprang up between the two families, which in later
  years ripened into a double matrimonial relationship. In 1836, Charles
  Tennyson, the poet's elder brother, married Louisa, the youngest daughter of
  Henry Sellwood. In the previous year he had succeeded to the estate and
  living of Grasby, taking the surname of Turner under his great-uncle's will.
  At his own expense he built the vicarage, the church and the schools; and on
  his death, in 1879, Grasby descended to the Poet Laureate. It was at his
  brother's wedding that the bride's sister, Emily, was taken into church by
  Alfred Tennyson, but no engagement was recognised between them until four or
  five years later, and their marriage did not take place until 1850. It was
  solemnised at Shiplake Church on June 13th, the clergyman who officiated
  being the poet's intimate friend, the Rev. Robert Rawnsley.</p>

  <p class="note">In the April of the same year, on the death of Wordsworth,
  Tennyson had been offered the poet-laureateship, to which post he was
  appointed on November 19th, owing chiefly to Prince Albert's admiration for
  "In Memoriam."</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn14"
     name="bn14"></a><b>Lady Tennyson</b></p>

  <p class="note">Lady Tennyson became the poet's adviser in literary matters.
  "I am proud of her intellect," he wrote. She, with her "tender, spiritual
  nature," was always by his side, cheerful, courageous, and a sympathetic
  counsellor. She shielded his sensitive spirit from the annoyances and trials
  of life and "her faith as clear as the heights of the June-blue heaven"
  helped him in hours of depression and sorrow.</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn15"
     name="bn15"></a><b>Chapel House, Twickenham</b></p>

  <p class="note">Chapel House, Twickenham, was the poet's first settled home
  after his marriage, and he resided in it for three years. It was here his
  "Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington" was written, and the birth of
  his son Hallam took place in this house on August 11th, 1852.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn16"
     name="bn16"></a><b>Farringford, Tennyson's residence at Freshwater</b></p>

  <p class="note">In 1853, whilst staying in the Isle of Wight, Tennyson heard
  that the residence called Farringford was to let at Freshwater. He decided to
  take the place on lease, but two years later purchased it out of the proceeds
  resulting from "Maud," which was published in 1855, and Farringford remained
  his home during the greater part of each year for forty years, and here he
  wrote some of his best-known works.</p>

  <p class="note">"The house at Farringford," says Mrs. Richmomd Ritchie in her
  <i>Records</i>, "seemed like a charmed palace, with green walls without, and
  speaking walls within. There hung Dante with his solemn nose and wreath;
  Italy gleamed over the doorways; friends' faces lined the passages, books
  filled the shelves, and a glow of crimson was everywhere; the oriel
  drawing-room window was full of green and golden leaves, of the sound of
  birds and of the distant sea."</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn17"
     name="bn17"></a><b>The Glade at Farringford</b></p>

  <p class="note">The grounds of Farringford are exceedingly beautiful and
  picturesque. On the south side of the house is the glade, and close by</p>

  <p class="poem">The waving pine which here<br>
  The warrior of Caprera set.</p>

  <p class="note">Referring to Farringford in his invitation to Maurice,
  Tennyson wrote&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">Where far from noise and smoke of town<br>
  I watch the twilight falling brown<br>
  All round a careless order'd garden,<br>
  Close to the ridge of a noble down.</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn18"
     name="bn18"></a><b>Freshwater Bay</b></p>

  <p class="note">The ridge of the down in question constituted the poet's
  favourite walk, and the scenery which he encountered round Freshwater Bay
  might well have been represented in the opening verse of "Enoch
  Arden"&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">Long lines of cliff breaking have left a chasm;<br>
  And in the chasm are foam and yellow sands.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn19"
     name="bn19"></a><b>Freshwater Village</b></p>

  <p class="note">Inland the road leads to the little village of Freshwater, in
  which the erection of a number of new houses evoked from the poet the
  lines&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">Yonder lies our young sea-village&mdash;Art and Grace are
  less and less:<br>
  Science grows and Beauty dwindles&mdash;roofs of slated hideousness!</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn20"
     name="bn20"></a><b>Alfred Tennyson</b></p>

  <p class="note">Opposite these villas stands an ivy-clad house at that time
  occupied by Mrs. Julia Cameron, the celebrated lady art-photographer, two of
  whose effective portraits of Tennyson appear on pages 22 and 26.</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn21"
     name="bn21"></a><b>"The Idylls of the King"/Aldworth</b></p>

  <p class="note">In the autumn of 1859, "The Idylls of the King" were first
  issued in their original form, being four in number: Enid, Vivien, Elaine,
  and Guinevere, and from their publication until the end of Tennyson's life
  his fame and popularity continued without a check. During the next few years
  the poet spent much time in travelling, but in 1868 he laid the
  foundation-stone of a new residence, named Aldworth, about two miles from
  Haslemere, which became his second hone&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">You came, and look'd and loved the view<br>
  Long-known and loved by me,<br>
  Green Sussex fading into blue,<br>
  With one grey glimpse of sea.</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn22"
     name="bn22"></a><b>Tennyson's Lane</b></p>

  <p class="note">On the way from Haslemere to Aldworth, it is necessary to
  cross a rough common covered with whin bushes to reach the long winding lane
  which was named Tennyson's Lane. This was the poet's favourite walk when
  living in the neighbourhood.</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn23"
     name="bn23"></a><b>Tennyson's Memorial, Beacon Hill, Freshwater</b></p>

  <p class="note">Tennyson died on Thursday, October 6th, 1892, and was buried
  in the Poets' Corner, Westminster Abbey, next to Robert Browning, and near
  the Chaucer monument. Against the pillar close by the grave has been placed
  Wolner's well-known bust. The monument erected to the memory of the poet on
  Beacon Hill, near Freshwater, was unveiled by the Dean of Westminster on
  August 6th, 1897.</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn24"
     name="bn24"></a><b>Alfred Tennyson (from the painting by Samuel
     Laurence)</b></p>

  <p class="note">With regard to the portraits of Tennyson reproduced in these
  pages, perhaps those of chief interest in addition to the Cameron photographs
  already referred to are the paintings by Samuel Laurence, executed about
  1838, and the three-quarter length by G. F. Watts, now in the possession of
  Lady Henry Somerset. Of the former Fitzgerald wrote:</p>

  <p class="note">"Very imperfect as Laurence's portrait is, it is nevertheless
  the <i>best</i> painted portrait I have seen; and certainly the <i>only</i>
  one of old days. 'Blubber-lipt' I remember once Alfred called it; so it is;
  but still the only one of old days, and still the best of all, to my
  thinking."</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn25"
     name="bn25"></a><b>Alfred Tennyson (from the painting by G. F. Watts in
     1859)</b></p>

  <p class="note">The Watts portrait, according to Mr. Watts-Dunton, possesses
  "a certain dreaminess which suggests the poetic glamour of moonlight." The
  same writer asserts that "while most faces gain by the artistic halo which a
  painter of genius always sheds over his work, there are some few, some very
  few faces that do not, and of these Lord Tennyson's is the most notable that
  I have ever seen among men of great renown."</p>

  Here the tall trees have blown over, and have been allowed to stay just where
  they caught in each other's branches. Heart's-tongue and filix-mas ferns and
  bluebells line the path on either side. The utter quietude of the place, only
  broken now and again by the squeak of a squirrel, brought to my mind as I

  House, with the great magnolia and roses twining round the windows of
  Tennyson's own special rooms, remains almost the same.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">In 1890 I made a drawing of Farringford from almost the
  same point of view, as I think it is the best of this, the living, side of
  the house. In my first drawing I had the opportunity of sketching the Poet as
  he walked out in his boat cloak, but this time there were no inhabitants of
  the place but the gardeners one, an old friend of mine, William, the coachman
  of forty years' standing, came to talk with me sometimes and in their absence
  some intruding rabbits enjoyed themselves on the lawn.</p><br>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">Freshwater Bay</p>

  <p class="letter">My drawing of the Bay from the Park (near to the lane that
  runs through it) was painted this May after sunset when the buttercups and
  daisies had closed their petals. Afton Down rises to the left with its
  military road this end of the road is new, as some years ago the old end fell
  into the sea. The Stag rock just shows among the trees, and beyond are the
  red headlands on either side of Brook Bay, where lies the submerged "primeval
  forest." In the distance is St. Catherine's Point, the most southern in the
  Island. This view was seen, with a little difference in the immediate
  foreground, in the early sixties from Farringford House. But gradually the
  trees have grown up in the middle distance so that only a glimpse of the bay
  is now left. To recover the old view, Lord Tennyson tells me, he would have
  to cut away a whole wood. Even from the platform on the roof of the house one
  cannot now get the clear sweep of the down as seen in a drawing at Farring-
  ford made by "Dicky Doyle" of the old view from the drawing-room
  window.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Tennyson made this arbour for his wife in the early days of
  their coming to Farringford. The white lilac (of which there are bushes on
  either side) was one of his favourite flowers. The old arbour still stands,
  but is so closely overgrown with ivy that it cannot be much used for sitting
  in. I remember (when I was painting it, I think) the Poet taking Mr. Birket
  Foster and myself there to rest one sunny morning: he was in cheerful mood,
  and was amused by telling, and listening to, funny stories and sayings.</p>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">In the Kitchen Garden, Farringford</p>

  <p class="letter">The arbour that is shown in the corner of this drawing is
  newer and less picturesque than the one Tennyson made. Of late years he sat
  in it much on sunny afternoons in early spring, screened from the cold winds
  ; and many were the friendly meetings, talks, and teas that privileged
  friends have enjoyed with the Poet in this little house. The old cherry tree
  happened to be in fine bloom the spring I made this drawing, and on the right
  of it can be seen a little fir tree that was rooted on the top of the old
  wall. Later (when the present Lord Tennyson was in Australia) that part of
  the wall fell down in a great storm, probably partly because of the weight of
  this strong little tree on its summit.</p>

  bordered on both sides with flowers, the fruit trees and vegetables behind

  brightest green, the roses and lilies in bud the apple blossom is beginning
  to go over, but the lilacs, hyacinths, pink peony, pansies, and sweet-
  scented stocks are in perfection, with tulips and wall-flowers still bright,
  and the edging of aubretia still lilac.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">This leads from the dairy farm up into Farringford Kitchen
  Garden, and is, I think, so pretty a door- way, besides being so interesting,

  and facing the lane (at its turn here) running through the wilderness
  property. This drawing was made from the field (in a corner of which stand
  the ricks) and looks across the lane, down which the children are passing.
  This last year or two Mrs. Diment's growing family of fowls (not to speak of

  <p class="letter">We were staying in Haslemere during the summer of 1880, and
  my husband and I often walked up to Aldworth. Tennyson pointed out this as
  one of his favourite views a little glimpse of a farmhouse with the blue
  distance beyond, framed in by the pots of geraniums and formal trees on his
  terrace, and then by the arch of his porch. So I proposed to sketch it for
  him, and there was a sort of compact that, in return, he would allow me to
  make a drawing of himself, an operation by no means pleasant to him.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Lord Tennyson, who showed me this secluded spot some years
  ago, told me that it was one of his father's favourite walks from Aldworth.
  It lies in a hollow of Blackdown. The Poet always loved water (running water
  when possible), and liked to come and look into the depths of this shady
  pond, and to watch the little gold birch and beech leaves floating on its
  surface as they floated last autumn when I made this drawing.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">A group of fir trees stands on the far south-eastern corner
  of Blackdown, exposed to all the winds of heaven. There is a wide view over
  the Weald of Sussex from this point, and southward, on very clear days, one
  may get a glimpse of the sea between the hills. Just below the trees are the
  ruins of an old summer-house where Tennyson, in days gone by, used to sit. I
  did this drawing some years ago.. The young trees and shrubs have since grown
  up and choked the heather that used to border the little path going to the
  firs.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">One day when my husband and I were over from Witley,
  Tennyson took us for a beautiful walk, within sight of this old cottage, but
  it was too muddy that day for us to get near it. Later, in '90, "91, and '92,
  I often walked over the Down from Haslemere to paint, and made this and
  several other drawings of the cottage. One day Tennyson walked with us from
  Aldworth, and rested on a cottage chair in the little garden (at the far side
  of the cottage in this drawing) by a little rillet of spring water rushing
  down from the hillside.</p>
