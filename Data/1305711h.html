  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; THE WOMAN IN BLACK</h2>

  <p class="first">"CURSE the luck!"</p>

  <p>Above the babble of talk about the table, the harsh voice of the man arose
  and the players looked round, curiously or indignantly, according to their
  several temperaments. They saw a man of fifty-five, gaunt of face, his chin
  covered with a two days' growth of grey beard, his dark eyes shining
  malignantly as he glared at the table.</p>

  <p>He was dressed in a shabby evening suit, his shirt-front was discoloured
  and crumpled, and the trousers frayed over his patched and polished
  boots.</p>

  <p>His hand, none too cleanly, trembled as it touched his mouth, and his lips
  in their twitching betrayed the opium eater.</p>

  <p>"Damn Monte Carlo," he said, in his cracked but strident voice. "I never
  have any luck here&mdash;I'm goin' to stick to Nice, I am!"</p>

  <p>It was the voice of a common man as the dress was that of a poor man, and
  John Pentridge was both.</p>

  <p>A suave attendant approached him.</p>

  <p>"Would M'sieur come to recover himself outside the Salle de Jeu?" he asked
  politely.</p>

  <p>The man glared at him.</p>

  <p>"I'm stayin' here," he growled. "You've got my money. What more do you
  want?"</p>

  <p>"M'sieur is disturbing the players," said the man, who was now reinforced
  by two more attendants.</p>

  <p>"I'm staying here&mdash;keep your hands off me!" he roared, but the men
  had caught him by the arms and were gently but firmly leading him to the
  swing-doors of the gambling room.</p>

  <p>He would have struggled, but he had sense to know that in his enfeebled
  state he stood no chance against his captors.</p>

  <p>"I'll come back to-morrow," he almost shouted as they pushed him to the
  door, "I'll come back an' buy up the whole lot o' ye! I've got a million as
  good in my pocket! ye thievin' lot of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He had got to the door of the saloon, and suddenly he stopped shouting and
  drew back.</p>

  <p>They thought he was trying to resist them, and were prepared to use even
  greater force.</p>

  <p>"No, no, no!" he breathed in a terrified voice, "not
  there&mdash;look&mdash;that woman! Don't let her see me, for God's sake!"</p>

  <p>He spoke rapidly in French, and following the direction of his eyes, the
  men saw a girl standing in the centre of the outer saloon.</p>

  <p>She was young and exceedingly beautiful, and was dressed quietly, if
  expensively, in a smart tailor-made dress of black; black also was her hat,
  yet there was nothing funereal in her garb, but rather an effect of studied
  restraint. It was unusual to see a woman so attired at this hour of the
  evening, and she had evidently just arrived by motor-car, for a dust-cloak
  hung on her arm.</p>

  <p>"Get me out some other way," pleaded the prisoner urgently. All his
  truculence had disappeared, and he was in a pitiable state of panic.</p>

  <p>The head attendant hesitated. He saw the girl joined by a tall,
  grey-haired man, and they seemed to be on the point of making a move toward
  the Salle de Jeu.</p>

  <p>"This way," said the attendant, moved to pity by the unmistakable terror
  of the man. He led the way to a side door leading to a smaller salon, and
  from thence they gained the terrace of the Casino.</p>

  <p>"And M'sieur," said the chief of the man's custodians with infinite
  politeness, "I am requested by the directors to advise you not to come again
  to the Casino."</p>

  <p>John Pentridge wiped his streaming face with a grimy handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"That's settled me," he muttered, ignoring the remarks of the other. "I
  get rid of them papers to-night." Now, he was speaking to himself in
  English.</p>

  <p>"Livin' like a dog, I am," he continued his musings, "hunted from pillar
  to post all over Europe&mdash;phew!" Then he directed his attentions to the
  men who were gravely regarding him.</p>

  <p><i>"Allons! mes braves!"</i> he sneered, "I'll come to-morrow and buy you
  all up&mdash;you an' the bloomin' Casino too!"</p>

  <p>And with this awful threat he went swaggering along the deserted strip of
  terrace and reached the greater terrace, Monte Carlo's crowning pride, and
  mingled with the throng.</p>

  <p>But he had been seen. A man of his own age, and almost as shabbily
  dressed, followed in his wake as he walked toward the Condamine. Pentridge
  turned with a snarl, as a hand was laid on his arm.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Penty!" said an ingratiating, wheedling voice, "not goin' to leave
  an old pal, are you&mdash;old Chummy, Penty, wot's been faithful an' obligin'
  to you."</p>

  <p>The man addressed scowled.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's you, is it?" he asked contemptuously. "What do you want,"</p>

  <p>"Shares, Penty," said the other. His face in the light of the electric
  lamp was wrinkled and seared. His small eyes twinkled maliciously.</p>

  <p>"Ain't me an' you been in the same boat for years?" demanded the coaxing
  voice. "Ain't we been kicked from 'ell to Christiania? 'Tain't like the old
  Melbourne days, Penty&mdash;Gawd! I wish I was back in ole
  Melbourne&mdash;you remember that day at Flemin'ton when Carbine won the
  cup?"</p>

  <p>"Look here, Chummy,"&mdash;Pentridge faced his tormentor savagely; his
  face was livid with passion&mdash;"because you're an old lag an' I'm an old
  lag, living in this filthy continent because we ain't got sense enough to get
  out of it, you're not going to sponge on me. You had your share of the stuff
  we brought from Australia years ago&mdash;you've had your share of every
  swindle we've been in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But not of the big swag," corrected the other softly, "not of the
  what-dy-call-it invention; that's what I've been waitin' for, Penty, all
  these years. There's a bloke in Monte Carlo&mdash;a Russian bloke who's been
  blowin' all round the town of an invention he's goin' to buy. Couldn't help
  hearin' about it, Penty," he said almost apologetically. "That's the swag I
  want, because I helped to pinch it. And I could go this very night as ever
  is," he went on impressively, "an' see a certain young gel that's just come
  into Monte an' is drivin' back to Marseilles in an hour&mdash;I could go to
  her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" hissed Pentridge, his face working. "Come an' talk it over.
  Follow me at a distance&mdash;I don't want any one to see us together."</p>

  <p>He led the way through a throng of people to that corner of Monte Carlo
  where the villas of the wealthy, in their sedate and quiet isolation, offered
  opportunities for quiet talk. He turned into the gateway of a large
  house.</p>

  <p>"Where are you goin'?"</p>

  <p>The man called Chummy drew back suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Goin' to have a talk, ain't we?" demanded Pentridge. "I've got a friend
  livin' here."</p>

  <p>The other followed him reluctantly along the close-growing avenue of limes
  which led to the door of the villa, and Pentridge felt for the little
  life-preserver in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"What I say is&mdash;" began Chummy, then suddenly the other turned with
  the snarl of a wild beast and leaped at him.</p>

  <p>Three minutes later Pentridge came furtively from the avenue and walked
  rapidly down to the front.</p>

  <p>The train for Nice was moving as he reached the platform, and he had time
  to leap into an empty carriage, satisfied in his mind that no man had seen
  him in company with his sometime friend. In this surmise he was right, for
  when in the morning the battered wreck of something which had once been a man
  was discovered, the police found no assistance from voluntary witnesses, and
  since murder is not a topic for advertisement in delightful Monaco, they
  concluded their investigation in the day. They buried Chummy Gordon of
  Melbourne.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE MAN WHO GAMBLED</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was a warm night in March, such a night as only the
  Riviera knows, and Monte Carlo was filled with a restless, happy crowd.</p>

  <p>It was the day of the big race meeting, and the town, largely congested
  with visitors, had received a large contingent from Nice, Mentone, and as far
  eastward as San Remo. The beautiful promenades were thronged with a leisurely
  moving crowd, the terraces presented something of the appearance of a
  favourite English seaside resort in the height of the season, and the little
  tables of the Café Americain were fully occupied by a chattering, laughing
  crowd of diners.</p>

  <p>Monte Carlo was at its best, a crescent moon overhung the still waters of
  the Mediterranean, and sent little wriggling reflections of light along the
  unruffled surface of the sea. Ever and anon, the slow-moving crowd upon the
  terraces would stop and gaze upward as the whirring of a monoplane engine
  sounded above the babble of talk, and the dark shape of the aeroplane went
  gliding through the velvet darkness of the heavens.</p>

  <p>Two men came slowly through the swing-doors of the Monaco Palace Hotel,
  and stood for a moment upon the broad, marble pavement, looking down at the
  throng below. They were both in the first flush of manhood, and obviously
  British, by the correct cut of their evening clothes.</p>

  <p>Evidently they were in no great hurry, for they stood for some moments
  silently contemplating the animated scene. The taller of the two was a
  clean­shaven man of twenty-nine. He stood upright, and conveyed the
  impression that he was a soldier, though Milton Sands had known no other
  service than that which his patriotism had imposed upon him during the Boer
  war, when he had accepted a commission in the first Bushmen contingent of the
  Victorian Mounted Infantry.</p>

  <p>In the golden-brown light of the arc-lamp which swung above, the lean,
  sunburnt face took on a deeper tan. His big, grey eyes were set wide apart,
  the lines of his eyebrows were heavy and black and straight, and there was a
  strength and a resolution in the mouth and the determined jaw which revealed
  something of his character even to the amateur physiognomist. Yet the
  laughing lines about his eyes, and the merest twitch of a line at the comers
  of his mouth, told of a man who was possessed of that rare quality, a large
  and generous sense of humour.</p>

  <p>His companion, though well built, and tall by average standard, was half a
  head shorter than his fellow. He was of the sturdy soldier type too, but the
  outlines of his face were softer than the other's.</p>

  <p>Seeing him, you might describe him as a clean, well-set up Englishman, and
  find some difficulty in improving upon that description. Like his companion,
  he was clean-shaven, and bore evidence of a life largely spent in the open
  air. He flicked the ash of his cigarette, and turning suddenly to the man at
  his side, he asked: "Quo vadis?"</p>

  <p>Milton Sands looked round with a smile.</p>

  <p>"To the home of sin and affluence," he said.</p>

  <p>"In other words, the Casino?" smiled the other. "Well, I hope you have
  better luck than my&mdash;" he was going to say "friend," but changed his
  mind&mdash;"than Wilton has had. How have you done lately?"</p>

  <p>Milton Sands blew a succession of smoke rings into the still air before he
  replied. He might well have employed the interval of silence in the enjoyment
  of the knowledge that Toady Wilton had lost money, for he did not like him.
  "I hardly know," he answered cautiously. "From certain points of view I have
  done well, from others I have done badly. You see, I started on this trip
  with next to nothing, and I have still my capital."</p>

  <p>Eric Stanton laughed, and eyed the big man admiringly.</p>

  <p>"You have an inexhaustible capital of good spirits, at any rate," he said.
  "I have often wondered whether men make money at the tables. You see, I never
  gamble&mdash;not that way," he amended his statement, "I like to put my money
  on a horse, for I know that I shall get a run for it. I have not yet
  succumbed to the fascination of <i>rouge et noir</i> or <i>trente et
  quarante</i>, but you find it very occupying."</p>

  <p>"I don't know," drawled the other. "I am not here to pass my time, I am
  here to make money. That is a frank confession, isn't it? I came to Monte
  Carlo with a system and two hundred pounds. I have still got the system," he
  said grimly.</p>

  <p>Again Eric laughed. "It does not seem to worry you very much." The other
  shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Why should it? I am a philosopher, a gentle­man of fortune&mdash;an
  adventurer, if you like. There is a certain fierce joy in dragging money from
  a reluctant world, and when the representative of the world happens to be a
  short, fat French croupier with cobweb whiskers, the joy is intensified. I
  have done one wise thing "&mdash;he turned to the other with that mouth of
  his twitching&mdash;"I have deposited a sum equal to what my hotel bill is
  likely to be with the cashier of this excellent establishment, and I have a
  return ticket to London. For the rest"&mdash;he waved his hand airily at the
  distant Casino, alluring with its blaze of light&mdash;"my fate is on the
  wheel of chance. <i>Allons</i>!"</p>

  <p>They walked down the steps together, passed slowly through the
  holiday-making throng, and were swallowed up in the night. Three men had
  watched them with some interest. They were in evening dress, sitting over
  their coffee and cigars at a little marble table upon the broad veranda of
  the hotel.</p>

  <p>"Why aren't you with your pal, Toady?" asked one languidly.</p>

  <p>The man addressed scowled at the question, and his swarthy face puckered
  in angry creases as he muttered something sulkily.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't get rattled!" said the first speaker, "it is no insult to be
  called the friend of a millionaire."</p>

  <p>"You are always chaffing me, Sir George," growled the other man. "I am
  tired of having my leg pulled. If you are particularly anxious to know why I
  did not join him, I am willing to tell you," he went on viciously. "I did not
  want him to see me in your company."</p>

  <p>Sir George laughed easily. He was not thin-skinned, and the implied insult
  in the words left him unmoved. He stroked his long, flaxen moustache and
  gazed benevolently through his single eyeglass at his victim. Sir George
  Frodmere was a handsome man, with a remarkably fine complexion, the type
  which French comic artists invariably draw in an exaggerated way as being
  typical of the English race.</p>

  <p>"My dear Toady," he said patronisingly, "a man who spends all his life
  sidling up to dukes and any other branch of the aristocracy which has the
  disadvantage of having a handle to its name, should extend a little of his
  courtesy to one of Britain's baronets. I am well aware that your friend has
  constitutional objections to me, but for all he knows I may be a model of all
  that a baronet should be. A fine boy," he went on reflectively, "he rather
  favours his mother as I remember her."</p>

  <p>He shot a keen glance at Toady Wilton, and the dark man shifted
  uncomfortably in his chair.</p>

  <p>"She was a handsome woman," mused Sir George, gazing at the other through
  his half-closed lids. "What a pity she came such a cropper! She ran away from
  her husband, didn't she?"</p>

  <p>"I believe she did," growled Wilton, and sought to change the subject by
  suggesting a move.</p>

  <p>"Your disingenuous attempt to baulk the subject and to avoid discussion on
  this matter is either evidence of innate modesty or a guilty conscience,"
  said Sir George, "and I have never discovered the former quality in your
  curious composition. Yes," he went on, "she ran away from old Stanton,
  because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You know all about it," said Wilton shortly. "She ran away because she
  was falsely accused of carrying on a clandestine friendship with Lord
  Chanderson."</p>

  <p>"She went, taking her baby daughter with her, I understand," said Sir
  George. "It was quite a romantic affair. And she was never seen again, was
  she?"</p>

  <p>Wilton shook his head.</p>

  <p>"My friend Stanton spent a small fortune in trying to discover her," he
  said. "It is a painful subject, I wish you would change it."</p>

  <p>"And she was never seen again, eh!" mused Sir George, taking no notice of
  the other's discomfort, "neither she nor her daughter; and when old Stanton
  discovered what a fool he had been and how he had been tricked into believing
  his wife's guilt by some double-faced scoundrel who probably manufactured all
  the evidence against her out of sheer malice&mdash;did you speak, Toady?"</p>

  <p>"No," said the other, in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"As I was saying," the baronet went on carelessly, "when he found out that
  he was wrong (for in all probability he never discovered that he had been
  tricked into believing that Lord Chanderson was in love with his wife) he
  spent large sums of money to trace her whereabouts, and in the end left half
  his fortune to the woman and to the child he had so deeply wronged."</p>

  <p>"It was a mistake," muttered Toady Wilton indistinctly. "He thought she
  was in love with Chanderson; he saw the letters which Chanderson was supposed
  to have written to her, and which proved to be forgeries."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Sir George.</p>

  <p>He drank up his small glass of liqueur and wiped his lips with a silk
  handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"And you were his best friend up to the day of his death, and you
  benefited under his will."</p>

  <p>"What's the good of going into this?" burst forth the other impatiently.
  "You know as well as I that he didn't leave a penny to me, although on his
  death-bed he made reference to me which was interpreted by his son as meaning
  that he intended leaving me something."</p>

  <p>"Which the obliging Eric did, I understand," said Sir George. "Really,
  Toady, you are a lucky devil, because if Eric Stanton knew as much about you
  as I, you would not have touched a penny of that ten thousand pounds which I
  understand fie so obligingly handed over to you."</p>

  <p>Toady Wilton made no reply, but conceived an excuse to open a conversation
  with a silent man who had sat between them. But Kitson was a little out of
  place in that galley. The ill-fitting dress clothes, and his large, awkward
  hands, and his disinclination to join in the general conversation showed him
  to be a little outside the social sphere which these two men represented,
  however unworthily. From time to time he would jerk his head impatiently, as
  though his high standing collar was a source of irritation, as indeed it was,
  for Bud Kitson was no dude, and resented bitterly the necessity for appearing
  in public in his present guise.</p>

  <p>"When is that feller comin' along?" he asked. "You must be patient, Bud,"
  said Sir George. "Our friend, M. Soltykoff, is an erratic gentleman who takes
  a little too much to drink. When gentle­men take too much to drink they have
  no regard for time, and they are apt to be a little unpunctual."</p>

  <p>"I wish he would come," said Toady, fretfully. "The man is a lunatic to go
  wandering about Monte Carlo with a hundred thousand pounds in his
  pocket&mdash;with all the bad characters of Europe in the streets."</p>

  <p>"Not all," said Sir George, cheerfully. "I know three at any rate who are
  sitting in comfort on the piazza of the Monaco Palace Hotel. At the same
  time," he went on, "I share your apprehension; it would be a sin if after all
  our planning, and all our scheming, this good money, which rightly should
  come to us, falls into the hands of some low and commonplace thief who would
  not appreciate its value and would not put it to proper use."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand this," broke in Bud Kitson roughly. "I thought this
  guy was a pal, was one of us, that he was standing in, what's the idea?"</p>

  <p>Sir George looked at him amusedly. "The idea is very simple," he said
  gently. "M. Soltykoff is immensely rich, he is a manufacturer of Moscow who
  is financing us in some of our interesting schemes, some of the schemes," he
  said, nodding his head, "in which you are interested personally. But the fact
  that he is our partner does not hide the greater fact that he is a mug. Yes,
  a mug," he repeated, "in spite of his being one of the most prominent
  business men of Russia, in spite of his having been behind some of the most
  crooked operations in Europe, and the most interesting fact of all that he is
  buying an invention to-night or to-morrow which may easily make him one of
  the richest men in the world. I don't suppose you have explained this to
  Bud?" he asked, and Wilton shook his head. He had not thought it worth while
  offering any explanation to the man whom he regarded as little better than a
  brute. There, however, he was wrong. Bud Kitson, bank robber and "strong-arm
  man&mdash;" as he was, and a scoundrel who had seen the interior of almost
  every variety of prison to boot, was no fool.</p>

  <p>"I will explain," said Sir George, leaning across the table and speaking
  quickly. He was talking business now, and the old lazy bantering manner was
  put aside. "Soltykoff is a glass manufacturer, the biggest in Russia, I
  suppose. For years he has been trying to manufacture malleable glass.
  Malleable glass," he explained, "is a glass which will bend just as cloth
  will bend, without fracture. All the scientific chemists of the world have
  been seeking for that this last hundred years, but without success, but so
  confident was Soltykoff that it could be made that he has had a standing
  offer of twenty-five thousand pounds and a royalty to the inventor who can
  produce for him a glass answering all the tests which he would apply, and at
  last he has found the man. Who he is, I don't know "&mdash;Sir George
  shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"but he is living here or at Nice in comparative
  poverty. Negotiations have been opened, samples of the glass have been
  produced, and now Soltykoff has come down here to the Riviera in order to
  complete the sale. Is that clear to you?"</p>

  <p>Bud Kitson nodded.</p>

  <p>"He is one of those prodigal Russians who never move about without large
  sums of money." Sir George resumed. "He has probably got a hundred thousand
  pounds in his possession at this moment, his object being to pay whatever
  price this inventor demands. He is more likely than not to get it for a
  reasonable figure and have a decent surplus left. Now," he said slowly,
  emphasising his point by tapping his finger on the marble-topped table, "it
  is not everyday that Providence sends to impecunious people like ourselves,
  with no ideas as to the sanctity of property, a man in possession of a
  hundred thousand pounds in sheer hard cash or in French bank-notes, which is
  the same, since they never take the numbers of them. It doesn't matter to me
  whether he is a pal or a confederate, or what title he considers himself in
  relation to me, that money is good money. We might know him for years, for
  twenty years, for fifty years, perhaps, and never make so much out of him;
  besides," he said, with a shrug of his shoulders, "he is always half drunk,
  and there is no real reason why we should not make' a double profit."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked Bud, dropping his voice. "Do we wait for him
  before he goes to buy this patent?"</p>

  <p>"No," said the other, with a smile, "let him buy his patent. There is no
  reason why we should rob the poor man of the reward of his ingenuity and
  perseverance, but if it is possible we will take what is left, do you
  under­stand?"</p>

  <p>"I get you," said Bud Kitson, nodding his head.</p>

  <p>"Now," said the baronet&mdash;a warning glance from Toady Wilton arrested
  his speech.</p>

  <p>A man was coming up the broad marble steps which led to the piazza. He was
  a loose-made man of forty-five, with a heavy black beard and a bald head,
  which was made all the more evident by the fact that he carried his hat in
  his hand and was wiping his brow with a large and vivid hand­kerchief. He
  missed one step&mdash;stumbled and nearly fell, and the baronet and Toady
  Wilton exchanged significant glances; truly Soltykoff had begun his libations
  early that evening.</p>

  <p>"Ah, there you are!" he said. He spoke with scarcely a foreign accent, for
  he had been educated in England by his father, a wealthy Russian
  manufacturer. "I am so glad to see you."</p>

  <p>He grasped the baronet by both arms effusively, and would have kissed him
  on the cheek, but that the fastidious Sir George drew back.</p>

  <p>"I have kept you waiting, yes, I know," he spoke quickly and jovially,
  "yet I have had many difficulties; oh, my friend, what difficulties! And this
  cursed Monte Carlo is filled with people, and I cannot walk along the street,
  and my motor-car is not here, yet I say to myself, ah, my friends are
  waiting, and I am desolated that I cannot be with them at the hour I
  protested!"</p>

  <p>He managed to get some of his words a little wrong, for his opportunities
  for conversing in the language with which he was familiar were very few. Like
  most rich Russians, he did not come to London for his recreation, preferring
  the gaieties of Paris to the sombre joys which the metropolis offered.</p>

  <p>"And now I have come only for a short time," he said, "because I must go
  to Nice to-night to see my grand inventor."</p>

  <p>"What a man you are," said Sir George admiringly. "Why, you Russians can
  give English business men points and lose them."</p>

  <p>Soltykoff shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"There are many things," he said dryly, "in which the English can give me
  what you call points with considerable superfluity," he smiled.</p>

  <p>That he had been drinking heavily there was no doubt, but he had the
  capacity which some of his countrymen enjoy of retaining their faculties even
  under circumstances which would have floored the old three-bottle men of
  another century.</p>

  <p>"We were worrying about you, M. Soltykoff," said Toady Wilton, with what
  was meant to be an ingratiating smile.</p>

  <p>"Of me, you worry, why?" asked the other surprised.</p>

  <p>"My friend only means that it is not wise at this season to go round with
  your pockets filled with money," suggested Sir George playfully.</p>

  <p>The other laughed and clapped his hands for a waiter. He ordered a magnum
  of sweet champagne. It was his favourite drink, but the baronet shuddered at
  the thought that he would be asked to consume a wine which was particularly
  distasteful to him.</p>

  <p>"My money is here," he said. He opened his heavy cloth frock-coat and
  showed a big skirt pocket. Sir George had noticed the bulge in the garment
  and, suspecting its use, had heaved a little sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"It is here," repeated Soltykoff proudly, and drawing forth a great, black
  leather portfolio he banged it upon the table upsetting glasses and coffee
  cups with reckless indifference. He was all apologies immediately, but
  Kitson, a skilled man in these matters, noted that for all his apologies and
  for all the exhibition of sorrow and agitation the Russian's hand never left
  the black wallet.</p>

  <p>"To-night," he said, "I go to Nice to see my friend, everything is
  arranged, to-night I shall be in possession of the formula which will wonder
  the world."</p>

  <p>He spread out his hands extravagantly, and his jovial face beamed with the
  joy of anticipation.</p>

  <p>"We will wonder the world, my friend," he went on, "you shall see! It is
  the most marvellous, it is the most splendid of inventions; glorious, the
  most significant. You understand? My English is not very good," he
  apologised, "especially when I have taken just a little more wine than is
  usual."</p>

  <p>"Don't apologise, M. Soltykoff," said the baronet affably, "I should never
  have suspected that you had had a drink to-night." The other laughed, and
  replaced the wallet in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Much I have had," he said, "three magnums of champagne, I feel what you
  would call merry. Now to business."</p>

  <p>He squared himself round so that he faced all three.</p>

  <p>"You desire a great coup, is it not, on the race­course. You think it can
  be managed, and that a great deal of money is to be made. I myself will be in
  England for your Derby race, and it would afford me great pleasure; I do not
  ask you," he held up his hand with drunken dignity, "I do not ask you to
  explain lest there should be in this planment (<i>sic</i>) something of
  dishonesty. I am satisfied that money can be made and grand sport. I am
  satisfied," he bowed to Sir George, "that you are noble and all-er-right. I
  offer to make the finances&mdash;to how much extent?"</p>

  <p>"We shall want five thousand pounds," said Sir George.</p>

  <p>"Five thousand pounds," said Soltykoff reflectively, "that is fifty
  thousand roubles. You offer me security, no?"</p>

  <p>"The security of my name," said Sir George impressively.</p>

  <p>"That is sufficient," said the Russian, "fifty thousand roubles, you shall
  have it to-morrow." He frowned, "no, not to-morrow," he said, "I leave
  to-night for Paris. I will give you a cheque on my bank&mdash;the Credit
  Lyonnaise&mdash;I have the account at the head office in Paris."</p>

  <p>"Why not cash; to-night?" Sir George asked humorously, "you are carrying
  about a great deal of money, M. Soltykoff."</p>

  <p>"No, no," said the Russian, shaking his head, "all this I may require, you
  understand? I am on the threshold of a great achievement, a momentous world
  shaker of interest to International enormous. You follow me?" He addressed
  Toady Wilton.</p>

  <p>"Quite so," murmured the other, who did not comprehend one word the
  Russian was speaking, for now he talked with such bewildering rapidity and
  with so little regard for the rules of English syntax, that none but one
  skilled in the type of English could follow.</p>

  <p>"To-night, I leave for Paris, as I have told you, by the twenty-three
  forty- three from Nice. My address you will know in Paris, it is on the
  Avenue des Champs Elysées."</p>

  <p>He rose unsteadily and embraced Sir George with embarrassing heartiness,
  taking farewell with equal warmth of the stolid Kitson and the unattractive
  Mr. Wilton. They watched him going down the stairs.</p>

  <p>"He leaves to-night," said Sir George in a low voice, "you heard him?
  Wilton, get down to the station and book three sleepers from Nice to Paris,
  and be sure that you find out the berth that Soltykoff has secured."</p>

  <p>At ten o'clock that night Milton Sands strolled through the palatial
  vestibule of the Casino with a three-franc cigar in his mouth and less than
  three francs in hard cash in his pocket. He had left behind on the table the
  rest of his fortune, and was not in any way remorseful or regretful at his
  loss. He accepted the downs as well as the ups of life with the philosophy of
  one who had found himself bushed in the wildest part of the Australian desert
  without water or food, and who had yet retained a complete confidence that a
  miracle would happen which would save his life and bring him to a land,
  which, if it did not flow with milk and honey; would at least provide for him
  cool streams, a billy of tea, and a damper. A man who had sold gold claims at
  Coolgardie for the price of a pipeful of tobacco, and had afterwards seen
  those same claims resold for half a million, had had exactly the right kind
  of training which a Monte Carlo gambler requires. He walked back to the
  hotel, mounted the marble stairs slowly and came into the hall. He saw the
  porter.</p>

  <p>"Send up to my room," he said, "I am leaving by to-night's train for
  Paris."</p>

  <p>The gorgeous official murmured his regrets. He also was possessed of a
  philosophy of another kind. This was not the first guest of the hotel who had
  come with the intention of making a long stay, and who had as suddenly
  expressed his intention of making a hasty departure by the night train. Monte
  Carlo offered many demonstrations of that phenomena.</p>

  <p>Milton went to his room and changed, and watched the porter hastily
  packing the one modest piece of baggage the gambler possessed.</p>

  <p>"François," he said, speaking in French, "will you find out whether Mr.
  Eric Stanton is in the hotel?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Oui, monsieur</i>," replied the man, and went out of the room, and was
  back again in three or four minutes.</p>

  <p>"He is in the vestibule."</p>

  <p>Milton Sands nodded.</p>

  <p>He strode along the corridor, down the great steps and caught Eric just as
  he was entering the lift to ascend to his suite.</p>

  <p>"I want you for a minute, Stanton," he said.</p>

  <p>He led the other away to an unfrequented part of the vestibule.</p>

  <p>"You do not know me except as an occasional acquaintance, the sort of man
  you pick up at Monte Carlo," he said, "but I know you. I want you to do me a
  great favour. I will tell you before we go any further that I want to borrow
  money, but I only ask you for five pounds."</p>

  <p>"My dear chap," smiled the other, "you can have fifty if you want it."</p>

  <p>Milton Sands shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "I just want enough to get me to London. I have a cheque or
  two waiting for me there."</p>

  <p>"Are you going by to-night's train, too?" asked Stanton in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Why are you going?"</p>

  <p>"I have just had a wire calling me home," said the other, "and really
  Monte Carlo, if it is not getting on my nerves, is boring me."</p>

  <p>"Good business! Shall I run down to the station and fix up a sleeper?"</p>

  <p>"I wish you would," said Stanton. "By the way," he said, as Milton was
  moving off, "you will not be able to get your sleeper without money."</p>

  <p>With a smile he took out his pocket-book and removed a little wad of
  notes.</p>

  <p>"There are a thousand francs here," he said, "you had better take the lot,
  at any rate, you will want most of it to pay for the tickets, and if you
  don't feel inclined to accept more than a fiver, you can give me the change
  on the train."</p>

  <p>"A fiver will be enough," said Milton grimly, "I feel that I ought not to
  be trusted with any more than will just keep body and soul on nodding terms
  for the next few days."</p>

  <p>He had no difficulty in retaining sleepers on the night train; it was not
  the season of the year when there was any great exodus from Monte Carlo, the
  bulk of the traffic was in the other direction. More­over, the night train
  was not the most fashionable one, society preferring to travel by the more
  expensive and rapid Cote de Azur.</p>

  <p>He secured the tickets, and returned to find Eric Stanton ready for the
  journey, waiting at the cashier's desk whilst his bill was being prepared. As
  it happened, there was some slight balance to come from the deposit which the
  prudent Milton had made, and he contented himself with a loan of a hundred
  francs from the other.</p>

  <p>They strolled to the railway station together, having plenty of time, when
  suddenly Eric Stanton asked bluntly:</p>

  <p>"Exactly what are your plans?"</p>

  <p>"My plans?" asked the other in a shocked tone, "my dear, good chap, I
  never have plans. What a perfectly ghastly idea!"</p>

  <p>"It was impertinence on my part," smiled Eric, "and perhaps I did not make
  myself clear. I was wondering whether you," he hesitated, "had any settled
  occupation."</p>

  <p>"As I have told you," said the other cheerfully, "I am a gentleman of the
  world at large. I have no business but the business of earning money in the
  easiest and most adventurous way. My plans I never make, because the day
  provides them. That is a feature of my life with which I would not willingly
  part."</p>

  <p>They walked in silence for a little while and then Milton went on:</p>

  <p>"I must confess," he said gloomily, "that if ever I was confronted with
  the necessity for forming some plans or other it is at this particular
  moment. You see my system, upon which I spent so much time and placed such an
  extraordinary amount of reliance, is one of those systems which require a
  capital of a million pounds to work. Yes, it is particularly a million pound
  system, because if you had that sum there would be no necessity for gambling,
  and I think that is the best system I know."</p>

  <p>Eric Stanton had a genuine liking for this happy-go-lucky young man to
  whom the knocks and buffets of fortune only seemed to come as a welcome
  relief from the monotony of life.</p>

  <p>"I am associated with several businesses," he said hesitatingly, "and I
  was wondering whether I could help you in any way."</p>

  <p>Milton laughed, and clapped the other on the shoulder good-naturedly.</p>

  <p>"My dear, good chap," he said confidentially, "if you placed me in a
  position of trust I should possibly run away with the till before a week was
  out. I am dishonest&mdash;that is a fact which you must always bear in mind.
  My object in life&mdash;but need I go over the subject again," he laughed in
  mock despair, "at any rate," he went on in a more serious tone, "I am
  immensely grateful to you for the kindness which prompted your offer. I am a
  gambler, and shall remain a gambler, to the end of my days, unless I discover
  something which offers me greater scope for my undoubted talent."</p>

  <p>"I will give you my address, and if I can be of any assistance to you,
  please let me know," persisted Eric, and the other accepted the card with
  genuine gratitude.</p>

  <p>"You see," he said, "it is so unusual to meet a chap like you, because you
  very rich people are, as a rule, spoilt by the attention of all sorts of
  vicious hangers-on who have no other desire in life than to relieve you of
  your money. I may, perhaps, be able to return your kindness one of these
  days. In the meantime, you might, perhaps, enliven part of a very monotonous
  journey by assisting me in choosing a new profession, for a new profession I
  must have," he said half seriously, "and that by to-morrow at the latest.
  Whether it will be actor, and I am no bad actor, or whether it will be merely
  a waiter at one of those excellent Montmartre establishments where, as I
  understand, the tips are even more generous than they are in the more chic
  districts of Paris, or whether it will be as a sandwich board man in your
  beloved London, I do not know, and I should be very grateful if you would
  assist me in my choice."</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; JOHN PENTRIDGE AT HOME</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE are slums in Nice of which the visitor who only knows
  the Promenade des Anglais, and the glories of the mimosa and palm which
  beautify the front, can have no conception.</p>

  <p>It was to one of the little streets on the north side of the town that M.
  Soltykoff directed the <i>cocher</i> to drive. The man looked in amazement at
  the well-dressed visitor who seemed bent upon penetrating the undesirable
  district of Nice, but the other repeated his order with a definite gesture of
  one who was used to being obeyed.</p>

  <p>The Passage du Bue is a narrow street of tall, unlovely houses where the
  artisan classes of Nice, the hawkers, and all the small pitiful under-world
  of that beauty spot overcrowd in their penury. Number 27bis was the least
  attractive of the dwellings, but M. Soltykoff was not unused to unsavoury
  habitations, and possibly this unattractive house had qualities which
  compared very favourably with the tenements in which his own workmen dwelt.
  At any rate he was not the kind of man who took a sentimental interest in the
  miseries of those who were forced by circumstances to dwell amidst such,
  signs of squalor and misery.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Pentridge," said a slatternly concierge&mdash;even this
  miserable dwelling boasted a concierge&mdash;whose business it was to collect
  the rent weekly from the unfortunate tenants, "yes, M. Pentridge is in
  residence, monsieur will find him on the fourth floor in the little room at
  the left as one reaches the head of the stairs."</p>

  <p>Soltykoff mounted the rickety stairs, gingerly. He was sardonically amused
  at the thought of the danger he would run if it were known that he was
  carrying two and a half million francs in his pocket. He reached the door he
  was making for and knocked on its yellow panel. At first there was no reply,
  and he repeated the knock.</p>

  <p>"Come in," said a voice gruffly.</p>

  <p>He opened the door and entered.</p>

  <p>The room was a small one, almost innocent of furniture save for a rickety
  trestle-bed in one comer of the room, a small table, and a chair. Light was
  afforded by a small oil-lamp which stood upon the table.</p>

  <p>John Pentridge, the man the Russian sought, was sitting on the edge of his
  bed. He was dressed in an old pair of trousers and a discoloured shirt which
  was open at the front to show his bony chest. On one end of the bed lay the
  disordered evidence of a hasty change of dress. It was only by urging the
  driver forward with a promised reward that he had arrived before his
  visitor.</p>

  <p>His eyes, sunk in his head, burnt fiercely, as though some malignant fever
  consumed him, and as he looked up at the visitor, making no attempt to rise,
  Soltykoff, even in his bemused state, thought he had never seen so sinister a
  figure.</p>

  <p>"Are you M. Soltykoff?" he asked.</p>

  <p>He spoke in English and Soltykoff nodded. With­out invitation he pulled
  the chair towards the bed and sat down.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Pentridge," he said, "I have the business important with you to
  transact immediately; for to-night I must leave for Paris, having
  engagements, you will understand."</p>

  <p>"I understand," said the other harshly, "have you brought the money?"</p>

  <p>"That," M. Soltykoff replied diplomatically, "is for the future
  consequence to discover. At once I required your formula." He spoke a little
  thickly, because he had utilised the hour between Monte Carlo and Nice to
  still further indulgence of sweet champagne.</p>

  <p>"You understand," he said, "I am a glass maker practical. I will tell you
  at once if your scheme is good."</p>

  <p>"You have seen the samples," said the other, scowling at his visitor,
  "ain't they enough for you?"</p>

  <p>"I have seen the samples," agreed Soltykoff cheerfully, "and they are
  marvellous. I do not disguise from you, my friend, that they are wonderful.
  Now you have the formula."</p>

  <p>The other man rose slowly and shuffled to a little cupboard over the head
  of his bed. He unlocked it with a key that he took from his pocket and
  brought out an envelope. He held the precious package tightly.</p>

  <p>"There will be trouble for you," he warned, "if it ever comes out where
  you got this from. I ain't going to say that I got it dishonestly," he went
  on cunningly. "I have had it for nigh on thirty years, and in my pocket most
  of the time, and I made the glass; you wouldn't think it to look at me, would
  you? but I 'ad a master, I 'ad. The man that taught me could teach babies.
  Did you ever hear of Granford Turner?"</p>

  <p>"Granford Turner," repeated Soltykoff, "that name is familiar; why, yes,
  he was the inventor, fifty years ago the great inventor. I remember now the
  tragedy."</p>

  <p>The man nodded.</p>"I dare say you do," he cried, "he killed a pal, didn't
  he? and got transported<br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">for life I know," he nodded his head,
  "because</span><br>
  I met him in Australia, the finest inventor the world has ever had. He's dead
  now," he said hurriedly.

  <p>"Where did you meet him?" asked Soltykoff, curiously.</p>

  <p>"That's nothing to do with you," snarled the other, "here's the formula,
  here's every ingredient, the degree of every heat that's got to be used; why,
  he even tells you how to make the crucibles to melt it," he added, with
  reluctant admiration.</p>

  <p>"The inventor is not to be met?" asked M. Soltykoff.</p>

  <p>"Dead," said the other shortly, "that's enough for you. I've carried this
  about with me for thirty years, I tell you. I knew it would make a fortune
  for me. I'd have sold it before only," he hesitated, he could not, with
  credit to himself, explain the reason for his forbearance, for he might in
  his explanation reveal the terror he conceived for the man who had trusted
  him with his secret&mdash;a trust which he had violated on the first
  available opportunity&mdash;nor could he tell the story without betraying his
  acquaintance with a confederate who at that moment was lying dead in the
  shadow of the limes of Monaco.</p>

  <p>"Let me see the document," demanded Soltykoff, and the man, with some
  reluctance, allowed it to go out of his grasp. Drawing his chair near the
  table Soltykoff carefully read the ten closely-written pages that detailed
  the secret process of manufacture. Now and then he would stop and start and
  utter a little exclamation.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," he muttered, "this is it, so easy, and yet none of us thought
  of it."</p>

  <p>It almost sobered him; the shock and joy which the handling of those
  papers produced.</p>

  <p>No one knew better than he how important this discovery was or how
  authentic it was, but he must have further proof. Seeing him looking round
  the apartment the man anticipated his desires. From the cupboard from which
  he had taken the package he brought a small spirit-lamp, one or two thin
  pieces of glass, a tiny blow-pipe, and two little boxes, one containing a
  whitish and the other a reddish powder. "They are made up in the exact
  proportions," said Pentridge gruffly, "you needn't bother to look at the
  paper."</p>

  <p>For half an hour, M. Soltykoff sat thus, spirit-stove burning bluely on
  the table, a small plate of steel arranged above it, using a pinch of white
  powder here, and a microscopic portion of red there, melting and remelting,
  and melting again till at the last he produced a flat box of colourless glass
  which was no different in appearance to a piece of glass blown by ordinary
  commercial methods. He waited for it to cool, and then he sliced it up from
  the steel plate with a knife. It was still warm, but he held it in his hand.
  He bent it. Not only did it bend without the slightest sign of a break, but
  when the pressure he exercised was released it resumed its former
  position.</p>

  <p>"Not only malleable," he said to himself, "but elastic."</p>

  <p>He took from his pocket the long, black portfolio.</p>

  <p>"What is your price?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The man hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I asked you for twenty thousand pounds," he said, "but it is worth more
  than that, and I am not going to part with it under fifty."</p>

  <p>Here, however, he was up against a master of bargaining, a man not to be
  flurried, not to be bullied, and certainly not to be bluffed into giving a
  penny more than he was actually obliged.</p>

  <p>"My friend," said the little Russian with his broad smile, "you think by
  what you see that I am drunk, <i>voilà</i>, you are right, for to-night I am
  extremely intoxicated, but of insanity I have none; you understand? You make
  a bargain; twenty thousand pounds&mdash;two hundred thousand roubles. I come
  to you with the money; I do not ask from whence you secured or stole this; or
  by what method you secured from the unfortunate Turner the formula. I am
  prepared to pay you. If you are a rich man and can afford to say I will take
  it elsewhere, do so. I offer you its full value, twenty thousand pounds. You
  may take this or you may leave this, but I have my train to catch to Paris,
  and I cannot afford to wait."</p>

  <p>"Give me the money," growled the other.</p>

  <p>He held out his shaking hand eagerly, and the Russian slowly counted fifty
  notes of the value of ten thousand francs each into his hand.</p>

  <p>"I am interested," said Soltykoff, "in what you shall do with this
  money."</p>

  <p>The man's eyes were dancing with a strange light.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said fiercely, "you're a rich man, and you've been rich
  all your life. I'm a poor devil who's been kicked around. You can take your
  time and do things at your leisure, but I'm getting old and I have lived in
  poverty for all these years. Every penny I have earned or have won has gone
  back to the tables, and now I am going to have the gamble of my life, you see
  what I mean?"</p>

  <p>He peered eagerly, almost pathetically it seemed to the Russian, as though
  he were anxious to secure the other's approval.</p>

  <p>"I haven't got so many years to live, I can't afford to wait my turn. I'm
  going to dress myself to-morrow like a real swell, none of this!" He swept
  his discarded dress-clothes to the floor, "I'm going to Monte Carlo, just the
  same as I've seen these nobs go for twenty-five years, and I shall have my
  flutter; they won't know me when I've got myself up in style. I'll play the
  maximum every time, that's the way they make money, and that's the way I'll
  make money."</p>

  <p>"My friend," said the Russian blandly, as he carefully deposited the
  formula in the long envelope of his satchel, "I would tell you
  this&mdash;that if I had leisure&mdash;I would play you for the money you
  have taken from me&mdash;and I should win; always, I should win, because I do
  not need the money. Always you would lose because it is vital to you. You are
  what they call in England, the damned fool," and he went out of the little
  room joyously, singing a song as he tripped down the stairs and out to his
  waiting cab, conscious that he had done, perhaps, the greatest night's work
  of his life.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE WRECK OF THE RIVIERA LIMITED</h2>

  <p class="first">"I WAS afraid, young lady, your quest was going to be a
  fairly hopeless one."</p>

  <p>The speaker was a tall delicate-looking man who walked up and down the
  deserted platform of the Marseilles station, and he addressed his remarks to
  the girl at his side.</p>

  <p>She smiled patiently.</p>

  <p>"I always know that these trips are likely to be without result, Lord
  Chanderson," she said quietly; "at the same time there is always the chance
  that I might find the man my grandfather seeks, and I feel that whilst I am
  young and have health I can assist him. Although he is so strong I do not
  think he is fitted for a life of travel. He so easily becomes worried when he
  has to deal with people who do not speak his own language. But it is selfish
  of me to have kept you up till this hour."</p>

  <p>He shook his head laughingly.</p>

  <p>"Pray, do not apologise, Miss President," he said, "you know I am
  afflicted with insomnia, and I very seldom go to bed before four. I count
  myself fortunate that I was in Marseilles and had the opportunity of serving
  you&mdash;such little service as I was able to render."</p>

  <p>"You were very good," she said, looking at him gratefully, "after all, it
  is not a very pleasant task for a girl to make the rounds of the various
  stations of a French town seeking to identify a man without being able to
  satisfy the police authorities that he is a criminal within the meaning of
  the word. I think it would have been difficult to have made these inquiries
  in Marseilles, but for your kindness&mdash;and certainly my trip to Monte
  Carlo would have been impossible."</p>

  <p>"I am always glad to help your grandfather," Lord Chanderson replied, "he
  is a most remarkable man, few people whom I have met in my life are so
  impressive as he."</p>

  <p>"Grandfather thinks a lot of you," she said quietly, "and you really have
  been most kind. We did not expect a steward of the Jockey Club to interest
  himself in our humble fortunes."</p>

  <p>Lord Chanderson laughed a little. He was a grey­haired man who must have
  been singularly handsome in his youth. He still retained the perfect profile
  and that aesthetic cast of countenance which the newspapers had made so
  familiar to their readers.</p>

  <p>"Your grandfather is one of those small owners who are an acquisition to
  the Turf," he said courteously, "you know we in England look rather askance
  at the newcomer on the Turf; and particularly, for some reason or other which
  I have never been able to fathom, do we suspect the Australian racing man of
  a shrewdness and of a type of shrewdness which perhaps he does not
  possess."</p>

  <p>"You mean he is wilfully dishonest," said the girl quietly.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I would hardly go so far as saying that, only there is a certain slimness
  (is that the word they use at the Cape?) about some of the newcomers which is
  hardly desirable from our point of view. It is really wonderful that your
  grandfather with only one horse&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"With two," she corrected quietly.</p>

  <p>"Two," he said in surprise, "I thought he only had one."</p>

  <p>"You forget our great Derby horse," she said with a gravity which he
  thought at first was assumed?</p>

  <p>"'Down under Donovan.'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have never heard of 'Down under Donovan,'&mdash;" he laughed, "which
  shows you that even a steward of the Jockey Club may learn something at three
  o'clock in the morning on the platform of a Marseilles railway station." He
  looked up at the train. "You will be going in five minutes," he said.</p>

  <p>The long line of sleepers stood by the platform silent and quiet. Most of
  the occupants were in the midst of their slumbers, and probably found the
  hour's halt at the great southern port an hour of unshaken repose which added
  considerably to their comfort.</p>

  <p>"You have got your ticket and your seat?"</p>

  <p>"I have a sleeper," she said, and indicated the car. "Whilst you were so
  kindly seeing to my baggage I was inspecting my little bedroom."</p>

  <p>A railway official came muttering along the platform.</p>

  <p><i>"En voiture s'il vous plaît,"</i> he droned musically.</p>

  <p>The girl, with a hurried handshake, climbed up the three steps into the
  sleeping wagon. She stood by the glass door for a moment waving a farewell to
  the bareheaded man on the platform.</p>

  <p>He was the kind of English sportsman she adored, and it could not be said
  that every Briton she had met, both in the pleasant little Twickenham home
  that her grandfather had founded and on the race-course where she spent many
  of her days, excited anything like the warmth of admiration in her bosom. But
  Chanderson was of the old order, an aristocrat to his finger tips, a man of
  brilliant, scholarly attainments, and possessed, moreover, of that fine sense
  of delicacy which is instinctively communicated to a woman, and the existence
  of which she is the first to recognise. It had been fortunate indeed that he
  was at Marseilles, for a rumour had reached her grandfather that the man he
  sought was in the south of France, and had been seen by one who knew him in
  the neighbourhood of the town. Doubtless, the in­formation was accurate, but
  the search for a man with no other help than a twenty-year-old photograph was
  equivalent to looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack. The girl's
  visit had been unsuccessful, but she left Marseilles with a pleasant memory
  for which Lord Chanderson's kindness and courtesy was mainly responsible. It
  was only by accident that old John President had learned that Lord Chanderson
  was staying at Marseilles, and it was with no very hopeful feeling that he
  had given his grand-daughter a letter of introduction to a man who had always
  shown him evidences of friendship and goodwill since his arrival in England.
  She made her way to the narrow cell-like apartment where her bed was laid,
  and made her preparations for the night.</p>

  <p>She had not gone far in those preparations before she realised that the
  night was not to be with­out annoyance, for the occupant of the next
  compartment was obviously in an advanced stage of intoxication. Now and again
  he would sing loudly and boisterously, then his voice would sink to a mumble
  of indistinguishable sounds only to rise again almost to a shout. He was
  singing in a language she could not understand, and that he was perfectly
  happy she gathered from the fact that from time to time there came a gust of
  loud laughter, as though he were communing with himself over some delectable
  joke and could not resist the emotions which that jest aroused. She hoped
  that when the train increased its speed the noise would be sufficient to
  drown all sound from this inconsiderate vocalist. But his voice had a very
  piercing quality, and she had not lain down long before it was borne in upon
  her that unless she could force herself to ignore the annoyance she was to
  have a sleepless night. Once she heard somebody pass down the corridor and
  tap at the door of the next compartment, and a drawling voice demand that the
  singer should smother himself.</p>

  <p>She heard the laughing reply, and wondered who it was who had had the
  temerity to admonish the turbulent traveller. She concentrated her mind upon
  the object of her journey, hoping in that way to find sleep. It was not an
  excellent preparation, for her mission had been one which was calculated to
  rouse serious thought, and serious thought is not the best sedative. She had
  sought John Pentridge in Marseilles as her grandfather had sought him up and
  down Europe during these last five years, as he had sought him throughout the
  whole length and breadth of Australia. The news of his presence in this part
  of the world, conveyed by one who thought he had seen him in the streets of
  Marseilles, had brought her hot foot to the south of France, as beforetimes
  it had taken her to almost every capital of Europe. She shared her
  grandfather's confidence that somewhere in the world was a man who held in
  his possession the fortune he had stolen from his sometime friend. In some
  dark place this man skulked with his stolen treasure, hugging to his breast
  the millions which he could not use himself, and which in his avarice he
  refused to hand over to their lawful owner. She dozed into a fitful sleep and
  awoke suddenly. Somebody was trying the handle of her door, and the
  conductor's key had been inserted in the little slot. It could not be the
  Customs, because there were no frontiers to pass&mdash;so her brain told her.
  She touched the spring of the little repeater watch which was still upon her
  wrist; it chimed four; she could not have been asleep for a quarter of an
  hour. Slowly the door opened. The interior of the cabin was in darkness, and
  looking up she caught sight of the thick-set figure of a man.</p>

  <p>"Who is there?" she asked quickly, and reached out her hand for the light.
  Before she could touch the switch the man sprang back and the door closed
  with a sharp thud. She got up and pushed a little electric button which
  communicated with the conductor's quarters, and he came along, sleepy-eyed
  and resentful.</p>

  <p>No, he said, he had not been in the corridor, and no one else but himself
  could have had the master key which opened the door of the sleeping
  compartment even though the inmate had securely pushed down the catch.
  "Mademoiselle must have been dreaming," he smiled as politely as he could,
  for even the urbane conductor resents being called from the slumber which he
  steals in the course of his duty.</p>

  <p>"I was not dreaming," she said severely, but did not attempt to continue
  the argument.</p>

  <p>There was a merciful silence in the next compartment; at least that was
  something to be thankful for, and she lay down again, but not to sleep. She
  switched out her light to help her to the land of dreams, but sleep defied
  her. The train was running smoothly through the valley of the Rhone as she
  judged. In an hour and a half it would be daylight, and she would feel more
  secure. She was not unused to such common mistakes as are daily made under
  the circumstances, but she had a feeling that this was no mistake. The person
  who had opened the door had done so with felonious intent. There had been a
  number of robberies upon that line, and for this reason, if for no other, she
  felt justified in her perturbation. She had had a bad scare, and she was
  worried beyond all reason, so she told herself, but the fact that she had
  been wakened suddenly in the middle of the night seemed to her to be
  sufficient excuse. She was not destined to be dis­turbed again by this
  inquisitive stranger, and the next shock she was to experience came from a
  much more serious cause than the entry, either intentional or accidental, of
  an intruder. There was suddenly a wild staccato rattle of whistles from the
  engine, and the quick grind of brakes, which told the use of the emergency
  apparatus. The train slowed jarringly and then suddenly there was a crash,
  and the girl was half thrown from her bed to the floor of the carriage.
  Fortunately the electric light was not put out of gear. Her shaking hand
  sought the switch for the second time that night and the compartment was
  illumin­ated. She heard a quick rattling of doors as the alarmed sleepers
  sought to make their escape, and there was a heavy thud in the next
  compartment, almost simultaneous with the shock, which suggested that the
  occupant had been less fortunate than she, and had found the floor. Outside
  there was a babel of tongues talking in half a dozen languages, and she rose
  hurriedly, and drew tighter the dressing gown in which she was robed, and
  opened the door.</p>

  <p>The carriage, had not left the metals, whatever was the cause of the
  accident. As she stepped into the corridor the door of the next compartment
  opened, and a stout man, half dressed, dashed out, his wild, bloodshot eyes
  staring, under his arm a big, fat portfolio hugged close to his side. In
  frenzied tones he asked her something in a language which she could not
  understand, but which she recognised as Russian. She could only shake her
  head, for even had she been able to speak the language she could have given
  him no more information than he could give her. He dashed wildly to the end
  of the corridor on to the platform, and ran as wildly back. As he did so he
  slipped and half fell, dropping his portfolio. Even in her own agitation she
  was amused at his antics and stooped to pick it up. As she did so a letter
  fell out. He took the portfolio from her hand with a bewildered look. He had
  not seen the letter fall, but she had, and she stooped again, feeling
  strangely motherly to this terrified little man with his bright bald head and
  his great bushy beard. Her eyes fell carelessly upon the superscription and
  she gasped. She read the words in faded writing which she instantly
  recognised as that of her grandfather.</p><br>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center"><i>"The Malleable Glass Process.<br>
  The Property of George."</i></p><br>

  <p>Yes, here it was in her very hand, the one great desire of her life, the
  object for which the old man, her grandfather, had made thirty years of
  tireless search. Before she could realise the immensity of her discovery, the
  little man snatched it from her with a rapid flow of words which were
  doubtlessly meant to convey his thanks and his own embarrassment. Instantly
  he had dived back into his berth. Men were hurrying along the corridor; some
  half dressed, some in their pyjamas, they were un­doubtedly British; she saw
  a tall man, with a half smile in his eye, coming leisurely along the car
  towards her.</p>

  <p>"Can I be of any assistance?" he called to her across the intervening
  space between himself and her compartment. Could anybody be of any
  assistance? Could she by any means convey to him the vital necessity for
  recovering this envelope, the property of a perfect stranger? It was an
  absurd thought, and she realised how absurd it was as it flashed through her
  mind. She must find another way. She shook her head, being too full of her
  discovery to speak.</p>

  <p>"I should like&mdash;" began the man.</p>

  <p>He had got so far when there came a second crash, more terrifying than
  any, and the lights went out. The second portion of the Riviera express had
  run into the stationary train and in an instant everything was confusion. The
  girl groped blindly along the corridor. There were shouts and screams from
  the women passengers in the next coach, she heard a volley of imprecations in
  Russian from her next-door neighbour, she saw the quick flash of a pocket
  electric lamp and heard a wail as if somebody was in agony. Then a man rushed
  hastily past her. Something told her&mdash;she felt rather than
  saw&mdash;that this hurrying stranger was the man who had attempted to enter
  her compartment. Three minutes later, trembling in every limb, she had
  climbed down on to the metals, and stood surveying the wreckage. The express
  had, in the first instance, dashed into a level crossing gate which had been
  left open, and carried the heavy steel bar some distance along the metals,
  finally derailing itself in an attempt to crush this impertinent obstructor
  out of existence. The wreckage at the rear of the train was most serious. Two
  carriages had been telescoped and a passenger had been killed. Amidst the
  confusion she waited until she realised that there was no danger from either
  fire or from further collision. Fortunately her coach had been situated in
  the middle of the train and had not left the metals, even after the impact of
  the second collision. She climbed back again into the sleeping wagon and made
  her way to her own berth. The lights sprang up suddenly, for the conductor
  had dis­covered the breakage and had made a temporary repair. He came along,
  a big, comfortable man, assuring his nervous charges that there was no
  danger, and that they might dress in comfort.</p>

  <p>Mary President had not waited for this assurance, and was half dressed
  before he tapped at her door. In five minutes she was out again upon the
  line, amidst a group of her fellow passengers. One man, however, was missing.
  The stout little man with the bald head was not of the party. They were not
  to be deprived of his society for long, for presently he came from the far
  end of the train, bawling at the top of his voice, and his angry
  gesticulations were visible in the light from the car windows.</p>

  <p>"I have been robbed, robbed," he wailed in French. "I have been robbed, I
  tell you!"</p>

  <p>"Calm yourself, M'sieur," soothed the official to whom he spoke. "You will
  find everything as you have left it."</p>

  <p>"I have looked, I have searched everywhere," raved Monsieur Soltykoff,
  "everywhere, I tell you&mdash;my portfolio has been stolen, it has gone! It
  is priceless; it is worth three million francs."</p>

  <p>The girl gasped. She had thought of seizing the moment to search the man's
  cabin for that letter. Had she found it she would have taken it. In
  inten­tion she was a thief, and now she was glad that her timidity had
  prevented her yielding to the temptation.</p>

  <p>She saw a dark figure coming along the uneven surface of the permanent way
  to meet him.</p>

  <p>"Lost!" she heard the new comer saying in a cultivated English voice. "You
  don't mean that, Soltykoff?"</p>

  <p>"Lost, lost," wailed the man, "I tell you it has gone. I left it in my
  cabin, and now it has departed."</p>

  <p>She saw the little man, accompanied by the con­ductor, go back into the
  car. Through the window she could witness something of the search that was
  made; then two men behind her spoke, and she was grateful when she heard them
  that she had two Englishmen near her to whom she could appeal in case of
  need. It was very comforting, that sound of a homely English tongue, and it
  brought a little feeling of exhilaration to the girl and something of relief
  from the tension to which she had been subjected.</p>

  <p>"That is my old friend Soltykoff, unless I am mistaken," said the first,
  dryly.</p>

  <p>"That is the Soltykoff," agreed the second man. "He is the gentleman who
  kept us awake last night. I am almost inclined to say that it serves the
  beggar right."</p>

  <p>She recognised, in the voice of the second man, he of the smiling eyes who
  had spoken to her at the moment of the second collision.</p>

  <p>"I would not say that," drawled Milton Sands. "One never knows what
  provocation a man has who gets too much to drink, but judging from the fact
  that he had apparently a very large sum of money in his possession, the
  provocation in this case seems to be missing."</p>

  <p>The little man was back again; from the vantage-ground of the car platform
  he addressed the world in elegant, if excited, French.</p>

  <p>"My friends," he said, "I have been robbed! I do not know who has robbed
  me, but this I will tell you. For the money I have lost I do not care, but
  there was a dossier which is to me very im­portant. I will reward whosoever
  returns that to me handsomely."</p>

  <p>But his appeal was received in silence. If the thief were present and he
  heard, he was unmoved by the offer of reward.</p>

  <p>The formula was gone, and was not to see the light of day again until much
  had happened to change the lives of at least six of his hearers.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; WHEN ROGUES AGREE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Carlsburg Hotel, on the Avenue de l'Opéra, is an
  unpretentious hostel which caters for English people, a clientele which
  includes the best and the worst of the nation.</p>

  <p>Sir George Frodmere waited impatiently, walking up and down the
  sitting-room he had reserved, for the arrival of his two friends. They had
  gone to separate hotels for reasons of policy, and had indeed arrived in
  Paris by separate trains. They came at last, Wilton and Bud Kitson arriving
  almost simul­taneously, and Sir George closed the door behind them.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said sharply, and without any pre­liminary, "let us have a plain
  talk. Who has got the stuff?"</p>

  <p>"Search me," said Kitson.</p>

  <p>He was smoking the end of a cigar thoughtfully, eyeing the baronet with a
  look in which knowledge and suspicion were perfectly blended.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to tell me that you did not get it?" asked Sir George
  incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Get what?" demanded the man.</p>

  <p>"Get the portfolio?"</p>

  <p>"I got nothing," said Mr. Kitson definitely, "but I guess you did."</p>

  <p>The baronet's eyes narrowed. "I never saw it," he answered shortly. "Now
  let us have no humbug; we are too deep in a good many enterprises to play the
  fool. What do you know about this, Wilton?"</p>

  <p>"Me?" asked the outraged man. "What a question to ask. Do you imagine that
  I would act the part of a common thief? My dear man, it is&mdash;is
  disgraceful of you. All I know," he went on carefully, "is that you have some
  ridiculous idea which I thought was a joke. I never imagined that you
  contemplated stealing this man's money."</p>

  <p>Sir George laughed, and it was not a pleasant laugh to hear.</p>

  <p>"I think you are a little too mealy-mouthed," he said. "Understand me,
  Toady Wilton, I am not standing that sort of nonsense from you. You know we
  were after the stuff; one would imagine you had never been in a crooked thing
  in your life. I doubt very much whether you have ever been in a straight one.
  You are implicated, too, and you are not going to put your Sunday-school airs
  on with me, understand that once and for all. Did you get the swag?" he asked
  brutally.</p>

  <p>"No," said Mr. Wilton, with a sulky frown, "I did not."</p>

  <p>They stood for a moment in silence looking at one another.</p>

  <p>There was not one of the three who did not suspect the other two of being
  in collusion against him.</p>

  <p>"Somebody got it," said the baronet at last, with an ugly look.</p>

  <p>"I believe you," agreed Bud Kitson meaningly, and the elder man turned on
  him.</p>

  <p>"Damn you, you don't suspect me?" he roared.</p>

  <p>"I have heard of some wonderful things happening in this old continent,"
  said the American crook calmly, "and I shouldn't be having palpitation of the
  heart if I discovered that you had lifted the stuff."</p>

  <p>The situation was a strained one, and Sir George Frodmere knew too much to
  make it intolerable. He depended upon the help of these two men, and he knew
  that if either of them had the money, the only possible chance for him lay in
  keeping on friendly terms.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he did not lose it after all," he suggested hopefully.</p>

  <p>"He lost it all right," said Kitson, with a grim smile, "don't worry; that
  guy had the goods; I saw the portfolio. He held it under his arm and dropped
  it, and a girl in the next compartment picked it up and handed it to
  him."</p>

  <p>"Who was the girl?" asked Sir George suddenly. The American shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"Search me," he said laconically. "I guess I don't keep lag of all the
  girls I see."</p>

  <p>"It was a Miss President," said Toady Wilton, "the grand-daughter of old
  President."</p>

  <p>Sir George raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Not the race-horse owner?"</p>

  <p>"That is the man," replied the other.</p>

  <p>Sir George had no time to speculate upon the coincidence; he had arranged
  to meet Soltykoff that morning. His impatience at the non-arrival of his two
  companions had been due to this fact and his desire to see them before the
  other arrived. He explained to them the nature of the visit he was
  receiving.</p>

  <p>"I suppose he will back out now," lamented Toady Wilton.</p>

  <p>"Not he," said Sir George, with conviction. "He can afford to lose what he
  has lost a dozen times over, and then never feel it. You have no idea how
  rich some of these Russian merchants are. You will find he is just as keen,
  in fact, keener than ever, to make money."</p>

  <p>"Why does he trust you?" asked Wilton, walking up to the mantelshelf and
  selecting a cigar from a box.</p>

  <p>"He has good reason to trust me," said Sir George with a half-smile. "I
  piloted him through London society last year, and I saved him from being
  rooked of twelve thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>Wilton looked round, an unbelieving smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"I thought that would surprise you," said Sir George coolly. "It came
  about through that fellow Millington&mdash;the chap who was running the
  gambling house in Pimlico. Millington got him into his clutches and they were
  playing pretty high in those days. You wouldn't think that a sharp like
  Soltykoff could be rooked, but it is always the fly who is caught in these
  things. I strolled round and saw Millington," he went on reminiscently, "and
  asked him how much I stood in for, and Millington, like an ass, laughed in my
  face."</p>

  <p>"So you took Soltykoff away?" Wilton nodded approvingly.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Sir George.</p>

  <p>"But how do you calculate that you saved him twelve thousand pounds?"
  asked the other.</p>

  <p>"That was the amount he had with him," replied Sir George, "and if I know
  the Millington crowd, they would have taken the lot."</p>

  <p>At that moment a tap came at the door, and the servant announced M.
  Soltykoff. He looked pale and tired and was tremendously sober.
  Neverthe­less, he was not greatly depressed by his loss.</p>

  <p>In many ways he was an admirable little man, and if it was true, as it
  unquestionably was, that he financed most of the illicit schemes which the
  adventurers of Europe evolved, from gun-running in the Philippines to salt
  smuggling in China, it is also true of him that he had a large and jovial
  spirit, and that he had, if not the admiration of the recognised authorities
  of Europe, at least the heartfelt thanks of those adventurers who found that
  their lot was cast in pleasant places when they took service under his
  aegis.</p>

  <p>He only made a brief reference to his loss.</p>

  <p>"It is very unfortunate," he said, "but I am offering so large a reward
  that I think the property will be restored."</p>

  <p>"Was there much money?"</p>

  <p>"There was a very large sum," replied the other carelessly, "forty-five
  thousand pounds in your money. Fortunately I put a portion in my valise. But
  it is not that loss which distresses me so much as the loss of the formula.
  It is one of the most important discoveries in the world, and it is
  tempo­rarily lost."</p>

  <p>It was noticeable that when he was perfectly sober he spoke without any
  trace whatever of his foreign accent, without any of the eccentric
  con­structions of sentences which distinguished his more hilarious
  moments.</p>

  <p>"You read the formula, can't you remember it?" asked Sir George.</p>

  <p>Monsieur Soltykoff shook his head with a little smile. "I was not myself
  that night," he said frankly, "and I have so long made a point of never
  remembering the events of the previous night, that I cannot now summon memory
  to my aid. If I remembered the last nights of life," he added
  philosophically, "I should have died of shame many years ago."</p>

  <p>"Are you offering the reward publicly?"</p>

  <p>The other nodded.</p>

  <p>"In a sense, yes," he said. "As a matter of fact, I am advertising for it
  without disclosing its descrip­tion. It is no longer in its envelope, for
  some reason which I cannot explain&mdash;because I have forgotten&mdash;I
  tore the envelope off, but I do remember the inscription which was written on
  the envelope&mdash; though that won't help. It went this way," he
  recited:</p><br>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center"><i>"'The Malleable Glass Process.<br>
  The Property of George.'"</i></p><br>

  <p>"John President," gasped Sir George, with a new light in his eye. "By
  heavens! I think I know where your envelope is!"</p>

  <p>The other turned his startled face to the baronet. "You know?" he asked
  incredulously.</p>

  <p>"I am sure." said Sir George slowly. "What reward are you offering?"</p>

  <p>A little smile illuminated the round face of the Russian, and he waved his
  finger playfully at the other.</p>

  <p>"My friend," he said admiringly, "you are an opportunist. The reward," he
  went on seriously, "is one of forty thousand pounds, which is exactly twice
  the amount the formula originally cost me, and it was worth every
  rouble."</p>

  <p>"Forty thousand pounds," said Sir George half to himself. "Do you know who
  was in the next compartment to yourself?"</p>

  <p>"That I did not inquire," replied the Russian, with elaborate sarcasm. "I
  do not leave my card upon my neighbours on the Wagon-lit."</p>

  <p>"It was John President's grand-daughter," said Sir George, slowly and
  impressively, "and if you bought it from him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I did not," said the Russian, shaking his head, but his brows were knit
  in thought. "I bought it from a man whom I have every reason to believe stole
  it from its original owner. John President's grand-daughter?" he repeated,
  striving to recall the incidents of the night. "I wonder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," he said, striking his forehead in his excitement, "I remember,
  I dropped my portfolio and the letter slipped out and she had it in her hand.
  It was she!" He strolled excitedly up and down the apartment. "Where is she
  now?" he asked rapidly. "Is she in Paris? Is she in London?"</p>

  <p>"She came on by my train," said Sir George. "I saw her, a very pretty
  girl, rather dark and slim, well shaped, the sort of girl that interested
  me."</p>

  <p>He stroked his moustache thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I doubt," he said, "if she is in Paris now; she is probably in London,
  but I can soon find out. I can get on to the telephone to my servant and tell
  him to make some inquiries."</p>

  <p>"I shall have a warrant," said the little Russian energetically. "I shall
  inform the police."</p>

  <p>"If you do, you are mad," interrupted Sir George. "What do you think,
  Toady?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Toady had been an unhappy and a frankly bored member of the audience. He
  felt that in this scheme, at any rate, he had no part. His forte was the
  thoroughbred race-horse. In all schemes and con­spiracies and coups which
  affected that noble animal he was quite at home. The less subtle method of
  robbery, the bull in the china shop method, as he characterised it
  scornfully, though he was at pains to keep his opinions to himself, was not
  for him.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bud Kitson, as usual a silent and interested fourth, found an excuse
  to include himself in the conversation.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with getting the stuff from the girl?" he asked. "Never
  mind about the police."</p>

  <p>"By Jove, that is an idea!" said Sir George.</p>

  <p>He looked at the other narrowly.</p>

  <p>"That is not at all a bad idea," he repeated. "Do you think you can do
  it?"</p>

  <p>"If she has got it&mdash;sure!" replied the obliging Bud.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of that, M. Soltykoff?" Soltykoff looked at Bud
  dubiously.</p>

  <p>"I don't care how I get it," he said, "so long as I get it. I am willing
  to pay a big price, you under­stand. The money that was stolen you are at
  liberty to take as your reward."</p>

  <p>The eyes of Bud Kitson gleamed for a moment with unnatural light.</p>

  <p>"Of course," interposed Sir George hastily, "in the event of our scheme
  being successful, the reward will be distributed in proper proportion amongst
  us all."</p>

  <p>A slow smile came to the square-jawed crook. "It will be distributed in
  proper proportion all right," he said confidently, and his tone suggested
  that his view of a division might not coincide with that of the baronet.</p>

  <p>"Now let us go to the other business," said Sir George, and a few minutes
  later they were gathered round the table discussing what was to be the coup
  of the century.</p>

  <p>There are some people who are privileged to enjoy a local reputation.
  There are others who have a wider sphere of personal influence, and their
  names come to be loosely described as "household words." This is possibly a
  pardonable exaggeration, meaning that at reasonable and flattering intervals
  their names have occurred either in the course of conver­sation or at the
  inevitable discussion which follows the reading of a Sunday newspaper.</p>

  <p>To say that M. Jean Soltykoff was known through­out Europe would be but to
  speak the truth. Though Soltykoff was a great manufacturer, he knew little or
  nothing about the articles he produced or the methods by which they were
  prepared for public consumption, always excepting from this category the
  glass business which was the basis of his fortune.</p>

  <p>He was an exploiter, a financier who had earned for himself the execration
  of more than one of the European chancelleries, for he was catholic in his
  tastes and quite indiscriminate in the distribution of his finances. It did
  not matter to him whether the scheme which he was at the moment exploiting
  benefited his country or afforded lasting injury so long as he derived a
  percentage of profit from the transaction.</p>

  <p>He bought and sold Portuguese Concessions with no greater ostentation than
  he bought and sold moth-eaten clothing for use in the Czar's army during the
  disastrous war with Japan. He favoured any transaction which had a shady side
  to it, and for this reason as gladly welcomed the plan which Bud Kitson had
  suggested as he did the scheme which Sir George was now laying before him. He
  had no desire to court publicity, he had no desire to drag into the fierce
  light which beats upon the record of all great losses the fact that he had
  negotiated for the purchase of an important process without having troubled
  to discover its lawful owner. But Kitson's method was the best. He found
  himself looking at the tough man from New York with an added interest.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Milton Sands, who knew all the people of Europe who were
  under suspicion, gave a brief sketch of Soltykoff in the Pullman between
  Dover and Charing Cross, and Eric Stanton listened with interest and with
  amusement.</p>

  <p>"By the way," he said, as the train went thunder­ing through Tonbridge, "I
  did not help you to a choice of a profession."</p>

  <p>"I think I have decided without any assistance," he said. "That robbery on
  the train gave me quite a fine idea. I am going to be a detective," he said
  complacently.</p>

  <p>Eric Stanton looked at the other in surprise.</p>

  <p>"A detective," he repeated.</p>

  <p>"That is the profession for me," said Milton Sands, with confidence, "a
  nice, easy, honest, disreputable way of earning a living. I think I am cut
  out for a detective," he said modestly, "and the thought has occurred to me
  more strongly since the robbery. It is a profession which offers scope to the
  young and to the adventurous. Here is old Soltykoff offering forty thousand
  pounds reward; a million francs, think of it! Isn't it sufficient to enthuse
  a man without a profession? And not only enthuse him, but help him make up
  his mind at a critical juncture when crossing-sweeper and pick­pocket are the
  only two professions which seem to offer an opening. Forty thousand! It is a
  reward worth going after. I have just that trick of unscrupulousness which
  will enable me to shine."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever done that sort of work before?" asked the amused Eric.</p>

  <p>"In a way, I have," said the other seriously. "You see I was in the
  mounted police force in Australia. It did not give one much scope for the
  exercise of one's powers of detecting modern crime committed by criminals of
  a very high order of intelligence, but it did help one to use one's wits and
  utilise one's eyes."</p>

  <p>They said no more until the train was running through the outskirts of
  London, then Eric Stanton asked quietly: "Do you seriously mean that you are
  going to be a private detective?"</p>

  <p>The other looked at him a little surprised.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "why not?"</p>

  <p>"There is no reason why you shouldn't," said Stanton, "but it occurred to
  me that if you did seriously take up the work we might be of mutual
  assistance to one another. You see, Sands, I rather like you. I recognise
  most of your bad qualities, if I might use that word."</p>

  <p>"I would rather you did," said Milton; "it strengthens me in the belief
  that you are beginning to know me."</p>

  <p>"I recognise all these," Eric went on, "and I recognise something more,
  something which, per­haps, you would not be ready to admit of yourself,
  namely, a broad honesty of purpose and a loyalty which is very rare in these
  days. In other words, I think I could trust you, completely and wholly,
  Milton Sands."</p>

  <p>The tall man flushed, and he turned his kindling eyes on the other.</p>

  <p>"That is one of the nicest things that has been said to me," he said
  quietly, "and believe me, I appreciate it. Yes, you can depend upon me so far
  as loyalty to my friends is concerned."</p>

  <p>Eric Stanton nodded.</p>

  <p>"I know that, and I want to give you your first commission. I don't know
  why you have decided to be a private detective, but I am perfectly sure of
  one thing&mdash;that you are the very man to do the work I want."</p>

  <p>"Hold hard," said the other, raising his hand. "Just hear me before you go
  any farther. I do not intend being an ordinary detective, I am going to be a
  Turf agent. I love racing as much as you do. The Turf in this country is
  pretty clean, but there is room for a man who sets himself out to discover
  something more vital to the interest of the Turf than the finding of winners.
  I am prepared to accept work outside, but that is one of the jobs I am going
  to tackle; I am going to be the Turf detective; the idea pleases me."</p>

  <p>"I don't care what you call yourself," smiled Eric, "or what you do, but
  the work I want you for has no connection with the race-course, or with the
  interests, good or bad, of the Turf. I would ask you to come up and see me
  to-morrow," he said, "but I may be going out of town. I think I have time to
  tell you what I want you to do now, and let me say here, that I am prepared
  to pay you very handsomely, and to allow you in the course of your
  investigations a substantial sum for expenses."</p>

  <p>"That," said Milton, "appeals to me immensely. Now go right ahead."</p>

  <p>He took the cigar which Eric offered him, bit off the end and lit it, and
  with his elbows on the table he leant forward, as the other, after some
  hesitation, began:</p>

  <p>"You probably may not know that my father and my mother quarrelled when I
  was a boy. The cause of that quarrel I have never been able to get at, save
  that my father, who was a very quick­tempered man, made an accusation against
  my mother which he regretted to the last day of his life."</p>

  <p>He hesitated again.</p>

  <p>"We can talk," he said, "not only as men of the world, but, I trust, as
  friends."</p>

  <p>Sands nodded.</p>

  <p>"You may trust me," he said. "Whatever may be the outcome of this
  conversation, I will not repeat what I hear."</p>

  <p>Eric smiled a little sadly.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately," he said, "I need not put that injunction upon you,
  because the story is known to all the people in society who count, only I
  have never told it before. My father's accusation was against my mother's
  honour; he even went so far as to say that my baby sister was not his child,
  a terrible charge to make against a sensitive and high-spirited woman. My
  mother resented it in the only way that a woman could: she left his house,
  taking the child with her, and from that day she has never been seen."</p>

  <p>His voice trembled a little.</p>

  <p>"All we know," he went on, "is that she died some years ago, long after my
  father had passed from this life, and that my sister is still living; and,
  probably acting under instructions from my mother, refusing to take any
  notice of the advertise­ments which from time to time we place in the
  newspapers. I want you to find her."</p>

  <p>"Did your father ever discover how much truth there was in his
  suspicions?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the young man in a low voice, "he discovered that he had been
  the victim either of extraordinary circumstances or of a most foul plot. The
  man he suspected was Lord Chanderson; you possibly know his name, one of the
  most upright men on the Turf, a steward of the Jockey Club, and a gentleman
  of unimpeachable character. He and my mother were friends. A hotel register,
  showing my mother and Lord Chanderson staying together at a small hotel in
  Paris, was the evidence upon which my father made his ghastly mistake. As a
  matter of fact, my mother was staying at the hotel, but Lord Chanderson at
  that time was in Petrograd; he was attached to the embassy there as
  chancellor or something of that sort. Somebody had certainly stayed at the
  hotel and had forged his name on the register. That is the whole of a story
  which is very painful to me, as you can well imagine."</p>

  <p>"What data have you to go on?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever," replied Eric. "I have em­ployed I don't know how many
  people to try and discover my sister's whereabouts. The newspaper which
  published the announcement of my mother's death could give me no further
  information than that they had received a letter conveying the news and
  enclosing a postal order for its insertion. From the fact that the postal
  order had been dated almost two years before my mother's death, and was in
  consequence out of date, we gathered that she had made this preparation to
  announce to the world her retirement from a life which had been filled with
  bitter memories. It is not for me to condemn my father," he went on. "I could
  not reproach him any more bitterly than he reproached himself. It is a
  horrible tragedy, and it has been a shadow over my life."</p>

  <p>"There is very little to go upon," said Sands thoughtfully, "but if you
  don't mind I will call round as soon as you are back in town with any
  questions which have occurred to me in the mean­time. We can then arrange the
  purely business side of our association."</p>

  <p>They shook hands at parting. Eric Stanton's car was waiting, but the other
  refused the offer of a lift, and claiming his baggage, he hailed a taxi and
  was driven westward.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; JOHN PRESIDENT WINS</h2>

  <p class="first">"THERE comes the Dean!"</p>

  <p>A thousand voices took up the cry.</p>

  <p>There was a roar which began faintly in the cheaper rings down the course
  and grew' in volume, swell­ing to a very thunder of voices as the field came
  flashing up the straight.</p>

  <p>Three horses, neck to neck, ran clear of the ruck, but it was the fourth,
  with his great, clumsy feet flogging the turf, his wild, red mane flying in
  the breeze, upon whom all eyes were fixed.</p>

  <p>On the outside, making as it seemed a solitary way homeward, the Dean had
  drawn clear of beaten horses, and with a very awkward lurch he drew to the
  leaders.</p>

  <p>"The Dean&mdash;for a pony!"</p>

  <p>One clear voice rose above the babble.</p>

  <p>Nearer and nearer they came, and Mahon with his beautiful hands was
  pushing the favourite. He took a quick look round and saw the danger.</p>

  <p>Once, twice, his whip came up and down, but the Dean was gradually drawing
  up to him and boy Childers was crouching with his head almost level with the
  old gelding's neck.</p>

  <p>Twenty yards from the post Battling Jerry faltered and swerved. Mahon
  snatched him up and steadied him again&mdash;but too late. The post was
  passed with the Dean's ugly old nose just showing in front.</p>

  <p>"Phew!&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Eric Stanton wiped his forehead.</p>

  <p>"What a race!" he said.</p>

  <p>His handsome face was flushed and alight with the excitement of the
  moment.</p>

  <p>"Damn the Dean!" growled the man at his side.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"I thought Jerry would just do it," said the other. Toady Wilton, with his
  puffed face and his black rimmed monocle, was an authority on what horses
  should "just do," and it cost him a lot of money.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said the young man reflectively, "it wasn't any certainty
  for Jerry&mdash;and I loved to see the old Dean pull out that last
  effort."</p>

  <p>The other glanced up at the cheerful face.</p>

  <p>"Of course, Mr. Stanton," he agreed, "if you think so nothing more need be
  said; as you're the owner of Jerry the last word is with you&mdash;but I wish
  it had been the other way about."</p>

  <p>Eric lost Wilton in the paddock.</p>

  <p>Clew, the trainer, was watching the unsaddling of his colt when he made
  his way through the sauntering throng to the enclosure.</p>

  <p>"Thought we were going to win, sir," said the trainer, "but we were
  squarely beaten&mdash;Jerry was game enough, but he couldn't quite get the
  last fifty yards under pressure. Mahon said he was a beaten horse at the
  distance and only his gameness brought him so close."</p>

  <p>"I'll stand on Mahon's judgment," said Eric, "it was a fine race."</p>

  <p>He looked around.</p>

  <p>"Where is Mr. President?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The trainer smiled.</p>

  <p>"It's funny how the old gentleman keeps the Dean going&mdash;why the old
  horse must be ten years old if he's a day."</p>

  <p>"Somehow these Australians manage things with horses," said Eric. "I'm not
  speaking disparagingly of you, Clew," he smiled quickly.</p>

  <p>"I understand, sir," said the man quietly. "I take off my hat to old Mr.
  President, anyway; he's done wonders with the Dean."</p>

  <p>At that moment Eric caught sight of the man of whom they were talking, and
  elbowed his way through the press to where he stood alone.</p>

  <p>It was a remarkable figure that Eric Stanton saw</p>

  <p>John President was eighty years of age at that time. He stood six feet
  four inches and was as straight of back and carried his head as high as a
  soldier of twenty.</p>

  <p>A snowy-white beard fell half way to his waist, and under the big,
  curly-brimmed grey topper a luxuriant bunch of white hair showed. His face
  was strong and seamed with innumerable tiny lines. It was healthy and
  brown&mdash;that brown which spoke of a life spent in the sunshine. He saw
  Eric coming toward him and a little smile twinkled in blue eyes that,
  undimmed by age, sparkled with the joyousness of life under his shaggy white
  eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Mr. Stanton!" He laughed a deep and melodious laugh. "We beat
  you&mdash;I'm really sorry in a way, and I'm really overjoyed&mdash;in
  another way."</p>

  <p>Eric took the extended hand and felt a grip which made him wince.</p>

  <p>"It was a fine performance, sir," he said, "and it is marvellous to think
  that that old horse is trained by you and it is the only horse you have."</p>

  <p>"It is one of the only two horses I have," corrected the other, that gleam
  of amusement in his eyes. "But he's a regular stableful is the Dean."</p>

  <p>He spoke with a certain slowness, but with vigour.</p>

  <p>"They think I'm a freak," he jerked his head in the direction of the
  crowd, "and some of 'em would think it would be high treason for an old
  Australian to go to Ascot and win the Royal Hunt Cup with an old horse that
  ain't so beautiful to look at&mdash;no," he reflected, "the Dean ain't an
  Ascot horse in looks&mdash;but when Ascot comes round you'll see!"</p>

  <p>"He's an Ascot horse in his gallop, anyway," smiled Eric.</p>

  <p>"He's my third hope," said the old man quietly. "I bank on the
  Dean&mdash;and the other two. Some day they'll give me my heart's
  desire."</p>

  <p>Eric looked at Mr. President curiously. He spoke with such feeling and the
  phrase he employed was so unusual. What could be the heart's desire of this
  old man who had reached a period of life when most men had done with all the
  desire of this world?</p>

  <p>The other did not enlighten him, and after standing chatting with the old
  gentleman&mdash;it seemed absurd to think of him in these terms, he was so
  young in heart&mdash;Eric moved off to find his guests.</p>

  <p>It was the first Kempton meeting of the year, and although the season was
  young and the day a bank holiday, glorious Easter weather had tempted society
  out of doors in unusual numbers.</p>

  <p>The tea room, whither he made his way, was thronged, and it was with
  difficulty that he found a seat. Opposite was sitting a girl who was
  apparently without escort. She was very beautiful, he thought, with her great
  dark eyes, her milk-and-rose com­plexion, and all the beauty of budding
  womanhood in her graceful figure. Her features were exquisitely moulded, the
  nose straight and the mouth rich and full. The chin perfectly modelled, the
  neck graciously set, and the mass of hair which showed from under her small,
  black velvet turban went to make up as lovely a picture of ripening girlhood
  as he had ever seen.</p>

  <p>He had an irritating sense of having met her before. Suddenly their eyes
  met, and he remembered.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," he said, "aren't you Miss President?"</p>

  <p>She smiled and nodded.</p>

  <p>"We were fellow-sufferers in a railway disaster, I think," he said.</p>

  <p>"Of course," she nodded pleasantly, "I remember your voice. You were
  standing behind me when M. Soltykoff was lamenting his loss."</p>

  <p>He saw a little shadow cross her face and wondered what memory had caused
  that half frown. In a few moments they were chatting as though they had known
  one another for years. He had the quality which made for quick friendship or
  quick dislikes. Himself a quick judge of human nature he expected to and was
  satisfied to be instinctively accepted or rejected by his acquaintance.</p>

  <p>So deep they were in their conversation, that they did not notice the
  general exodus from the room till the ringing of the bell, which announced
  that the field had started on its homeward journey, recalled them with a
  start to the fact that they were missing the racing.</p>

  <p>"I'm awfully sorry," she smiled&mdash;she had the sweetest, dearest smile
  of any woman he had ever seen&mdash;"but I'm keeping you?"</p>

  <p>"No, no," he declared vehemently. "I'd rather&mdash;I mean I have no
  interest in any more races to-day; will you walk round the paddock?" She
  nodded and gathered up her dainty belongings.</p>

  <p>"We shall probably meet my grandfather," she said. It was half an excuse
  to herself for her sudden liking for this good-looking young man's
  society.</p>

  <p>As they made a move, a man came through the door. He took off his hat with
  a sweeping bow, and the girl nodded coldly.</p>

  <p>"Do you know Sir George Frodmere?" asked the young man.</p>

  <p>"He knows us," was the cryptic reply, "and he professes an intense
  admiration for my grandfather, and of late his attention has been most
  flattering; I find him a little&mdash;unwholesome." She took some time to
  find the word, then she said quickly: "I hope that I am not speaking
  disrespectfully of a friend of yours?"</p>

  <p>Eric laughed. "He is most decidedly not a friend of mine," he said dryly.
  "He knows that I object very strongly to his very existence."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a smile.</p>

  <p>"And that peculiar looking friend of his, Mr. Wilton, who is always with
  him. He is a friend of yours, I know, because I saw you on the stand
  together."</p>

  <p>She bit her lip and coloured pink. If there was one thing in the world she
  did not want to do it was to admit that Mr. Eric Stanton's movements
  inter­ested her in the slightest degree, or that she had been aware of his
  corporeal existence till she had met him at tea.</p>

  <p>It was a singularly flattered young man who walked by her side, striving
  with no greater success than his companion to check, by the sheer exercise of
  will power, the flush that came to his cheeks.</p>

  <p>She noted the colour out of the corner of her eyes, and was at once angry
  with herself that she had so brazenly flattered him (as she described her
  action to herself) and pleased that he could so blush.</p>

  <p>They strolled across the wide paddock, their feet sunk in the lush
  grasses, chatting and laughing.</p>

  <p>Milton Sands, his inevitable cigar between his teeth, saw them and grinned
  sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"There's a wonderful sight, Miss Symonds," he said solemnly.</p>

  <p>His companion was a tall girl, slight of figure and graceful of carriage.
  Her face was flushed with excitement and her eyes shone from the very delight
  of youth. She was simply, even plainly dressed, in striking contrast to the
  many beautiful confections which filled the paddock. It was not difficult to
  believe that Janet Symonds was poor, though she carried the cheap little
  ready-made dress with all the dignity of the finest lady there.</p>

  <p>"Where&mdash;where?" she asked eagerly. It was the first time she had ever
  been to a race meeting, and everything was wonderful, though she was quite
  prepared to believe that some things were more wonderful than others.</p>

  <p>"I allude less to the equine wonders of the age," said Milton oracularly,
  "than to that most wonder­ful of all sights&mdash;the way of a man with a
  maid." She laughed, a rich ripple of happy laughter, as she followed the
  direction of his outstretched finger.</p>

  <p>"It was kind of you to bring me here," she said, and he saw the thanks in
  her eyes. "I love it all, though I've no doubt it is very wicked. Somehow, I
  didn't mind coming with you&mdash;you're so different."</p>

  <p>"That is my great point," he explained elaborately. "I am different."</p>

  <p>"No, no&mdash;I'm not joking; you're different to all the people I've
  worked for," she said, surveying him with her grave eyes, "you've been always
  kind; I thought Colonial men were rather horrid."</p>

  <p>"That is because you were a self-satisfied, narrow­minded little pig," he
  said inelegantly but severely, "and the longer I know you&mdash;and I've
  known you for two years&mdash;the more perfectly porcine I think you were.
  Didn't I take you from a horrible lawyer's office where they paid you
  twenty-five shillings per week for typing their beastly 'whereases' and
  'hereinafters' and make you a private secretary to the most famous private
  detective in the world&mdash;doubling&mdash; so to speak&mdash;your very
  privacy&mdash;didn't I?"</p>

  <p>He saw the tears in her eyes, and was aghast. "Don't be an ass, oh, my
  fair child!" he begged. "I was only pulling you&mdash;only joking with
  you."</p>

  <p>"I thought you were serious," she pouted. "I don't like being
  lectured."</p>

  <p>"You're an exasperating young female," said Milton. "Remember that you are
  the junior partner of the great Sands Detective Agency, and be
  professional."</p>

  <p>"Shall we disguise ourselves," she asked demurely. He nodded, his laughing
  eyes watching her approvingly.</p>

  <p>"Let us disguise ourselves as thirsty race-goers, and invade the
  tea-rooms," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Let's," said she.</p>

  <p>Two years had passed since Milton Sands had rescued a scared child from
  the envenomed tongue of a landlady. A soldier of fortune, Milton had fallen
  upon a particularly bad patch (it was after the Blackest Ascot of a decade)
  and had reduced his style from the noble suite of the Rex Imperial Hotel to a
  small room in Charlesbury Mansions, Pimlico, for which he paid the inadequate
  sum of eight shillings a week. A fellow lodger had been Janet Symonds, who at
  that time had reached the laborious stage of typewriting tuition where
  fingers cease to pay the slightest attention to the brain and insist upon
  going their own sweet way.</p>

  <p>Poor Janet, with her ten shillings a week paid her regularly by the public
  trustee to whose care her mother had confided her savings, had found herself
  in arrears with her rent, and a virago of a landlady had come to demand
  payment, and reached the most interesting part of her speech when a tall,
  pleasant young man had intruded himself into the apartment and taken a wholly
  unauthorised part in the discussion. If it was unauthorised it was mercifully
  brief. He had taken the red-faced mistress of the house on to the landing,
  had paid the girl's arrears of rent, and had in his own hard, bitter, and
  scarifying language reduced the worthy woman to a dazed silence.</p>

  <p>There began the friendship of the pair, a friend­ship which was not
  distinguished by any demand on his part or uneasiness on hers. He made her
  move into a girl's club and touted for a situation on her behalf. He it was
  who found the "horribly lawyer"&mdash;who wasn't so horrible, and was, in
  fact, Milton's own solicitor. There were happy, spend­thrift days when he
  resumed his suite at the Rex Imperial; gloomy and penurious periods when it
  was Pimlico or nothing. He took life as he found it, for he was a gambler in
  all senses.</p>

  <p>Now he was a real detective, with a handsome furnished office in Regent
  Street&mdash;all grey hangings and mauve carpets and satin-wood furniture,
  with a little room adjoining for his secretary.</p>

  <p>"I shall want you to help me with the case of Mr. Stanton's sister," he
  said, on their way to town that evening. "I've an idea you might secure
  information which is denied to me."</p>

  <p>"I will do my best," she said, looking up to his face with a troubled
  expression. "I thought, per­haps, we might start by instituting inquiries in
  Pimlico."</p>

  <p>He groaned.</p>

  <p>"Not Pimlico," he begged. "There isn't such a place as Pimlico. London is
  Regent Street and the Rex Imperial, and all the rest is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped suddenly.</p>

  <p>"All the rest is?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"Heaven," he answered glibly,</p>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; THE TURF DETECTIVE</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE were very few callers at the offices of Sands
  Detective Agency. Milton did not advertise, he preferred (he told the
  enterprising young advertising canvassers who came to force him into reckless
  expenditure) to keep his practice select.</p>

  <p>"We have kings and queens in this office almost every day," he said,
  looking at the young man before him, who sat impressed but flippant.</p>

  <p>"Don't you have the aces, too?" he asked earnestly.</p>

  <p>"Get fresh with me, Bertie," warned Milton, with his ugliest little smile,
  "and I drop you out of the window on to the illuminated sign of the dentist
  in the shop downstairs."</p>

  <p>He chuckled joyfully as the canvasser departed.</p>

  <p>"It's rum he should guess how we spend the afternoon," he said, as he
  produced a pack of cards from his desk. "What shall it be, piquet or
  bezique?"</p>

  <p>"Piquet," said Janet promptly, and searched her desk for the chocolates
  she had hidden.</p>

  <p>"At ten pounds a hundred and a pony on the rubber?" suggested Milton.</p>

  <p>"At a penny a thousand," she decided.</p>

  <p>"We'll pretend it's the higher figure," he urged. "I should lose my nerve
  if I wasn't playing for money&mdash;cut!&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Their game was to remain unfinished, for scarcely had they begun when a
  gentle tap came at the outer office door, and Milton concealed his cards
  hastily and Janet made a dive for her typewriter and was tapping at a
  tremendous rate when M. Soltykoff came in at Milton's loud invitation.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Sands?" he asked doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"That is us," said Milton. "Sit down M. Soltykoff."</p>

  <p>"You know my name, then&mdash;you have seen me before?" smiled the
  Russian, almost purring with pleasure.</p>

  <p>"As a detective," said Milton profoundly. "I make it my business to know
  everybody in the world&mdash;with the exception of a few people living in
  Pimlico. I know you, at any rate, M. Soltykoff," he said grimly, "from your
  association with the purchase and shipment of arms for the Philippine
  insurrectionaries&mdash;from the fact that you financed the counter
  revolution in China, and are popularly supposed to have had something to do
  with the stealing of the crown jewels."</p>

  <p>The Russian laughed.</p>

  <p>"Rumour is a swift liar," he said. "The truth about myself is that I am a
  rich man and have earned the envy of the poor, and since it is easier to
  invent a story than a process, I attract all the inventors of the world to my
  unworthy self."</p>

  <p>He took the chair the other offered.</p>

  <p>"I saw your advertisement in the Matin&mdash;a little more than three
  weeks ago," said Milton seriously, "and that is why I have communicated with
  you. Now, I will tell you very candidly, M. Soltykoff, that my present
  business is a new one to me, although I am only exercising the faculties in
  myself which are as old as I. I have a pretty extensive acquaintance with the
  swell gangs which work the Riviera trains."</p>

  <p>"These I do not suspect," interrupted the other. "I think the theft was an
  accidental one; in other words, I have a suspicion that I know the thief."
  Milton looked at the man keenly.</p>

  <p>"So do I," he said quietly. "But tell me just whom you suspect."</p>

  <p>Soltykoff hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure that I am going to employ you yet," he said cautiously.</p>

  <p>Milton laughed a little scornfully.</p>

  <p>"You may please yourself as to that," he said shortly. "I shall not beg
  you to accept my offer&mdash;only I tell you that nobody in England is more
  likely to afford you assistance than I."</p>

  <p>He said this in such a tone of quiet confidence that the man was
  impressed.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said after a pause. "You can try."</p>

  <p>"Now," said Milton briskly, "just tell me the exact character of your
  loss, and why your suspicions fall upon anybody in particular. First of
  all"&mdash;he drew a pad and pencil to him&mdash;"describe the wallet."</p>

  <p>"It was of black Russia leather," said the other; "an ordinary limp
  portfolio&mdash;about half a metre long and a quarter deep. It was made up of
  four compartments, and had my initials in Russian character on the flap."</p>

  <p>Milton scribbled quickly.</p>

  <p>"It contained the greater part of a million francs in French banknotes of
  five and ten thousand francs each&mdash;as to these I do not care so much.
  There was in addition half a dozen sheets of foolscap fastened together and
  headed with the words 'The Formula.' They were originally in an envelope, but
  at the moment of the collision I dropped the envelope and it was picked up by
  a young lady," he spoke slowly and impressively&mdash;"that young lady I
  suspect, why, I will not tell you. As soon as she handed me the envelope I
  took it to my compartment and, realising that there was a good reason why the
  envelope bearing its description should not exist, I took the papers out of
  their cover and stuffed the formula into my portfolio."</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me the inscription?" asked Milton.</p>

  <p>The man shook his head. He had recognised the necessity for destroying
  even the most remote evidence of former ownership. It would only add to his
  difficulties were he to advertise the name of John President, especially now
  that he knew that John President was a real person, and might con­ceivably
  have instigated the robbery.</p>

  <p>"I can only tell you the name of the lady," he said. "It was Mary
  President, and I have reason to believe that the packet is now in her
  possession."</p>

  <p>For a moment Milton Sands did not answer. Then, "I think you are wrong,"
  he said. "But if you leave the matter in my hands I will see what I can do. I
  suppose you want the thief trapped?"</p>

  <p>M. Soltykoff smiled.</p>

  <p>"Naturally&mdash;if the thief herself or himself restores the papers...."
  He did not conclude the sentence, but his shrug was impressive.</p>

  <p>"He stands a precious poor chance of getting the reward, eh?" said Milton.
  "Marked money and hidden detectives to hear his disgusting confession."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Sands," said the Russian, admiringly, "you are a man of
  intelligence."</p>

  <p>Milton Sands tapped his desk with his pencil thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"So far as I can make out, and naturally I have done a little private
  investigation on my own before you came," he said, "there were travelling by
  your train in addition to Miss President, the following bad
  characters&mdash;Bud Kitson, Sir George Frodmere, Mr. Toady Wilton, Tom
  Sench&mdash;the Australian bank robber&mdash;Black Boyd, the New York
  confidence man, and quite a galaxy of criminal beauty."</p>

  <p>"How did you find that out?" asked the astounded Russian;</p>

  <p>Milton smiled knowingly, but offered no explana­tion. He had seen these
  gentlemen himself, but he did not think it wise to say that he was on the
  wrecked train.</p>

  <p>M. Soltykoff rose to go.</p>

  <p>"Your face is rather familiar to me," he said.</p>

  <p>"Is it?" drawled the other. "Well, do you know, I think there is every
  reason why it should be. Ten years ago an exceedingly wealthy young
  Austra­lian might have been seen entering the portals of a private gambling
  club in Nice. He was exceedingly wealthy for him, because he had struck it
  rich in Western Australia, and he had all the money in the world&mdash;namely
  some £40,000. He gambled all the night with an affable Russian nobleman, and
  his most affable confederates, and in the end he left the club with about ten
  cents net."</p>

  <p>Soltykoff looked at the young man in amazement, then burst into a roar of
  laughter.</p>

  <p>"Fortunes of war, mon," he chuckled. "I remember&mdash;you were very
  bumptious&mdash;and the game was fair, of course."</p>

  <p>"Of course," agreed Milton, as he showed his visitor out. "Of course," he
  reflected, as he heard the whirr of the lift carrying the man to the street.
  He shook his fist playfully after the unconscious Russian.</p>

  <p>"Look out for me, my Soltykoff," he said cheer­fully, "for if I do not
  find your precious formula, you will at least discover my bill."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; JANET GOES TO TEA</h2>

  <p class="first">"THAT'S rum," said Milton, looking up from a newspaper he
  was reading.</p>

  <p>The girl who was sitting at a little table behind him, parting press
  cuttings into a book, looked round. "What is it that is rum?" she asked.</p>

  <p>It was the second rum thing he had discovered to-day; it was rum that a
  convict whose escape from Portland had excited public interest should
  (accord­ing to his published portrait) bear a striking resem­blance to Bud
  Kitson.</p>

  <p>"Listen," said Milton, and read:</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">"Amongst the visitors to the Alvarez stud last week was
  Sir George Frodmere, the famous English sporting baronet. It is understood
  that Sir George made some extensive purchases of blood-stock, including El
  Rey, that magnificent thoroughbred who won the Grand Prize at Rio in record
  time last season. The price paid is not to be disclosed, but it is understood
  to be a very large one. Sir George made the purchase on behalf of a
  well-known Russian sportsman, and the horse is to be sent at once to the stud
  near Moscow."</p><br>

  <p>He read the paragraph slowly, because he had to translate it from Spanish
  to English.</p>

  <p>"That is very rum," he said again, shaking his head. "Old Frodmere must
  have gone straight on from London to the Argentine, and I presume he is now
  on his way back again. The Russian gentleman is M. Soltykoff, or I am a
  Dutchman."</p>

  <p>About his desk were a number of volumes. He carefully selected one and
  brought it down. It was a record of Argentine racing, and he turned over the
  leaves of the index.</p>

  <p>"Here we are," he said. "El Rey, by Diamond Jubilee&mdash;Manata a three-
  year-old. That will make him a four-year-old," he said, as he looked at the
  date of the reference, "ran eight times and won six of his races. I wonder
  what Soltykoff's idea is for buying the horse in his prime and sending him
  away to the stud. He never struck me as being an enthusiastic breeder," he
  mused, "and why should Sir George have gone over?"</p>

  <p>He closed the book and replaced it on the shelf. He was very thoughtful
  that morning, and spent most of his time consulting various books of sporting
  reference. He had read the paragraph in an obscure Argentine journal,
  published in a small town adjacent to the famous stud, and he spent the
  afternoon in making the round of the London offices of the principal
  Argentine newspapers without discovering any further paragraph on the same
  subject.</p>

  <p>The only evidence that Milton discovered was in the principal Rio paper,
  saying that Sir George had paid a flying visit to the Argentine and was
  leaving almost immediately by the next mail steamer.</p>

  <p>"He will be back in England now, then," said Milton. He took up the
  telephone receiver, and gave a number.</p>

  <p>"Is that La Plata Steamship Company?" he asked. "Can you tell me when your
  next boat arrives? On Tuesday morning? Thank you. Can you tell me," he asked
  hurriedly as he was about to put the receiver down, "whether Sir George
  Frodmere is a passenger?" He raised his eye­brows at the answer, and hung the
  receiver up thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Sir George is not a passenger; he came by the other line," he said. "But
  they are shipping some cattle for Sir George Frodmere. That means they have
  shipped El Rey. The boat arrives on Tuesday morning," he said, "at Tilbury.
  It is a rather curious fact that I have some business in that neigh­bourhood
  on the day previous."</p>

  <p>"Business you have just thought of?" she smiled.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No. I am doing a little work for Eric Stanton. I have not told you what
  it is, my child," he said, as he rose and laid his hand on her shoulder,
  "because"&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"I hardly know how to say it. I feel
  rather rotten about taking Stanton's money and doing no work for it. It is on
  my mind."</p>

  <p>"Are you doing some detective work for him?" she asked interestedly.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Something I would rather not speak about," he said shortly, "and you
  shall know why. It is the feeling I have that I am not playing the game with
  Stanton; that I am not fit for the work he wants me to do. You see, I never
  intended taking up a detec­tive agency seriously." He stopped again.</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a little frown. "What­ever do you mean?" she asked
  slowly. "Do you know that you are making me feel awfully uncom­fortable? You
  aren't running this office when there is no need to because you want to find
  me an easy berth?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"That is not so, my little girl," he said lightly. "I have plenty of work
  to do in a sense, but it is Stanton's work which worries me most. I have got
  to find a girl&mdash;that is all I can tell you, and whether she is dark or
  fair, or tall or short, or fat or plain, or pretty I cannot tell you. I don't
  even know where she lives or who she ever knew. I have not so much as a
  photograph or one of those articles of jewellery which are indispensable to
  the writers of missing heir stories. I must trapse about the world till luck
  throws her into my way, and all the time I am waiting for the miracle to
  happen. I am drawing twelve pounds a week from Eric Stanton. Now, that is the
  rotten part of it."</p>

  <p>"Is there no possibility of getting even a slender clue?"</p>

  <p>"There is just that possibility," he nodded, "it appears that at the same
  time as the girl, who is his sister, disappeared, an old servant went away,
  pre­sumably with the child, and with her "&mdash;he hesitated, for he was
  very jealous of Stanton's secret. "I have been able to trace a relative of
  the servant's, and I hope to find the woman herself. Once I do that I shall
  be near to some sort of practical line upon which I can work, but in the
  meantime," he said briskly, "there is much for me to do; things to learn
  about Sir George Frodmere and the horse he has bought for M. Soltykoff's
  stud. So far as I can dis­cover," he said, "the name of Soltykoff, although
  prominent in other connections, is virtually unknown amongst the breeders of
  Russia, and his stud is so modest that he has maintained an extraordinary
  reticence regarding its location. None of the Russian racing people&mdash;and
  there are always one or two in London&mdash;know anything about him."</p>

  <p>"And your first commission, you have forgotten that," said the girl
  reproachfully. "Really, you have a tremendous amount of work if you would
  only give your mind to it."</p>

  <p>"You mean Soltykoff," he smiled, "the missing formula and the million
  francs? I assure you that is never out of my mind. I am a lucky devil," he
  went on, shaking his head in self-reproach. "I get to places without an
  effort, which men spend years of toil to reach. It will be just my luck if
  the solu­tions of all the three mysteries come to light on the same day. Just
  my luck," he repeated, and there was a strange smile as though something in
  his mind had afforded him infinite amusement.</p>

  <p>"Now you can come out and have tea with me," he bantered her, "before you
  retire to your modest, suburban home."</p>

  <p>"Don't poke fun at my suburban home," she smiled, struggling into her
  coat, "and don't help me with this jacket, I beg of you."</p>

  <p>"I am so sorry." He stepped quickly to her side, and offered her the
  fragments of assistance which she required.</p>

  <p>"I am getting frightfully remiss," he said.</p>

  <p>"You are thinking too much."</p>

  <p>"About what?"</p>

  <p>"About Miss President," she said bluntly.</p>

  <p>He looked into the calm eyes of the girl with an astonished smile.</p>

  <p>"About Miss President?" he said, as though he had not heard her
  aright.</p>

  <p>"About Miss President," she said briefly. "You've had one or two letters
  either from her or about her."</p>

  <p>There was something in her tone which made him feel a little
  uncomfortable. It was not resent­ment; she had made, if it were possible, a
  plain state­ment, untinctured by any subtle comment which an intonation could
  give.</p>

  <p>"I don't blame you," she smiled. "She is awfully beautiful and attractive,
  but I don't think you ought to let such things affect your work." She was
  almost matronly in her admonition.</p>

  <p>"Great heavens, my child!" he protested, "the letters are from Stanton! I
  never think of her."</p>

  <p>"You imagine you don't," she said, shaking her head at him with a little
  hint of severity, "but all the time she is in your mind. I can almost feel
  your thoughts."</p>

  <p>"All the time I am thinking of somebody else quite different," he said
  quietly. "If any woman comes into my mind in this office or out, wherever I
  am, it is not Miss President."</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"You must not deceive yourself," she said with exasperating
  confidence.</p>

  <p>"But I tell you&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"Don't shout," she said calmly, "I am only speaking to you for your good.
  You have been very kind to me, Mr. Sands, and I appreciate it."</p>

  <p>"You are not presenting me with an illuminated address or anything?" he
  asked in the flippancy of despair.</p>

  <p>"Please do not be sarcastic," she answered, the colour coming to her face.
  "You ought not to practise your sarcasm on me, Mr. Sands. I am going
  home."</p>

  <p>"You are coming to tea," he said.</p>

  <p>"I tell you, I am going home," said the girl determinedly.</p>

  <p>"After you have had tea with me," said the deliberate Milton Sands, "you
  may go to your home, but until six o'clock your services are mine, and it is
  now only half-past five."</p>

  <p>"Then I will wait here," she said, beginning to take her coat off.</p>

  <p>"Do you know "&mdash;he shook his head at her&mdash;"you are the most
  aggravating young party I have ever had to deal with. You are really,
  Janet."</p>

  <p>"Please don't call me by my name," she almost snapped. She sat down at her
  desk with an air of resignation, and he returned to his and flopped into his
  big, padded chair.</p>

  <p>They sat thus for three minutes, then he turned round with a jerk.</p>

  <p>"You are jealous of Mary President," he accused. She swung round in her
  swivel chair, her eyes bright with anger.</p>

  <p>"How dare you say that?" she asked hotly.</p>

  <p>"Because I am a detective," he said, striking a ridiculous attitude, "and
  detectives dare anything in the world; providing always that they are well
  paid for the risks they take."</p>

  <p>"You know I am not jealous of Mary President. What have I to be jealous
  about? Aren't you entitled to any friends you want?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose I am," he considered. "But in this particular case I rather
  fancy you do not like Mary President."</p>

  <p>"You are altogether wrong, and if you imagine that I would descend to such
  pettiness as being jealous of any woman for your sake, you have an
  extraordin­arily exaggerated opinion of your own power of attraction. So far
  as I am concerned, I am hardly interested in your love affairs."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes you are!" he said in alarm, "because&mdash;you are placing me in
  a very embarrassing position, and you are making me feel very uncomfortable,"
  he parodied.</p>

  <p>"If you please, I think I will go home."'</p>

  <p>She rose again, but this time he was before her, and lifted the jacket
  down from the peg on which it hung.</p>

  <p>"Allow me," he said.</p>

  <p>She could do no less than accept his services.</p>

  <p>She stood for a moment at the door.</p>

  <p>"I think if you will allow me a day off to-morrow," she said, "I will try
  and find other work."</p>

  <p>"I shall summon you for a week's wages in lieu of notice," he warned her,
  his eyes twinkling, for he dearly loved a fight of any description, "and you
  behaved with the greatest discourtesy to one who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To one who?" she challenged defiantly. "Finish your sentence, and tell me
  what you have done for me, I beg of you."</p>

  <p>"To one who loves you," he said quietly. "Who thinks of you, and none but
  you, day and night. Who wants to make you independent, that he might be in a
  better position to offer you the control of his erratic life&mdash;that is
  all," he added.</p>

  <p>She stood by the door, white and breathless, her lips apart, her eyes
  shining, and then walking slowly to where he stood, she laid both her hands
  on his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Come out to tea," she whispered. "But kiss me first."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">They were at the door when the telegram came, and Milton
  read it with comic dismay.</p>

  <p>"As confirming all your worst suspicions," he said, and handed the wire to
  the girl. She read:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">"PLEASE SEE ME ON WEDNESDAY ON MY RETURN TO TOWN. MR.
  ERIC STANTON SUGGESTED I SENT FOR YOU.&mdash;MARY PRESIDENT, THE
  MALL."</p><br>

  <p>She turned her smiling eyes to his.</p>

  <p>"I don't mind," she said softly. "I was jealous... but I'm not now...
  Milton..."</p>

  <p>"Call me Bill," pleaded the detective urgently. "Milton's a rotten
  name."</p>

  <p>"Milton was blind," she said cryptically.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; THE GREY ARRIVES</h2>

  <p class="first">MONSIEUR SOLTYKOFF objected to many English customs which he
  regarded as being superfluous. Not the least of these was the disgust­ing
  practice which members of this eccentric nation had formed of early rising.
  He was one of a small party that gathered at Tilbury in the grey of an April
  dawn to watch the <i>City of Incas</i> come slowly up the estuary of the
  Thames, her white sides grimy from her long voyage, her bows streaked brown
  with the rust of anchor chains. Sir George Frodmere was another, and the
  inevitable Mr. Wilton a third.</p>

  <p>Sir George, with his overcoat collar turned up, made his way on board the
  vessel as soon as she berthed.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the purser, whom he found taking early morning coffee in his
  comfortable little cabin, "I have got a horse for you, sir; I understand you
  are Mr. Soltykoff."</p>

  <p>"This is Mr. Soltykoff," introduced Sir George. "The horse is going on to
  Russia to-morrow. How has he stood the voyage?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He is as fit as a fiddle," answered the purser enthusiastically. "As nice
  a horse as ever I have had to deal with, which, considering he is a
  thorough­bred, is rather unusual. He has eaten well during the voyage, which
  has been a smooth one, by the way, and I don't think you will have much
  difficulty in getting him ready for racing."</p>

  <p>"He is not to be raced again." said Sir George sharply. "He goes to Russia
  to Monsieur Soltykolf's stud."</p>

  <p>"I see."</p>

  <p>The purser, who knew something of Turf matters, shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It seems a pity," he said regretfully, "that a fine four-year-old like
  that, who might win all sorts of good races, should be relegated to the stud.
  However, sir, you know your own business best," he said with a smile.</p>

  <p>There were certain necessary documents which Sir George, as Soltykoff's
  agent, had to sign. "By the way," asked Sir George carelessly, "when do you
  sail again?"</p>

  <p>"On the day before the Derby, I am sorry to say," said the purser
  ruefully.</p>

  <p>Sir George heaved a sigh of relief. He did not want this horse-loving
  seaman at Epsom on that day, for a very good reason.</p>

  <p>Within half an hour of the ship berthing, the sheeted form of the
  Argentine horse was led down a broad gangway plank to the wharf. A wizened
  little man was waiting to take him, and without any further ado the horse was
  led along the bewildering labyrinth of quays which constitutes Tilbury's
  docks, across innumerable railway lines, and at last out through the gates
  into the drab streets of Tilbury, the three men walking behind.</p>

  <p>"Where are you taking him?" asked Mr. Wilton. "Wait and see," snapped the
  other. "Don't ask silly questions, Toady."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wilton relapsed into an indignant silence. There was a long walk
  before him, and he did not relish long walks. /</p>

  <p>Two miles out of Tilbury, on a deserted stretch of the road, they came
  upon a motor horse-box, and into this the importation was, with some little
  coaxing, induced to enter.</p>

  <p>The party had also been provided for; a car was waiting for them close at
  hand, and they went ahead of the horse-box, taking the road for London.</p>

  <p>There is in Shadwell, once the home of romance (or the Metropolitan
  Railway advertisements lie), a hundred little stables where poor tradesmen
  and the hand-to-mouth coster house their miserable charges for the night.
  Grim and squalid side-turnings, lumbered up in the evenings with barrows and
  carts, with crazy stable doors admitting to premises which are little more
  than sheds. Before one of these. Sir George having dismissed the motor at
  some safe distance, stopped, unfastened a padlock which secured a gate, and
  crossing a dingy yard opened the door of a small shed. The stable&mdash;for
  such it was&mdash;was in darkness, but the rattle of a chain told him that it
  was occupied. The premises were situated in a small cul de sac, secured at
  the end by a pair of gates above which was the faded legend "Thompson's
  Livery Stables." Thompson had long since passed the way of all reckless
  speculators in rubber and race­horses, and this little collection of hovels,
  numbering some six in all, had been rented by Sir George with a view to such
  a contingency as now confronted him. It offered security from observation,
  for many things happened in the dark and secret stables of Wapping, of which
  the inspectors of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
  had no notion.</p>

  <p>"You stand by the door, Toady," said Sir George, "and watch for that
  motor-van. Directly you see it, open the gates to let him in and close them
  behind him."</p>

  <p>It was not a task to the liking of the elegant Wilton, but he obeyed
  without question. He had not long to wait, for soon the van came smoothly
  round the corner and passed through the rickety gates.</p>

  <p>"Now, let us have a look," said Sir George, and the horse was backed out
  and his sheet stripped.</p>

  <p>He was a fine, well-modelled grey, rather small for his age, but business-
  like and compact.</p>

  <p>"He will do," said Sir George. "Let us have a look at the other
  fellow."</p>

  <p>He went into the stable, throwing the door wide open. The horse secured in
  the furthermost stall looked round at him. He was shaggy of coat and thin of
  rib. Nobody seeing him would have recognised that this was the dapper little
  Portonius who, as a two-year-old, had run without any distinction in the
  Brocklesly Stakes the year before. Least of all would they have imagined that
  this was that same Portonius who, at that moment, stood in the Derby betting
  at twenty to one. Some such thought occurred to Sir George, and he smiled
  sardonically.</p>

  <p>"What price would they offer against him if they saw him now?" he
  said.</p>

  <p>"About a thousand to one I should think," Toady replied.</p>

  <p>The half-starved grey, dirty and hungry, looked round at his owner, and if
  he had been a sentimental man he might have read reproach in the horse's
  beautiful eyes, but there was no sentiment in Sir George Frodmere.</p>

  <p>"Put our friend in the next stall," he said.</p>

  <p>The newly-imported horse was led into the stable, and made fast to the
  ring in the shapeless manger.</p>

  <p>"We will take him off to Cornwall to-morrow morning," said Sir George.
  "What about the youngster, Buncher?" he asked, turning to the wrinkled man at
  his side.</p>

  <p>"Why not have him killed, sir?" suggested the man.</p>

  <p>Sir George shook his head.</p>

  <p>"That means bringing in some one else. A slaughterer would know enough
  about horses to recognise a thoroughbred. No, that is not the best way," he
  said. "There is another, and one which I have decided upon adopting. What is
  the name of that man who you have helping you in the stable sometimes?"</p>

  <p>"Here, sir?" asked Buncher.</p>

  <p>Sir George nodded.</p>

  <p>"A man named Flickey, I don't know his real name," said Buncher slowly.
  "He is just a hanger-on at one of these pubs round here. He will do anything
  for a pint of beer."</p>

  <p>"Didn't you tell me that he got into trouble through shipping worn-out
  horses to Antwerp?"</p>

  <p>Buncher nodded with a grin.</p>

  <p>"Is that the game, sir?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That's the game," said Sir George shortly.</p>

  <p>"Get your man to take away the horse to-night. He can just hand it over to
  the people who receive 'em. He need not carry any papers at all. They will
  imagine that the colt has been paid for, and in a couple of days he will be
  shipped to Antwerp and we shall hear no more about it. It is the only safe
  way," he said thoughtfully, "because the traffic in worn-out horses is so
  unpopular, that the people engaged in it observe the greatest secrecy, and
  the more secrecy there is in this business the better I shall like it."</p>

  <p>"Now, M. Soltykoff," he turned to the little Russian, "I think we shall
  not bother you any more. By the way, what is the news regarding your
  loss?"</p>

  <p>The Russian shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I am desolated," he said sadly. "I fear I shall never get that beautiful
  formula again."</p>

  <p>"And there is a million in it," said Sir George.</p>

  <p>"A million," laughed the other bitterly. "There is two, three, five
  millions&mdash;fortunes for us all. Do you know that an exhibition is to be
  opened at the end of next month and that the promoters are offer­ing a reward
  of a hundred thousand pounds for a process such as is contained in that
  formula? Imagine it!&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I wonder why old President does not apply for the reward himself?" asked
  Sir George, with a puzzled frown.</p>

  <p>The Russian shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"That is very easily explained," he said, "even now I remember in my
  muddled way how intricate the proportions were. I don't doubt that he has
  tried, and tried again to recall the formula. Possibly it was stolen from him
  during an illness. I gathered that something of the sort happened."</p>

  <p>"From whom did you gather it?" asked Sir George sharply.</p>

  <p>"The man who sold it to me," said the Russian. "He is coming to London, by
  the way."</p>

  <p>"Can he recall nothing?"</p>

  <p>Soltykoff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"He can recall just as much, possibly, as President can. He remembers
  everything except the one essential thing, and every experiment we have made
  upon his lines or the lines he indicated has been a failure."</p>

  <p>"Do I know him?" asked Sir George interestedly. They had walked out
  through the entrance to the yard and were traversing one of the grimiest
  streets in Shadwell.</p>

  <p>The ghost of a smile lingered for a moment on the Russian's face. "You may
  have read of him," he said. "You have heard of Count?"</p>

  <p>"I heard about him by wireless," said Sir George in surprise. "The man who
  broke the bank at Monte Carlo."</p>

  <p>"That's the gentleman," said the Russian, with pleasant sarcasm, "he broke
  the bank at Monte Carlo, and he arrived in Paris immensely pleased with life,
  so pleased "&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"that he seems to have
  overcome the awe in which he once stood of John President, and has expressed
  his intention of coming to London."</p>

  <p>"Count Collinni," repeated Sir George thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"You will not know his name," laughed the Russian. "It is almost as new as
  his affluence."</p>

  <p>"I should like to meet him," Sir George suggested. "A man with a great
  deal of money may be very useful."</p>

  <p>For a moment their eyes met, and the little Russian's smile spoke
  volumes.</p>

  <p>"You will not find him so useful as you have found me," he said, and with
  a curt nod of his head he stepped into the car which was waiting, and was
  whirled off.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">At half-past eight that night a stout man, some­what
  unsteady of gait, but capable of simulating solemn sobriety, came through the
  gateway of the old livery stable leading a horse, and Mr. Buncher gave him
  his final instructions.</p>

  <p>"If anybody wants to know where he is going, tell him he is going to a vet
  in Camden Town."</p>

  <p>"Trust me," said the man, with all the confidence in the world. "I ain't
  done a month for this without learnin' something. Is there anything to
  collect?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Buncher. "You have got ten bob for your trouble. All you
  have to do is to hand him over to the man who ships the horses and leave
  him."</p>

  <p>"I know the feller," said Flickey with confidence. "A cross-eyed man who
  lives in Deptford&mdash;sends 'em by the thousand he does&mdash;makes a rare
  lot of money out of it, too. Quite the gentleman," he said, with wondering
  admiration, "keeps two servants, wears a diamond ring, and you couldn't tell
  him at a distance from Rothschild."</p>

  <p>"Hop it," snarled Buncher, and with a "t'ck," the toper led his charge by
  divers side-turnings into the Commercial Road. He crossed this thoroughfare
  as hurriedly as possible, because the Commercial Road was filled with light
  and, to Mr. Flickey's apprehensive eye, populated by policemen animated by no
  other desire than to secure the ruin of a hard­working man who did no other
  harm in the world than leading the helpless and the miserable to a merciful
  oblivion. A quarter of an hour's journeying on his way brought Mr. Flickey to
  a quiet road and unobtrusive street, intersected at right angles by an even
  more desirably placid thoroughfare, and at the junction of the two streets
  the warm, alluring windows of a public house called Mr. Flickey with
  irresistible force. He stopped and looked up and down. The only person in
  sight was a loafer, who with bowed shoulders and hands thrust deeply into his
  trousers pockets was lurching along in his rear. Mr. Flickey felt that this
  was the moment of all moments when a drink was most desirable. And besides,
  the public houses would soon be closed he argued, wilfully exaggerating this
  danger and deceiving himself with great readiness. He fingered the
  half-sovereign in his pocket, and found a new reason for a moment's halt
  amidst the desert's waste. He would require change, and half-sovereigns were
  so easily lost.</p>

  <p>The loafer shuffled past with slow footsteps.</p>

  <p>"Here, Bill," said Flickey.</p>

  <p>He did not know that the stranger's name was Bill, but it seemed a
  friendly thing to say to one of whom he was about to beg a favour. Not
  without reward, however, as his first words revealed.</p>

  <p>"Hold this horse for five minutes," he said, "and I will give you the
  price of a drink when I come out."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, mate," answered the man with cordiality.</p>

  <p>He was tall, roughly dressed, but Flickey, grading him instinctively, put
  him down both from the in­tonation of his voice and by certain other signs as
  a gentleman who was down in his luck.</p>

  <p>"Where is he going?" asked the man, looking at the horse curiously.</p>

  <p>"Never you mind," said Mr. Flickey, severely. "Ask no questions an' you'll
  hear no lies. There are certain tilings that we don't tell everybody."</p>

  <p>"No offence, I hope," responded the horse-holder, taking the halter rope
  in his hand.</p>

  <p>"I don't mind telling you," said Flickey, with the air of one who was
  rendering the other a tremendous service, "that he is booked for the
  boneyard."</p>

  <p>"Slaughterers," asked the man, interestedly.</p>

  <p>"Not exactly," said Flickey, who was of the class that having information
  to give could not resist the temptation of giving it. "I am taking him to a
  friend of mine who is shipping him across the water."</p>

  <p>"I see what you mean," said the other, nodding his head.</p>

  <p>"Shan't be five minutes," said Flickey, looking round from the doorway of
  the public house, and he entered into the joyousness and the warmth of life
  with the zest of one who had an unbroken coin of superlative value coupled
  with an unique thirst.</p>

  <p>His five minutes expanded to ten, and to fifteen, and having found a
  controversial spirit who was prepared to talk terrifyingly on the subject of
  Home Rule, to three quarters of an hour.</p>

  <p>"I must be getting along," said Flickey, looking up at the clock. He
  staggered out of the bar into the street.</p>

  <p>"I shall be seeing two blooming horses if I ain't careful," he muttered to
  himself, but that affliction was spared, because he could not see even one.
  The grey and its custodian had disappeared. Mr. Flickey stared. He looked
  down the next street, but there was no sign of horse or holder. He even
  looked into the saloon bar, having a confused and vague idea that possibly
  the horse and his keeper had, in some mysterious way, overcome the landlord's
  scruples as to the admission of horses to that select compart­ment. Here was
  a crisis for Flickey, but a crisis considerably modified by the fact that he
  had been paid in advance. He had a conscience which required but little
  salving.</p>

  <p>"Like his blooming cheek," was the only comment he made, and then went
  home to bed, to awake in the morning with a blessed forgetfulness of all the
  events of the previous night; so that when Buncher questioned him as to the
  delivery of the horse he answered promptly and glibly:</p>

  <p>"I handed him over to the gent, and he said 'thank you very
  kindly.'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And it must be put to Flickey's credit that he believed that something of
  the sort had happened.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; BUD KITSON GOES TO SLEEP</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was a rambling, low-roofed room, bright with chintzes and
  made more spring-like by the great bowls of flowers which were placed
  wherever foothold was afforded. Masses of lilac, vases of daffodils and
  freesia, and tiny bowls of violets filled the room with their harmonious
  fragrance.</p>

  <p>The girl rose to meet Milton Sands as he entered, extending her hand with
  a frank smile of welcome.</p>

  <p>"I feel rather guilty at having brought you here," she said, "and the only
  comfort I have is that I gave you plenty of warning, but I had to seize the
  opportunity which my grandfather's absence from London presented, and Mr.
  Stanton was good enough to give me your name. The fact is, Mr. Sands, we have
  been burgled."</p>

  <p>"Burgled?" he repeated in astonishment, "but isn't that a matter for the
  police?"</p>

  <p>"Ordinarily it would be," she answered, "but in this case the
  circumstances are unusual."</p>

  <p>Seated in one of the big, deep chairs of the room he listened whilst she
  related the story of the mid­night visitation on the sleeping car. "A week
  ago," she went on, "I woke with the feeling that there was somebody in my
  room. I did not call out for I was afraid of disturbing Mr. President, who is
  a very light sleeper. I caught a glimpse of an electric flash lamp, and
  realised that somebody was search­ing the drawers of my bureau. I jumped out
  of bed, though I was pretty scared, and as I did so I saw the form of the
  intruder move swiftly across the room and through the door&mdash;it was only
  a glimpse I caught of him against the window, but I am certain that it was
  the same man who had tried to enter my sleeping compartment on the
  train."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Milton slowly. He understood the meaning of the visitation.
  Soltykoff suspected the girl of being in possession of his precious formula.
  "Where is your grandfather now?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He is in Sussex. We have a little cottage on the edge of the downs where
  Donny is being trained for the Derby&mdash;I came up from there to meet
  you."</p>

  <p>"Is that where you are training 'Down Under Donovan'?" he smiled.</p>

  <p>She nodded seriously. Down Under Donovan was a very serious matter to
  her.</p>

  <p>The existence of this horse, his every possibility, the whole future which
  lay before his twinkling hoofs were more vital to her than the plans which a
  general might have made for the defeat of his enemy, or a financier
  elaborated for his own enrichment. Down Under Donovan was a real thing to
  her, although it might be only a name to this smiling man.</p>

  <p>"Would it be possible for you to go back to your grandfather to-day?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>She looked at him in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Of course," she said, "he wants me to come back, but I had an idea of
  staying in town for a few days." He thought for a long time. Then:</p>

  <p>"I want you to leave to-morrow," he said. "That is if your grandfather is
  projecting any long stay in the country."</p>

  <p>She nodded. "He will be there off and on till the Derby," she said.</p>

  <p>"Very good," smiled Milton brightly. "Now we will have to hire a
  safe."</p>

  <p>"A safe?" she said in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"A safe," he repeated with that emphatic little jerk of his head which was
  characteristic of him. "I will send you one&mdash;I know an excellent shop
  where they may be hired."</p>

  <p>"But I don't want a safe," she said. "I have nothing whatever to keep in
  it."</p>

  <p>"Still," he insisted, "if I sent you a safe you would have no objection to
  it being placed in your room?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever," she smiled. "But it seems rather a waste of money,
  doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"You forget, Miss President," said Milton Sands impressively, "that I am a
  detective. It is an amusing and expensive occupation, and you must imagine
  that I do not pay for the hire of safes unless I have very excellent reasons.
  If those excellent reasons are mysterious to you, please remember that every
  moment of a well-organised detective should be shrouded in mystery."</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"I will do as you wish," she said.</p>

  <p>"There is one other thing," said Milton, after a moment's thought, "can
  you let me have a key to your house?"</p>

  <p>"With pleasure."</p>

  <p>"I shall want the run of it," he went on, "during your absence, and I
  don't think you need worry Mr. President about this burglary."</p>

  <p>"Do you understand why people are bothering me?" she asked very anxiously.
  "I've got quite nervous... the papers are filled with stories of the escaped
  convict, and perhaps I am jumpy."</p>

  <p>"You must leave matters where they are for the moment. We will see what
  happens," he said. "As to the escaped convict&mdash;" He stopped
  suddenly.</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" he said with a chuckle, "what an idea!&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He would not say what the idea was, but tactfully changing the subject,
  talked of Eric.</p>

  <p>She spoke sparingly of that young man, and her reticence was more eloquent
  to Milton than the most eulogistic phrase would have been. He stopped on his
  way to the city, and negotiated the hire of a most spacious and imposing
  steel safe. The shop­keeper was inclined to be dubious as to the wisdom of
  his selection.</p>

  <p>"It is only a very light thing," he said, tapping the safe with his
  knuckles, "and neither fireproof nor burglar-proof; it is merely intended for
  unimportant books. As a matter of fact," he said in a burst of frankness, "it
  was built for show rather than for use by a firm which desired to create an
  impression upon the public."</p>

  <p>"That's the thing for me," said Milton, "some­thing nice and light. I want
  you to get it down there to-day."</p>

  <p>Then he went on to a theatrical costumiers, for he had a brilliant idea.
  He called at the house the following morning and found the girl rather amused
  and a little dismayed.</p>

  <p>"It takes up an awful amount of space," she said, "and it looks perfectly
  ugly in my room."</p>

  <p>"May I see it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She rang the bell, and her one servant came.</p>

  <p>"Will you show Mr. Sands my room?" she asked.</p>

  <p>The girl led the way upstairs into Mary's bedroom.</p>

  <p>It was indeed out of place with its egregious green­ness and its florid
  gold lines in that little nest of neutral tints and dainty draperies.</p>

  <p>"Fine," said Milton, gazing at it admiringly. He turned to the maid.</p>

  <p>"Sure," she replied.</p>

  <p>He looked at her keenly.</p>

  <p>"Are you American?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She flushed a little.</p>

  <p>"Why, yes," she said. "I came over from America three months ago."</p>

  <p>"Have you been in Europe before?"</p>

  <p>"Nope," she replied shortly.</p>

  <p>"Or lived on the Continent?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," she answered easily, with the emphasis on the second word.</p>

  <p>As he went down the stairs he spoke to her suddenly over his shoulder.
  "That safe cost me a thousand dollars. Do you know how much that is in
  English money?"</p>

  <p>"Forty pounds," she answered promptly.</p>

  <p>"Quite right," approved Milton.</p>

  <p>He had discovered all he wanted to know. An American girl who thought in
  francs and not in dollars, yet who was not acquainted with the Con­tinent of
  Europe was one of those curious accidents of life which interested him
  profoundly.</p>

  <p>"I have only had her a fortnight," said Mary President, answering his
  question, when they were alone. "She was recommended to me by Sir George
  Frodmere."</p>

  <p>"You know Frodmere, do you?"</p>

  <p>"Slightly," she replied with a little frown. "Not well enough, nor am I
  sufficiently impressed by him to take servants on his recommendation, but he
  was so keen on my giving this girl a trial. We happened to want a servant at
  the time; our own girl had an unexpected offer of a very good place, and I
  let her take it."</p>

  <p>"Do you know where she went?" asked Milton carelessly.</p>

  <p>The girl smiled.</p>

  <p>"If I remember rightly, I had the address to send on any letters which
  might come for the girl. She had a fiancé. I will find it for you."</p>

  <p>She went out of the room, and came back with her little address book.</p>

  <p>"She is in the service of a Mrs. Gordon Thompson," she read.</p>

  <p>"I see."</p>

  <p>Milton grinned to himself. Mrs. Gordon Thomp­son was George Frodmere's
  sister; a faded society lady who found recreation at the bridge table, and
  was notorious for her shyness in paying the debts which she incurred in her
  recreation.</p>

  <p>The thing was very simple. Frodmere wanted a confederate in the house, and
  had persuaded his sister to offer good wages to the one domestic, and had put
  in her stead the woman who would serve his ends. Milton had recognised her
  the moment she came into the room. He had seen her at Monte Carlo on more
  than one occasion in the society of Bud Kitson. She was generally accepted,
  in the indulgent society in which she moved, as the wife of the American
  tough.</p>

  <p>"Now, Miss President," he asked briskly, "when do you leave?"</p>

  <p>"I go this afternoon," replied Mary.</p>

  <p>"Do you take your servant with you?"</p>

  <p>Mary knit her brows. "She is rather a problem," she smiled. "I did not
  anticipate leaving London so soon."</p>

  <p>"I will offer a suggestion," said Milton. "Give the girl a holiday on full
  wages. Tell her you will not want her for a week."</p>

  <p>"But that may be inconvenient to her?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think it will," said the other dryly. "You leave by what
  train?"</p>

  <p>"By the three-fifty-five."</p>

  <p>"I will be at the station to see you off," he said. "Have you the
  keys?"</p>

  <p>She took a bunch from her pocket and detached one&mdash;a Yale
  key&mdash;and handed it to him.</p>

  <p>"I do not think that after your return," he said, "you will be subjected
  to any more annoyance."</p>

  <p>"There is one thing I want to ask you," she said, as he was taking his
  leave, "will you explain what I have to put into the safe?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," he said. He drought awhile. "Yes, put in any papers which are
  of no consequence to you, and lock the door very carefully. Perhaps it would
  be more artistic if you enclosed a few documents&mdash;they can be
  dressmaker's bills&mdash;in some sort of a box."</p>

  <p>"I have an attache case," she said, "which I shall not be using."</p>

  <p>"That will do excellently. Put them in, lock the door, and above all
  things warn your maid that nobody must be admitted to the house during your
  absence, that she is to fasten every window before she leaves, and that she
  is to notify the police that you will be absent for a week."</p>

  <p>"I could do that on my way to the station," she said.</p>

  <p>"I would rather you told her. Let this admirable woman save you the
  trouble."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">At half-past eleven that night, Bud Kitson descended from a
  taxi at some little distance from Chiswick Mall, paid the driver, and
  dismissed him, and walked confidently along until he came to the house
  occupied by John President and his grand­daughter. Without any hesitation he
  turned in at the gate, carefully closing it behind him, walked up to the
  front door, inserted a key, and, opening the door, stepped into the hall. He
  shut the door, and producing from his pocket an electric lamp, flashed it
  round the deserted passage. There was evidence of the recent departure of
  Mary President, for the tidiest of travellers are apt to leave such traces.
  He walked into the dining-room and grinned to him­self. On the table had been
  laid neatly a tray, a decanter, a glass and some soda. The lady who called
  herself Mrs. Kitson had prepared this light refreshment for her lord. He
  splashed in a little whisky into the glass, fizzled the soda from the syphon,
  and drank it off before he addressed himself to the serious work of the
  night. By the light of his lamp he extracted the necessary tools and made his
  way leisurely upstairs. He knew Mary President's room very well indeed. It
  was not the first time he had been there, and on this occasion he anticipated
  a successful issue to his search. That the formula was in the house he was
  now sure. The hurried arrival of a formidable safe was proof, if proof were
  needed, that she had secreted this valuable document in the house. He might
  not have made the attempt otherwise, but the safe had decided him. And,
  moreover, it limited his search, and indicated the exact spot wherein the
  treasure was to be found. He closed the door of the room behind him, and
  flashed his light unerringly toward the portion of the room where the safe
  stood upon its painted deal legs. He made a closer inspection, and his smile
  was con­temptuous. It was the sort of safe, as he knew, that could be cut
  open with a butter-knife. The lock might even be picked, so simple a matter
  was it. At any rate, he could try. He selected a key and inserted it in the
  lock. It did not give, but his practised ear caught certain sounds which
  denoted to this expert that the trial of a second or a third would be
  successful. And so it proved, for on the second attempt with his adjustable
  skeleton key, the lock clicked back and the door swung open.</p>

  <p>Further interest in the safe and its contents were for the moment
  suspended, for the room was suddenly filled with light. Kitson turned
  quickly.</p>

  <p>"Hands up," said Milton Sands, and covered the burglar with his Browning
  pistol.</p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img title="Down Under Donovan"
         alt="Cover"
         src="1305711h-images/DownUnderDonovan-02.jpg">

    <p class="caption">"Hands up," said Milton Sands, and covered the burglar
    with his Browning pistol.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"Hullo!" said Bud calmly. "How do you do, Mr. Sands?"</p>

  <p>"Pretty good," replied Milton cheerfully. "Come closer, Bud; let us begin
  an era of disarmament." His deft fingers searched Bud carefully, but Bud
  Kitson had not deemed it necessary to carry weapons himself upon this
  occasion, and the search proved this.</p>

  <p>"Sit down over there, Bud," said Milton, pointing to a chair; "or,
  perhaps, you had better come down below where you can smoke in comfort. Hand
  me that lamp of yours."</p>

  <p>He took the torch from the other, and pointed to the door; Bud passed
  through, Milton Sands follow­ing, switching out the light as he went and
  replacing its rays with the single gleam of Kitson's pocket lamp. They
  reached the dining- room.</p>

  <p>"Turn on the light," said Milton. "You can do so in perfect safety. I am a
  lodger here."</p>

  <p>"What's the game, Mr. Sands?" asked the man. He was feeling unaccountably
  tired, and was quite understandably irritable at this end to his adventure.
  "I have not quite decided yet," was the reply. "I rather fancy that it is
  going to be a game which will be very amusing to me, however uncomfortable it
  is for you. How is Maisie?" he asked banteringly. Bud Kitson grinned.</p>

  <p>"I was afraid that if you got your lamps on her you would get wise to the
  lay out," he said regretfully.</p>

  <p>"I was wise all the time. Now, what is it you are looking for? The formula
  which Soltykoff lost?"</p>

  <p>"You will get nothing out of me," said the other defiantly.</p>

  <p>"That we shall see," replied Sands. "I rather fancy that you will tell me
  all I want to know, and I rather fancy that if you don't tell me everything,
  I shall hand you over to the police, and all those worthy friends of yours
  will curse you most heartily, because it means that they will have to come
  into court and perjure themselves as to your character. I will tell you one
  thing, Bud, between man and man, that if you are looking here for the formula
  that Soltykoff lost, you are wasting all your time. You must look somewhere
  nearer to you for that docu­ment," he said slowly, "and if you cannot guess
  who stole it that night, why, you are the biggest fool that ever passed under
  the guise of a crook."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean Sir George?" asked Kitson quickly.</p>

  <p>"I name no names," said the diplomatic Sands.</p>

  <p>Bud was experiencing a curious lethargy which he endeavoured vainly to
  shake off. He could not understand the reason for his weariness; he was an
  extraordinarily healthy man, and, moreover, he had not risen that day until
  nearly noon. An explanation for his tiredness did not offer itself until his
  eye fell upon the tumbler and the decanter upon the table. Even then the
  truth only dawned very slowly, and he half rose from his chair.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," said Milton.</p>

  <p>The man obeyed from sheer inertia.</p>

  <p>"You asked me a little time ago what the game is. I am sorry I cannot
  enlighten you; but you will discover in due course that the game is one in
  which we both play a part&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bud's head sank on his chest, he muttered some­thing incoherently, then
  rolled heavily from the chair to the floor in a dead sleep.</p>

  <p>Milton Sands took the decanter and the glass into the kitchen, emptied and
  washed them out, returned and placed them on the table and refilled the
  decanter with whisky from a bottle which he found in the cupboard of the
  sideboard.</p>

  <p>"I am becoming a real detective," he said in self-­admiration, as he
  looked at the senseless form at his feet. "Now, Bud, you are going to have
  the strangest adventure you ever had in your life." And he went in search of
  a bundle he had hidden when he came into the house a few hours before.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; THE COUNT COLLINNI</h2>

  <p class="first">AS selenium has an affinity for light, so was Sir George
  Frodmere influenced, and his actions largely influenced, by money. Great
  sums, prefer­ably in a fluent and get-at-able form, interested him first, and
  there followed immediately an acute interest in their possessors. There was
  certain money which was easy and certain that was difficult. Money confined
  in the steel wall of the laws govern­ing limited liability companies, money
  on which there sat congregations of fat and watchful directors, glaring
  antagonistically at all comers through their gold-rimmed spectacles,
  interested him not at all. This ingrained wealth you might not extract save
  with chisel and hammer; but there were others. Young men with fascinating
  legacies; older men acquiring sudden affluence by the explosive actions of
  markets, all the easy money that lay on the surface and might be swept off by
  a cunning craftsman and the owner no wiser, this was the form he desired
  wealth should take in all his friends. Sir George Frodmere had an estate in
  Cornwall, and a large house and staff of servants under an admirable butler,
  named Gillespie, an honest but dour man, who had been in the service of Sir
  George's father; but with these possessions he had no money. There was a
  small revenue derived from farmer tenants, but too infinitesimal to serve the
  baronet in his need. He never had had money; his father was in the same
  predicament, but added to his penury there had been the desire for a simple
  and economical life. In this way, with a small annuity purchased by an
  ancient aunt of the family, old Sir James had made both ends meet, or, if
  they did not quite meet, the intervening gulf might be bridged over by the
  judicious sale of timber.</p>

  <p>Sir George, his son, had no desire for the simple life, and was not
  economical. Oxford had imposed the educational equipment of a curate upon one
  who had the extravagant tastes of a millionaire and the ambition of a
  jockey&mdash;which are to make money in large sums without incurring the
  censorship of the authorities. So Sir George had progressed along the nobbly
  road of life with his eyes wide open to its opportunities. And never did a
  better or more promising opportunity present itself than when Count Collinni
  sailed into his ken, fluttering trium­phant flags, and uttering strange and
  cries.</p>

  <p>An agent of Sir George's, himself a shock (as he frankly admitted), wrote
  to the baronet:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"I have just given Collinni a letter of intro­duction to
  you. He calls himself a Count, and is a low-down Cockney by his
  speech&mdash;or, as I suspect, an elderly larrikin from Melbourne. Anyway, he
  broke the bank at Monte a month ago, and not only broke it, but cleared a
  pile of money at baccarat in one of the night clubs here.</p><br>

  <p>"I have 'touched,' but only lightly; he is too suspicious a devil. You
  might get in deeper, for he wants to lord it in London Society. Send me a
  little present if you get at him. By the way, he is always talking of John
  President, and in spite of his bluster is a little in terror of the old man.
  This knowledge may help you."</p>

  <p>Sir George had no desire to leave Pennwaring till he had heard the result
  of certain experiments which Bud Kitson was making, but when, almost
  simultane­ously with the letter, there had come an ill-written, ill-spelt
  epistle from the redoubtable Count, addressed from London's most exclusive
  hotel, the baronet did not hesitate.</p>

  <p>He made the pilgrimage to London, and found the Count in his shirt-sleeves
  and stockinged feet engaged in the unromantic process of fixing a pair of
  laces in his walking shoes.</p>

  <p>"Can't trust them valets to do anything," said the thin-faced man. He was
  grey and worn, and his face was harsh and unattractive. He dropped the boots
  as Sir George was shown into the room, rubbed his hand on his trousers to
  clean it, and offered the baronet a limp handshake.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to meet you, Count," said Sir George.</p>

  <p>"Look here, mister," interrupted the other. "Let's drop that Count
  business between you an' me. Mr. John Pentridge&mdash;that's my name. You've
  heard about me."</p>

  <p>Sir George had heard, but had not associated the seller of the precious
  formula with the man whose success at Monte Carlo had arrested, not only his
  attention, but the attention of every newspaper reader in Britain.</p>

  <p>"Count was good enough for Monte," the man went on, "an' I had to be
  somebody 'different, because the last time I was there they chucked me out.
  Natcherly I didn't want to be chucked out again&mdash;so I called meself
  Collinni&mdash;it's a name worth £200,000&mdash;nigh on."</p>

  <p>"And Collinni you shall be," said the genial Sir George, gazing with
  unaffected benevolence upon so much money. "And now tell me what I can do for
  you."</p>

  <p>"You can show me round&mdash;I'll pay," said the other, "an' you can
  pretend you've known me all me life if I ever run up against old Jack
  President&mdash;see what I mean?"</p>

  <p>Sir George nodded.</p>

  <p>"Show me where I can get a bit of a game," the "Count" went on. "Something
  nice and gentlemanly, where I can't lose too much money."</p>

  <p>"That," said the other fervently, "will be a labour of love. You must come
  down and stay with me. I've got a big place in the country, and I'd like you
  to know my friends&mdash;one of them is in town now," he added, remembering
  that Toady might justify his existence.</p>

  <p>"I thought of goin' to Sandown to-day," said Pentridge doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"The very man to take you," replied the enthu­siastic Sir George. "He
  knows everybody&mdash;all the winners&mdash;all the tips; I'll get him on the
  phone."</p>

  <p>Toady, by good fortune, was in his flat, superintend­ing the packing
  preparatory to the removal of his property to Cornwall. It was a furtive
  move, for he was most anxious to avoid giving offence to his young patron.
  Eric Stanton cordially distrusted Sir George, a distrust which was a basis
  for mis­understanding between Toady and the man who represented an annual
  income. For, in addition to the money he had received from Eric on his
  father's death, Toady made a respectable sum from the young man who entrusted
  him with most of his betting commissions, commissions which were not always
  executed, for Mr. Wilton knew much more about the chances of Eric's horses
  than the owner himself, and many a hundred which, for pure sentiment's sake,
  had been invested by Eric never went further than Toady's banking
  account.</p>

  <p>Toady obeyed the summons as fast as his shapeless legs could toddle
  downstairs, or a taxi-cab carry his obese person to Laridge's Hotel. He also
  had the money sense strongly developed, and John Pentridge found an immediate
  friend and guide in the newcomer.</p>

  <p>"Look after him," murmured Sir George.</p>

  <p>"Trust me," said the other, in the same tone.</p>

  <p>John Pentridge was quite capable of looking after himself, but for the
  moment he was content, not only to hand himself over to his new mentor, but
  offer him his unsolicited confidence.</p>

  <p>On the way to Sandown Mr. Wilton learned many things he had never learnt
  before&mdash;especially about John President.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; IN THE SANDOWN PADDOCK</h2>

  <p class="first">MILTON SANDS, strolling in the paddock at Sandown, came
  unexpectedly upon Mary President walking with Eric.</p>

  <p>"Hello!" he said, a little taken aback. "I thought you were in
  Sussex."</p>

  <p>She looked a little guilty, and Eric stepped into the breach.</p>

  <p>"I wanted Mr. President to see what form Battling Jerry is in," he said
  rapidly. "You see, he'll get a line for his Derby horse, and I think Jerry
  will win, so I wired Mr. President to come as my guest." He said all this
  breathlessly, almost defiantly, and Milton's smile, if it was largely
  internal, was none the less expansive.</p>

  <p>"So ho!" he said, half to himself.</p>

  <p>"So ho, what?" demanded the young owner in humoured irritation. "Why do
  you throw these mediaeval phrases about, Sands?"</p>

  <p>"I always 'So ho!' when I'm thinking," replied the other innocently. "What
  did you think I meant?"</p>

  <p>"Have you any news?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"I'm simply bursting with it," he replied earnestly. "But it had better
  keep for a denouement. Don't know quite how the denouement is going to work
  out yet."</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"Don't let us interrupt Mr. Sands," she mocked. "He is thinking."</p>

  <p>Later he saw her alone, as she strolled from the members' enclosure to the
  paddock. She was not alone for long. The monstrous, waddling Mr. Wilton went
  scurrying across the paddock to her, a big beetle of a man, with his uncouth
  walk and his bent shoulders. He barely raised his hat to her, for she was not
  of his aristocratic circle, and he felt in a commanding position at that
  moment.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Miss President," he said, with his familiar leer. "All alone,
  hey?"</p>

  <p>"I am all alone for the moment," she said politely.</p>

  <p>"D'ye know," he said, falling in at her side, "I've been trying to get a
  few words with you for a long time."</p>

  <p>This was true, as she knew to her annoyance. Mr. Toady Wilton had, in
  fact, been most persistent in his attentions to her, and had accompanied Sir
  George Frodmere on every visit he had made to her grandfather. Those visits
  had been more frequent of late than she had cared to remember. Sir George, on
  one pretext or another, was a constant visitor. Strangely enough, the old man
  did not dislike the baronet, though he had doubts as to his
  disinterest­edness in calling. Sir George wanted a "school­master" for his
  Derby colt, Lutania, and had learnt, with something of a shock, that old
  President had a colt in the Derby. He had overlooked the name in going over
  the three hundred odd nominations for the classic. And Mr. Wilton confirmed
  in the belief that he "had the way with the ladies," had offered his
  elephantine attentions with such an air of patronage and in so self-satisfied
  a manner withal that the girl had to exercise all her self-control to prevent
  herself being rude to him.</p>

  <p>To-day he was more than usually trying.</p>

  <p>"And how is the old gentleman?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"My grandfather is well," she answered shortly.</p>

  <p>"And you are looking beautiful," he said admir­ingly, "as beautiful and as
  bonnie as a rose."</p>

  <p>"I wish you wouldn't say that sort of thing," she said, colouring in her
  annoyance.</p>

  <p>"Oh, naughty!" He wagged his finger roguishly.</p>

  <p>"I want you to look upon me as a friend&mdash;yes, as a close and intimate
  bur," and he smiled with meaning as he added, "I think you will want all the
  friends you ran muster."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He looked round the paddock as if searching for somebody, till at last he
  saw the man he sought.</p>

  <p>"Do you know that gentleman?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She looked at the resplendent individual with his patent boots, his
  shepherd-plaid trousers, and his coat magnificently cut. A splendid creature,
  lemon-gloved and shiny silk-hatted.</p>

  <p>"Do you know the Count Collinni?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head a little impatiently; yet interested in the overdressed
  man, who puffed a big cigar importantly, and, if the truth be told, a little
  self-consciously.</p>

  <p>"The Count Collinni&mdash;the man who broke the bank," said the impressive
  Wilton. "And ready and able to break John President."</p>

  <p>She turned and faced him, cold anger in her grey eyes.</p>

  <p>"Exactly what do you mean?" she asked quietly.</p>

  <p>He saw the storm arising, and endeavoured to pacify her.</p>

  <p>"It won't go beyond me," he said confidentially. "No one need know," and
  he winked. The magni­ficent creature had caught sight of him, and came
  strutting toward him. His face, wizened and even older looking than her
  grandfather's, was familiar to her, but she couldn't remember where she had
  seen it.</p>

  <p>"Hello," said the new-comer, raising his hat jauntily. "How do,
  Wilton."</p>

  <p>"Miss President, this is Count Collinni."</p>

  <p>The other stared at her, unabashed by her puzzled gaze.</p>

  <p>"How do, me gel," he said. "This President's grand-daughter?"</p>

  <p>The girl turned with a scarlet face and would have walked away, but Wilton
  laid his hand on her arm.</p>

  <p>"Whatever you do," he begged thickly, "don't give yourself airs, my
  dear."</p>

  <p>In that moment she realised that she was dealing with a man who had taken
  too much drink. This was the case, for Toady had lunched without dis­cretion,
  oblivious of the fact that his guest was, to a large extent, unaffected by
  wine. With the know­ledge of the man's condition she became cool.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I can't stay," she said, but that restraining hand was on her
  arm.</p>

  <p>But only for a second.</p>

  <p>Milton Sands' long legs carried him across the intervening distance, and
  an uncomfortably large hand caught Toady without ceremony by the scruff of
  the neck and jerked him sideways.</p>

  <p>He had never been assaulted before. It was a violent and shattering
  experience. He thought that he was going to die, and for one moment gaped
  stupidly at Eternity. Then the forces of life asserted themselves
  sufficiently to kindle, even in that solemn moment, a sense of indignation,
  and he said:</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?"</p>

  <p>Three other men had seen Toady's crude detention of the girl, and each had
  moved instantly to the group. Toady came to a consciousness of life and
  comparative uninjury to find himself the centre of a group. Fortunately the
  exodus to the rings and the stands had taken place, and he was spared the
  indignity of a public audience.</p>

  <p>The girl, white and shaking, had walked to meet her grandfather, and the
  old man's eyes were blazing with anger as he realised the significance of the
  scene. "How dare you?" spluttered Toady.</p>

  <p>"It is nothing to what I will do to you if you ever annoy this lady
  again," answered Milton grimly.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter, Sands?" It was Eric, the second of the new-comers,
  who asked the question, and Toady in his folly answered:</p>

  <p>"Matter!" he spluttered. "Matter! Why I was having a talk with that damned
  convict's daughter."</p>

  <p>"Convict!" gasped Eric.</p>

  <p>"Convict," repeated Toady with relish. He turned to the ornate and
  brilliant Pentridge, who had watched the arrival of John President with mixed
  emotions. "Am I right, Count?"</p>

  <p>"Quite right&mdash;quite right, m'dear feller," said Pentridge, loudly and
  aggressively.</p>

  <p>"You?"</p>

  <p>The old man made a step toward him, and the confidence of the man seemed
  suddenly to desert him. He wilted and shrunk back, raising his hands as
  though to ward off a blow.</p>

  <p>But the girl checked the old man with a whispered word.</p>

  <p>"You?" said President again.</p>

  <p>"Me!" said the other, in a pathetic attempt at defiance. "Your old pal,
  John Pentridge&mdash;so called because I served twenty years in Pentridge,
  an' you're John President, because you served a lifetime on the President
  hulk&mdash;transported years an' years ago for murder he was&mdash;shot his
  wife in jealousy."</p>

  <p>The old man covered his face with his hands.</p>

  <p>"God help me&mdash;that is true," he muttered. "Fifty-five years ago, and
  I have suffered every moment of the time."</p>

  <p>"You hear," demanded Toady in triumph. "That's the sort of man we've got
  on the Turf to-day&mdash;an old Australian convict; my God! it's enough to
  make honest people give up racing!"</p>

  <p>"It will hardly affect you, Mr. Wilton."</p>

  <p>The gentle, modulated voice made Toady turn his head with a start. Lord
  Chanderson, slim and grey, stood observing him with grave, accusing eyes.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;beg your pardon, my lord," stammered the stout man, now,
  as ever, profoundly agitated in the presence of a member of the British
  aristocracy "It will not affect you, I said," repeated the steward of the
  Jockey Club. "Your record for honesty is not wholly impregnable, Mr. Stanton,
  this man is a friend of yours?"</p>

  <p>"He was on friendly terms with me," corrected Eric quietly.</p>

  <p>"I think you should know," said Lord Chanderson, "what I have known for
  years. He was the man who forged my name in the visitors' book of a certain
  French hotel; he was the man who wrote letters which your father found. He
  made love to your mother. I have the letters he wrote in my possession, and
  because she treated him with the scorn he deserved he planned to harm her,
  thinking that he would benefit from your father's estate."</p>

  <p>"It is a lie!" cried Toady hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Your father discovered the fact just before he died, and endeavoured to
  tell you," Lord Chanderson went on. "Wilton interpreted the mention of his
  name as being a desire on your father's part to provide for him."</p>

  <p>A sickly grin distorted Wilton's face.</p>

  <p>"You imagine this, my lord," he said. "You can't tell us what a dying man
  was thinking." Lord Chanderson nodded.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Stanton confided all the circumstances to the nurse. You bribed the
  nurse to support your story; I have the woman's sworn statement and the
  numbers of the banknotes you paid her."</p>

  <p>Whilst the attention of the party had been con­centrated on Toady,
  Pentridge had slipped away. Even John President, who had searched the world
  for him, was so fascinated by the drama which was being played under his eyes
  that he did not notice the stealthy retirement.</p>

  <p>Eric's face was white and set.</p>

  <p>"This is true, Wilton," he said sternly. "I can see it in your face."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;only&mdash;I did&mdash;what I thought was right," floundered
  Toady, quaking.</p>

  <p>"Will you leave me with this man?" said Eric. What Eric Stanton said to
  Toady Wilton no man knows. At a little distance, Milton Sands watched the
  progress of the conversation and saw Eric suddenly seize the gross man by the
  collar, and turning him round, kick him with some violence.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; AT PENNWARING</h2>

  <p class="first">"THE wagering on the Derby has taken a curious turn," wrote
  the Club reporter of the <i>Sporting Journal</i>, "hitherto so poor was the
  class and so tangled was the form of the two-year-old horses of last year
  that 7-1 has been offered on the field. This is an unprecedented price,
  remembering how near we are to the decision of the great Epsom classic, and
  in view of the fact that the Two Thousand Guineas has been decided. Here
  again, the fates fight against the backer, for the first two in the
  New­market race are not engaged in the Derby. As a set-off against this, we
  have the curious coincidence that the two present favourites for the Derby
  did not run in the Guineas. Portonius, Sir George Frodmere's nomination, made
  one appearance in public. He is a grey, and ran on the first day of the
  season last year. The second favourite, Down Under Donovan, has never run in
  public. It is a curious circumstance, therefore, to find these two unknown
  quantities at the head of the Derby market, but that they are genuinely
  fancied by their con­nections admits of no doubt whatever. Huge invest­ments
  have been made on Sir George Frodmere'sgrey, which is trained privately on
  Sir George's Cornish estate, Pennwaring, and such accounts as we have been
  enabled to secure point to the fact that this colt is exceptionally useful. A
  longer price can be secured about Down Under Donovan. He is in the ownership
  of that sporting gentleman, Mr. John President, whose colours have been made
  familiar to the public by the repeated victories of Dean Champ, that sterling
  performer. The colt is a grandson of Donovan, and since there has been
  nothing hole and comer about the training of this animal, the public are able
  to see his gallops on the Sussex Downs, where he is daily led by the Dean,
  and gives every satisfaction."</p>

  <p>The "hole and corner" reference was made in perfect innocence by the
  writer, who merely sought an effective period to conclude his sentence, but
  Sir George Frodmere read it with an ugly frown.</p>

  <p>"What the devil does the fool mean by 'hole and corner'?" he growled. He
  glared across the breakfast table at the unoffending Toady.</p>

  <p>"How do I know?" asked the other, with an injured air. "Really, Sir
  George, you go on at me as if I had written it."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to know what he meant&mdash;are people saying anything about
  Portonius?"</p>

  <p>The other shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," he said, "except the gossip and tittle-tattle which is bound to
  go round&mdash;a few wondered why you trained him here instead of preparing
  him at Newmarket with your other horses. One or two men I met at the Club the
  other day wondered why you had Buncher as your private trainer&mdash;that is
  to be expected; you know the reputation Buncher has."</p>

  <p>"You can tell your friends that I have my horses where I wish," said Sir
  George tartly, "and that I employ Buncher because he's a good judge&mdash;too
  good a judge to go back on a man who could send him to penal servitude,"
  added the baronet significantly.</p>

  <p>Toady nodded.</p>

  <p>"I know more about Buncher's private failing than any man," Sir George
  went on. "He'd have been the best trainer in England if he hadn't taken to
  drink. I met him by accident after he'd been lost sight of for years. I
  sheltered him when the police were after him for passing counterfeit coin. He
  came to me late one night&mdash;he had done one or two little jobs for me in
  the old days&mdash;frantic with terror, and I got him clear. Swore that at
  the time he was supposed to be passing spurious sover­eigns he was in my
  sendee and in my house."</p>

  <p>"He owes you something," said Toady Wilton, pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"I never go back on a pal," said the complacent Sir George, "whether he's
  a stable lad or a cabinet minister&mdash;especially if he's likely to be of
  service to me," he added, not without truth.</p>

  <p>He picked up the paper, and read the offending paragraph again with a
  grunt.</p>

  <p>"If they think I'm going to invite 'em down here to learn as much as I
  know myself they're going to get cold feet," he said coarsely, and flung the
  paper down. "Now,"&mdash;he devoted his attention to Toady Wilton&mdash;"let
  me have all your news."</p>

  <p>Toady had arrived from town the night before.</p>

  <p>"I've backed Portonius to win you £24,000," he said, producing his red
  indiced betting book. "There's still plenty of sixes on offer."</p>

  <p>"What about the horse of our friend President?" asked Sir George.</p>

  <p>The face of Toady Wilton was black with anger.</p>

  <p>"Damn him, the old brute," he growled. "I'd like to get even with
  him."</p>

  <p>"You've only yourself to blame, Toady," said Sir George, looking at the
  other with curiosity which is usually devoted to a rare reptile. "A man of
  your age and your singularly unpleasing appearance should not make up to
  engaging young females. You've lost a good friend in Stanton&mdash;in
  addition to being severely kicked."</p>

  <p>"Talk about something else," demanded Wilton shortly. "Do you want to back
  Down Under Donovan to save your stake?"</p>

  <p>Sir George laughed contemptuously. "Don't be a fool. If President's horse
  can beat mine I'm a Dutchman."</p>

  <p>"You never know," said the other, cautiously. "Funny things happen in
  racing."</p>

  <p>"And funny things talk nonsense about racing," said the baronet
  rudely.</p>

  <p>Whatever his hold was over the other it was a strong one. It enabled him
  to treat Toady Wilton who, whatever his drawbacks and his unprepossessing
  characteristics were, was a man who held some sort of position on the fringe
  of society, as though he were a menial. Toady, gross of body, viciously ugly
  of face, was a coward, and the domination of the stronger man was rendered
  the more complete from this reason, but behind this was a greater knowledge
  of some dark and secret place in Toady's life.</p>

  <p>A man carries on his face the story of his days, written for all to read.
  The warped and crooked mind, the vicious and self-indulgent life, each has
  its separate and significant pucker and line and hue. It was not for nothing
  that women shrunk from him, and children, the last to trouble their little
  minds about personal appearance, grew silent and suspicious at the sight of
  him.</p>

  <p>The knowledge which is common property to the world is often hidden from
  the person mostly affected. This is either a merciful provision of Nature or
  one of her most cruel jests. Toady Wilton still regarded himself as a lady's
  man, and was in the habit of hinting at mysterious conquests. Sir George, in
  his more sardonic moments, was wont to humour these fancies, a whim on the
  part of the baronet which was destined to cost him dear. He was in his most
  malignant mood that evening.</p>

  <p>"Who was the letter from?" he asked, referring to the solitary epistle
  which had formed Toady's post.</p>

  <p>Toady smiled meaningly.</p>

  <p>"From a lady," he said encouragingly.</p>

  <p>"What, another!" Sir George simulated his respectful admiration for this
  Lothario with excellent effect, and Toady smirked.</p>

  <p>"From Mrs. Bud Kitson," he said disparagingly.</p>

  <p>"And whatever has Mrs. Bud Kitson to say for herself?" asked Sir George,
  interested.</p>

  <p>"It was really enclosing a letter for her husband," admitted Wilton, the
  romance of the communication reduced with every fresh sentence.</p>

  <p>Sir George stroked his long moustache in per­plexity.</p>

  <p>"But Bud is in London&mdash;I expected to hear from him yesterday. The
  President girl joined her grand­father in Sussex, didn't she?"</p>

  <p>"She was at Sandown yesterday," said Toady, with dry humour. "Perhaps Bud
  knew she'd be there and waited till she'd cleared off."</p>

  <p>Sir George shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Why does she write here?" he asked. "If he were in London she would know.
  I can't understand it. Wilton," he asked suddenly, "which of us three has the
  formula and money if it is not in President's possession?"</p>

  <p>Toady Wilton protested feebly.</p>

  <p>"I wish you wouldn't," he began.</p>

  <p>"Either you or I or Bud," mused the other man, stretching his long, thin
  legs under the table. "And it isn't me."</p>

  <p>"I'll swear it isn't me," vociferated Toady.</p>

  <p>"Bud would swear the same. Soltykoff has engaged that man Sands to
  investigate," he smiled. "I can imagine Milton Sands in almost every capacity
  but that of a private detective."</p>

  <p>Derby Day was approaching, and the thrill of the very words was
  communicating itself to hundreds of thousands of people who ordinarily had no
  interest whatever in racing. Wherever the English language is spoken,
  wherever the flag of the Empire flew, wherever two Britons met one another,
  in whatever desolate, wild, or God-forsaken comer of the earth, all
  conversation trended to the one question, "What will win the Derby?"</p>

  <p>To the great army of sporting men the question has a deeper significance;
  something hangs upon its answer other than the pure sentimental aspect of the
  race. There are problems to be faced, previous running of horses to be
  considered, breeding to take into account, and stamina, the whole family
  history of every horse to be searched narrowly for some trace of weakness or
  for some quality which would militate against the horse's success upon the
  curious gradients of Epsom Downs. Then, too, there are training reports to be
  followed, and the state of the ground to be taken into consideration, for
  some horses cannot race upon hard going, whilst others require almost an
  asphalt surface to the ground before they can do themselves justice. Some
  lack the conformation which is necessary to bring a horse through the arduous
  test which the race sets. Some are too straight in front and cannot get down
  the hill and round Tattenham Comer, possibly the most trying piece of course
  that the world knows. Others will never face the ascent from the starting
  post to the top of the hill. Some have speed and no stamina, some have
  stamina and no speed. A perfectly adjusted horse, with all the qualities
  which the race demands, is difficult to find before the actual contest
  demonstrates the fitness of these thoroughbreds to do their best over a mile
  and a half of ground with which they are not acquainted. For never has a
  Derby horse been galloped that course until he makes acquaintance with it on
  the day of the race. That is the thrilling value of the Derby stakes. Only
  one race at the Spring meeting is run over the full course, and that is a
  race in which it is very rare that an owner will enter any horse with
  pretensions to Derby form. So there is this extraordinary novelty, new horses
  to a new and a dangerous course, which adds so much to the uncertainty and
  the interest of the race.</p>

  <p>In all the Club betting, Portonius, the grey son of Santry, was a good
  favourite for the great race. Wherever opportunity offered, money was being
  put upon him by the various agents whom Sir George Frodmere kept constantly
  employed in clubs and on courses. An easier horse to back was Down Under
  Donovan, about whom encouraging reports had been received, and on whose
  chances some of the best judges of racing were remarkably sweet. For the
  training on the Sussex Downs had not gone un­noticed or undetected. John
  President had made no secret of his faith in the colt, and had made no
  attempt to mystify the touts as to the horse's fitness. The clever observers
  of horses in training had made themselves acquainted with his merits, had
  travelled to the training ground, had seen, and were satisfied. Many had even
  been privileged to meet John President and hear from him an enthusi­astic
  eulogy of the colt's capabilities. With them on their tours of investigation
  had gone the expert advisers of the great commission agents, and in a
  thousand betting books throughout the kingdom Down Under Donovan was marked
  as a dangerous candidate. Yet for all this, it is money thrown into the
  market in huge quantities which is the deciding factor in a horse's
  favouritism. The market popularity of a race-horse does not depend upon the
  enthusiastic and sanguine views of its owner. It is money which tells, and
  the weight of the money spoke eloquently for Portonius. Enamoured as he was
  of his colt's chance, John President was a cautious man, and had not invested
  a single shilling a fortnight before the race, but the progress of Down Under
  Donovan was sufficiently satisfactory to urge him in forwarding his
  invest­ments, and there began a steady and cautious trickle of Australian
  gold to the market, and the price of Down Under Donovan shrunk in three days
  from a hundred to six to ten to one.</p>

  <p>Eric Stanton was in charge of these investments; he himself, satisfied
  from what he had seen of the horse's chance, did not back it, for fear that
  his investments&mdash;usually heavy&mdash;might spoil the old man's market.
  But Sir George Frodmere and John President were not the only two men who
  owned horses engaged in the classic with a chance of winning, and the
  encouragement offered by the owners of the favourites resulted in the brisk
  business which brought twelve horses into the quotations. The favouritism of
  Portonius was due mainly to the investments of the baronet and his immediate
  friends. The public were shy, and for good reason. Nothing could be learnt of
  the progress this horse was making. He was being trained in an unlikely spot,
  and all the news about his prowess that could be secured was that which was
  given out grudgingly by the horse's connections. It was an excellent
  opportunity had Sir George desired to start a scare in connection with the
  horse, to issue gloomy notices as to his health, which would have the effect
  of expanding his price and incidentally offering Sir George himself an
  opportunity for profitable invest­ment. But Frodmere had no desire at that
  moment to call attention to his candidate. He did not wish to attract half
  the racing touts of England to his establishment, and so the reports which
  were issued from Pennwaring to the local touts were invariably pleasant
  reading for those who had supported the horse. Even Soltykoff, fretting
  himself about his precious formula, setting to work a score of agents up and
  down the continent to trace its location, found himself amiably distracted
  from his own trouble to the contemplation of a coup which, at any rate, would
  recompense him in some slight degree for the loss he had sustained. For
  Soltykoff, though in many senses a fool, had arranged his investments
  independently of Sir George. He knew the baronet just well enough to know how
  far he could be trusted, and when one day the price of Portonius slipped from
  ten to six to the pardonable annoyance of Sir George Frodmere, who could not
  understand the landslide, the explanation was to be found in M. Soltykoff's
  own investment made through a reliable bookmaker without the knowledge of, or
  consultation with, the horse's owner.</p>

  <p>"I cannot understand why you did it, Soltykoff," said Sir George sulkily.
  "We could have got more money on at the price. You have simply ruined the
  market."</p>

  <p>"Ah, but, my friend," said the little Russian coaxingly, "think of the
  temptation to one who has sustained so much loss, and who desires to get it
  back in the most pleasant manner."</p>

  <p>He had been drinking all the morning, and was in his most melting
  mood.</p>

  <p>"You have some news for me, I think&mdash;No?" he asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"I wish I had," said the baronet, with a troubled frown. "I absolutely
  cannot understand what has happened to Kitson. I telegraphed his wife last
  night, and she has sent me a long message saying that beyond the fact that he
  went out two nights ago and has not returned, there is no further trace of
  him."</p>

  <p>"Do you think he has found the formula and is holding it to ransom?" asked
  the Russian anxiously.</p>

  <p>Sir George shook his head with an ugly little smile.</p>

  <p>"My friends do not do that sort of thing," he said, "and live comfortably
  afterwards," he added.</p>

  <p>Some such suspicion had occurred to the baronet himself, but he had
  dismissed it after considering the possibility in all its aspects. Bud would
  not attempt that, besides, he was not the kind of man who would find a market
  for the formula better than that which Soltykoff himself offered.</p>

  <p>Toady Wilton, who had no great love for Solty­koff, especially in his more
  effusive moments, made an excuse to go to his suite. Toady was established at
  Pennwaring. It was now his headquarters and his home. Three rooms in one of
  the wings of the rambling house had been put at his disposal by Sir George
  months before, and though his previous visits had been few, owing to his fear
  that Eric Stanton would object to such a friendship, he was now openly a
  permanent guest of the baronet. The big rooms had been well furnished, for
  Toady was a lover of luxury, and preferred the almost oriental character of
  living which the seclusion of Pennwaring offered, to the more aesthetic
  restrictions of London chambers. He had brought everything from town, even
  his steel boxes from the safe deposit, and he had the sense of comfort which
  distance from danger also brings. There was danger in London for this man who
  had made many bitter and powerful enemies, and was, moreover, now confronted
  with the necessity for pro­viding against a rich and at some time friendly
  foe who, he felt sure, would not leave a stone unturned to secure Toady's
  downfall. He would go over his papers at leisure he thought and destroy such
  as were incriminating to himself. He knew that these documents existed, and
  it was with a sigh of relief that he had seen the three steel boxes placed in
  the corner of his room with the red seal of the Safe Deposit impressed upon
  them. This was the morning of all mornings to devote to a scrutiny of these
  papers, but he had hardly cut the first cord and taken his keys from his
  pocket to open the first of the boxes when he was summoned to the dining
  room.</p>

  <p>He went back to a remarkable group.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; THE GUEST WHO CAME</h2>

  <p class="first">SIR GEORGE, with an angry frown, stood on one side of the
  dining table. Soltykoff sat in a high-backed chair, with his hands in his
  pockets, apparently amused by something which had transpired, but it was the
  third member of the party who was responsible for the pallor which came to
  Toady's cheeks.</p>

  <p>It was Sub-divisional Inspector Grayson, a man known to Toady by sight as
  one who had charge of the more delicate negotiations of the criminal
  investigation department.</p>

  <p>"Have you heard the news?" asked Sir George angrily.</p>

  <p>"No," faltered the other.</p>

  <p>"Kitson is in Portland Prison," the baronet blurted out.</p>

  <p>"In Portland Prison?" gasped Toady, paler yet. "But how. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Tell him, inspector," said Sir George, pacing up and down the
  apartment.</p>

  <p>"It is a very curious story," said the inspector, with a quiet smile.
  "Your friend, at least he says he is your friend, and Sir George tells me
  that he is known to you, was found in London three nights ago and was
  arrested. As you probably know, there was a man escaped from Portland a few
  weeks back who has never been traced by the police. It was believed that he
  made for London, and all the stations and every constable was warned as to
  the possibility of the man being seen in the street. At half-past one last
  Tuesday morning a policeman on duty in Chiswick Mall came upon a senseless
  figure of a man half reclining in a gateway. He tried to rouse him, thinking
  the man was drunk or sleeping, but without success, and summoning assistance,
  the man was conveyed on an ambulance to the police station. It was then that
  it was discovered that underneath the overcoat buttoned tightly to his chest,
  the sleeper was wearing the complete dress of a convict&mdash;grey shirt and
  the whole outfit, even to the identical number of the wanted man. Even to his
  shoes," he smiled. "There was nothing to do but to keep the man in custody,
  and to communicate with the officers of Portland Prison. The next morning the
  man recovered, and protested that he was not the person required, and told
  some sort of rigmarole story to the effect that he had been drugged. However,
  he was tentatively identified by the warders who were sent to escort him to
  Portland Jail. There he was seen by the governor and the doctor, and he was
  so emphatic in his protest that he was not the wanted man that a very careful
  examination was made by these officials, and it was then discovered that a
  mistake had been made. Moreover, it was seen that the numbers attached to the
  man's dress were not uniform with anything to be found in the jail, and there
  was some extraordinary mystery attached to the man. In consequence, I have
  come from London to ask Sir George and you to go with me to Portland Jail
  with the object of identifying this man who calls himself Kitson."</p>

  <p>"I don't think there is any doubt about its being him," said Sir George.
  "I have seen the portrait of the wanted man, and have remarked on the
  extra­ordinary likeness. But must I come?" he asked reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid you must," said Inspector Grayson. "Will it be necessary for
  us all to go?" asked Sir George. "I do not mean my friend, Mr. Solty­koff,
  who is leaving by the next train, but Mr. Wilton here."</p>

  <p>"It would be better," said the inspector.</p>

  <p>"It is very awkward," said Sir George, after a pause. "I had invited
  somebody down here, and I naturally desired to be present when he came.
  How­ever, that is not the principal difficulty. What is necessary is that we
  should get this unfortunate man out of his trouble. How far is Portland Jail
  from here?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid it would be rather too far for you to motor," said the
  inspector, "if that is your idea; but if you want to be saved the bother of a
  train journey, I dare say motoring will be as quick as any­thing else."</p>

  <p>"Well, there is nothing for it," said Sir George, with an air of
  resignation. We shall have to go. Toady. You had better get your coat on and
  I will send word round to Jackson to get the car to the front of the door. We
  will drive Soltykoff to the station. Will you come with us, inspector?"</p>

  <p>The officer nodded.</p>

  <p>"If you wish it," he said. "Or otherwise I will come on by train, but
  there is just the risk that I may not arrive at Portland until after you, and
  that I shall keep you waiting."</p>

  <p>It was very annoying to Sir George. He had not left the house or the
  estate since the training of the spurious Portonius had begun. However, there
  was no help for it. He could not leave Kitson there, or the man in a moment
  of exasperation might say more than the baronet would care to hear
  repeated.</p>

  <p>He spoke to the butler.</p>

  <p>"I am expecting a gentleman from town, Gillespie," he said. "Show him
  every civility, and give him the run of the house. I shall be back in the
  morning at the latest."</p>

  <p>"Very good, Sir George," said the man. "But what about Portonius?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he can see Portonius all right!" said the baronet carelessly. "I want
  you to make him feel quite at home. He is not exactly"&mdash;he
  hesitated&mdash;"a gentleman, but you are to humour him, you understand,
  Gillespie."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," replied the servant. "He is to have the run of the house and
  do as he wishes."</p>

  <p>"Exactly."</p>

  <p>A few moments later Sir George's big, blue car was going carefully down
  the drive, out upon the high road, and was proceeding eastward to the relief
  of the embarrassed Bud Kitson.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Less than half an hour after the car had dis­appeared,
  another motor car came through the lodge gates at Pennwaring, and, proceeding
  slowly up the drive, came to a halt before the broad flight of steps which
  led to the entrance of the mansion.</p>

  <p>The butler, on the <i>qui vive</i> for the arrival, came hastily down the
  steps to meet the visitor.</p>

  <p>"Sir George is very sorry," he said, "but he has been called away on
  unexpected business. He told me to make you comfortable until he
  returns."</p>

  <p>The tall man who alighted from the car nodded, then, seeing the butler's
  eyes searching for the luggage, he said easily: "my luggage has not come. As
  a matter of fact, I am not making a long stay. When do you expect Sir George
  back?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow morning, sir," said the man. "He is hardly likely to come
  before."</p>

  <p>Again the tall man nodded.</p>

  <p>"I will stay the day," he said, "on the off chance of him returning. I
  have wired to him."</p>

  <p>He dismissed his chauffeur with a nod, and since the chauffeur had had his
  instructions most elabor­ately set forth in detail, he needed no more than
  that nod, and backed his car until he came to the open space before the
  house, then swung it round and went down the drive and back to the road from
  whence he had come. The visitor had plenty of time before him, but he
  utilised that time very completely. To the surprise of the butler, the
  behaviour and the language of the visitor were completely in contradic­tion
  to the description which Sir George had given, and Gillespie found himself
  wondering as to what standard Sir George set in his apprizement of
  gentle­men. He was certainly very inquisitive, this tall, teak-faced man who
  wanted to be shown all over the house, even into the sacred precincts of Mr.
  Toady Wilton's rooms. He himself had a room adjoining the suite Toady
  occupied, and when he announced his intention, after lunch had been served,
  of spending the afternoon in taking forty winks, the exhausted servant was
  grateful.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you would not like to see the horse, sir," he asked.</p>

  <p>If the visitor accepted this invitation he had no more to do than hand him
  over to Buncher and save himself from further bother.</p>

  <p>"If you will call me at three o'clock," nodded the new-comer, "I shall be
  most happy to see it. I have heard so much about Portonius that I am dying to
  have a good look at him."</p>

  <p>At half-past one he went to his room.</p>

  <p>His behaviour was somewhat unconventional for a guest.</p>

  <p>He locked the door, and without any more ado he proceeded to try the keys
  he found in his coat pocket upon the door which led to Toady Wilton's suite.
  Two minutes later, when the admir­able Mr. Gillespie was explaining to a
  respectful audience in the servants' hall his views on the new­comer, that
  gentleman was making an inspection of Wilton's belongings at his leisure. It
  took some time, this inspection, as he went systematically to work, but at
  three o'clock, when the butler, in obedi­ence to his orders, presented
  himself, he expressed his complete relief from the weariness which had
  attacked him at lunch.</p>

  <p>Mr. Buncher found a man who was very keen to discover things about horses,
  and Mr. Buncher, a constitutionally suspicious man, cursed the folly of Sir
  George Frodmere in allowing one who evidently knew all there was to be known
  about horses such freedom of inspection. He did, however, succeed in keeping
  the stranger out of the stall, and it was over the half-door of the loose box
  that the visitor inspected the Derby favourite.</p>

  <p>"A fine horse," he said.</p>

  <p>He whistled softly, and the colt turned and came towards him; this man had
  evidently a way with horses. He held out his hand, and the grey rubbed his
  soft muzzle against the outstretched palm.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" asked Buncher suddenly.</p>

  <p>The stranger turned a look of bland surprise upon the other. "I don't
  quite understand you," he said.</p>

  <p>"You were looking at his teeth."</p>

  <p>"Looking at his teeth!"</p>

  <p>The new-comer apparently could not follow the other.</p>

  <p>"Why should I want to look at his teeth?" he smiled innocently. "I am not
  a dentist."</p>

  <p>"Sir George does not like people touching the horse," said the man
  gruffly, and led the way out, closing the stable door behind him.</p>

  <p>There was nothing for the visitor to do, since the uncommunicative Buncher
  could offer him no adequate answer to the innocent questions he asked, than
  to return to the house and make his preparations for departure. Those
  preparations were simple, there were certain papers to stuff into the inside
  pocket of his overcoat. There was a window to be raised, and a shrill whistle
  to be blown, a whistle which Mr. Gillespie heard in the servants' hall, which
  aroused Buncher in the stable yard, and which instantly caught the ear of the
  waiting chauffeur on the road without. Three minutes later his car was up
  before the door, and the visitor stood upon the steps waiting to depart. The
  butler was genuinely sorry to see his guest go, a revulsion of feeling for
  which the sovereign he held in his palm was an adequate explanation.</p>

  <p>"You will tell Sir George that I am sorry I could not stay," said the tall
  man, and there was no need for him to say more, for at that moment a rocking
  car shot through the gates of the lodge and came flying up the drive, coming
  to a jerky standstill behind the other car. Sir George jumped out, his face
  livid with fury, and Bud Kitson followed.</p>

  <p>It had not been necessary to go to Portland.</p>

  <p>Bud had been released by Home Office order, and his car had met the
  baronet upon the road.</p>

  <p>"Milton Sands, I believe?" said Sir George. "That is my name," answered
  Milton, putting on his gloves leisurely.</p>

  <p>"Has this man been in the house?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Sir George," said the startled butler.</p>

  <p>"Has he been into the stable?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Sir George," said the other.</p>

  <p>The baronet turned with a snarl on Milton.</p>

  <p>"So that was the game, was it? That was the trick to get me out of the
  way; I suppose Grayson was in this."</p>

  <p>"You can suppose what you like," said Milton Sands. "I was in it and that
  is enough. I wish you good-day."</p>

  <p>He stepped down the steps, but the baronet confronted him.</p>

  <p>"You don't leave until I understand what you have been doing or what you
  are taking away from here. A man who gains admittance into a gentle­man's
  house under false pretences is entitled to be searched."</p>

  <p>"You will not search me," said Milton Sands with a smile.</p>

  <p>The baronet reached out his hand and caught the other by the sleeve. As he
  did so Milton struck at him with the back of his hand, and there was a
  resounding smack as the bony knuckles caught the other's cheek, and he went
  staggering down the steps.</p>

  <p>"Take him, Bud," roared Sir George.</p>

  <p>"Not with that gun, I guess," drawled Bud. "He will have to wait his
  turn."</p>

  <p>The "gun" in question had appeared in Milton's hand as if by magic, and it
  cleared the road for him to the car.</p>

  <p>"I have learned a great many things," he said, leaning over the back of
  the car and speaking in a pleasant conversational tone. "I could almost write
  a book on what I have learned, Sir George, not only from your stable, but
  from our friend Toady's private archives."</p>

  <p>Toady Wilton stood open-mouthed, but no words escaped him.</p>

  <p>"I have come to the conclusion, Sir George," Milton went on, in his own
  deliberate, half-amused, half-serious way, "that there are degrees of
  scoundrels in the world, and that an acquaintance with one of the lower
  degrees has the effect of increas­ing one's respect for a rascal of a better
  type. I must say that since I have become acquainted with the depth and
  extent of Toady Wilton's villainy, I have quite a sneaking regard for the
  clean and wholesome rascality which you represent."</p>

  <p>He nodded a farewell to the fuming baronet, then turned to his
  chauffeur.</p>

  <p>"Home, James," he said deliberately.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; LOVE IN A COTTAGE</h2>

  <p class="first">ALL that was beauteous in nature was reflected in the heart
  of Mary President, as she stepped through the porchway of Mandrake Lodge, and
  stood shading her eyes as she searched the rolling green Downs. The little
  garden which surrounded the Lodge was a patchwork sachet of colour and
  fragrance. Great masses of rosemary, flesh pink of budding roses, rich red of
  Asiatic poppies, masses of daisies and delicately fragrant stock, with here
  and there islands of geranium, stalwart and perennial. Iris and anemone,
  nestling pansy and tall, red, flaming gladioli added to the gorgeousness of
  the haphazard design and the fragrance of rosemary filled the still air. She
  stood as she passed to pluck a little bloom of musk violet, walked through
  the gate and, crossing the road, reached the untamed stretches of down. One
  pang alone intruded itself upon the splendid serenity of her mind. Loyal and
  devoted to her grandfather as she was, even that pang counted for subtle
  treachery towards him by her high standards.</p>

  <p>Never a maiden waked to the bright dawn with so complete confidence in the
  righteousness of her loyalty as she had&mdash;yet that pang had come even as
  she stretched her healthy limbs in the exquisite comfort of healthy
  sleepiness. It had come as she slipped from her bed and went padding softly
  with bare feet to the little casement to draw in the sweet air of the
  morning; it had occurred again when, shin­ing wet, she had stepped from her
  bath.</p>

  <p>And every time she had thrust it aside, that regret which she, with little
  justice to herself, interpreted as a censorship upon her grandfather.</p>

  <p>The morning was warm. She made a hasty selection of her lightest clothing.
  She wanted nothing to impede the free movement of her gracious body that
  day&mdash;she would have rejected such an adjective&mdash;and when she had
  kindled a fire, filled the kettle and set it to boil, she had opened the
  front door softly and had crossed the garden to the downs.</p>

  <p>And the centre and core of the pang which the glories of the day did not
  wholly dispel, was a certain young man who flushed on the slightest
  provocation, yet was possessed of all the fine qualities of man­hood which
  she admired.</p>

  <p>What would Eric Stanton think of it all? What judgment would he, in the
  calm moments of reflection, pass upon John President? And yet&mdash;she
  stamped her foot impatiently&mdash;what right had he, or any man, to sit in
  judgment on this old man who had suffered so terribly for his one passionate
  crime&mdash;a crime rusty with age, and almost belonging to another century.
  He would be merciful, she felt that&mdash;but mercy was not the quality she
  required for John President. She needed justice&mdash;that, and no more.</p>

  <p>Over the distant rise she saw two horses move, silhouetted against the
  morning sky. They were the Dean and his promising pupil at their early
  exercise. The stables lay in the hollow over by Pennington village, and old
  Mag would be riding the colt himself.</p>

  <p>She remembered the kettle, and went back into the kitchen to discover that
  it was boiling furiously. She sang a little song under her breath, as she
  busied herself with teacaddy and teapot. Her grand­father was not stirring.
  That was good. She would not disturb him until eight. The solemn-faced clock
  over the kitchen mantelpiece pointed to a quarter to seven.</p>

  <p>She set a cup, poured out the tea, and sat to the enjoyment of the most
  pleasant meal of the day to many.</p>

  <p>She sighed a little as the thought of Eric recurred. The plain deal table
  at which she sat was under the window of the kitchen, a window bright with
  the cerise blooms of geranium. A daring thrush hopped down upon the sill and
  cocked his knowing head at her.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr. Thrush," she said gravely, "and how is your wife this
  morning?" The bird chirruped softly, then, without warning, flew away.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I've offended him," said Mary ruefully.</p>

  <p>"I'm always offending&mdash;" She looked up quickly.</p>

  <p>A shadow had fallen from the window.</p>

  <p>She rose with a start as she met the smiling eyes and the healthy face of
  one who had occupied a disproportionate amount of her thoughts that
  morning.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Stanton," she stammered, and went a fiery red. Then, with an heroic
  attempt to appear self-possessed, "I thought you were a thrush."</p>

  <p>"I am a lark," he corrected her gravely. "Won't you ask me in to
  breakfast?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She smiled, and indicated the door.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid we cannot supply your favourite dish at so short notice, Mr.
  Lark," she said solemnly, "but you may come in."</p>

  <p>"And it isn't breakfast," she said, as he entered, laying his whip, hat,
  and gloves on a chair. "But a Christian cup of tea."</p>

  <p>"That would please me," he said, pulling forward a chair to the table.</p>

  <p>"And you mustn't make any noise, because grandfather is asleep."</p>

  <p>"You surprise me," extravagantly impressed. How beautiful she looked, he
  thought, a veritable Aphrodite, so lightly clad that every line of the supple
  figure demanded urgent admiration. She, conscious of her skimpiness in the
  matter of clothes, regretted petticoats and whalebones with some fervour. It
  was a calm, beautiful face she turned to his, and the colour which came to
  her cheeks as she realised something of the inadequacy of her attire, no less
  than the strange light in her eyes&mdash;of this she was pardonably
  ignorant&mdash;fascinated and silenced him.</p>

  <p>All that was lovely in a woman, the grace, the tenderness, the infinite
  possibilities of growing was in her face.</p>

  <p>"How many lumps?" she asked prosaically, poising the sugar tongs.</p>

  <p>"Six!" he said with a start. "I mean seven. I always taken seven," he
  affirmed stoutly, covering his confusion more recklessly.</p>

  <p>She looked at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Seven?" she asked, incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes I take eight," he declared. "But I am breaking myself of the
  habit. It is horrible to be a sugar fiend."</p>

  <p>"I shall give you one," she decided, and dropped it into his cup. "If you
  want another you may take it."</p>

  <p>He bowed his head with a pained expression, to which the laughter in his
  eyes gave instant denial.</p>

  <p>"I rode over," he explained, as he sipped his tea. "I've got a house near
  by, and I was invited by Mr. President to see the trial."</p>

  <p>She checked a sigh of relief, then&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;don't&mdash;think anything less of my grand­father?" she asked
  jerkily.</p>

  <p>"Think less of him? Good Lord, no!" he said in astonishment. "I think he
  is the most wonderful man I have ever met."</p>

  <p>Again she sighed&mdash;a whole feather-bed oppression of doubt and anxiety
  rolled off her mind. "You're very good," she said in her low, rich voice.</p>

  <p>"I shall be a frequent visitor, I hope," he went on. "I want Mr. President
  to borrow any of my horses he likes to gallop Down Under Donovan with. It is
  gorgeous riding out so early," he said hurriedly for he saw the tears
  gathering in the girl's eyes. "It makes one feel so young and fresh."</p>

  <p>"You must be nearly sixty," she suggested innocently.</p>

  <p>"Sixty-four," he said promptly.</p>

  <p>"Dear, dear!" She shook her head. "You carry your age as well as grandpa.
  Would you mind if I called you Uncle Stanton?"</p>

  <p>"One doesn't usually employ the surname," he said severely. "I will be
  Uncle Eric to you if you wish."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Your great age entitles you to that," she agreed. She was getting on
  dangerous ground; no one was better aware of the fact than she. Yet the heady
  draught of youth was at her lips, and she had none of his sixty-four imagined
  years behind her to dilute the cup with the sweet waters of discretion. She
  felt something of the danger, and rose abruptly. "Let us go into the garden,"
  she said.</p>

  <p>He rose, too, more slowly. He stood between her and the door, and she
  would have to pass him to get to the open air. For some reason which she
  could not understand and could not trace to its sure source, she was
  reluctant to move.</p>

  <p>"Go out&mdash;Uncle," she said, with a quick smile. "Go out and see how
  lovely the world is."</p>

  <p>"I can see it from here," he said in a low voice. "All the wonder of
  it&mdash;the flowers and the gossamer of spider webs&mdash;and the
  butterflies. Do you ever notice how exhausted butterflies always seem? It
  makes me ache to look at them. It's a wonderful world."</p>

  <p>He took a step toward her and held out his arms.</p>

  <p>"Come to me," he said huskily. "Come&mdash;my most wonderful flower of
  all,"</p>

  <p>She had taken a step back as he approached. Her lovely eyes wide opened to
  his, her face had paled to a faint pastel pink.</p>

  <p>She could not speak for her heart was throbbing wildly, chokingly.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, and she stumbled forward to the encircling haven of his
  arms.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Mary!&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The girl struggled to her feet, and pushed back a stray lock of hair.</p>

  <p>"It is grandfather," she said aghast, "and I haven't taken his
  tea&mdash;oh, dear, he's in the garden, and I never heard him come down!"</p>

  <p>"I didn't suppose you had," said the young man cheerily. "I met him on the
  Downs on my way here&mdash;in fact," he confessed, "when you suggested that
  he was in bed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>With a look of scorn she was on her way to the garden&mdash;but the scorn
  was not in harmony with the soft little pat she gave his curly head in
  passing.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen Mr. Stanton?" he heard the old man ask anxiously. "I sent
  him here&mdash;ah, here you are!" He smiled a welcome as Eric stepped from
  the comparative gloom of the kitchen to the garden dappled with golden
  sunlight.</p>

  <p>"I got up when you were asleep," chuckled John President. He patted her
  cheek. "Why, Mary," he said with concern, "your cheeks are all red&mdash;have
  you been sitting before the fire on a morning like this?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no." She went a deeper crimson. "I have&mdash;we have been
  having tea&mdash;breakfast."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Who is going to look after me?" he asked in good-natured dismay.</p>

  <p>For a time the old man's china-blue eyes searched Eric's face earnestly.
  Then he took his arm and walked him through the garden.</p>

  <p>"I understand," was all that he said, and then there was a long silence
  which the other did not break.</p>

  <p>"You are entitled to know something more about me," said John President
  after awhile. "You heard all that Wilton said the other day, and now you must
  know my side of the case. It is perfectly true," he went on, speaking in a
  low tone, "that in the heat of my temper I shot my dear wife. What is not
  known is that I did not shoot at her but at her brother who had exasperated
  me beyond measure. I was young in those days, and a man of quick temper. I
  was tried for my crime, but even the judges realised how I had been punished
  for my sin, and I escaped the death penalty, and was transported to
  Australia. Think of it, Mr. Stanton," he went on, with a little thrill of the
  anguish he felt in his voice, "a man on the threshold of a great career,
  looked up to by my fellows as one of the coming inventors of my time, with my
  wife suddenly snatched away from me by my own act, and myself removed from my
  two young children, and transported to what was in those days a terrible
  land. I was almost a madman in the earlier stages of my life in Australia, so
  much so that they confined me to the 'President,' one of the vilest hulks on
  God's wide sea. Off and on, I was on the 'President' for six years. They
  never kept me in the stockades for very long. I was ringleader of all the
  schemes for the annoying of officials I was the author of most of the plans
  of escape. It was so often 'Send the man to the President,' that they came to
  call me John President. I do not know what would have happened to me in my
  wicked despair, but I received a letter from England from an old friend and
  learned for the first time that my poor children, about whose future my
  conscience was torturing me day and night, had been provided for by his
  generosity, and that they were looking forward to the day when they would
  join me in Australia. That pulled me together; I saw Colonel Champ, who was
  an inspector of convicts, and always took a great interest in the welfare of
  his prisoners. I told him in plain words my scheme of reformation, and it is
  to his credit that he helped me. I was loaned to one of the scientific
  institutes, and worked in their laboratory. It was there that I made a
  discovery which led eventually&mdash;many years later&mdash;to the production
  of malleable glass. That discovery was the extraordinary affinity certain
  alkaloids have for metal. I was transferred to the government laboratory
  which had been established at &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; by a young doctor named
  Lubbock, who unfortunately died as a young man. It was here that I made the
  acquaintance of the man, John Cotton, who calls himself John Pentridge. We
  were fellow-workers in the laboratory; he did all the hard and necessary
  menial work of the place, and we two outcast men became good friends. He was
  able to follow the direction my experiments were taking, experiments all the
  more important to me because I was feverishly anxious to make a success for
  myself, that I might place my children in a position of affluence on my
  release. For that release my friends were working, and the ticket came up on
  the same day that John Pentridge was allowed his liberty. We lodged together
  in a little place in Melbourne, and worked together at the same factory.
  Every night after my return from work we laboured upon my experi­ment. Then I
  invented a new sheep dip which attained a modest popularity, and the
  necessity for working at the factory disappeared. I had a steadily increasing
  revenue from the sale of the dip, and was able to conduct my investigations
  at my leisure. My two children had arrived, and, as the years passed
  pleasantly, they grew up, and the eldest married; Mary is his daughter. My
  younger son was killed in the Zulu war of '81. Jack, my eldest, died ten
  years ago. His long illness, and the strain of my own work, told upon me, and
  at the time I discovered the exact formula and had created for myself a sheet
  of glass which I could bend as you might bend a sheet of paper without any
  further injury than the paper would receive, I was on the verge of a
  breakdown. Knowing that possibly I might be stretched upon a bed of sickness,
  and maybe die, and anxious to provide for my little grand­daughter, I set the
  formula down on paper, and when the last words were written I collapsed. It
  was three weeks afterwards when I came to myself very weak and ill. It had
  been touch and go with me the doctor said. But, in the meantime, John
  Pentridge had disappeared, and with him the formula. That is the rough story
  of my life," said John President simply.</p>

  <p>Eric had listened in silence, his heart full of sympathy for the old
  man.</p>

  <p>"For ten years I sought for John Pentridge up and down the country,"
  President went on, "and now I have found him I feel instinctively that my
  search for him is in vain."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked Stanton in surprise.</p>

  <p>"He no longer has the formula. I knew it from his insolent self-confidence
  when I saw him at San­down the other day. He has parted with it."</p>

  <p>"But surely," said Eric, "you can make him tell you where it has
  gone.'</p>

  <p>"You don't know John Pentridge," said the other grimly. "And now let us
  see the horses."</p>

  <p>He thrust the subject away as though it was some­thing distasteful to him,
  but Eric read in the sullen mien of the old man something of the bitterness
  of this latest disappointment.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I am getting too old to be enthusiastic even in my hates," said
  John President as he strode out across the Downs. "I have had detectives at
  work to discover Pentridge, and now I have found him I don't know what to do
  with him."</p>

  <p>"Why not employ a man to recover the formula?" asked Eric.</p>

  <p>He was a good-natured young man, who never grew weary of trying to help
  his fellows, and it occurred to him that here was an excellent oppor­tunity
  to test the merits of Milton Sands.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">John Pentridge had received an invitation to make his home
  at Pennwaring. It was one of those hearty and generous invitations which men
  who have no money offer to those who may be of some slight service in
  providing them with their deficiencies.</p>

  <p>But the man who called himself Pentridge had hesitated to accept the
  hospitality thus extended. He had hesitated because he was in something like
  a funk. His courage had entirely evaporated at the sight of John President's
  accusing face, and now he walked up and down his splendid room at Laridgc's,
  his hands in his trouser pockets, his head sunk on his breast, contemplating
  the only move possible, namely a hurried one in the direction of France. He
  was in this unhappy frame of mind when Milton Sands opened the door behind
  him.</p>

  <p>Pentridge turned at the sound of the door opening. "Hullo," he growled.
  "Who are you? Don't you know this is a gentleman's private room?"</p>

  <p>"I know it is a private room, Penty," said the other easily. "But no
  more."</p>

  <p>Pentridge only recognised his visitor as a man who had formed one of the
  group which had witnessed the discomfiture of Mr. Toady Wilton.</p>

  <p>A sudden fear assailed Pentridge; a fear that this visit had some deeper
  significance for him than the mere expression of curiosity on the part of one
  whom he was justified in believing was John President's friend.</p>

  <p>"It is no good your coming here," he said violently, "expecting to get
  anything out of me, because there is nothing going, do you see?"</p>

  <p>"So I understand," said the bland Milton, pulling up a chair to the little
  table in the centre of the room. "None the less, I would like to ask you one
  or two questions, which I am sure you will be pleased to answer. You are the
  man who sold M. Soltykoff a formula?"</p>

  <p>"I won't answer any questions," said the other man stubbornly.</p>

  <p>"I am from M. Soltykoff," smiled Milton Sands. "I had a letter from him
  this morning in which he suggested I should call upon you, and, if you like,
  I will show you the letter." He dived his hand into his inside pocket and
  produced the epistle.</p>

  <p>Pentridge looked at it suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"How do I know this is from M. Soltykoff?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I cannot help you there," smiled Milton, "but you can take my
  word that it is from him."</p>

  <p>Laboriously the ex-convict read the ill-written letter through. M.
  Soltykoff was not blessed in the matter of caligraphy.</p>

  <p>"It seems all right," he said grudgingly. "What do you want to know?"</p>

  <p>"You sold M. Soltykoff a formula?"</p>

  <p>The other nodded.</p>

  <p>"How did it come into your possession?"</p>

  <p>"I got it," said the other evasively, from a friend."</p>

  <p>"I realise that you stole it, and I realise that you stole it from a
  friend," said Milton, amending the other's phrase. "But I just want to know
  out of curiosity who was the friend that you took it from, and under what
  circumstances you got it? You see, it is rather important to M. Soltykoff,"
  he went on carefully. "The committee of the Lyons Exhibition have offered a
  reward of a hundred thousand pounds for the discovery of this formula. Not
  that they know that this formula exists, but they are satisfied that it is
  possible to produce malleable glass, and they have taken upon themselves to
  make this offer in the hope of directing the attention of inventors to this
  particular branch of commercial science. All of which," he added pleasantly,
  "is probably Greek to you."</p>

  <p>"I ain't a fool," said the other.</p>

  <p>"In my wildest moments I never thought you were," agreed Milton. "I should
  think you were just the other kind, but you will see that it is necessary for
  us to discover who was the original inventor of this process, so that, in the
  event of our finding this formula, we shall be able to supply the committee
  with all that is necessary in the way of information, as you will imagine,"
  said Milton apologetically, "they will be rather keen on learning all there
  is to be learnt upon the subject."</p>

  <p>Pentridge walked up and down his apartment with a thoughtful scowl on his
  face.</p>

  <p>"There is one thing I would ask," he said slowly. "How long am I
  protected?"</p>

  <p>He hesitated.</p>

  <p>Milton understood what he was driving at.</p>

  <p>"The statute of limitations does not apply in criminal cases," he said,
  "but I can promise you there will be no prosecution."</p>

  <p>"I will tell you how it happened," said the man after a while. "I had a
  pal in New South Wales, an inventor he was, the cleverest bloke you ever saw
  in your life. He was one of the oldest lags in Pentridge, and one of the
  cleverest. He had been put away years and years ago for shooting his wife,
  and he was a perfect devil until something happened which changed him.
  Anyway, he used to spend all his time inventing things, and when he was
  released from gaol he took me with him to help, because I knew his way and
  had got used to assisting him in the prison laboratory." He hesitated again.
  "He invented this process and got ill. I thought he was dying, so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So you bolted with the formula?" suggested Milton.</p>

  <p>"I don't know about bolting," growled the other. "I went off with it,
  anyway, and that is the whole story."</p>

  <p>"Now, who is the man you robbed?"</p>

  <p>"So he didn't know," thought Pentridge. "He was not sent by John
  President, after all."</p>

  <p>"That I am not going to tell you," he said determinately. "You have got to
  find that out for your­self. He is dead, anyway." He ventured this with a
  keen glance at the other.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked Pentridge loudly. "Do you think I am a
  liar?"</p>

  <p>"I have not given much thought to it," replied Milton. "But if anybody
  told me you were I should not feel inclined to make trouble about it."</p>

  <p>"M. Soltykoff can tell you who it was," said Pent­ridge, after a pause.
  "His name was on the envelope."</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately," said Milton with a smile, "M. Soltykoff in a moment's
  mental aberration destroyed the envelope, and has no recollection of the
  name."</p>

  <p>He saw a little gleam of light come into Pentridge's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Well, I can't tell you," said he shortly.</p>

  <p>"There is another matter," drawled Milton. "You used to have an old friend
  some time ago, a man who was seen about with you a great deal on the
  Continent, and who was known to have left Australia with you. He was found
  dead at Monte Carlo," he went on carelessly. "Murdered."</p>

  <p>"Murdered," stammered the other, his face white, the hand that he brought
  to his lips shaking. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I mean just what I say," said Milton. "He was found beaten almost beyond
  recognition in the garden of an empty villa. He was killed the night you and
  I left Monte Carlo."</p>

  <p>"I was not in Monte Carlo that night," said the other hastily.</p>

  <p>"Indeed you were," smiled Milton. "You were playing at the same table as
  I, and you were kicked out for creating a disturbance."</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about it," said the other man sullenly. "If he was there
  that night I never heard of it."</p>

  <p>"He was a party to the abstraction, too, as I understand it," said Milton.
  "At any rate, I gathered as much by the fact that you both left Melbourne by
  the same boat. Was he the inventor?"</p>

  <p>"No," snapped the other.</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea as to why he was killed?" There was no answer.</p>

  <p>"Or who killed him?"</p>

  <p>Still no answer.</p>

  <p>"Was there any urgent reason why you should have killed him?"</p>

  <p>Pentridge turned with a snarl, a devil in his face. "I killed him?"</p>

  <p>"I merely suggested you killed him," said Milton in his most pleasant way.
  "I do not insist upon the fact."</p>

  <p>He rose slowly, putting on his gloves.</p>

  <p>"It is very evident to me I cannot get the infor­mation I require from
  you."</p>

  <p>He nodded to the door.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" asked Pentridge.</p>

  <p>"To pursue my inquiries along another line," replied the detective.</p>

  <p>As Milton Sands walked out of the hotel and stepped into the car that was
  waiting for him, he realised that beyond giving this man a bad scare he had
  not made any notable success in his attempt to secure the information he
  required.</p>

  <p>Who was the owner of this formula? If he cleared up that point much might
  happen. It was strange that he did not associate John President with the
  proprietorship. When he had been called in to assist, to the embarrassment of
  Bud Kitson, he had thought no more than that Mary President had been
  suspected of stealing the document for no other reason than that she was on
  the train at the moment of the collision. It was, to his mind, merely the
  unworthy suspicion of unworthy men which had led to her prosecution. Could
  there be anything more in that suspicion, he asked himself. It was a worrying
  thought, and he went back to his office depressed by the possibility.
  However, there was an easy way of discovering&mdash;the easiest of
  all&mdash;by asking the girl herself. He looked round at Janet indus­triously
  wading through the morning's newspapers, then he drew a pad of telegraph
  forms to him and wrote quickly.</p>

  <p>"I am going down to see Miss President," he said.</p>

  <p>She looked up with a smile. "Even that threat does not worry me now," she
  said with a smile. "But how long will you be away?"</p>

  <p>"Two days at the longest," he replied.</p>

  <p>"You are worried," she said quickly.</p>

  <p>He smiled extravagantly.</p>

  <p>"Worried?" he protested. "I was never so happy in my life."</p>

  <p>"How are your investigations going on? Have you found Mr. Stanton's
  sister?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I cannot get any trace of the girl," he said.</p>

  <p>She looked at him long and thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I have an idea," she hesitated. "But I hardly like to advance it."</p>

  <p>"What is your idea?" he asked quickly. "I want any ideas you can give me.
  I tell you that this Stanton business is worrying me terribly."</p>

  <p>"Years ago," she said, "I used to know Sir George Frodmere's sister, at
  least my mother used to know her."</p>

  <p>"I think I have heard of George Frodmere's sister," smiled Milton. "She is
  the lady who gives light-hearted recommendations of servants at her brother's
  request."</p>

  <p>"I don't know anything about that," said the girl. "But I do know that she
  is an awful gossip, and that there is very little that has happened in London
  during the last twenty years that she does not know. She is the one woman who
  might be able to put you on the track."</p>

  <p>"That is an idea," he pondered. "I will see her as soon as I get
  back."</p>

  <p>He left by the two o'clock train for Sussex, but instead of staying two
  days he was back again in town by eleven o'clock that night, a perturbed and
  preoccupied man, and a busy man withal, for the grey light of dawn was
  showing whitely through his bedroom window and found him still writing.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; MILTON SANDS AT WORK</h2>

  <p class="first">MRS. GORDON THOMPSON lived in that part of Bayswater which
  is so affluent in appearance as to deceive the compilers of the telephone
  book into the belief that it is situated in Mayfair.</p>

  <p>Mr. Gordon Thompson had long since gone the way of all flesh, by which is
  meant, not so much that he was dead as that he had decorously and properly
  dropped out of the world to the embarrassment of a number of worthy
  shareholders in two or three companies with which he had been associated. And
  with him had disappeared the fluent and available assets of those companies,
  the affairs of which occupied an Official Receiver and most of his assistants
  the greater part of three months before he was able to issue to a number of
  lamenting creditors a first and final dividend of one and fivepence halfpenny
  in the pound.</p>

  <p>Mr. Gordon Thompson did not include amongst the assets which he found
  convenient, to carry with him to a distant clime that wife of his bosom,
  whom, according to the law, and by reason of certain vows he had taken, was
  his to cherish and to love. There were unkindly people who suggested that the
  extravagance of Mrs. Gordon Thompson had something to do with the unfortunate
  deficiencies which the Official Receiver found, but such gross scandal as was
  breathed over Bayswater did not affect the lady to any great extent, and,
  secure in the knowledge that she was the daughter of one English baronet and
  the sister of another, she went on in her placid way, and in course of time
  people forgot all about her husband, and only came to regard her as one who
  had the entree to good society and was a person to know.</p>

  <p>It is no extravagance to say that there was ground for the suggestion
  which was put forward in all good faith that it would have been impossible
  for her husband to have been in difficulties without her knowing. Because
  Mrs. Gordon Thompson knew everything there was to know. There never was a
  happening, in or about society, with which she was not acquainted. She had
  the reputation of being one who lived on the borderland of eccentricity. Her
  morals were irreproachable; you might not point the finger of scorn at Mrs.
  Gordon Thompson, however justified you might be in a derisive jerk of your
  thumb. She was notorious only in an uncomfortable way, for hers was the
  notoriety which attached to one who was not above taking her constitutional
  in the early hours of the morning up and down the respectable streets of
  Bayswater, clad in no more suitable array than a padded silk dressing gown.
  She was a thin-faced woman, with bright bronze hair, the colour of which
  communicated itself in some miraculous manner to the skin in the immediate
  vicinity. Thus you saw a little streak of brown at her temples, especially on
  those mornings when Mrs. Gordon Thompson had been in a great hurry and had
  applied her beautiful hair wash carelessly. She had eyes of flint blue, and a
  rat-trap of a mouth, and for the rest she was on the stringy side of life and
  was inclined to be sharp and acidulated.</p>

  <p>Milton Sands had no difficulty in securing an interview with the lady, and
  this, to his surprise, in view of his exploit at Pennwaring. But Sir George
  Frodmere was never a voluminous correspondent, and only utilised his sister
  when he required her. He had not troubled to warn her against the latest
  possibilities which were contained, and might be looked for from his
  knowledge of Milton Sands' character, in that young man. It was in the
  after­noon that Sands made his call, and found Mrs. Gordon Thompson in a
  light wrapper sitting before a large table playing patience. She was an
  unconventional lady, sufficiently so to issue the instructions that Milton
  Sands should be shown straight up.</p>

  <p>"How do you do?" She greeted him with a nod. "Find a chair, will you? I
  think we have met somewhere."</p>

  <p>She went on playing her patience, paying only casual attention to her
  visitor.</p>

  <p>"I think we have," said Milton Sands. "At Enghien some time ago."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I remember!" she nodded. "You are the man who cleared out the
  thousand-pound bank."</p>

  <p>"I seem to recall something of the sort," said Milton easily.</p>

  <p>"Well "&mdash;she dropped her little pack of cards on the table and sat
  back, her hands upon the edge of the table, her eyes surveying
  his&mdash;"what can I do for you, Mr. Sands?"</p>

  <p>"You may be able to help me very considerably," he said, addressing
  himself to her mood. "At any rate, my friend, Miss Janet Symonds, is under
  that impression."</p>

  <p>"Oh, little Janet!" said Mrs. Gordon Thompson with interest. "What is she
  doing now?"</p>

  <p>"At present she is my secretary," replied Milton.</p>

  <p>"And what are you when you are at home?" she asked calmly.</p>

  <p>"I am a private detective in a sense."</p>

  <p>"In what particular sense?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thompson was interested, and her thin lips curled in a smile.</p>

  <p>"Well, I am looking for people, and Miss Symonds thought you might be able
  to help me. She says you know everybody and all the&mdash;" He hesitated.</p>

  <p>"And all the scandal of the last twenty years, I suppose," suggested Mrs.
  Thompson cheerfully. "Yes, there is a lot of truth in that."</p>

  <p>In as few words as possible Milton Sands made his errand known.</p>

  <p>"You are looking for Eric Stanton's sister, are you?" said Mrs. Thompson
  thoughtfully. "Well, I think you have set yourself rather a task. I don't
  know anything about her except that she left her husband, and that for a
  little time she lived in some lodgings in Bayswater with a servant. I never
  met her at all, and I only know what I do from hearsay. Some people say she
  went to Belgium and lived in &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; for a time. The only clue
  I can give you is that the servant who disappeared from the Stanton
  <i>ménage</i> at the same time, married an awful brute of a groom or stable
  boy of some kind, whose name I forget at the moment. Anyway, he got into
  trouble and disappeared. My brother used to employ him."</p>

  <p>An inspiration sprang into Milton's mind.</p>

  <p>"Buncher?" he suggested eagerly.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thompson raised her delicate eyebrows in surprise.</p>

  <p>"That is the man. Do you know him?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I have heard of him," said the other quickly. "Do you think it is
  possible that she would know where the child was?"</p>

  <p>"I doubt it very much." Mrs. Thompson shook her head. "You see, she was
  only with Mrs. Stanton for a little time, but still, there are possibilities
  in her."</p>

  <p>"There are indeed," agreed Milton Sands, thought­fully. "I have been
  tracing all sorts of mythical women who might be identified with the servant
  accompanying Mrs. Stanton on her travels, but so far without success. I am
  greatly obliged to you."</p>

  <p>"Janet's mother could have helped you if she were alive. It was on a
  letter of introduction from Mrs. Stanton that I came to know the Symonds's.
  You see," she explained, "though Mrs. Stanton and I had never met, we had had
  a great deal of correspondence. She and her husband were interested in one of
  my husband's companies, and when my dear man bolted she wrote me the sweetest
  letter, and, well, I won't deceive you, she sent me a little money which was
  badly wanted. She never corresponded with me again till she sent from Bruges
  the letter of introduction which brought the Symonds's. Probably Janet
  doesn't know this. I was broke to the world at the time, but I did what I
  could." She smiled a sharp, manlike smile as he rose to go, and
  then&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Is there any reward offered?" she asked with interest.</p>

  <p>"There is some reward for her discovery," said Milton.</p>

  <p>"Then don't forget that I stand in," said the admirable lady, picking up
  her cards. She offered her thin hand and gave his a limp shake. As Milton
  made for the door she asked:</p>

  <p>"What will win the Derby?"</p>

  <p>"Down Under Donovan," replied the other with a smile.</p>

  <p>"You poor, funny thing," said Mrs. Thompson, as she dealt out the pack
  with great deliberation. Then, "cheer oh!"</p>

  <p>"Cheer oh!" replied Milton gravely, and closed the door behind him.</p>

  <p>Here was some information to go on, but to approach Mrs. Buncher might be
  a difficult matter. He was not exactly a persona grata with the folk of
  Pennwaring. If he had known all the circumstances before, he might have made
  better use of his opportunities, though it must be confessed that he had
  utilised the time he had spent at Sir George Frodmere's country seat to the
  greatest possible advantage. One fact he had proved beyond doubt was the
  discreditable part Toady Wilton had played in the separating of Eric's
  parents, but that information was not so important at the moment in view of
  the exposure of that gross man by Lord Chanderson.</p>

  <p>Milton Sands had hoped to secure some evidence as to the girl's
  whereabouts from the correspondence. He had this faint hope, that Toady
  Wilton had the girl up his sleeve ready to produce the moment opportunity
  offered. His hope here was doomed to disappointment. Whatever else was
  evident, it was clear that the man had no knowledge of the girl's present
  situation. He had arranged to meet Eric Stanton to lunch at his club that
  day, and he found Eric in the most cheerful and optimistic frame of mind,
  boisterously good-humoured, and there was such a contrast in their attitude
  towards life that the younger man remarked upon it.</p>

  <p>"You don't seem to be very cheerful."</p>

  <p>"I am cheerful enough," said Milton with a quiet smile, "only I have a lot
  to think about just now."</p>

  <p>"By Jove! so have I!" said the other. "I want you to devote as much
  attention as you possibly can to the lost formula. I have had another talk
  with old Mr. President only this morning. You have heard about the committee
  of the Lyons Exhibition and the offer they have made?"</p>

  <p>Milton nodded.</p>

  <p>"The latest time for receiving the formula is next week," Eric Stanton
  went on. "And if by any miracle you could discover that wretched document it
  would be an enormous thing for President. He was saying this morning that he
  would have sent it in himself, not only for the prize, but for the
  advertisement that would be secured by his success. It is rather pathetic,
  the faith he has in that formula."</p>

  <p>"Is he a rich man?" asked Milton.</p>

  <p>The other shook his head.</p>

  <p>"He is comfortably off," he said. "I think he has just a few thousand, and
  he is putting almost every penny he has on his horse."</p>

  <p>"Down Under Donovan?"</p>

  <p>"That is the fellow," smiled Eric. "From what I saw of the trial he will
  just about win the Derby. He made a hack of the Dean for a mile and a half;
  he held the old horse for speed, and stayed on to win his trial with the
  greatest ease. I put the clock on him, and he ran the distance in very nearly
  record time. Not that I take much notice of the time test."</p>

  <p>"I think you are wrong," said Milton with a smile. "You English people are
  too scornful of the clock, and you are always pointing out the fact that some
  of the best records are held by more or less indifferent horses, platers and
  the like. You seem to forget that had these indifferent horses met the best
  of their year, even the best of the classic horses in that particular race
  they must have beaten them."</p>

  <p>"I do not quite see what you mean," said Eric, interested.</p>

  <p>"Well, take your mile record, held by a comparatively poor horse, and take
  the best horse you have ever had in this last decade. Take Ormond, for
  instance. My contention&mdash;and it is the contention of all who swear by
  the clock&mdash;is that if Ormond had met your despised selling plater on the
  day on which he made his record, Ormond would have been beaten. It simply
  means that your record-maker was upon that particular day running in a
  condition of fitness and in such good heart that he would have beaten
  anything that was not so fortunately circumstanced. I think," he went on
  thoughtfully, "that Down Under Donovan will very nearly win."</p>

  <p>"Nearly win!" said the other in surprise. "What do you think will
  win?"</p>

  <p>A little smile played about the mouth of Milton Sands.</p>

  <p>"I think the Derby is a certainty for Sir George Frodmere's horse," he
  said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that?" asked the other. "Do you really think that Portonius
  will win?"</p>

  <p>"I say that it is a certainty for Sir George Frodmere's grey," smiled
  Milton Sands. "But what will happen after the race is run remains to be
  seen."</p>

  <p>"You are devilish mysterious this morning," said Eric with an irritated
  smile. "Kindly unravel the mystery for me."</p>

  <p>"You must wait for the Derby Day," said the other.</p>

  <p>The men rose and went out of the club together. Milton took farewell of
  his patron on the steps.</p>

  <p>"I think I may have something to report to you on the more important
  matter of your sister," he said. "I have a clue which at any rate is one
  which I can follow; and as to Mr. President's formula&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused. "Well," he went on with a bright smile, "we shall see. When is
  the result of the Lyons Examination to be published."</p>

  <p>"Curiously enough, on Derby Day," said Eric. Milton nodded.</p>

  <p>"Mr. John President may yet pull off a double," he said. "If you do not
  see me before, you will meet me at Epsom," and with an exchange of nods the
  men parted.</p>

  <p>The cottage which Sir George Frodmere had placed at the disposal of his
  trainer was one of the lodges guarding a drive through the Pennwaring estate
  to the house. It was a drive which was no longer used. Many little economies
  had to be practised by the heir to the Frodmere estates, and one of these was
  the discontinuance of the western drive. The wrought-iron gates admitting to
  the weed-strewn roadway were never opened now except by Mr. Buncher on his
  way to the village inn, and by his wife on his return. The remoteness of the
  lodge from the great house was all to Mr. Buncher's advantage. Loyal as he
  was in the service of his master, he had many qualities and many failings as
  to which he harboured no illusion. He knew, for instance, that Sir George
  Frodmere, though no temperance fanatic, was especially strict on the
  necessity for a trainer of a Derby favourite remaining sober at all hours of
  the day and night. He might, too, have views on the treatment of women, and
  Mr. Buncher was especially fortunate in his isolation, since the outcry of a
  beaten wife could not penetrate to any other human habitation. For Mr.
  Buncher, in his cups, was tremendously pugnacious, and since that pugnacity
  was, in the main, directed toward his wife, she, unhappy woman, did not have
  the rosiest of times.</p>

  <p>On an evening in May, Mr. Buncher departed, as was his wont, for "The Load
  of Hay," and he left behind a wife who heaved a sigh of relief as she heard
  the gates clang behind her lord and master. She was a thin creature, with
  that hard, yellow look which childlessness and drudgery bring to the face of
  womankind. Seventeen years of domestic slavery had destroyed what little soul
  there was in this crushed woman. She was ready to start and to jump at the
  slightest noise, and she had not been seated in her kitchen for five minutes
  before she rose with a smothered exclamation and a nervous look in her face
  at the sound of somebody shaking the gates outside. Thinking it was her
  husband returned, she hurried out, the key in her hand, but it was a stranger
  who looked at her through the ornamental ironwork.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Buncher?" he said pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said the woman.</p>

  <p>He was evidently a gentleman, she thought, and she judged not only from
  his dress but from his voice. He had a motor-car, too, a crowning cachet of
  respectability.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to see you for a few minutes upon a rather important
  matter."</p>

  <p>The woman hesitated. She had received strict orders to admit nobody into
  the grounds. But Mr. Buncher had never foreseen the possibility of her having
  a visitor, and his warning had, in the main, applied rather to unauthorised
  visitors to Sir George Frodmere.</p>

  <p>"I think it will be rather to your advantage," said Milton Sands
  enticingly. "To your advantage" is a phrase which has special significance to
  a certain type of newspaper reader. It suggests illimitable possibilities of
  legacies by far-away uncles, to mouldy and dust-covered moneys in the vaults
  of Chancery bankers. Mrs. Buncher was all of a fluster as she trembled the
  key into the lock and snapped back the bolt.</p>

  <p>"Will you come in, sir?" she said, and closed the gate after him. Milton
  was ushered into the parlour, and Mrs. Buncher dusted a spotless chair with
  her apron before she invited him to sit.</p>

  <p>"I will not keep you very long," said Milton Sands, who had timed his
  visit to follow the departure for Mr. Buncher in his evening search of liquid
  refreshment. "Some time ago you were in the employment of Mrs. Stanton."</p>

  <p>The woman hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," she said.</p>

  <p>"You know that Mrs. Stanton went away from her husband, taking her little
  girl, and you, I believe, went with her."</p>

  <p>"That is quite true, sir," said Mrs. Buncher. "She was very good to me was
  Mrs. Stanton, and old Mr. Stanton was a brute to treat her as he did."</p>

  <p>She was prepared to go on dilating upon the morality of the situation, but
  Milton stopped her gently.</p>

  <p>"How long were you with Mrs. Stanton after she left her husband?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Buncher looked up at the ceiling for inspiration.</p>

  <p>"I was with her for two years, a year in England and a year in Bruges. I
  came back to England with her after she left Belgium, and it was in London
  where I left her. Her money was running short, and some of the shares she had
  were not paying the dividends they used to pay. I don't rightly understand
  it," she said with a rare smile, "but the cause of the trouble was something
  like that."</p>

  <p>"You know, I suppose," said Milton, "that a reward was offered by young
  Mr. Stanton for the discovery of his sister?"</p>

  <p>The woman nodded.</p>

  <p>"I heard something about it," she said. "But it was no use my applying
  because I knew nothing about her."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. What was her address when she came to London?"</p>

  <p>Milton scribbled down the address the woman gave him.</p>

  <p>It was in Hornsey, and, as he judged, a boarding­house.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything about the child which you would recognise?"</p>

  <p>The woman smiled.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, sir! " she said. "There was the snake."</p>

  <p>"The snake?" repeated the other quickly. "What was that?"</p>

  <p>"We used to call it the snake," said the woman with her thin smile, "it
  was a yellow birthmark round her ankle&mdash;it looked just like a snake,
  head and eyes complete. They used to say&mdash;" She stopped.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" encouraged Milton.</p>"I don't like saying anything against a
  gentleman... he's staying here now...<br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Mr. Wilton... but Madame hated him ... we
  always called him 'the</span><br>
  snake'&mdash;even Madame did... and that it was because she was always
  thinking so much about him and hating him so much..." She stopped, a little
  frightened.

  <p>"That is something to go on," smiled Milton.</p>

  <p>Further conversation was interrupted by a loud knocking at the door of the
  little lodge, and the woman rose up in a fluster.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Buncher," said a voice outside, and Milton recognised it as Sir
  George's.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, in a low voice, "you had better not let Sir George
  know I am here. Where can I go?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Go through along the passage into the kitchen," said the woman,
  remembering in a panic the injunction she had received from her husband to
  admit nobody through the lodge gates.</p>

  <p>She waited till the door closed behind her visitor, then she opened to Sir
  George.</p>

  <p>"Where is your husband?" asked the baronet sharply.</p>

  <p>"He has gone into the village, sir," she said.</p>

  <p>"Go and find him," said the baronet. He stood waiting on the threshold,
  tapping his booted leg impatiently.</p>

  <p>The woman hesitated, then ran into her room and got her hat.</p>

  <p>She could only pray that the unknown stranger would not betray his
  presence.</p>

  <p>Sir George waited till the iron gates closed behind her, then he turned to
  Toady.</p>

  <p>"You are perfectly sure?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly sure," said Toady, who was purple with excitement. "I could not
  mistake the man again."</p>

  <p>"I thought his ship was leaving the day before the Derby?"</p>

  <p>"He may have got leave," said the other, "or been transferred to another
  boat."</p>

  <p>"It is rather unfortunate," said Sir George.</p>

  <p>They were pacing slowly the little garden path which ran along one side of
  the lodge, and they came to a halt outside the kitchen window.</p>

  <p>"That this infernal purser should be interested in racing is bad enough,
  that he should be able to stop over and see the Derby run is worse, but that
  he should come down here to Pennwaring to nose around and see for himself the
  horse at exercise is disastrous. You are sure he saw the gallop?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly sure," said Toady. "You see, your galloping the horse in the
  afternoon, Sir George, if you don't mind my saying so, is a mistake from
  every point of view. The gallop is all right, because that is pretty free
  from observation, but returning to the stable he had to come within a hundred
  yards of the wall, and I was standing watching Buncher riding him back when I
  happened to look round, and there was our bold purser, as large as life,
  sitting on the top of the wall with a pair of field glasses."</p>

  <p>Sir George frowned.</p>

  <p>"He has suspected all along," he said shortly. "Do you remember what he
  said about the pity of El Rey being sent to the stud when he could win so
  many races? He has smelt a rat, and he has come down to investigate. Tell me
  again, what did you do?"</p>

  <p>Toady glowed with pride.</p>

  <p>"I did not lose my head," he said. "I just looked up at him and in an
  instant I collected myself. In moments like this," he explained modestly, "I
  can always&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't talk about yourself so much," said Sir George testily. "Tell me
  what happened. I know what you can do in moments of crisis. I have had plenty
  of evidence of your qualities."</p>

  <p>"I simply said 'Good afternoon,'" said the mortified Mr. Wilton, "and
  exchanged a few words about the horse. I asked him if he would like to visit
  the stable and have a look at him, and he&mdash;accepted."</p>

  <p>"We shall have to decide what to do when we have seen Buncher, Wilton," he
  said, slapping his palm with his fist. "I want money very badly. If anything
  should go wrong now, or come between us and our coup, I hardly know what I
  should do. We must find out how much this purser knows and how much he
  guesses. This much I tell you, that he must be silenced at all costs."</p>

  <p>Toady nodded. He grasped the gravity of the situation, for a large portion
  of his own capital was invested on the chances of the grey.</p>

  <p>"Here he is," said Sir George in a lower tone. He stood at the corner of
  the building which commanded a view of the gate. The stranger came at the
  same time as Mr. Buncher, hastily summoned by his wife, returned, and they
  all three came through the gate together. The woman cast an anxious glance at
  the window of the kitchen, but caught no sign of the visitor. She had hoped
  that he would have availed himself of whatever opportunity offered to clear
  away. Sir George jerked his head significantly in the direction of the
  woman.</p>

  <p>"All right," growled Buncher to his wife. "We shan't want you any
  more."</p>

  <p>"Do you want the use of the parlour?" she asked timidly.</p>

  <p>"No, we will talk in the open-air, if you please, Mrs. Buncher," said Sir
  George. Then: "This is Mr. Delane;" he introduced the new-comer. He
  recognised him at once as the purser who had brought the grey home to
  England.</p>

  <p>Buncher scowled at the visitor and murmured something.</p>

  <p>"I understand you had a gratuitous view of my Derby horse finishing his
  preparation," said Sir George.</p>

  <p>The purser nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think of him?" bantered the baronet.</p>

  <p>The purser paused as though shaping his words.</p>

  <p>"I think that he goes very well," he said.</p>

  <p>"You saw him galloped, then?" said the baronet in surprise.</p>

  <p>"I just caught a glimpse of him," replied the other. "Not exactly at full
  stretch, but finishing his gallop."</p>

  <p>"A nice horse, don't you think?" suggested Sir George, carelessly. His
  eyes did not leave the officer's face.</p>

  <p>"Remarkably nice." There was a dryness in the other's tone which was
  significant.</p>

  <p>But Sir George was too old a strategist to demand an explanation for the
  implied doubt.</p>

  <p>"Do you think he will win the Derby?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The purser nodded.</p>

  <p>"He will lead the field past the post," he said cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"I see," said the baronet.</p>

  <p>Not another word was spoken. Sir George was biting his finger nails
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I should like you to come up to the house," he said, and the purser
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"I would rather not, Sir George, if you don't mind," he answered politely
  enough. "I have to be back in London to-night."</p>

  <p>"By the way, will you be at Epsom?" asked Sir George. Then, as the other
  nodded, the baronet continued, "I thought you would be on the sea by
  now&mdash;you are very fortunate."</p>

  <p>The purser's lips twitched.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, I ought to be," he said. "But I am taking our new
  ship out in September, and the Company have given me leave till then." Again
  there was silence. Then&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Do you know Moscow at all?" asked the baronet carelessly.</p>

  <p>"I do not," said the seaman in surprise. "Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>"I was wondering whether you would care to undertake a little commission
  for me. I am expecting some very important news which will necessitate my
  having a trusted agent in that city, and it has occurred to me that you are
  the very man for the job; ­it would be an excellent and profitable method of
  filling up your spare time. What I should want you to do would be to go to
  Moscow. I should ask you to put up at the very best hotel there, and wait
  till you received my instructions. I would pay you handsomely&mdash;that is
  to say," with a shrug of his shoulders, "I would allow you fifty pounds a
  week for your expenses, and pay you another fifty for your services. You
  would probably be there for six weeks, you would have an opportunity of
  seeing a most beautiful part of Russia, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And," said the purser quietly, "I should be out of England. Thank you,
  Sir George, I would rather not."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps if I made it two hundred a week," suggested the baronet. "That
  would work out at some twelve hundred pounds for a very pleasant stay."</p>

  <p>The purser was not a rich man, and he hesitated.</p>

  <p>After all, it was no business of his, he thought. Here was an opportunity
  which might never occur again in his lifetime. He was a perfectly honest man,
  and, like many another, and with as delicate a sense of probity, he applied
  the test of honour only to those actions and happenings directly affecting
  himself. Besides, no word had been passed yet which had made the acceptance
  of Sir George's offer impossible. The baronet, with his multifarious
  interests, might very well have genuine business in Moscow.</p>

  <p>"I will think about it," he said.</p>

  <p>"Decide now," said Sir George, with a cheery smile, "and leave for Moscow
  to-night. Are you a married man?"</p>

  <p>The purser shook his head.</p>

  <p>"That makes things all the easier," Sir George went on. "You can catch the
  eight o'clock train from Liverpool Street for the Hook of Holland, and pick
  up the Moscow express at the Hook or at Amsterdam. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>The man hesitated. He had an uncomfortable feeling that he was not acting
  as he intended, and as all his better nature suggested he should, but after
  all, this business of racing had nothing to do with him. He was not so sure
  that a swindle was involved. After all, there is a great deal of likeness
  between grey horses.</p>

  <p>"And while you are there," Sir George went on, "perhaps you would like to
  renew acquaintance with your old friend the grey. He is in Soltykoff's stud."
  He said this off-handedly, as though it were a matter of indifference whether
  the purser accepted or not, but it offered a straw at which an outraged
  conscience might grasp.</p>

  <p>"I will go," said the purser.</p>

  <p>"Come to the house and fix it up," said Sir George.</p>

  <p>He led the way, talking cheerily of everything in the world except horse-
  racing.</p>

  <p>Since Mr. Buncher had not been formally dis­missed, he made a tentative
  fourth to the party, a fortunate circumstance, since it enabled Milton Sands
  to retire gracefully from a position which might very easily have embarrassed
  him.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; AN UNEXPECTED VISIT</h2>

  <p class="first">A WEEK had passed, a very full week for Milton Sands, a very
  anxious week for old John President, up and about from daybreak till sunset,
  watching the progress of his Derby candidate. It was on the Saturday
  preceding the Derby when it seemed that the world talked of nothing else but
  the chances of the dozen candidates, that Eric Stanton rode across the Downs
  with Milton at his side. He was disturbed in his mind. The previous night he
  had seen a new John President, a John President with all the rash confidence
  of a man sixty years younger than himself.</p>

  <p>Milton Sands, a guest at the big house&mdash;Eric Stanton was lord of the
  manor at Teuton Brierly, on the other edge of the Downs&mdash;was the
  recipient of Eric's fears.</p>

  <p>"It is not that I am afraid of the old man losing his money," he said,
  "because that can easily be replaced, but I fear the awful effect that a
  defeat will have upon him. You see he is a very old man, and he is putting
  all his hopes upon this colt. If Down Under Donovan is beaten I don't know
  what will happen to John President, and I have a special reason for wanting
  him to be happy just now."</p>

  <p>He saw Milton Sands' keen eyes upon him and the laughter behind those
  eyes, and went red.</p>

  <p>"I think I understand," said Milton quietly, "but you must trust me now. I
  do not think it matters what happens next week."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked the other in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Just what I say," bantered Milton. "Allow me to be mysterious. It is my
  proper role. I saw Soltykoff yesterday," he went on, "he was in his most
  exuberant condition, and reminded me of the time when he and a few friends of
  his parted me from money which I could ill spare, a very ill-timed and
  senseless piece of reminiscence," he smiled. "Honestly I don't wish to be
  offensively mysterious, but just now I am rather busy on one or two things,
  more especially with your own private business, and things are working
  out."</p>

  <p>"Is there any hope?" asked Eric quickly.</p>

  <p>"About your sister, I think there is great hope," said the other quietly.
  "I have succeeded in tracing your mother and the child to a little suburban
  boarding house, and I am well on the way to following this up with what I
  believe will be a more important discovery."</p>

  <p>Eric nodded.</p>

  <p>"You don't know what that means to me," he said. "Night and day my sister
  is seldom out of my mind. I feel as though I were a thief living on her
  money, enjoying the luxury which she is denied&mdash;she may even be in
  absolute want," he said bitterly, and Milton patted him on the back.</p>

  <p>"I should not worry too much about it," he said kindly. "I think we are
  going to have a horrible week of revelations, with Milton Sands everlastingly
  in the limelight, receiving the plaudits and bouquets of his enraptured
  friends."</p>

  <p>He had an appointment with the woman who kept the boarding-house in
  Norbury, that boarding­house which had sheltered Mrs. Stanton in her
  penury.</p>

  <p>Madam Burford (so the sometime Norbury land­lady described herself) was
  now the prosperous proprietress of a private hotel at Brighton, and Milton
  found her without any difficulty.</p>

  <p>Yes, she could distinctly remember Mrs. Stanton, could even place him in
  possession of facts of which he was ignorant, and indeed could give him a
  good deal of information which he instinctively knew would be most valuable.
  Mrs. Stanton had left her to go to another boarding-house in Bloomsbury, and
  Madam Burford fortunately was a methodical person who kept an address
  book.</p>

  <p>"But," she said, copying out the address, and looking up with a little
  smile, "you are rather late in coming for this information."</p>

  <p>"Why do you say that?" asked Milton, suddenly interested.</p>

  <p>"I mean that you are the second person who has been here for news
  regarding Mrs. Stanton and her child."</p>

  <p>"Who was the other?" asked Milton quickly.</p>

  <p>"A lady," replied Mrs. Burford, scribbling busily. "A Mrs. Gordon
  Thompson."</p>

  <p>Milton smothered an exclamation under his breath.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Gordon Thompson! Why should she develop this sudden interest in the
  missing people? Then he remembered the reward, and smiled. He would have to
  get very busy, he thought, to take the chance of coming in a bad second at
  the end of his investigations.</p>

  <p>His fear of Mrs. Gordon Thompson's activity was well justified, for that
  admirable lady had followed a swift course across London, tacking from
  Kilburn to Bloomsbury, from Bloomsbury to Balham, and back to Bloomsbury
  again, and she learned quite enough to justify an excursion which was very
  unusual, and which, it may be added, was by no means pleasing to the
  gentleman affected.</p>

  <p>Sir George Frodmere received a telegram which was brief and
  decisive.</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">"AM COMING BY ELEVEN-FOURTEEN TRAIN, HAVE YOUR CAR TO
  MEET,&mdash;GEORGINA."</p><br>

  <p>"Now, what the devil does she want?" he asked irritably. There was no love
  lost between brother and sister, for if they were not bad friends they were
  at least antagonistic to this extent, that Sir George greatly
  disliked&mdash;and in his dislike was a measure of fear&mdash;the caustic
  tongue of his relative. There were times when he found her useful and was not
  above employing her, but he had never, in his most tender, fraternal moments,
  contemplated inviting her to share his solitude at Pennwaring.</p>

  <p>"I suppose we shall have to put her up. You can go down and meet her,
  Toady," he said. "I shall go to town to-morrow, and you can entertain her."
  Toady, by no means pleased at the prospect, muttered incoherently and vaguely
  of an engagement he himself had with a man.</p>

  <p>"Let him wait," said Sir George. "I cannot be bothered by Georgina and her
  infernal scandal." Toady met the lady at the station with extravagant
  effusion.</p>

  <p>"We have been looking forward to your coming," he said, as he shook her
  limp hand; "and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't lie, Toady," she said briskly. "George loathes and hates the idea
  of my coming, but he must put up with me for two days and it may be a very
  excellent thing for him that he does."</p>

  <p>She flounced into the car, and her meagre baggage was strapped on behind.
  Toady, after some attempts to make conversation without any better result
  than evoking a grunt or two from the lady, herself preoccupied, relapsed into
  silence.</p>

  <p>As they were nearing the house Mrs. Gordon Thompson turned suddenly upon
  her companion.</p>

  <p>"Is George going to win the Derby?"</p>

  <p>"We all fervently hope so," said her unwilling companion, cautiously.</p>

  <p>"Sir George does not put his money on hopes," she said in her incisive
  way. "He backs absolute certainties, and I am curious to know why he is so
  very sanguine about the chance of this horse of his."</p>

  <p>"Doubtless he will tell you," said the diplomatic Toady Wilton, who had no
  desire to be cross-examined by this terrible lady.</p>

  <p>He was relieved when the car came to a stop before the broad steps of the
  house. Sir George was waiting on the terrace above with a scowl which could
  be by no stretch of imagination construed into a look of welcome.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" he said, ungraciously, as the lady came up the steps, "what
  brings you down here?"</p>

  <p>"Your fortune and future, George," she replied shortly. "I could not bear
  to think of you alone here with no other person near you in your hour of
  trial than Toady; it kept me awake at night."</p>

  <p>He led the way to the library. Mrs. Gordon Thompson detested
  drawing-rooms. She took a cigarette up from the box on the baronet's desk
  without invitation, and lit it.</p>

  <p>"You need not wait, Toady," she said brusquely, and thus unceremoniously
  dismissed, the stout man waddled away heartily cursing Mrs. Gordon Thompson
  and her discourtesy, but having the good sense to utter his curses under his
  breath.</p>

  <p>When they were left alone the baronet turned from his contemplation of the
  park through the window.</p>

  <p>"Well, Georgina?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"George," she said, plunging straight into the matter at hand. "I think it
  is about time you married."</p>

  <p>"Exactly, why have you arrived at this startling conclusion?" he asked in
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"I think a good marriage might save you from very serious trouble," she
  said. "You see, I know enough about you and your little games to realise that
  you are always on the edge of the law, and that there is a danger that one of
  these days you will go tottering over to your destruction."</p>

  <p>"Have you got religion or something?" he asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Nothing so clean or wholesome," replied the calm lady. "I am the same
  Georgina, unaltered and undiluted; I have come down on business&mdash;and
  virtue is a paying business, believe me."</p>

  <p>"And in what way are my virtues to be exercised?" he asked with a half
  smile.</p>

  <p>"In a good, permanent marriage," she replied, "with a lady worth half a
  million in her own right. How does that strike you?"</p>

  <p>"It strikes me as being decidedly comic and reminiscent somewhat of the
  tales of my long de­parted youth," said Sir George, stroking his fair,
  drooping moustache. "But where is the fair lady to be found? I must confess
  that I have sought her without any great measure of success for some­thing
  like twenty years. But whilst beauty has been kind, the monied beauty has
  been cold, and even plutocratic plainness has shied in the face of my
  disinterested attentions."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Gordon Thompson composed herself on the edge of the settee, swinging
  her thin ankles in the sheer enjoyment of her ease.</p>

  <p>"I think I have discovered her, and you can sail in and take her. She is
  in fairly poor circumstances, and there is nothing for you to do but to be
  the good and chivalrous knight who is prepared to marry beneath you, only "
  She warned him with a shake of her finger. "Not only must you be prepared,
  but you must marry the lady and that as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>He looked at her through his half-closed eyes.</p>

  <p>"Where do you come in, Georgina?" he asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"I come in on the usual ten per cent, basis," said his practical sister.
  "I don't suppose you will be able to handle all the money she has, but at any
  rate you will be in a position in a year's time to pay me a pretty
  substantial sum for my services. By the time the lady's identity is revealed
  you should have established yourself in her affections to such good purpose
  that she would be willing to leave the management of her affairs in your
  kindly hands."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Sir George. "And who is the lady and where is she to be
  found?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Gordon Thompson's smile was one of considerable amusement.</p>

  <p>"You do not suppose for one moment that I should tell you that, do you?"
  she asked archily. "My dear George, what a simpleton you must think I am. No,
  I want this arrangement written down in black and white, and an agreement
  drawn up as between George Mortimer Maxwell Frodmere on the one part
  (hereinafter called the husband), and Georgina Heloise Gordon Thompson on the
  other part (hereinafter called the agent). It has to be set out in proper
  form, stamped and sealed and provided with all the safeguards which my
  ingenious lawyer can devise before I move a step in the matter."</p>

  <p>Sir George stood in his thoughtful attitude for some minutes, his hand
  caressing his moustache, his pale, blue eyes scrutinising his sister.</p>

  <p>"There is an idea in that, Georgina," he said with a mildness in
  noticeable contrast to his previous uncompromising attitude, "I have not so
  far been very fortunate with my marriage ventures."</p>

  <p>"You are not married?" she interrupted quickly. He shook his head with a
  smile.</p>

  <p>"I am thinking of the attempts I have made to enter that holy and
  responsible state," he explained. "So far they have proved abortive. I think
  your idea is distinctly promising," he repeated, approvingly. "Now we will
  get to work at once, and I will have my lawyer draw up an agreement&mdash;I
  will wire him down to-day."</p>

  <p>"You might wire mine at the same time," she suggested.</p>

  <p>"That is not necessary, is it?" he asked in pained remonstrance.</p>

  <p>"Awfully necessary when I am dealing with you, George," she smiled. "You
  see I know you."</p>

  <p>"So you do," he said, as though the idea struck him for the first
  time.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Sir George Frodmere did not leave for London the next
  morning as he had threatened, but Toady Wilton did, delighted at the
  opportunity the change in Sir George's attitude afforded. There had been so
  much money come into the market lately for Down Under Donovan that Portonius
  had eased in price. It was a chance not to be lightly missed, and Toady
  Wilton was gathering up all his financial reserve to plunge upon Sir George
  Frodmere's grey. He had good reason to be satisfied with his immediate
  prospects. Every trial they had had in the seclusion of Pennwaring Park had
  pointed unmistakably to the fact that Portonius would be an easy winner of
  the great classic. The Argentine importation seemed to have thrived on his
  work, and was relatively a better horse than he had ever been in his life.
  The only danger that the man had feared was that the change of climate would
  have produced a loss of form, and now that that danger had been dissipated it
  seemed in this admittedly poor year, when the three-year-old form was all
  topsy-turvy and the class of the horses engaged in the Derby so far below the
  average, that the spoils would come to Sir George's party. Toady drove
  straight from the station to the office of his commission agent and was
  immediately shown in. The young man who sat behind the handsome desk bore no
  resemblance to the bookmaker of fiction. He was quietly dressed and his face
  was refined to a point of aestheticism.</p>

  <p>His rimless eyeglasses, the absence of all jewellery, and the general
  decorum of his surroundings might have suggested to the uninitiated who had
  strolled into the office that he had made a mistake and had entered the
  sanctum of a young bank manager with literary tendencies.</p>

  <p>"How is the horse?" he asked, as he pushed a silver cigarette box across
  the desk.</p>

  <p>"As fit as anything," replied Toady. "But the market is behaving in a
  queer way."</p>

  <p>Mr. Gursley nodded.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know that somebody is laying your horse?"</p>

  <p>"Laying it?" replied the other. "Laying against it?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The commission agent nodded.</p>

  <p>"You can get all the sixes you want about Portonius," he said. "I could
  have had six thousand to a thousand or thirty thousand to five thousand if I
  had wanted it yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Who is the agent offering it?" asked Toady, eagerly. "Is he a man of
  substance?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly, he is not offering odds on his own behalf, you know," said Mr.
  Gursley, with a smile. "He is acting for a client. I believe you could get
  the bet now if you wanted it."</p>

  <p>He pulled the telephone towards him, and called up a racing club in Jennyn
  Street.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Payne?" he asked, and in a few moments the man he had inquired for
  was at the other end of the wire.</p>

  <p>"You were offering thirty thousand to five Portonius for the Derby
  yesterday. Is the offer still open?"</p>

  <p>"It is," said the voice promptly.</p>

  <p>Gursley covered the transmitter with his hand and looked up at Toady
  Wilton.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to take that bet?"</p>

  <p>Toady nodded.</p>

  <p>"Lay me thirty thousand to five, Portonius," said the commission agent,
  and, as he hung the receiver up, he said quietly:</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know that you and your friends are pretty heavily
  committed?"</p>

  <p>"What do we stand to lose?" asked Toady.</p>

  <p>"Something like twenty thousand pounds," said the other. "And so far I
  have only got about ten thousand of yours in hand."</p>

  <p>Toady smiled.</p>

  <p>"Is it necessary or lawful that one should put one's money down?" he asked
  pointedly.</p>

  <p>"It is not lawful," replied the quiet man, "but it is very necessary
  before I go any further. Even now I am not sure that I shall stand that bet I
  have made unless I have a deposit. You see, Mr. Wilton, when one is dealing
  in large sums one cannot be too careful. I know it is against the law for me
  to ask for a deposit, but I have only undertaken this com­mission on that
  understanding, and you will have to make up the balance required before
  to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>"That is easily done," said the other.</p>

  <p>Soltykoff was in London, and Soltykoff would supply all deficiencies.
  Toady was ignorant at the time of Soltykoff's individual and private
  investment on the horse. The stout man drove at once to the Russian's hotel,
  and had the good fortune to find him. Mr. Soltykoff was in an obliging mood,
  and the transaction which resulted in the balance of the money being
  deposited with the commission agent, was completed within a quarter of an
  hour after Toady arrived.</p>

  <p>"Of course, it is monstrous that he should ask for it," said Toady, "and I
  doubt whether we will give him another commission, but our profit is going to
  be enormous my friend."</p>

  <p>"You may be sure," said Soltykoff, "that if I did not think so I would not
  have risked my good money."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; DERBY DAY</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE is no scene so stirring to the imagination and so full
  of food for the philosopher's thought as Epsom Downs upon a Derby day.</p>

  <p>The hill was black with people, the gay booths and the banners of the
  outside bookmakers made a patchwork of colour to relieve the sombre black of
  the great throng. Along the rails for half a mile beyond Tattenham Corner the
  people were packed like sardines and the elect club enclosure was
  uncomfortably thronged. Black, too, were the stands from roof to lowest tier;
  every box had its full complement, every vantage was crowded. Over all hung
  the low ceaseless roar of a quarter of a million people all talking at once,
  a roar pierced with the shrill cries of the layers or the inevitable blare of
  coach horns. There was a gay party in Eric Stanton's box. Mary President was
  there you may be sure; Milton Sands and his secretary, the shy Janet Symonds,
  and John President, completed as cheery a party as was gathered that day on
  Epsom Downs. Mary gazed across the sea of humanity, her lips parted in
  wonder, her eyes filled with amazement at this extraordinary spectacle.</p>

  <p>She turned to Eric, who stood behind her.</p>

  <p>"It is very wonderful," she said in a low voice, "and almost
  terrifying."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"It terrifies me," he said, "not so much the latent possibilities of the
  people as the infernal probabilities of this race."</p>

  <p>"But you think Down Under Donovan will win?" she said, looking up to him
  with a startled expression. He nodded.</p>

  <p>"For myself I do," he said, "but Milton Sands does not share my
  opinion."</p>

  <p>He turned to the Australian.</p>

  <p>"I think I interpret your views aright," he said. Milton shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"I did not say that you would not win the race; I simply said that Down
  Under Donovan would be beaten to-day."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you have to be mysterious," said Eric, caustically. "It is part
  of the atmosphere of your calling."</p>

  <p>"You have got it," said the cheery young man, and returned his gaze upon
  the crowd. Looking down into the club enclosure he picked out Sir George
  Frodmere and his crony. They stood together near the rails, in the one clear
  space that the ring offered, and they were talking earnestly. He wondered
  what common ground these two men found for tolerance of one another, and
  grinned as he saw Toady Wilton's eye raised to the box to meet his, for on
  Toady's face appeared the ugliest of scowls.</p>

  <p>"You will scowl some before I have done with you," said Milton, half to
  himself. He saw the jovial Soltykoff, beautiful to behold, with the shiniest
  of silk hats, and the largest of cigars. He was alone, and apparently he
  enjoyed his solitude. Here was another man, thought Milton Sands, to whom the
  events of this day would come in the nature of a shock. Some such possibility
  had occurred to Sir George Frodmere, and that was the topic of his
  conversation as he stood by the iron railings which divided the course from
  the enclosure.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what is going to happen to-day, Toady," he said irritably.
  "But I have an uncomfortable feeling that things are not going as well as we
  hoped."</p>

  <p>"The market seems to think different," said Toady Wilton, with good
  humour. "They are offering five to two on your horse, and it is difficult to
  get that price to any large money."</p>

  <p>"If I lose this race," said Sir George, thoughtfully, "I'm afraid you will
  lose a good home, Toady."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" gasped Mr. Wilton in a panic, for he had a horror of
  change which reacted to his disadvantage.</p>

  <p>"I mean just what I say," said Sir George. "If I lose this I am going to
  get married."</p>

  <p>"Married?" repeated Toady, incredulously. "Whatever put that idea into
  your head?"</p>

  <p>Sir George smiled.</p>

  <p>"It was put into my head by a very commercial-minded friend of mine," he
  said evasively. "But the origin of the idea is not likely to be of so much
  interest as the result."</p>

  <p>"Have you asked the lady?" demanded Toady curiously.</p>

  <p>Sir George shook his head.</p>

  <p>"There isn't time for asking," he said briefly, and the ugly little look
  which came into his face was not pleasant to see.</p>

  <p>"As it happens," he said, "the lady has her affections placed elsewhere
  and is unlikely to be moved by any argument of mine. I have made inquiries
  and have discovered this fact to my dis­comfort. It will be necessary to
  adopt a very desperate expedient smacking somewhat of mediaeval methods, but
  I hope you understand, Toady, that if anything goes wrong to-day our position
  is so desperate that it justifies all forms of minor desperation."</p>

  <p>"But nothing will go wrong," said Toady fretfully.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter? Is the horse?"</p>

  <p>"The horse is all right," said Sir George. "He is fitter now than ever he
  was in his life, and in my heart of hearts I think he will win, but there are
  other possibilities."</p>

  <p>"You are quite sure that the real Portonius went to Belgium?" asked Toady
  suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Why do you ask that?" demanded Sir George, with a frown. "I have never
  had any doubts on the subject&mdash;have you?"</p>

  <p>"I only made the remark at random," said the other feebly.</p>

  <p>"Then please don't ask such jackass questions," said the angry baronet. "I
  have enough to worry me without your evolving hypotheses."</p>

  <p>Sir George indeed stood at a moment of crisis. A pleasant and amiable
  villain, ever with an eye to the main chance, and with no scruples as to the
  means he should employ to grasp it, there had come to him, as there must come
  to every man who lives by his wits, a time which could not be tided over. He
  had reached the end of his resources. He had risked not only his meagre
  fortune, not only the influences which Soltykoff brought with his immense
  fortune and his unscrupulous methods, but he was risking also his personal
  liberty, and, curiously enough, what was to him the most important risk, his
  honour. To be warned off the Turf would have broken this man. Underlying his
  perversity were all the instincts of his class. He might cut a more gallant
  figure in the dock of the Old Bailey than he would in the "Racing Gazette."
  He moved through the gateway on to the course, and strolled along to the
  paddock, and there he remained until the great space was thronged with the
  Derby crowd which had come to take its last look at the horses before the
  supreme ordeal.</p>

  <p>"Here they come!"</p>

  <p>There was a roar of voices as the field came out to parade in single file,
  each horse led by his stable attendant, each it seemed to the uninitiated eye
  fit to run for a ransom. A brave sight in the gorgeous June sunlight was the
  Derby field; jockeys gay and shimmering in their new silks, snow-white
  breeches against the polished coats of the horses; the suspense and the
  expectancy of it all. The parade was over all too soon for Mary President,
  and there was a long delay as the field threaded its way through the crowd
  across to the starting post. A longer delay there, for there were several
  horses which had not the slightest desire in the world to line up before the
  fluttering white tape.</p>

  <p>Portonius was a conspicuous figure because of his colour. He was drawn on
  the outside and was one of the quietest of the horses there. Down Under
  Donovan, a little nervous, as though he realised the immense issues of the
  race, backed and sidled and twisted and turned under the patient hands of his
  jockey a dozen times before he consented to put his nose to the tapes, and
  then no sooner had he got up than Mangla, Lord Sanberry's handsome chestnut,
  remembered some pressing engagement in the paddock and bolted in that
  direction. Again and again, with exemplary patience, the starter brought them
  into line, and then there was a whisk of white tape as it shot quivering into
  the air and the field leapt forward.</p>

  <p>"They're off."</p>

  <p>The roar of voices was deafening, almost menacing to Mary President's
  ears. She felt her heart beating faster, the colour leaving her face, and the
  hands that rested on the ledge before her trembled. Eric was behind her,
  Milton Sands had disappeared. She wondered, even in that moment, why he
  should have missed this great race, but Milton's interests were elsewhere at
  that moment. The field was all together as it raced up the hill, that stiff
  climb which is the first test of a Derby horse's stamina. Samborino, the
  sprinting son of Sir Eager, had established a clear lead and was two lengths
  ahead of his field. After, came in one bunch, Mangla, Texter and Portonius
  the grey running smoothly on the outside, and at his heels, with no less
  freedom of action, came Down Under Donovan with long effortless strides.</p>

  <p>"Donny is going well," muttered John President, his glasses to his eyes,
  following the field as it came along the top of the ground on that one
  straight level gallop which gives a horse a chance to prepare for the trying
  downhill run. Now they were approaching the crucial part of the race.
  Positions changed rapidly; Mangla fell back a beaten horse as they started to
  descend to Tattenham Comer, and Texter raced up to Samborino! At the corner,
  as the field swung into the straight, Samborino was beaten; you saw him fall
  back as though he was stopping, and Texter, on the rails, took the lead clear
  of Portonius and Down Under Donovan, now racing neck to neck, with the rest
  of the field two lengths behind. It was obvious now that between these three
  horses lay the issue.</p>

  <p>"It is going to be a fight," said Eric, aquiver with excitement.</p>

  <p>Then the grey came up to the leader and Down Under Donovan took his place
  on the outside of the three, and so head to head, they came to the distance
  where the jockeys sat down to ride their charges in grim earnest, with hand
  and heel, but with never the lift of a whip, pushing their mounts desperately
  to the last stretch. The roar of the crowd was almost deafening, it seemed
  impossible that it could increase in volume, yet suddenly it did, almost with
  a whoop, as Texter faltered and fell back, leaving Down Under Donovan and the
  grey to fight out the finish.</p>

  <p>"Don't whip him, don't whip him," muttered John President, his eyes
  blazing with excitement. "Let him run his race."</p>

  <p>It was as though he was speaking into the jockey's ear, and so well had
  his instructions been given, and so perfectly disciplined was the rider, that
  he obeyed those instructions. Now the whip was up on' the grey. Twice it
  descended and he forged ahead; his neck was in front.</p>

  <p>"Now," roared John President.</p>

  <p>As if in obedience, the jockey on Down Under Donovan raised his whip. Only
  once it fell upon the horse's withers, and he leapt ahead. Neck and neck the
  jockeys rode with their hands, the winning post less than half a dozen yards
  away. Before either could raise whip again they had flashed past, head to
  head.</p>

  <p>"I think it was a dead heat," said Eric, white with excitement. For an
  instant a deadly silence held the crowd, then slowly a number rose by the
  judge's box.</p>

  <p>Portonius had won by a head. Eric turned swiftly to the old man. His face
  was set and he looked terribly aged, every line in his healthy countenance
  seemed deeper than it had been before, but there was one in the box who had
  the means of restoring his colour. Milton Sands came quickly through the door
  and caught him by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Mr. President," he said in a low voice, "I want one word with you."</p>

  <p>Whatever that was, it had a most tonic effect, and as Mary President went
  to her grandfather and laid her hand on his arm, her eyes, filled with tears,
  upturned to his, he was smiling.</p>

  <p>"I am so sorry, dear," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Don't be sorry yet, my darling," he patted her cheeks. "You are going to
  see strange developments."</p>

  <p>The crowd had surged on to the course now, a great throng of twenty
  thousand people stood solid before the unsaddling enclosure, and it was with
  difficulty that the police cleared a way for the returning horses.</p>

  <p>Your Derby crowd is delightfully impartial. They offer applause
  indiscriminately, and Portonius came back with Sir George leading him to the
  accompaniment of the same cheers which would have greeted the owner of any
  other victorious horse.</p>

  <p>The favourite had won the Derby. As men were talking excitedly,
  complacently or bitterly, according to their temperaments or the effect the
  result had had upon their finances, the news was being flashed forth to the
  world, throbbing presses of Fleet Street were flinging out their sheets by
  the thousand to tell the stay-at-home punter. Cables were humming under a
  dozen seas, carrying the news to the far quarters of the earth, "Portonius
  has won the Derby."</p>

  <p>The jockey was on the scales under the eyes of the stewards. The clerk of
  the scales had the words "All right," framed on his tongue&mdash;words that
  would result in a settlement and the exchange of hundreds of thousands of
  pounds, when Milton Sands pushed his way into the weighing-room and handed a
  sheet of paper to the senior steward. The steward read, looked up quickly at
  the clerk of the scales.</p>

  <p>"Don't give the 'All right' yet," he said, and read aloud:</p>

  <p>"I object to Portonius on the ground that he is the four-year-old horse,
  El Rey, imported from the Argentine."</p>

  <p>If a bombshell had fallen in the midst of that chattering, excited throng
  of people which filled the weighing-room, it could not have created a greater
  sensation.</p>

  <p>Over the babel of sound in the rings, a clear voice called:
  "Objection."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later all Epsom knew, as a board with that ominous word was
  hoisted on the number frame.</p>

  <p>Objection! what could be the objection? Toady Wilton, blanched and
  shaking, known to be in the confidence of Sir George, could only shake his
  head when he was asked the question.</p>

  <p>"There was no bumping," said Lord Chanderson, in wonder, to Eric Stanton.
  "It was a clean run race, so far as I could see, from end to end. What is the
  ground for the objection?"</p>

  <p>"I am as much in the dark as you are," said Eric. "It must be something
  pretty bad, otherwise Mr. President would be the last man in the world to
  object."</p>

  <p>Sir George Frodmere faced his accuser apparently unmoved and unshaken.</p>

  <p>"It is a most preposterous suggestion," he said easily, "and an iniquitous
  one; you may be sure that I shall seek redress in another place."</p>

  <p>The genial steward of the Jockey Club, nodded his head, gravely.</p>

  <p>"In the meantime, Sir George," he said dryly, "there is the accusation and
  there is the evidence of our veterinary surgeon that in his opinion, having
  made a casual examination of the horse outside, that he is a
  four-year-old."</p>

  <p>"Even that is no proof," said Sir George, calmly. "It is not enough that I
  should be under suspicion, you must have proof. What proof has this man got?
  I understand," he sneered, "that Mr. Milton Sands is the accredited agent of
  Mr. John President; a happy combination. The one is an ex-convict, the other
  an adventurer of a peculiarly unpleasant type."</p>

  <p>"I have all the proofs you want, Sir George," said Milton, unmoved by the
  outburst. "In the first place, I have the purser of the ship which brought El
  Rey to England. He will swear that this is the horse he landed, and will also
  swear that you offered him two hundred pounds a week to go to Moscow till the
  race was over. As a matter of fact," he smiled, "Mr. Delane was on his way to
  Moscow when I had the good fortune to persuade him to take another course,
  and to put your money in a bank so that he might not be in any way accused of
  acting in bad faith."</p>

  <p>"The stewards are hardly likely to take the word of a purser," said Sir
  George. He was fighting desperately for time. If he could only get this
  objection overridden, if he could only get a little breathing space, he might
  yet pull through.</p>

  <p>"If this is not Portonius," he said, "perhaps you will produce the real
  Portonius."</p>

  <p>"That I am very pleased to do," said Milton.</p>

  <p>He led the way to the unsaddling enclosure. As the horse had been led out
  to the paddock, another had taken its place, a young horse, sheeted from head
  to tail.</p>

  <p>"Here is the real Portonius," said Milton, quietly, and at a nod the
  attendant stripped the sheets and Sir George saw. There was no doubt of it,
  this was Portonius, a happier and a more healthy horse than when he had last
  seen him, thanks to the care which Milton Sands had lavished upon his
  "find."</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt about that?"</p>

  <p>It was the senior steward who spoke.</p>

  <p>"I remember this horse; he ran in the Brocklesbury Stakes last year, at
  Lincoln. He has a peculiar growth on the off hind leg. I remarked on it at
  the time, and I looked for it in the unsaddling place to­day, and thought it
  must have been removed."</p>

  <p>He walked round the horse. "This is Portonius," he repeated. "Now, Sir
  George?"</p>

  <p>Sir George shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I wash my hands of the matter," he said. "If you rob me of the race, I am
  not in a position to combat you. I can only promise you that if this
  objection is sustained, I shall take the matter to law." With no other word,
  he skulked through the narrow passage which led to the roadway outside.</p>

  <p>On the down, ten thousand race glasses were levelled at the notice-board
  which at that moment was being hoisted in the number frame.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; AN OLD SAYING</h2>

  <p class="first">"IT seems too wonderful," said Mary President.</p>

  <p>Her eyes were blazing with excitement. "And we have really won the
  Derby?"</p>

  <p>"You have really won the Derby," said Eric, smiling down into her face,
  tenderly. "I wonder if the winning of the Derby brings in its train any of
  the joy which I experienced when I found I had won you?"</p>

  <p>She pressed his arm gently, and through her tears, smiled bravely&mdash;it
  was an effort on her part to retain her self-possession at this wonderful
  moment.</p>

  <p>"I cannot understand how you discovered this fraud," said Eric, when some
  calm had been restored in the party.</p>

  <p>"I did not discover it, exactly," said Milton with unusual modesty. "I was
  put on the track by a newspaper paragraph which I found in an obscure South
  American paper. I went down to Tilbury and watched the disembarkation of the
  horse and guessed the rest. I followed Sir George and his friends, and thanks
  to my curiosity, I was enabled to watch the horse being stabled. It meant
  climbing on to a roof and performing I don't know how many acrobatic antics,"
  he smiled. "But I got there. I watched the stable the whole of the day. My
  only fear was that the real Portonius would be destroyed, but when at night I
  saw the unfortunate animal being led out by a half-drunken rascal, I guessed
  what the plan was. The rest was easy," his lips twitched at the recollection.
  "I regard Portonius as my own property, at any rate I must have the matter
  settled by the stewards of the Jockey Club. On a strict point of law, I think
  I should establish my claim&mdash;I rather think I should like to be a
  race-horse owner. Anyway, I shall base my claim upon the fact that I was
  under contract to hold the horse for so many minutes, the consideration
  being, I think, the price of a drink. The other contracting party having
  broken his part of the agreement, am I entitled to keep the horse?"</p>

  <p>"I think you have a chance of establishing your claim," laughed Eric.
  "However, it will not come into a court of law. What will happen to Sir
  George? He will be warned off, of course."</p>

  <p>Milton nodded.</p>

  <p>A telegraph boy stepped into the box at that moment with a message, and
  Milton's hand went out for it, automatically.</p>

  <p>"You are not expecting wires here, are you?" asked Eric in surprise.</p>

  <p>"I am expecting wires everywhere," said the other cheerfully.</p>

  <p>He tore open the brown envelope and read its contents.</p>

  <p>They seemed to afford him intense satisfaction, and he was smiling all
  over his face as he folded the form and put it in his waistcoat pocket.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me a moment."</p>

  <p>He went out of the box and made a hurried way to the telegraph office.</p>

  <p>Eric turned to the girl. "Milton is very full of himself, to-day," he
  said. Then&mdash;"Would you like to go home now?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, the excitement has not affected me in that way," she said.</p>

  <p>She put out her hand on to the ledge of the box and he held it.</p>

  <p>"I want to see the rest of the racing. I think I shall be sufficiently
  calm by the time the day is over. It has been a wonderful day for me," she
  said, softly.</p>

  <p>How wonderful, she was yet to know. How full that Derby day was of
  surprises, of nearly tragedies, of shattered ambitions and new-found hopes,
  was not revealed for some time.</p>

  <p>There came a knock at the door, and a uniformed messenger came in, cap in
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Miss Symonds," he said, looking inquiringly from one to the other.</p>

  <p>Janet jumped up.</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"You are wanted," said the attendant.</p>

  <p>The girl flushed. She had been rather hurt at Milton's neglect of her that
  day, though it was stupid to have any feeling in the matter, she told
  herself.</p>

  <p>But human beings, when they are in love, are not particularly logical, and
  she welcomed this little attention to her all the more, because she had been
  harbouring just the faintest resentment at Milton's neglect. She followed the
  man along the corridor and down the stairs into the crowded entrance of the
  grand stand.</p>

  <p>"Who wants me?" she asked, though she had no doubt in her own mind.</p>

  <p>"A gentleman, miss," said the man. "He told me particularly to bring you
  to him."</p>

  <p>He pushed a way through the crowd to a car drawn up at the kerb.</p>

  <p>The girl hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Where has he gone?" she asked, in surprise.</p>

  <p>"It is all right, miss," said the driver. He was flushed of face and
  looked as if he had been drinking, Janet thought. She did not recognise the
  adaptable Mr. Buncher who could train a Derby winner or, at a pinch, drive a
  car with equal facility.</p>

  <p>"He is waiting for you on the road."</p>

  <p>She got into the car quickly. It was not Milton's, so far as she knew. She
  had come to Epsom with John President's party and this might very well be
  Eric's, or one which Milton had hired for the day. At any rate, she had no
  time to ask questions or to feel any particular trepidation as the result of
  her little journey. Possibly Milton had chosen this more or less tactless way
  of making his escape from the party, and wanted her companionship on his road
  to town. Besides, what harm could befall her on these crowded downs? The car
  moved slowly along the congested road, crossed the course near the
  five-furlong post, skirted the South Eastern Railway Station and made for the
  open road across Banstead Downs. The machine was travelling at full speed,
  and after ten minutes she began to get alarmed and tapped on the window. But
  the chauffeur took no notice and did not so much as turn his head. She tapped
  again, but still the man ignored the signal. She lowered one of the windows
  and leaned out.</p>

  <p>"Where are you taking me?" she asked sharply. The man muttered something
  which she could not catch. She realised from his tone and his manner towards
  her that it was useless to ask. The girl was alarmed, yet she could not bring
  herself to believe that anybody harboured designs against her safety and
  well-being.</p>

  <p>There must be some mistake, or perhaps Milton had gone on some special
  business which needed her help and had sent a message for her to follow. The
  driver was just stupid or dense. She would compose herself, so she said, to
  await the outcome of the journey with patience. Yet there was within her a
  fear which amounted almost to panic. She knew that Milton Sands had enemies,
  she had guessed, rather than been told, that there was some plot on foot of a
  desperate character to rob John President. Men who were concerned in such
  villainies would be capable of any other. Her terror was renewed when the car
  made a turn and doubled back on its tracks, heading once more for London.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, Sir George Frodmere had made the best of his way to a car
  which stood waiting for him at the back of the cheap stands. He had no time
  to wait for Toady Wilton, and, indeed, gave him scarcely a thought. He was
  deeply concerned in his own deplorable position. This meant the end of things
  for him, a warning-off notice, as sure as the sun would rise in the east and
  set in the west....</p>

  <p>Ruin too, of a more material kind, for creditors were clamouring
  insistently.</p>

  <p>A man who had a very few expensive tastes, and an estate which cost less
  for its upkeep than most properties of its kind, it was remarkable that Sir
  George Frodmere, who "gave nothing away," in the phrase of the Turf, should
  find himself so heavily involved.</p>

  <p>He was a gambler who lost very little, since he was always playing for
  safety. He never made a friend who did not pay dividends, he had none of the
  expensive vices of his class, yet he was of that improvident nature which
  dissipates volume in line spray. He must find a way out, and at once. He had
  been dragged into the open, all his precautions, all his furtive scheming,
  had not availed him. He stood in the glare of publicity, a rogue, touching
  the utmost degrees of roguery; what else he did was unimportant. He heard his
  name called and turned. Milton Sands was walking quickly after him. Sir
  George stood, with unmoved face, watching the approach of the man who had
  ruined him.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he asked harshly.</p>

  <p>"I thought I would see you before you went. I have an item of news which
  will interest you," said Milton.</p>

  <p>"I am sufficiently interested in the items you have provided," drawled Sir
  George Frodmere, with a look of malignity in his eye.</p>

  <p>"But this is of particular interest," smiled the other, "both to yourself
  and to your friend Soltykoff."</p>

  <p>It was at that moment that Buncher passed, buttoning up his chauffeur's
  coat, and a significant look was exchanged between the two men. Sir George
  became suddenly affable.</p>

  <p>"Any item of interest which you can give me will be appreciated," he said.
  "Though I must warn you I have much to occupy my mind between here and
  London."</p>

  <p>"I will be as brief as possible," said Milton, "and all that I say is
  merely to urge upon you the important fact that you and your friend Soltykoff
  have to face an enormous disappointment. John President's formula has been
  found."</p>

  <p>"Found!" gasped the baronet incredulously.</p>

  <p>"The man who stole it," Milton went on, "has gracefully restored it and it
  is now in the possession of the Lyons Committee."</p>

  <p>"Who was the man?"</p>

  <p>"As to that, I cannot inform you," said the other, with a twinkle in his
  eye. "You yourself may have some suspicion, and if you have, let me tell you
  that your suspicion is justified. It is enough to say that the gentleman who
  extracted the formula and some twenty-thousand pounds in French banknotes
  from M. Soltykoff, has, in a moment of penitence, made tardy reparation."</p>

  <p>"Kitson?" said Sir George, quickly.</p>

  <p>Milton shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I can tell you no more," he said. "But you have learnt sufficient to be
  able to shock M. Soltykoff."</p>

  <p>Sir George interrupted him, and a slow smile dawned upon his face.</p>

  <p>"I always forget that you are a private detective," he said lightly. "Let
  me see, you are engaged in quite a number of important commissions, are you
  not?"</p>

  <p>"A few," said Milton, with extravagant modesty. "And that I have been
  fairly successful, you will agree. I have detected the greatest fraud in
  horse-racing that we have seen this decade. I have unravelled the mystery of
  the stolen formula, and there is only one piece of work which remains to be
  completed."</p>

  <p>"That piece of work being the discovery of Miss Stanton, as I gather,"
  smiled Sir George, and there was, obvious and apparent amusement in his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Milton saw the look and grew alert. In this hour of the baronet's
  humiliation, it needed something more than an ordinary cause to inspire his
  mordant humour, for the vicious joy in his eyes was plain to be seen.</p>

  <p>"I can only wish you luck in your last enterprise," he said, as he stepped
  into his car. "There is an old saying that the third time pays for all."</p>

  <p>"I don't quite follow you," said Milton.</p>

  <p>"You soon will in more senses than one," replied the baronet, and jerked
  his head in signal to the driver.</p>

  <p>Milton stood looking after the car in thought, then he shook his head
  slowly and made his way back to the box.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; KIDNAPPED!</h2>

  <p class="first">MILTON SANDS went slowly back to the box of his friends. He
  noted the absence of Janet and remarked upon it.</p>

  <p>Mary President smiled.</p>

  <p>"She will not get lost," she said. "There are quite a number of people
  from whom she can inquire the way back."</p>

  <p>She pulled her chair up to the edge of the box and looked down upon the
  course. The police were busily clearing it for the next race, but the
  excitement engendered by the disqualification of the Derby winner, had not
  died down. You detected it in a shriller buzz of talk from the crowd and the
  excited gesticulations of the men in the ring. It was responsible for an
  almost complete absence of wagering on the next event. Little tightly-wedged
  groups had formed in the various rings. They were in no mood for selling
  plate events, these racing men; there was too much to discuss for them to
  concentrate their attention upon the probability of a patched-up plater
  winning a five-furlong sprint. John President was absent too, he was in the
  paddock attending to his horse.</p>

  <p>"It is a great day for us," said Eric.</p>

  <p>"How great, I don't think you know," smiled Milton Sands.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps Janet is with grandfather," suggested Mary President suddenly.
  "She went out soon after he left."</p>

  <p>Milton nodded. He was not troubled about the absence of the girl. There
  came a timid knock at the door, and it opened slowly. Milton's eyebrows rose,
  for the man in the doorway was Mr. Toady Wilton, white and shaking.</p>

  <p>"May I come in?" he asked, humbly.</p>

  <p>Milton exchanged a swift glance with Eric Stanton.</p>

  <p>"Come in, please," he said coldly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wilton was conscious of the chilly atmosphere into which he had
  stepped, and wriggled uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"I feel that I ought to make an apology," he began, hesitatingly, and in
  such a flutter of agitation that the girl pitied him.</p>

  <p>"That is not exactly the end which I saw to to-day's happenings, but I ask
  you to believe me, Mr. Stanton, when I say that I knew nothing of this fraud.
  It has come as a great shock and a great surprise to me," he went on,
  eagerly. "And I do not know how I can face my friends after so terrible an
  occurrence."</p>

  <p>Eric said nothing. On Milton's face was a look of curiosity; he wondered
  how far this stout man would go to save his own neck, and he was to learn
  that Mr. Wilton had no intention of sacrificing himself if any confession
  might restore him in the good graces of his sometime patron.</p>

  <p>"It has been terrible," Mr. Wilton went on, mopping his brow with a silk
  handkerchief and shaking his head mournfully. "I do not know how I have lived
  through this afternoon. I never suspected Sir George of anything so&mdash;may
  I say villainous?" He cast a pathetic, pleading glance at Mary President.
  "But," he went on, "if I cannot undo the harm my&mdash;Sir George has done, I
  can at least prevent him doing a greater mischief."</p>

  <p>He licked his dry lips, and glanced from one face to another for some
  encouragement to proceed. From Eric, remembering the tragedy of his mothers
  life, he received none, but Milton's nod was an invitation which he accepted
  with some eagerness.</p>

  <p>"I had a talk with Buncher," Toady went on. He still stood in the doorway
  with his hands on the handle, as though ready to fly at the slightest
  explosion on the part of his outraged host. "And Buncher, thinking I was more
  in the confidence of Sir George than I am, has revealed the plot. I might
  even term it an infamous plot," again he glanced at Mary President's face,
  and there was a twinkle in the girl's eyes. She was genuinely amused at his
  change of attitude. She could not help contrasting it with the easy
  familiarity which he had displayed on that memorable afternoon at Sandown
  Park.</p>

  <p>"And what is this infamous plot?" asked Milton. He anticipated no more
  than a further elaboration of the El Rey swindle.</p>

  <p>Toady shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Of course I knew nothing about it, you under­stand."</p>

  <p>"I understand quite well," said Milton, blandly, "that you were a
  perfectly innocent agent."</p>

  <p>"Not even an agent," corrected the other, hastily. "I tell you I was in
  complete ignorance. Of course, Sir George has told me to-day that he is going
  to get married, but I did not suspect&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Married," said Milton, in surprise. "This is a new one on me; who is the
  lady?"</p>

  <p>Toady stammered and went red; again sought Eric's face with a pleading
  glance.</p>

  <p>"I have only an idea as to how Sir George dis­covered the identity of the
  lady, but his sister was apparently at the bottom of it all. She called at
  your office."</p>

  <p>"I wish you would tell a straightforward story," said Milton, impatiently.
  "I know Mrs. Gordon Thompson called at my office and talked a great deal of
  nonsense about the detective business to my friend, Miss Symonds."</p>

  <p>"And something else, I think," said Toady, gaining a little confidence.
  "She discussed with your secretary something about identifying marks, and
  your secretary told her about a certain snake she had around her ankle."</p>

  <p>Milton sprang up as if he had been shot.</p>

  <p>"Snake round her ankle," he gasped. "Tell me, tell me!" He grasped the
  other by the coat and almost shook him in his excitement. "Is that the girl
  he is going to marry?"</p>

  <p>Toady could only nod his head helplessly.</p>

  <p>"When is he going to marry her?" asked Milton, quickly.</p>"At once,"
  replied Toady. "A motor car... taking her away this afternoon...<br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">that is the plot."</span><br>

  <p>"What does it mean?" asked Eric Stanton quickly, looking at the white face
  of the other.</p>

  <p>"It means," said Milton, in a low voice, "that Janet Symonds is your
  sister, and if what this man says is true, she is now in the hands of Sir
  George Frodmere."</p>

  <p>In two strides he was through the door and striding along the corridor.
  There was no advantage in looking hereabouts for the girl, he ran along to
  the garage at the end of the grand stand building, found his own chauffeur
  standing at the gateway with a group of others, watching the animated scene
  which the crowded approach to the stands presented.</p>

  <p>"Get out the car, at once," said Milton, then&mdash;"Have you seen Miss
  Symonds?"</p>

  <p>The man nodded.</p>

  <p>"She went past here in a car, about ten minutes ago, sir."</p>

  <p>"Who was with her?"</p>

  <p>"She was by herself, as far as I could see," replied the man. "It was a
  closed car. I happened to be standing here and just caught a glimpse of her
  as she went away."</p>

  <p>A description of the car did not help him to trace the girl any further.
  Motor cars had been leaving and arriving by the hundred all day, but, where
  the road crosses the course, a police inspector was able to recall such a car
  as Milton was able to describe and confirmed the identification by a
  description of the chauffeur. Beyond this, however, no trace of the unwilling
  fugitive could be found, and Milton returned to the stand to find Eric
  waiting impatiently. He shook his head in answer to the young man's anxious
  inquiry. Toady Wilton still formed a member of the party, a semi-detached
  member, in the party though not of it.</p>

  <p>"You are the only man who can give me any information," said Milton,
  sharply. "I want to know all the places to which Sir George Frodmere is
  likely to take this lady."</p>

  <p>Slowly Toady Wilton recited a list of the baronet's haunts, and to each
  Milton shook his head.</p>

  <p>"There is only one place I can think of," said Toady, after he had
  exhausted the list, "and he is not likely to take her there."</p>

  <p>"Where is that?"</p>

  <p>"He has a houseboat on the Thames," said Toady. "A ramshackle affair, a
  few miles east of Reading, but, of course, that is absurd."</p>

  <p>"Exactly where is it?" asked Milton, quickly. Toady gave a brief
  topographical sketch of the houseboat's position.</p>

  <p>"But it is not the sort of place he would be likely to take her," he
  repeated. "I was there only a few weeks ago. The place has no furniture and
  is a leaky old tub of a thing that will sink at its moorings one of these
  days. Besides," he went on, "Mayton's&mdash;the furniture people, you
  know&mdash;wanted three hundred pounds to furnish it."</p>

  <p>"When did he ask Mayton's to do this?" demanded Milton.</p>

  <p>Toady shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I only saw their letter the day before yesterday." he said. "It may have
  been written a week ago, I did not notice the date."</p>

  <p>Milton thought, and to think was to act. His car carried him into Epsom
  town and to the post-office telephone. There was some difficulty in getting
  connected with London, on this busiest of days, but, after a fretful wait he
  was connected with the great furnishers. Yes, they had had an order from Sir
  George Frodmere to re-furnish this boat, and the work had been accomplished
  in record time.</p>

  <p>Milton hung up the receiver.</p>

  <p>"That is our objective," he said.</p>

  <p>Two hours' run brought them to Reading. They passed through the town as
  fast as the local regulations would allow them, and came to the solitary
  stretch of river where one unattractive house­boat rode at its solitary
  moorings.</p>

  <p>Eric leapt from the car, followed by Milton. They crossed the rough cart
  track which led to the house­boat. Here, however, a shock was in store. The
  houseboat was fully occupied. There were two or three girls on its upper deck
  and a stout man smoking a cigar standing on the bank with his hands in his
  trousers pockets, watched with curiosity the arrival of the party.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, in answer to the inquiry. "This is Sir George Frodmere's
  houseboat, but it has been hired by me for a month."</p>

  <p>Milton's heart sank.</p>

  <p>"I brought my family down to-day," said the man. He had a fine, rolling
  voice, a declamatory manner, and a trick of gesticulation.</p>

  <p>"I am looking for a young lady," said Milton, "a Miss Symonds."</p>

  <p>The man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"She is not on our boat," he said, courteously. "If you would care to go
  on board you are perfectly at liberty to do so."</p>

  <p>But Milton, sick at heart, knew such a quest was useless.</p>

  <p>"You are not expecting anybody?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nobody at all," said the man, politely.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to have troubled you," said Milton, and the two men made their
  way back across the field to the waiting car.</p>

  <p>"I somehow banked on finding her there," said Milton Sands, in a low
  voice. "It is not the reward I am seeking, because finding your sister means
  losing her."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked the other, quietly.</p>

  <p>"I think you understand," said Milton Sands, "that Janet and I were
  engaged, I cannot ask her to marry me, a penniless adventurer, a man guilty
  of most of the minor crimes, a gambler and a spend­thrift," he shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"But why shouldn't you ask her to marry you now? With all these
  disadvantages you had no hesitation in asking her before," said Eric Stanton,
  looking at him gravely.</p>

  <p>"Then she was a penniless girl, now she is a rich woman," said Milton.
  "That is quite sufficient, so far as I am concerned, I cannot ask her or ask
  you to make such a sacrifice."</p>

  <p>"You are talking great nonsense," said Eric Stanton with a smile. "When
  you find my sister, and if she is still willing to marry you, there is no
  reason in the world why you should not."</p>

  <p>He held out his hand, and Milton grasped it in silence.</p>

  <p>"We will get some dinner at Reading," he said, after awhile, as they were
  entering the outskirts of the town. "Starvation will not help us."</p>

  <p>They found an hotel and had a needed meal. Telegraph and telephone brought
  them in touch with the world. Scotland Yard had received instructions, and
  had issued orders, but no sign of the missing car had been reported.
  Detectives had been despatched to Pennwaring to watch the place and every
  known rendezvous of Sir George Frodmere had been carefully picketed.</p>

  <p>"We had better stay here for the night," said Milton. "It is central
  enough, and all Frodmere's interests are in the West of England."</p>

  <p>Eric agreed; they might as well stay here as go back to town.</p>

  <p>Whilst they were discussing their plans, a scene of considerable interest
  was being enacted on the houseboat. The guests were all assembled in the big
  saloon. There were two present whom Milton had not seen. Had he caught a
  glimpse of Bud Kitson's square jaws or the peaked, sharp face of Mrs. Bud
  Kitson, a light might have dawned upon him, and the significance of the
  carefully-posed group he had seen.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21"></a>XXI. &mdash; A MIDNIGHT MARRIAGE</h2>

  <p class="first">EAST of Reading is an uninteresting stretch of river, and by
  the low-lying meadows, inundated whenever the river rose above its normal
  height, the grimy old houseboat had not left its moorings within living
  memory, for the very good reason, so local tradition had it, that any attempt
  to move her would result in disaster and wreck.</p>

  <p>It had originally been the property of two maiden ladies of Putney who
  found therein seclusion and relief from the hustle which the motor-bus and
  electric tramway had introduced to that once sedate suburb, and when, after
  the curious custom of maiden-lady sisters, they had died within a fortnight
  of one another, the property had come into the market, Sir George Frodmere
  had purchased the houseboat and the strip of field adjoining the river for a
  song, hoping to turn over his purchase at a profit. But the busy weeks and
  the events which had preceded the Derby had prevented him from devoting
  attention to his crazy purchase, and the boat swayed deserted and tenantless
  on the recurring tides until four days before the Derby was decided, when
  there had arrived a pantechnicon laden with furniture and a squad of men from
  a London decorator, and these had worked feverishly to make the old houseboat
  as homelike and as habitable as possible. The final touches were directed by
  a man who spoke with a strong American accent and a sharp-featured woman who
  accompanied him.</p>

  <p>The houseboat was approached by a cart-track across the fields, which
  joined a little-frequented branch road. It was with some trepidation that
  Janet Symonds felt the car bumping over this uneven roadway. She had got
  beyond any illusion as to her position. She was a prisoner; Buncher had made
  it plain enough when he had stopped to replenish his petrol on a lonely part
  of the Bath Road.</p>

  <p>"You have got to keep quiet and make no disturbance, do you see?" he said,
  threateningly. "I have been ordered to take you to Mr. Milton Sands. If you
  don't believe that you have got to disbelieve it, but I ain't going to have
  any trouble with you."</p>

  <p>At the journey's end, as he half pulled her out of the car, the girl
  stepped back as she caught sight of the uninviting houseboat and the dull
  silver of the river, but Bud Kitson was at hand and a no less persuasive Mrs.
  Bud Kitson, who had little patience and a sharp tongue.</p>

  <p>The room in which Janet found herself was the lounge of the houseboat, a
  spacious apartment, lighted by electricity&mdash;the renovations had even
  included the restoring of an ancient battery&mdash;and furnished
  comfortably.</p>

  <p>"Where is Mr. Sands?" she asked.</p>

  <p>She held tight to that one illusion for her reason's sake.</p>

  <p>"You will have to wait a bit before you see him," answered the man,
  roughly. "I guess there is a lot of us who want to see Mr. Milton Sands. I
  for one." He tapped his chest and leant across the table, his huge jaw stuck
  out menacingly. "He put me in jail, did you know that, kid? Into Portland
  Prison, and I was there for three days before they found out the low trick he
  played upon me. I want to see Mr. Sands all right, but I guess that will have
  to wait."</p>

  <p>"Who has brought me here?" asked the girl, faintly.</p>

  <p>"You have come here for a good reason, and if you are a good girl you will
  go away again just as you have come," the woman broke in. "There is a
  gentleman who is very much in love with you, though why he should worry
  himself about poor trash of a typist I don't know," she added contemptuously.
  "You had better see your room," she went on, and led the way along a narrow
  alley­way to another cabin half the size of the saloon, furnished in
  readiness for the girl's reception.</p>

  <p>It struck her there, as it had occurred to her in the sitting room, that
  the place had been newly furnished, but she could find no fault, either with
  the completeness of the arrangements for her reception, or with the quality
  of the furniture supplied. As she stepped into the room the door closed
  behind her, and she heard the click of the key turned in the lock.</p>

  <p>The one window of the cabin faced the bank. Between her and liberty was a
  stretch of dark water. So much she discovered from a hasty reconnaissance.
  She might attract the attention of such passers-by as happened along, but she
  knew instinctively she could only take that desperate course at her peril.
  She could but wait patiently for developments to learn the extent of her
  danger. It was near to midnight when she heard the sound of a car being
  driven over the rough road, and heard men speaking in low tones. She saw the
  dark form of a man cross the strip of gangway plank from the shore to the
  boat, and almost immediately following that a knock came at her door and the
  voice of a woman asked if she was awake. She was not only awake but dressed,
  and following a moment of hesitation, she stepped through the open door and
  followed her wardress, for such she was, along the alley-way to the big
  saloon.</p>

  <p>She recognised the man who stood at one end of the long table, although
  she had only seen him once before in her life. But there was no mistaking Sir
  George Frodmere, with his colouring and the droop of his carefully brushed
  moustache, the monocle in his eye and the peculiar freshness of his
  complexion. He bowed gravely to her as she entered, and at a nod from him the
  other two occupants of the room made a discreet exit.</p>

  <p>"Why have I been brought here?"</p>

  <p>Her voice was calm and level, and betrayed nothing of her fear.</p>

  <p>He looked at her thoughtfully. She was much more beautiful than he had
  expected.</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady," he began in his suave voice. "I regret the necessity
  for bringing you here at all, but you are young," he smiled, "and possibly
  romantic, and you will understand my somewhat peculiar situation when I tell
  you all the facts of the case, and, understanding, you will, perhaps, not
  only sympathise with but help me."</p>

  <p>She was silent; she could gain nothing by breaking in upon his narrative,
  and she was content to wait until he had exposed his hand. After that....</p>

  <p>"Won't you sit down?" he invited her.</p>

  <p>"I prefer to stand."</p>

  <p>"Which means that I am to stand also," he smiled easily. "Still, I do not
  mind, I have been sitting for a long time. You probably know me."</p>

  <p>"You are Sir George Frodmere," she said, and he nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is my name. You probably know some­thing of my family history?" He
  looked at her keenly, but she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I do not know anything about you, Sir George," she replied.</p>

  <p>She was temporising, to secure what advantage she could from this
  interview. That she was terribly frightened she even admitted to herself; she
  was in a position of the gravest danger, she could not doubt that fact.</p>

  <p>"You may not be aware," said Sir George, "that I am the heir to a very
  large sum of money, to half a million, to be exact," he went on carelessly,
  "and that my inheritance is contingent upon my being married at a certain
  age. Hitherto," he shrugged his shoulders, "I have felt no desire to
  embarrass myself with a wife. That sounds ungallant," he smiled, "but I think
  you will understand what I mean."</p>

  <p>She nodded. She knew enough of Sir George's private character to realise
  what an embarrassment a wife might be.</p>

  <p>"The day after to-morrow," Sir George went on, "I shall be thirty-eight.
  On my thirty-eighth birthday I must be a married man. I have suddenly
  awakened to this important crisis in my affairs, to find myself quite
  unprepared for the situation. It was only yesterday that my lawyer reminded
  me of the imperative necessity for an early marriage. And so," he spoke
  slowly and deliberately, "faced with the urgent and painful position, I must
  make a hasty choice, but, as I believe, a happy choice, for I have chosen
  you."</p>

  <p>"Me?" she gasped in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"You," he repeated gravely, nodding his head. "You, because I have learnt
  something of the hard times you have had, and because you have all the
  qualities which are particularly attractive to me." She laughed, genuinely
  amused.</p>

  <p>"But this is absurd, Sir George," she said. "I could not possibly marry
  you under any circumstances."</p>

  <p>"I think you underrate the possibilities of life," he replied easily.
  "Frankly, I want a wife whom I can leave at the church door."</p>

  <p>He was searching her face all the time, on the look­out for some sign of
  doubt or hesitation, but, so far, the signs were not encouraging.</p>

  <p>"A wife I can leave at the church door," he repeated with emphasis. "To
  that wife I am prepared to hand, as a marriage portion, the sum of a hundred
  thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"But," said the girl, frowning in wonder, "there are hundreds of girls who
  would jump at your offer, Sir George, hundreds of girls who have
  not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He saw the flush come into her face and die away again, and gathered that
  she had hastily suppressed the confession of her love for Milton Sands at
  that moment.</p>

  <p>"There are hundreds of girls," he repeated, "but not the girl I want, and
  women whom I could not trust. In you, I have found one who possesses all the
  qualities which I require, and," he shrugged his shoulders, "I repeat, you
  would have perfect liberty to leave me at the church door with a cheque for a
  hundred thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>She looked at him steadily.</p>

  <p>"You seem to forget, Sir George," she said, quietly, "that for some months
  I have been working with Mr. Milton Sands, in his office."</p>

  <p>"I do not see how that affects me," said Sir George.</p>

  <p>"It affects you to this extent," she replied, in the same level tone,
  "that Mr. Sands, in the exercise of his new profession, and with the object
  of educating me that I might be of greater assistance to him, has given me a
  very comprehensive outlook upon the criminal world. He has taught me," she
  went on, still in the same quiet tone, "to meet every artifice which the
  confidence trickster employs. I do not think your story differs very
  materially from any I have heard."</p>

  <p>A dull red came into the baronet's cheeks. The words cut him like a
  whip.</p>

  <p>"You don't believe me, Miss Symonds?"</p>

  <p>"Frankly, I don't," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Will you believe this "? he said, his voice hardening. "That you are
  going to marry me within two days, and that I have obtained a special licence
  with that object."</p>

  <p>"I would find that very difficult indeed to believe," she replied, her
  breath coming faster.</p>

  <p>"You are relying upon Milton Sands to save you from the necessity," he
  went on, with a little smile. "I don't think I should place too much reliance
  upon that quarter. You can do much for yourself, for me, and for your
  friends. I assure you that your marriage to me will be of tremendous
  financial advantage to Mr. Sands."</p>

  <p>"I do not think we need discuss that any further," said the girl, with
  quiet dignity. "You cannot marry a woman against her will."</p>

  <p>With that she turned and walked back to her cabin, and Sir George made no
  further attempt to speak to her. An hour later, Mrs. Kitson tapped at the
  door and came in with a tray containing a delicious supper.</p>

  <p>"You can eat this without any fear," she said.</p>

  <p>The girl had refused all offers of refreshment since she had left Epsom,
  and was feeling famished, and the smell of the viands was very enticing.
  There was, in addition to an excellent supper, tastily served, a small
  porcelain jug of chocolate&mdash;an excellent vehicle for the administration
  of certain preparations of morphia....</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It seemed to her that she had sunk into a heavy, dreamless
  sleep, yet troubled with strange, indefinable discomforts which finally took
  shape in a bright light before her eyes. She put her hand up to veil off the
  offending glare and was conscious that something was upon her finger which
  had not been there before, then she came to her senses swiftly, and sat
  staring at the shining gold ring upon the third finger of her hand. She
  looked round, dazed and shaken. She was in the saloon, the centre of a silent
  group. The baronet was there eyeing her strangely, Kitson and his wife were
  unmoved spectators to her distress, but it was the fourth man whose presence
  brought her to her feet, her hands at her throat, and her eyes staring. A man
  of medium height, sparsely framed and white of hair, it was his garb which
  sent a sickening sense of horror to her heart. He was a clergyman.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;what?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you feeling well, Lady Frodmere?" asked the man.</p>

  <p>"Lady Frodmere," she repeated dully.</p>

  <p>"Lady Frodmere," said Sir George, "you are now my wife."</p>

  <p>"But I have not married you."</p>

  <p>The clergyman smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid, young lady, you are a little upset," he said. "I have
  married you to Sir George Frodmere with your full consent."</p>

  <p>"It is impossible, impossible," she cried. "You could not have done this.
  I did not answer, I was unwilling. I did not want&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The clergyman shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You answered every question I put to you, young lady," he said. "I do
  not, as a rule, officiate or take part in midnight weddings, but I can assure
  you that you are Lady Frodmere."</p>

  <p>The girl fell back in the chair, shaking in every limb.</p>

  <p>It was a horrible thought. What had they done to her that she could act
  so? Every sense told her that the thing was as impossible as it was
  monstrous, but here was the clergyman, and here, spread upon the table was a
  slip of paper which she could see was a marriage certificate. She sprang up
  and caught the paper in her hand; yes, as far as she could see, it was
  regular, even her own shaky signature appeared in the proper place. She was
  dumbfounded and crushed by the knowledge. With a cry she turned and fled
  along the alley-way to her room, slammed the door behind her, and, with
  frantic haste, piled every article of furniture which she could find against
  the door.</p>

  <p>"I think that is all," said Sir George.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to put me up for the night?" asked the clergyman.</p>

  <p>"You would be well advised to clear out, Pent­ridge," said Sir George.
  "There are all sorts of people looking for you."</p>

  <p>The pseudo-clergyman slipped his coat off and ripped away the collar.</p>

  <p>"I hate these cursed things," he said. "They cut my neck. Did I do it
  well?" he chuckled.</p>

  <p>"You did splendidly," said Sir George Frodmere, patting him on the back.
  "You have just the right ecclesiastical note. Really, there was a great actor
  lost in you, Penty. Did you bring the money?"</p>

  <p>"I brought it," said Pentridge, reluctantly. "Two thousand pounds is a lot
  to hand over to a fellow broke to the world like you are."</p>

  <p>"Only for a day or two, Mr. Pentridge," smiled Sir George genially, as he
  took the notes from the other's hand, folded them and stuffed them into his
  inside pocket. "We will soon prove that Sands is a liar and then I shall be
  rolling in money."</p>

  <p>"I hope you will," said Pentridge. "And even if you don't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In that case," nodded Sir George, "I have a fortune there," and he
  pointed to the alley-way. "You are going to be well paid for the trouble you
  have taken; by the way, that formula of yours has been found."</p>

  <p>Pentridge looked up quickly.</p>

  <p>"Has he given it up?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Who?" asked Sir George in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Milton Sands, of course," said the other. "Didn't you know he had it?
  Why, you are not half a fly chap."</p>

  <p>"Milton Sands," repeated Sir George, incredulously.</p>

  <p>"That is it! " Bud Kitson brought his huge fist on to the table with a
  thud. "That was the guy that had it! Why, I can see it as clear as daylight.
  He was on the train the night it was lost; came back from Monte Carlo broke
  to the world. Toady Wilton saw him leaving the Casino and spoke to him. He
  gets back to London and is suddenly flush of money, opens a detective office
  in Regent Street&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But why should he open a detective office in Regent Street?" interrupted
  Sir George.</p>

  <p>"The only possible way he could get the rewards," said the other, "without
  arousing the suspicions of everybody and getting himself into trouble. It's
  as clear as mud."</p>

  <p>Sir George bit his finger nails.</p>

  <p>"So that was it," he nodded. "There is a chance of getting even with
  Milton Sands, but I think I am even enough with him to-night," he added, with
  a little laugh.</p>

  <p>"But I'm not," replied Kitson, savagely. "You don't know what I felt like
  those three days in that damned jail of yours. I didn't know there was such a
  hell in the world as that."</p>

  <p>Sir George looked at him with a speculative eye. The man's face was
  distorted with rage&mdash;he might serve his purpose, this Kitson, before Sir
  George rid himself finally of one who might easily prove an incubus.</p>

  <p>"Now, Pentridge, you can go off to the town," he said, "and disappear in
  the morning. There is no chance of that girl escaping through the
  window?"</p>

  <p>"Nil," said Bud Kitson, laconically. "I put a couple of iron bars up
  before she arrived&mdash;on the off chance."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Sir George, nodding approvingly.</p>

  <p>He waited till Pentridge had gone before he unfolded his plans.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>XXII. &mdash; WHEN ROGUES FALL OUT</h2>

  <p class="first">"YOU are getting rattled," said Eric.</p>

  <p>He looked across the table to the big Australian who sat staring into
  vacancy, one finger curled round his cigar to the utter destruction of that
  fragile vehicle of comfort.</p>

  <p>"I am," said the other quickly. "I have never felt like this in my
  life."</p>

  <p>"Come into the town," urged Eric, rising. "There is a fair on of some
  sort."</p>

  <p>They made their way to the thronged fair ground, and pushed slowly through
  the crowd, resisting the enticement of shooting-gallery and coconut-shy,
  adamantine against the wiles of earnest showmen, and came to a halt before
  the raised platform which fronted Hallik's "Royal Theatre." It was the home
  of a travelling theatrical company which touched the lowest depths of
  theatrical art, and presented, so a great painted bill announced, the "Murder
  of Maria Martin in the Red Ram."</p>

  <p>The actors and actresses concerned in the presentation of the play, had so
  overcome the modest shrinking which prevents the average actor and actress
  from appearing in public in their theatrical garb, to display themselves in
  their costumes and their make-up on the platform outside.</p>

  <p>"I seem to know that man," said Eric, suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Which man?" Milton looked up.</p>

  <p>"The man there with the red wig," and he pointed to a stout actor, who, in
  stentorian tones, invited the youth of Reading to the dramatic feast.</p>

  <p>"I have seen that girl somewhere, too," said Milton. He indicated a
  heavily rouged. Maria, the heroine of the drama, who was seated on an up
  turned box, chatting with a ferocious policeman.</p>

  <p>"It is curious how one imagines one has seen people before," said Milton,
  as they moved on. "It is an experience which I suppose we have all had, and
  the curious fact is, that the recognition of men who are quite unknown to you
  is usually mutual, and that they also find in us some resemblance to a
  friend."</p>

  <p>They completed the fair ground and found it a noisy and a boring
  experience, and were making their way out when suddenly Milton stopped.</p>

  <p>"Let us go back to that booth."</p>

  <p>"To which booth?" asked Eric in surprise.</p>

  <p>"To the theatrical booth," said the other, vapidly.</p>

  <p>He elbowed his way through the crowd, followed by Eric.</p>

  <p>The play was in course of presentation, and the platform outside was
  deserted. They mounted the rickety steps, paid their money at the door, and
  descended another set of stairs into the sawdust-strewn body of the theatre.
  The place was half filled, and they were able to make their way to the
  reserved seats in front. The first act was nearly over, and Milton scribbled
  a note and sent it, by an attendant, to the dressing-room behind. A message
  came back to the effect that the man he sought would see him after the
  performance.</p>

  <p>"I have an idea," said Milton. "But I am not sure that I am right. It is
  probably one of those fantastic illusions one has, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Eric shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you are getting at," he said.</p>

  <p>He was to learn.</p>

  <p>It was nearly twelve o'clock and the fair ground was deserted, when a man
  came out of the little tent which the actors used as a dressing-room, and
  confronted Milton Sands.</p>

  <p>They looked at each other for a moment and the man went red in the light
  of the one naphtha flame which had been left to guide the stall-holders and
  the showmen to the exit.</p>

  <p>"I think I have seen you before," said Milton quietly.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you have," said the other man, with a note of defiance.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, I am sure. I would like you to come along with me to my hotel, I
  have a few questions to ask you."</p>

  <p>"I shall do nothing of the sort," said the man.</p>

  <p>"In that case," said Milton, airily, "I shall invoke the aid of the law
  and have you arrested."</p>

  <p>"You cannot do anything to me," said the other, loudly.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to do anything to you except to pay you well for any
  information you can give me," said Milton, with a smile. "And if you are a
  wise man, you will come straight away to the hotel."</p>

  <p>Evidently the actor was a wise man, for he followed obediently.</p>

  <p>They found a cab, and in ten minutes they sat, a curious party, in the
  sitting room which Eric had hired.</p>

  <p>"Now, sir," said Milton, as he closed the door, "Will you explain to me
  how you came to be on a certain houseboat this afternoon, and will you
  further explain to me what induced you to say that you had hired that
  houseboat?"</p>

  <p>"I shall refuse to give you any information at all," said the man,
  doggedly.</p>

  <p>Milton took a pocket-book from his pocket, and, removing five crisp notes,
  laid them on the table.</p>

  <p>"Each of these," he said, carefully, "is for ten pounds. If your
  information is of any help to me, those notes are yours."</p>

  <p>The barnstormer eyed the money hungrily.</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose I had better tell you," he grumbled. "After all, there
  was no harm in what we did&mdash;it was only a sort of an engagement."</p>

  <p>"From whom, Sir George Frodmere?"</p>

  <p>The man looked surprised.</p>

  <p>"I don't know who Sir George Frodmere is," he said, "unless he was the
  gentleman who hired the boat. No, we were engaged this afternoon by another
  gentleman on board&mdash;Mr. Kitson."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Bud Kitson, was it?" nodded Milton.</p>

  <p>The other grinned.</p>

  <p>"I don't know that that is his front name, but Kitson is his other," said
  the man. "He told me that there was a young actress who was always being run
  after by a couple of young men and that she wanted to come down here to have
  a peaceful time. She knew that if it got out that she owned this house­boat,
  that she would be pestered by people, and so she wanted me and a few of my
  colleagues to pretend they were a respectable family party and put the young
  men off the scent if they came. We were getting ten pounds a day for the
  job," he went on, "and we had to go on board every morning at nine o'clock,
  and stay until the evening."</p>

  <p>"I see the idea&mdash;an admirable one," said Milton, gaily. "Here is your
  fifty pounds, sir, I will not bother you any more."</p>

  <p>He went into his room, opened a small attaché case which he always carried
  in his car, and took out an automatic pistol; examined it carefully, clicked
  the magazine into the box and slipped the pistol into his pocket. Then he
  came back to Eric.</p>

  <p>"I think we will go along and inspect that house­boat," he said, grimly.
  "And as Bud Kitson is one of the crew, it may be very necessary to take a few
  elementary precautions."</p>

  <p>There was some little delay whilst the car was being got ready, and the
  clocks were striking one as they left the town behind and sped along the
  river to their destination.</p>

  <p>"Here we are," said Milton.</p>

  <p>He recognised the two white posts which marked the roadway across the
  field. He got out, and the two men passed rapidly along the rough roadway to
  the river. It was a dark night with a fine rain falling, but there was no
  difficulty in following the road.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," said Eric, suddenly, "that we are on the wrong
  path."</p>

  <p>"Why, by Jove!" said Milton, and gasped.</p>

  <p>The houseboat was no longer there.</p>

  <p>They found the mooring-post, and with the aid of a pocket lamp, they saw
  footmarks where the gang­way plank had been. The houseboat itself had
  vanished, as though the prophesied catastrophe had occurred and she had gone
  down, leaving no trace of her existence.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"What time is it?" Sir George asked.</p>

  <p>"Half-past twelve," said Kitson.</p>

  <p>"The tug ought to be here now."</p>

  <p>"The tug?" said the other in surprise.</p>

  <p>Sir George nodded.</p>

  <p>"These people will be hot on our track. I gambled on Toady Wilton telling
  them about the houseboat. The actors have served their purpose, but I want a
  little more time, so I chartered a tug from Millwall, to tow us down the
  river. I know a nice, secluded backwater in which we may hide for a few
  weeks, and a few weeks will be quite long enough for my purpose," he said,
  moodily.</p>

  <p>"Will she stand the strain of a towing?" asked the other, dubiously. "She
  is a rickety old tub."</p>

  <p>Sir George smiled.</p>

  <p>"They can lash alongside, she will stand that," he said. "I have given
  instructions to cast off when we reach the vicinity of the hiding-place. We
  shall have to row into the backwater as best we can."</p>

  <p>He switched out the lights of the saloon and opened one of the windows
  overlooking the river.</p>

  <p>"There she is!" he said.</p>

  <p>In mid-stream was the black hulk of a little tug, her red and green lights
  gleaming brightly.</p>

  <p>"Signal her alongside," said Sir George.</p>

  <p>Less than a quarter of an hour later, the mooring-ropes were cast off, the
  tug made fast to the side of the houseboat and drifted slowly out into
  mid­stream, and the descent of the river had been commenced.</p>

  <p>"The backwater is on Lord Chanderson's estate," explained Sir George.
  "Chanderson is leaving for the Continent to-night, I heard him tell a man in
  the ring, to-day, and nobody uses the little stream which runs through his
  estate, and ends in a small lake. With any luck, we ought to be safe for at
  least three weeks. Is the boat provisioned?"</p>

  <p>Kitson nodded.</p>

  <p>"What about the lady?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Sir George smiled.</p>

  <p>"In three weeks, much can happen," he said, stroking his moustache. "In
  three weeks, even the most obdurate young lady may change her mind. I am in a
  pretty tight hole, Kitson. I suppose that it is not a unique position for you
  to be in?"&bull;</p>

  <p>"I guess not," said the other, coolly. "I have been in a few with jail at
  the end of them. That guy gave you two thousand pounds," he said abruptly. "I
  suppose I stand in for a share."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said the baronet, smoothly. "We share out when this matter is
  over. Don't imagine that you will suffer through your loyalty to me. I have
  plenty of money," he said cheerfully. "As you know, I have an estate worth an
  enormous sum."</p>

  <p>"I know all about that," said Kitson, "and I know it is mortgaged for an
  enormous sum. I guess your total assets are in your wallet, at this
  particular moment, and I would feel kind of good if some of those assets were
  in mine."</p>

  <p>"We will discuss this in a day or two," said the baronet with an air of
  finality, as though to dismiss the subject.</p>

  <p>"I guess we had better discuss it now," drawled Bud Kitson. "It has not
  been a profitable partner­ship for me, Sir George. There has been too much
  'going to' about it. Right now I want something on account."</p>

  <p>They stood now on the upper deck, looking at the black river, as the tug
  made its slow way along its twisting course.</p>

  <p>"No," he said thoughtfully. "Our partnership has not been so good, and the
  thousand you are giving me on account will not compensate me any."</p>

  <p>Sir George laughed.</p>

  <p>"A thousand on account," he said. "My dear, good man, you are mad. I want
  every penny of that two thousand. I tell you you shall have your share when
  the thing is through."</p>

  <p>"And I tell you," said Bud Kitson, with no less emphasis because his voice
  was low, "that I want a half right now."</p>

  <p>The baronet turned and faced him in the half­darkness. "You will have
  nothing now," he said. "You must wait your turn."</p>

  <p>"I guess my turn has come," persisted Bud Kitson. The baronet turned with
  a snarl, and something cold and hard pressed against the American's
  waistcoat, and his hands went up automatically.</p>

  <p>"Your turn must come when I am ready for it," grated Sir George. "If you
  are not with me, you are against me. You don't suppose I am going to give it
  to you now."</p>

  <p>"Suppose I go ashore and tell the police?" asked the calm Mr. Kitson.</p>

  <p>"And suppose you do," mocked the baronet. "What use will that be to you?
  You have been in Portland once. Do you want to go again? Because if you do, I
  can put you there."</p>

  <p>"I guess not," said the other, quickly.</p>

  <p>"You keep guessing," said the baronet, with a rough laugh. "I have your
  record at my finger-tips. There was a man killed in Monte Carlo, this year,"
  he went on. "And one who stood by and saw it done and never raised a hand to
  save the unfortunate devil. Since that time, he has been drawing blood money
  from the murderer. Black­mailer is an elegant phrase for such a man as you.
  They might jail you for accessory to a murder, Bud Kitson."</p>

  <p>"I think you know too much," said Bud Kitson, slowly.</p>

  <p>If his words were slow, his actions were not. One hand descended quickly
  upon the pistol held at his waist and wrenched it from the other's grasp. It
  fell with a clang upon the deck.</p>

  <p>"Let go," gasped Sir George, but the other's huge hand was at his throat.
  They struggled across the broad deck of the houseboat, and suddenly the
  baronet went limply to the ground, the other man astraddle. Presently the
  struggles of the baronet ceased, and Bud Kitson thrust his hand into the
  inside pockets of his victim's coat and found what he wanted. He carefully
  buttoned it in his pistol pocket, then, without an effort, lifted the limp
  man over the rails, and grasping him by the collar, dropped him into the
  water. He stood a moment by the rail, peering down into the black river, but
  there was no sign of Sir George. He walked swiftly across the deck and hailed
  the tug skipper.</p>

  <p>"Cast off," he said, roughly.</p>

  <p>He heard the clang of the engine as the telegraph signalled the tug to
  stop. The captain came down from his little bridge to the bulwarks of the
  tug.</p>

  <p>"What is wrong?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Cast off," repeated Bud Kitson.</p>

  <p>"I can't leave you in mid-stream," said the other, in wonder.</p>

  <p>"Push her up against the bank, and leave her," commanded Kitson.</p>

  <p>"Where is the other gentleman?" asked the captain.</p>

  <p>"Gone to lie down."</p>

  <p>The skipper hesitated.</p>

  <p>"And what about my haulage?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Kitson drew a note from his pocket, and, leaning down, placed it in the
  skipper's extended hand.</p>

  <p>"That covers it, I reckon," he said.</p>

  <p>The tug captain looked at the note in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"You will want some change out of this?"</p>

  <p>"You can keep the change," said the other. "Push me over to the bank and
  clear."</p>

  <p>Before the tug stood off, and whilst the <i>River Fay</i> was grounding
  gently on the sloping bank, the captain asked, dubiously, for further
  information.</p>

  <p>"I can make fast here all right," said Bud's voice, in the darkness.</p>

  <p>He waited half an hour until the tug's lights had disappeared round the
  bend of the river. So far, all was well. Though he had not moored her, the
  clumsy houseboat had come to rest upon a mud bank which kept her in the place
  where she had been left. Kitson went below. His wife was lying on the couch
  in the saloon. He woke her,</p>

  <p>"Sir George has fallen overboard," he said, simply.</p>

  <p>She looked up, and their eyes met in one understanding exchange of
  glances.</p>

  <p>"Get ready to quit this place," said Kitson, "we can cross the fields to
  the road and take our chance."</p>

  <p>"What about the girl?" asked the woman,</p>

  <p>"She can wait," said the man with a laugh. "This misunderstanding is
  providential for her."</p>

  <p>He had few preparations to make, He changed the light shoes he was wearing
  for a pair of heavier ones. Then he made a careful search of the baronet's
  little cabin and found the search profitable, for there was a fairly large
  sum of cash in one of the bags Sir George had brought aboard.</p>

  <p>His wife was ready long before he was, and he came back to the saloon to
  find her waiting impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I had better call the girl?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Call nothing," he replied shortly. "We have no time now for doing those
  silly things. You have got yourself to consider."</p>

  <p>"What happened to him?" she jerked her head towards the deck.</p>

  <p>"Ask no questions," was the reply.</p>

  <p>He led the way to the after part of the boat. In a casual survey from the
  upper deck he had noticed that the stern was nearer the bank and was within
  springing distance, but now a surprise was in store for him. Between the
  shore and the boat there was a dozen yards of water.</p>

  <p>"She has drifted," he said, with a curse, and ran to the top deck to get a
  better view.</p>

  <p>The houseboat was making slowly for mid-stream. Possibly there was a
  fractional rise of the tide which had released her from her secure resting
  place, but certain it was that she was now drifting slowly up-stream,
  broadside on. There was a dinghy attached to the houseboat, and into this,
  after some preliminary manoeuvring to bring the boat within reach, Bud Kitson
  dropped, assisting his wife to descend. He slipped the painter, and getting
  out the pair of oars which were in the boat, he pulled with long, strong
  strokes to the shore.</p>

  <p>"I guess this is a better way after all," he said. "It gives us a chance
  of getting away. They will find her in the morning and she cannot come to
  much harm, anyway."</p>

  <p>In this, however, he was wrong.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; CONCLUSION</h2>

  <p class="first">JANET SYMONDS woke from a fitful sleep with a sense that all
  was not well. She had lain down on her bed determined to keep awake, but the
  exciting events of the day and the fatigue of her joumey no less than the
  after-effects of the drug she had taken, all combined to assist nature in its
  munificent course, and she fell into a fitful sleep.</p>

  <p>She was awakened by a peculiar movement of the boat; it seemed that it was
  not at the same angle at which it had been when she lay down. She looked
  through her little barred window and saw that the boat was in mid-stream, and
  that the uncomfortable position in which she lay was due to the fact that the
  houseboat had a decided list. Very quickly she threw aside her pitiful
  barricade and opened the door. She sped along the passage, expecting to meet
  one or other of her custodians, but there was nobody in sight though the lamp
  still burnt in the saloon. She found it difficult to walk, so decided was the
  list, but succeeded in mounting to the upper deck. The plight of the <i>River
  Fay</i> was plain to be seen. The unaccustomed strain which towing had put
  upon her had started some planks, and the old pleasure boat was slowly
  sinking. There was no sign of Sir George or the man with the square jaw, and
  she ran below again and called aloud, but received no answer.</p>

  <p>They had left her, she thought, to die. She remembered having seen a small
  dinghy fastened to the stern of the houseboat, but this, too, had gone, and
  she pulled in nothing more than a slack rope. Very slowly, with groanings and
  creakings, the boat was settling down in the water. There was no life-buoy
  that she could find; the wooden seats which might support her were quite
  beyond her strength to lift. Then far up the stream she saw a gleaming light
  which grew brighter with every instant. She heard the throb of a motor launch
  and screamed.</p>

  <p>Eric Stanton, sitting in the bow of the boat, heard the cry, and saw the
  black hulk of the houseboat ahead. He shouted an order back and the engineer
  stopped the little engines just in time, as with a twist of his wheel Milton
  brought the launch alongside the sinking houseboat.</p>

  <p>Without a moment's hesitation he leapt aboard, and as his foot touched the
  deck, with a gurgle of water and a final despairing squeak of her rotten
  timber, the boat sank in a swirling eddy of water. But Milton had the girl in
  his strong arms; and though the water thundered about her ears, and she felt
  herself sinking, the grasp about her waist did not relax, and after what
  seemed an eternity she was up again, drawing in the sweet night air with a
  gasping breath.</p>

  <p>They lifted the two over the side of the launch.</p>

  <p>"She has fainted," said Eric. He took off his coat and wrapped it about
  the girl, looking tenderly upon the face which the light of the lamp
  revealed. Dawn broke brightly, and the faint grey light revealed to the girl
  her safety and succour. She woke with a confused memory to find Mary
  President sitting by her bed, a book upon her knees. She smiled faintly, and
  fell again into a sleep. When she awoke Mary President was still there, but
  in place of her book, the table by her side and the floor in her vicinity was
  strewn with newspapers,</p>

  <p>"How do you feel now?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I think I feel much better," said Janet, and sat up, though her head
  swam.</p>

  <p>"Do you feel well enough to see all the pictures oi Down Under Donovan
  winning the Derby?" asked Mary President gaily.</p>

  <p>"The Derby? " said the girl,in a puzzled tone.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you have not forgotten yesterday?" Janet shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Was it only yesterday?" she asked in wonder. "It seems a hundred years
  ago."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">M. Soltykoff, a buoyant soul, read the story of Sir George
  Frodmere's death and the arrest of Bud Kitson and his wife (they were taken
  in the early hours of the morning, near Reading), in his favourite Paris
  journal.</p>

  <p><i>"Eh bien!"</i> said M. Soltykoff sadly, and made a rough calculation of
  his losses on the snowy table-cloth of the Grand Café.</p>

  <p>He was in a philosophical mood, for that morning he had received from his
  Moscow agent intelligence to the effect that the heavily insured vessel in
  his ownership had sunk in the Black Sea.</p>
