<h2>Sir Penn Carlyll's Engagement<br>
<br>
by<br>
<br>
L. T. Meade and Robert Eustace</h2>

<h3>First published in Pearson's Magazine, December 1902</h3>

<h3>The third of the Sensational Experiences of Diana Marburg, the Oracle
of Maddox Street; Related by Herself.</h3>

<hr>

<p>SIR PENN CARYLL'S engagement was the talk of all his friends. He
was a man of about forty, of good family, fairly rich, and boasting
of two nice country seats. He also kept a racing stable and added
thereby considerably to his income. Sir Penn was so good looking,
so cheery and gay of heart, that he was a great favourite, and more
than one eager mother thought of him as an excellent husband for
her daughter, and more than one pretty girl looked at him with eyes
of favour.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Sir Penn had proved himself impervious to the
charms of all fair women, until a certain day when a bright-eyed,
Tasmanian girl, who went by the name of Esther Haldane, brought him
to her feet. The girl in question was only nineteen, was to all
appearances poor, and seemed to have no relations in London, except
a brother, who was considered by those who knew best to be a
somewhat questionable possession. Karl Haldane was a man without
apparent profession, and with no certain income, and there was
little doubt that he and his sister lived, before the engagement,
more or less as adventurers.</p>

<p>After Sir Penn declared his attachment to Miss Haldane, however,
he placed his country seat in Sussex at her disposal, putting her
under the charge of his aunt, a certain Mrs. Percival, and going
there himself at intervals. The wedding was to take place early in
July. Sir Penn received the congratulations of his friends, and
Miss Haldane was thought one of the luckiest girls of the day.</p>

<p>The time was the fourth of May. I was dining alone and was
somewhat surprised when Sir Penn's card was brought to me with a
request scribbled in writing that I would see him without a
moment's delay. I hurried at once into his presence. His face was
as a rule remarkable for its serenity, and I was startled when I
observed the change in it.</p>

<p>"I fear you are not well," I said. "I hope there is nothing
wrong."</p>

<p>"I am afraid there is," he replied. "May I tell you the object
of my visit?"</p>

<p>I asked him to seat himself, and prepared to listen with
attention.</p>

<p>"I have decided to ask you to help me," he said abruptly. "An
ordinary detective would be worse than useless. I have been brought
into contact lately with the most extraordinary and uncanny
phenomenon, and unless matters are put right without delay, I shall
find myself in a serious financial difficulty. You may be certain I
would not say these things to you without grave reason, and I must
ask for the utmost secrecy on your part."</p>

<p>"Of course," I replied.</p>

<p>He bent forward and looked at me keenly.</p>

<p>"Have you ever, in all your experience of occult matters, come
across a case of thought-reading in which you were satisfied that
imposture was absolutely excluded, and that the thoughts of one
person were really conveyed to the brain of another? Do such things
exist in this world of reality?"</p>

<p>I paused before replying.</p>

<p>"You ask me a strange question, Sir Penn, and if you want my
true opinion I do think such things possible."</p>

<p>"You think so? Who, then, can be safe? Now listen to my own
personal experience. You know, of course, that I am the owner of a
number of racehorses. Horse-racing is an expensive game, and my
expenses are principally met by successful speculation on my
horses. Now, of course, there are many secrets in a stable, such as
which is the best horse for a certain race, or the capacity of any
other horse. These things have to be kept from the outside world.
The most important of all our secrets are obtained by what we call
'trials.'</p>

<p>"I will briefly explain. We have, say, half-a-dozen horses, and
we wish to know which is the best for a certain distance. The
horses are led out and mounted, and the trial gallop takes place.
Now the horse that wins the race may not by any means be the best
of the half-dozen horses that we wish to prove, for if such were
the case anyone watching the trial would at once know our secret.
So to keep the matter dark the various saddles are weighted with
different weights, giving heavier loads for some horses to carry
than others. In this manner we can not only calculate which is the
best horse, but can keep the information from outsiders. For a
slightly weighted bad horse will beat a heavily weighted good
one.</p>

<p>"No one but the trainer and myself know what weights are applied
to the saddles, and the whole thing is done just at the last moment
before the horses start. After the trial only my trainer and myself
know which is the best horse. We then discuss what we will do and
which horse I shall support in the betting market. Is that clear to
you?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," I replied.</p>

<p>"You doubtless also comprehend that if these matters were known
to an outsider, he could profit immensely by backing my best horse,
and could prevent me getting my money on at a good price."</p>

<p>"I understand."</p>

<p>"Then pray listen. For some time I have been certain that
secrets with regard to the weights in the saddles have eked out, to
my own immense loss and to the great gain of someone else. On
looking carefully into the matter, I find that the bookmakers in
London, through whom the fiend who is trying to ruin me must
execute his commissions, have information with regard to the horses
almost immediately after the trial takes place at Lewes.</p>

<p>"Now I will tell you of the last case. A trial took place of my
horses on the twentieth of April on the Downs at eleven o'clock in
the morning. On that occasion even my trainer did not know the
weights that they carried. In order to make things quite safe I
kept the knowledge altogether to myself. The people who witnessed
the race were my aunt, Mrs. Percival, Miss Esther Haldane, the
young lady to whom I have the honour of being engaged, I myself and
my trainer. My bay horse Victor won the trial, though he was not
first by any means in the race. We four talked the matter over on
the Downs; we then walked home quietly all together. On reaching
home at twelve o'clock I wired to my agent in cipher to invest
heavily on Victor, whose price was twenty to one.</p>

<p>"That same afternoon I received the astounding information that
he was first favourite at three to one, a large commission already
having been executed. Now this commission was executed at
Tattersall's, in London, at half-past eleven, actually within
half-an-hour after the trial was known, and also half-an-hour
before any of us reached home from the Downs. The thing is
astounding, for even if anyone did secretly watch the trial it
would be impossible, without knowing the weights, to tell which was
the best horse. That knowledge was only known to us four, and to no
one else in the world. You have, therefore, this fact to face.
<i>&gt;A certain piece of information is known to four people on an
open Down in Sussex at ten minutes past eleven, and yet that
information is acted on in London twenty minutes later.</i> There
is no question of my trainer playing me false, as he could not
possibly communicate the information in the time I have mentioned,
and I have come to the conclusion that some extraordinary
thought-transference is the only thing to fall back upon."</p>

<p>I was silent for a moment, then I said suddenly:</p>

<p>"Do you happen to remember, Sir Penn, if the sun was shining on
that last occasion?"</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked, in some surprise.</p>

<p>"Because there would be just the possibility of your trainer
heliographing the information."</p>

<p>"That is a clever suggestion," he exclaimed, "but it won't do.
It happened to be a cloudy day."</p>

<p>"Then for the moment I see no solution," I replied. "May I ask
if you know anyone who has ever threatened to read your
thoughts?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I do. Karl Haldane, my future wife's brother, who
calls himself a clairvoyant. To be plain with you, Miss Marburg, I
have no particular fancy for Mr. Karl Haldane; but there is no
doubt he is extremely clever, and Esther is devotedly attached to
him. He certainly would be the last man who would try to ruin me.
We must try to get at the solution in some other way."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, may I ask you a question or two?" I said. "Was
Mr. Haldane at your house when the affair you have just mentioned
took place?"</p>

<p>"No, he had been staying with us, but he left early that
morning."</p>

<p>"I should like to see him," I said, after a pause.</p>

<p>Sir Penn's eyes brightened.</p>

<p>"You are wrong in suspecting for a moment that Haldane has
anything to do with the matter," he said. "Nevertheless if you like
to meet him, you can: I am particularly anxious to introduce you to
Esther. I have a big party down at Lewes just now. A trial of my
horses for the Derby takes place early next week. Will you come to
my place and be present at the trial? Can you do so?"</p>

<p>"Of course I will come. I would throw over any engagement for
such an important, and I must say, to me, interesting case."</p>

<p>"Will you come to-morrow? I will meet you by the four o'clock
train."</p>

<p>I promised to do so, and after thanking me warmly Sir Penn took
his leave. Truly a queer case had now been put into my hands. Sir
Penn was regarded amongst all his friends as a practical man;
nevertheless, in his difficulties he consulted me, the occultist
and believer in thought reading. One thing certainly was evident,
either what had happened was a genuine case of thought
transference, or a very subtle form of fraud. The latter seemed
truly to be impossible.</p>

<p>When I reached Lewes the next day Sir Penn was waiting for me.
On arriving at Court Prospect, the name of his beautiful house, I
found a large party assembled in the hall. Mrs. Percival, Sir
Penn's aunt, was present, and was dispensing tea. I had met her
before, and she came forward now and greeted me kindly.</p>

<p>"It is very good of you to come. Miss Marburg," she said, "and I
have delighted more than one person present by saying I am sure you
will give a <i>séance</i> while you are with us. Oh! of course I
quite believe in palmistry, and Mr. Haldane, one of the best
clairvoyants I have ever known, will arrive this evening. We shall
doubtless have a most interesting time. Have you yet met Mr.
Haldane?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then I shall have the pleasure of introducing two kindred
spirits. Ah! Esther, my dear, come here."</p>

<p>A slim, remarkably graceful girl rose from her seat at a little
distance. She strolled leisurely towards us. I am tall, but Miss
Haldane was half a head taller. Mrs. Percival made the necessary
introduction. Miss Haldane looked at me slowly. All her movements
were slow. She then opened her magnificent eyes a trifle wider than
their wont and held out her hand.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you," she said in a cordial tone.</p>

<p>She did not utter another word, but went back to her seat. I
stood silent where she had left me. I no longer wondered at Sir
Penn's infatuation. It was not the beauty of the girl that so
impressed me; she was beautiful, for all her features were good;
but from a strict standpoint there were prettier girls in the room.
No, Miss Haldane's beauty lay in the extraordinary and almost
wicked magnetism of her eyes. Those eyes knew too much. I did not
think they looked good--they saw too deeply beneath the surface.
Even I, callous to most things of that sort, felt my heart beat
uncomfortably fast after Miss Haldane's extraordinary and
penetrating glance.</p>

<p>"You look tired, Miss Marburg," said Mrs. Percival. "Won't you
have some tea?"</p>

<p>She handed me a cup which I took mechanically. I was still
thinking of Miss Haldane and her eyes. I felt quite sure that no
one could see her without thinking of her eyes alone, the rest of
her beautifully moulded face, graceful pose and slim young figure
being all forgotten in the effect that the eyes produced.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room just before dinner I was introduced to Miss
Haldane's brother. To my astonishment he was in every respect her
opposite. He was a fair haired, stoutly built, ugly man. He was not
only ugly but his expression was absolutely unpleasant.
Nevertheless, he too had his charms. When he spoke you forgot the
ugly features, the sunken eyes, the leer round the mouth. His voice
was good, nay, beautiful. His intellect was undoubtedly powerful,
and he had a sympathising manner which appealed more or less to all
those to whom he spoke. He happened to be my neighbour at dinner on
that first evening, and before the meal came to an end I had
arrived at the conclusion that he was a most remarkable and most
interesting man.</p>

<p>On the next day several of the guests took their departure, and
Esther Haldane and I found ourselves alone. We went for a walk
together on the Downs and afterwards sat in the cosy boudoir where
she made tea for me.</p>

<p>"You must allow me to congatulate you," I said suddenly. "You
are a very lucky girl."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Need you ask? You have won the affections of Sir Penn Caryll.
You are about to marry him. I have known him since I was a child.
You are in luck, Miss Haldane. You are going to marry a good
man."</p>

<p>She fixed her eyes on me, the pupils dilating until they looked
black; then very slowly the lovely eyes filled with tears. She
dropped on her knees beside me.</p>

<p>"You are a clairvoyante," she said; "so, for that matter, is
Karl. I am afraid of Karl, and very little would make me afraid of
you. Will you look at my hand?"</p>

<p>She held it out as she spoke. I examined it attentively. I saw,
to my regret, many bad points. The Mount of Mercury was sunken, the
heart-line was chained, and Jupiter was remarkable for his absence.
All these things proclaimed this girl, according to my creed, to be
unscrupulous, even cruel. She did not look cruel, and I had no
reason up to the present to doubt her honour. Nevertheless, I
dropped her hand with a sigh. It was quite an unusual one for a
girl to possess.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" she asked. "Am I so very bad?"</p>

<p>"I have seen more promising hands," I answered.</p>

<p>"Tell me what you see?"</p>

<p>"Do you really wish to know?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Forewarned is forearmed," I said, after a moment's pause. "Your
circumstances are happy. Miss Haldane, and there is no reason why
you should not lead a good and honourable life to the end of the
chapter. Nevertheless, your hand points to a certain
unscrupulousness in your character. For instance, I should not care
to submit you to a very great money temptation."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are horrible!" she cried. Her face grew very white.
"You frighten me; you talk nonsense, and yet, and yet it is
nonsense that Karl believes in."</p>

<p>She began to rub the offending palm.</p>

<p>"I am going to my room," she said. "Your words have worried
me."</p>

<p>Her manner was somewhat that of a spoilt child. I smiled to
myself, but an unaccountable weight of suspicion and dread was
hanging over me. Why should I believe anything evil of a beautiful
girl like Esther Haldane? What object could she have in injuring
the man whom she was about to marry? I felt ashamed of my own
suspicions; nevertheless they would not quite go away.</p>

<p>On the next day the trial of Sir Penn's horses would take place,
and on that evening just when dinner was coming to an end, Miss
Haldane raised her voice and called across to her brother, who was
sitting at the other end of the table.</p>

<p>"Karl," she cried, "Sir Penn has been asking if you will not
give us a <i>séance</i> this evening. You have been very
disagreeable not to do so before. You will oblige, I think I may
say, <i>all</i> the company. Will you not consent on this
occasion?"</p>

<p>The ladies bowed and smiled, and the men bent forward to watch
what Haldane would do. I thought, or was I mistaken? that he gave
his sister a sudden glance of understanding. Then he said with that
slow sort of drawl which now and then characterised him:</p>

<p>"I shall have much pleasure in doing what the company wish."</p>

<p>Sir Penn expressed his satisfaction, and there was a chorus of
approval from one and all.</p>

<p>When we met in the drawing-room Haldane came to the front.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "I have been asked to give
to-night a demonstration of thought transference. This I am willing
to do on a condition. I want you all to be absolutely satisfied
that there is no deception. I will therefore leave the room in
company with someone now present, who shall remain with me until I
return.</p>

<p>"While I am away, a certain sentence employing intelligible
words shall be decided upon by two persons in the room. All the
company may know the sentence if they so will, but it is essential
that two should do so in order that there may be a witness that my
interpretation of the said sentence is correct. The two persons who
know the sentence will stand with their backs towards me at one end
of the room; I will stand with my back towards them at the other.
And if those two people faithfully think of that sentence, and of
that sentence alone, I promise to read their thoughts and to sav
what it is. Do you all consider that fair?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Sir Penn, "and I will bet you ten pounds,
Haldane, that you fail."</p>

<p>"Done, Sir Penn," was the answer.</p>

<p>A discussion as to who should be the person to accompany Mr.
Haldane outside the room, and to choose the sentence within the
room, immediately ensued.</p>

<p>"In view of my wager, ladies and gentlemen," cried Sir Penn, "I
think I may claim the right to be one of those to choose the
sentence. As to my partner, I will leave the choice to
yourselves."</p>

<p>I could see by Sir Penn's manner that he was determined to clear
up the terrible suspicion that was haunting him.</p>

<p>"I will be yiur partner, if I may," said Miss Haldane, and she
went up to Sir Penn, and laid her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>He seemed to hesitate for a minute; then he looked into her
eyes, and said softly:</p>

<p>"As you wish."</p>

<p>Sir Penn then turned to me.</p>

<p>"Miss Marburg," he said, "may I ask you to accompany Mr. Haldane
from the room?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure," I replied. I felt interested and excited, and
was determined that no trickery should be played if I could prevent
it.</p>

<p>Karl Haldane and I repaired to the library, and in exactly ten
minutes' time returned to the drawing-room. There was a dead
silence. Sir Penn and Miss Haldane stood at the further end of the
room. Karl Haldane at once took up his position, with his back
towards them. Being, as it were, in the position of umpire, I
determined to watch the experiment with the utmost vigilance, and
accordingly I crossed the room to where Sir Penn and Miss Haldane
were standing. I stood near them and took care to watch them both.
They were absolutely still. Miss Haldane's hands were locked in
front of her, her features were as quiet as though she were sitting
for her photograph; her face was whiter than usual, and her strange
eyes had a staring look. I thought the expression of the eyes
unnatural--she looked as though she were about to cry.</p>

<p>Fully five minutes passed, and then Mr. Haldane called out in a
clear, musical voice--</p>

<p>"I have received the impression. Judge, please, if I am correct.
I presume I must thank Sir Penn for this copybook sentence. It is
as follows:--</p>

<p>"'<i>If you are using your powers for fraudulent purposes,
beware!</i>'</p>

<p>"Am I right, Sir Penn?"</p>

<p>The Baronet's reply was to come forward, open his pocket-book
and hand the clairvoyant a bank-note for ten pounds. There was
quite a sensation in the room.</p>

<p>Later that same evening Sir Penn found an opportunity of seeing
me alone.</p>

<p>"What do you think of this affair?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you what I think of it at present," was my
answer. "I am certain there is an explanatory cause, although what
it is I cannot say. Let me think over everything most carefully.
Mr. Haldane leaves to-morrow, does he not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank goodness, by an early train. I don't like the man
and I cannot pretend that I do. I wish with all my heart he were
not Esther's brother. But let us turn to something more important.
To-morrow the trial of my horses takes place. I propose that you
and Mrs. Percival and Miss Haldane and myself go to see it. I have
a colt named Fritz, who is in for the Derby, and I think I know
what he can do. If the trial goes as I expect, Fritz will be the
winner. The result of to-morrow's trial must be kept absolutely a
secret until I can operate in the market. If I find that the
information again gets out--well, I shall cease to keep
racehorses."</p>

<p>"I will do mv very best for you, Sir Penn," I answered.</p>

<p>When he had left me I went to my room--there I sat down and
prepared to think out the enigma. Hour after hour went by, and my
busy brain felt on fire. Each moment I became more and more certain
that some fraud was being worked by Mr. Haldane, but he could
scarcely manage this without an accomplice, and terrible as the
idea was, if there really was foul play, his sister must stand in
that position towards him. Her hand betrayed her. What her motive
was it was impossible to tell, but her hand made crime a
contingency not too remote to contemplate.</p>

<p>As I thought and thought I became certain that if only I could
discover the key to that evening's performance, I should have also
the key to the entire position. I recalled the scene vividly. Miss
Haldane's curious and rigid attitude; the peculiar expression in
her eyes. I thought of all the ordinary methods of
communication--hand language--lip language. Both were out of the
question. Yet the means must have been very sure in order to
communicate the exact wording of the sentence.</p>

<p>Through what channel of the senses could it have passed? Was
there any movement? I fixed my memory again, centring my whole
thoughts upon it. The eyes! Esther Haldane's eyes had always struck
me as wonderful--nay. more, as odd. They looked very odd as I gazed
at them while the clairvoyant at the other end of the room was
thinking out the sentence. She had blinked several times, too, as
if about to cry.</p>

<p>I arose from my chair. A strange idea had struck me. I lit my
candle and went down through the silent house. I entered the
drawing-room. When I got there I quickly examined the exact places
where Haldane and his sister had stood. From the place where Miss
Haldane stood her eyes by means of a big mirror could be seen by
Haldane. As I thought over this fact the dim outline of a terrible
plot began to reveal itself. The human eyes are always naturally
winking. Only a code, such as the Morse Telegraphic Code, was
necessary. A long closing of the lids for a dash, a short one for a
dot, and any communication was possible and could not be detected
by the closest observer.</p>

<p>I left the drawing-room, and crossing over to the library took
down a volume of the "Encyclopaedia Britannica," and carefully
copied the letter signs of the Morse Telegraphic Code. I then
returned to my room.</p>

<p>During breakfast I watched Miss Haldane, and as I did so the
simplicity of the wicked scheme, evidently evolved both by her
brother and herself, was borne in upon me. She looked particularly
handsome this morning, but also nervous and anxious.</p>

<p>The guests who were still staying in the house took their
departure after breakfast, amongst those to leave being Karl
Haldane. I saw him go up to his sister and kiss her. As he was
leaving the room she turned very white, so white that I wondered if
she were going to faint.</p>

<p>"Are you ill?" I said. "Does it trouble you so much to part from
your brother?"</p>

<p>"We are very much attached," she said, her lips quivering.</p>

<p>"I have remarked that," I answered.</p>

<p>She flashed an excited glance at me.</p>

<p>"Who would not be?" she continued. "Has he not fascinated you?
There is no woman who comes in contact with him who does not love
him."</p>

<p>At that instant Sir Penn came into the room. He went up to her,
and laid his hand affectionately on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"We are due on the Downs at eleven," he said. "Miss Marburg is
coming with us."</p>

<p>"Are you?" asked Miss Haldane.</p>

<p>The information certainly gave her no pleasure.</p>

<p>"I should like to see the horses," was my answer.</p>

<p>Nothing more was said. Mrs. Percival came into the room, the
conversation became general, and at about a quarter to eleven we
four started for our walk. It was a glorious morning, sunny and
warm. Nevertheless, our conversation flagged, and we walked on for
some time in silence.</p>

<p>At length we reached the racing ground, and Sir Penn showed us a
good position to witness the trial, in which some dozen horses were
to take part. Mr. Martin, the trainer, and our four selves took up
our position at the intended winning post on a little rise amongst
some furze bushes. Sir Penn drew out his watch.</p>

<p>"It is exactly mid-day," he said.</p>

<p>"Here they come!" cried Miss Haldane excitedly, and in a few
moments, with a thunder of hoofs, the animals galloped past.</p>

<p>"Just what I thought, Martin," said the baronet. "If Fritz
doesn't bring home the Blue Riband this year he is certain to be in
the first three."</p>

<p>"And if he is, you will be richer than ever," said Miss Haldane,
laying her hand on his arm. "Do go, Miss Marburg, to look at the
probable winner of the Derby. Take Miss Marburg to see Fritz, won't
you, Penn?"</p>

<p>Sir Penn and the trainer moved up to where the horses were being
pulled up. As Sir Penn did so he turned to me.</p>

<p>"Will you come?" he asked. "Won't you come too, Esther?"</p>

<p>"No,"' she replied. "I am feeling tired. I will stay with Mrs.
Percival."</p>

<p>"Do, my dear," said the elder lady. "We will both sit down on
this knoll of grass and wait for you, Penn, and for Miss
Marburg."</p>

<p>I slowly followed Sir Penn, but when I had gone a few steps, I
turned aside and pretended to be plucking some small flowers that
grew on the edge of the common. My heart was beating almost to
suffocation. I feared that Miss Haldane would observe me, and that
I should lose a possible opportunity. But she had evidently
forgotten my existence. Mrs. Percival had opened a newspaper and
was beginning to read. Sir Penn and the trainer were more than a
hundred yards away. I stood on her left. She rose slowly to her
feet and gazed out steadily across the Down in the direction of an
old ruined barn some six hundred yards off. I quickly took out
pencil and paper and, keeping my eyes fixed on hers, marked the
movement of the long and short closure of her lids. That slip of
paper I have still, and this is the copy as I took it down:</p>

<p>F R I T Z W O N T R I A L</p>

<p>Without a moment's pause or giving myself time to think I rushed
up to her side.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" I cried.</p>

<p>My voice startled her. She flashed round, fury in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Fritz won trial," I said, as I deciphered the dots and dashes
from the code.</p>

<p>She stared wildly at me for one moment, then suddenly falling on
her knees she burst into a passion of tears. At this insiant Sir
Penn came up.</p>

<p>"Esther!" he cried. "Miss Marburg, whatever is the matter?"</p>

<p>I turned to him.</p>

<p>"This is the matter," I answered. "The plot is discovered. Send
a couple of stable lads to prevent anyone from leaving that barn,
and bring whoever is there here at once."</p>

<p>In a moment the word was given, and Sir Penn turned to Miss
Haldane. She still knelt on the grass, her face covered, the tears
flowing between her fingers. Sir Penn's face turned white as death.
I saw that he guessed the worst. The girl to whom he was engaged,
and whom he loved with all his heart, had betrayed him. Nothing
else greatly mattered at that moment.</p>

<p>"Look!" I cried.</p>

<p>Two boys on their horses had just headed off the figure of a man
who was running with all his might towards the railway station. It
was, I could see at a glance, Mr. Karl Haldane. A moment later he
was brought to the spot where we stood. His face was also white,
but very hard and determined-looking.</p>

<p>"Come, Esther, old girl," he said, speaking in an almost rough
tone, and pulling the weeping girl to her feet. "You did your best.
We must all fail at times. I presume," he added, "that Esther and I
have failed, but will you explain why you sent two men to interfere
with my liberty, Sir Penn?"</p>

<p>"I think I can best explain," was my answer.</p>

<p>I then proceeded, in the presence of Esther and Karl Haldane, to
give step by step the means I had taken to discover their secret.
When I had finished speaking there was silence. After a pause,
which was the most impressive I ever endured, Esther Haldane
approached Sir Penn.</p>

<p>"You can, of course, arrest both me and my husband," she
said.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" he exclaimed. "Your husband?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Karl Haldane is my husband. I have played you the meanest
trick a woman can play a man. I tried first to win your love,
secondly to win your money. I succeeded in the first. I failed in
the latter. All that I have done I have done for my husband, the
only man on God's earth whom I really love. I love him so well that
I can even go under for him. You can take what steps you please to
punish us both. Come, Karl, our game is up."</p>
