<h2><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>THE SLIP COACH MYSTERY: A
RAILWAY ADVENTURE</h2>
<p>If it were possible to write the secret history of a European
Ambassador what a revelation would stand before the eyes of the
astonished public! We read our newspapers and form our opinions on
great international questions from their pages, or from speeches in
the House of Commons, while all the time those "behind the scenes"
are smiling to themselves at the very small amount of knowledge
which the press and public are really permitted to obtain; or else,
while the people are flattering themselves over the prospect of a
"peaceful political outlook," as contained in the "leaders" of the
daily paper, those in whose hands the "outlook" is really placed
are trembling with anxiety lest some piece of delicate diplomacy
should fall through. Nor is the public aware of the plots and
counterplots which take place among a class of men chosen
especially for their diplomatic faculties, and often pitted against
one another in a warfare that demands more brains than the most
skilful military leader in Europe.</p>
<p>The incident I am about to narrate forms a small part of the
secret annals of the diplomatic service, though at the same time
soother equally secret element entered into the plot.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that in 189- there were rumours going the
rounds of the press concerning friction between some of the great
Powers of Europe, nor were there wanting those who prophesied "wars
and rumours of wars." The centre of the agitation was that great
field of international trouble and dispute vaguely known unto us as
"The East." Some fresh troubles had arisen in the "Eastern
Question," owing to the unexpected attitude of one of the smaller
Powers, which appeared to be setting her more powerful neighbours
at defiance, and encouraging them to quarrel among themselves. The
Prime Minister was harassed on every side. Questions were asked in
the House, but cleverly evaded, and the foreign policy of this
country seemed for a few weeks to be wrapped up in sphinx-like
mystery, until suddenly the crisis was at an end, the stocks rose
merrily, and the public once more breathed freely. But it is little
known that a far different result might have been the case; and
therefore the incident about to be chronicled will be of all the
more interest. One stipulation must be made, and that for obvious
reasons. The names of those who took part in the adventure must not
be disclosed, for it was from one of these that the facts of the
case will be set down. There is no fear of his discovery, and I
have permission to publish his story, which runs as follows.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>It was during a prolonged stay in the East of Europe that I
first became aware of the existence of a secret society which has
its members spread through many countries, and which I will refer
to under its Anglicised name of "The Watching Brotherhood." Why and
how I became a member myself matters little in the incident I am
about to narrate. Perhaps I was young and foolish, and fired with
false ideas of "Liberty." Perhaps it was because, being a
cosmopolitan, I had few patriotic instincts, and was the more ready
to devote myself to the cause which "The Watchers" professed to
have in hand. On my return to England I found a little handful of
the "brothers" in London. Perhaps it will be better understood when
I say that most of these were of Russian extraction, and probably
exercise more influence even in this country than might be
supposed. Among the few who constituted our branch of the society
the most important was a man whom we will call Koravitch, a fine
muscular fellow of English descent by his mother&mdash;a man who
would stick at nothing, and the narration of whose exploits would
form a volume in itself. Koravitch was our chairman, and one
evening, when we met at his summons in a quiet house not a hundred
miles from Tottenham Court-road, he came into the room with a more
serious expression than I had ever seen him wear.</p>
<p>"Comrades," he said, an soon its he had taken his seat, "we have
serious business before as to-night, and before long some of us may
be called upon to act."</p>
<p>"What is it?" we asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>"The peace or the war of Europe, perhaps," he answered. "Great
things are being weighed in the balance. But listen while I read
you this message from B&mdash;"</p>
<p>B&mdash; was one of the heads of the society, and a word from
him meant much. We anxiously listened while Koravitch read the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>"To our brothers, greeting! The time has come and the great
opportunity has arisen. The Powers of Europe are looking one
another in the face in anger and in terror. Irresolution
characterises three Governments, and peace is threatened with
destruction. Let there be war! Let the nations fight, for then
shall follow the rising for Freedom."</p>
<p>The explanation was this: If Europe could be involved in an
Eastern war it was determined to light the torch of a great
revolution in Russia and other countries in sympathy with such a
movement. How far such a rising would be successful it is difficult
to judge, but "desperate men use desperate means to attain their
ends."</p>
<p>"Now," went on Koravitch, "there is something more. I have a
most important matter to put before you. Two of the Powers are
bringing pressure to bear on the British Cabinet to induce England
to act with them independently of Russia. If they are successful
the chances for war will be increased tenfold. So grave has this
political outlook been considered at St. Petersburg&mdash;for,
somehow or other, the affair has leaked out&mdash;that it has been
determined to send an Extraordinary Embassy from the Tsar's
Government, armed with a treaty of a private nature, by the signing
of which England will agree to act with Russia, in agreement with
certain proposals the latter Power intends to make&mdash;the end of
which will be peace. So important does the Tsar consider the
question that this embassy is being kept a dead secret, and even
the Russian Ambassador in this country is unaware of it."</p>
<p>"Is this true?" asked one of the "brothers."</p>
<p>"Did you ever know me to lie?" asked Koravitch, sternly. "Of
course it is true. Our society has its agents everywhere&mdash;and
evens the Tsar's palace is not free from them."</p>
<p>"And who is the Ambassador chosen?"</p>
<p>"Sklavotski," said the chairman.</p>
<p>"What! Sklavotski?" we echoed.</p>
<p>"Ay&mdash;none other. A pretty good handful to cope with,
eh?"</p>
<p>For the name carried terror with it. Sklavotski had been one of
the cleverest secret police agents in Russia. Then he was appointed
to diplomatic service of a dangerous character, and it was commonly
reported that no one had ever got the better of him.</p>
<p>"Yes," continued our chairman, "it is none other. And now comes
the point that concerns us. It is ordered that every possible delay
be placed in the way of his journey here. Right across the
Continent our agents are at work, and no pains have been spared.
Even a railway accident has been planned on one of the lines on
which he has to travel. But one thing has been strictly ordered,
and that is that his life is not to be attempted. The question
stands thus: His interview with the British Prime Minister must be
prevented until the representatives of the other two Powers have
prevailed upon him to take the other course. Also, if possible, the
private treaty which he carries must be obtained. Now you may be
sure that he will take every precaution, for no man knows the risk
he is running better than himself."</p>
<p>"And how does this affect us?" asked a "brother."</p>
<p>"Well, you see, in the event of his slipping through the hands
of our friends on the Continent we must try to got the better of
him on this side of the water."</p>
<p>"Which way will he come?" I asked.</p>
<p>"It is not quite certain, but in all probability via Kingboro',
coming on to town by the 'Catton and Slowbridge' line. If he
doesn't meet with any accident abroad, he ought to be on our shores
on Friday evening. Now, listen, and I'll tell you what our plans
had better be. First of all, which of you knows Sklavotski by
sight?"</p>
<p>"I do," I replied. "I shouldn't seen forget him, with that scar
over his eyebrow and his big white moustache and imperial."</p>
<p>"Very well. Then you and the 'Lynx' (a sobriquet for another
"brother") and myself will go down to Kingboro' on Monday, and I'll
arrange to have a cipher telegram sent to me there detailing
movements abroad. I'll leave you, G&mdash;&mdash;, in charge here,
and wire you instructions if he doesn't come by that route. But
remember, all of you, be faithful to your oath, and do your
duty."</p>
<p>It in not worth while to mention the details of the meeting
which followed. Suffice it to say that on Monday night we three
above mentioned found ourselves meeting by appointment in a road
outside the East Coast seaport of Kingboro'.</p>
<p>"Hold yourselves to readiness to act to-morrow," said our
leader. "My advice states that the Ambassador's all right so
for&mdash;he's a clever one, he is&mdash;and he may get over here
after all. Now the boat is timed to arrive at seven to-morrow
evening. It's dark at six, so we'll meet in the road at the back of
the station."</p>
<p>"Have you got any plan?"</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>"I simply can't think of anything. But if he comes we'll have to
nab him somehow. Perhaps we'll do it in town. Anyway, we'd better
separate now. So, goodnight."</p>
<p>At six o'clock the next evening we met as arranged.</p>
<p>Koravitch had important news for us.</p>
<p>"I've had cipher telegrams to-day," he said, "which make the
affair more pressing than ever. Sklavotski is on his way. There's
to be an attempt to tamper with the boat's engines, though they
don't think it will come off. But on Ambassador Extraordinary from
one of the opposition Powers is making for England, and will be in
London early to-morrow morning, arriving at Dover by the first
boat. At all risks he must have some hours' start of Sklavotski, or
else the whole thing falls through."</p>
<p>"That means that Sklavotski must be prevented from getting to
London tonight," I said.</p>
<p>"Aye, not only presented. He must be kidnapped, and kept till
midday to-morrow."</p>
<p>"How is it to be done?"</p>
<p>"We must get him on the train, somehow."</p>
<p>"Are ordinary passengers allowed to travel by it?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;you go and take first-class singles to London. And
we'll keep an eye on each other, and on him."<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>The boat was late in arriving that night. We heard that some of
the machinery had got out of gear during the passage, but after a
short delay had easily been set right again. Anxiously we three
watched the passengers as they disembarked from the boat. There was
the usual medley&mdash;groups of laughing foreigners, two or three
phlegmatic Dutchmen, pale-faced ladies, oven to the inevitable
clergyman, an old man who was evidently nervous of the landing
platform, and who slipped at the end of it. I stepped forward and
helped him to his feet, receiving his thanks in a voice choked with
a cough. Presently we three spies instinctively glanced at one
another as an individual appeared on the landing platform, a man
wearing a heavy fur-lined coat, conspicuous for his large white
moustache and imperial. His soft hat was drawn down over his
forehead, but not no closely as to prevent a scar over his eye from
showing. It was Sklavotski! He appeared to have no luggage except a
handbag, and when this had been examined by the Customs officers we
followed him to the platform.</p>
<p>The train was drawn up&mdash;rather a long one&mdash;and behind
the rear brake-van was an extra coach containing a luggage, two
first, and two second compartments. The bulk of the passengers made
for the centre of the train, but Sklavotski, casting a searching
glance around him, walked straight to the last carriage and got
into the first-class compartment nearest the back of the carriage,
tipping the guard to lock him in.</p>
<p>It was at this moment Koravitch suddenly exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Oh, the fool&mdash;he's played right into our hands! Now,
quick, you two, get in that carriage."</p>
<p>"What&mdash;with him?"</p>
<p>"No, you can't do that. Get into the other first-class
compartment&mdash;the one at the front end of the carriage, and get
the guard to reserve it. I'll be with you in a minute."</p>
<p>We got in, and, curious to know what our leader was about, I
leaned out of the window to watch him. First he carefully observed
the space between the last carriage and the one in front of it.
Then he walked to the end of the train and gave a glance behind.
His next move was to run down the platform, and, looking round to
see if he were unobserved, he darted into a room, the door of which
opened on to the platform. In a moment he had emerged, apparently
holding something beneath his great coat. Then he joined us in the
carriage, and the guard locked us in.</p>
<p>"No stop before London, guard, is there?"</p>
<p>"No, sir."</p>
<p>In five minutes we were off, and Koravitch produced from under
his coat a railway lamp.</p>
<p>"What on earth are you going to do with that?" we asked.</p>
<p>"Well, it isn't worth while to make big accident out of this
trip, and I want the train itself to go on," he replied.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"You'll see presently&mdash;there's a big job before us. Now, do
you think you two can tackle Sklavotski?"</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"Well, you'll have to go along the footboard, and get in with
him. Then, somehow or other, you must persuade him to drink this
little refresher" (and he took out of his pocket a small bottle);
"you needn't be afraid, it will only make him sleep
comfortably."</p>
<p>"But what are you going to do?"</p>
<p>Koravitch first proceeded to light the lantern, and to turn on
the red glass. Then he answered:</p>
<p>"Well, I've got a very dangerous job. I'm going to uncouple this
carriage, and let the rest of the train go on. I shall put this
lamp behind the coach in front of us, for if the train ran on
without the tail light, she'd be pulled up pretty soon by a
signalman, and I want to leave the light on behind our carriage, so
that the next trains on the 'up' line will pull up at the red light
ahead of her, and so there won't be a smash. As to the uncoupling,
it's a difficult job, of course, but I know how to go about it.
It's lucky he did not travel by the opposition route, as those
trains are fitted with the auto-vacuum brake, and I should not have
been able to work it. But the 'Canon and Slowbridge' use the
'Westinghouse,' and I can turn off the cocks, and manage all right.
I know how that works. Then there's the electric communication to
unfasten. Then there are the safety chains on each side of the
coupling&mdash;they'll be easy enough&mdash;and lastly, the actual
coupling itself. There'll be just footing enough, or I'll manage to
hold on somehow while I unscrew the coupling, manipulate the brake,
and then when the coupling gets slack I'll slip it off the hook as
we go down a gradient. The train will go on, and we shall slowly
pull up. I know just the spot where it had better be worked, so
that we shall pull up in a quiet place. But there isn't any more
time for talking now."</p>
<p>"One moment," I said. "What do you propose doing if you manage
to stop the coach?"</p>
<p>"Oh, we'll get Sklavotski out of it."</p>
<p>"And then?"</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"Then we'll think of further developments. Sufficient to the
moment is the danger thereof&mdash;quite sufficient. Now, then, off
you go. Stop, here's a railway key in case his door's locked. Take
care not to let those people in the other compartments see you.
Good luck, and I'll be with you presently. Steady, now. One out of
each door, so as to take him on each side!"</p>
<p>So saying, he put the lamp under his coat, so as not to be seen
by anyone as he walked along the footboard, while "the Lynx" and I
stepped out, one on either side of the carriage, I taking the key,
as it was on my side that the guard had locked the door. Very
stealthily I crept along the footboard, carefully avoiding being
seen by the occupants of the second-class compartment I had to
pass. At length I arrived opposite the door of the compartment in
which Sklavotski was travelling, and ventured to look in at a
corner of the window. He was lying down on the seat, with his bag
for a pillow, apparently fast asleep. At this moment I caught sight
of my companion's face at the opposite window, and saw that he was
ready for the attack. Quickly and noiselessly I inserted my key and
unlocked the carriage door. To open it and spring in was the work
of another instant, and simultaneously my companion entered by his
door. Sklavotski sprang up and uttered a curse in Russian; but in
less time than it takes to tell the story we were on him, and,
holding him down firmly to the seat, notwithstanding his violent
struggles we managed to force his mouth open by holding his
nostrils, and to pour the contents of the little bottle down his
throat. A shudder or two ran through him, his struggles grew less
and less, and very soon he was resting quietly, to all intents and
purposes fast asleep.</p>
<p>Then we turned our thoughts to Koravitch. He had not yet
appeared, and we were still rushing along at 50 miles an hour. I
looked out of the window, craning my neck to see as far as
possible, and then to my joy observed that the train in front of
our carriage was leaving us, and that a red light was gleaming
brightly behind as she sped into the darkness. At the same moment a
dark figure appeared creeping along the footboard, and Koravitch
entered our carriage.</p>
<p>"Bravo," he said, "capital! You fellows have managed it
splendidly."</p>
<p>"And you?"</p>
<p>"It was a terribly tough job, but I meant to do it. The screw
coupling was the difficulty. I've got my left wrist sprained
holding on&mdash;lucky I've gone in for gymnastics, for I couldn't
have managed it else. But there's no time to talk now&mdash;we're
slowing down. There's a bit of an up gradient here that will soon
pull us up."</p>
<p>"What's the next move, then?"</p>
<p>"To get this fellow out of it. Ah, the handbag." He ran
hurriedly through its controls. "No, it's not in that. I'll pitch
it out, then. Now&mdash;we're slowing up. Open the door on this
side. Good! We're on an embankment. As seen as we stop, I'll get
out, and you drop him and follow. We must chance those people in
the 'seconds' seeing us, but it's precious dark, and I don't think
they will. As soon as the carriage pulls up it will begin to roll
back down the incline, and from what I know of the line will go
half a mile before stepping. We're stopping&mdash;I'll jump," and
he sprang out into the six-foot way. We had got the sleeping
ambassador ready on the floor, and in half a minute we were all out
of the carriage, just before it stopped.</p>
<p>"Lie down," said Koravitch.</p>
<p>We did on. The carriage, surely enough, began at this moment to
roll back. A window was opened and a head thrust out. The speed
increased as the coach passed us, and we heard a voice say in
German:</p>
<p>"Ach Himmel! we've broken loose!"</p>
<p>That was all, and we waited for no more. Then we carried the
ambassador down the embankment, and found ourselves in a field.
"What shall we do now?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Well, the first thing is to get as far away from the line as
possible," answered Koravitch, "and we must take him with
us&mdash;better carry him by turns. He's not extra heavy; who'll
take first?"</p>
<p>"I will," I said. So Sklavotski was hoisted on to my shoulders,
and we started off. Presently we struck a narrow country lane,
which led us away from the railway. We had gone nearly three miles
down this lane, carefully avoiding a little row of houses in it,
when Koravitch, who was carrying the ambassador, suddenly stopped,
and exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Look here, we can't go on like this. We must hide the fellow
somewhere. He'll come to presently."</p>
<p>"But what are we to do?" asked "the Lynx."</p>
<p>"Where can we hide him?"</p>
<p>"Shall we get him to some wood?" I said.</p>
<p>"But it's precious cold, and we ought to stick to him for some
hours yet; in fact, he ought not to be allowed to get free till
well on in the morning. Now let's think. Hullo! I've got a plan.
What's that building in front of us?"</p>
<p>"Looks like a church," I said.</p>
<p>"Exactly so; it is a church&mdash;I know the country now. It's
Little Prebbleton Church, and there isn't a house to speak of
within a quarter of a mile of it. It's the last place anyone would
dream of entering this time of night, for it's nearly nine o'clock;
so let's make for it. We shall be safe inside, and I've got a
little dark lantern with me that will help us look over things a
bit."</p>
<p>So saying, he led the way to the church, and we were soon
picking our way over the churchyard, among the tombs, which stood
out in ghastly dimness. Koravitch made for one of the windows, and
after some little trouble, managed to force it open. He got in
first, and then we lifted Sklavotski through the window and
followed ourselves. It was a grim, uncanny feeling that possessed
us as we stood in the church. After fumbling about for a few
moments we found our way to the vestry, a snug little carpeted nook
divided from one of the side aisles by a heavy curtain. Then
Koravitch lit his lantern, carefully turning it away from the one
window which the vestry possessed.</p>
<p>"Are you going to stay here all night?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Well, perhaps it might be as well," he answered, "unless we tie
him up, and leave him here. To-morrow's Saturday, and I should
think someone would find him then&mdash;they're pretty well sure to
come in and get the place ready for Sunday. If not, he won't die if
he isn't found till Sunday morning, for we could give him a feed
before we go. But the first thing to do is to search him, and to
see if we can find anything of importance."</p>
<p>So saying, Koravitch went carefully through the ambassador's
pockets. He found some money of various nations, and at length
brought out a pocket-book.</p>
<p>"Here it is," he exclaimed, and we gathered round him eagerly as
he opened it. But disappointment awaited us; beyond a few receipted
hotel bills and unimportant papers, the pocket-book was empty.</p>
<p>"Where can it be?" said Koravitch.</p>
<p>"In London with Monsieur Sklavotski!" said a voice, which made
us start and look round. The ambassador had risen upon his feet,
and was smiling at us.</p>
<p>"What?" we exclaimed. "How&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Pardon, gentlemen," said the other, "I have awakened before you
were quite ready for me. No, you needn't attempt to attack me, for
I am not going to run away. There is no need. You were asking, I
think, for the whereabouts of a certain little paper you thought I
had in my possession. I replied that it is now probably in London,
and in the safe keeping of Monsieur Sklavotski, whose person it has
not left since he started from St. Petersburg. I see I astonish
you. Gentlemen, you have been labouring under a slight
misapprehension, and I will now make things clear to you. Allow me
to introduce myself as Monsieur Klaboulf, a servant of the
Ambassador."</p>
<p>And so saying he tore off his moustache and imperial, wiped the
scar from his forehead with a handkerchief, and bowed to us with a
smile. We were too much astonished to utter a word, and he went
on:</p>
<p>"You see, gentlemen, it was only to be expected that Monsieur
Sklavotski would find his journey dangerous and inconvenient, and
so he hit upon a simple little plan. He shaved himself, and managed
to paint out the scar, so that no one could possibly recognise him.
And then he paid me to take the danger and inconvenience upon
myself. Ah, it has been a very troublesome journey, I assure you. I
only just escaped six inches of cold steel besides other
disagreeable adventures. And when I came on shore to-night I was
tired out. But I had my work still. I knew someone was watching me,
so, in order to draw attention from Monsieur Sklavotski himself,
who was travelling with me. I went ostentatiously to the last
carriage."</p>
<p>"And where was the Ambassador?" hissed Koravitch.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, my friend. Didn't you see an old clergyman get off
the boat? Ah, you didn't think to notice him, did you? Never mind.
Well, as soon as the train started I fell asleep, and was only
awakened by the somewhat violent intrusion. Then they kindly sent
me to sleep again, and the first thing I remember was being lifted
in at the window just now&mdash;and that's my story."</p>
<p>Koravitch bit his lip with anger.</p>
<p>"Then it's all up?" he said.</p>
<p>"Exactly so, gentlemen. Monsieur Sklavotski intended going
straight to the Foreign Office, where he was expected, on reaching
town. Your scheme was a bold and clever one, though how I got here
I don't know. And now that you have failed what do you intend to do
with me? I presume you bear me no ill-will; and, as we've both
played our little part, there's an end of it."</p>
<p>"Curse you," said Koravitch.</p>
<p>"Oh, of course, if you like. Well, gentlemen, I'm in your hands.
What are you going to do with me?"</p>
<p>"You take it pretty coolly," said Koravitch.</p>
<p>"Why, yes; I've been accustomed to dangerous predicaments."</p>
<p>"I like your courage."</p>
<p>The man bowed.</p>
<p>"Are you willing to solemnly swear that you will take no steps
against us till the morning?"</p>
<p>"My friends, we had better let the matter end here. I don't want
to take any steps against you. Why should I?&mdash;the game's ours.
If you let me go now, I promise to find my way to the nearest inn,
and to say nothing whatever about you. Are you satisfied?"</p>
<p>Well, the end of it was that we agreed to let him go, for we
didn't want murder on our hands, and we were rather struck with his
coolness. So once more we found ourselves outside the churchyard
gate.</p>
<p>"Good night, gentlemen," he said. "You will take more care the
next time you try to trick Monsieur Sklavotski. I assure you he's
not an easy man to be caught napping&mdash;but there, you know
it."</p>
<p>He walked off in one direction, and we in another. In a couple
of hours we found ourselves in the neighbourhood of C&mdash;, and
arranged to get a lodging for the night.</p>
<p>We heard afterwards that a signalman saw the escaped carriage
running back past his box and gave the alarm. The passengers
remaining in the detached coach were "intelligent foreigners," so
they were politely told that "they had got into a 'slip coach' that
did not work to London. Before starting they should have enquired
of the guard, who would have put them in the front part of the
train for London." Much excitement was caused when it was found
that some of the passengers were missing, but the real state of the
case was never known. The result is now a matter of history, though
few knew at the time how nearly the settlement of peace came to be
frustrated.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>A PERILOUS RIDE</h2>
<p>It is astonishing how at times the wisest and most careful men
are befooled into performing acts of considerable trouble to
themselves only to serve a purpose useless to them. Everyone knows
the story of Sir Isaac Newton, who, being much annoyed by a cat and
her kitten continually crying to come into or go out of his study,
made two entrances by sawing out pieces from the bottom of the
door&mdash;a large opening for the cat, and a small one for the
kitten! So, in the story about to be related of Koravitch, that
astute individual, as will be seen, was once prevailed upon to
undertake what proved to be a very dangerous adventure, and
certainly by no means to his advantage. But I had better let the
chronicler of his exploits relate the details, as follows:</p>
<p>It was on the occasion narrated in a former memoir of my
remarkable friend Koravitch&mdash;the time when I ran across him in
America&mdash;that he told me, together with several other personal
adventures&mdash;some of which have already been narrated&mdash;the
following extraordinary story. I had been saying to him:</p>
<p>"Well, you certainly seem fated to take part in adventures of
the railway. Have you anything else you can tell me in connection
with the line?"</p>
<p>He thought for a moment, and then replied:</p>
<p>"Yes; I could tell you several little stories that would
interest you. You see, before I turned my hand to political
intriguing I had a few years of railway life, mostly in India,
where I did a bit of engineering work, besides a few months in
Australia. I must tell you some day of an exciting time I had at a
little station in the latter country, when some bush-rangers
captured the station as a preliminary to boarding the train, and
bound the only two occupants&mdash;the station-clerk and
myself&mdash;hand and foot; and another little story of a ride I
once had on a locomotive in India, when I was doing driver's duty
owing to shortness of hands, and the native fireman 'ran amuck' on
the footplate."</p>
<p>"I should think that's about the worst ride you ever
had&mdash;worse even than the night when we tried to capture
Sklavotski, eh?" I asked.</p>
<p>Koravitch removed the cigar he was smoking from between his lips
and gazed at it, pondering for a minute or two. Then he said,
slowly:</p>
<p>"The worst ride I ever had? Well, not exactly. There was one
that beat it, though I'm not very fond of talking about it, because
I made such a fool of myself on one occasion. It was a nasty
experience, though, and I wouldn't go through it again in a hurry,
I can tell you."</p>
<p>"Where was it&mdash;India?"</p>
<p>"No, England, on a 'racing' train&mdash;the Scotch express."</p>
<p>"How did it&mdash;"</p>
<p>"There, don't ask me any more questions about it. I suppose you
want to hear the whole yarn, so you may as well have it. You
remember the great 'race to the North' of a few years ago, don't
you?"</p>
<p>"Rather! I took a great deal of interest in it at the time."</p>
<p>"Humph! Well, there's a little incident connected with that race
that may re-awaken your interest when you hear of it, for I don't
expect it's known to you. And, moreover, it will serve to explain
why one of the racing trains went wrong on one occasion."</p>
<p>"Which&mdash;the Great 'North Eastern' or the&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Didn't I tell you not to ask too many questions? Now let me
begin at the beginning. At the time of the 'race' I was living in
the neighbourhood of Tottenham Court Road&mdash;the old place, you
know&mdash;and, if you will mind back to that particular year, you
will remember that our 'Secret Society' was more than usually busy.
Several important political intrigues were in operation, and some
of our most cherished interests were at stake. More than one of the
'heads' of the Society had come over to England, and in one way or
another our work was well cut out.</p>
<p>"It was one morning towards the end of August that I received by
post&mdash;what was not very unusual for me&mdash;a mysterious
missive, which began with the secret name by which I was known in
the Society, and read thus:</p>
<p>"'Use every effort to prevent Scotch Express 8 p.m. from Newston
to-morrow (Thursday) arriving at Aberdeen before Great East
Northern train. Most important. See papers.'</p>
<p>"This letter was signed by a very influential member of the
Society, and I had no doubt that some important interest was at
stake. The day on which I received the letter was Thursday, so, if
I was to carry out the order, there was certainly no time to be
lost. A last night's paper was lying on my table, and, heeding the
warning at the end of the letter, I took it up and scanned it. My
attention was arrested by the following paragraphs, which seemed to
bear on the case in point:</p>
<p>"'The Queen is still staying at Balmoral. She drove out
yesterday accompanied by the Princess Beatrice.</p>
<p>"'It is rumoured that the Prime Minister will pay a special
visit to Her Majesty, travelling by the Scotch Express to-morrow
evening. This visit is said to be occasioned by fresh complications
which have arisen in the Bulgarian Question.'</p>
<p>"Not being satisfied, however, with this, I sent out for a
morning paper, and found still more to interest me. There was a
paragraph something to this effect:</p>
<p>"'Count von Scheuzinger, Envoy Extraordinary from the Austrian
Government, is expected to arrive in London late this afternoon.
His Excellency will seek the earliest opportunity for an interview
with the Queen, and will in all probability proceed to Aberdeen
immediately after a brief visit to the Foreign Office.'</p>
<p>"I began to see daylight. Evidently it was wished that this
individual should be able to steal a march on the Premier, and the
latter had selected the 'West Northern Route' for his journey
northward. I turned to Bradshaw, and hunted up the trains from
Aberdeen to Ballater. The 'Queen's Special' left the former at 3.50
a.m. That was too early for either express to catch. The next train
from Aberdeen was at 7.10, and at the time of the 'race' either
express would catch it easily. So the only alternative at which I
could arrive was that the foreign ambassador, if he reached
Aberdeen before the Prime Minister, would drive to Balmoral. At all
events, one thing was clear, and that was that I was ordered to
delay the West Northern express. Again I turned to the paper, and
read the following:</p>
<blockquote>"'THE RACE TO THE NORTH.<br>
<br>
"'Yesterday morning the West Northern express was again to the
front in the railway race, arriving at Aberdeen at 5.15 a.m., while
its rival from Queen's Cross reached that station at 5.31. Last
night both trains started at 8 o'clock, the drivers keenly alive to
the work required of them, but, of course, we go to press too early
to know the result of their respective journeys. To-night, however,
it is anticipated that the race will be more exciting that ever,
for the West Northern officials state that they will not only run
the express in two portions, but that the first half will only
consist of four coaches, and they are pretty well determined that
it will not only beat their rival, but also prove a record run.
Those who favour the Great East Northern Route will also be
interested to hear that every possible pains are being taken in
order that to-night's run shall also be a record.'</blockquote>
<p>"Here was a pretty problem for me to work out! I was accustomed
to all sorts of intrigues and risks, but to undertake the delaying
of a special racing train seemed rather a large order. I sallied
forth, trying to hatch some scheme, and wended my way first to
Queen's Cross. Here it was my luck, on pretending to be a
representative of the Press, to get a brief interview with the man
who had been told off to drive the train on its first stage that
night.</p>
<p>"'Shall we beat 'em, sir?' he remarked. 'Can't say, I'm sure.
It's a ticklish point. They've had the pull of us yet, for, you
see, although they've 540 miles to our 523, they've got an
advantage in being able to pick up water as they go along, and so
their tenderweight's a good deal less than ours. They've got a bit
better track, I believe, too, though it's a stiff pull up the Snap
bank between Breston and Carline. Of course, we shall do our best,
but I wouldn't like to promise you the G.E.N. 'll win.'</p>
<p>"This was discouraging, and I sought the rival terminus. There I
managed to learn that every effort was being made to run a record
that night, and that it would be very surprising if the G.E.N. got
the better of them. I tried to get into the engine sheds in the
hope of having a chance to tamper with the locomotive that was
going to do the first stage of the journey, or at least to get at
the driver. But it was all of no use. The officials seemed
particularly reticent, and I could get no information whatever.
Tired and cross, I returned to my rooms to rest as best I could and
think out the situation. All sorts of ideas presented themselves to
my mind: going down the line, capturing some lonely signal-box, and
keeping the signals against the express; setting a red light on the
line to stop the train, as I did once on the Nord Belge Railway;
but nothing seemed feasible, and at length I determined to travel
myself on the express, in the hope that some unforeseen opportunity
would turn up and help me to delay the train. With this purpose in
my mind I started from my lodgings some little time after seven
o'clock in the evening. It was darker than usual for the time of
year, for the sky had become overcast with heavy clouds, and a
severe thunderstorm was threatening to break.</p>
<p>"I was wending my way through some of the back streets in the
neighbourhood of N.W. London, where itinerant vendors of fruit and
vegetables are apt to expose their wares for sale on barrows, when
one of these gentlemen, who was packing up his scales, let a weight
slip just as I passed, with the result that it struck my foot in
falling.</p>
<p>"'Beg pardon, guv'nor!' he remarked, in answer to my somewhat
angry ejaculation. "Ope it ain't 'urt ye, but 'tain't only a
two-pounder, and it might have been worse.'</p>
<p>"'Bad enough as it is,' I replied, 'for it caught me a nasty
knock.'</p>
<p>"'Better than 'avin' a twenty pun' wyte on yer foot, same as one
of my brothers did once&mdash;that's enough to lime a bloomin'
great elephant.'</p>
<p>"I was about to pass on when a sudden idea struck me, and I
turned to the man.</p>
<p>"'What's the biggest weight you have in stock?'</p>
<p>"'Only four pun'. There ain't no use for anything above that on
my barrer.'</p>
<p>"'Where can I buy a twenty-pound weight?'</p>
<p>"'Eh! Are yer goin' in fur sellin' coals, guv'nor? Well, on the
second turnin' to the right there's an ironmonger's shop, where
they sell such things; and let me&mdash;'</p>
<p>"I was off to the shop before he had finished, and somewhat
astonished the proprietor by purchasing a twenty-pound weight, with
a bar-handle let into it, and taking it away with me. It was an
awkward thing to carry, of course. I had it done up in brown paper,
and grasped the handle through this as well as I could. What did I
want it for? Wait a minute and you'll see.</p>
<p>"When I reached the portico of the station the storm had begun
to break, and, in spite of the fact that it was still only a
quarter to eight, darkness had set in. I was very glad of this, as
it favoured my plot&mdash;in fact, it was necessary that it should
be quite dark. As I strolled on to the platform the engine was just
backing in with full steam up&mdash;one of the well-known compounds
of the 'West Northern' type. Of course there were a number of
people looking on, and at first it seemed as though I should not
succeed in my plan, which was to travel unobserved on the front of
the engine that pulled the 'Scotch Express.'</p>
<p>"Four minutes to eight, and still the opportunity had not come.
Then a brilliant idea seized me. One compartment of the train was
still unoccupied, except by the light luggage of three passengers,
who were standing on the platform, one of whom I recognised as the
Prime Minister. To dart into the 'sleeper,' open the opposite door,
and get out on the other side was the work of a few seconds, and to
my joy I found myself in the six-foot way <i>between two
trains</i>&mdash;the 'Express' and an 'empty' drawn up alongside,
so that my movements were quite concealed from observation. Along
in between the trains I crept, lugging my big weight with me, past
the tender of the engine, past the cab&mdash;the driver and fireman
being too much engaged on the other side to notice me&mdash;past
the two sets of driving-wheels peculiar to this type of engine,
until I stood close to its front. How I wished at that moment that
the West Northern Railway built their engines on the 'bogie'
system, for, of course, that would have given me a much larger
space in front of the smoke-box. But I screwed up my courage,
placed the weight on the narrow platform in front of the engine,
and prepared to spring on myself as soon as she started.</p>
<p>"Nor had I very long to wait, for, punctually to the moment, the
driver opened the regulator, and off she steamed on her journey
north, with Screwe as her first stopping-place, <i>unless I managed
that it should be otherwise</i>. At the same moment I grasped the
frame and drew myself up on to the narrow platform in front, taking
care to crouch down as much as possible, so as to avoid being seen
by anyone on the platform. As we cleared the roof of the terminus
the rain pelted down in torrents, and before we reached the first
tunnel I was wet to the skin. The darkness had become intense, for
which I was only too thankful, as it prevented me from being seen.
By the time we ran through Williamsden Junction the speed was very
great, and it was as much as I could do to hold on by the vacuum
brake-pipe in front as I lay with my knees drawn up on my narrow
and jolting resting-place.</p>
<p>"Out into the country and the black night we raced, running
against time and our rival of the Great East Northern, with the
blast thundering up the chimney close behind me, and the good
engine quivering with the strain. No joke even to be on the
footplate behind a comfortable cab on such a night; but to be
riding where I was might strike a feeling of uneasiness into the
heart of many a man bolder than myself.</p>
<p>"Once I was in great peril of being discovered. I happened to
raise myself from my crouching position for a moment, holding on to
the hand-rail in front of the chimney, when, as I looked back, I
saw the fireman coming to the front with his oil-can. In horror I
crouched round to the opposite side, stooping as far as possible in
case the driver should see me through the weather glass.
Fortunately the fireman went back the way he had come, or I must,
of course, have been caught.</p>
<p>"But the worst was to come, for I had stationed myself there for
a purpose, and, as our head-light shone upon the narrow trough of
water between the rails at Thorney, I laid hold of my weight and
prepared to act. But, no, we were not to pick up water here; the
scoop was not let down, I knew, because I heard no splash. So on we
went, until I was chilled to the bone with the rain and rush
through the storm, until at length we reached the top of the long
gradient that rises more or less all the way between London and
Wing, and were dashing down at fearful speed through Sheddington
and Laytown.</p>
<p>"When we were through Bletchton I prepared to act once more, and
presently I had grasped the weight by its handle and was holding it
over the buffer-plate exactly in the centre, as far down as I could
possibly reach&mdash;right over the middle of the track. It seemed
ages, and I thought I could never hold on; but presently I caught a
glimpse of something shining ahead, and we were over the water
trough at Castledean.</p>
<p>"Splash! The driver had let down the scoop, and there was not an
instant to lose. Reaching as far down as possible, I dropped the
twenty-pound weight into the water-trough between the rails. A
moment afterwards and there was a crash&mdash;faint enough beneath
the roar of the locomotive, but sufficient to distinguish in it the
ripping sound of tearing iron. Immediately the splashing ceased,
and I knew the weight had done its work. It had fallen into the
trough, and, naturally, the scoop struck it as it came along and
was completely destroyed, the effect being that it was impossible
to pick up any more water <i>en route</i>, and that the driver
would be compelled to stop and replenish his tank before he reached
Screwe.</p>
<p>"And stop he had to. I very soon knew by the sound of the engine
and her blast that he had notched her up as much as he dared, and
was afraid to open his damper much. The speed slackened slightly,
and it was evident that it would be a ticklish job for him to get
as far as Mugby without his lead plug blowing off. But, as I
afterwards heard, he understood his engine thoroughly, and he did
it. I was too much occupied in getting off unobserved as we drew up
at Mugby to notice things, but I just heard him shout to someone on
the platform:</p>
<p>"Look alive there with that water! It's a fine night's work
this! What's up? Why, someone must have fouled the road and put a
big block of iron or something in the water-troughs. We'll not win
the race to-night, that's certain!'</p>
<p>"Nor did they. What the West Northern's record would have been
without that stop it's impossible to say, for as it was they ran
into Aberdeen at 4.51 the next morning. But the Great East Northern
was there already, a good eleven minutes in front of them at
Linaber Junction, and for once the West Northern had to take a
'back seat,' for of course it was on their portion of the track
that the mishap occurred.</p>
<p>"And what was the result, do you ask? Did Count Scheuzinger
reach Balmoral before the Prime Minister, and why was it that the
Secret Society wanted him to do so? No, the Austrian Ambassador, as
it happened, had travelled down with the Prime Minister by the West
Northern Route, and I had been made a fool of. How? Why, the next
evening, after arriving back in town utterly done up with my
exertions, you may imagine my feelings when a letter came by the
last post for me, which read somewhat as follows:</p>
<blockquote>"My dear sir,&mdash;I really cannot refrain from
writing both to thank you for a service you have, as I suppose,
rendered me, and also to congratulate you on what must have been an
exceedingly daring exploit. But let me explain myself.<br>
<br>
"I may as well state that for some time past I have been acquainted
with the methods of your Secret Society, and, in fact, in order to
further certain ends of my own have succeeded in more than once
penetrating into some of your meetings. It was at one of these that
I first became aware of your daring and ability in a certain
adventure of the railway undertaken by yourself, and based upon
your technical knowledge and skill; and I well remembered how it
was said at the time that when any difficult enterprise connected
with the line had to be undertaken, you were the man, <i>par
excellence</i>, to evolve the scheme and to carry it out. It was
this that led me to select you to aid me in a little matter that
concerned myself. The fact is, there has been a good deal of
betting lately on the 'Race to the North,' and, of course, the odds
have been the last few days very much against the East Coast Route.
Being myself one of that class of people known as 'prodigal sons,'
and not yet having eschewed the husks of fortune for the ways of
piety, it occurred to me that there was something in taking heavy
odds as above if I could claim your assistance in delaying the West
Coast train. I accordingly wrote to you, taking the liberty to sign
myself as one of those whom I knew you would obey, suggesting that
you should stop the express from Newston, while certain paragraphs
in the papers to which I mysteriously alluded probably lent colour
to my request<br>
<br>
"'At all events, when I saw you at Newston platform last night (for
naturally I was there) I felt sure that my little plot had
succeeded&mdash;especially when I observed that you had chosen a
somewhat novel method of travelling northwards, for I just caught
sight of you in front of the engine as the train started. What was
your exact method of procedure I do not know, but as there was a
breakdown I naturally surmise that you had something to do with it.
Your journey must have been, to say the least of it, somewhat
unpleasant, but you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you
have earned the gratitude and substantially increased the wealth
of<br>
<br>
"Yours very truly,<br>
"East Coast Route.<br>
<br>
"P.S.&mdash;I am sorry I cannot sign my real name but the reason
must be obvious to you.'</blockquote>
<p>"And so," added Koravitch, "you see I had been fearfully and
wonderfully sold. I never discovered who the individual was that I
had unwittingly served; but, at all events, that was the most
terrible ride I ever had on a locomotive, and I don't think I'd
care to undertake such an experience again."<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>NOTE.-It is worth recording that in the race to the North of
1895 the times of arrival at Aberdeen on the last three days were
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<pre>
              West Coast. East Coast.

August 20th      4.58        5.11

August 21st      4.51        4.40

August 22nd      4.32        6.23
</pre>
<p>Also I have it on reliable information that on the night of the
21st an L. and N.W. engine broke down in some way between Bletchley
and Crewe and considerably delayed the train. I mention the
coincidence as a remarkable one. Perhaps "Koravitch" has explained
another railway incident!</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>THE CONVICT'S REVENGE</h2>
<p>"Ugh!" said my companion to me, with a shiver and a little
clutch at my arm. "That's a thing I hate!"</p>
<p>We were standing by a level-crossing as he spoke. We had almost
started to cross the rails, when a rumble and a whistle and the
bright glare of the head-lights heralded the close approach of a
train. So we stood back for a moment or two to let the iron steed
and his load pass. The lights from the carriages flashed out upon
us, then there was a swirl of wind as darkness came on once more,
and the red tail-light vanished round the curve beyond.</p>
<p>"Why," I remarked with a laugh, as we went on again, "surely an
old soldier and ex-prison warder like yourself isn't afraid of a
passing train?"</p>
<p>"Ah, sir, every man has his weakness, and I'm not ashamed to
confess that I've got mine. And, perhaps, if you'd had an
experience that happened to me some ten years ago, you'd flinch a
bit when an express train rattled past you."</p>
<p>"Oh, there's a foundation for it, is there?"</p>
<p>"There is, sir, and if you care to step inside my little place
and rest for half an hour, I'll tell you the yarn, such as it
is."</p>
<p>I expressed myself only too delighted to pick up the proferred
information. I must explain before I go further that until the
evening in question my companion had been unknown to me. I had been
staying for a few days at the little cathedral city of Dullminster,
and had been on a day's fishing excursion in the neighbourhood with
no companion save my pipe. It was while pensively watching my float
in the quiet little stream that a fine-looking old fellow appeared,
bent on the same sport as myself, and took up his position close
by. As bites were few and far between, we entered into
conversation, and when dusk set in, by mutual consent, we packed
our traps and set off together over the pleasant fields that lay
between us and Dullminster. He told me something of his past
history as we trudged along, from which I gathered that he had
begun life in the Army, and afterwards he had been a warder in the
well-known convict prison of Dartport, from which post he had
retired into private life some few years since, and had come to eke
out a restful existence on savings and pension in Dullminster, the
place of his birth.</p>
<p>A few hundred yards beyond the level crossing we stopped at the
door of a little house in one of the streets in the outskirts of
the town.</p>
<p>"Come in, sir," said the old fellow. "I'm all by
myself&mdash;yes, an old bachelor, sir. And if you'll condescend to
have a cup of tea, while I spin you the yarn, you're welcome to
it."</p>
<p>It was a chilly autumn evening, and the bright fire and singing
kettle in the little sitting-room looked very inviting, so I gladly
accepted mine host's invitation.</p>
<p>"And now, sir," said he, when we were comfortably settled, "I'll
tell you why I don't like to be near an express train at night.</p>
<p>"Of course, as you can imagine, we used to have some queer
customers at Dartport. Her Majesty's private hotels take all kinds
of folk, and we are not particular as to character. One of the
worst gaol-birds that I ever remember was a certain convict whom I
will call by his old number-36. He was in for a long
sentence&mdash;in fact, as far as I know, he's doing time yet;
though if there'd been a little more evidence forthcoming at his
trial, his term of imprisonment would have been a short one, ending
in the prison-yard on the scaffold; but as it was, though his list
of crimes was a pretty black one, murder couldn't quite be proved,
though there were few that doubted he hadn't stuck at that.</p>
<p>"From the moment I set eyes on him at Dartport I knew there'd be
trouble with No. 36. It wasn't only the size and strength of the
man, but a certain nasty look about his eyes that told me this. Nor
was I mistaken, for he proved to be one of the most unmanageable
brutes we ever had. He soon took a particularly strong dislike to
me, for, as ill-luck would have it, I was the first to have to
report him for misconduct, and it was through me that he had his
first taste of the cat. When I went into his cell that night, he
broke the strict rule of silence, and hissed out:&mdash;</p>
<p>"You devil of a turnkey, I'll kill you before I've finished with
you.'</p>
<p>"It was a threat I had heard more than once before, and it
didn't affect me very much at the time, though I had good reason to
remember it afterwards.</p>
<p>"Two years passed, and No. 36 showed no signs of improving. He
had a marvellous physique, and the prison diet seemed in no way to
diminish his strength. He had to be most carefully watched in the
quarries, and in fact always, for he had a nasty knack of being
dangerous in more ways than one. At length, towards the end of the
summer of the year of which I am speaking, he suddenly turned over
a new leaf, and became quiet and tractable. I felt less sure of him
than ever, nevertheless, for I had seen something of this phase of
character before, and I knew it generally meant mischief. Nor was I
mistaken, for one afternoon, when a fog had come on rather
unexpectedly, the sharp crack of a rifle betokened the escape of
No. 36. Taking advantage of the mist, he had suddenly struck the
nearest warder to the ground, hurled a big bit of stone with deadly
aim at one sentry, completely bowling him over, taking the chance
of a bullet from another&mdash;and was off!</p>
<p>"A search party was, of course, organized at once, but somehow
or other he managed to show a clean pair of heels and escape over
the moors. As darkness set in, a poor old man was found dazed and
half naked, about a couple miles from the prison, and, after being
revived, he told how No. 36 had met him and insisted upon having
all his upper garments, so that the runaway had an extra good
chance of getting clear.</p>
<p>"It was between nine and ten o'clock at night that I, in company
with several other members of a search party, halted for a little
consultation just by the embankment of the railway, the main 'West
Southern,' line to London, that runs through the desolate bit of
country some five or six miles north of Dartport Prison.</p>
<p>"'I wonder whether it's any use having a look at Westmoor
Station,' said our chief.</p>
<p>"Westmoor Station was about two miles up the line from where we
were standing.</p>
<p>"'Aye,' I replied, 'it's just possible that he might be lying
around there, looking out for a train; though it's my belief that
he's making northward&mdash;at any rate, it's more likely.'</p>
<p>"'Well, Davis,' said the chief, after a moment or two's thought,
'suppose you go to Westwood. It may be worth trying. I think we
ought to go on to Hartwell, or that direction. What do you
say?'</p>
<p>"I'm willing to do as you suggest,' I answered. It's just as
well to see the station-master, I think.'</p>
<p>"All right. You slip away, then, Davis. You'd better keep along
the line&mdash;it's the nearest way.'</p>
<p>"So I started off along the line. It was a very dark night,
though the fog had lifted, and it was some moments before I got
used to the track. After a bit, however, I made pretty fair
progress, walking between the down pair rails on the right-hand
side, so that I could see the head-lights of any train coming
towards me. I hadn't gone far before I did a very foolish thing. I
slung my rifle over my shoulders, so as to leave my hands free.</p>
<p>"I had gone about half a mile or more up the line when a great
longing for a pipe came over me. I hadn't had a pipe all day, and
as you're a smoker, sir, you know pretty well how I was feeling. As
I walked along I took out my pouch, filled my pipe, and then felt
in my pocket for a match. After nearly turning it inside out I
found one solitary wax vesta. Now, there was a bit of a wind
blowing over the moor, and fearful lest I should waste my precious
match, I refrained from striking it until I could get behind some
shelter. The desired object presently appeared, looming through the
darkness, in the shape of a little platelayer's hut on the same
side of the line as I was walking, the door facing towards the
rails. Getting into the shelter of the doorway, I struck the match,
and was just about to light my pipe, when, as I leaned against the
door, to my astonishment it opened inwards with my weight, almost
precipitating me to the ground, and before I could recover myself
the light of the vesta revealed to me the hideous face of No. 36,
who was hiding within.</p>
<p>"With a snarl he was upon me, and had clutched me by the throat
with his strong, bony hands. It was all done so suddenly that I had
scarcely time to think of what was happening, and had hardly
realized the situation, when I found myself sprawling on my back
with the ugly brute on the top of me. Of course, I made a mighty
effort to defend myself, but I was quite powerless in his strong
grip.</p>
<p>"Ah,' he growled, with a curse, as he held me pinned to the
ground, it's you, is it? Well, I've got a few old accounts to
settle with you, and I don't think there could be a better
opportunity.'</p>
<p>"'You brute!' I ejaculated, trying to twist myself out of his
grasp.</p>
<p>"Ah&mdash;would you? Not so fast, Warder Davis. The tables are
turned now, and you're the prisoner.'</p>
<p>"At this moment something flashing bright in the dim star-light
fell out of my pocket and clanged on the gravel ballast of the
railway track.</p>
<p>"'Good,' said No. 36, making a snatch at it; 'these bracelets
were meant for me, I suppose. Perhaps they'd prove as good a fit on
your wrists. At any rate, we'll try. And as we haven't a cell handy
to fix you in, we'll fasten you down to something secure&mdash;do
you hear?'</p>
<p>"And putting forth all his strength, in spite of my desperate
struggles, he half dragged, half rolled me on to the down track
close beside us. Then, kneeling on my chest, he forced my right
hand beneath the outer rail between the sleepers, and my left arm
over the rail, then there was a sharp click, as with a savage
chuckle he snapped the handcuffs over both my wrists, and I
realized my terrible position. <i>I was handcuffed down to the
rail</i>!</p>
<p>"He jumped up in triumph, felt in my pocket, drew out the key of
the handcuffs, and hurled it away.</p>
<p>"'How now, you white-livered skunk?' he snarled. 'I could kill
you outright with a knock on the head if I chose. But <i>I'm</i>
not going to commit murder, oh, no! I'll leave that to the down
express. Do you understand? If it runs at the same time as it used
to, it ought to come by here about eleven o'clock, and I guess
there'll be a little obstruction in its way to-night. Ah! I've got
to fix you a bit tighter, my friend, just to make sure, you
know.'</p>
<p>"And he went into the hut, reappearing in a few moments with a
piece of rope, which he had, I suppose, previously noticed
there.</p>
<p>"'You'd feel a little bit more comfortable if I tie your feet
down too, eh?' he sneered; and, to my horror, he put a loop of rope
round my right leg, drew it underneath the inner rail, and then
made the end fast to my left ankle, above the rail. I was thus
fixed right across the track, and escape from a hideous death
seemed impossible. But the villain had not finished yet.</p>
<p>"'There's just a chance that you might call out,' he said, 'so
I'll tie your mouth up. You can say your prayers just as well with
it shut as open, and the sooner you say them the better, for you
never needed to more.'</p>
<p>"He stuffed part of my handkerchief into my mouth and tied it
round with another bit of rope. Then he proceeded to rifle my
pockets.</p>
<p>"'Got any loose cash about you? That's right. I'll take care of
it, for it won't do <i>you</i> any good now, I reckon, and you'll
have the dying satisfaction of having helped me to get off to
London. And now, you skunk of a warder, good-night! I told you I'd
be the death of you one day, but, by Heaven, I never hoped for such
a paying-off of old scores as this. Remember, you'll see the
head-lights of the engine coming towards you&mdash;you'll hear the
roar of the train that's going to squash you. It's a good revenge,
isn't it? I'd stay here and see the end of it if I could, only I've
no time to spare, so now good-night, Warder Davis, curse you!'</p>
<p>"And with a brutal kick at my defenceless body he started off in
the direction of Westmoor. I could see his bulky form for a moment
or two in the dim light, and could hear for several minutes the
tread of his feet crunching the gravel on the permanent way. I had
no doubt in my mind that he had been making for Westmoor
previously, and had used the old platelayer's hut as a hiding-place
until it was about time to take a chance of getting on one of the
up trains.</p>
<p>"My situation was a truly awful one. He was quite right about
the down express: it was timed to run through Westmoor just about
eleven o'clock. It was past ten now, so that there was not an hour
between me and a hideous death. I lay still for some minutes and
tried to compose my mind to think a little. Was there anything I
could do? Yes! With an effort I might manage to remove the gag. I
pushed my head as far as it would go over the metals, and to my joy
was able to undo the knots with my chained hands and to get the
handkerchief out of my mouth. This was a relief, certainly, but
only a very small one, for it soon dawned upon me that if I yelled
my loudest there would be no one within hearing on the lonely moor
through which the track ran. To get my hands free was impossible,
but there might be a chance for my feet. I began to kick them
about, and discovered that the wretch had simply passed the rope
between my ankles once round the rail, so that by alternately
kicking and pulling with each foot I could draw it backward and
forward against the rail. With the energy of despair I began to
work with all my might to fray the rope against the rail, and so
set my feet free.</p>
<p>"I must have kicked away for over half an hour&mdash;kicked and
pulled till I was stiff and in agony, and still the rope held, but
I could <i>feel</i> it rubbing away and getting thinner, and I
tried to work it so that the friction took place where the rail
rested in the 'chair' on the sleeper, so as to have a sharp corner
to cut. Fiercely I struggled to get free, but the rope was a strong
one, and it seemed as if it would hold for ever.</p>
<p>"A whistle! Hardly discernible in the distance, but still I knew
what it meant. The down express was running through Westmoor
Station. A fresh struggle&mdash;and <i>still</i> the rope held.
Then came an ominous rumble in the distance, and there, half a mile
away up the straight bit of track, I could see the glimmer of the
engine's head-light. A desperate pull! I hung on to the outer rails
with both hands, and pulled with arms and legs like a man on the
rack of old&mdash;every muscle of the body was strained with the
fearful tension. Snap! The rope broke and my feet were free.</p>
<p>"There was not a moment to lose; the train was little over a
quarter of a mile away, and in twenty seconds it would be on me.
But a desperate man can do a lot in that time. With a quick
movement I rolled over to the outside of the track, so that my
<i>left</i> arm came under the rail. Then I threw myself at full
length parallel to the track, feet towards the approaching train,
and as far from the rail as possible. At the same moment I drew
down my hands on either side of the rail so that the short chain
between the steel wristlets was on the top of the rail, the centre
being on the inner top edge of the rail where the wheels would
strike.</p>
<p>"With a roar the train was on me. I expected to have one of my
hands cut off, and there came a sharp thrill of pain to both wrists
as the leading wheel of the engine struck the chain, while the
thought flashed across me that I might not be far enough from the
rail to escape being struck in my body.</p>
<p>"The passing of that awful train seemed to be an hour. Wheel
after wheel ran close to my face with a hideous clatter&mdash;until
the momentary red glare of the taillight and a big rush of air told
me that the danger had passed. For about five minutes I lay
perfectly still, and not till then did I discover that my hands
were falling further apart.</p>
<p>"Scarcely daring to hope, I drew them slowly towards me. Yes! I
was free! The heavy train had snapped the swivel-link that joined
the handcuffs, and with the exception of a severe bruising in my
wrists, I was perfectly uninjured.</p>
<p>"Well, to make a long story short, sir, I toddled to my feet
with the most profound feeling of gratitude to Providence that I
had ever experienced. And then, weak and nerve-shattered as I was,
there came upon me the intense desire to recapture the brute who
had condemned me to such an awful death. My rifle was still with
me, and uninjured; so, as well as I could, I set forth in the
direction of Westmoor, starting in fright after I had gone a short
distance at the noise of a heavy goods train, that rumbled past me
on the up track.</p>
<p>"When I got to the station, the platform and offices were
closed, but this same goods train was being shunted in the yard,
preparatory to making a fresh start on its journey towards London.
Two or three trucks, covered with tarpaulins, were detached, and I
fancied I caught a glimpse of a dark figure crouching beside one of
them.</p>
<p>"I stopped and watched, smiling to myself as I saw No. 36 climb
into the truck, and disappear beneath the tarpaulin. Then I went
quietly to the brakesman and explained matters. He, the driver of
the engine, a couple of shunters, and myself surrounded the truck,
and in a few minutes No. 36 found himself brought to bay, with the
man whom he had thought dead presenting his rifle within a foot of
him. He saw the game was over and gave in, and that's the end of
the yarn.</p>
<p>"Yes, of course, he was pretty severely punished, but that
didn't compensate me for my terrible experience; and now perhaps
you don't wonder why I should give a bit of a shudder when an
express train passes me in the dark!"</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>IN THE ROCKHURST TUNNEL: THE
GANGER'S STORY</h2>
<p>"Well, sir," said the railway ganger, as he slowly lit the short
clay pipe so dear to an English labourer's mouth, "I'll tell you
the tale, as you seem bent on hearing it. It was hushed up at the
time, d'ye see? but I suppose there ain't any particular harm in
letting it become public after all these years.</p>
<p>"I was just an ordinary platelayer on the Mid-Northern Railway
when it happened. It was in the Rockhurst Tunnel, and the Royal
special was&mdash;, but there! I'd better start at the beginning
and make a few explanations, or you won't get the hang of the
thing."</p>
<p>So we sat down together by the side of the line. He had only
just come off duty and had asked me for a light just as I strolled
over the level crossing. A railwayman of any grade is always worth
talking to, and one thing had led to another until the man had
dropped a hint that he had a story to tell. That settled it, and
here is the ganger's tale.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>"When the King or some other person of the Royal Family takes a
little run over the line, it ain't a question of just buying a
ticket at one end and giving it up at the other, like you or me
does. There's all sorts of things to be arranged by the Company
beforehand, and when the Royal special's run, a lot of trouble that
most people don't dream of is taken, so that nothing shall fall
foul of it. Orders are given all along the line for shunting other
trains into sidings to let it pass, and on a busy bit of the road
this ain't no joke for the traffic super. to arrange.</p>
<p>"A pilot engine is run light'&mdash;that's by itself&mdash;a
quarter of an hour ahead of the train, and nothing's allowed on the
metals between the two. Every station-master gets his special
instructions, not only for use at the stations themselves, but
orders for the protection of every inch of the line.</p>
<p>"At every bridge under or over which the train is to run, at
every level crossing, at all 'facing points' and junctions, in
every tunnel, a man is stationed long before the Royal train is
timed to pass. It is his duty to see that the line is clear, that
no suspicious persons are loitering about, and generally to act as
sentinel over the Royal safety. Most of these men detailed for
special duty are drawn from the permanent way gang. Many a time
I've held the green flag when Queen Victoria (God bless her
memory!) was a-rushing by, and though she didn't see me I felt as
proud as though I'd been a sentry guarding her at Windsor
Castle.</p>
<p>"The gang I was working in at the time I'm telling you of knew
there was going to be a Royal journey on the London and
Mid-Northern, and one morning just as we were going to begin work
our ganger told us that the special was to run that afternoon, and
that he'd got his orders from the stationmaster in our district for
placing the men.</p>
<p>"All that morning we spent in overhauling the five miles of down
metals that belonged to our gang. Keys were driven in more firmly
between the chairs and rails, fish-plate bolts were tested and the
spanner clapped on to all loose nuts to tighten them, and
everything was done to make the permanent way as safe as
possible.</p>
<p>"'Jackson, Holloway and Stone,' said our ganger, 'you're told
off for the Rockhurst Tunnel. You take the south end, Jackson; you
the north, Stone; and,' turning to me, 'you'll be in the middle,
Holloway.'</p>
<p>"'All right,' I answered.</p>
<p>"'Don't forget your lamp, Holloway,' he went on, 'and be sure
you've got enough oil in it. You'd better be in your place before
two. The pilot's timed to run through at 2.55.'</p>
<p>"Now, of course, you've heard of the Rockhurst Tunnel. It's just
over a mile long, and runs under as wild a bit of moorland as you'd
find in a day's march. There's a signal box in the cutting at each
end, so the tunnel is a 'block' in itself. It's not quite straight
through; there's a slight curve just at the centre, but by standing
on the outer side of this curve you can see the spot of
daylight&mdash;for it's only a spot&mdash;at each end. I knew every
inch of the tunnel. Many a long day I'd spent in it, working by the
light of naphtha lamps, and it was only natural that I should stand
a chance of being placed on guard in it.</p>
<p>"I remember well how I chuckled over what seemed to me an easy
afternoon's job&mdash;just a spell of rest. Folks know little of
the work of the P.W. men. The passenger, as he rushes by and
glances at a group of chaps leaning on their shovels and picks,
doesn't realise that the very rail he's running over has very
likely only been keyed into its place five minutes before. He
growls at the slowness of his journey when 'reduced speed' is
ordered for a P.W. job, little thinking that tons of heavy ballast
must be shovelled in and levelled by the despised platelayer before
it will be safe to run at sixty miles an hour again. And there's
dangers in the life, too, not only from the running of the trains,
and fools pitching empty bottles out of windows, and fogs and such
like, but lots of other things that you never dream of, sir.</p>
<p>"I had my foot jammed in a facing point once, when it was being
closed; lucky for me, the signalman heard me shout in time, or I'd
only have troubled the shoemaker for one boot for the rest of my
life. This scar on my cheek was cut by a bit of a detonator that
flew off the rail when the engine struck it, and it might have cost
me an eye. And my teeth&mdash;but there, that reminds me, I'm
getting clean away from my yarn.</p>
<p>"Well, about a quarter to two, carrying an ordinary railway lamp
with a green and red shade to it, and a few detonators, or fog
signals, in my pocket in case of accident, I walked through the
tunnel from the south end till I reached the centre. It was pitch
dark, of course, except for just a dim spot of light that shone
over the rails; for just above was a ventilating shaft opening into
the moorland.</p>
<p>"Very soon after I'd got to my place the ganger himself came
through, making a last examination By his doing this it was
impossible that anyone else could be in the tunnel.</p>
<p>"Now, I must tell you exactly what my duties were. They were
very simple. Of course, I had to know that the line was perfectly
clear ahead. The green lamp that Stone, at the north end, had,
would show me this. When the pilot engine entered the south end I
was to show a green light towards the driver, and also to wave it
in the other direction, so that Stone could see that all was right.
Exactly the same precautions were to be observed when the special
itself came along. In case of anything wrong happening, I was to
show the red light, of course.</p>
<p>"It must have been nearly half-past two. I was standing a few
yards away from under the air shaft when I was startled by hearing
a noise. I turned round to see what was up, and I tell you my heart
gave a sort of jump when I saw the figure of a man close by, while
another one seemed to be dropping from the roof of the tunnel.</p>
<p>"'Hullo, what are you doing here?' I said, pulling myself
together as well as I could.</p>
<p>"'Look sharp, Bill, drop! Here's our man&mdash;right under our
very nose!' cried the fellow I had seen.</p>
<p>"I saw something was up, and turned the red shade on to my lamp,
hurrying to the side of the tunnel as I did so.</p>
<p>"'Ah, would you?' shouted the man. I saw him lift up his arm,
and the next moment I felt a heavy blow on my head, and staggered
forward.</p>
<p>"'Quick, Bill, or they'll see the red light. Down with him!'</p>
<p>"The other man had now come up, and the two, springing at me,
bore me down to the ground between the metals. I still held the
lamp, but it was wrenched out of my hand and the green shade turned
on once more.</p>
<p>"Got the cord, Bill?' asked the first speaker.</p>
<p>"'Here it is,' said the other. 'You hold him down and I'll make
short work of him.'</p>
<p>"In five minutes they had lashed my arms closely to my sides,
cutting my wrists almost to the bone, and bound my legs firmly
together.</p>
<p>"'What&mdash;what are you going to do with me?' I asked.</p>
<p>"'You'll soon see, my friend,' said the man who had spoken
first. 'You never expected visitors, eh? But angels drop from the
sky sometimes, and we just slung a rope from the airshaft overhead
and came down it, see? Pity your people don't take more pains when
they have Royal passengers.'</p>
<p>"'There was a man there&mdash;' I began.</p>
<p>"'A clumsy youth, yes! He's in the same case as you now. Listen;
we won't kill you outright, because you've not done us any damage,
but we'll give you a chance of seeing one of the biggest railway
accidents known, and of telling your friends about it&mdash;if
you're lucky enough to escape yourself, which I doubt.'</p>
<p>"For God's sake, what are you going to do?' I cried. 'Do you
know <i>who</i> is travelling? Do you know?'</p>
<p>"'Exactly; that's why we're here. You don't suppose we should
have taken so much trouble over an ordinary train, do you? But
there isn't any time to waste on you. The pilot engine will be
through directly. Hurry up with that bag, Bill. Stow it safely and
fix the end of the rope to the up side of the tunnel till we want
it again. That's right. Now help me lift this fellow into the
manhole in the wall and stick by him there while I work the pilot
through. Clap your hand over his mouth if he tries to shout.
Afterwards he can yell as much as he likes.'</p>
<p>"They put me into the manhole, propping me up against the sides
of the wall. I tell you, I was in a 'blue funk.' I'd guessed pretty
well the meaning of the thing. They were a couple of Anarchists,
and they meant to wreck the Royal train in the middle of the
tunnel. And I couldn't prevent it, for they'd planned it too
well.</p>
<p>"Presently I heard a roar from the South end of the tunnel. The
pilot engine was coming through. The man who had charge over me
laid his hand on my mouth, but I could see what the other was
doing. He was holding the green light towards the engine, every now
and then turning to wave it in the opposite direction, so that my
mate at the other end of the tunnel would think that all was
right.</p>
<p>"With a rattle and a roar the pilot engine ran past us. Then the
man with the lamp drew a hammer from his pocket and drove a nail in
the wall of the tunnel as high as he could reach, hanging the lamp
on it, green light towards the south.</p>
<p>"You can't reach <i>that</i> to <i>blow</i> it out,' he said to
me with a nasty, chuckling laugh. 'And now we're going to fix a
pretty little fog-signal of a patent pattern on to the rails. It's
warranted to stop any train!'</p>
<p>"And in the dim light from the shaft I saw them draw something
out of a bag, and carefully fix it on to the metals, using some
tools as they did so.</p>
<p>"'There,' said the brute when they had done, 'I think that'll
settle matters. Quick, Bill! We've not a moment to lose. The train
will be through in five minutes or so. Up you get! Good-bye, my
friend,' he shouted to me as the other man started climbing up the
rope, 'There's an exciting time before you!'</p>
<p>"And then he disappeared, leaving me alone in the tunnel. It was
about as ugly a fix as a chap could be in, and you can fancy I felt
pretty queer. But even before they went there came to me just a
glimmering of an idea, faint as the spot of daylight under the
shaft, but a dying man will clutch at a straw, they say, and I was
in the same sort of case. Besides, it wasn't only my own life I was
thinking of.</p>
<p>"I told you they'd put me, propped up against the wall, in an
upright position. Bound hand and foot as I was, in that position
lay my last chance. I might yet save the Royal train.</p>
<p>"If only I could get across to the other side of the tunnel,
between which and me lay a double set of metals!</p>
<p>"Why? I'll tell you. The Anarchists didn't know, and perhaps you
don't either, that the safety of that tunnel didn't only depend on
my showing a green light. The Rockhurst Tunnel, like several other
long ones in England, such as the 'Box' and the 'Severn,' on the
Great Western Railway, is fitted with a special apparatus for
giving an alarm signal in case of danger or accident.</p>
<p>"This apparatus is a very simple one; a telegraph wire is fixed
in the tunnel and connected with a 'tell-tale' bell in the signal
boxes at each end in such a way that if the wire is broken the
bells start ringing at once and give the alarm. Then each signalman
knows that something is up in the tunnel, and can put his signals
against all trains and prevent them coming in.</p>
<p>"This wire, which is a thin one, so that you can easily break
it, is fixed to the wall of the tunnel on the up side of the line,
about five feet from the ground. I remembered this, and I knew if I
could only break it in time the signalman in the box at the south
end would never let the Royal train pass without an examination of
the whole tunnel.</p>
<p>"As I say, I was tied up. Still, a sort of plan came before me,
and I determined to have a good try at it. I was upright, and I
felt I might be able to move by short jumps. The worst thing I had
before me was the getting over the four rails, for, if I fell down,
I knew it would be pretty difficult to get up again.</p>
<p>"I gave one or two hopping jumps forward, very carefully, till I
felt my shins against the first rail. Then I pulled myself
together, jumped as high as I could, and lurched myself forward. It
was a narrow squeak. I felt the heels of my boots just touch the
inner edge of the rail, but down I came safely on the other side. A
few more jumps and another effort brought me into the 'six-foot
way.' Half the battle was over. Then I jumped the third rail and
only one was left.</p>
<p>"Whether I was nervous, or over confident like, I don't know,
but when I tried to jump that last rail my toe caught in the top of
it and sent me lunching forward. My shoulder came an awful bang
against the wall of the tunnel, but, luckily, my feet had landed on
the ground, and I felt myself sort of propped up in a slanting
position against the wall. I managed to get myself upright, and
then came the nastiest job of the lot.</p>
<p>"I felt against the wall with my face till my nose touched the
signal wire. Then I grasped it&mdash;<i>with my teeth</i>.</p>
<p>"Talk about a dentist, sir! It wasn't in it. I bit hard on the
wire, and pulled and strained with all my might to break it I
thought I never should have stood the pain long enough, but at last
the wire snapped, and, at the same time, out flew three of my
teeth, torn out of the gums. I was pretty well done up, I can tell
you, and had to lean against the wall.</p>
<p>"It might have been a minute or an hour I waited, for all I
knew, but anyhow I heard, after a bit, a long whistle from the
south end of the tunnel. Then came silence, and I knew the train
had stopped.</p>
<p>"A long time seemed to pass, and then I heard voices and saw
three or four white lights coming through the darkness.</p>
<p>"'Here's his green light, all right,' said someone.</p>
<p>"'Here I am,' I shouted. 'Look out how you come forward.'</p>
<p>"'What's the matter, my man?'</p>
<p>"'There's something on the line under the air shaft. Take care
how you touch it.'</p>
<p>"'Why, he's tied up, and covered with blood,' cried one of the
party, as he flashed his lantern on to me, 'whatever's happened?
Are you hurt?'</p>
<p>"'Not much sir. Only a tooth or two gone,' I answered.</p>
<p>"It was the loco. super., who had been travelling on the
footplate of the Royal engine. With him was a guard, and a couple
of officials who had special charge of the train. A penknife soon
set me free, and I told them what had happened.</p>
<p>"Then we went up to the thing that had been fixed to the line,
screwed on by a bolt passing underneath the rail, so that I could
have done nothing <i>there</i> with my teeth.</p>
<p>"'Great heavens!' gasped the loco. super., as he stooped down
with his lamp, 'A couple of dynamite cartridges! My man you have
saved the Royal train; but for goodness sake keep your mouth
shut.'</p>
<p>"Well, the result was that they examined the tunnel from end to
end, and then the Royal train was allowed to run slowly
through.</p>
<p>"A few days later, I 'trod the carpet' in the general manager's
room. He thanked me for what I had done and asked me to keep the
whole thing to myself&mdash;for the sake of the Company, I
expect&mdash;and ended by giving me an envelope with a nice little
sum in bank notes.</p>
<p>"'Also,' he said, 'you'd better go to a dentist's and get some
false teeth put into those gaps. You can send in the bill to the
Company.'"</p>

<h2><a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a>A WARNING IN RED: THE STORY OF A
RAILWAY MYSTERY</h2>
<p align="center"><b>[by VICTOR L. WHITECHURCH AND E.
CONWAY]</b></p>
<p>"Yes," said the Colonel, as he lit another cheroot, "many a man
when he is in action is simply mad for the time being, and fights
like a demon because he sees red."</p>
<p>"Sees red?" I asked, with a start.</p>
<p>"Don't you know what I mean?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Ah, it's a curious psychological problem that I've experienced
myself. I was leading a cavalry charge at Joonpore, and suddenly
the enemy, the country, everything seemed to fade away into a
blood-red mist that blinded me with colour&mdash;I could see
nothing else. And then the mad desire came upon me to slash and
slay. They told me afterwards that I behaved like a fury, and I can
believe it, for I've seen many a man in the same condition. It only
comes in battle, I believe. That's the only time you can see
red.&mdash;</p>
<p>"Are you sure?"</p>
<p>"Yes. But what's the matter, Forbes? You look completely
startled."</p>
<p>"Oh, it's nothing," I replied, "only a fanciful presentiment I
had when I arrived this evening, and you put me in mind of it."</p>
<p>"What! you don't mean to say you saw red," asked the Colonel,
with a laugh.</p>
<p>"Not in your sense of the word, Colonel; and you'll only laugh
at me if I tell you. It's a mere fancy, that's all."</p>
<p>"Well, drown your fancies in a whisky and soda, and then get a
good night's rest after your journey. That's the best thing for
you, Forbes. But if you like to tell me what's upset you I won't
laugh at you."</p>
<p>So in the end I told him about the strange effect I had
experienced in alighting at the station. I had come down from town
to spend a couple of days with Colonel Ward at Manningford.
Although I had known him for many years, and had often seen him at
his club, it was the first time I had ever been to stay at his
country house. He expected me by a late train, but judgment being
given in a case in which I was professionally engaged as solicitor
rather earlier than I had expected, I was able to get away from
town in the afternoon, and reached Manningford station about six
o'clock. I had not thought it worth while to wire, as I had
determined to take a trap if it was far to walk, and surprise
him.</p>
<p>Manningford was a tiny little country station, I was the only
passenger who alighted, and one solitary official, who seemed to
combine the offices of stationmaster, porter, and ticket-collector,
met me on the platform.</p>
<p>"Tickets, please," he said, gruffly.</p>
<p>I gave him my ticket. As I did so, the train in which I had been
travelling glided off the platform, and I caught a glimpse of the
red tail-light showing in the fading day.</p>
<p>Grasping my Gladstone bag, I was about to depart, when the idea
struck me that I would ask the stationmaster about a conveyance. He
had retired to his office and was standing at the ticket-issuing
window, which was open. He had lit the lamp inside, as the office
was rather dark.</p>
<p>"Can I get a cab anywhere?" I asked.</p>
<p>He looked up. He was a red-faced man with red hair, and the
strong light showed his colour vividly. In accordance with the
rules of the railway company he served, he was wearing a red
tie.</p>
<p>"No," he said, rather shortly. Perhaps I was staring a little
rudely at his illuminated countenance.</p>
<p>"But," I persisted, "surely there is some conveyance to be had
near, isn't there?"</p>
<p>"You can hire a dog-cart at the Star," he said.</p>
<p>"Where is that?"</p>
<p>"Cross the line and go out on the other Side of the station.
Turn to the right, and it's about five minutes' walk."</p>
<p>And he slammed down the window.</p>
<p>I went on to the platform once more, and slowly crossed the
line. I say slowly, because the <i>red</i> colour of my
surroundings began to grow upon me. The station itself was painted
a chocolate colour of a reddish tinge. The tiles bordering the
flower beds were of a deep red colour, enclosing for the most part
scarlet geraniums. Looking down the line I caught the crimson rays
of the setting sun reflected upon the rails, and glancing in the
opposite direction noticed that the red light on the up starting
signal was burning brightly. It was a strange, indescribable
sensation that attacked me, this predominance of blood-red
colouring; and I gave a little shiver as I walked to the inn, which
was a good quarter of a mile from the station, though apparently
the nearest house. A two-mile drive brought me to the Colonel's,
and after dinner his mention of "seeing red" recalled what had
happened.</p>
<p>"Well," said Colonel Ward, as he bid me good-night, "I won't
laugh at you, because I'll admit that we're none of us accountable
for peculiar brain sensations at times. Monk, the stationmaster,
isn't exactly a beauty to look at, is he? But he's a capital
official. You've been overworking yourself lately, Forbes, and you
must take things easy. Good-night, old chap. Pleasant dreams. I
hope your red sensation is not the preliminary to a nightmare."</p>
<p>The next morning, as we were sitting at breakfast, a servant
burst into the room with a very frightened expression, and told the
Colonel that a man wanted to see him at once. He was absent for
about a quarter of an hour, when he returned in great
agitation.</p>
<p>"Great heavens!" he exclaimed, "my poor friend Geoffrey
Anstruthers has been murdered&mdash;killed on the line when coming
down from town last night. Your blood-red impression had something
in it, perhaps, Forbes."</p>
<p>"Tell me about it, Colonel."</p>
<p>"I will. It's upset me dreadfully. Poor Anstruthers was my
nearest neighbour, living about a mile off in that big white house
you noticed between the station and my place. We were the greatest
of friends, for although he was a very peculiar man we got on
thoroughly. The poor fellow was to have met you at dinner here
tonight."</p>
<p>"How did it happen?"</p>
<p>"Well, they tell me his body was discovered by the side of the
line near Barton&mdash;about midway between London and Manningford.
A platelayer found it early this morning. There were marks of a
struggle and a couple of knife stabs, and he seems to have been
attacked and killed in the train and then thrown out."</p>
<p>"Have you any idea if there was a motive for the crime?" I
asked.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, yes," said the Colonel. "Poor Anstruthers was a
man of most eccentric habits, and one of his fads was that he would
bank nowhere but at the Bank of England, and that he would pay
nobody by cheque. He also settled all his accounts once a quarter
only, and the tradesman who asked for an earlier settlement, or the
servant or labourer who demanded monthly or weekly wages, was sure
to be dismissed by him. Regularly every quarter we went up to
London and drew several hundred pounds in gold out of the Bank of
England, bringing it back in an ordinary brief bag. I often warned
him that he was doing a very foolish thing, but he only laughed at
me.</p>
<p>"Yesterday he went up to town for this purpose. His servants
thought that as he had not returned last evening by his usual
train, which arrives at 10.15 p.m., he was staying the night in
town. But evidently some blackguard got hold of his movements. Poor
old Anstruthers!"</p>
<p>"Is anything being done yet?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I hardly know," said the Colonel; "I think his nearest
relations are abroad. At all events I'm the greatest friend he had,
and I'm going to take the matter up. I shall go to Barton by the
next train."</p>
<p>"I'll come with you," I said.</p>
<p>"That's very kind of you, Forbes; your assistance will be most
valuable, for I know your hobby&mdash;railways. It might help
us."</p>
<p>We finished our breakfast quickly and drove into the station. On
my way I asked the Colonel a few particulars concerning the train
by which Anstruthers had travelled the night before. It ran as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<pre>
London (dep.)       8 45 p.m.
Muggridge (stop)    9.10 p.m.
Barton (stop)       9 37 p.m.
Manningford (stop) 10.15 p.m.
Porthaven (arrive) 10.30 p.m.
</pre>
<p>So that the only stops between London and Manningford were
Muggridge and Barton. The body, so the Colonel had heard, had been
found about two miles on the London side of Barton.</p>
<p>The red-faced stationmaster was in his office when we arrived at
the station.</p>
<p>"Sad job this, Mr. Monk," said the Colonel.</p>
<p>"Terrible, sir. It regularly upset me when the down train
brought the news this morning. Poor Mr. Anstruthers! I knew him
well, sir. I'd seen him go up in the morning, and wondered why he
didn't come back by the 10.15 as usual. Are you going by the up
train?"</p>
<p>"Yes. We're going to Barton to inquire into this awful affair.
Two first returns, please."</p>
<p>The stationmaster reached to his rack for the tickets. Now, as
often happens in small country stations where the supply of tickets
to various stations on the line is limited and becomes exhausted,
he did a very common thing. Selecting two blank tickets he dipped
the pen into ink and wrote on their respective halves, "Manningford
to Barton," "Barton to Manningford," and the fare, 7s. 8d.</p>
<p>Then he passed them through the window and I took them up. He
had written the names in <i>red ink</i>!</p>
<p>"I hope they'll catch the wretches, sir," said the stationmaster
a few minutes afterwards, as he opened our carriage door for
us.</p>
<p>Arrived at Barton, we took a trap and drove to the scene of the
tragedy. The body, we were told, had been removed to an inn close
by the railway, but at my request we went first to the line, as I
was anxious to see the exact spot where Mr. Anstruthers had been
thrown out of the train. We found a local policeman and two
platelayers at the place, which was in a cutting. One of the latter
told us that he was the man who had discovered the body.</p>
<p>"He was lyin' just here, gentlemen," he said, pointing to the
six-foot way between the two lines of metals.</p>
<p>"Of course he was dead when you found him?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, but it's my opinion he wasn't altogether dead when
they threw him out."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"'Cause he seemed to have moved afterwards. One of his arms was
just restin' on the down rail."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"Well, sir, he couldn't ha' fallen like that in the first place,
cause the wheels o' the train would ha' cut his arm."</p>
<p>"Stop a minute," I said. "What time did you find him here?"</p>
<p>"'Tween three and four this mornin', sir."</p>
<p>"And he was thrown out about 9.30 the night before?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Was that train the last down one?"</p>
<p>"The last passenger train, sir."</p>
<p>"Was there a down goods train after that?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, between half-past one and two."</p>
<p>"Ah, then, why didn't that train crush his arm?"</p>
<p>The question staggered the platelayer and the policeman too.
They evidently hadn't thought of this.</p>
<p>"I s'pose 'e must ha' bin alive when the goods train passed, and
moved afterwards," said the platelayer presently, and the policeman
entered a note to that effect in his pocket-book.</p>
<p>"What are you driving at?" said the Colonel.</p>
<p>"Never mind yet," I answered. Then, turning to the platelayer
again, I said, "He was stabbed, wasn't he?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"In the chest, sir."</p>
<p>"Any bloodstains?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. He was wearin' a white weskit, and it was quite red
when I turned him over."</p>
<p>"He was lying on his back, then?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Well, where are the blood-marks on the stones here? Have you
cleared them up?"</p>
<p>"<i>There wasn't none</i>," said the man.</p>
<p>"Strange!" I murmured to myself, as we left the spot. "You'd
make a good detective, Forbes," said the Colonel.</p>
<p>"Not a bit of it," I replied. "It's simply because there is a
mystery connected with my hobby&mdash;railways. That's what makes
me a little extra sharp."</p>
<p>"A <i>mystery?</i>" said the Colonel.</p>
<p>"Yes," I replied, "more than you think. But now let's see the
poor fellow."</p>
<p>Mr. Anstruthers was lying on a bed at the inn, just as they had
found him. The neighbouring police inspector was there, very
imposing and important. The Colonel gave his card, and we were
allowed to see the body.</p>
<p>It was a gruesome sight, and my friend turned away to ask some
questions of the inspector. I looked at the dead man carefully.
There were signs of a struggle. His clothes were torn, and one of
his hands was tightly clenched. Then I saw what, apparently, the
wily country police had passed undiscovered&mdash;a shred of paper
clasped in his hand. Without exciting the inspector's attention, I
wrested the fingers open and drew from them a tiny scrap of torn
paper, evidently clutched by a dying hand. It bore the following in
writing:&mdash;"ord&mdash;on." It was such a tiny scrap, such an
insignificant thing to go upon, but I slipped it into my
pocket-book nevertheless.</p>
<p>"Come," said the Colonel, "I can't stand this any longer. Well,
inspector, I hope you'll get the villain."</p>
<p>"Ah, we're on the track," said the officer, sagaciously. "They
got out at Barton, that's about it; and we'll have 'em yet."</p>
<p>"Do you want to see anything else, Forbes?" asked the
Colonel.</p>
<p>"Yes. I should like to see the doctor who examined the
body."</p>
<p>"It's Dr. Moore," said the policeman. "He lives at Barton."</p>
<p>So we called on Dr. Moore on our way to the station. He declared
that he had seen poor Anstruthers at six o'clock in the morning,
and was positively certain that he must then have been dead
<i>seven or eight hours</i>. The mystery was thickening.</p>
<p>Passing on to the platform at Barton, we had to show our
tickets. As I took mine back I gazed at it in a listless sort of
way, when suddenly I gave a start. The last three letters of
"Manningford"&mdash;where had I seen them? That peculiar elongated
"o" and the curiously tailed "d"&mdash;Ah! I remembered!</p>
<p>Hastily I drew the scrap of paper from my pocket-book, and
compared it with the ticket. The "ord" was in the same handwriting!
It was part of the words "Manningford station."</p>
<p>In a moment a clue flashed across my mind, and I searched for a
porter.</p>
<p>"Is there any official about the station with whom I can have a
word? It's about an urgent matter."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir; Mr. Smart, the district superintendent is here; he
came down about that murder. You'll find him in the stationmaster's
office."</p>
<p>"Come with me, Colonel," I cried, turning to the office. Hastily
I introduced myself to Mr. Smart, telling him my errand was
connected with the murder.</p>
<p>"Tell me," I asked, "is there any train from Manningford to
London after 10.15?"</p>
<p>"Only a goods," he said.</p>
<p>"Exactly. What time does it leave Manningford?"</p>
<p>"About midnight."</p>
<p>"And Barton?"</p>
<p>"It stops here for shunting. Generally starts on about 1.45
a.m."</p>
<p>"Mr. Smart, can you lay your hand on the men who worked that
train last night?"</p>
<p>He consulted some return sheets.</p>
<p>"Driver Power and fireman Hussey," he murmured. "They're on the
Slinford branch to-day&mdash;they don't often run on the main
line&mdash;and brakesman Sutton. He works a goods back to Porthaven
to-day. He'll arrive there in half an hour."</p>
<p>"Does he always work main line trains?"</p>
<p>"For several months past he has."</p>
<p>"He's the man then, Mr. Smart. It's of the utmost importance
that you should wire to Porthaven to have him closely watched. I'll
explain presently."</p>
<p>The district superintendent hastily scribbled a line on an
official telegraph form and rushed out with it. When he returned I
said&mdash;"Have you any of the company's detectives at hand?"</p>
<p>"Yes, two," he answered.</p>
<p>"Bring them then, and come along."</p>
<p>"My dear fellow," said the Colonel, who had been patiently
silent up to this point, "<i>what</i> does it all mean?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the superintendent, "I'm in a fog."</p>
<p>"I hear the down train coming in," I cried. "We must all return
to Manningford&mdash;quick, sir&mdash;I'll explain everything in
the train." A few minutes, and the Colonel, the superintendent, and
his two detectives and myself were in the train bound for
Manningford. "Now, sir?" said Mr. Smart.</p>
<p>"Well," I replied, "we're going to arrest the murderers, or one
of them I think, at all events."</p>
<p>"And who's that?"</p>
<p>"Monk, the stationmaster at Manningford," I answered.</p>
<p>"<i>Monk?</i> Impossible. Why, the murder occurred forty miles
away."</p>
<p>"No," I replied, "it occurred at Manningford station last night
shortly after 10.15. Listen. Poor Anstruthers came down from town,
got out of the train, and was done to death by the stationmaster,
<i>who was alone on the station</i>, for the sake of his money. In
the struggle the murdered man clutched a letter that Monk had
written and was probably carrying in his breast pocket. This scrap
of it I found in his hand just now. It is in Monk's handwriting.
Look!" and I compared it with the ticket.</p>
<p>"But how about the body being found where it was?" asked the
Colonel.</p>
<p>"It was taken there afterwards, probably in Sutton's brake van,
and thrown out. This would account for two facts: first, that no
blood was found on the permanent way, although Anstruthers had
bled; and, secondly, that his arm was lying on the down rail. The
down goods had passed before he was thrown from the up goods brake
van. That's my theory, gentlemen. Here we are at Manningford, and
the least you can do is to arrest the stationmaster on
suspicion."</p>
<p>The latter was on the platform when we arrived. I noticed he
gave a start as he saw so many of us get out of the train. The
superintendent went up to him.</p>
<p>"Mr. Monk," he said, "a very painful duty brings us here. These
two gentlemen are members of our police force, and they will have
to detain you on suspicion."</p>
<p>"Of what?" gasped Monk, his red face growing paler.</p>
<p>"Of participation in the murder of Mr. Anstruthers last
night."</p>
<p>"But he was killed in the train," said the stationmaster.</p>
<p>"That remains to be proved. At all events we are going to detain
you, and to search your house."</p>
<p>"I won't submit to it," began the man; but he subsided when a
pair of handcuffs were slipped over his wrists. Then we all
repaired to his little house, just across the road. Again he proved
turbulent, but it was no use. With skeleton keys one of the
detectives opened a box in his bedroom.</p>
<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, as he drew out a brief bag, "this seems
rather heavy. No wonder. It's full of money."</p>
<p>"That's Anstruthers' bag," exclaimed the Colonel.</p>
<p>The wretched man saw the game was up, but, wretch that he was,
he exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>"It's not me&mdash;it's Sutton&mdash;the brakesman of the up
goods train. He had as much to do with it as I did. He took the
body away; and he's got a lot of the gold."</p>
<p>"All right," said the superintendent, "we're seeing after him.
You have to thank this gentleman," pointing to myself, "for
unravelling the mystery."</p>
<p>"Curse you!" yelled the stationmaster at me.</p>
<p>Sutton turned against Monk, and between the two of them the
whole story came out. Monk's accounts were short, and he owed money
all round&mdash;the usual story&mdash;racing. He had half planned
to murder Anstruthers several times, and at last the opportunity
presented itself. He was the only passenger to alight that night,
and Monk noticed that the guard had not observed him. So he asked
him to step into his office for a moment under pretence of
something, and then went for him. There was a struggle, but Monk
was the stronger man. In this struggle Anstruthers hid grasped the
bit of paper, but without the other's knowledge.</p>
<p>Then came the disposal of the body. Sutton was a man of doubtful
character, and Monk knew enough about him to ruin him if he
disclosed certain cases of goods stealing. So, when the goods train
came along, he gave Sutton twenty pounds, and promised him another
thirty to take the body in his van and pitch it out so that people
would think Anstruthers had been murdered in the train. It was the
easiest thing possible on a dark night to halt the train with the
brake van opposite Monk's office, and to slip the body in without
driver or fireman knowing anything about it.</p>
<p>The sequel was the gallows for Monk, and fifteen years at
Dartmoor for Sutton.</p>
<p>"There was something uncanny after all, Forbes," said the
Colonel, after dinner on that eventful day, "about your blood-red
impression of Manningford station and its master!"</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a>A JUMP FOR FREEDOM: AN
ENGINE-DRIVER'S STORY</h2>
<p>Steady lot, us drivers? Well, we have to be, there's no choice
in the matter. Driving wants a clear head, and a man who can make
up his mind what to do in a moment. The majority of people don't
half realize the work there is to do, or the responsibilities of
the "foot-plate."</p>
<p>I often think, myself, the difference there is between us chaps
and the captain of a Channel-boat. I used to think of it more when
I was on the "Sou'-Western," running the Continental train to
Southampton. Maybe I had a couple of hundred lives in tow; but I'll
venture to say very few of them thought of the man who had them and
the train in sole charge, for though the fireman's along with you,
the driver is responsible for everything, including him. Yet when
the passengers stepped aboard the Channel-boat, if they got a
glimpse of the captain they'd look at him with a kind of awe.</p>
<p>I don't say all this out of jealousy, but I've often thought if
we had a uniform, with gold lace round our caps and collars and an
engine worked on our shoulders, folks who were going a long journey
would think more of us, and say: "That's our driver," just as you
hear them remark "That's our captain."</p>
<p>Still, as I say, I wouldn't change. There's a charm about the
"foot-plate" and a pride in your engine that only a driver knows.
Why, I've seen men get quite affectionate over a favourite engine,
and almost cry when they were changed to another. Adventures? Well,
the life's full of adventures, more or less; not very interesting
to the general public, perhaps, but exciting enough to us. Stop,
though. I can tell you one adventure I had years ago, which will
interest you&mdash;about the most remarkable thing that ever
happened to me, and about as curious an affair as you could find in
the history of the line, I reckon. It was when I was on the
Sou'-Western, and before I became a regular express driver.</p>
<p>Before you can quite understand it, I must tell you something
about the line itself. From Clapham Junction to Hampton Court there
are four lines of rails, two of them used for up and down "fast"
trains, and the others for up and down "slow." You have the same
sort of thing on some of the other lines: the London and
North-Western, for instance, has four lines as far as Roade, beyond
Bletchley, only they are worked differently to the
South-Western.</p>
<p>The London and North-Western run their up and down fast trains
on the two left-hand lines of rails from Euston, and the up and
down slow on the two right-hand, so that, when two trains are going
in the same direction, there is always a line of metals between
them. But from Clapham to Hampton Court Junction the outer
left-hand rail is used for slow, and the next to it, the inner
left-hand, for fast, the outer right and inner right being used for
up-slow and fast respectively. The "up-slow" extends all the way to
Woking, but this has nothing to do with my story.</p>
<p>Thus, you see, if one train passes another going in the same
direction, the trains are close together. Sometimes I have known
two trains travel alongside each other at the same rate for two or
three minutes, and more than once I have spoken from my engine to
the driver of another train, and given or received a bit of 'batty
when we were going at the rate of forty or fifty miles an hour.</p>
<p>The Northern system is generally considered to be the better of
the two, but the South-Western still stick to the other plan.</p>
<p>One day, in the winter of 188-, there had been a special cheap
excursion from Portsmouth to Waterloo: I forget what the occasion
was; but, anyhow, I was detailed on duty to take this train back to
Portsmouth.</p>
<p>We were to start at 9.27, and as far as Hampton Court Junction
to run on the outer, or slow, line. The last train before us was
the nine o'clock, so you see we expected a clear run. We were not
to stop anywhere before reaching Portsmouth.</p>
<p>The train was a heavy one, as a good number of people had taken
advantage of the excursion, and it seemed that we should hardly get
off to time. As a matter of fact, however, we were only two minutes
late in starting, and were soon bowling away merrily towards the
south.</p>
<p>The boat-express to Southampton leaves Waterloo at 9.35, and
runs from there to Basingstoke without a stop, travelling to
Hampton Court Junction on the fast line. We had just passed Rayne's
Park when I heard the approaching roar of the express coming down
behind us. We were travelling a good forty miles an hour at the
time, and the other train began to pass ours very slowly. Presently
the express engine was alongside ours, and the driver sang out a
cheery "What ho! mate," as the two "cabs" came together. Creeping
gradually past us, the carriages of the boat-train became visible,
and as I glanced at them I could distinguish the passengers
plainly. Five coaches had already passed us, when I stood well on
the left-hand side of the foot-plate, furthest from the other
train, to allow my fireman to perform his office.</p>
<p>At this moment my engine put on a little spurt, and the two
trains were running almost exactly at the same pace, the other just
slightly gaining. I happened to glance over my shoulder, when, to
my astonishment, I saw a man in the other train deliberately
opening the door of his compartment, which was just drawing
opposite to the "cab" of my engine. Before I could recover from my
surprise he had stepped out on the footboard of the carriage, and
in another second he sprang upon the foot-plate of my engine,
clutching at the rail on the cab, while the door of the carriage he
had left, obeying the motion of the train, shut with a slam.</p>
<p>In an agony of terror, my mate and I seized him and dragged him
into a position of safety, while the other train spurted forward
and passed us. For a moment or two neither of us spoke. I was the
first to recover my presence of mind, and the habit of duty
mastered my curiosity for the instant.</p>
<p>"Hold on here," I shouted. "Jim fire her up, man; wait till we
get through Woking&mdash;then we'll see to him. Steady, sir! Keep
over in that corner, please, and thank Providence you're not a dead
man."</p>
<p>"Mad, I should think," said my fireman, as he set to work again
shovelling on the coals, while I riveted my attention to the mass
of red and green lights we were ever and anon approaching and
passing.</p>
<p>At Hampton Court Junction we were switched on to the "fast"
line, following the boat-express by about six minutes, and in half
an hour or so we were through Woking, and then I turned to the
stranger. He was a young man, clean-shaven, and well-dressed;
deadly pale and trembling, clutching hard at the support. The
foot-plate's a bit shaky to a novice.</p>
<p>"Are you mad, sir? Do you know you've had a fearful escape?
What, in the name of all that's wonderful, do you mean by it?"</p>
<p>"N-no; I'm not mad. I&mdash;I was forced to do it."</p>
<p>"Forced to do it? Why, you were alone in the carriage, as far as
I could see."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, I know that. But I was desperate. I'll explain
everything."</p>
<p>"Wait a minute or two; I can't attend now. Tell me when we're
through Guildford."</p>
<p>How he started as we entered the Guildford tunnel just beyond
the station! I thought he'd fall at first, and my mate had to hold
on to him for a minute. When we were clear of the tunnel, I asked
him for his explanation.</p>
<p>"I wanted to escape," he said, "and it was the only way."</p>
<p>"Escape? Who from? The police, I suppose? Well, don't you think
you've done that, my friend."</p>
<p>"No, no, no! Not from the police. I'm not a criminal. Listen,
and I'll tell you. I've got mixed up with a terrible secret
society&mdash;a set of people composed of the very worst sort of
Anarchists&mdash;men of several nations. It would be too long a
story to tell you how I came to join it, but when once among such
people, there is no drawing back. We were pledged with the most
awful oaths to secrecy, and terrible penalties were ordained for
those who proved traitors. I would have given anything to set
myself free, but it was impossible.</p>
<p>"Well, one evening last week, we held a meeting to determine the
performance of an awful act. I can't tell you exactly the truth,
but I will go so far as to say it was the assassination of a
certain great personage on the Continent. We drew lots, in order
that the assassin might be chosen. The lot fell upon me. In vain I
begged to be excused, the others were relentless, and the president
said to me:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'George Felton, you have sworn obedience, and obey you must.
The lot has fallen upon you, and you must perform the deed. If you
refuse, or if you even hesitate, there is only one penalty, and
that you know. It is death, and it is useless for you to try to
escape from it. This is how you will proceed: Until Thursday you
will be carefully watched. The evening of that day you will take
the boat-train <i>via</i> Southampton and Havre for Paris. You will
travel by that route because it is the less frequented. You will go
absolutely alone, but every step you will be watched. The
"brethren" will be posted all along the line of route. At Waterloo
two of them will watch you into the train. At Basingstoke two
others will keep their eyes on you while the train is stopping
there. At Southampton you will be watched on board the boat, and
the same thing will happen at Havre and Rouen, your only
stopping-places. At Paris you will be met by two comrades, who will
keep you in view until the final arrangements have been made, when
you will be told how to act. So do not think to escape, as every
movement will be watched.'"</p>
<p>The train flew on; my mate and I were interested, as you may
well guess. He paused for a moment to allow of the engine being
coaled once more, then I said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"But you might have stopped the train by pulling the
communicator, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I'm coming to that. I had thought of trying to escape thus, but
just as the train moved out of the station a little note was thrown
in at the window by a 'comrade,' who had been watching me. I opened
it and read as follows: 'We never thought the other night that
perhaps you might try to escape by stopping the train <i>en
route</i> and jumping off. In case such an idea has entered your
head, you may as well know that the "brothers" are on the train.
You know what that means. You are helpless. Be brave for the sake
of the "cause."'"</p>
<p>"Have you got that letter?" said the fireman.</p>
<p>"No; I tore it up. Well, I tell you, I was desperate. I had half
made up my mind to jump and risk it, when we gradually began to
pass your train. I was alone in my compartment, and could see the
well-filled carriages close to me. I sat looking at them
mechanically, when the idea suddenly seized me, and I asked myself
the question, 'Why shouldn't I change trains?' By this time I was
opposite to the guard's van in the front, and there was not a
moment to be lost. It was too late to try for that when I opened
the door, and my only course was to jump on to your engine. Thank
God, I did so safely!"</p>
<p>"Aye, you've had a lucky escape, and you may well thank God.
Well, what's to be done now?"</p>
<p>"Where are you bound for?"</p>
<p>"Portsmouth."</p>
<p>"Do you stop anywhere first?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Well, look here. Can't I slip off on the outer side as we come
into the station?"</p>
<p>"I don't know so much about that. You've come on the footplate
uninvited, and you ought to give an account of it to the
authorities. If I let you get off without, I'm liable for a row
myself. Besides, how are we to know your story's true?"</p>
<p>"Before God I swear it's true. And no one need ever know I was
here. I'll make it well worth your while. Besides," he added,
piteously, "it's my only chance. When they know I've escaped
they'll search high and low. If this isn't kept quiet they'll know
about it before I have the start of them, and that means certain
death. I couldn't escape. As it is, I've got money enough to get
well out of the country before they know."</p>
<p>Well, it seemed rough enough on the poor chap, but my mate stuck
out against letting him go. I argued the matter out with him as
well as I could, and he was beginning to come round to my point of
view when I suddenly exclaimed:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Look out, mate, there's a block at Petersfield."</p>
<p>The distant signal was shining with a red light instead of a
green, and we put on the brakes until the train was almost at a
standstill.</p>
<p>"For God's sake, let me get off," begged the stranger.</p>
<p>My mate and I looked at one another. The train came to a stop
close to the signal.</p>
<p>"Don't refuse me. See here," and he held out five sovereigns and
literally pressed them into my hand. I looked at Jim again. He
nodded.</p>
<p>"All right, get off and keep quiet till we've gone on. Good luck
to you. Here, I don't want your money."</p>
<p>But he was gone in a moment. Then the semaphore arm fell with a
crash, the green light shone out, and we started once again; nor
did we stop till we had reached Portsmouth. Later on, my mate and I
talked the matter over between us, and agreed that we would not
mention it to anyone, as it was better for all that it should be
kept quiet. Then I offered him half the money.</p>
<p>"No," said he, "I won't take it. If his story's true, it's
something like the price of blood. They must have given him the
cash for his journey and expenses."</p>
<p>I hadn't seen it in that light.</p>
<p>"Well, mate, I believe you're right. I never thought of that. I
sha'n't touch it either, I couldn't bring myself to do it. But what
shall we do with it?"</p>
<p>Finally, we agreed to send it anonymously to a railway charity,
and the next morning we did so.</p>
<p>Two days after that, I was off duty, when the fireman came round
to my house, with a curious expression on his face and a newspaper
in his hand. "Read that," he said, quickly, pointing to a
paragraph. I read as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF A CRIMINAL.<br>
<br>
"On Thursday evening last, a strange occurrence, the facts of which
are unknown, must have taken place somewhere on the main line of
the South-Western Railway between Waterloo and Basingstoke. Our
readers will remember the case of embezzlement and forgery at the
head offices of the 'Amalgamated General European and Colonial
Exchange,' a forgery on a large scale, in which the under cashier,
Charles Winfield, a clever, and unfortunately well-trusted young
man, was deeply implicated. Winfield, by some means, managed to
escape arrest, and the police have been assiduously following his
track since. On the evening in question, Detective Baxter, of
Scotland Yard, recognised Winfield in a first-class compartment of
the 9.35 boat-train from Waterloo to Southampton. The train was
just moving out of the station, and it was impossible for the
detective to get in, but he ran along the platform by the side of
the window, clearly identified his man, took the number of the
carriage, and noticed which compartment it was, and immediately
wired to Basingstoke, the first stopping-place. When, however, the
train arrived at this place, the police, who had assembled on the
platform, found no trace of the criminal. It was ascertained that
the train had not pulled up once; the particular compartment was
empty, but a thorough search was made throughout the train, it
being thought that he might have changed carriages by the
foot-board. It is supposed that Winfield recognised the fact that
he had been discovered at the last moment on his way to the
Continent, and guessing that he would be arrested at Basingstoke,
must have jumped off the train in a moment of desperation. Whether
the unhappy man was killed or escaped remains a mystery, no trace
of him having been discovered."</blockquote>
<p>"What do you think of that?" said my mate.</p>
<p>"Well," I said, "I think he half deserved to escape on account
of his pluck. And&mdash;well, he was the finest liar I've ever
met!"</p>
<p>The fireman nodded his head slowly, and then said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well, I had my doubts most of the time. He was too fine a liar
for me!"</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>SPECIAL WORKING INSTRUCTIONS: A
STATION-MASTER'S STORY</h2>
<p>"I really believe," said the station-master, "that the majority
of the travelling public imagine that the sum total of my duties
consists in wearing a cap with a gold band round it, and strutting
about the platforms starting trains and answering questions, many
of which would puzzle the general manager of the line himself.</p>
<p>"Now, look here," he went on, pointing to the heterogeneous mass
of documents lying on the table of the office, and taking them up
one by one as he enumerated them. "This is the sort of
thing&mdash;from early morning till dewy eve, and often starry
midnight&mdash;a complaint from some old lady saying she's left her
umbrella either in the waiting-room, or on the book-stall, or in a
train she travelled in yesterday (she doesn't say which), and will
I tell her where it is and send it on at once. A notice from the
district superintendent asking for full details why the 12.53 was
delayed here yesterday. Instructions for submitting plans for
ventilating the cloakroom. Pamphlet of new fog-signalling
arrangements, requiring a complete alteration of posting the men. A
claim from a local brewer demanding compensation for beer arriving
short (it's marvellous how beer casks are always being staved
in&mdash;accidentally&mdash;on our night goods trains).
Instructions for working three
'specials'&mdash;excursions&mdash;to-morrow morning, and so on.
It's never finished, and sometimes I'm sick of it."</p>
<p>"This is rather interesting," I remarked, taking the last paper
he had mentioned from his hand and glancing at it. "How wonderfully
every detail is arranged, down to the names of the guards and the
time of passing every little signal cabin!"</p>
<p>"Those working instructions for the 'specials'? Yes, they have
to be set down pretty accurately. You see, we have to work them as
far as possible without interfering with the ordinary traffic, and
that means a lot of detail."</p>
<p>It certainly did. On the printed form was portrayed the running
of the trains in question, the number of coaches of which they were
to be composed, the class of engines to draw them, the stops for
taking in water, the shunting into "refuge sidings" <i>en route</i>
to allow of the passage of certain express trains&mdash;everything
was put down most carefully.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure that I ought to allow you to handle that," went on
the station-master, with a laugh. "You know, it's private
information, 'For the Company's servants only,' as you see."</p>
<p>"Well, I'll give it up at once&mdash;though I don't see what
harm it could do for me to know a little more than the outside
public about these excursion trains."</p>
<p>"No; as you say, there's no particular harm in anyone seeing
these papers. But," he added, musingly, "sometimes we receive
certain working instructions that might prove very dangerous if
outsiders were to get hold of them."</p>
<p>"How so?" I asked.</p>
<p>The station-master took a key from his pocket, unlocked a
drawer, and produced a crumpled and torn paper.</p>
<p>"This is a paper of working instructions for a special train,"
he said, "which nearly caused a most frightful catastrophe, and
which got me that nasty scar you may have noticed over my left
eye."</p>
<p>I took the paper. It was headed:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Specially urgent and private."</p>
<p>"Instructions for working through down special train from London
to Porthaven on March 7th, 189-."</p>
<p>I looked at my companion inquiringly.</p>
<p>"I see you want to know all about it," he said; "so as it's a
slack half hour, and I can get through my correspondence
afterwards, I don't mind telling you."</p>
<p>Then he related the following startling experience:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I suppose that some of our chief railway officials could, if
they chose, throw many a light upon the political history of
Europe. I mean that often visits of the utmost importance take
place between the Ambassadors of different countries, aye, and
between those who are higher than Ambassadors&mdash;visits that are
kept jealously secret and guarded, but upon which hang sometimes
the great fates of diplomacy&mdash;of war and peace. It is here
that the railway companies are often requisitioned to provide swift
and secure means of transit. Many a special train has traversed the
length and breadth of England, for instance, the identity of whose
passengers was only known to a few officials who made arrangements
for the journey, and who could be absolutely trusted in the matter.
Often it has been the work of a master railway mind to run such
trains at the precise time needed, a work of great anxiety when
perhaps the traffic superintendent knows an international problem
is trembling in the balance, and the solution rests upon the speed
with which a diplomatic journey is accomplished. Then, although it
is true we do not, happily, have to take the immense precautions
which are observed when the Czar travels in Russia, still it is
often necessary to arrange as strictly for the safe transit of an
important personage as for his speed. For, indeed, those who move
in the highest circles have enemies always, including the times
when they travel.</p>
<p>"When I received the circular of instructions which you now hold
in your hand, I guessed, from the caution and secrecy to be
observed, that some person of great importance was about to pass
over the line. Who this exalted personage was it matters not;
except, perhaps, you might probably call to mind that in the year
189- a certain great Sovereign of Eastern Europe was paying a
private visit to the Queen&mdash;a visit which, so it is said,
formed the basis of a subsequent diplomatic treaty.</p>
<p>"I was at the time the station-master of Millbridge, a small
station on our main line some forty or fifty miles from the London
terminus. It was a lonely spot at best, especially at night, for no
passenger trains stopped there after eight o'clock, though there
were plenty of through expresses. The station staff was a very
small one, as you will readily imagine.</p>
<p>"The circular in question was delivered to me on the evening of
March 6th, inclosed with a letter from the superintendent of the
line enjoining me to observe the very strictest caution and secrecy
in carrying out its instructions. The instructions were, briefly,
these. A special train was to leave London at 10.30 p.m. and was to
run to Porthaven. Not only were all pains to be taken to see that
she ran to time, but certain precautions, very much like those
observed when the Queen travels, were to be put in operation.
Twenty minutes before the special's 'time' each block was to be
clear, and patrols&mdash;chosen in each case from the platelayers
of the district&mdash;were to be placed along the line at stated
intervals two hours before the passing of the train, which, by the
way, was timed to pass Millbridge at 11.23 p.m.</p>
<p>"I recognised that somebody of the greatest importance was
travelling to Porthaven, which is, as you know, a seaport town from
which many vessels sail to the Baltic. The next morning I proceeded
to carry out instructions. I arranged with the ganger of the
district for the placing of the platelayers. I caused the signals,
etc., to be carefully inspected; in fact, I did all that was
necessary and sent up a report to town by a late afternoon
train.</p>
<p>"Of course I intended to be on the watch to see such an
important special through, and I detailed my head porter to be on
duty with me at 11 p.m. I must also tell you that I had given
orders to my signal-man, in accordance with the instructions, that
a down goods train which was due at 10.45 should be shunted into a
siding till the special had passed.</p>
<p>"About half-past nine that evening I was seated in my office,
making up my accounts. I have told you that the station was a
lonely one. My own house was the nearest, and that was a couple of
hundred yards away. My office, which opened on to the platform,
was, of course, very quiet at that hour. In feet, I was the only
person on the station, the signal-man on duty in the cabin just off
the platform being the nearest man. There were no more stopping
trains that night. The booking clerk and porters had gone home,
and, as I have said, the head porter was not to come on duty till
eleven.</p>
<p>"I was feeling a certain sense of satisfaction over my
arrangements for the 'special,' knowing that the men were properly
posted and that everything was clear, when, without a word of
warning, my door was suddenly thrown open, and two men, with masks
on their faces, entered.</p>
<p>"'Good evening,' said one of them, abruptly. 'You're the
station-master?'</p>
<p>"Yes,' said I, in astonishment.</p>
<p>"'Well, we've come on a little matter of business, and if you're
quiet we won't hurt you, though we shall have to take strong
measures.'</p>
<p>"'What on earth do you want?' I began.</p>
<p>"'First of all we want to see your instructions about a special
train that's to run down from London to-night.'</p>
<p>"'You're not going to see anything of the kind,' I cried,
attempting to rush through the door and give an alarm.</p>
<p>"But they were too quick for me. In a moment they had tripped me
up and sent me sprawling on my back.</p>
<p>"'Give up that paper!'</p>
<p>"'I won't!' I shouted, springing to my feet&mdash;'Help!
help!'</p>
<p>"'Quiet, you fool!' said the man who had not yet spoken, aiming
a blow at me with a heavy stick. It caught me just over the left
eye and fairly stunned me for a few minutes.</p>
<p>"When I came to I found myself gagged, my arms bound behind me,
and one of the ruffians finishing binding my feet together. The
other was eagerly rummaging my pocketbook.</p>
<p>"'Here it is,' he exclaimed.</p>
<p>"'Good!' said the other, as he tied the last knot. 'Now let us
hear all about it.'</p>
<p>"'Here we are,' said his companion, as he consulted the paper.
'Head-lights on engine a white one over a green one&mdash;'umph, we
must bear that in mind. Leaves London 10.30&mdash;passes through
here at 11.23&mdash;passes "Ash signal-cabin" at 11.28, and
Frambourne 11.36.'</p>
<p>"'Ah, well, the bridge is about midway between Ash cabin and
Frambourne, eh?'</p>
<p>"'Yes&mdash;so she'll pass there about 11.33.'</p>
<p>"'Good. What's the time now?'</p>
<p>"I could see the other man first take out his watch and then
look at the clock in my office.</p>
<p>"'Why, I'm over five minutes slow,' he said; 'it's three minutes
past ten by this clock. I'll set my watch by it, and then we'll be
off.'</p>
<p>"Really his watch was right. For many years I have been in the
habit of keeping my office clock five minutes in advance.</p>
<p>"'As for you, Mr. Station-master,' he exclaimed a moment later,
as they both turned to depart, 'I fancy you'll have to keep quiet
for a while. Good-night, and pleasant dreams!'</p>
<p>"So saying he turned out my lamp, and I heard them locking the
door on the outside after they had left me. I tell you I was pretty
uncomfortable. Not only was I lying bound hand and foot, unable to
speak, and suffering from the cut on my face, but I realized that
something dreadful was going to happen to the special
train&mdash;what, I could not guess. Then I remembered how
particular the instructions had been, the secrecy, the unusual
precautions, and the urgent way in which it had been laid down that
the train should not be one minute delayed in any way.</p>
<p>"I began to suffer agonies. What had they meant by the bridge?
Were they going to wreck the train? The latter seemed impossible in
view of the patrols. There was only one bridge between Ash cabin
and Frambourne, and that was over the line where a road crossed it.
Close under this bridge a platelayer had been stationed, I knew. It
was a mystery.</p>
<p>"And then as regarded myself. When should I get free? The head
porter would come on the platform about eleven. He would try the
door and find it locked. I should be unable to answer him. He would
think I had gone up the line, home&mdash;what would he think? I
struggled in my rage, but it was useless.</p>
<p>"So the time went by. It seemed hours&mdash;I heard the goods
train come in. 'Tap, tap!' The head porter was knocking at the
door.</p>
<p>"'Are you there, sir?'</p>
<p>"No answer. He shook the door.</p>
<p>"'That's a rum go,' I heard him exclaim, as his steps retreated.
Then my clock struck eleven.</p>
<p>"I rolled over on the floor with a final effort, and managed to
get my feet against the leg of the table. Why had I not thought of
it before? I was wearing elastic side boots. Hurrah! I wrenched one
off by the heel, then the other&mdash;<i>then</i>, with a supreme
effort, I wedged a coil of rope against the table leg and
tugged&mdash;tugged till I pulled the skin off my heel, <i>but</i>
the coil slipped slowly over my foot. That loosened the
rope&mdash;kick, kick&mdash;in a few minutes I had kicked myself
free. My hands were still bound, but I could use my feet, and I
did. I banged against the door with them with all my might in the
hopes of attracting attention from outside. And I did.</p>
<p>"'Are you inside, sir?' It was the head porter's voice.</p>
<p>"Bang&mdash;thud'&mdash;was all I could answer.</p>
<p>"'All right, sir, I don't know what's up, but I'll smash the
door in, so look out!'</p>
<p>"In half a minute he was at work with a platelayer's crowbar.
The door came crashing in. A stream of light from his lantern fell
upon me. He took in the situation at a glance, whipped out a knife
and cut the cords that bound my arms, and the handkerchief which
the blackguards had stuffed in my mouth.</p>
<p>"'For Heaven's sake, <i>what's the time!</i>' was my first cry,
heedless of his questions.</p>
<p>"He flashed the lantern on the clock. <i>A quarter past
eleven!</i> Ten minutes past by the right time. In thirteen minutes
the special was due! What followed was an inspiration. The head
porter thought me mad for a few minutes, and I could not even now
fully explain <i>why</i> I acted as I did. I only felt that at all
costs I must send a counterfeit special on first.</p>
<p>"'Rush to the signal cabin and keep back the special till I
come. Don't stand there staring like a fool, Gordon.
Quick&mdash;don't let him take off the home signal!'</p>
<p>"Then, scrambling across the lines and points, I hurried towards
the engine of the goods train that was waiting in the siding.</p>
<p>"'Driver&mdash;driver!' I cried.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir.'</p>
<p>"'Put on fresh head-lights; you've got one white one, get a
green lamp lighted. Do you hear? And put the white one over it.
Quick, now!'</p>
<p>"'What's the matter, sir?' said the astonished driver.</p>
<p>"'Never mind&mdash;only&mdash;are you prepared to carry out
orders at once?'</p>
<p>"'What are they, sir?'</p>
<p>"'Uncouple your engine, then back into No. 2 siding, take on the
three empty passenger coaches there, and run on to Frambourne with
them without a moment's delay, at your highest speed.'</p>
<p>"All right, sir,' said the driver, producing the head-light.
'Uncouple her, Jim,' he added to the fireman.</p>
<p>"I was off like a shot to the signal box to direct the slight
shunting operation involved. It was wonderfully quick work. At
exactly eighteen minutes past eleven the improvised train steamed
out of the siding on to the down line. She was <i>five minutes
before the special</i>. The signal-man saw something unusual was
the matter, and forbore from asking questions, simply sending the
'make ready' signal to Ash cabin, and receiving the usual replies.
There was a telephone to Ash, and I seized hold of it and gave some
directions.</p>
<p>"'I suspect danger on the line between you and Frambourne,' I
said, 'and have sent on a pilot train in front of special. Get
ready to receive special directly she has passed, but hold up the
special till you hear from Frambourne that all is clear. Tell
Frambourne to shunt pilot train immediately on arrival.'</p>
<p>"'All right, sir!' came the reply.</p>
<p>"At the same moment there was an ominous whistling in the
distance.</p>
<p>"'She wants the signal taken off,' said the signal-man,
referring to the special.</p>
<p>"'She'll have to wait, then.'</p>
<p>"The head-lights appeared, slackening down beyond the
home-signal. Then came the message from Ash cabin: 'Line
clear.'</p>
<p>"Crash! the lever was pulled, the special came on, gathering
speed as she passed. There was a locomotive inspector on the
footplate of the engine, and I heard him shout: 'You'll have to
answer for this!'</p>
<p>"Then came a period of suspense, minute after minute
passed&mdash;then, at last, the 'line clear' signal from the block
ahead. The special had passed Ash cabin. Several more
minutes&mdash;then a ring up on the telephone. 'Pilot train has
reached Frambourne, but there's something up. Line clear, and have
sent on special.'</p>
<p>"Another pause, and then a telegraphic message from Frambourne:
'Your action highly commendable. You have saved special. Engine of
pilot train returning on up line for goods train. Driver will give
information.'</p>
<p>"You may be sure we waited in a tension of excitement until that
engine arrived, travelling tender first. It was some time before it
did so, and when it came it carried a detective and an extra
driver, for it appears old Goodson had been too much overcome to
take his engine in hand. He came into the little office, and told
me the following extraordinary story:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'When you sent me on with them three empty passenger coaches,'
he said, 'I was dazed like. I never even stopped to pick up the
brakesman. Then I begun to think it out. I knew by the headlights
you wanted me to pretend I was the special, and, thinks I, there's
danger ahead, that's it. So I kep' a sharp look-out, not knowin'
what might be on the line, though I knew 'twas well guarded. It was
fairish dark, too, and I couldn't see far ahead.</p>
<p>"'Well, we passed Ash all right, and was bowlin' along for all
the world like a racin' train, when I see as I comes up to it the
outline of a couple o' men standin' on the top of a bridge. It was
all so sudden like that I can't tell exactly what happened, but
Joe, my fireman, sings out, as we passes under the bridge,
"Halloa," and I see summat fallin' on top o' the train as I turns
round to look. Then there were a couple o' awful explosions, and a
splinter o' wood copped me on the head. "Go on," ses Joe, as I put
my hand on the regulator, "Go on," 'e ses, "the bloomin' train
ain't quite smashed up&mdash;she'll run all right." So we ran on to
Frambourne, and there we find that two carriages were shivered
about frightful. Lor' bless us, sir, if there'd been anyone in 'em
they'd ha' been killed for certain. They was a mass o' splinters
runnin' on frames, that's what they was. You see what they'd
done?'</p>
<p>"'Dropped explosives on the train from the bridge?' I
gasped.</p>
<p>"'Aye&mdash;they thought we was the special. Ah, that was a
sharp bit o' work o' yours, sir.'</p>
<p>"'And the special?'</p>
<p>"'Oh, she come through all right, nearly five minutes late. They
won't know what happened till she gets to Porthaven. But you saved
her, sir.'</p>
<p>"Yes, it was true, I had saved the train and its
Royal&mdash;well, er&mdash;important occupant. I was ill with brain
fever for weeks afterwards, but when I recovered I heard that the
wretches had never been caught. They had evidently driven in a
dog-cart from my station to the bridge, and, owing to setting their
watch to my clock and the changed head-lights on the goods engine,
had imagined the 'special' was running to time, and had dropped two
dynamite bombs on to the tops of the empty coaches as they passed
beneath the bridge. The torn paper of working instructions was
found on the bridge, and, as you see, I have it now. The other
results of that night were promotion to this junction, and a
beautiful diamond scarf-pin that was sent me from&mdash;well,
er&mdash;Russia. Yes, passengers sometimes tip even the
station-master!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a>PIERRE COURNET'S LAST RUN:<br>
AN INCIDENT OF THE PRUSSIAN ADVANCE ON PARIS</h2>
<p>Wandering through the old city of Rheims one sultry summer
evening, I had lighted upon an insignificant little <i>caf</i> in
the neighbourhood of the station, and had sat me down to have a
cool "bock" and a smoke. At the next table to mine sat a group of
two or three workmen, seemingly connected with the railway, more
especially one of them, whose smoky blouse and not over-clean
visage proclaimed him as an engine-driver; in fact, as I looked at
him I remembered having noticed him on the foot-plate of the engine
that had drawn my train from Mzires to Rheims the previous
day.</p>
<p>I think it was the request on my part for a light, or something
equally trivial, that first caused me to enter into conversation
with my neighbours; but certain it was that before long we had
drifted into a subject that is rather a dangerous one to touch
upon, even now, with a Frenchman: the subject of the
Franco-Prussian War.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, monsieur," said one of the men, "I well remember the
coming of the Prussians into Rheims, though I was but a lad at the
time. It was early in the afternoon of September the 5th, a few
days after the Battle of Sedan. I was lounging about in the streets
when I heard the clatter of horse-hoofs, and sure enough four
Prussian soldiers came riding into the city. <i>Ma foi</i>, how we
hissed them!"</p>
<p>"What did they do?"</p>
<p>"Oh, they bought some food at a confectioner's. One old man
tried to stop them by taking hold of a horse bridle. The soldier
struck him with a pistol, but he would not let go. Then he shot him
through the arm. They galloped off directly afterwards, and a shot
was fired at them. In a few hours, though, we had twenty-five
thousand soldiers, with the King of Prussia at their head,
quartered upon us."</p>
<p>"How long did they stay?"</p>
<p>"Oh, they left immediately. They were marching on to Paris,
nothing seemed to stand in their way."</p>
<p>"Except old Pierre Cournet," said the man I had guessed to be an
engine-driver, taking his cigar from his lips reflectively.</p>
<p>"Ah, but that is true," remarked the other, adding, as he and a
third man who had not spoken rose to go, "Monsieur should ask Jean
Martin to tell him the story&mdash;he is not on duty for another
hour yet."</p>
<p>Left alone with Jean Martin, I begged leave to replenish his
glass of ordinary wine with a bottle of Burgundy, offered him a
more fragrant cigar than the one he had been smoking, and, in
return, drew the following extraordinary narrative from
him:&mdash;</p>
<p>"No, monsieur, I was not in the army at the time of the war, and
it is no story of a soldier that I am going to tell you. True, I
served afterwards, as every man must do in France, but then I was
only eighteen, and yet, although so young, was already a fireman on
this very same line where now I drive a locomotive.</p>
<p>"I had only been fireman for a few months before the war broke
out. The driver of the engine to which I was attached at the time
of which I am speaking was an old man named Pierre Cournet. We were
running trains between Rheims and Mzires, and, therefore, were in
close touch with the first great battlefield of the war. I shall
never forget that terrible time. Every sort of vehicle we had on
the line was used for carrying troops. We took over 20,000 men from
Rethel to Mzires, men belonging to Marshal MacMahon's army, and
among them were Pierre Cournet's two sons.</p>
<p>"They had just time on reaching Mzires to run to the engine
and bid their father farewell, for he happened to be driving the
very train by which they travelled, when the bugle-call tore them
away from him&mdash;tore them away for ever. For only a few days
afterwards the sword of a Uhlan and the bullet of a Prussian
needle-gun claimed the lives of Pierre Cournet's two sons in the
awful fight of Sedan.</p>
<p>"When the news was brought to him he almost went mad. He swore
he would turn franc-tireur and be revenged ten-fold for their
deaths. Ah, monsieur knows well he was not the only parent in
France who made such threats, and carried them out, too! And Pierre
Cournet would assuredly have carried his out but for that which
happened.</p>
<p>"We were at Rethel when the news came. Our countrymen were
flying in every direction, and the railway was falling metre by
metre into the hands of the enemy. Mzires still remained in
possession of the French, and did not surrender for some weeks, but
the railway communication was cut off. We tried to get down there
with some stores, but our train fell into the hands of the
Prussians at a station about twenty kilometres this side of
Mzires.</p>
<p>"Then it was that Pierre Cournet's patience was put to the test.
A great, bearded Prussian officer came on the foot-plate and
addressed him in broken French.</p>
<p>"You will take this train back to Rethel, after we have loaded
it with cannon and ammunition. You understand?'</p>
<p>"'I will not,' replied Cournet, trembling with fury. 'I will not
take your cursed guns one inch towards Paris.'</p>
<p>"'Oh, very well,' replied the officer, calmly drawing out his
watch and making a sign to some of his soldiers to come near. 'I
will give you two minutes to decide. If you refuse, why then you
will be shot instantly&mdash;I have no more time to waste on you. I
would not even give you this chance, only there are no engineers
with me, and I have no one who can drive a locomotive.'</p>
<p>"He stood, watch in hand, and the old engine-driver, pale with
fury, stood beside him. I watched Pierre Cournet's face. For the
first half minute it was still, with a set purpose; then a gleam of
light seemed to flash into his eyes, and his lips parted in a
smile. He had changed his mind.</p>
<p>"'Very well,' he said, as the Prussian closed his watch with a
snap. 'I will drive the engine for you.'</p>
<p>"'Good!' said the officer. 'But if you think you're going to
play any tricks you're mistaken, for see here!'</p>
<p>"He called to two of his men, who came on to the foot-plate, and
gave them some instructions in German. Each of them drew a
pistol.</p>
<p>"'Now,' he added to Pierre Cournet, in French, 'these soldiers
have orders to shoot you and your young friend on the very
slightest suspicion of trickery, and as one of them understands
French, you'd better be careful what you say. And now, while we
load the train, you get your engine to the other end and be ready
to start.'</p>
<p>"Pierre Cournet shrugged his shoulders and told me to get down
and uncouple the locomotive and to work the points so that he could
shunt it to the reverse end of the train. I did so, one of the
soldiers accompanying me and keeping guard over me all the time. We
had been running from Rethel tender first, so now the engine stood
in its right position, smoke-jack in front. I coupled her to the
train.</p>
<p>"It was nearly two hours before we were ready to start, and
during that time we watched the Prussians get six guns on to as
many trucks and fill all the available waggons with ammunition.
There were two old third-class carriages at the rear end of the
train, and some fifty artillerymen were ordered into these.
Finally, the officer who had spoken to us before came up, and
dismissed one of our guards, taking his place instead.</p>
<p>"'I shall travel with you,' he said, cocking his pistol, 'and
see that all goes right. Besides, I am not sure yet how far we
shall go. Now then, start!'</p>
<p>"I had set the points to bring the train on to the up-line.
Cournet laid his hand on the regulator, there were a few sonorous
puffs, and we were off.</p>
<p>"I knew by my companion's face that he meant to do something
desperate before our journey was over. He had given me one sharp,
questioning glance that seemed to mean, 'Will you help me?' and I
had nodded in reply, though what his plans were I could not guess.
Still, I determined that, if need be, I would strike a blow against
the hated Prussians.</p>
<p>"We had gone a few kilometres, and were getting up a fair speed,
when the mouth of a tunnel loomed ahead. I saw a strange expression
flit across Cournet's face, and I think the Prussian officer must
have noticed it too, for he said a few words in German to the
soldier, and the latter grasped me by the neck just as we entered
the tunnel, while at the same moment I felt the cold ring of his
pistol-barrel pressing against my forehead. The officer had seized
Cournet in the same manner, and if the old driver thought he was
going to do anything in the tunnel he was mistaken. When we were
through our guards released their hold. We went on. Presently a
smile of triumph shone in Pierre Cournet's face, instead of the
disappointed look he had worn as we emerged from the tunnel. I felt
instinctively that the moment of action was arriving.</p>
<p>"'Get me a spanner, Jean!' said the driver, quietly; 'a bolt is
loose.'</p>
<p>"I opened the tool chest and took one out. The officer's
suspicions were aroused in a moment, and he levelled his pistol at
Cournet as the latter took the spanner. But Cournet only smiled
contemptuously, and began tightening a nut, saying to me: 'More
coal, Jean.'</p>
<p>"I took up the heavy shovel and put a few loads on the fire, my
guard handling his pistol in a menacing manner all the time.
Evidently the slightest movement on our part was being watched with
scrupulous jealousy. What <i>was</i> the driver going to do? I
asked myself this question as I looked ahead through the
weather-glasses after putting on a third shovelful of coal. We were
rushing along a high embankment now, and travelling at a much
greater pace than we usually went. In a few seconds we should be
rounding a very sharp curve, but Cournet did not seem inclined to
slacken speed. He was still engaged in screwing up the nut.</p>
<p>"I was just turning towards the tender again for more coal, when
a sudden swerve told me we had left the straight and were rounding
the curve. At that very moment Pierre Cournet, his back towards the
officer, with a very quick movement of his wrist struck the glass
tube of the water-gauge with his spanner and sprang on one
side.</p>
<p>"In an instant a cloud of steam and a jet of scalding water
poured forth on to the footplate, blinding and burning us; at the
same moment two sharp reports rang out, and I heard Pierre Cournet
shout, 'Strike him, Jean!'</p>
<p>"I was quick to take it in. Notwithstanding what had happened, I
never lost my nerve for a moment; in fact, the breaking of the
water-gauge was no new experience to me, though this was the first
time it had not happened accidentally. My shovel was already half
poised in the air, and I brought it down with all my might on the
Prussian soldier's head. Reeling backward he fell off the
foot-plate, rolled down the embankment, and I saw him no more.</p>
<p>"Meanwhile Pierre Cournet had not been idle. With a second blow
of his weapon he had felled the officer immediately after the
latter had fired his pistol, and the big Prussian lay unconscious
at our feet. All this was but the work of a few seconds, but I
shall remember that terrible little fight in the midst of the
scalding steam as long as I live.</p>
<p>"The next moment the fearless old driver had rushed to the
broken gauge, and, scalding his hands severely in the attempt, had
turned off the steam and water-taps. Once more the foot-plate was
clear. But this was by no means all. There was a terrible plan
formed in Pierre Cournet's brain that day, and he worked it out to
the bitter end.</p>
<p>"We were now beginning to rush down an incline, at the end of
which, on the level, was a long tunnel. The old driver turned to
me:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Go back,' he cried, 'over the coals, and uncouple the engine.
You can do it, can't you?'</p>
<p>"I'll do it!' I shouted. We were only working with ordinary
chain-couplings, and I knew these would be slack as we ran
downhill.</p>
<p>"In ten seconds I was behind the tender, astride one of the
buffers, stooping down and separating the loose chain dangling
between the tender and the leading truck. Then I clambered back
over the coals to the foot-plate. I found Pierre Cournet slackening
speed with his hand on the regulator.</p>
<p>"'Tie him up,' he exclaimed, with a glance at the officer. 'He's
coming to.'</p>
<p>"There was a piece of rope in the tool chest, and I tied the
Prussian's arms securely behind his back, making the end of the
rope fast to a ring in the footplate. Hardly had I done so when we
entered the tunnel.</p>
<p>"We were running very slowly now. Although uncoupled, the
momentum given it by the incline had kept the train close behind
our engine, and, of course, its leading buffers were still touching
our rear ones, because, by slowing his engine, Pierre Cournet had
been checking the speed of the train behind.</p>
<p>"In the middle of the tunnel we stopped dead for a moment.</p>
<p>"'Good,' said Cournet, as he immediately opened the regulator
once more; 'it is level here, and the train will stay in the tunnel
until&mdash;until&mdash;but you shall see for yourself, Jean.
<i>Mon Dieu</i>, grant that I may hold out!'</p>
<p>"Out of the tunnel into the bright daylight we rushed with great
speed. Still I had no idea of what Cournet meant to do.</p>
<p>"'Put on the brakes,' he shouted as he shut off the steam.
'Quick and hard, my son!'</p>
<p>"We came to a standstill about three-quarters of a kilometre
from the tunnel's mouth. It was a perfectly straight bit of line,
and, looking back, I could see the black entrance behind us.</p>
<p>"'Get off, Jean,' said the driver.</p>
<p>"He was reversing the gear of the engine now, and it seemed to
me that it cost him a great effort to pull the lever over the
sector. Then came another voice, that of the Prussian officer. He
had come to.</p>
<p>"For God's sake, what are you going to do?' he asked.</p>
<p>"'Going to do? Why, send you back to your friends as fast as we
can. Adieu, monsieur&mdash;a speedy and safe journey to
you&mdash;and the journey ends <i>in the tunnel!</i>'</p>
<p>"So saying, he opened the regulator to the full, and sprang from
the foot-plate to my side as the great engine began to move
backwards, along the line we had come, towards the tunnel. It was
some moments before I grasped the horror of the thing. Then, as I
saw the locomotive hastening away from us, gathering fresh speed
every moment as it neared the dark opening of the tunnel, I
realized the awful nature of Cournet's revenge.</p>
<p>"He grasped me by the arm. I think he had gone mad for the
moment.</p>
<p>"See,' he cried, 'Andr and Jacquet will be avenged by their
father. They are caught like mice in a trap, and all their guns and
ammunition will be destroyed. Ah, it has nearly reached the
tunnel!'</p>
<p>"Horror-struck, I watched the locomotive until at length it
disappeared into the dark aperture, and the white steam rolled in
cloudy columns from the tunnel's mouth. The next few seconds seemed
like hours, but at last, straining every nerve, we heard a dull,
muffled sound from the direction of the tunnel, followed by a deep,
growling roar. Then all was quiet.</p>
<p>"I turned to Pierre Cournet. He had released his hold on me and
had sunk on the grass by the side of the line. His face was an
ashen grey, and for the first time I noticed a streak of red
running down his blouse.</p>
<p>"'Why, you are wounded!' I said.</p>
<p>"'Yes,' he gasped. 'He hit me when he fired; I hardly thought I
could have lasted it out&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;I have not died
too soon&mdash;goodbye, Jean&mdash;escape quickly&mdash;Ah!'</p>
<p>"In a second or two it was over, and I was running for my life
through the wood by the side of the line&mdash;for my life, I say,
because I knew the country round was infested with Prussians, and
it might have been difficult to give an account of myself had I
been captured.</p>
<p>"Afterwards? Oh, they thought it was a strategy of some French
engineers, this blowing up of the tunnel.* For blown up it was.
Probably the engine crashing into the first truck that was full of
shells caused the explosion. But the whole train was buried, and
with it the bodies of the Prussian artillerymen.</p>
<p>[* Several railway tunnels on the lines which the French knew
would prove useful to the Prussians in their advance on Paris were
purposely blown up.]</p>
<p>"And now I must wish monsieur goodnight, for it is nearly time
for me to take my train to Mzires. Without doubt my journey will
be less exciting than the one I have recounted."</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a>BETWEEN TWO FIRES: THE STORY OF
A LOST GUN</h2>
<p>It was, at the most, an affair of outposts, but Colonel Baxter
was anxious to make the thing successful, although the force under
his command was scarcely a thousand, all told, including four guns.
For some days the Boers had been retreating northward and had
crossed the Zandgolo River, entrenching themselves upon the farther
side, after having destroyed the railway bridge over the river. The
Colonel's little force had followed closely, and was encamped to
the south of Vredeburg, slightly over a mile and a half from this
same bridge. Although he hardly had hopes of dislodging the enemy
before the arrival of reinforcements, he was determined to push
forward as far as possible, and at least worry them if he could do
no more. For this purpose a reconnaissance with a hastily-prepared
armoured train was ordered.</p>
<p>Now, Major Finch did not believe in armoured trains, and he was
the more inclined to grumble on this occasion because one of the
precious four guns had been "commandeered" to go to the front on a
coal-truck protected with bits of boiler-plate. As an artillery
officer he mistrusted the whole arrangement, and made no secret of
it; but the Colonel only scoffed at his scruples, and so he had to
watch Lieutenant Sangate and a dozen men climb into the truck and
disappear behind "that rickety tin armour," as he called it.</p>
<p>There was not much time for growling, however, for the worthy
Major had to take up a position with the remaining guns on the
summit of a kopje that commanded the railway line as far as and
beyond the river. It Was the duty of these guns to protect the
advance of the armoured train.</p>
<p>"It's a fool's game," muttered the Major to himself as he swept
the veldt with his field-glasses, till his eyes rested on a ridge
of hills some three miles from where he was standing, and about a
mile and a half beyond the river. "They've got guns there, to a
dead certainty, guns that we can't touch; and as soon as that
rotten little, tinkered-up fad of Baxter's gets within range she'll
draw their fire. It'll be sheer luck if they get out of it, too. If
he wanted to send 'em a target why couldn't he have run out a
dummy, and not chanced losing my precious barker? Halloa, they're
off!"</p>
<p>For as he glanced at the line just below him there came some
spurts of steam from the engine as it slowly moved forward on its
dangerous errand. Besides the locomotive there were only two
trucks, one in front with the gun, and the other behind, containing
a Maxim and a score of Tommies. The Major watched the train as it
wound its way round the bases of the low hills until it reached
Vredeburg "Station," an apology consisting of a platform, a couple
of sheds, a few sidings, and a signal-box, the latter being on the
other side of the station.</p>
<p>From this point the line ran perfectly straight and on a dead
level with the veldt as far as the river, which was distant about a
quarter of a mile from the station. It was the object of the
reconnaissance to discover how far the bridge had been damaged,
and, by drawing the enemy's fire, to unmask his position.</p>
<p>"Now the game will begin," muttered the Major, as he turned his
glasses once more towards the distant kopjes.</p>
<p>He was right. A puff of white smoke came from the summit of one
of them, and a few seconds later there was another smaller puff a
couple of hundred yards in front of the advancing train. Another
and another followed, and shells began to drop thick and fast about
the little fort on wheels. Then there came a spurt of fire from the
leading truck. The enemy's compliment was being returned.</p>
<p>Slowly the train ran on. Half the distance between Vredeburg
Station and the river was traversed when, suddenly, another sound
arose distinct from the boom of the guns. It was the rattle of
Mausers.</p>
<p>"There they are!" cried the Major, "on the other side of the
river. Let 'em have it&mdash;a little under 3,000 yds!"</p>
<p>The three guns opened fire, and the range was speedily found.
Shrapnel began to drop unpleasantly close to the Boer riflemen the
other side of the river, who still, however, kept up a withering
fire on the approaching train. The latter had now arrived within a
hundred yards of the river, when suddenly the Major saw three of
the enemy's shells, aimed with splendid precision, fall almost
simultaneously apparently right into the train immediately in front
of the engine and burst, with clouds of smoke. This was followed by
a perfect hail of shells dropping in rapid succession all round and
upon the devoted train, supported by a terrific rifle fire from the
Boer infantry at a range of little more than 300 yds.</p>
<p>"Why don't she come out of it?" muttered Major Finch. "It's
madness trying to stick there." For the train had stopped dead, and
the one solitary gun was doing its little best. The enemy had not,
at all events, succeeded in silencing it.</p>
<p>"Good," went on the Major, as puffs of steam once more rose from
the engine's smoke-stack; "she's coming
back&mdash;what!&mdash;Great heavens, they've left my gun
behind!"</p>
<p>For as the train steamed quickly back into Vredeburg it was
evident that she was coming away without the front truck, which
still remained on the line within a hundred yards of the river, the
plucky gunners working their solitary gun for all they were
worth.</p>
<p>The enemy's shells had burst between the engine and the truck,
completely shattering the couplings. Two men lying dead across the
track showed that an attempt to recouple the truck had been in
vain, and under the fearful fire the engine had been compelled to
retreat. She left her other truck on the British side of Vredeburg
Station, and twice attempted a dash to the front, supported by
Finch's three guns. But it was no use. The Boer artillery had got
the range so perfectly that the engine could not possibly have run
within a couple of hundred yards of the gun-truck without being
smashed; in fact, she could scarcely show her buffers outside
Vredeburg Station.</p>
<p>Then the Major had to watch a gruesome thing through his
glasses. The last spurt of fire came from his beloved gun, and the
next moment Lieutenant Sangate and his men swarmed over the side of
the truck and started running back for dear life. First one bit the
dust with a Mauser bullet through the brain, then another stumbled,
and a comrade caught him in his arms and hurried on. Then the
Lieutenant began to limp on his left leg and had to be supported,
and finally eight men reached Vredeburg Station, five of them
wounded, leaving three motionless in the truck, beside the
abandoned gun, and two more lying by the side of the line.</p>
<p>So the gun was lost, and Major Finch's reflections on the
subject of armoured trains had better not be reported.</p>
<p>But the gun, though lost, was not in the hands of the enemy.
Before they could actually take it they would have to cross the
river, and very soon the sharp eye of Major Finch detected a
movement of this nature some quarter of a mile up stream, where
apparently there was a drift. But half-a-dozen well-aimed shells
from his battery soon put an end to this little game, and they had
to beat a retreat.</p>
<p>"Umph," growled the Major, "I suppose we'll try and bring it in
after sundown. But if the beggars have search-lights it won't be
much use. Fortunately, we've got ours, and the Colonel is sure to
fix it up so that they won't be able to show themselves anywhere
within range of our little beauties here. By George, I wish we
could get that gun back!"</p>
<p>Lifting his glasses once more he gazed long and earnestly at the
abandoned truck and its surroundings. As he did so a curious
expression stole over his face.</p>
<p>"She's pulled up close to that distant signal," he murmured;
"and that signal's worked from the station. Well, it's a tough job,
but it might be done, I should think. It's worth trying, too."</p>
<p>As the Major anticipated, when it was dark both sides began to
play on the abandoned gun with their search-lights, and it soon
became evident that a night attack to rescue it was out of the
question.</p>
<p>The Colonel was very gloomy at the rough-and-tumble mess that
evening.</p>
<p>"Well, gentlemen," he said to the officers present, "it's been
an unlucky day. But we must get that gun back somehow, even if we
have to pay heavily for doing so."</p>
<p>"We've paid pretty heavily for sending it there," growled the
Major.</p>
<p>The Colonel bit his lip. Then he began discussing a plan of
operations. It was his custom to consult the senior officers
individually on such occasions, and presently he turned to the
Major and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well, Finch, what is your opinion?"</p>
<p>"It's a risky plan, sir, that's what I think. I don't see the
use of employing the handful of cavalry we've got over this
business, and I'm sorry to say I don't agree with you."</p>
<p>"Perhaps you've got a better suggestion?" retorted the Colonel,
who was beginning to get angry.</p>
<p>"Well," drawled Finch, who had the reputation of being
annoyingly cool in discussions when other men lost their tempers,
"I think your plan risks too many men."</p>
<p>"And how many do you think would be enough, pray?"</p>
<p>"Um; well, I should say <i>one</i> man might tackle the job,
and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"<i>One man!</i>" cried the Colonel. "I don't know whether
you're joking, sir, but if you are, all I can say is that it's most
ill-timed."</p>
<p>"On the contrary, sir, I meant exactly what I said."</p>
<p>"Then perhaps you'll go and get your precious gun yourself!"</p>
<p>The Colonel had completely lost his temper. The little group of
officers started in pained surprise as the Major sprang to his
feet.</p>
<p>"Thank you, sir," he exclaimed, quietly, "I will obey your
orders. All I stipulate is that you keep that engine in steam till
you hear from me. Good-night, all!"</p>
<p>And, to the astonishment of all present, he turned on his heel
and walked out of the tent, without another word.</p>
<p>If his brother officers could have followed him they would have
been somewhat surprised at his movements. His first action was to
divest himself of his sword and to glance at his watch.</p>
<p>"About four hours of darkness left," he said to himself. "Well,
I shall want them all." Then he made his way to an armourer's tent
and demanded a couple of screw-drivers, a file, and a pair of
wire-nippers. Armed with these singular weapons he started along
the line in the direction of Vredeburg. Just before he came to the
station he was challenged by a couple of vedettes, who allowed him
to proceed on giving the password. He paced through the empty
station until he was just past the signal-box at the farther end.
Then he threw himself motionless on the ground as a blinding flash
of light came streaming over the spot.</p>
<p>"They'll scarcely pick out one man in khaki," he muttered, when
the light had shifted.</p>
<p>Crawling on his hands and knees to the side of the line, he
uttered an exclamation of joy as he found what he had come to seek,
the signal wire by which the distant signal near the gun was
manipulated from the box. It was carried along the side of the line
on small posts about a foot high, and some fifteen yards apart,
running over a grooved wheel screwed to the top of each of these
posts.</p>
<p>"It's a good thick one," he remarked, as he felt the wire, which
was composed of several twisted strands, "and ought to stand a
jolly good strain. If it doesn't! But, there, we won't think of
'ifs'; we'll get to work."</p>
<p>First of all he cut the wire through with his file and pliers,
then he started crawling along the line, keeping absolutely still
every time the light came flashing upon him, until he had passed
some five of the little posts. Taking hold of the wire, he
commenced to pull it towards him from the direction from which he
had come. He thus cleared some seventy yards of wire, which he
carefully coiled, from the pulley-wheels.</p>
<p>"The others will have to be taken off," he exclaimed, as he drew
out one of his screwdrivers and crawled to the next post. It was
the work of some ten minutes to find and extract the two screws
which fastened the little grooved wheel through which the wire ran
to the post. Then he crawled carefully to the next one, and
performed the operation in less time&mdash;then to a
third&mdash;and so on, gradually nearing the gun and freeing the
wire from the posts as he did so.</p>
<p>As he could not free the pulleys from the wire without cutting
the latter, he had to push them along from post to post, and so
they gradually accumulated until he had twenty of them together on
the wire in this manner.</p>
<p>"At last!" he exclaimed, as he reached the shadow of the truck,
shivering for a moment as he crawled over one of the dead bodies in
his path. "It's lucky the signal's <i>beyond</i> the gun, or there
wouldn't have been enough wire."</p>
<p>Then he cut the wire, strung off the score or so of
pulley-wheels, thus clearing it, stole gingerly to the end of the
truck, and, sheltered completely from the enemy's view, fastened
the end of the wire securely to the broken coupling.</p>
<p>It had taken him the best part of three hours to perform this
little operation, and now he commenced his slow, painful journey
back. Whether or no the Boers were suspicious he could not tell,
but certain it was that their flash-light glanced more repeatedly
along the track, and once they threw a desultory shell that burst
unpleasantly near.</p>
<p>By-and-by, however, he reached the spot where he had coiled the
end of the wire, found it, and continued his journey, uncoiling the
wire as he went, until he came to the end of it. Then he twisted
the end into a large loop, which he carefully placed between the
rails.</p>
<p>"It's lucky it's a dead level," he exclaimed, "and that it's a
straight line. If only the wire stands the strain!"</p>
<p>Then he rose to his feet and hurried back to the camp. Day was
breaking as he reached the British lines, and one of the first to
encounter him was Colonel Baxter.</p>
<p>"Man alive," he began, "where the dickens have you been? You
weren't so foolish as to take me at my word last night,
surely?"</p>
<p>"I don't know about being foolish, sir," replied Major Finch,
very quietly; "that remains to be seen. But I want my gun back
again, and if that engine's in steam I'll go and get it at
once."</p>
<p>"What on earth are you going to do? You can't get to the gun,
man. It's impossible!"</p>
<p>"Quite so, but I can get the gun to me, I think."</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"If you wouldn't mind getting on that little hill, where my
three guns are posted, you'll see the gun rescued, if I'm
successful, sir. Have I your permission to start now?"</p>
<p>With a grunt of astonishment the Colonel consented, and Finch
walked off to the line and found the little locomotive with steam
up. Getting on to the foot-plate, he motioned the driver to open
the regulator.</p>
<p>"Run her forward as fast as you can, and be prepared to stop and
reverse her just the other side of the station," he exclaimed.</p>
<p>The Colonel and a few other officers, who had got wind that
something extraordinary was on the move, watched the engine from
the top of the kopje. As soon as she drew near the station the Boer
guns opened a furious fire, and their shells began to drop about
the all-important bit of line in front.</p>
<p>"The fool!" cried the Colonel, "I shouldn't have given him
permission to perform such a mad bit of bravado. Ah, I thought so;
of course he's had to stop."</p>
<p>For the engine had come to a halt just beyond the station.</p>
<p>"He'll have to come back now," said the Colonel.
"Halloa&mdash;what's he doing? Why, he's got down! He's gone in
front of the engine&mdash;He's hit!&mdash;No, he's picking
something up! Ah, now he's back on the foot-plate! What's his
little game, I wonder?"</p>
<p>If the Colonel could have been present on the footplate he would
have heard Finch say to the driver:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Have you reversed her?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Open the regulator slowly then&mdash;very slowly mind, or the
wire will snap. Do you hear?"</p>
<p>"All right, sir, I understand. We'll get her off, sir."</p>
<p>"Aha!" went on the Colonel. "I told you so. He's beginning to
move back. He's precious slow over it, too."</p>
<p>"Look at the truck&mdash;look&mdash;look!" suddenly shouted the
officers by his side.</p>
<p>"By George!" cried the Colonel. "It's moving&mdash;it's coming
along! How in the name of&mdash;Hurrah! Bravo, Finch, bravo! He's
got her off!"</p>
<p>For, apparently without any cause, the gun-truck began to move
away from the river towards the British lines. Finch was bringing
back his own. The wire had held, had stood the strain of starting
the truck, and the rest was easy.</p>
<p>Amid a hail of shells that truck came in. The driver increased
his speed. He had to stop as he began to round the curve to the
south of Vredeburg, but the start and the pace attained had been
enough to bring the truck with its precious burden rolling along
through the station until the engine was properly coupled to it,
and Finch brought his train to the camp in triumph.</p>
<p>"Well done, Finch," exclaimed the Colonel, the first to greet
him on his return. "Never mind anything I said."</p>
<p>"I don't, sir," said Finch, with a smile. "I've got my little
beauty back."</p>
<p>"Tell you what," shouted another officer, "you
deserve&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What I hope I'll get," said the Major, "and that's breakfast
and a snooze."</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-10" id="ch-10"></a>THE TRIUMPH OF SETH P.
TUCKER</h2>
<p>"What! You mean to tell me you've been over in the States and
never heard of the 'Grand Rocky Hill and Peak City Railway'! Wal,
stranger, you surprise me. I guess you Britishers get in such a
habit of stickin' your nose in the air over your foolish notions of
the value of your forefathers that when you get to a country like
the States, where thar <i>is</i> somethin' to be proud of, all you
reckon to see is the tops o' the houses or the blue sky. Why, Sir,
thar ain't a child o' six years old over thar that don't know the
G.R.H. and P.C.R. just as well as he does his triggernometry or any
other branch o' book-learnin'.</p>
<p>"You talk about your express trains in England! Why. Sir, you're
afraid to get up any speed; and it ain't to be wondered at,
considerin' your island's so small that if you ran at anythin' like
our lightning expresses, the whole train would be in danger of
runnin' into the sea before the driver had space to pull her up.
But on the G.R.H. and P.C.R. I guess there's a length o' track that
would supply metals for the entire British Isles; and as for speed,
why, if one of the engineers ran under a mile a minute on an
ordinary train, I reckon he'd hand in his checks and enjoin his
relatives to bury him in the middle of a prairie, whar no one 'ud
ever hear of him.</p>
<p>"Have I got anything to do with the line? Yes, Siree, I guess I
have. Not that I'm a big boss on it, but&mdash;wal, thar, I don't
mind tellin' you that Caleb B. Luker (that's my name, stranger) is
known on every inch of the G.R.H. and the P.C.R., and his opinion
ain't sneezed at, neither.</p>
<p>"But what I was goin' to tell you ain't anything to do with this
child&mdash;it's a yarn about two engineers when the Peak City
branch o' the railway was bein' constructed; and when you've heered
it, you'll say it's one o' the most astoundin' railway tales as was
ever known since the creation of the world. But I guess I'd better
begin the yarn without any further ramifications.</p>
<p>"When the idea of bringing on the track from Big Pine Junction
to Peak City was started, everyone naturally said that the crossin'
o' the Buffalo Horn River would be a tarnation awkward job, however
it was done, for though it looks friendly enough in the summer,
thar's an ugly lot o' torrents and melted snow comin' down it in
winter and spring, and a wood pile bridge stood every chance of
takin' a journey down stream, with or without a train on top.</p>
<p>"But Seth P. Tucker, the company's engineer in this particular
department, warn't a man to be frightened by such or'nary things as
circumstances. It's my belief that if there were any talk of the
Old World and America bein' joined by a bridge, Seth P. Tucker
would ha' put in two specifications within a month&mdash;one for
the Atlantic and the other for the Pacific. I've heard him say
often that Natur' is a coward at heart, and Natur' certainly had to
take a back seat whar <i>he</i> was concerned. Why, Sir, it was
Seth P. Tucker who bust up the big obstruction when the San Felippo
Railway was being prospected in South America. Thar was a volcano
in the line o' route, and as a tunnel couldn't be made through it
the track had to cross a deep valley at the foot. It was calculated
that a million dollars wouldn't pay for the cost of a viaduct, but
Seth P. Tucker jest had a look round, smiled a knowin' sorter grin,
and ordered twenty tons o' blastin' powder and a hundred gallons o'
nitro-glycerine. He had these taken to the top o' the mountain and
fixed up on an electric affair by the edge o' the crater. Then he
jest pressed a button at the other end o' three miles o' wire, and
the whole show was precipitated at once into the volcano. Talk
about a bust-up and the trump of doom! One half o' that mountain
was blown clean down into the valley, fillin' it up completely, and
only takin' a bit o' leveling to get it ready for the
sleepers&mdash;while the lava, when broken up, made the best
ballast <i>I</i> ever saw.</p>
<p>"But it's about the Buffalo Horn River and the G.R.H. and P.C.R.
I was talkin'. Wal, stranger, Seth P. Tucker came down and did a
bit of prospectin', and in a few days' time he'd fixed up a plan
for a bridge and drawn it on paper, so's you might ha' sworn it
must ha' been thar already for him to get so neat a pictur' of it.
He sends this plan inter the Company's office at Rocky Hill,
calculatin' that in a few days' time he'd get the order for the
contract. But thar was a disappointment in store for Seth P.
Tucker, one that he hadn't reckoned on either. 'Pears thar was
another engineer that owed him a grudge. Ebenezer Finch&mdash;that
was his name&mdash;managed to get hold o' the specifications of the
bridge, told the directors he fancied he had a plan in his head for
fixin' up the show in a way that 'ud beat it, and asked leave to
send in his tender. Then he went down to Buffalo Horn River,
sounded the stream a bit, had a shaft sunk on either side, took a
few levels and such-like. The end of it was that he sent in a
specification for <i>tunnelling</i> that 'ere river. He pointed out
that the Thames had a tunnel under it, that the Severn was goin' to
have one, that thar was a lot o' talk o' jining England to France
by the same means, 'and if,' he said, '<i>that</i> undertaking can
be carried through, why shouldn't you run your cars under Buffalo
Horn River? It's safer than torrents and snow and timbers driftin'
down stream, and it ain't likely that <i>you'd</i> be behind Europe
in such an enterprise.'</p>
<p>"When Seth P. Tucker first heard of this plan he laughed fit to
break his neck, but when he knew that the directors were givin'
serious consideration to it, he used enough language to bridge the
Mississippi with solid oaths. The fact was that Ebenezer Finch had
impressed the directors with his scheme. They rather liked the idea
of havin' the tunnel; they'd not only be able to crow over every
other line o' railway in the States, but it would be a big boom for
the G.R.H. and P.C.R. Folks would flock to see it, and the Peak
City branch would become famous all over the world. It wasn't so
much the <i>necessity</i> of the tunnel as the unique natur' of the
idea that fetched 'em. They liked the thought o' saying, 'Any
<i>other</i> line would have had a bridge, but not for the G.R.H.
and P.C.R.! No, Siree, I guess <i>we've</i> got a tunnel.'</p>
<p>"So the end of it was that the directors sent for both engineers
and interviewed 'em together. Thar was plenty o' words bandied
about at the meetin', specially when the chairman announced that
Ebenezer Finch's scheme had come out trumps.</p>
<p>"Not that we want to say anything against your plans, Mr.
Tucker,' he went on, 'but because we think the G.R.H. and P.C.R.
ought to have this tunnel.'</p>
<p>"'And so you're all goin' to make fools o' yerselves for the
sake of a derned experiment, are ye?' yelled old Tucker. 'Let me
tell ye it's as bad as diggin' a grave for the lot o' ye; not but
what I wish that Finch 'ud dig one for himself, for it's about all
he's fit for.'</p>
<p>"'Go and hang ye'self on one o' yer crazy old bridges, if it'll
bear yer weight&mdash;which I doubt!' retorted the other engineer,
with an amiable sorter grin. Then Seth P. Tucker caught up an
inkpot and slung it at him, and in less time than it takes to tell
they wos rolling over together on the floor in a lovin' grip and
the directors tryin' their best to separate them. The meetin' was
talked about for weeks, and was a kinder preliminary advertisement
to the great tunnel.</p>
<p>"Wal, Seth P. Tucker swore by some biggish oaths that the tunnel
should never be made. He considered it the awfullest insult he'd
ever had offered to him, and the doom he wished for himself if the
other man ever finished that tunnel and run a train through won't
bear repeatin', it was so awful. He hung about the country for a
bit, and then he suddenly disappeared. No one knew whar he'd gone
to, and as nothin' was heered of him, folks got to reckoning that
he'd jumped inter Buffalo Horn River outer sheer disapintment.</p>
<p>"But Ebenezer Finch soon brought along his fixin's, and got to
work on the tunnel job. His idea was to commence a cuttin' on each
side, about a mile and a quarter away from the river-bank, and to
lead the track down by an easy gradient till he got it to a level
fit to begin borin' under the water. He began operations pretty
well on in the fall o' the year, and by the time spring came round
he was about ready with his borin'-machines, and towards the end o'
March they had a dinner o' the directors in the cuttin', and began
the first stroke o' the tunnellin' work with flags flyin' and an
old cannon they'd fished up from somewhere a-bangin' away till it
very near got red hot. Finch reckoned he'd have that tunnel bored
somewhere along the latter part o' the summer, and things seemed
going on pretty merrily all round.</p>
<p>"'Twas a few weeks after this that a stranger appeared on the
scenes at the little town called Pine Settlement that had begun to
spring up on the south bank o' the river near the tunneling
operations. He was a feeble-looking old chap, with a big white
bears and long hair&mdash;an inoffensive-looking coon, who said
he'd come to do some fishin' in Buffalo Horn River. Folks hadn't
reckoned as a rule that there was any fishin' worth speaking of in
those parts, but the old chap seemed to think otherwise, and nobody
took the trouble to contradict him much. So he prospected about the
settlement for a bit, and finally fixed on a bit o' land close to
the river, for which he paid the Government claim, and commenced
running up a shanty right on the edge o' the stream. He was mighty
particular about havin' it as close as possible, and he had a
sorter little landin'-stage on to it, so's to have a comfortable
place for fishin' from or bringing a boat to. He bought a few bits
o' furniture at the local store, but a lot o' traps came down in a
wagon, and he was so mysterious over 'em that he wouldn't let any
o' the boys help him in unloadin' 'em, and folks reckoned he'd
brought down some patent fishin' apparatus.</p>
<p>"He 'peared to fish a good deal after this; but, somehow or
other, he never had much to show for it. He didn't chum up with
anyone much, though now and again he'd answer back when he was
spoke to. Once a feller said to him: ''Scuse me, stranger, but
p'raps you don't know that this 'ere shanty o' yours is peculiarly
placed?'</p>
<p>"'How's that?' says the old chap in an innercent kinder way.</p>
<p>"'Why, I reckon it's right over the tunnel they're borin' under
the river.'</p>
<p>"'Is it? Wal, 'tain't no consarn o' mine if it is,' says the
other, as if he didn't care a red cent about the tunnel.</p>
<p>"Thar was a curious story got afloat just after this. A little
girl, comin' home by the river-bank rather late one night as the
moon was getting' up, had a fright that most skeered her to death
jest as she passed the little fishin' shanty. She declared she saw
Old Nick hisself a-comin' up outer the river with an ugly big head
and goggle-eyes. Said he climbed up on the landin'-stage and walked
right inter the old fisherman's shanty. It was a funny tale; thar
warn't many that b'lieved it; but still it made the old chap and
his doin's seem a bit queer, especially as no one could prove he
warn't entertainin' the devil.</p>
<p>"But folks soon forgot about the old man and his shanty when the
news began to spread that the tunnel was cut at last, and that a
trial train from Big Pine Junction would run through it in a
fortnight's time. Thar was a powerful lot o' people came along to
see things, and even a smatterin' o' Congressmen along of 'em.</p>
<p>"Wal, to make a long story short, the day of opening the tunnel
came, and thar was a good show o' folks on either side o' the
cuttin' hours before the train was timed to arrive from Big Pine
Junction. Ebenezer Finch was in his glory&mdash;struttin' about
here, thar, and everywhar, and showin' himself off among the crowd.
He was standin' near the top o' the cuttin', close to the mouth o'
the tunnel, talkin' to someone, when suddenly he felt a hand laid
on his shoulder. He turned round, and thar he saw Seth P. Tucker
grinnin' in his face.</p>
<p>"Mornin', Finch. I guess this here's a proud day in your
existence&mdash;ain't it?' he drawled.</p>
<p>"For a moment the other engineer was so taken aback that he
couldn't speak. Tucker went on&mdash;</p>
<p>"So ye've bored this wonderful tunnel o' yours, and completed
it, have ye?'</p>
<p>"'Tucker!' gasps the other; 'why, I heered ye was dead!'</p>
<p>"'Maybe ye did, but I reckon I ain't. Retired inter private life
a bit, that's all. Just strolled round now to have a look at this
here masterpiece of yours!'</p>
<p>"Wal,' says the other, with a grin, 'I don't say but what I
<i>am</i> proud of it. Thar ain't no ill feelin' between us
now&mdash;eh?'</p>
<p>"'Oh, no, I ain't a bit jealous of ye,' said Tucker very
deliberately, and lighting a cigar as he spoke; 'the only thing is
that I reckon you'll never get a train to run through this here
tunnel o' yours. It's a pity, o' course, but&mdash;'</p>
<p>"'What!' yelled Finch; 'not get a train to run through it! Why,
thar's one goin' through in less than an hour's time from now.'</p>
<p>"'I reckon not,' said Tucker, blowin' a whiff o' blue smoke out
of his mouth and watchin' it curl up to heaven.</p>
<p>"'<i>Not!</i> Why, it's on the track now, comin' along. It's
turned half after eleven. At half-past twelve or tharabouts you'll
see her run through with your own eyes. You can go aboard her if
you like.'</p>
<p>"'Ebenezer Finch,' said Tucker, lookin' at his watch, 'I'll bet
you ten thousand dollars that train never runs through your tunnel,
the only condition bein' that if it don't you let the matter rest
thar.'</p>
<p>"'Done, you denied idiot,' roared Finch; 'are you wantin' to
give money away? Done, but on the condition you stop here. I ain't
goin' to have you foul the track, or wreck the train, or anything
o' that sort.'</p>
<p>"'Oh, I'll stay here,' said Tucker, sittin' down on a bit o'
turf. 'You're sure that tunnel's all clear?'</p>
<p>"'Certain. I've been through it twice this mornin'.'</p>
<p>"'And the track's all right, and&mdash;'</p>
<p>"'The only thing that's wrong is your silly head. It's cracked!'
rejoined Finch.</p>
<p>"'All right,' said the other, with a grin. 'We'll soon see!'</p>
<p>"He went on smoking and gazing at his watch. Presently he
pocketed it with an air of triumph, muttering&mdash;</p>
<p>"'A quarter to twelve!'</p>
<p>"The words were hardly out of his mouth when there was a dull
thud, a roar, and a violent tremor of the earth. An instant
afterwards, and two men, who were standing at the mouth of the
tunnel, came scrambling up the embankment, yelling&mdash;</p>
<p>"'The water's through! Get up&mdash;get up for your lives!'</p>
<p>"There was a wild rush up the sides of the cutting, and then a
stream of water came out of the tunnel's mouth, a stream that in
less than a minute had become a roarin' torrent, sweeping along the
cutting like an avalanche, tearin' up the track and swirlin' the
gravel about like a sea-beach.</p>
<p>"Ebenezer Finch, who had started to his feet at the moment of
the explosion, took a glance round. There was a man close by on
horseback, tryin' to quiet the brute. Finch recognised him, and
shouted&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Quick, George! Ride like fury, and stop the train!'</p>
<p>"The other understood at once and galloped off.</p>
<p>"Wal, Ebenezer Finch, I guess that pile's mine, ain't it?'
drawled Tucker.</p>
<p>"You skunk!' yelled the other. Thar'll be a day o' reckonin' for
this.'</p>
<p>"'Likely thar will,' said the other coolly, 'but anyway that
train ain't goin' through your tunnel unless you make a divin'
dress for it, and what's more, I don't suppose thar ever
<i>will</i> be a train run through now. It'll be a case o' bridgin'
it over, after all!'<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>"And so it was, but not before thar wos a most tarnation row
about it. You see, the whole thing very soon leaked out, and the
facts o' the case became known. The old fisherman and Seth P.
Tucker were one and the same person, and the mysterious lot o'
goods that had come to his shanty were a divin'-dress, some biggish
submarine dynamite mines, and a lot of electrical apparatus. And
Seth P. Tucker had actually put on that divin'-suit night arter
night, climbed down off his landin'-stage, and got into the bed o'
the river, and had worked thar with a pick-axe and a patent
excavating tool o' his till he'd sunk a little shaft in the
riverbed right over Finch's tunnel. He stacked this with his
dynamite cartridges, attached electric wires to 'em, filled up the
hole, and waited. On the mornin' of the openin' day he set a 'cute
little clockwork machine goin' in connection with his battery in
the shanty so as to fire the charge at exactly a quarter to twelve.
Dynamite havin' a habit of explodin' downwards, the thing worked
just as he expected it would, and bust up Finch's tunnel in a brace
o' shakes.</p>
<p>"At first the directors were fairly mad, and threatened all
sorter things, while Finch said he'd shoot Tucker. But Seth warn't
a bit discomforted, havin' reckoned up the whole thing from the
beginnin'. He pointed out that there warn't no law to prevent him
diggin' holes at the bottom of an unnavigable river and
experimentin' with dynamite cartridges if he chose. If other folks
chose to lay tunnels under his experimentin'-ground, that was their
consarn, not his. After the bust-up there warn't nothin' else to be
done but to build a bridge. Wal, they knew very well that he was
the only man who could do it. They couldn't afford to do without
him, and he was willin' to act liberally towards 'em. Finch had had
a fair bet with him, and owed him ten thousand dollars. Wal, he
didn't mind takin' on the contract for the bridge at ten thousand
dollars under the price.</p>
<p>"The directors finally saw they were caught in a hole and caved
in. Ebenezer Finch had to pay up, for the bet was a fair one. He
lay around for a while after, and pot-shotted Tucker occasionally;
but he warn't good enough with his weapon to hit him, and when the
thing grew monotonous, and Tucker began to shoot back, he left
altogether. The line was deviated from the cuttin', the earth that
had been dug up from it was used as an embankment to run the train
up to the level o' Seth P. Tucker's bridge, which is one o' the
finest bits o' engineerin' work on the Buffalo Horn River.</p>
<p>"You want to know more details about how he put the divin'-dress
on himself, and why they didn't stop up the hole, and a lot o'
other things? No, Sir. If you expec' an American citizen to go
inter silly details when he is recountin' veracious hist'ry, you're
mistaken. <i>Good</i> evenin'!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch-11" id="ch-11"></a>A POLICY OF SILENCE</h2>
<p>Walter Meriton put the question boldly to Mr. David Cartwright,
even as he had promised the latter's daughter he would, and now he
waited, looking straight at the stern, business-like face of the
assistant superintendent of the line for his reply, but already
reading a decided negative therein.</p>
<p>"See here, Mr. Meriton," he said presently, "some men in my
position would have been highly offended at this. But I don't want
to treat you in that way. Understand that I am not in the least
angry with you for asking the hand of my daughter, though I must
confess you have taken me by surprise. But my answer must be
no!"</p>
<p>"May I ask your reasons, sir?"</p>
<p>"You may. In the first place you are both very young&mdash;my
daughter especially. In the second place I intend that my daughter
shall marry a man who is able to support her in the manner to which
she has been accustomed, which you are certainly unable to do at
present. And in the third place, you will pardon me for saying so,
I do not see any special indications that you will rise to such a
position. The C. M. &amp; St. P. R. R. Company, as you very well
know, makes no promotion by favoritism. Every man must win his way
up the ladder, as I have had to do myself."</p>
<p>"It is absolutely final as far as the present is concerned," he
said, "and unless you progress up the ladder it will be final in
the future. The fact of your being what is called a gentleman makes
no difference. The question is how do you stand with us from a
business point of view? Your chief merit is your knowledge of
German. There you are useful to us in our correspondence. But do
something smart on the line, my lad," he went on kindly. "Do
something smart! That's the way to get on."</p>
<p>"I'll try, sir&mdash;for Evie&mdash;Miss Cartwright's sake."</p>
<p>"Very likely. But understand me that from this moment you must
not say another word to her on the subject. She must be left free.
Can I trust you?"</p>
<p>"Certainly."</p>
<p>"And now to work. I want you to run down to St. Paul tomorrow,
and make thorough investigations as to the working of the staff
there. I'm not quite satisfied about things, and I want a full
report before I go down myself. There's a slack tone about the
station and complaints have reached me. We'll go over them
now."</p>
<p>He went through a bundle of documents with the young man, and
finally dismissed him with the injunction to take the 9:30 express
the next morning.</p>
<p>Then he lay back in his chair a minute or two and pondered.</p>
<p>"I like that fellow," he admitted, "and I know Evie's fond of
him. But I haven't seen real grit in him yet. Well, time will
prove."</p>
<p>Walter Meriton somehow found an opportunity of seeing the
assistant superintendent's daughter before the day was over.
Possibly the meeting had been arranged beforehand.</p>
<p>"Well," she asked, "did you see him?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"What did he say?"</p>
<p>Meriton told her.</p>
<p>"Good old dad!" she replied. "I knew he liked you. Then it's all
right, Walter."</p>
<p>"I don't see that it's all right at all, dear," said the young
man gloomily. "We've got to break off the engagement,
and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You silly boy," she interrupted, "just as if it really matters.
It's only for a time. I'll wait for you if&mdash;if you don't make
my wait too long," she added, roguishly.</p>
<p>"Of course I shall try and win you."</p>
<p>There was a resolute look in Walter Meriton's face when he rose
next morning. He noticed it himself in the glass. He meant
business, did this young man. He had sat up half the night going
deeply into the question of the St. Paul station staff, for he
intended this report of his to be the first little rung up the
ladder before him.</p>
<p>Railway men from guards to superintendent are generally the last
to get into a starting train. So, as Walter Meriton walked on to
the platform alongside which stood the St. Paul express, the guard
was just preparing to wave his green flag. Even then, Meriton did
not hurry, but exchanged a word or two with one of the
officials.</p>
<p>Then, just as the train began to move, he made a dash at a
first-class compartment. It was locked, but the other hastily
produced his key and opened it, and Meriton swung himself in. As he
looked out of the window to say a last word to the official, he
heard a deep voice behind him in German:</p>
<p>"Ach Gott! Curse him, I thought we had the compartment to
ourselves! I gave the guard five dollars to lock us in."</p>
<p>He was on the point of turning to apologize when he heard
another voice say in the same language:</p>
<p>"Bad luck! But we must settle with him if he is
troublesome."</p>
<p>Now Walter Meriton was a thorough German scholar.</p>
<p>He looked for a moment carelessly at his companions. They were
two evil-looking men&mdash;one short and sandy-haired, with little
gray eyes that never kept still; the other big and sinewy, a very
powerful-looking fellow. They, in turn looked at him closely.
Evidently their suspicions were aroused. So were his, but he never
showed it.</p>
<p>Then the short man leaned over and spoke to him in German,
asking whether he objected to smoking. By no hint did he betray
himself.</p>
<p>He simply shook his head and remarked in English that he did not
understand.</p>
<p>"We want to schmoke," said the German in English.</p>
<p>"Oh, certainly!"</p>
<p>He smiled and nodded. But the other man was not satisfied.
Turning to Meriton he let fly a volley of the foulest abuse in
German.</p>
<p>Meriton did not turn a hair, though he understood perfectly. He
only shrugged his shoulder and looked bewildered.</p>
<p>Then the short man explained, after a pause: "Mine friend
shpeaks not English. He ask you for matches!"</p>
<p>"We may speak," said the short man, "he does not
understand."</p>
<p>"No, but he will be in the way."</p>
<p>"What shall we do?"</p>
<p>"Don't worry, my friend. We are a match for him, and we can
easily tie him up and put him under the seat."</p>
<p>This cheerful bit of information was duly digested by Walter
Meriton, but he appeared quite engrossed in his papers. They
glanced at him sideways. It was evident he knew no German.</p>
<p>"And now to business," said the bigger man. "You have brought
them?"</p>
<p>"Two of them&mdash;in the bag," and he jerked his thumb toward
the rack.</p>
<p>"Good! Here is the plan."</p>
<p>He called it <i>eisenbahn fahrplan</i> in German, and he pulled
a printed paper from his pocket. Meriton gave one little glance
toward it, and set himself with a mighty effort to keep his
countenance. For he had instantly recognized it as the paper of
special working instructions for a train that was to run that
morning from St. Paul to Chicago, and which was to carry no less a
personage than the Governor of Montana, who, after a visit to the
Governor of Minnesota, was on his way to Chicago upon another
visit.</p>
<p>He might well recognize it, for he had helped to draw it up
himself and had dispatched copies of it to all the principal
offices along the line some days before. Somehow or other these men
had managed to get hold of a copy, and he guessed it meant
mischief.</p>
<p>Just a word or two as to these "special working instructions"
which are always issued when any excursions or special trains are
run. The train in question is carefully timed from start to finish
all along the route, not only the times of running through the
stations being put down for the guidance of the driver and station
masters, but also the principal signal cabins and other points on
the road.</p>
<p>Provision is also made for shunting ordinary trains into
"refuge" sidings to allow of the passing of the "special," while
instructions are carefully issued as to the number of coaches of
which the "special" is to be composed, and in the case of
governors, mayors, etc., traveling, the exact position of his
<i>salon</i> in the train is laid down.</p>
<p>High officials of the line always travel on such a train, and in
this case Meriton knew very well that David Cartwright, his own
particular "chief," had gone down to St. Paul by an early "special"
that morning in order to accompany the governor on his journey to
Chicago.</p>
<p>"Now then," said the bigger man, "we must find out the exact
time when our train is likely to pass this one," indicating the
special. "You see, it is timed to run through Evanston at 10:55.
Now, we don't stop at Evanston, but I have found out from the
'Working Timetable' that we are due there at 10:35. So, you see, it
will be about ten minutes or so the other side of Evanston. There's
a signal cabin called Pine Tree Box that the special passes at
10:42. That will be about the point where we shall cross it."</p>
<p>"We must keep the time carefully."</p>
<p>"Of course. And one of us must be looking out of the window down
the line. The Governor travels in the third <i>salon</i> from the
engine. We must have bombs ready in our hands and throw them in as
near as we can guess. It will have to be done in a second. I'll
throw from the center window, and you throw from the side one at
the same time. We'll have to break it first."</p>
<p>"How about this cursed Englishman?"</p>
<p>"I told you, we must tie him up. As for ourselves, well, we knew
the risk when we drew lots at the meeting. If our driver hears the
explosion and stops we must make a bolt of it. If not, we'll pull
the communication cord before we get to St. Paul&mdash;in a tunnel
if we can&mdash;and get clear as best we may."</p>
<p>Walter Meriton had taken in the whole situation, but his face
showed no signs of it. These men were about to make a desperate
attempt upon the governor's life by endeavoring to hurl a couple of
bombs into his <i>salon</i> as the trains passed each other.</p>
<p>Rapidly he reviewed the situation. There was a three-fold reason
for action. First, the governor was in danger; secondly, his
chief's life was at a like risk, and thirdly, there was the honor
of the company at stake.</p>
<p>Suddenly an inspiration struck him. It was more difficult than
ever now to appear perfectly oblivious of the other men, but by a
great effort he did so. He had his pocket case on his knee, and his
hands were holding the papers, upon which he was pretending to take
notes, apparently. He took a telegraph blank out of his pocket
case, taking care, as he did so, that his traveling companions
could not see, and quickly wrote these words:</p>
<p>"From St. Paul Express, 3824, C. Dynamitards in compartment.
Mean wreck Governor of Montana special. Stop train at
Evanston-Meriton."</p>
<p>Carelessly putting his hands in his pocket he took out four or
five coppers, wrapped them up in the telegraph form, held it in his
left hand, and prepared for action.</p>
<p>Then he looked out of the window. It was a clean run of six
miles to the next station, and the train would pass a signal cabin
on that side of the line in half a minute.</p>
<p>Then, as the train neared the box, he waved his arm up and down
with a peculiar motion, still keeping it out of the sight of the
two men, and glancing at the cabin. To his joy, the man was
standing at the open window.</p>
<p>Out flew the weighted bit of paper and fell by the side of the
line. The signalman put up his hand with a quick jerk. He had seen
it, and understood.</p>
<p>The next moment a violent blow struck upon the young man's head
from behind, and he fell senseless.</p>
<p>When he came to himself he found that he was lying on the hard
floor of the carriage. His hands and feet were firmly tied with
string and handkerchiefs, a bandage was over his eyes, and a gag
was fastened into his mouth. The train was still rushing along at
full speed.</p>
<p>"Better to have given him a few inches of knife," he heard the
shorter man growl.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's all right," said the other. "We've no quarrel against
him, and he can't do us any harm. Now, then, we're only a few miles
off Evanston, and there isn't any time to lose. Better get that
window smashed."</p>
<p>There was a crash of glass as his companion struck at the
quarterlight with his stick.</p>
<p>"Now, the bombs. Put them on the seat ready. That's right."</p>
<p>"Are we stopping?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;no! The man in the signal box is waving a green flag.
We are going on. No&mdash;no&mdash;we're stopping again. Lucky we
gagged the fool. Ah, we're going to step in the station. Curse it!
Keep still, my friend!"</p>
<p>Walter Meriton heard, understood and rejoiced. The next moment a
voice on the platform exclaimed:</p>
<p>"This is 3824, C!" and the lock clicked.</p>
<p>The villains were completely taken by surprise, as a couple of
policemen and a railway official dashed in. They tried to open the
other door and escape, but in vain. They were handcuffed before
they knew what had happened, and the railway official had opened
the bag.</p>
<p>"Bombs!" he exclaimed, "and a broken quarterlight. Going to
throw 'em at the special, that's it. Lucky we got the message in
time. Where's Mr. Meriton, though? I hope they haven't done for
him."</p>
<p>Then a form rolled out from under the seat, and Meriton got his
bonds off and his gag out. Directly he had done so he made the
captives a mocking speech in excellent German.</p>
<p>"Ach!" shouted the bigger of the two as he shook his handcuffed
fists. "I wish I had listened to Heinrich and killed you&mdash;you
pig!"</p>
<p>Meriton acknowledged the sentiment politely and the train went
on, leaving the prisoners behind.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>"Meriton," said the assistant superintendent, "the company won't
forget this. Neither shall I, for I owe you something personally
over it."</p>
<p>"Which I hope you'll pay, sir," said Meriton demurely.</p>
<p>"Eh? No, I told you the other day I make no personal favoritism
and I stick to that. But you've shown yourself a smart man, and
I'll give you a promise. When you've got your divisional
superintendentship you shall marry Evie. There!"</p>
<p>"And meanwhile?"</p>
<p>"Meanwhile? Oh, well, you're on the way to it. The G.M.'s got a
post for you over this affair. So&mdash;well&mdash;you'd better go
and make it all right with Evie, my lad. That's what you want, I
suppose, eh?"</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-12" id="ch-12"></a>THE ROMANCE OF THE "SOUTHERN
QUEEN":<br>
TOLD BY THE FIREMAN</h2>
<p>"Good morning, sir!"</p>
<p>"Why, good morning, Harry! I hardly knew you at first, and I
certainly didn't expect to see you here. How are you?"</p>
<p>"Very well, sir, thank you. I've just come off duty for a couple
of hours."</p>
<p>"I see. Are you a fireman still?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. I've passed as driver, but I haven't got an engine
yet. But that will come all in good time."</p>
<p>"That's right! I'm glad you're getting on. I hope you've a good
mate on the footplate?"</p>
<p>"Rather better than the last, sir, I'm thankful to say."</p>
<p>"Eh? What was the matter with him?"</p>
<p>"Well, it's rather a long story, sir, but if you've got half an
hour to spare perhaps you'd like to hear it?"</p>
<p>The above conversation took place on the platform of that
exceedingly bustling railway station, Portsmouth Town. The young
man who had accosted me was a fireman in the employ of one of our
southern railway companies running into that station, as one might
easily see by his smart, copper-mounted cap, a distinguishing
feature of the men on the footplate on that company's system. I had
known him when he was quite a lad, and, being always on the
look-out for railway adventures, was only too glad to be able to
pick up the following extraordinary story which he proceeded to
tell me, and which I relate as far as possible in his own words,
taking the liberty, however, of making them a little more
presentable to the reader.</p>
<p>There have been a few exciting stories from time to time on the
footplate, and I've noticed that the driver of an engine generally
comes in for the biggest share of the thing; but in the adventure
I'm going to tell you I fancy the fireman had the liveliest time of
it, and that fireman was myself. Soon after I was promoted to the
footplate of an express passenger engine it was my lot to serve
with Charles Davis, a driver who knew his work and could make as
good running out of his engine as any man I've met. He was a
youngish chap, too&mdash;not more than thirty-six&mdash;a quiet,
moody sort of fellow, and as strong as a Sandow. We were running
Brighton expresses then, and Davis was always at his best on the
down journey, for the simple reason that there was someone at the
end of the run for him to see when he chanced to get off duty. A
signal against him, or a slow down over a permanent-way operation,
would quite annoy Davis, because it meant something more than a few
minutes late on his time-sheet. That is to say, there was a certain
little personage dwelling at Brighton to whom the driver had given
his heart. I never thought very much of her myself. She was too
flippant for a man like Charles Davis&mdash;a fellow who took
things as a rule rather more seriously than he ought. But he simply
worshipped that blue-eyed, golden-haired little lass, and when at
length the day was fixed his joy knew no bounds.</p>
<p>"Only six weeks, mate," he said to me one day, as we bowled
along through the fresh green fields of Sussex, "and then she'll be
mine! <i>Mine</i>, just as sure as yonder signal shows a clear road
ahead!"</p>
<p>It was only a coincidence, but even as he uttered the words the
arm of the semaphore rose to danger. Anyhow, his face darkened as
he pulled the regulator over and laid hold of the Westinghouse
brake-handle. It was nothing&mdash;a mere momentary block on the
line somewhere ahead&mdash;and yet it seemed a nasty omen to his
speech.</p>
<p>The next day he was singularly silent on the up journey. Only
one or two remarks escaped him.</p>
<p>"Harry, mate, ye've got no girl, have ye?"</p>
<p>"Not yet."</p>
<p>"Take my advice and be careful, then. Woman's a rum machine, and
you can't regulate her running like you can a locomotive."</p>
<p>"Anything wrong, mate?" I ventured.</p>
<p>"No&mdash;not exactly. Only I shall be right glad when we're
married, for sometimes I get a bit jealous."</p>
<p>"Any cause to be?"</p>
<p>"Confound you, no!" he cried, turning sharply. "What makes you
think that?"</p>
<p>"Nothing&mdash;only what you said."</p>
<p>"Look here, mate, if I thought my girl had played me false
I'd&mdash;I'd go mad or die."</p>
<p>And he set his teeth with an ugly look as he gazed ahead through
the weather-glass.</p>
<p>Whether he had any suspicions or not I never knew, but when we
got back to Brighton that afternoon a terrible thing happened. A
permanent-way inspector who happened to be on the platform&mdash;a
tactless sort of man&mdash;came up to the engine, and, putting his
head inside the cab, exclaimed:</p>
<p>"This is a bad business about your girl, Davis. I'm downright
sorry for you!"</p>
<p>"What do you mean, man?" yelled the driver.</p>
<p>"What! don't you know? Why, she's bolted with Jimmy
Sparshot&mdash;married at a registry office only this morning. You
must have passed the train they went to town in on your way
down."</p>
<p>"My God! is this true?" gasped Davis.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry to say it is&mdash;here, hold up, man! Catch him,
Harry!"</p>
<p>For my mate had sunk all of a heap on the footplate. The shock
had been too much for him, and the end of it was a dangerous attack
of brain fever. Over three months passed before we stood on the
same footplate once more, and those three months had wrought a sad
change in poor Davis. He never once alluded to his trouble. He
drove his engine as well as ever, but he spoke but rarely, and
there was often a fixed expression in his eyes that I did not like
at all.</p>
<p>For several months we continued running the Brighton expresses,
and then a change came. Our locomotive superintendent had been
engaged for some time in planning and producing a new type of
engine for our line, and when the first of them was turned out of
the sheds there were murmurs of admiration. The new locomotive was
a four-wheel coupled engine with a leading bogie&mdash;the first
tender engine with a "bogie" that had been built for our
line&mdash;just the type of locomotive for our heaviest express
work.</p>
<p>Charles Davis was envied by many a driver when one of the first
of these new engines, named the "Southern Queen," was delivered
over to him, and I was not at all sorry to find myself still his
mate on the footplate of our brand-new steed. Our line has a
practice that might well be followed by others. The driver of an
engine has his name painted up in gilt letters inside the cab over
the regulator, and this gives him a pride in the special locomotive
that he drives, for there is no such thing as change and change
about, every man having his own particular engine.</p>
<p>Our run was altered now. We were detailed to bring the special
fast train from Portsmouth up to London Bridge in the morning,
returning in the afternoon. The run, which is a difficult one on
account of the many curves and gradients, had only one stop either
way&mdash;at Chichester. Davis and I both transferred our lodgings
from Brighton to Portsmouth, and prepared for our new duties.</p>
<p>I really thought that the fine locomotive to which Davis was
appointed would be the making of the man, it seemed to rouse him
from his lethargy so much. When I went down to the sheds on the
morning of the first trip I found him there before me, gazing with
admiration at the engine, which was standing over the pit.</p>
<p>"Now, isn't she a beauty, mate?" he asked me. "I've seen some
fine engines up on the Northern lines, but I'd rather be on the
footplate of this than any other I've come across. She's just fine!
And what a name&mdash;'Southern Queen'! It sounds like some
beautiful woman, doesn't it?"</p>
<p>When we drew up at the terminus after the run Davis was more
pleased than ever, declaring he'd never travelled so well before,
and talking of the "Southern Queen" with the most extravagant
praises.</p>
<p>We hadn't been doing this new running more than seven or eight
weeks before a peculiar change came over Charles Davis. I noticed
it first one day when we were hauled up for a minute by signals
just outside Epsom on the down journey. My mate began muttering. At
first I thought he was speaking to me, but it soon appeared he was
not. I listened, and caught the following: "I can't help
it&mdash;it's not my fault. I know you want to go on, my girl, but
it won't do till they let us. You'd hurt yourself else, and then
what should I do? Yes&mdash;ask them to let you go on. Speak to
them!"</p>
<p>And he blew the whistle. Another moment and the arm fell, and we
went on. I didn't think much more about it, but when we got to our
destination he began again.</p>
<p>"You can't help it, girl! I know you wanted to be in time; but
never mind! You're a bit tired to-night. Have a good rest, and
we'll make it up in the morning."</p>
<p>The next day it began again. I had just finished coaling up
somewhere past Amberley when Davis muttered:</p>
<p>"You mustn't mind him feeding you. You've mine, you know,
anyway. For don't you carry my name? Of course you do. They think
you're only 'Southern Queen,' but we know better&mdash;eh, Queenie
Davis? And you'll be true to nobody else but me, will you? You're
not one of the false ones. If you were, my girl, I'd murder
you&mdash;as I ought to have done the other! Yes, I'd do for you,
though you are my lawful wife and bear my name!"</p>
<p>I began to grasp the situation. Davis was imagining the
"Southern Queen" was his wife! I'd heard of men getting fond of
their engines before, but never such a thing as this. "Those were
rather queer things you were saying, mate," I remarked.</p>
<p>"Eh!" he cried, turning sharply upon me. "I suppose I can talk
to myself as much as I please without you interfering, can't I!
What does it matter to you?"</p>
<p>Then he broke into a loud laugh, and went on:</p>
<p>"Don't take any notice of me, Harry. I'm all right. If I say
silly things sometimes I don't mean 'em."</p>
<p>But I watched him narrowly, nevertheless. He was extremely odd
for the next few days, constantly addressing his engine with
endearing names, and rowing me up if I let the slightest handful of
coal-dust fall on the footplate. He'd be down in the sheds long
before the "Southern Queen" was ready to go out, and he'd watch the
cleaners with a jealous eye, and be loth to give her up to their
charge after a run. Once he complained that the coals were not good
enough for her; another time he bought a bottle of scent and
emptied it into the oil-can, declaring that "Queenie liked to have
something sweet about her"; and once I caught him kissing the
reversing gear, and afterwards caressing the pressure-gauge, which
he declared was "Queenie's pulse."</p>
<p>I thought the matter well over, and came to the conclusion that
I ought to tell those in authority that poor Davis was going mad. I
certainly should have done so, and I often wish I had, only my mate
met with a bit of an accident the very nest day. He was getting off
his engine when he stumbled and fell heavily, hurting his leg. The
result was that he had to go off duty and lay up for a fortnight.
During this period a driver named Simmonds was detailed to run the
"Southern Queen," while I, of course, kept my place on the
footplate. I went round to see Davis two or three times, and to my
surprise he never once alluded to his engine, only to remark one
Saturday night that he was well enough to sign on duty Monday
morning, and that I should see him at the sheds.</p>
<p>If I had hoped that his peculiar madness had come to an end I
was mistaken, for the sight of the "Southern Queen" was like a red
rag to a bull. He walked round her, got underneath her with his
oil-can, mounted the footplate and examined everything, muttering
more or less all the time. When we got off he suddenly blurted
out:</p>
<p>"Has she been running while I was laid up?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I answered.</p>
<p>"Who's been driving her?"</p>
<p>"Joe Simmonds."</p>
<p>"How dared he do it? Didn't he see my name before him?"</p>
<p>"Yes, of course he did, but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Then what right had he got to interfere with her, eh?"</p>
<p>"Why, of course, mate, he was&mdash;"</p>
<p>"There, don't talk to me!" he cried. "How would you like another
chap to run off with your wife? But she didn't go willingly, I'll
be bound&mdash;not like you're doing now, eh, Queenie?"&mdash;and
he took back another notch in the reversing gear. "See! she knows
her Charlie's with her! Hark at her! Oh, she's a beauty! Gently,
then, my girl, gently!"</p>
<p>When we were getting into London he turned round to me
again:</p>
<p>"How's she been running?"</p>
<p>"Splendidly! I never knew her in better trim, and Simmonds
understood her down to the ground."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Why, on Saturday we ran into Chichester over a minute under
time, and that after two dead stops for signals. I reckon, too, we
worked her on the up journey with a couple of hundredweight less
coal than usual."</p>
<p>The next moment I regretted having made these statements, for
Davis's face grew livid with rage.</p>
<p>"Is this what you're telling me true?" he yelled.</p>
<p>"Yes," I answered; "but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, the false jade! You've proved unfaithful! Simmonds? How
could you&mdash;you, with my name on you and nobody's hand on the
regulator except mine since the day I married you? You're like the
other one&mdash;false&mdash;false&mdash;false!"</p>
<p>"For God's sake, be careful, mate!"</p>
<p>"Ah!" he replied, with a smile. "Yes, it's only a silly bit of
foolishness. Have I frightened you, Harry? Don't notice me. We're
nearly in now. At any rate, we've run to time. Oh, she's a beauty,
ha! ha! ha!"</p>
<p>I confess I felt uncomfortable, and I secretly determined that
the afternoon journey should be the last I would take without
reporting him&mdash;in fact, I made up my mind to do so at
Portsmouth that very evening. It would have been well if I had seen
someone at the London terminus, but I was foolish enough to wait.
Hence the awful experience I am about to explain.</p>
<p>Our train was timed to leave London about five, and to run
through with only one stop&mdash;at Chichester. We got off
punctually enough. Davis was silent, and seemed to settle down to
his work quite steadily. The first intimation I had that anything
was wrong was when we were running round the Mitcham curve. We
ought to have slackened speed to twenty miles an hour, but we went
round at a good forty. I thought my mate had forgotten, and sprang
to the brake-handle; but he pushed me aside, crying:</p>
<p>"Leave her alone! We'll see who she goes best, for! Coal her
up&mdash;do you hear? I'll teach her to jilt me!"</p>
<p>We thundered through Sutton pretty safely. Then Davis went to
the tool-box and drew out a chisel.</p>
<p>"You've been false to your name, have you?" he yelled, with an
awful look upon his face. "We'll soon set that to rights, for you
sha'n't end your days with my name on you, you vixen!"</p>
<p>Then he deliberately set to work and scratched out the gold
letters of his name.</p>
<p>"Fire her up!" he shouted, turning to me.</p>
<p>"She doesn't want it yet," I replied.</p>
<p>"Never mind if she does or not! She'll have a good deal more
than she wants before we get to the journey's end, I reckon."</p>
<p>I put a couple of shovelfuls on. Then I opened the damper.</p>
<p>"Leave it alone!" said Davis.</p>
<p>"But the pressure's over 170," I remonstrated. "She ought to
blow off."</p>
<p>"She won't blow off&mdash;even if we go up to 200. I've screwed
up the safety-valve! See? We'll burst her or smash her
somehow&mdash;and don't you try to interfere, or I'll throw you
over! No you don't!"</p>
<p>For I had grasped the regulator and was trying to shut off
steam.</p>
<p>"You fool!" I cried; "there's a signal against us!"</p>
<p>"All the better, then! We'll smash up sooner! Curse it, the
road's clear again!"</p>
<p>Davis had gone raving mad! He howled with a wild delight as we
plunged into the Dorking tunnel. In less than a minute we were in
daylight again, and Davis was dancing on the footplate.</p>
<p>"Fire her up, curse you! She played me false, did she? Ha! ha!
ha! we'll all smash together! We'll drive to hell this journey! Did
she get up the incline faster than she's doing now? Have a drop of
tea, mate! Yes, you fool, this is the right sort of tea, eh?"</p>
<p>He had filled his tea-can with neat brandy!</p>
<p>"Hands off, or I'll murder you!" he hissed, as I tried to get
hold of the liquor. "Your health, Queenie! Success to your last
run! Ha! ha! ha!"</p>
<p>And he drained the contents of the can. This made him madder
than ever, of course. I grew sick and dizzy as we gained the
incline down to Horsham, but my demon companion kept me well at
work with his threats. As we flew through the station I glanced at
my watch. We were then just over five minutes before time. I turned
the matter over in my mind and thought of what was best to be done.
There was only one guard to our train in the rear brake-van, and
there was no chance of reaching him&mdash;only the possibility that
he might perhaps guess something was up and put the brake on. But
as Davis was one of our best and steadiest drivers, it was scarcely
probable that he would notice the advance in time yet. There was
only one way out of it to my mind, and that was to make a desperate
effort to master the madman. With this thought in view I made a
sudden dash at the regulator. He was too quick for me, and in a
moment I had his bony fingers round my throat, and he held me
against the side of the cab.</p>
<p>"Look here!" he cried, "I warned you once before not to
interfere with me, and now you'll have to take the consequences.
Listen! You and me and this wretch are running to destruction, and
there's going to be no way out of it. We'll go on till she bursts
or there's a smash, but there's no such thing as stopping. And you,
who could stand by and help Simmonds to run her&mdash;curse you,
you're as bad as she! You shall go first! Get off, I say, get
off!"</p>
<p>And he thrust me off the footplate on to the side-step. At first
I tried to get along the tender, but he stopped me.</p>
<p>"No, no, go in front&mdash;do you hear, in front! I'll push you
off altogether if you don't!"</p>
<p>I moved along the engine till I got in front of the cab, holding
on by the hand-rail. Suddenly I felt a stinging blow on my arm. The
brute was hurling lumps of coal at me!</p>
<p>"Go in front&mdash;right in front, I tell you! Go on, you
blackguard!"</p>
<p>There was no way out of it. He simply pelted me with huge lumps
of coal till I got round on to the little platform in front of the
smoke-box. I'd been there often enough before while she was
running, but I never felt as I did now. It was an evening in early
spring, and dusk was setting in as we dashed through Pulborough and
into the open, level country beyond. Above the roar of the engine I
could hear Davis yelling madly as every now and then we seemed to
give a fresh spurt forward.</p>
<p>I tried to reflect upon the situation. The road was clear as far
as the junction with the Brighton branch at Ford, where there might
be a block. Between Arundel and Ford there would be a fearful
curve, and it was doubtful if we should keep the metals with the
awful speed we were running at. Even if we did run round safely
there was bound to be a smash later on. It was an awful position to
be in. Once I tried to get back to the footplate; but Davis was on
the look-out, and directly I showed my head a big lump of coal came
whizzing by.</p>
<p>I half hoped some signalman might see us from his cabin and do
something, but, of course, it is no uncommon thing for a fireman to
go in front of the engine for a minute or two; and, even if he had
noticed that anything was wrong, he could not have stopped the
train. We were midway between Amberley and Arundel now, and it was
getting quite dark. I could just discern the outline of the castle
looming on the heights on our right, and in another minute we were
dashing through the station, in spite of the fact that there was a
<i>red light</i> flashing in our face from the home signal.</p>
<p>What did it mean? It meant that in all probability there was a
block ahead at the junction, and, if so, we were doomed. On we
rushed through the level country till I saw by the declining light
the rails ahead beginning to curve, and with a swing and a lurch we
commenced the dangerous piece of road. Ahead was another red light,
and just beyond the junction signal-box I saw with horror the glare
on the smoke from the open fire-box of an engine! Yes, there could
be no mistake, a goods train had left Ford Station and was
proceeding towards Brighton, crossing the very points we should be
rushing through in another minute or so. A frightful collision was
inevitable!</p>
<p>It was just at this awful moment that a plan of deliverance
flashed across me&mdash;so suddenly that I found myself acting
before I had time to think it out. It was this. Just in front of me
in the centre of the buffer-plate was the pipe of the Westinghouse
brake, used, of course, only when the engine was running tender
first. This pipe was closed by a cock, well within reach. Now, by
simply turning this cock the compressed air would be free to act
<i>throughout the train</i>, and the brake would be applied to
every wheel from the cylinders beneath the coaches. This is the
simple meaning of the "automatic brake." If the pipe snaps or
becomes disconnected the brake is applied at once, the driver
having no power to prevent it. I ought to have thought of this
before, but even now it was not too late.</p>
<p>Throwing myself down on the narrow platform I grasped the pipe,
holding on with all my might, for the motion was frightful. Then I
turned the cock. There was a hiss and a jar and a terrible grinding
as every wheel throughout the train was suddenly braked. I heard
Davis yell with fury. The steam hissed from the cylinders, but its
power was mastered. With a fearful rattle and jolt the train slowed
down&mdash;and then stopped! I shall never forget it! Only three
yards from the junction points at the moment when the goods train
crossed in front of us&mdash;three yards, that was all the distance
between safety and death!</p>
<p>I sprang down into the six-foot-way, and the madman was after me
in a moment. But it was useless. The guard and half a dozen
passengers came rushing along and soon pulled him off me, though it
was no easy matter to hold him while I climbed to the footplate and
shut the regulator.</p>
<p>"Get off!" he yelled. "She's doomed to die, I tell you! She ran
off with another man, and we're both going to hell together. Let me
get at her!"</p>
<p>But strong hands carried him along to the guard's van. I brought
the train slowly into Ford, and was thankful to find a spare
fireman there, who came on with me for the remainder of the
journey. Fortunately, Davis had not damaged the engine, though he
had let the water run down very low, and very probably if I hadn't
have turned on the injector at once we might have had a bad
business.</p>
<p>The end of it all was that Charles Davis was put into an asylum,
but the poor fellow died shortly afterwards, mad till the last, and
mixing up his first love with the "Southern Queen." I had to go off
duty for over a week, for I was quite knocked under after that
awful ride with a mad driver and hairbreadth escape from a terrible
death.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-13" id="ch-13"></a>IN A TIGHT FIX</h2>
<p>We were strolling through the Paris Salon. Tired of passing
through endless galleries and gazing at the pictures, we had
descended into the great central hall devoted to statuary, where it
is permissible to smoke, and had lit our cigarettes. My companion
was only a passing acquaintance, a fellow-countryman I had met at
the <i>table d'hte</i>, and who, like myself, was passing a few
weeks in the French metropolis. He was a slight, delicate-looking
young man of about five-and-twenty, a well-read and charming
companion. As we entered the hall, with its long rows of statues, I
noticed that he turned a little pale, but put it down to the heat
of the day. Presently we stopped to admire a gracefully-modelled
figure by one of the most eminent exhibitors..."A very fine piece
of sculpture," said my friend.</p>
<p>"Scarcely that," I replied. "It's made out of an appropriate
material&mdash;plaster of Paris."</p>
<p>"Plaster of Paris!" he replied, with a nervous start; "how
terrible!"</p>
<p>"Why, what's the matter?" I asked, with a laugh.</p>
<p>"Ah!" he replied, "I daresay my exclamation seemed strange to
you. But plaster of Paris has an awful meaning to my ears, as you
would agree if you heard of an adventure from the effects of which
I am only just recovering."</p>
<p>"Have you any objection to telling me?"</p>
<p>"Not the slightest. Come and sit down over yonder, and I'll
explain myself; then you'll see why I hate the name of plaster of
Paris."</p>
<p>So we sat down and he began his story, which I repeat in his own
words as far as possible.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Jasper Keen and myself were chums during the year we were
together at Oxford, and our friendship continued after he had gone
down through the two years I remained. He was my senior&mdash;three
or four years older than myself; and, as is generally the case in
strong friendships, my opposite in many respects. I was a reading
man; Keen was more noted for the strength of his arm on the river,
and as a desperate "forward" in the footer field. My temper was
always one of the mildest; Keen would give vent to paroxysms of
anger, and weeks of smothered, revengeful passion. He was a tall,
magnificently-built fellow, and the men often called us the "long
and short of it," so great was the contrast between us.</p>
<p>I do not say that there was nothing intellectual about Jasper
Keen. On the contrary, he was a genius; only, like most of his
species, he worked by fits and starts. When he did work, however,
it was to some purpose, as the examiners knew. And with all his
great strength and passion for sport he had a very marked artistic
temperament, which showed itself in his love of sculpture and
modelling. His rooms were a curiosity. Very few books&mdash;he
always sold them the instant he had finished reading
them&mdash;prize oars and "pots" in profusion, and a collection of
clay busts, modelled by himself. There was a row of college Dons on
his mantelshelf, clever caricatures, his intimate friends&mdash;and
his enemies. If he liked a man, he made an excellent little bust of
him; on the contrary, one who incurred his hatred was modelled in
some eccentric or repulsive manner, but still with strict regard to
a correct likeness so that it was impossible to mistake the
man.</p>
<p>When Jasper Keen left the 'Varsity he set up a studio in London.
He was a man of fairly large private means, and did not care about
earning money. He devoted himself still to sport during the
intervals when he was not exercising his hobby, and lived a
generally easy and comfortable life.</p>
<p>In due time I also went to live in town, and plunged into the
vortex of literary work, to which I had determined to devote my
life. I constantly saw Keen, and our friendship was as great as
ever, until&mdash;</p>
<p>Yes, "until"&mdash;you guess what I mean. There was a woman in
it, as there always is, and she stepped in between us. Jasper Keen
loved her madly, jealously. Over and over again he was repulsed,
for Ivey Stirling never cared for him. He frightened her with the
intensity of his devotion. One day he said to her:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The truth is, you care for another man."</p>
<p>"And what if I do?" said Ivey, boldly.</p>
<p>"What if you do! Why, this. If I find the man, even if he were
my greatest friend, I'd kill him rather than he should win
you!"</p>
<p>He <i>was</i> Keen's greatest friend. The man who was accepted
by Ivey Stirling was myself, and, in spite of all, I trust she will
be my wife before the year is out.</p>
<p>I may well say, "In spite of all." When Keen heard of it, he was
furious. I told him myself. I thought it best that he should hear
the news first from the lips of his friend, and I hoped from the
bottom of my heart that our friendship would not be destroyed. So I
went round to his studio and broke the news to him.</p>
<p>He stood for some moments with his whole frame quivering, his
nostrils dilated, and his eyes starting forward, like some wild
beast held in restraint by a chain. Then he turned to a pedestal on
which stood a bust of myself, fashioned by him in the old Oxford
days, and dashed it to the ground. The fragments of clay went
rattling over the studio.</p>
<p>"Leonard Fendron," he yelled, "as I have broken your bust, so
will I break you. You false, traitorous hound, you think you have
stolen from me the one object I have to live for. But not
yet&mdash;do you hear? I could crush you as you stand&mdash;I could
break every bone in your body with this hand of mine. But that
would be too poor a revenge. I will wait&mdash;I will make you
suffer such agony as you have given me. Go, I say, go, and may the
worst of all curses light upon you&mdash;the curse of a friend you
have wronged."</p>
<p>It was useless to explain, so I went. Ivey was much disturbed
when I told her about this interview; but to tell the truth, I
thought little of it myself. I had seen Keen in a paroxysm of rage
before, and I hoped that in time he would see things sensibly for
the sake of our old friendship.</p>
<p>For a year I never saw the man. His studio was shut up, and
report said that he had gone abroad. Then I suddenly met him face
to face in Fleet Street. I was going to pass him by at first, but
he stopped me and shook hands.</p>
<p>"How d'ye do, Fendron?" he said. "Last time I saw you I was in a
bit of a temper. But that's all over now, and I can afford to let
the past be buried in the past&mdash;if you can too."</p>
<p>"Certainly," I replied; "I'm only too delighted to hear our
friendship still exists."</p>
<p>"That's right," he said. "And now come and have some lunch with
me. There's a restaurant handy where we can talk."</p>
<p>So I went with him. He was most friendly and chatty. He told me
he had been abroad, but that the last five months he had spent in
England.</p>
<p>"I've been living like a hermit," he said. "The fact is, I'm
engaged on a master-piece of work. It will beat anything I've ever
done. Oh, it's a grand thing, I can tell you. I fitted up a studio
in the country some months ago, and I've hardly stirred out of it
since&mdash;simply worked and seen no one. But I've had an end in
view, as you shall see for yourself. Now, I want you to pay me a
visit, and you shall be the first to see my masterpiece. Will you
come?"</p>
<p>"Certainly," I said; "what day will suit you?"</p>
<p>"Let me see&mdash;it's the 9th to-day. I want a clear fortnight
on the work before I finish. Can you come on Friday, the 24th, and
stay till Monday? I can easily put you up."</p>
<p>"With pleasure. That will suit me capitally. Only, you haven't
told me where to come to yet."</p>
<p>"I hardly think you'd find it if I did," he answered,
thoughtfully; "it's not very far from town, but it's a bit awkward
to get at for a stranger. So suppose you meet me at Euston at
half-past eight on that Friday evening, and I'll take you down.
It's rather late, but you shall have a good supper as soon as you
get there, I promise you."</p>
<p>To this arrangement I accordingly agreed, and on the 24th I met
Keen at Euston. Telling me that he had purchased my ticket, he took
me to a local train. We got out at Sudbury, the station near
Wembley Park.</p>
<p>"There's some little distance to walk," he said, "so we'd better
step it out briskly."</p>
<p>It must have been a tramp of over two miles that finally brought
us to a large house, standing quite alone a little way off the
road, somewhere in the direction of Edgware. Although not many
miles from London, the country about here is very lonely, and there
was not a house near. It was about ten o'clock and quite dark when
Keen opened the door with a latch-key.</p>
<p>"Welcome!" he cried. "You must be tired and hungry. We'll have
supper at once, it's all ready."</p>
<p>And without further ado he led the way into a good-sized room,
lit by a lamp, and revealed a table spread with cold viands.</p>
<p>There was a change in his tone of voice that made me feel rather
uneasy as he went on:&mdash;</p>
<p>"We're all to ourselves, Fendron. I've let the servants out for
the evening. But everything's ready for us, so sit down and begin.
We must be our own butlers."</p>
<p>It was an excitable meal. The whole of the time Keen talked and
laughed and joked. He ran on about old times and our college days;
he laughed long and boisterously&mdash;once I expostulated with him
for his noise.</p>
<p>"What does it matter?" he shouted. "There's not a soul near.
That's the beauty of the country. You might yell yourself hoarse in
this shanty of mine, and no one would hear you."</p>
<p>He even touched on my engagement. Leaning across the table, he
insisted upon grasping my hand.</p>
<p>"I've never congratulated you yet, old chap, you know. Last time
we were on this subject I was in a huff. But it's all right now.
May you be happy&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;as happy as you
deserve!"</p>
<p>Supper over, he took up the lamp.</p>
<p>"Come," he said, "we'll adjourn to the studio and smoke there.
I've got to show you my great work. It will surprise you. Come
along."</p>
<p>He led the way to the very top of the house, and we entered a
large room which he had turned into a studio. Lumps of clay, pieces
of stone, tools, and half-finished works were lying about in
artistic confusion. On a small table was a box of cigars, several
decanters of wine and spirits, siphons and tumblers. In one corner
of the room was a large bath, filled with a white powder, while a
small shovel and a couple of pails of water stood by it. In the
centre of the room was a very large, hollow wooden pedestal, shaped
like a cylinder, and quite as high as my shoulders, such as is used
sometimes for standing heavy busts upon. The top, however, had been
removed from this cylinder, and there was nothing on it. The room
was evidently only lighted by a skylight, and a thick curtain hung
over the door, and stretched across what was apparently a recess at
the farther end of the apartment was another curtain, hanging in
black folds.</p>
<p>Keen gave me a cigar and sat me down in a chair.</p>
<p>"Well, what do you think of my workshop?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I've hardly had time to look round, yet," I replied. "What's
that huge pedestal for?"</p>
<p>"You'll see later on," he said.</p>
<p>Again that ominous change in his voice.</p>
<p>"And what's in that bath?"</p>
<p>"Oh! plaster of Paris," he answered, with a laugh; "but now,
watch! I'm going to draw the curtain!"</p>
<p>First lighting a couple more lamps, he drew the curtain aside
with a sudden jerk. The result was electrical. There, standing on a
small raised plat form, life-size and most exquisitely modelled,
was a statue of Ivey Stirling, my betrothed. I sprang to my feet
and uttered an exclamation of surprise.</p>
<p>"Yes," shouted Keen, "there stands the image of the woman you
love&mdash;and the woman I loved once. She whose image was so
graven upon my heart that I was able to mould this statue as you
see it; to mould it for you, Leonard Fendron, who have won the
prize. Did I not tell you it was a master-piece?"</p>
<p>"You did. And so it is," I replied, with an indescribable
feeling of terror creeping over me. My companion rushed to the
table and filled two glasses. One of them he thrust into my
hand.</p>
<p>"A health!" he cried. "Drain it to the dregs. A health to the
fair Ivey, your betrothed! Drink it, Fendron!"</p>
<p>"A health to the fair Ivey&mdash;my future wife," I said,
mechanically, drinking the liquor and gazing at the statue.</p>
<p>"Your future wife!" echoed Keen, with a terrible voice. "Never!"
I turned and gazed at him. He was foaming with madness and rage. At
the same moment my head grew dizzy, and the room seemed twirling
round. I made a wild rush for the door, but fell in a dead faint
before I could reach it.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>When I came to my senses again there was an awful feeling of
cramp all over me. My whole body with my legs and arms seemed to be
held in a vice that was pressing upon me at every point. I opened
my eyes. The first thing that met my gaze was the statue of Ivey
placed opposite me. I was in an upright position, but I could not
move. I looked downwards, but not even then did I realize the
horrible truth. I was up to my shoulders in the hollow pedestal.
"Halloa! you've come to, have you?" said a mocking voice, and
Jasper Keen stood in front of me, the grin of a lunatic on his
face.</p>
<p>"For God's sake, what have you done?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I'll very soon tell you," he replied, with a sneer; "I've made
a statue of you. Listen. You are up to your shoulders in plaster of
Paris. Whilst you were insensible from the effects of that drugged
wine you drank I placed you in the pedestal, mixed that bathful of
plaster and water, and poured it in with you. It took me some time
to do, and it's now four o'clock in the morning. By this time it's
thoroughly set, and you cannot move hand or foot."</p>
<p>The terrible situation was dawning upon my mind. My tormentor
went on:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Did you think, Leonard Fendron, that I had forgotten? Did you
expect to get a forgiveness from Jasper Keen? You should have known
me better, and not have walked so foolishly into the snare that I
set for you. I told you I would have revenge. I have waited and
schemed a long time, but now the hour of my vengeance has come.
Here, before the image of the woman you love, you shall die,
Leonard Fendron&mdash;die a slow and an awful death. I shall leave
you here, fixed, immovable&mdash;a living statue. Don't think to
escape, for I have planned it well. My servants were dismissed two
days ago; I told them I was going to leave the house for some
months. You can shriek and howl as much as you please, but no one
will hear you. I've tested that carefully. In short, unless an
angel from Heaven comes to set you free, here you'll stay till you
starve to death in cramp and agony."</p>
<p>"Have mercy&mdash;" I began, but he stopped me.</p>
<p>"Mercy? As soon expect to find it at Satan's hands! Here, I'll
put this table with the liquor on it close to you. It will be more
tantalizing. And now I must be off. I've planned my escape well.
Good-bye, Leonard Fendron. I wish you joy with your bride of
clay!"</p>
<p>And the madman, for so he was, I am assured, at that moment
struck me a heavy blow in the face, turned on his heel, slammed the
door, and I heard his footsteps disappear down the stairs. I was
alone and helpless.</p>
<p>I cannot describe the torture as the long hours went by and the
light of the lamps slowly faded as the day began to dawn. The cramp
in my body and limbs was awful, my throat was parched, and my brain
seemed on fire. I yelled and screamed at the top of my voice,
listening in anguish for an answering call, but answers came there
none. The villain had prepared his plot too well! In my madness I
tried to lurch forward and hurl myself to the floor. In vain! The
pedestal was fixed! And there, a few feet in front of me, stood the
statue of Ivey, so lifelike and beautiful that it seemed at times
to my frenzied brain that she was smiling and speaking to me. Then
came a time when all was dark. I had fainted. Too soon I returned
to the fearful reality, and redoubled my screams. It was fruitless.
I was in a mental and bodily agony that was too awful for words.
How the hours passed I knew not. It seemed years that I had been
fixed there. I seemed never to have lived at all, except in a world
of terror.</p>
<p>My God! I cannot describe the anguish...</p>
<p>Suddenly there came a sound...Yes...I was not mistaken...A heavy
bang on the roof over-head. I listened with straining
ears&mdash;ah&mdash;a footstep!</p>
<p>"For God's sake, help&mdash;help!" I cried.</p>
<p>Then there came a tap at the skylight over-head, and a voice
spoke:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Excuse me, but may I come in?"</p>
<p>"Come in!" I shrieked; "in Heaven's name yes, come in!"</p>
<p>"You seem in a mighty hurry," replied the voice. "Suppose you
open the skylight for me."</p>
<p>"I can't," I answered; "smash it&mdash;do what you
like&mdash;only be quick."</p>
<p>Crash! the glass came spattering down on the floor, a foot came
through the window, then another, and in a few seconds the man
himself stood before me.</p>
<p>"Well, I'm blowed!" he exclaimed; "what on earth does this
mean?"</p>
<p>"For God's sake be quick and set me free," I begged. "It's
killing me. Give me something to drink first."</p>
<p>I eagerly drained the tumbler of soda-water he held to my lips.
Then he set to work. He was a businesslike man, and there were some
stone-chisels and hammers about. In a very few minutes he had split
the pedestal down, and was hammering and chipping away at the
plaster, which, of course, by this time was quite hard, and came
off in flakes and lumps. It seemed ages to me, but he afterwards
told me it took him a very short time to get me free, though large
lumps of plaster still stuck to my clothes. I was horribly cramped,
and could not stir when it was over. He undressed me and gave me a
tremendous rubbing, until at length the circulation became
partially restored and the agony began to subside, and I was able
to talk.</p>
<p>"Well," he exclaimed, "this is the rummiest thing I've ever come
across. Goodness only knows what would have happened to you if my
parachute hadn't gone wrong."</p>
<p>"Your parachute?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;that's how I came here. I'm a professional aeronaut,
and I've been making a balloon ascent and a parachute descent at
Wembley Park every Saturday afternoon for a couple of months
past."</p>
<p>"And you landed on the roof?" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Exactly. Something went wrong, and I found myself coming down
more quickly than I intended. The wind's a bit high and blew me
some distance, and I thought I was going smash against this house,
but, as luck had it, I just managed to tumble on the roof, which,
luckily, is flat, and here I am. Lucky for you, wasn't it?"</p>
<p>Keen's words had come very nearly true. He had said that only an
angel from Heaven could rescue me!</p>
<p>Well, little remains to be told. I was very ill for weeks; in
fact, I am only just getting over it now. The only wonder is that I
escaped as I did, but as Keen had put me in the pedestal with my
clothes on, and had not pressed down the plaster, the pressure was
slighter than it might have been, though that was bad enough.</p>
<p>As for Keen himself, he got clean away. You see, he had over
twelve hours' start, for it was not until late on Saturday
afternoon that the aeronaut found me. I don't know, and I don't
much care, what has become of him. I only mean to take good care
that he doesn't have another chance of stopping our marriage.</p>
<p>And now, perhaps, you will understand why I feel a little queer
at the mention of plaster of Paris.</p>
