  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">CHAPTER I<br>
  "See here, Jim, you quit the British army!"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">D'you remember Mark Twain's advice to read the Bible? It's
  good. There's one verse in particular in Genesis that quotes old Israel's
  dying words.</p>

  <p>He says to his son Joseph&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt."</p>

  <p>To my mind that sums up Egypt perfectly.</p>

  <p>No sensible man can blame the Israelites for wanting to get away. It
  charms you for a while, but leaves you wondering why; and there's a sting in
  all of Egypt's favors just as surely as there's a scorpion or an adder
  underneath the first stone you turn, and a hidden trick in every bargain.</p>

  <p>Like old Israel, I'd rather my carcass were disposed of almost anyhow than
  buried in Egypt's finest mausoleum. But it isn't bad fun all the same to sit
  on the big front veranda of Shepheard's Hotel in Cairo and watch the world go
  by. Sooner or later all trails cross at Cairo. It's a sort of adventurers'
  Clapham Junction.</p>

  <p>James Schuyler Grim, Jeremy Ross, and Narayan Singh were with me in 1920,
  and Cairo was complaining bitterly that she hadn't a tourist to rob. All of
  us except Narayan Singh sat at a little table in the corner of Shepheard's
  Hotel veranda, with Jeremy bubbling jokes at intervals and none of us knowing
  what would happen next.</p>

  <p>My friend Narayan Singh had borrowed a five-pound note from me and broken
  his rule of only getting drunk once in three months. His periodical debauch
  wasn't due for six or eight weeks&mdash;which was why I had dared to lend him
  money&mdash;but we had found his bedroom empty that morning of everything
  except an equally empty whisky bottle. He had even put the furniture out of
  the window, possessed by some distorted notion of getting even with the world
  for old wrongs, and we neither knew what had become of him, nor dared
  inquire.</p>

  <p>He might be standing stark naked on top of the Pyramid, delivering a
  lecture on Swadeshi to the kites. Or he might be trying to invade a harem,
  proclaiming himself the deliverer of lost princesses. Basing conjecture
  solely on past occurrences, he was possibly at that minute storming the house
  of the High Commissioner, flourishing sheets of scribbled paper, wearing no
  trousers; and demanding to be washed in wine. He was certainly being bold,
  probably prayerful, and perhaps using scandalous language; but subject to
  those provisos there was no limit to what he might be doing.</p>

  <p>The one sure thing was that we were his friends and would hear of it, if
  he should fall foul of the authorities. And the one best bet was not to call
  official attention to ourselves or him meanwhile. We weren't going to leave
  Narayan Singh in the lurch, for he was a man and a brother who had risked his
  neck with us; but we should have been idiots to go about asking for him at
  the moment. So we sat still and refused to worry, while Jeremy exploded jokes
  until he suddenly grew deadly serious and turned his fire on Grim.</p>

  <p>"See here, Jim," he said, tossing his head to get the chestnut hair out of
  his eyes. "You quit the British Army!"</p>

  <p>"Why?" demanded Grim, looking calmly at him, unastonished.</p>

  <p>You never are astonished at anything Jeremy says or does, once you've
  known him for a few days.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you why. I know the British Army. They'll serve you the same
  they served us Anzacs every time after a war was won&mdash;kick you and tell
  you to go to Hell. Got any money? No! Got a profession? No! Can you write
  signs&mdash;shear sheep&mdash;shave lumbermen&mdash;sell canned
  goods&mdash;cook for a fourpenny buster outfit? Those are the chaps who don't
  have to worry when the job slips out from under them. Can you splice wire
  rope, or ballyhoo the greenhorns outside a one-ring circus in a bush town?
  No! And you'll starve, when the British Army's through with you! There you
  sit, waiting for a red-necked swab with gold lace on his collar and the rim
  of a monocle eating the skin of his nose to tell you you're fired!"</p>

  <p>Grim laughed.</p>

  <p>"D'you think it's as bad as that, Jeremy?"</p>

  <p>"It's worse! I've seen your sort&mdash;sacked from the army to cover a bad
  break made by some sore-bags in an armchair. They come to Australia in
  shoals. Sydney and Melbourne are lousy with them. Most of 'em would suicide
  if they weren't too proud to steal a gun. They end by joining the Salvation
  Army and calling with a can from house to house for swill and spud-peel! You
  grin&mdash;good lord! With that in front of you!"</p>

  <p>"Don't you think I could land a job out here as interpreter or something?"
  Grim suggested pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"You've a better chance of a contract to serve ice-cream in Hell! You one-
  track Yankee visionary! You're so dead set on cleaning up Arabia that you
  can't see daylight for the dust you've made. For the love of luck, think a
  minute. Will they fire you for knowing too much, and let you stay here in the
  country? Golly! I'll tell you exactly what's going to happen. The French
  Ambassador will tell the King of England to roll his hoop, and the Prince o'
  Wales will be sent to deputize. He'll apologize for your having saved the
  French from doing worse dirt than they did to Feisul; and Downing Street will
  be so bull-angry at having to know of your existence that they'll grease the
  cables and suspend all other business until you're cashiered in disgrace.
  You'll be kicked through your headstall, they'll be in such a hurry! It'll
  be: 'Out o' the country quick! No recommendation. No pension. Your back pay
  held up for a year in case of possible claims against you. Watch your step on
  the way out, and don't ever let us see your face again!' The U.S. consul will
  refuse to ship you to the States because you aren't a distressed seaman. The
  British won't ship you anywhere because you're not British. And in the end
  you'll have to do exactly what you might do now, if you'd listen to
  sense!"</p>

  <p>"Sing on, Cassandra!" Grim laughed.</p>

  <p>"Who the Hell's Cassandra?" demanded Jeremy.</p>

  <p>"A lady in ancient Troy, who got out the Evening News."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm no lady. Jim, you fire the British Empire before it fires you!
  Write out your resignation and file it, with compliments, before the French
  Ambassador has time to ring the front-door bell at Windsor Castle! If they
  ask you what for, tell 'em the War's over; maybe they don't know it!"</p>

  <p>"I'd still be out of a job," Grim suggested.</p>

  <p>"Join Ramsden and me. Grim, Ramsden, and Ross. Thirty-three and a third
  per cent. apiece of kicks as well as ha'pence. We'll take along Narayan Singh
  as office murderer. What do you say?"</p>

  <p>Grim cocked one bushy eyebrow.</p>

  <p>"I've got no money, so I can't buy into your firm, old scout. That's all
  about it."</p>

  <p>Jeremy thrust out his jaw, and drummed his fingers on the table. "I've a
  draft for two thousand pounds in my pocket, and I don't know how much in the
  bank in Sydney. Haven't been home for five years and the bank may have
  busted, but I guess not. Rammy here's been saving two thirds of his income
  ever since pa died. Never mind what Rammy says at the moment, he'll put in
  two pounds to my one; take my word for it. We'll make you senior partner,
  Jim, 'cause you're the one who'll get the worst of it if we lose out, so
  you'll be cautious. Rammy can do the hard work; I'll think up ideas. I know
  millions of ways of making money."</p>

  <p>That was the first I had heard of any such partnership, but I made no
  comment, for a man had come up the front steps whom I hadn't seen for years,
  but whom I have crossed two oceans more than once to have a talk with&mdash;a
  man of about my own size but twenty years older, upstanding and hale, without
  a gray hair on his head, although carrying rather more stomach than I would
  care to tote around. He saw me, smiled, and nodded, but turned to the left,
  choosing a table at the other end of the veranda, where he buried himself at
  once behind a newspaper.</p>

  <p>"Wake up, Rammy!" said Jeremy, kicking my shin under the table. "Tell him
  you'll kill him if he don't come in with us! Tell him it's true that you've
  got capital. Go on!"</p>

  <p>"It's true that I've saved something," I answered. "But a man's a fool who
  risks his savings. I'd like a partnership with you and Grim, if you've a
  prospect; but we ought to be able to work it without staking both capital and
  energy. There are lots of men with capital."</p>

  <p>"Not in Egypt," said Jeremy. "All they'll buy here is manicure sets and
  big expensive cars. We're selling guts and gumption. We'd find ten Gyppies in
  five minutes to stake money for a crooked deal, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Suppose you argue a while with Grim," I answered. "I'll go talk with
  Meldrum Strange."</p>

  <p>"Who the Hell's Meldrum?"</p>

  <p>"One of the nine richest men in the world. I made a million for him once.
  Wherever Meldrum Strange is, something's doing. He's on the level, but a
  durned hard nut."</p>

  <p>"Go crack him!" answered Jeremy. "I'll stay here and comb Jim out of the
  army like a louse out of a dog's hair. So long."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">CHAPTER II<br>
  "We three now haven't a parasite between us."</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I sat down beside Meldrum Strange without saying anything
  and it wasn't until the chair creaked under my weight that he laid the
  newspaper down.</p>

  <p>"Oh, hello," he said then.</p>

  <p>"Hello yourself," said I. "How's business?"</p>

  <p>"I've gone out of business."</p>

  <p>I looked hard at him and he at me. He was good to look at, with a face
  carved out of granite and a neat black beard. There was a suggestion of
  Ulysses Grant, with the same look of good humor balancing an iron will.</p>

  <p>"I've come all the way from the States to see you," he said.</p>

  <p>"Nothing else?"</p>

  <p>"Just that," he answered, biting the end of a dark cigar.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe you," I answered, "but I'll smoke while you elaborate the
  fiction."</p>

  <p>"You're going out of business too," he said, passing me his leather
  case.</p>

  <p>"I did that during the first year of the War," I answered. "Cleaned up in
  Abyssinia and quit for keeps."</p>

  <p>"Uh. Who was behind that Abyssinian thing? You put it up to me. Cohn and
  Campbell fell, didn't they? Make anything?"</p>

  <p>"Three times what they put in."</p>

  <p>"Uh. What did you get?"</p>

  <p>"Enough," I answered.</p>

  <p>He nodded and began chewing his cigar.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said presently, "I heard you were wandering in these parts.
  Tried to reach you by cable, but you'd left no address."</p>

  <p>"Any banker out here would have delivered a message sooner or later," I
  answered, puzzled. I'm not used to being in such demand.</p>

  <p>"I daresay. Nothing to keep me in Chicago. Came to look for you&mdash;P
  &amp; O from Marseilles. Saw your name on the hotel register."</p>

  <p>"Did you ask for me?"</p>

  <p>"No. No hurry. Met some people. Up at Government House. Seems you've been
  trying your hand at international politics?"</p>

  <p>"I've a friend who was interested. Helped him," I said.</p>

  <p>"Did you like it?" he asked suddenly, looking sharply at me.</p>

  <p>"You bet! We spiked a crooked game and pulled a good man out of a tight
  place."</p>

  <p>"I'm in that game nowadays," he said.</p>

  <p>He took hold of his chin in his left hand and eyed me steadily.</p>

  <p>"Can you afford to be independent?"</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"Got enough, eh? Good. Couldn't use a man who thought he needed money
  badly."</p>

  <p>"What's eating you?" I asked. "The only time I handled your dollars you
  had me bonded."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't get a bond to cover this. Need a man used to acting on his own
  responsibility, not given to talking&mdash;be depended on to keep important
  secrets&mdash;act coolly in emergency&mdash;knows the world in the widest
  sense&mdash;willing to have no other ambition than to unknot the
  international snarls. You'll fill the bill."</p>

  <p>"You're wrong," I said. "My gifts are mechanical. You need a man with
  brains for a job like that. James Schuyler Grim is the man for you."</p>

  <p>"Ah. Now let me see; they mentioned Grim&mdash;Major Grim, isn't he?
  American? Um-m-m. What do you know of him?"</p>

  <p>"How d'you rate my opinion?"</p>

  <p>"Ace-high, or I wouldn't have gone to this trouble to find you."</p>

  <p>"I rate Grim ace-high plus, or I wouldn't have gone to Damascus with him
  on any such risky business," I answered.</p>

  <p>"What else can you say for him?"</p>

  <p>"The British Government thought highly enough of him to keep him in their
  Intelligence Department, while they were retrenching in every direction."</p>

  <p>"Expects the sack now, does he?"</p>

  <p>"Jeremy is trying to persuade him to resign."</p>

  <p>"Who's Jeremy?"</p>

  <p>"Jeremy Ross&mdash;Australian. Knows Arabic as well as Grim does. Kidnaped
  in the War and carried off into the heart of Arabia. Made good.
  Escaped&mdash;gathered a following&mdash;led them the whole length of
  Arabia&mdash;discovered a gold-mine&mdash;worked it&mdash;dollied out more
  than two thousand pounds&mdash;made himself a power in the land&mdash;and was
  finally rescued by Grim and me with the help of Narayan Singh and some Arabs.
  Made a present of his mine to Feisul the other day, as a private contribution
  to the Arab cause."</p>

  <p>"Um-m-m. Mine any good?"</p>

  <p>"Best I ever saw."</p>

  <p>"Gave it to the Arabs, eh? Who's Narayan Singh?"</p>

  <p>"Sikh. Friend of Grim's. Sepoy in the British Army. On a bat just
  now&mdash;discouraged."</p>

  <p>"Broke?"</p>

  <p>"Not while I've a nickel left."</p>

  <p>"How long have you been acting banker to broken men?" Meldrum Strange
  demanded, looking at me curiously.</p>

  <p>"Nothing to it," I answered. "But I'll back a good man when he's down the
  same way you helped the market in the 1907 panic. Maybe it'll pay me, same as
  buying stocks paid you. If it don't I'll take my loss, and you won't be any
  the wiser, Meldrum Strange."</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary!" he said. "Most extraordinary! World full of coincidences.
  Time was I'd have doubted this. Looks too good."</p>

  <p>"Same here," I said. "Few things fit without blacksmith-work and blasting.
  Study this right carefully before you submit proposals. We'd hate to let you
  down."</p>

  <p>" 'We?' " he asked.</p>

  <p>"All or none," I said. "When you showed up we were just beginning to talk
  partnership."</p>

  <p>"Those your two friends opposite?"</p>

  <p>He sat and looked at them for several minutes.</p>

  <p>"The one with his back turned is Ross, I take it, and the other Grim?" he
  said at last. "You vouch for both of them, eh? I'm inclined to think you may
  be right."</p>

  <p>He sat for five more minutes saying nothing, chewing steadily at the stump
  of his cigar, and every now and then casting a sidewise glance at me. At last
  he threw away the cigar with a gesture that meant he had made his mind
  up.</p>

  <p>"Anyhow," he said, "men like you are scarce. It's like looking for a dime
  and finding a dollar bill. Bring 'em over here!"</p>

  <p>I caught Grim's eye; and he and Jeremy strolled over, laughing at one of
  Jeremy's jokes. I introduced them and they sat down.</p>

  <p>"You the old robber who cornered platinum?" asked Jeremy.</p>

  <p>"In my youth I was guilty of that," Strange answered dryly.</p>

  <p>"Hah! My old dad bought International Platinum stock at bottom on margin,
  and followed you all the way up! He invested the proceeds in a sheep station.
  My regards!" said Jeremy, with a wave of the hand that signified a lot of
  things. "You big whales all have barnacles on your belly. We three now
  haven't got a parasite between us."</p>

  <p>"Isn't there a drunken Sikh?" Strange answered.</p>

  <p>"There's a Sikh who happens to be drunk," said Jeremy. "If you want to see
  some fun, old top, come with us. Grim can tell you. Grim's had to tidy up
  after him half-a-dozen times."</p>

  <p>Grim volunteered no information. All he knew yet was that Meldrum Strange
  was a multimillionaire with a reputation for titanic thoroughness.</p>

  <p>"Came to make Ramsden a business offer," said Strange abruptly. "He tells
  me you three are inseparable."</p>

  <p>"Agreed five minutes ago," smiled Jeremy, with the air of a man raking in
  a jack-pot. "We're Grim, Ramsden, and Ross."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" asked Strange.</p>

  <p>"Oh, anything. The world's full of things to do," said Jeremy. "What d'you
  want? We're charter members of the Jack-of-all-trades Union. Exploring
  expeditions fixed up while you wait. Kings dethroned and national boundaries
  rearranged to order. Mines discovered, opened up, and worked. Revolutions
  produced or prevented. Horses swapped. Teeth pulled by the piece or dozen.
  Everything contracted for, from flaying whales to raising potatoes on Mount
  Everest, wholesale jobs preferred. All you've got to do is name your
  requirements, write your check, and sign your contract on the dotted line. We
  do the rest. Shoot, old top; we're listening."</p>

  <p>Strange glanced at me. He looked over at Grim, with no more result. Having
  agreed to be Jeremy's partners, there was nothing further for us to say in
  his behalf; and Strange saw the obvious logic of that after a minute.</p>

  <p>"You didn't mention keeping secrets in your list of offerings," he said,
  holding out his cigar case.</p>

  <p>Jeremy took one, balanced it on the end of one finger, tossed it, caught
  it between his teeth, apparently swallowed it whole, and handed the case
  back.</p>

  <p>"Count 'em," was all he said.</p>

  <p>There was the same number of cigars in the case as before, but one of them
  bore teeth-marks. Strange pulled it out, examined it, and tossed it with a
  laugh to Jeremy, who caught it, spun it point-downward on the table like a
  top, and while it still spun brought down the flat of his hand on it as if
  driving a nail into the wood. He removed his hand instantly, showing it
  empty. The cigar had disappeared, but a second later he produced it undamaged
  from his mouth with the other hand. It was superbly done, like all his
  tricks.</p>

  <p>"Do you know how to do that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No," said Strange.</p>

  <p>"I know you don't. I've kept that secret twenty years. Show you
  another."</p>

  <p>"No," Strange answered. "I get the drift of your genius. Major Grim, I
  understand you're senior partner of this unusual firm."</p>

  <p>"We're ready to listen to your proposal," said Grim.</p>

  <p>"Can I depend on your silence if you shouldn't like the offer after I've
  made it?"</p>

  <p>"I've kept Government secrets for a number of years," Grim answered.
  "Depend on all three of us absolutely."</p>

  <p>"Suppose you all come to my room."</p>

  <p>"Here's the best place," Grim answered. "We can see all ways, and can't be
  overheard."</p>

  <p>So, as happens I daresay oftener than folk suspect, a secret that had
  never yet passed the lips of its first guardian was trotted out, not within
  four walls, but in full view of the street.</p>

  <p>"I'll begin at the beginning," said Strange, biting on a new cigar. "I'm
  an egoist. Nothing matters to a man but what he does. Not what he gets, but
  what he does. That's my religion, and the whole of it. I've amassed an
  enormous fortune. Never had partners. I regard my fortune as the product of
  my own use of natural gifts in compliance with universal laws. I never
  consciously broke a written law accumulating it, but I've often done things
  that experience has since taught me are not in the general interest, and I
  believe that what I do in the general interest is the only thing that counts
  as far as I'm concerned. I'm face to face with a fact, a question, and a
  condition. I have the fortune. What am I going to do with it? No good comes
  of doing things for people. That's the problem. What shall I do? It's up to
  me to use my money in the general interest."</p>

  <p>"Why worry? Pay off a part of your national debt, and go to sleep,"
  suggested Jeremy.</p>

  <p>"Huh! I'd lie awake to curse myself if I wasted a nickel in that way,"
  Strange retorted. "Our government would simply buy an extra battleship. If we
  all refused to pay for war there would be none. I've finished paying for
  it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, are you one of those men without a country?" asked Jeremy blandly.
  "One red flag for all of us, and a world doing lockstep in time to the
  Internationale."</p>

  <p>Strange liked that. The question threw light on Jeremy's own view-point.
  He laughed&mdash;just one gruff bark like a watchdog's.</p>

  <p>"The man who doesn't put his country first might as well neglect his own
  body and expect to do business," he answered. "On the other hand, a state is
  composed of individuals, of whom I'm one, with an opinion. I obey the laws.
  There's not even wine in my cellar. But I make use of every opening the law
  allows to escape paying for armaments that I don't approve of. I lose income
  by it, because the tax-exempt securities come high; but that loss is part of
  my contribution to the general interest. That's what I, personally, do in
  that particular instance, and intend to keep on doing."</p>

  <p>"Do you propose to start a society or hire us to preach?" Jeremy
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"I belong to no societies. I'm an individualist, believing that what I do
  is my concern, and what other folk do is their concern, subject to the law as
  it stands on the statute books. Charity leaves me unconvinced. I don't care
  to endow colleges. I paid the men who taught me what I wanted to know, with
  money that I earned."</p>

  <p>"Well? Where are we getting to?" demanded Grim.</p>

  <p>"To this: I made my money all over the world. I propose to use it all over
  the world. Nobody can fool me with a bald statement that peoples are self-
  governing. They should be, but they're not given a chance to be. They're
  herded up in mobs, blarneyed, coaxed, cheated, and made fools of; and because
  some of them have free institutions, they're blamed for the result, while the
  real culprits get away with the plunder. I'm after the real culprits. I want
  you men to join me."</p>

  <p>Grim whistled. So did Jeremy. So did I. Three notes of a rising scale.</p>

  <p>"D'you suppose you've any right to take that on yourself?" asked
  Jeremy.</p>

  <p>"As much right as any reformer has, and more," Strange answered, "for I
  intend to pay my own expenses! I'll make it my business to fall foul of these
  international crooks, who are laughing behind the scenes at the world's
  misery. My business is to seek those swine out, force an issue&mdash;a
  personal issue, mind&mdash;and swat them!"</p>

  <p>"You want to be a sort of international police?" suggested Grim.</p>

  <p>"I do not. An international police would be answerable to an international
  government, and there is none. These devils I'm after obey no government.
  Governments are tricked by them into furthering their designs. Governments
  are made up of individuals, each of whom can be worked, persuaded, bribed,
  blackmailed or deceived at some time in some way. The rascals I'm after play
  with kings and cabinets like pieces on a chess-board. They play crooked boss
  with the whole world for a stage, and they're safe because they've only got
  to deal with the representatives of majorities. They're persons, dealing with
  impersonal ministries. I'm going to make it a personal issue with them in
  every instance. But I have to work in secret, or I'll last about a minute and
  a half. That's how you three men happen to be the first who ever heard a word
  from me on a subject that I've been pondering for five-and-twenty years."</p>

  <p>"Strange, old boy," said Jeremy. "You altruists are all plausible; and you
  all turn out in the end to be feathering your own nests."</p>

  <p>"My impression of you is that you're honest," Strange answered.</p>

  <p>"Honest? You don't know me," laughed Jeremy. "I posed as a prophet of
  Islam in an Arab village. They used to pay me to make the dead talk from
  their tombs, and I charged 'em so much extra for every ten years the corpse
  had been dead and buried. Sure I'm honest."</p>

  <p>"You keep good company," Strange answered. "How about you, Ramsden? Are
  you interested?"</p>

  <p>"Interested, yes," I answered. "Grim is the senior partner. Let's hear
  what he has to say."</p>

  <p>"How about it, Major Grim?"</p>

  <p>"How would it pay?" Grim asked.</p>

  <p>"Five thousand dollars a year for each of you, and all expenses."</p>

  <p>"Would you expect us to obey you blindly? The answer is 'No' in that
  case," Grim assured him.</p>

  <p>"Strict confidence, and the best judgment of all of you. Once we agree
  together on a course my instructions must be carried out."</p>

  <p>"How about additions to the staff? I'd have to choose the men I'll work
  with," said Grim.</p>

  <p>"I approve of that."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Mr. Strange. We three will talk it over and give you a
  definite answer tonight," said Grim; and we got up together and left Strange
  sitting there.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">CHAPTER III<br>
  "I have sworn a vow. Henceforward I serve none but queens!"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">We had not yet made up our minds, but were dining with
  Meldrum Strange under a great ornamental palm by a splashing fountain,
  discussing anything from China to Peru that had no bearing on Strange's
  offer, when a coal-black Egyptian servant, arrayed in fez, silver-laced
  purple jacket, and white cotton smock, brought Grim a scented envelope. The
  scent had a peculiar, pervading strength that commanded attention without
  challenging. The envelope was made from linen, stiff, thick, and colored
  faintly mauve, but bore no address. The seal was of yellow wax, poured on
  liberally and bearing the impress of a man's thumb. No woman ever had a thumb
  of that size. Grim turned the thing over half a dozen times, the servant
  standing motionless behind his chair. When he tore it open at last the
  contents proved equally remarkable. In English, written with a damaged quill
  pen, was a message from Narayan Singh that looked as if he had held the paper
  in one unsteady hand at arm's length, and made stabs at it with the other.
  But it was to the point.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">If the sahib will bring the other sahibs, he shall look
  into the eyes of heaven and know all about hell. The past is past. The future
  none knoweth. The present is now. Come at once. &mdash;NARAYAN SINGH.</p><br>

  <p>Grim asked the servant for more particulars&mdash;his master's name, for
  instance, and where he lived. He answered in harsh Egyptian Arabic that he
  had been told to show us the way. He absolutely refused to say who had sent
  him, or whose paper the message was written on; and he denied all knowledge
  of Narayan Singh. All he professed to know was the way to the house where we
  were wanted immediately. So we all went upstairs and packed repeating pistols
  into the pockets of our tuxedos.</p>

  <p>Meldrum Strange agreed to follow us in a hired auto, and to take careful
  bearings of whatever house we might enter; after which he would watch the
  place from a distance until midnight. If we didn't reappear by twelve
  o'clock, it was agreed that he should summon help and have the place
  raided.</p>

  <p>Looking back, I rather wonder that we took so much precaution. Cairo was
  quiet. There hadn't been a political disturbance for six weeks, which is a
  long time as things go nowadays. The soldiers of the British garrison no
  longer had to go about in dozens for self-protection, and for more than a
  fortnight the rule against gathering in crowds had been suspended.
  Nevertheless, we were nervous, and kept that assignation armed.</p>

  <p>A carriage waited for us in the luminous shadow in front of the hotel
  steps. It was a very sumptuous affair, drawn by two bay thoroughbreds and
  driven by another graven ebony image, in fez, blue frock-coat with silver
  buttons, and top-boots. There was a footman in similar livery, and behind the
  carriage, between the great C springs, was a platform for the enigma who had
  brought the message.</p>

  <p>We were off at a clattering trot almost before the door slammed shut,
  swaying through the badly lighted streets to the tune of silver harness bells
  and the shouts of the driver and footman.</p>

  <p>Mere pedestrians had to "imshi" and do it quick.</p>

  <p>Lord! That was a carriage. We struck matches to admire the finery. It was
  lined with velvet, on which an artist had painted cupids and doves. There
  were solid silver brackets, holding silver tubes, that held real
  orchids&mdash;cypropedium expensivum, as Jeremy identified them.</p>

  <p>The curtains that draped the windows were hand-made lace&mdash;Louis the
  Something-or-other&mdash;half as old as France; and the thing to put your
  feet on was covered with peacocks' bosoms done in wood, inlaid with
  semiprecious stones. There were mirrors galore to see your face in, but no
  way of seeing out of the windows without tearing the lace, and we didn't feel
  afraid enough to do that.</p>

  <p>There was nothing to remind us of the ordinary, hum-drum world, except the
  noisy exhaust of Meldrum Strange's hired car closely pursuing us, and even
  that sounded detached, you might say, like the sounds of next-door neighbors
  whom you don't yet know.</p>

  <p>We didn't have to worry about what direction we were taking, since Strange
  was attending to that, but there seemed to be no effort made to confuse us.
  We kept to the straight, wide streets, and crossed an arm of the Nile by the
  stone bridge into the better residential quarter, where mansions stand amid
  palms and shrubbery behind high stone walls. Nor did we leave the Nile far
  behind us.</p>

  <p>The faintly lighted interior of the carriage grew suddenly as dark as
  death as we passed under an echoing arch, and out again on gravel between an
  avenue of trees. We caught the click behind us of an iron gate, and wondered
  what Meldrum Strange would do, but hardly had time to think of him before the
  carriage came to a stand under a portico and the door was opened with a
  jerk.</p>

  <p>We stepped out into a realm of mystery. We could see part of the outline
  of a great stone house, built in the semi-Oriental, barbaric style of modern
  Egypt; but the only light was from a Chinese paper lantern in the middle of
  the portico roof, throwing quivering golden shadows on a front door that was
  almost entirely covered with bronze Chinese dragons.</p>

  <p>To right and left was a silhouette of fragrant shrubs against the blue
  Egyptian night; and there wasn't a sound except what we made. When the
  carriage drove away and the click of horseshoes vanished somewhere around a
  corner there was utter silence, until the man who had brought the message
  stepped up to the front door like a ghost and pushed an electric bell.</p>

  <p>Did it ever strike you that sound has color? The din that bell made was
  dazzling, diamond white, reflecting all the colors of the prism in its
  facets. When I spoke of it afterwards I found that Grim had noticed the same
  thing.</p>

  <p>It was about two minutes before the door opened. Two black six-footers,
  who looked smug enough to be eunuchs, swung both leaves of the door wide open
  suddenly, and stood aside with chins in the air to let us pass.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>We entered a restfully lighted hall that might have belonged to a
  monastery, for it was all white stone without an ornament except simplicity.
  The ceiling was supported by plaster stone arches, and the whole effect was
  so unexpectedly different from that outside that it froze you into silence.
  It was like looking forward to the circus and finding yourself in church.
  There was even dim organ music descending from somewhere out of sight.</p>

  <p>The stairs were on our right hand, of stone, severely plain, with a hand-
  forged iron balustrade that might have been plundered from an old New England
  mansion. The same black-visaged minion who had brought the note and rung the
  bell led the way up them, we following abreast, in step and silent until
  Jeremy whistled the first few bars of the "Dead March" from Saul.</p>

  <p>"This feels like kissing a fish," he exclaimed. "There's no afterglow.
  Let's warm things up!"</p>

  <p>But there was no need. We passed into yet another world before the echo of
  his words had died. I hardly mean that figuratively either. Through a high,
  warm gray-and-silver curtain at the stair-head we stepped into a nearly
  square, enormous room at the back of the house. Four, high-arched, open
  windows along one side overlooked the Nile.</p>

  <p>Maybe you've seen the Nile through a window at night, with the curved
  spars of boats as old as Moses motionless against the purple sky and the
  moonlight bathing everything in silver silence? It's worth the trip.</p>

  <p>The light within the room was of several colors, shining through stained-
  glass shades and causing all the rich furniture to glow in a sort of
  opalescent mystery. Simplicity was as much the key-note here as below; but
  this was simple extravagance. The carpet alone&mdash;one piece of old rose
  hand-work reaching from wall to wall&mdash;was likely worth the High
  Commissioner's year's salary; and the tapestry that covered the long wall
  facing the windows probably contributed to the fall of Marie Antoinette by
  helping bankrupt the poor devils who had to pay for it.</p>

  <p>There was an Oriental touch, produced by long divans with silken cushions
  ranged against the walls. A door at the far end was hidden by a curtain of
  amber beads&mdash;old amber, each piece polished into ripeness on a woman's
  breast; I walked over and examined them.</p>

  <p>We sat down facing the windows, sinking a foot deep into silken
  cushions&mdash;and sniffed; there was the same scent that was on the
  envelope&mdash;jasmine, I think, mixed with some subtler stuff&mdash;and
  still the same far-away chords of organ music.</p>

  <p>"Let's sing hymns!" suggested Jeremy. "Or shall I do tricks? I know a
  dandy one with cushions."</p>

  <p>"Please do both. I would love to watch you!" said a woman's voice; and
  though we hadn't heard the door move, we could see her behind the amber
  curtain. She came forward at once.</p>

  <p>"Zelmira Poulakis," she announced, when we had told our names.</p>

  <p>I may as well say right now, and have done with it, that I know nothing
  about women of her kind. My mother was a wrinkled old gray-haired lady with
  nothing subtle about her, but rather a plain straight-forwardness that made
  you understand; and somehow, she has always stood for Woman in my memory,
  most of the other types being incomprehensible&mdash;welcome to anything if
  they will let me alone in the smoking-room.</p>

  <p>I suppose Zelmira Poulakis is a type, although I've never seen another
  like her. She is Levantine, and those she-Levantines while they are still
  young are supple, vivacious, with eyes that say more than their lips, and
  lips that can kiss, curse or coax with equal genius. She had on a frock all
  stitched with glittering beetles' wings, that just a little more than reached
  her shins, and they were very shapely shins; it was charity and art to show
  them.</p>

  <p>She had the poise and ease and grace that go with the sort of education
  women get, who are "presented" at the smaller European courts, and her
  jewels, which were few, were splendid, but hardly more so than her eyes.</p>

  <p>Jeremy&mdash;you can't put him out of countenance&mdash;drew up a sort of
  throne made of elephants' tusks, and she sat down facing us, laughing,
  speaking English with only trace enough of accent to make it pretty.</p>

  <p>"You look rather bewildered and I can't blame you," she began. "What must
  you have thought! But I've heard such wonderful accounts of you that I
  couldn't resist the temptation. Will you forgive me?"</p>

  <p>"Not we!" laughed Jeremy. "Forgiveness would imply that we didn't like
  being here. If Narayan Singh is in your hands he's all right."</p>

  <p>"But he isn't! Oh, he isn't! If only he were!" she exclaimed with a
  comical grimace.</p>

  <p>"Suppose you shut up, Jeremy, and let her tell us," Grim suggested.</p>

  <p>Well, she told us. She was good at telling things, and a beautiful woman
  in a gorgeous setting is hypnotic, mistrust her how you will. We three
  listened to the end without interrupting to challenge her statements.</p>

  <p>"Last night," she began, "there was a ball at the Greek Legation. My
  husband was Greek, although I am not. I was returning from the ball in my
  carriage with a friend at about half-past four this morning, and had stopped
  at the door of my friend's house about a mile from here to set her down; in
  fact, she had already left the carriage and my footman was in the act of
  closing the carriage door, when he was suddenly thrust aside by an enormous
  Indian dressed in a turban and a blue serge suit. My footman is a giant, but
  the Indian flung him aside with one hand with hardly an effort, and I'm
  afraid I screamed."</p>

  <p>She appeared to be ashamed of having screamed, but Narayan Singh with two
  quarts of whisky inside him would frighten the Sphinx.</p>

  <p>"My footman returned to the rescue very pluckily," she went on, "but the
  Indian threw him under the horses, which frightened them so badly that the
  coachman had all he could do to keep them from running away. My friend did
  run away. She has told me since that she ran indoors to get the servants, but
  by the time she had aroused them I was gone; so she went to bed, and hoped
  for the best. Philosophic, wasn't she?"</p>

  <p>Grim was sitting on my right hand. He made no remark, and didn't change
  his facial expression; but I did notice a sudden stiffening of his muscles.
  You'll see exactly the same thing when an experienced hunter becomes aware of
  big game creeping out from cover.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what the Indian intended in the first place." she continued,
  "but my scream apparently fired his imagination. He swore terribly in
  English&mdash;said that protecting queens in distress was his only
  occupation&mdash;and jumped into the carriage, shutting the door behind him
  with a slam that sounded like a big gun going off. That was too much for the
  horses altogether; they went off at a gallop. Luckily the footman had
  scrambled out from under their feet, and there is a foot-board behind the
  carriage; he caught hold of that and climbed on. The carriage went so fast
  that it was all he could do to hang on, although he tried to climb on the
  roof and come to my assistance that way; the top of the carriage is smooth
  and slippery, and the feat proved impossible.</p>

  <p>"Really, it was the worst predicament! it was almost totally dark, but I
  could see the whites of the Indian's eyes, and his white teeth gleaming in
  the middle of his black beard, and I nearly fainted. But he sat down opposite
  me with his arms folded across his breast, and presently I grew calmer and
  began to think. You gentlemen, who are used to all sorts of wild adventures,
  would doubtless have known what to do; but I didn't.</p>

  <p>"I even began to suspect my coachman and footman of being parties to a
  plot to carry me off somewhere; and the fact that the Indian did not try to
  molest me made it seem as if he might be acting on behalf of someone else. I
  found words at last and asked him in English what he wanted.</p>

  <p>" 'Nothing under heaven but your Majesty's instructions!' he answered. 'I
  am Narayan Singh, your servant. Say but the word, your Majesty, and I will
  accomplish marvels&mdash;I will pull the heads off these Egyptians as a crow
  pulls worms out of a plowed field! Command me! Set me a task! My honor is
  involved! I have sworn a vow. Henceforward I serve none but queens!'</p>

  <p>"Can you imagine it? I asked him to stop the horses! I couldn't think of
  anything else to tell him to do! I knew by the overpowering smell of whisky
  that he was intoxicated, but he seemed mad in the bargain. I wanted to get
  rid of him and I'm afraid the thought occurred to me that he might get killed
  in making the attempt, although I hardly hoped he would really try.</p>

  <p>"However, he didn't hesitate for a second. The carriage was swaying all
  over the street, with the wheels grating against a curbstone one minute and
  skidding sidewise the next, and it was all I could do to keep my seat, to say
  nothing of standing up. But he opened the door, climbed out, swung himself up
  on the box beside the coachman, seized the reins, and tugged at them,
  discovered that was no use, and jumped on to the back of the near-side horse!
  Both horses nearly fell, and in the time they had recovered he had their
  heads together and was tugging them to a standstill! Strength&mdash;such
  strength&mdash;he nearly wrenched their heads off! And he brought them to a
  standstill beside a street lamp at a crossing, trembling and too thoroughly
  conquered to bolt again whatever happened!</p>

  <p>"The footman jumped down then, and the Indian struck him, calling him
  names and ordering him to go and stand at the horses' heads. Then the Indian
  came to the window and asked what he should do next, and before I could think
  of anything to tell him to do he was back in the carriage with folded arms,
  shouting to the coachman to drive on.</p>

  <p>"My servants didn't obey him at once, and he was going to get out and kill
  them, I think, so I called to them to drive straight home, thinking I might
  be able to get rid of the Indian at the gate. But not so. There is a servant
  who lives in the gate-house. He opened the gate as soon as he heard the
  carriage coming but before we entered I called out to the coachman to stop,
  which he did, with the horses' heads underneath the arch and the carriage
  outside. Then I thanked the Indian for having protected me and bade him good
  night. He bowed and got out; but instead of going away he climbed up behind
  on the foot-board and called to the coachman to drive on in.</p>

  <p>"Nothing would make him get down again. He swore that he was my only
  protector, and that none should deprive him of the honor. He threatened to
  pull to pieces anyone who sought to interfere, and used such frightful
  language, and made such a noise that I was afraid he would wake the whole
  neighborhood and cause a scandal.</p>

  <p>"It occurred to me that I have an Indian in the house who might be able to
  manage him&mdash;a gentle old philosopher, who used to be my husband's
  friend, and whom I have allowed to live here since my husband died, because
  the house is so big, and he so quiet, and so dependent on charity in his old
  age, that it would have been hard-hearted not to. He is a wonderful old man.
  I have seen him calm human passions in a moment by his mere beneficence.</p>

  <p>"So I made the best of an awkward situation by telling the coachman to
  drive on in. And Narayan Singh entered the house behind me, behaving like a
  family servitor except that he made more noise than ten ordinary men, and
  demanded to know which was my apartment, in order that he might lie down
  across the threshold and protect me. "Narendra Nath&mdash;that is the name of
  my old Indian friend&mdash;sleeps very little, spending most of the night on
  the floor above this one in meditation. I brought Narayan Singh into this
  room, and sent for Narendra Nath, who seemed to appreciate the situation
  without my saying anything. He is a very wise old man, and never makes
  unnecessary fuss. He began talking to Narayan Singh in his own language, and
  within five minutes the two of them were on their way upstairs together, as
  friendly as you please.</p>

  <p>"I retired. It was already after dawn, and I needed rest after all that
  excitement. But djeuner was brought to me a little after midday, and after
  my toilet was made I sent for both Indians, hoping to get to the bottom of
  the affair and perhaps to glean some amusement from it. Believe me, I was
  more than amused; I was amazed.</p>

  <p>"Narayan Singh, although not yet sober, had begun to return to his senses,
  and the two men had struck up a strong friendship. The surprising thing was
  not that Narayan Singh should worship Narendra Nath, for he is a venerable
  old man, but that Narendra Nath, who has so few friendships, should
  reciprocate. The two men had sworn to be inseparable, and old Narendra Nath
  implored me with tears in his eyes to take Narayan Singh into my service.</p>

  <p>"How could I refuse? I would do almost anything to oblige Narendra Nath.
  But a difficulty arose at once, which seemed to admit of no solution. It
  seems that Narayan Singh is a deserter from the British Army and liable to
  arrest for that at any minute. What was to be done? I couldn't imagine.</p>

  <p>"Narayan Singh spoke constantly of a certain Jimgrim and his two friends
  Ramsden and Jeremy&mdash;he spoke of you tout court&mdash;gave you no
  titles&mdash;and he vowed that you could accomplish anything&mdash;simply
  anything&mdash;between you. He spent about two hours telling me astonishing
  stories of your prowess, and it occurred to me at last that possibly you
  could get him out of the army in some way without his having to pay the
  penalty for desertion.</p>

  <p>"But the problem then was how to reach you, and how to persuade you to
  take the necessary action, without letting the Indian's whereabouts be known.
  I thought of a hundred methods. I even considered calling on you at
  Shepheard's Hotel, where he told me you were staying. But finally I hit on
  the solution of getting Narayan Singh to write a letter, and sending my
  carriage for you, hoping that perhaps curiosity would induce you where
  persuasion might have failed.</p>

  <p>"However, the task of persuading remains, doesn't it! Can you arrange it,
  Major Grim, that Narayan Singh shall be discharged from the British Army, so
  that he may enter my service?"</p>

  <p>Her smile as she asked that favor was the product of experience. She had
  tried it on a thousand different sorts of men, and used it now confidently.
  But Grim is a dry old rock, for all his vein of kindness.</p>

  <p>"If I could see Narayan Singh himself, alone&mdash;" he suggested. And she
  found him harder to refuse than he did her, because his request was
  reasonable.</p>

  "Jaldee jaldee Secret Society Shaitan-log Eldums Range Kabadar!"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Madame Zelmira Poulakis did not argue the point, but smiled
  exceedingly graciously and left the room by the amber curtain route.</p>

  <p>The beads hadn't ceased clicking behind her when Jeremy started humming
  the words of one of those songs that follow the British army
  eastward&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Widows are wonderful &hellip;"</p>

  <p>You had to admit it. Wonderful she was. But no wise fowler ever caught
  Grim yet by putting wonderful salt on his tail. He was unconvinced, and
  looked it.</p>

  <p>"Did you spot any flaws in her story?" he asked, and I remembered that
  stiffening of the muscles I had noticed.</p>

  <p>"To Hell with her story and your spots?" said Jeremy. "She's perfect. Who
  cares if a woman draws a long bow? Let's go odd man out to see who takes her
  to dinner tomorrow eight. D'you want to bet me I don't pull it off?"</p>

  <p>"Dine with her," Grim answered, "but explain this first: Why did her
  friend not send servants for the police?"</p>

  <p>"Scared stiff, of course," Jeremy retorted. "What Cairene woman wouldn't
  be?"</p>

  <p>"Well, her servants wouldn't be, for they hadn't seen the Sikh. Why didn't
  they run for the police without her orders? Did! she forbid them? If so,
  why?"</p>

  <p>"How d'you know they didn't go for the police?" Jeremy objected.</p>

  <p>"It's obvious. The police would have come here, questioned the servants,
  and taken Narayan Singh away. But there's another point; while the horses
  were running away they must have passed more than one policeman standing on
  duty. Why didn't the footman yell for help?"</p>

  <p>"Too busy trying to climb on the carriage roof," Jeremy suggested.</p>

  <p>"D'you believe that? You saw the footman. The carriage was the same we
  came in, for the paint was off the wheels where they hit the curb when the
  horses bolted. I'm no athlete, but I could climb from that rear platform to
  the roof. I don't care how fast the thing was going."</p>

  <p>"Mm-mm, yes. But the footman's a Gyppy. He was scared," objected Jeremy.
  "She told a straight story. Straight enough anyhow. There's a gentleman
  friend somewhere, I suppose. You can't expect her to drag him in."</p>

  <p>"Tell me, if you can, why the gateman here didn't call the police, when
  the carriage stopped under the arch and Narayan Singh refused to go away.
  Couldn't the gate-man, the coachman, and the footman have kept one Sikh
  outside the gate until the police came?"</p>

  <p>"She didn't want to wake the neighbors," Jeremy remembered.</p>

  <p>"Tut! Two more tuts! Half a hundred tuts!" Grim said. "You know Egypt as
  well as I do. There are only two things sacred in the whole country. Graft
  and privacy. You can commit any social crime in Egypt as long as you don't
  trespass around the ladies' quarters after dark. If she had summoned the
  neighbors, they'd have had their servants kill Narayan Singh. His body would
  have been tossed into the Nile and that would have been the end of the story.
  She knows that perfectly well. Now answer another question:</p>

  <p>"Do you believe that drunk or sober Narayan Singh would desert from the
  Army, or pretend to desert, or imagine himself a deserter? He'd be much more
  likely to march up to Government House and accuse the High Commissioner of
  treason! Listen!"</p>

  <p>The music that seemed to come downward from the roof, and might reasonably
  be supposed to come from the upper story of the next house, suddenly pealed
  louder for a moment, and just as suddenly grew quiet, as if someone had
  opened the door of a music-room and closed it,</p>

  <p>It may have been thirty seconds before the door closed again&mdash;if that
  was the secret of the burst of sound. It left all three of us feeling
  strangely disturbed. I have felt the same sensation when tigers prowled close
  to a tent at night. When the amber beads rattled even Jeremy gave a nervous
  start, although cool gall is his life blood.</p>

  <p>But it was only Zelmira Poulakis back smiling and looking archly shy. I
  got the idea that she knew what Grim had been saying. An idea, according to
  Heine the German poet, is "any damned nonsense that comes into a man's head."
  However, you don't have to let people know everything that's in your thought;
  Grim made a pretty good bluff at looking cordial, I followed suit, and Jeremy
  is always cordial to a good-looking woman.</p>

  <p>"I am going to ask you to come with me," she said.</p>

  <p>She stood playing with the amber beads&mdash;stage-acting. She would have
  held breathless any audience that had paid for its seats; but you might say
  we were deadheads, a class that is notoriously super-critical.</p>

  <p>And now, you fellows who are never afraid of women, laugh if you like. As
  I got off the divan I turned to hide the movement of my right hand, making
  sure that the automatic pistol wasn't caught in the pocket lining. The dead
  weight of it felt good. That's how much Zelmira Poulakis had me
  hypnotized.</p>

  <p>Grim strode forward, and before he reached the curtain I whispered to
  Jeremy to keep behind me with both eyes lifting. He was humming a tune to
  himself, and his careless mood annoyed me.</p>

  <p>I can't explain why I felt that way. Fear was ridiculous, as in the last
  analysis it always is; but I can close my eyes today and recall the sensation
  as vividly as if it had happened an hour ago.</p>

  <p>She led us almost completely around the house through a series of
  magnificently furnished rooms with polished floors that must have needed an
  army of servants to keep them in shape. Some of the rooms had cut-glass
  electric chandeliers that blazed like clustered diamonds. And she walked
  through it all on high French heels as a goldfish swims in water&mdash;her
  natural habitat&mdash;she would have missed it if it weren't there, I
  daresay, but as it was, thought no more about the splendor than the air she
  breathed.</p>

  <p>She led us at last up a rosewood stairway that had rose satin panels
  painted with Venuses and cupids, up two flights to a floor on which
  simplicity seemed all the rule again. There was a big, square landing done in
  plain white plaster, with an open stairway at each end and six oak doors on
  either side set deep in the wall.</p>

  <p>And now we were in the midst of that infernal music. You could recognize
  it now. It was the stuff they play in Hindu temples when the entrance is
  barred to visitors and lord knows what strange rites are going on inside. It
  makes goose-flesh rise all over you&mdash;perfectly bloodsome stuff.</p>

  <p>Zelmira Poulakis opened a door on the right without knocking and led the
  way into a room so blue with incense smoke that for a moment you could hardly
  breathe or see. There weren't any windows. Such light as there was came from
  about a dozen glowing colored lamps, and when your eyes got used to the smoke
  the place looked like the interior of a temple.</p>

  <p>There was a high, gold-painted screen at one end, carved into the
  semblance of writhing snakes; and a huge wooden image of a god with more than
  his share of arms was set on a platform in the middle with its back up
  against the screen. The music was coming over the top of the screen, and
  through it, permeating the whole place, so that you seemed to breathe that
  beastly noise instead of air. There were a few rugs and cushions on the
  floor. And on our side of the screen the room had only two occupants besides
  ourselves.</p>

  <p>Facing us as we entered, cross-legged on a small rug with his back toward
  the image of the god, sat Narayan Singh, scarcely recognizable. He was naked
  to the waist. The hair on his breast was glistening with a mixture of sweat
  and scented oil. His beard, which is usually curled and crisp, was straggling
  wild. And his long black hair, that he usually keeps tucked under a turban so
  neatly that you don't guess it's there, was knotted drunkenly to one
  side.</p>

  <p>But his eyes were the worst of him. Half as large again as usual, as if he
  had been staring into the hell he promised we should know all about if we
  obeyed his summons. Yet they were hardly the eyes of a drunkard. At the first
  glance they looked terror-stricken, but the suggestion of fear vanished as
  you watched them. He seemed to be gazing out of this world into the next, and
  although Grim called him by name he took no notice whatever.</p>

  <p>Facing Narayan Singh, cross-legged on a second rug, Narendra Nath sat
  meditating; and, as our hostess had assured us, he was venerable. Have you
  ever seen a man so advanced in years and free from care that he looks
  actually almost young again? That was Narendra Nath. He had a white beard
  falling nearly to his waist, thinner than a Westerner's beard would be,
  showing the line of his lean jaw. He was as bald as a bone, but had bushy
  eyebrows, underneath which shone luminous dark eyes.</p>

  <p>The moment we entered he clapped a turban on his head, which made him look
  twenty years younger. To look from his eyes to his hands was like bridging a
  century in half a second. His hands were like a mummy's, but his eyes were a
  youth's, full of laughter and love&mdash;though love of what might be another
  problem.</p>

  <p>Zelmira Poulakis and we three all greeted him, but he merely glanced once
  at us and said something in an undertone to Narayan Singh, who nodded almost
  imperceptibly. The Sikh seemed to be in a trance, and I suspected hasheesh on
  top of the whisky.</p>

  <p>"You see, he is not really in a fit state to go away," said our hostess.
  "Narendra Nath will care for him, and under that kind influence he will soon
  recover. But the days will go by and the offense of desertion from the Army
  will increase. Now that you have seen him, can't you do something about
  it?"</p>

  <p>Old Narendra Nath's bright orbs sought Grim's as if a great deal hung on
  the verdict, and for a space of several seconds I alone observed Narayan
  Singh. His eyes moved at last, closing in the process to their natural size.
  He studied each face swiftly, making sure he was unobserved, caught my eye,
  winked, smiled, nodded, and resumed his former mask of semi-hypnotized
  immobility.</p>

  <p>I didn't hear what Grim said in answer to Zelmira Poulakis. Sure now that
  the Sikh was neither totally drunk nor drugged out of his senses&mdash;Sikhs
  can stand an enormous amount of both&mdash;I began edging toward the golden
  screen. But before I got close enough to see through its interstices, old
  Narendra Nath came thoroughly to life and jabbered in broken Arabic:</p>

  <p>"Stop! Stop! Not there! Turn back! That is not for your eyes! Turn your
  head away!"</p>

  <p>It was dark beyond the screen. I didn't get a chance to see through it.
  But the disturbance served my real purpose, for our hostess joined her
  protests to Narendra Nath's, and that gave me full excuse for facing about
  immediately in front of Narayan Singh with my heels on the mat that he
  squatted on.</p>

  <p>"None of us ever interfere here," Madame Poulakis then explained. "It is
  understood that Narendra Nath has perfect privacy. We never spy on him in any
  way. Even my husband when he was living never looked behind that screen."</p>

  <p>Her statement didn't seem quite to tally with her manner of entering the
  room without the formality of knocking. However, I wasn't disposed to quarrel
  with it. I stood with my thick legs together like a Prussian on parade and
  made apologies, while Narayan Singh tucked something carefully into my
  patent-leather shoe.</p>

  <p>"Haven't we seen enough?" our hostess asked. "I know how terribly such an
  intrusion must have broken up Narendra Nath's meditation. No such thing has
  happened since he came to live here, but it couldn't be helped for this
  once&mdash;could it? You forgive me, Narendra Nath?"</p>

  <p>I guess old velvet-eyes knew English well enough. He bowed with the air of
  a philosopher too wise to bear resentment, but with just the added touch of
  authority required to suggest that he wasn't pleased, and Zelmira Poulakis
  marshaled us out of the room. The comparative silence in the plastered hall
  outside was like heaven after the grating, ghastly temple music, which again
  sounded more like organ notes now that the thick door shut it off.</p>

  <p>Our hostess seemed in a hurry to get us away from that scene, but I paused
  long enough to stick a finger in my shoe. I found a folded piece of paper,
  and opened and read it as we followed downstairs and through room after room
  in Indian file.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the first room I slipped it into Jeremy's hand from
  behind. He read it, laughed back over his shoulder at me, and passed it on to
  Grim, who read it in turn and crumpled it into his pocket. It was written on
  the same sort of note-paper as the message we received at the hotel, in the
  same unsteady hand, and with the same spread nib.</p>

  <p class="letter">Jaldee jaldee Secret Society Shaitan-log Eldums Range
  Kabadar.</p>

  <p>It wasn't hard to interpret superficially. Jaldee in Hindustanee means
  quick, or quickly. Shaitan-log means devil-folk. Eldums Range suggested
  Meldrum Strange, although there was room for doubt on that point, for so far
  as we were aware Narayan Singh had no knowledge of our millionaire friend.
  Kabadar means take care, or beware. Narayan Singh had evidently been
  interrupted before he could finish, for there was the beginning of another
  word&mdash;quite illegible&mdash;and the whole thing had been badly blotted
  by folding while the ink was wet. I took the message to mean:</p>

  <p>"I must write in a hurry. There is a secret society whose members are bad
  people. Look out for Meldrum Strange."</p>

  <p>True, it might have meant "beware of Meldrum Strange," but that was
  improbable. Joining secret societies wouldn't be in Strange's line, and his
  motives were indubitably honest.</p>

  <p>When we reached that great reception room, and looked out on the Nile
  flowing lazily in moonlight with the secrets of fifty centuries safe-kept
  under its abundant mud, I didn't feel enamored of Meldrum Strange's business
  proposal. Felt more like leaving him to paddle his own canoe.</p>

  <p>Let's get Narayan Singh out of this, thought I, and beat it for a white
  man's country.</p>

  <p>But we were in her net already, and the lines were tightening.</p>

  <p>We sat again on the divan with Zelmira Poulakis before us on the ivory
  throne affair.</p>

  <p>"Can't you do anything for him?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm no longer in any way connected with the Army, and consequently I have
  no authority or influence," Grim answered.</p>

  <p>She began humming to herself, drumming on the ivory with her finger-tips,
  and knitting her brows in deep thought. The frown made a dark shadow that
  suggested evil.</p>

  <p>"Leave it to me," she said suddenly. "Please don't tell where he is. I
  must have time to consider. It was very kind of you to come. Now I'll ask
  your forgiveness again and order my carriage for you."</p>

  <p>"I'll forgive you only on condition that you dine with us three tomorrow
  night!" Jeremy answered.</p>

  <p>She laughed. No woman refuses Jeremy lightly.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't come alone of course."</p>

  <p>"Bring a friend. Bring two friends."</p>

  <p>"Shepheard's? Do you know a Mr. Meldrum Strange who is staying there?"</p>

  <p>"No," Grim answered before Jeremy could get a word in, and for about a
  second after that the frown on her forehead disappeared. She was palpably
  relieved to know that we didn't know Meldrum Strange.</p>

  <p>"May I leave the answer to your invitation until the morning?" she asked.
  "I will send you a note."</p>

  <p>Then she rang the bell and we talked pleasantries until the carriage
  came.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">CHAPTER V<br>
  "The policy of the man in armor."</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There was no sign of Meldrum Strange when we drove out of
  the great gate. Unable to see through the carriage windows, Jeremy and I
  opened both doors and leaned out to look for him until we reached the Nile
  bridge and there seemed no further use. All we learned by the maneuver was
  that nobody was riding on the rear platform, and I mentioned the fact to
  Grim, who had built a sort of fence of silence around himself. The men who
  make a practice of that can be counted on to spring surprises. He came out of
  his reverie the moment I spoke.</p>

  <p>"Let's get out and walk home! Quick!" he said. "Don't stop the
  carriage."</p>

  <p>Dress a man in blue box-cloth with silver buttons, put him up in full view
  of passers-by, and he'll look straight in front of him, either from pride or
  shame, whichever way he's constituted. Let him be used to getting down and
  opening the carriage door at a journey's end, and he'll behave as if it
  couldn't come open without his permission. Nobody heard. Nobody saw.</p>

  <p>Jeremy, who jumped out last, closed the door after him, and we went and
  leaned over the bridge parapet, staring at the Nile, in full view of a
  policeman on point duty, who noticed nothing remarkable about the arrival
  from nowhere of three men in evening dress.</p>

  <p>Excepting the Gyppy policeman we had the bridge all to ourselves.</p>

  <p>There being three of us, we naturally had three opinions; and as Jeremy
  wasn't under the weather or anything like that, he naturally voiced his
  first, vaulting onto the parapet and sitting with his back to the moon.</p>

  <p>"Black is black," he said emphatically. "That's why we insist on a white
  Australia. You can turn a white man yellow, but you can't make yellow white.
  Narayan Singh came mighty near to being white, but, you see, he's 'verted,
  That message is just drunken stuff. He's full of hashish. He's had a handsome
  offer of employment. He's fallen back at the same time under the influence of
  Hindu superstition. And he's just sufficiently sober to remember the Army and
  us, and to feel ashamed. So he sent for us and then invented that bunk about
  a secret society in order to excuse himself. The best thing we can do is to
  send an ambulance for him, and engage a smart lawyer to defend him at court
  martial on the ground of temporary insanity."</p>

  <p>"Why wasn't Meldrum Strange waiting for us outside? He agreed to wait
  until midnight," was Grim's only comment at the moment.</p>

  <p>"Let's go back and get Narayan Singh," I said. "He has chanced his arm
  along with us and never failed us. The drunker he is, and the more crazy in
  the head he is, the less excuse we've got for leaving him."</p>

  <p>"Narayan Singh is neither drunk nor crazy," Grim said at last with an air
  of absolute finality. "One bottle of whisky makes him crazy, but the effect
  wears off in an hour or two. Did you notice his eyes? That's an old trick;
  lots of Indians can do it. He was sober enough to write two messages;
  sensible enough to slip the second into your shoe, and sane enough to have
  asked to be rescued if there were need of that. As for 'verting, he was never
  anything but a darned good Sikh and he never pretended, hoped, or wanted to
  be anything else. He has stumbled on the trail of something, and it's our job
  to follow up."</p>

  <p>Jeremy laughed. Young countries like Australia produce men who are young
  eternally. Unless accident overtakes him, Jeremy will probably be laughing at
  the world long after Grim and I have died of taking what we know too
  seriously.</p>

  <p>"You're making 'roo-tail soup too early," he said. "Old man 'roo's not
  shot yet. All you've got is salt and water. See here; if that's a secret
  society how do they come to send for us, and why did she let us see all that
  temple stuff and learn where the Sikh is and all that? That isn't the way to
  keep secrets. Posh! The little widow, bless her, wants Narayan Singh.
  Probably some other rich woman in Cairo has a Sikh to wait on her, and our
  little friend is jealous. You can see through her make-up with half an eye.
  She's probably monkeying with five or six religions&mdash;takes up every new
  craze that comes along&mdash;believes in reading palms, astrology, Raja Yoga,
  Ouija, Spirit-raising, Black Magic, and flirting. You watch: Narayan Singh
  will be carrying love-letters before the week's out."</p>

  <p>"It's obvious she wants Narayan Singh," Grim answered. "She needs him so
  badly that when he insisted on sending for us she had to give in to him. The
  perfectly good excuse about being a deserter is proof that he's in his right
  senses. He doesn't know I've resigned my commission, and thinks he can't be
  accused of desertion after reporting his whereabouts to me. No. There's a
  deep game on. Why did Zelmira Poulakis ask us whether we know Strange, and
  why wasn't he waiting outside for us as he promised?"</p>

  <p>"Why did you tell her we didn't know him?" Jeremy retorted.</p>

  <p>"For the same reason that you don't tell people how your tricks are done,"
  Grim answered, looking at his watch. "It's time to go now. The carriage has
  reached the hotel. They'll look for us and drive away again. Let's get off
  the bridge and down a side street before they return this way."</p>

  <p>So off we went arm-in-arm, Jeremy whistling truculently because he
  believed Grim's argument to be all nonsense, and Grim with his thinking cap
  on, indifferent to criticism. He never seems to worry about another man's
  opinion.</p>

  <p>We had left the bridge and were down a side street when an auto in a hurry
  overtook us and Meldrum Strange called out to me.</p>

  <p>"Jump in, all three of you, quick!" he exclaimed as the car slowed close
  to the curb, and almost before we had time to jump in the car was off again.
  It wasn't the same car that he had started out in that evening. He hardly
  resembled the same man. His urbanity had vanished and his lower lip protruded
  beyond the upper one pugnaciously. He sat with one elbow thrown back on the
  folded hood and his right fist clenched on his thigh. Somebody was going to
  catch it, head, heels, and bank account; no question about that.</p>

  <p>"You men sleepy?" he snapped. "Bed? No? Go on, go on!" he barked at the
  chauffeur. "Drive faster!"</p>

  <p>"Going to show us the red light district?" wondered Jeremy. "I'm surprised
  at a man of your standing! What would the minister say?"</p>

  <p>"Red ruin!" Strange exploded. "Somebody shall pay for this night's work!
  Are you open to consider the offer I made you this morning? Don't answer me!
  Don't answer me! Wait till you've heard details. I won't take 'No' for answer
  till you've heard the facts!"</p>

  <p>"Fire away, old top!" said Jeremy pleasantly. "We've been seeing things
  too&mdash;luxury&mdash;Oh, Lord!&mdash;heaven on one floor with Venus
  presiding&mdash;hell above it and the devil making music through thick smoke!
  Hell on top of heaven, think of that! Talk to me; the other two are
  crazy!"</p>

  <p>"I'll not talk for this chauffeur," Strange snapped. "Wait till
  we&mdash;where's a good place? Tell the fellow where to go to."</p>

  <p>"Gizeh!" Grim ordered, and we swung off westward in the direction of the
  Great Pyramid, where one of Egypt's few good motor roads runs straight as a
  die between overarching trees.</p>

  <p>It was as lonely and silent a road as you could find in the universe. The
  trees on either hand loomed up like nothing earthly, against a purple sky
  powdered with stars, and a cool breeze, laden with the stench of Egypt, dried
  up the sweat on our foreheads. Flat lands, and irrigated fields criss-crossed
  by motionless shadow spread themselves in a scene that would have made an
  angel melancholy&mdash;until we sighted the Great Pyramid, and were glad we
  had come.</p>

  <p>It looms up on your left above the trees some time before you get to it,
  and is so enormous that your senses refuse to adjust themselves to its
  proportions; for you've nothing else that you ever saw to compare it to, and
  the comparisons they give you in the guide books have no meaning. Men built
  it; that's the amazing thing&mdash;built it three thousand years before the
  Christian era, using blocks of stone that weigh eight hundred tons apiece.
  They not only jacked them into place, but fitted them so skillfully that
  after fifty centuries of constant movement of the earth's crust, with
  earthquakes thrown in at intervals, you still can't shove a knife-blade in
  between the joints. Go and try, if you don't believe me.</p>

  <p>Its purpose surely is to flatten the conceit of anyone who thinks himself
  a marvel-maker&mdash;architect, artist, engineer, politician, financier,
  labor-leader, or whatever he may be. It fills the bill, and Lord, it makes
  modern Egypt look a mean, unmanly place.</p>

  <p>We left the car by the Mena House gate, with the chauffeur fast asleep in
  it the moment we turned our backs on him, and walked the rest of the way,
  none of us saying a word until we came out on top of a new-made government
  road beside a newly opened tomb, and could see the vast pile dwarfing the two
  monsters that stand in line with it. Then Jeremy said "imshi" suddenly, and
  we came to our senses&mdash;awake again in modern Egypt with its professional
  pests.</p>

  <p>You wouldn't think a jackal could approach unseen across that moonlit
  level ground that hides the pyramid's foundations. You wouldn't think, for
  the silence, that a creature stirred, and least of all that anyone would come
  and beg in that magnificent loneliness. But a hooded Arab had seen us and
  crept out of a tomb or somewhere to offer his services as guide, and the
  hale, well-fed ruffian whined as if God had forgotten him.</p>

  <p>Nor would he go away. He spoke English, and insisted on his right to act
  as guide to any stranger coming there. Jeremy kicked him, at which he showed
  fight&mdash;a distinct relief after the whimpering. Then Meldrum Strange
  unwisely gave him money, and he went to call his friends, who came in a
  troop, all tugging at our sleeves and demanding backsheesh for nothing
  whatever.</p>

  <p>Finally I made a bargain with the whole tribe. We would pay the market
  price for being guided through the pyramid passages, but wouldn't go in.
  Instead, we would sit down outside for as long as suited us, and they should
  keep watch at a decent distance, making sure that we didn't run off with the
  pyramid, and protecting us from interruption at the same time.</p>

  <p>That being something for practically nothing, they agreed. We sat down on
  the lowest course of Gizeh's uncovered base, watched from fifty yards away by
  a row of hooded ghouls, who quarreled in whispers over how much more tribute
  they might have made us pay.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I was hardly fair with you fellows this morning," Strange began.
  "It's not my habit to discuss private affairs with anyone. Perhaps I gave the
  impression of inviting you to join me in a hunt that hadn't started yet. If
  so it was a false impression.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing new in this affair. The scene has only shifted from
  Chicago and New York to Cairo. I've been following this up since long before
  the War. During the War our Government engaged my services at a dollar a
  year, and I was forced to let this slide; but directly after the armistice
  was signed I took it up again."</p>

  <p>"Thought you didn't approve of war?" Jeremy interrupted.</p>

  <p>"I don't. But the War was a fact, and I tried to help win it, Some time
  prior to the War I became interested in shipping&mdash;not in a big
  way&mdash;there were four ships of fourteen thousand tons or so that I had to
  take over if I didn't want to lose all my investment. They were British
  ships, at that time in the harbor of Alexandria, without cargoes, and not
  particularly marketable. I planned to transfer them to the U.S. flag, without
  having much notion at the time what all that involved, and I sent a
  representative to Egypt to see if he couldn't drum up a cargo for the States
  that would pay expenses over.</p>

  <p>"There was lots of cotton being shipped from Egypt to the
  States&mdash;millions of dollars' worth. My man made a bid to carry some of
  it, and ran foul of a contract between the Egyptian Board of Commerce and a
  British steamship line, that gave the British a monopoly of that traffic. The
  ships weren't transferred yet to the U.S. flag, you understand, but there was
  one British company that had all the business.</p>

  <p>"My man stormed around, but got nowhere. I cabled him at last to get any
  old cargo that would do for ballast, and to bring the ships over. He met a
  merchant named Poulakis, who agreed to charter the ships. Have you any idea
  how tricky a thing is a charter party? That man Poulakis either bribed my
  agent or blackmailed him&mdash;I never could discover which; some men corrupt
  others automatically. My agent signed an agreement that had more flaws in it
  than you'd think possible to crowd on to one sheet of paper. I couldn't
  countermand it; my man had full authority, and our consul in Alexandria
  registered the contract. Damn it! I can see Poulakis smiling now!"</p>

  <p>"Poulakis?" said Grim. "Was he married?"</p>

  <p>"You bet he was married. Prettiest woman you ever set eyes on; but let me
  tell you first what happened to those ships. You never saw such a contract.
  It was stipulated Poulakis was to have unrestricted use of them at a
  ridiculously low figure for two voyages from Alexandria to New York or
  Boston, and for six months in any case. D'you get that? Six months. Money
  paid down in advance to bind the contract, and our consul's seal and
  signature on the document. Everything absolutely legal, and binding me hand
  and foot. Yet the name of Poulakis didn't appear. At the last minute he rang
  in a corporation in which he held shares.</p>

  <p>"He had no trouble in getting cotton cargoes for all four ships. I daresay
  he could only get away with it once, but once was all he needed. He cut rates
  and loaded the ships full. Sent 'em to Boston. Loaded up a return cargo of
  Springfield rifles, ammunition, dynamite, bayonets, some quick-firing guns,
  revolvers, and lord knows what else&mdash;all down on the manifest as
  hardware. Ordered the ships to sea, and tried to run those cargoes into Egypt
  for some damned revolution or other!</p>

  <p>"Maybe you don't know the law. I wasn't as familiar with it then as I am
  now! Those ships of mine were still under the British flag, you understand.
  Well, Poulakis spent no money on repairs or overhaul; one ship put into
  Gibraltar with her condensers out of kilter, and it took a week to fix 'em,
  but it didn't take the British a tenth of that time to learn what was under
  her hatches. They let her proceed on her voyage, but as each ship drew near
  the Egyptian coast, bum-boats came out at night to run the contraband.
  British caught 'em red-handed of course. British flag; British law; inside
  the three-mile limit. Confiscated everything, ships included.</p>

  <p>"If I'd already transferred 'em to the U.S. flag, I might have been able
  to protect my investment. I don't know. As it was, all I could do was to fire
  the fool who had got me into the infernal mess, and try to get Poulakis into
  jail in order to clear my own character. I sent a trustworthy man to Egypt
  with orders to hire the best lawyer in the country and dig to the roots of
  the whole business. You'd think that should be easy, wouldn't you? Nothing
  more difficult.</p>

  <p>"D'you know what the courts are like here? Each foreign consul has
  jurisdiction over his own nationals. Poulakis claimed he was a Greek, and set
  up a cast-iron alibi of being an innocent shareholder in the corporation that
  chartered the ships. The corporation was bankrupt and the directors had all
  bolted abroad.</p>

  <p>"On top of that the British had their hands full of local politics and
  didn't want the abortive revolution advertised. The lawyer we'd hired was an
  Englishman, and I daresay honest, but English first, as am I all the time. I
  don't blame him. From his point of view I was an American providing ships for
  gun-runners and trying to fix the blame on someone else. Besides, I wasn't on
  the spot; busy with another lawsuit in the States that might have cost me a
  couple of million if I'd neglected it.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, it seemed to me that something should be done about
  Poulakis. It's a public duty to jump on a brute like that, and I owed it to
  myself to clear my name. So I saw the British Embassy in Washington
  and&mdash;you know how they are&mdash;made friends with them. Kind of
  politeness that reminds you of the way they finish the bearings of their
  machinery&mdash;but nothing doing&mdash;no ships back&mdash;only a friendly
  offer to soak Poulakis if that could be done without international
  complications. And mind you, they're men of their word.</p>

  <p>"They must have got after Poulakis promptly; for the next thing Poulakis
  himself arrived in New York with a brand new wife, damned good looking woman
  she was, and she contrived to meet me at the house of a friend.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't help be interested. She was wearing diamonds paid for from the
  profit made out of my ships, and that gave me a parental interest, you might
  say. Amused me, too, to figure out what her game might be. She wasn't more
  than twenty-two or twenty-three. It was possible she'd blab out just the hint
  I needed to flatten her husband thoroughly. And a pretty woman
  is&mdash;well&mdash;damn."</p>

  <p>"We've seen her too," said Jeremy. "Go on."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"If you've seen her, you know very well what I mean! Finish your story and
  we'll tell you ours."</p>

  <p>"Well, she was direct; I'll say that for her, She had the impudence of a
  modern college girl with the skill of an old campaigner. I don't dance. We
  sat out in a corner of my friends' conservatory, and she asked me point blank
  whether I'd had enough of defeat at her husband's hands, I assured her I
  hadn't started on him yet, and she laughed."</p>

  <p>" 'Isn't he clever?' she asked me.</p>

  <p>" 'Damned smart,' said I.</p>

  <p>" 'Then why not make a truce with him,' said she, 'and form a partnership,
  and have the benefit of all his brains?'</p>

  <p>"When a thing like that is sprung on you, you're mighty clever if you have
  an adroit answer ready. To draw out more information I asked her what sort of
  partnership her husband had to offer.</p>

  <p>" 'He doesn't offer,' she answered. 'He compels!'</p>

  <p>"I naturally smiled at that, and she elaborated, 'Mr. Poulakis,' she said,
  'never makes friends until after he has given a taste of his power. If I
  could tell you the whole story of his courtship, you would understand me
  thoroughly. He loved me, but he did not marry me until my parents as well as
  I were aware that he could ruin all of us if we opposed him, and now I love
  him all the more because I know his power. His is the policy of the man in
  armor. The weak ones, who yield too easily, he makes use of, never trusting
  them; from among the strong ones he picks his friends. He has given you a
  taste of his strength, and unlike other rich men I could name you have
  started to fight back. When you went to the British Embassy you caused him
  inconvenience. He inquired about you, and came to have a look at you, unknown
  to yourself. Then he made ready to destroy you; and now that he is quite
  ready he has sent me to tell you this&mdash;that you may choose between peace
  or war.'</p>

  <p>"Imagine listening to that kind of talk from a twenty-three-year-old girl
  in a house on Fifth Avenue! I didn't know whether to laugh or get
  furious."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you kiss her and make her furious?" suggested Jeremy.</p>

  <p>"That's precisely what I did!" Strange answered. "But I asked her first
  what peace between a man like Poulakis and me would mean.</p>

  <p>" 'You would give guarantees,' she said, 'and join us.'</p>

  <p>"I asked her what she meant by 'us,' and then she let the cat out of the
  bag.</p>

  <p>" 'We're the most powerful secret organization in the world,' she
  answered. 'Much more powerful than the Camorra. We make use of others, and
  leave to them the sardines, as it were, that are too small for our big net.
  We are so secret that we haven't a name. Our existence is known and terribly
  feared by many governments, but none can identify us. Our affairs are
  conducted by individuals, but very few individuals know more than two or
  three other members, so none can betray us.'</p>

  <p>" 'And what do you mean by guarantees?' I asked.</p>

  <p>" 'You will find them profitable,' she answered. 'You will be given a
  chance to redeem your losses over that ship transaction, in course of which
  you will break the laws of the United States and two or three other
  countries. And you will receive protection just as long as you behave. If you
  were to misbehave, you would be exposed and go to jail. There wouldn't be
  much that you could tell, but if you should try to be indiscreet you would be
  killed; and all the newspapers would denounce the Black Hand or the Ku Klux
  Klan, or the Camorra, or some other society that has a name. And if you don't
  accept this opportunity, Mr. Meldrum Strange, you will be hammered and
  whipped and bullied and defeated at every turn until you change your mind;
  for my husband is one who never allows another human to refuse him. If you
  elect to give your answer now to me, you will save yourself trouble.
  Otherwise the taming of Meldrum Strange will begin tomorrow morning!'</p>

  <p>" 'All right,' said I. 'I'll give you my answer. Tell Poulakis I've kissed
  his wife. I take it he'll know what that means!'</p>

  <p>"The most remarkable thing about it was that she didn't resist&mdash;at
  least, not much. She wouldn't let me kiss her a second time.</p>

  <p>" 'I like you,' she said. 'You're the kind of man it's fun to fight with!
  So it's war, is it? Well, take this.'</p>

  <p>"She took a diamond ring off the third finger of her left hand and gave it
  to me. 'Send or give that back to me whenever you admit you're beaten!' she
  said.</p>

  <p>"That was the last word I've had with her from then until now, although
  she sent me her photograph by mail at the time of her husband's death, or
  shortly after it. He died in his bed like a Christian, and I'm told the
  funeral was attended by representatives of every foreign government that
  keeps a consulate in Egypt. Here's the ring."</p>

  <p>Meldrum Strange pulled out his watch chain, and unfastened from its end a
  hoop ring set all around with diamonds. The stones weren't very big, but when
  he passed us the ring to examine and Jeremy struck a match they flashed
  splendidly; and they were set, with skill that is rare nowadays, in a briar
  branch carved from platinum. It wasn't a ring that could he easily mistaken
  for another one; there was probably not another like it in the world; and
  inside it the initials Z.P. were inlaid in yellow gold.</p>

  <p>"The fight began next morning at nine o'clock sure enough," said Strange.
  "The office safe in which I kept my private ledger was broken open when I
  reached the office, and the ledger was missing with most of my secrets in it.
  A few securities that were in there hadn't been touched."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">CHAPTER VI<br>
  "The more I'm defeated the harder I fight."</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Strange paused to light a cigar, clasped the ring on the end
  of his chain again, and smoked in silence for several minutes. The only
  creatures moving were the bats flitting between us and the moonlight, and the
  only sound was the murmur of the Arabs' voices from a hundred yards away,
  still discussing ways and means of making us pay tribute. The shadow of the
  Sphinx looked like the pit that silence came from.</p>

  <p>"You've no idea what the loss of that ledger meant to me," Strange went
  on. "It wasn't so much the difficulty of recalling intricate details of
  business known to few except myself. Whoever stole it had the inside facts of
  my positions. If I'd chanced to be overextended at the time I'd have met my
  Waterloo. I still was disposed to laugh at the notion of war waged on me by a
  secret society; but within two days I had to fight like the Old Guard to keep
  myself out of the receiver's hands,</p>

  <p>"Every interest I owned was attacked simultaneously. I'd no sooner
  holstered up one angle than I was squeezed in another. Rumors began to be
  whispered in the street about my solvency. Bankers who had hitherto trusted
  me implicitly began to ask for detailed statements at awkward moments, and to
  call loans without any definite excuse.</p>

  <p>"It was no use squealing. You can't go to the police with a yarn like
  that. They'd laugh at you; and if I'd gone with it to bank directors they'd
  have shut down on my credit like a ton of bricks. There wasn't a thing to do
  but fight on the defensive against an invisible enemy; and as always happens,
  when you really take your coat off and show what you're made of, it left me
  stronger than I started. It forced me to concentrate on stability, building
  up real resources. I had a clean stable by the time I had won the first
  round.</p>

  <p>"So when the War came the fall of prices on the Stock Exchange didn't mean
  much to me, except that bankers who had sent for me a few months before began
  coming around to talk with me instead. I had big sums on demand
  deposit&mdash;and the shoe was on the other foot. I made millions supporting
  the market, saved the bacon of men who'd have been tickled to death six
  months before to see me down and out.</p>

  <p>"And I'd learned principally this&mdash;that governments are figureheads.
  Governments don't want war. Nations don't want it, when they think; but
  they're never given a chance to think. War is brought on by the rascals who
  profit by it. They work the game in a thousand ways, irritating first one
  nation and then the other. The men who do the actual irritating are mostly
  blind victims of an inner clique of devils, who make mischief for sheer
  delight in doing it.</p>

  <p>"I'd been twenty-five years pondering over the why of things, and that
  sharp experience I had served to tear away the veil. When we got into the War
  our Government put me just where I wanted to be, for I'm a hard man to put
  anywhere else. I was attached to the Secret Intelligence Department. and
  you'd be amazed to know what trails and cross-trails came under my notice. Of
  course, the game was to win the War. I'd no time to follow up ninety percent
  of what came my way, but I learned what my business was going to be after the
  War.</p>

  <p>"I made up my mind, in the same way that other men take up charity or
  education. I decided to go devil-hunting. That's the name I call it by. And I
  didn't see why I shouldn't start on this Poulakis gang first of all.</p>

  <p>"So I went to the British Embassy again, and had a long talk. That was
  rather like pulling the plug before starting, but it couldn't be helped, for
  I had to establish understanding with men who might otherwise put insuperable
  obstacles in the way of my doing anything.</p>

  <p>"I did the same thing at the French and Italian Embassies, with the result
  that I have carte blanche as far as they can give it to me. On the other
  hand, in every instance someone in the embassy reported the conversations I'd
  had, and there were three separate attempts made to murder me within the
  week. On top of that, I was sent for by our people and cautioned not to take
  law into my own hands.</p>

  <p>"It would take too long to tell you now all the ramifications of what
  followed. I had to lie low for a while, and I occupied the time in
  rearranging my affairs, making investments that can't be shaken as long as
  the U.S. holds together, and quietly picking up a man here and another there
  who'd be the makings of a first-class team. Then this man Poulakis died. I
  was rather sorry. I'd hoped to lay him by the heels, and I supposed his death
  would mean the end of his organization. However, he hadn't been dead and
  buried thirty days when a man walked into my office as calm as you please and
  asked me for Mrs. Poulakis's diamond ring!</p>

  <p>"He gave his name as Andrieff Alexis, and he said with a smile like a
  well-fed cat's that he supposed I understood on what terms he would accept
  the ring back. We had quite a chin together. He told me the name of every man
  I'd talked with at the different embassies; the name of every man I'd hired
  for my private team, together with some of their past history; and many
  details of the steps I'd already taken toward the task I have in view.</p>

  <p>"He ended by offering to take me over, gang and all, and he promised me
  more power in the world than I'd ever dreamed of if I'd swallow my prejudices
  and come on in. He said incidentally that Poulakis had only been a minor
  agent of the society, which he assured me was stronger than ever but in need
  of some new genuine American blood.</p>

  <p>"So I threw him out of the office. He had the impudence to call the
  police, and I had to give bail for appearance in the magistrate's court; but
  when the case was called he didn't appear to prosecute. He'd gone. Left the
  country.</p>

  <p>"Well, I sent one of my best men to Egypt&mdash;a fellow who knew French
  and Arabic&mdash;with orders to do nothing but mix with the people and
  investigate. He lasted two months. He sent me a letter every day reporting
  progress, and by the time his information was beginning to be worthwhile
  they'd got him, and all that he knew of me into the bargain. He married a
  Levantine woman, and he's in the jail in Alexandria this minute on account of
  some dirty work. The truth is they'd no further use for him, so put him out
  of the way.</p>

  <p>"I sent out a second man, with three assistants. Strict orders to do
  nothing but investigate, and to report to me in code. Fortunately it's one of
  those codes that can be changed completely in ten seconds, for the
  Poulakis-Alexis people had possession of it in a week, and actually had the
  gall to write me a letter composed in it. It was a clever letter, and the
  joke was on me, I admit.</p>

  <p>"So I cabled for those fellows to come home and this time I sent a
  woman&mdash;a rip-snorter&mdash;Angel Halliday&mdash;a she-devil if ever
  there was one, but true to her salt. She'd worked for newspapers, and for
  several years for a detective agency. Face like a frozen chorus girl, and a
  brain that was one perennial question mark. She lasted three months, and got
  drowned&mdash;by accident according to the coroner&mdash;in a boating party
  out at Ramleh. They tell me there's a dreadful undertow at that place. They
  said she got drunk and fell overboard, but I'll believe it when I see that
  stone Sphinx the worse for liquor.</p>

  <p>"I don't know how you men are, but the more I'm defeated the harder I
  fight. Casting about for ways and means I thought of Ramsden and decided to
  come here and see whether he wouldn't lend a hand. I took every precaution:
  started West by train, and returned to New York by auto in the
  night&mdash;boarded the Adriatic secretly under an assumed name, and kept in
  my stateroom all the way to Southampton. There, if you please, I was met by a
  gentleman who called himself Antonio Gambetta, who said he'd reserved a
  compartment for me on the London Express, and presented the compliments of
  Madame Zelmira Poulakis and Mr. Andrieff Alexis! Can you beat it?</p>

  <p>"I had a powwow in the British Foreign Office in London next day. They
  gave me afternoon tea and a letter to the High Commissioner out here,
  requesting him to accord me facilities, whatever those mean.</p>

  <p>"I saw the High Commissioner, and he's a dandy. He explained more Egyptian
  politics in an hour than I could have picked up in a year from other people.
  Told me with one of his dry, explosive laughs that if I'd uncover that gang
  I'm after he'd resign his job in my favor! Made no bones about their being
  too much for his people. Says they've undermined the whole police force and
  corrupted every politician who wasn't already rotting to pieces! He admitted
  quite frankly that even if martial law were re-imposed there'd be no chance
  of scotching any but the small fry.</p>

  <p>"Nothing remarkable happened between that talk I had with you fellows this
  morning and dinner-time, except that I was conscious once or twice of being
  watched; and in the afternoon, when I went to call on the bank through which
  I propose to draw on New York for funds, the manager told me that 'business
  firms' had been making inquiries about me. He refused to name anyone in
  particular; said the inquiries had come through regular business
  channels.</p>

  <p>"Can you wonder that when that note came during dinner I was willing to
  follow you in the auto? It crossed my mind that the message was a trick to
  get you fellows away from me. When you drove off, and I followed, four men
  got into the car behind and followed me. They kept their distance, and when
  we reached that bridge they had disappeared for the time being. But when you
  fellows drove through the gate of that house and it shut behind you I made my
  man drive to a corner, where there was a street lamp, and told him to put up
  the top.</p>

  <p>"It occurred to me I'd be invisible inside the car then, but the car
  itself would be standing in a flood of light so that nobody could approach
  unseen, and I could watch the house conveniently.</p>

  <p>"Well, he put the top up&mdash;sulkily muttering to himself; and he'd just
  finished when the auto that I had thought was following dashed up from the
  opposite direction&mdash;must have driven around several blocks to take me by
  surprise. Did it too. I was caught napping.</p>

  <p>"The four men jumped out and into my car, knocking my chauffeur aside. Two
  of them sat on the seat in front of me with pistols pointed at my head, one
  man drove the car, and the other sat beside him. They weren't native
  Egyptians; they were Cairene dudes with polished finger-nails, physically
  contemptible, and out of breath from excitement and the mere jumping from one
  car into the other. But they had business-like guns, and I sat still, and I
  didn't make any motion that would suggest I had a gun of my own.</p>

  <p>"I'm not given to making a fuss. The other fellow's sure to say something
  if you keep still long enough. The dude who sat on my left had a long,
  inquisitive, triangular nose with a smart smile underneath it, and he
  couldn't keep silent to save his soul.</p>

  <p>" 'Let us hope for your sake that you have the ring with you, Mr. Meldrum
  Strange&mdash;the ring of Madame Poulakis,' he said. 'We are working on the
  theory that you have decided to be sensible. We are willing to pretend to
  believe that you came to Egypt for the sole purpose of capitulating. We are
  generous enough to suppose that you accumulated all those nice liquid
  resources in America, and arranged with bankers here, in order to be able to
  contribute substantially to our funds. At the house to which we will escort
  you, you will find all facilities in readiness for writing instructions to
  your bank; we even have a gold pen for you with a diamond on the end to
  scratch your nose with.'</p>

  <p>"Well, as soon as he said that, of course, I realized that the odds were
  in my favor. A dead man can't write checks; they wanted me alive and fit for
  business. The car wasn't going fast; the driver didn't seem to know his
  business very well, and they were running every corner they came to, with the
  idea, I suppose, of confusing my sense of direction; and as luck would have
  it we ran right into an accident. Two huge limousines with women in them had
  collided and were swung across the street. There were two Egyptian policemen,
  about eight extravagantly dressed females, two chauffeurs, and two footmen
  all arguing at the top of their lungs, and a crowd was collecting to watch
  the fun.</p>

  <p>"The driver of my car tried to pass on the sidewalk, and he used the crowd
  as if they were weeds and he driving a mower. But a lamp-post stopped him,
  and I just opened the door and stepped out. I guess they'd have used their
  guns in that pinch, but you see the cops were sore with them for disobeying
  the order to stop. They'd come near hurting quite a bunch of people. Maybe
  the cops wanted a change of argument anyway. They had to put their guns out
  of sight in a hurry, and I was glad I hadn't exhibited mine.</p>

  <p>"I cleared out, as you may suppose. Didn't run. No need to. Simply walked
  back in the direction we'd come from. Hadn't much notion where I was, but
  guessed I'd find my way to somewhere if I kept on walking. I had it in mind
  to ask for police headquarters and start a hue and cry for you fellows, but
  hadn't much faith in the police after that talk with the High
  Commissioner.</p>

  <p>"Walked along weighing the pros and cons of it, keeping to the broadest
  streets and out of the shadows as much as possible.</p>

  <p>"I can't have been far away from the house you fellows entered&mdash;I
  knew I was heading toward the Nile&mdash;when my four friends turned up again
  in the same car, overtaking me; and although there were two or three
  carriages in sight, and half a dozen pedestrians, they slowed down while
  three of them opened fire.</p>

  <p>"They made poor shooting, Lord be praised. Broke a window and splintered a
  painted wooden gate, but missed me by yards. However, I made believe I was
  mortally hit. Spun round once, and fell, as I once saw a man do on Fourteenth
  Street New York when the gangsters were fighting outside Sharkey's Bar. And
  same as he did, I got up as soon as their backs were turned.</p>

  <p>"Nobody inquired whether I was hurt or not. The carriages hurried by. The
  people on foot ran for cover, and no one seemed to be home in the house with
  the broken window. Not a cop in sight. I walked on, cursing the authorities
  and everybody. My dress suit was in a beastly mess.</p>

  <p>"However, I came on an auto that had just brought someone home, and the
  chauffeur had a whisk-broom. Made him brush me down, and hired him for the
  night at any price he asked. Then, as it wasn't yet midnight, I drove to a
  street corner near the end of the bridge and waited. Didn't have to wait
  long. Saw that unmistakable carriage go by with the doors open and two of you
  fellows rubbering&mdash;waited a while longer to find out whether you were
  being followed&mdash;came after you&mdash;saw you standing on the
  bridge&mdash;and there you are. Now tell me what happened to you, and after
  that whether you won't all three help me bring these swine to book."</p>

  <p>We had told him about half of our experience, first Jeremy, then I taking
  up the tale, with Grim tossing in a word or two at intervals, when I noticed
  a disturbance among the Arabs who were watching us. Desert moonlight outlines
  everything sharply, yet conceals all details; at a fair distance you can see
  a man distinctly, but can't tell his face from the back of his head. However,
  it seemed to me that some of that gang of licensed freebooters had turned
  about and were looking the other way. At the end of a couple of minutes I was
  sure of it.</p>

  <p>Jeremy bit off a word mid-way. All four of us froze motionless in answer
  to that eerie thrill that warns you of something that is going to happen in
  the dark. It was absurd to imagine danger out in that place, for those Arabs
  would be deprived of their perquisites if visitors should come to serious
  harm. Yet danger frequently is absurd. Absurdity makes it dangerous. You
  refuse to believe in it, and it gets you while you laugh.</p>

  <p>But we were in no mood to feel safe anywhere that night. If those pyramid
  custodians had suddenly attacked us none of us would have been surprised. But
  as a matter of fact it was their business alertness that saved our skins
  whole, and when it came to settling with them I never paid extravagant
  largess more willingly.</p>

  <p>Their claim is, and they enforce it chiefly by grace of clamor and
  importunity, that no man may approach those pyramids without their escort and
  without paying them for the privilege. It's a sure thing nobody gets by
  them.</p>

  <p>The hotel, near which we had left our car, was well beyond normal earshot,
  as well as out of sight, so we had heard no other car come to a stand there.
  However, a car had come. During the interval while our chauffeur was being
  interrogated, the Arabs sat still, with some of them facing toward us and the
  rest turned about on the alert for new arrivals. So that, although six men
  presently came creeping uphill, avoiding the white road, the Guardians of
  Gizeh spotted them as owls spot mice; only, unlike owls, they promptly made a
  noise about it, not swooping down on silent wing, but setting up a
  view-halloo as they leapt to their feet and ran to meet the intruders
  half-way.</p>

  <p>Quite a number of them&mdash;four or five at any rate&mdash;continued to
  watch us, and even came closer, lest in the disturbance we should escape
  without paying our scot.</p>

  <p>About twelve of then pounced on the newcomers, and the cat-and-dog-fight
  argument that followed was typical of Egypt&mdash;wonderful, colorful calm
  slit to tatters by foul cursing that sounds like smashing dishes!</p>

  <p>I don't care how phlegmatic you are by temperament, you'll hate that voice
  of Egypt, cursed and cursing. It's the mother of bad tempers and the poisoner
  of judgment, and how the British have lived and ruled in the midst of it
  these fifty years passes understanding. Though I am told there are idiots who
  envy them and want to grab their heritage.</p>

  <p>"Hell! Let's get out of this!" exclaimed Jeremy. "Tourists, I'll bet you,
  come to knock souvenirs off monuments! Rammy, you pay the holdup men. Jim,
  I'll give you and Strange a minute's start and race you to the car."</p>

  <p>Instead, we laughed. Danger had announced itself, incongruous again. As if
  answering Jeremy's proposal for a race, the starting shot rang through the
  stillness and a nickel bullet clicked on the ancient stone behind us, neatly
  bisecting the distance between Meldrum Strange and me.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">CHAPTER VII<br>
  "We're invading the United States this year, you know!"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">You couldn't pick a worse place in which to attack four
  able-bodied men possessed of repeating pistols&mdash;provided they know the
  Great Pyramid intimately, as we did not. We'd all of us read about the thing,
  and seen pictures of it; I had even been inside it twenty years before, and
  had a rather hazy memory of the entrance passage. I knew it led upward at a
  sharp angle, after first starting downward, but forgot all about Al Mamoun's
  forced opening that leads into the ascending passage, enabling you to reach
  the so-called King's Chamber without first tackling the rather difficult
  descent.</p>

  <p>The Mamoun opening was before us. In the dark I mistook it for the proper
  one, which is several courses higher up; and the others clambered up to it
  after me. Imagining ourselves well in the mouth of the only entrance, peering
  out like insects from ninety million cubic feet of granite and limestone, we
  laughed to another tune, minded to stay there until morning if necessary.</p>

  <p>But again the unexpected happened. The pyramid Arabs decamped.</p>

  <p>I suppose that having no firearms they preferred to watch the battle from
  a distance, and I'd be hard put to it to say why they should have risked
  being shot in order to prevent strangers of an alien race from shooting one
  another.</p>

  <p>The Arabs had hardly vanished before the game, whatever the game might he,
  was on in deadly earnest.</p>

  <p>The enemy were not using pistols after the first few rounds. They had
  rifles fitted with Maxim silencers, and made damned straight shooting. Out of
  seven shots, for instance, they put three through Jeremy's tuxedo jacket; he
  was propping it on a stick and fooling them beautifully, but there aren't
  many men who could beat that shooting at three hundred yards by moonlight,
  especially when you consider we were fifty feet above ground level. These
  evidently weren't the dudes with polished finger-nails who had missed Strange
  in the street. They were gunmen.</p>

  <p>Because of the silencers we couldn't tell for a long time how many men
  there were. They were behind some dbris thrown out of a newly excavated
  tomb, but the clip-clip of bullets kept up so steadily all around us that we
  supposed at least six men were blazing away. It was Grim who spotted there
  were only three of them.</p>

  <p>"I've been watching the flash. Three men shooting to keep us occupied.
  What are the other three up to?"</p>

  <p>"Laying a blasting charge under the Pyramid!" suggested Jeremy. "Who cares
  what they're up to? I like to see 'em work!"</p>

  <p>I had said we were safe in the only entrance, and we had all been intent
  on watching the shadow creep slowly sidewise as the moon pursued her destiny,
  inch by inch uncovering the ground our enemy had chosen. They lay at last
  distinctly visible&mdash;three men crouching on a heap of broken
  rock&mdash;three parallel dark blots. And there had certainly been six
  men.</p>

  <p>"I counted six," said Meldrum Strange. His voice sounded nervous.</p>

  <p>"Six there surely were," said Grim. "If they're active men they may have
  climbed on the pyramid somewhere behind us. They could come along one of the
  upper courses and then jump on us from above."</p>

  <p>"If that's all, we needn't worry," I answered. "Dropping down on top of us
  in face of their friends' fire would be a bit too dangerous for men who're
  not committing suicide. All we need do is retire farther into the hole
  whenever there's a pause in the shooting."</p>

  <p>It was conjurer Jeremy who saved that night for us, and only in the nick
  of time.</p>

  <p>"The hand deceives the eye," he said, and whistled. "There's a game on.
  We've watched three. The other three worked it. We didn't build this pyramid.
  Who said it's solid? Jim, you're skipper; shoot!"</p>

  <p>"All right. Back into the hole!" Grim answered. "The light'll be in our
  favor if they try to rush the entrance."</p>

  <p>Strange struck a match, but the draft blew it out. We entered in single
  file, Grim leading, all bending low because the bullets coming upward at an
  angle threatened nothing but our heads. It's no use trying to tell how dark
  it was. Each kept one hand on the shoulder of the man in front and we did a
  lockstep into the womb of dreadful night, pursued by bullets that clicked
  overhead and sent noises like the ticking of an enormous mechanism along into
  the dark ahead of us. Those sounds and their echoes were almost our undoing,
  for they prevented our hearing others that were less assertive and more
  deadly.</p>

  <p>Mamoun's forced entrance that we were in isn't very long. We began to see
  ahead of us a patch of darkness less opaque. Whereas we might have been blind
  before, there was proof now that we had eyes; we could actually see the
  darkness, which was puzzling because the farther we advanced the less light
  there ought to have been. But we had forgotten about Mamoun's passage. It was
  Grim, groping the way in the lead, who first got the hang of things and
  realized that our passage was a false one, leading at an angle into the
  real.</p>

  <p>"Something wrong," he said. "The stone's all rough."</p>

  <p>His voice went booming away ahead of us until the echoes died in a gurgle
  somewhere. Then suddenly he shouted:</p>

  <p>"Down everybody! Flat down!"</p>

  <p>If our nerves hadn't been strung to the jumping point, that would have
  been our last experience in this world. But we went down like a set of
  ninepins all together, just as two pistols each flashed three times, and I
  swear I could feel the wind of a bullet breathe along my backbone as I fell
  prone alongside Jeremy.</p>

  <p>I've never been able to believe those tales about taking in a whole
  situation by pistol-flash. I think they're usually what the French call
  l'esprit d'escalier&mdash;the things that occur to a man on the way
  down-stairs, that he might have thought of at the time if he'd had wit
  enough. The first and only instinct aroused by a pistol flash a few yards
  from my face is the necessity to fight like two men and a boy; and I'll
  answer for four men on that occasion&mdash;Grim, who has met as many
  emergencies as any fellow living; Strange, a millionaire, whose fighting had
  all been done hitherto in law-courts and on the Stock Exchange; Jeremy,
  self-trained for the love of it in the art of legerdemain, which means swift
  hand, swifter eye, and swiftest wit; and myself. Not one of us knew quite
  what had happened. Not one of us failed to fight back instantly.</p>

  <p>Our antagonists came on before we had time to draw our own pistols. Having
  the advantage of surprise they made the most of it, and were on top of us
  before the after-flash had left our eyes. But they were on top of the wrong
  outfit for what you'd call a comfortable time, and three to four in the
  bargain, which is awkward odds.</p>

  <p>I don't know what the others did. I got a man's leg in both hands, and a
  kick in the teeth from Grim's heel that didn't pacify me any to speak of; and
  I'd hate to have to go through life with what was left of the fellow's leg
  when I had finished with it. We weren't fighting in the dark any more, for
  they loosed their pistols off like fireworks; but a gunman is at a
  disadvantage at close range, for he puts faith in his weapon and is just that
  much handicapped. There's a little nick in my right ear that I came by that
  night, and Jeremy's cheek got hurried a bit; Grim's left hand was barked by a
  bullet; Strange got a kick in the stomach that took his wind and made him
  vomit, and a bullet through the skin under his lower left rib. Otherwise,
  although they had emptied their pistols before we really got going, those
  three men had nothing much to brag about.</p>

  <p>SO FAR so good. I dare say thirty seconds saw the end of them with my
  great rump planted firmly on the stomach of a man too stunned to squirm much,
  and Strange close beside me making noises like a sea-sick excursionist.
  Jeremy was holding down two men&mdash;the one whose leg I'd twisted and
  another, and Grim was already scouting forward to see whether by any chance
  the enemy had reserves in hiding around the corner in the other passage.</p>

  <p>I guess we should have been caught again, and done for this time, if one
  of Jeremy's prisoners hadn't started screaming.</p>

  <p>Funny, isn't it, how old memories crop up. The only man I ever had heard
  scream that way was a tramp, who was being washed against his will in a
  small-town lock-up; you could hear him all over town, and the women sent a
  committee of twenty to investigate. That was forty years ago, but the whole
  picture came to mind that instant; the tramp was given ham and eggs for
  supper and five dollars, which at the time impressed my schoolboy mind in a
  way no scream ever did.</p>

  <p>Yet I don't believe I recalled the incident for thirty-five years until
  that fellow started screaming in the pyramid passage, and I knew he wasn't
  hurt but merely summoning the neighbors.</p>

  <p>They came with rifles, in place of ham and eggs&mdash;three of them,
  scrambling up the rough stone blocks outside&mdash;and I heard them, thanks
  to that uncleanly but strategic tramp, whose shade may Allah bless!</p>

  <p>"Out of this!" I shouted. "Straight on&mdash;up the ramp&mdash;into the
  King's Chamber&mdash;we can hold out up there till Christmas!"</p>

  <p>Grim led the way with a hand on the wall; Jeremy pulled Strange along,
  half-supporting half-dragging him until his wind should recover; and having
  nothing else to do with one hand, I seized the fellow who was doing all the
  screaming and dragged him last.</p>

  <p>I was possessed of a good notion and a bad one, although opinions may
  differ as to which was which.</p>

  <p>I thought that a man who could feel so sorry for himself, if made a mite
  more sorry, could be induced to tell tales out of school. And it further
  seemed to me that, since he had been so keen to summon the riflemen, he might
  as well act as a shield between us and their bullets. He wasn't much of a
  shield, for he wriggled like an eel and didn't weigh more than a hundred and
  twenty pounds or so; moreover, he managed to draw an ordinary pocket-knife
  and tried to stab me with it, neglecting fortunately in his panic to open the
  blade. If I had let him have his way and break free he would have been shot
  dead by his friends, for we were hardly around the bend in the passage before
  the three riflemen stopped to fire a volley, and I guess they fired low by
  the way the bullets acted.</p>

  <p>They surely were ruthless. It didn't matter to them whom they hit,
  provided they killed us in the bargain. The man I had been sitting on was
  shot, for I heard him yell, and the other fellow, whom Jeremy had been
  holding, roared out to them in French to hold their fire. They dropped him
  with the second volley. It didn't seem to me to be a good gang to belong to,
  and I wondered whether they had drawn lots, or what, for the privilege of
  taking us in the rear. Anyhow, I had saved the life of my enemy, so for once
  I was a Christian in deed if not by intention.</p>

  <p>Have you ever seen a diagram of the inside of the Great Pyramid? The
  passages bear about the same proportion to the whole bulk that a worm-hole
  does to an apple. There's a long, low, straight, narrow passage leading
  upward at an angle of twenty-five degrees that opens into what is called the
  Grand Gallery, which leads upward again to the very center of the Pyramid and
  to what guide-books call the King's Chamber. The authorities had laid wooden
  boards on the narrow floor of the ascending passage with frets across to make
  the ascent easier for tourists; so, once Grim had groped for the lower end in
  the dark, we went up at a fair pace, Jeremy falling back behind me as soon as
  Strange had his second wind, shooting his pistol off at random to delay
  pursuit.</p>

  <p>There's a well-shaft, leading down into a cavern in the foundations at a
  break in the floor, and another passage leading into the small Queen's
  Chamber at the point where the ascending ramp opens into the Grand Gallery,
  and there we stopped to consider matters. Provided we kept back out of the
  line of fire we were safe there against anyone or anything unless they tried
  to smoke us out, which was almost an impossibility without cans of poison
  gas, for it would take hours and limitless fuel to produce smoke enough.
  Neither did running away any farther from three men, although they had
  rifles, seem to be the game.</p>

  <p>"Let's go for them!" said Jeremy, who never recommended or enjoyed Fabian
  tactics in all his life.</p>

  <p>The words were hardly out of his mouth when a fool at the bottom of the
  ramp switched on a flashlight, and the man beside him fired a shot at random.
  All four of us returned the shot. The flashlight fell, with the switch on,
  and across the pool of light it made we saw the legs of three men vanishing.
  I guess two of them were pretty badly hit, and Jeremy, who went down at once
  to get the flashlight, reported considerable blood on the stone at the foot
  of the ramp.</p>

  <p>It looked rather like the end of hostilities for that night. It was dusty
  and hot inside that mountain of stone; we were all getting thirsty,
  especially Strange, and there was nothing amusing in the prospect of a vigil
  in there until dawn. But, as Grim remarked, we'd probably get sniped on our
  way out if we tried to escape before daylight.</p>

  <p>"And besides, we've a prisoner."</p>

  <p>Jeremy turned the flashlight on him. He started to yell again as if he
  were being tortured.</p>

  <p>"You're making a noise too soon," said Grim. "We're going to question you,
  and if your statements don't tally with what we know, we're going to put the
  glowing ends of cigarettes to all the tender places we can find."</p>

  <p>I disliked the prospect of that nearly as much as our prisoner did. When
  Grim says a thing he means it, and I would not have refused to help him.</p>

  <p>The prisoner was a good-looking fellow, a little bit too smoothly groomed
  and rounded off to win instant favor with any but the underworld. His silk
  suit was torn, but he still looked foppish. One side of his face was almost
  intellectual, the other obviously criminal, and both sides were impudent, his
  bright eyes peering at you sharply like a sparrow's. There was a something
  pathetic about him that you couldn't exactly diagnose, and he had little bits
  of feet encased in patent-leather shoes, and jeweled rings on three fingers
  of each hand.</p>

  <p>"We'll take you where your yells can't be heard," said Grim. "Where's the
  King's Chamber, Ramsden?"</p>

  <p>You couldn't miss the way, now that we had a light&mdash;up the Grand
  Gallery, climbing along the ramp on one side&mdash;under a low block that
  they call the Granite Leaf&mdash;through a tiny antechamber&mdash;and into
  the Mystery of Mysteries, the oblong room with unadorned, polished granite
  walls, containing a stone-sarcophagus that never held mummy nor had lid. I've
  read eight or nine books that pretend to tell the secret of that thirty-four
  by seventeen room in the midst of ninety million cubic feet of squared stone
  and don't believe that any of them have it right. It's still the mother of
  all secrets&mdash;as the Sphinx, smiling outside in the desert
  admits&mdash;and the very place in which to hear secrets told. We sat our
  prisoner down on the dusty floor with his back to the sarcophagus, and Grim,
  squatting down in front of him, got busy.</p>

  <p>Grim is an expert. He goes at his man as if unraveling a knot, picking out
  the key-snarl cannily. I would have asked what the fighting meant, beginning
  at the loose end, as it were, but not so he. He began by requesting us all to
  light cigarettes, so we leaned with our backs against the wall facing the
  entrance and smoked, although the sweat was streaming from us and tobacco
  tasted like salt fish; but the hint wasn't lost on our prisoner.</p>

  <p>"You gentlemen wouldn't do such a thing as that?" he whined in English.
  "You look like decent men, surely you wouldn't demean yourselves by burning a
  little man like me? You're not seriously injured, and it wasn't I
  who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Answer me!" Grim commanded. "On what terms may Mr. Meldrum Strange
  surrender, and to whom?"</p>

  <p>If he had turned and shot me, I wouldn't have been more astonished. The
  face of Meldrum Strange was good to see.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;to Madame Poulakis&mdash;he must marry Madame
  Poulakis&mdash;that is understood. He must marry her and make
  settlement."</p>

  <p>Strange coughed explosively, too contemptuous for words.</p>

  <p>"Maybe I'd do instead?" Jeremy suggested. "I'd settle a rosy future on
  her. Strange, old boy, why not hire me to act substitute?"</p>

  <p>"It's not too late to surrender?" demanded Grim.</p>

  <p>Our prisoner answered excitedly:</p>

  <p>"Why no; no, no; of course not! Our people would be quite
  satisfied&mdash;only we all have to commit ourselves, you know, or there'd be
  no loyalty."</p>

  <p>"Your people, eh? What's your name? Quick! Out with it!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't mind telling you Poulakis is my name. I'm a nephew of the
  great Poulakis; everybody knows that. Ask anyone in Cairo, and they'll tell
  I'm mixed up in all the Hig' Lif'. But you can't get evidence against me;
  that's where the rub comes in! I've been tried lots of times. I've even been
  court-martialed. Hee!"</p>

  <p>He was recovering his vanity, which is what some men pack instead of
  pluck. It's often hard to tell the difference, until you prick the
  container.</p>

  <p>"Suppose we take off one of those silk socks and a pretty patent-leather
  shoe. They say there's a place between a man's toes where fire hurts
  horribly," said Grim.</p>

  <p>Mr. Poulakis junior sat on both feet at once like a Turk and shuddered.
  Jeremy held the spotlight on him steadily and he hadn't a private emotion
  left&mdash;couldn't glance timidly sidewise at us without Grim knowing
  it.</p>

  <p>"What proof have we," demanded Grim, "that if Mr. Meldrum Strange
  surrenders he won't be murdered?"</p>

  <p>"No proof. Absolutely none. We never offer proof. We simply keep our
  promises. Never fail to do that. Never, never. That's all the trouble with
  that man Strange; we promised we'd get him if he didn't accept the offer that
  was made him, and we'll do it; you needn't doubt that for a minute. We'll
  certainly do it. If we broke promises there'd be no fear of us or faith in
  us."</p>

  <p>"Are you authorized to make promises?" Grim asked him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, not at all. I'm working my way in, you know. I'm what we call a
  gentleman cadet. You see, I had influence of the best sort, being the great
  Poulakis's nephew."</p>

  <p>"Knew awkward secrets I suppose?" Grim suggested.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. I knew a thing or two. But that wouldn't have helped. It was
  even a disadvantage. But the family connection helped to offset that. Oh,
  that's no secret; everyone in Cairo knows my influence. I get more practice
  than perhaps you'd think."</p>

  <p>"Practice?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes. I'm a lawyer. Believe me, I win cases for the right people. If
  the people who are slated to lose bring a case to me, I tell them I'm too
  busy and send them elsewhere."</p>

  <p>"Why should Mr. Meldrum Strange marry Madame Poulakis?" Grim demanded.
  "Wouldn't settlements be enough without that?"</p>

  <p>"Oh dear no. We find wives for all the big fish that come into our net.
  They'll make me marry, when I'm strong enough to be dangerous. The rule is
  that you mustn't trust a man without a woman to keep him from turning honest.
  So many men, you know, get sentimentally moral as they grow successful."</p>

  <p>"Madame Poulakis is considered strong enough to manage Mr. Meldrum
  Strange?"</p>

  <p>"Oh certainly. But, if you want my candid opinion, she's a bit of a
  handful for them as things are. She's inclined to be romantic, and that's the
  deuce. All Cairo has heard of her goings-on. She believes in esoteric
  foolishness. Keeps an Indian magician to study the stars and do hocus-pocus.
  I've heard a story about her being in love with Meldrum Strange. No doubt she
  wants to be the wife of an American millionaire, and that would suit our
  people finely. We're invading the United States this year, you know."</p>

  <p>"You want Mr. Meldrum Strange to go back there and work for you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's it. He'd be heavy artillery, wouldn't he! Of course, as I
  told you, I'm not in the inner council, only a gentleman cadet. We have
  cadets, too, who aren't gentlemen, but they never learn anything except how
  to do the rough work. The five who were with me tonight were Plain cadets.
  They just do what they're told. The highest promotion they can get is to be
  master-craftsmen; except that there's said to be one grand-master-craftsman
  who is on the inner council. But I don't really know about that; only members
  of the inner council know who the inner council really are."</p>

  <p>"Fortunate we caught you, isn't it!" said Grim.</p>

  <p>"For me, yes. Not for you, unless you're sensible. Your only chance of
  escaping with your lives is to be sensible and yield. We never fail to keep
  our promises."</p>

  <p>"How d'you make it out fortunate for you that we caught you?" Grim
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"Well, you see&mdash;that's obvious, isn't it? I was sent out tonight to
  get you. If I'd gone back with a failure against me, I expect that would have
  been the end of my prospects. But if I deliver you alive they'll consider me
  for a more important post. I'm glad to have this chance to talk with you. You
  can kill me, but that won't help you. You can take me back with you to Cairo,
  perhaps, and lodge me in the jail&mdash;also perhaps; but I think you would
  never reach Cairo. If you do reach Cairo, you can report all I've said;
  somebody will write down your statement with his tongue in his cheek, and you
  can all four solemnly swear to it. Unofficially quite a number of people will
  believe you, because you will be telling what quite a number of people know.
  But the newspapers will say you are mad, and officially your story will be
  described as a mere mare's nest. Also, you will die. Our agents are
  everywhere."</p>

  <p>"Whereas, if Mr. Meldrum Strange surrenders?" Grim suggested.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Then it is equally simple. If he surrenders and gives proper
  guarantees, there will then be initiation. Once initiated, he may recommend
  you others. If recommended, you will be given a chance to prove your
  availability. But if he prefers not to recommend you, you will be killed, of
  course, in order to protect him."</p>

  <p>"What is the use of listening to you, if you're not allowed to make
  promises?" Grim asked him.</p>

  <p>"I am allowed to accept the surrender of Meldrum Strange."</p>

  <p>At that he raised his voice, and his eyes sought those of Meldrum Strange
  among the shadows.</p>

  <p>"Let Meldrum Strange take a leaf out of our book," he said slowly. "Let
  him remember promises. I'm told that once in New York he kissed Madame
  Poulakis and said to her, 'When you're tired of your crook of a husband, come
  to me. I'm single.' They tell me Meldrum Strange has never married. What a
  romance for him! What an adventure! I wish I were in his shoes!"</p>

  <p>Grim thought a minute, in the way a man studies a chess-board, taking his
  chin in his left hand.</p>

  <p>"Give me that torch, and take him out of earshot, Jeremy," he said at
  last.</p>

  <p>So Jeremy took our prisoner by the shoulder and shoved him out under the
  Granite Leaf, through the so-called anteroom into the Grand Gallery,
  whispering out of the corner of his mouth as he handed the torch to
  Grim&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Cast my vote, Jim."</p>

  <p>Grim waited until Jeremy's whistle announced that he had reached the
  farther end of the Grand Gallery; but he had already made his mind up, and
  his face as he went and leaned his back against the sarcophagus was a picture
  of satisfied amusement. "How about it, Strange?" he asked. "If Grim, Ramsden,
  and Ross agree to join this hunt with you, are you game to surrender to that
  gang and track things down to a conclusion?"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">CHAPTER VIII<br>
  "Indiscreet subjected to sympathy."</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Meldrum Strange hesitated palpably. He didn't like handing
  over to Grim the direction in general, which was what Grim's proposal
  amounted to. I don't think he was afraid of being killed; but he didn't enjoy
  the possibility of being found with proof on his person of connection with
  crooks. Obviously, if ever the crooks should begin to suspect him, their
  simplest course would be to expose him and leave the law to take its
  course.</p>

  <p>"You see," said Grim, making the flashlight dance on the ancient wall in
  front of him, "the only possible way to destroy this organization is from the
  inside. Their strength must lie in having accomplices in government
  departments. So if we join them and try to protect ourselves at the same time
  by informing the authorities, some spy in a high place is sure to give our
  game away. It's the whole hog or nothing. Either quit, and escape with our
  lives&mdash;which I think I can show you how to do; or turn our backs on
  society and plunge right in, trusting to clear ourselves at the proper time.
  My advice to you, Strange, is to back out of it and run for cover. That's
  personal; man to man."</p>

  <p>"I won't do that," Strange answered, beginning to chew one of his cigars.
  "I suppose we could take the High Commissioner into our confidence."</p>

  <p>Grim laughed.</p>

  <p>"He'd put the hat on the whole thing right away. Imagine yourself High
  Commissioner. Imagine an American millionaire coming to you with any such
  proposal. Think what a fix you'd be in if he should get scuppered, with the
  U.S. newspapers roaring for your blood, and the members of this secret gang
  working to prove that the dead millionaire was really responsible for all the
  sins of Egypt! You would tell the millionaire to get out of the country
  quick. You made a bad break consulting him yesterday, if you don't mind my
  talking frankly."</p>

  <p>"Then you propose to join this gang?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly. There has got to be a point of contact. You can't catch fish on
  dry land. You can't squelch crime from an armchair. You've got to dig down
  in."</p>

  <p>"Good enough, but Hell, you heard what was said about guarantees. They'll
  expect me to commit a murder, or something like that.</p>

  <p>"They'll know you wouldn't take to murder. They know human nature. They'll
  have everything arranged. Depend on it, if you accept their terms, they'll
  take a first mortgage on your freedom, as well as considerable cash. And
  after that, if one of us makes one false step, 'Mafeesh&mdash;finish!' as the
  Arabs say. Watch your step, Strange!"</p>

  <p>We discussed the pros and cons for half an hour; and little by little,
  what with the ancient mystery of the place with its four smoke-blackened,
  hand-rubbed granite walls that have stood for five thousand years without as
  much as hinting at their purpose, the excitement of fighting in that ancient
  place, and all his determination that had brought him as far as Egypt on a
  quixotic mission, Strange did what was inevitable.</p>

  <p>"I'll go you, Grim," he said at last. "I've no family to speak of; only
  distant relatives, who'll contest my will if I don't outlive them. There are
  clubs I belong to that&mdash;oh, well, all that looks rather small from this
  distance. Call your friend Jeremy. I'll go you."</p>

  <p>So I whistled and Jeremy drove Poulakis junior along in front of him,
  taking the flashlight back from Grim and turning it on each of our faces. He
  didn't need to ask questions. Neither did Poulakis.</p>

  <p>"How should I communicate with Madame Poulakis?" Strange demanded.</p>

  <p>"Easily!" Poulakis answered perkily. "Send me. If you were to leave this
  pyramid without sending me in advance, you would never reach Cairo alive, you
  know. Even if I were with you, that wouldn't help. They'd kill me too! The
  only thing is for me to let the right people know that you've surrendered at
  discretion."</p>

  <p>"How do you propose to return to Cairo?" Strange demanded.</p>

  <p>"Well, I shall not use your car, for it will not be there. By the way, you
  owe me for the hire of that car. I paid the man two pounds and sent him off,
  so as to get him out of the way. I expected to recoup myself out of your
  pockets after we had shot you. I have saved you three pounds; you had agreed
  to pay him much too much. Suppose you liquidate the obligation; honor between
  thieves, you know!"</p>

  <p>It was as good as a show to see Strange battle with emotion as he peeled
  two 1-pound notes off a wad and passed them over. He enjoyed it about as much
  as a missionary would like putting wood under a cannibal's cooking pot, and
  Grim turned his face away to hide a smile. But Jeremy jumped to the occasion,
  establishing himself firmly in the good opinion of Poulakis junior.</p>

  <p>"Match you for it!" he said instantly. "Come on. I'll toss you for the two
  pounds!"</p>

  <p>Jeremy's silver coin hung in the air. Poulakis cried "Heads!" and Jeremy
  gave him two more pounds, hardly glancing at the coin as he caught it.</p>

  <p>"Again&mdash;double or quits!" he insisted, and this time it was Poulakis
  who spun a coin; but Jeremy cried "Tails," and it was Jeremy who caught it in
  mid-air, and displayed it in his palm head-upward. He passed over two more
  pounds.</p>

  <p>"I've only one pound left," he said then. "Want to toss for that?"</p>

  <p>Poulakis won. Jeremy paid with a laugh. Grim took the flashlight and led
  the way out into the Grand Gallery, Jeremy falling behind to whisper to
  Strange and me.</p>

  <p>"Let that sort of snipe think you're a gambler and he's easy forever
  after. Play high and lose to 'em. Nothing makes 'em trust you sooner. Let's
  all bet like the Devil whenever we think we're being watched. Show the cash.
  We can straighten up afterward."</p>

  <p>If Jeremy could have his way, the world would be run like a Gilbert and
  Sullivan opera, with Jeremy flitting from pillar to post uncovering laughs as
  swiftly as the audience could stand it. We agreed to become gamblers.</p>

  <p>At the foot of the first ascending passage the blood had almost vanished,
  soaked up in the limestone dust. There was no sign of a dead man, although
  there was blood on the floor of Al-Mamoun's tunnel, where the rifle-volley
  had just missed us and caught our opponents. Our assailants had sneaked in
  and carried away their fallen. Moreover they had gone, for the pyramid
  entrance was blocked by the Arab guides, who clamored for their money,
  demanding ten times what they had bargained for because of what had taken
  place. Poulakis himself drove a bargain with two of them to carry him as far
  as the Mena House Hotel "because the sand might get into his shoes."</p>

  <p>So they bore him off, we continuing to sit there yawning, watching the
  dawn rise mauve and golden, watched in turn by the remainder of the guides.
  We didn't propose to pay them as long as they would sit there and protect us
  by their presence from another surprise attack, any more than they proposed
  to let us out of arm's reach until they had our money.</p>

  <p>And you know, the dawn makes an awful lot of difference to the aspect of a
  plan. Be as enthusiastic as you choose within four walls in the dark, you'll
  need to be a man of iron resolution to feel the same way outdoors in the
  early morning. The earth begins to look more real, and the ideas visionary.
  Difficulties, that in the dark were part of the dark and as intangible and
  vague, grow raw and real in daylight. If anyone had come to us then with an
  ounce of common-sense persuasiveness I believe he could have talked even Grim
  into abandoning the plan within five minutes.</p>

  <p>But no one came who had any interest in changing our course, and none of
  us cared to hoist the white feather, so we sat there in as deep silence as
  the Arab guides permitted&mdash;which is to say in the midst of a crows'
  chorus&mdash;until the two who had carried Poulakis came back to tell us that
  a car was waiting for us near the Mena House Hotel. Even so, we didn't pay
  them until they had accompanied us all the way to the Mena House, and seen us
  into the car. They formed a fine unconscious body-guard, and we were sorry to
  leave them.</p>

  <p>The car was a truly magnificent affair, with leopard-skin robes and a
  driver who outshone any darky ever seen in the States. All traffic
  rules&mdash;if there were any&mdash;went by the board, and we drove to meet
  destiny at fifty miles an hour, bellowing through a horn like Gabriel's
  trumpet to the early farmer-folk to clear the ways. They cleared it, too,
  right into the ditch quite frequently, being used to the ways of the Egyptian
  pasha.</p>

  <p>I really don't know what we expected&mdash;what we supposed our
  destination was. I had a vague notion that we were on the way to Madame
  Poulakis's palace where conspiracy would be already working full blast. But
  that was leaving Egypt out of the reckoning. Few criminals are habitually
  early risers.</p>

  <p>We were taken straight to Shepheard's Hotel, where the only suggestion of
  intrigue was two scented envelopes handed to Grim by a sleepy Sudanese
  porter, who professed not to know who had brought them. The first was from
  Madame Poulakis, addressed to us all:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">You dears, how happy I am! I have sat up waiting for the
  news and fearing the worst! How I congratulate you! And myself! And all of
  us! Mon dieu, how you must be tired and sleepy, for I can hardly keep my own
  eyes open, yet you must have spent ten nights in one. So rest yourselves.
  This evening must find you well recovered. It is with delight that I accept
  your kind invitation to dine with you. As I shall take such advantage of your
  kindness as to bring three friends, please perfect your generosity by
  inviting Meldrum Strange to your dinner to meet me! After the dinner, if
  agreeable, we will all attend a little rendezvous chez moi.<br>
  Yours most cordially, Z.</p><br>

  <p>The second was from Narayan Singh, written in a much more sober hand than
  his former communications.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">To Major J.S. Grim, the respectful salaam of Sepoy Narayan
  Singh.<br>
  Jimgrim, sahib,<br>
  Fortune that forever favors your honor's interest sent me to this house
  suitably drunk, in which condition brain is too torpid to expel what enters
  ears, and eyes are too slumberous to avoid seeing things not meant to see.
  Subject your approval, shall continue to debauch, disposing of drink and
  drugs unofficially but accumulating official intoxication. Key to situation
  is Memsahib, who might prove indiscreet if subjected to sympathy. Details of
  little affair in Gizeh already known to many people. There are several spies
  in the hotel, but small danger until this evening, when the memsahib will
  attend dinner with other memsahibs appointed to prevent indiscretion. Much
  murder, including memsahib and all of us, will definitely take place after
  midnight unless plans regarding Strange sahib work without hitch.<br>
  In haste, Your honor's obedient servant, Narayan Singh.</p><br>

  <p>"Damn it! Is that Sikh for us, or against us?" Strange demanded, passing
  the letter back to Grim.</p>

  <p>Grim answered. "He has the eastern view-points," Grim answered. "He'll not
  respect western squeamishness. But he's one of us, first, last, and all the
  time!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9">CHAPTER IX<br>
  "I understand you have changed sides!"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It wasn't any use sitting there wondering what Narayan Singh
  might mean by "indiscreet if subjected to sympathy." We disgusted the hotel
  folk by ordering light breakfast, and went to bed as soon as we had swallowed
  it, doubling up for extra safety. Then we disgusted the hotel folk a second
  time by insisting on lunch at three o'clock. So far we might have been
  prepaid tourists, seeing sights in the sweat of our brows.</p>

  <p>But three-thirty brought an ambassador on the wings of impudence, if
  that's the right name for an imported, sporty-model car painted maroon and
  yellow, with a brace of pug-nosed Egyptian pages in the rumble up behind. And
  Lord, how that ambassador did like himself!</p>

  <p>We were sitting on the veranda in cane armchairs when he approached,
  doffing his imported straw hat daintily and pulling off his yellow, imported
  gloves. He wiped his forehead with an imported silk handkerchief that smelt
  of imported opopanax, lifted the knees of his London trousers to display his
  Paris socks, and sat down uninvited in the chair in front of us. Them he
  smiled to show his nice white imported American teeth, and waited for us to
  say something. We said nothing, all four of us simultaneously and with one
  mind.</p>

  <p>He consulted his gold wrist-watch; but if he meant that for a hint we
  didn't take it. As he polished his finger-nails with the inside of a glove he
  kept looking at Strange as if expecting him to speak first.</p>

  <p>I never saw a man I liked less. I think he had rouge on his cheeks,
  although I won't swear to that; it may have been a high complexion resulting
  from a little admixture of Hamitic blood. There was a dark, suggestive iris
  on the finger-nails he polished so thoughtfully that entitled him to the
  benefit of the doubt regarding rouge.</p>

  <p>What made the effeminacy worse was an evident strength of physique. He had
  a swordsman's wrist and was wiry from head to heel, packing none of that fat
  under the ribs that makes most Cairenes over thirty years of age incapable of
  serious exercise.</p>

  <p>His face was sly and arrogant&mdash;the face of a rascal who understands
  human weakness and habitually trades on it&mdash;almost classical at the
  first glance, totally repellent the second. You could see he was confident of
  possessing influence, contemptuous of all who might lack it, but really brave
  or courageous never.</p>

  <p>No man possessing his combination of inquisitive nose, cruel mouth, and
  yellowish eyes that strip naked whatever they see, could sell me a quarter
  for twenty-five cents, let alone get information from me. But he was used to
  being treated with great respect, and our silence rattled him.</p>

  <p>"A little different to our last meeting in New York, isn't it, Mr.
  Strange?" he said at last, with a hint of a sneer in his unexpectedly musical
  voice. I guess he sang love-songs to a guitar in his less inhuman moments.
  "You remember me, of course?"</p>

  <p>"I remember kicking you out of my office," Strange answered.</p>

  <p>"No need to tell you, then, that I am Andrieff Alexis. I propose that we
  take the rough-handling to which you were subjected last night as tit for
  tat, and call the personal score even, Mr. Strange. Is that agreeable to
  you?"</p>

  <p>Strange growled something or other half under his breath and went on
  chewing one of his cigars, sitting back with his stomach out and both hands
  gripping the arms of the chair. It was surprising that with all that stomach
  for handicap he had been able to throw out such a man as this who called
  himself Alexis. Maybe it gave a true line on the latter's courage.</p>

  <p>"Good. Let us call that balanced, then. I understand you have changed
  sides."</p>

  <p>Strange made no answer. I began to suspect that Alexis was putting a bold
  front to a weak position, and the glint in Grim's quiet eyes confirmed my
  guess.</p>

  <p>"You see," he went on, "we don't allow personal quarrels among members.
  Before a new member can be admitted there is inquiry into such questions as
  whether any member has a grudge against him. Unless I were to give my
  personal assurance on that score you couldn't be approved. People who apply
  for admission but fail to be approved are put out of the way. I made up my
  mind to do the handsome thing and call on them to bury the hatchet."</p>

  <p>At that Strange showed his caliber. He seized the upper hand.</p>

  <p>"I guess you mean your mind was made up for you," he retorted. "You're not
  the kind of person who gets kicked and forgives it. Your organization made
  war on me because they want my help. They won't let such a little matter as
  your personal feelings stand in the way of my joining them. That's what
  brings you here, now isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"I assure you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No use your assuring me of anything! I challenge your authority to
  represent anyone except yourself!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, very well," Alexis answered. "If you prefer to keep on
  quarreling&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Quarreling?" said Strange. "Ten men like you couldn't quarrel with me! If
  you want to make your peace with me, you can do it by taking care not to
  offend me in future."</p>

  <p>Alexis showed his false teeth in a smile that was meant to suggest
  resources in reserve, but it hardly hid exasperation.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said after half a minute, "we've no use, of course, for
  sentiment. Nobody expects you to kiss me on both cheeks. I accept your
  statement that you have no personal quarrel with me. I have none with you. My
  dealings with you have been official. Your assault on me in New York was
  therefore as impersonal as that of one soldier on another on a battlefield. I
  am glad you appreciate that. But let me tell you something, by way of
  warning; a rule of our society is that members must submit their personal
  differences to a committee of three, whose decision is absolute. A new member
  who picked a quarrel with one of long standing would be sentenced to death. A
  case of that sort happened recently to my knowledge."</p>

  <p>"Is my understanding correct that I am to be passed on for membership
  tonight?" demanded Strange.</p>

  <p>"I believe perfectly correct."</p>

  <p>"Will you be present?"</p>

  <p>"Er&mdash;no. No, I imagine not."</p>

  <p>"Umph! You have to report to someone, though, that you've made your peace
  with me?"</p>

  <p>"I shall do that presently."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Will you carry a message from me?"</p>

  <p>"I am willing to repeat it."</p>

  <p>"Tell 'em this, then. If there's to be peace it's between your
  organization and mine. These men you see with me are members of my
  organization. They come in with me or I stay out. There's nothing to argue
  about."</p>

  <p>"But you're in no position to dictate on what terms you will come in,"
  Alexis answered rather hotly. "We're self-perpetuating; we select our
  membership."</p>

  <p>"That's my message," Strange retorted, "They come in with me, or I stay
  out."</p>

  <p>"I will convey your message."</p>

  <p>"I assure you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Alexis sat fanning himself with an ivory-handled, horse-tail fly-switch. I
  think he expected us to offer him a drink. At the end of three or four
  minutes' silence he got up, doffed his wonderful straw hat very gracefully,
  and drove away in the maroon-and-yellow car with the exhaust wide open to
  call attention to his finery.</p>

  <p>Grim nodded. "Excellent! He'll report every word of that!"</p>

  <p>"We're being watched," said Jeremy. "Gamble. Quick!"</p>

  <p>We began to play "Two tip," Australian style, betting in pounds and fives
  and tens on every toss of the coin. Lord knows how many hundred pounds of
  Strange's money changed hands in twenty minutes, for it's amazing how the
  luck runs when you mean to return your winnings afterward. We were hard at
  it, when another individual crossed from the far end of the veranda and took
  the chair vacated by Alexis. Grim glanced once at him and kicked my shin. I
  nudged Strange and Jeremy. We stopped the game and ordered whisky-and-soda,
  which gave the new arrival an opportunity to show his hand. He looked like an
  Englishman who had been drilled&mdash;perhaps a retired Army officer.</p>

  <p>"I wish you men would invite me to drink with you," he said suddenly.
  "I've just come here from Kantara on purpose to talk with you and I don't
  want to attract attention."</p>

  <p>We obliged him and he studied all the other people on the veranda rather
  dramatically before broaching his subject.</p>

  <p>"My name is supposed to be McAlister," he began then, sipping slowly at
  his drink. "You, I believe, are Mr. Meldrum Strange and Mr. Ramsden,
  Americans; Major Grim, also an American but of the British Army; and Mr.
  Jeremy Ross, Australian. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>There was a slight slip, but Grim didn't correct him; technically,
  perhaps, he still was of the British Army, and anyhow, it isn't wise to
  squander information at the first excuse.</p>

  <p>"The Administration is quite familiar with most details of your present
  predicament," the man who called himself McAlister went on. "All that took
  place at the Pyramid last night is known. The Arabs reported it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm glad to hear that," said Grim. "What did they say took place
  inside?"</p>

  <p>"They reported everything&mdash;told all about the fighting, and how you
  carried a man named Poulakis down to the King's Chamber. Everything's
  known."</p>

  <p>Grim nodded&mdash;more to us than to him, and there was a smile behind his
  eyes. Strange started chewing a new cigar. The Arabs weren't there when the
  fighting took place; they couldn't possibly have seen us carry off Poulakis,
  and that was all about it.</p>

  <p>"It's understood, of course," he continued, "that your sole purpose is to
  expose this gang. I've been brought special to Cairo to get in touch with you
  and act as liaison officer between you and the Administration. So if you'll
  take me into confidence, we'll set a trap for this gang and catch the
  principals."</p>

  <p>Grim shook his head. " 'Fraid not," he answered. "After what took place
  last night, we'd be afraid. It seems perfectly clear to us that the
  Administration police are honeycombed with crookedness, and we've decided to
  let things take their course."</p>

  <p>"Well, at least you'll give evidence?" asked McAlister with an air of
  being scandalized.</p>

  <p>"I guess not," Grim answered. "We'd only get murdered. We prefer to
  live."</p>

  <p>McAlister said no more, but swallowed the remainder of his drink and
  walked away.</p>

  <p>"Page one, chapter one of our initiation," Grim remarked when he was out
  of earshot.</p>

  <p>"Clumsy stuff!" Strange added.</p>

  <p>"The funny part is," said Grim, "that I know that fellow. I've a long
  memory for names and faces. His real name is Smith. He was cashiered out of
  the Army for misappropriating money, and I suppose the poor devil picks up a
  living however he can. He's no insider. He hasn't brains enough to be."</p>

  <p>The next man they sent to test us was more dangerous. He was an honest-to-
  goodness Government official, with the title of pasha and a suitably worried
  air&mdash;a neat, nice-looking little man, wearing a red tarboosh but
  otherwise dressed in European style; and in order to establish his identity
  beyond all question, he had one of the hotel under-managers come and
  introduce him to us.</p>

  <p>"Ibraim Noorian Pasha!"</p>

  <p>He accepted a cigarette, lighted it nervously, and smoked for a minute or
  two with his knees close together and his ebony cane laid over them; damned
  diffident he was.</p>

  <p>"Hem! I am a department secretary. Police department. No, nothing to
  drink. Ahem! That affair last night. At the Pyramid. Disagreeable business.
  Going altogether too far. We shall get a bad name here in Egypt. Ahem! No
  sooner self-government in sight than things like this happen. Won't do! No.
  It must be stopped. Hellish individuals spoiling the future for everybody
  else. Spoiling everything.</p>

  <p>"What do you propose?" asked Grim.</p>

  <p>"Ahem! Delicate matter." His voice, too, was delicate. He had delicate
  brown eyes that kept you thinking of a mouse. "Quite frankly, I'm taking my
  life in my hands to talk to you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, nonsense!" answered Grim.</p>

  <p>"No, not nonsense! Unfortunately the police are totally corrupt. Can't
  depend on anyone. All the fault of the English. Things completely out of
  hand. A few of us might straighten matters out, if we had assistance. Ahem! I
  want you gentlemen to help me&mdash;confidentially. Quite confidentially. We
  have spies. Police department spies. They bring us information. Ahem! The
  rascals who attacked you last night hope to get you to go to America. Work
  for them there. Bold people. Agents everywhere. Quite too many for us, unless
  we get assistance. Police need people like you. Now&mdash;ahem! Why don't you
  pretend to agree with them? Then expose them to us? I'm quite frank with you.
  I'm hoping for reformation that would almost be revolution in the police
  department. A coup such as that would promote me to be head of the
  department. We would have a practically new police force in no time. I can
  guarantee your protection meanwhile. Ahem! Will you do it?"</p>

  <p>"No!" said Grim. "I don't believe in your police protection. How much were
  we protected last night?"</p>

  <p>At that Ibraim Noorian Pasha taxed us with supine immorality. "The white
  races are growing degenerate!" he announced with an air of pained conviction.
  But Grim uncovered the weakness of his position.</p>

  <p>"If you don't like our attitude why don't you arrest us as material
  witnesses?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Pffaah. The English would order you released immediately."</p>

  <p>And he got up and left us, walking away in a fine fit of assumed anger
  with his tarboosh set at an angle that made him look like a bantam
  rooster.</p>

  <p>"Here endeth the second lesson!" announced Jeremy.</p>

  <p>Nothing further transpired until we dressed for dinner and came down again
  to the veranda to await Madame Poulakis and her friends. There is no limit to
  Egyptian surprises. They came half an hour ahead of the appointed time in two
  closed carriages that wouldn't have looked badly at a coronation. Up on the
  platform behind the front carriage stood no other than Narayan Singh, sober
  as a judge, gorgeous in new turban, and silk from shoulder to heel, with a
  scimitar, if you please, tucked into the sash at his waist. It was he who got
  down to open the carriage door and escort Madame Poulakis up the hotel
  steps.</p>

  <p>We had ordered a special dinner. There was no use going to the dining-room
  at once, for it wouldn't be ready. The three women whom Madame Poulakis had
  brought were married, if rings on their hands meant anything, and well used
  to being waited on hand and foot with all the luxuries. "Cocktails in a
  corner! Who'll play?" asked Jeremy, striking an attitude&mdash;and they would
  all play, obviously.</p>

  <p>Jeremy led the way to a corner lounge, and Grim managed to get a word to
  me.</p>

  <p>"Cairene women are never punctual," he said. "There's purpose in this.
  Suppose you walk right on through and see whether Narayan Singh doesn't
  follow you."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Making no excuses, I shoved both fists into my jacket pockets and strolled
  through to the palm garden. There I sat down on a bench beyond the big
  fountain in the center, with both eyes lifting to make sure there were no
  spies in close attendance. It is in just such simple ways that fish escape
  from nets and plots crack open. Nobody paid any attention when Narayan Singh,
  dressed as a servant, followed me through the hall ostensibly toward the rear
  where he belonged. He came straight to where I was waiting, and sat down
  beside me.</p>

  <p>"Sahib," he said, "our Jimgrim has a dangerous friend in Meldrum Strange.
  It is all one to the gods whether a man is drunk or sober, and at times they
  need a drunken man. Yesterday in the very early morning I was drunk. But the
  whisky was good, and I only had a bottle of it. I rang for more, but the
  black badmash who answered told me impudently that the bar was shut; so,
  being wrathful and indignant at such limitations, I set the furniture outside
  on the veranda, leaving a naked room, and went out in search of some place
  where conviviality knows no limit and a man's thirst isn't held answerable to
  the clock.</p>

  <p>"But they run this city like an army canteen, sahib! I walked far, but
  found no liquor. And having found fault with an Egyptian policeman, who
  refused to direct me to an open drinking-place, and who blew his whistle
  lustily from underneath the garbage in a night-cart into which I thrust him
  to teach him manners, I set out to put great distance between this hotel and
  me, not wishing that you sahibs should be disturbed on my account.</p>

  <p>"So I crossed the Nile by a bridge, cursing the water for being
  unintoxicating stuff; and if curses have value, sahib, the Nile in its next
  life will be a sewer flowing in the dark under unclean city streets! Ever
  seeking whisky, I walked on and on, not drunk enough to be unreasonable, but
  with a certain ardor in my veins for conquest and the clash of forces. My
  intellect was alert and rational, for I recalled that I spoke to myself in
  English, French, and German as I walked along; but my heart had the mastery,
  and intellect could only serve the heart that night. First I desired more
  whisky; but after that I longed above all else to find a damsel in distress
  and to smite her enemies. At that hour the gods had use for a man exactly in
  that mood!</p>

  <p>"There was a fracas, sahib, a fracas in the dark, and it was music to me!
  I approached a house that resembled nothing else so much as one of those new
  palaces our fat, degenerate rajahs build&mdash;a pastry-cook's delirium, made
  up of all new fashions blended, with sufficient of the old to cause the lot
  to ferment like indecency within an old man's body. Phaugh! A house of money
  without brains! There was a great carriage outside this abortion of a house,
  and a woman within it screaming; so I came swiftly.</p>

  <p>"No fewer than nine men, sahib&mdash;for they seem to call such creatures
  by the name of men in Egypt&mdash;were endeavoring to drag this woman from
  the carriage. And another woman helped them, while only two men took the
  other side, and they timidly, using more voice than violence. All this I saw
  as I came upon them, thinking how I might best apply my strength and whatever
  skill I may have picked up in course of a few campaigns.</p>

  <p>"It was nothing to me what those Egyptians wanted with the woman, but a
  very great deal it meant to stand between them and their desire. I burst on
  them as a typhoon smites the trees. I hurled, flung, smote! I threw them
  under the horses! I trod men underfoot. To their eyes I must have seemed to
  be a dozen men! I was swift, crashing their heads together, attacking now
  this and then that one, aided a little at last by the coachman and footman,
  who took courage.</p>

  <p>"The other woman ran. I know not what became of her. She may have entered
  the house. A fool aimed a pistol at me dwelling on the trigger and I ducked.
  I seized him around the belly, he firing as I lifted him. I flung him under
  the horses, hoping they would tread him into red mud, and what with his
  carcass striking their forelegs, and the pistol-shot, the horses, which were
  mettled beasts, took fright and bolted, but not before the coachman had
  scrambled up and seized the reins.</p>

  <p>"The gods take charge of a man's intellect in moments such as that, sahib.
  I was minded neither to remain and defend myself against the men, nor to
  forego the acquaintance of that lady in the carriage, who might wish to
  acquire merit by thanking me for service rendered. So I seized the carriage
  and jumped in, she screaming. I doubt not that in the dark I was an
  apparition to terrify any woman, with my turban all awry amid one thing and
  another.</p>

  <p>" 'O Queen,' said I, 'I will defend you against your enemies. There is no
  need to fear me at all.'</p>

  <p>"And I sat on the front seat with my arms folded thus, that she might see
  I had no intention of affronting her. Even so in the dark I could see that
  she was young, and more beautiful than the moon and stars; and I thanked the
  thoughtful gods who had brought me there. I had just sufficient whisky in my
  belly to make me adventurous, without unsettling discretion. Clear,
  reasonable, discreet my mind was.</p>

  <p>" 'O lady, I have sworn an oath this night to serve in future none but
  queens,' said I, 'so if you are not yet a queen, lo! I will make you into
  one. Trust me!' said I.</p>

  <p>" 'If you have ten-thousand enemies, they shall die ten thousand deaths,
  one each, and that is all about it! Charge me with a service. Name but a
  deed, and I will do it!'</p>

  <p>"So she bade me stop the horses, which were galloping pell-mell, we
  swaying this and that way like a big gun going into action, first this wheel
  and then that striking against a curb-stone as the coachman wrenched at the
  reins.</p>

  <p>" 'If you could save us from an accident,' she said, 'by doing something
  that would stop the horses, that would be a kindness beyond words.'</p>

  <p>"Well, sahib, that seemed a very little thing to me in the state of mind
  that I was in. I climbed out on to the driver's seat. I thrust aside the
  coachman, whose wits fear had taken from him, I leaped on the back of the
  near horse. I come of a race of horsemen, sahib. No pair of horses lives that
  can say 'yea' to my 'nay' for more than a minute or two. Presently they
  stopped, and I climbed back into the carriage, sitting as before with folded
  arms.</p>

  <p>"By that time the lady had regained her self-command, and eyed me
  curiously rather than with fear. She began to question me, asking my name and
  who I might be; and I, not squandering truth as some men do when strong drink
  is in them, but inspired by the gods to tell the first lie that crossed my
  mind, said I was a deserter from the British Army.</p>

  <p>"Whereat, sahib, she clapped her hands delightedly and offered me a place
  to hide, saying I should be her private bodyguard and strong protector. And
  I, caring nothing what the future should bring forth, would only that the
  present should continue interesting, fell in with her suggestion, protesting
  with great oaths that I would tear up Egypt by the roots at a word from
  her.</p>

  <p>"And after a while we came to the palace in which you found me. There at
  the gate the carriage stopped, and the footman, who had ridden on the
  platform behind the carriage, opened the door and offered me insolence. I was
  minded to pull his head out by the roots, but she checked me in time to save
  his life. She said it would not look well for me to ride into the house
  inside the carriage with her so I sprang on the footboard. Thus we drove in,
  the footman walking, hugging at his throat where I had twisted it, and the
  great gate clanged behind us.</p>

  <p>"So far, good. My walk had produced no whisky, but some amusement
  nevertheless. I was in a mood for great adventures, sahib. Said I: 'O queen,
  lead me to your apartment, that I may sleep in front of the door and guard
  you. Impudent devils who would try to drag you from your carriage would stop
  at nothing less than such an obstacle as me! These servants of yours are
  muzzled dogs that can't bite,' I said; and she laughed with no little
  reassurance.</p>

  <p>"So we entered that palace in which you found me, and she led me to a
  great room like a chamber in paradise, overlooking the Nile, which
  nevertheless is no heavenly river. And she sent for Narendra Nath, an old
  fool of a Hindu soothsayer. His perpetual study is of all the world's
  religions. His wisdom is a patchwork of craziness. He is teller of fortunes.
  He had foretold to her that she would be attacked, as any child might have
  done, knowing already what Narendra Nath knew; for she tells him
  everything.</p>

  <p>"Narendra Nath said that the gods had sent me, which is doubtless true.
  She bade me go with him and learn what is required of me, he saying to her in
  an undertone that a little drunkenness in the circumstances was no bad thing.
  My ears are sharp, sahibs. So I feigned greater drunkenness, behaving as one
  from whose brain the fumes of liquor are fading, which is a stage in which
  few men have their wits about them; and he took me to the room upstairs in
  which you found me, where certain bigger fools than he set up a wailing on
  wind instruments such as is never heard outside of India, and only there in
  the performance of certain secret rites during which they hypnotize the
  neophyte. None can hypnotize any man, sahib, who is not afraid to do his own
  thinking&mdash;which, I take it, is why the British govern India.</p>

  <p>"Narendra Nath plied me with drugs, which he said would relieve my
  headache. But Jeremy sahib has been teaching me legerdemain, and I was able
  to palm the pills and make away with them. Nevertheless, observe, sahib; see
  how I can make my eyes grow large, as if drugs had dazed them. That is a
  muscular trick; I have used it to get into hospital at the end of arduous
  service, when I needed a rest and a change of diet.</p>

  <p>"When he believed me under the influence of drugs and music, he sent for
  her; and they asked me questions about you sahibs. I left nothing unsaid in
  praise of you. I recalled a multitude of things that never happened. I
  magnified real deeds until they sounded like the miracles of gods. Then they
  asked me about Meldrum Strange; but knowing nothing about him, I said less
  than nothing, being satisfied to look perplexed.</p>

  <p>" Too many men prefer to look wise, sahib, when they know nothing, which
  causes the sensitive gates of uncertainty to close on confidence; whereas a
  look of perplexity tempts indiscretion.</p>

  <p>"So they told me about Meldrum Strange, believing me to be hypnotized and
  receptive to all manner of suggestions. She told me how her husband had been
  a member of a society so secret that it has no name. And then Narendra Nath
  took up the burden of the tale, and told how the lady Poulakis had continued
  to be a member of the society, because of their rule that none may escape
  from membership except through the door of death.</p>

  <p>" 'She is a bird in the net,' said he, 'too young to wish to die; too
  potentially useful for them to desire to kill her; yet doomed to death,
  unless she shall serve their present purpose.</p>

  <p>" 'And their suspicions of her,' said he, 'are well founded. She is weary
  of this wicked business. She is anxious to be free from them, yet can find no
  way out of the net. So little do they trust her,' said he, 'that, as you
  yourself have seen, they sought to make her prisoner in another woman's
  house, where the pressure of tenfold fear could be brought to bear on her.
  Therefore, let your duty and your highest pleasure be to guard her day and
  night. Be devoted to her service.'</p>

  <p>"To which I, speaking as a man who dreams, made answer that I am liable to
  be arrested for desertion; for it seemed to me, sahib, that that might open a
  way of communication with Jimgrim. As in truth it did. Later on, when they
  had well considered matters, they bade me write a letter, as you know.</p>

  <p>"Then they had an argument as to whether they should tell me more, he
  taking the nay and she the yea of it, and she prevailing, as a woman will.
  'His inner mind,' said she, 'is opened. It will be an inner secret, to be
  well kept, and will add to the inner impulse that governs his waking brain.'
  That is the way people argue, sahib, who have a smattering of occult
  knowledge.</p>

  <p>"So she told me, Narendra Nath unwillingly consenting. Said she: 'I am
  required to marry Meldrum Strange, whom they seek to control for the purpose
  of great financial undertakings in America. Now I am not unwilling,' said
  she, 'to marry Meldrum Strange, having met him and not disliking him at all.
  He offers my one path of escape. But there is this great difficulty&mdash;he
  undoubtedly believes me to be a wicked woman, and he is the last man who
  would choose a wife from among a society of criminals. Yet unless he consents
  to marry me they will murder him. And unless I succeed in this matter they
  will murder me. So what can I do but protect myself, if that is possible, and
  hope for the best, and see what happens?'</p>

  <p>"I made no answer to all that, sahib, being supposed to be in a sort of
  trance, and aware also that folk who made use of such practices believe
  themselves able to arouse all the wisdom hidden in the recesses of a man's
  inner mind, so that, although he cannot answer, being in a trance, he will
  none the less apply great wisdom to his conduct in the matter when the trance
  is ended.</p>

  <p>"So then she retired to her apartment, and old Narendra Nath continued his
  schooling of me, suggesting to me that it were an act of wisdom to involve
  all you four sahibs in this matter, by persuading you to conceal my
  whereabouts, thus conniving at my desertion; by which means a certain hold
  over you might be obtained, with the aid of which a pressure could be brought
  to bear that might compel you to act on behalf of Madame Poulakis. But to
  tell the truth, sahib, the old man is at his wits' end, not knowing what to
  say or do, yet afraid to admit to them that his occultism and astrology and
  what not are of no avail.</p>

  <p>"After a while it seemed good to him to put me into a deeper trance, which
  suited my convenience exactly. Life in the Army, sahib, is a matter of
  discipline, which has its profit as well as loss&mdash;profit of self-control
  to balance loss of liberty. Certain things are done at certain times, and a
  man who has the soldier spirit to begin with soon learns to sleep lightly and
  to wake himself, whether at the right time or at the first unusual sound. A
  little liquor makes no difference&mdash;not such a little as I had had. So I
  fell asleep with perfect confidence that I would wake when necessary. And so
  I did. But I awoke with only one eye open, and closed that almost
  instantly.</p>

  <p>"There came into the room a heavy man of coarse build but with a voice
  like oil. He had puffy, white hands, with a large emerald ring on the right
  one; but I saw little else, for the first thing he did was to examine me.</p>

  <p>" 'He is in a trance,' said Narendra Nath.</p>

  <p>"But the man kicked me three times to make sure, putting me to the utmost
  exercise of self-control. I have prayed that I may break his neck for those
  three kicks he gave me. Never have I suffered sharper pain, even when wounded
  on the battlefield. Yet I lay still; and he believed I was in a trance.</p>

  <p>" 'Who and what is he?' he demanded.</p>

  <p>" 'Merely a madman,' said Narendra Nath. 'I have calmed him by the
  exercise of certain powers I possess.'</p>

  <p>" 'Mad he must be!' said the other fellow. 'Is he that devil who made
  ninepins out of nine of us early this morning in the street and drove away in
  the Poulakis's carriage? The same, eh? And you have him hypnotized? Well, he
  has qualities that we can use to good advantage. You'd better pour some sense
  into his ear while he's in that trance. He'll make good gallows-meat. And
  another matter, while I think of it; what has come over the servants in this
  house? I had to threaten them before they'd admit me!'</p>

  <p>"Narendra Nath swore he knew nothing about that; but the other threatened
  him with dire consequences if it ever should happen again. Said he:</p>

  <p>"'You're only allowed to live here as a spy on her. It's your business to
  see that her servants understand to whom to look for orders. She has been
  growing willful of late,' he said, 'and her servants follow suit.'</p>

  <p>"Narendra Nath was very humble in reply, and then the other in a voice
  more oily than ever went on to say really why he had come.</p>

  <p>" 'Cast her a new horoscope!' said he. 'Cast her a horoscope in which her
  second husband is an American millionaire. Make it clever. Let there be a
  dividing of the ways; if she takes the right hand way and becomes the
  American's wife, good; if she takes the other, and refuses, promise her a
  terrible death! Better hear voices, hadn't you? And one other thing; if
  Meldrum Strange should refuse he'll be too dangerous to leave at large. He'll
  have to be disposed of. We'll make use of this fool. Hypnotize him! Tune him
  up, and keep him tuned!'</p>

  <p>"Then he went away, I seeing nothing but his back, which was not
  remarkable, except that his neck was thicker than ordinary, with a roll of
  fat protruding above the collar. And I slept on and off like a fox until
  evening."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">CHAPTER X<br>
  "And, no boaster though I be&mdash;"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was past the dinner hour and Narayan Singh caught me
  looking at my watch.</p>

  <p>"They will think I have gone to the servants' quarters, sahib. Madame
  Poulakis knows my real purpose. It is important to hear the end of this."</p>

  <p>"Jimgrim will invent an excuse for me," I said. "Go on."</p>

  <p>"Aye, trust him, sahib. Well, as I lay between sleeping and waking, I
  thought; for there was nothing else to do. And when the gods have use for a
  man they give him wise thoughts. So when Madame Poulakis came again and
  brought note-paper, and I wrote you the note that brought you to the house, I
  wrote a second note and hid it. That second note was the one that I slipped
  into your shoe. And at the same time I pretended to recover entirely from the
  trance and made no small fuss about being a deserter, who could be arrested
  and put in prison; so that they were all the more eager to get you here, and
  sent a carriage with the note.</p>

  <p>"Then Narendra Nath gave me more drugs, and tried to put me to sleep
  again, she maintaining that you sahibs would insist on taking me away if I
  should be too sane in appearance. Moreover, I was of the same mind, and I did
  not wish to be taken away, having taken great pity on this woman, who
  flutters like a bird in the net. The gods had also put into my head a rather
  high opinion of Narendra Nath. The old man is a charlatan and practises much
  nonsense, but nevertheless he believes the half of what he says and persuades
  himself of the other half. Thought I: he loves her, and the poor old fool
  would help her out of the net if he could contrive it.</p>

  <p>"And while I made believe to fall asleep, she cooked up with Narendra Nath
  a story to tell you sahibs that should account for my presence without
  disclosing secrets; for she and he are in terror of disclosing a hint of the
  secret society's doings. It was Narendra Nath's idea to have that music
  playing while you were in the house. He said it would help to bewilder your
  minds and make you amenable to the right suggestion. Men whose minds are
  superstitious are readily trapped in just such ways, and he did not know you
  are not superstitious.</p>

  <p>"Well, sahib; after you had come and gone again, I spoke to old Narendra
  Nath as man to man. Said I, 'My father, you seem to me like one who struggles
  in a whirlpool, seeking to save another but unable to stem the current, which
  carries you round and round.' And he stared at me, making no answer.</p>

  <p>" 'Furthermore,' said I, 'it must be plain to you that your sorcery
  doesn't always work, for here am I, who have deceived you easily, even while
  drunk. I have heard and I have seen all that took place in this room,' said
  I, 'and I know that you are an honest old man, in so far as you understand
  honesty, although not nearly as wise as you wish to believe. Whereas,' I told
  him, 'I not only am an honest man but a wise one also, the proof of which is
  that I became drunk when the gods wished!'</p>

  <p>" 'You are not only an impudent trickster,' he answered me, 'but a
  conceited Sikh heretic as well!'</p>

  <p>" 'Nevertheless,' said I, 'I crave to acquire merit by defending the
  distressed, which is the essence of the Sikh doctrine.'</p>

  <p>"Said he, 'If I raise my voice there will come men, who are less merciful
  than any in your experience!'</p>

  <p>" 'I, too, can be merciless,' I said. 'I gave nine of them a taste of my
  quality already, and no boaster though I be, I tell you this house will never
  hold enough Levantines to keep me prisoner should the gods once cause me to
  dislike the place. I am the father of typhoons,' said I, 'and I know four
  sahibs, all true friends of mine, who compared to me in cunning and strength
  and fury are as mammoths to a mouse!'</p>

  <p>"Well, sahib; the old man stared at me, and began to think like a man
  instead of like an abstraction.</p>

  <p>" 'There are five miscreants,' said he, 'who direct this present
  wickedness. They call them the executive committee. They have no books, nor
  any written rules or records, and it might be that if something were to
  happen to those five this whole accursed society might fall to pieces. This
  executive committee is, as it were, the neck between the body and the head of
  the thing. The head would die and the body would die if the neck were
  severed!'</p>

  <p>"That was man's talk, but old Narendra Nath cannot remain a man, sahib,
  for too long at a time, since charlatanry grows into a habit. He closed his
  eyes and murmured for a while then, describing a vision he had seem of
  strangers from the East and from the West, who came and smote a devil with
  five heads, thus setting free her who is nearest to his old heart. I knew
  that he made up the vision even while he spoke, for that is the way of
  self-deception. Was I not born in India? Hah! My mother's uncle was just such
  an one as this Narendra Nath, forever seeing visions after the event and
  claiming to be a prophet!</p>

  <p>"Then came Madame Poulakis again with news that you sahibs had been
  tracked to the Great Pyramid, where gunmen had doubtless already murdered
  you.</p>

  <p>" 'And that means that they will next come and murder me,' she said, 'for
  they will think me of no further use, as well as dangerous.'</p>

  <p>"But I reassured her on that point, saying that you sahibs are difficult
  men to murder, and moreover that first they must murder me before they can
  kill her. And instead of being shocked to discover that I had not been in a
  trance at all, she seemed overjoyed at it, declaring that she had found a man
  at last who has brains as well as courage!</p>

  <p>"Then there came more news. I was thrust hurriedly behind that gilded
  screen, and the music-makers were sent away. Unseen, I could hear all and see
  a little. There came three men, he of the thick neck not among them, and the
  first, who had a little black beard of a sort some missionaries wear,
  said:</p>

  <p>" 'Your future is yet before you, Madame Poulakis. Is it true that you are
  invited to dinner at Shepheard's Hotel? Then write a note of acceptance, with
  the request that Meldrum Strange be included in the party. Where is that
  drunken Indian?'</p>

  <p>"They said I was very sick, and had been put to bed. Narendra Nath said
  darkly:</p>

  <p>" 'He will recover. He is under the influence. It has seemed wise to me to
  attach him to Madame as personal servant. He will account for her, for I have
  found in him fine qualities of obedience and faithfulness, which can be
  trained into the proper channel.'</p>

  <p>"They were pleased at that, sahib; for they understood him to mean that I
  would slay her at a word from Narendra Nath. And Madame Poulakis, who has a
  woman's quickness, made believe to be afraid of me. Whereat those three men,
  thoroughly believing Narendra Nath to be their tool, insisted that I shall be
  Madame's bodyguard, she consenting only with reluctance. Then said the man
  with the missionary's face:</p>

  <p>" 'This man Strange has surrendered to us. We shall put him and his
  friends to various tests this afternoon, and if they do not walk into the
  traps, so that we believe their surrender to be genuine, then tonight there
  will be initiation.</p>

  <p>" 'Thereafter you must marry him, Zelmira. Among the guarantees that we
  shall insist on will be the settlement of enormous sums on you. So we have
  brought these papers for you to sign now. They are cleverly drawn. They
  consist of records of various supposititious transactions of a financial
  nature extending over a period of years, resulting in a loss to you of more
  than a million pounds.</p>

  <p>"You will sign these papers now, admitting liability; but you will say
  nothing about them to Strange. We shall require him to accept responsibility
  for your debts when he makes the marriage settlement; and when the proper
  time comes we shall collect, either from him, or from you, or from both of
  you. In the event of his death these papers would be extremely valuable.</p>

  <p>" 'So make yourself attractive,' he went on, 'and after the dinner at the
  hotel bring him and his friends to the house you know of, where the Five will
  have a final session with him. If he agrees then to our terms, well and
  good&mdash;you will be married at the United States consulate tomorrow
  morning. But if we find flaws in his attitude, that will be the last of him
  and his friends&mdash;and incidentally of anyone whose existence might make
  us nervous. You understand me, Zelmira?'</p>

  <p>"And at that, sahib, one of the three piped up in a thin voice and asked
  what means would be used for making away with Strange and four others, if
  that should prove necessary. He said it would be hardly as simple as killing
  unknown men. And the man with the face like a missionary laughed.</p>

  <p>" 'Did you never hear of Sarajevo?' he demanded. 'Who slew the Archduke of
  Austria? A fool of a fanatic. What about this Indian then? He came here from
  Syria with those friends of Meldrum Strange. What could be simpler than to
  have him kill them all? The safest tool that can be used is a religious
  fanatic, or an anarchist fanatic. Let Narendra Nath fill the Indian up with
  hashish and whisper the right suggestions to him. Then, even if someone else
  must do the actual killing, that won't matter; we can come out like honest
  men and accuse the Indian. What defense will he have? He will be an Indian
  who ran amok under the influence of hashish, and we will provide him with a
  lawyer at his trial, who will get him hanged as surely as we sit here!'</p>

  <p>"They all seemed to agree that that was an excellent proposal, sahib, and
  after they had made Madame Poulakis sign those papers they went away. She
  became hysterical for a while, but Narendra Nath comforted her, and I made
  great boastings such as women love to hear. This afternoon they fitted me up
  with this livery you see. Do I look like a popinjay? Hah! I smell action,
  sahib! There will be blood on this scimitar before morning, or I am a poorer
  prophet than Narendra Nath! Tell me, sahib: of what is this Meldrum Strange
  made&mdash;iron or beeswax?"</p>

  <p>"Iron," said I, "and not much rust."</p>

  <p>"Good! Then get my news to Jimgrim, and all is well. But how to get the
  news to him? Those women who accompanied madame are spies."</p>

  <p>I did not know how to answer him for wondering.</p>

  <p>"There is a spirit in man&mdash;" That, and nothing else, occurred to me.
  Whoever wrote the Book of Job answered with another riddle any question you
  can ask about humans and their ways. How a Sepoy&mdash;a number on the
  muster-roll of the British Army, and drunk at that&mdash;should have been
  selected by what he called the gods to uncover evil, that was a mystery that
  seemed to dwarf all others at the moment.</p>

  <p>We're taught to regard colored people as the agents of the enemy of man.
  Our missionaries go out to convert them, lest the heathen in their blindness
  overwhelm the world in another chaos any old night.</p>

  <p>They've educated us, these missionaries have, into believing things that
  aren't so; and we commit the indecency, in consequence, of being astonished
  when a man with colored skin acts "white."</p>

  <p>I ought to have known better. I was so surprised by the resourcefulness
  and courage of Narayan Singh, to say nothing of his wit, that I could hardly
  summon presence of mind enough to order him to the kitchen, while I went
  forward to devise some means of getting an account of his doings to Grim.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">CHAPTER XI<br>
  "It's nice to know a millionaire who isn't wiser than the rest of
  us!"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was no easy matter to discover a means of getting Grim to
  leave the dinner-table without exciting comment or arousing the suspicion of
  the three women who had accompanied Madame Poulakis.</p>

  <p>They were probably already exercised about my absence. In addition to
  that, there were probably spies keeping watch on us, who might, in fact,
  already have seen me talking with Narayan Singh, although I did not think
  so.</p>

  <p>Guests entered the dining-room at Shepheard's from the corridor at one
  end, so that anyone expecting me would watch in that direction. Our table was
  in mid-room, preserved from being conspicuous by a fountain and palms, which
  shut off the view of people coming in. I figured all that out, and looked for
  a side door opposite to where Jeremy was sitting. The door I selected was
  locked, but the gardener had left a hoe under some bushes near-by, and the
  lock came away without much noise or effort. I opened the door and stepped
  inside, finding myself behind a screen, as I expected. Watching from between
  the end of the screen and a palm, I could see our table, and particularly
  Jeremy, who faced me&mdash;was near enough, too, to hear almost every word
  that was said.</p>

  <p>Being no respecter of sedateness or convention, Jeremy was doing tricks
  with table-knives, producing day-old chicks out of napkins, and all that sort
  of foolishness. One of the guests at a near table had a huge dog lying beside
  him, and Jeremy used his ventriloquial gifts to make the beast talk, getting
  off comments on Egyptian society from what he called a "dog's-eye point of
  view." The attention of half the people in the room and of everybody at our
  table was fixed on him. But when Jeremy is doing tricks his own bright eyes
  are wandering everywhere, and it wasn't many minutes before he caught sight
  of me.</p>

  <p>And he's quick, is friend Jeremy. He didn't check or falter in the patter
  he was reeling off&mdash;made no signal to me&mdash;glanced away, in
  fact&mdash;and finished the trick he was doing to an outburst of laughter and
  applause. It was his favorite old trick of pulling a live day-old chick in
  halves and making two of it, after producing chick number one in the first
  instance from a hard-boiled egg or a billiard ball.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's nothing," he said airily. "I know a much better one. But
  you'll believe I've had help if I let Grim sit at the table. I'll prove he
  isn't my accomplice. Grim, old top, suppose you go and hide behind that
  screen, where you can't see me and I can't see you. Don't come back till I
  call. It's going to take me several minutes to accomplish this. Now, watch my
  hands, everybody."</p>

  <p>Grim got up with an air of thinking the whole business childish, and
  strolled over to the screen; but the instant he stepped behind it he was like
  a spring, coiled ready to go off.</p>

  <p>"Quick! Spill it! What's the news?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Well, I tried to condense into a fifty-word telegram all that Narayan
  Singh had told me. Try it for yourself, and judge what luck I had! Jeremy
  saved the day by purposely blundering his trick and beginning all over again,
  calling out apologies to Grim for keeping him waiting.</p>

  <p>"Now think!" I said when I had finished "and for the love of Mike tell me
  what to do; for I'll be blowed if I can figure it out."</p>

  <p>I don't believe that men like Grim do think, as a matter of fact, on such
  occasions. It's a species of instinct or intuition, or both combined. Long
  experience and a habit of meeting emergencies combine to produce a state of
  mind that figures instantly, like one of those adding machines.</p>

  <p>Grim glanced at the door I had come through, looked me full and fairly in
  the eye, and gave his
  orders&mdash;terse&mdash;quick&mdash;unmistakable&mdash;as if the automatic
  wheels inside his mind had cut them out of steel that instant.</p>

  <p>"Let your eye follow a line diagonally across our table from Meldrum
  Strange to Jeremy. Carry straight on for twenty feet. Small round table.
  There sits Kennedy. Gray-haired man&mdash;evening dress&mdash;Intelligence
  Department&mdash;all alone. Go out here; come in the front way; make some
  excuse; sit down at his table. Tell him everything."</p>

  <p>Promptly Grim returned to the dinner-table, resuming his bored expression,
  and I went out into the garden. All the way around the building I racked what
  brains I have for an excuse to approach this man Kennedy without arousing the
  suspicion of spies. I'm not a man who can walk into a public dining-room
  unobserved; I look bigger than ever in evening dress, and I was sweating with
  anxiety lest some stupidity of mine should upset Grim's calculations.</p>

  <p>But I was reckoning without the other fellow, which I take it is the cause
  of ninety-nine per cent. of this world's difficulties. Kennedy got up and
  came to meet me the minute I entered the room&mdash;a lean-flanked man of
  fifty-five or sixty, with a sort of literary look due to his iron-gray hair
  and quiet manners. He had extraordinary bright eyes with heavy gray eyebrows,
  and a deep cleft in his chin.</p>

  <p>But his most remarkable asset was a penetrating voice that he seemed to
  have in absolute control; when he first spoke, every word he said carried all
  over the room, but presently, when he reached his table and sat down,
  although to all appearance he was talking normally, and certainly didn't
  whisper, I don't believe the nearest waiter could have heard a word he
  said.</p>

  <p>"You're Mr. Ramsden, aren't you? You can do me a favor, if you'll be kind
  enough. They tell me you've hunted elephants in the Lado Enclave. My leave
  starts tomorrow, and I'm going there. Won't you sit at my table for half an
  hour and give me some pointers?"</p>

  <p>I told him that my friends would have to be asked to excuse me first; so
  he took my arm, and made his own excuses to the party, begging for what he
  was pleased to call the "use" of me for half an hour. None of the women liked
  it, but they couldn't very well refuse, and Jeremy had their attention again
  almost before we had turned away.</p>

  <p>The moment Kennedy and I sat down together I began on him.</p>

  <p>"Grim has just told me to take you entirely into confidence," I said. "I
  don't know why. If you're off elephant hunting a thousand miles from
  here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not," he answered. "However, there's no hurry; wait until I've
  ordered you some wine and sent for your dinner to this table. I've been
  watching that little side-play behind the screen."</p>

  <p>"I understand there are others watching," I warned him.</p>

  <p>"No, I think not. There were five, just before dinner began; one waiter, a
  headwaiter, an ex-Englishman in evening dress, a Cairene cotton-jobber, and
  an Italian. They're in the lock-up. It's now eight-thirty. By nine o'clock
  your party&mdash;the men, I mean, yourself included, would also have been
  under arrest for your own protection unless one of you had made this move.
  Ever since Meldrum Strange called on the High Commissioner we've been
  considering some such step. We have Poulakis junior under lock and key, and
  fortunately we bagged him without any of his gang knowing anything about it.
  Caught him in the house of a woman whom he visits now and then, and locked
  them up together. She's an agent of ours. He talked."</p>

  <p>So when the waiter had brought my dinner I talked too, telling Kennedy
  everything I knew about the whole affair, he laughing quietly most of the
  time, behaving, in fact, as if I were recounting reminiscences.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," he said when I had finished, "do you know of any other nation
  than America that could produce a man like Meldrum Strange? The man is right,
  but not within his rights. What would you think of me, for instance, if I
  went to America and did there what he proposes to do here? However, it's too
  late to help that now. We've got to go forward. I'll say this for him; he has
  forced our hand, and personally I'm in his debt; I've been trying for months
  to bring this gang to book, but there was obstruction at headquarters.
  Tonight we're going to let the law go hang, act ultra vires, and feed these
  devils some of their own medicine. I'm likely to lose my job over it, but
  that doesn't matter, I'm about ready to retire. Out of a hundred and eighteen
  murders, we know of ninety in recent months that have been committed at the
  instigation of this gang or by its members. Can't prove a thing. If we bring
  them to trial there's no evidence. We shan't get the real ring-leaders
  tonight, but we'll get the five who call themselves executive committee, and
  let's hope they're ugly!</p>

  <p>"No search-warrants. Didn't dare apply for them. Information would have
  leaked out. We've got a special, hand-picked force made up entirely of
  British officers, who've no connection with the police. They're supposed to
  be on their way to a party; and if they should suddenly become a rescue
  party, that would possibly not involve the Administration in a breach of its
  own laws. Individually the officers may find themselves in rather hot water,
  but they're willing to run that risk for the sake of rendering a public
  service."</p>

  <p>"Where are the officers now?" I asked him.</p>

  <p>"In this room."</p>

  <p>I looked about me. There were twenty or thirty officers in uniform dining
  at different tables&mdash;no unusual number. You would never have suspected
  them of being there with a common purpose. There were not more than two
  dining together, and they were of various ranks, from major downward.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," said I, "have you had any communication with Grim about this
  business?"</p>

  <p>He chuckled. "No. Grim's an old crony of mine. We all know Grim in the
  Intelligence. When he sent in his resignation we wondered. When we saw him
  linking up with Meldrum Strange we knew. Grim's an old
  war-horse&mdash;answers to the trumpet. Can't help himself&mdash;goes for the
  heart of trouble automatically like a needle to a magnet. Grim saw me on the
  job once yesterday and twice today&mdash;spotted me here as soon as he
  entered the room&mdash;saw that head-waiter taken in charge by one of my
  men&mdash;and possibly drew his own conclusions. However, we've discussed
  elephants long enough. Suppose you join your friends. Just go ahead with the
  evening's performance. Protect that Poulakis woman if you can; she's in
  danger. They'll suspect her of having betrayed them. Don't be surprised by
  anything that happens!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>So I joined our party, and was aware of being suspected by the women. None
  of the three was in the Poulakis class. They had neither her charm nor her
  well-bred self-control; they laughed too noisily, ate too greedily, and laid
  a lot too much emphasis on their own importance, besides making jokes about
  Strange and Zelmira Poulakis that would have been in rotten bad taste in any
  circumstances. It was difficult not to laugh at Strange, for he was getting
  red under the collar and almost ready to explode.</p>

  <p>Nobody was drinking much. We laughed through dessert with Jeremy until the
  dark-eyed woman sitting on my left began hinting that it was time to go.
  Then, and not until then, Zelmira Poulakis began to betray signs of
  nervousness, mastering herself with difficulty, looking suddenly much older,
  and apparently at a loss for words. However, she managed to smile, and to
  make the next move gracefully.</p>

  <p>"Now for the experience of your lives!" she said. "You will learn that
  this dinner has been a delightful overture to Grand Opera&mdash;Faust, let us
  say, for you are going to meet Mephistopheles!"</p>

  <p>Narayan Singh came forward to meet us in the hall, looking solemn and
  magnificent in all that finery, and escorted Zelmira Poulakis to the carriage
  as only an Indian can. He induced the impression that she was a semi-deity,
  in whose footsteps flowers should spring up presently; whereas the rest of us
  were merely to be tolerated, on the ground that she had condescended to
  acknowledge us. I suspect that half the reason why aristocracy is dying out
  is that impresarios as skillful as Narayan Singh are scarce in these days; a
  woman or man on social stilts needs a clever rogue to go in front and provide
  the proper atmosphere. On the way out I tried to speak to Grim, but one of
  the three chaperones spotted it and prevented by coming between us. It was
  her suggestion that he should ride in the front carriage with the women, and
  Grim couldn't well refuse.</p>

  <p>Looking back as we drove away I saw automobiles assembling in the dark in
  front of the hotel steps, and not long afterward we began to be pursued at a
  distance by the purring of six or eight cars. One passed us, and stopped to
  let us pass again under pretext of a stalled engine; but the others kept well
  to the rear, trusting to the first to keep us in view.</p>

  <p>We drove over the Nile and past the Poulakis mansion, down two or three
  streets to another house bigger than hers, standing gloomy and aloof with its
  sides all wan in moonlight. The shadow of one tree fell in the shape of a
  human skull across the front of it, and the urns on the pillars of the great
  gate looked like those you see over a cemetery wall. It was a perfect house
  for the sort of performance we were in for.</p>

  <p>"Close enough to the Nile for dumping corpses without unnecessary
  scandal," as Jeremy sweetly expressed it. "Feel like a swim, you fellows? How
  about it, Strange? They tell me swimming with your throat cut's easy&mdash;no
  work to it&mdash;just drift down with the stream!</p>

  <p>"Have we all got guns?" he demanded, as we drove in through the echoing
  gate and it clanged shut. Strange had none. I offered him mine and he refused
  it testily, for his nerves were on edge.</p>

  <p>"No use for one," he answered. "Out of my line. I was a fool to bring you
  fellows on this errand. Save yourselves if there's any trouble,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sure you're a fool!" laughed Jeremy, "but we like you, Strange, old top.
  It's nice to know a millionaire who isn't wiser than the rest of us! Here we
  are! Now for act one!" But they kept our carriage waiting several minutes
  before the first moved on and let ours draw up opposite the front door.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">CHAPTER XII<br>
  "Crooks are just crooks."</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I wonder how many men there are who can go forward into the
  unknown without making mental pictures in advance of what's coming. I believe
  Grim can. I know I can't. It may be that ability to refrain from "imagining
  vain things" leaves you free to imagine truly and successfully. We who
  imagine in advance form judgments in advance and I expect that's why we're so
  frequently wrong.</p>

  <p>I fully expected to find Grim and all four women waiting for the rest of
  us, either outside the door of the house or else just inside it. I also
  expected to find Narayan Singh standing there, for he had ridden on the
  platform behind the women's carriage, and would naturally get down to open
  the carriage door for them. I couldn't have guessed wider of the mark. It was
  a one hundred per cent. miss.</p>

  <p>We stepped out into darkness. The other carriage was already disappearing
  into deeper gloom, and ours proceeded to follow it. There was a porch in such
  deep shadow that you could hardly see its outlines, but enough dim light came
  out through the partly opened front door to prove that nobody was standing
  outside. Somebody standing behind the door opened it wide, and we walked in
  one by one, Strange leading.</p>

  <p>The door clicked softly shut behind us, and it was almost too dark to see,
  for there was only one lamp in the hall, and that shrouded with black silk;
  but we could dimly discern three solemn individuals dressed in black from
  head to foot, who stood in line to receive us. They looked like
  undertakers.</p>

  <p>"Your weapons, please!" said the man in the center in sepulchral tones;
  and all three held their right hands out.</p>

  <p>"Do we get brass checks?" asked Jeremy. The middle man of the three didn't
  answer, but continued holding out his hand. Meldrum Strange said crustily
  that he had no weapons.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that we won't be admitted otherwise?" I demanded.</p>

  <p>There was still not a word said in reply, but the first and third men each
  took a threatening step toward Jeremy and me. They obviously meant to search
  us, and I can't say what I would have done about it, except that I never yet
  did surrender a weapon to anybody on demand, and old dogs find it difficult
  to learn new tricks.</p>

  <p>But Strange solved the problem for us, by going clear off his head. I
  guess the nervous strain was too much for a man of his temperament, used to
  having his own way in the world.</p>

  <p>"You swine!" he said; and clenching his right fist he swung with all his
  strength and weight for the chin of the man in the middle. It was the sort of
  blow that wins world's championships. Any man caught off-guard would have
  gone down under it. The fellow in black collapsed like a corpse.</p>

  <p>I'm entitled to no credit for what followed. Jeremy did the thinking. I
  simply followed suit, doing the only thing I could do. Jeremy closed with his
  man, and I believe hit him with the butt-end of his Colt. The fellow in front
  of me tried to stop my left fist with the peak of his jaw, and the men who
  can do that successfully bulk about twice his size.</p>

  <p>It was all over in half a second almost noiselessly, for they fell on
  thick carpet, making no remarks. There was a door on Jeremy's left and he
  opened it.</p>

  <p>"Quick!" he whispered. "Here's an empty room."</p>

  <p>You couldn't see a thing, but Jeremy picked up one man, hove him in there,
  and turned to help me with the second. I had already gathered up Strange's
  victim. If you've ever watched the U.S. Navy police throwing their captured
  drunks into a boat in some foreign port you'll realize that an unconscious
  man can be handled pretty roughly without being seriously hurt; it's only
  when they struggle that bones get broken.</p>

  <p>I tossed number two through the door on top of Jeremy's number
  one&mdash;or so I supposed&mdash;and together we picked up the third man. We
  swung him like a sack and let go. It was only then, as his feet disappeared
  through the opening, that we realized that all three had fallen, not on to a
  floor, nor down-stairs, but down a dark hole where a flight of stairs had
  probably once been.</p>

  <p>They made no noise and we didn't stop to investigate. We locked the door
  and Jeremy pocketed the key.</p>

  <p>If you allow two minutes from the time the front door clicked behind us
  until that other key was in Jeremy's pocket you'll be well on the right side.
  The next thing Jeremy did was to find the front-door latch, slide it back,
  and fix it in that position, so that any rescue party would simply have to
  turn the big brass knob outside and walk in unannounced. But what to do then
  was too much for even Jeremy to guess, so I said:</p>

  <p>"Grim's inside somewhere. We can't leave Grim and Narayan Singh."</p>

  <p>There was nothing in that to argue about; but you can suggest as many
  explanations of what followed as you like without being sure you have given
  the right one. A friend in the U.S. Secret Service, whom I have known for
  twenty years, laughed when I told him it couldn't be explained; he said:</p>

  <p>"Me boy, that's aisy. Crooks are just crooks. Ivery mother's son has a
  quirk in him that works wan way. If it weren't for that we'd niver catch the
  smart wans. They're all alike. They play safe. Be damned, they take more
  pains playin' safe than a boid takes buildin' a nest. But did you iver see a
  boid take an inventory wance the nest was built an' the eggs laid? They
  figure that when precaution's took, it's took. An' that's where we come in.
  We look for their precautions. It's as plain as the nose on y'r face that
  those crooks had set three men at the front door 'at they knew they could bet
  on. An' bet they did. An' bettin's chancy. Chance is scaircely iver on the
  side of the law, because the law don't dale in chances, but in the long run
  it's always agin the crook!"</p>

  <p>Maybe Clancy put his finger on it&mdash;I don't know. The gang upstairs
  had certainly left the guarding of the entrance hall exclusively to those
  three men. They were careless when they least could afford to be. We went
  forward.</p>

  <p>There was no furniture in the hall, except two carpets one on top of the
  other presumably to deaden footfall, and that one dim hanging lantern
  shrouded in black silk. The stairs turned around to the right in front of us,
  and we walked up as softly as we could, I leading this time and going
  slowly.</p>

  <p>After making two turns they gave on to a dark landing, also thickly
  carpeted, and we found ourselves faced by six shut doors, with a window on
  our left that admitted moonlight through its narrow top pane; the rest was
  curtained. There was nobody waiting to receive us, but we could hear voices.
  I cleared my throat loudly; and a wooden shutter moved on the panel of the
  door immediately in front of us, exposing a small round hole. Light streamed
  through the hole and was shut off instantly by the head of someone who
  scrutinized us for about a minute. Then the whole panel moved downward, and
  his face appeared in the opening, but you couldn't see much of it; the upper
  half was covered with a black mask; the lower part, that you could see,
  framed a mean, anemic smile.</p>

  <p>"Simon should have brought you upstairs," he complained suspiciously. "Why
  didn't he?"</p>

  <p>Jeremy lied with genius&mdash;for I suppose that is genius which gets
  believed.</p>

  <p>"There were three men downstairs," he said. "Two of 'em went and stood on
  the porch in the dark. Simon closed the front door and told us to come on
  up."</p>

  <p>"Oh. Well, Simon knows his business. Come in here."</p>

  <p>We entered a room about ten by eight that had doors on either hand opening
  into other rooms. We were in the middle of a suite of apartments. The heat in
  this small connecting room was stifling, for there was no window and the
  light came from a huge oil-lamp against which about a hundred moths were busy
  beating themselves to death.</p>

  <p>The man who admitted us had evening clothes on, but over them, in addition
  to the mask, a black cloak like a pew-opener's that reached his heels, and he
  seemed to be sweating more than was good for him.</p>

  <p>"Where's Grim?" demanded Jeremy.</p>

  <p>He didn't answer but, whether intentionally or not, permitted the front of
  his cloak to open and show a heavy revolver in a holster. Through the door on
  the left we could hear women's voices&mdash;men's through the door on the
  right; no words were distinguishable. There was no furniture in the room
  except a carpet, a camp-stool, and the lamp on a bracket on the wall. Our
  host sat down on the stool between the two side doors, and there seemed to be
  nothing for us to do but wait and look at him. But waiting isn't Jeremy's
  favorite amusement.</p>

  <p>"Damned uninteresting cage!" he said. "What's in the next one?"</p>

  <p>"Wait for your turn!" the man in the mask answered.</p>

  <p>"Turn?" said Jeremy. "We're done to a turn! So are you. Let some air in.
  If you don't, I will!"</p>

  <p>"Keep quiet!" said the man in the mask.</p>

  <p>"What d'you take us for?" asked Jeremy, purposely raising his voice, and
  striding forward to open one of the doors. But his purpose was already
  accomplished. The door on our left opened suddenly and Narayan Singh's face
  appeared; he smiled, said nothing whatever, and closed the door again at
  once. Strange looked alarmed, for when Narayan Singh is deliberately trying
  to look like a hasheesh-maddened fanatic a sight of him would freeze his own
  mother's marrow-bones. But there wasn't anything reassuring that I could
  safely say to Strange just then in front of that fellow with a mask.</p>

  <p>Jeremy was just about to irritate him further when somebody tapped out a
  signal on the right-hand door, and with a bad-tempered sneer at us the fellow
  got off his camp-stool and produced a key from under his cloak. He very
  nearly unmasked us in the process, for as he made that movement Jeremy and I
  both felt for our pistols. Luckily he was too intent on fitting the key into
  the door to notice it.</p>

  <p>We went in one by one, passing around a high black screen beyond the door,
  and found ourselves in a square room furnished with a long mahogany table in
  the midst, and about a dozen high-backed chairs. There was no other
  furniture, except for a bench against one wall on which three men were
  seated.</p>

  <p>Facing us at the table as we entered were five men, all in evening
  clothes. Those on the bench against the wall wore long black cloaks exactly
  like that of the fellow in the anteroom. Every one of the eight men in the
  room was masked to the tip of his nose; but the middle one of the five was
  recognizable from Narayan Singh's account, for he had rolls of fat protruding
  over his collar, and the end man on our right had a short beard "of the kind
  that missionaries wear."</p>

  <p>We heard the key turn in the lock behind us, which was hardly reassuring,
  but there were no weapons in evidence, and there was nothing on the table
  except blotting-paper, pens, ink-pots, and a lot of printed blanks that
  looked like checks and promissory notes.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Mr. Meldrum Strange! Good evening, gentlemen!" said the man
  with the fat neck. "Pray be seated."</p>

  <p>"Evening!" Strange answered gruffly.</p>

  <p>"Where's Grim?" demanded Jeremy.</p>

  <p>"Be seated&mdash;be seated, gentlemen!"</p>

  <p>"Where's Grim?"</p>

  <p>"You will learn that presently. Be seated."</p>

  <p>We sat down facing the five. There was a door in the middle of the wall
  behind their backs, and another door on our right, so that we were obviously
  open to attack from two sides and behind, to say nothing of the three
  attendants on the bench. There wasn't much to be gained in the circumstances
  by glancing about the room nervously, so I concentrated my attention on the
  fat-necked man, reasoning that if there were going to be any violence he
  would be the one to give the signal. Strange concentrated on him too.</p>

  <p>"See here," Strange began, with his right fist set characteristically on
  the table in front of him. "I made my conditions plain this afternoon.
  Negotiations are to be between my organization and yours. One of my men, who
  entered this house ahead of us, is missing. Where is he? He has got to sit
  here on this side of the table before negotiations can begin!"</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, Mr. Meldrum Strange," said the thick-necked man, with that
  sort of suave inflection that suggests sarcasm without exactly expressing it.
  "Do you consider yourself in a position to dictate to us?"</p>

  <p>"I do! If you think you can deal with me on any but my own conditions,
  you'll discover your mistake," Strange answered, pulling out a cigar case.
  "Produce my friend Grim, or there'll be no conference!"</p>

  <p>He proceeded to chew the cigar. One of the five pushed over a box of
  matches. Strange ignored it.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Strange," said the thick-necked man, "I may as well tell you
  first as well as last that your friend Grim has been in here and has been
  examined. The examination was unsatisfactory&mdash;to him, I mean. Your
  organization will have to get along without him."</p>

  <p>"Just exactly what the Hell d'you mean by that?" demanded Strange.</p>

  <p>The thick-necked rascal smiled.</p>

  <p>"We asked him two questions. The first was, whether he is willing, in the
  possible event of your rejecting our proposal, to cut your throat in our
  presence. The second was whether he is willing to commit suicide. He answered
  both questions in the negative. His answer to the first made it clear to us
  that he is not to be depended on; his answer to the second proves him to be a
  man who is blind to his own best interest. Suicide is easy; murder is
  unfortunately sometimes&mdash;well&mdash;you know how ill-mannered and rough
  the underworld can be!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">CHAPTER XIII<br>
  "Ho!"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"My dear Mr. Strange&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Meldrum Strange snapped his jaw shut and sat bolt upright. The cigar
  dropped to the floor; he had bitten off the end of it.</p>

  <p>"I'll have no dealings with you whatever until you produce Major Grim!" he
  said sharply.</p>

  <p>"My dear Mr. Strange," the thick-necked man repeated, "you have put
  yourself entirely in our power. Do let me impress that on your mind! You have
  no weapons. We have an assortment of them. Your party consists of three.
  There are three men sitting on that bench. If they should fail, there are
  plenty more in the next room, and we five are not exactly impotent or without
  experience. No noise that you might make would do you any good, for the
  houses to right and left are each more than a hundred yards away, and
  incidentally they are both empty. So, unless we come to terms&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You have my ultimatum!" answered Strange. "Produce Major Grim!"</p>

  <p>All five men smiled; and the masked men on the bench moved restlessly,
  perhaps to call attention to themselves. The man with the thick neck took up
  the argument again.</p>

  <p>"Of course, Mr. Strange, we appreciate that we are dealing with a
  gentleman of iron nerve and resolution. In fact, we pay you the highest
  compliment in our power when we invite you to apply for membership in our
  society. Permit me to elaborate that. Our rule is that applicants for
  membership must pass through a great number of degrees, entailing severe
  tests as each higher degree is reached. There is a system of constantly
  increasing guarantees. We require every member to be so involved in illegal
  transactions that his liberty and even his life rests on our discretion.
  Hitherto there have been hardly any exceptions to that rule; but we have
  decided to make you an exception. You see, Mr. Strange: it is our experience
  that only men of high character, whose habit is to keep their given word, and
  at the same time to be ruthless in their dealings, are fit to share the
  control of our society. We consider you that kind of man."</p>

  <p>Strange pulled out another cigar and started to chew it, but made no
  answer. The thick-necked man continued:</p>

  <p>"We have decided after due deliberation that all we shall require from
  you&mdash;without specifying for the moment the financial part; that we will
  come to later&mdash;is an apparent crime. To a man in your peculiar
  circumstances murder would be exceedingly distasteful and might even result
  in undermining your nerve. In our profession we find the study of psychology
  extremely useful. And after all, what courts consider evidence is the
  principal thing. So, if you and your two friends will carry the bodies of the
  two men whom you shot in the Pyramid passage, and throw them into the Nile in
  the presence of witnesses, whom we have ready, we will be satisfied."</p>

  <p>"You say we killed two men?" Strange demanded.</p>

  <p>"Well, not exactly. You killed one. The other was injured, and if we had
  taken him to hospital there might have been inconvenient inquiries. The
  corpses are downstairs. The way to the Nile lies straight down the garden
  belonging to this house."</p>

  <p>"Hell!" exclaimed Jeremy. "I hoped we were in for a real initiation, with
  red-hot pokers and a black goat! Soon as I'm a member there'll be changes
  made! I know stacks of ways of making an initiation hum. We'll have it
  creepy, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The whole executive committee waved aside the interruption.</p>

  <p>"Permit me to continue," said the chairman. "Mr. Strange, we may as well
  outline the whole of our requirements to begin with. You must agree and give
  the required guarantees, or share the fate of Major Grim. Now, among the
  guarantees we require that you shall marry Madame Zelmira Poulakis, and
  settle on her cash or negotiable securities to the amount of a million
  pounds. She is a charming widow, on whose account you will have no qualms
  when introducing her as your wife into United States society. At the same
  time she appreciates and understands our point of view and is sufficiently
  controlled by us to make her a suitable consort for you. She is waiting close
  at hand, with witnesses, to sign a marriage contract."</p>

  <p>"You lucky old stiff!" laughed Jeremy, nudging Strange in the ribs.
  Accidentally he nudged the spot that the bullet had touched in the Pyramid
  passage, and Strange swore explosively.</p>

  <p>"For the treasure chest of the Society," the chairman went on, "all that
  we require from you is half a million pounds. We propose to make further
  enormous sums with your aid in the United States. An agent of ours in the
  United States, who has access to the income tax returns, has informed us that
  your accumulated resources amount to nearly a thousand million dollars. We
  have no wish to impoverish you. Our plan is that you shall select certain
  stocks dealt in on the New York Stock Exchange and, after notifying us,
  accumulate them steadily. We shall buy the same stocks. What is called a bull
  market will ensue, and we will all unload on the public when you give the
  signal."</p>

  <p>Meldrum Strange began to smile at last, and I think the chairman mistook
  that for a symptom of complaisance.</p>

  <p>"You see," he said, "we are not requiring you to engage in a business that
  you don't thoroughly understand. This Society likes nothing so well as to see
  its individual members prosperous&mdash;although too much prosperity is not
  always good for the lower ranks and is seldom permitted for that reason. We
  like power. We enjoy the power that the secret use of money and influence
  provides. We keep the power in the right hands. We keep an absolute hold over
  all our members. Subject to that, you may say we have no use for an indigent
  or helpless member."</p>

  <p>"You've heard my condition," said Strange. "Produce Major Grim before I'll
  as much as consider your proposal."</p>

  <p>The chairman didn't answer, but changed his tone.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Strange, permit me to show you the reverse side of this exceedingly
  attractive medal. Let us suppose that you are unwise enough to reject this
  offer. What then? Well, in the first place, your two friends will be killed
  at once. You will see that happen, and for the sake of its effect on you the
  process will be painful and somewhat prolonged. After that, you will be given
  your choice between a swift, quite painless death or one even more
  atrociously disagreeable than theirs that you will have witnessed. For the
  privilege of dying painlessly, you will have to pay whatever sum we name,
  signing before witnesses such papers as we shall set before you; and, as it
  won't make much difference to a dead man how much money he has paid to escape
  torture, the sum demanded will be&mdash;er&mdash;well&mdash;immodest!</p>

  <p>"Let us clearly understand one another, Mr. Strange. This business will be
  settled in this house this night, one way or the other, and you have no
  alternative but to join our Society or die. Moreover, you can only become a
  member on the terms we stipulate."</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly psychology did form one of the principal ingredients in that
  executive committee's method. They had their moves worked out carefully. The
  chairman brought his speech to an end by rapping on the table with an ebony
  ruler, and the answer to that was as instant as if the actors in the drama
  had been drilled for weeks.</p>

  <p>We heard the voice of Narayan Singh raised in a babel of Punjabi, pitched
  high and quarrelsome, behind the door we had entered by. It was followed by a
  terrific pounding on the door; but as that only made the executive committee
  smile, none of us was much disturbed by it. Nevertheless, something was going
  to happen, that was obvious. Something staged in advance.</p>

  <p>The voice behind the door was that of a fanatic declaiming. The words
  seemed a jumble of jabbering nonsense, out of which
  "kill&mdash;kill&mdash;kill" in its various tenses emerged in a frequent
  scream. Then the speech changed to English.</p>

  <p>"I tell you I have killed him! Let me show them! They called me a coward!
  They said I did not dare! They said I loved him! They lied! They lied! Let me
  through to prove they lied! I will show them the corpse! I will cut the head
  from the shoulders in their presence! Open that door and let me show them, or
  I will slay you! Open, I say! Open!"</p>

  <p>The pounding on the door resumed more fiercely, to the accompaniment of
  blasphemous torrents in three languages, such as the half-breeds use in
  Bombay when the drink is in and they revile both sets of ancestors; only it
  was worse than I ever heard from a half-breed, for it had more imagination.
  The chairman leaned over the table and smiled at us.</p>

  <p>"That is your Indian friend," he said. "No doubt he looked nice and mild
  this evening in attendance on Madame Poulakis. We selected him on purpose,
  because of his known previous loyalty to you. A little hypnotism goes a long
  way with Indians, but a little drug that we use in such cases goes longer
  yet! It makes even a white man murdering mad. But you shall see for
  yourselves."</p>

  <p>He made a sign to the men on the bench and one of them walked over to the
  door, where he tapped a signal. A moment later we heard the key rattling in
  the lock, and then, knocking down the screen before him like a whirlwind,
  Narayan Singh strode in with blazing eyes, brandishing his scimitar and
  dragging Grim by the collar with his left hand.</p>

  <p>Grim hung inert and dropped to the floor like a sack when Narayan Singh
  let go of him. I couldn't detect the slightest sign of breathing, and when I
  stooped to feel his back&mdash;for he lay face-downward&mdash;Narayan Singh
  swore savagely and lunged with his scimitar within two inches of my neck.</p>

  <p>You wouldn't have believed he was the same man who had talked with me in
  Shepheard's Hotel an hour or so before. There was spittle running down his
  beard. His mouth was all awry with frenzy. His breath came in volcanic gasps,
  as if the fires of Hell were burning in him, and every muscle in his body
  seemed to be twitching in unnatural excitement. We three jumped to our feet;
  there was no sitting down in face of that ghastliness&mdash;at least, not for
  us; the committee seemed to like it.</p>

  <p>"Yah!" he yelled, brandishing the scimitar until the air whistled and the
  blade rang. "I am Hathi the elephant, and I am musth, and whom I love I kill!
  I am the wrath of all the gods! I slay! I am the sword of the Avenger! I work
  for Yum!"</p>

  <p>I don't know what the next amazement of the program would have been.
  Incredulity fought against the evidence of eyes and ears. There lay my good
  friend Grim stone dead, so what was the use of recalling what the Sikh had
  said when sober? He was drunk and drugged now&mdash;worse than a blood-crazed
  wolf. It crossed my mind to shoot him, but Meldrum Strange without meaning to
  or knowing what had crossed my mind stepped between us.</p>

  <p>"You swine!" he thundered, facing the committee. "You dogs! You dirty,
  cowardly, sneaking, filthy swine! Kill me and be damned to you! That suits me
  perfectly. Kill me and see what happens! If there's a God, as I believe, the
  whole foul pack of you will hang!"</p>

  <p>"But you see, we're not superstitious," smiled the chairman, veiling
  savagery under a quiet sneer. "Very well, we shall have to kill you, for you
  mustn't escape to tell tales about us. We always keep our promises.
  Guards!"</p>

  <p>The three men rose together from the bench and started for us&mdash;in no
  hurry&mdash;they seemed very sure of themselves.</p>

  <p>Jeremy and I drew our pistols. Instantly one of then shouted for help; but
  he only got one word out, for I drilled him clean and he dropped. The crack
  of my repeating pistol turned chaos loose.</p>

  <p>Grim came suddenly to life almost between my legs&mdash;Narayan Singh
  turned sane and sober. Grim rushed the table on all fours&mdash;upturned it
  on the committee of five&mdash;and shoved me with all his might, saying
  nothing. Jeremy and Narayan Singh took either end of it, and shoved too,
  upsetting all five chairs. I heard Narayan Singh laugh, and the pistols going
  like a machine-gun as the scrambling committee tried to shoot through the
  table-top, or under, or around it&mdash;loosing off like crazy men as they
  struggled among the chairs, hoping to kill with a chance shot, or summon
  help, or both.</p>

  <p>But I couldn't stop to help or look, I had my hands full. One of the three
  guards rushed for the right-hand door and tugged at it, shouting to someone
  on the other side, and the third man opened fire on me at a distance of
  twelve feet. I shot him, but too low, for he lay on the floor and continued
  to blaze away at me. He got me in two places, and I felt the bone of my left
  forearm go numb. Meanwhile, the third man had dragged the door open; and a
  dozen men, all masked, came running in with knives and pistols. It looked
  like our good-by, whatever else it might be.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>I stepped in front of Meldrum Strange, who was out of breath from shoving
  at the table, and managed to drop three men, one after another, as they
  entered; a fourth fell over the first three, and that ended my present
  usefulness, for my pistol was empty, and with my left arm out of action I
  couldn't reload it, although I had a spare clip in my vest pocket. I shouted
  to Jeremy, who cut loose in my stead, and the room began to look like a
  shambles. Meldrum Strange reloaded my pistol, fumbling with excited fingers,
  and the enemy beat a retreat to consider a new method of attack, slamming
  shut the door they had entered by, and smashing a panel in order to shoot
  through it from cover.</p>

  <p>But everything happened at once. None of us was clear afterward as to the
  exact sequence of events. I balked the hole-in-the-door game by picking up
  the bench the three men had sat on throughout the interview and upending it
  against the door&mdash;a temporary stop-gap, but a good one while it lasted.
  Strange came and added his weight to mine. They smashed a second panel, but
  we lifted up the bench and held it crosswise. It seemed there was a narrow
  passage outside that prevented them from bringing all their weight to bear
  against the door, and we two held it shut for I dare say two minutes.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Grim and Narayan Singh, both without firearms&mdash;for the men
  downstairs had deprived Grim of his pistol at the front door&mdash;were
  beginning to have the worst of it. They had the table shoved all the way back
  against the third door with its legs against the wall; and in the space so
  left, crouching among upset chairs, the committee of five were about
  impregnable. Narayan Singh was alert with his scimitar to swipe at the first
  hand or head that showed, and Jeremy stood back with pistol ready, but it was
  likely to be only a matter of seconds before a volley of shots should end
  that situation.</p>

  <p>Then two things began to happen simultaneously. Men began trying to burst
  open the door behind the table, but the table, committee, and chairs added to
  the weight of Grim and Narayan Singh prevented that for the moment, until it
  dawned on the five that they only had to set their legs against the wall and
  shove in order to release the door and admit their friends.</p>

  <p>Just as they commenced doing that, the door by which we had entered the
  room burst open and five screaming women struggled in, forcing along in front
  of them the masked man who had admitted us. He was trying to help four of
  them restrain Zelmira Poulakis, who was using a long thing like a hat-pin to
  some purpose. And just as the struggling potpourri of women forced him
  backward into the room the man drew his revolver and aimed at Zelmira's head
  point blank. Jeremy shot him promptly, drilling a hole exactly through his
  temples.</p>

  <p>That staggered the four women for a moment&mdash;three of them were the
  same who had attended our dinner-party&mdash;and Zelmira shook herself partly
  free of them. She was a wild sight with her bronze hair down and her clothes
  ripped nearly off her, bleeding where the other women had torn her with their
  finger-nails, but beautiful in spite of it&mdash;or maybe because of it, for
  there was courage there, as well as frenzy; furious action in place of masked
  intrigue.</p>

  <p>"Kill those five&mdash;the committee of five!" she screamed. "Kill those
  monsters! Are you men! Kill those devils before you die!"</p>

  <p>Strange and I could no longer hold that door we had propped the bench
  against. They burst it off its hinges and we sprang back to the center of the
  room. I shot the first two men who entered, Jeremy shot another, but the rest
  rushed, and when my pistol was empty a second time three of them closed with
  me. I had only one hand to fight with. Three more of them pounced on Strange,
  and one man, standing in the door, fired on Zelmira, but missed her and
  killed one of the other women.</p>

  <p>"Kill those five! Oh, kill them!" Zelmira Poulakis screamed. "Never mind
  the others! Do a good deed! Kill those five monsters!"</p>

  <p>Then the door behind the table burst inward and half a dozen men stepped
  forward cautiously between the upset chairs and the scrambling committee. The
  committee got to their knees to shoot over the table-edge and it looked as if
  the end had come.</p>

  <p>"There they are! Kill them!" Zelmira screamed.</p>

  <p>I saw them killed. I was down under three men, struggling to break the
  neck of one, whose head was in chancery under my right arm. A second lay
  still on top of me, for Jeremy had brained him with the butt-end of his
  pistol, and the third was trying to hold my legs, which is no job for a
  weakling. I turned my head to see what was happening to Strange, whom Jeremy
  was doing his best to preserve alive until the last possible second, when
  that scimitar flashed across my line of vision&mdash;flashed like Summer
  lightning under the hanging lamp.</p>

  <p>Gosh! But I never saw the like of it&mdash;I, who have seen the
  sword-dance under Sikaram when the rival clans were showing off before the
  women! I've seen a shark, too, taking fish&mdash;left-right, left-right, and
  away again; and more than once I've seen a lion spring between the
  watch-fires, make his kill, and escape. But never, on all the continents,
  have I seen action that could hold a candle to that sword-work of Narayan
  Singh's.</p>

  <p>He slew those five committee-men in five strokes so swift that they
  resembled one, and then went blazing, berserker mad in mid-room, swinging,
  swiping, lunging, shouting "Ho!" as his blade struck home, and driving the
  astonished foe in front of him as a bull clears men out of a field.</p>

  <p>Some of them fired, but fired and ran too quickly for straight aim, most
  of them facing him, but crowding backward in one another's way; and in thirty
  seconds more the thing was over. Kennedy stood in the door of the anteroom in
  evening dress, smiling, holding a loaded pistol behind his back.</p>

  <p>"That will do now," he said quietly. His voice had that peculiar
  penetrating quality that I had noticed in the hotel when he first came
  forward to meet me.</p>

  <p>And it did do, for behind him, and through both the other doors, his hand-
  picked corps of officers came surging in; and one of the most peculiar things
  in this cantankerous old world is the resemblance between a sudden fight and
  an explosion. When it's over, it's over&mdash;done with&mdash;nothing left of
  it but wreckage and the acrid smell of powder.</p>

  <p>Kennedy's arrangements had been neat, and they worked in the nick of time,
  which of course is a sign of genius; but as Grim argued afterward, over a
  whisky and soda with a man whose name must not appear, if he hadn't been so
  particularly careful to catch all the small fry by first surrounding the
  house and then having his posse enter from every side at once, he might have
  taken those five principals alive; and that in turn might have led to the
  capture of worse rascals higher up.</p>

  <p>But, as Kennedy suggested, it wasn't a bad night's work for all that.
  There were ambulances ready, and we had twenty-eight living prisoners
  including women to stow in them, all of whom had seen the committee-men
  killed and, no longer having them to fear, were anxious to tell all they
  knew.</p>

  <p>Some of the officers drove away with the prisoners, to see them safely
  under lock and key, and the rest of us, with Zelmira Poulakis, foregathered
  in another room to patch up wounds and compare notes.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">CHAPTER XIV<br>
  "I but acted as other men would act!"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Zelmira Poulakis had the floor first, when old Narendra Nath
  had finished putting strips of plaster on her scratches. We found the old man
  cowering in another room, making magic under cover of a purple cloak.</p>

  <p>"I don't care what happens now," she said. "I have been a criminal ever
  since I was married; first because Poulakis taught me, and it seemed good
  fun; later on because I was compelled. I hoped this forced marriage to Mr.
  Meldrum Strange might prove a way of escape for me. I didn't believe he would
  marry me, and yet I half-hoped he would, because there was no other hope in
  sight.</p>

  <p>"And then this Indian, Narayan Singh, said that if Major Grim and his
  friends had anything to do with Meldrum Strange, then Meldrum Strange was
  'pakka,' as he called it, and he offered to wager his right hand against my
  slipper that if he could only talk with any of the sahibs there would be no
  doubt of the outcome. So it was agreed that when we reached the hotel this
  evening he should seize his opportunity."</p>

  <p>"She speaks truth," said Narayan Singh. "But I have told my end of the
  tale already to Ramsden sahib. Let Jimgrim tell the rest. Those women had
  orders to bring Jimgrim in their carriage, and I had orders to slay him; but
  old Narendra Nath, who brought the order to me, knowing well by that time
  that his magic took no effect on me, bade me not slay.</p>

  <p>" 'I am an old man,' said he, 'and I dare not wholly disobey these men;
  but I have seen a vision, and the stars are favorable. So I say; 'slay not,
  but make believe to fall in with the plan.'</p>

  <p>"And so I did as he said, being minded to do so in any case, whether he so
  advised or not. And when we reached this house, and the men at the door
  disarmed Jimgrim, I seized him from behind, whispering two words in his ear;
  and I dragged him upstairs into a room beside that in which the women waited.
  There he and I held a conference, and later I did as Jimgrim bade me."</p>

  <p>"Then it wasn't true," I asked, "that Grim was taken before the committee
  and examined ahead of us?"</p>

  <p>"No, not a word of truth in that," Grim answered. "Narayan Singh gave me
  the general layout; and I knew that Kennedy had most of the facts from
  Ramsden, so it was a reasonable gamble, as well as our only chance, that
  Kennedy would act swiftly. I've worked under Kennedy, and know his method
  fairly well; I figured he'd surround the house and rush it. So the one
  important thing to do was to gain time. Narayan Singh had orders to produce
  me&mdash;dead&mdash;at a given signal. They thought he was hypnotized and
  were sure he'd obey. So I had him drag me into the anteroom, and he looked so
  wild that the fellow in there didn't dare examine me to see whether I was
  properly dead. But the credit for the whole business belongs to Narayan
  Singh. My share in it was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nay, nay, sahib!" the Sikh answered. "I but acted as any other man would
  act. I take no credit. I did no more than to scout a little, and convey my
  information to the proper quarter. Yet, if there is any little merit in what
  I did&mdash;if burra sahib Kennedy considers that the sirkar is beholden to
  me&mdash;then, there is a favor I might ask, if permission were granted."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" demanded Kennedy. "I can't grant requests, you know. I can
  only recommend that they be granted."</p>

  <p>"The lady Zelmira, sahib&mdash;what is to become of her? I swore to serve
  her to the end of this affair. I beg, then, that she be not thrown in jail.
  That is surely a little thing; will the sahib grant it?"</p>

  <p>Kennedy laughed. Everybody laughed, except Zelmira Poulakis and Narayan
  Singh. The Sikh looked offended, and she miserable.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it must be amusing, since you all find it so," she said,
  holding her chin up bravely. "But it does not seem funny to me. What do you
  intend to do with me? May I go home first and get some things?"</p>

  <p>"I humbly beg your pardon," Kennedy answered. "We were laughing at our
  friend Narayan Singh's navet, not at your predicament. I don't know,
  Madame, what is to be done with you. My authority is limited. But if you
  should offer to turn State's Evidence&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Which I do!" she interrupted.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;and should undertake to help the Administration in every way
  possible to bring the members of this gang to their deserts&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Which I certainly will!" she assured him.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;then I would take upon myself the responsibility of requesting you
  to return to your own home, where, if you will stay indoors and keep quiet,
  you will be subjected for the present to no other inconvenience than a
  trustworthy guard, who will protect you from gang-vengeance. If your evidence
  should be accepted by the State, you would afterward be set entirely
  free."</p>
