Australasian</i>, Melbourne, 3 June 1939.</h3>

<hr>

<p class="first">THE name of Erle Cox is well known to readers of
<i>The Australasian</i>, by reason of his weekly book review, and
is also familiar to a wide public through the medium of his own
books, especially "Out of the Silence," which has
maintained&mdash; and is maintaining&mdash;a steady sale over a
period of 20 years or so, something unusual in these days of mass
production and short lives in novels.</p>

<p>He needs, therefore, little introduction to you as a name, but
here he is as a personality, looking, in the opinion of Esther
Paterson, who here depicts him, somewhat like John Galsworthy
facially, though any resemblance does not extend to the top of
the head&mdash;Mr. Cox's being covered with a vigorous growth of
hair.</p>

<p>He was born in Melbourne, and on leaving school went on to the
land as a vine grower at Rutherglen, on the Victorian side of the
Murray. But though there producing the "subtle alchemist," he was
also developing his own powers of alchemy, transmuting the drab
of daily experience into verse and story. For writing was in his
blood. His paternal grand father, who was an official with the
Astoria Co., a fur-trading rival to the Hudson Bay Company, wrote
a book on the Columbia River, which was published in 1831. And
his father, Boss Cox, was also a well-known writer in
Melbourne.</p>

<p>So during the 10 years he was vine growing at Rutherglen he
wrote, and continued doing so when he went into business in
Tasmania later. His short stories first found publication in the
<i>Lone Hand</i>, and from then on he wrote stories and verse for
various papers in Australia, beginning to write "Oriel" verse for
<i>The Argus</i> in 1918, following attention attracted to his
verse when he won a competition for an Anzac memorial poem. He
continued to write "Oriel" verses weekly for more than 18
years.</p>

<p><i>Out of the Silence</i>, Erle Cox's first imaginative novel,
was written over a long period during the years between 1913 and
1918. It appeared as a serial in <i>The Argus</i> in 1919, and
was published in book form in 1924, having had a steady sale ever
since. </p>

<p><i>Fool's Harvest</i>, striking a warning note to Australia in
an imagined invasion by the Cambasians, also first appeared as a
serial in <i>The Argus</i>. It was first published in book form
early this year. </p>

<p>Now Erle Cox has another novel nearing completion, again an
imaginative story, with the probable title of <i>The Missing
Angel</i>.</p>

<p>Erle Cox writes by hand and with a pen. He cannot concentrate
on work until he is actually sitting at his desk with a pen in
his hand&mdash;but having got so far, he admits he actually
enjoys the physical work of writing. And since his readers enjoy
the results, it would appear a good state of affairs for all
concerned.</p>

<h2><a id="ch0">PROLOGUE</a></h2>

<p class="first">IN presenting this transcript of the Walter
Burton manuscript for publication, the editors have desired to
remind readers that its main value lies in its being the longest
of the fourteen authentic personal narratives extant descriptive
of the Australian debacle of 1939. It should be regarded as
supplementary, only, to Major General Marsden's <i>Australian
Tragedy</i>, in which the military story of the invasion is dealt
with, and to <i>The Struggle for the Pacific</i>, by Peel and
Everard, who treat the subject from the viewpoint of
international historians. It must be remembered that, at the time
he wrote, Burton was almost entirely ignorant of the great events
that were taking place outside Australia. His conjectures were
governed largely by local conditions, and coloured by an
appalling environment. His assumptions were, therefore, at times
either partially or totally inaccurate.</p>

<a id="pic2"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Walter Burton</span>,<br>

</div>
<br>

<p>Taking into consideration his obvious handicaps however, it is
remarkable how nearly Burton's conjectures do approach the facts.
Moreover, in every instance in which it has is possible to check
his narrative in detail, his statements are fully supported,
though in many places his dates are open to correction. This
chronological haziness is due, probably, to the difficulty he
experienced in writing up his diary regularly. That he succeeded
in keeping a continuous record of his experiences at all, in the
circumstances, reflects on the determination of his character. We
have allowed his dates to stand as written, rather than make
corrections that may distract the reader's interest from his
story. For this reason, too, explanatory comment has been
inserted in the text in brackets.</p>

<p>Much difficulty has been experienced in tracing the history of
Burton's manuscript. There is no doubt it was begun, if not
completed, at the notorious concentration camp at Carrington, a
suburb of Newcastle, in 1948. It came into the possession of Mr
Rex Graham, Burton's nephew, on the death of his father, Fergus
Graham, in 1967. Mr Graham however, states, that he can barely
recollect his uncle, Walter Burton, and has no idea of how his
father obtained the manuscript. His only memories of Burton are
of a big, dark man who used to tell him stories and make him
laugh. He was at that time no more than six years of age.
Following the policy of the "Paramount Power" he was separated
from his parents when he was ten years old. By then, however, his
uncle's visits to his parents had ceased for some time. When
after the Pacific War of 1966, he again rejoined his father, his
mother had been dead for several years and his father was a
broken man. Suffering had made him morose and uncommunicative,
and beyond telling him that Walter Burton had been shot, he does
not remember him making any other reference to his brother-in-
law.</p>

<p>It can only be assumed that, by some underground means, Burton
succeeded in having the manuscript passed on to Fergus Graham
before his execution, which probably took place in 1952. Such an
incriminating document would, no doubt, have been jealously
guarded. The habit of secrecy which became second nature with
those who lived under the iron rule of the "Paramount Power" may
account for Fergus Graham's reticence with his son in connection
with the documents. Mr Rex Graham relates that he was entirely
unaware of the value of the bundle of papers until, examining
them, he came across the few disconnected pages of the diary
which were written in long-hand. The lines he was able to
decipher with great difficulty impressed him with their
importance and prompted him to hand the manuscript to the
authorities of the University of Canberra.</p>

<p>Why Burton retained these long hand pages must remain an
insoluble mystery. They suggest that Fergus Graham could never
have examined the papers carefully, or he would have destroyed
them. Although economy of space in using shorthand in writing his
story, there can be no doubt that his primary motive was secrecy.
His training as a journalist enabled him to use a script that
would most likely to baffle any agent of the 'Paramount Power'
into whose hands the manuscript may have fallen. It is evident
from the first chapter of the narrative that, in 1948, Burton was
engaged in 'subversive activities'&mdash;that comprehensive
offence that filled so many graves. The ruthless methods adopted
by the 'Paramount Power' in preventing the truth of conditions in
Australia reaching the outside world must have made either the
writing or the possession of the record a perilous
undertaking.</p>

<p>The condition of the manuscript itself bears grim evidence of
the days of its origin. There are more than twenty different
kinds and sizes of paper, which was probably filched by Burton
from any available source. It varies between common wrapping
paper and some fifty leaves that were evidently torn from a
ledger. With the exception of some half a dozen pages in ink, the
entire story is written in pencil. This is so faint in places
that chemical means were necessary to restore it for
transcription. Burton used, evidently as an extra precaution,
three systems of shorthand. This, and the condition of the
papers, greatly increased the difficulty of transcription, and we
are deeply indebted to Mr J. H. Stevens, the Government shorthand
expert, for the care he has taken in the long and arduous
work.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the inferior quality of some of the paper used
by Burton, combined with time and dampness, have damaged a few
passages of the script beyond repair. In these instances we have
filled in the blanks as carefully as possible by following the
reading of the text. After careful consideration, we have decided
to suppress several passages of Burton's narrative. These,
however, with one exception, are short, and at most do not exceed
two paragraphs in any one abridgment. In taking this step, we are
influenced by our opinion that the appalling character of the
disclosures may cause great distress to people now living. This
opinion applies particularly to the longest omission, some 2,000
words, in which Burton tells of the conditions in the women's
concentration camps at Carmel and at Mundaring in Western
Australia. In doing so we followed the example of Peel and
Everard in <i>The Struggle for the Pacific</i>, in which they
say, in reference to the same subject, that while there are some
episodes of the struggle that must never be forgotten, there are
others which, for the sake of humanity, must be obliterated from
memory.</p>

<p>As in so many other instances, biographical detail regarding
Walter Burton, other than that obtained from his narrative, is
almost non-existent. It is a tribute to the thoroughness of the
'Paramount Power' that, after two decades of occupation of
Australia, documentary records are almost as scarce as they are
of Rome or Greece after twenty centuries.</p>

<p>As he was married, and had an infant son in 1939, it may be
assumed that Burton was then at least twenty-five years of age.
His reference to the first Great War, of which he remembers
nothing, tends to confirm the belief that he was born around
1914. Of his parentage nothing is known, although there is record
of a pastoral family in the Victorian Western District, the head
of which was a Walter Burton, that suggest some connection. Even
the date of his death is uncertain, but as the events he records
do not go beyond 1952, it may be assumed he was a victim of the
tragic and ill-advised rebellion in that year. There can be no
doubt that he was a member of one of the many underground
organisations that were actively plotting against the 'Paramount
Power'. Evidently he was, so far, not a suspect; otherwise he
must then have shared the fate of his friend Clifford, which is
an example of the policy adopted by the authorities that
suspicion and guilt were synonymous.</p>

<p>However, it is apparent that Burton was one of the thousands
of desperate men who held that death was preferable to life under
the 'Paramount Power'. The loss of his wife and child converted
him into a fierce and relentless enemy of the oppression. His
life in the labour camp at Carrington added to his hatred.
Apparently, for several years he had disassociated himself from
Fergus Graham, and his dearly loved sister, so as to save them
from any suspicion of being involved in his patriotic and
dangerous plots. He must have been lonely as well as desperate.
One cannot but feel that, in the end, he must have welcomed
death, when it came. At that time Australia still had another 14
years of humiliation and debasement, before its relief by the
Pacific Protocol of 1966, when a bare 2,000,000 of its former
population of 7,000,000 white inhabitants survived, to face,
undaunted, the task of rebuilding the nation.</p>

<h2><a id="ch1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<p class="first">'AND were there really shops full of lollies and
toys once upon a time, Uncle Wally?'</p>

<p>'Plenty of them, towhead,' I told him.</p>

<p>He raised his head from my shoulder against which he had been
snuggling, and turned for confirmation of this amazing statement
to Lynda. As such an idea belonged to the realms of fairy tales
in his mind, his appeal to his mother was to unimpeachable
authority.</p>

<p>Lynda, looking up from her knitting, nodded her head and
added, 'And perhaps we shall have them again sometime, darling.'
Then seeing the few wretched little sweets I had given him, she
charged me with spoiling her son&mdash;unconscious of the pathos
of the indictment.</p>

<p>'What's spoiling?' He was at the age when every new word
demands elucidation.</p>

<p>Just then the long-drawn wail of a steam siren came from the
mills by the distant wharf. To a thousand men it was the summons
to another night of toil. Lynda put aside her knitting and stood
up.</p>

<p>'Eight o'clock, Rexy Boy, bed time.'</p>

<p>She held out her hands. With an obedience that was part nature
and part training he slipped off my knees. He bestowed a rather
sticky kiss, first on his father, then on me, and turned to his
mother. Fergus and I watched them until Lynda closed the door on
the next room behind her.</p>

<p>We sat staring at the smouldering heap of smoky coal slack on
the hearth that scarcely took the chill from the room.</p>

<p>I spoke my thoughts aloud. "Spoiling him! Think of it, man!
Half a dozen miserable little sweets one wouldn't have given to a
beggar child a few years ago! That's spoiling him! The tragedy of
it!"</p>

<p>Fergus stirred uneasily in his creaking home-made chair.
"Luxury is relative, although we have only learned it lately," he
said. "But don't let it get you down, Wally."</p>

<p>"But it does get me down!" I retorted. "I know you and Lynda
have carved out some strange kind of paradise for yourselves in
the common hell we live in, but I cannot help wondering what Rex
and a few thousand kiddies like him will think when they are old
enough to know what we have done to them."</p>

<p>"We?" Fergus sounded argumentative.</p>

<p>"Yes, we! You, I and everyone else who survives. We asked for
it, and got it. But it's so infernally unfair to them. Dash it,
Fergus! it was their heritage more than ours."</p>

<p>"That conscience of yours must be a nasty companion," Fergus
grinned. "Don't let it prod you, old boy. Be reasonable, and
recognise that neither you nor I, personally, could have altered
things one hair's breadth. Kismet!"</p>

<p>"Kismet be blowed!" I came back. "I doubt if in another twenty
years the children who are growing up now will accept that
explanation."</p>

<p>"Arguing can't help us, Wally&mdash;or them." I knew he was
trying to turn me off the subject. It was a settled policy of
both my sister and Fergus not to let me dwell on the works of the
"Paramount Power."</p>

<p>But I felt I had to talk, if only for once. "Sorry old man!" I
replied, "but it was the thought of the boy that set me going.
This room, your shack here, epitomizes everything. That waste
coal you are graciously permitted to buy; this chair you have
made yourself; that table&mdash;and we stole the wood it was
built from; that synthetic muck that Lynda is using to knit
undies for the boy, while they take all our wool; and you, mind
you Fergus, are lucky in this luxury because you had the good
fortune to have trained as a metallurgist, and they want your
brains."</p>

<p>"It's you who have the right to grouse, Wally. Lyn worries
about your camp life.</p>

<p>"Pah! what matter about me," I said. "We men can stand it,
though the yoke does gall. I'm on day shift, not as an act of
mercy, but because I have a certain value in these as a working
animal," and I held out my blackened and calloused hands. "No,
it's the Lyndas and the Rexes of our world who do the suffering.
I tell you Fergus&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lynda's re-entry cut me short. She went to her chair quietly
and took up her work. Then before her fingers began to weave she
looked from one to the other of us. Then she smiled. "What is it
that is so important I may not hear it?"</p>

<p>Fergus turned a sympathetic eye on me. "Sorry Lyn," I said,
"We got talking about twenty-eight south and one hundred and
twenty-nine east, and all that."</p>

<p>"Wally, why will you talk of it?" she gently, "it only
hurts."</p>

<p>"Oh!" I exclaimed, "Don't I know how you two try to help. I do
understand, and God knows I am grateful, but my dears, if I don't
talk, do you imagine I don't think? That first day is with me in
every waking hour."</p>

<p>Fergus looked, and I have no doubt felt, uncomfortable. He
hates it to be known that he has been helping anyone. Lyn
stretched out her hand, and patted my patched dungaree knee.
"Talk of something else, Wally," she pleaded.</p>

<p>"I am sorry Lyn, for letting myself gob," I said contritely.
"But it was thinking of Rex and you that started me off. I was
wondering what he would think later on."</p>

<p>"He'll stick it out, like two other men I know," she
smiled.</p>

<p>"Well," I announced, "one thing I am determined on is that Rex
will know the truth when he gets older. I have made up my mind to
write the whole thing just as we saw it. If ever we get out of
this mess it may be a lesson to remember."</p>

<p>They looked at one another, and I almost smiled at the concern
in their faces. Their comment was characteristic of each. Said
Lynda, her voice deep with feeling, "Why crucify yourself again,
Wally?"</p>

<p>"A small price to pay if the lesson is learned," I
replied.</p>

<p>From the practical angle Fergus put in, "And need I remind you
of what the P.P. would do if they got hold of your literary
efforts. Three minutes trial, three minutes to the nearest wall,
and then&mdash;phut! Don't be a mug, Wally."</p>

<p>I laughed. "The case in a nutshell!"</p>

<p>"Besides," he went on, "Suppose you did write it you wouldn't
have an earthly hope of doing anything with it."</p>

<p>"It would be worth doing even for the faint chance of getting
it through to the next visit of the United States Commission of
Inspection," I contended.</p>

<p>"You're right about it being a faint hope," Fergus growled.
"Lord! It makes me sick to think how the P.P. hoodwinks those
futile Commissions. And then our lords and masters have the nerve
to publish their reports to ell us of the 'broad humanity of
their administration.' I'd like to have five minutes up a dark
lane with the American gent who wrote that phrase."</p>

<p>"Do you think they are really hoodwinked?" I asked Fergus.
"They might be playing possum. You know the Yanks are not fools
exactly, as a rule."</p>

<p>"If they're not," he retorted sourly, "those reports must be a
salve to the national conscience. Anyway, it wouldn't make any
difference to us."</p>

<p>Then Lynda returned to the attack. "Listen, Wally, why take
the risk now. We have only twelve years to endure before the
evacuation. You could do it then."</p>

<p>"Evacuation!" I snorted. "Lynda, we've got to face the fact
sooner or later. There is not going to be any evacuation."</p>

<p>"But the Treaty of Berlin!" she gasped, her glance going from
me to Fergus.</p>

<p>He nodded his head. "I'm afraid Wally is right."</p>

<p>"But how could they&mdash;" her voice broke.</p>

<p>"Lyn, old girl," I said, "we must recognise now that so far as
Australia is concerned, the Treaty of Berlin was a complete
washout. At the time the Powers gave the P.P. twenty years' right
of occupation during the period of rehabilitation, each of them
knew it would be permanent. The clause was a sop to their
consciences. Think for a moment! Who is going to enforce the
evacuation obligation? Not Berlin or Rome&mdash;their people
wouldn't allow another war, for one thing. Can Britain, even with
the best will in the world? Russia has too much internal trouble
to bother about anything else. And, as for the United States,
they'll utter pious platitudes, and fall back on the national
policy of non-intervention. No! we're finished!"</p> <br>

<p class="footnote">[Burton did less than justice to the United
States. Washington was fully aware of the danger arising from the
twenty years' occupation clause. It was with the object of
ultimately enforcing it that the Pan-American Confederation was
formed, which made the evacuation of Australia the leading plank
in its policy of control of the Pacific&mdash;a policy that bore
fruit in 1966. &mdash;Eds.]</p> <br>

<p>"Yes," added Fergus, "and the deuce of it is that the P.P. can
use the evidence of the American Commissions of Inspection to
prove their justification for sitting tight. They are treating us
with kindness and generosity, and we are repaying them with
savage hostility, and are totally unfitted to govern
ourselves."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid this is a nasty shock for you, Lynda," I said.</p>

<p>She smiled up at us both. "Not so much as you would think. I
suppose we all thought it before, and have not put it into
words."</p>

<p>That was like my sister. Her pluck was always unconquerable,
and I never knew her try to dodge an issue, however disagreeable.
I think the hard knocks only welded her closer to Fergus.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," I said, "I'll have to make a move to the camp.
My permit is only till 10.30, and the blighters will cancel it
for keeps if I'm late."</p>

<p>"Wait," Lyn said, jumping up. "I have some scones."</p>

<p>"Not on your life," I laughed. "I'm not eating your scones.
You two would give your hides to feed me, but you're not going
to!'</p>

<p>"Oh! Wally!" she was a little hurt at my refusal.</p>

<p>"Don't be sore with me, Lyn," I protested. "I know you want me
to have them. If you and Fergus won't have them Rex must. He is
more important than I am."</p>

<p>"But I made them for you," she pleaded.</p>

<p>"And I am sure you did. But&mdash;" my eyes fell on her
knitting, "How many meals did you go without to buy that wretched
wool substitute for towhead's undies? Now, the truth!"</p>

<p>Lyn looked guilty. "He must have his clothes."</p>

<p>"Surely!" I answered, "and therefore you and Fergus must
develop a streak of lean in your physical bacon, and yet you want
me to eat your scones. No, my dear girl! Honesty before social
polish is my newest motto."</p>

<p>Fergus grinned at me, understanding. "He's a dour dell, Lyn,
and it will take more than you to move him."</p>

<p>"Oh! You men!" She resigned herself to the inevitable. "But
Wally, please don't write anything," she asked, returning
womanlike to another problem. "I'll give no promises, clear."</p>

<p>I stood up, nerving myself for the real reason of my visit.
"Lyn, I've something to say that will hurt a bit."</p>

<p>She stood silent, and waiting.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I will have to cut out my visits to you&mdash;at
least for a while."</p>

<p>She put out her hand in appeal.</p>

<p>"You know," I hurried on, "I'm mixed up in things we don't
talk about, and the risk of bringing suspicion on you and Fergus
is not fair. My coming here is too dangerous for you."</p>

<p>"But you're not suspect?" Her voice caught, and fear came to
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Honestly, Lyn, I think not." I reassured her. "You know how
careful we are, and the precautions we take. If they suspected me
I should have been picked out before now. But the risk is always
there. Sooner or later&mdash;well, we can't afford to take
risks."</p>

<p>"Were you followed?" asked Fergus anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes," I laughed, "but that is mere routine. Every man who is
given leave at night has a trailer. Mine's cooling his heels
outside, and, by Jove! I'm going back through the swamp, and I'll
make them cooler before he has finished with me."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps," Lynda said wistfully, "you can send us
messages through Bob Clifford."</p>

<p>I was afraid of that, but I had to tell them. "You will have
to know sooner or later, Lyn. They got Clifford this
afternoon."</p>

<p>Fergus rose to his feet with a curse on his lips, and he was a
man who seldom used "language." Lyn covered her eyes with her
hands. "Has he been&mdash;" The word would not come to her
lips.</p>

<p>"No," I replied, "but it's almost worse. They have drafted him
for the Yampi mines."</p>

<p>"Have you seen anything or is it hearsay?" asked</p>

<p>"I saw him in the gang as they were being marched to the
transport. We just looked at one another. It was too dangerous to
give any sign of recognition. But I feel certain he knew that I
understood," I explained.</p>

<p>"Did you hear what happened," asked Lyn. There were tears in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Just the usual thing. He and about twenty-five others were
called out at afternoon muster, and were marched to the transport
direct. No trial or explanations. The yard Commandant announced
to the muster that they had been drafted for Yampi."</p>

<p>"That cruiser business last week, I suppose," said Fergus,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Most likely," I replied. "But of course they never admit
anything. Still, when a hole thirty feet long is blown below the
waterline of a perfectly new 15,000 ton cruiser while she is
lying at her moorings, we mustn't be surprised if some nasty-
minded officer of the P.P. tries to connect us with the joyful
event. Have you heard anything about it, Fergus'?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "You know I don't hobnob with the P.P., but
I have picked up enough of the language to overhear that they are
boiling with rage about their beastly ship. I think they must
have lost about seventy men as well, from scraps of indignation I
hear."</p>

<p>"And we'll pay the price, more or less," I added. "But it's
worth it."</p>

<p>Lynda put her hand on my arm. "Wally were you&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Fergus cut her short. "No questions Lynda. now or ever. By
heaven! Wally I'll help&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll do nothing of the kind," I interrupted. "Remember the
rule, and it is cast iron, we'll have no married men in the
game."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"No 'buts' old man," I persisted, "It is too unfair to the
women to let you in. Remember what they did to Harry Bell's wife
to make him speak, and they say that until she lost
consciousness, she screamed to him not to tell."</p>

<p>"Ann Bell only did what any of us would do," said Lynda
softly. "Harry did a braver thing by keeping silent." Then she
placed her hand through Fergus' arm and looked up at him with a
queer little smile on her lips and went on, "Darling, if you ever
bought my life at that price I would spit in your face before I
died of shame for my husband." And we both knew she meant it. But
that is what the P.P. had made of our men and our women.</p>

<p>"Anyway Lyn, dear," I said, "You must see that I have to keep
clear of you both."</p>

<p>She nodded. "I'll have to practise what I preach. Good-bye,
dearest, and God guard you." She put her arms about me and kissed
me.</p>

<p>Fergus came to the door with me. "About that trailer of
yours," he whispered, "You won't&mdash;" he paused.</p>

<p>"No," I reassured him. "I had thought of it, but it would be
too obvious. Not to-night at any rate. I know who he is, and we
can do it some other time. I'll take him a dance in the swamp,
and with luck he might get pneumonia. Anyway, we have him on the
list of pests, and it's only a question of time before his name
is struck off."</p>

<p>He wrung my hand. "Good night and good luck old man. Try to
get news of yourself through to us."</p>

<p>"It's a promise," I replied, and walked off slowly towards the
camp to give my follower time to sight me. It is a remarkable
coincidence that four evenings later he was accidentally run down
and killed by a motor lorry on the Maitland Road.</p> <hr>

<h2><a id="ch2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<p class="first">WHEN I made my boast that I would put my story
of our tragedy into writing I had no idea that the job would
prove so strenuous. Dodging the 'blowflies', as we called the
P.P. spies in our camp home at Carrington, with its barbed wire
walls and primitive housing, has been the least of my troubles
since I began. Although the average camp population is 5,000 men,
the authorities did not include a writing room among its
amenities. Much less did they consider a supply of writing paper
necessary. Letters from without are not regarded with favour by
the powers that be. The few that reach us are carefully read and
tested with chemicals for unauthorised communications before they
are handed over&mdash;if ever. Letters outward bound are
subject&mdash;few as they are, to an even more rigorous scrutiny.
Such paper as I have collected so far had been obtained by
methods which, in the early part of 1939, I would have regarded
as criminal. Today I look upon its acquisition as a game of
chance with the odds against the player.</p>

<p>Now I have sufficient paper with which to begin, and two
extremely illicit lead pencils, the problem arises to find a
place in which to use them with any approach to comfort.
Fortunately, I can trust my shack mates, though my excursion into
literature does not add to their comfort--or safety for that
matter. Perhaps a description of the camp will better explain the
difficulties.</p>

<p>Our shacks are laid out in orderly streets on low ground, that
is a bog in winter and a dust pile in summer. Each iron shack is
10 ft. by 10 ft. and 8 ft. high. On the walls on either side of
the door are fixed three superimposed bunks, 3 ft. wide. The 4
ft. space between them is bare. Since we own nothing but the
clothes we stand in, the absence of wardrobes is no hardship.
Although there are six bunks in each shack the registered
inhabitants number twelve. They are conducted on the Box and Cox
System. The day shift sleeps in them at night and vice versa.</p>

<p>To the north we would have had a fine view of the Hunter were
not the wharf that forms the boundary occupied by a barbed wire
protected platform decorated with machine guns. They added a wire
netting screen after some choice spirits among us knocked out a
few of the machine gun guards with stones during the hours of
darkness. To the east a similar platform screens the town of
Newcastle from view, while the machine guns provide for a cross
fire down the streets of the camp should the need arise--as it
has on three occasions. The south side is built up with a maze of
electrified wire, and on the west are the works once known as the
Broken Hill Proprietary Steel Mills. The 200 yard passage between
the camp and the mills where we work is also heavily protected on
both sides by barbed wire lest we lose our way between the works
and our camp.</p>

<p>However, I have found that, by leaving the door of our shack
slightly open at night, a ray from the guard light nearest us
gives sufficient light by which to write. Beyond inventing new
adjectives to qualify the word "fool" my shack mates raise no
objection to my writing. Anything done against rules is something
of an entertainment to them, and as my activities amount to a
capital offence they are prepared to put up with any
inconvenience to help me. Indeed, when they learned the subject
of my work, most of them became enthusiastic helpers, and I am
indebted to them for supplying personal experiences and
information I would not have obtained otherwise. There are men in
the camp from every part of Australia. From among them I have
been able to collect many details beyond the reach of my personal
experience.</p>

<p>Should this crazy shorthand of mine ever come to be
transcribed, my sympathies go out to him who undertakes the job.
Whoever he may be, he can take my word for it that in the writing
of it and in the concealment of the manuscript, a dozen men are
risking their lives daily, until the time comes when we can find
means to pass it on to an American Commission of inspection, or
failing that, convey it to the safekeeping of my brother-in-law,
Fergus Graham.</p>

<p>One of the perennial sources of argument in the camp is the
origin of our slavery. Strange as it may seem, there is very
little bitterness in the disputes, nor is there much personal
feeling. We have all gone beyond that. Hate and cold, implacable
lust for vengeance there are in plenty, but it is all directed
against the Paramount Power. I think we have come to recognise
that each one must shoulder his share of the obloquy. Its root
was in our own smug self-satisfaction. We wanted ease, we wanted
a White Australia, and we wanted to keep it for people of British
birth only. But we kept our eyes closed to the truth that the
ease and the high standard of living had to be sacrificed if we
were to continue to hold the more precious portions of our
heritage.</p>

<p>With that useless and tragic wisdom that comes after the event
we can recognise now the warning after warning that went
unheeded. Whoever tried to open our eyes was a warmonger or a
scaremonger with an axe to grind. No public man dared raise his
voice on the fallacy of high wages, vast expenditure on social
welfare, or against our besotted addiction to sport. The
Leftists, the "parlor pinks" and all their tribe arranged
themselves with every form of pacifism&mdash;some sound, some
rotten to the core&mdash;to oppose all attempts at adequate
defence measures. In their minds defence represented militarism
and profiteering armament interests. And we were caught in the
storm almost naked. Gad! but they have paid the price of finding
out since then.</p>

<p>Even though we had been told early in 1939 what was brewing in
the north I doubt if we would have accepted the story as being
within the bounds of possibility. I think we were a people of
fundamentally decent instincts then, who would not believe it
possible that other people would commit acts which would not
enter our minds. Had any one man known the truth and preached it
from end to end of Australia he would have been bowled down as a
scaremonger. Put into words the great plot would seem too
fantastic for credence.</p>

<p>We know now it was true. But then, how was it possible to
believe that three Great Powers would conspire to kill and rob
one. Was it credible that by carefully thought out plans, the
attack, without warning, would be synchronised throughout the
whole world. Even allowing this, would anyone dream that the
sworn ally of the victim would desert its friend in the day of
peril. But above all could anyone conceive the grim humor of one
of the three bandit Powers double crossing the other two, and
helping itself to the choicest spoils while the other two did the
fighting. We in Australia are like the laughing hyena in that we
have very little to laugh about. Nevertheless there is something
to smile at in reflecting on the feelings of the two when they
found that they had been swindled by their accomplice. It will be
a lasting regret to me that what the two wolves said to the
jackal when they learned the truth will not be known.</p> <br>

<p class="footnote">[Burton died too soon. All that the wolves
said to the jackal will be found in Peel and Everard's <i>The
Struggle for the Pacific</i>. They never forgave the Paramount
Power for its treachery, and stood aside when the Pan-American
Confederation took punitive action in 1966. &mdash;Eds.]</p> <br>

<p>But our ignorance of what was coming cannot be offered as an
excuse. I belong to the generation that missed the first Great
War that embodied the joke of all the ages&mdash;'the war to end
war'. Our parents, in disregarding the warnings, were caught off
their guard in 1914, just as we were in 1939. But they bad
sufficient sense to have every available man in Australia under
some kind of military training. But in 1939, with the whole world
feverishly piling up arms, we were fiddling about plans for war
material, and entirely neglecting our man power. That, in the
face of the certainty that the next war would be in the Pacific,
and that we would be in the thick of it I suppose it is natural
for my generation to blame those doddering idiots of 1918 for
their crazy policy of self-determination for small nations. They
hadn't the sense to see that in forming thousands of miles of new
frontiers in Europe they were creating a new cause for war in
every mile of them.</p>

<p>But then the first Great War was 20 years behind us. and the
Diggers were all ageing men. We youngsters knew they had been
great fighters, but to us the fighting was more of a rage of
history than actual fact.</p>

<p>Spring was coming in with September&mdash;with the Paramount
Power coming in, too, a bare three weeks away. But our Australia
seemed so safe, so inviolable. Yet all the time we were hanging
like ripe fruit for any hand to pluck. It reminds me of those
lines of Kipling, in 'The Ballad of the Clampherdown':&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">It was our warship Clampherdown<br>
That carried an armour belt;<br>
But fifty feet at stern and bow<br>
Lay bare as the paunch of the purser's sow<br>
To the hail of the Nordenfeldt.</p> <br>


<p>Australia was like the <i>Clampherdown</i>. Everything outside
the range of a few short guns was 'bare as the paunch of the
purser's sow' to all comers. The armour belt was narrow and weak,
and our Clampherdown's guns were undermanned. But we appointed a
lot of advisory councils.</p>

<p>God! the folly of it!</p>

<p>Spring was coming in with September--and so was the Paramount
Power; a bare three weeks away. We were talking about such vital
matters as football finals. I have tried often to remember any
one thing worth doing in life that I did during September, 1939,
before that Saturday morning. But I can remember nothing. I went
to talkies I suppose; yarned about the coming yachting season or
the surfing; went to the office and did my work. I remember the
State Parliament was in recess, so I was having a fairly easy
time at the office, because of it. I know Gwen&mdash;the first
time I have written that name in nine years&mdash;was dividing
her time between our boy and the garden of our home on Balmoral
Heights, overlooking Middle Harbor. As I write a queer incident
comes to my mind. I suppose I had jumped from a tram in Spit Road
at the Stanton Street intersection a thousand times or more. But
it was only on that Saturday that I really saw what a wonderful
view through the Heads there was from the Stanton Street
corner.</p>

<p>There is good cause why that memory rises clear cut from a
host of blurred impressions.</p>

<p>But even before the first of the month every plan in three
nations for what was to follow had been completed to the last
detail. They were only waiting for the dawning of Saturday,
September 23. Even had we known then of the armada that left a
Pacific base in three divisions, between the seventh and the
eleventh of the month, it would not have made much difference to
the result. The knowledge might have prolonged the agony for a
week or two. Only one thing could have altered the course of
events. It is one of those futile "ifs" of history. Had the two
wolf powers known of the treachery to them contemplated by the
jackal, they must have held their hands. They believed in the
doctrine of honor among thieves, however, and were badly left.
But since they were all bandits together, the wolves should not
have been surprised at the bad faith of the jackal. It is
possible that the Paramount Power had reason to believe that
after pulling the chestnuts out of the fire it would have been
left with the husks. In any case it was able to sit in at the
Berlin Conference with all the trumps in its pocket so far as
Australia was concerned.</p> <br>

<p class="footnote">[History proves that Burton's suggestion was
correct. Despite their indignation towards the Paramount Power,
it is abundantly clear that the two European powers fully
intended to repudiate their engagements, and to curb the
Paramount Power's ambitions in the Pacific. &mdash;Eds.]</p> <hr>

<h2><a id="ch3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<p class="first">ONE of the strange and incomprehensible features
of that first day is that, though I have prayed to forget the
events of the afternoon, and cannot, I can remember so little of
its earlier hours&mdash;those last uncounted hours of happiness
for such a host of human beings. There seems to be a chasm of one
moment between two eras&mdash;one second of time, but worlds
apart.</p>

<p>To show how little we value the gifts of peace, let me number
the little handful of little daily things that I remember of the
last six hours&mdash;then weigh against the rest of my story.</p>

<p>Saturday. September 23, 1939, now known as 'Bloody Saturday',
was one of those perfect spring days that only Sydney can show.
It was warm without being hot. There was scarcely a breath of
wind. and the sky was cloudless. I was down on the duty book to
do a meeting in the Domain on Sunday afternoon, so I had my
Saturday free. I cannot remember bathing, shaving or breakfast. I
must have dawdled a good deal, because I know I had to hurry when
I left home. I had made an appointment at the office with Max
Peters, who was giving me some standard roses, and I was to meet
him at 10.30. Gwen was quite excited about them. She was washing
the baby as I rushed out of the house, pulling on my coat. As I
reached the door she called out to me to bring home some talcum
powder. It was then just about 10 o'clock. and I had no time to
spare. I cannot even remember what frock she was wearing or what
we talked about at breakfast&mdash;the last time but one&mdash;I
saw her. The 25 minutes run into the city to Wynyard is a
complete blank. The day had brought out an unusual crowd even for
Saturday morning, and it took me 10 minutes to get across to the
office in Castlereagh street.</p>

<p>The usual calm of a morning daily newspaper enveloped the
building. The literary staffs floor, the third, was dead. In the
sub's room I found Don Ringfield. our deputy chief, and Billings,
the police roundsman, exchanging airy persiflage. I asked for
Max.</p>

<p>'No hope 'for your roses this morning, Wally,' said Don with a
grin. 'Your little playmate has gone out to the Hawkesbury, using
incendiary language. He explained before he left that you were
expecting him.'</p>

<p>'Why the Hawkesbury?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Well,' drawled Don, glancing over a piece of paper he picked
up from the table. 'According to our correspondent at Brooklyn,
some warped genius has blown up the railway bridge. At five ten
this mooning two spans at each end went sky high from their
piers. As that makes four spans out of seven, I should say the
bridge&mdash;as a bridge&mdash;is a washout.'</p>

<p>'Rot!' l exclaimed. 'Why should anyone want to blow up a
bridge like that?' Preposterous!'</p>

<p>'Strange to say I'm inclined to agree with you. Anyway as I
know the Dinker is hacking divots out of the Killara Club
fairways I hadn't the nerve to call him in to give him the glad
tidings.'</p>

<p>The Dinker was our chief, and one who did not suffer fools
gladly.</p>

<p>'Anyway,' I said, 'the even Big papers will get the cream of
it if it's, true.'</p>

<p>'My idea exactly,' Don nodded, 'so why worry?'</p>

<p>Just then Billings, who had left the room, exploded back,
howling like a dingo because the taps in the lav. were dry.</p>

<p>I left them arguing. Don, suggesting as Billings never washed
and never drank water, he had nothing to howl about that could
not be cured with a pint of hops. It was none of my business
anyway, it must then have been about 11 o'clock. What I did for
the next half hour I cannot remember. I know I bought the talcum
powder. The next thing I remember I was walking just below Hunter
street in George street Then it happened.</p>

<p>The whole city seemed to tremble from one roar of explosion.
It was a crash that drowned the roar of traffic for a second. I
can still see how the entire pedestrian traffic stopped dead in
its tracks. Everyone was staring a question at his neighbour.</p>

<p>A young fellow close to me said, 'Gosh that sounds like a
powder magazine!' An older man. wide-eyed, retorted: 'Magazine be
blowed! That was an air bomb and a dashed big one, too. I heard
scores of them in China last year.'</p>

<p>Even as he spoke there came two more, almost together. A
pause, and then <i>crash! crash!</i> a dozen times in succession,
followed by a prolonged roar. Intuition; a pressman's instinct,
something clicked in my mind, and connected the Hawkesbury bridge
with the riot. There was a taxi passing slowly. I sprang on to
the footboard and shouted at the driver: '<i>Express</i> office.
Castlereagh Street! Drive like blazes.'</p>

<p>The whole city seemed rocking as I slipped in beside the
driver. He went into Hunter street on two wheels. The turn into
Pitt street almost dislocated my neck. We were blocked for a
minute at the Market street turn, but I don't think it took much
more than three minutes before I was going up the office stain
three steps at a time. Don Ringfield was alone in the subs.'
room. For once his pose of indifference had dropped. His face was
white, and he was speaking in jerks. As I broke into the room he
held up his hand to silence my question.</p>

<p>I heard: 'Yes! yes! Are you sure? Five squadrons of seven
each! Yes! Both of them?' His eyes registered bewildered
consternation. 'You saw the marks? Positive it was a red diamond
in a black square? Good God, no! They couldn't! Impossible!'</p>

<p>There was a pause, and Don broke in again. 'But, Ted, that's
crazy; that must have come from somewhere! Yes! yes! All right!
I'm afraid so! Ring again the moment you see anything.' He
slammed down the receiver and face between his hands.</p>

<p>'For the love o' Mike, Don, spill it!' I demanded.</p>

<p>'Wally,' he said, and his voice was hoarse. 'Unless my brother
Ted has gone completely bughouse, 35 large monoplanes have blown
in from nowhere and blasted the forts at the Heads out of
existence.'</p>

<p>'How from nowhere? It sounds crazy.'</p>

<p>'He says they came straight In from dead east. He saw them
come. There is not a ship in sight on the horizon. They were
flying low over the water, and only took elevation about a mile
out. They seemed to know every gun emplacement and fairly
plastered them with bombs. Then they turned and went back the way
they came. He says there isn't a whole pane of glass left in
Manly.'</p>

<p>'Did you say a red diamond on a black square?" I asked
breathlessly.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>'And that means&mdash;'</p>

<p>'It does, my boy, and it means there's a fleet waiting below
the horizon and we're for it.'</p>

<p>He sat drumming with his fingers on the edge of the table.
'That accounts for the Hawkesbury Bridge,' I muttered. Don stared
at me without answering. Then suddenly he jumped to his feet and
exclaimed, 'Great Scot! the water! Do you know anyone in the
Water Board Office?'</p>

<p>I grabbed the telephone and dialled as well as my shaking
fingers would let me. I almost squealed with impatience at the
delay in getting my man. When I heard his voice I said, 'Burton,
'<i>Express</i> here, Williams, what's the dope about there being
no water in the taps?'</p>

<p>'How on earth did you hear about it?' the voice demanded.</p>

<p>'Come clean!' I managed to laugh.</p>

<p>'Well, the <i>Herald</i> has it, too. Every one of the 72-inch
mains from Prospect reservoir was blasted out in three places
beyond the Liverpool road early this morning. There's hell to pay
here.'</p>

<p>'Nothing to what there's going to be,' I said as I hung
up.</p>

<p>As I broke the news to Don he looked round the room and said:
'Well, Wally, we're having a very nice day for it, whatever it
may be. I suppose we carry on nobly&mdash;two blinking
Casabiancas!'</p>

<p>'Rule me out for five minutes and then I'm with you.'</p>

<p>I picked up the telephone receiver and dialled my home. Gwen
herself, eager and anxious, answered. I cut short her excited
questions about the explosions. 'Listen, Gwen,' I said earnestly,
'get the car out. Don't stop to pack. but throw anything you
value that is small into the back seat. Take some milk and
clothes for Bunty and yourself, and then get away as soon as you
can. Go through French's Forest to Hornsby. Don't mind speed
limits. Dodge back from Hornsby by the Galston road to Windsor.
Wait there and I'll try to get to you.'</p>

<p>'Wally. why?'</p>

<p>'Afraid the city will be bombarded. Don't go near it for a
short cut. Don't go near it on any account. Have you any
money?'</p>

<p>'Yes, about seven pounds; but what about you?'</p>

<p>'Don't ask questions. Get to it, I'll join you as soon as I
can. Promise, Gwen!'</p>

<p>'All right. But are you sure?'</p>

<p>'Hope I'm wrong. But hurry and don't talk.'</p>

<p>I cut her off to ensure her obedience. Said Don as I turned
round: 'Thank God I'm a bachelor and all my people are at Yass
except Ted.'</p>

<p>As he was speaking the phone rang again. He beat me in the
grab for it. I watched the tense expression on his face as he
listened after saying, 'Yes, Ted,' It was his brother again.
Presently he snapped, 'Can't you make out their
number?'&mdash;'Certain to be!'&mdash; Less than half an
hour!'&mdash;'God only knows'&mdash;'I would, if I were
you.'&mdash;'Get while the going's good.'</p>

<p>He hung up and said, 'There's a whole mob of ships coming over
the horizon. Can't make out how many. Ted's going to do a bunk.
Don't blame him!' We looked blankly at one another.</p>

<p>'Great Scott!' I said. 'If they start shooting into the city!
It's absolutely packed with people&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, and it won't take them much more than half an hour to
get in range,' Don jerked out.</p>

<p>'We might warn them.'</p>

<p>'Someone's sure to be doing it!'</p>

<p>'The evening papers will have out extraordinaries,' I said.
'Try the wireless stations and the town hall.'</p>

<p>We each took a telephone, but it was no use. Every number we
tried was engaged&mdash;Parliament House among them. It was a
good sign. Someone must be hard at it I may say here that,
although it was barely 12 o'clock, the news was spreading like
wild fire. Both the Government and the town hall had ordered all
broadcasting stations to keep repeating an appeal to empty the
city as I soon as possible.</p>

<p>My anxiety about Gwen and Bunty increased. I wanted to make
sure she had got away. I told Don&mdash;and added that if they
bombarded the city the odds were against any newspapers coming
out. Anyway, I would come back and chance it after I had been. We
made the office the rendezvous and I left, Don saying he would
stick it out. whatever might come.</p>

<p>When I reached the street it looked more like a disturbed
anthill than anything else. There was panic in the air, but the
beginning of it only. Though the warnings were being broadcast
they had barely begun to take effect. But when I turned into
Martin place, on my way to the Wynyard station the confusion was
apparent.</p>

<p>I stopped for nothing, though excited voices were rising round
me. I felt if the crowd once began to surge into the streets
progress would be impossible. Remember, it was not much more than
fifteen minutes since the sound of the first bombing had died
down. It was not until I reached George street and was within
sixty yards of the station that I encountered the first definite
warning. A newsboy was running along the opposite footpath with a
news placard:</p>
<br>

<p class="headline">WARNING!&mdash;EVACUATE CITY!&mdash;HURRY!</p>
<br>

<p>As his message caught my eye he decided to take his own advice
for he dropped his placard and sprang for a west-bound tram.</p>

<p>By good luck, as I dodged through the fast-growing crowd in
the underground entrance I found a Spit tram on the point of
starting. It was crowded almost to capacity with excited
passengers, few of whom seemed to know or realise what had
happened. As we passed out of the tunnel on the Harbour Bridge I
turned my eyes down toward the Heads. The harbour was flooded
with sunshine. The whole scene was as quiet and untroubled as
always&mdash;serene, peaceful, and beautiful. Close to Garden
Island I saw one of the cruisers, probably the <i>Adelaide</i>,
but not the <i>Canberra</i>. Three destroyers were behind the
island. A motor pinnace with a foaming wake was making toward the
cruiser, and the last thing I noticed was a hoist of signal flags
on her mast.</p>

<p>Never did a tram seem to move so slowly as. that I had
boarded. It stopped at every halt, and it was blocked by an
increasing number of motor-cars making toward the city. But even
so, the scene did not seem to warrant the sense of desperate
anxiety that came over me.</p>

<p>I was mentally calculating the possibilities, and the length
of time to spare before the attack could come within range. Not
for one minute did I doubt that it was coming. All the way I was
turning my eyes back over the city wondering why no planes of
ours were on their way. Still I hoped that we had an hour of
grace.</p>

<p>When it came the shook was physical. We had just reached
Cremorne junction when from over the Clontarf rise there came a
series of sharp detonations followed almost instantly by smashing
explosions apparently close ahead of us. The tram halted with a
jerk. There were not more than a dozen passengers left. A woman
began to scream. We jumped off into the street. The explosions
continued, and smoke began to rise over the houses in the
distance.</p>

<p>As we stood, there was a series of terrific bursts among the
massed dwellings of Cremorne and Mosman. Everyone seemed to be
yelling at the motor-man or the conductor. The street was full of
excited people shouting at one another.</p>

<p>I pressed to the front of the car and begged the motor-man to
go on. He cried out.</p>

<p>'What's it all about? What's happening?'</p>

<p>'War!' I shouted back. We could hardly make our voices heard.
'It's a Cambasian fleet! They'll be shelling the city soon.'</p>

<p>He cried back an utterly unprintable comment on the ancestry
of all the Cambasians. Then, 'I'll take this car to the Spit if
you men are game to come.'</p>

<p>We all began to scramble on board again. The tram started with
a jolt and raced toward Spit Junction. There was a pause in the
infernal racket of explosions. But it broke out again just as we
turned into Spit Road, but the tram sped on until just before we
reached Awaba street it stopped dead. The conductor who had gone
forward to the front of the car, called out.</p>

<p>'No good, gents, the overhead wires have been blasted
somewhere.'</p>

<p>I was down in a second and began running toward Stanton
street. Overhead something screeched and hooted, and I heard
another series of crashes toward Cremorne. Thick clouds of smoke
drifting up from Balmoral Heights rowelled me on. Panic-stricken
women and children were in the street or their gardens. There was
a little crowd staring blankly at the remains of a shattered
house that had been blown half across the road.</p>

<p>I scrambled over broken bricks and splintered fence and ran
on. I passed a score of people running towards me, but just as I
turned into Stanton street my arm was caught by a man whose face
was half masked with blood. For the moment I did not recognise
him. But when he called my name I knew it was Bob Hicks, the odd
job man who came to tidy up my garden every Saturday.</p>

<p>'Bob! What's happened? Are you hurt?' I gasped.</p>

<p>'Only a little bit, sir.' he replied. 'It looks worse than it
is.'</p>

<p>'My wife. Bob! Did she get away?' I pulled my arm from his
grasp and began to run.</p>

<p>He caught it again and held me.</p>

<p>'For Gord's sake Mr. Burton don't go to your house. Don't go!
you can't do any good.' he pleaded earnestly.</p>

<p>'My wife! Tell me!'</p>

<p>He stared at me and I knew what he was trying to say. 'Tell me
man! Tell me!' I shouted at him.</p>

<p>'She was just getting into the car. The third shell fell
between your house and Mackenzie's. For Gord's sake. Mr. Burton,
don't go there!'</p>

<p>But like a fool I did not heed him. and, tearing my arm away,
ran on.</p>

<h2><a id="ch4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<p class="first">IN our sorrows and tragedies we human beings are
individualists. We can never enter into the feelings of another,
neither can another enter ours. Each must sit alone in his own
little hell. When I began to write this story I intended to write
every truth, however ghastly. I wanted to burn the story into the
minds of all who read it; but when it comes to my own tragedy I
have not the courage even alter nine years, to go on. Even as I
reached my home three pale and shaking friends tried to stop me.
I will only say this about it:</p>

<p>What was there could not be covered decently from human sight,
and when I saw what was there I became sick. It was only one of
the thousands of similar tragedies of that day. Some infinitely
worse. But in all the days that have passed since then&mdash;more
than 3,000 days&mdash;those few moments of that day have been
with me. their memory if indelible, and that is my curse.</p>

<p>However, I have neither the inclination nor the need to dwell
on that one incident&mdash;a trifling incident of that day. When
the first shock of the blow passed, with its stunned
bewilderment, there came on me an urge for action. To stay near
the spot was impossible.</p>

<p>I put aside the offers of a home from friends, whose manifold
anxieties were as heavy on them as my own tragedy. I determined
to make back to the office. It was at this time about a quarter
to one o'clock. I walked to the Spit road to try to find means by
which to get back to the city. In the mood I was in the thought
of danger was not even remotely present.</p>

<p>When I reached the intersection of Stanton street I paused.
The confusion was at its height. There most have been thirty
blazing homes in sight, and the thick black smoke was . billowing
up all round. Then I looked back. Out through the Heads and,
about three miles off shore, steering north over still blue
water, was a long line of great, squat, grey ships.</p>

<p class="caption">
Out through the Heads, steering north over still blue<br>
water, was a long line of great, squat, grey ships.</p>
</div>
<br>



<p>Here I must pause to explain what we only knew later. The
first attack had been made by a squadron of ten cruisers, which
directed part of their 6-inch gun fire on the thickly housed
portions of the North Shore. Here Mosman and Cremorne had
suffered more than Balmoral, where not more than 50 shells had
fallen. In addition. the whole of Manly isthmus had been
devastated.</p>

<p>Bad as this, was, it was slight compared with the appalling
havoc that swept over Woollahra and Paddington on the south side,
where the thickly packed houses were plastered with flying death.
There is no doubt that incendiary shells were being used, for
scores of fires were blazing over the whole district, and there
was no hope of checking them, for the reservoirs of the high-
level water system wore emptied within an hour.</p>

<p>What I saw passing toward the north was the main battle-
fleet&mdash; moving unhindered from shore or air. Of the ten, six
were 45,000-ton monsters&mdash;the first proof we had of the
truth of the rumours that they were being built in defiance of
the Washington Treaty. I stood watching the grim turreted
monsters, fascinated. They were stripped bare for battle,. and
even at the distance I could see their hooded batteries were all
swung outward. At the bow of each was a low white line of
foam.</p>

<p>How long I stared I. do not know. Probably it was only a few
minutes before suddenly the whole line was momentarily hidden by
a billowing, black, thundercloud of smoke that burst from each
broadside. Then came the deafening detonation of that fleet
salvo. There was an appreciable pause before I heard the echoes,
of the explosion of the shells come in booming, from the city. I
did not realise it then, but at the moment nearly 100 16-inch
shells had swept from the sky and burst in the heart of the
crowded city. The smoke of the salvo had cleared almost
immediately, though a dim mist veiled the grey hulls.</p>

<p>Then the ships began independent firing by turrets. Why? Later
that day I knew. In the midst of the horror that had been the
city I came on a bluejacket from the Canberra. He had been on
shore leave.</p>

<p>Said he, 'Believe me, mister, the cows had someone ashore
spotting for them. I was down at Port Macquarie waiting to go
off, and you could see them feeling for the <i>Canberra</i> till
they got her. They couldn't have done it any other way. And when
they found her they smothered her with heavy stuff. She'd dropped
her mooring and was under way, but they got her, all the same.
She didn't have a dog's show. Something must have got one of the
magazines. The explosion sat me back hard on the pavement.'</p>
<br>

<p class="footnote">[Burton's bluejacket was right in his guess.
Marsden in his <i>Australian Tragedy</i> has it on the authority
of the naval officers of the Paramount Power that they had more
than 50 fixed and portable wireless stations on shore in
communication with their fleet. The portable stations were on
covered motor-lorries, which kept to the high ground overlooking
the harbour and city. These spotted for the gunners and directed
the fire. In the chaos that reigned on September 23 there was no
risk attaching to these agents. These wireless stations were
never really wrecked, though most of them were detected and
destroyed eventually. But until the end of the naval arm was kept
fully informed of troop movements. These stations account for the
frightful accuracy of the fire on 'Bloody Saturday' and for the
irreparable damage that was done. &mdash;Eds.]</p>

<p><br> As I stood watching, a car pulled up beside me. In it was
a man I knew well. Jeff Gage. He sprang out. He was almost
incoherent from anxiety. He had just reached home to learn that
his wife and two daughters had gone into the city, I warned him
that the chance of getting through was slight, but that I would
gladly go with him. Gage had, apparently, not heard of my loss,
and was too preoccupied with his own trouble to notice my own
silence.</p>

<p>It was a nightmare drive. Behind us all the time we heard the
crash of the great guns from the sea. which were echoed by the
explosion of the shells in the city, from which dense smoke was
rising. We went by back streets, as the tramline was practically
impassable.</p>

<p>Eventually when we reached the Pacific Highway and tried to
turn south to the Harbour bridge we found of outward-bound motor
traffic, frantic with haste, which would stop for no man. We had
to leave the car and move on foot as best we could, the road
blocked by a dense volume. It was a risky walk because in their
panic the cars were taking the footpaths. No man stopped for word
with his fellows. Near Mount street we came on a solitary
policeman who was seeing more traffic violations in a minute than
he had seen before In his life. But he was sticking to his post.
He warned us that we were mad to go on, and that the city was in
ruins. So far as he knew the bridge had not been hit, or the road
traffic would have stopped. He told us he had tried to get news
by telephone but could tell us of nothing but what passed before
his eyes.</p>

<p>By this time Gage was almost frantic with anxiety. My attempts
to try and reassure him that his people might have already got
away were useless. Suddenly the motor traffic thinned out.</p>

<p>It was only then we noticed what should have attracted our
attention before. There were no people on foot coming from the
city. We hurried on towards the bridge. As we approached we could
see that it was still intact. The firing had died down. It had
taken us nearly an hour to cover the mile from where we left the
car to the bridge head. It was absolutely deserted.</p>

<p>When between running and trotting we were half way across we
saw the reason for the desertion. A shell probably intended for
the bridge itself, had completely wrecked the steel approach
between the pylons and the causeway. Beside the wreckage a block
of buildings in Lower Fort street was burning furiously. Behind,
vast clouds of smoke were rising above the city, and were
blotting out the sun.</p>

<p class="caption">
A shell had completely wrecked the steel<br>

</div>
<br>

<p>When we reached the spot the spectacle was sickening. Among
the wreckage and beyond on the unbroken bridge, were remains of
motor-cars and humanity that had been caught by the blast of the
explosion. We were able, however, to crawl down among the broken
decking and reach the ground near the Mining Museum, where George
street turns under the bridge. Here we paused to discuss our
plans.</p>

<p>I had no heart for anything. To me, even the destruction in
the city was at the moment a lesser event than my own grief. I
was ready to fall in with anything Gage wished, to take my mind
off my own troubles.</p>

<p>Finally we decided to try to reach the town hall, where
perhaps there might be some kind of organisation. I looked at my
watch, and it was then ten minutes past three; but it seemed
three days since I had parted from Don Ringfield. From where we
stood, except for the wreckage behind us, there was no sign of
the effect of the bombardment; the thick smoke that overhung the
city hid everything.</p>

<p>Just as we turned to go we were halted by the sound of planes
racing towards us. Turning, we saw them in wedge formation of
five. There were five of them, flying at not more than 2,000 ft.,
as though to show their contempt. I don't think Gage knew he was
shaking his fist at them and cursing them. From somewhere came a
clear bark of a gun. and we saw the burst of a shell among them.
That was the first shot of defence that had been fired. There
were a dozen or fifteen bursts, very close, but the planes were
passing almost overhead before the smoke of the shells drifted
away.</p>

<p>We turned and hurried towards the city. We had not none 200
yards when we heard the crash of explosions behind us.</p>

<p>'They're after Cockatoo Dock,' gasped Gage. But we knew later
they had other targets. They were bombing the great fuel tanks
belonging to the oil companies on Ballast Point and Berry's
Bay.</p>

<p>Again and again came the crash of their devastation that
turned the harbour beyond the bridge into an inferno, as
thousands of gallons of flaming oil spread from the wrecked tanks
over the water, and blotted out land and water alike under
rolling masses of black smoke. The desertion of the street was
its strangest feature. Four trams stood in a line, empty,
opposite the Mining Museum. It was not until we reached the
intersection of Harrington street that we encountered a human
being.</p>

<p>Here a well-dressed man stood beside a car in which was a
young woman, evidently in a slate of collapse. With him were a
dozen men. apparently labourers. They were talking in low voices
as we joined them. One was saying. 'But where are our fighting
planes, even if they have knocked cut the guns?'</p>

<p>They took little or no notice of our arrival. Gage asked if
the way were open towards the town hall. One of them said:"You
might get as far as Grosvenor street, boss, but unless you're
thinking of suicide you won't go any farther.'</p>

<p>The car owner put in. 'I've tried every way, and they're all
blocked.'</p>

<p>'Are the ferries running?' I asked.</p>

<p>One of the men spat and laughed shortly. 'There's nothing
running in Sydney but the people who had the luck to get while
the going was good: and I'll bet they're running yet.' Then he
added, 'Wish I'd the luck to be with them.'</p>

<p>While we were speaking the planes came overhead again through
the smoke. They made over towards Double Bay, evidently to avoid
the anti-aircraft gun. In a minute or two they were invisible in
the smoke towards Bondi.</p>

<p>'What about Macquarie street?' asked Gage.</p>

<p>The car owner looked over his shoulder at the moaning figure
huddled in the back seat.</p>

<p>'I tried that,' he said in a low voice. 'Thousands of people
made out of the side streets into the Botanic Gardens and the
Domain. Twenty or thirty of the big shells burst over and among
them.' He passed his hand over his eyes. 'It's a shambles. God!
It's awful! They are spread out in masses, and the injured are
shrieking. The Mitchell Library and Parliament House escaped, but
one wing of the hospital is down, and the State Insurance
building and the Law Courts are flat There isn't a building
standing on the north side of the street.'</p>

<p>Gage turned to me.</p>

<p>'I'm going to try for the Town Hall by way of Clarence street;
we might get through.'</p>

<p>I nodded. It was a matter of indifference to me. One of the
men called out as we turned away.</p>

<p>'You're a pair of lunatics. You won't get through.'</p>

<p>We hurried along Harrington street, meeting only a few people
who scuttled by and took no notice of us. As we went the smoke
grew denser. As we reached Wynyard Station and turned up to York
street we could see it ablaze from end to end. People lying on
the pavement by St. Phillip's Church cried to us for help, but we
pressed on.</p>

<p>Gage's had been a good guess. Clarence street seemed clear,
but it was a mad Journey. Between Barrack street and Market
street there were burning buildings on both sides and we were
almost suffocated by smoke. Three times we had to scramble over
piles of fallen masonry. Again and again we encountered what had
been human beings. At King street there had evidently been a
traffic jam, because a tangled mass, the remains of motor-cars
and trams, was still smouldering where a shell burst had hurled
them into a common chaos.</p>

<p>It took us a quarter of an hour to pass over the dreadful heap
of debris. And from the sounds we knew many people were still
alive and suffering among it. Gage's instinct served him well,
because a little after 4 o'clock we reached Druitt street to find
the Town Hall miraculously untouched. St. Andrews also seemed to
have escaped damage.</p>

<p>After the horrible experience of our journey the peace of the
town hall seemed too good to be true. In the vestibule there were
30 or 40 men in small groups. They were all talking quietly but
with intense earnestness. I left Gage to his own devices, for I
felt sure I could be of no help. Actually I heard later that he
had recovered his family two days afterward at Katoomba. From
what I heard in the following January I feel he would have been
happier if they had been among those lucky ones who were under
the ruins of the city.</p>

<p>In the little groups I recognised many a good man. I felt that
here would be the beginning of order from the chaos around.
Talking to a Supreme Court judge, who, was taking notes, was the
chief of police, who was smothered in dust, and had one hand tied
up in a handkerchief. There were lawyers, business men, and three
doctors of fame.</p>

<p>Turning, to my satisfaction, my eyes fell on Don Ringfield and
the Dinker. They, too, had seen me and left their group.</p>

<p>Don was about to make some jest but I think he read my face.
He got as far as 'Did you&mdash;?' and stopped awkwardly. I shook
my head.</p>

<p>'I was too late, Don.' I was able to keep my voice steady.
They looked at one another. 'They're&mdash;'</p>

<p>Everything was in the word the Dinker spoke.</p>

<p>'One of the first shells,' I replied. '</p>

<p>Thank goodness they understood, and did not try to say
anything. The hands they gave me were enough. By a common consent
we turned from the subject.</p>

<p>'How about the office?' I asked.</p>

<p>The Dinker summoned up a twisted grin. 'Our jobs and the
office vanished together. Don and I missed vanishing with them by
a cat's whisker.'</p>

<p>'It must have been hell!' I commented.</p>

<p>'Wally,' said Don, 'I don't know what you've seen, but just
before the first salvo arrived the streets were a packed mass of
milling, panic-stricken people mixed up with the motor and tram
traffic. And then it seemed as though a hundred earthquakes
struck in.'</p>

<p>'They didn't fall straight,' Dinker explained. 'They came at
an angle and mostly burst low down, throwing the walls out on the
struggling mass of human life.'</p>

<p>'How on earth did you escape?' I asked.</p>

<p>'That was The Dinker's inspiration,' Don answered. 'We were
dodging walls and trying to keep our feet, when we came to where
the Mayfair Theatre had been. Dink said they didn't hit twice in
the same place, and we went and sat on a hill of wreckage till it
stopped.'</p>

<p>'Did you know Mosman and Darlinghurst and Paddington are
blazing?' I asked.</p>

<p>The Dinker nodded. 'We just heard, but there is worse than
that,' he added.</p>

<p>'How worse?' I demanded. 'It's been a hellishly clever job.
The Richmond aerodrome was washed up with time bombs just as the
Hawkesbury bridge was, about 5 o'clock. There is only one plane
left fit for service. All the water is cut off from the Prospect
reservoir, and the entire sewerage service is out of
commission.'</p>

<p>'And one of the first things they did was to scupper the
Bunnerenong electricity works. Blew it to a scrap heap in 10
minutes,' added Don. 'Mason, the Chief Secretary, was telling us,
too, that at Canberra they're in no end of a stew because since
last night they can get no communication of any kind either from
Western Australia or Darwin.'</p>

<p>'Any news from outside?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Nothing, so we hear,' Don said. 'Great Scott! We seem to be
mopped up without a hit back.'</p>

<p>We stared at one another helplessly.</p>

<p>In reply to my question The Dinker told me that the Lord Mayor
and the Premier were in conference on some plan to organise Red
Cross work and paid for the homeless: There must be thousands of
injured here and in the suburbs untended. Then there would also
be the necessity of recovering bodies and preventing looting.</p>

<p>'There is some form of sanitary system to be organised, or
we'll have the place rotten with disease,' he added. Here Mason
passed again, and told Dink that Melbourne was untouched and that
the R.A.F. from Point Cook was on its way here.</p>

<p>'Well,' I said, 'I came to offer for any job as long as its
work&mdash; sanitary if they like.'</p>

<p>'We're with you, Wally. let's hang round till something
starts.'</p>

<p>Almost at the same moment the building shook to the crash of
an explosion, and the shelling recommenced.</p> <hr>

<h2><a id="ch5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<p class="first">FOR than half an hour, for the second time that day, destruction swept across the doomed city.</p>

<p>This time only four of the battle-ships and six cruisers
participated, the others had disappeared. The fire was deliberate
and purposeful. Comparatively few shells fell in the already
ruined area. But the district round the Central Station, and
Redfern, Petersham, and, farther back, Balmain, were drenched
with fire by the heavy guns. To the east the still undamaged
areas both north and south of the harbour were being pelted by
the cruisers. With systematic deviltry every heavily populated
area was picked out in turn. When by half-past five the firing
ceased practically all of the inner residential and industrial
districts were a blazing desolation.</p>

<p>We heard no other sound of war that day until just about
sunset, when the rumble of a great explosion far to seaward came
to our ears.</p>

<p>We did not learn until long afterwards that it was the last
salute to a very gallant gentleman who had sold his life at a
price the enemy could ill-afford to pay&mdash;but they paid
it.</p>

<p>So far I have told the story as it appeared to me only. The
rest we learned piecemeal over several days. It must be
remembered that on the afternoon of September 23, for the time
being, in the chaos that reigned, Sydney was completely isolated.
Every form of communication had been destroyed, and even had it
not been, there were few in the city who had thought for anything
but their own safety. Refugees in thousands who had escaped along
the main highways had spread a story so terrible that at first it
was thought to be the outcome of hysterical panic. Wild as it
sounded, however, in the various State capitals, it was far short
of the truth.</p>

<p>The Federal Parliament was in recess, and the only member of
the Cabinet in residence in Canberra was the Prime Minister. That
morning at 6 o'clock he had been aroused to read two cable
messages that had arrived within ten minutes of one another. One,
from London, conveyed the startling notice that an unprovoked air
and naval attack had been made on Britain without a formal
declaration of war by three great Powers. The second was a
mutilated wireless message from Singapore, but there was
sufficient in it to convey the ominous warning that the British
Pacific naval force had suffered a serious reverse from an
unheralded attack.</p>

<p>Knowing that several of the Ministers were in Melbourne, the
Prime Minister acted promptly. Leaving his secretary to
communicate by telephone immediately with the heads of the
Defence force and the members of the Cabinet to meet him in
Melbourne, he ordered a plane to be in readiness for him, and by
7 o'clock was on his way south. It was not until after he left
that the serious news of the destruction of the Air Force hangars
at Richmond had reached Canberra.</p>

<p>By some unaccountable delay the reports of the destruction of
the Sydney water supply and the railway bridge at Hawkesbury did
not reach Melbourne until nearly midday. These had been forwarded
at the moment the State Government had received news that a state
of war existed. In Melbourne the responsible authorities had
acted promptly by anticipating the Cabinet's instruction by
telegraphing warning of probable mobilisation orders to all
military centres. These had been sent out by half-past nine. The
news had actually been broadcast from some stations in Melbourne
by 10.30.</p>

<p>Meanwhile attempts to get into contact with Singapore by
wireless had been only partially successful. It was not until 2
p.m. that the full extent of the naval disaster in the East was
known. The tidings drove home to the Government the fact that
Australia must stand alone. Still, in those early hours, it had
not entered any mind that there would be no period of grace, and
that the hour of trial had already struck.</p>

<p>Reports from the Postal Department and from wireless stations
that all communications from the west had ceased caused surprise
and annoyance, but no apprehension. No one dreamed that by
daylight that morning Western Australia had ceased to be part of
the Commonwealth and was in the hands of an alien race.</p>

<p>But while in Melbourne the various councils of Defence,
Supply, Transport and Communications were working with feverish
energy to bring their emergency regulations into effect, they had
been overwhelmed by the news from Sydney. We did not recognise at
the time, though the military authorities suspected the truth,
that the plan of the enemy was one of ruthless terrorism of the
eastern States to prevent any possibility of interference of
their initial occupation of the west, that they were determined
was to be permanent.</p>

<p>The wrecking of Sydney was but the first step in this policy
of frightfulness. designed to paralyse our organisation and to
obliterate as far as possible our essential defence industries.
How complete was the knowledge of our weak points both in defence
and industry was revealed by the coldblooded thoroughness with
which the enemy went about their work of devastation. Their aim
was to cow Australia by ruthless slaughter and destruction. They
relied on the shock of the surprise of the first stunning blow on
Sydney to carry it out, without serious opposition.</p>

<p>That night, as far as Ashfield in the west, Willoughby to the
north, and Marrickville to the south, the more important key
positions had received especial attention. One cruiser had stood
off Long Bay and systematically pounded the electric power plant
at Bunnerenong to a scrap heap across the headland. In the second
air attack at 3 o'clock the only electric plant left, that at
White Bay, was one objective which was fortunately missed by
three bombs.</p>

<p>It must have been the only failure of the attack, because the
three great oil fuel storage plants, the coaling station at
Ball's Head, and the wharves at Darling Harbour, with the Pyrmont
Bridge, were showered with incendiary bombs. During the second
bombardment the Cockatoo Island yard was struck repeatedly by 16
inch shells, and there can be no doubt but that this fire was
directed by an enemy agent ashore; as was that on the
<i>Canberra</i>, and on the city generally in the earlier
attack.</p>

<p>it was from Don Ringfield and others I heard of the scenes in
the city during the first attack. It must have been within a. few
minutes after I left for Balmoral that the stampede from the city
began, through the insistent warnings that were broadcast. Shops
and offices emptied their staffs and customers into the street in
panic stricken mobs. All sense and decency were lost in the wild
rush for trams, cars, and the underground railway.</p>

<p>As early as this the police made some attempt to stop all
inward traffic. Trams were stormed and men risked death by
climbing on the roofs. To every outward tram, people clung like
swarms of bees. The weaker were dragged off by the stronger. In
less than a quarter of an hour the whole traffic system was in
chaos. Motor owners took all comers who could find room, even on
the car bonnets, but the pace was slow, because of the milling
panic-stricken crowds, each unit of which was striving for his
own course, regardless of others. Hundreds of cars and trams must
have got clear before the blow fell. The Parramatta road was one
dense stream of cars.</p>

<p>But the streets were still crowded by a shouting, struggling
throng when the first salvo swooped into the heart of the city,
filling the narrow streets with crashing masonry and blasting the
lives from thousands. One horror was in the underground stations.
At Wynyard a shell crashed through the vestibule that was packed
with humanity.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Others crowded in the tunnels stampeded. The lights went out
and the horror went on in the dark where the fallen were trampled
to death. Similar scenes took place at the Town Hall station.
Then to add to the terror fires broke cut in a hundred places. By
night in the space of a mile and a half between Circular Quay and
the Central Station, and the half-mile between the Domain and
Sussex street, more than 60 per cent of the buildings were
destroyed while all the streets were in flames.</p>

<p>Conditions in the densely populated areas from Bondi into the
city were infinitely worse. In an area of five miles long by two
miles deep the fire of the attackers had been especially
concentrated. In this space there are normally more than 350,000
inhabitants. It was not until days after that any conception of
the toll of death could be formed. On the North Shore conditions
were almost as bad The inhuman ferocity of the policy of
frightfulness was being carried out to the letter.</p>

<p>It will be seen, then, that with the whole population of the
city either dead, injured, or panic stricken, with all form of
transport and communication shattered, and with all civil
authority either completely disorganised or non-existent, the
council at the Town Hall was faced with an appalling task , and
responsibility. Every man, woman, and child who could fly from
the stricken area had gone into camp in the national parks and
other outlying districts, where their food and control presented
another pressing problem.</p>

<p>At the moment, too, there was not the remotest knowledge of
the extent of the catastrophe or its needs. It was not until 9
o'clock that night that the Lord Mayor had been able to give the
authorities in Melbourne some rough idea of our requirements.
There must, then, have been more than 100,000 injured demanding
immediate attention, and there were only three doctors available
at the moment.</p>

<p>The Dinker, Don, and I found an Italian restaurant still doing
business in one of the few unsmashed areas. I had only then
realised my hunger. Antonio demanded 10/- each for 2/- worth of
food. We gave him 6/- and Don gave him his left in the jaw. He
probably would have received more in the jaw and less in his
pocket had we thoroughly understood the international
situation.</p>

<p>When we returned to the town halt we found the number o
volunteers had grown. More than a dozen more doctors had
appeared, and a temporary hospital was formed at St. Andrew's. I,
with others, was drafted to the Domain as a stretcher-bearer.</p>

<p>God forbid that I should ever see another such night. The
nurses in the hospital had stuck to their posts, and had with
such medical help as was available, been giving first aid to the
numbered the living by five to one. I do not excuse myself but
until then I had completely forgotten the existence of my sister
Lynda, who was one of the nurses.</p>

<p>There was no need for lights, for flames for miles around made
the place as bright almost as day. They had formed an emergency
hospital in Parliament House, and here a group of doctors, mostly
young, were carrying out heroic and desperate work. The Domain
had been crowded with hordes of panic-stricken refugees when a
broadside of shells burst over it.</p>

<p>The only advantage I gained from this, and the days that
followed, was that they hardened my mind and steeled my nerves
for things I did later when the chance came. To be merciful we
had to be merciless. Only those who showed hope for recovery were
removed from the ground. For the others there was only morphia to
quieten their agony. But they were so many and we helpers so few.
One had only to experience having to pass by a mother, forgetting
her own torture to plead for our help for a broken child, to
understand the hate that took root in those hours.</p>

<p>It was somewhere towards morning that while making one of my
endless rounds with an empty stretcher that had become sodden
with blood heard a woman's voice call my name from the shadow of
a tree, and I found Lynda. She had been working in that hell of
pain since 1 o'clock. With her was a loosely knit angular Scot,
with a tow head and a beaky nose. He was acting as her volunteer
dresser and orderly, and he told me his name was Fergus
Graham.</p>

<br>

<p>They say marriages are made in Heaven. If that be so Heaven
takes some queer means to bring them about. Fergus told me later
that he was pinned down by a motor-car that was on fire, but was
otherwise unhurt. Lynda had found him in Macquarie street, and
had levered up the car enough for him to drag himself clear. My
co-bearer, a young student, went mad during the night and tried
to strangle me. I had; to quieten him with a slat from a seat
that was handy. l didn't blame him for losing his reason. I must
have been pretty near to it myself. We were seeing things and
doing, things that were not meant for men to see or do. I was
annoyed, though, at the manifestation of his complaint.</p>

<p>Thereafter, for the two days following, Fergus was my fellow
stretcher-bearer. It was during those two days I learned to know
him. It was not until the Monday night that we had our first
spell. Then nature took charge: We both went to sleep beside the
stretcher somewhere near the remains of the Commonwealth Bank.
The military took over the ruins next day. But by then there were
no more living among them. They had either been removed or
not&mdash; mostly not.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<p class="first">IT was about time some strong authority had
taken over. While many people returned to help, those ghouls that
infest every community also put in an appearance, robbing the
dead and looting. Some worked in groups, and there were some
unclean episodes when they were interfered with. Lives had been
lost on both sides. Had I been told on the Friday that on Monday
I should kill a man with a brick and feel better for it, I should
have regarded the suggestion as more improbable even than
libellous. Yet on three occasions on the Monday Fergus and I came
on isolated vermin, red-handed. It was dirty work, but we did not
hesitate. Fergus proved to be a purposeful man with his hands.
Our efforts at summary justice seemed both natural one quite in
order. I remember well how pleased we were to guide a young
officer in charge of a squad of men to where we knew a gang of
the brutes was working. I do not know what his orders were, but
when he had rounded them up the proceeding were wholly informal,
but entirely satisfactory from our point of view. We found them
in the remains of a lane off Pitt street. There must have been
20,000 of jewellery in their clothes that the sergeant collected
before the final ceremony.</p>

<p>The coming of the military power, with martial law to back it,
ended that first phase so far as Fergus and I were concerned. It
also brought order where chaos had reigned. During Sunday and
Monday rumours of fantastic dimension had been rife. During that
time we had not slept, unless we slept on our feet. The only
pause in our heartbreaking job was to snatch meals that some
splendid women had prepared for the Red Cross workers. We were
too weary and too indifferent to trouble about news. There were
no newspapers anyway.</p>

<p>It was not until the Tuesday morning that I saw a Melbourne
newspaper at the town hall and learned of the catastrophes in the
interval. It appears that after the first bombardment of Sydney
the enemy fleet had divided, leaving a force outside Sydney
Harbour sufficient to hold our naval units there. One squadron
had gone north with one of two aircraft carriers.</p>

<p>Newcastle had been warned, and Fort Scratchley was on the
alert. There was no surprise, therefore, when about 5 o'clock in
the afternoon the roar of approaching bombing planes came in from
the east. Then followed the first real fighting. One squadron of
Air Force planes from Brisbane took on the overwhelming number of
the attacking force, while the second dashed to attack the fleet
that lay in waiting some 15 miles out to sea. This move drew off
part of the attack, and the anti-aircraft guns of the fort got
their chance.</p>

<p>It was a hopeless fight against numbers. Between the aircraft
and the guns they accounted for 11 enemy planes. But only two
units from our two squadrons returned after discharging their
bombs and exhausting their machine-gun ammunition. The fort, that
had got the range of the fleet, began firing, and the fleet
responded. But with the air opposition gone, the enemy planes,
aided by the fire from the sea, smothered the fort with high
explosive shells and gas. In less than twenty minutes from the
first shot it was over, and the grim fleet stood in towards the
shore. But there was one cruiser missing. That was the only loss
admitted by the enemy, though one of the battle-ships was
damaged.</p>

<p>Then, as night began to fall, there took place a repetition of
the disaster at Sydney. The fleet stood off some five miles from
Nobby's Head, and began a slow, deliberate fire with but one
objective&mdash;the Broken Hill Proprietary's great steelworks
and those adjoining. For half an hour 16, 12, and 6 inch shells
crashed down on the doomed area. Recognising what was coming, the
management had withdrawn all men from the mills, so that the.
loss of life was nil. But by dark the plant that had cost
14.000,000 was not worth that many pence.</p>

<p>We in the camp here at Carrington know how effective that
bombardment had been. Four years later the Paramount Power put us
on to clean up the mess and salvage what was left before they re-
erected the mills. The only satisfaction we got out of it was in
hearing their engineers curse their Navy for the thoroughness of
the job. But at the time it meant that the second largest
steelworks in the British Empire was in ruins and
useless&mdash;the principal source of Australia's steel had
gone.</p>

<p>While the bombardment was going on four destroyers separated
from tho fleet and ran for Port Hunter. They turned into the
channel with the familiarity of a man entering his town house.
Then&mdash;it was an act of patriotic folly&mdash;the Newcastle
battalion of infantry began to rake the decks of the destroyers
with rifle fire and machine-gun fire from behind the King's Wharf
and the coal shoots on the waterfront. Swinging their guns
inshore the destroyers blazed into the town as they passed
farther into the basin for room to manoeuvre. Here raking the
wharf with machine-guns and the town with their 18 pounders, they
turned and ran the gauntlet again for the open sea.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later the planes were back again, and, aided
by the guns from the cruisers that had stood away to the north,
firing over the breakwater, they devastated the town and the
waterfront.</p>

<p>Dusk was falling as the destroyers returned&mdash;none saying
them nay. They took possession of a loaded oil tanker that had
arrived that morning and was lying close to The Dyke. The tanker
was evidently the reason for their incursion.</p>

<p>One remained in the fairway, the. second appeared to be
arranging for the destruction of two colliers, while the
remaining pair ranged up beside the tanker. Then retribution
overtook them. From somewhere near Adamstown a battery of field
artillery came into action, ranging on the destroyer in the
fairway, which was struck by four out of six shells. A second
salvo put her out of control, and as she drifted towards the
ferry wharf the second hastened to her aid and drew the entire
fire of the hidden battery, the observers for which were giving
the range to a yard.</p>

<p>Both vessels were replying at random, but the two working on
the tanker took no notice. The second destroyer ceased firing,
and bent all her energies on attempting to take the damaged
consort in tow. when with a roar that shook the burning town, she
blew up.</p>

<p>Even then the two at the tanker did not relinquish their
efforts. Their aim was to get it out under its own power, but
this was frustrated by the battery turning its guns on the three
vessels. A moment later the tanker was ablaze, and as one of the
destroyers shot from behind her, making for the channel, the
second could be seen making desperate efforts to release herself
from her now terrible charge.</p>

<p>Again the battery changed its target for that dashing to make
its escape. Luck favoured the fugitive, and in a few minutes it
disappeared in the dusk, followed by a savage but ineffectual
fire. Cascading flames from the tanker enveloped the last of the
three doomed invaders. Several men were seen to spring overboard,
but the ebbing tide drew them towards the entrance. Ten minutes
later she, too, blew up beside the tanker, with an eruption of
flame that deluged the wharves and harbour for hundreds of yards
round.</p>

<p>Next morning 17 survivors from the first destroyer
surrendered, and were saved from being lynched by an infuriated
people only by rigorous action by the military authorities. But
three destroyers and eleven fighting planes were a small price
for the raiders to pay for the irreparable damage they had
inflicted on the chief defence industry of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>I may say here that some of the first scrap steel we used in
the new works for the open hearth furnaces some six years later
was that taken from the wreck of the first destroyer, which sank
near Stockton Ferry.</p>

<p>That night not a light was shown on the Australian coast. All
shipping within range that had not been mopped up by the enemy
had been warned of the danger. But there was evidence of enemy
destroyers close inshore during the darkness, and that the fleet
still watched outside the Heads. Nevertheless the two divisions
must have changed stations, because by morning, it was the main
battle fleet, that appeared on the horizon off Port Kembla at
daylight.</p>

<p>That the attack would be made was recognised by the
authorities as inevitable. Without a gun to protect it, Kembla
was naked to the open sea. Along its front were placed the really
important non-ferrous metal works and the plant of the great
Australian steel works, second only to those of Newcastle. With
these out of the picture the Commonwealth's greatest sources of
munitions would be cut off.</p>

<p>At Illawarra Lake sea planes lay waiting, and at a temporary
aerodrome, a few miles behind the lake, a score of bombers had
taken up a position. Before dawn a seaplane reconnoitring
discovered the enemy fleet steaming slowly without lights some 20
miles from the shore and slightly to the north-east of the port.
The first advantage of surprise had been lost to the raiders. For
this reason they had stationed their plane carrier some 20 miles
to eastward.</p>

<p>Knowing their presence had been detected and that the sole
attack could come from the air, the fleet, in line ahead, made
full speed to come within range by daylight. The message from the
scout sent 30 aircraft ranging for elevation from the lake and
the aerodrome.</p>

<p>Doubtless the fleet had sent similar orders to its air
support, and at the same time the aircraft from the battle-ships
and cruisers took wing. In the growing light the air was
throbbing with the drone of propellers. Then the cruisers,
rushing shoreward in broken formation, picked up the headland and
opened fire. Almost simultaneously the battle in the air
began.</p>

<p>Evidently the ranges were being passed back to the battle-
ships which. through the hurricane of conflict above and the
explosion of bombs around them, turned their great guns
shoreward. Over and short at first, the earlier salvoes blasted
the town and harbour, but the growing light and shortening range
made the target a certain mark for the gunners. Volcanoes of
smoke and flame rose from among the buildings along the
waterfront and shattered the beautiful machinery of the non-
ferrous works on which so much depended. This was the source of
all copper and brass work for munitions, and of all our insulated
cable and telephone wires essential to field communication.</p>

<p>To the right a hurricane of destruction fell upon the steel
mills. With their main batteries and their anti-aircraft guns
blazing, and indifferent to turmoil of wings overhead, the
raiding fleet carried out its work of devastation. One cruiser
close inshore was sinking by the head, and a second was drifting
out of control enveloped in smoke. From the shore a light breeze
was carrying the thick black smoke to sea.</p>

<p>Plane after plane plunged downward from above, spinning behind
it a streak of flame and smoke as it crashed into the sea. A
blast of fire sprang from the bows of one of the battleships
where a bomb struck her. She turned out of the fight to the east.
Immediately afterward, in response to orders, the fleet turned
away at full speed for the east, while the destroyers emitted a
smoke screen that surrounded them. Before they left the
destroyers made desperate efforts to reach the burning cruiser,
but finally turned away after picking up the men who, evidently
by order, had abandoned her. Five minutes later her decks and
guns roared skyward, and when the smoke cleared the hull had
disappeared.</p>

<p>No doubt the explosion was deliberately caused to prevent her
from falling into our hands. It was small satisfaction to
Australia that 15 enemy aircraft and two cruisers had been the
price of the raid, at a loss of one seaplane and two bombers. The
real loss had been in the wrecked and chaotic mass that had been
an hour earlier among our most valuable essential
possessions.</p>

<p>Within 24 hours from the outbreak of the raid Sydney had been
devastated with appalling slaughter, and our three most important
industrial undertakings, on which so many others depended for
material, were obliterated. Relying on the surprise of a bolt
from the blue, the enemy had succeeded in striking a paralysing
blow. From that moment the Commonwealth had become something akin
to those garden spiders that are collected by wasps as food for
their larvae&mdash;with their nerve centres deadened, alive, but
incapable of escape.</p>

<p>It was our misfortune that our essential needs of metals and
fuel had been concentrated in a comparatively small area of the
great continent. Its seaboard was that stretch of 150 miles
between Newcastle in the north and Kiama in the south. It was
doubly vulnerable to attack, because the needs of settlement and
topography of the country caused railways and arterial roads to
run parallel with the coast, and because in scores of places
inviting beaches and sheltered harbours, difficult to protect,
attracted the attacker. Such an area demanded the protection of a
fleet strong enough to hold the coast from Cape York downward,
backed by a land force of comparatively equal strength.</p>

<p>That the enemy were thoroughly aware of the strategic
importance of the area was demonstrated by the foresight and
swiftness that marked that first day's raid. For years with
childish disingenuousness we had laid our weakness bare to all
comers. Guide books with copious details of roads and
communications of every kind were offered as a gift to save a
perspective invader the trouble of making his own maps. At the
same time air transport offered agreeable facilities for a more
thorough photographic survey. Our attackers were as well equipped
with the necessary topographical information as we ourselves
were. With a few exceptions the Press and Parliament had kept
them posted on details of armament. What had not been publicly
disclosed was evidently easy of access, as the first bombing
raids on the Sydney forts testified.</p>

<p>'They came in,' said one survivor, 'and picked out the
emplacements as though they were at home and had laid out the
batteries themselves.'</p>

<p>But while the enemy had been striking to stun temporarily the
country with shock, the fourth blow had also Been delivered. The
news spread that a landing in force had been effected at Port
Stephens early on the Monday morning. And that explained in part
what had happened to the Hawkesbury Bridge.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<p class="first">AS we absorbed this mass of ill tidings Fergus
rubbed a chin that bore three days growth of bristles&mdash;we
were an insanitary pair&mdash; and said thoughtfully, 'Mon, if
that yarn about the landing at Port Stephens is true we're
scuppered!'</p>

<p>'Let's hope it is just another lie,' I replied. 'Think of the
other fantastic yarns we've heard during the last two days. It's
impossible.'</p>

<p>He swept a dirty finger in the direction of the broken and
still smoking skyline and growled. 'Look at that, and then say
what's impossible. Yesterday and the day before that were
impossible&mdash; but they happened.'</p>

<p>Here let me say that the hand of the censor had&mdash;with
good cause&mdash; fallen heavily on all published news. While the
policy was sound in the public interest, it bred an amazing crop
of disquieting misinformation.</p>

<p>It was not until the Tuesday morning that I saw the first of
the Government proclamations posted. One announced that a State
of War existed between Australia and Cambasia. To me and those
people of Sydney who had come drifting back from various
directions, the announcement seemed somewhat superfluous. Another
called on all men between the ages of 18 and 40 years to register
themselves at the nearest military centre for training. There
were others announcing that the Government had taken over the
control and distribution of all food supplies. Also that it was
illegal and subject to serious penalties to ask a price for any
commodity higher than that ruling on Friday, September 22. I
smiled as I thought of the way we had forestalled that regulation
on the person of the restaurant keeper on the Saturday afternoon.
Another notice announced that all road transport vehicles and
their drivers had been compulsorily swept into military service.
Moreover, in order to conserve fuel, no owners of motorcars could
use them except by official licence. The cars of the offenders
were to be confiscated. An appeal was also made to men retired
from every description of business to return to work to relieve
younger men for other service. Another proclamation published
took over by the Government a long list of business undertakings
that would be carried on by their owners, under official
direction, for the public welfare.</p>

<p>It was, however, strange that in Sydney, the centre of the
catastrophe less was known of what was happening than in any
other places in the eastern States. Moreover, in the early days
we saw fewer men in uniform than anywhere else. The civic problem
was terrific. Water and sanitation had vanished over the greater
part of the metropolitan area, and all civic activities had been
dislocated. Estimates of the killed and wounded on the first day
amounted to more than 200,000. Probably another 200,000 had left
the city and were scattered in camps in outlying districts, or
were overcrowding the outer suburbs and complicating the
situation in a score of ways.</p>

<p>In the inner suburbs, however, there were the survivors of
those who had been unable to get away and who were still living
in the ruins of their houses&mdash;if any. There was practically
no form of transport except by water. The ferry service was
almost intact, but the problem of fuel was acute. The running
time had been cut down to one boat an hour on each route.</p>

<p>On the Sunday and Monday refugees began to trickle back,
intent on visiting their homes or endeavouring to learn the fate
of missing relatives and friends. It was strange how self-centred
people had become, and the situation seemed to bring out the best
or the worst in humanity. One of the finest aspects was the
response to the appeal for voluntary workers, and the self-
sacrifice entailed was the monopoly of no single stratum of
society, all being regardless of the repellent or harrowing
nature of the work.</p>

<p>One of the first tasks, and one that was imperative, was the
collection and the burial of the dead. Working gangs of 21
members each were formed, of whom one was chosen as leader. Each
gang was allotted a given area. That to which I was drafted
worked to the north of Oxford street, Paddington. So far as was
possible, the bearers identified the victims and gave the names
to the leader. It was a grim business that taxed the fortitude of
all concerned in it. Of our gang half were white collar
workers&mdash; among them a lawyer a dentist, and two business
men&mdash;but none shirked where there was every cause for
shirking. There was no possibility of formal burial, and wherever
vacant ground of any kind was available the bodies were laid in
trenches and covered in. Clergymen of any denomination, where
possible, read the burial service over the trench when it was
closed. It was not until long after, when I paid my first visit
to what had been my home, that I found, a grave in what had been
its garden. But I never learned to whom my thanks were due.</p>

<p>What occurred was that Sydney as a capital ceased to exist.
There was neither trade nor commerce to support it, nor were
there the means or the men to carry out the work of
reconstruction. Events which followed demanded the services of
every available man to preserve those intact places which we
still held. Moreover the enemy were determined that it should not
be rebuilt as a centre of possible resistance. It became the
practice of every warship that passed along the coast to fire a
salvo or two among the ruins. Today. as I write, the fallen
masonry still blocks the streets of the city, and blackened and
desolate ruins, inhabited by the few who care to take risk,
disfigure the once lovely slopes around the harbour. I believe
that but for the wrecked approach the great bridge still stands
intact&mdash;red with rust where the weather has worn away its
paint.</p>

<p>Sydney and its tragedy, terrible as it was, falls into the
background. We return once more to Bloody Saturday, when
Melbourne had temporarily become the centre of administration. In
view of the gravity of the news from London the Prime Minister's
first act had been to call the Federal Parliament into session at
Canberra. Nevertheless, the first Cabinet meeting, at which only
half a dozen Ministers were present, was held in Melbourne on his
arrival.</p>

<p>Before then, however, the news that Britain was at war had
spread consternation through the city. All business came to a
standstill. The Stock Exchange, to prevent a panic, did not open
for business. After a hastily summoned conference between the
State Premier and the Associated Banks all the banks that had
opened their doors at 10 o'clock closed them at 11 until the
Monday. It was perhaps as well that the public did not know at
once the full extent of the catastrophe. They were prepared for
it by rumour, and the truth only filtered through gradually.</p>

<p>The Federal Cabinet had scarcely assembled when the news was
telephoned through from the Premier of New South Wales of the
first raid on the forts. It was not until nearly 2 o'clock,
however, after numerous attempts had been made to communicate
with the defence authorities in Sydney, that the story of the
bombardment reached the Cabinet officially from the Navy office
at the Victoria Barracks, where it had been received from the
<i>Adelaide</i>.</p>

<p>At the time it was impossible for the Cabinet to gauge the
extent of he danger that threatened. Absence of communication
from Western Australia, at first regarded as a mishap, caused
growing anxiety as the day went on. Darwin also was deaf to all
tireless and telegraphic messages. But the news from Sydney with
which the city was now ringing warranted preparation for the
gravest emergencies.</p>

<p>The destruction of the Hawkesbury River bridge gave ominous
warning that enemy action was injected beyond Sydney, and that
Newcastle could be the only objective. Sydney, the natural source
of military assistance, had been snatched from their grasp.
Meanwhile two squadrons of bombers had been sent to reinforce the
fort. But then, as afterwards, the advantage of the initiative
was always with the enemy. They held undisputed control of the
coast, and struck where they pleased.</p>

<p>Although it came as a shock, the devastation at Newcastle on
the Saturday night, and of Port Kembla on the Sunday were
regarded as inevitable by the authorities in view of the
suddenness and the utterly unexpected strength of the attack.
Only one really bright note was struck on that grim day by the
certainty that the enemy had been crippled by the destruction of
one of their two aeroplane carriers. But during that day, and
until late on Sunday the defence authorities could obtain no
certain news of the actual strength of the enemy.</p>

<p>It was estimated, however, that 10 battle ships, 15 cruisers.
and more than 30 destroyers were raiding the coast. But, far out
to sea, waiting the orders to move in, stood a great fleet of
merchant transports, which, by daybreak on Monday morning,
appeared off Port Stephen. It was ascertained, also, that apart
from the battleship guard to prevent the remaining naval units
from leaving Port Jackson, a wide area round the Heads had been
mined during the night of the Saturday.</p>

<p>From one of my shack mates, Bob Turnbull, once a shipping
agent in Melbourne, but now a feeder of open hearth furnaces at
the works. I heard how Melbourne responded to the news. By 10
o'clock it was broadcast that Britain, which meant the Empire,
was at war. Special editions of the papers were on the streets at
the same time.</p>

<p>By half-past ten business of all kind, except in the banks,
had ceased. Some of the cooler heads, anticipating a financial
panic, got in early, and secured enough cash to carry them on.
But it was not until nearly 11, when the city really awoke to the
possibilities that things began to look ugly. Then only the
prompt action of the Government prevented a riot by closing the
banks until Monday. There was a lot of noise when the doors
closed, but the crowd behaved sensibly. Although the streets were
thronged, to much so that the wheeled traffic was almost at a
standstill, there was very little noise. There was tense but
suppressed excitement. Near the newspaper offices the streets
were impassable owing to the density of the crowds. But until
about half-past 12 o'clock there was no other news posted than
the Government's declaration of a state of war.</p>

<p>'I was standing at the intersection of Collins and Elizabeth
streets' said Bob, 'when I heard a sound that was something
between a growl and roar of voices from the crowd in Collins
street When it died away into a dead silence I saw the crowd
surging and people come rushing toward Elizabeth street. A man
running by stopped and called out. A fleet of bombing-planes had
attacked Sydney. That tore it! By Jove! if it had been over
Melbourne it could not have caused a greater sensation.'</p>

</div>
<br>

<p>During the next 15 minutes something like 300,000 people in
the city suddenly awoke to the reality of war. When the first
wave of excitement passed Melbourne went cold sober. There was no
cheering or shouting in the streets, nor very much in the hotels.
People just stood talking in subdued voices in small groups
everywhere. The shops closed and the crowd grew thicker.</p>

<p>'It was toward two o'clock, and many of the people were
beginning to drift toward the Flinders street station. A notice
was posted.</p> <br>

<p class="sign"> SYDNEY IS BEING HEAVILY BOMBARDED<BR> BY A FLEET
OF WARSHIPS FROM OUTSIDE<BR> THE HEADS. NATIONALITY
UNCERTAIN.</p>


<p><br>'After the first wave of sound you could have heard a pin
drop in Collins street,' Bob went on; 'then, as by word of
command, the crowd began Id break up and leave the city.'</p>

<p>'The football final was being played at the Melbourne Cricket-
ground that afternoon, but the question of which team could claim
the title to premiership was never settled. The only people who
turned up at the ground were two gatekeepers and about half a
dozen football reporters. No one had thought to call off the
match&mdash;it called itself off. By three o'clock the city was
almost deserted. The twelve picture theatres in the city could
not muster an audience of 50 people between them.</p>

<p>'I said that business had been paralysed, but there was one
place where there was too much to cope with, and that was at the
Victoria Barracks, in St. Hilda road,' Bob grinned. 'I thought I
might as well claim the honour of being one of the first to
enlist, so I strolled over Princes Bridge. Something like 60,000
or 70,000 others had got the same idea. The crowd of men had
backed up over the road and had overflowed into the Domain. The
barrack yard was as full as a tick, and about 50 permanent men in
uniform had been swallowed up among them in trying to get them
into order.</p>

<p>When I managed to squeeze my way through, an officer at one of
the windows was telling the crowd in parade-ground English to go
and register themselves at their suburban centres. He also told
them where else they could go. There must have been thousands of
old Diggers in the crowd. You could pick them out everywhere. It
was they who started singing 'Mademoiselle from Armentires.'
That crowd chanted the lay of 'Mademoiselle' for hours. Many of
them drifted off to other recruiting stations, but those who hung
on kept the barracks staff working all night.'</p>

<p>Bob got fed up of waiting about C o'clock, and went to his
home in North Brighton. It was only about that time that someone
at headquarters awoke to the fact that the broadcasting stations
had no censors and were sending out everything that came
through&mdash;and that was plenty. Refugees, from Sydney arid
newspaper men were sending, through their accounts of what they
had seen. At first people would not&mdash;could not&mdash;believe
it. But before the censors put on the brake. Melbourne knew that
Sydney had been pretty well wiped off the map. But even then they
had heard nothing of the second bombardment.</p>

<p>It was later that night that Bob Turnbull, by chance, was one
of the few people in the east to receive a whisper of what had
happened in Western Australia. After dinner he had gone across to
see his partner, whose son was a wireless amateur. It was about
10 o'clock when the son broke in on them wide-eyed, with a story
that he had been working on the amateur band and had picked up
some station working on a battery operated plant at a place
called Gumaling in Western Australia. He was morseing, and the
signals were very weak, but he had made out part of the message
and written it down. It ran:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">How many not known. To... swarms of soldiers in
streets by...machine-gunned the...no resistance at all...Complete
possession of Freemantle and Perth... motorists shot...cars
taken...Northam by midday...railway captured...since then no
message... cannot see, but think red dia&mdash;</p> <br>


<p>It faded out there, and the boy tried, but could not raise the
transmitting station again. Neither Bob nor his partner was
strong on Western Australian geography, but they took an atlas
and searched for 'Gumaling.' The only place they could find
approximating the word was 'Goomalling,' a junction station on
the northern line to Geraldton.</p>

<p>They guessed there was something in it, and after a hopeless
half hour trying lo get to headquarters by telephone they drove
to the barracks. Here, after an hour's wrangling, they finally
got hold of an intelligence officer who read the fragment and
hurried them into the presence of a brass hat, by whom they were
received with the usual military courtesy.</p>

<p>Bob said that on glancing over the paper the officer's first
outburst was to ask what the so-and-so such-and-such they meant
by being in possession of an unauthorised wireless set. (The
prohibition had not then been announced.) However, after warning
them not to repeat the story to anyone, he so far forgot himself
as to thank them, and admitted that message confirmed other
information they had.</p>

<p>Actually it was more than six months before an approximately
detailed story of what had happened that day in Western Australia
was pieced together. It came through in dribbles from scores of
underground sources, for the West was, from then, more isolated
than if it had been on another continent.</p>

<p>So far as I remember, the first full story from actual eye-
witnesses was told by two Roman Catholic priests. Fathers Collins
and Fairfax. They reached Port Lincoln in April, 1940, in the
last stages of exhaustion. It had taken them four months to cover
the journey from Esperance after their escape.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch8">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE story of the occupation of Western Australia
demonstrates fully the diabolic thoroughness of the preliminary
staff work that put the State into the enemy's hands almost
without a blow being struck. It would be possible only in a
country such as ours that remained persistently blind to the
writing on the wall.</p>

<p>During the nights of September 21 and 22 the wireless
authorities had had their attention directed to the transmission
of some unknown wireless station either in or close to Perth. The
signals were especially strong in the early hours of the morning,
but attempts to decipher, them were unsuccessful. Early in the
evening of the Friday direction-finders were used to locate the
station, but the line of direction crossed at a spot outside
Perth on an open road, it was assumed then that a portable set
was being used. Although the incident of the 'mystery station'
caused a good deal of comment in official quarters no
apprehension was created.</p>

<p>Doubtless this was one of the enemy sets transmitting vital
information to the expeditionary force at sea. Late that night
(Friday) a telegram addressed to the Premier was despatched from
Geraldton. It conveyed the information from the owner of a lugger
that had been lying inshore about 50 miles north of Geraldton
that he bad sighted a large fleet of ships, some of which were
undoubtedly cruisers, moving south. Adverse wind had delayed him,
and the message was nearly 16 hours late.</p>

<p>It never was delivered. One of the features of the invasion of
Western Australia was that it was planned so as to inflict the
least possible damage on property. Instead of adopting a plan
similar to that used In Sydney, and bombing the forts on Rottnest
Island, in broad daylight, a surprise attack on the forts at
midnight was arranged.</p>

<p>Towed in boats by destroyers, a large landing party gained a
footing on the island. The flashing light on the high ground must
have formed a perfect guide. The landing place was well chosen by
someone familiar with the whole island, as the movement was
carried cut without detection. When the forts were rushed,
scarcely a shot was fired by the garrison, who, taken completely
off their guard, were bayoneted to the last man.</p>

<p>In 10 minutes after the first alarm the island and its
batteries were in enemy hands. The next phase of the attack took
place shortly before dawn, when a series of violent explosions
shook the city. Every wireless plant had been put out of action.
Half a dozen masked men invaded the telephone exchanges and put
their staffs under arrest. At the same time all the telegraph
lines and cables had been cut. It was later discovered, too, that
rails had been removed during the night from every railway line
at various points outside the city area.</p>

<p>The explosions that destroyed the wireless stations had been
caused by powerful bombs, which did sufficient damage to put the
stations out of action for several days. No means of outside
communication had been overlooked. The uproar caused considerable
excitement in the city, but the perpetrators of the sabotage had
escaped. Their work was done.</p>

<p>In the meantime, warned that Rottnest. had been silenced, the
fleet had stood inshore. Convoyed by destroyers, some of the
troopships had closed in to the Cottesloe beach, where, under the
cover of darkness, debarkation began. Many people heard the
unaccustomed movement off shore, but none vas curious enough or
unfortunate enough to enquire closely.</p>

<p>Before daylight two battalions had landed and had assisted in
securing inshore a floating wharf that was towed in by short
sections. By the time day broke one battery of mechanised
artillery had been landed on pontoons, as well as two or three
swift light tanks. At the same time motor pinnaces armed with
six-pounders, and each towing four boatloads of infantry with a
machine-gun unit, were making for the mouth of the river.</p>

<p>By then the daylight was growing, and all appearance of
secrecy was abandoned. By this time any hope of resistance had
passed. While the troops from Cottesloe were moving into
Fremantle by road, two troopships steamed towards the wharves
guarded by destroyers. The astounded inhabitants of Fremantle
found the waterfront occupied by foreign troops, who took
immediate possession of the railway station. When attempts were
made to communicate with Perth it was found that all telephones
were dead. The pier heads were guarded by light tanks to prevent
interference with the berths of the troopships.</p>

<p>For a little while, the soldiers treated the staring civilian
population with contemptuous indifference. But that they were not
to be trifled with was dramatically shown when an officer
abruptly ordered the owner of a motor-car to alight and hand it
over. The man protested, and without a word of warning, was shot
dead at his wheel. At a word from the officer the door was flung
open by a soldier, and the body was dragged out and pushed into
the gutter.</p>

<p>Before 7 o'clock some five battalions of infantry had been
landed. By that time, too, a strange flotilla was making its way
up the Swan River. It consisted of six motor-pinnaces, each
towing four boats, each of which carried 50 men. By half-past
seven they had passed Mill Point from Melville Water and were
steering for the Barrack street jetty. These landed at 7.45, and
were actually the first troops to reach the city, but only, by a
few minutes, for two train loads arrived at Central station from
Fremantle before 8 o'clock.</p>

<p>It was one of the tragedies of the day that because of the
early hour several residents of Fremantle, who had dashed to the
city by motor-car, were unable to get into touch with anyone in
authority. So that though the news of the invasion had reached
the city it was known to comparatively few people , most of whom
were incredulous.</p>

<p>In some respects however, the misfortune was a blessing in
disguise. At the most only one hour would have been available to
organise any form of resistance. Bad as the situation was
eventually, the slight resistance that might have been organised
would assuredly have been useless, and would probably have led to
ruthless reprisals or a bombardment of the city. As it happened,
however, the early city workers suddenly found the streets
overrun with foreign troops, who moved with mechanical and
systematic certainty.</p>

<p>Father Fairfax stated that at a few minutes before 8 o'clock
he was walking down Barrack street towards St George's Terrace.
He had reached the town hall when he was staggered by the
spectacle of a body of troops coming toward him at the double
with bayonets fixed. Almost at the same moment there was a burst
of machine-gun fire at the intersection of St George's Terrace.
One company halted at the Hay street intersection close to him
and set up machine-guns. with which they began to rake the street
both east and west. The few who have recorded the events of the
morning emphasise the suddenness with which the city was invaded
and the callous savagery with which all opposition was crushed by
the streets being cleared by machine-gun fire in both directions
from Barrack street.</p>

<p>One of the very few men I met who was in Perth on the morning
of September 23 was one who owned a service station in the city.
If I ever heard his name I do not I recollect it now. That was
before I was drafted to the Carrington camp. He had come east as
chauffeur to, a Paramount Power officer. He told me that he had
gone down to his garage early that morning. The first he knew
that anything was wrong was when he heard shooting, and one of
the men ran in and told him someone was firing in the street. He
tried to ring the police station. At the same time he told me his
story it seemed funny in trying to call out the police that
morning, because they shot every man in uniform on sight.</p>

<p>What impressed him most was that at 8 o'clock everything
seemed normal, and 10 minutes later the city was fairly crawling
with the soldiers. They seemed to come from all directions. The
first he saw of them was when, looking through, the window of his
office, a sergeant and six men walked in. One of his men went up
to the sergeant and apparently began an argument, when the
sergeant pushed his bayonet into the man's chest. It was not 30
seconds between the time they walked through the door till the
sergeant was kicking the man's body aside. Then the sergeant
looked round and saw the owner in his office and walked in. He
spoke English, and asked how many cars in good condition were in
the place.</p>

<p>Told there were 25. He said, 'You show, me or I stick,' and
with the! object lesson of the body of his assistant before him
the owner complied. Just then an officer with a squad of men
joined the sergeant. They rap the ears out, and the garage owner
was forced to fill their petrol tanks. After that they drove the
cars away without taking any further notice of him. He told me
also that they seemed to know exactly where to go for everything
they wanted. Cars full of men were driven to the outlying
suburbs, and all roads leading out of Perth were guarded. Any
cars attempting to leave were stopped, and their owners were shot
down. All cars entering were commandeered.</p>

<p>So swiftly and methodically was the entire operation carried
into effect that by 9 o'clock the invaders were in complete
possession of the city. A population of more than 200,000 was
held in submission with practically no effort and had chance of
an effort at resistance.</p>

<p>Acting on pre-arranged plans, and guided no doubt by the
agents who had cleared the way for their coming, bodies of troops
took possession of all key positions and squares. Rail and tram
systems were held up and the Maylands airport was occupied. Every
motor-car available was commandeered. Those taken in the streets
were parked under guard in Stirling square. Later in the day a
systematic requisition was made, and owners were forced to drive
their cars to Hyde Park. A squad of enemy engineers took over the
electric power station and all wireless stations. During the day
domiciliary visits were made to all owners of amateur
experimental radio sets; and all material was either destroyed or
confiscated.</p>

<p>Before noon proclamations in English were posted throughout
the metropolitan area. These ordered that all firearms should be
surrendered by Placing them on the footpath in front of the home
of the owner. All motor vehicles not already commandeered were to
be driven to Hyde Park or Kings Park. All radio appliances for
either reception or transmission were to be placed outside homes
for destruction. It was also ordered that no citizen was to leave
the city. The penalty for any contravention of these orders was
death.</p>

<p>The same thoroughness of system marked the manner in which the
railways were used to consolidate the hold of the invaders.
During the morning troop trains left for all key junctions. The
movements of all incoming trains were provided for. The
perfection of the organisation was such that the first knowledge
that Kalgoorlie gained of the catastrophe was when on Sunday
morning a trainload of troops took possession of the city.</p>

<p>After the initial occupation of the key positions the work of
taking full possession of the State was continued with systematic
foresight. So carefully had the work been synchronised that a
cruiser and a troop train arrived at Albany within an hour of one
another Meanwhile, in Perth, troops continued to pour into the
city by rail, road, and water. One of the first actions by the
battalion that entered the city by the Barrack street jetty was
to march a company to Government House, where His Excellency who
had but five minutes earlier been informed of the invasion, was
placed under arrest.</p>

<p>The Premier was not in Perth at the time, and was not captured
until two days later. But the Mayor was taken from his home to
the Town Hall and ordered to find rations for the incoming
troops.</p>

<p>It was learned later that two divisions of troops with tanks
and mechanised artillery formed the invading force. So sure had
the invaders been of success and freedom from interference that
only four first-class cruisers convoyed the troopships.</p>

<p>After taking over all public buildings the troops that
remained in the city were quartered on the inhabitants. By night
from King's Park two batteries of artillery held the city at
their mercy. Male citizens were requisitioned without
discrimination of any kind to carry out the orders of the victors
in collecting the firearms throughout the city in motor-lorries
and for all laborious work.</p>

<p>At Fremantle pressed labour unloaded arms and munitions from
the troopships and transferred them to appointed dumps. After the
firing in the streets on the Saturday morning, by which the city
was cowed into submission the people suffered very little
violence for the first three weeks. Father Fairfax related. This
first morning cost about 800 lives. The invaders showed clearly
that they would not brook the slightest question of their orders.
Men who in the beginning exhibited the slightest sign of
hesitation or truculence in obedience were instantly shot or
bayoneted. Otherwise there was at first no great ill-treatment of
the conquered race.</p>

<p>It was not until the end of October that the people learned
the fate in store for them. By then the entire settled portion of
Western Australia was completely under enemy control. Hope for
rescue from outside Australia there was none. Rescue or help by
land over the Great Western line was equally impossible for men
and supplies, including water for an effective force was an
impossible undertaking. More so, since the enemy had established
a strong sir base at Kalgoorlie that would have rendered the use
of the line impracticable. The only hope of relief lay by sea
from the east, and the sea had passed from Australian
control.</p>

<p>The revelation of the invaders' plans for administration was
heralded by the arrival of a large body of civilian officials who
acted independently of the military body, but were directed by
the military governor of the State now installed in Government
House, that became eventually the terror of the populace; its
ruthlessness and arrogance were worse than that of the
soldiers.</p>

<p>The first inkling of their fate that came to the broken-
hearted people was. early in November, when all males over the
age of 12 years were t ordered to transfer themselves from the
north to the south side, of the river. Women from the south were
to cross the river to the north. The women were to cross the
river by the t causeway and the men by the railway bridge at East
Perth. No one was permitted to take any possession other than as
much clothing as he or she could carry.</p>

<p>It was the invaders' first stroke that showed the manner in
which, by the total segregation of the sexes, they had determined
to solve the racial problem. The order was forced into effect
with unrelenting thoroughness. No provision was made to house the
transferred people beyond the order that the dwellings should be
shared indiscriminately. The appalling act admitted no
discrimination. At the same time the policy was made effectual in
all rural areas.</p>

<p>Then began the drafting of the men into labour camps and
virtual slavery. All work of agriculture, mining, and laborious
public services was thrown on the vanquished people, who were
treated more as working cattle than human beings. The first
doomed thousand were taken by transport to the Yampi iron mines,
which became the most dreaded feature of a dread oppression.
Here, in the terrific heat and under cast-iron discipline and
unending toil men died like flies. Food and water were
inadequate, and sanitation in the camps did not exist. There was
no attempt at medical assistance, and the men were driven to
their tasks till they dropped. Eventually the toll of the mines
became such a drain on the manpower of the West that when the
invader made good his hold on the East the iron mines became the
punishment of all who offended the Paramount Power. They were the
lowest pit in the hell that was Australia.</p> <br>

<p class="footnote">[At this juncture some 2,000 words of
Burton's narrative relating to the treatment of the women are
omitted. Burton gives the source of his information as a
metallurgist and a friend of Fergus Graham, who had been
transferred to Newcastle from the West. We have been permitted to
compare the text with that of the suppressed passage in Peel and
Everard's <i>The Struggle for the Pacific</i>, and find the two
statements fully corroborative. We have made representations lo
the Government, suggesting the advisability of the destruction of
both documents n order to prevent any possibility of their
publication in the future. &mdash;Eds.]</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch9">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<p class="first">IN making this digression on the fate of the
lost State my desire has been to set out fully the situation that
the Federal Government was called upon to face during the first
three days from September 23 to 25. The few broken wireless
messages, such as that brought to them by my friend Turnbull,
warned the authorities that a major calamity had overwhelmed
Western Australia.</p>

<p>Sydney was in ruins and stories of destruction of Newcastle
and Port Kembla, added to the calamitous tidings, had thrown the
people into a condition bordering on panic. Then over all came
the report of the landing in force at Port Stephens, the extent
of which was at the moment unknown. Silence from Darwin added to
the list of misfortune the certain knowledge that it, too, the
gateway by air, was in the hands of the enemy. Messages from
Britain warned the Government that the heart of the Empire was
threatened, and that for some indefinite time there could be no
hope of assistance to regain control of the sea that had been
lost in the naval reverse at Singapore. Our own naval force was
bottled up in Sydney Harbour, and even had it been free, the
immense superiority of the enemy made its value negligible.</p>

<p>To the threat to our freedom is a race was a militia force
spread over the entire Commonwealth at a strength on paper of
35,000 men. From his had to be deducted all available n Western
Australia; and probably those in Queensland also. It was clear
that if the enemy made good its footing at Port Stephens an
effective use of help from Queensland units would be greatly
restricted if not entirely prevented. Even if the men were
available difficulties in maintaining contact and an adequate
supply of arms were almost insuperable.</p>

<p>Even in the first three days our small but precious air force
had suffered irreparable loss. Only one machine survived the
sabotage of the Richmond air force. And the loss at Port Kembla
and Newcastle had reduced the remainder by 14 effective machines.
The only bright spot in the otherwise unbroken gloom was the
knowledge of the enemy's loss of one of its two great plane
carriers. This was due to the splendid devotion of Squadron-
Leader James Garside.</p>

<p>In the consternation that reigned when the battered hangars
were examined after the early morning explosion at Richmond, the
certainly that the cause was foreign and not of local origin was
manifest. Later, while discussions on the situation were in
progress by telephone with headquarters, the first air raid on
the forts was reported. The necessity for preserving, as far as
possible, our fighting planes intact, decided headquarters not to
throw the plane away. One machine against such odds could effect
no damage, and its loss was certain.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that Garside submitted a use for the
plane and volunteered to carry it into effect. It was evident
from the strength of the air attack that one or more carriers
formed part of the enemy force. These were being kept well out to
sea for safety, being among the most vital and vulnerable of the
enemy's units.</p>

<p>Garside suggested that the heaviest blow that could be struck,
and one by which the defence would most greatly benefit, was the
destruction of one of these aircraft carriers. He, however,
pointed out that an attempt to bomb the carrier was uncertain of
success, and even a direct hit might do no more than cripple it
temporarily. He then offered to take the sole remaining machine
up with the maximum possible load of high explosives. With this
he should fly south toward Jervis Bay and then out to sea at low
altitude, only turning north when he was well behind any possible
enemy observation. Then, when finally he was able to sight the
fleet, to crash his plane on or against the aircraft carrier.</p>

<p>To gain such a result, the certainty of death, he claimed,
could not and must not, be considered for a moment. He put
forward his offer quietly, and in matter-of-fact tones as if it
had been a mere question of routine, and retired to await, the
decision. Finally headquarters accepted the sacrifice, and the
man least moved by the decision was Garside himself. In
conference with the commandant at the aerodrome the plan was
discussed in detail. It was decided that the plane should leave
Windsor so that its flight southward, seaward, and the turn north
should be completed at, as nearly as possible, after sunset. The
idea was that the plane flying in from the east would itself be
in a bad light while the enemy fleet would stand clear against
the light of the setting sun. Garside's own plan was that on
sighting the fleet he should fly low, barely above the water, in
order, if possible, to strike the hull of the carrier, just above
the water line, if possible amidships.</p>

<p>His contention was that the method of attack would be the
least likely to be expected and anticipated by the enemy. The
speed of the bomber would reduce the chance of an effective hit
to a minimum if they sighted him In, time to open fire. In the
final analysis the locality and position of the fleet, and
especially of the plane earlier, were unpredictable, and he,
therefore, must be free to act for the best results the situation
offered when he reached his objective.</p>

<p>That afternoon Garside took off with his load of destruction,
going to his death with a smile and a wave of the hand as if
starting on a routine peace flight. I have already told how,
about sunset on the Saturday evening a deep boom of an explosion
was heard in Sydney from far out to sea. At the time an anxious
croup of watchers on North Head saw a momentary blaze of light
from below the horizon that heralded a sound as though of
thunder, that came drifting across the water. As it reached their
ears the watchers rose to their feet facing seaward, silent and
at the salute. A man had died!</p> <br>

<p class="footnote">[On the authority of officers of the
Paramount Power, Marsden states that Garside's attack was so
sudden, and his method was so unexpected, that the enemy had no
time to guard against it. When they first heard its approach all
eyes were turned upward, but the bomber roared in on them from
the east almost invisible in the evening light, only a few feet
above the water. It charged in at a terrific speed and hit the
aircraft carrier just above the waterline almost amidships. The
ship blew up and sank instantly, carrying with it 100 planes and
all but three or four of its personnel. They admitted the
seriousness of the blow, but expressed warm admiration of the
self-sacrifice that effected it. &mdash;Eds.]</p>

<br>

<p><br> But the situation that faced the Government demanded
something more than individual heroism. By Monday morning there
was none in authority who did not recognise the grimness of the
task, owing to the extent to which those first blows had crippled
our resources and shaken the moral of the people. All plans for
defence were based on the supposition that the Commonwealth would
have had several week's warning of a probable outbreak of
hostilities. Not oven the lesson of the Austrian crisis early in
1938, when a declaration of war was hourly expected, had taught
the authorities the truth that war could break out overnight from
a clear sky. The one eventuality for which no provision had been
made was upon them.</p>

<p>At the very least, six weeks would be necessary to mobilise
and prepare troops to take the field even under the most
favourable conditions. Now with one State completely lost and
beyond help, and with the enemy in actual occupation of a
strategic post on the east coast, the call for action had come.
The call had not come to a country intact, and corporate, but to
a people shocked by major disasters, with a great centre of
population, and one vitally important, in ruins. The destruction
of Sydney had meant the disorganisation of plans that depended on
that city for men who had been slain, and for essential arms and
munitions that had been irreparably lost. The fleet had lost its
flagship with all its crew, and the remaining units were as
useless for action as if they had never existed.</p>

<p>The only branch of the defence force ready for action, the air
arm, though strong in personnel, was even at its best too weak
for the terrific task that had been thrust upon it. Plans for
bringing the strength of lighting planes up to an adequate number
had not been completed. In the first three days more than one
quarter of its effective strength had been lost. Despite the
destruction of one enemy aircraft carrier, the enemy had
sufficient fighting strength on the second to meet the Australian
Air Force on equal terms. But from Newcastle Waters first, and
then from Charleville, had come news of large flights of planes
bearing the red diamond on a black square. Of these 55 had been
sighted moving south-east. It was evident that the enemy was
being reinforced from Darwin for the losses it had sustained.</p>

<p>But of all the disasters, the news of the enemy's landing at
Port Stephens was that which caused the headquarters staff the
gravest concern&mdash;all the more because of the absence of
detail. The first report had been received in Melbourne on Monday
morning, September 25. It came from the postmaster at Karuah, at
the extreme north-west of the inlet. It announced that six enemy
destroyers had entered Port Stephens, the fleet with a large
number of transports, was close outside, and, after shelling
Nelson's Bay, men from the destroyers were landing. The terror-
stricken inhabitants were flying from the district. Then ensued
silence.</p>

<p>A small squadron of private planes, hastily organised at the
Mascot Aerodrome, was sent north. These were piloted by officers
from the Richmond Aerodrome, but not one returned. Later in the
day three Air Force Scouts departed on a similar mission of
reconnaissance. Shortly after they passed the Hawkesbury they
reported by wireless that they were being attacked by enemy
aircraft. That was their last message.</p>

<p>It was not until Tuesday morning about 3 o'clock, that more
definite news was received. It was telegraphed by a resident of
Port Stephens, Martin Hancock, a former major of the A.I.F. He
had succeeded in remaining hidden during the whole of Monday.
Knowing the fate of Newcastle, when the light keeper of Stephen's
Point had given the alarm that the fleet was approaching,
settlements round the port had been promptly evacuated. Most of
the refugees had made eastward to Morpeth or East and West
Maitland, where the news they brought spread panic.</p>

<p>Hancock reported that the troopships entered the Harbour after
it had been examined by destroyers and planes. Soldiers had also
been disembarked from the warships outside the heads by
destroyers. The troopships had anchored in Salamander Bay. In all
their movements the enemy seemed to be entirely familiar with the
locality. He believed that two brigades with mechanised artillery
were disembarked. Only four troopships had entered the harbour,
the rest, of which he counted 22, remained outside with the
fleet. During the whole operation at least two squadrons of
'planes were circling ever the port. Towards dusk, leaving one
cruiser outside and four troopships and three destroyers in the
harbour, the fleet had turned southward.</p>

<p>Hancock, who had left a motor-cycle at Salt Ash, succeeded in
passing through enemy posts along the Anna Bay road. He did not
reach Salt Ash until midnight, when he made across to the Booral
road through Williamtown, arriving at West Maitland an hour
later, and despatched his report.</p>

<p>It is ironical that a base that had been planned as an
Australian naval station, and never used, should have been chosen
by the enemy to gain its first foothold in the east Hancock's
message deepened the anxiety at headquarters, for the departure
of the fleet with the remaining troopships foreshadowed another
landing elsewhere That the anxiety was warranted was confirmed
dramatically on the morning of Wednesday, when two messages
reached Melbourne almost simultaneously.</p>

<p>The first from Wallsend announced that enemy troopships were
at the wharves in Port Hunter and that the ruins of Newcastle
were occupied. Troops were already moving along the Maitland
road. The second was wirelessed from H.M.A.S. <i>Adelaide</i>. It
was brief, but, brief as it was, it bore tidings of immeasurable
disaster. The cruiser was in a hot engagement with enemy
aircraft, and was being shelled from outside the harbour. At the
same time landings were being effected at Manly, Coogee, and
Bondi beaches.</p>

<p>It is difficult for those who were not present to understand
the feelings of General Mackinnon, the commander-in-chief, and
the general staff when confronted with these messages. They and
the members of the Council of Defence alone understood their
purport. And at the same time they foresaw the inevitable result.
The order for general mobilisation had been given on September
23. On this morning of Wednesday, the 27th, the movement was
still incomplete. Two days more at least, would be required to
collect the widely scattered units. And until then it was
impossible to offer an effective opposition to the enemy.</p>

<p>On paper the trained forces of the Commonwealth on a peace
footing amounted to 35,000. With Western Australia and Queensland
out of the picture, and with the crash of the New South Wales
organisation, there were only actually three infantry brigades at
the Commander-in-Chief s disposal. At most he could depend upon
two artillery brigades. There was one incomplete armoured car
regiment, and an inadequate though efficient engineering and army
service corps to complete the force at his command&mdash;at the
most, less than one complete division of 16,000 men.</p>

<p>Already the strategic plan of the enemy was sufficiently
developed for the Commander-in-Chief to realise what he had to
expect. The first raid on the east coast was intended to prevent
any interference with the enemy operations for consolidating
their hold on the west. Now, the landings at Port Stephens,
Newcastle, and Sydney disclosed the intentions of striking at the
heart of Australia&mdash;that vital area, between Newcastle and
Port Kembla, inland from the 150 miles of coastline.</p>

<p>If a circle of 100 miles in diameter is drawn with Helensburgh
just south of Cronulla as the centre, the arc, running through
Newcastle and inland as far as Bathurst, encloses an area the
possession of which means the possession of Australia. It was for
this supremely important area that the enemy was undoubtedly
striking.</p>

<p>It was clear that a third landing was intended at Port Kembla.
Were that effected, the three forces working in conjunction must
succeed. Within the area lay some of the richest country in
minerals and agriculture in the Commonwealth, and every essential
line of communication. The only hope of fending off the
inevitable third blow lay in the Air Force.</p>

<p>It was not until long after that I heard any detail of those
momentous conferences in Melbourne that took place on September
27. Despite the Prime Minister's call for the assembly or the
Federal Parliament in Canberra, it was found that the probable
attendance would not exceed 30 members. In view of the urgency of
the case the venue of the session was changed to Parliament
House, Melbourne. Canberra was too exposed and too far away from
headquarters. The Victorian capital become the seat of
government. It was at Parliament House, too, that the Defence
Council met, and here it was on that afternoon of September 27
that General Mackinnon told the naked truth to the Cabinet.</p>

<p>The story was told to me by a former Minister, just after the
news of the decision of the Berlin Congress was made
public&mdash;late in 1941. He related how a scared House had met,
and in half an hour had passed an emergency appropriation of
250,000,000&mdash;'It might as well have made it
250,000,000,000 for all the good it did us,' he added. 'Great
Scot! what mugs we were.'</p>

<p>The Minister for Defence told the House all he knew, and that
was little. But he assured them that by Christmas time we would
have 100,000 men equipped and in the field, preparations were
being made for offsetting the loss of the Broken Hill Proprietary
steel works and those at Kembla by manufacturing in South
Australia and Melbourne. He admitted that they would be short of
steel supplies for the time being. But he assured the members
that there were ample supplies of infantry artillery
ammunition.</p>

<p>But it was the gloomiest session he had ever attended. More
than a dozen members, including the leader of the Opposition, had
been killed on Bloody Saturday. The Minister confided to the
House that the situation must be regarded as grave But he was
firmly of opinion that the enemy could not reinforce what he
called their 'filibustering expedition.' While the loss of life
and the damage done was deplorable, he was sure that within a
short time the invaders would be driven into the sea.</p>

<p>When the House adjourned Mackinnon was asked to meet the
Cabinet to discuss the situation. It was then that, as my
informant put it, 'we got it right in the neck.'</p>

<p>He didn't make any bones about it or beat about the bush. He
said: 'Mr. Prime Minister, I have just issued an order sending
the entire Air Force at our disposal to the South Coast of New
South Wales. An attempt at a third landing at Kembla is
inevitable. If that landing succeeds I doubt if we can save
Australia. As things are, there, is no other form of Opposition I
can offer.'</p>

<p>They were all pretty worried faces in the room, but as he
spoke they grew paler still.</p>

<p>'We must recognise that Western Australia is already lost; but
I do not anticipate any attack from that quarter&mdash;'</p>

<p>'But why not?' broke in the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>'Because, sir, it would not be worth their while. They know
quite well the hole we are in.'</p>

<p>No one spoke.</p>

<p>He went on: 'With all the men I can gather from Victoria and
New South Wales, with a mixed brigade from South Australia, I
cannot muster a full division.'</p>

<p>Again be paused.</p>

<p>'None of those troops are hardened or fully trained for
service. The possibility of this emergency and the peril from the
lack of man power have been placed before successive Governments,
who have disregarded the military representations.'</p>

<p>'We can have 100,000 men trained and equipped by the end of
the year,' said the Minister for Defence.</p>

<p>'Mr. Prime Minister, I am afraid the enemy will not give us
until the end of the year before forcing a decisive engagement
'</p>

<p>'You mean&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I mean, sir, that the enemy is already at Maitland and
Parramatta. Tomorrow they may be in Mudgee. But by that time
Lithgow will most certainly have gone, and possibly Moss Vale, if
not Goulburn. We must face the facts, sir. If the Air Force
cannot stave off that landing at Kembla they will be over the
Victorian border in a week.'</p>

<p>It was the Minister for Defence who spoke. 'A rather unusual
pessimism for a Commander-in-Chief. Perhaps you can give us some
grounds for your&mdash;er&mdash;depressing prophecies.'</p>

<p>The stocky figure swung round. He was not a man who suffered
fools gladly, and he had been working 20 hours a day since the
23rd. The effort with which he bit back the first words that come
to his lips was evident as he glared at the speaker.</p>

<p>'Yes!' he snapped. 'You shall have my reasons. But first, let
me tell you that I or any other military officer who gave you an
optimistic estimate of our situation should be shot as a
traitor.</p>

'Any officer who gave you an optimistic estimate<br>
of our situation should be shot as a traitor.'</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>'I have less than a division of insufficiently trained troops.
It will be two days, at least, before I am in a position to move.
The manner in which the enemy have moved from the time the first
shot was fired indicates that they are thoroughly sure of their
ground and their plans. Just as they knew of the gun emplacements
on our forts, so they know to a man our weakness. Do you imagine
for one moment, with the advantage they have gained already, that
they will give us an opportunity to enrol and train a thousand
men, much less one hundred thousand?'</p>

<p>He stood up and pushed his chair back, and leaned forward with
his hands on the edge of the table. 'Listen, gentlemen! From what
we can gather I am convinced they have already landed at least
one division at Newcastle and Sydney each. They left Port
Stephens with 22 troopships, apart from thee men they may be
carrying on their naval units.</p>

<p>'We do not know, beyond the fact that they have mechanised
artillery and tanks, what their strength of mechanised units may
be. But from the perfection of organisation and preparedness they
have already exhibited I am convinced they are much stronger in
them than we are.'</p>

<p>The group round the table was silent as he walked over to a
map on the wall.</p>

<p>'The one great urgent factor is to stop the progress of the
enemy so as to allow him no time to consolidate his positions as
he moves towards the Victorian border. When I said he would be
across in a week was too optimistic. This is Wednesday, and I
doubt if we have until Sunday.'</p>

<p>'Gentlemen,' he added, sweeping his hand to the map. 'they
have now practical possession of the New South Wales railway
system and of all the arterial highways, and their mobility is
assured.'</p>

<p>'But surely we can delay him by blowing up the railway bridges
and destroying all petrol supplies on the line of march,' came a
voice from the table.</p>

<p>Mackinnon returned and took his seat. 'As Commander-in-Chief,
my answer is "Yes." That course would effect some delay. But the
answer to the problem is yours&mdash;not mine.'</p>

<p>'Problem?' queried the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>For answer the General took a packet of papers from his
pocket.</p>

<p>'These are telegrams from Singleton, Cessnock, Liverpool, and
other places. Every one of them tells the same story of ruthless
slaughter of civilian population in the occupied districts. Every
town or settlement they reach is subject to a systematic
terrorisation. Age or sex makes no difference. They are sweeping
ahead of a vast panic-stricken horde of refugees as they move
south. These are using every possible form of transport. Some, of
course, are moving west out of line of march. Nevertheless all
roads are congested with uncontrolled traffic.</p>

<p>'You must envisage the situation clearly, Mr. Prime Minister.
The evident intention of the enemy is to force you, the
Government of this country, to accept their terror at the
earliest possible moment. To do this they have adopted a policy
of "frightfulness." They believe a terror-stricken people will
force your hands, or that you will submit in order to stop the
slaughter. If we cut the communication and destroy the petrol
supplies on the line of advance, we condemn those refugees to
death. Or if not all, the greater number of them.</p>

<p>'Gentlemen, that decision rests with you. Thank God! it is not
mine.'</p>

<p>'But surely,' the Prime Minister said, 'they will not dare to
shock the civilised world with such crime. We have been able to
establish, communication with the Government of the United
States. The report of such an infamy move them to
intervention.'</p>

<p>'That is a purely political matter,' replied Mackinnon. 'If I
venture any opinion at all it is that any optimism would be
misplaced. In any case, intervention would be a matter of weeks;
our problem is one of hours. If the enemy have considered such a
factor at all, they have offset it in a determination to achieve
a <i>fait accompli</i>.'</p>

<p>'You can offer no alternative?' came a voice from the
table.</p>

<p>'None!'</p>

<p>Mackinnon stood up and looked round the strained faces.</p>

<p>'I must advise you from the military situation alone. As
regards the petrol problem, I think it will solve itself.
Investigation we have made in the past proves that the normal
road supply would not be adequate to meet an urgent demand tor
military purposes. The crowds rushing south will have drained
every supply station in the line of advance. Possibly the enemy
have made provision for their own supplies.'</p>

<p>'And the bridges?' the Minister for Defence asked.</p>

<p>'The destruction of the bridges must delay them&mdash;but not
for long, It is you who must decide whether to cut that line of
safety for the refugees. I have already given orders to all local
authorities to try to turn the line of flight to the west. And I
have despatched a strong party of engineers by road. They are to
reach as closely as possible to advanced parties of the enemy,
and to cut the roads and bridges in any useful positions behind
the fugitives.</p>

<p>'When must you act?' The Prime Minister's voice was unsteady
as he spoke.</p>

<p>'Every hour&mdash;every minute counts. Apart from the
assumption that the nearest enemy unit is only a little more than
200 miles from Albury&mdash;at Lithgow&mdash;there is the other
factor or an attack and occupation of Kembla and Wollongong. If
they strike there&mdash;and there is nothing to oppose
them&mdash;they will move through Moss Vale, and Goulburn to the
vital road and rail junction at Cootamundra. That will result in
cutting off all refugees north of that line. That would be an
appalling situation, but not the worst aspect of it.'</p>

<p>'Could anything be worse?' asked the Prime Minister
bitterly.</p>

<p>'Can you not realise what it would mean?' Mackinnon pointed to
the map. 'If they reach Cootamundra they are in possession of the
entire vital area of Australia. With that in their
hands&mdash;'</p>

<p>He turned from the map and regarded them in silence.</p>

<p>'You mean that we're&mdash;' The Prime Minister did not put
the thought into words.</p>

<p>'Nothing short of a miracle can save us.' Mackinnon's voice
carried a finality that left no room for argument or dissent.</p>

<p>'Have you formed any plans, General?' It was the Minister for
Defence who broke the stunned silence in the room.</p>

<p>'So far as humanly possible,' said Mackinnon primly. 'You
must, recognise the fact that the military initiative is entirely
in the hands of the enemy. We can only try to anticipate his
tactics, but we are positively on the defensive. But I must warn
you, gentlemen, I should be failing in my duty if I attempted to
minimise the critical nature of our position.'</p>

<p>'Let us hear the worst, rather than temporise with
probabilities. We must know what we have to face.' The Prime
Minister spoke for the gathering.</p>

<p>'You will need all your courage, gentlemen, but I do not doubt
that. I only hope the people will display the same fortitude, for
they, too, will be called upon to face the crisis of Australia's
history within a very few days.'</p>

<p>He resumed his seat and spoke quietly, but decisively. 'In
striking with synchronized attacks at both east and west, the
enemy, who is fully conversant with our weakness aimed at
dividing our small force. We have already decided that any
attempt to aid Western Australia by land is hopeless and
impracticable. I must jealously guard our small force for the
desperate needs of the eastern States.</p>

<p>'Queensland is hopelessly cut off, so we must rule out any
hope of help from that quarter. Tasmania is isolated, though I am
risking drawing one battalion of trained men as a reinforcement.
When I say 'risking', I mean that I am bringing them across from
Burnie tonight to land them, I hope, in Portland tomorrow
morning. But the possibility of the enemy sending destroyers to
Bass Strait is so great that I would not have done it had not the
demand been so urgent.'</p>

<p>'What about Tasmania, General?' someone asked.</p>

<p>'Tasmania's fate will be ours, in any case. They will not
bother with the island or with Queensland until they have settled
with us. Neither can offer any resistance&mdash;and the enemy
knows it.</p>

<p>'Gentlemen, we can only guess at the strength opposed to us,
but I fear it is not less than three divisions, say 48,000 men.
But should it be only two, that is 32,000 all told, the gravity
of our situation is not much improved. They are moving down the
Victorian border with all the speed they can muster. They know
well that there are no means by which we can oppose them, and
they know, too, that they can hold salient points in occupied
territory with very small detachments. That is one of their
objects in terrorising the country and cowing the civilians.</p>

<p>'I could move up to meet them over the New South Wales border,
but believe me, gentlemen, it would take 100,000 troops to cope
with the possibilities of their advance to Victoria. My base is
here, and there are only too many ways in which they could hold
me while they outflanked me and came in on my rear. And,
moreover, I cannot&mdash;dare not&mdash;divide my force.'</p>

<p>He held up his hand as the Prime Minister moved as though to
speak. 'Permit me to finish first, sir. If I should move north,
they may, and probably will, land behind me on the Victorian
coast&mdash;say at Westernport. The longer their line of march
from any one of their three landing places in New South Wales,
the more their vulnerability increases. They know they must meet
me, and they will do it at the first possible moment.</p>

<p>'Their only possible line of advance is at one or more of the
rail crossings at Albury. Corowa, Yarrawonga. or Tocumwal, but by
any or all of these routes they must converge finally on Seymour
by road or rail&mdash;and it is at Seymour my force is lying. If
I do not go to meet them they are compelled to seek me out.'</p>

<p>'Seymour!' exclaimed the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Mackinnon nodded. 'It is the farthest, point from their bases
I can choose. and the one that will diminish their fighting
strength to the greatest extend Remember, we will be fighting on
ground we know, and I dare not choose a spot nearer
Melbourne.'</p>

<p>'It seems a desperate chance, General.'</p>

<p>'That is what I want to impress upon you all,' Mackinnon said
impressively. 'It is desperate: but I'm convinced that it is our
only chance.'</p>

<p>'And if we fail&mdash;'</p>

<p>'If we fail&mdash;' The level grey eyes took in the silent
group. 'If we fail, then we reap our fools' harvest. I use the
expression without personal implication. The fools are the entire
population of this country who have been warned again and again
and would not heed the warning.'</p>

<p>'And if you stop them?'</p>

<p>Mackinnon shrugged his stocky wide shoulders and smiled.</p>

<p>'It will give us breathing space&mdash;but remember this! It
will give <i>them</i> breathing space. Don't misunderstand the
situation. I am convinced that they have heavy reinforcements on
the way. There is nothing in the Pacific to interfere with their
communications. They can withdraw to the north and consolidate
and come again. The battle even if we are successful, will weaken
us too much to permit us to follow, up any advantage.'</p>

<p>'You mean to tell us, then, that we must risk everything on
one desperate thrown and if we lose it means unconditional
surrender?'</p>

<p>'Exactly! All that would be left would be a useless guerrilla
warfare. It would do nothing more than enrage the enemy and make
conditions harsher.</p>

<p>'I may say, gentlemen,' he added. 'that what I have told you
is the considered opinion not only, of myself but of my
staff.'</p>

<p>Never were there a sicker body of men than the eight Cabinet
Ministers who listened to Mackinnon's news.</p>

<p>The utterly preposterous event that they and their
predecessors had been warned of had actually happened. All the
anxious questions put to him only emphasised the acuteness of the
peril. None knew better than Mackinnon the almost hopeless task
with which he was confronted. He had been forced to make a
heartbreaking decision. He had to abandon New South Wales and
face a trained and elated army with half-trained and raw men. His
only hope lay in that his men, who would be fresh, and fired by a
spirit of high courage, would meet an army tired by long marches
and who would fight on unfamiliar ground. But, even so, he knew
in his heart that even if victorious he must be eventually the
victim of overwhelming numbers.</p>

<p>That night the Cabinet learned that the Government of the
United States had protested against the slaughter of helpless
civilians in Australia, and had received from the enemy's
Ambassador an emphatic Assurance that the civilian population
were being treated with consideration and a spirit of
conciliation.</p>

<p>That night, too, the Defence Council learned that the enemy
had effected a landing at Port Kembla and Wollongong. Though two
troopships had been sunk, only seven Australian fighting planes
were intact. At the same time came news of the first attempt at
resistance on land by a hastily formed body of some 50 civilians
who, recognising the situation, made a desperate attempt to check
the advance over the great bastion of the coastal ranges. They
knew that the best line the enemy could take to reach the plateau
was through the Macquarie Pass that winds down the precipitous
face of the towering rampart of rock.</p>

<p>Arming themselves with shotguns and sporting rifles, they
piled into cars with all the explosives they could obtain. Half
of them were experienced miners. Selecting a spot some third of
the distance from the top of the pass they began feverishly to
drill holes for their gelignite. An hour later they knew of the
approach of a train of motor-cars. Some 15 or 20 went past,
filled with refugees, who cried that the enemy were close
behind.</p>

<p>They had left a guard of a dozen men on the bend below that on
which they were working. A few minutes later an outburst of fire
below warned them of the arrival of the enemy. A tree had
been cut through was hurled across the road by a charge of
dynamite. While a dozen workers strove desperately to complete
the drill holes that had been begun, the main body, from
concealment in the undergrowth, opened a steady fire down the
pass.</p>

<p>But under cover of a raking fire from machine guns the enemy
moved up. As the fire of the defenders slackened the chatter of
machine-guns and the roll of rifle fire increased, Seeing the
attack must succeed the charges were hastily inserted and
exploded in an attempt to effect at least some damage. With the
roar of the last some hundreds of tons of rock were flung
thundering down- the mountain side. There was a momentary silence
of firing as the mass of boulders went roaring and crashing among
the timber--then it broke out again as the defenders began their
retreat to the cars that they had left higher up.</p>

<p>It was a gallant, but ineffectual attempt, for the road was
only partially closed. As the first car sped round the next
hairpin bend it was sighted by the enemy. It got through but the
next was swept with machine-gun bullets, and blocked the progress
of those behind. The rest made a gallant fight to the end. The
face above was too sleep to climb. Though the men in the first
car tried to cover their escape, the position was hopeless. They
fell to the last man. Only one carload of six men lived to carry
the news to Moss Vale that the enemy held the head of the pass.
The net was closing in.</p>

<p>That night, too. orders were issued for the removal of all
inhabitants, livestock, and food supplies, and fodder, from the
triangle formed by the railway, with Mangalore at its apex, and
with the Murray at between Albury and Tocumwal as its base. With
the orders went another to the Field Company of Engineers to
prepare all the bridges across the Murray in that area for
demolition.</p>

<h2><a id="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

<p class="first">IT WAS on Tuesday while Fergus and I were
engaged in the appalling work of gathering the remains of the
victims of Saturday that the patients in the hospital were,
evacuated to emergency hospitals at Parramatta. We had seen Lynda
in, the evening, and she told us that she was stopping at the
hospital that night, but would be leaving with some special
hospital equipment next morning at 10 o'clock.</p>

<p>Between us Fergus and I possessed about 30/-, all but 1/- of
which was mine. No one had any money. Most of the banks had
ceased to. exist. They had a name, but no local habitation.
Fergus possessed a chequebook, but told me that, though he knew a
bank could go broke, he did not realise that one could go as
broke as the branch that held his account. Its site was occupied
by a 40ft. crater.</p>

<p>Red Cross and other workers were being fed at the town hall,
and of necessity we were living anywhere we could find shelter,
and eating at the public canteen.</p>

<p>It was only by good luck, on the Tuesday night, that in George
street I noticed a hole blown in a basement. We explored and
concluded that the premises belonged to a furnishing shop, for
the basement was full of bedding. It was here that we camped for
the night. We had agreed to meet our burial gang at Paddington at
8 o'clock next morning. We were both dog weary, and the basement
being lightless, we overslept. It was a quarter to eight when | 1
was dragged back to life by Fergus.</p>

<p>Conscience-stricken, we hurried to the canteen and drank mugs
of coffee and wolfed thick sandwiches as we stood. Making up Park
street which was fairly clear of debris on our way to our work we
had reached the corner of Hyde Park at Elizabeth street, when we
halted and stared eastward. From down towards the heads we heard
the distant roar of propellers. 'Those devils are back again,' I
muttered. 'Can you see them?'</p>

<p>A moment later Fergus pointed. 'Take a line straight across to
Bondi.'</p>

<p>There, flying at a great height in the blue, we could make out
two formations of dots.</p>

<p>'Dod! man,' growled Fergus. 'Surely there's nothing they've
forgotten to smash. What are the brutes after?'</p>

<p>As he spoke They swept swiftly downwards, circling round the
harbour like questing birds. Then they roared almost overhead,
and a minute later we heard the crash of a gun from the direction
of Darling Harbour and a shell burst high in the air among the
planes. A moment later the planes began bombing, and we knew it
was the remaining cruiser they were after.</p>

<p>Above the roar of the bombs we could hear the regular clearer
note of the gun. Then we both burst into a yell as one of the
planes shattered to fragments in the air. But, almost before the
falling pieces had disappeared, there came a concussion that
rocked the tottering walls, and a great burst of smoke billowed
up behind the skyline.</p>

<p>We were so intent on the fight that we did not notice two
companies of infantry had turned out of York street towards
Oxford street. It was the military force in charge of the wrecked
city. We hurried after them. We found the young officer who had
dealt with our bandits in charge of the second company. From him
we heard the startling news that had been signalled from the
Heads. The battle fleet was standing in shore guarding a landing
from troopships. The enemy were coming inshore at both Manly and
Bondi beaches. As he spoke there was a terrific explosion from
the direction of the Heads.</p>

<p>He glanced over his shoulder.</p>

<p>'There goes the magazine of the North Head fort. They are
blowing up the forts to prevent the enemy getting them
intact.'</p>

<br>

<p>'But where are you fellows off to?' I asked. He wasn't much
more than a boy. That lad grinned as he replied. 'We're 188 all
told, and we're off along to the Old South Head road to hold them
up.'</p>

<p>'But,' Fergus exclaimed. 'You haven't a dog's show. There'll
be thousands of them.'</p>

<p>'A brigade probably,' he laughed. 'But it will be merry hell
while it lasts. They'll have the deuce of a job rooting us out of
the wrecked building up there.'</p>

<p>'Dod! man! I'm with you!' Fergus's eyes shone.</p>

<p>'Don't be a dashed idiot!' the young fellow snapped back.
'There's not a pop-gun in the whole place besides our rifles. You
two get back and don't throw away your lives. They'll be wanting
men like you later.'</p>

<p>'But&mdash;' began Fergus.</p>

<p>'But, be hanged.' he barked. ''Listen! We've had word from
Newcastle that they are massacring women and men
indiscriminately, and they'll do it here. If you're not mad, you
get out, and get quickly. We won't be able to check them for more
than an hour or two. and they'll be in the city through the Spit
by then as well. If you know any women get them. Go! Don't be
dashed fools.'</p>

<p>He shook our hands and hurried after his men.</p>

<p>'That's a man,' 'Fergus commented gravely, as we looked after
him. Then he exclaimed. 'Come on! The hospital!' and we went
across the park at the double. Before we were half-way across we
heard banging of guns in the harbour. We did not know it then,
but all of the destroyers had run out and begun shelling the
enemy landing at Bondi and Manly. It was a splendid but hopeless
gesture, for in a few minutes we heard the roar of heavy guns to
seaward.</p>

<p>Then came the planes again. Before we reached the hospital we
could hear the crash of their bombs as they swooped on the doomed
destroyers.</p>

<p>'Queer thing:' Fergus gasped as we ran. 'Those brutes have
wrecked the whole city. They've murdered thousands and thousands,
but no one's seen one of them!'</p>

<p>When we reached the empty but still intact wing of the
hospital we found Lynda and about 20 members of the staff had
been warned, and were on the point of leaving. Every effort was
being made to hurry the people from the threatened area. Despite
the riot of shelling and gunfire that roared over the harbour,
Lynda kept her head and heard our news without making a fuss.</p>

<p>Her orders had been changed. She was to go to Moss Vale, where
a train load of injured had been sent. A car was waiting for her
at the intersection of City road and Cleveland street, which was
one of the nearest points from which wheeled traffic could move.
That was nearly two miles away, and going over the blocked
streets would be heavy. There was no time to lose, and as the men
of the hospital staff were anxious to be off they were glad to
leave Lynda in our charge. Fortunately the first part of our
flight from the hospital through Hyde Park was over cleared
ground. Fergus seized Lynda's small suit case, and we hurried
off. Behind us the crash of gun fire died down and broke out
again.</p>

<p>It was not until we reached Liverpool street that we began to
realise how many people had remained in the ruined area. There
were hundreds. mostly men, singly and in groups, all hurrying
westward. It was here, too, that in the intervals of bombardment
we could hear the faint splutter of rifle fire from the direction
of Bondi. Both Elizabeth and Castlereagh street were badly
blocked, but Pitt street to the west of Liverpool street was more
open. Even so it took us nearly an hour to reach the wreckage of
the Central railway station.</p>

<p>As we went, Lynda told us that the car that was waiting for
her was owned and driven by a volunteer worker named Clifford of
whom she knew nothing. Her orders had been changed before there
was any thought of a second attack.</p>

<p>Although hundreds of people were clambering over the debris in
Pitt street, most of the fugitives were making for the Parramatta
road, by George street, so that crowds from both streets, all on
foot, converged on George street west. It was an extraordinary
spectacle. We saw very few children. But men and women, whose
clothes were all the worse for wear, scrambled and struggled
toward open streets and safety. Some were empty handed, but most
carried bundles or suit-cases containing all their possessions.
They were all weary-looking and their faces showed the strain of
the terror from which they were flying.</p>

<p>We three talked very little. Fergus stuck to Lynda's case, and
I helped her over the tough spots, and they were many. Then just
as we reached the intersection of the City road a fresh torment
was added. We heard a high pitched whine that ended in a screech
and the explosion of a shell that burst among the ruins of the
Central station. Those devils were beginning to fire on the
flying throng. That fiendish act was one more proof that the fire
was being directed by enemy agents. That first salvo was the
herald of r storm that made the last few bundled yards of our
journey a nerve-wracking race with death. As we broke into a run
devastation swept down from the sky, filling the air with flying
fragments of steel and debris. Across the street a dozen shells
burst in the University grounds. We could hear the screams of
women and the shouting of men.</p>

<p>During those last few yards my mind was occupied with the
question of whether a car would be waiting. I could have howled
with delight as we found a big double-seater standing at the
comer, in Cleveland street. Beside it stood a tall, somewhat
sallow young man. His dark eyes rather belied the gravity of the'
long face.</p>

<p>'Clifford?' I cried as we raced up.</p>

<p>'Right! is this Sister Burton?' He flung open the rear door of
the car as he spoke. 'Pile in! this is no place to talk.'</p>

<p>Fergus pushed the suitcase in. and Lynda followed it. Then we
stood back, hesitating. Clifford ran round Mid took his place at
the wheel. 'Hop in, you two,' he shouted.</p>

<p>'But,' I began, somehow it seemed I like rushing the boats in
a shipwreck. Lynda bent forward and said to Graham. 'They're my
brother and a friend.' Clifford had started his engine, and
looked round.</p>

<p>'This is going to be a tough trip. She may need help. Get in,
I can't wait.'</p>

<p>I slipped into the front seat, for Fergus had promptly taken
his place by Lynda's side. The next instant the car turned south
on top gear. I have seen some fancy car-driving but nothing like
that with which Clifford covered those first four miles to
Arncliffe. That he never hit anything as he stared tight-lipped
ahead was at the same time a fact and a miracle. The road was
full of mad traffic, all heading in the one direction. All
semblance of order had vanished. and it was every man for
himself.</p>

<p>It was not until we passed Arncliffe that he spoke. 'I'll have
to try the Prince's Highway and make through Wollongong and over
the Macquarie Pass. I hear the Hume Highway is almost
impassable.'</p>

<p>'Lord send the George's River bridge is safe.' Fergus
commented.</p>

<p>Clifford's face lit up for a moment. 'My sentiments, too!
You'll notice I'm not dawdling.'</p>

<p>He cut in front of car before us with, the needle of his
speedometer touching 70. The air was still echoing to the roar or
the bombardment behind us. Then a moment later a shell burst
close to the road 100 yards ahead of us We had still nearly two
miles to go to the bridge, but we covered the distance in less
than two minutes. But it was a lively two minutes.</p>

<p>Inside Botany Bay a destroyer was nosing on some illegitimate
business. Outside a cruiser could be seen wreathing herself in
puffs of black smoke. We raced on to the approach to the bridge a
shell swept through the high girders, miraculously missing them
and sent up a column of water half a mile beyond.</p>

<p>We were more than half-way across when a terrific burst
announced a hit behind us.</p>

<p>Fergus, looking back, called out that only a stretch of the
parapet had been broken. Almost immediately&mdash;we were not 50
feet from the end, and comparative safety&mdash;the bridge and
car were deluged by a mass of water thrown up by another shell
that struck short by s happy 50 feet. The next instant we were
over, and we felt safe. The cruiser would be too intent on the
bridge to bother about the road.</p>

<p>By this time we had raced almost clear of traffic. Clifford
relaxed and slowed down to 50 on the wide, smooth road. I turned
round to look at Lynda. 'Women are queer,' on the authority of
Sir Anthony Glosler and Kipling. Though I did not expect
hysterics, I did expect her to look scared or at least anxious.
Instead, she was looking positively radiant, even to a brother's
eyes. As she returned my smile Clifford said over his shoulder,
'Thank goodness you're not a squealing woman, Sister Burton, and
you had reason to squeal just then.'</p>

<p>'We learn to swallow our squeals in a hospital,' she laughed,
'and, to truthful, I swallowed one long squeal all across the
bridge.' Then a thought struck me. 'Lynda&mdash;have you any
money?' I asked. 'Fergus and I are almost broke.'</p>

<p>'Then we're lucky,' she laughed. 'On Saturday morning I drew
12 from my savings bank account, with intent to commit an
extravagance, and did not have time to commit it. It's all
here.</p>

<p>'Said Clifford. 'I can throw in nearly 17, and we may need it
badly.'</p>

<p>'Why do you say that?' I asked.</p>

<p>He slowed down and turned in his seat. 'Have you heard
anything of what has happened at Newcastle? Remembering what the
officer had told us in Hyde Park?'</p>

<p>I looked at Lynda before I' answered. She read my thought with
her usual skill. I never could keep anything from her.</p>

<p>'Listen, you men,' she said. 'Whatever is going on, I'm going
to be in it. I'm neither a fool nor a flapper. Things are bad, I
know, but I want to know everything.'</p>

<p>'Sister Burton's right,' Clifford said. 'I'd best tell you
everything. They've been raiding and slaughtering for miles round
Newcastle, and as far out as Maitland. I was warned at the town
hall this morning that the road down from Singleton and Maitland
and through Windsor to the Hume Highway is fairly choked with
fugitives making south.'</p>

<p>'They told me,' he went on, 'that conditions on the road are
appalling. There is no control of any kind, and the worst element
is getting the upper hand. They are stopping cars and forcing the
owners out of them and robbing them besides. Petrol is running
short, and they are taking it from people who have it. There have
been several murders. I don't know what it will be like down
towards Wollongong, but we will have to be prepared.'</p>

<p>'There may be difficulty in getting food, too, if that's the
case,' Fergus put in.</p>

<p>'That's certain!' Clifford answered. 'Anyway, when I heard
what was going on, I decided that we must take the Prince's
Highway. You fellows can't tell how glad I was when you came with
Sister Burton, because unless I'm a raving pessimist we are in
for a rough trip. But I came more or less prepared, oven to the
extent of doing a spot of looting.'</p>

<p>'Everything goes these, days,' I said. 'Ask Fergus where we
got the whisky we drank last night.</p>

<p>Clifford bent down and picked up an attach case from the
floor.</p>

<p>'Open it,' he said, handing it to me. 'I raided a shop in
Market street for I those.'</p>

<p>'When I opened the case I found that 'those' were a pair of
nasty looking automatic pistols with 300 rounds of ammunition to
match them.</p>

<p>'I did not expect anyone but Sister Burton, or I would have
taken another,' he explained. 'But I've loaded I them both. We
may not want them, but if we do, we'll want them badly.'</p>

<p>'Besides those,' he went on. 'I have 20 gallons of petrol in
the tank, and another 16 gallons in the luggage carrier.'</p>

<p>'Then,' said Lynda, 'but for the food we have nothing to worry
about.'</p>

<p>Clifford laughed. 'Don't ask me how I got it, but there is
enough tinned stuff and biscuits there to see us
through.'</p>

The route of Walter Burton's tragic fight to Victoria.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>We did not know Bob then so well as we did later. But this
foresight was characteristic. He had a genius for detail that
missed little. Nor did we know then that Bloody Saturday had cost
him his father, his mother, two sisters, and a
brother&mdash;every one belonging to him. He had been working for
the Bar when the smash came, and had been brought up in a wealthy
home. Behind the mask of his quiet reserve was a cast-iron will
and a resolute spirit that stopped at nothing. I suppose had I
been able to pick and choose It could not have fallen in with two
better men than Fergus Graham and Bob Clifford&mdash;men of whose
existence I had been unaware a few clays earlier.</p>

<p>We were not long in hearing that anarchy ruled. When we
reached National Park we found it swarming with destitute
refugees; living under makeshift shelters or in cars useless for
want of petrol. They were half starved and were depending on
Sydney for help that was not forthcoming. They swarmed into the
road and yelled at us for food, or for a lift to escape. It was a
sickening spectacle. At the back stood women and children,
evidently unused to hardship, mutely imploring with their eyes.
The crew on the road were men of a different brand. They cursed
and threatened as we sped past.</p>

<p>Clifford dared not stop. They would have rushed us if he had.
Fergus had taken one pistol and I the other, at Clifford's
request. Said he, 'It's a case of the survival of the fittest. If
it comes to shooting, shoot end don't hesitate.'</p>

<p>I never heard of what became of those unfortunates, but their
fate must have been terrible, and I doubt whether any survived.
Down nearly the whole of the 20 miles to Bulli Pass we overtook
groups plodding along in the hope of reaching help below the
Pass.</p>

<p>It was while we were passing Darke's Forest that we received
the first hint of what was ahead of us when we began to meet an
ever-increasing number of cars racing north, and packed to
capacity. Some even had men clinging on their footboards. About a
mile from Sublime Point we found one stopped to change a tyre.
Clifford pulled up and asked the reason for the exodus. The
answer to the question staggered us. The Government had ordering
the evacuation of the entire South Coast between Bulli and Nowra,
as there was a certainty of an enemy raid and landing at Port
Kembla. We warned them that It was madness to try for safety
towards the north, and that they would find Sydney in the hands
of the enemy. But they would not listen.</p>

<p>We stopped again at the Lookout. We hoped to add to our food
supply, but the little store there had been completely looted.
Lynda, who had gone to the platform of the Lookout, called to us,
and pointed to the north-east. There, not more than 10 miles away
we saw a great array of ships heading to the south.</p>

<p>The sight spurred us into movement. Already the stream of cars
coming up the Pass was almost unbroken. Clifford set off as fast
as the descent and the upward traffic permitted. In any other
circumstance I should have called Clifford some unseemly names
for the risks he took, but we went down that switchback zigzag at
45 miles an hour from head to foot. Had the road been clear when
we reached the level ground all would have been well. As it was,
the road was a seething bedlam. Down the whole of that long
streak of settlement from Bulli to Port Kembla was 'tumult and
affright.' Panic-stricken people in vehicles of every description
filled the roads, byways, and highway alike.</p>

<p>We crawled along till we reached Bellambi, and tried the lower
road, but it took us an hour to cover the two miles to Balgownie
before we could reach the highway again. It was then nearly one
o'clock, and we found the road clearer, as most of the traffic
was making south. By the time we reached Wollongong. Clifford was
able to pick his way without trouble. We were almost clear of the
town when excited people pointing and staring upward drew our
attention to seme planes flying seaward at a great height.</p>

<p>Then as Clifford increased our speed, two things happened
almost simultaneously. First we heard the boom of a heavy gun out
to sea; them in Kembla, ahead of us, a shell burst sent up a
pillar of black smoke and debris.</p>

<p>Neither of the four exclamations that greeted it from our car
were exactly refined. Lynda's 'Damn them!' sounded so heartfelt
that we all laughed. That first shell however had one good
effect, spurring on the thinning traffic. It was time, too,
because that first arrival was the forerunner of a series of
terrific explosions round the already devastated port.</p>

<p>As we swept through Unanderra, Port Kembla was a raging
volcano, but fortunately for us the fire was kept on the sea
front. Still as we fled down the eight miles of road behind Lake
Illawarra we were almost deafened by the smashing concussions of
the bombardment. But the peace of the lake and of the beautiful
countryside formed a strange contrast to the tumult reigning so
near us.</p>

<p>Where the road to Moss Vale across Macquarie Pass branches off
Prince's Highway at the south end of Lake Illawarra, Clifford
stopped the car. He turned round to Lynda.</p>

<p>'Here's where you will have to make a decision,' he said.</p>

<p>'Why is the decision to be mine?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Well,' grinned Bob, 'at the Town Hall In Sydney I undertook
to deliver a nurse at Moss Vale, and I am ready to carry out my
contract.'</p>

<p>'Then why not go ahead?' asked Lynda.</p>

<p>'If that nurse is wise, I think she'll order me to drive to
Melbourne rather more than 600 miles, at the best speed we can get out of this bus.'</p>

<p>Lynda murmured. 'Umm!' and then, 'And what good reason is
there that I should desert a hospital full of patients?'</p>

<p>'First,' Clifford went on, 'the patients may not be there when
you reach Moss Vale. Secondly, those shell-peddling blighters
will probably be there, too, in a couple of days. Thirdly, Moss
Vale is in the line of flight from the north, and conditions
there are not likely to be fit for human consumption.'</p>

<p>We three watched Lynda's face intently as he spoke. Her level
eyes looked straight into Clifford's, and she shook her head
decisively.</p>

<p>'I undertook to go to Moss Vale. Would you turn down a job
like that because it was risky?'</p>

<p>'But a man's different&mdash;'</p>

<p>She broke in. 'Don't talk nonsense. You know you'd go. Please
don't let us waste time.'</p>

<p>Bob turned to Fergus and me, hesitating. Fergus, looked at
Lynda and shook his head.</p>

<p>'I've no doubt but that Clifford's right, but I'll not try to
persuade you against your conscience. Then dropping into his own
speech, he added: 'I'm thinkin' 'twad be a waste o' guid
breath.'</p>

<p>Knowing Lynda. I smiled. 'I am afraid Graham's right. It would
be wasting breath.'</p>

<p>'The amendment is carried by a majority of two.' Clifford
swung the car off the highway and turned west towards the great
wall of the Macquarie Range. Behind us the guns were still
pounding.</p>

<p>We spoke very little as the car ran through the lovely open
country towards the Pass. Most of the traffic was flying south,
but there were some cars on the road ahead. We must have been
near the end of the stampede. As we neared a red-roofed farm,
tucked into a fold of ground where the road began to rise
steeply, a plaintive demand from Fergus for food reminded us that
we were hungry.</p>

<p>Lynda insisted the must have tea or perish. It was then that
Bob admitted he had tea, but no billy in which to make nor cups
from which to drink it. Necessity knows no law and he turned the
car from the road to the house that stood a few hundred yards
back. The house was deserted. We knocked and shouted, but
received no response. I committed a rather bad job of amateur
burglary on the back door. A fire still glowed on the kitchen
range, and Lynda took charge of the subsequent proceedings.</p>

<p>While the kettle was boiling Bob and I went to the car for
food. At that stage, just four days after Bloody Saturday, our
social sense was not quite shattered. No doubt there was food
about the house, but though I did not mind burglary, we all
hesitated at stealing food&mdash;that was to come.</p>

<p>Looking back towards the coast, we could see heavy columns of
smoke rising from the direction of Port Kembla and Wollongong. I
suppose we were in that house less than half an hour. As we drank
our tea from borrowed cups and ate biscuits and cheese, Lynda
chaffed Fergus and me on our utterly disreputable appearance.
Each of us wore four day's growth on our chin. and we were
doubtless deserving of her description as a pair of Domain
deadbeats, Clifford had shaved that morning, and his clothes
looked less shabby.</p>

<p>Lynda was tidying up the table when we heard voices outside.
Bob and I went to the door. There were five men examining our car
with suspicious intent. They Were a tough looking gang.</p>

<p>As we slipped out of the doorway one of them looked up and saw
us. and directed the attention of the others.</p>

<p>Said Clifford quietly, 'What do you fellows want!'</p>

<p>They exchanged glances, and then one stepped forward.</p>

<p>'Well! Since you want to know all about it, we want this car.'
he said truculently. Clifford glanced at me and whispered, 'Have
you got that automatic?'</p>

<p>I nodded. The weight of it in my pocket gave me a sense of
comfort.</p>

<p>'Sorry,' said Clifford, 'but we need ii ourselves. Bunk out of
this.'</p>

<p>One of them laughed. 'Oh!&mdash;your bloomin' lordship, you
can have ours in exchange. You'll find it half a mile back on the
road&mdash; without gas.'</p>

<p>'I told you to get out of this,' Clifford did not raise his
voice, but he whispered to no be ready.</p>

<p>'Well,' said the first man, 'since there's five of us, the
vote's against you blokes. We're taking it. You don't think we're
going to wait here to be butchered.'</p>

<p>They turned and moved towards the car. As they did I pulled
out the automatic and called out 'Stop! and stand back!' As I
calico I found Fergus was standing beside me. They all turned,
and one shouted,</p>

<p>What followed was a matter of seconds. The five started
forward together. They were not twenty feet from us. As they
rushed Fergus and fired. One dropped and another stopped: but the
other three came on. We fired again and another fell, and the
remaining two backed off. The man we had wounded first sunk to
the ground, and, supporting himself on one hand gasped horrible
threats at us. There was a thin stream of blood from his mouth.
The other two lay still. Fergus turned on the two who were still
standing. 'I'll count three, and if you're in range by then I'll
kill you both.'</p>

<p>He pointed up the hill from the road with the pistol.
'One!'</p>

<p>The next instant they were legging it as hard as they could
put foot to the ground.</p>

<p>I looked round. Lynda was standing in the doorway behind me.
She stared at the fallen men.</p>

<p>'Oh! Had you to do it?' she almost whispered. Clifford, who
was bending over the wounded man, looked up. 'We had no option.
Sister. These brutes would have left us here without
compunction.'</p>

<p>She nodded toward the fallen figure. 'Is he&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'Just about!' said Bob, standing up. 'The bullet wert clean
through his chest. we'd better get away.'</p>

<p>Fergus was replacing the empty cartridge in his magazine, and
handed two to me. I reloaded, and we hurried to the car. By this
time the other two had disappeared. Thirty seconds later we were
on our way, leaving the three sprawling bodies where they lay. As
we turned onto the road I looked back. So far as I could see over
the quiet open landscape it was empty but for a car standing in
the middle of the road below us.</p>

<p>As Clifford drove on I could not help wondering at the
queerness of it all. I had just participated in the killing of
three men, but I had not the slightest feeling of remorse or
repugnance. All the statute and moral laws seemed to have been
abrogated. I had a sense of satisfaction rather than guilt. It
was Fergus who put it in a nutshell by saying,</p>

<p>'It's luck you brought those automatics. Clifford, or we would
have been in a nasty fix.'</p>

<p>Clifford nodded. 'I said it would be the survival of the
fittest I'm afraid that is only the beginning.'</p>

<p>The car ran on in second gear, climbing that magnificent
winding road up the Pass.</p>

<p>Somewhere near the top we were slopped and questioned by armed
men. They were civilians, who asked if we had seen signs of the
enemy. We told them all we knew, and found they were making an
attempt to block the road for wheeled traffic to delay the
advance. Higher up we came on more or them working
feverishly.</p>

<p>It was nearly sunset when we reached the head of the Pass,
with 15 miles to go to reach Moss Vale. Running through that
lovely country with quiet landscapes and shadowed valleys, it
seemed incredible that terror brooded over everything. But the
village of Robertson, when we reached it, was deserted but for
one car that was leaving as we arrived. Its owner asked for news
from the coast. He told us he was making south through Kangaroo
Valley and Nowra for Melbourne. and advised us not to go on to
Moss Vale, as there were rumours that the enemy would make for
it.</p>

<p>A little later, about half-way to our destination, several
cars raced by us all packed with men. They shouted as they passed
that the enemy had reached the Pass. At dusk we arrived at Moss
Vale. That wide-streeted town was in turmoil. Evidently the news
that the enemy had reached Macquarie Pass had been magnified to
terrifying proportions. It took us an hour to learn that Lynda's
train had gone on, whither our informant had no idea.</p>

<p>We sought the station-master a much harassed man, who was
sticking to his job, endeavouring to deal at the same time with a
frenzied railway traffic problem, and frenzied passengers for
whom he had no trains.</p>

<p>He told us that a trainload of wounded and injured people had
come in from Sydney, but that he had had orders to send it
through to Goulburn, and that it had left before midday. To
Lynda, whose calm was a contrast to the surrounding panic, he
confided that all possible rolling stock was being rushed south
to prevent it from falling into the hands of the enemy. But he
knew they had got possession of several passenger trains and
locomotives and many goods trucks. He believed they were in
Muswellbrook, and were making across to Gulgong. The last message
they had from Katoomba was at 2 o'clock, and he feared they must
by now be at Lithgow.</p>

<p>We returned to Fergus who had stayed to guard the car, and
discussed the situation. Despite the wild rumours in the streets,
we felt that if the enemy had reached the head of Macquarie Pass
could be only a small detachment to secure the road. It was
unlikely that they could reach Moss Vale from Kembla in any
numbers before late next day, if then.</p>

<p>'What I can't understand.' said Fergus, 'is why they are not
here already from Parramatta. It's not seventy miles, and if they
have got hold of railway rolling stock you'd think they'd be here
to meet their murderous friends from Kembla.'</p>

<p>'Elementary, my dear Watson!' Clifford remarked, with an
attempt at flippancy. 'They want Lithgow first with the munition
works, and they want it intact. That crowd that romped into
Sydney this morning has wiped out the naval units they had
bottled up there, and now they can unload their troopships and
make the Harbour a naval base. With Lithgow in their hands they
can wait for the Newcastle gang to come down to them from
Mudgee.'</p>

<p>'Don't forget.' I said. 'they can fly light. The devils don't
need to wait for their artillery. They have both rail and road
open to them, and I expect they have been able to take in more
motor vehicles than they need for the taking.'</p>

<p>'Lord! What a mess!' groaned Bob. 'It's been a walkover. Just
four days end we're mopped up. Just look how they stand. It's one
step for them from Lithgow to Bathurst. The Newcastle lot can
join the Sydney force by two lines from Mudgee and Gulgong. Then
the gang from Kembla can use Moss Vale as a base to work through
from there to Goulburn and Cootamundra. That gives them the whole
vital area from Newcastle to Kembla, inland.'</p>

<p>'And not a whack at them anywhere,' Fergus said savagely.
'We're running. Everybody's running. Haven't we a military force
anywhere? It's like driving sheep.'</p>

<p>'But.' asked Lynda anxiously, 'surely we aren't beaten without
a blow or a fight?'</p>

<p>Bob rubbed his chin thoughtfully. 'I suppose they are
concentrating our troops somewhere south in Victoria, and may
meet them north of the Murray. But&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Dash it all.' Fergus said, 'the thing's preposterous. There
are 7,000,000 people in Australia, and you don't mean to say
they're licked by a few shiploads of Cambasians in four
days.'</p>

<p>'In Russia,' Bob answered gravely, 'a few hundred thousand
organised Communists are holding more than 100,000,000 people in
subjection. Our organisation was wiped out with Sydney.'</p>

<p>'But Victoria!' Lynda protested. 'They could raise 150,000 men
there, at least.'</p>

<p>'Twice that number would be useless unless trained and armed.
They won't give us the time. That's why they're rushing the three
landings,' Bob replied.</p>

<p>'There's one thing, I know,' I said. 'We'll have to get out of
here and make for Melbourne,'</p>

<p>'That's my idea, too,' Clifford agreed. 'There's no military
organisation here, and if we get to Melbourne they may let us
enlist in some kind of force.'</p>

<p>Fergus turned lo Lynda. 'It's useless for you to try to follow
your hospital train.</p>

<p>'I think the others are right,' Lynda submitted without
argument but suggested we should try to get something to eat
before we left. But getting anything to eat in Moss Vale that
night was another matter. The mile long main street was thronged
by people whose sole idea was to get out of the town at the first
possible moment. While the others waited in the car I made
inquiries for food. There was none to be had. Hundreds of
refugees from the north had left the Hume Highway at Mittagong,
and had gone down to Moss Vale. The stories they spread of the
devastation and savagery of the invaders, had struck terror.</p>

<p>We had no idea what truth was in the stories, but they were
believed. All the shops had been cleared by the crowds. One place
I entered was completely wrecked. The owner told me that when he
announced his stock had gone a crowd had refused to believe him,
and ransacked the place.</p>

<p>I finally returned to the car, empty-handed, to find Fergus
and Clifford in hot argument with four men, who demanded places
in it. My appearance complicated the situation. They threatened
to wreck the car if we would not lake them. No one took the
slightest notice of the altercation, violent as it was. One of
them lurched forward and struck Fergus in the face. I pulled out
my automatic and cracked him on the head with the butt. The
others turned on me, and I warned them I would fire. Clifford
opened the door and I slipped in. Two jumped on the running-board
as we started, but I smashed at their hands with the pistol, and
they dropped off, cursing with rage.</p>

<p>Clifford started through the crowded street, but driving was
no easy matter. Again and again we halted and at each halt
threatening or imploring faces peered in at us. It was half an
hour before we got through the fear-maddened crowd. It had been
an experience that drove home to us how completely the moral
fibre of the people had been sapped. At the railway station a
demoralised crowd was clamouring for transportation anywhere.
They were swarming over a train of empty goods trucks for which
there was no locomotive, fighting for places like wild animals.
The milling throng in the streets, who were rushing empty shops
and hotels were not the worst elements of the community. They had
been the ordinary decent Australian town and country folk. So far
as we could see there was no vestige of authority or control.
They were beyond listening to reason. The one idea was to escape
from the threatened town. All ordinary decencies of life had
lapsed. The appalling spectacle illustrated the results of the
enemy's policy of frightfulness. Mob panic ruled.</p>

<p>It was not until we passed Wingello, 15 miles from Moss Vale,
that Bob drew the car to the roadside and stopped. For 10 miles
along the road fugitives on foot had tried to stop the car. Twice
we passed cars that had been stopped, round which fighting groups
struggled for their possession. Once I had to fire a shot over
the head of a man who stood full in our path in an attempt to
hold us up. Poring over a road map by the light of an electric
torch, we discussed our route. Our experience at Moss Vale
decided us not to risk passing through Goulburn. Finally we chose
a route by leaving the main road to cut off through Bungonia to
reach Canberra through Tarago.</p>

<p>That night, somewhere south of Bungonia. Bob lost the road. So
at eleven o'clock he turned the car into a patch of scrub where
it was hidden from the track. Here, with Lynda in possession of
the car, we three slept on the ground in turns&mdash;one standing
sentry.</p>

<p>Next morning at daylight we opened and emptied two tins of
tongues and used the tins for foiling water for tea. It is a plan
I do not recommend, except in case of emergency. But even old
tongue and biscuits with tea of an original flavour were welcome
at the time.</p>

<p>It was while Bob was gathering firewood and Fergus and I were
opening the tins that I made a discovery. Lynda approached us
from the car. She had made some sort of a toilet, but she was not
looking her usual spick-and-span best. With a brotherly love of
tact I greeted her with: 'Great Scot! Lyn, you do look a
deadbeat.'</p>

<p>Fergus looked up at the same time and. swung round on me.
There was cold fire in his eyes, and as his hand lifted no man
was ever nearer a sock on the jaw without actually getting it
than was at that moment. I gaped at them in turn. Lynda flushed
and put her hand gently on Fergus's arm. Fergus growled in his
throat inarticulately, still glaring. Then enlightenment slowly
percolated to my understanding.</p>

<p>'You&mdash;you two&mdash;!' Even my dense mind could not
mistake the expression I in Lynda's eyes as she looked at that
bellicose Scot.</p>

<p>'If you hadn't been utterly blind,' Lynda laughed, 'you would
not need telling.'</p>

<p>'And. maybe,' Fergus added with a grin. 'ye wad no had come so
near a crackit on the nose. Deadbeat! An' ye say that again ye'll
get it.'</p>

<p>'I apologise and withdraw unreservedly.' Mirth overcame me.
'But I how was to know? When did it all happen?'</p>

<p>'Yesterday morning on the George River bridge while that
dashed cruiser was shelling us.'</p>

<p>It was Bob's voice close behind us.</p>

<p>Lynda emitted a startled 'Oh!' Her flush deepened as she
stared at Bob in embarrassed amazement. He dropped an armful of
wood. 'I had to confess. It was the mirror. I happened to glance
up as that shell hit the bridge behind us. Forgive!'</p>

<p>He held out his hand with a disarming smile.</p>

<p>'You young devil!' said Lynda dispassionately. Then with a
little lift of her head she looked at Fergus. 'Anyway, I'm proud
of it.'</p>

<p>We shook hands all round, and I said to Fergus. ' Well, of all
the times to select for a proposal I think yours was a record-
breaker.'</p>

<p>'Well!' he grinned, 'I didn't know where the next shell would
land and I wanted her to know.'</p>

<p>I turned to Bob. 'All I can say Is, there must be something in
it. If a girl will accept a man looking like Fergus, with four
day's growth of whiskers on him, she's prepared lot the
worst.'</p>

<p>Fergus fingered his stubbly chin.</p>

<p>'It's verra embarrassin', Wally.'</p>

<p>Bob, who was on his knees making a fire, looked up.</p>

<p>'Wally,' he said. 'Your sister says she wasn't scared, but I
know her heart was in her mouth all the time.'</p>

<p>'Fergus!' cried Lynda, her eyes dancing, 'Give that young imp
what you were going to give Wally.'</p>

<p>'We'll do better,' Fergus took her hand. 'We'll leave them to
get the breakfast,' and they turned their backs on us and
strolled away.</p>

<p>Bob looked at his watch. 'It's not seven o'clock yet. We'll
give them half an hour.' And we did, but they took nearly an
hour. In the circumstances we had a lively meal. As Fergus
pointed out, apart from his unusual wooing he had asked Lynda to
marry him when his sole possessions were one shilling and the
clothes he stood in, and they were, by then, nothing to boast
about.</p>

<p>On the road again Bob soon picked up the right track, and by a
little after 9 o'clock we were in Queanbeyan, and found the town
excited, but otherwise normal. We heard that the enemy were in
Lithgow on the previous night, and that Katoomba had been
destroyed by fire, deliberately. But all the news was vague and
unconfirmed. We waited long enough to have a much-needed shave
and clean-up, and procure some food. Here, too Bob was able to
refill our petrol tank.</p>

<p>Our decision to avoid Goulburn added more than 100 miles to
our route. From Queanbeyan our road described an exasperating
letter N. We went nearly 70 miles south to Cooma, 100 miles
north-west to Tumut and then 70 south again till we reached the
Victorian border at Tintaldra. But one advantage of it was that
the roads were almost clear of traffic. We were able to procure
all the petrol we required, and by great luck Bob was able to buy
three empty five-gallon drums, which we filled and stored in the
luggage-carrier as a reserve supply.</p>

<p>However, it was not until dusk that we arrived at Tintaldra on
the Wednesday night. It was here for the first time since the
previous Saturday we came on evidence of constituted authority.
The crossing of the bridge, as at all other bridges along the
border, was under strict official control. We were not prepared,
however, for the congested traffic that filled the road from
Albury.</p>

<p>We found later that the stampede down the main highways had
been so great that Albury, and to some extent, the Hume Weir
crossing, had been reserved for Government and military traffic.
Refugee traffic had been diverted west to Corowa and Yarrawonga,
and east as far as Tintaldra.</p>

<p>A small but efficient organisation took the names of car
owners, number of passengers, and point of starting and
destination of refugees. They were given a route to which they
had to adhere. A warning was issued that no petrol could be
purchased on the Victorian side, and that cars must be
surrendered to the Government at their destination. Our orders
were to go by Tallangatta, Myrtleford, and Whitefield to
Mansfield, where we would be redirected. By the time we had
completed formalities the bridge was closed for the night and
would not be reopened until 6.30 next morning.</p>

<p>It was an uneasy night. There were more than 500 cars waiting
to cross. The news that petrol could not be procured in Victoria
spread dismay and flagrant dishonesty. Again and again uproar
broke out through attempts at theft on petrol tanks.</p>

<p>It was after a scratch meal of boiled eggs that Bob ran
against the controller of the crossing and found in him an old
friend. They paced up and down in earnest talk for half an hour.
Bob came back to the car looking glum. Lynda demanded to be told
the worst.</p>

<p>Seated on the running board to keep an eye on our petrol tank,
his repeated his tidings. His informant was an old friend of his
family.</p>

<p>'You might as well hear it now,' he said, 'I'm afraid we're
scuppered. My friend who is handling the road traffic between
here and Corowa tells me we have hardly a hope. They expect the
enemy will be over the border by Sunday or Monday. They will
probably wait until their artillery catches up with them. He
hears we are not going to try to stop them until they are well in
Victoria. They only allow Government traffic on the Hume Highway.
and the cross roads are congested with stock they are driving off
the enemy's probable route. He says Albury is one seething
lunatic asylum. The railway on both sides is choked- with trains
They're trying to, get the refugees away. They're coming in at
the rate of 1,000 an hour. They're sending the motor traffic
along to Corowa, Yarrawonga, and Tocumwal. Nothing but refugees
and military supplies are allowed on the rails. There are
thousands on foot crowding in by the roads&mdash;all
destitute.'</p>

<p>'Sounds like a chapter from the Book of Job,' I remarked.</p>

<p>'That's not all,' Bob went on. 'The enemy are devastating and
butchering in every town they enter. They are at Moss Vale now,
coming down from Parramatta and some from Kembla.'</p>

<p>'Just that!' Bob growled, 'and now we are paying for it, and
few other things besides.'</p>

<p>We had little rest that night. One of us was always on guard
on the petrol tank. As I tried to settle down after my spell of
watching. Fergus got into a heated argument with a prowler. An
exchange of opprobrious remarks led to a scrimmage that drew not
only me and Bob but surrounding campers to the scene. We
separated the combatants, and I recognised in the intruder a
well-known Sydney stockbroker . When the confusion died down it
was found I hat the tanks of two cars had been emptied during
their owners' absence. Both owners went looking for my
stockbroking acquaintance. After that brawls were unattended
except by the principals.</p>

<p>It was just after 7 o'clock on Thursday morning that our car
lurched across the bridge behind another, loaded like a camel
with the worldly goods of its owner. Before we left, a well-known
Sydney stockbroker with a badly damaged face was offering 5 a
gallon for 20 gallons of petrol and there were no takers.
Fortunately the weather held.</p>

<p>Had we not known that that grim war was behind us, and most
likely in front too, the run down to Mansfield would have made a
delightful trip. Possibly Lynda and Fergus were the only two
people on the road utterly contented with the present and
oblivious of the future. At Mansfield, which we reached by one
o'clock, we found the residents polite but not cordial. They
already had had some experience of refugees that did not make
them popular as a class. Near the Kennedy Memorial we found an
official, who gave us one hour to rest, and added directions that
our route lay via Alexandria. Healesville, Coldstream, and
Ringwood. He warned us that any deviation would mean trouble. We
were also told we were to drive direct to Albert Park on arrival
and surrender our car.</p>

<p>We accepted no more than ten minutes of our hour of grace. Our
own experience of refugees made us tolerant of Mansfield's
opinion of them. Thereafter at each town beyond Alexandra our
passes were checked, and we were waved on our journey.</p>

<p>As we followed the road among the hills we gradually came to
the conclusion that Melbourne had 'gone bush.' Everywhere a tent
could be pitched or a camp made were families who, having heard
of what had happened to Sydney had left Melbourne, encouraged by
the authorities. On the road we passed scores of transport
lorries that had been organised to bring supplies to the
campers.</p>

<p>It was nearly 5 o'clock when we passed through Kew and into
the city by Bridge road. To us, who had none through five days
from Bloody Saturday, its peace and lack of apparent excitement
seemed unreal. Shops were open. People seemed to be going about
their business unconcerned. The trams ran as usual, and the
evening crowds were converging on the Flinders street station.
Here and there among the crowd we saw men in uniform.</p>

<p>It was only in the freedom of the streets from traffic we saw
the shadow from the north. Between Kew and the city we did not
see half a dozen motor-cars. As we turned from Flinders street
into St. Kilda road people stared at our car and its New South
Wales number. Twice we had been halted and our passes
examined.</p>

<p>Albert Park at last! South of the lake near the Middle Park
station hundreds of cars were parked, and ours was directed to
take its place among them. Here we alighted, stiff and tired. We
were four fugitives. Except for Lynda we had no clothes but those
in which we stood. Our joint finances totalled 24. The
authorities allowed us to take our food, but the little petrol
left was commandeered.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

<p class="first">THERE was a refugee bureau at the South
Melbourne Cricket-ground, where information could be obtained.
Here our story that we had come from Sydney by the south coast
attracted immediate attention. Telephones rang, and five minutes
later we were in a car and driving to the barracks. How anxious
the authorities were for information was manifest by the
immediate interview we had with an intelligence officer. To the
best of our ability we told of conditions at Sydney and of the
roads down, and of what we had seen of the enemy raids. For an
hour we answered questions.</p>

<p>Then our luck held. Lynda had demanded from Fergus the right
to volunteer for army nursing, to which he had readily agreed as
the best and safest place for her, if there were safety anywhere.
So that on the close of our interview when we, in our turn,
offered ourselves for service of any kind. Lynda had no
difficulty in gaining her wish. Even the problem of her shelter
for the night was solved by the Army Medical authorities. With us
however, the situation was not so easy. Then chance helped
us.</p>

</div>
<br>

<p>As we were leaving the barracks Fergus almost fell on the neck
of an officer wearing red tabs who was coming up the steps.</p>

<p>'Ginger!' he exclaimed. The other stood off and looked at him,
and a second later the two were wringing one another's hands. Bob
and I were introduced, and the Red Tab heard our tale.</p>

<p>'All we want,' I urged, 'is a job in which we can be
useful.'</p>

<p>He took us back into the building with him.</p>

<p>He suggested our enlisting and going out to Broadmeadows. but
Fergus would have none of that.</p>

<p>'Now listen to me, Ginger!' he said, with belligerent
emphasis. 'If we go to Broadmeadows it will be months before we
get into uniform, even. We three have been shelled by those
blighters. He gave a rapid sketch of our experiences of the week,
and went on. 'What we want is a, my boy&mdash;'</p>

<p>'But&mdash;' began Ginger. (I do not recollect his real
name.)</p>

<p>Fergus cut him short.</p>

<p>'I said. 'Listen to me!' We're three good men, and we want
jobs. Do you get that? We want them now. If those red patches
you're sporting mean anything, you're the man to get them for us.
Uniforms. Any kind! Now!'</p>

<p>'You infernal pertinacious Scot!' Ginger growled. 'Do you
think there are no dashed regulations?'</p>

<p>'Just because I know there are two dashed, many of 'em is why
I'm laying down the law to you,' Fergus retorted.</p>

<p>'I tell you!' Ginger began to protest.</p>

<p>'Holy wars!' cut in Fergus. 'Must I say it all over again?
Can't you understand English? Don't you see, for one thing, so
soon as we get into those uniforms you'll be able to shut me up
and do all the talking.'</p>

<p>'Hump! That's a genuine incitement to break the whole of the
army regulations at once.'</p>

<p>Ginger turned from Fergus to us.</p>

<p>'I think,' I advised. 'that you would be saving a lot of
trouble for yourself if you humour him.'</p>

<p>Ginger tugged at the lobe of his ear thoughtfully. 'You say
you'll I take on anything?' he asked presently.</p>

<p>'I've been telling you that till I'm hoarse,' Fergus
growled.</p>

<p>'You're an infernal pest. Graham,' the other grinned: 'but
wait here and see what I can do.' He departed.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For half an hour we waited, dodging the traffic in the
corridors. Then we were rounded up by an orderly, who shepherded
us into a presence who was in earnest conversation with Ginger. I
hoped, as he looked us over, we appeared more respectable than I
felt.</p>

<p>'These are the three.' Ginger nodded towards us as we came to
a halt. 'If that beaky Scot demands to by made a colonel you'd
better give in at once. I can guarantee his nerve.'</p>

<p>He left the room, throwing a 'Good luck' over his shoulder as
he strode out of our lives. The presence looked us over and made
short work of us.</p>

<p>'Occupations?' he snapped.</p>

<p>We replied suitably and briefly.</p>

<p>'Could you drive motor-waggons?'</p>

<p>We affirmed that we could. Had he said tanks the answer would
have been the same Three minutes later we were out of the room,
followed by a curtly expressed hope that we would not crash the
transport lorries as we crashed the regulations.</p>

<p>Fergus's friend Ginger must have been a man of ways and means.
That evening we reported in uniform to a transport park in the
Royal Park. Fergus summed up the situation by saying that if a
man could not make use of his friends in an emergency then what
was the good of having friends.</p>

<p>Daylight next morning found us loading flour in two-ton
lorries at the Spencer street yards. There were six of us, with a
sergeant in charge, who was not excessively exacting. By 7
o'clock we were loaded.</p>

<p>We had turned out of the yards into Flinders street and were
passing the Fish Market when I first noticed the drone of
propellers. I felt sore, for I knew in my bones what was coming.
It was again Saturday morning, and the memories of the last
Saturday were still raw.</p>

<p>I stuck out my head and looked back. Bob and Fergus evidently
thought alike, for close behind me they too were craning their
necks. I was waiting, strained, for what was coming. Then
somewhere behind towards the west, there came the too familiar
crash of the explosion.</p>

<p>There were not many people in the streets, but it pulled them
all up standing. A tram approaching me slopped as though it had
been shot. As I passed I cried to the conductor, who was staring
ahead. 'They're here?'</p>

<p>Mixed up with my apprehension was resentment that having left
them behind at Sydney and Kembla, there was something personal in
their raiding Melbourne now. Then the city quivered to a
succession of bursts behind us. We reached Elizabeth Street, and
turned north while the hellish pounding went on. Inwardly I
prayed that we would not be caught in the streets. Some of the
scenes in the devastated streets in Sydney were fresh in my mind.
Evidently the sergeant, who was leading, had similar thoughts,
for he was losing no time and we kept well on his back wheel. I
looked westward at intersection, but could see no sign of the
planes, though there were few clouds and the sky was clear. Still
the riot of sound enveloped everything. I did not know
until.afterwards that the approaching tram had first bomb had
wrecked the electric station at Newport, and that others were
falling among the oil storage tanks and the Newport railway
workshops.</p>

<p>By the time we reached Victoria street, the bombing had
ceased. We hurried on. From the Haymarket I looked back. Beyond
the city to the south-west smoke was rising in solid black
columns that ascended for 1,000 ft. or more before mushrooming
like thunder clouds. All the way to Brunswick the road was
thronged by cyclists&mdash;men going to their work to the city
factories. Most of them had slopped, and, standing beside their
machines, stared at the rising smoke clouds uncertain whether to
go on. When we reached Brunswick the narrow bottle-necked street
was a turmoil of terrified people. Electric transport had gone
out of commission for the time being. We found the camp at
Broadmeadows as wildly excited as the city, and hungry for news
of what had happened. We had not finished discharging our loads
when we received orders to race back with all speed through the
township of Broadmeadows and down to Newport to help to transport
the wounded.</p>

<p>Five minutes later we were on our way. It was disastrous luck
or calculated devilry on the part of the enemy that the raid was
made at the time. The shops were working night and day turning
out munitions with an increased staff. They caught not only the
night shift but many of the day shift who had already arrived.
For this reason the loss of life had been calamitous. As we drove
through Footscray the great columns of smoke from the wrecked oil
tanks were still spreading their sinister pall over everything.
When we reached the devastated yards crowds of people from the
surrounding district were risking their lives trying to recover
victims from the shattered shops.</p>

<p>To me and Fergus it was a horrible repetition of our work in
the Domain on the night of Bloody Saturday. Though a fleet of
ambulance waggons was on the scene before us they could not cope
with the loads of sufferers lifted from the wreckage. Not 5 per
cent of the unfortunate workers escaped injury. In exploding the
tombs had hurled, with terrible effect, fragments of shattered
machinery and all the loose metal lying about the shops that
added terribly to their destructive force.</p>

<p>A number of bombs had fallen among the thickly clustered homes
to the north and in the residential area, where a whole block
close to the Newport railway station was blazing. I needed
gritted teeth and steel nerves to help to load our lorries and to
drive the mangled and torn bodies in the temporary hospitals. On
my trip with 12 men, six were dead when I arrived at the
destination half a mile away.</p>

<p>As we worked, all the time the conviction was at the back of
my mind that those accursed planes would return. I felt sure that
Newport would not be their sole objective, and that their tactics
of frightfulness were to be repeated in Melbourne. On the only
occasion on which I saw Fergus during the morning he re-echoed my
anxiety.</p>

<p>The morning passed swiftly in our heartbreaking toil. It
seemed, as though the smoking, twisted ruins had become an
inexhaustible source of mangled humanity.</p>

<p>I do not know when, but it must have been well after mid-day,
I again heard that sound l had come to hate above all
others&mdash;the note of propellers flying thousand of feet
up.</p>

<p>The day was fine and the white clouds were very high, but,
looking up, we saw the flying specks higher still. They passed
directly overhead. Then came the clear-cut note of the anti-
aircraft guns, and puffs of white cloud broke out among the
flying fiends. They were over the city&mdash;50 of them. Helpless
and sick at heart, we watched. Then, from somewhere behind the
spired and towered skyline in the distance came the now too
familiar crash, with its sudden mighty black fountain of smoke.
Even the searchers among the ruins for the few who still remained
alive halted in their work and stood awe-stricken. Roar after
roar, crash after crash, and the black clouds sprang up, thinned,
and rose again. For 15 minutes that seemed interminable, the
solid earth seemed to quiver under the blows. Then the birds of
prey droned overhead seaward again.</p>

<p>I tried to shut out of my mind the thought of what had
happened in the city during those minutes. We heard nothing as we
went on with out work until only the dead remained. That raid of
the morning had been disastrous enough without the second. The
railway workshops had been completely wrecked, along with the
electric power station and all the oil fuel storage tanks. Almost
as deplorable was the total destruction of the sewerage pumping
plant for the entire metropolitan area. All those vital spots
seemed as though grouped as an invitation to the attacker.</p>

<p>Added to this was the havoc among the surrounding homes, l
never heard the total of that death roll, but it must have been
ghastly. There was. however, we learned later one mitigation of
the terrors of the day. The authorities had anticipated the
second. Orders had been broadcast suspending all business In the
city, and all entrances had been closed. The enforced suspension
of rail and tram traffic had aided carrying out the orders.
During the morning police had patrolled the streets, clearing
them and residential buildings of people, so that when the second
raid came the loss of life was comparatively slight. With
incredible folly, though, some residents declined to leave.</p>

<p>By four o'clock our work was finished, and the transport train
assembled on the Melbourne Road. That drive back showed how the
raids had stunned the people in the industrial suburbs through
which we passed. The streets were quiet, but all the way through
people stood in groups staring at the smoke that drifted high
above the city. The almost total absence of traffic gave a weird
effect. The rumble of our long train of waggons was all that
broke the silence.</p>

<p>We passed through Arden and Abbotsford streets on our way to
Royal Park, but could see no actual signs of the damage that had
been done. But we saw only too much of it later. The enemy planes
had concentrated on the mile long target of the heart of the
city. It was curious that the west end had almost escaped.
Spencer street was untouched, and so was Flinders street. From
there up to Russell street the whole block seemed to have been
blown into Flinders street. The wall above the Princes Bridge
railway line had been swept down on to the lines below. There was
not a building untouched, and flames were raging along the line
of the shattered warehouses and offices of Flinders lane. It was
not until the corner of Swanston street was reached that the
destruction of St Paul's Cathedral was visible. A bomb had
crashed into the nave, bringing down the Moorhouse Tower and the
entire south wall with the two smaller spires. The chancel was
still intact but unroofed.</p>

</div>
<br>

<p>On the west side of Swanston street
two buildings had been crushed by masses of fallen masonry from
the great spire. In Bourke street and Collins street the
devastation was appalling. Fires were burning unchecked because
it was impossible for the brigades to reach them owing to the
streets being piled high with debris. The farthest bomb to the
east had fallen in Exhibition street near Little Collins street.
To the west, another had blocked Collins street below William
street. At the intersection of Collins and Elizabeth streets a
great crater 40 feet in diameter had been blasted, which was full
of water from a broken main.</p>

<p>One strange feature of the spectacle as we saw it first that
evening was the absence of crowds that such a catastrophe should
attract. On Princes Bridge there were perhaps a hundred silent
awe-stricken people, but even in the north, few spectators
ventured nearer than Victoria street. When night fell orders were
given that no lights were to be shown. Even smoking was
prohibited in the park. The whole of the metropolitan area was
blacked out for the night. We three had learned to take our
discomforts philosophically, and were thankful for any kind of
shelter.</p>

<p>I tried to sleep, but the scenes I had witnessed that Morning
were to new, and, despite my weariness, I barely dozed. Then
again, all chance of rest was broken by that loathed drone of
propellers. They came about half-past ten. From the sound and the
swiftness of their approach it was evident that, relying on the
protection of the darkness, they were flying low. It was nerve
wracking to stand in the dark wondering where the first bombs
would drop, and strained feelings found vent in muttered
maledictions and grim jest. A dozen searchlights were sweeping
the moonless sky for them. As we waited in the park they seemed
to roar above us at an elevation of only a few hundred feet.
There was a sigh of relief as the sound diminished. It seemed an
interminable time before there came the boom of explosion from
the north. Then followed a torture of fiendish ingenuity. Those
birds of ill-omen swept on a weaving course from Sandringham to
Coburg and from Footscray to Box Hill. They dropped incendiary
and high explosive bombs at irregular intervals. Four times they
passed directly over Royal Park. Nearer and farther we heard the
roar of bombs, punctuated by the vicious barking of anti aircraft
guns. The brutes seemed to have carried loads of small but
destructive bombs instead of the terrific weapons they had used
to blast the city.</p>

<p>That night raid was pure terrorism. The wide area it covered
and the length of time it endured&mdash;nearly an hour&mdash;was
deliberate torture of the whole metropolitan area. We heard later
that they had laid their eggs as far apart as Gladstone street,
Sandringham, and the Pentridge stockade. It fulfilled its aim of
shattering the nerves of a million people. Actually it did less
material harm than the two daylight raids, but its psychological
effects were worse. The worst damage was done at the corner of
St. Kilda and Commercial roads, where the loss of life was
pitiful.</p>

<p>The full story of the raid was similar to that of the raids on
the Sydney forts on the previous Saturday. There had first been a
concentrated attack on the forts at the Heads in the early
morning, and later the fleet stood in bombarding the damaged
batteries and covering the operations from an aircraft carrier.
Sunday came after that night or terror to reveal that Melbourne,
though it had not suffered the naval attack of Sydney, was as
completely demoralised as Sydney had been. The three raids had
broken the nerve of the entire population&mdash;the effect on
which, no doubt, the enemy was calculating.</p>

<p>During the morning we who were called upon to assist in
gathering the victims saw the beginning of the exodus on foot to
the hills. People who had money were offering fabulous sums for
horse-drawn vehicles.</p>

<p>The terror of another attack was realised on the afternoon of
that Sunday, when that which occurred was the worst of all. They
came over an force about three o'clock In the afternoon.
Disregarding the city, they crossed and recrossed the southern
suburbs, especially in the congested areas of Prahran and
Windsor, and out as far as Brighton. Every residential suburb
suffered. It was in no sense a military operation, but a
calculated butchery to smash the moral of the civil population. I
think that on this occasion the loss of life must have been equal
to that of any of the attacks on Sydney except that in the city
itself on Bloody Saturday. When night fell the whole of Chapel
street was in flames from end to end. From a distance the entire
area between Toorak road and Balaclava road appeared as a sea of
fire.</p>

<h2><a id="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

<p class="first">LOOKING back on that tragic week from September
23, its every hour brought its own irreparable disaster. In the
seven days Australia had been torn from its apparently
unassailable pedestal of prosperity and safety and flung into an
abyss of terror. In those seven days the heritage of freedom
vanished. We were stripped of every spiritual and material
possession.</p>

<p>By October 1 no man in the Commonwealth could call his soul,
his life, or his property his own. Their destiny had passed into
alien hands. By snatching the West from our grasp, and by three
swift blows in the east, all hope of effectual resistance had
been crushed. We were as a wrestler on whom an adversary had
fixed an unbreakable hold, and who had but to bear down upon our
paralysed body till we cried for mercy or broke. The bitterness
of it was that our physical strength was intact but we were
powerless to use it.</p>

<p>All that terror that had swept over New South Wales was now
the lot of Victoria. Scenes such as we had already witnessed in
Sydney were now being re-enacted in Melbourne, but under more
poignant conditions. The destruction of the oil fuel reserves had
made the strictest conservation of what remained imperative. For
rich and poor alike the only means of flight lay with the
railways, and in the rush for safety panic overcame reason. The
Government recognised the advantage of scattering the population
of Melbourne as widely as possible. The concentration of food
supplies in the city had become a desperate problem, and the
destruction of the sewerage system was causing consternation.
Every detail of rail transport that could be used was drawn upon
to meet the demands of the clamouring crowds that besieged the
railway stations.</p>

<p>On the Monday every available man in uniform was called out in
an attempt to control the crowds that concentrated at Spencer
street and Flinders street. Here we saw the scenes of the panic-
stricken crowds at Moss Vale magnified a thousandfold. Trains of
either passenger carriages or goods trucks were mobbed in the
yards regardless of their destination. The only mercy was that no
bombing planes appeared. Short of firing into the crowds there
was no way of holding them. Our battalion was simply lost in such
a throng.</p>

<p>By midday the scattered units were assembled and rushed to
North Melbourne. Here we were given charge of an empty train that
was backed into No 1 platform at Spencer street, where a crowd of
women and children had been assembled. Our orders were to protect
the train from the mob and allow no one to enter it except from
the platform.</p>

<p>That train ran through the yards at a speed of about 12 miles
an hour. But nothing deterred the wild horde that had swarmed
everywhere. During the few minutes of its passage we had to beat
of the waves of men that tried to rush it at the risk of their
lives. We used the butts of our rifles without mercy to knock
those off who succeeded in obtaining a hold, on the trucks. When
the train stopped and the truck doors were opened for the women
the train was rushed from the other side. For a wild ten minutes
the troops fought a surging, yelling mob that attempted to storm
the train. We drove down with our rifle butts on clutching hands,
or at times into cursing faces. Then they began to pelt us with
ballast metal. Shots began to ring from the trucks, then&mdash;no
order was given&mdash;the men fixed bayonets and used them.</p>

<p class="caption">

</div>
<br>

<p>By this time the train was packed with its load of screaming,
hysterical women, so that we could scarcely find room to move,
and the train started. Even then the mob of men were still trying
to get a foothold.</p>

<p>Well beyond the road bridge over the North Melbourne station
the train pulled up long enough for the troops to climb down.
Twice more we carried out the same manoeuvre. But learning from
our experience, we lined the trucks with our bayonets fixed and
magazines charged. Still it was a nasty job as we were pelted
through the yards by mobs of men who yelled savage threats and
insults on us.</p>

<p>During the next two days thousands of people were transported
to country districts and various towns down the Western and
Gippsland systems, where local authorities organised shelter and
food for the refugees, who were, in the majority of instances,
completely destitute. Probably the gravest effects of the
national crises were in the loosening of the bonds of authority.
In New South Wales civil administration and control ceased to
exist. There was a state of anarchy, in which the strong, and
generally the most unscrupulous, elements came to the surface. It
was a condition of national <i>'Sauve qui peut,'</i> in which the
ordinary decencies of life were lost. There were, however, for
the honour of Australia, some splendid exceptions. In both
Victoria and New South Wales the railway-men stood to their
posts, so long as there was a post to stand by. Demonstrations of
individual heroism were magnificent. Again and again in New South
Wales railway-men threw their lives away to delay the march of
the enemy. They stuck by their work to help the despatch of
refugees, and to attempt to wreck enemy transport, though they
knew their lives were forfeited. So long as there was a chance to
move a train, or if necessary to destroy one, they took it
without hesitation.</p>

<p>Everywhere, too, the police carried on in total disregard of
their own safety. In Sydney during the terrible hours of Bloody
Saturday hundreds of them died in their attempts to bring order
among the panic stricken traffic. When the bombardment was over
they were among the first to give aid to the injured. So it was
in Victoria, and especially in Melbourne, , the Force was
foremost in trying to aid and direct a panic-stricken people.
Again, during the terror of the bombing on the Sunday, there were
those among the people of all grades of society who went to the
aid of the injured among the burning buildings. With them were
medical men. who organised emergency hospitals, and worked
desperately to alleviate the sufferings of the broken people who
were gathered by the volunteer helpers.</p>

<p>By Monday the range of the authority of the Federal Government
was confined to Victoria and South Australia. By no means in
their power could they offer any aid to Tasmania. and for all
practical purposes Queensland was as completely isolated as
Western Australia. In the three disastrous days since we had left
New South Wales the invaders had tightened their stranglehold,
and had terrorised the entire eastern side of the State into
submission. They left a trail of death and desolation wherever
they passed.</p>

<p>This inexorable cruelty was evidently prompted not only by
their policy of relentless intimidation, but also to prevent any
possibility of organised hostility in their rear. Though by
October 3 it was learned in Melbourne that reinforcements had
been landed both at Newcastle and Sydney the invaders in their
advance south had a long line of communication to guard. Their
ruthlessness was therefore a military necessity to enable them to
hold their line with the smallest possible demands on their
numerical strength. They were faced too, with the urgency of
forcing a military decision at the earliest possible moment
Rather than allow time for Australia to strengthen her trained
army they were determined to force the issue by advancing into
Victoria.</p>

<p>One of the bitter incidents of those days was the reply of the
Government of the United States to a second and detailed
representation from the Federal Government on the massacres of
civilians in the occupied districts. The Cambasian Ambassador at
Washington had presented a reply from his Government to the
effect that the allegations of the Australian Government were
malicious and baseless falsehoods. The Cambasian Government had
regretted the necessity for military action, although it did not
regard itself as being at war with the Commonwealth. The
Cambasian Expeditionary Force was an unavoidable protest against
repeated acts of harsh trade discrimination against Cambasia.
Also they had no option but to secure similar right of migration
to those afforded to European countries. Reports from the
Commander-in-chief of the Expeditionary Force asserted that in no
instance had civilians been harshly treated, and that civilians
in the occupied areas had accepted the presence of Cambasians as
benevolent. On the other hand the Cambasians had every right to
protest against repeated acts of murder by civilians of Cambasian
outposts. In these instances the military authorities had been
obliged to make salutary examples. The Government of the United
States had accepted the assurance of the Cambasian Government
that any violence offered to inoffensive civilians by their
troops would be severely punished.</p>

<p>That there was one grain of truth in that bitter pill made it
all the more difficult to swallow. As the wave of refugees spread
westward, the stories of savagery they told excited the men of
the western towns to fury. In a day or two independent bodies of
irregular defenders were organised. They were men from the
country towns and the stations outback. Many of them were
'Diggers,' and all were at home in the saddle. Used to fire-arms,
well mounted, and with a thorough knowledge of the country, these
small raiding troops closed on the flanks of the invaders. By the
end of the first week down the long line of advance, they
ambushed and sniped day and night. Their strength lay in their
mobility. They struck and scattered, and regathered and struck
again, giving the invaders no rest and no quarter.</p>

<p>Communications through the west of New South Wales kept the
Government fully informed of the enemy's advance south, and when
the news of the opening of guerrilla tactics reached headquarter,
trained officers were despatched to provide the Irregulars with
arms and munitions and to co-ordinate their activities. But while
they exacted stern vengeance, and harassed the fringe of the
advance, the resistance had come too late to stem the tide. By
Monday the united forces from Sydney and Port Kembla, working
down by rail and road, had reached Albury through Gundagai and
Wagga. They had collected an enormous, train of motor transport,
and every road leading towards Albury was infested with their
troops. Their progress was marked by the smoke of burning towns
and homesteads.</p>

<p>Late on Tuesday afternoon their advance guards entered Corowa.
At each place the bridges over the Murray to Wodonga and
Wahgunyah had been destroyed. It was here, too, that they met
their first military opposition from the mounted rifle regiments
that fiercely contested their efforts at building pontoon
bridges. At this juncture the enemy's advance was ahead of their
artillery, but their light tanks and armoured cars swept the
south bank of the river to cover their engineers.</p>

<p>But early on Wednesday morning all resistance to their
crossing was crushed when a hail of shrapnel and gas shells swept
over the river from the batteries that had been rushed to both
towns during the previous night. At Wahgunyah the mounted
riflemen fell back down the Rutherglen road, harassing the enemy
advance from the vineyards that were already showing sufficient
green to give them cover. They left the little village burning,
but still hung on to the flanks of the enemy, whose progress they
could not halt.</p>

<p>So it was on the Wednesday. October 4, eleven days after the
first raid, that under cover of their artillery, the invaders
entered Victoria at two points thirty miles apart. At the same
time a force took possession of the causeway of the Hume dam.
Thus they were provided with three lines of advance&mdash;or of
retreat should the need arise.</p>

<p>From then onward, as they advanced with methodical steadiness
down the line of the Hume Highway, they passed through an empty
country from which every human being and every source of food had
been systematically cleared. As they moved forward, too, their
movements were harassed on both flanks by men who had gathered
from townships, ranges, and plains. Rifles and ammunition had
been distributed through scores of centres on both sides of the
highway to all who applied. In every town and settlement eager
men rallied to the call; the call to which for years they had
closed their ears. They had refused to believe in the possibility
of a threat against their country and the threat had become a
desperate fact. Now they were called to answer for their
indolence and indifference by an enemy within their gates,
already victorious without having fought one battle.</p>

<p>There was no lack of courage among them. Every man was burning
to avenge the savagery that had been perpetrated on his people.
Now, as they closed down on the line of march they threw their
lives away with reckless bravery. They attacked in groups or
singly. They met the disciplined detachments of flank guards with
guerrilla bushcraft that took bloody toll. But as they harried
the enemy from the ground so were they harried from the air. All
day the enemy planes circled over the advancing army, swooping
down at every burst of rifle fire and drenching every attack with
machine-gun bullets. But at night, with their complete knowledge
of the country to guide them, the irregulars closed in, rushing
outpost or whole battalions indiscriminately, wherever they
touched on the highway. Nevertheless their impetuous courage
lacked cohesion. They were learning too late, and at terrible
cost, that courage was no substitute for discipline in war. The
vast, well-equipped machine that moved forward with irresistible
force could not be held back by flesh and blood and courage
alone. Each day saw the spearhead of the enemy 20 miles farther
south-east. Five days after crossing the Murray they were past
Euroa. That was on Monday October 9.</p>

<p>At Melbourne the situation of both Government and military
authorities alike was tragic. It was symptomatic of the panic
that a bewildered people, with the ruin of their country suddenly
thrust, into their faces, should demand victims. They would not
recognise then, as most of them did later, that, to use the words
of General MacKinnon, they were reaping a 'fools' harvest.'</p>

<p>They had elected successive Government, and had themselves
tied their hands by insisting on vast expenditure for social
services. They had, too, followed the lead of a noisy pacifist
minority in objecting to paying the price of an adequate
insurance policy in the form of defence measures.</p>

<p>By the end of the first week Melbourne itself was too panic-
stricken and too intent on deserting the city to take concerted
action. But in the large provincial cities vociferous orators at
public meetings were demanding the resignation of the Government.
There were as many crazy proposals for the establishment of a
Council of Safety as there were crazy orators. All had plans to
save a country that they could not recognise was beyond
salvation. They largely demanded the immediate creation of
armies&mdash;probably on the dragons' teeth system.</p>

<p>That old Latin tag about the gods driving mad those whom they
wished to destroy seemed to create especially for Australia. I
had been through most of the terror of that first week. I had not
seen a single enemy soldier. Instead of sinking party doctrines
and offering a united front to the invaders the entire body
politic had been torn by internal conflicts. Even on that Monday
morning, with the enemy within striking distance of Seymour,
Mackinnon was asked to leave an infantry battalion in Melbourne
for fear of civil disorder.</p>

<p>Fools' harvest!</p>

<p>All that week we three remained with our headquarters in
Melbourne. Twice each day we drove to Seymour and back with loads
of munitions and supplies for the troops. Great reserve dumps of
supplies had been built up at Tallarook and other places near the
lines. And there were others at Kilmore. At Kilmore, too, a large
field hospital had been established. I learned this through
Fergus's persistence in wangling loads to Kilmore. At that time
the postal service had broken down completely, and it had taken
him three days before he could establish contact with Lynda. He
kept Bob Clifford and me in a state of amused amazement at the
magnitude of his barefaced mendacity in explaining his delays to
irate transport officers. I am afraid we shared some reflected
glory by being called upon to support some of his major
inaccuracies.</p>

<p>We heard the hospital end of the story from an ex-M.O. in a
cowshed somewhere near the Eildon Weir about six weeks later.
From his account Lynda's explanations of her absence from duty
were, in quality, superior to those of Fergus. By that time we
three had picked up too much information to be under any
illusions regarding the outcome of the fight that we knew must
take place within the next few days. The men at Seymour with whom
we came into contact were sound to a man and eager to meet the
invaders. One point that puzzled everyone was that Mackinnon's
force had not been raided from the air. Neither had Melbourne
been visited again since that Sunday afternoon. The immunity of
the army was all the more remarkable, because for several days
enemy planes had been reconnoitring as far back as
Donnybrook.</p> <br>

<p class="footnote">[Marsden relates that the enemy were short of
bombs because a large supply had been lost on one of the ships
sunk by the Air Force off Port Kembla on September 27. The large
quantities used on Melbourne were not replaced by fresh supplies
until October 9. &mdash;Eds.]</p>

<p><br> After reaching Creighton, four miles south of Euroa, on
October 10, the enemy halted to concentrate his forces. Until
that day the weather had been uniformly fine and clear. But on
October 10 heavy clouds from the south foreshadowed the coming
break.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of Wednesday, October 11, the rain began.
Twice on the Tuesday Mackinnon threw his precious force of seven
bombers on the enemy's concentration. It lost one plane for each
raid, but we had the satisfaction of knowing that they inflicted
an amount of damage that justified the loss. However, one effect,
was to incite retaliation.</p>

<p>The enemy planes were out in force on the Wednesday morning,
and vindictively shed bombs over Mackinnon's position round
Seymour. The situation, however, had been ably anticipated. By
skilful camouflage buttery and troop positions had been
concealed, and the enemy wasted tons of bombs on dummy artillery
positions and unoccupied ground. Scarcely any real damage was
done. But the A.S.C. was not so lucky.</p>

<p>The brutes came buzzing down the highway in the pelting,
driving rain, with a cold wind that had turned spring back to
winter They swept down through the scudding clouds, and, flying
low, tormented the transport waggons with machine-gun fire.</p>

<p>I had taken on a load of meat and was the leading waggon of
four. When we passed through Kilmore the rain was coming down in
torrents and the hills were wreathed in mist. We were a little
beyond where the Mclvor road branches when one of those infernal
dragonflies roared down out of nowhere. Ahead through the rain
was a stretch of timber-lined road completely arched by the
trees. But before we reached the shelter there was a savage
stutter of fire and my cabin roof broke into holes. Why the
bullets missed me I accepted as a providential mystery. Before
the brute could turn and come again I shot into the long green
tunnel. Half way along the shelter the road was blocked by a
dozen or fifteen waggons. Their drivers were saying things about
aircraft and machine-guns that were unfit for print. Looking
back, I saw that only two of the other waggons had reached the
cover. The third had barged off the load and collided with a
tree. We found later that the body of the driver had been
riddled. It was then I learned that there were three enemy
planes, and they all knew that we were playing possum in the
trees.</p>

<p>After an interval of about ten minutes, during which we could
hear them weaving about above us, they came roaring down the
outside of the avenue, raking it blind from end to end as they
swept past. We all crouched behind our waggons and were showered
with leaves and twigs and small branches as the bullets searched
the timber. They repeated the performance several times before
barging off towards Kilmore where they apparently saw better
game.</p>

<p>But the transport work that day was hectic, and more than 50
waggons were ditched along the road. That night orders were given
to reload at once and to take the road again at 1 o'clock to the
morning, so as to get up the road, under cover if darkness. So it
happened that on the morning of Thursday, October 13, I was
passing under the railway bridge at the Seymour station just at
daybreak. I had turned into the road to the east side of the
station. Then to the distance I heard the sound of artillery fire
ahead. Almost at the same moment I saw the flashes of bursting
shells halt a mile to the west of the town. Those were the first
shots in the only battle of a war that was not a war.</p>

<p>It was a foul day following a foul night. The wind from the
south blew a gale. All night along the road we had passed through
a succession of rain squalls. It was a cutting, dank wind. The
low driving clouds that touched the hilltops hid every glimpse of
the sun as the slow grey light came.</p>

<p>During the whole of that bitter day end the following night
the rain scarcely ceased for half an hour at a time. Underfoot
the ground was sodden, and in level spots the water lay in
puddles and sheets. That long day of red conflict would have been
agonising in any circumstances. But every tragic moment of it was
made more poignant by the misery of rain and wind. What happened
in detail I do not know.</p>

<p>They came down from Mangalore by both the Murchison and Hume
highways and swarming through the rolling timber-scattered
country between. Their left flank was beyond the Hume highway,
and their right on the Goulburn. Those first guns I heard had
opened fire at six o'clock, and for a while there was silence.
Then suddenly the whole of the country to the north belched fire,
and our batteries, first from the west of the Goulburn and then
to the north of the town, joined in the hellish chorus. For more
than two hours that pandemonium reigned unbroken before I heard
the sharper note of rifle fire. In those early hours planes
dodged in and out of the low-lying cloud roof from the fire of
anti-aircraft guns. We knew what was left of our air force was in
the thick of it.</p>

<p>Half a dozen times in the growing daylight we saw wrecked
machines hurtle down through the mists to earth and destruction.
Again and again, through blinding squalls we caught glimpses of
pursuer and pursued flash into sight and vanish. No doubt someone
higher up knew what was taking place as the hours went by. But I
think that few of the lower ranks knew anything except what was
going on within 20 yards of where they stood. My own impression
was of shells searching roads with hellish malignity, of carrying
on with a dazed incomprehension, and of wondering how anything
human, much less myself, remained unscathed.</p>

<p>As the day wore on the first tension gave way to a kind of
drugged indifference born of biting cold and acute physical
misery. I remember that my first knowledge of the enemy's
victorious pressure came when I realised that their shells were
falling far beyond the town. That must have been sometime about
midday&mdash;I had lost all count of time. The town was blazing
in a dozen places. Then I remember coming up from a dump beyond
the Sunny Creek bridge, and a sergeant with a smoke-blackened
face and scorched uniform told me the town bridge had been
wrecked, and directed me up the road towards Northwood. A minute
later I crawled out from the wreckage of my waggon, mildly
astonished that I was unharmed. Luckily for me the shell that
overturned me burst under my back wheels instead of in front.</p>

<br>

<p>Here in our camp of slavery, men who were at Seymour that grim
October day of 1939 sometimes argue over what Mackinnon should
have done or should not have done. Even now they cannot see that
it was neither the enemy the weather, nor any other factor of the
day that defeated him. The battle was lost nearly 20 years
earlier. It was lost when the country was fooled into the belief
that here would be no more wars. It was that imbecility that sent
him to face a trained, efficient and highly equipped army with
half-trained men, and without any reserves on which he could
draw. The wonder of it is that those raw ranks held on as long
and as splendidly as they did&mdash;some almost mutinied when
ordered to fall back&mdash;and even then they went back snarling
and biting.</p>

<p>The story of how the 21st end 32nd battalions held up the
enemy while their guns got through when they were outflanked,
would have redeemed a more tragic day. I saw the little handful
of 12 men and one corporal, all that remained, and he last of the
infantry to cross the Sunday Creek bridge before it was blown up.
They marched across in fours with the corporal at their head,
regardless of the warning that the bridge was going up. Then when
they reached the south side at his order they doubled to the
right, and throwing themselves among the scrub on the high bank
blazed into the road and the paddocks over which the enemy were
advancing.</p>

<p>We did not know until the following day that Mackinnon and
half his staff had been killed late in the afternoon when
headquarters at Tallarook had been bombed from the air. I never
saw him, but from what they told of him I think he would have
accepted his fate gladly. A Napoleon could not have succeeded
where he failed.</p>

<p>The road down from Sunday Creek to Tallarook was almost
deserted as the darkness began to fall. The artillery&mdash;what
was left of it&mdash; had gone on ahead and was shelling the
enemy advance from farther back. Most of the infantry were
marching well clear of the road, on which shells were falling as
the enemy artillery searched for the retreat. The rain was still
falling, though the wind had dropped. There was very little order
until Tallarook was reached and some attempt was made to sort out
the scattered units. At that time Gray, who had succeeded
Mackinnon in command, was still holding together what was left,
perhaps 4,000 men all told. The field kitchens were in being, and
most of the men bad some kind of hot meal. It must have been
about 8 o'clock when the last train, loaded with wounded, left
the Tallarook station. Men came straggling in up till 10 o'clock.
One man I spoke to about that time told me that be did not think
the enemy had passed Sunday Creek.</p>

<p>It was sheer luck that threw me in with Clifford and Fergus
that night when I found a damaged waggon about a quarter of a
mile down the Pyalong road&mdash;its hard deck was less sloppy
than the soaked ground, and Fergus had taken possession. I had
seen neither of them all day, But their luck had been much like
my own. Dog weary, despite an occasional shell, we slept until we
were ordered out towards daylight.</p>

<p>No one who lived through that next day, as we fell back
towards Kilmore, will ever forget it. The roads were blocked
wherever possible by blasting trees across them to hamper enemy's
mechanised transport. The retreating force kept off the roads for
cover from the aircraft that harried us every step of the way. We
three kept together and moved down parallel to an old road that
runs to Kilmore about two miles west of the highway. Fortunately
the weather cleared and the sun dried our soaked uniforms</p>

<p>Our artillery must have ceased to exist early that morning,
because the enemy aircraft gave the guns no rest. But from every
patch of cover for mile on each side of the road, the retreating
infantry sniped as they went back. There was little organisation
or order. They knew they were hopelessly beaten, but every man
clung to his rifle as his last hope. They knew only too well that
it was all over, but still, wherever an enemy showed, they hit
back viciously. But there was no longer any army, and hope had
gone.</p>

<p>It took us six hours to cover those 16 miles in to Kilmore, on
which all I roads of retreat converged&mdash;and the enemy planes
had been before us. The long tree-lined street was in ruins, and
among them were the wrecks of I transport and ambulance waggons
that had been caught in the choke road. Our one thought all the
way down had been of Lynda. It was here we saw how complete was
the disintegration. The one objective of the men as they came in
was to break away from the line of the enemy's advance down the
highway. We knew that at the best the enemy would enter the town
within an hour or two. Our anxiety was increased by the news that
the field hospital and a train load of wounded that was leaving
the station had been bombed during the morning. In the general
confusion it was some time before we were able to learn that the
wounded who survived had been taken to the old police station,
one of the few undamaged buildings. Here, eventually, we found
Lynda in a warm argument with an irate M.O.</p>

<p>Knowing of the Imminence of the enemy's arrival, he had
evacuated the few wounded left, and had sent all the nurses with
them. He had learned only an we came in that Lynda had evaded his
order. He was telling her in plain language the fate of women in
occupied territory. Fortunately, he was more a doctor than a
soldier, and accepted without hostility the interference of three
very dirty and dishevelled transport drivers. He watched the
unceremonious greeting between Fergus and his rebellious
subordinate with a surprised smile. It was a greeting that made
explanation unnecessary.</p>

<p>Said he. 'Perhaps, young man, you can make this mutinous young
baggage listen to reason.' Fergus grinned. 'I've done It before
now. What's the trouble, sir?'</p>

<p>'She refuses to leave because there may be more wounded
brought in, and we'll have the enemy here in no time.'</p>

<p>'Well,' protested Lynda, 'there may be more.'</p>

<p>'Crazy!' snapped the doctor. 'Get her out of this!'</p>

<p>'There'll be no more wounded, Lyn,' Fergus assured her.
'You'll have to go&mdash;that is if there is anything to get,
away in.'</p>

<p>The doctor looked us over. 'My car is parked at the back. It
will take us all. You boys had better come too.'</p>

<p>'If there is no one with a better right?' asked Fergus. 'But
we'd be glad to go.'</p>

<p>'Dash it all,' the doctor said. 'It's a case of every man for
himself now. Come on!' He led the way. There was a big double-
seater in the yard, into which we piled with the doctor at the
wheel. At he turned into the street I noticed a stack of
ammunition boxes, and asked him to stop I jumped out. and
hurriedly placed one of them in the luggage carrier. We had done
a bit of firing that morning, but our belts were not empty.</p>

<p>'What's the idea,' demanded the MO. as I hopped in again
beside him. As we raced down the road I gave him the sketch of
our experiences during the previous three weeks and added. 'So
you see, it struck me that a case of cartridges might be
useful.'</p>

<p>That was how Dr. Ben Cornish came into our lives. Ho was about
50 years of age. He was lean as a ferret and as keen; and as warm
hearted as he was irascible. We and many others lived to bless
the day that we met the man who was afterwards worshipped under
the name of 'Dynamite Ben.'</p>

<p>When he heard our story he turned round to Lynda and said,
'Well, my dear, if I had been given the choice it four people to
pick up it would l-lave been you and your three musketeers.'</p>

<p>Then he turned back to his driving. We swept down an empty
road through Wallan and Beveridge with the needle of the
speedometer flickering at 50. Over the open country we saw
occasional groups of men plodding westward. As we reached the
tree-lined road at Donnybrook overlooking that vast saucer of
quiet country between there and Craigieburn, we saw another car
making towards us, and losing no time, Dr. Ben slowed down.</p>

<p>'Wonder who this lunatic can be?' he growled. 'Must be cracked
or he wouldn't be coming this way.'</p>

<p>He stopped the car as the other came up. In it was a man, and
apparently his wife, with two young girls. They all looked badly
scared. From the story they told Dr. Ben, they had some cause for
looking scared. They had stuck to their home in Melbourne until
that morning. He said the people who remained in the city had
gone crazy. The news of the defeat at Seymour had leaked out, and
with it had come utter demoralisation. There had been some
demonstration against the Government and that a Committee of
Public Safety claimed to take over the administration. There was
rioting, and no trace of authority. Our informant had owned a
filling station, and had retained enough petrol with which to
escape. He had run the gauntlet of panic-stricken people who
tried to capture his car. Bullet-shattered windows bore witness
to the truth of his stories. He had heard that the provincial
cities were also demanding some new form of government but that
there was no unanimity of ideas. But in Melbourne itself there
was anarchy and chaos. He was making for Yea, where he had
friends, through Whittlesea. Then he turned east for the high
road, still losing no time.</p>

<p>Dr. Ben turned round to Lynda.</p>

<p>'Well, we're all in this. What will we do? It seems to me that
Melbourne is off.'</p>

<p>'So far as we're concerned. Major,' Lynda informed him, 'we're
four waifs. We've no home, no friends, or belongings except the
clothes we are wearing. We're like the cat that walked by itself,
all places are alike to us. What about you?'</p>

<p>'I'm a lone wolf,' he laughed, taking up Lynda's excursion
into Kipling. "I've neither kith nor kin, and when our Cambasian
friends get to Melbourne, if my house is still standing. I won't
want to live in it.'</p>

<p>'As t see it,' Bob said, 'the war's over and Australia is down
and out. The only thing we can do is to take to the bush, and
wait to see what turns up. It may be tough, but be tougher if we
run into their hands.'</p>

<p>'We leave it to you, Major,' put in Fergus, 'but I agree with
Clifford.'</p>

<p>Dr. Ben turned to me.</p>

<p>'I'm with the others, now and always. We may have to rough it,
but it is the best we can do.'</p>

<p>'It's tragic.' Dr Ben spoke thoughtfully. 'But I'm afraid you
young people are right. We're all blotted out! Done! Wiped out!'
Then, after a moment's pause. ''Those vermin behind us will be
too busy digging in to find time to pay much attention to the
outside country places. And something might turn up to pull us
out of the hole.'</p>

<p>'Major,' I asked, 'do you know of any place, small and out of
the way, with good bush country near it for refuge if
necessary?'</p>

<p>He thought a moment, and his face lighted up.</p>

<p>'By Jove! the very place! I'll tell you as we go,' he said as
he turned the car east towards Whittlesea.</p>

<p>As we went he told us of a fishing resort in the mountains
about 100 miles away, and 40 beyond Alexandra.</p>

<p>'If you young people will make me a member of your gallant
company, then I'm with you! Gladly! We've enough petrol to make
it.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

<p class="first">ALTHOUGH we did not know it then, that decision
we five made that afternoon on the empty highway at Donnybrook
was typical of the disintegration of a nation. On Thursday.
October 13, the social and administrative fabric of Australia was
torn to shreds. The Australians were no longer a nation. They
were a conquered race, without government and without cohesion or
a rallying point. Law, order, discipline, and moral had
collapsed. There were some 7,000,000 people spread over the
country, leaderless and helpless.</p>

<p>In the world without there was no hand raised to help us. We
were the spoils of war to an arrogant Power. Europe was one vast
battle-ground, Britain, our sole hope, was barely holding her own
against overwhelming odds. India was in flames. In Canada there
was a warm appeal for aid for the stricken sister Dominion, but
where there were the men and the will, the seas were in the
enemy's hands.</p>

<p>Then, too, our conquerors had begun to put into effect that
policy of preventing news of what was being done here from being
spread abroad. They set in motion that propaganda machine that
spread round the world, when it was quiet enough to hear, that
vile tradition of the anarchy, cruelty, and treachery that we
never lived down.</p>

<p>They understood thoroughly the psychological value of the
saying that a lie will go half-way round the world while the
truth is pulling on its boots. With devilish ingenuity they
filled the American Press with sensational stories of Australian
cowardice, cruelty, and treachery. They told of their necessity
to take over its government for the sake of humanity, because
they found the Commonwealth In a state of utter anarchy. They
told how their kindly and considerate rule had been met with
barbaric murders and tortures of their people that would shame a
savage. They told those stories with a wealth of circumstantial
detail, and inventive genius, that was as brilliant as it was
foul. Their half-truths were worse than their pure mendacity.
They alleged that at the battle of Seymour 100,000 Australians
had broken and fled, with scarcely any casualties, before 10,000
Cambasians.</p> <br>

<p class="footnote">[There is a total absence of official figures
regarding the battle of Seymour on both sides that is
significant. The Paramount Power made a point of destroying all
Australian archives of every description. Marsden estimates that
Mackinnon could have had very few more than 12,000 men at his
disposal on October 12, 1939. It is probable that the Cambasians
had at least 20,000 on the field. Mackinnon's field artillery was
outranged, and his air force had been almost used up before the
battle. Burton's estimate that only 4,000 men fell back on
Tallarook on the night of the battle is probably fair. One
sinister aspect of the battle was that no estimates of wounded on
either side have been given. Most of the Australians must have
been left on the field. Their fate has never been referred to by
the Paramount Power. &mdash;Eds.]</p>

<p><br> It must be admitted that so far as Melbourne was
concerned there was justification for their allegations of the
anarchy they found when they entered what they regarded as the
official seat of government. From several people I have heard
varying accounts of what occurred when the news of the disaster
at Seymour became known.</p>

<p>Despite the exodus that had been going on since the bombing on
October 7 and 8 there were probably more than half a million
people still left in the metropolitan area. But these were more
demoralised than those who had left, because of the certainty of
occupation by the enemy within a few days. News of the treatment
of civilians in occupied towns in New South Wales had spread. The
stories of enemy atrocities could scarcely have been magnified
from the truth. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that
panic reigned and that the terrified inhabitants lost their
heads, and that there were deplorable excesses committed in
consequence. So far as I have been able to learn there was no
really organised insurrection against the Government. What
occurred was caused by irresponsible hotheads with no real
following, who made demands as crazy as themselves, but who,
unfortunately, were listened to by terrified people who were
easily led. There must have been a score of these self-appointed
geniuses, all claiming to be able to save the country. The police
force was entirely inadequate to keep such crowds as gathered
round these orators in control, so that the rioting that ensued
was widespread but actually aimless. It was the natural result of
the breakdown of the entire social structure that occurred. The
demonstrations were bred of fear, and the crowds were beyond
reason and unable to think for themselves. Parliament House was
one objective of this mob animosity, and the members of the
Government were obliged to escape from the blind wrath as best
they could.</p>

<p>One of the redeeming features of the disaster was the gallant
attempt made by Labour leaders and Trades Hall officials to stem
the flood of demoralisation. They recognised the futility of
divided counsel at such a crisis, and loyally tried to reason
with infuriated mobs who would listen to anything but reason.
Several of them lost their lives in trying to turn the rioters
aside from their folly. The fratricidal madness had become
completely out of hand.</p>

<p>When the enemy finally took possession of the city on Sunday,
October 15, it was in a chaotic stale. They entered from Coburg,
Essendon. and Preston. and worked inward methodically.
Unfortunately the conditions they found were some excuse for the
drastic measures they took to restore order. The same folly that
was at the root of the disorder incited some of the rioters to
fire on the advance of the enemy, who responded with merciless
reprisals. Herein lay the bitterest aspect of the tragedy. In the
temporary capital of Australia the invaders alleged that there
was no authority from whom they could accept surrender, or to
whom they could dictate terms. The real administration that had
been dispersed approached the commander-in-chief, but he declined
to recognise them. In the circumstances the Cambasians took over
the government and enforced their own laws and regulations, which
they made by proclamation. Meanwhile, as all organised military
opposition had been crushed, they proceeded systematically to
make good their occupation.</p>

<p>In exactly three weeks from striking the first blow they were
in practical possession of the whole Commonwealth. They knew they
had ample time to complete their plans and to consolidate their
position. Britain was powerless, to help and Europe was too busy
to interfere. The United States was fooled by the most foul and
unscrupulous propaganda. Every possible outlet of news to the
world outside was stopped.</p>

<p>By continuing their policy of frightfulness they occupied the
salient points and the capitals and large provincial cities.
These they were enabled to hold with small but efficient and
ruthless forces. Regulations In the cities and larger towns
forbade an Australian to walk on the footpaths, to be in the
streets after dark, or to engage in any occupation without
licence. The slightest infringement of a regulation was punished
summarily by death without trial and on the spot. Men, for not
raising their hats to a Cambasian officer, were shot dead in the
streets. The whole aim of the policy was to terrorise the people
into abject submission.</p>

<p>The commander-in-chief of the invading army, now known as the
Paramount Power, made no excuse for the barbarity. He claimed
that he had 7,000,000 lawless people to deal with, end he was
justified in adopting all measures he thought fit to safeguard the
country's interests. After the debacle the Paramount Power set
about dealing especially with Queensland and Tasmania, from which
no opposition could be expected. Month after month transports
carried thousands of peasants and working people south. They
began at the north of Australia, working from Cooktown down the
coast. First came a military force to spread terror through the
district. Then came the transports with the Cambasian workers,
who took over the plantations and farms. Wherever an Australian
could be captured he was sent to work on the land for the
invaders practically in a state of slavery.</p>

<p>So thoroughly was this methodical invasion carried out that by
the end of 1941, two years later, when the Berlin Congress was
held, three plenipotentiaries of the Paramount Power attended as
representatives of the Government of Australia. In the two years
between the Commonwealth was systematically gutted of any natural
wealth to which the Paramount Power took a fancy.</p>

<p>Worse still, the gutting was done by the Australians
themselves, who worked the coalmines, the goldfields, the farms
and orchards, and sheep and cattle stations. Coal, wool, wheat,
iron and other minerals were torn out by their rightful owners
working under the supervision of the Paramount Power and shipped
out of the country. This programme of suppression, however, was
not carried out peacefully. Until the Congress of Berlin it is
safe to say that outside the cities and the large provincial
towns the writ of the Paramount Power did not run beyond a rifle
shot. It would have taken an army of 1,000,000 men to enforce
their rule absolutely.</p>

<p>Scattered all ever Australia were thousands of men who became
outlaws, and whose sole aim in life was vengeance. At first
barely half of them were armed. Gradually, however, this was
altered, and from north to south Australia was overrun with some
of the most desperate and ruthless bands of guerrilla fighters
whereof the world holds record. Most of them were men bred in the
country and bush who knew their districts as a man knows the palm
of his hand. Before long the city folk who had gone 'bush' became
equally dangerous to the Paramount Power.</p>

<p>In this guerrilla warfare no quarter was given or asked. It
developed with the most coldblooded and ruthless killing without
mercy. It was this that furnished the Paramount Power with
material for its propaganda in the world outside on Australian
atrocities. Of it I can say this, that we did fall to the level
of trying to emulate the barbarity of the Paramount Power, but we
were never able to equal their sheer fiendish ferocity of
reprisals.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that when the invaders entered Victoria
all the livestock in their line of march was driven east into the
ranges as the safest place for them. Thousand of sheep and cattle
were allowed to run loose. A similar policy was adopted in that
organised military resistance had the other States when it was
known collapsed. For this reason the bush and the ranges were
full of stock that had, perforce, been abandoned to run wild
because they were either ownerless or because their owners had
means of using them of profiting from them.</p>

<p>It was these that provided the guerrilla bands with food and,
in the end, clothing. Doubtless there were thousands of
people&mdash; especially women and children&mdash;among the
ranges near Melbourne, and others who had fled from the large
cities who perished from hunger and exposure. Those who forced by
privation surrendered themselves to the Paramount Power had
reason to wish they had not stayed where they were and died.
These poor dupes were in many cases lured from safe hiding places
by promises of safety and protection that were never honoured in
letter or spirit.</p>

<p>Those, however wino took to the bush in the country districts
developed a style of hard living and swift thinking that enabled
them to become almost as much a terror to the Paramount Power as
the Paramount Power was to them. They became, both men and women,
as hard as nails. Their bushcraft developed in a school where an
ill-learned lesson or a mistake meant certain death. They
established contact with their brethren in bondage in the rural
districts. Such a perfect system of secret communication was
established that the enemy could make no move that was not
immediately known to the guerrillas. Though against this the
Paramount Power had the advantage of a highly organised military
force with motor transport and an omnipresent air force, during
those two savage years they mare little or no impression on the
guerrilla warfare.</p>

<p>Of course there were heartbreaking disasters, but for every
life they took a merciless toll was exacted. If the history of
those two years could be written in full it would form one of the
most exciting records of adventure and bloodshed ever written.
Some of those guerrilla troops became legendary from the daring
of their deeds.</p>

<p>On several occasions I fell in with the famous 'Dumbell'
Wright, whose headquarters were near Beechworth, and who harried
the country from Wangaratta to Albury with tireless audacity. It
was he who immortalised himself by hanging the Paramount Power's
military Governor of Victoria within sight of Wangaratta. The
generally accepted story about 'Dumbell' was that he was, or had
been, a clergyman of some denomination which objected to shedding
blood. But this was not true, for on one occasion Clifford and I
were with him in a raid in which he did not exhibit the slightest
repugnance to using a bayonet be acquired from a Cambasian
soldier.</p>

<p>His name was due to a weapon he invariably carried. It was
made of a 2lb. dumbell broken across the shank. The broken shank
was fitted into a short length of rubber hose pipe and tightly
wired. Used with Dumbell's strength and dexterity that waddy
became a terrific weapon&mdash;all the more effectual because it
was silent. Despite his size he could move with the stealth and
silence of a cat.</p>

<p class="caption">
Used with Dumbell's strength and dexterity that waddy
became a terrific weapon.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>The success of so many of his raids was due to his genius for
'seeing that the sentries were asleep,' to use his own
expression. His technique was to strike with his right hand and
catch the body on his left arm as it fell, so as to prevent
noise. On the night I was with him I saw him get his man but
without a sound, though I was not more than ten feet from
him.</p>

<p>Many of the, raids were organised to obtain arms and
ammunition. Although many of the guerrillas were unarmed, or only
partly armed in the beginning, before three months were over
there were arms and ammunition to spare. These were supplied, not
willingly, by Cambasians. I think 'Dumbell' Wright armed almost
the whole of North-Eastern Victoria&mdash;and a tough crowd they
proved.</p>

<p>In each State there were several outstanding figures. There
was Monty Black, once an artisan in the Lithgow works, who ran
the country between Nowra and the Bulli Pass as far back as Moss
Vale. It was he who captured a visiting Cambasian Prince of the
Blood and exchanged him for twenty of his men who had been
captured. He promised to send him back safe and unharmed, and
did, but with a strange word tattooed on his forehead. Monty's
sense of humour lacked refinement. It was Monty, too, who first
captured machine-guns for his men. But all along the coast up as
far as Cairns the guerrillas held sway.</p>

<p>Outback, where there was less cover, the technique was
different from that of the ranges and the bush, but equally
effectual. There was one Queenslander for whom the Paramount
Power offered a reward of 100,000, alive or dead, and a free
passage out of Australia to any country the traitor liked to
name. There were no takers, though probably from 5,000 to 6,000
people could have claimed that reward. This man, of Danish
extraction, named Neilsen, achieved his distinction by wrecking
five troop trains within the space of three weeks. No doubt the
Paramount Power would be pleased to know he is among the men of
our camp at the steel works, though he does not use his own
name.</p>

<p>But that there were no traitors ever, in those days, despite
temptation, was one of the finest aspects of the game&mdash;and
one of the most appalling.</p>

<p>A favourite method of trying to make a man betray his friends
was to capture a wife or daughter and use her as a form if
torture, as they did Bell's wife a few months ago, here in
Newcastle. Bell did not speak, but he succeeded in killing with
his bare hands the man who gave the orders before he himself was
shot down.</p>

<p>Later, after the Treaty of Berlin had given international
recognition to the occupation by the Paramount Power, the
situation altered. There came a time when we found there were
those among our own people who could bring themselves to betray
their friends. No man knows how he will behave until the moment
of choice comes to himself, and the agents of the Paramount Power
had made a science of creating traitors.</p>

<p>There were some who broke under the strain for whom we could
feel only pity. When the police found they could not obtain
information by tormenting a man or woman they used 'indirect
interrogation.' This euphemism for scientific savagery meant that
the victim, man or woman, was given the alternative of watching
wife, husband, or child treated with unspeakable barbarity or to
answer the questions put to them. Those who would condemn these
people for failing should ask themselves honestly how they would
come through such an ordeal.</p>

<p>We checkmated them by excluding married men from any of the
subversive societies. But there were others. In the universal
misery and drudgery there were some who bought comfort or
privileges by spying. They were grouped under the unlovely name
of 'blowflies.' Sooner or later they were discovered&mdash;and
unpleasant things happened to them under the guise of
accident.</p>

<p>The P.P. were under no illusions about these accidents. They
never admitted their knowledge. But we could always gauge the
value to them of the victim of an 'accident' by the extent to
which conditions were made uncomfortable for us in consequence. A
really good 'blowfly's eradication would give us double shifts
and reduce rations for a month. We knew they knew, and they knew
we knew. But they could not keep faith with their own traitors.
We had more than suspicion for or belief that some of the clues
that led to the discovery of a spy among us were deliberately
placed in our way. They had finished with the man or mistrusted
him.</p>

<p>But during the guerrilla period we did and could trust any one
of our own people. We had one great advantage in that, though
many guerrilla fighters were known by name, they were not known
personally, so that we could, and often did, mix with people in
the towns with safely.</p>

<p>I have seen 'Dumbell' Wright slouch through Wangaratta under
the noses of the P.P. police. He would look like a rag bag and
suffer a kick with a whine&mdash;but he never forgot the face of
the kicker. We never knew the total results of our glorified
bushranging. But the loss of men and materiel to the Paramount
Power must have been enormous. In the north-east of Victoria
alone I do not think 5,000 men to be an overestimate for the two
years.</p> <br>

<p class="footnote">[Marsden's estimate, based on P.P.
admissions, places the figures at 100,000. &mdash;Eds.]</p>

<p><br> There may be some difference of opinion on the ethical
side of this murderous warfare, but it was a question that we
left alone. In any case it was the natural and inevitable outcome
of our defeat. Had even military decencies been observed by the
Paramount Power things might have been different. Had they
exhibited either elementary justice or made some effort at
conciliation, we might have met them half way. But their choice
of that policy of 'frightfulness' with which they began and
continued bred a loathing and disgust that placed them outside of
consideration of humanity.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

<p class="first">WE five little thought when we cut across from
Donnybrook to Whittlesea that afternoon of the strange wild life
for which we were headed. It was dark when we reached Yea, and
strange after our weeks of strain and uncertainty to find the
town in a reasonably normal state. There was both fear and
anxiety, but otherwise the people were untouched by the tragedy.
A few men from the broken army had made their way across from
Tallarook through Kerrisdale, so that the defeat was known. But
they brought he reassuring news that the enemy were not moving in
our direction.</p>

<p>So for that last time in our lives we ate a civilised meal and
slept in civilised beds. From inquiries we learned that the shops
were still doing business. That next morning, as there was no
immediate need for haste, we went shopping. We four still had a
little money, but to our delight Dr. Ben came forward as a fairy
godfather. At a council he urged we should buy essentials for a
rough life, It was he who found the money for tools and thick
hard-wearing clothing and boots, with which we crammed the
luggage carrier and the car. So that, with our three rifles and
ammunition, we were well prepared for emergencies.</p>

<p>Then just as we were preparing to start that amazing man went
off in a characteristic blaze of wrath at Fergus.</p>

<p>'See here, you young ass! Haven't you got a grain of sense? Do
you expect me to dry nurse you all your life!'</p>

<p>Fergus gaped, astonished by the apparently unwarranted
onslaught.</p>

<p>Then turning on Lynda as though he would bite her, Dr. Ben
snapped, 'You're as bad! No sense, either of you! Get yourself
married at once! No other chance but now!'</p>

<p>Fergus rallied his senses and gulped.</p>

<p>'Doc, you're a genius!'</p>

<p>I think that was the only time I ever saw Lynda at a loss in
an emergency. She stood voiceless and motionless, with her face
burning, and her eyes on Fergus. Clifford and I made no attempt
to hide our mirth, but we recognised that there was sound common
sense behind Dr. Ben's unconventional suggestion. We both rallied
to his side.</p>

<p>'Lyn,' I said, 'do you dare to disobey your superior in war
time.'</p>

<p>'There'll be no orders,' Fergus prowled, 'but, Lyn, I'm
pleading.'</p>

<p>He held out his hand to her. Lyn did not speak, but took the
hand he held out. This had happened as we were standing on the
footpath beside the car. Ben watched them with a chuckle.</p>

<p>'Bless you, my children!'</p>

<p>'Well done. Cupid!' said Clifford grinning at the doctor.</p>

<p>'You impudent young ruffian!' he snorted. Then he took Lynda's
arm. 'Lend her to me for a moment Fergus while I buy a ring,' and
he led her away.</p>

<p>Fergus looked after, them with a dazed expression on his face,
and then murmured with deep feeling. 'Yon's a great mon&mdash;a
great mon!'</p>

<p>When the two returned Lynda was laughing and Ben was looking
fierce. The jeweller had assumed that he was the bridegroom. Bert
resented the mistake as an affront to Lynda, though a compliment
to himself.</p>

<p>We drove to a parsonage to which Ben had been directed, and
found the parson in his shirt sleeves gardening. Ben took full
charge of the proceedings and brushed aside some technical
objection raised by the parson regarding the three days' notice.
He surrendered, and after filling in the necessary forms Ben gave
the bride away when the ceremony was gone through. I do not think
more than 25 minutes elapsed between the time when Ben issued his
ultimatum and when Lynda walked out of the parsonage as Mrs.
Fergus Graham. As Clifford said, by that time the bride had
recovered consciousness.</p>

<p>As we returned to the car she stood with her hand in Fergus's
arm and laughed up at us. 'Listen, you men! I've known Fergus for
three weeks. He proposed to me while we were being shelled and
travelling at 70 miles an hour. Now he has married me, and taking
me on a honeymoon with three other men to no known destination.
We have no home and we are penniless; but,' she the put her hand
on Ben's shoulder and kissed him, 'Major, you're a darling.'</p>

<p>'She's a shameless hussy, Fergus,' laughed Ben. Then, opening
the car door, he said to Clifford and me:&mdash;'You two crowd in
the front seat with me; the back is reserved for the bride and
bridegroom.'</p>

<p>Some 50 miles from Yea, if you know where to look for it,
there is a little village on the junction of two clear mountain
streams. It is built on the only 200 acres of level ground within
many miles. Once, 80 years ago, it was a busy mining town. When
we saw it late that afternoon, with its little silent street, of
some 20 or so old houses, it looked like an English village that
time had forgotten. The hills towered high all round it so that
it lay as though at the bottom of a cup. In the tiny gardens we
neglected pear and apple trees 50 feet high. Rose bushes run wild
were in their first blossom. Though it was not three o'clock the
sun was behind the towering range that rose from the stream
behind the town, and its atmosphere was a mystic misty blue.</p>

<p>On that day the peace of Heaven brooded over it, and we felt
safe. Had we scoured the State we could not have found a more
perfect place of refuge. The road that ran through the deep
valley gave the only approaches from north and south. Access to
it was impossible without our knowledge.</p>

<p>After we had explored thoroughly the surrounding country with
one of the 30 or 40 residents as a guide we knew we were safe
from the incursions of an army. The hills to east and west,
clothed with virgin forest, offered a thousand hiding places.
Along one branch of the stream coming in from the east we could
penetrate for miles into the ranges. At an alarm, within five
minutes. everyone could be under cover and beyond danger. Here we
settled down, and for nearly two months were lost to the
world.</p>

<p>Ben took the lead naturally. He gathered the villagers
together and told them of the certainty of danger of enemy
activities. He urged them to prepare by building beforehand
shelters for the times of stress that would surely come. He
proved a born organiser and leader. Under his direction and with
willing labour, huts were built in the most inaccessible
positions deep in the scrub. He would permit no grouping.
Everyone knew where all the huts were, so that each in a measure
was dependent the other. He taught them that they must not use
one path too often and so make tracks that might betray the
existence of the huts. These were to cleverly built and disguised
that they could be passed almost without notice. Within a week he
had won the absolute confidence of all.</p>

<p>Beside a deep pool in one stream, shadowed by elms with a span
of 50 feet, Fergus and Lynda were given a two-roomed cottage.
Fergus made all its crude furniture and that of their own refuge
hut in the ranges. We three left them pretty much to themselves,
but after a while they come to life again and became part of the
community.</p>

<p>During their honeymoon, however, we made two valuable
discoveries. One was that stock of every description was roaming
at large through the bush. The other was when we were led to an
old deserted homestead in a valley some ten miles away. It was
large, and surrounded by a small forest of ancient walnut trees.
For two weeks Ben kept the workers busy on it, disguising it so
that from the air it must have looked like an outcrop of rock,
lie foresaw its need Later it became 'Dynamite Ben's' hospital
for wounded guerrillas.</p>

<p>In those first few weeks we laid the foundation of an
organisation that became one of the best known among the ranges.
We formed contact with adjacent settlements&mdash;though none
were near&mdash;and organised a perfect code of bush telegraphy.
Those quiet, resourceful people in that district accepted Ben's
frequent explosions at their real value as a driving force. It
was at this time some local genius of the mining profession named
him 'Dynamite Ben, ' and the name stuck.</p>

<p>Bob, Fergus, and I were his aides. But Lynda became his chief
of staff, second only to him in authority. She was Ben's chief
nurse and right hand. Among the women her word was law. What Ben
aimed at was creating a communal spirit&mdash;which is a very
different thing from the Communist spirit.</p>

<p>When the day came, as we knew it must, when our lovely village
was but a few smoked walls and heaps of ashes, and when death was
our hourly neighbour, the protection of Ben and Lynda became a
sort of religion. When Fergus and Bob and I had to leave the
valley on our raids we did so with the knowledge that they were
guarded as kings were never guarded. Their whereabouts was known
to all, and a stranger who strayed within five miles of either of
them unchallenged would be lucky if he were not shot on sight.
During that respite Ben organised lines of communication with
Mansfield, Alexandra, Wood's Point, and hamlets in between,
through which we obtained news of what was going on. And all that
news, bad at first, became worse as the weeks passed. But when
the time came for action our system was so far complete that a
man could not have moved a mile in the district without our
knowledge and consent.</p>

<p>Then presently strangers worked their way towards our village,
for the story became known that somewhere there was a strong man
and a leader. Newcomers never knew how closely they were watched
and tested. If we did not 'like the looks of them,' they were
turned aside without ceremony or politeness. If in doubt, we
brought them to Ben, who had an uncanny insight that was
unerring. Occasionally, without their knowledge, Lynda looked
over recruits. There was a Melbourne barrister who never knew
that a woman he had never seen passed judgment on him, and had
him turned back. But by December we had recruited some 50 sound
men.</p>

<p>It was about the second week in December that we heard from
Wood's Point that four waggon loads of soldiers with machine-guns
were coming up from Warburton. We told our friends to let them
pass.</p>

<p>Ten miles from our village they were stopped by a fallen tree
in a narrow road. Then, when they bunched, another tree fell
behind them. I was the very proud commander of the 30 rifles that
formed the reception committee. When that second tree fell they
were like rats in a trap. There was not a man in sight in the
thick undergrowth, but there was no possible shelter for them.
From both sides of the road a point-blank fire swept through
them. Three minutes after the explosion of the charge that
brought down the second tree it was all over. It was that
afternoon for the first time that anyone of us saw a soldier of
the Paramount Power.</p>

<p>From any point of view that first episode was sheer butchery.
They were taken by surprise and fired wildly into the scrub
inside the road. On our side there were no casualties; on theirs,
there were no survivors. I do not think there was one among us
who felt the slightest compunction for what we had done or for
how we had done it. My own feelings were those of elation. When,
I remembered the scenes in the Domain in Sydney on Bloody
Saturday, and the massacres in Melbourne, the merciless killing
seemed not only justifiable, but a moral obligation.</p>

<p>Within two hours we had cleared up the road and removed the
traces of our raid. We dumped the bodies of two officers and 49
men into an old shaft. Our spoils were two machine-guns, 50
rifles, and a Quantity of ammunition. Three of the trucks were
run into a gully and covered with bushes. The fourth we brought
back to the village, where it was concealed in the scrub, with
the petrol from the other three. Within an hour the news had been
circulated throughout the district.</p>

<p>As Ben said that night as we talked it over, 'The fat's in the
fire now. We'll have them swarming through the country like
hornets.'</p>

<p>And he was right. That was the first conflict in our district,
and from then on it was savage war. After our first sight of the
enemy we saw far too much of them. They were up next day looking
for their lost trucks and they came in force. They did not find
the trucks but they found trouble in plenty at Wood's Point,
where they were expected, and were received with military
honours. They burnt the town before they left, but they never saw
a man.</p>

<p>On the night of our raid Ben had sent the Wood's Pointers one
of our machine-guns and a man who could use it. The Wood's
Pointers were very grateful. They scuppered four armoured waggons
with gelignite.</p>

<p>During that night Ben and Lynda treated their first half-dozen
wounded. After that they kept trying through Alexandra and
Mansfield. They had made what they left of Yea a military depot,
and from then on we were kept on the jump. Every now and then
they sent over a squadron of planes that would come swooping down
our valley machine-gunning anything they thought suspicious It
was by a development of their aircraft tactics that they finally
reached our village and destroyed it. This was about the end of
January.</p>

<p>We were warned of a raid in force with light tanks both from
Mansfield and Alexandra. But from daylight that morning their
planes patrolled the roads through the ranges. They flew singly
in a procession about a mile or two apart, so that there was
always one in sight to checkmate our attempts to block the road
with timber. By this time we had more than one hundred good men
at the' village, and the Wood's Pointers reinforced us gladly.
Ben had the bridge at the south end of the village mined. He
scattered the rifles in the timber along the road in two's. His
orders were that not a shot was to be fired unless there was a
man to fire at.</p>

<p>It was 11 o'clock before the first tank rumbled into view,
scouting for the armoured cars. A quarter of a mile behind came
another and then the armoured cars&mdash;M of them. They fairly
sowed the timber on the hillsides with bullets, while the light
tanks pasted them with shells.</p>

<p>Our reply was a slow, irregular fire, but while they certainly
made the most noise, we did the damage. Our luck was out, for the
bridge looked suspicious, and we failed to get the tank we hoped
would try to cross it. It was blown up, and they were stopped
from going past the village. But we scored when they tried to
leave their cars to burn the houses. They raged round the village
for about two hours and left it in ruins, but the cost must have
been more than it was worth.</p>

<p>That day we, too, suffered the heaviest loss up to date with
17 men killed and twice as many wounded. Among the wounded was
Bob Clifford, with a hole through his shoulder that held him in
fuming inaction for three weeks. That was the only time that one
of our trio received as much as a scratch.</p>

<p>After that raid Ben blocked the road so effectually with
timber, and by blowing up stretches of it, that not even a heavy
tank could get through. It crippled our movements a good deal,
but it made us immune from surprise visits except from the
air.</p>

<p>Our loss in that big raid in January was heavy, but we had no
difficulty in finding recruits. The trouble was the other way.
There were more offering than we could handle comfortably, or arm
adequately, at the time. Ben found that 150 men were the maximum
that could be used with advantage from our headquarters. The
surplus were encouraged and helped to form new independent
units.</p>

<p>From then on the struggle never ceased. From Warburton
northward the countryside was in arms. As time went on the
bitterness and utter ruthlessness intensified. Learning from
experience, we began raiding instead of waiting to be raided.
There was always a loose and flexible association between the
independent guerrilla units, and where possible we helped or
reinforced one another's efforts.</p>

<p>Ben's fame as a doctor as well as a leader spread. It was
through this that Fergus and I made the acquaintance of 'Dumbell
Wright in August, 1940. Ben was seriously hampered through a lack
of medical supplies&mdash;especially anaesthetics. We knew the
P.P. had a military hospital at Wangaratta&mdash;they needed it
badly, because Dumbell's men alone must have provided sufficient
P.P. patients to keep a normal hospital busy. So Fergus and I
made a very lively journey north and found Dumbell in his
quarters outside Beechworth. The suggestion of raiding the
hospital appealed to his sporting instincts as much as did the
idea of supplying Ben with his medical stores.</p>

<p>Two days later, we three, Dumbell, Fergus, and myself,
wandered into Wangaratta. It was the first time I had been in one
of the big towns that was fairly crawling with P.P. troops and
police. Dumbell was accustomed to the game but Fergus and I found
the ordeal rather trying to our nerves. But no one took much
notice of three deplorable deadbeats so long as we kept from
between the wind and their nobility. We scavenged for food in a
back lane till we were summarily ejected by a P.P. policeman, who
almost broke my shoulder with a waddy he carried. It was a
revolting business, but fruitful, for in one of the dirt bins was
Dumbell's post-office.</p>

<p>For two days we loafed about, an offence to the eye, nose, and
landscape. Then Dumbell received news that altered his plan of
raiding the hospital to the more congenial method of holding up a
train at the station. We heard from friends in Albury that there
was a truck of medical stores coming through. On it were a dozen
carboys of anaesthetics. The stunt was more burglarious than
spectacular&mdash;apart from Dumbell's exercise of his own
peculiar weapon.</p>

<p>We three actually did the job, but Wright had half a dozen men
at hand to help if necessary and to get away with the loot. At
that time trains in transit were heavily guarded, but once in the
yards in a military town the vigilance was relaxed. There were a
few night was dark and bleak, and we waited until we saw the
sentries changed at about two o'clock in the morning. Then I saw
Dumbell in action. He abolished three men in as many minutes
without a sound. We knew exactly where to look for the carboys.
The only noise we made was in opening the truck door. Wright
handed out three big jars and remained for some time nosing round
the truck before he came out. Ten minutes later we passed the
three jars over to Wright's men, who were waiting for them with
orders for their disposal. Had they been our own property and
legally acquired there could not have been less fuss over getting
them.</p>

<p class="caption">
We passed the three jars over to Wright's men.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>The really trying part came next day. Wright decided that it
would be better to hang round the town, as his and our immediate
disappearance would have placed the three deadbeats under
suspicion, and made further visits to the town for Wright too
risky. So we stayed for another two days, which, I admit, I spent
with my nerves on edge.</p>

<p>The P.P. were boiling with wrath and making things unpleasant,
even for them. Wright told us that his identity was known to
three-fourths of the Australians in the town, but while the
military and police raged they gave no sign. The night we came
away Wright told us to wait for him outside the town, as he had
business to attend to before he left. It was nearly two hours
before he rejoined us, and we made off at our best pace toward
Tarrawingee, though not by the road, to recover our precious
ether.</p>

<p>After a while he said, 'I might as well tell you fellows what
I have been doing. I didn't let you know before, because it is
entirely my own affair. I went back and climbed the water tower
and emptied four 4 oz. bottles of hydrocyanic acid into the tank.
I have warned all of our people.</p>

<p>Fergus gave a low whistle. 'I don't love the P.P., Wright, as
you know, but you're giving them a nasty weapon for
propaganda.'</p>

<p>Wright stopped and turned to him. He spoke in a whisper of
concentrated hate.</p>

<p>'Believe me, I would not lay poison for a dog, but when I saw
my home at Holbrook after those brutes had been there I swore I
would kill and go on killing by any means, however foul, so long
as I live.'</p>

<p>He was in no mood for argument, so we said no more. Though
remembering that first day in Sydney I understood the urge that
prompted him to do what he had done.</p> <br>

<p class="footnote">[This incident was blazoned all over the
United States. The Paramount Power alleged that more than 600 of
their people, among whom were several high officials, had been
poisoned. It had a disastrous influence on the Australian cause.
While they condemned Wright, Peel and Everard remark that the
Paramount Power was careful to omit that they had forced several
hundred Australians to drink the same water&mdash;this they
undoubtedly did. &mdash;Eds.]</p>

<p><br> One effect of Wright's vengeance was to rouse the P.P. to
a fury. The whole of the north-east and the ranges seethed with
their raids of reprisals. Fergus and I had a hectic time getting
back to the village, where we had been given up as lost. It took
us three weeks to cover the road back, about 90 miles. Had it not
been for the aid we received all along the tracks by which we
travelled I doubt if we would ever have pulled through. But we
arrived with our precious burden intact. Ben was more exercised
in his mind as to the results of Wright's methods than in the
deed itself. It certainly intensified the brutality with which
our war was conducted.</p>

<p>It was about this time we all began practising knife throwing
until we could pin a playing card at our feet. Any idea of the
chivalrous side of warfare vanished. It became a matter of course
to get our man in the back. Everything went in those days.</p>

<p>As the months went by all our clothing wore out, and we were
reduced to wearing skins of the stock we slaughtered for food.
Any luxury such as soap, we looted from the P.P. There was an
unwritten law that we left their women alone but when our own
were reduced to wearing sheepskins, some of the P.P. women who
fell into our hands received unceremonious treatment to provide
ours with something better. Because of this Lynda acquired an
extraordinary wardrobe. After a successful raid there was always
someone who had acquired some kind of dress material for her.
They laid at her feet every fabric between calico and brocaded
silk.</p>

<p>The long bitter months of 1940 passed, and it was well into
1941 before we heard rumours of peace in Europe. What had been
going on there we heard in scraps, but could believe nothing.
Then in the middle of October an aeroplane soared down the valley
shedding leaflets instead of the usual bullets. These leaflets
printed in English, announced that a world-wide armistice had
been signed, and that a peace congress was being held in Berlin.
They offered a three months' truce from hostilities to be
extended if necessary. Our experience of the Paramount Power made
us vary about accepting their news of their assurances.</p>

<p>Then they approached us under a white flag. They wanted the
leaders to go to Melbourne to negotiate. The reply of the leaders
was a unanimous and unflattering refusal to consider their
guarantees of safe conduct. After arguing for three weeks that
Wright and Ben would meet their delegates on the road in the open
outside Mansfield. Each delegate could bring three men, but all
must be unarmed. No armed men were to be within 20 miles of the
meeting place.</p>

<p>Bob, Fergus, and I went down with Ben. We were a picturesque
gang. Lynda had done some amateur tailoring and had fitted out
Ben and Fergus in suits of duck that looked so like pyjamas that
the difference did not matter. Bob was wearing a natty sheepskin
tunic with the wool inside. My costume was a P.P. uniform
overcoat with the badges and buttons removed. Dumbell's gang were
in sheepskins, but he himself had the nerve to show up in a P.P.
officer's uniform with badges and buttons he had cut from jam
tins. His impudence so incensed the brigadier-general who met us
that the conference nearly ended before it began.</p>

<p>After four hours of cat-and-dog discussion we began to get
somewhere Finally we agreed that hostilities should cease pending
the decision of the Berlin Congress, provided they confined their
troops to five towns on the Hume Highway. Our men were not to
approach within 10 miles of these towns. Similar arrangements,
with slight variations, were made in other districts. They also
agreed&mdash;this was at Ben's insistence&mdash;that we should be
supplied with medical necessities, soap, and some clothing for
women and children, and at least 50 tons of flour for each
camp.</p>

<p>So it was that by mid-November the raids ceased and we waited.
The Paramount Power had agreed to keep us informed on the
negotiations in Berlin, but whether they had not the information
or whether they withheld it. what we were told was scanty and
non-committal.</p>

<p>We had become used to our hard lives. Apart from the risks it
had been a demoralising period in some respects. We who had once
been decent citizens had become men to whom killing was a matter
of course. Human life meant less than nothing. And it was not
clean killing for both sides used the basest treachery and the
basest means.</p>

<p>On the other hand I and the others were never so healthy in
our lives. We lived in the open and developed a hardiness and
endurance that we would not have believed possible in other
circumstances. Most of our fighting had been done on foot, and
some of our forced marches of 10 and 15 miles were done at nearly
five miles an hour, carrying rifles and full cartridge belts. I
have done a good deal better than that for an hour when some of
the gentlemen opposite were on my trail to make the pace for
me.</p>

<p>The truce was adhered to on both sides. I think they were as
glad as we were of the respite. We certainly had had a bad time.
It is not boasting, however, to say that the gruelling they got
was far worse than they gave. If&mdash;that bitter 'if'&mdash;we
had had an army of men such as made up the guerrilla forces in
the first place we would have wiped them off the map in a
fortnight. And we would have had that army but for the altruists,
and other well-meaning but thrice-accursed visionaries.</p>

<p>However, we hung round our camps in the hills idling away our
time until the middle of December, when the news was sent to us
that the Congress had arrived at a decision regarding Australia.
It was to be announced at a meeting arranged as before.</p>

<p>It was December 18 when we went down to Mansfield to hear the
verdict. We were met by the brigadier general with whom the truce
was negotiated. Without any preliminary discussion he read from a
document in his hand:&mdash;</p>

<p>'The Congress decrees that all that part of Australia north of
28 deg. south latitude and west at 129 deg. east longitude shall
become the unalienable territory of Cambasia. Further, that for a
period of 20 years Cambasia shall occupy the remainder of the
continent and Tasmania as Paramount Power to indemnify itself for
the cost of its expeditionary operations in Australia and to
facilitate and assist in the formation of a responsible
Government of their territory by the Australian people
subsequently. In order that the Paramount Power will base its
administration on a just and benevolent treatment of the
Australians during the period of occupation, a neutral delegation
of inspection, consisting of five members appointed by the
President of the United States, shall visit Australia once during
the course of each year and report thereon to the permanent
committee of the Congress of Berlin.'</p>

The division of Australia decreed by Congress.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Then that arrogant little brute carefully folded and creased
that document and handed it to one of his staff looking us over
all the while with a cynical grin on his face. Wright exploded in
an oath, and made as if to throw himself on the brigadier, but in
an instant ho was covered by three automatics. Ben stood pale as
though frozen. Beside me Fergus was rumbling in his throat. I did
net look at Bob, but I knew he felt as I felt, murderous. It was
Ben who broke the silence.</p>

<p>'Does Great Britain subscribe to that document?' he asked.</p>

<p>'All the Powers at the Berlin Congress, including Britain and
the United States.' He bowed ironically as he spoke. Then he
turned to one of his staff and held out his hand for some
documents which he took, and then went on speaking.</p>

<p>'You cannot expect, and my Government cannot and will not
concede, the lenience that we would have extended to you had you
accepted your defeat with a spirit of resignation and
conciliation. The outrages you have perpetrated against the
nationals of the Paramount Power demand full reparation. However,
we are disposed to be merciful despite the provocation we have
received. You will listen to the terms that my Government
imposes.'</p>

<p>He unfolded a paper and read: 'All Australian nationals now
unlawfully under arms against the terms of the Treaty of Peace of
Berlin will surrender their arms and themselves forthwith to the
appointed officials of the Paramount Power. In the event of
disobedience to this order it is decreed that for every man
killed by an Australian unlawfully under arms fifteen Australians
selected by lot from under this jurisdiction of the Paramount
Power will be summarily shot. Moreover, for every national
wounded five hostages, similarly chosen, will be shot.' He paused
and looked up. 'It may interest you gentlemen to know that in
selecting the hostages, no discrimination of sex or age will be
made. I would like you to be quite clear on that matter.' Then he
continued, 'In the event of your submission the Paramount Power
graciously agrees to . grant an amnesty of your past crimes. You
will, however, be required to perform such services for the
Paramount Power In return for your pardon as its officers see fit
to direct. Two exceptions, however, are made in this district, no
mitigation of punishment will be allowed in the cases of the men
known as 'Dumbell' Wright and Dr. Benjamin Cornish. These two
must surrender unconditionally to the officers of the Paramount
Power.'</p>

<p>From the three of us came a shout of rage, but Ben swung round
on us end thundered, 'Silence! Stand back!'</p>

<p>Such was the power of his hold on us, we fell back without a
word. There was a nasty smile on the Brigadier's face as he said,
looking at us, 'Your friend is now, as always, a I man of
remarkable ability and understanding.'</p>

<p>Ben turned on the Brigadier, 'Assuming we see fit to accept
your terms I presume the safety of our women and children is
assured.'</p>

<p>'Your women do not interest us&mdash;' there was a filthy
insult in his tone:&mdash;'They and their children may remain
with your men.'</p>

<p>Ben's voice war Icy. 'Do you require an immediate answer?'</p>

<p>'Oh! not at all,' came the suave sneering voice, 'Let me see.
this is the eighteenth. You will be good enough to deliver your
answer to an officer I shall appoint to meet you at this spot on
midday on the twenty-fifth&mdash;an auspicious day among your,
people, I believe.'</p>

<p>Until then my hatred of the men of the Paramount Power had
been general, but at that moment it centred in that one figure.
He paused a moment but neither Wright nor Ben accepted the
challenge. Then he went on. 'You would perhaps like copies of
your orders&mdash;' His slight emphasis of the word was an
incitement to murder, as he handed Ben and Wright a copy of the
paper. 'Good afternoon, gentlemen!'</p>

<p>He turned stiffly away and entered his car, followed by his
staff, without looking round.</p>

<p>We stood silent watching the car as it disappeared in the
dust. Then Ben turned abruptly to Dumbell.</p>

<p>'We'll talk this over together, Wright,' and they paced off
down the road. For a while we others remained silent. I knew only
one of Wright's three lieutenants, Fenner, who had been a counter
hand in some shop in Melbourne. It was he who spoke first.</p>

<p>'We can't let them give themselves up.'</p>

<p>'Seems to me they need not,' Clifford suggested. 'That cocky
little swine only said that they would not be pardoned. There's
nothing to prevent them from sticking to the bush.'</p>

<p>'Alone, though,' put in one of the others. It's the finish for
us. Wonder if they'll keep their word.'</p>

<p>Fergus, who had been glaring at the spot where the car
disappeared, turned round. 'Better for us perhaps if they didn't.
The only reason for their dashed amnesty is that we're more
useful to them alive than dead.'</p>

<p>Then, 'Does anyone know where 28 south and 129 cast run?'</p>

<p>It was one of Dumbell's men who enlightened us.</p>

<p>'They've grabbed a pretty fair piece of country. Twenty-eight
south is approximately the line of the Queensland border; the
other is the West Australian boundary. They've left us New South
Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania.</p>

<p>'With the whole Commonwealth to play with for the next twenty
years,' he added. 'By that time the four States they've left us
won't be worth having&mdash;they'll have stripped them bare.'</p>

<p>Fergus was a better prophet than he knew.</p>

<p>While we talked Ben and Wright were pacing slowly up and down
in earnest debate.</p>

<p>'Those two are just the splendid pair of fools to give
themselves up,' Fenner said, as we watched them anxiously; 'and
I'd let myself be shot to ribbons to save Dumbell.'</p>

<p>'Who wouldn't?' Clifford spoke for us all.</p>

<p>'But' I said, 'actually they can refuse.'</p>

<p>'But they won't, and that's the pity of it.' Fergus's voice
was bitter. 'They know the game's up. I doubt if either of them
will care to carry on in the bush. Ben won't, anyway.'</p>

<p>As he spoke they quickened their pace and walked toward the
horses. I 'Come on boys!' Ben cried. We j mounted and the two
shook hands and I purled, we three following Ben. I For ten
minutes we rode behind I him in silence. Then he motioned us I to
come up. 'Well boys it's finished. Wright and I decided we have
no option but to accept. We cannot go on in the face of those
murderous, reprisals.'</p>

<p>'But you, Ben!'</p>

<p>I put the question that was in all our minds.</p>

<p>'Wright and I have decided on a way out,' he said. 'You'll
know that later.' Then his voice changed. 'Now. this is an order
to you all&mdash;and I expect it to be obeyed. Not one word to
anyone, and especially not to Lynda about the exclusion of Wright
and me from the amnesty.' Then, to prevent further talk, he
touched up his horse and rode on.</p>

<p>That night we called a general rally of our men, and Ben told
the unhappy ! news.</p>

<p>'If we alone were affected, men, I would counsel you to stay
here and fight to the last man. as I know you would,' he
concluded. 'But that threat of reprisals is genuine. We cannot go
I on and condemn hundreds of helpless fellow people to death. I
fear we are surrendering to slavery, but that is the price we
must pay.'</p>

<p>'Will they keep their words about I the women and children?'
was the only question asked. Ben gave the only possible
reply.</p>

<p>'I think, and hope so.' And so it was settled.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day. by Ben's orders, I rode down to Mansfield
and met one of their officers and gave him Ben's reply. Fenner
had come in with Wright's. We were given our orders curtly.
Wright was to surrender with all his people at Beechworth. and we
were to come into Mansfield on the same day&mdash;New Year's Day,
1942. All arms were to be brought in. With all our women and
children it was nearly a two day's march from the village.</p>

<p>A touch of humour in that <i>via dolorosa</i> seemed
impossible, but Lynda provided it. When the women, there were 32
of them, assembled on the morning we started the men stared at
them in incredulous amazement. Normally they were fine average
Australian types. What Lynda presented to us was the most
fearsome-looking I collection of hags and slatterns that ever
offended the eye. They were in rags and unclean rags at that.
Their faces, hands, and arms were a dirty yellow brown. Their
hair was as unkempt as the rest of their get-up. The children,
some 40 of them of all ages, were equally repulsive-looking.
Lynda herself was almost unrecognisable. I was with Fergus when
he sight of her, and his exclamation of recognition left me
speechless with mirth.</p>

<p>'It's a fairy tale,' Lynda laughed, in answer to his demand
for an explanation.</p>

<p>'It's more like a bogy story,' he retorted. 'Woman, you look
like&mdash;like&mdash;an ash-heap.'</p>

<p>'Call me a <i>ruse de guerre</i>,' she smiled&mdash;and we saw
her white teeth were stained almost black. 'It was Ben's idea,'
she explained. 'He suggested that there was no need for us to
look our best. The intentions of those brutes in Mansfield may be
honourable. but there's nothing like making sure.'</p>

<p>Ben came up at the moment and looked over the group with
approving eyes. 'It's a triumph, Lyn, a ghastly triumph!'</p>

<p>'But how on earth did you do it?' I asked. 'It's
revolting!'</p>

<p>'That's where the fairy story comes in,' Lyn replied, 'When
the princess disguised herself as a kitchen maid, she always
stained herself with walnut juice. The colour lasts.'</p>

<p>'Well,' Ben smiled. 'The highest compliment I can pay you is
that I'd hate to see you in any kitchen or mine.'</p>

<p>I left Fergus trying to thank Ben for the idea. But it was an
unhappy precession that moved off down the valley an I hour
later. Bob and Fergus and were in a state of sick anxiety about
Ben. We had each tried to discover his intentions, but he had
evaded answering. As we made our way through the scrub he seemed
the least concerned of any of us, and chatted with the children
most of the time.</p>

<p>That night were camped four miles out of the town by the
roadside in the open. I doubt if many of us slept except for a
few occasional minutes. We five had sat round a fire until about
ten o'clock. But there was very little talking. When Ben got up
he told me there was no need for an early start, and to let those
sleep who could. Then he nodded good night and left us.</p>

<p>I must have dozen off just about dawn, for it was light when
Clifford aroused me. There was consternation in his voice.</p>

<p>'Wally, quickly! Come to Ben!'</p>

<p>I hurried after him. Twenty yards away we found Fergus bending
over Ben, who was lying at the foot of a tree. As we came up
Fergus looked up.</p>

<p class="caption">
Twenty yards away we found Fergus stooping over Ben.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>'He's dead!' he said in an awed voice.</p>

<p>We stooped and raised him. There could be no doubt but that
Fergus was right. Beneath him was a leaf from his pocket book. I
picked it up. It was addressed to 'My four dear and loyal
comrades.'</p>

<p>Briefly he had written that Wright and he had chosen this way
out to rob the Paramount Power of its triumph of punishing
them.</p>

<br>

<p><i>'I leave you to surrender my body to them as you think
fit.'</i> Then at the end: <i>'These two years that I should have
been the most bitter of my life have been made the brightest by
the love and friendship of the four dearest people I ever knew.
God bless you all. and give you strength to
endure.&mdash;Ben.'</i></p> <br>


<p>The small bottle we picked up beside him told its own tale.
When I looked down on the figure, that somehow seemed smaller in
death, I said. 'I am glad!' The others understood what I meant.
Then Fergus left us with bowed head to break the rows to
Lynda.</p>

<p>After we had called the camp together and Fergus told them
what had happened, and why, we made a litter of branches broken
from trees, fastened together with fencing wire. That which had
been Ben was laid upon it reverently. Our men&mdash;they numbered
160&mdash; formed fours on the road. We broke them into two
sections between which the women and children were placed. With
eight men shouldering the litter and Fergus, Clifford, and me
marching behind it, the procession moved off, the men with their
rifles at the slope.</p>

<p>Until then we had not seen a sign of the enemy, though we were
sure our movements had been under observation during the whole of
the previous day. Less than a mile out of the town we were
stopped by an officer in a motor-car. Beside the road stood an
armoured waggon. As we halted the officer left his car, and
approached us, demanded the surrender of Benjamin Cornish.</p>

<p>For answer, Fergus ordered bearers to lay down the litter.
Bending down, he raised the leafy branches that had been placed
over the body. Then, for the first and only time in my
experience, I saw an officer of the Paramount Power do a decent
action. This one stood to attention and saluted as he looked
down. Then he stood aside and waved us forward. As the men raised
the litter again he gave some order to those in the armoured
waggon, which afterward rumbled along behind us. The officer
returned to his car and drove off ahead of us.</p>

<p>When we entered the town the main street was lined with
troops, from behind whose ranks whet remained of the townspeople
watched our surrender with silent sympathy. As we entered the
street we flung our rifles to the ground and passed on. The
silence was such that the only sound was the shuffle of our ill-
shod feet and the clatter of the weapons as they were flung
aside. So it was that on New Year's Day, 1942, we entered into
bondage. That night in our compound, where we had been herded
without shelter, we buried the body of a beloved Ben.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

<p class="first">THROUGHOUT the country that day more than 40,000
men laid down their arms, and our conquest was complete. We
entered on the third stage of our humiliation. The first was that
three weeks of inglorious warfare with its single decisive
battle. The second was the two years of guerrilla warfare. And
this, the long drawn agony of hopeless bondage with the knowledge
that the Paramount Power will never honour its treaty obligations
or relax its hold on the prize it has snatched from a people who
could not hold it.</p>

<p>From our first concentration camp at Mansfield where we
remained for a fortnight before we were dispersed, we learned
what our fate would be. They fed us on boiled meat and treacle,
with the coarsest of meat twice a week. Meanwhile, we were
questioned individually and registered. They ascertained our
previous occupations, and any of us such as Fergus, who possessed
special useful qualification as a metallurgist, were separated
from the rest who were drafted for hard labour.</p>

<p>We found that those who had taken part in the guerrilla
warfare were marked men from then on. Our discipline was more
severe, our punishment harsher, and our work more laborious than
given to those who had not taken up arms. They made us
distinguishable from all others by shaving our heads. Others
could hope for some alleviation of the bondage through relaxed
regulations, better food, and shorter hours. The only concessions
we were given came at a later date, when in camps we were allowed
four hours liberty a week. After a few escaped to the bush,
preferring the risk of starvation to bondage, they ensured our
return by instituting a system of hostages. Each man had to
nominate two comrades as hostages. If he escaped his hostages
were shot after 24 hours.</p>

<p>The men who were married wore drafted into separate camps with
their families. But their children were taken from them at the
age of 10 years, and set to work. Few parents know what became of
them, and few ever saw them again unless accident threw them
together. We guerrillas, however, had f.ne compensation. It
became an unwritten law among our own people to render us any
possible service as a labour of love. They would leave food or
some little luxury of clothing where they knew we would find
them. They conveyed messages and passed on information to us.
Though this was strictly forbidden, not all the ceaseless
vigilance of the Paramount Power could prevent this
intercommunication.</p>

<p>It was the policy of the Paramount Power that all the products
of Australia were either diverted to their own use. or exported
and sold overseas. Our wool was sent abroad and sold overseas. We
were allowed only synthetic fabrics. All coal except that tor
their own use was exported. Fergus had predicted that they would
strip Australia bare. And they did. Vast areas of forest land
were stripped of timber and were never replanted. The bread we
were given was made from waste wheat, unfit for export, badly
milled, and half bran at that. Our vineyards were exploited in
the same manner. Our orchards were cultivated, but only those who
worked in them ever saw the fruit. Labouring gangs grew
vegetables for our masters, but cabbages were the only vegetables
allowed to us.</p>

<p>Our Australia must be a truly profitable prize for the
Paramount Power. Labour costs nothing, although we are supposed
to be paid at the rate of ninepence a day. But as this is always
mortgaged for the wretched clothing and boots that are charged
against us. We never see any money. Some in the higher
professions, such as Fergus, who has a hut of his own, receives
as much as 12/- a week in money&mdash;but they are the
aristocrats. Whatever this cost of labour may be, it is so low as
to be scarcely appreciable.</p>

<p>The entire revenue for exports of primary and secondary
products goes to the Paramount Power. It must be enormous, but
they are always able to prove to the American Committees of
Inspection that they are running the country at a loss, because
of the high cost of administration and the necessity for
maintaining an armed occupation. Maybe! It is said the salary of
the Military Governor-General is 100.000 per annum.</p>

<p>Before long the systematic brutality of our treatment bore
fruit in a war of sabotage. We cannot kill, but we can and do
destroy. Sabotage is carried out, especially among factory
workers, with impish ingenuity, l think this must be the only
serious cost of administration lo the Paramount Power. But it
goes on despite the severity of penalties. Detection means a
blank wall and a firing squad. If they cannot catch the
individual, which they very seldom do, the gang on a job or in a
factory is put on short rations or longer hours.</p>

<p>For nearly the three first years I worked on a limber mill,
and think the average of stoppages for repairs to machinery must
have been one week in four. But among us, and especially among
the ex-guerrillas, theft is even more prevalent than sabotage.
This applies especially to such luxuries as good food. But the
general principle is for a man to get away with anything he can
lay his hands on, provided it is not too heavy. But weight does
not mean immunity. In the timber camp I was one of six men who
succeeded in getting away with a lorry load of stores intended
for the managing staff. They recovered nearly half of it, but our
crowd lived well on the balance for a week or two.</p>

<p>I suppose we have become utterly amoral. But the doctrine we
subscribe to is that we only take what is actually ours from the
real thief. Personally. I have never felt any qualms of
conscience, and my capacity for disgust at having to steal food
has become atrophied.</p>

<p>When I was drafted to Newcastle when the steel works were
rebuilt, the only ray of light in the gloom came with an
unexpected reunion with Fergus and Lynda. During the entire
interval of three years I had heard nothing from them. A few
months later Bob Clifford was drafted. We found they were
selecting for the steel works camp all those ex-guerrillas whom
they suspected of being active in subversive movements. Here,
before they organised the camp, Bob and I systematically raided
enemy stores for luxuries with uniform success, though on one or
two occasions we left the scene of operation under fire. I doubt
if Lynda's baby would have lived but for the preserved milk that
Bob and I procured for her.</p>

<p>But now, as I come to the end of the story, a more sinister
and evil spirit has crept into our hatred of the Paramount Power.
This is born of the knowledge that has come to us during the last
two years that they have no intention of evacuating the four
States at the end of the 20 years' term.</p>

<p>Until then we were buoyed with the thought that our servitude
had a limit, but when the hope faded, our spirit did not break:
it became brutalised. Slowly the exactions and oppressions of the
Paramount Power have become more inhuman and pitiless, and our
silent underground resistance has become more vindictive. All
those tyrannies that were once reserved for the ex-guerrillas
have been extended to the rest of the people. Hopelessness has
bred a recklessness of life that would be unbelievable to people
differently circumstanced.</p>

<p>Lately our numbers have been added to by the transportation of
all the Australians in Queensland to the three southern
continental States. For the past five years the Paramount Power
has been populating Queensland with its own nationals. Our people
were made to work for the farmed and orchards and cane growers
until there were sufficient Cambasians to take over the State
completely. They have retained only the strongest among the men
to do the most laborious work such as clearing new forest ground
for cultivation.</p>

<p>Last year it was decreed that no Australian would be permitted
lo live in Brisbane, or in any of the large provincial towns of
Queensland. But several thousand men were kept as labourers to
carry out the work of a complete rebuilding of Brisbane. Only the
finest of the public buildings are being retailed, it is evident
to us that this policy of the elimination of the Australian by
ill-treatment and hardship is being extended to the four southern
States. The men who are coming down from Queensland are physical
wrecks, worn out with ill-nourishment and overwork.</p>

<p>The consequence has been the development of a silent passive
resistance among us on the surface, beneath which is a seething
mass of conspiracy and vindictive retaliation. This year, for the
first time since the suppression of the guerrilla warfare,
killing has recommenced despite reprisals. It has been carried
out secretly for the most part, but occasionally as the result of
a sudden outburst of rage by some victim of tyranny or
brutality.</p>

<p>Again and again, especially detested police officials have
disappeared. About six months ago&mdash;just after I began
writing this story&mdash;that brigadier-general who took the
surrender of Ben and Dumbell Wright came to Newcastle as
commandant. I got word of his advent from Fenner, who was working
on the new breakwater. His administration proved more iniquitous
than that of his predecessor. For two months one single
organisation kept him under incessant observation. They cannot
keep us all in concentration camps so that there are plenty
outside to carry on the good work .He disappeared from his own
house. There were at least 50 people who knew how he was taken
from his house and what became of the body. The P.P. police raged
for a month, and their vengeance was diabolic, but no one spoke.
It is this silent killing that is getting on their
nerves&mdash;and on ours. The same atmosphere of terror reigns
everywhere. For my own part, hope of release is gone.</p>

<p>I have not dared to go near Fergus and Lynda, again though I
know they are safe so far. There are many among us who feel that
the only chance of directing the attention of the outside world
to the terrible condition of our slavery is by a general
rebellion. Such a move, however, presents vast difficulties
through the problem of co-ordination. But still the attempt is
being planned. I fear it will take years before the organisation
can be sufficiently advanced to take action. I am participating
because I have reached the stage when I do not care what happens
to me. Since the day I saw Fergus and Lynda last, and saw Bob
Clifford in the gang that marched to the Yampi transport, I have
lost heart. My only wonder is that I have escaped so far. But
sooner or later they will reach out for me, and when that day
comes I will have the satisfaction of knowing that whatever they
may do to me has been paid for in advance.</p>

<p>It is strange that I can feel neither regret nor self reproach
for what I have done during these last nine years. I set out to
tell the whole story without hiding a detail. But my courage has
not been equal to the task. But no one, I believe, could do so. I
have killed bound men without pity or compunction. It has all
been part of our harvest. One night in 1941 Clifford and I came
on two wounded men after a raid. They begged....</p>
