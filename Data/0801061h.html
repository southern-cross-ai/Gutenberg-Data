  <h2><a id="ch0"
     name="ch0">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THOSE who read "Palos of the Dog Star Pack"
  (<i>Famous Fantastic Mysteries</i>, October 1941) and "The
  Mouthpiece of Zitu" (November 1942) will remember that Dr.
  Jason Croft, having during his psychic investigations gained
  complete control over his astral form, lands while wandering
  among the planets of outer space upon Palos, one of the
  spheres of the universe which includes the Dog Star. There he
  sees and falls in love with Naia, Princess of Tamarizia, and,
  seizing upon the body of a Palosian about to die, he enters
  into it, and in this form, with his advanced knowledge soon
  makes himself a power on the planet. Several times he returns
  to his own body on earth; but finally, having won the love of
  Naia, married her and made himself practical dictator of the
  planet, he allows his earth body to die and goes to Palos for
  good. This is the status of things when in the present story
  he again gets into communication with his friend (the
  narrator) Dr. Murray. Of the present story we will only say:
  "You know that the first one was good and the second better;
  the third is undoubtedly the best of the trilogy."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">I. &mdash; THE GATEWAY OF LIFE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was midnight when the night superintendent
  called and told me No. 27 had died. I rose. The thing was no
  surprise. I had known it was going to happen. No. 27 had told
  me so, himself. None the less, I went to his room. Routine in
  the mental hospital had nothing to do with that strange secret
  held in common between myself and the man&mdash;that strange
  state of affairs which had enabled him to predicate his own
  death so accurately.</p>

  <p>And yet as I mounted the stairs to the room where his body
  now lay as a worn-out husk I had none of the feeling which so
  customarily assails the average mortal in such an hour. To me
  it was not as though he had died. To my mind in those moments
  it was no more than the casting aside by the activating spirit
  of that instrument which for its own ends it had used. The
  body then was a husk indeed&mdash;an emaciated, worn-out thing
  which, because of our mutual secret, I knew had been kept
  alive by the sheer force of the spiritual tenant, now
  removed.</p>

  <p>I stood looking down upon it, with very much the same
  sensations one might have in viewing the tool once plied by
  the hand of a friend. It was nothing more than that really.
  Jason Croft had used it while he had need of its manipulation,
  and when his need was accomplished he had simply laid it
  down.</p>

  <p>Jason Croft. Dead? I felt an impulse to smile in most
  improper fashion. Not at all. The man was not only not dead,
  but I knew&mdash;as positively as I knew I was presently going
  to leave the room where his dead shell lay on a hospital bed
  and return to my own quarters&mdash;exactly where he had
  gone.</p>

  <p>The statement sounds a bit as though I were better
  qualified as an inmate than the superintendent of an
  institution for the care of the insane. And I don't suppose it
  will help any for me to add that I had seen Jason Croft die
  before&mdash;or that he had informed me on the former
  occasion, though in less specific fashion, of his approaching
  end.</p>

  <p>That was after he had told me a most remarkable tale,
  which, in spite of its almost incredible nature, I found
  myself strongly inclined to believe. It had concerned Croft's
  adventures on another planet&mdash;Palos&mdash;one of the
  spheres in the universe of the Dog Star Sirius, to which he
  had traveled first by astral projection, but on which he had
  found means to establish an actual existence in the flesh.</p>

  <p>"Unbelievable&mdash;can a man be dead and yet live again?"
  you will say. Well, yes, but&mdash; Croft's earth body died
  just as he had told me it would, and was buried, and time
  passed, and this patient No. 27 was committed to the
  institution of which I was the head; and when I went to
  examine and inspect him, he asked me to dismiss the
  attendants, and then he spoke to me in the. voice of Jason
  Croft.</p>

  <p>More than that, he took up the story of his adventures
  where he had left off in the previous instance, admitted
  freely that he had reversed the experiment by which he had
  gained material existence on Palos, and, driven by the
  necessity of gaining knowledge for use in his new estate, had
  deliberately returned to earth. Unbelievable, you will say
  again. And again I answer:</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but wait."</p>

  <p>Croft was a physician, even as am I. He was a scientific
  man. In addition he was a student of the occult&mdash;the
  science of the mind, the spirit, and its control of the
  physical forces of life.</p>

  <p>He was an earth-born man. The home in which I first met him
  contained the greatest private collection of works on the
  subject I have ever seen. In dying he left them to me&mdash;I
  have them all about me. They are mine. According to his
  statements and his notations on margins, he had gone so far in
  his. investigations that he could project the astral
  consciousness anywhere at will. And when I say anywhere, I
  mean it in the literal sense.</p>

  <p>Many men have mastered the astral control on the earthly,
  plane. Croft had carried it to an ultimate degree. He shook
  off the envelope of the earth atmosphere, led thereto, as he
  frankly confessed in our conversations, by the attraction of a
  feminine spirit, though he did not know it at the time, and
  recognized it only when he first viewed Naia&mdash;Princess of
  Tamarizia&mdash;on a distant star.</p>

  <p>I had dabbled in the occult to some extent myself. Hence
  when he spoke of the doctrine of twin souls he had no further
  need to explain. He alleged that since a child the Dog Star
  had called him subtly through the years in a way he could not
  explain. Once having come into her presence, however, he knew
  that it was Naia&mdash;the feminine counterpart of his
  nature&mdash;whose existence on the other planet had called
  across the void to him. Or so he claimed. And certainly his
  portrayal of the events on Palos were characterized by a
  detail that made the atmosphere of his alleged other existence
  most vividly plain.</p>

  <p>To an accomplishment of his marrying her, Croft declared
  that he had done a weirdly wonderful thing. Discovering a
  Palosian dying of a mental rather than a physical ailment, he
  had waited until his death occurred, then appropriated the
  still physically viable body to himself, as he most
  comprehensively explained, describing his act in a scientific
  way that counseled belief while staggering the mind.</p>

  <p>Over that body he obtained absolute control, exactly as he
  had gained the same ability with his own. For a time
  thereafter he led a sort of dual existence, sometimes on
  Palos, sometimes on earth, until he had fully shaped his
  plans. Then, and then only, did he voluntarily forsake the
  mundane life to enter that other and fuller existence he felt
  that Naia of Aphur could make complete.</p>

  <p>I questioned him closely. I was faced by a most amazing
  thing. I took up first the question of time required in
  passing from earth to Palos. He smiled and replied that
  outside the mental atmosphere a man time ceased to exist; that
  it was man's measure of a portion of eternity, and, nothing
  more, and that he could not use what was non-existent, hence
  reached Palos as quickly in the astral condition as I could
  span the gulf between that member of the Dog Star's Pack and
  earth in thought. All other points I raised he met. Even so it
  was a good deal of a shock to find my new patient speaking to
  me with Croft's evident understanding, looking at me out of
  what seemed oddly like Croft's eyes.</p>

  <p>But in the end I was convinced. The man knew too much. He
  was too utterly conversant with Croft's accomplishments, his
  aims and ambitions and hopes, to be anyone but Croft himself.
  And, too, he naively explained that it was a poor rule that
  would not work two ways, and that he had therefore repeated
  his experiment in gaining a Palosian body when he felt the
  pressing need of a return to earth.</p>

  <p>This night, earlier in the evening, he had bidden me
  goodbye&mdash;told me he was going back to Naia, the woman he
  had dared so much to win, his mate who ere long was to bear
  him, Jason Croft of Earth, a child. And now&mdash;well, now as
  before, it would seem he had kept his word. Jason Croft was
  dead again.</p>

  <p>Is it any wonder that I felt that strange, almost amused
  desire to smile? Dead! Why, Croft, in so far as I knew him,
  could practically laugh at death&mdash;he was a man who had
  actually demonstrated, if one believed his narrative, of
  course, the truth of the saying that the spirit is the life.
  He was a man, who, because of the needs of his spirit, had
  deliberately switched his existence from one to the other of
  two spheres.</p>

  <p>I gave what directions were needed for the disposal of No.
  27's body, returned to my bed, and stretched myself out. But I
  didn't sleep all that morning. I buried myself in thought.</p>

  <p>Both the narratives to which I had listened&mdash;first
  from the man I knew to be Jason Croft really, secondly from
  the pitiable wreck he had employed on his return, that
  worn-out husk which had just died&mdash;had produced on me a
  somewhat odd effect. So clearly had he portrayed the events
  and emotions which had swayed him in his almost undreamed
  courtship of the Aphurian princess that I had come to accept
  the characters he mentioned as actually existent persons,
  acquaintances almost, just as, in spite of all established
  precedent, I still regarded Croft himself as alive.</p>

  <p>Naia of Aphur&mdash;many a time as I listened to his
  account of their association I had thrilled to the picture of
  that supple girl with her crown of golden hair, her crimson
  lips, her violet-purple eyes. So real she had come to seem
  that I had felt I would know her had I seen her with my
  physical rather than my mental vision. So real indeed was her
  mental picture that when he told me she was about to become a
  mother I had cried out, on impulse, that I wished as a medical
  man I might attend her&mdash;would be glad to see the light in
  her eyes when they first beheld his, Jason's, child.</p>

  <p>And Croft had replied, "Man, I could love you for that,"
  and he flashed me an understanding smile.</p>

  <p>So now that he was gone back to her&mdash;I lay on my bed
  unsleeping, and let all he had told me unroll in a sort of
  mental panorama, dealing wholly with the Palosian world.</p>

  <p>Tamarizia! It was into the empire Croft blundered blindly
  when he went to Palos first&mdash;a series of principalities
  surrounding the shore of a vast inland sea, with the exception
  of a central state&mdash;the seat of the imperial capital,
  embracing the island of Hiranur located in the sea itself, and
  Nodhur to the west and south. From the central sea a narrow
  strait led into an outer ocean to the west.</p>

  <p>This was known as the Gateway. To the north was Cathur, a
  rugged, mountainous state, the seat of national learning, in
  its university at the capital city of Scira, and east of
  Cathur was Mazhur, known as the Lost State at the time of
  Croft's first arrival, because it had been wrested from the
  empire some fifty years before, in a war with Zollaria, a
  hostile nation to the north.</p>

  <p>Croft, after gaining physical life on Palos, succeeded in
  winning it back, and in gaining thereby the consent of Naia's
  father, Prince Lakkon, and her uncle, Jadgor, King of Aphur,
  to their marriage, It was at this point his narrative had
  ended first.</p>

  <p>East of Mazhur, still hugging the sea and extending into
  the hinterland of the continent was Bithur. And Milidhur
  joined Bithur to the south. West of Milidhur, completing the
  circle, was Aphur&mdash;the name meaning literally "the land
  to the west" or "toward the sun." Aphur was the southern
  pillar of the Gateway, ending at the western strait. Nodhur
  lay south of Aphur, gaining access to the sea by the navigable
  river Na, on whose yellow flood moved a steady stream of
  commerce driven by sail and oar until Croft revolutionized
  transportation by producing alcohol-driven motors.
  And&mdash;if I were to believe his second account&mdash;since
  then he had actually electrified the nation, harnessing
  mountain streams to generate the force.</p>

  <p>Except for the waterways, traffic prior to Croft's
  innovations was by conveyances drawn by the gnuppa&mdash;a
  creature half deer, half horse, in appearance&mdash;or by
  means of caravans of the enormous beast called sarpelca,
  resembling some huge Silurian lizard, twice the size of an
  elephant, with a pointed tail, scale-armored back, camel-like
  neck, and the head of a marine serpent tentacle-fringed about
  the mouth.</p>

  <p>They were driven by reins affixed to these fleshy
  appendages, and streamed across the Palosian deserts, bearing
  huge merchandise cargoes upon their massive backs.</p>

  <p>Indeed, it was a wonderful world into which Croft had
  projected himself. Babylonian in seeming he had described it
  to me at first.</p>

  <p>North of Tamarizia was Zollaria, inhabited by a far more
  warlike race. Its despotic government had long cast a covetous
  eye on the Central Sea, through which, and the rivers emptying
  into its expanse, most of the profitable trade lanes were
  reached. Tamarizia, controlling the western Gateway, had
  remained master even after the fall of Mazhur, collecting toll
  from the Zollarian craft on her rivers despite the foothold
  gained on her northern coast.</p>

  <p>East of Tamarizia, beyond Bithur and Milidhur, lay
  Mazzeria, peopled by a race little above the aborigine in
  their social life. Tatar-like, the Mazzerians shaved their
  heads of all save a single tuft of hair, with a most
  remarkable effect, since the race was blue of complexion and
  the prevailing color of their hair was red.</p>

  <p>Mazzeria, at the time of Croft's incursion into the
  planet's affairs, was the acknowledged ally of Zollaria,
  although at peace with Tamarizia. In earlier times, however,
  numbers of them had been taken captive in border wars and
  brought to both nations as slaves. These, in so far as
  Tamarizia was concerned, had later been freed and given
  citizenship of a degree constituting in their ranks the lowest
  or serving caste.</p>

  <p>Each state was governed by a king, by hereditary
  succession, in conjunction with a national assembly consisting
  of a delegate elected by each ten thousand or deckerton of
  civil population. The occupant of the imperial throne was
  elected for a period of ten years by vote of the several
  states.</p>

  <p>On Croft's advent, Scythys&mdash;a dotard&mdash;had been
  king of Cathur, with his son Kyphallos, the crown prince, a
  profligate of the worst type, sunk under the charms of
  Kalamita, a Zollarian adventuress of great beauty, with whom
  he had plotted the surrender of Cathur to her nation in return
  for the Tamarizian throne with Kalamita by, his side.</p>

  <p>Jadgor of Aphur, scenting the danger, had sought to bind
  the northern prince to Tamarizian fealty through a marriage
  with Naia, his sister's child. To win Naia and overthrow
  Zollaria's scheme had been Jason's task. The introduction of
  both the motor and firearms enabled him to overthrow the
  flower of Zollaria's hosts on a couple of bloody fields.
  Victory gained and Zollaria forced to cede Mazhur after fifty
  years of occupation, Croft prevailed upon the nation to accept
  a democratic form of government, it being at the end of
  Emperor Tamhys's term. This was accomplished without too much
  difficulty.</p>

  <p>As to the Tamarizians themselves, they were a white and
  well-formed race. Their women held equal place with men. They
  believed in the spirit and a future life. They had made no
  small progress in the sciences and arts. They worked metal,
  gold being as common as iron on Palos.</p>

  <p>They tempered copper also and used it in innumerable ways.
  They wove fabrics of great beauty, one being a blend of
  vegetable fiber and spun gold. They cut and polished jewels.
  They had a system of judiciaries and courts and a medical and
  surgical knowledge of sorts.</p>

  <p>They were a fairly moral and naturally modest people. Their
  clothing was worn for protection and ornamentation, rather
  than for any other purpose. It was donned and doffed as the
  occasion required, without comment being aroused. In women it
  consisted, rich and poor, of a single garment falling to the
  knee or just below it, cinctured about the body and caught
  over one shoulder by a jeweled or metal boss, leaving the
  other shoulder, arm, and upper chest exposed. To this was
  added sandals of leather, metal, or wood, held to the foot by
  a toe and instep band and lacings running well up the
  calves.</p>

  <p>Men of wealth and soldiers generally wore metal casings,
  jointed to the sandal to permit of motion and extending upward
  to the knees. Men of caste wore also a soft shirt or chemise
  beneath a metal cuirass or embroidered tunic. Save on formal
  occasions the serving classes wore a narrow cincture about the
  loins.</p>

  <p>Agriculture was highly developed, and they had advanced far
  in architecture, painting and sculpture. They lavished much
  time and expense in beautifying their homes. They had
  well-constructed caravan roads. As Croft had pointed out, he
  found them an intelligent race waiting, ready to be trained to
  a wider craft.</p>

  <p>And among them, in Naia of Aphur, he believed he had found
  his twin soul. And he had set about winning her in a fashion
  such as no other man, I frankly believe, would have dared.</p>

  <p>He had won her according to his belief and returned to
  earth, for the last time, ere he should return and make her
  his bride. He had told me about it, and he had cast off his
  earthly body, severing the last tie that held him from his
  life in Palos. He had died.</p>

  <p>He had gone back and found his plans disarranged through
  the actions of Zud, the high priest of Zitra, the capital city
  of Hiranur, where he had left Naia waiting his return in the
  Temple of Ga, the Eternal Mother&mdash;the Eternal Woman, in
  the Zitran pyramid. Zud, moved by Croft's works and by a story
  told him by Abbu, a priest who knew Jason's story, had
  proclaimed him Mouthpiece of Zitu, thereby raising an
  insurmountable barrier, as it seemed, between him and Naia,
  since celibacy was one of the tenets of the Tamarizian
  priests. And yet Croft had won her, overcoming all obstacles,
  even winning a second war, with all Mazzeria egged on, her
  armies officered by Zollarians in disguise this time, ere he
  gained the goal of his desire.</p>

  <p>These things had been told me inside the last few weeks by
  No. 27&mdash;the man who had been committed to the institution
  for a dissociation of personality, at which he quietly laughed
  after he had obtained my ear; because he wished to gain
  contact with me, who knew his former story, and win my aid
  toward the fulfillment of his mission.</p>

  <p>Only he wasn't dead, and I knew it as I lay there with the
  names of men and women of the Palosian world buzzing in my
  head. He had gone back to them, now that his work was
  ended&mdash;to Naia, his golden-haired, purple-eyed
  mate&mdash;to Lakkon, her father; to Jadgor, her uncle, and
  Robur his son, governor now of Aphur in the palace where his
  father, president of the Tamarizian republic, had been king;
  to Robur, who, like a second Jonathan, had ever been Croft's
  loyal assistant and friend, and Gaya his sweet and matronly
  wife; to Magur, high priest of Himyra, the ruling red city of
  Aphur, by whom Croft and Naia were betrothed, to Zud himself,
  to whom he had taught the truth of astral control. And I found
  myself portraying them as Croft had described them,
  predicating their thoughts and feelings, as I might have done
  those of any man or woman I knew on earth.</p>

  <p>Actually I was projecting my intellect, if not my
  consciousness, to Palos. The thought came to me. In spirit, if
  not in perception, I was there for the moment with my friend.
  In spirit at least I was bridging with little effort billions
  of actual miles. Thought and spirit and soul. They are strange
  things. Croft, if I was any judge, had gone back to
  Naia&mdash;and there was I lying, picturing the scene, where
  she waited for his coming in their home high in the western
  mountains of Aphur, given to them by Lakkon, a wedding gift,
  after the war with Mazzeria was won. Croft had gone back to
  Palos, and here was I picturing the thing in my spirit,
  certainly as plainly as any earth scene I had ever known.</p>

  <p>His body would be lying there, covered with soft fabrics,
  waiting for its tenant on a couch of wine-red wood such as the
  Tamarizians used&mdash;or perhaps of molded copper. And
  Naia&mdash;the woman who had given him her life, would be
  watching, watching for the first stir of his returning.</p>

  <p>Only&mdash;I smiled&mdash;Croft had told me he could gain
  Palos as quickly in the consciousness as I could project
  myself there in my mind&mdash;so, by now, that stirring of her
  strong man's limbs, beneath the eyes of the fair watcher, had
  occurred, and once more those two were together.</p>

  <p>I smiled again.</p>

  <p>The picture of that reunion appealed. There was nothing
  else to it at the instant. For even in my wildest imaginings I
  did not in the least suspect what its nearness, its clearness,
  the vividness of its seeming, might portend.</p>

  <p>No, even though I myself had delved more or less deeply
  into occult lore, with a resulting knowledge of the subject
  that had brought about the sympathetic understanding of all
  Croft had told me from first to last, I had little or no
  conception that night of the inward meaning of the
  distinctness with which I could conjure up the scene of his
  return to Naia, or to where the ability might lead. Rather, I
  felt merely that through his narrative of her wooing he had
  built up within my mental cells a picture of the fair girl now
  his bride, so clear, so positive in seeming, that to me she
  appeared no more than a charming personality&mdash;a feminine
  acquaintance, such as one might on occasion meet. She was no
  more removed, so far as my feeling of familiarity with her was
  concerned, than had her residence been not on Palos, but
  simply across the street. It is so easy to bridge distance in
  the mind.</p>

  <p>I slept after a time, as one will, drifting from continued
  thought upon one subject into slumber. And I woke with the
  thought of Croft's weird homecoming still in mind. It stayed
  with me more or less, too, in the succeeding days.</p>

  <p>Naia of Aphur! Oddly I dwelt upon her. Jason himself had
  told me that she knew me&mdash;had actually seen me&mdash;that
  he had brought her to earth more than once in the astral
  body&mdash;had pointed me out to her as the one earth man who
  knew and believed his story&mdash;that she looked upon me as a
  friend.</p>

  <p>The thing seemed some way to establish a sort of personal
  bond, just as the secret Croft and I had kept between us made
  me feel toward him as I have never felt toward any other
  man.</p>

  <p>Jason Croft and Naia of Aphur&mdash;the interplanetary
  lovers. It was certainly odd. I knew her, even though I had
  never seen her; save through the instrumentality of his
  description of her, and the resultant picture printed on my
  mind. Yet I could close my eyes at will and see her, slender,
  golden-haired, with her lips of flaming scarlet, and her
  violet-purple eyes.</p>

  <p>And I knew her home. I could lift it into my conscious
  perception as a familiar scene. I could imagine her moving
  about it, young, vibrant, happy, alone or with Croft by her
  side. I could fancy her bathing in the sun-warmed waters of
  the private bath in the garden&mdash;the gleam of her form
  against the clear yellow stone of which it was
  constructed&mdash;until she seemed the little silver fish
  Croft had called her, disporting in a bowl of gold, behind the
  white, screening, vine-clad walls. Or I could dream of her
  walking about the grounds, with the giant Canor&mdash;the
  huge, doglike creature she called Hupor, who was at once her
  pet, her companion, and guard. Distant? Why, she seemed no
  more distant to me in the days after Croft had gone back to be
  with her when her child would be born than some fair maid of
  earth waiting for the coming of her lover across a dividing
  wall in an adjacent yard.</p>

  <p>And yet so blind is the objective mind, that even then I
  did not suspect I had established a sympathetic chain of
  interest between the atmosphere of her existence and myself,
  capable of stretching out to a most peculiar climax in the
  end. Then, one night something over a month after No. 27 had
  died and been laid away, I dreamed.</p>

  <p>I don't say I thought of it as a dream at the time. Then it
  was all too seriously, too grippingly, real to seem other than
  the actual thing. It was only after it was over that I thought
  of it as a dream&mdash;perhaps because, despite the occurrence
  and all Croft had told me, I was still not fully
  convinced.</p>

  <p>Later&mdash;well, that's the story. I'll let it unfold
  itself.</p>

  <p>I went to bed that night and fell asleep. How long I slept
  I do not know. But a voice disturbed my slumbers after a time.
  At least it disturbed the restful unconsciousness of my
  spirit. To this day I am not sure whether or not my body
  moved.</p>

  <p>"Murray&mdash;Murray." I heard it, dimly at first, but
  insistent. It kept repeating, itself over and over. Beyond
  doubt someone was demanding my attention. I sought to
  rouse.</p>

  <p>"Murray&mdash;in the name of Zitu&mdash;and
  Azil&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I stiffened my attention. It was nothing short of startling
  to hear those words spoken.</p>

  <p>Zitu was God in the Tamarizian language, as I knew, and
  Azil was the Angel of Life&mdash;as Ga was the Virgin Mother.
  Ga and Azil&mdash;the mother and the life-bringer&mdash;they
  were the ones to whom the Tamarizian women most frequently
  prayed. I gave over my endeavor to waken my sleeping body and
  lay straining the ears of my spirit to the voice.</p>

  <p>It came again. Whoever the speaker was, he seemed to know
  he had stirred my conscious perception.</p>

  <p>"Murray&mdash;I need your advice&mdash;your council. Naia
  needs you. It's life and death, Murray. You told me you would
  gladly render her assistance as a physician. Murray&mdash;will
  you come?"</p>

  <p>My spirit staggered. It was most amazing. For now I knew
  that the speaker was Jason Croft.</p>

  <p>I knew that he was appealing to me in the name of Zitu and
  Azil&mdash;in the name of motherhood&mdash;that he was calling
  on me as a brother physician, by the oath of my
  profession&mdash;in the name of all that was highest and
  holiest in life.</p>

  <p>I knew that Naia's hour was upon her&mdash;and I knew it as
  clearly as if the thing were taking place somewhere within a
  neighboring home on earth. I lay and let the knowledge beat in
  upon me. I recalled in a flash all he had told me concerning
  medical knowledge on Palos. If some complication in the birth
  of their child impended, there would be none on that far
  planet to whom he could turn for aid. He knew more than all
  the physicians of Palos put together, but&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Murray!" the voice repeated. "Murray, in the name of
  God!"</p>

  <p>There was a desperate urge&mdash;a desperate plaint about
  it. I reached a decision.</p>

  <p>I had never married. There was no one dependent upon me.
  With a strange thrill I realized the fact. If I failed to
  return from this strangest of calls to which a medical man was
  ever bidden, if the body of me were not to be revived, I would
  be little missed.</p>

  <p>So what did it matter? A man&mdash;or most men&mdash;surely
  could die but once; and how better than in performing the duty
  of a physician, in an endeavor to save other life? I recall
  now that such thoughts flitted swiftly through my brain, and
  left me ready to dare the venture suggested by Croft's voice,
  if thereby I might render an intimate service to him and Naia
  of Aphur, in spirit if not in the flesh. "Murray!"</p>

  <p>Again the agony of a strong man's appeal for all he held
  dearest in existence.</p>

  <p>I think the lips of my sleeping material being must have
  moved at last. Be that as it may, I know I answered:</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>And I know Croft sensed my acquiescence, for his response
  was beating into my consciousness in a flash.</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;fix your mind on our home in the western
  mountains, visualize it, Murray, as I have described it to
  you. Will your conscious presence within it. I shall be
  waiting for you. Call up the scene and demand that our will be
  granted. Think of nothing else."</p>

  <p>Save for the directions for reaching to him, the thing was
  as real as a telephone message, and the assurance that the
  husband of your patient would be waiting your arrival at his
  house. But there was about Croft's promise to await my coming
  a definite note of conviction in my ability to encompass our
  mutual purpose that aided me most materially in what followed,
  as I now confess.</p>

  <p>He was so seemingly sure that I would not fail
  them&mdash;that what assistance I could render would be
  granted&mdash;that for the time being it overthrew all doubt
  of success. Too, I had grown so accustomed to thinking of Naia
  of Aphur as a woman&mdash;a palpitating creature of radiant
  flesh and blood&mdash;that the very reality of her seeming
  robbed somewhat of its weirdness, its eerie quality, the fact
  that I was about to respond in the astral body to an urgent
  medical call. Consciously then I sought to follow Croft's
  directions.</p>

  <p>I fastened my thought on his Aphurian home.</p>

  <p>I strove to exclude everything else from my mind. I brought
  up the picture of it as a thing at the end of a distant vista,
  down which I must pass to attain it, and&mdash;all at once
  that picture moved!</p>

  <p>I say it moved, because that is how it at first appeared.
  At all events, it seemed to come toward me with amazing
  swiftness.</p>

  <p>For an instant my comprehension faltered, and then I knew.
  I knew I had gained my purpose&mdash;that I was astrally out
  of my body, even though I had not known the instant when I had
  left it; that I was speeding with incredible rapidity toward
  the scene into which I had wished to be projected; that
  darkness was all about me, like an impenetrable wall; that I
  was like one in an infinite, an interminable tunnel, with the
  lighted picture I had conjured up at the end.</p>

  <p>Then that too faded, dissolved, lost its comprehensive
  quality, and gave place to more finite detail, and&mdash;I was
  in a room. But it was not strange. I knew it&mdash;recognized
  it instantly, thanks to Croft's previous words.</p>

  <p>Its walls were hung with purple hangings shot through with
  threads of gold. There was a shallow pool of water in its
  center edged round with white and golden tiles. Beside it on a
  pedestal of wine-red wood there stood a figure&mdash;the form
  of a man straining upward as if for flight, with outstretched
  arms and uplifted wings, translucent&mdash;formed of a
  substance not unlike alabaster&mdash;the shape of Azil.</p>

  <p>That too I recognized in a flash, and I seemed to catch my
  breath. At last I was on Palos! This was Azil, the Angel of
  Life, before me&mdash;poised by the mirror pool in the chamber
  of Naia of Aphur&mdash;ablaze now with the light of many
  incandescent bulbs in copper sconces against the walls. All
  this I saw, and became conscious that, as well as light, the
  chamber was now full of life.</p>

  <p>Naia of Aphur! She lay before me on a copper-moulded
  couch&mdash;and I turned my eyes upon her, her body beneath
  coverings of silklike fabric.</p>

  <p>A woman, of whom two were in attendance, wearing the blue
  garment embroidered with a scarlet heart above the left
  breast&mdash;the badge of the nursing craft, as Jason had told
  me&mdash;spoke to Naia in soothing accents the words of which
  I could not understand.</p>

  <p>"Murray!"</p>

  <p>Whirling, I beheld Jason Croft. Rather, I seemed to see two
  Jason Crofts, instead of one. One sat in a chair of the same
  wine-red wood of which the pedestal supporting Azil was
  formed, in the posture of a man in more than mortal slumber.
  One floated toward me, ghostlike&mdash;a shimmering, shifting,
  vaporlike semblance of the other as to physical shape.</p>

  <p>And it was this second Croft that seemed to speak.</p>

  <p>I say seemed, because as I recall the episode now I know
  that communication was in reality by thought transference,
  although it appeared then to reach the understanding in the
  form of spoken words. It came over me instantly that Jason,
  had purposely assumed the astral condition to welcome me on my
  arrival here.</p>

  <p>I had been too much occupied with my surroundings until
  then to give thought to my own possible appearance. But as I
  put out a hand in answer to his single word of greeting, I
  found it no more than a thin, diaphanous cloud. I was even as
  he was&mdash;a nebulous something. Still, that was to be
  expected. I put it aside and considered the man before me. The
  features of his astral presence were actually haggard, marked
  by a suffering plainly mental, yet akin in its way to the
  lines that contorted Naia of Aphur's face in her present
  mortal woe.</p>

  <p>"Croft, in God's name what is the trouble?" I asked as once
  more a low sound of smothered anguish came from the couch
  behind me.</p>

  <p>Nor do I think I overshot the mark in declaring what
  followed to have been the most remarkable medical consultation
  mortal man might know. He lost no time in explaining the
  situation. It wasn't his way.</p>

  <p>He gave me at once an exact and scientific understanding of
  her condition, ending his narration simply:</p>

  <p>"Murray, you know how I love her. I faced the thing as long
  as I could have alone. And then&mdash;knowing all that
  depended on me&mdash;I became unnerved, and called for you.
  There was no one else&mdash;and you'd said you'd be glad to
  attend her. Can you blame me, my friend, now that you see
  her?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head in negation, turning it for an instant
  toward the glorious woman shape on the copper bed. "Can she
  see me? Does she know I am here? Can I speak with her?" I
  questioned.</p>

  <p>"She will sense your presence at least," Croft said. "I
  shall revivify my body and draw the chair in which it is
  sitting close beside the couch. You will sit there, Murray,
  and I shall tell her you are present, watching, nerving me to
  my task, before I set to work. She knows I called you, Murray,
  and now you must help us both. Your brain must use my hands to
  save her. Come&mdash;what do you advise me to do, Murray?"</p>

  <p>I told him as soon as he had brought his almost panting
  response to an end. His exposition of the problem we faced had
  made it dreadfully plain.</p>

  <p>He heard me out and then nodded with set lips.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I'll do it, Murray," he said. "I&mdash;I felt it
  was the thing, but&mdash;without counsel&mdash;simply on my
  own judgment, I could not do it. And&mdash;you must coach me.
  I'll work in a purely subjective condition. That way, even in
  the body, I'll be able to sense the guiding impulse of your
  brain. God, man, how I need you! Come!"</p>

  <p>The form beside me vanished. The body in the chair flung up
  its head and rose. It pushed the chair it had occupied quite
  to the side of the copper couch, and bent to speak to the
  woman who lay upon it.</p>

  <p>I followed. I sank into the seat provided. Croft
  straightened. Naia turned her head directly toward me.</p>

  <p>I looked for the first time into her violet-purple
  eyes.</p>

  <p>They were clear, steadfast, flawless as a perfect amethyst,
  though darkened by the ordeal through which she was
  passing&mdash;the eyes of a true woman, high-spirited, brave,
  loyal, and pure. They strained toward me. And suddenly she
  threw out a perfectly rounded arm, a slender hand, as one who
  asks for succor. Her lips parted, and once more she smiled, a
  smile so wistfully yearning that my whole heart answered its
  appeal.</p>

  <p>This was Naia of Aphur&mdash;wife of my friend Jason Croft.
  In that instant I felt she was worth all that he had dared to
  win her. This was Naia, the woman who months ago had told him
  that in the silence of the night she had heard the beating of
  the wings of Azil, the bringer of new life, because of which I
  was here now beside her in that holiest of moments in a
  medical man's existence, when with hand and brain he waits to
  welcome a new life's birth.</p>

  <p>Her lips moved. Distinctly I heard her speak:</p>

  <p>"Dr. Murray&mdash;good friend of my beloved, who tells me
  of your presence in response to his appeal for your assistance
  to us&mdash;I bid you welcome to our home. Thrice welcome are
  you, upon whose coming depends, as he tells me also, our
  future happiness together, as well as the life of our
  child."</p>

  <p>She addressed me most surprisingly in English, until I
  bethought me that Croft had doubtless taught her the tongue,
  exactly as he had taught her so much else; to fly the first
  airplane in Palos, the control of the astral body itself. Her
  words moved me oddly. I rose to answer:</p>

  <p>"I am more than happy to be here, Princess Naia, and to bid
  you be of good cheer, remembering that even now Azil stands
  close by the gateway of life, in charge of a newborn
  soul."</p>

  <p>And then I sank back, confused. I had spoken wholly on
  impulse, voicing the inmost emotions of my heart, forgetting
  my nebulous condition entirely for the instant, in the spell
  of what seemed so real. With a feeling akin to acute annoyance
  at my inability to speak thus to her directly I resumed my
  chair.</p>

  <p>But even so, it seemed that I had reached her&mdash;that in
  some way akin to that in which Croft had assured me he would
  be able to follow my mental direction while working, she had
  sensed my meaning and intention. Women are intuitive by
  nature, more susceptible to the waves of a personal or thought
  vibration. Her lips moved again as I ceased speaking.</p>

  <p>"Azil," she whispered. "But&mdash;that new soul is so long
  in passing, my friend."</p>

  <p>I turned to Croft.</p>

  <p>"Come," I hurled my thought force toward him. "Let us spare
  her more bodily anguish than must be endured. Let us make an
  end."</p>

  <p>Of what followed I shall say no word. Suffice it to state
  that Jason Croft labored, grim of lips and pallid of feature;
  that I sat in that weirdest position of assistance capable of
  conception; that the lights burned on in that room where the
  pale form of Azil spread his wings on the pedestal of wine-red
  wood; that the eyes of Naia of Aphur widened until they were
  two dark pools no more than fringed by the purple iris; that
  the two female attendants waited, intent on naught save the
  catching, the rendering of obedience to each of Croft's
  intense though low-pitched words.</p>

  <p>And then suddenly the man turned to me a face transfigured
  past anything I had ever pictured&mdash;a thread of
  sound&mdash;a wailing, trailing vibration&mdash;the first note
  of waking vocal strings, pulsed through the room&mdash;and
  Jason Croft the physician, the father, was kneeling beside
  that couch of copper, no longer the iron-nerved worker, the
  laborer for unborn life, but the husband, the lover, clasping
  the slender body of Naia of Aphur in his arms, and shaken by a
  strong man's sobs. I turned away my eyes.</p>

  <p>And then his voice boomed out, strangely exalted and
  triumphant:</p>

  <p>"Murray&mdash;we win&mdash;win, man&mdash;thanks to you
  and&mdash;God!"</p>

  <p>I turned back. Croft spoke to one of the attendants. She
  crossed to a curtained doorway and lifted the purple drapings.
  There stole into the room a girl of Mazzeria&mdash;a graceful
  creature, for all the odd blue color of her skin. Twin braids
  of ruddy hair fell from her head to her waist. Her figure held
  all the untrammeled litheness of a panther as she advanced.
  Across her outstretched arms she bore a pure white cloth.</p>

  <p>Upon it, the child of Jason Croft and Naia of Aphur was
  placed.</p>

  <p>She wrapped the fabric about it, cradling it against her
  breast. She turned to Naia, smiling, sinking down beside her
  on her supple rounded thighs.</p>

  <p>And then&mdash;for one brief instant I saw the light of the
  Madonna flame in those wonderful eyes&mdash;the light with
  which Naia the mother looked first on Jason's&mdash;son.</p>

  <p>Croft addressed me.</p>

  <p>"Maia," he said softly. "I've described her to you before
  if you remember, Murray. She asked that you might be permitted
  to attend the&mdash;the little one."</p>

  <p>His voice broke. His face was weary, overstrained, worn. I
  understood. The graceful girl was Naia's personal
  attendant&mdash;the Mazzerian woman, who had aided her
  mistress in saving Croft's life at a time when he was taken
  captive during the Mazzerian war. I nodded my comprehension.
  He bent again as though by irresistible attraction above the
  couch where the blue girl still was kneeling, and Naia seemed
  waiting his undivided attention. Once more I turned my head.
  It was the holy moment&mdash;the hour of realization between
  man and woman.</p>

  <p>Through the half-drawn curtains of a window, light stole
  into the room. It shamed the incandescents in their sconces. A
  finger of golden glory touched the tips of the upflung wings
  of Azil. With a start, I realized that the night of anguish
  was ended&mdash;that new life had come into the house of Jason
  with&mdash;the dawn.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">II. &mdash; THE CHRISTENING</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I WENT toward the curtains and stood looking
  out between them, removing so far as I could even my invisible
  presence from the tableau behind me.</p>

  <p>The attendants were moving about. I heard the soft pad of
  their gnuppa-hide sandaled feet, the softened tones of their
  voices. I heard Naia speaking and Croft's deeply quivering
  answer, and once more the wail of the child.</p>

  <p>"Murray," Jason was speaking to me. I sensed his touch on
  my arm. Again he was in astral form. "Come, while the women
  perform their task."</p>

  <p>My glance shot beyond him to where his physical body was
  seemingly lost in a lethargy of exhaustion, once more in the
  red wood chair. It did more. It fell on Naia. The ray of
  sunlight had lowered as Sirius had mounted above the eastern
  horizon. It made her golden tresses seem more than ever an
  aureole about her face on the pillow&mdash;a face grown
  exquisitely tender, lighted not merely with the sun of
  morning, but by the inner, the newly ignited glow of
  motherhood. I turned from it and followed Croft through the
  curtained doorway of the chamber, onto the balcony, along
  which one approached the room.</p>

  <p>He had described it minutely to me, but even so I marveled
  at it as we stood together, sensing its proportions, its
  brilliant yet not offensive blendings of yellow and white and
  red. White was the balcony rail about it, red and yellow the
  alternating tiles that paved its floors. Red and yellow, too,
  were the steps of the stairs that mounted to the balcony from
  either end of the court, and red the carven pillars that
  supported the balcony on a series of arches, between which
  pure white examples of Palosian sculpture showed. Golden were
  the plates of glass in the roof above us&mdash;open mainly now
  to the air of heaven, that the flowers and plants and shrubs
  which dotted the unpaved portions of the court beneath us
  might breathe.</p>

  <p>And then I think I must have started very much as Croft
  himself had done the first time he beheld such a sight, as I
  became conscious of a man, blue as the blue girl of Mazzeria
  in the room behind me, wearing upon his shaven poll a single
  flaming tuft of red. He was a stalwart man, and he bore a skin
  equipped with a sprinkling-nozzle upon his back while he
  sprayed the beds of growing vegetation&mdash;accompanied in
  his occupation by a slow-stalking beast remarkably like a
  hound.</p>

  <p>Croft noted the direction of my glance and manner.
  "Mitlos&mdash;our majordomo, and Hupor," he said and smiled.
  "Zitu man, when I told you about them, the last thing I
  dreamed was that some day you should see them."</p>

  <p>"And now?" I returned with a strange inclination to chuckle
  as I thought that Jason was no longer alone in being the first
  mortal to reach Palos in the astral presence, even though his
  potent will had helped me to my present position.</p>

  <p>"And now"&mdash;he laughed in a tone of
  exultation&mdash;"you see not only them, but me, husband of
  Tamarizia's most beautiful woman, and thanks to you&mdash;the
  father of her child." -</p>

  <p>"Nonsense," I exclaimed, doubly abashed by his praise and
  my thoughts of a moment before, "I did nothing&mdash;what can
  a ghost accomplish?"</p>

  <p>He turned fully toward me. His eyes burned with the strong
  fire of his spirit.</p>

  <p>"I came here even as you are, Murray, and"&mdash;he waved a
  hand in a comprehensive gesture&mdash;"I have accomplished
  this, and other things besides&mdash;yet not so much that this
  morning&mdash;the most wonderful of all my span of existence,
  I have either words or deeds in which the assistance your
  presence within the last few hours gave me, may be
  repaid."</p>

  <p>And no matter how he voiced it, I knew he meant It. The
  sincerity of his feeling forced itself upon me.</p>

  <p>"Let us not speak of payment," I said&mdash;and I confess I
  felt embarrassed by the value he seemed to place upon what was
  no more than my agreement with his own valuation of a now
  favorably passed condition. "As it happens, Croft, my presence
  here was no more than the granting of an expressed wish."</p>

  <p>He nodded. "The thought is father to the deed&mdash;isn't
  it, Murray? I thought of that last night. Come&mdash;I'll show
  you about the place."</p>

  <p>Turning he led the way along the balcony to one end. We
  went down the red and yellow stairs.</p>

  <p>At their foot was a group of sculpture&mdash;the figure of
  a man straining to defend a crouching woman from the fangs of
  a rending beast. It was of heroic size and wonderfully perfect
  in detail. I recalled it from Croft's description of it, and
  how once he had told Naia that so he would defend her were his
  right to do so granted. Well&mdash;last night I had seen him
  do it. I had seen him strain body and soul to guard her from
  the yawning jaws of death. I said as much.</p>

  <p>He gave me a glance. "You're an odd sort, Murray. You've a
  lot of the symbolism, the mysticism of life in your makeup.
  Come along. Let's get a breath of the morning air
  outside."</p>

  <p>Once more I followed his lead across the red and yellow
  court where unknown plants bloomed about us on every side.
  Mitlos, intent on his duties, knew not of our passing, but
  Hupor sensed us, I think, and turned his huge head toward us,
  and stood looking at us out of amber eyes. Then we were
  outside the arch of a doorway at the head of a flight of pure
  white steps, on a far-reaching esplanade.</p>

  <p>On every hand there were mountains, wooded on their sides.
  The house stood on one side of a natural mountain valley, in
  the emerald cup of which was a tiny lake, its waters gilded
  now by the rays of the Dog Star. And winding past it, and off
  along the flank of the hills in a series of perfect tangents
  was a wonderfully metaled road. I followed its turnings until
  I lost them, and my vision found itself baffled by a further
  reach of the landscape, blanketed as it seemed beneath a
  singular dun-colored haze.</p>

  <p>In its way the scene was not unlike that of a morning on
  earth. I turned my eyes back to the dim shape of Croft beside
  me. He lifted an arm. "Over there is Himyra," he said,
  pointing, "but a ground fog is hiding the desert. If you'll
  look across it, however, you'll see a silver sort of shimmer.
  That's the Central Sea,"</p>

  <p>Himyra&mdash;the capital of Aphur&mdash;the Central Sea.
  And this was Palos. The weirdness of the whole adventure came
  upon me. It was hard to realize. And the sun up there was
  Sirius and not the sun to which I was accustomed.</p>

  <p>Abruptly Jason chuckled. "Murray&mdash;do you remember the
  night my housekeeper thought I had died, and routed you out in
  a storm, and you came to my house and compelled me to return
  from Palos by the infernal insistence of your will? Well, tit
  for tat, old man. That night I did your bidding, but last
  night I called you here."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," I assented, smiling. In a way his remark seemed
  to lighten the atmosphere between us. I caught sight of a
  rapidly moving object. "Look there, Croft&mdash;that's one of
  your motors or some sort of speedy contraption coming up the
  road."</p>

  <p>He glanced down the course of what I could not but agree he
  had done well at first to compare to the ancient highways of
  the Romans because of its permanent type of construction.</p>

  <p>"Lakkon, by Zitu!" he exclaimed. "I telephoned him last
  night, but&mdash;I'd forgotten all about him. He said he'd
  drive out the first thing in the morning, and he seems to be
  burning the wind. See here&mdash;I'll have to leave you,
  Murray, long enough to welcome grandpa, if you don't
  mind."</p>

  <p>I nodded. Lakkon was Naia's father. And it was no more than
  natural surely that he should be hastening to her, especially
  as she was the old noble's only child.</p>

  <p>"Run along," I said. "There's plenty to look at. I'll amuse
  myself," Then, as an afterthought, I added, "Only don't spend
  too much time with him. I've got to be getting out of here,
  Croft, or someone's likely to fancy Dr. Murray is dead."</p>

  <p>It had just occurred to me that it was morning also on
  earth and that unless I returned to my body, I couldn't tell
  what might happen in the institution of which I was the
  head.</p>

  <p>Croft understood my meaning.</p>

  <p>"You're right. I'll be as brief as possible," he agreed and
  vanished, leaving me quite to my own devices.</p>

  <p>I smiled. If one considered it was rather odd to be telling
  a man to go get back inside his own body in order to welcome
  his father-in-law in the flesh&mdash;or to contemplate a
  return flight across billions of ethereal miles to accomplish
  a reunion between my material body and myself. Myself. I took
  a deep breath of the mountain air&mdash;at least, I went
  through the conscious effort with all the satisfaction of
  fulfillment. I was myself, really. I felt it, knew
  it&mdash;and I felt a buoyancy, a lightness, such as I had
  never known before now that the weight, the restraint of the
  body was removed.</p>

  <p>I stood and watched Lakkon's motor arrive. I saw Croft's
  material form stalk forth to meet him at the head of the
  stairs. I saw Lakkon descend from his car and hurry upward,
  the strong figure of a man with graying hair, an expectant
  light in his beardless face. I marked his dress.</p>

  <p>It consisted of a tunic of purple, embroidered with an
  intricate design in small green stones, skirted, falling to
  just above the knees, and the metal, ankle-jointed combination
  of graeves and sandals Croft had described, plainly fashioned
  of gold, and reaching above the bulge of his muscular
  calves.</p>

  <p>He met Croft and crashed his flat palm upon his shoulder
  with an exultant gesture. Croft extended his arm and laid his
  hand on Lakkon's shoulder. The two men passed inside.</p>

  <p>I turned away. There was something vastly formal, vastly
  ancient, about that greeting&mdash;an old world
  atmosphere&mdash;that spoke of age-long custom, despite the
  throbbing motor in which the noble had reached the house of
  his daughter. There was almost something Biblical about it,
  the thought came to me. They had met and laid their hands on
  each other's shoulders&mdash;two strong men, and looked into
  one another's eyes. I knew it the Tamarizian greeting of
  unfaltering friendship, no more a greeting than a pledge.</p>

  <p>Well, then, Lakkon had gone to see his daughter. I gave a
  glance to the driver of his motor&mdash;a chap dressed plainly
  in blue unembroidered tunic, and copper leg-casings, with a
  fillet supporting a sun screening drape of purple fabric,
  about his head. Then I turned and made my way into the garden.
  It had occurred to me to examine the private bath.</p>

  <p>I found it, screened behind vine-clad walls, and slipped
  inside it, past a staggered entrance wall that screened its
  gate.</p>

  <p>It lay before me, a limpid pool in a basin of lemon stone
  like, onyx save that it was neither mottled nor veined. It
  shimmered in the Sirian ray, an oblong of water as brilliant
  as a bit of polished silver, inside the expanse of the
  enclosure, paved with alternating squares of rock-crystal and
  pure white stone. I stood gazing upon, it, recalling that it
  was here Croft had once met Naia of Aphur&mdash;the first time
  when in defiance of all social custom on Palos, she had
  yielded him her lips.</p>

  <p>Then I went back to the front of the house, and seated
  myself on a carven stone bench. I lifted my eyes to the
  light-filled heavens. This was Palos&mdash;and up there
  somewhere or down or sidewise&mdash;or however you chose to
  call it&mdash;was earth. It was like Omar as to direction when
  he says:</p>

  <p>"For Is and Is not though with rule and line And Up and
  Down without, I can define&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Anyway, out there somewhere in the void there floated the
  mundane sphere, where the body of me might even now be
  exciting consternation among the staff of the hospital, where
  it had been moved and held a little prestige in its work. And
  here was I. Suddenly there stole over me the sensation that
  the whole thing was a dream excited by Jason's stories&mdash;a
  feeling that I ought to rouse myself and get about my
  business. I rose. I felt all at once restless, vaguely
  disturbed. I turned and found Jason beside me.</p>

  <p>"I was longer than I meant to be, Murray," he said. "And,
  see here&mdash;I know you'll understand me when I tell you
  it's past ten o'clock on earth."</p>

  <p>I nodded. It was no time for misunderstanding or niceties
  of speech. More and more I was finding myself filled with a
  vital urge&mdash;to be away from here and about my own
  affairs.</p>

  <p>"To tell the truth, with all respect to your feelings and
  those of Naia, I was getting impatient of your coming," I
  replied.</p>

  <p>"She sends you her deepest thanks, and the blessings of
  Zitu and Ga the Mother," he responded quickly. "I know you
  know how I feel, old fellow. Now fix your mind on your
  body&mdash;and try to open its eyes."</p>

  <p>I was ready. I put out a hand and laid it on his shoulder.
  He did the same. We looked into one another's faces.</p>

  <p>"Some time&mdash;you'll come again," Croft told me.
  "And&mdash;now that we've established the astral power, I'll
  come to you, Murray&mdash;and when I speak you will answer.
  Don't forget it. Man&mdash;mayhap we'll build Tamarizia up
  together&mdash;at least, I can come to you like this from now
  on for knowledge&mdash;conversation. Can you see where the
  thing may lead to?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said. "It's big, Croft&mdash;big. But if I don't
  get out of here now it may lead a very important part of me to
  the grave. Make my adieus to Naia. I'd envy you, man, if you
  weren't my friend. Now&mdash;do what you can to help me, for
  I'm going to try a pretty-broad jump, as such things are
  considered."</p>

  <p>I closed my eyes.</p>

  <p>A sound like splintering wood assailed my ears. A blended
  sound of voices beat upon them.</p>

  <p>"Murray&mdash;Murray&mdash;doctor!"</p>

  <p>There was no doubt about it. A very human voice was calling
  to me&mdash;a hand laid hold upon my shoulder&mdash;only it
  wasn't the hand Jason Croft had laid upon it in farewell. The
  thing bit into the flesh. It seemed trying to shake me.</p>

  <p>With an effort I lifted my lids and stared up into the face
  of a hospital orderly, strained and anxious. I was back on
  earth, there wasn't any doubt about it. I was on earth, in my
  room in the mental hospital and in bed.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said; "yes."</p>

  <p>The man's breath actually hissed as he let it out. He
  stammered. "You'll excuse us, doctor, but you didn't show up
  and you didn't answer when we
  rapped&mdash;and&mdash;well&mdash;we broke in the door at
  last. It seemed best."</p>

  <p>His use of the pronoun arrested my attention. I made
  another effort and sat up. The orderly had fallen back from my
  bedside as he spoke, and beyond him I saw a nurse&mdash;a
  woman&mdash;not blue-robed like those I had seen in Naia of
  Aphur's apartments, but crisply gowned in white&mdash;and back
  of her the door of my own chamber, sagging open with a broken
  lock.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, Hansen," I made answer. "I must have been
  pretty sound asleep." There wasn't anything else to say, any
  use to attempt fuller explanation. "What time is it?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Ten thirty," said the nurse, consulting a watch on her
  wrist. "You're sure you feel all right, doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," I nodded. "If you'll withdraw, I'll get
  up."</p>

  <p>She left the room and Hansen followed.</p>

  <p>I rose and began to dress. Outside a brilliant sunlight was
  visible through my windows. It showed me familiar objects. The
  Palosian landscape had faded. It had been after ten when Jason
  had come to me, to, as it were, speed a parting guest, and now
  it was half after ten, and I was back on earth. Well, he had
  told me the gulf could be bridged by the spirit in a
  flash.</p>

  <p>Or had he? I fumbled my way into my garments in a somewhat
  clumsy fashion. I felt odd. Just what had happened, I asked
  myself. And it was then that the thing began to seem like a
  dream to me, really, no matter how vividly real it had seemed
  while it occurred. Save only for that vividness I think I
  would have considered it no more than a dream indeed.</p>

  <p>But dream or not, it continued to go with me through all
  the familiar routine of the succeeding days. It kept bobbing
  up, in all its colorful details. I kept recalling that
  gorgeous chamber in which I had seen, or seemed to see, Naia
  of Aphur. I could even recall the soft thud of Lakkon's metal
  sandals as he mounted toward Jason, waiting to welcome him at
  the top of a flight of pure white stairs. And I could see
  again that light I had seen in the purple eyes of
  Naia&mdash;that exquisite look of the Madonna, I had seen in
  the faces of other new-made mothers, and in their eyes. Yes,
  if it had been a dream instead of an actual occurrence, it had
  been very, very real.</p>

  <p>For the life of me, I couldn't decide. The mind of me
  balked no matter what the spirit decreed. As an actual fact, I
  wanted to believe I was in a somewhat similar position to men
  I have known, who tried to accept a religion, feeling their
  salvation depended upon it, and yet could not quite compass
  full acceptance in the end.</p>

  <p>At the last I settled down to a sort of compromise with
  myself, based on my recollection of Croft's assertion that he
  would come to me some time for an astral conversation, similar
  to those meetings with Naia he had employed to sway her
  decision, before he finally won her and that I myself should
  visit Palos some time again. If those things happened I felt I
  could give credence without reservation.</p>

  <p>I did a lot of reading in Croft's books and waited. But he
  did not come.</p>

  <p>A month passed and a little more, approximately such a span
  of time as they called a Zitran on Palos, where the year was a
  trifle longer than ours, though divided in similar fashion
  into twelve periods. I had about settled back into acceptance
  of a completely corporeal routine, and then&mdash;once more I
  had word of Jason's son.</p>

  <p>"Murray&mdash;Murray," a voice whispered to me in my
  slumber.</p>

  <p>It roused me. I sat up, distinctly conscious of an
  intelligent presence in my room.</p>

  <p>"Murray&mdash;get out of that cloud, and let's talk," what
  seemed a whisper prompted.</p>

  <p>Something happened. Suddenly I was intensely awake, and I
  saw&mdash;the nebulous form of Jason, seated against the metal
  rail at the foot of my bed.</p>

  <p>"That's better. How would you like to take another trip to
  Palos?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>He smiled as he said it, and I answered in similar fashion.
  "If I can make the round trip a little quicker I wouldn't mind
  it. What's wrong up there now?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing's wrong up there. Everything's all right."</p>

  <p>His expression quickened. "But what happened?"</p>

  <p>I told him, and he nodded. "Well, this will be different as
  you'll get back before morning. Murray, both Naia and I want
  very much that you should be present in so far as you can, two
  nights from now, at the christening of our son."</p>

  <p>The christening of his son. The thing thrilled me. It was
  real then, and not a dream after all. I had really gone to
  Palos that night over a month ago, and now&mdash;Croft had
  kept his promise. He was here asking me to essay the venture
  again.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he said as I delayed my answer in the grip of
  full realization, "you'll see without being seen,
  but&mdash;after it's over&mdash;Naia wants to meet you
  astrally at least. Will you come?"</p>

  <p>Naia wanted to meet me. After the thing was over and the
  others were gone, we three would meet as Croft and I were
  meeting now and establish a personal relation.</p>

  <p>"Will I?" I exclaimed. "Well, rather."</p>

  <p>Croft smiled. "It will be a somewhat brilliant spectacle.
  You'll enjoy it."</p>

  <p>We talked for an hour after that, before he vanished, and I
  found myself sitting bolt upright in bed, staring into the
  darkness and filled with the firm conviction that on the
  second night from this I would witness the christening of
  Jason's son.</p>

  <p>That conviction went with me during the two succeeding days
  and it was with the positive expectation of its fulfillment
  that I locked myself in my room and stretched myself out on my
  bed the second night.</p>

  <p>I lay there and fixed my mind on the home of Lakkon in
  Himyra&mdash;the great red city of Aphur, where Croft had said
  the ceremony would occur. I pictured it even as I had pictured
  Jason's home in the mountains, its splendid court paved with
  the purest of rock-crystal&mdash;he had fancied it was glass
  when first he saw it&mdash;its circling balcony reached at
  either end of the court by yellow onyxlike stairs.</p>

  <p>I focused every vestige of my will on reaching to it,
  and&mdash;suddenly&mdash;it seemed that I heard Croft calling
  me just as he had said he would do; the sense of lightness, of
  untrammeled freedom I had experienced on the other occasion
  came upon me&mdash;and&mdash;I was there.</p>

  <p>Light, color. They were all around me. The flawless crystal
  of the floor caught the radiance from the lights above them in
  a million facets, broke it into a myriad hashing pin-points of
  refraction until the whole, vast court seemed paved with a
  shimmering iridescent carpet. White was the- balcony about it,
  and the pillars on which it was supported, and the gleaming
  bits of sculpture between. And the shrubs, the banks and
  hedges of vegetation, in the unpaved beds of the court were
  green, save that they were blooming, loaded down with colorful
  flowers everywhere.</p>

  <p>Tables aglitter with gold and glass stretched down the
  central portion of the sparkling pavement in the form of three
  sides of a rectangle, with a purple-draped dais at the closed
  end. Guests thronged the vast apartment, seated on chairs of
  wine-red wood or reclining on couches interspersed among the
  beds of flowering vegetation. Nodding plumes of every hue and
  shade graced the heads of the women. Of every grade of
  richness were their jewel-embroidered robes. Nor were their
  men-folk any whit behind them in the lavish ornamentation
  their tunics or metal cuirasses displayed.</p>

  <p>Men and women, they were like birds of brilliant plumage,
  and as the lights struck down upon them, save for the gleam of
  the bared arms and shoulders of the women, the glint of their
  fair limbs through the intricate slashings of their
  leg-casings and sandals of softest leathers, the rose tint of
  their knees, they blazed.</p>

  <p>A babble of voices&mdash;the rhythm of music from concealed
  harps, was in the room. I indulged in a single comprehensive
  glance and looked about for my hosts.</p>

  <p>But I did not find them anywhere among their guests. Nor
  did Jason appear to greet me, though that I did not expect. We
  had arranged between us that he should summon me just before
  the ceremony occurred, and that we would meet only after, the
  departure of the guests. Hence, failing to sight either Croft
  or Naia or even Lakkon, I made shift for myself.</p>

  <p>A trumpet blared with a softened tongue.</p>

  <p>I became aware of a page in purple garments, standing with
  the instrument at his lips, on the topmost tread of one of the
  flights of yellow stairs.</p>

  <p>The thrum of the hidden harps quickened. The assembled
  company rose. They stood and faced the stairway where, now,
  something in the nature of a ceremonial procession showed.</p>

  <p>Naia and Croft came first, Naia in white from the tips of
  her slender sandals to the feathers that nodded from a fillet
  of shimmering diamondlike jewels in the masses of her golden
  hair. Croft led her downward. He was in all his formal
  harness, golden cuirass, on the breast of which glowed the
  cross ansata and the wings of Azil in azure
  stones&mdash;golden graeves and sandals gem-incrusted, golden
  helmet supporting azure plumes.</p>

  <p>And after them came Maia, the blue girl of Mazzeria,
  bearing on a purple cushion, the child.</p>

  <p>Lakkon followed, walking side by side with a man, stalwart,
  grizzled, strongfaced, clad in a cuirass of silver, rarest of
  all Tamarizian metals, wearing the circle and cross of Zitra,
  the capital city of the nation, done in more of the
  diamondlike stones upon his armor.</p>

  <p>Jadgor, I thought; Jadgor, president of the Tamarizian
  republic, recognizing him from Croft's former descriptions and
  the quality of his dress.</p>

  <p>Behind them, azure-clad&mdash;the cross ansata on his
  breast, a flame of vivid scarlet gems&mdash;stalked a man,
  white-haired and most benign of appearance in company with a
  second, more stalwart, also in azure robes. They carried
  staves tipped with the looped cross and were followed by a boy
  supporting a tray of silver, on which were two silver flasks
  and a tiny, blazing lamp.</p>

  <p>A man with a cuirass, on which showed a rayed sun, and
  wearing plumes of scarlet, and a woman, scarlet-robed, with
  the same ruddy feathers above her soft brown hair brought up
  the rear.0</p>

  <p>Zud and Magur, and a temple boy, Robur and Gaya, his
  wife&mdash;high priest of Zitra and his deputy of Himyra,
  governor of Aphur and his consort, I named them to myself.</p>

  <p>While the company kept silent and the harps filled all the
  air with a sort of triumphant paean, the little procession
  advanced. It reached the foot of the stairs and crossed to the
  dais, mounted its steps. It formed itself in a shimmering
  semicircle, Croft and Naia&mdash;and Maia kneeling before them
  in the center&mdash;the others on either side, and before them
  the boy of the temple and the two priests.</p>

  <p>Him I named Zud, because of his bearing and his mane of
  snowy hair, raised his stave. The music died. Silence came
  down for a moment, and then the voice of Magur rose:</p>

  <p>"Hail Zitu, giver of life, and Ga, through whom life is
  given, and Azil, bringer of life, we are met together that a
  name may be given unto this new soul, thou hast seen fit to
  assign to the flesh.</p>

  <p>"Greetings to you, Naia, daughter of Ga, and to you, Jason,
  Hupor, named Mouthpiece of Zitu among men through whose union
  Zitu and Ga have expressed their will that life shall remain
  eternal, renewing its fire from generation unto generation, in
  the name of love. Is it your will that a name be given this,
  thy child?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, priest of Zitu." Naia and Jason inclined their
  heads.</p>

  <p>"And how call you it between yourselves?"</p>

  <p>"Jason, son of Jason," came Croft's voice.</p>

  <p>"Then present him unto Zud, high priest of Zitu, that he
  may receive Zitu's blessing at his hands," Magur said.</p>

  <p>The girl of Mazzeria raised the cushion of her arms with
  the child upon it. The temple boy advanced his silver tray,
  and knelt. Zud uncorked the silver flasks.</p>

  <p>"Jason, son of Jason, in the name of Zitu, the father, and
  Ga, the mother, and Azil, the son, I baptize thee with wine
  and with water and light," he began. Moistening his fingers
  from one of the two flasks, he went on, "With wine I baptize
  thee, which like the blood, invigorates the body, and
  strengthens the heart and makes quick the brain." Bending, he
  touched the child on the forehead, poured water from the other
  flask into his palm and continued, "I baptize you with water
  which nourisheth all life, purifies all with which it comes in
  contact, makes all things clean."</p>

  <p>He paused and sprinkled the glowing little body before him,
  took up the light and a tiny bit of silver I had not noted
  before and threw into the little face a golden reflected beam.
  "With light I baptize thee Jason, Son of Jason, since by the
  will of Zitu it is the light of the spirit which fills the
  chambers of the brain. May that light be with thee ever and
  forever, nor be absent from thee again."</p><a id="pic2"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Of course I didn't understand it. It was only afterward
  when Croft had translated it to me that its inward meaning was
  plain, but the solemnity of the ritual, the rhythm of
  well-balanced words, the quiet attention of the assembled
  guests and the reverent voice of the priest affected me, who
  stood unseen with the company on the dais, as he baptized
  Jason's son.</p>

  <p>And then he took the cushion from the kneeling girl of
  Mazzeria, lifted it, turning to face the brilliant
  assemblage.</p>

  <p>"Jason, Son of Jason," he cried, holding the infant toward
  them.</p>

  <p>"Hail, Jason, Son of Jason," the guests responded like a
  well-drilled chorus, and the thing was done.</p>

  <p>Followed a feast, similar I fancied in every detail to
  those Croft had told me he had witnessed at first and been
  privileged to attend. Men and women reclined at the tables on
  padded divans. Blue servitors moved about, filling the golden
  and crystal goblets with wine, loading the golden plates with
  food. Once more the harps broke forth. And suddenly from under
  the farther yellow stairway there broke a band of maidens,
  clad in garlands of woven flowers, and danced to the music of
  the harps, with a waving of slender arms, a bending of supple,
  unrestrained bodies, a flashing of whitely rounded limbs. With
  dances and music the feast ran to an end.</p>

  <p>The guests departed, last of them, according to Tamarizian
  custom, Jadgor, president of the Republic, the guest of honor,
  and with him Gaya and her husband Robur, governor of Aphur and
  Jadgor's son. Naia took the child into her arms from the hands
  of its Mazzerian attendant. She and Jason moved toward the
  stairs. I knew that the hour I had waited had come.</p>

  <p>I followed up the stairway and along the balcony and to a
  room&mdash;hung here in golden tissues, furnished with
  wine-red woods and twin couches of molded copper&mdash;with
  the mirror pool in its center and once more the figure of Azil
  close beside it as in Jason's home.</p>

  <p>Naia placed the child on a tiny couch and covered its
  sleeping form with a bit of silken fabric. She turned to
  Jason, her blue eyes shining. He drew her into his arms and
  held her, smiling.</p>

  <p>"There is yet one guest, beloved?" he said in English.</p>

  <p>"Aye," she responded softly; "but&mdash;one who understands
  the heart both of the wife, and the mother of Jason's
  son."</p>

  <p>"And awaits a welcome from her," said Jason. "Come,
  beloved." He led her to one of the copper couches and sat down
  with an arm about her white-sheathed form.</p>

  <p>From it there crept a lovely thing&mdash;an exact replica
  of it&mdash;the very essence of it, as indeed it was and
  seemed, as the lights in the chamber flooded down upon it. And
  that shape stretched out its slender hands. It swayed toward
  me, with Croft's astral presence close behind it.</p>

  <p>"At last," said Naia of Aphur, "I may welcome you, Dr.
  Murray, as mine and Jason's friend."</p>

  <p>"At last, I may converse with Naia of Aphur, and thrill
  with the glory of her&mdash;a thing I have long desired," I
  replied, and took her shadowy hand and raised it to my none
  less shadowy lips, yet with a distinct sensation of the
  contact none the less.</p>

  <p>She smiled, and glanced at Jason. "Beloved, are all the men
  of earth so courtly? It was even so if you remember that you
  met me first in the flesh."</p>

  <p>Croft chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Life is much the same on earth or Palos," he made answer.
  "Well, Murray, what do you think of Palosian life?"</p>

  <p>"Babylonian," I said. "You were right in the simile beyond
  question. I was thinking tonight when I watched it that it was
  almost a pity in one way you should be changing it all with
  your innovations."</p>

  <p>He nodded. "In a way I've thought as much myself. I get
  your meaning. But I'm going to try and preserve it at least in
  part."</p>

  <p>"Babylonian?" said Naia in a tone of question.</p>

  <p>Jason and I explained, and she heard us out.</p>

  <p>"Oh, but&mdash;things must change, must they not, Dr.
  Murray?&mdash;and the common people will be so much happier
  for the knowledge Jason brings to Palos. And even
  I&mdash;think where I and my child would be now save for the
  knowledge possessed by a man of earth. It is to you and Jason
  that we owe our lives. Think you not that I carry your name to
  Ga and Azil in my prayers&mdash;that I have wished to meet you
  in order to express my thanks myself?"</p>

  <p>Her words gave me a feeling of something like exaltation,
  even while in a way they embarrassed. "I, too," I faltered,
  "am very glad of the meeting, to be able to assure you that it
  was my happiness to serve you, and to wish you and Jason the
  happiness of each other, and your son a long and useful
  life."</p>

  <p>She glanced toward the tiny couch and back again, smiling.
  "Life," she said softly. "It is so wonderful to hold
  him&mdash;to realize that his life is but the blending of
  Jason's and mine. Sometimes I even think that I understand in
  a measure what Ga must feel as she guards the eternal
  fire."</p>

  <p>And what is one going to say to a wife and mother when she
  talks like that? I know I mumbled something to the effect that
  what Ga probably felt was an all compelling compassion and
  love. And then I asked Croft to translate the words of the
  baptismal ceremony as voiced by Magur and Zud the high
  priest.</p>

  <p>He complied and I questioned him of Jadgor and Gaya and
  Robur, confirming my recognition of Naia's relatives and his
  friends. Conversation became general for something like an
  hour, and then Jason prompted. "Beloved, shall we accompany
  Murray somewhat&mdash;show him Himyra in passing when he
  returns?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, as you like," she assented. "And he must come to us
  again. Now that our need has rendered possible such communion
  it will not be necessary for you to seek earth in the flesh
  when you need additional knowledge, or leave me overly long
  again."</p>

  <p>Croft nodded. "Yes, Murray is going to have his hand in
  Tamarizian affairs from now on, and the boy there will know
  more than any man ever born on Palos in the. end. Well,
  Murray, want to see Himyra?"</p>

  <p>"I've always wanted to see it since you told me about it
  first," I assented.</p>

  <p>"Then come along."</p>

  <p>"But," I added as he led the way with Naia through one of
  the open windows of the chamber. "I never expected to see it
  exactly like this."</p>

  <p>Naia turned her eyes and smiled as we floated free of the
  house and upward under Croft's guiding will. "Dear friend,"
  she said, "you know so much of us that to me it does not seem
  strange to find you one of us at last."</p>

  <p>"Behold Himyra," said Croft, and flung out a shadowy
  arm.</p>

  <p>The city lay beneath us. I saw the double row of lights
  that fringed the flood of the Na, the mighty pyramid of Zitu,
  up-reared against the skyline, black now instead of red, save
  where the lights threw ruddy splashes upon it, banded with
  white at the apex with the pure white temple of Zitu upon its
  truncated top&mdash;the long line of the houses of the nobles
  of the old regime, fronting a wide street at the top of the
  river embankment in an amazing vista, set down each in its
  private grounds among night-darkened shrubs and trees, the
  wide-flung palace of the governor of Aphur, once the palace of
  Jadgor, Aphur's king. The thing swam a shimmering vision
  before me under the light of the Palosian moons. I strained my
  eyes and saw the mighty sweep of Himyra's shadowy walls.</p>

  <p>It moved me oddly. Already I knew so much of the city's
  history as involved in Croft's romance. I turned my eyes.</p>

  <p>"Himyra," I said, "I shall not forget it&mdash;nor Naia of
  Aphur, nor Jason, mouthpiece of Zitu, nor Jason, Jason's son.
  Zitu guard you, my friends. I must be going."</p>

  <p>"Zitu guard thee," Naia answered.</p>

  <p>And suddenly I was back in my own room remembering her
  parting smile.</p>

  <p>These things have I narrated in order to show how there was
  built up between Croft and Naia of Aphur, his mate, and
  myself, a subtly intimate relation that must, as I hope, make
  what followed plain.</p>

  <p>Life went on pretty much with me after that for some
  further eight months, however, before the events I intend to
  relate occurred. Now and then during the interval Jason Croft
  came to me in the astral presence, and on several occasions I
  succeeded by my own endeavors in visiting him and Naia in
  their home.</p>

  <p>Between them they taught me somewhat of the Tamarizian
  tongue, Croft explaining that as all life was the same in
  reality, and the thought back of the word similar in intent
  even though the word itself might vary in sound, all languages
  were really one in thought and purpose. With that as a key, I
  soon discovered that the spoken words of those about me were
  not difficult for one in the astral condition to
  understand&mdash;that the vibrations of their thought affected
  the astral shell in a manner that made their meaning
  plain.</p>

  <p>I suggested to Croft that it was because of that very thing
  he had so readily apprehended the speech of Tamarizia when he
  first projected himself to Palos and came down outside
  Himyra's walls, rather than because of the similarity of their
  speech to the Sanscrit, now nearly a forgotten tongue on
  earth, and he nodded and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Exactly, Murray," he agreed, "but then I didn't realize it
  altogether, and&mdash;" He broke off and glanced at his
  wife.</p>

  <p>"And you had something else to think about," I said,
  grinning as I recalled how he had seen Naia that first morning
  and followed her to Lakkon's house, drinking in her
  beauty.</p>

  <p>"It's true I wasn't very logical in my considerations the
  first time I heard the language," he replied, and Naia of
  Aphur dropped her eyes. The inner fires of her spirit seemed
  to quicken. I think she would have blushed had she been in the
  flesh instead of sitting there with us like an inexpressibly
  lovely wraith.</p>

  <p>So at least in those months I acquired a fair understanding
  of their speech, and I came more and more to regard their home
  in the western mountains of Aphur, across the desert from
  Himyra, on Palos, with the same intimacy of feeling I might
  have experienced for the home of two friends of earth. My
  conversations with Jason came more and more to resemble
  consultations on modern affairs. He asked me constantly
  concerning this and that fresh progress in mundane matters. He
  discussed with me his plans for improving material and social
  conditions on Palos.</p>

  <p>He had already established a series of public schools for
  the masses where, before his arrival, education of a sort had
  been provided only for the nobles and men of wealth. Plainly
  the man was planning to do more where he had already done so
  much. He had given them moturs&mdash;as they called
  them&mdash;airplanes, electricity, printing, telephones of
  short radius at least, weapons by which Zollaria's schemes had
  been overthrown. And now he planned to lead them toward higher
  standards of national and commercial and individual life. And
  but for what occurred there is no telling what, working
  together as we were at the time, we might have
  accomplished.</p>

  <p>Indeed Croft had established both wireless and telegraphic
  communication between Zitra and Himyra, and was planning
  railways on which he intended to run motur-driven
  trains&mdash;was dreaming of a great beltline about the
  Central Sea, with lateral branches to reach every part of the
  nation.</p>

  <p>And then&mdash;one night he called me to him as he had
  called me the night of Jason's birth&mdash;and I found him in
  the selfsame chamber, with the purple draperies half torn down
  and trampled&mdash;the fair form of Azil drowned in the mirror
  pool, beside which the dead body of Mitlos the Mazzerian
  majordomo lay sprawled.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">III. &mdash; NAIA OF APHUR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">VIOLENCE, conflict. The marks of the thing
  were on every side. The ghastly gash in the breast of Mitlos
  bore dumb testimony to the fact that the man had battled
  grimly till he died.</p>

  <p>I gazed into Jason's face, even in its astral semblance
  haggard.</p>

  <p>"Croft," I stammered, "what in Zitu's name has
  happened?"</p>

  <p>He jerked out an arm in an all-embracing gesture.</p>

  <p>"Gone, Murray," he told me with a vibration of agony in his
  answer; "both of them&mdash;both Naia and
  the&mdash;child."</p>

  <p>"Gone?" For a moment my senses seemed whirring.
  "Croft&mdash;what do you mean? Gone&mdash;where?"</p>

  <p>"Into the western mountains, toward the outer
  ocean&mdash;she told me, Murray. She came and told me as soon
  as she felt it safe to do so. She came to me tonight in the
  Zitran pyramid&mdash;astrally, of course. You know I told you
  I was going to Zitra to see Jadgor in a matter concerning the
  government railroad control&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"She found me there tonight. She had been afraid to leave
  the body before, lest something happen to little Jason. It was
  last night this thing occurred&mdash;and my body's still in
  Zitra." I sensed the tenseness of his emotion. "I'm so utterly
  impotent to help her, Murray. Would Zitu I were here to follow
  and wrest her from them."</p>

  <p>"From whom?" I questioned. Plainly he knew more of the
  matter than I did&mdash;as much at least as Naia had told him.
  "See here, Croft&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He appeared to grip himself as he answered. "Forgive me,
  Murray. The Zollarians, of course. It was an armed band of
  those Sons of Zitemku that attacked here in my absence.
  There"&mdash;he pointed at the body of Mitlos&mdash;"lies an
  example of their work."</p>

  <p>His words whipped my attention&mdash;brought up a vivid
  picture of all the abduction of Naia and her child by men from
  the northern hostile nation might embrace.</p>

  <p>"Zollarians?" I said. "She told you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." He nodded. "They&mdash;they must have been planning
  it, Murray&mdash;they must have been using spies."</p>

  <p>"Unless," I rejoined, "it was merely a wandering band of
  marauders." I had a general knowledge of the western coast of
  Aphur and the intervening country. Practically uninhabited,
  wild and rugged, it would be easy, I thought, for men of such
  ilk to have landed on its shores.</p>

  <p>"Wandering band?" Croft said with something like
  impatience. "Murray, talk sense. They knew enough to seize
  Naia of Aphur&mdash;the fairest woman of her nation, of its
  best blood&mdash;the wife of the Mouthpiece of Zitu, who has
  twice defeated their schemes and their armies&mdash;and her
  child."</p>

  <p>I nodded. He had not lost his ability to judge the
  situation even then, and judge it clearly. I ceased offering
  either suggestions or comment and asked a question:</p>

  <p>"Then what do you intend?"</p>

  <p>"I intend to follow her&mdash;learn what is behind this
  damnable action first."</p>

  <p>"Astrally?" I recalled that more than once ere this he had
  adopted such means to gain information toward Zollaria's
  undoing, and I began to comprehend.</p>

  <p>He gave me a glance. "Of course. It's the only way I can
  follow with the cursed hulk of me in Zud's pile of rock in
  Zitra. And I want you to go with me tonight. Man, I'm trying
  to keep as cool as I may, but&mdash;I'm in need of sympathetic
  support. Before Naia left me she said they stopped for an
  hour's rest, but that before daylight faded they had seen the
  outer ocean from a hill, and a ship. I think that ship is
  waiting for her, Murray&mdash;and that once we are on it, to
  see and not be seen; hear and not be heard, we shall learn
  something of the truth."</p>

  <p>"Then let's get on it," I suggested. "This is a terrible
  ordeal for her; When she came to you tonight, was she
  frightened?"</p>

  <p>"Frightened?" Suddenly Croft drew himself up before me.
  "Naia&mdash;Naia of Aphur frightened&mdash;" And then abruptly
  the force of his thought wave, beating upon me softened. "Or
  if she felt fear, Murray, it was for the child, and not for
  herself."</p>

  <p>He turned toward the tiny couch where the infant had been
  wont to sleep between the twin couches of its parents, and
  stood brooding down upon it. "Now Zitemku take the scum of
  life who have made my house empty," he burst forth, and seized
  my hand. "Come."</p>

  <p>In a flash we were outside. And as on that night after the
  christening of Jason, Son of Jason, when Croft and Naia showed
  me Himyra, we floated upward. Only now there were no lights to
  fasten the attention, no mighty piles of architecture, no wide
  embracing walls. There were just the tumbled masses of the
  mountains, their sides cut and gashed by night-filled ravines
  and tortuous canons, and the silvery radiance of the Palosian
  moons, and the stars. I recalled that once in the past Croft
  had called Naia of Aphur, still then a maiden, forth from her
  body and floated thus over Aphur's hills from the house we now
  were leaving.</p>

  <p>And then his voice was in my ear.</p>

  <p>"Look, Murray&mdash;they've reached the shore-line,
  and&mdash;they're building a flare."</p>

  <p>I turned my gaze into the west, where, low down on what
  might or might not be the horizon, but was certainly not the
  heavens, there winked a point of light, too ruddy, too
  unsteady, to be a star.</p>

  <p>We swept toward it. For the first time I saw the Zollarian
  manhood in the light of the leaping fire they had built upon a
  beach. Tawny-haired they were, for the most part, stalwart,
  with muscular arms and heavy limbs, as they stood straining
  their vision across the water toward the moonlighted shape of
  a ship&mdash;or perhaps galley were a better term, since it
  seemed to be equipped with banks of oars as well as sails.</p>

  <p>So much I saw&mdash;the ship, the bodies of the men, the
  glint of the firelight on spearheads, and the short metal
  scabbards of swords, not unlike the ancient Roman weapons, to
  judge by their dimensions, and then Croft led me to where Naia
  and the blue girl of Mazzeria were seated, little way
  apart.</p>

  <p>Maia was speaking softly as we reached them. "My mistress,
  you are quite assured then that the Hupor Jason
  understands?".</p>

  <p>"Aye." Naia bent her cheek to rest it against the head of
  the infant. "Be of good courage, Maia, and fear not."</p>

  <p>"I fear not for myself, but for you and that one against
  your breast," the blue girl answered. "Had it been my part to
  do so, I had done as Mitlos and died in your defense."</p>

  <p>"I know." Naia stretched out a hand and touched the girl
  upon the shoulder. "May Zilla bear Mitlos as tenderly as my
  thoughts shall hold him&mdash;and did I not name you my sister
  Maia, after you rendered me aid in preserving my
  lord&mdash;and did you not insist on coming with me, though
  these men did not desire to take you, saying you were the
  child's attendant?"</p>

  <p>"I came gladly," the blue girl said quickly. "yet do I not
  understand these sleeps in which you lie as dead, and I
  remember once when Mitlos and I worked above you thinking
  Zilla had taken your spirit, before you were the Hupor Jason's
  bride&mdash;and it was even so with the Hupor himself in the
  camp of the Mazzerian army, when we went to save
  him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Peace, girl," Naia interrupted; and paused and caught her
  breath sharply, as Jason bent the force of his presence on
  her.</p>

  <p>She smiled, handed the child to Maia, and reclined her body
  on the warm sand of the beach. Then she let the fair astral
  tenant of her body steal forth!</p>

  <p>"Beloved," said Jason Croft, and drew her close.
  "Beloved&mdash;woman of gold&mdash;we have heard your words, I
  and our friend of earth."</p>

  <p>Naia turned her head toward me from the shelter of his
  arms.</p>

  <p>"Once more," she addressed me, "you come to our aid, good
  friend. Did Jason, my lord, call you to him?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, Princess of Aphur." I inclined my head, finding the
  Tamarizan idiom in that moment best fitted to my tongue.</p>

  <p>She spoke again to Jason. "You have followed me, beloved;
  what else lies in your mind?"</p>

  <p>"Naught for the present," Croft told her. "It is plain that
  they intend taking you upon yonder ship, and we shall follow
  you aboard it. It is our purpose to learn, in so far as we
  may, what these spawn of Zitemku and Lith, his filthy consort,
  have in mind. Yet fear not&mdash;though I do no more than this
  in the spirit, I shall do much more in the flesh, once the
  spirit is informed."</p>

  <p>"I shall not fear;" said Naia of Aphur. "Have I not given
  myself wholly into your keeping? My part it shall be to meet
  what Zitu sends upon us boldly and without fear, and safeguard
  that smaller Jason, who even now is a mirror of his
  father."</p>

  <p>"And thyself, beloved," Croft added quickly. "Look to
  thyself. It were hard choice for a father between child and
  mother, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nay! Say no further," she stayed his almost passionate
  answer swiftly. Yet something like an inward fire seemed to
  light her mistlike form until it glowed.</p>

  <p>"By Bel&mdash;they are awake out there at last," the sound
  of a rough voice drifted to my ears.</p>

  <p>Croft turned his head at the same instant, toward the group
  of Zollarian raiders and the ship beyond them, between which
  and the beach a boat now appeared.</p>

  <p>"Aye," growled another speaker. "And time enough. Look to
  the women and the slave."</p>

  <p>"The time is at hand, beloved," I heard Jason speaking.
  "Return, soul of my soul, to your beautiful mansion&mdash;and
  think not I shall not be near."</p>

  <p>For a moment he clasped her closer and sank his lips to
  hers uplifted, and then&mdash;she was gone and her body
  stirred, sat up as two of the Zollarians approached and
  ordered her to rise.</p>

  <p>"What did they mean by the slave'?" I questioned
  Jason.</p>

  <p>"Wait," he said as another group of Naia's captors led a
  blue man into the light of the fire. "Bathos&mdash;one of my
  house servants," he went on. "Now, for what purpose in Zitu's
  name have they brought him along?"</p>

  <p>I could offer no suggestion, and I didn't try. The boat had
  reached the beach by the time the woman and the blue man had
  been brought to the edge of the water, and now they were
  thrust in. Part of the Zollarians crowded aboard, and the boat
  shoved off, leaving the rest of the band to await its
  return.</p>

  <p>Croft and I followed, as propelled by the straining muscles
  of well-nigh naked rowers, it moved across the waves. With a
  sense of the bizarreness, the weirdness, of it all, I found
  myself perching upon a gunwale, while Croft actually took his
  place at Naia's side.</p>

  <p>It was an odd sensation to realize myself a part of that
  strange archaic scene, wherein a beautiful woman had been
  abducted, and her captors, bronzed men dressed more in the
  fashion of the soldiery of forgotten empires than anything
  else, drove their boat across a moonlight silvered tide. I
  found myself wondering how they would have acted could they
  have seen us seated there among them. But they did not, and
  the steady sweep of the oars brought us presently close to the
  side of the galley, up which the Zollarians swarmed on
  down-flung ladders to reach the deck.</p>

  <p>Naia and Maia followed, climbing a ladder with surprising
  ease until I recalled what Croft had told me of the wiry
  strength in Naia's supple figure in the past, and I considered
  the bodily freedom allowed by the Tamarizian fashion in dress.
  Last of all to leave the boat, before it returned to the
  beach, came Bathos, whom, being blue, the Zollarians had
  termed a slave, as were all of his race born of captive
  parents, in the nation to the north.</p>

  <p>I glanced about me, recognizing the craft as similar in the
  main details at least to those Jason had found in common use
  on the Tamarizian rivers and the Central Sea, when he had
  reached Palos first. There was a high deck forward, a lower
  deck in the waist, where the oarsmen sat on benches, close to
  a series of ports in the skin of the vessel, through which
  were thrust the butts of the heavy oars. Aft again was a
  second higher deck, covered by an awning beneath which were
  placed padded divans and several quaintly shaped and
  ornamented chairs. Indeed, the vessel was nothing less than
  regal, as I perceived. Green was the awning and the sail on
  the gilded mast running up between the banks of rowers'
  benches.</p>

  <p>Gilded too were the railings of the twin stairs that led up
  to the after-deck on either side, from the lower level of the
  waist. And the sheathing of the decks seemed to be made of
  closely fitted strips of the wine-red wood, customarily used
  for the fashioning of couches and divans and chairs.</p>

  <p>Plainly, then, we had come aboard the craft of someone of
  more than ordinary station, I thought, and gave my attention
  to a man standing on guard beside a door in the facing of the
  space between the level of the after-deck and the waist,
  where, as I judged, whatever private cabins there might be on
  the vessel would be placed.</p>

  <p>Huge he was and florid, muscled like an ox, his mighty
  thorax banded with metal, fitting him so closely that the
  bellies of the shoulder muscles bulged above their upper edge.
  Head, shoulders, and arms were naked, as were his legs save
  for a short cloth skirt below his armor, falling half way down
  his thighs, and the metal casings on his heavy calves.
  Thick-lipped, flat-nosed, bulging of forehead, he was a
  veritable giant, his appearance little short of ferocious as
  he leaned on the, haft of a spear and watched, straightening
  to attention only when the captain in charge of the raiding
  party advanced with his captives toward him. But only for a
  moment. Then as the captain paused, without speaking, he
  shifted his spear, put out a hand, and opened the door.</p>

  <p>It gave into a passage, with curtained doorways on either
  hand and a lighted apartment at the farther end, toward which
  Naia, her maid, and Bathos, with the Zollarians who led them,
  passed.</p>

  <p>They reached it, and then, in so far as sensation went at
  least, I gasped. The room was ablaze with lights that struck
  back on every hand from woodwork carved and tooled in most
  magnificent fashion, hung with woven fabrics of green shot
  through with threads of gold. But if the apartment was amazing
  in its appearance, its occupant was in no way overcast.
  Rather, she seemed the center of all its blended richness of
  furnishing and color. I say she, because it was a woman who
  lay stretched on a couch of what seemed molded silver. And
  such a woman! For a single instant, as I saw her, she seemed
  more gorgeous in her voluptuous physical perfection than
  anything in all that gorgeous place.</p>

  <p>Tawny she was as a lioness, of hair and eyes, as she lay
  there on that splendid couch, draped with the mottled hide of
  some tawny beast; lithe as a tigress she appeared in all her
  supple, wonderfully rounded length, save for a jeweled girdle
  supporting a drapery of almost transparent tissue. And as she
  lifted her fine torso, raising herself to a sitting position
  before the captain, who sank with uplifted hand to a knee
  before her, one sensed there were tiny bells on the jeweled
  bands about her tapering ankles that tinkled as she moved.</p>

  <p>Suspicion, swift as a lance-thrust, came upon me as I saw
  her, even before the captain spoke. "Hail to thee, Kalamita,
  Priestess of Adita, goddess of beauty; thy servant returns
  from that mission on which it was thy pleasure to send him,
  bringing with him those thou named."</p>

  <p>Kalamita! Kalamita, the Zollarian, magnet of the flesh, by
  whose shameless charms and yet more shameless favors
  Kyphallos, Prince of Cathur, had been seduced. Well I thought
  was she named magnet&mdash;and one could fancy how she might
  draw men to her as irresistibly as the moth is drawn by the
  flame, and with equally fatal results. I glanced at Croft.</p>

  <p>His face was a blended thing of conjecture and
  consternation on thus once more beholding Zollaria's lovely
  magnet of the flesh. But he said no word, though his hand
  crept out and touched me as we stood side by side to
  watch.</p>

  <p>Kalamita smiled. "'Tis well, Ptoth," she made answer.
  "Arise. You have proven faithful, and you shall have your
  reward. Found you any obstacle worth naming on your
  mission?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, Sister of Bandhor," said Ptoth rising. "None but the
  house slaves lay there to oppose us&mdash;one we brought with
  us, since so it was ordered&mdash;the rest were slain."</p>

  <p>I glanced at Croft again, and he nodded.</p>

  <p>I understand that, although he had made no mention of it,
  the fact to him was already known. And I felt my own anger
  harden. Mitlos was not the only one of Jason's retainers who
  had paid the penalty of their fidelity to his trust. The
  entire foray had been a deliberate bit of murder.</p>

  <p>"'Tis well," said Kalamita again, turning her tawny eyes
  beyond Ptoth to where Naia and the others stood. "Found you
  any trace of this Mouthpiece of Zitu?"</p>

  <p>"Nay," the captain answered, smiling, "but we left him
  ample trace of us."</p>

  <p>Kalamita's whole expression darkened. Her amber eyes
  flashed. "Aye&mdash;and may Adita forsake my beauty and blast
  it if I give him not another. Let this woman wait, and bring
  me his slave."</p>

  <p>Ptoth turned to Bathos, seized him by an arm, and flung him
  at the feet of the woman on the couch.</p>

  <p>The blue man groveled. He made no attempt to rise.</p>

  <p>Kalamita put out a pink-nailed foot and touched him.</p>

  <p>"Come, get up," she prompted. "How are you called?"</p>

  <p>"Bathos," the servant faltered, lifting himself on limbs
  that shook beneath him, to stand with downcast eyes.</p>

  <p>"Listen, then, Bathos," Kalamita continued. "Canst find the
  way over which my captain led you, and return?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, if I be granted the chance." Bathos glanced toward
  the end of the passage.</p>

  <p>"It will be granted, provided you will bear a message."</p>

  <p>"Aye, I will bear it," Bathos assented promptly.</p>

  <p>"Then give ear. It is for your lord. Return to his dwelling
  and from there to Himyra; seek out one in authority, and bid
  him send word to the Hupor Jason that the woman he has taken
  to wife and her child are in Kalamita's hands. Say further
  that they shall be taken to a place I know of and held until I
  have received word from him, and that I shall await his coming
  in a hunting house, one of my possessions, in the mountains
  north of Cathur's border, half a sun's journey, where, when he
  comes to listen to my requirements, he will be led by men who
  will lie in watch. Repeat now my own words to me, Tamarizian
  canor, and make no mistake in the telling. I desire that this
  Hupor Jason fails not to understand."</p>

  <p>Bathos complied. He mumbled the message quickly, too fired
  by the thoughts of freedom, as it seemed, to resent in the
  least Kalamita's use of the word canor, the Tamarizian
  equivalent of dog. "So shall I say to the one I find to send
  word to the Hupor Jason," he made an end.</p>

  <p>Kalamita nodded and turned to Ptoth. "He has his lesson.
  Take him and see him put ashore. That done, see that we turn
  north at once, and say to Gor that I deny my presence to any,
  as you pass him. Take also the blue girl with you. I would
  deal with the other alone. You may leave her the child."</p>

  <p>Ptoth threw up an arm in flat-handed salute and bowed,
  motioned Bathos to precede him, and caught Maia by an arm.
  Gor, I fancied, must be the name of the giant on guard at the
  outer door. And, too, I fancied that, under the conditions,
  Bathos's message was going to be old news when delivered.</p>

  <p>I glanced at Jason, and found his expression one of intense
  attention. He seemed to feel my gaze, however, and shook his
  head slightly, as though to say this was no time for anything
  more than observation.</p>

  <p>I turned back to the two women, now confronting one
  another.</p>

  <p>Ptoth and his charges had vanished. They were alone,
  Kalamita, the Zollarian adventuress, the lure of men, and
  Naia, Princess of Aphur, with the son of a man in her
  arms.</p>

  <p>For a moment each seemed appraising the other.</p>

  <p>Then Kalamita rose.</p>

  <p>It was like Aphrodite rising, the tissue of the draperies
  dependent from the gem-incrusted girdle clasping her rounded
  body seeming no more than a white foam, a shimmering streaking
  of froth, more than half revealing what it concealed. She went
  a lithe pace forward and paused, still holding the woman
  before her with contemptuous yellow eyes.</p>

  <p>"So," she said, "at last I see Tamarizia's most beautiful
  woman, and find her rather pale of feature, rather wide-eyed,
  possessed of a not unattractive figure, but scarcely so
  favored of Adita as I have been led to believe."</p>

  <p>"Favored rather by Ga, the true woman, Kalamita," Naia
  returned in level accents, glancing down at the child in her
  arms. "You do well to call on Adita, goddess of the unclean
  love."</p>

  <p>For the moment the Zollarian made no answer. Once more her
  yellow eyes flashed. Scarcely, I thought, had she looked for
  the cold taunt from Naia's lips, aimed at her own unsavory
  reputation.</p>

  <p>Then, "By Bel, you dare such speech to me!" she cried.
  "Think you I have it in mind to treat you as my prisoner or a
  guest?"</p>

  <p>"As prisoner, I pray Zitu," said Naia of Aphur. "Other
  treatment from Kalamita were disgrace."</p>

  <p>"By Bel!" Kalamita mouthed again, her face distorted with
  passion, and flung herself back on her couch. "You have a bold
  tongue at least." I thought she seemed disconcerted. She was
  breathing deeply. "How think you your Mouthpiece of Zitu will
  accept your being prisoner to Kalamita?" she asked. '</p>

  <p>For the first time Naia's pale face twitched. But only for
  an instant, before she controlled it and rejoined with proudly
  upflung head, "Jason, my lord, will answer that question to
  Zollaria and Kalamita in person."</p>

  <p>"Bel grant it." All at once Kalamita laughed. "If so I
  shall have something to say to that self-exalted
  spirit&mdash;that panderer to priests, who scorned the open
  offer of my favor for the softer affection of yours."</p>

  <p>Once more I glanced at Croft, and found his face contorted
  at the woman's reference to the time he was captive during the
  Mazzerian war. And, too, I found myself thinking that, no
  matter to what extent Zollaria might be involved in the
  abduction of Naia and Jason, Son of Jason, Kalamita as her
  agent was bent on glutting a personal revenge&mdash;that here
  was the old situation of a woman scorned.</p>

  <p>Then once more Naia of Aphur was speaking. "Jason, my lord,
  like to the wild gnuppa of the mountains, prefers that the
  fountain at which his thirst is slaked be clean&mdash;and like
  it once it is captured, when led to a foul spring, he
  refused."</p>

  <p>"Thou fool." Kalamita sprang up. The action held all the
  lithe menace of a tigress's spring. She began pacing the floor
  with an undulant swing of her body, a tinkling of her anklet
  bells. "Thou fool," she said again. "Think you not I shall
  make you repent these words&mdash;or that, save this
  Mouthpiece give heed to my demands and those of my nation, he
  shall return to your arms, or see your offspring again?"</p>

  <p>"Nay," Naia said, as Kalamita came to a panting pause
  before her, "these things lie with the gods, Zollarian magnet.
  Once ere this, when you fancied you had tricked me to my
  undoing, the plans of Zollaria went amiss, and the menace was
  removed by death. Bzad, the Mazzerian to whom I was to be
  betrayed, paid for his attempted aid to you with his life, and
  his body was spewed forth from the Central Sea, refused even
  by Tamarizian waters, to lie rotting on the shores of Anthra,
  where it was your custom to dally with Cathur's prince."</p>

  <p>"Whom you consented to wed," Kalamita sneered with a
  curling lip.</p>

  <p>"To whom it was planned to give me as a sacrifice," said
  Naia, "if so by it were possible to stay his hands from
  treason and offset the work of your unholy charms. Tell me,
  Zollarian, stand I prisoner to all your nation, or to Kalamita
  alone?"</p>

  <p>I felt a quiver shake me. For all the scathing tongue-play
  in which she had been indulging, Naia of Aphur had herself in
  hand. She knew Croft and I were present, that we could see and
  hear and understand. And she asked a question, fully aware
  that our presence was something Kalamita could not know.</p>

  <p>Nor did she. Something like gloating leaped into her tawny
  eyes as she turned again to her couch and sat down.</p>

  <p>"So," she said, smiling coldly, "we begin to stand on
  common ground. You stand prisoner to all Zollaria, wife of
  Jason, you and Jason, Son of Jason. There be two forms of
  warfare, Aphur, that of wits as well as that of arms.
  Wherefore, in your capture and that of your child, I serve
  both the interests of my country and my own. It was so
  Bandhor, my brother, and I planned."</p>

  <p>Naia nodded. Her tone, became one of musing. "Bandhor and
  Kalamita, his sister, on whose beauty he mounted to his
  position as general of all Zollaria's armies, rather than by
  any ability of his own, and the court of Zollaria at Berla,
  have planned before."</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Kalamita quickly, "we planned, and had won,
  save for the undreamed weapons this Mouthpiece of yours
  brought against us&mdash;weapons against which no army might
  stand. Yet before he reclaims Naia of Aphur and her
  suckling&mdash;the secrets of those weapons shall be known.
  The Zollarian and the Tamarizian armies shall stand on equal
  footing again. Your Mouthpiece and your nation shall go down
  through Naia of Aphur&mdash;and what then of Jason's son?"</p>

  <p>Once more I caught my breath. Once more Naia of Aphur went
  pale as the full scope of Zollaria's scheming was revealed
  with its undoubted future crop of bloody war, wherein Zollaria
  would indeed take the field on equal footing with the
  Tamarizian forces, should Naia's welfare compel the Mouthpiece
  of Zitu to yield to the demands for ransom the Zollarian woman
  so confidently proposed. I saw the astral form beside me
  clench its shadowy hands, sensed something of Jason's emotion,
  and then Naia of Aphur made answer.</p>

  <p>"Yet not so, surely on equal terms, Zollaria, since he who
  made the weapons of which you desire the secret may have
  others still in mind. 'Tis a poor plan to purchase or barter
  with unlaid eggs."</p>

  <p>Croft's presence beside me breathed an exclamation softly.
  "By Zitu&mdash;woman of gold."</p>

  <p>But Kalamita stretched her rosy arms and limbs with a
  tinkle of little bells, and remained upon the couch. A glint
  of something like amusement waked in her narrowed eyes.</p>

  <p>"Your position is worth considering, Aphur," she said
  slowly. "It may even be put in the agreement that he shall
  refrain from attempting what you suggest&mdash;or that, should
  he attempt it, the act be an excuse for war."</p>

  <p>"In which, were the excuse used against her, Zollaria would
  perchance again be foiled?"</p>

  <p>"And Naia of Aphur, and Jason, Son of Jason, be emptied of
  the spirit."</p>

  <p>"Nay&mdash;that is with Zitu," Naia made answer. "Ere this
  my lord has saved me from the embrace of Zilla. I trust him
  wholly." And all at once she smiled.</p>

  <p>Kalamita frowned.</p>

  <p>"By Bel, at least you have spirit," she said in almost
  wondering fashion.</p>

  <p>"Which will not break before you, Priestess of Adita." Naia
  began a slow rocking of the infant Jason in her arms.</p>

  <p>The act seemed to drive Kalamita to fury. Once more she
  lifted herself to a half-sitting posture. She threw out a
  jewel-banded arm and pointed. Her voice came shrilly&mdash;the
  voice of the termagant robbed of all pretense of control, or
  poise. "Go&mdash;hide yourself in one of the rooms
  yonder&mdash;get out of my sight."</p>

  <p>Then, as Naia moved toward the mouth of the passage and the
  curtained doors of its rooms, she relaxed. A quiver shook her.
  "Now, Bel and Adita befriended me, and give me my will of this
  woman. Adita judge between us and blast her beauty. Her son to
  thee, Bel, if Tamarizia refuses our demands, as a sacrifice. I
  swear it," she cried.</p>

  <p>"Come." I sensed Croft's emotion-clogged direction.</p>

  <p>We made our way outside. The ship was in motion, the
  benches filled with straining rowers, between whom stalked men
  in armor bearing knotted lashes&mdash;the green sail spread to
  what there was of breeze. Kalamita's galley was straining
  north, bearing Naia of Aphur and Jason, Son of Jason, helpless
  captives aboard her.</p>

  <p>"Where now?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Zitra." Croft seized my arm in his grasp. Then the
  creeping galley, the moonlighted flood of the outer ocean,
  were behind us, the tumbled region of Aphur's hills were
  beneath us. They too fell away and gave place to the shimmer
  of the Central Sea. An island appeared in its center&mdash;the
  walls of a mighty city. White they were as milk in the
  moonlight&mdash;white as the foam of the sea. And the city was
  white when we reached it, all white and purple shadows, with
  the mighty pyramid of Zitu lifting the pure white temple on
  its lofty top above the walls.</p>

  <p>"Zitra," said Croft again. "I've got to get back in the
  flesh."</p>

  <p>And even as he spoke, I sensed that we were in a room
  somewhere within the pyramid itself. Bare was its floor of
  tessellated paving, bare were its walls save for here and
  there a light in a metal sconce. Bare, too, it seemed of
  furnishings, save for a chest of metal, a stool and a couch,
  on which the body of Jason found a place. The astral Jason
  seated himself beside it, and fastened me with his eyes. "You
  heard, Murray. You see what they intend." And then his
  expression altered. "Saw you ever a more glorious woman than
  Naia, wife of Jason? Well, I've got to get to work. I've got
  to save her."</p>

  <p>"Just how?" I questioned, baffled, I confess myself, as to
  how the thing might be accomplished.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he admitted rather slowly. "Beyond the
  first step, that is. I'll explain things to Jadgor and Lakkon,
  of course, and I'll have a wireless sent to Robur at Himyra.
  After that&mdash;well&mdash;you heard the instructions given
  Bathos. There's no denying Kalamita has won the first trick by
  her unexpected attack&mdash;or that she'll enter largely into
  the rest of the affair until it's finished, but&mdash;since
  she's sending me word to meet her, I think I'll fall in so far
  with her proposal and meet her face to face."</p>

  <p>"You mean, you'll go up there north to Cathur in the
  mountains?" I asked, surprised he should consider the action
  for a second, and with a feeling that his sense of
  bereavement, the anxiety of the husband and father to
  extricate his loved ones from the hands of their captors
  quickly, were certainly swaying his mind.</p>

  <p>He nodded without other answer, his expression one of a
  frowning consideration.</p>

  <p>"And thereby lose the second, trick and the game
  altogether," I rejoined. For it had come to me that Kalamita's
  suggested meeting was in the nature of nothing more nor less
  than a trap.</p>

  <p>"Eh?" Croft threw up his head. His glance burned into
  mine.</p>

  <p>"Do you really think if you went up there to meet that
  tawny she devil, the Mouthpiece of Zitu&mdash;Tamarizia's big
  man&mdash;would be given chance to return?"</p>

  <p>For a moment after I finished Croft said nothing, and then,
  "By Zitu&mdash;Murray, you're right! I must have been blind!
  I'll&mdash;I'll have to send another than myself. We've got to
  keep a few cards in our hand. But&mdash;consider my
  position."</p>

  <p>"I do," I said. "I understand it perfectly, old man. I
  don't expect a man to keep cool in a game where the stakes are
  his wife and son."</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "It isn't that only, Murray. I dare not
  sacrifice Tamarizia, either&mdash;and I won't fail Naia.
  Think, man&mdash;think&mdash;there must be a way to serve both
  ends."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps what Naia herself suggested," I made tentative
  answer.</p>

  <p>Pride flashed momentarily in his eyes and died. "The
  invention of another&mdash;a superior weapon," he said.
  "Zitu&mdash;the thought fired me when she named it. Hah! She
  knew we were present&mdash;and she led the conversation to
  inform us in advance of what was proposed. It was like her,
  Murray, but&mdash;man, how can I risk it? You heard that fiend
  of Adita's oath after Naia left her&mdash;to Bel with Jason's
  son."</p>

  <p>"I know," I said slowly.</p>

  <p>"But do you know its meaning?" Croft's question was
  strained.</p>

  <p>"No," I admitted.</p>

  <p>"Murray"&mdash;he leaned toward me; there was agony in his
  thought vibration&mdash;"they practice the hellish rites of
  ancient Phoenicia in the northern nation. The child would be
  burned."</p>

  <p>Burned&mdash;Jason, Son of Jason&mdash;a living sacrifice!
  The rites of the Phoenicians! The thought staggered me,
  revolted, as it lifted to mind the picture of Moloch&mdash;the
  brazen god into whose insensate arms children and babes and
  maidens were cast&mdash;and I recalled that, as well as
  Moloch, that savage divinity had been known as Bel, and
  marveled at the similarity of names. A tremor of horror shook
  me. And yet by a strange association of thought, as it seemed
  to me then, another thought was born.
  Bel&mdash;Moloch&mdash;flame. On impulse I named the thing to
  Croft, and waited, until:</p>

  <p>"Zitu&mdash;God," he said, and then, "Man&mdash;it may be
  the answer, if there is nothing else. Now, I've got to let Zud
  and Jadgor and Lakkon know what has happened. And I've got to
  get a message off to Robur. He's Naia's cousin, as I've told
  you, and I love him like a brother. Will you go with me on my
  missions, or will you return to your body, as I must to
  mine?"</p>

  <p>"If you don't mind," I decided, "I'd like to know all that
  happens, and I'll linger around until dawn."</p>

  <p>He nodded. "I'll be glad to feel you with me, and as soon
  as I reach Himyra I'll manage to visit you again. Look into
  the thing you suggested, won't you?"</p>

  <p>"Go on. Get about your business," I told him. "I'll have
  the information for you the next time we meet, if I can find a
  certain man."</p>

  <p>The body beside which he had been sitting raised itself on
  the couch and swung its feet around. It rose. "You've got to
  find him, man," Jason's physical voice told me without making
  the least break in the conversation, as he began to dress.
  "You know, Murray, I can perceive you dimly even so, and I can
  get your thought waves, of course&mdash;just as Naia was able
  to do the same thing the night of Jason's birth&mdash;so if
  you have any more suggestions to offer in what occurs inside
  the next few hours, make them of course. I'm not exactly
  myself. My spirit is still hot within me, where presently I
  think now it is going to grow deadly cold."</p>

  <p>He jerked the fastenings of his leg casings into position
  and clasped the belt of a short sword about him. "Now, I'm
  going before Zud first."</p>

  <p>He turned to a door that slid back before his touch into a
  recess in the massive wall. I followed him into a corridor,
  constructed top and floor and sides of huge blocks and slabs
  of stone, lighted at intervals by a lamp whose rays served to
  no more than partly dispel the night-shrouding gloom.
  Age&mdash;age&mdash;the age of the pyramids of Egypt. The
  thing impressed me. Countless generations had passed since
  mortal hands had set those walls in position, where Jason's
  sandals now clanked along the passage. And then he paused
  before another door, lifted his sword, and rapped with its
  hilt for admittance. From somewhere a night breeze sighed
  along the hall and stirred the plumes of azure on his
  helmet.</p>

  <p>"Who calls on Zud?" a voice came muffled through the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Jason, Mouthpiece of Zitu, man of Zitu," Croft
  replied.</p>

  <p>The door slid back. Zud stood before us, blinking aged
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Mouthpiece of Zitu," he questioned, "what does this visit
  betide?"</p>

  <p>"Work of Zitemku and his agents," Croft said hoarsely,
  stepping inside the high priest's apartments and pausing while
  Zud closed the door.</p>

  <p>"Thou knowest of my sleeps, O man of Zitu&mdash;and what
  occurs at times when my body lies sleeping, and how my spirit
  gains knowledge beyond the power of most men in the
  gaining&mdash;for I have explained to thee, and shown thee
  somewhat, O Zud, so that by thyself something of the same
  power was attained," he went on.</p>

  <p>"Hence will ye give credence when I declare to you, in the
  name of Zitu, that this night the woman whose union with me
  was blessed by thyself appeared to me, saying my home in the
  mountains of Aphur had been assailed by a Zollarian band, and
  that she had been carried from it with our child&mdash;and ye
  will credit me still further in that I left the body and went
  to my house, and found things even as she had described them,
  and that I followed her to the shore of the outer ocean, and
  aboard a ship, whereupon was Kalamita, the Zollarian woman of
  whom thou knowest&mdash;and that even now she is carried to
  Zollaria captive, to be returned to Tamarizia and my house
  only for a price."</p>

  <p>He paused and caught a heavy breath, the fingers of his
  left hand toying with the jeweled hilt of his sword.</p>

  <p>"Zitu," stammered the high priest, advancing a step to lay
  a withered hand on Jason's shoulder&mdash;"may he befriend
  thee, and guard the woman I know thou lovest. In what way may
  I aid thee, Jason?"</p>

  <p>"In no way, save that I desired your acquaintance with the
  knowledge. I go now to Jadgor, and Lakkon, her father," Croft
  replied. "Grant us thy prayers, Zud, and those of the Gayana,
  since once she lay among them waiting to be my bride." He
  turned to the door, crashing it back with a wholly unneeded
  force, and strode off, clanking down the passage, leaving old
  Zud staring after, out of troubled, aged eyes.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">IV. &mdash; JASON TAKES THE TRAIL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AT another door he stopped, wrenching it open
  and laying hands upon a cord that hung within it. He jerked
  upon it, released it, and stood waiting with hands clenched as
  though in, impatience, until there rose slowly into sight a
  platform, upon which he stepped. The platform sank slowly,
  carrying him downward inside a rock-faced shaft, which ended
  in a dimly lighted chamber, where blue men strained about a
  capstan and windlass by means of which the primitive lift was
  controlled.</p>

  <p>"Hai! The Mouthpiece of Zitu requires a motur and one to
  drive it," Croft addressed the man in charge.</p>

  <p>The fellow saluted and turned away. I saw there were
  several moturs parked against one of the chamber walls. And
  too, I recalled that Croft had found a similar arrangement in
  the pyramid of Himyra when first he called on Magur, save that
  then the room had been used to house the carriages and gnuppas
  of the priests.</p>

  <p>Croft strode toward one of the waiting cars, and a man
  appeared. As Jason climbed to a seat he took his place at the
  wheel and the engine roared. Blue men set open a heavy door
  and stood aside. Through it the car darted out of the base of
  the pyramid to reach the street beyond it.</p>

  <p>"To the palace of Jadgor, and hasten!" Jason cried.</p>

  <p>Then, as the motur fled between the white-walled houses of
  Zitra, he leaned back, his face pallid in the moonlight
  beneath his plumes of azure. His lips parted.
  "Zitu&mdash;Zitu," I caught a whisper, and knew that to him in
  the urge of his need its progress seemed slow, no matter how
  swiftly it moved. Yet in reality the time was very short ere
  the official residence of the President of Tamarizia was
  reached Jason was out of the motur almost before it paused.
  And then for the first time, save as he had described it, I
  saw the inside of the former imperial palace, with its
  silver-sheathed beams supporting the roof of varicolored glass
  above the inner court, its tessellated pavement of sparkling
  crystal and silver and gold, across which, once he had gained
  admittance, Jason, Mouthpiece of Zitu, strode toward the
  captain of the guard.</p>

  <p>The soldier came to attention, saluting with uplifted
  palm.</p>

  <p>"Go," Croft directed. "Say to Jadgor, President of
  Tamarizia, and Lakkon of Aphur, that the Mouthpiece of Zitu
  seeks speech with them concerning a matter of importance."</p>

  <p>"Aye, Hupor and Mouthpiece of Zitu." The captain saluted
  again and departed at once.</p>

  <p>We waited, Jason and I, Croft a commanding figure in his
  physical presence, clouded of brow and set of lip, standing
  with bent crest and deep-heaving chest while the guardsmen
  watched out of speculative eyes this proud man of their nation
  who came on some urgent, undreamed mission in the night,
  myself seeing it all but unseen by any save Jason dimly, as he
  had said.</p>

  <p>The captain returned.</p>

  <p>"If my lord will follow. . . ." He spoke in suggestive
  fashion, saluted once more, and waited his superior's
  pleasure.</p>

  <p>"Lead on." Croft lifted his bended head and followed his
  clanking escort up a flight of crystal stairs and down a
  far-reaching corridor, resplendent with scarlet hangings on
  walls of silver and gold.</p>

  <p>Before a door of silver embossed with the circle and cross
  of Zitra, the captain paused, striking three times against the
  metal surface with the butt of his copper sword.</p>

  <p>Jadgor himself set the portal open, peering at Croft from
  dark eyes set on either side of a high-bridged, slightly
  aquiline nose. Seen so, he seemed a less commanding figure
  than in official dress, for now he was gowned merely in a
  shirt of silken fabric, reaching from his strong neck nearly
  to his heels.</p>

  <p>"Hai, Jason, what cause, in Zitu's name, brings you to
  disturb our slumbers?" he began as Croft passed inside.</p>

  <p>"Cause in plenty," Croft made answer, his glance sweeping
  the apartment, "of which I would speak with you and Lakkon.
  Cause enough to warrant the driving of sleep from your
  eyes."</p>

  <p>Jadgor closed the door and turned.</p>

  <p>"Come, then," he said, and led the way toward a farther
  room, hung in scarlet, furnished with a silver bed and table
  and carven chairs of the usual red wood, in one of which sat
  Lakkon.</p>

  <p>Croft followed, and just inside the door of the sumptuous
  apartment he paused.</p>

  <p>"Behold in me, Jadgor, and Lakkon, father of Naia, my wife,
  a messenger of evil tidings," he said hoarsely, "in that the
  house of Jason in the mountains has been betrayed, and the
  light of it removed."</p>

  <p>"Betrayed?" Lakkon stiffened.</p>

  <p>"Removed?" Jadgor repeated. "Jason, what mean you?"</p>

  <p>"Sit, Jadgor," Jason suggested. "My heart is heavy within
  me, and there is much to be made plain concerning the
  affair."</p>

  <p>Jadgor complied without shifting the scrutiny of his keen
  eyes from Croft's face. Croft himself drew a chair to the
  silver table, where the other two men had taken place. And
  then he told them all that had happened, from first to last,
  save that he omitted any mention of my presence.</p>

  <p>As he spoke, I watched each face.</p>

  <p>Plainly the men believed him. Their expressions gave no
  evidence of doubt. They had been given sufficient proof of his
  astral ability in the past, and they did not question the
  truth of what he alleged he had discovered in the spirit while
  his physical body seemed wrapped in heavy sleep. Jadgor held
  his thick-set figure stiffly. He clenched his heavy hands.
  Horror waked on Lakkon's sternly molded features. And at the
  end it was Jadgor, the soldier, the patriot, the man who had
  labored to make strong his nation, who spoke first.</p>

  <p>"Now, by Zitu, and by Zitu," he roared the Tamarizian
  double oath, and struck the burnished top of the table with
  his fist, "are the affronts&mdash;the annoyances&mdash;the
  ceaseless schemings of these spawns of Zitemku beyond
  Tamarizia's borders to never cease! And if not, what duty lies
  to Tamarizia before that in the fulfillment of which Zollaria
  shall be crushed? Jason, twice have you led the armies of
  Tamarizia against them and their allies. Gather them once more
  together, with my approval, and punish these treacherous
  beasts."</p>

  <p>And if I had thought him more the man and less the
  statesman when first I entered the room and viewed him in
  undress, I felt myself moved to reverse my judgment now. This
  was no lesser spirit, stern of visage, glaring half risen from
  his seat toward Croft, leaning slightly toward him, still
  resting his weight upon the knotted knuckles of his heavy
  fist.</p>

  <p>Croft, too, I am sure, was momentarily moved by Jadgor's
  swift readiness to resort to arms, since for an instant, as
  the president faced him, his own eyes fired. But then he shook
  his head slightly, setting the azure plumes on his helmet
  nodding.</p>

  <p>"Nay," he said slowly. "Nay, Jadgor&mdash;I am a man, as
  thou art, and the notion quickens my pulses, but&mdash;in my
  judgment this matter is less to be settled by force of arms
  than by a resort to craft."</p>

  <p>"Hilka!" Suddenly Lakkon's voice broke forth. "Hold! You
  would balk the issue? You would seek by a use of
  trickery&mdash;a matching of wits&mdash;to answer an insult to
  Tamarizia and thyself? Was it for this I gave my consent to
  your union with my daughter&mdash;or that she went down to the
  gates of Zilla's realm in the bearing of your child? Has
  marriage softened you so much, Jason, that the blood turns to
  water in your veins? Now, by Zitu&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hilka! Hold!" Croft mouthed his own words at him. His face
  was pallid, its eyes narrowed, its lips gone livid. "Father of
  Naia&mdash;I respect thy surprise and grief, and therefore
  forgive your words. Yet speak not so concerning my position in
  this affair, until you consider all sides of the matter. Think
  you that, had I any suspicion of what was intended, I had left
  her whose love is the crowning glory of my existence unguarded
  in my house? Nay, by Zitu&mdash;she had lain in the house of
  Robur, son of Jadgor&mdash;safe within Himyra's walls. And
  take thought on what I have told you, Lakkon. Recall the oath
  of Kalamita. Consider, in judging my position, that a resort
  to arms would forfeit the life of your grandson and my child.
  Since you are a father, take heed of a father's fears."</p>

  <p>His voice faltered. He bent forward, resting his head upon
  folded arms on the table. For the first time in all his life
  on Palos, Jason's haughty crest was bowed.</p>

  <p>Jadgor glanced at Lakkon. He nodded. "By Zitu, my brother,
  we were overquick; It were well that Jason appears to have
  kept his wits."</p>

  <p>The anger faded from Lakkon's face and he rose. Passing
  about the table, he laid a hand on Croft's bended
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Your pardon, my son," he stammered in the embarrassed
  fashion strong men use on such occasions. "I was overhasty.
  What, then, do you propose?"</p>

  <p>"As yet I know not." Jason lifted his head and turned
  clouded eyes on Lakkon. "Nor would I have you in this matter
  think me cold. Word I will send to Robur, and myself shall
  depart for Himyra at once. Let Jadgor give me orders for the
  captain of his swiftest galley. Even so my man Bathos will
  reach the city ere I arrive. And since this Kalamita proposes
  a meeting at which Zollaria's demands will be presented, it
  occurs to me that as a first step she should be met."</p>

  <p>Jadgor appeared to consider. "But not by the Mouthpiece of
  Zitu?" he said at last.</p>

  <p>"Nay?" Croft eyed him sharply.</p>

  <p>Jadgor nodded. His first flash of spirit appeared to have
  passed. "Think you Zitu's mouthpiece would be permitted to
  return from such a meeting? And we are to match treachery by
  craft, we must guard ourselves from traps. Ill as are the
  circumstances that confront us, were they not a hundredfold
  increased with Jason in Zollaria's hands? Then indeed would
  Tamarizia find herself in evil case!"</p>

  <p>Lakkon's old eyes widened under his grizzled brows. "You
  suspect a trap, then, Jadgor?" he questioned.</p>

  <p>"Aye, and this lure of the flesh, this Kalamita, is
  connected with it," the Tamarizia president declared. Warrior,
  he was prone to think first of arms, but as it seemed to me
  now, not lacking in statecraft either, once he gave his mind
  to it. "To me it seems she has taken into account the hearts
  of men, in sending word of the meeting&mdash;deeming the
  husband and father would rush to his and his country's undoing
  without due consideration of where his act might lead. Against
  such an ending, thanks be to Zitu and Jason's ability to
  obtain knowledge in his deathlike sleeps, we are forewarned,
  and Tamarizia keeps what yet she has. What say you,
  Jason?"</p>

  <p>"That Jadgor's words lighten my position somewhat," Croft
  made answer. "Since, had his mind not so clearly seen what in
  my belief was intended, it had been no easy task to make my
  stand in the matter understood, and perchance I would have
  seemed to him and Lakkon rather a man of milk and water, than
  one of blood&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nay," Lakkon interrupted, his face gone haggard, "forget
  my words. Horror of what had befallen had dulled my
  understanding, husband of Naia. How mean you&mdash;that
  Zollaria's terms shall be refused?"</p>

  <p>"By Zitemku, the fiend of the foul pit of damnation, what
  else?" Jadgor roared before Croft could answer. "Does
  Tamarizia weaken herself or yield one hand's-breadth to that
  northern horde?"</p>

  <p>Croft nodded. "Zollaria's demands may not be granted. Let
  that be understood," he replied to Jadgor's outburst.</p>

  <p>Lakkon winced. "Thou canst say so, who having asked me not
  to think thee cold, seem yet so little moved?"</p>

  <p>For the second time Croft stiffened at his father-in-law's
  words. His face flushed deeply, and he rose, towering, the
  splendid figure of a man, against the end of the table, while
  Jadgor and Lakkon watched.</p>

  <p>"Tamarizia must not be weakened," he reaffirmed his
  position. "Cold I may seem to Lakkon, and little moved, and
  now, thanks to him, I am cold indeed. Yet have I sworn an oath
  not to fail her who looks on me to save her. And I shall
  succeed in what I am undertaking, without forgetting the
  interests of this nation, or&mdash;by Azil himself I swear
  it&mdash;let all men cease to speak of Jason as one among
  living men. From here I go to send a message to Robur, and
  after that upon a galley. Come, Jadgor, give me your order to
  its captain that he may prove bidable to my commands."</p>

  <p>For a moment as he ceased speaking silence came down in the
  room where the lights pricked out the azure cross and wings of
  Azil on his cuirass, as he waited. Cold he had said to me he
  would become and to Jadgor and Lakkon cold&mdash;as cold as
  some deadly tempered weapon, in all outward seeming now he
  was. Lakkon's expression altered, became embarrassed. He
  glanced from Croft to Jadgor, and moistened his lips with his
  tongue.</p>

  <p>Jadgor moved. He left his seat, found wax-coated tablets
  and a stylus, and returned. For a moment or two he wrote
  rapidly, cutting his official mandate to the captain of the
  galley into the virgin surface. Then, rising, once more he
  handed it to Croft.</p>

  <p>"Go," he said, "and Zitu go with you. You will keep us
  informed in this matter?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, as it progresses." Croft accepted the tablet. "Zitu
  keep you, Jadgor." He turned to leave.</p>

  <p>"Jason," Lakkon quavered.</p>

  <p>Jason paused.</p>

  <p>"Depart not from me in anger. I sought not truly to give
  you fresh offense. And&mdash;and carry my blessing to my
  daughter when next you meet her in the spirit, as she has told
  me thou canst."</p>

  <p>For a barely perceptible interval Croft appeared to
  hesitate, and then he caught a heavy breath.</p>

  <p>"Against the father of Naia of Aphur it were hard indeed
  for anger to find a place in my heart. Zitu be with you,
  Lakkon, also," he said, and left.</p>

  <p>Outside the room he made his way, outside the palace of
  Jadgor, once more to a seat in the motur, and in it toward the
  city walls and the foot of a mounting flight of stairs.</p>

  <p>A sentry stood with sword and spear before them. Croft
  addressed him. He saluted and permitted him to pass. Jason,
  Mouthpiece of Zitu, climbed up in the silvery moonlight, his
  shadow a purple blot beside him, to reach the top at last. And
  there strangely in all that archaic scene he paused before the
  door of a hut, above which towered the spidery outline of a
  wireless mast. For an instant he turned his eyes outward over
  the expanse of the Central Sea, and then he passed inside.</p>

  <p>A man seated at a table, with the key of the wireless
  before him, started to his feet.</p>

  <p>"A message to Robur, Governor of Aphur in Himyra, and
  quickly," Croft said.</p>

  <p>The operator regained his seat and produced his headdress,
  clamping it against his ears. Croft gave the message. There
  came the hissing crash of the spark. Strange, I found myself
  thinking as I watched&mdash;an anachronism surely that this
  youth of Palos, clad in plain tunic and sandals and leg
  casings of leather, above which showed the sinewy flesh of his
  lower thighs and knees, should be sitting here on top of the
  ramparts of a walled city, hurling forth across the ocean
  beyond him the potential Hertzian waves. And yet it was no
  more strange than that I should know it&mdash;than that the
  grim-visaged man in the metal harness of a Tamarizian noble
  was the one through whose genius it was inspired.</p>

  <p>And then the thing was done. The crashing of the spark was
  silenced. Croft tossed a coin on the table and passed outside
  and down the stairs. And when next the motur paused he gave
  the driver another coin and dismissed him. He stood before a
  galley, moored close to the semicircular quays of Zitra's
  inner harbor, stretching like a pool of liquid silver beyond
  him to the mighty sea doors that closed the entrance to it in
  the overarching walls.</p>

  <p>But though I thrilled to the massive grandeur of the
  picture, Croft heeded it little. To him it was an old scene,
  and, too, he was ridden with the spur of haste.</p>

  <p>"Hai! Captain of the watch, aboard the galley!" he hailed
  sharply and stood waiting until a head appeared above the rail
  of the waist and a voice replied:</p>

  <p>"Who calls?"</p>

  <p>"Jason, Mouthpiece of Zitu, with the mandate of Jadgor from
  the palace of Jadgor. I would come toward you," Croft made
  answer.</p>

  <p>The head disappeared. For possibly two minutes nothing
  happened, and then a; gangway was shoved out to reach the
  quay.</p>

  <p>Croft strode along it, presented Jadgor's tablet to a
  suddenly wide awake captain, and was led to an apartment under
  the after-deck, richly furnished in red woods and hangings of
  scarlet, the personal color of Jadgor's house.</p>

  <p>Life woke on board the galley. There was a tramping of
  feet, a sound of voices bawling orders, suddenly the sibilant
  hiss of water past the hull. The galley heeled slightly on the
  long arc of a circle, straightened back to an even keel.
  Through the windows let into the stern I became conscious of a
  graying of the eastern heavens, and then a shadow fell upon
  us. It came to me that the monster sea doors were opened to
  permit our passing.</p>

  <p>Croft sank down upon a couch of burnished copper and
  sighed. He turned his glance about the apartment. "Are you
  still here, Murray?" he questioned.</p>

  <p>"Aye," I bent my thought upon him, and he smiled a trifle
  wanly as he caught the form of my answer.</p>

  <p>"Better be going," he said. "But give me the benefit of
  your thoughts in the next few days. If you've waited until
  now, you've had recent proof of how hard it is for the father
  to hold his personal interests of lesser importance than
  matters of state."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, man," I returned. "We'll beat them. Once you're
  in Himyra, you and Robur will get your heads together, and I'm
  going to work collecting, all the information I can obtain on
  the device I suggested earlier tonight."</p>

  <p>"Do so." He nodded and stretched himself out on the couch.
  "I'll use it if we can think of nothing else. You and
  Rob&mdash;" All at once he used a diminutive form of Robur's
  name, of which he had told me before. "Murray, I thank Zitu
  for you both. I know I have your sympathy and understanding,
  and&mdash;I'll find the same things once I am in Himyra. I'll
  see you inside the next few days, of course."</p>

  <p>From now on this narrative must become, until the end, an
  account of Croft's efforts toward the rescue of Naia and
  Jason, rather than of things experienced by myself. For now I
  was become little more than his lieutenant on earth&mdash;a
  collector of knowledge to whom, when he came in the astral
  presence to gain it, he told how that knowledge was to be
  employed.</p>

  <p>In the body he went to Himyra first. But astrally he willed
  himself back that morning after I had left him, aboard
  Kalamita's gilded craft, where rather than the tawny siren,
  the lure that led him was his wife and child. Naia of
  Aphur&mdash;the love of her, as ever since first he had seen
  her, was a flame in Jason's breast.</p>

  <p>Gor he found sleeping within the passage, sprawled
  barrierlike inside its door. Kalamita, too, lay wrapped in
  slumber, her scheming brain at rest. Inside one of the
  curtained apartments Maia slept also on a couch drawn
  crosswise of the door. Naia of Aphur alone was wakeful,
  brooding with troubled eyes above the sleeping infant.</p>

  <p>To Croft, as he saw her, she seemed then the embodiment of
  all the meaning involved in the wonderful statue of Ga the
  Eternal Mother he had seen once in the quarters of the
  Gayana&mdash;the Tamarizian vestals brooding above the altar
  of the sacred fire, with the form of a babe on her knees.</p>

  <p>Thrilling at sight of her so, he stood before her.</p>

  <p>"Beloved," he called her.</p>

  <p>She stiffened to attention, lifting her head. Her lips
  moved.</p>

  <p>"I have waited thy coming, Jason," she whispered, her fair
  face lighting as she responded to his summons.</p>

  <p>"You heard all, know all?" she questioned as Croft drew her
  wraithlike form inside his yearning arms.</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;golden woman&mdash;and marveled at thy spirit,"
  he made answer, ere he told her what he had accomplished and
  gave her Lakkon's message, mentioning at the end the possible
  means of rescue I had suggested.</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" Naia faltered. "It were strange indeed, were it
  not, if the answer to this riddle be found by our friend of
  earth?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, strange," said Jason, "yet not more so than that,
  despite their knowledge, I stand here now before you."</p>

  <p>"Yet he is wise," she replied, clinging closer to him, "in
  that he saw quickly the true meaning of the meeting between
  you and herself this Zollarian woman saw fit to propose.
  Myself have I promised throughout the night that, once you had
  come again to me, I would see you warned."</p>

  <p>Croft smiled in rueful fashion. "Jadgor, too, was against
  it. It would seem that all perceived the motive of it, save
  only Jason alone."</p>

  <p>"Ah, but&mdash;" Naia lifted a hand to lay it against his
  cheek&mdash;"Jason, my beloved, was overwrought."</p>

  <p>"Aye," he confessed; "and now it appears to him that it was
  on that Kalamita counted to lead him into a trap."</p>

  <p>"And will count," said Naia, "not knowing the strange power
  you have taught me, by which we meet."</p>

  <p>Croft nodded. "And through which their every move may be
  watched. To my mind, beloved&mdash;this meeting on which she
  is bent at present must be brought about."</p>

  <p>"But not by Jason!" The fires of Naia's astral body paled
  in swift alarm. "Not by you, beloved."</p>

  <p>"Nay," Croft reassured her, "not by Jason, but another, in
  a fashion, once I am in Himyra, Robur and I shall devise."</p>

  <p>"Hold, then." Naia paused to consider before she went on
  quickly. "Perchance against a woman, a woman's wits may aid
  you. Told she not Bathos to say this meeting would be north of
  Cathur&mdash;and sought she not once ere this, when before you
  fought to make me thine, beloved, to work harm to Tamarizia
  through Cathur's prince, so that the succession was lost to
  Koryphu, his brother, and in the elections for governor, even
  though he sought to gain the station, he was ignored? Think
  you not that in Koryphu, Scythys's younger son, you may find
  one with hate in his heart for this woman and an agent to your
  hand?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, by Zitu!" Croft cried, gazing into her lifted face
  out of startled eyes. "Naia, you have said it. Koryphu, and he
  will consent, is the man."</p>

  <p>And so to Scira, capital city of Cathur, he willed
  himself.</p>

  <p>Long familiarity with Scira made it easy for him to reach
  the residence, which, after the overthrow of his family, had
  become the home of Cathur's lesser prince. And there he found
  Koryphu, always unlike Kyphallos, his brother, more or less of
  a student, already busy with the tablets and scrolls that as
  yet in Tamarizia took the place of books. Satisfied that his
  man would be easy to locate when needed, he returned to the
  galley at once.</p>

  <p>Thereafter followed a weird four days and nights, during
  the lighted portion of which Croft occupied himself as best he
  might, while the galley plowed across the Central Sea toward
  the mouth of the Na up which lay Himyra. And when the daylight
  faded he stretched himself on the couch in his apartment and
  joined Naia in the spirit, going with her north to a Zollarian
  seaport, and from it in gnuppa-drawn conveyances wherein the
  passengers reclined on deeply padded cushions, toward Berla,
  discovering thereby that no matter what Kalamita may have said
  to Bathos regarding the place of Naia's holding, she was to be
  taken to the seat of the Zollarian government first. So much
  he had learned both from his astral conversations with her and
  the remarks of the guards which reached his ears, by the time
  Himyra was reached.</p>

  <p>Himyra. Croft stepped upon its quays, where lapped the
  yellow Na, with a feeling of relief. Himyra&mdash;home. It was
  so he regarded that red city more than any other place on
  Palos outside his own house. Himyra&mdash;it was here he had
  labored&mdash;here he had molded the present strength of the
  Tamarizian nation&mdash;from here he had gone twice to make
  good his claims of that strength&mdash;here, outside the
  circling walls towering like ruddy buttes above the sands of
  the Aphurian desert, he had seen Naia of Aphur, read love in
  the depths of her purple eyes first.</p>

  <p>"Jason!"</p>

  <p>He whirled, to behold Robur coming toward him from a
  motur.</p>

  <p>"Rob!" He turned in his direction.</p>

  <p>They met, and Robur clasped him to his breast.</p>

  <p>"My brother in all but birth," he said with emotion. "Would
  Zitu he had not sent this thing upon you. Gaya sends her
  greeting. Myself I timed your arrival, and so soon as the
  gatemen reported your galley's passing, drove down to carry
  you to a friendly house."</p>

  <p>"Like thee, Rob," Croft said, his heart warmed by such a
  meeting. "In Himyra, and thy presence, I breathe easier than
  for days. Bathos, my servant, has arrived?"</p>

  <p>"The sun before this," Robur returned as they moved toward
  his waiting motur. "Himyra, Aphur, and Robur stand ready to
  aid you in all things toward the rescue of our cousin. Jason
  need but say the word."</p>

  <p>"Presently," said Croft, "when I sit in the presence of
  Gaya and Robur, my true friends."</p>

  <p>Suddenly he found himself yearning for the compassion of
  the gentle, brown-haired matron, Robur's wife, who ere this
  had listened with patient understanding to his
  troubles&mdash;had aided him more than she knew herself in
  Naia's wooing. He laid a hand on Robur's knee as the Aphurian
  drove the motur up the easy grade of the embankment to reach
  the thoroughfare fronting the Na. "Then, Rob, must you aid me
  both as a man and an avenger indeed."</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" Robur eyed him. "Are you, then, so broken?"</p>

  <p>Croft's expression hardened, his voice deepened.</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;I am shaken, Rob, but&mdash;once let my course
  in this be plain, and you shall find me far from a broken
  reed."</p>

  <p>"Hai!" Robur nodded. "That is better&mdash;more like the
  old Jason. For a moment you dismayed me."</p>

  <p>He reached the top of the embankment and increased the
  motur's speed.</p>

  <p>In through the wide doors of the palace, with their doglike
  guardians of stone, and their weblike wings, to the red court
  where blue men, sprinkled water upon the ruddy pavement, he
  drove. Past sentries armed with spears and short swords, who
  sprang to swift attention at sight of Aphur's governor, and
  the Mouthpiece of Zitu&mdash;the wonder worker of their
  nation, descending from one of his own creations&mdash;he led
  Croft into a private wing of the palace, and through it to the
  inner court, where Gaya waited on a couch beneath a striped
  awning, close to the sun-kissed waters of the bathing
  pool.</p>

  <p>Croft's heart swelled as he once more entered the
  well-known lounging place. Here Naia and Robur and he had
  played at ball more than once together. Here it was she had
  called him Aquor, when they bathed. And in those shimmering
  waters he had caught his "little silver fish". For a moment
  his eyes dimmed as he bent above. Gaya's hand, in silent
  salutation, not trusting himself to speak&mdash;so that, moved
  by a swift emotion, the woman caught his face as he raised it
  between her palms and kissed him on the cheek.</p>

  <p>"Jason, my friend," she said softly, "take thought that the
  ways of Zitu are past understanding, and that from this
  further ordeal now laid upon you may come a double peace."</p>

  <p>"Hai!" exclaimed Robur quickly. "Give heed to her, Jason.
  At times she seems given prophetic vision. Perchance this
  double peace is for thee and Tamarizia also."</p>

  <p>"Zitu grant it," said Croft, deeply affected by Gaya's
  greeting. "It is of that we must speak after I have made
  certain things plain."</p>

  <p>Robur nodded. Gaya returned to the couch. The two men drew
  other seats beside her, and Croft narrated his story.</p>

  <p>"First in my mind comes this meeting with the woman
  herself. Since she journeys first to Berla, it is certain some
  time must still elapse ere she goes to her hunting lodge. And
  as regards the meeting itself, here is what I propose." He
  rapidly outlined a plan for sending a Tamarizian party into
  the mountains north of Cathur, and at the last he mentioned
  Koryphu's name.</p>

  <p>"Hai!" Robur's face lighted. "Now, by Zitu, Jason, you have
  found the proper man. True is he in his heart, as I believe,
  and a sufferer from his brother's treason. He should welcome
  this task as a means of proving his loyalty to his nation and
  in so much reestablishing himself&mdash;and where were a
  better agent, to represent us before this unclean woman, by
  whom his brother was disgraced?"</p>

  <p>"Naia brought the man to my mind," said Jason, unwilling to
  appropriate the credit.</p>

  <p>"Aye"&mdash;Gaya smiled&mdash;"the step savors of a woman.
  Kalamita will gain small satisfaction when she meets him face
  to face. It is a proper choice."</p>

  <p>"He lies at Scira?" Robur questioned.</p>

  <p>Croft nodded. "Aye&mdash;I have visited him in spirit
  inside the last five days&mdash;and found him busy with
  tablets and scrolls, more student than man of affairs."</p>

  <p>"Then," Robur declared with quick decision, "we go to Scira
  and lay the matter before him without delay."</p>

  <p>"Nay"&mdash;Croft shook his head&mdash;"first shall I be
  present in Berla in my own fashion when Naia arrives.
  Meanwhile, Robur, you and I arrange other details for the
  mission to this meeting, and prepare to reopen the shops."</p>

  <p>For a moment Robur regarded him out of narrowed eyes, and
  then he nodded. "Has the Mouthpiece of Zitu some new device
  for the making, he will find me ready to work with him upon it
  as in the past."</p>

  <p>Jason smiled at his ready acceptance. There had been no
  time when he had failed to find Robur's interest in the modern
  innovations he had introduced on Palos lacking, or had been
  denied his aid in their production. The Aphurian was of a most
  progressive mind.</p>

  <p>"Nay," he said now, "I know not, nor will till after this
  meeting with the Zollarian woman. And after that it may be I
  shall revisit earth."</p>

  <p>"Earth!" Robur exclaimed. "When last you attempted such a
  matter, the thing was an affair of Zitrans. Think
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hold, Rob," Jason interrupted. "Within the last
  cycle&mdash;I have visited and conversed with a man of earth
  in the spirit rather than the flesh."</p>

  <p>Gaya caught her breath sharply. Both she and Robur knew the
  history of Croft's former mundane existence. Yet now she
  seemed shaken.</p>

  <p>"Jason," she faltered, "as man I know you, yet are there
  times when to me you seem more like to a spirit in man's form
  even as on a time Zud of Zitra said." Her eyes were wide.</p>

  <p>Croft turned to her.</p>

  <p>"Man is a spirit, Gaya, my friend and wife of my all but
  brother," he said slowly. "Yet now my spirit is heavy, in that
  I am a man bereft. Wherefore, ere this thing be finished, I
  shall work in body and spirit to regain what I have lost."</p>

  <p>"Enough," Robur prompted. "This is between ourselves. Man
  thou art, and husband and father. This visit to earth has
  somewhat to do with a new device?"</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;should nothing develop from the meeting after
  Koryphu's return, if he accepts. Rob, have you stores in
  plenty of metals, rubber, and cloth?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, in plenty&mdash;and if not, since Koryphu's mission
  will take the best part of a Zitran to arrange and carry out,
  it were possible to put double shifts at the forges and send
  the weavers to their looms."</p>

  <p>"Then do so," Jason accepted, filling his chest with a
  heavy inhalation, "for it is in my mind that ere Naia and
  Jason, Son of Jason, shall see Aphur again strange things
  shall be seen in the skies."</p>

  <p>"In the skies!" Robur cried, his dark eyes flashing.</p>

  <p>"Aye," said the Mouthpiece of Zitu, "in the skies."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">V. &mdash; IN BERLA</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FREEDOM of action, cooperation, a friendly
  understanding, marked the following days for Croft. That night
  he visited Naia while his body lay in a room in Robur's part
  of the palace, covered with a silken tissue, worked over by
  Gaya's own maids, whom she sent to rub into its stalwart
  muscles, soft, nourishing, perfumed ointments, such as the
  Tamarizian nobles used.</p>

  <p>He found the Zollarian party not far from Berla, confident
  that the succeeding day would see them inside the city itself.
  He returned to Himyra for a few hours, spoke with Gaya and
  Robur, stretched himself out once more, and willed himself
  back to Naia, and slipped into the conveyance where she rode
  with Maia and Jason, very much as he had sat and gazed upon
  her, drunk with the beauty of her, the day he had seen her
  first outside Himyra's lifted walls. So it was he had promised
  her the night before he would accompany her into Berla when
  she arrived.</p>

  <p>The entry itself was made a spectacle for the crowds. In
  fact, it was clear to Croft that the thing was staged. What
  ever doubts he may have entertained concerning Zollaria's
  participation in Kalamita's abduction of Naia and Jason as a
  state, vanished, leaving a cold conviction that the woman had
  acted less as an individual than in an agent's place.</p>

  <p>Outside the walls of Berla the party was halted by a
  patrol. The curtains, on Naia's carriage were drawn back,
  leaving the occupants exposed. Guardsmen approached and placed
  golden bands joined by a golden chain upon her slender ankles,
  and on her arms. A chariot such as the Zollarians used in war,
  save that it was burnished to the last degree, as it advanced
  behind green-plumed gnuppas harnessed four abreast, emerged
  from Berla's gate and deposited a massively built warrior, in
  splendid harness, beside the conveyance in which Kalamita
  rode.</p>

  <p>Croft recognized Bandhor, general of the Zollarian army, as
  Kalamita appeared. She flung herself from her carriage, her
  face distorted with displeasure, almost before his chariot had
  paused with lunging steeds.</p>

  <p>"By Bel, what is the meaning of this interference with my
  entry into the city?" she broke forth in a voice of
  passion.</p>

  <p>"Interference! Nay, it is a triumph. They make a holiday of
  your return with your captives, priestess of beauty," Bandhor
  roared.</p>

  <p>"Holiday? Triumph?" the woman repeated with a curling lip.
  "Are we then at war, Bandhor, since I departed?"</p>

  <p>"Nay," he returned, viewing her rage with what seemed a
  sense of amusement. "Nor will be&mdash;since Kalamita brings
  with her the guarantees of peace. Come, I will lead you into
  the city."</p>

  <p>For a moment his sister considered, tapping the metal of
  the roadway with a sandaled foot. Plainly her displeasure in
  this change of whatever plans she may have had was in no way
  diminished, but in the end she accepted. "So be it. But wait."
  She turned and disappeared into her carriage, from which after
  some few moments she again emerged.</p>

  <p>She had altered her dress, and now in the Sirian sun she
  blazed. Jeweled shields, supported against her fair skin by a
  gem-incrusted harness, covered her breast&mdash;a green skirt
  embroidered with flashing stones fell from a scintillating
  girdle about her hips and thighs. Green were the plumes above
  her tawny hair, and the sandals on her feet, the casings on
  her calves. A barbaric picture, she strode toward Bandhor's
  car with its restive gnuppas.</p>

  <p>"If we triumph, let us triumph fitly," she said in scornful
  fashion, and stepped into the driver's place. "It is my
  pleasure, Bandhor, my brother, to lead my triumph myself."</p>

  <p>Gathering the reins into her hands, she turned the gnuppas
  back toward the gate of the city in a swirling smother of
  dust.</p>

  <p>"Thou tawny devil!" Bandhor cried, his eyes flashing with
  admiration as he caught the tail of the rocking car and sprang
  aboard. "Forward, Zollarians&mdash;into the city!"</p>

  <p>The patrol that had stopped them formed on either side of
  Naia's carriage. Kalamita's party fell in behind it. They
  passed through the gate, and between the living banks of a
  swarming, jostling, neck-craning crowd that lined the main
  avenue of Berla as far as the eye could reach.</p>

  <p>Their advent excited a roar. Small doubt but their identity
  was known&mdash;or that this haling of the wife and child of
  the strong man of Tamarizia, captive, seemed a triumph to the
  minds of the Zollarian populace indeed. Yells, shrieks, and
  screeches filled the air. Curses of every degree of vileness
  were mouthed. The mob jostled, pressed closer to the carriage
  of the captives. Someone threw a stone. Naia lifted Jason and
  placed him under the rear wall of the conveyances, where it
  curved upward to form the canopy or top.</p>

  <p>Her body formed a shield before him. For the rest, her pale
  face remained unmoved in its haughty calmness. Watching her,
  Croft's heart was filled with pride. Maia crept to her and
  crouched on the cushions beside her, plainly frightened. But
  save for that instinctive guarding of her offspring, Naia of
  Aphur gave no sign of fear.</p>

  <p>"Hail to Kalamita, priestess of beauty. Hail Bandhor. Hail
  to Kalamita, who brings to Zollaria those through whom she
  shall be made once more stronger than the strongest," the
  populace roared.</p>

  <p>It occurred to Croft to see how Kalamita herself was
  receiving the acclamation. He left Naia's vehicle briefly and
  joined himself to the woman, reining the prancing gnuppas with
  a practiced hand.</p>

  <p>He found her face wreathed in a forced smile, and her tawny
  eyes, back of their fringing lashes, ablaze.</p>

  <p>"Who has spread the report that these shall make Zollaria
  strong?" she hissed at her brother.</p>

  <p>"Helmor," he told her after a moment's hesitation. "So soon
  as your advance messenger reached Berla, he commanded the
  success of your mission announced."</p>

  <p>"Helmor," said Kalamita thickly. "Him whom Tamarizia has
  most grievously defeated. Is the emperor one to gain credit
  from my work before the masses, or a fool to consider a thing
  as accomplished ere it is done? Was it not agreed between us,
  Bandhor, that after she should have been brought quietly to
  Berla she should be taken into the mountains until I had
  tricked this Tamarizian Mouthpiece?"</p>

  <p>"To a meeting?" Bandhor muttered.</p>

  <p>"Aye, to a meeting," said his sister, "after which he also
  would have been in our hands."</p>

  <p>"Provided he came to the meeting."</p>

  <p>"Came?" Kalamita curled her lips as she answered. "You,
  Bandhor, are one to whom women are no more than a moment's
  toys, but to that one, that palefaced creature, behind us,
  means more. Aye, he had come, for I sent word that I held the
  woman, and bade him to a meeting to give ear to my
  demands."</p>

  <p>"By Bel," growled Bandhor, "Helmor believes it not, and who
  was Bandhor to stay his hand? Say what you will to me, my
  sister, but, once we reach the palace, curb your tongue."</p>

  <p>"Nay&mdash;I fear him not." Kalamita shrugged her
  shoulders. "This display is a mistake, as I shall show him.
  The matter should have been conducted in quiet, till it was
  past."</p>

  <p>Vastly pleased that Kalamita's plans were already going
  contrary to her liking, Croft returned to Naia, and remained
  throughout the noisy progress until the palace was-reached,
  and she was led inside between double rows of guards.</p>

  <p>Into the palace of Helmor, Emperor of all Zollaria, her
  golden head proudly lifted, Naia of Aphur passed, walking with
  steady footsteps once her shackles were removed. And Maia
  followed across a huge interior similar in most respects to
  the Tamarizian structures, bearing in her blue arms Jason's
  son. Palace guards opened a door before them. They passed into
  an audience chamber to stand before Helmor at last.</p>

  <p>He sat there on a silver chair upon a dais, the steps
  leading to which were spread with gorgeously colored rugs. And
  as her guards led Naia of Aphur toward him, with Kalamita and
  her brother close behind them, he glowered.</p>

  <p>Croft knew him by sight. There had been a time when he had
  forced him on a stricken field to enter his own armored motor,
  prisoner of war, and guarantee of an early peace, on the day
  Zollaria's hopes of conquest over Tamarizia had gone down in
  red defeat. And now he watched as he opened his lips to speak,
  in a somewhat taunting fashion:</p>

  <p>"Greetings to Naia of Aphur, whose presence gives all
  Zollaria pleasure, in that times are changed, and that where
  once Helmor was held hostage for Tamarizia's demands, Naia and
  her child are now the guests of Helmor until their ransom be
  paid."</p>

  <p>For a moment the woman before him said nothing, staring
  straight back into his gloating visage out of steady purple
  eyes. And then her lips parted. "And were apt to be a guest
  overlong, should Zollaria ask more than Naia of Aphur, or any
  other woman, were worth?"</p>

  <p>"Say you so?" Helmor seemed somewhat taken aback by that
  haughty response, at which the quick fires of admiration
  stirred in Jason's spirit. "Yet perchance the Tamarizian
  Mouthpiece will place upon her a greater valuation than she
  lays upon herself."</p>

  <p>"Those things lie with the gods, Helmor of Zollaria," Naia
  said, though at mention of Jason her delicate nostrils
  twitched.</p>

  <p>"Did Helmor say that this woman lies as his guest?"
  Kalamita cut into the ensuing pause.</p>

  <p>Helmor turned his eyes upon her. "Aye, priestess of beauty,
  now that you have so faithfully accomplished the task
  entrusted to you."</p>

  <p>"The first step, Helmor," Kalamita dared to correct him,
  advancing close to the foot of the dais. "Naught save that is
  accomplished as yet. And was it not agreed between us that she
  should remain in my charge until after I had met this
  Mouthpiece and spoken with him?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," Helmor admitted somewhat sharply. "But&mdash;since
  you departed upon your mission I have taken thought."</p>

  <p>"And Helmor has thought what?" Kalamita stiffened, drawing
  up her supple, unrestrained figure to its fullest height.</p>

  <p>Helmor's visage darkened. "That were this Mouthpiece as
  clever as he appears, he will not fall into your trap.
  Wherefore, it were best to retain the woman and child he
  values in a strong place."</p>

  <p>"And forsake the meeting on which we were agreed and of
  which I have already sent this Mouthpiece word?" Kalamita
  questioned further.</p>

  <p>"Nay." Helmor smiled. "The meeting shall take place. Said
  you aught in your message, save that she was held by you in a
  place he knew not of, and that he needs must speak with you of
  her ransom?"</p>

  <p>"Does Helmor think Kalamita a fool?" The Zollarian
  adventuress smiled.</p>

  <p>"Nay&mdash;the question were useless, since it was in her
  mind the matter first had shape," said the man on the
  dais.</p>

  <p>"And Helmor, who changed his form, sending Bandhor and his
  guardsmen forth to change into a paltry triumph what had been
  better carried out in secret, nor mentioned until the matter
  were concluded, in the judgment of her who, as Helmor himself
  declares, conceived it first," the woman before him retorted
  and broke off. Her tawny eyes were flashing, the green plumes
  above her upflung head were aquiver, the jeweled shields
  against her rosy bosom rose and fell quickly as she panted
  rather than breathed.</p>

  <p>For a time Helmor regarded her closely before he
  answered.</p>

  <p>"Enough," he said at last. "Much may be forgiven to
  beauty&mdash;and much I forgive to Kalamita. Yet lies there a
  point beyond which Helmor grant's it not to any man or woman
  to question his words. Wherefore give ear, and heed to Helmor.
  This meeting shall take place. Since naught was said of
  Zollaria's part in the woman's capture, wherein falls it out
  any different from what was planned&mdash;save that she lies
  in Berla rather than in another place, under Helmor's
  protection rather than in fair Kalamita's hands?"</p>

  <p>"Helmor does not trust his agent with a thing of so much
  value?" Kalamita flung her challenge full at the emperor of
  her nation, taunting him, daring him, as it seemed, to
  answer.</p>

  <p>And all at once it seemed that Helmor evaded.</p>

  <p>"Nay," he said slowly. "None doubts Kalamita's loyalty to
  the interests of her nation. Yet were it best for her to lie
  doubly safe should Zollaria's demands be refused, or this
  Mouthpiece fail to appear at the meeting she has
  proposed."</p>

  <p>Once more the form of Kalamita stiffened into a haughty
  posture.</p>

  <p>"Refused?" she flared. "Nay, Tamarizia dares not refuse,
  since I shall say to their Mouthpiece that I have taken an
  oath that unless Zollaria's demands are quickly granted I
  shall offer the child in sacrifice to Bel. And by Bel
  himself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Naia of Aphur caught her breath and drew back a pace,
  staring at the woman before her out of widened eyes, as
  innocence may always stare at the incarnation of vice.</p>

  <p>So for a horrified instant she stood, and then, turning to
  Maia, swiftly she seized the child, straining it for a moment
  to her breast, and then extending it on quivering arms,
  uplifted to the man above her.</p>

  <p>"Helmor of Zollaria&mdash;in the name of Zitu!" she
  cried.</p>

  <p>"Hold!" Helmor roared. "Peace, Naia of Aphur. It seems well
  I have decided on your safety."</p>

  <p>He turned to Kalamita. "And it seems clear to me, sister of
  Bandhor, that in this you would serve your aims of vengeance
  as well as your country's ends. Ere this it has come to my
  ears you have cause for anger against this Mouthpiece because
  of a slight placed upon you. And in that it is not my wish to
  in any way obstruct you, save only as toward a glutting of
  your hatred against him, you would lessen Zollaria's chances
  of gain. Yet an oath to Bel is not to be lightly broken.
  And&mdash;should Tamarizia finally refuse to yield in this
  matter or chance a resort to arms against us, we may surely
  need his favor. Wherefore I pledge you the word of Helmor
  that, should those things transpire, I shall place the child
  directly in your hands."</p>

  <p>"Helmor has spoken." With an unholy light in her voluptuous
  face, Kalamita knelt before him.</p>

  <p>Croft writhed in his spirit, at the meaning of Helmor's
  words&mdash;the picture of Jason, Son of Jason, torn from the
  breast against which now he rested all unknowing, and fed into
  Bel's foul body filled with flame. The thing was unthinkable
  to a man or woman of a nation where the gods were no longer
  savage spirits to be appeased by blood and suffering, but
  divinities actuated by mercy and love.</p>

  <p>And, too, a sudden swift regret assailed him that though he
  had known of Kalamita's purpose from the first, he had said
  nothing concerning it to Naia, thinking thereby to save her
  from the consideration of it. For now the horror came upon her
  without warning, and she swayed upon her feet so that Maia put
  out a hand and drew her back against her body in support, and
  Kalamita, noting the action, turned to her from Helmor.</p>

  <p>"What now of that spirit you boasted would not break before
  me, Tamarizian?" she hissed.</p>

  <p>The thing struck Naia of Aphur like a whip and saved her
  from what seemed an impending collapse. She forced up her head
  to meet her tormentor's taunt.</p>

  <p>"As yet it has not broken," she denied. "Rather will
  Zollaria's footmen, her horsemen, her nobles, all that
  strength of which she has boasted in the past, be broken if
  this thing is dared. And think not the blood of a suckling
  will give Bel strength enough to aid you, against the
  vengeance Zitu's Mouthpiece shall send upon you. Zollaria may
  call upon Bel in that day, but&mdash;by Zitu, I swear
  it&mdash;she shall call in vain."</p>

  <p>"Enough," said Helmor. "Guards, let this woman be removed,
  with her child and slave, and kept in a safe place under
  penalty of death to them who watch her, if save by Helmor's
  orders, they be harmed. Kalamita, arise. You will depart to
  the place appointed for this meeting, so soon as we have
  considered together concerning Zollaria's demands."</p>

  <p>Kalamita rose to her feet. Naia's guards led her and Maia
  out.</p>

  <p>Croft went with them. Already he knew in the main what
  Zollaria would ask&mdash;knew in his soul that her demands
  must be refused for Tamarizia's good. There remained then
  naught for him save to support Naia in so far as he could in
  the spirit, and devise some means of freeing her from her
  present position, other than any true consideration of what
  Zollaria might propose.</p>

  <p>And now it appeared to him that the best he could do was to
  bring about delay in whatever negotiations might grow out of
  the situation&mdash;to see them dragged out without a definite
  decision&mdash;to gain time, wherein he might think and
  scheme. Or if there were no other way, seek to perfect some
  such device with which to strike a counter-blow against
  Kalamita's nation as that I had proposed.</p>

  <p>Such thoughts held him, therefore, as he followed out of
  the audience room and along a corridor and down a flight of
  steps to a room deep amid the foundations of the palace into
  which Naia and her maid and child were thrust.</p>

  <p>A little of straw was upon the floor. It was dimly lighted
  by a single oil-lamp in a sconce against one wall. There was a
  copper couch with a none-too-clean sleeping pad upon it, and
  nothing more. With a quick rebellion of the spirit, Croft
  found himself thinking that it was not so Helmor, when a
  prisoner of Tamarizia had been housed.</p>

  <p>Yet he had no fear of Naia's welfare, the measure of her
  endurance, remembering how she had lain in the forests of
  Mazzeria, her fair skin blue so that she might seem one of
  their own women to any Mazzerian prowler, when she had flown
  to his rescue over Atla's walls, during the Mazzerian war.
  Wherefore he waited until Maia had induced her to stretch
  herself upon the couch, and taking the child in her arms had
  crouched beside her on the straw, rocking it gently and
  crooning to it a quaint Tamarizian song. And then as Naia's
  lips moved and he caught her whisper, "Beloved," he
  answered:</p>

  <p>"I am here."</p>

  <p>She sighed, and her body relaxed as its astral tenant stole
  forth.</p>

  <p>"You heard all, beloved?" she questioned as they sat
  together in the weird communion of spirit with spirit that was
  theirs.</p>

  <p>"Aye," Croft told her.</p>

  <p>"Now Zitu help us!" Naia of Aphur cried. "For if my spirit
  be not broken, as I said to that fiend in the form of woman,
  yet it is shaken within me, Jason, because of that little life
  Maia now holds in her arms."</p>

  <p>"Nay&mdash;fear not." Jason drew her to him and told her
  his plan to gain delay while perfecting his other plans. "Azil
  gave not the spirit of our son to us, beloved, to be set free
  in Bel's unclean arms."</p>

  <p>"Zitu grant it." Naia glanced about the barren chamber.
  "Forgive me my weakness, Jason. If delay seems best to you, I
  shall endure it, so you come to me frequently; to tell me of
  all of your progress."</p>

  <p>"Aye." Croft's soul rebelled at the thought of her durance
  in such quarters, though there seemed nothing else for it.
  Still the thing hardened his purpose, drove one more argument
  nail-like into the determination forming in His mind. "Here we
  may meet in safety since Helmor himself denies all access to
  you. And I shall visit earth, beloved, ere I come to thee
  again."</p>

  <p>"Earth?" Naia's glance flamed with quick understanding?</p>

  <p>"Aye." For a moment man and woman looked into one another's
  eyes, sensing those things as yet in the dark womb of the
  future, before Croft concluded his answer with a grim
  assurance. "And when I return, unless our good friend has
  failed in his efforts, strange things shall come once more out
  of Aphur, and even as Naia of Aphur warned them in a prophecy
  of horror, Helmor and Bandhor's shameless sister shall call on
  their impotent god in vain."</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" Naia's astral form lighted with comprehension of
  his meaning. "Now are you Mouthpiece of Zitu again
  wholly."</p>

  <p>Behind them the blue girl of Mazzeria still crooned to the
  child which she was holding in her arms.</p>

  <p>These things Croft told me on the night he kept his promise
  to visit me again. From Berla he went to Himyra first,
  speaking with Gaya and Robur, directing the latter to mobilize
  the workmen who had labored on the airplanes, before the
  Mazzerian war. Croft also visited the motur shops and gave
  command for the immediate inception of work on engines of a
  somewhat more powerful design than any used on Palos
  heretofore.</p>

  <p>Robur accompanied him on his rounds, his lips set, his dark
  eyes flashing as he listened to Croft's directions concerning
  his as yet, to Rob, not fully understood plans, his
  admonitions for the production of a certain quality of cloth,
  the mixing of vast quantities of what was in reality little
  more than a rubberized paint. But at least here was work to
  hand in plenty&mdash;and work that spoke of more work to
  follow, to the Aphurian's mind.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, Croft requested that he see what airplanes
  were already constructed, thoroughly overhauled as part of the
  preparation for Koryphu's mission into the mountains north of
  Cathur. And that part of his intentions he explained.</p>

  <p>"They follow a course of deception already, Rob, and two
  may play at the game. Much must be done ere we attempt a
  rescue, and toward the doing we must needs gain time.
  Wherefore since to the minds of Helmor, and Kalamita it is
  unknown that I am forewarned of their intent to hold Naia in
  Berla, rather than in the place of which by Bathos she sent me
  word, it appears best to me that we make it seem we are
  deceived. These planes shall mount the air from Cathur,
  therefore, and fly above the mountains in advance of Koryphu's
  party, as though seeking for some place of concealment,
  wherein her captives may lie hid. Thus we shall help Kalamita
  play her part to her mind at least, and perchance throw at
  least some dust in Zollaria's eyes."</p>

  <p>Robur nodded. "I sense your plan, Jason," he agreed. "Yet I
  have taken thought that a plane may fall, and that it is the
  secret of the moturs which Zollaria wishes in part to gain.
  How then if disaster comes upon one of your men? Would it not
  in so much weaken Tamarizia's hand?"</p>

  <p>Croft smiled rather grimly. "Aye, Rob. The point were well
  taken, nor has it escaped my mind. To such an end each flier
  must be provided with a device by which his motur may under
  such conditions be destroyed, and with orders to burn his
  machine, escaping thereafter by the aid of the other planes on
  duty with him, or in any way he can."</p>

  <p>Once more Robur nodded.</p>

  <p>"Aye," said he, "you think of all things. And this other
  device toward the forming of which you are preparing?"</p>

  <p>"Nay," Jason replied. "It depends upon my visit to earth,
  after which I hope to give you plans and figures."</p>

  <p>"Zitu grant you be successful," said the Governor of Aphur.
  "You will seek this knowledge when?"</p>

  <p>"Tonight," Jason told him; "after which Scira must be
  visited and the consent of Koryphu to head the party to this
  meeting with Kalamita gained. She will lose small time in
  hastening to it, hoping to add another prisoner to her number,
  despite the fact that Helmor has altered her plans."</p>

  <p>"Aye, and were swift moturs or an airplane to descend upon
  her lodge after Koryphu has reached it, it might be that
  Tamarizia would have a prisoner to exchange with Zollaria
  without a longer waiting," Robur growled, and laid a tense
  hand on the hilt of his sword.</p>

  <p>Croft eyed him for a moment of heavy silence.</p>

  <p>"That, too, have I thought of, Aphur, yet though we match
  craft with craft and violence with violence, if the need
  arises, let none say that Zitu's Mouthpiece counseled the
  violation of an embassy's seeming or used it as a mask to
  another purpose than that to which it sets forth."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;if this Zollarian plans to trick you into her
  hands by such a meeting?" Robur flushed a trifle under the
  implied rebuke of Croft's words.</p>

  <p>"Nay, she will fail," said Jason. "Yet think not, meaning
  to seize me if so it falls out according to her wishes, she
  will come to that place so poorly guarded that an attempt to
  make her captive would result in aught save a clash of arms.
  Wherefore let her fail of her aim and return to Berla the next
  time with empty hands. How stands Zollaria then, save to deal
  direct with Zitra, which shall quibble with her&mdash;neither
  accepting nor refusing, appointing a place perhaps for a more
  representative meeting, while you and I, Rob, labor over our
  designs?"</p>

  <p>"I have talked with Zitra by means of the message tower you
  have placed in Himyra and upon Zitra's walls," Robur replied.
  "Jadgor, my father, stands ready to aid you in whatsoever way
  he can, and the spirit of Lakkon writhes with thoughts of his
  daughter. May I say to them those things with which you have
  made me acquainted?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," Croft assented. "Say also that Naia sends a greeting
  to her father, and that at present she lies safe from harm.
  Come, let us return to the palace since things are now
  arranged."</p>

  <p>Robur nodded. They entered his motur and drove back toward
  the red court, and the residential wing of the Aphurian
  government buildings, side by side, as they had on many
  another occasion when they labored together in Himyra's
  shops.</p>

  <p>And that night it was that Croft made his promised visit to
  me to discover what I had learned concerning the thing on
  which more than anything else Naia's rescue appeared to
  depend.</p>

  <p>I was ready for him. I had not delayed in instituting my
  efforts at gaining the knowledge the use of which I had
  suggested, and I had been fortunate indeed.</p>

  <p>I had found the man I wanted almost at once&mdash;one who
  had served his country well in the chemical arm of the
  service, and was therefore qualified to give me the
  information of which I stood in need. My greatest difficulty
  had been in convincing him that I desired the knowledge for no
  improper use, but in the end I surmounted the task. And that
  night after Jason had roused me to his presence I recited the
  formula to him, and he cried out:</p>

  <p>"Zitu! Murray, the thing can be accomplished! Palos holds
  all that will be required."</p>

  <p>Considering the stage of life on the other planet, that was
  a self-evident fact, but I knew he meant more than that.
  Before the Mazzerian war he had established a laboratory at
  Himyra in which he and Naia had gone more or less fully into
  chemical matters, and I felt he was fully assured concerning
  the things of which he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Good," I said "then you can make it?" His thought waves
  beat back at me in a very passion of conviction. "Yes, and
  we'll carry it to them in something like your earth-born
  blimps&mdash;isn't that what you told me you called them when
  I was here in your institution as a patient?"</p>

  <p>"Blimps&mdash;dirigibles, you mean?" I questioned.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said. "That's what I've been considering making,
  though I haven't told Rob about it yet. They'll be far more
  stable for the purpose than planes."</p>

  <p>"Why, yes," I agreed. "Croft, it's a rather peculiar thing,
  but before the armistice was signed in Europe each side was
  planning to blot out the major cities of the opposing nations
  beneath a fiery rain."</p>

  <p>For that was the thing I had proposed to Jason, and the
  secret for the production of the unquenchable liquid fire
  which could be stored and carried, and sprayed in a rain of
  death upon those against whom it was used, was the thing I had
  gained from Captain Gaylor, formerly connected with the
  department of gas and flame.</p>

  <p>Horrible&mdash;well, yes, but surely subtly suited to
  Croft's needs for use against the nation which, enraged by the
  defeat of its former plans for aggrandizement at the expense
  of the country he served, had struck against the most sacred,
  the highest and holiest interests of his life&mdash;seeking in
  such fashion, rather than by any legitimate method, to finally
  effect their aims&mdash;a nation, a representative of which I
  myself had heard in the spirit at least vow that, unless those
  aims were thereby accomplished, an innocent child should be
  sacrificed to a savage deity by fire.</p>

  <p>Yet because of Kalamita's oath and Helmor's agreement, a
  move to exercise force in her rescue would be equally fatal,
  unless&mdash;well, unless it was a force that could strike
  silently and swiftly&mdash;a force in the nature of a total
  and terrifying surprise. And surely the blimps&mdash;the
  dirigible balloons Croft suggested, equipped with a
  flame-spraying device and plenty of liquid fire, might well
  prove a terrifying, a paralyzing spectacle to even Helmor's
  and Kalamita's eyes. Paralyzing not only to the body, but to
  the brain itself&mdash;warranted to make simple any bargain
  which would preserve themselves and Berla from a blazing rain
  of death.</p>

  <p>His whole astral presence glowed with the intensity of his
  emotions, the deadly determination by which he was stirred.
  For the first time I realized fully how he had won Naia
  against all opposition, and had carried all before him in
  Palos after he gained existence on the planet in the flesh. No
  ordinary mind could stand against such concentrated mental
  force.</p>

  <p>"By Zitu," I cried, "I believe you!" I felt a quiver shake
  me. It was as though already the doom of Helmor's plans and
  Kalamita's vengeance was sealed. "Croft," I questioned, "you
  know the general nature of these blimps?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," He nodded. "But if you have any suggestions,
  Murray&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "Captain Gaylor gave me the general plan in
  describing how the stuff you're going to demonstrate to Helmor
  was to be carried&mdash;as well as a description of the fire
  bombs they meant to carry aboard their planes. You know just
  before the armistice, Jason, there was talk of a new deadlier
  gas. In reality it wasn't gas at all, but this stuff of which
  I've told you. The gas talk was just a mask."</p>

  <p>"Go on&mdash;tell me, Murray," he prompted tensely. "Give
  me all you can to begin with, though if I get stuck I'll be
  back again, of course."</p>

  <p>"Of course," I said, and told him all I knew myself, while
  he drank in my descriptions, storing them in his mind for
  future use, his expression firing now. and then as he pictured
  the creation of the monster envelopes, the suspended cars, the
  motive power by which they should be flown across the Central
  Sea and Mazhur, to hang a sudden embodiment of Tamarizia's
  answer, above Berla, freighted with their deadly stores.</p>

  <p>"Murray," he exclaimed when I had finished, "Naia of Aphur,
  and Jason, Son of Jason, will owe you their salvation."</p>

  <p>I couldn't answer, and I didn't try. I said instead, "The
  thing seems plausible to me, Croft."</p>

  <p>"Plausible," he repeated. "It shall be accomplished. Now,
  Koryphu may start upon his mission, while every shop and forge
  in Himyra roars."</p>

  <p>I asked a question. "By the way, how does the populace
  cotton to this fresh Zollarian move?"</p>

  <p>"They don't know it yet, old fellow." He gave me a glance.
  "You know, Murray, Tamarizia, even yet, isn't earth. There's
  only the wireless between Himyra and Zitra, and a telegraph
  across the Gateway to Scira in Cathur&mdash;but in view of
  what's going to happen in Himyra almost at once&mdash;the
  preparations, I mean&mdash;I think I'll tell them, and suggest
  that in Zitra the masses be informed by Zud&mdash;that
  Zollaria has struck at the Mouthpiece of Zitu in order to
  coerce the nation. It won't do any harm to have the sympathy
  of the populace behind us in this."</p>

  <p>"Nor in Scira," I said, "Cathur hasn't forgotten how nearly
  she was enslaved, I imagine&mdash;or that her fate would have
  been the same as Mazhur's for fifty years, if it had not been
  for the Mouthpiece of Zitu's intervention in hers and
  Tamarizia's behalf. And see here, Croft&mdash;if you've a
  telegraph up there, why don't you send Koryphu a message
  instead of going after him yourself? You've enough to tend to
  in the matter of the blimps without traipsing about."</p>

  <p>He smiled for the first time. "It might do here, but not on
  Palos, Murray. They're great for delegations, personal
  representation&mdash;the old ways. You can't change them all
  at once. But&mdash;it won't do any harm to announce my coming
  or its reason, or that the Mouthpiece of Zitu comes in person
  to the house of Koryphu. That in itself might even serve in
  preparing the mind of Cathur's prince for the proposition I
  shall make him once I arrive. According to Palosian standards,
  Murray, even though it sounds bald for me to say so, such an
  occasion should be an important event in Koryphu's life."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agree and nodded. More and more it impressed me
  that Croft's mind was working again in its normal fashion, now
  he had actually decided on a definite course. "Being honored
  by a visit from the Mouthpiece of Zitu, publicly announced in
  connection with Zollaria's action, ought to impress him
  favorably, I guess. His fellow citizens can scarcely fail to
  draw the connection, and besides it will give him a chance to
  put a spoke in Kalamita's wheel, perhaps&mdash;at least to
  meet the woman who brought disgrace and death upon his brother
  face to face. If he's human, Jason, he'll accept."</p>

  <p>"He's human enough," said Croft. "Murray, I actually feel
  as though I were facing some positive action at last. It's a
  relief. Ever since this thing happened I've been in an even
  worse state than I was after I'd seen Naia first&mdash;and
  before I'd managed to acquire a physical life on Palos. There
  was a barrier between us then that seemed insurmountable, as
  you know, and yet I knew her, the one woman, in all the
  teeming multitudes of feminine spirits I had ever longed to
  know. I&mdash;I knew her&mdash;mine. And now there's another
  barrier between us, scarcely less fatal, though of a different
  kind."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;you overcame the. first, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll overcome the second," he interrupted in a flash. "I
  get your meaning, and I'll do it. Zitu, what did I not
  overcome to reach her in the first place! But I reached her,
  and I'll reach her again."</p>

  <p>I didn't doubt it. Again I felt to its full the driving
  power in the will of Jason Croft. And at last the man was
  aroused&mdash;at last he had become less man, torn and harried
  by the loss of his dearest possessions, than an intelligent
  fighting force. Or so he impressed me as he sat there in the
  astral body, while his physical form lay billions of miles
  beyond us both, in Himyra, at Robur's house.</p>

  <p>"Aye, you'll reach her," I said, and looked him in the
  eyes. "You'll reach her, Croft, and Naia and Jason, Son of
  Jason, will come back to Aphur and to Jason's house."</p>

  <p>"Aye, by Zitu! Murray, your words fire me. I go to make
  them true, and Zitu guard you!"</p>

  <p>He vanished, leaving me to open my bodily eyes.</p>

  <p>Darkness met them. There was naught but the night in the
  room. Yet I had seen Jason's figure plainly while we
  conversed, and I did not doubt he had been able to equally
  perceive mine. What, then, was the answer? Was there no
  darkness to the spirit, even as between Palos and earth
  outside of the atmospheric envelope there was no time? Was the
  riddle held in that? Was there no such thing as darkness;
  concealment to the understanding mind?</p>

  <p>Was it only the objective eye for which light was a
  necessity toward making the truths of creation plain? Was it
  only the physical ear that required the vibration of sound?
  Were time, light, sound, touch, but material things? Was
  rhythm the basic principle of soul existence as expressed In
  mind? Certainly Croft and I conversed as easily by thought
  transference, a variant of astral vibration, as in the body we
  would have used spoken words. What, then? Were life,
  consciousness, rhythm, all, but expressions of a universal
  force&mdash;existing already bridgelike between God's
  far-flung world?</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">VI. &mdash; PREPARING THE PEOPLE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CROFT went not to Himyra, however, as I
  fancied, but to Zitra, after he left me, and the sleeping
  apartment of Zud, taking his stand close to where the high
  priest lay wrapped in slumber on a copper couch.</p>

  <p>"Zud! Zud! Man of Zitu!" he let the call of his spirit
  steal forth. Once in a past time he had taught the high priest
  something of the astral body, finding it necessary to his
  purpose then to convince him of the truth. And he had told him
  that when he should call him in the future he would
  answer.</p>

  <p>"My lord," he muttered. "Aye&mdash;my lord."</p>

  <p>"Spirit of Zud&mdash;come forth!"</p>

  <p>Zud of Zitra's body relaxed. His spirit obeyed. Mistlike it
  hovered above his physical form.</p>

  <p>"My lord," it faltered again.</p>

  <p>"Peace," said Croft. "Ye have answered me, Zud, in such
  wise. Give ear and obey me in the flesh, when dawn comes again
  to the world. I, Mouthpiece, say unto thee this:</p>

  <p>"Word of the abduction of Naia, wife of Jason, and of
  Jason, Son of Jason, shall be noised abroad. Be it said that
  Zollaria, envious of Tamarizia's progress, has seized them and
  borne them into her country, holding them ransom to her
  demands against this nation, under penalty of death to Jason's
  son.</p>

  <p>"Let it be understood. Let Zud himself sponsor the
  announcement, first going to Jadgor's palace and saying to
  Jadgor that Jason, the Mouthpiece of Zitu, gives the word.</p>

  <p>"Say also to Jadgor that Jason requires him to send, from
  the tower on Zitra's walls, word to Mutlos, Governor of
  Cathur, requesting him to see that word is spread in
  Scira&mdash;also that Jason himself shall not come to Scira to
  hold speech with Koryphu, on the matter&mdash;and that he
  notify Scythys' younger son. Let this be done by command of
  Jadgor. The message being received from him in Himyra will be
  forwarded to Scira at once."</p>

  <p>"Aye, Mouthpiece of Zitu," Zud made answer. "Once ere this
  have ye appeared in such guise before me, and I obeyed thee.
  Even so shall I obey you now. These things shall be done."</p>

  <p>"Yet counsel the people to remain calm in the
  announcement," Jason said. "Zitu's Mouthpiece desires no more
  than their sympathy in this."</p>

  <p>"But the woman&mdash;my lord has word of her and the
  infant?" the high priest questioned.</p>

  <p>"Aye," Croft told him. "As Zud knows, I may meet with her
  in the spirit even as with Zud himself."</p>

  <p>"Aye"&mdash;Zud inclined his astral head&mdash;"that Zud no
  longer doubts, since within his knowledge it is proved."</p>

  <p>"Say also to Jadgor that Jason goes to Himyra to labor in
  the flesh with Robur, son of Jadgor," Croft continued. "Now
  return to thy body and finish thy slumbers, man of Zitu. Yet,
  waking, see that in all things my counsel is obeyed."</p>

  <p>"Aye, Zud obeys on waking," the high priest promised.</p>

  <p>"In Zitu's name," said Croft, and with that he left.</p>

  <p>Dawn was breaking over Zitra as he emerged from the pyramid
  and made his way swiftly north.</p>

  <p>Dawn was breaking over Berla when he reached it. It struck
  him through a tiny orifice for ventilation high in the wall,
  and fell in a golden shaft of light across the dungeon in
  which Naia of Aphur prayed to Ga, Mother of Life Eternal, for
  aid.</p>

  <p>Then as she moved and rose from her knees, he called her,
  as always:</p>

  <p>"Beloved."</p>

  <p>Naia of Aphur heard, and smiled. Seating herself beside the
  child, she let the soul of her womanhood steal forth.</p>

  <p>"Jason, Jason," she cried, the flame of life within her
  swiftly glowing with the meaning of his presence, "you come to
  me with the dawn, from whence, my dear one?"</p>

  <p>And Jason Croft answered her simply, "From earth."</p>

  <p>"And?" She stood before him&mdash;searching his soul for
  some hint of those things he had brought within it.
  "Jason&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Croft replied to that appeal in almost cryptic fashion, yet
  knowing she would understand. "True, woman who prays to Ga for
  courage, it is a new dawn for us indeed."</p>

  <p>"Praise Zitu." She wavered toward him. For a moment it was
  as though their two beings blended, lost each itself in the
  other, became one. And then Naia lifted a face exalted by a
  new hope. "Yet not so much for myself do I praise him,
  beloved, as for the little one. Knowledge waited you then when
  you arrived?"</p>

  <p>"Knowledge," said Croft, still holding her to him. "Aye,
  knowledge enough to make Zollaria a waste of scorching bones,
  a burned-out world, if so by I may hold not only thy spirit
  but thy body again in my arms."</p>

  <p>Naia's astral being quivered; she lifted her eyes to the
  fading spot of sunlight. "Then," said she in a whisper of
  understanding, "this dawn on which I lifted my woman's cry to
  Ga is a new dawn for us indeed&mdash;and once more courage
  fills my being. Go, beloved&mdash;hasten that other day which
  shall bring me again to thee. The past sun Kalamita departed
  for, as she hopes, a meeting with you. She and the giant who
  attends her, Gor by name, came, ere she left, to this chamber,
  asking what message I would send to the Mouthpiece of
  Zitu."</p>

  <p>"And Naia of Aphur told her what?" Croft questioned,
  looking into the eyes beneath his.</p>

  <p>"To tell you when she met you that Naia loved both
  Tamarizia and thee."</p>

  <p>"And what said Zollaria's magnet to such a message?" Jason
  asked.</p>

  <p>Naia of Aphur smiled as she answered. "Nay&mdash;she seemed
  not overly well pleased with it. She bade Gor strip my signet
  ring from my finger. Be warned against any message wherein it
  may be used as a seeming proof of word from me."</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Jason, scowling at this fresh proof of
  duplicity in Zollaria's dealing; "such trickery shall gain
  them nothing."</p>

  <p>Naia nodded. "Yet I think I puzzled her somewhat, since I
  myself took the ring from my hand ere Gor could touch me, and
  gave it to him, knowing full well I could explain when next we
  spoke together, and liking not the thought of his hands upon
  me&mdash;or the, touch of any man save only Lakkon and
  thee."</p>

  <p>Croft bent his lips to those below them, thinking even in
  that instant that Kalamita had gained small satisfaction thus
  far in her meetings with Naia of Aphur, and asking himself
  what use the Zollarian siren might mean to make of the
  ring&mdash;a bit of purple stone into which was cut the
  ideographic symbol of Naia's name.</p>

  <p>"Kalamita plays an impossible game," he said, "since,
  thanks to our ability thus to speak together, her moves and
  even her intent is known. Be of good courage, therefore,
  beloved. I go now to Himyra to prepare against the day when in
  truth you shall feel my touch again."</p>

  <p>The waters of the Central Sea were a golden ripple in the
  early sunshine, as he sped back then to Himyra and opened the
  eyes of his body to Robur's wing of the palace and sat up on
  his couch.</p>

  <p>Throughout the next day Jason and Robur passed from one
  place to another, calling the captains, whom Croft himself had
  trained, before them, explaining, issuing their orders,
  bidding them put night shifts to work upon the
  task&mdash;giving here the commands for the forging of copper
  beams and trusses&mdash;there the design for huge tanks in
  which the death-dealing liquid fire would be stored.</p>

  <p>Late in the afternoon, bulletins struck off Jason's presses
  appeared posted on the corners&mdash;flaunting the news of
  Zollaria's latest move before the people's eyes. Those who
  could read gathered about them and translated the message of
  ink and paper to their less erudite fellows. Inside an hour
  Himyra was howling with anger and amaze.</p>

  <p>Leaving the metal foundry, where they had been giving
  orders for the making of the fire-containing tanks, Croft and
  Robur found their motur all but mobbed by a wildly inflamed
  crowd. The caution for a quiet acceptance included in the
  bulletins was temporarily ignored. Naia of Aphur, the beauty
  of the state, was captive. The Mouthpiece of Zitu&mdash;the
  strong man who had twice brought the northern nation's plans
  to disaster&mdash;was robbed of wife and child.</p>

  <p>"To Zollaria! To Berla! Seize and punish! Death to the
  spawn of Zitemku&mdash;the torturers of women and children!"
  the populace howled.</p>

  <p>Corner orators appeared and harangued their fellows, giving
  way as Robur's car approached with the sun flag of Aphur
  flapping above it, to point toward Jason, and shriek that here
  was the Mouthpiece himself.</p>

  <p>Time after time Croft was forced to rise and address the
  seething press of men and women that blocked the thoroughfare,
  begging them to give him passage on an errand connected with
  the safety of Naia and Jason&mdash;counseling a quiet
  demeanor&mdash;asking the sympathy and support of the men of
  Aphur in his endeavors to meet the situation&mdash;suggesting
  that any move of a violent nature would hinder rather than
  help him in the present instance&mdash;promising
  action&mdash;declaring that in order to keep spies from Himyra
  all vessels mounting the Na would be searched by Aphurian
  guardsmen, and that all strangers would be stopped at Himyra's
  walls.</p>

  <p>Time and again Robur rose to stand beside him in the motur.
  "Zitu's Mouthpiece has spoken. Aphur hears and obeys. Give
  way. The Mouthpiece goes to Scira to organize a mission!" he
  roared.</p>

  <p>"To what end?" a strong voice questioned on one such
  occasion. Despite their royal caste, the Tamarizians were a
  democratic nation.</p>

  <p>"To meet an emissary of the northern nation," Robur
  replied.</p>

  <p>"Then let the mission be one of the sword."</p>

  <p>"Nay. Not so says the Mouthpiece of Zitu, who plans already
  a different measure," Aphur's governor answered.</p>

  <p>"Silence. Give ear to the Mouthpiece of Zitu!" yelled the
  crowd. "Make way&mdash;he desires a passage! Make way! He goes
  to Scira."</p>

  <p>The press opened, making a free way. The motur moved
  forward. "They are with you," said Robur, speeding the car
  toward the gates of Himyra according to their plans to visit
  the airplane hangars beyond the walls.</p>

  <p>"Aye." Croft nodded. That quickly up-flaring spontaneous
  anger and rage of Himyra's population acted as a subtle tonic
  to his spirit, set his heart to beating faster, woke a strange
  fire of unfaltering purpose in his eyes.</p>

  <p>At the hangars he explained the situation and called for
  volunteers from among the fliers to cross the Gateway and land
  of Scira, later taking up the deceptive patrol above the
  mountains north of the Cathurian border he had already
  planned.</p>

  <p>They heard him and stepped forward in a body. Not one man
  held back. They pressed close before him with eager faces.
  Again his heart was warmed. He had organized their force. By
  himself and Naia most of them had been trained. Nominally at
  least he was their commander-in-chief. They were the pick of
  Tamarizian manhood&mdash;as eager to dare the venture as
  restrained hounds on a leash.</p>

  <p>He selected a half dozen quickly, telling them they must
  destroy both moturs and planes if disaster overtook them and
  forced a landing on Zollarian terrain, explaining that Robur
  would see them equipped with small grenades by which the
  moturs could be blown to atoms.</p>

  <p>Their faces stiffened a trifle, but they did not
  falter.</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;they shall not have them," they made answer.</p>

  <p>"By Zitu," Jason prompted.</p>

  <p>"By Zitu," they returned.</p>

  <p>Croft saluted them flat-handed. "It is an oath," he said.
  "To break it. were treason to the nation. In four days you
  will descend at Scira. Look to your machines."</p>

  <p>Back in the motur he found his pulses leaping to the spur
  of action and the esprit du corps among the fliers he had
  seen. They were men, men&mdash;their number would furnish him
  others&mdash;to man the blimps and urge them over
  Berla&mdash;if need be, to blot out the Zollarian city beneath
  a fiery rain.</p>

  <p>"Tonight, Rob, I give you many plans and dimensions," he
  told Robur, breaking the silence of his introspection. "That
  done, I board Jadgor's galley for Scira. Till I return, the
  work lies in your hands."</p>

  <p>All Scira was en fte, or seemed so, though there was a
  strange sullenness about her crowds, despite the flags, the
  banners that decked the houses and lined the streets, and flew
  above her blue walls.</p>

  <p>The Mouthpiece of Zitu was coming from Aphur on a mission,
  and the city was adorned to greet him by the orders of Mutlos,
  Governor of Cathur himself. The throngs which waited his
  coming, to welcome him, and escort him to the house of
  Koryphu, where the sun-rayed banner of Aphur hung beside that
  of Cathur in the almost breathless air, wore their brightest
  garments. But his mission forbade holiday spirits in the minds
  of the crowd.</p>

  <p>True, vendors of sweetmeats and light wines in tabur hide
  sacks slung on sinewy, naked shoulders, passed among them,
  jugglers and acrobats performed their tricks and feats of
  strength on mats spread on the pavement. But that was merely
  the seeking of profit on the part of those who plied their
  various trades. It had naught to do with the kidnapping of
  Naia, wife of the Mouthpiece, her carrying into the
  neighboring nation which had twice endeavored to capture the
  northern pillar of the Gateway&mdash;once over fifty years
  before, and again at a more recent date.</p>

  <p>"Wherefore, Koryphu, the man with whom the Mouthpiece would
  lie as guest in Scira, was no longer of unimportance in
  Cathur. Why Koryphu in this hour?" the people asked. And
  possibly Koryphu asked himself as he prepared to welcome his
  guests, "Why the honor of the Mouthpiece of Zitu's presence in
  this time of his bereavement?" When a messenger from Mutlos
  had come and told him of it, he had gasped.</p>

  <p>What was the purpose of the man to whom all Tamarizia
  looked as little less than a demigod in his knowledge, in
  visiting Koryphu, who had pored over tablets and scrolls in a
  semiseclusion ever since the disgrace Kyphallos, son of
  Scythys, now happily dead, had brought upon Cathur's royal
  house?</p>

  <p>Be that as it may, he prepared his residence for the
  occasion and on the day of the expected arrival of Jason Croft
  donned his bravest apparel and waited to welcome his
  guest.</p>

  <p>Yet it was mid-afternoon before Jadgor's galley, bearing
  the standard of Zitra&mdash;the circle and
  cross&mdash;appeared and bore down on Scira's walls.</p>

  <p>The giant sea doors swung open, admitting her to the
  harbor, and closed again when she had passed. Breaking forth
  Cathur's flag, she advanced across the inner harbor and swung
  to a mooring. A band of trumpeters ruffled forth from the
  quay, where Mutlos waited. The gangway was thrust forth, and
  the Mouthpiece of Zitu, walking alone and unattended,
  appeared.</p>

  <p>"Hail, Mouthpiece of Zitu!" the assembled populace
  roared.</p>

  <p>Mutlos advanced. The two men struck hands on shoulders, and
  joined their palms in a moment's clasp. Side by side they
  entered Mutlos's motur. The trumpeters fell in before them,
  breaking a pathway through the crowds.</p>

  <p>So came Jason to Scira once more, somber of mien, yet
  steady-eyed.</p>

  <p>"My sympathy as a man I give thee. Advisor of Tamarizia,"
  Mutlos said as the ear began to move. "My assistance and that
  of Cathur I pledge you when it be needed. This thing passes
  all endurance. Say but the word and Cathur will gather her
  swords."</p>

  <p>"Nay," Jason replied slowly. "Thy sympathy, Cathur, warms
  the heart of the man. But the time of rescue has not arrived.
  Armed interference at present were ill-advised, since Zollaria
  fears it, and should it be attempted, thinks to offer my son
  to Bel a sacrifice."</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" Mutlos gasped. "What then, O Mouthpiece? Where lies
  a chance of rescue? Zollaria makes demands of ransom?"</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;or will. Even now one approaches a rendezvous in
  the mountains north of Cathur to meet with an agent of ours.
  It is because of that I am here."</p>

  <p>"To arrange a mission to this meeting?" Mutlos said with
  ready understanding.</p>

  <p>"Aye. Zollaria sends Kalamita of ill-fame to Cathur as her
  agent. Tamarizia, with the knowledge of Cathur and his own
  consent if it is forthcoming, sends Scythys' son."</p>

  <p>"Now, by Zitu!" Admiration waked in Mutlos's eyes. "'Tis
  well thought of&mdash;to face that tawny enchantress, this
  creature of Adita, by one in whose heart must burn hot hate
  against her. Guardsmen I place at your disposal and his. My
  place lies open to you, and you will honor it with your
  presence&mdash;or plan you to lodge in Koryphu's house?"</p>

  <p>"With Koryphu this night at least," said Jason. "Yet with
  Mutlos things must be discussed ere the mission fares forth.
  Hence at the palace on the night succeeding the sun after
  this, I accept the offer of guardsman gladly. A score will be
  enough."</p>

  <p>"They will be forthcoming," Mutlos promised, and spoke to
  his driver. "To Koryphu's house."</p>

  <p>Up to the door of the lesser palace stalked Jason alone,
  once he had descended from the motur.</p>

  <p>But Koryphu had marked his coming, and the door slid open
  before him.</p>

  <p>"Hail to thee, Tamarizia, in the person of Jason,
  Mouthpiece of Zitu," Koryphu exclaimed and drew back a pace
  before him, that he might enter under the eyes of the watching
  crowd.</p>

  <p>His eyes were a trifle bright with excitement, his features
  a bit flushed with unwonted color at this sudden prominence
  thrust upon him&mdash;wherein the governor's car, with the
  governor in it, set down so distinguished a guest at his
  doors.</p>

  <p>"My lord," he said once the portal was closed, shutting
  them in together after Mutlos had risen in his motur and bowed
  and he had returned the salutation. "My lord!"</p>

  <p>"Greetings to you, Koryphu, son of Scythys," Croft
  responded. "Behold in me not so much anything as a man bereft
  and sorely troubled by his loss&mdash;one who comes to you
  thus in a time of trouble to ask you to lend him aid."</p>

  <p>Koryphu's eyes widened swiftly. "But, by Zitu&mdash;in what
  can one of fallen fortunes aid you, Mouthpiece of Zitu?" he
  questioned in uncertain fashion.</p>

  <p>"It is of that we must speak together, Prince of Cathur,"
  Croft replied.</p>

  <p>"Come then." Koryphu turned and led the way across a court
  done in blue and crystal, surrounded by a balcony of blue and
  white to a room at the farther end&mdash;the same room in
  which Jason at the time of his astral visit to him had seen
  him bending over his tablets and scrolls&mdash;his
  study&mdash;the room in which more than any other Koryphu
  spent his life.</p>

  <p>"Be seated, lord," he invited, indicating a redwood chair
  and taking his place in another drawn close to a table of
  copper, littered with numerous scrolls. "Loss is not unknown
  to Scythys' son, nor the feeling of it. Yet never, praise be
  to Zitu and Azil, has he lost either wife or child. Wherefore,
  only in the mind may he conceive faintly of thy sense of loss,
  and therein share thy grief with thee. Speak&mdash;Koryphu
  lends his ear to thy voice."</p>

  <p>Jason explained&mdash;going at some length into past
  events&mdash;advising the Cathurian of the meeting to be held
  in the mountains, declaring it of vital importance to
  establish negotiations with Zollaria as quickly and protract
  them in indefinite fashion, in his estimation, proffering
  Koryphu the leadership of the first embassy at last.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;Koryphu!" The Cathurian noble stammered, his
  breathing a trifle quickened, his nostrils a trifle tightened.
  "Zitu's Mouthpiece chooses me for such an errand as this?"</p>

  <p>"Aye." Croft inclined his head, watching the man before
  him. "Koryphu the Tamarizian."</p>

  <p>"Tamarizian!" Koryphu repeated and paused and went on again
  in a somewhat bitter fashion. "But why, Koryphu&mdash;why the
  son of a discredited house? Why not another, whose loyalty
  none could question?"</p>

  <p>His eyes narrowed slightly and he clenched a hand.</p>

  <p>Croft looked him full in the face. In it he saw how deeply
  his brother's action had affected this man&mdash;how the loss
  of confidence, the lack of support by the people of Cathur, as
  shown by his overwhelming defeat in the last elections, had
  rankled without expression in his mind. The thing looked back
  at him a smoldering fire from between Koryphu's lids. It had
  quivered in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Because," said he, "who heads this mission, will meet
  Kalamita of Zollaria in the north."</p>

  <p>"Kalamita!" Koryphu stiffened. Suddenly his body stirred,
  he half rose in his chair and sank back, well-nigh gasping.
  "That&mdash;foul sepulcher of dead loves and unholy
  emotions&mdash;that stench in the nostrils of true men, and
  blot on the name of women. Say you she comes herself to this
  meeting?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Jason Croft. "Wherefore, there appears no
  better agent in all Tamarizia to meet her when she comes, to
  trap me also as she hopes, seeing she had bidden me to this
  conference in person, than one who loves her not nor is apt to
  fall captive to her shameless graces&mdash;than Koryphu
  Tamarizian first, and son of Cathur, and loyal in his heart to
  both, as I believe."</p>

  <p>"Thou believest?" Koryphu questioned with an eagerness
  almost pathetic.</p>

  <p>"Aye. Else were I not sitting in his house."</p>

  <p>For a moment silence came down, save for Koryphu's audible
  breathing. For a moment his eyes flamed with a sudden light,
  and then he turned them away since, in the code of Tamarizian
  manhood, there was little room for tears. Then he rose.</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" he broke forth hoarsely and lifted his arms.
  "Father of life&mdash;hast then given ear in such fashion to
  my prayers? Is the time of penance ended? Am I again to step
  forth proudly among men as among my peers? Is it so your
  Mouthpiece brings this labor to me&mdash;placing upon my
  shoulders a task that through it I may prove my love of
  nation, tear to ribbons the garment of sorrow in which I have
  been clothed? If so, I thank thee, Zitu."</p>

  <p>He sank down again, dropping his head upon his folded arms
  on the table.</p>

  <p>For a time Croft watched him, elation and sympathy blended
  in his regard. Here was his agent ready. There was small doubt
  Koryphu would accept the chance to prove he had been misjudged
  as blood brother to Kyphallos. The mere thought of what the
  opportunity offered had left him too deeply moved.</p>

  <p>"Nay, Koryphu," he said presently as the Cathurian kept his
  face hidden while his shoulders heaved. "None questioned thy
  loyalty really. Half thy worry was of your own conceiving. Few
  spake illy of thee. Men deemed rather you had taken for
  comfort to your tablets and scrolls. By Jadgor and Robur of
  Aphur, my choice of thee is approved."</p>

  <p>"Hai! Jadgor&mdash;Robur! Say you so?" Koryphu lifted his
  head. "Perchance, thou art right," he went on more calmly.
  "Perchance I have brooded over much. Yet comes this now as the
  realization of dreams born in nights of brooding, hopes formed
  in sorrow, and well-nigh dead."</p>

  <p>"You accept, then?" Croft questioned.</p>

  <p>"Accept? Aye, by Zitu&mdash;and I shall serve you loyally!
  Speak what you wish, Mouthpiece of Zitu. What do I when I face
  this beauteous slayer of men's souls&mdash;shall I slay her
  for you, watch for opportunity and strike her dead? If so the
  life of Koryphu were a small price&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hilka!" Croft interrupted the man's hysterical outburst.
  "Hold now, Koryphu of Cathur&mdash;Koryphu does naught save
  listen to her words. Think you the death of their agent would
  help us&mdash;or render my dear ones more safe&mdash;or that
  the dead body of Koryphu would bring to Tamarizia more swiftly
  the demands Zollaria will make through her toward those
  negotiations that shall follow. Nay, small danger lies in this
  mission so that rather than inflamed with rage when he stands
  before her, Koryphu appears but one come to return with her
  words."</p>

  <p>"Aye." Koryphu caught his breath quickly. "Yet owe her I a
  debt of overlong standing."</p>

  <p>Croft nodded. "I deny it not. Let Koryphu's vengeance begin
  when she sees me not of Tamarizia's party&mdash;and finds
  herself outplayed."</p>

  <p>"Thinks she the Mouthpiece of Zitu a fool to walk into her
  trap?" Koryphu questioned.</p>

  <p>"She thinks me husband and father, less well informed of
  her true purpose than perchance I am," Croft replied. "It were
  well she be not undeceived. Wherefore I send airplanes north
  before you&mdash;to fly above the mountains as though seeking
  a place of concealment, that she may not know I am aware Naia
  of Aphur lies in Berla, and fancy I think her hidden in the
  mountains as in her message to me she said."</p>

  <p>Koryphu narrowed his eyes in appreciation of what was
  intended. "The thought were well conceived. I do naught then
  save meet this Zollarian and give ear to her terms of
  ransom?"</p>

  <p>"Naught else, save say that those terms will be brought to
  my ears and the ears of the nation."</p>

  <p>"'Tis well," the Cathurian now accepted. "That shall I do,
  and naught to endanger the success of the undertaking, because
  of my personal affairs. When do I depart upon my mission?"</p>

  <p>"Presently," Jason told him. "Mutlos will furnish you a
  score of guardsmen. You will go north after the airplanes have
  arrived."</p>

  <p>"Two alighted before Mutlos's palace this morning," Koryphu
  announced. "They declared to the crowds they came by your
  orders, yet said nothing further. Are there others?"</p>

  <p>"Six in all," said Jason, smiling, well pleased that his
  fliers had lost no time. "Doubtless the others will
  arrive."</p>

  <p>Dusk had fallen as they talked. A Mazzerian major domo with
  lighted lamps appeared and set them in the metal sconces on
  the walls. Koryphu rose.</p>

  <p>"A momentous day in the life of Koryphu," said he, "is
  drawing to a close. Zitu's Mouthpiece will pardon, if he
  withdraws to the presence of his wife to acquaint her with his
  decision and the changed fortune of his house."</p>

  <p>"Aye," Jason assented, well enough pleased to let the man
  carry his news to the ears of his family, and remain with his
  own thoughts for the time. "Carry my greetings to her and say
  I wait her pleasure of a meeting."</p>

  <p>Koryphu appeared slightly embarrassed. "We have lived much
  alone of late, Hupor. You will dine with us or shall I have
  food sent to you?"</p>

  <p>"With you if it suits your convenience," Croft replied,
  forming a vivid picture of the seclusion that held this house
  once second in the state only to that of the king.</p>

  <p>Later he met Pala, a not uncomely woman, though showing the
  effects of that selfsame seclusion in face and manner, and her
  two children, a daughter and a son, and reclined with them at
  their common table&mdash;speaking of general topics with the
  two elders until the meal was done. Once more back in
  Koryphu's study he went into the details of the mission with
  him, finally arranging to go before Mutlos the succeeding
  afternoon. Long before the oil lamps had burned low in their
  sconces the thing was done, and his conversation with Koryphu
  had convinced him that in Naia's suggestion of the former
  prince, the right man had been found.</p>

  <p>Passing from the study to the apartment set aside for his
  slumbers, the two men intercepted Pala, speeding a parting
  guest, and she spoke to her husband.</p>

  <p>"Laira, wife of Gazor&mdash;Koryphu. Thou hast not
  forgotten."</p>

  <p>"Nay." Koryphu bent before the matron in greeting. "Yet it
  is long since I have given her salutation."</p>

  <p>For a moment the face of the caller regarded him almost
  blankly and then she smiled. "Ah, but&mdash;old friends should
  not be forgotten." She glanced at Jason.</p>

  <p>Koryphu made the introduction, and she sank to a knee
  before Zitu's Mouthpiece.</p>

  <p>"Hupor, my obedience to thee. It came to my ear you were
  present in Scira, and somewhat of the reason. Zitu uphold you
  in a troubled hour."</p>

  <p>"And spare them to you," said Jason, bowing.</p>

  <p>And yet when he stretched out on his couch and drew its
  silken coverings about him, the thought came again as it had
  come while he watched Laira rise, that life on Palos or earth
  was very much the same thing, and those with friends were,
  after all, those on whom those in power smiled.</p>

  <p>The next day he spent with Mutlos, arranging for Koryphu's
  departure and explaining his purpose in the airplanes, the
  last of which arrived. The evening passed in meeting many of
  the Cathurian officials, bidden by Mutlos to the occasion and
  a feast at which Koryphu and Pala were among the more
  prominent guests. No secret had been made of his mission. In
  fact, word of it had been given out.</p>

  <p>For the time being Koryphu found himself again a person of
  importance&mdash;one in whom Tamarizia herself had given
  evidence of faith. Watching him under circumstances more or
  less trying to a man of inferior metal, Croft found himself
  pleased by his demeanor&mdash;satisfied that he would see the
  meeting with Kalamita carried off with what it held of
  success.</p>

  <p>Well pleased then, he gave orders that the planes depart in
  the morning, and that later Koryphu and his escort should
  leave for the north. Taking tablets, he wrote rapidly a
  message to Kalamita, setting forth the fact that the bearer
  was his representative in person, and gave it to Koryphu after
  pressing his signet into the waxen surface with instructions
  to place it in her hands.</p>

  <p>It was the last move. In so far as it could serve the
  meeting on which Kalamita counted for far more than it was
  fated to bring her was arranged.</p>

  <p>Stretching himself on the couch in the sumptuous chamber in
  Mutlos's palace, to which he had been led, he freed his
  consciousness from his body and went in search of the woman
  herself, to find her in the midst of a wayside camp of
  Zollarian soldiery, asleep on the pads of her gnuppa drawn
  conveyance, beside which the giant Gor of the galley mounted
  watch.</p>

  <p>Koryphu went north with the dawn, and Kalamita was
  hastening to meet him. Satisfied, he left her in slumberous
  ignorance of his presence and visited Naia, telling her of the
  progress he was making, and how Robur was stoking the furnaces
  of Himyra toward the creation of yet another marvel, in the
  eyes of the population, until they flared red above the red
  walls of the city in the night.</p>

  <p>In the morning he sent Robur a message announcing his
  departure, said farewell to Mutlos and was driven to the quays
  and Jadgor's galley. Going aboard he gave the order for
  sailing. The sea doors were opened. He passed through them,
  and turned the prow of the craft at his disposal swiftly into
  the south.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">VII. &mdash; PTAR, PRIEST OF BEL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">KORYPHU of Cathur, under the banner of
  Tamarizia&mdash;with seven red and white stripes and a blue
  field with seven stars&mdash;a thing designed by Croft himself
  after the republic was established, fared north in a gnuppa
  drawn conveyance with his escort of Cathurian guards.</p>

  <p>Kalamita and Zollaria came down from the north in a similar
  fashion, but with a vastly heavier escort&mdash;strong enough
  as Croft had suggested to Robur to avoid any chance of
  surprise. Croft sailed south, but watched their progress each
  night, when he let his consciousness steal forth. The
  airplanes sailed north and found themselves a landing place as
  best they might, to which, after each day spent above the
  mountains north of Cathur's border, they returned.</p>

  <p>Three days brought Jason to Himyra. Jadgor's galley was
  swift, indeed. Each day he spent in the shops sometimes with
  Robur, sometimes without him, when matters of state
  interfered, drafting designs with ruler and calipers and
  stylus, supervising the makings of patterns, holding
  consultations with his captains over the production of each
  part he desired, calling for speed and more speed.</p>

  <p>It was the thing that obsessed him now that Koryphu was
  going north and Kalamita was coming south&mdash;speed in the
  production of the only thing that seemed to his straining mind
  fitted to meet his desperate need. And a part of each night he
  spent in the laboratory he had fitted up in Robur's own part
  of the palace, experimenting in the blending of reagents, the
  making of the liquid fire.</p>

  <p>In Zitra, in Cathur and in Aphur, Tamarizia roared, and by
  degrees the other states of the nation had the word of the
  last Zollarian outrage and added their voices to the chorus of
  resentment and demand for some retaliatory move. Croft had
  their sympathy and support in his plans of rescue,
  unequivocally expressed.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Robur took what steps he advised to safeguard the
  secret of how that rescue was to be made. Guardsmen
  established a patrol on the banks of the Na, with a port of
  search at its mouth, where all ascending vessels were
  compelled to stop by watchful motor craft. Other guards once
  more went aboard each ship at Himyra's gates, both north and
  south. For the time being the red city came to be an armed
  camp, as closely guarded from entry by unvouched for
  outsiders, as though in a state of siege.</p>

  <p>And his labors ended, each night Croft stretched himself
  out on his couch and closed his physical eyes and maintained
  weird observation of events taking place in the north.</p>

  <p>Three days after his return to Himyra, Kalamita arrived at
  her hunting lodge. Rather the thing was a small palace, built
  of native stone from the mountains and massive beams of
  wood&mdash;its central court fur-lined, its walls and floors
  covered with trophies of the chase&mdash;skins of the woolly
  tabur, which ran wild as well as in domesticated herds. There
  were skins of the ferocious tigerlike beast, such at the
  sculptured group in Jason's mountain home portrayed as
  attacking the man who sought to keep its ravening jaws from
  the body of a kneeling woman.</p>

  <p>And there the Zollarian magnet set herself down with her
  escort camped about her to await the coming of the man she
  hoped would be drawn to her out of the south.</p>

  <p>She sent her guards farther in that direction to meet and
  escort him. Koryphu at the time was still distant some
  halfday's journey, and Jason was assured it would be noon of
  the next day before the Cathuriah appeared.</p>

  <p>Wherefore he spent the succeeding morning in the shops and
  returned at midday to the palace, retiring to his rooms after
  explaining to Robur that he intended being present in the
  spirit at the meeting between Kalamita and the Tamarizian
  agent, even if not in the flesh as the woman desired.</p>

  <p>Robur nodded. "Zitu&mdash;that such things can be. Not that
  I doubt you, Jason, but the matter never ceases to excite my
  wonder. Yet shall I wait with impatience word of what occurs
  when she beholds Koryphu, brother of Kyphallos, in your
  place."</p>

  <p>"She is apt to show displeasure," Jason told him, and he
  was thinking as much&mdash;that the beautiful Zollarian was
  very apt to show marked displeasure, covered perhaps as best
  it might be by a haughty bearing&mdash;as he stretched himself
  out and closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>To the mountains north of Cathur. The Central Sea asparkle
  in the sunlight fled away beneath him. Scira was passed and
  the many weary stretches of winding road over which Koryphu
  had passed until he found him, advancing with the Cathurian
  footmen ringed about him, the Tamarizian flag a glorious
  standard above him, led by the Zollarian guards.</p>

  <p>Swiftly then Jason willed himself into the hunting lodge
  where sat Kalamita, dressed or undressed as one might prefer
  to express it, for the occasion, in a huge chair draped with
  the black and tan hide of some savage creature; Gor, her giant
  attendant by her side.</p>

  <p>Fire&mdash;the fire of delayed purpose burned in her tawny
  eyes&mdash;there was the suppressed litheness of the predatory
  creature already scenting the kill in her every movement, the
  tremor of suppressed emotion in her words.</p>

  <p>"Thou understandest, Gor, that when this one comes before
  me, I shall demand that we speak together alone. And I have
  given word to the guardsmen that his men shall be surrounded
  and at a word from me, after my purpose is accomplished, all
  save one be put to the sword. After a time as we speak
  together I shall simulate anger at some word of his, to the
  speaking of which I shall lead him by taunting speech, and
  then fling thyself upon him and bind him. This is clear?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, mistress, Gor hears and obeys," said Gor, curling
  back his heavy lips.</p>

  <p>Kalamita's breast rose and fell in a deep-caught breath.
  "See to it, then. Let there be no mistake."</p>

  <p>"Nay, mistress&mdash;when has Gor failed thee&mdash;or to
  do thy bidding?"</p>

  <p>"None fail me save once," said Kalamita. "Enough."</p>

  <p>Outside, a trumpet blew a ruffling blast. There followed a
  pause, and then Cathur tricked out in his bravest armor, with
  the twin mountain peaks of Cathur on it done in blue stones,
  appeared in the doorway of the lodge between two Zollarian
  captains, and paused.</p>

  <p>"Cathur for Tamarizia seeks audience with Kalamita," the
  senior captain announced.</p>

  <p>For a moment the face of the woman twitched with some
  sudden emotion and then she replied, gripping the arm of her
  chair till her knuckles whitened. "Let Cathur approach."</p>

  <p>The captains fell back and disappeared. Koryphu advanced. A
  single pace before her he halted.</p>

  <p>"These tablets bring I from Jason, Mouthpiece of Zitu to
  Tamarizia, to Kalamita," he said, and placed Croft's message
  in her hand.</p>

  <p>She held them for a single instant, ere she hurled them to
  the floor. Her lips twitched, hardened, her tawny eyes
  glared.</p>

  <p>Once more, as in Berla, she was faced by an unexpected
  element in her plans. The thing on which she had counted to
  win her country's ends at least&mdash;to glut her own thirst
  for revenge in a measure, was here in the person of the man
  before her, withheld from her outstretched hand. Inwardly she
  raged as any vengeful person may rage when the object of their
  hatred escapes their vengeance&mdash;and doubly because,
  despite her assurance, Helmor had foretold some such ending to
  the meeting she had planned.</p>

  <p>But outwardly she strove for calm. "How are you called, man
  of Cathur, who come to listen to my demands and carry them to
  this strong man, who exerts not himself to come before
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Koryphu, brother of Kyphallos, woman of Zollaria," Koryphu
  replied in a somewhat husky voice.</p>

  <p>Kalamita recoiled. Her body shrank back as from a blow, and
  then she stiffened.</p>

  <p>"Koryphu!" she repeated, staring at him out of widened
  lids. "Now, in Bel's name, what trickery is this that sends
  before me the weakling student brother, at whom Kyphallos
  laughed?"</p>

  <p>"No trickery, Zollaria, lies in it, but rather purpose,"
  Koryphu returned, still more thickly, "in that Jason chose for
  his messenger one who had sufficient knowledge of thee to
  assure his remaining unmoved by your charms, no matter how
  shamelessly employed&mdash;one who would hearken to your
  demands as regarding Naia of Aphur and Jason, Son of Jason,
  yet give no ear to other words."</p>

  <p>Mentally Croft applauded even while physically Kalamita,
  the magnet, gasped.</p>

  <p>"The Mouthpiece were a shrewd man," she said after a
  moment, "yet might he have felt doubly assured in thy choice,
  had he considered thy presence. Kalamita wastes not her wiles
  on aught less than a man. Did he send also to guard thee, the
  things that fly over the mountains the past two days?"</p>

  <p>"Nay," said Koryphu as one who considered his answer. "They
  but seek a place of hiding, since Kalamita said her whose
  terms of ransom I come to bear to him, would lie hidden in the
  mountains until such terms were arranged."</p>

  <p>Kalamita smiled in crafty fashion, with a vulpine widening
  of the crimson slit of her mouth. One would have said she was
  pleased by this information.</p>

  <p>"As he wills," she said more lightly. "I might forbid it,
  but it disturbs me not. He will not find the place, and
  endangers the terms himself, since a part of my demands were
  gained already if one of his devices falls. Even now my
  guardsmen lie in wait for such a happening in the hills, since
  I had conceived his purpose, and foreseen wherein it might be
  turned to my advantage."</p>

  <p>"Nay." Koryphu appeared unmoved by the information. "Let
  your guards beware, since if one of them falls it will be
  destroyed. Does Kalamita desire the secret of them for
  Zollaria or herself?"</p>

  <p>His lips relaxed slightly in an almost taunting fashion as
  he regarded the woman before him out of steady, unwavering
  eyes.</p>

  <p>And again Croft applauded his choice of the man who was
  unveiling the true state of affairs behind the present
  meeting, and yet leaving Zollaria's agent at least in part
  deceived. For his words appeared to flick her and she answered
  quickly:</p>

  <p>"Were it not the same, Kalamita being Zollarian, man of
  Cathur?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, perhaps," Koryphu assented. "If perchance the
  interests be the same. It would seem then that as well as
  Kalamita's price to Jason, I return to Tamarizia with
  Zollaria's demands."</p>

  <p>"And thy shoulders can support so vast a burden,
  Cathur&mdash;these terms I warn you are not light."</p>

  <p>"I await them," Koryphu replied.</p>

  <p>"Then hear Kalamita's price for the pale-faced one and her
  suckling." The woman leaned a trifle forward as she named
  them. "Mazhur must be returned&mdash;the Gateway must be
  opened without let or hindrance. There must be no tax exacted
  over Zollarian traffic on the Central Sea. There must be
  surrendered with men to explain them the secrets of your
  moturs and your air machines, and of all other devices born of
  the Mouthpiece of Zitu's brain&mdash;the fire weapons, the
  balls that burst when thrown amidst an enemy's forces. Name
  these things as the price of ransom to your Mouthpiece when
  you return."</p>

  <p>"These seem heavy terms, indeed." Koryphu threw out his
  hands in a helpless gesture. His face was pale, even though
  Croft in their conversations had foreshadowed some such thing.
  "Were it not wiser for Zollaria to ask less with a chance of
  obtaining somewhat than to overshoot the mark by asking
  everything?"</p>

  <p>"Nay." Kalamita leaned back well pleased as it seemed by
  the man's quite natural confusion on being given a message
  that spelled little less than his country's ruin.</p>

  <p>"Nay, by Bel, Cathur&mdash;once there was a time when thy
  brother's plans and mine went down in confusion when Tamarizia
  demanded and Zollaria yielded. Now Zollaria speaks, and should
  Tamarizia not accept, or make any move to resist her demands
  by force of arms, Naia of Aphur goes to the mines with the
  blue men who labor in them and her puny offspring into Bel's
  mighty arms a paltry sacrifice. So much herself the woman
  understands&mdash;wherefore she sends this ring to Jason to
  plead as her own voice that he hearken to Kalamita's
  words."</p>

  <p>Stripping a signet from her finger, she extended it upon
  her palm.</p>

  <p>Koryphu's features were strained as he took the ring.
  "These things I shall carry to Jason's ears. Does Kalamita
  await his answer?"</p>

  <p>"Nay&mdash;let Jason arrange the next meeting," said
  Kalamita. "I go to a place he knows not of, despite his
  man-made birds and their spying. Yet will a messenger on the
  highway north from Mazhur be met, and his message accepted. So
  I shall arrange. Perhaps if he feel need, he may employ one of
  these self-same flying devices."</p>

  <p>She broke off sharply as a commotion arose outside the
  lodge, then turned to Gor.</p>

  <p>"Go learn the cause of this disturbance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Gor stalked to the door, and paused.</p>

  <p>"Mistress, they come," he declared, and drew back as a
  group of Zollarian guardsmen in charge of a captain entered, a
  man in leathern jacket and helmet held captive in their
  midst.</p>

  <p>With a start Croft recognized one of his own fliers.
  Disaster&mdash;already one of the planes had fallen, he
  thought, and heard the captain confirm his fears.</p>

  <p>The man saluted with upflung arm. "Behold, princess, one
  whom we bring before you&mdash;a Tamarizian dog&mdash;who fell
  with the device he rode like an arrow-pierced bird from the
  skies."</p>

  <p>Kalamita's smile was coldly gloating as she regarded the
  captive, young, slender, grimed by the smirching of his fall
  and the struggle attending his capture, his leathern
  flying-suit torn, and gashed where some Zollarian, overardent,
  had slit it with a spearhead. For a moment she turned her
  regard on Koryphu as if to say here was her prediction already
  verified, and back again to the man.</p>

  <p>"Well, Tamarizian, found you the hiding place you flew in
  search of?" she sneered.</p>

  <p>"Nay." The youth stiffened. "'Tis not always easy,
  Zollarian, to discover the hiding places of Zitemku's agents.
  Nor have we searched over long."</p>

  <p>Kalamita's features hardened. She gave her attention to the
  captain. "What of the machine?"</p>

  <p>"The machine, princess, was by this one destroyed ere we
  could prevent it. It lies burst and ruined by flames."</p>

  <p>"So?" Rage lighted the woman's tawny eyes&mdash;once more
  she was baffled in a purpose. "For that he dies."</p>

  <p>Under his grime and sweat, inside the circle of his helmet,
  the aviator's face went pale, but he maintained his poise of
  body even as Koryphu spoke quickly&mdash;"Princess of
  Zollaria, unsay those words."</p>

  <p>"Peace, brother of Kyphallos." Kalamita turned like a
  tigress on him. "Who are you to interfere? Stand back and
  watch how Zollaria deals with Tamarizian spies. Gor, take thy
  spear."</p>

  <p>Gor's lips curled back as he advanced slightly, lifted his
  heavy weapon and poised it.</p>

  <p>Impotently Croft's spirit writhed as he gazed upon the
  scene&mdash;on Kalamita leaning forward in all her savage
  beauty, her sinuous body panting, her nostrils flared, once
  more gripping the arms of her chair with tightened
  fingers&mdash;at Koryphu, deadly pale because of the
  contemplated outrage, at the figure of Gor, wonderful in its
  sheer brute strength and proportion, set for the thrust on the
  word of command, at the guardsmen, the captain, the figure of
  his flier, drawn up now to its fullest stature, proudly erect
  in the face of death, and knew himself powerless to
  intervene.</p>

  <p>And suddenly the aviator threw up his hand toward the other
  man of his nation. "Hail, Cathur, Aphur salutes thee," his
  voice came strongly. "Long life to Tamarizia. Say to Zitu's
  Mouthpiece that Robur&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Slay!" Kalamita screamed.</p>

  <p>Gor's spear plunged home.</p>

  <p>"Carry off that carrion." The woman's arm rose, pointing at
  the body.</p>

  <p>The captain growled an order. The guardsmen lifted the limp
  form in its suit of leather and bore it out on their
  spears.</p>

  <p>Kalamita swung her whole form lithely about to where
  Koryphu was standing. "Say to Zitu's Mouthpiece that so we
  treat his spies."</p>

  <p>"Aye," he made answer gruffly. "Small doubt but I shall
  narrate to Zitu's Mouthpiece many things."</p>

  <p>For a moment the eyes of man and woman met and plunged
  glances lance-like one into the other, ere there rose again an
  outward commotion, a burst of thunderous sound, which gave way
  in an instant to groans and cries.</p>

  <p>Koryphu stiffened. Kalamita started to her feet, as the
  outcry continued. Some of the flush of anger faded from her
  features, and then Koryphu, turning, ran across the floor
  toward the doorway and outside it.</p>

  <p>"The standard&mdash;the standard of Tamarizia, let it be
  unfurled," he roared.</p>

  <p>Out of the sky came down a drumming from where an airplane
  sailed. On the ground lay some half dozen Zollarian
  guards&mdash;the same who had carried out the aviator's
  body&mdash;some of them without motion, some of them that
  groaned and moved. The vengeance of the flier's fellow had
  been swift and deadly. But the flag of Tamarizia broke out
  over Koryphu's party, the Tamarizian in the plane circling to
  drop another grenade, altered his course, zoomed up above the
  nearest ridge of hills and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Croft quivered in spirit as he watched him., He could
  scarcely censor his hotheaded action in dropping the bomb on
  the murderers of his comrades and yet now&mdash;blood had been
  shed on both sides, and Gor was approaching Koryphu where he
  stood.</p>

  <p>"Go!" he commanded with a gesture of dismissal. "My
  mistress grants you safety since you are of no value save as
  you carry her message. Take thy men and get thee on thy
  mission."</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;be you my messenger to carry her my parting
  greeting," Koryphu returned, and stalked to his carriage,
  about which, under the banner of Tamarizia, his Cathurians had
  already formed.</p>

  <p>Entering it he gave the word for marching. Followed by the
  black looks of the Zollarian soldiery he and his party moved
  off toward the southbound road.</p>

  <p>Bloodshed&mdash;bloodshed on both sides. Croft opened the
  eyes of his physical body in Robur's palace and lay staring
  into the night. Kalamita had slain one of his fliers. The
  man's death thrilled him as he recalled it, even while it
  filled him with sorrow. He had died as a patriot, a man loyal
  to his nation, his last word a wish expressed for that
  nation's long life. And his fellow had retaliated swiftly,
  dropping a bomb from the skies. And now Kalamita was
  returning, no doubt&mdash;returning raging to Berla, cheated
  of the major object of her journey south. And a representative
  of her nation would wait word on the road that ran north from
  Mazhur's borders. He lay pondering the matter until dawn, and
  then rose. He sought Robur and told him of all he had
  seen.</p>

  <p>"Send a message into Cathur, Rob, recalling the airplanes,"
  he directed. "Zitu forbid that I waste further the lives of
  such men. They have served their purpose in a measure. Bid
  them return."</p>

  <p>"And what of the further course of the matter?" Robur
  inquired.</p>

  <p>"Kalamita returns to Berla, in my estimation," said Croft.
  "She must make report. Yet thus far have we dealt with
  Kalamita only. Thus far the matter has lain between herself
  and me alone. It was to me Bathos was sent with his message.
  Wherefore, so quickly as Koryphu returns, we shall ask Zitra
  to send one through Mazhur, calling upon Zollaria to confirm
  or deny Kalamita's acts in a representative parley."</p>

  <p>Robur nodded. "By Zitu, I sense your intention. In such a
  way you safeguard our cousin and gain time for our own
  endeavors."</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Jason, "time in which our work must be pressed
  with speed."</p>

  <p>By day the forges of Himyra roared, and at night they
  blazed. Men toiled and sweated. Croft planned, designed, and
  urged for haste, instructing, advising, passing upon each part
  of the engines of swift deliverance he had ordered made by
  day, by night watching in his own peculiar fashion the
  progress of Koryphu back to Cathur, and that of Kalamita
  north.</p>

  <p>Two days after the meeting in the mountains he sent
  Jadgor's galley to Scira, to await Koryphu's coming and
  returning to Himyra with the Cathurian aboard, deeming it best
  to take the man with him to Zitra to appear before Jadgor in
  person, that his own statements might be confirmed by
  Koryphu's words. Himself he determined to be present astrally
  in Berla, when Kalamita appeared before Helmor to make her
  report. It occurred to him that at such a time something of
  importance might transpire, and he wished to see how the
  Zollarian magnet would seek to cover her defeat.</p>

  <p>That her return empty handed was a bitter thing in her
  heart he was well aware, since his nightly visits to her
  wayside camps showed her cloudy eyed, haughtily exacting,
  acrid tongued to all, even her giant bodyguard. Gnawed by her
  disappointment, she made her way toward Berla in something
  like a baffled rage, reached it and drove straight to her own
  and Bandhor's palace, refreshed herself from her journey and
  loaded herself with jewels, as though thereby seeking by
  outward show to mitigate the manner of her return in Helmor's
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Jason, Mouthpiece of Zitu, and Bandhor watched, the former
  unseen yet seeing, his body stretched seemingly lifeless in
  Himyra, his astral presence alert to her every move and
  action, Bandhor sprawled scowling on a copper and silver
  couch.</p>

  <p>"Helmor was right. This Mouthpiece was too shrewd for you,
  my sister," he sneered.</p>

  <p>"Or else lacking in the courage to meet me," Kalamita
  rejoined, fastening the clasp of an armlet.</p>

  <p>"Nay," Bandhor declared, with the respect of the soldier
  for one of his own profession who had beaten him twice. "He
  lacks not courage, by Bel, or the ability to look even on thy
  beauty unmoved, as you should be aware."</p>

  <p>"Say you so?" Kalamita whirled, stung by his reference to
  Croft's refusal of her favor on a past occasion, and brought
  her hand into stinging contact with his ear.</p>

  <p>Bandhor sprang up, wagging his head, to tower above
  her.</p>

  <p>"You devil&mdash;you yellow-eyed devil!" he roared with
  guttural laughter. "No doubt you are angered, and with
  justice. To have sent Koryphu&mdash;the brother of one who
  fell on his sword for love of thee&mdash;his messenger to you.
  That were a master move."</p>

  <p>Kalamita regarded his amusement out of narrowed amber
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Laugh, fool, an' it pleases you," she said at last,
  coldly. "A master move indeed. What lies behind it?"</p>

  <p>Bandhor frowned. His attention seemed arrested by the
  question.</p>

  <p>"By Bel I know not," he stammered. "Save to learn your
  price of ransom without walking into the trap you laid, and
  thereafter to lay a counter proposal before you."</p>

  <p>"Counter proposal?" And now Kalamita sneered. "Such things
  require time, Bandhor. This one seems in small haste to regain
  a wife and child."</p>

  <p>"Or become prisoner to Kalamita," Bandhor suggested.</p>

  <p>Kalamita eyed him. Her own expression was brooding.</p>

  <p>"Enough," she said. "Your mind reaches not beyond the sweep
  of your sword. Go&mdash;say to Helmor I appear before him,
  and&mdash;say no more, save that I will make all things plain
  when I arrive."</p>

  <p>Bandhor nodded.</p>

  <p>"Nay, and thou canst, thou canst do more than Bandhor," he
  declared, once more frowning, and stalked hugely from the
  room.</p>

  <p>Kalamita remained seated for some time after his departure,
  her features cast into lines of consideration, tight lipped, a
  trifle drawn.</p>

  <p>"Now Bel aid me!" she cried, at last rising and lifting her
  jewel-circled arms in a body-stretching gesture, turned and
  went swiftly down to where Gor waited with her carriage, and
  its prancing green-plumed gnuppas. Entering the conveyance,
  she drew the curtains, and reclined on the padded cushions,
  her tawny head supported on an arm.</p>

  <p>Watching her, Croft sensed that once more her wicked brain
  was busy with its schemes.</p>

  <p>Bandhor met her at the palace and escorted her into a small
  and sumptuously furnished room. Helmor of Zollaria sat there,
  his face contorted into an expression of displeasure. As
  Bandhor and his sister entered, he half rose, and Kalamita
  sank swiftly to her knees.</p>

  <p>"Hail Helmor, emperor and lord," she faltered.</p>

  <p>"Rise," said the Zollarian monarch. "Thy coming was
  expected. Bandhor informed me as you bade him, yet seemed
  unminded to further use his tongue. So, then, you appear
  before me alone?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, Helmor." Kalamita lifted herself on shapely limbs and
  stood with downcast eyes. Suddenly she had adopted a meekness
  wholly out of keeping with her usual demeanor. "Helmor foresaw
  the outcome of my effort in his wisdom All things fell out as
  he advised."</p>

  <p>"The Mouthpiece came not to the meeting?"</p>

  <p>"Nay. Perchance he lacked the courage on which I counted."
  Kalamita threw up her head. Her tawny eyes flashed for a
  single instant.</p>

  <p>Helmor resumed his seat. His brows knit in a frown.</p>

  <p>"I await thy story, sister of Bandhor," he said after a
  time.</p>

  <p>Kalamita explained. Helmor's frown deepened as she
  proceeded with her story. Once and once only his expression
  denoted satisfaction, and that when the woman spoke of the
  airplanes flying above the mountains.</p>

  <p>"It would seem then that he knows not the woman lies in
  Berla," he said, nodding. "It was so I planned. In so much is
  he deceived. Go on&mdash;finish the story."</p>

  <p>"Nay," Kalamita resumed. "There is no more save that I
  stated the requirements of her ransom as it was agreed upon
  between us, and gave Koryphu her signet which I had taken from
  her finger, bidding him say to the Mouthpiece that she bade
  him yield, and that one of the flying devices falling, and the
  Tamarizian within it, being captured, though not before he had
  destroyed it, was slain by my orders before Koryphu's
  eyes."</p>

  <p>"Slain?" repeated Helmor sharply. "Now, by Bel, were it
  wise to slay him, or didst let thy judgment be consumed by
  rage?"</p>

  <p>"Perchance," Kalamita admitted, still adhering to her role
  of meekness. "Yet if so, the act was avenged and quickly, in
  that one of his fellows flew above my lodge and dropped a
  fire-ball, which, bursting, slew two in the number of my
  guard&mdash;and would have repeated the attack upon us, save
  that Koryphu himself bade the flag of Tamarizia unfurled above
  his party, whereat the flier altered his course and
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Helmor of Zollaria&mdash;blood has been shed by Tamarizia
  in this matter. Did not Helmor vow that such an act by the
  southern nation should give Bel the child of the Mouthpiece, a
  living sacrifice?" And now as she broke off she looked full
  into Helmor's widening eyes.</p>

  <p>Croft's listening spirit quivered, sensing the dark turn in
  the woman's mind, the deadly purpose of her plans. Tensely he
  waited while man and woman confronted one another, his soul
  torn with the strain of the delay that preceded Helmor's
  words.</p>

  <p>And then the Zollarian monarch gathered himself together,
  controlling what had plainly been no less that a swift shock
  of surprise. "Aye, so Helmor promised," he returned slowly.
  "Yet meant he not the act of a man enraged by the death of his
  fellow&mdash;a minor instance&mdash;a matter of no consequence
  along the border. Sister of Bandhor, you appear over quick to
  destroy what were a safeguard as well as a price of advantage
  in Helmor's eyes."</p>

  <p>Once more Kalamita lowered her face.</p>

  <p>"There were no advantage to Helmor or the nation," she said
  slowly, "save by favor of the gods. If Kalamita err, be it
  upon her own head, yet thus far the matter had not gone overly
  to our liking&mdash;and were Bel's favor purchased&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Enough!" All at once Helmor roared. "Question not Bel's
  favor. Has he not placed these two wholly in our power? Is the
  way not paved for parley and negotiation? Think you the man
  who waits on the road out of Mazhur will fail to receive an
  answer to our demands?"</p>

  <p>"Nay," said Kalamita, "there will be an answer. Yet now is
  it in my heart to warn Helmor against permitting that these
  parleys&mdash;these discussions of our demands&mdash;be
  entered into over long."</p>

  <p>"What mean you?" Helmor's demeanor was uneasy. "Were time
  not needful when a matter of so great importance is to be
  arranged?"</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;none may deny it." Kalamita granted the point
  without hesitation. "And I know not wherein lies the peril
  save that these be a crafty people, depending more upon their
  wits than on their strength, and that this Aphurian woman
  boasted to me aboard my galley that the one who devised these
  things, the secret of which we are demanding, might well
  devise a greater. Wherefore let Helmor be warned against
  protracting his parlay to great length."</p>

  <p>And now once more Croft's spirit quivered. Let Zollaria
  depend on the power of might as much as she pleased, this
  tawny woman, standing before Zollaria's ruler with
  hypocritically downcast eyes, was possessed of craft at least.
  Again he waited while Helmor weighed her words, until with
  surprise and a vast relief he beheld the emperor's expression
  alter, grow from one of startled speculation to a thing
  amused.</p>

  <p>"A greater device?" he questioned. "Now, by Bel, what were
  it? Has he not brought his fire weapons, his fire chariots
  across the earth, his fire ships to swarm upon the water, his
  flying devices into the skies? Where else shall he turn for a
  new field to conquer? Earth, water, air&mdash;their mastery is
  his&mdash;and will remain his only unless Zollaria wrests it
  from him.</p>

  <p>"These airplanes, as he calls them, are our greatest
  menace&mdash;and now they fly above the mountains, seeking her
  who lies safe inside Berla's walls. Nay, sister of Bandhor,
  thy work is finished&mdash;leave what remains to be
  accomplished in Helmor's hands, nor heed the words of a woman.
  Perchance she meant to raise up a fear thought to affright
  thee."</p>

  <p>Kalamita stiffened.</p>

  <p>"Kalamita is not easily affrighted," she made answer. "And
  being woman, may sense the meaning of a woman's words. Yet has
  Helmor spoken. May Kalamita retire now that her mission is
  ended, less happily than she wished, yet ended none the
  less?"</p>

  <p>"Aye." Helmor inclined his head. "Ere the sun sinks I shall
  send to your palace a chariot filled with silver. Bandhor
  remain. I would speak with you briefly."</p>

  <p>"Bel strengthen Helmor's mind." To Croft it seemed almost
  as though a hidden meaning lurked in the woman's words as she
  sank again to her knees, rose and passed from the room.</p>

  <p>He followed. Let Bandhor and Helmor talk, plan, plot,
  devise. There lurked not the danger he feared, but rather in
  the brain of the woman now making her way toward the carriage
  across the palace court. Seemingly she had taken her
  dismissal, had yielded to Helmor's decision. Meekness had
  characterized her most surprisingly throughout the major part
  of the conversation. Yet Croft did not believe she had given
  over her more personal designs.</p>

  <p>Little by little he was coming more and more to understand
  the woman, and to realize that in all her sordid standard of
  existence there lurked one sincere if superstitious strain.
  She believed in the power of her gods. She had been thwarted
  in her purpose to honor the greatest of them, by Helmor's
  resolve to hold Naia and Jason in safety, but with the quick
  perception of the spirit, Croft felt assured she would try
  again.</p>

  <p>Hence it was with no surprise as she entered her carriage
  that he heard her direct Gor to the Temple of Bel, before she
  reclined upon the cushions and drew a gasping breath.</p>

  <p>And he followed close behind her as she reclined upon the
  cushions and drew to the pyramidal temple itself.</p>

  <p>It was built of some dark-hued stone, in color nearly
  black, set down in the exact center of a mighty open space.
  Pillared it was on four sides, about a mighty central court,
  like a great rectangular funnel, the sides of which were
  corrugated with steps, leading down once more to the outer
  level of the mighty base. These steps could furnish a
  multitude with seats, as he saw at a glance. And in the center
  of the remaining level&mdash;huge&mdash;massive&mdash;smoke
  and fire darkened&mdash;horrible in its grinning visage, its
  potbellied furnace back of extended arms, the idol of Bel
  found place.</p>

  <p>At the head of the inner steps on the side from which she
  had entered, Kalamita paused. So vast was the structure that
  standing so alone in her supple beauty, her figure became a
  pigmy thing, was suddenly dwarfed. Her arms rose above her
  head. She bent once, twice, thrice from the hips in salutation
  to the monstrous thing before her, its every detail thrown
  into revolting relief by the light of the open sides above its
  uncovered court, turned and made her way among the pillars of
  the surrounding colonnade toward the end opposite that the
  idol faced.</p>

  <p>It was built in, unlike the other three sides, and here
  Jason fancied as he followed, would be the quarters of the
  temple attendants and the priests.</p>

  <p>Upon a door of silver, set in the ebon surface of the wall,
  Kalamita hammered with peremptory fist, and waited, until the
  portal was swung ajar by a heavymuscled individual clad in no
  more than a leathern apron tied about his waist.</p>

  <p>"Go," she directed, stepping past him. "Say to Ptah that
  the Princess of Adita desires speech with him at once."</p>

  <p>"Aye, beautiful one."</p>

  <p>The man saluted and hastened off along a passage, to return
  and beckon her after him mutely until he paused before a
  second silver door.</p>

  <p>He struck upon it. A voice rumbled from beyond it. The man
  set it open and Kalamita passed it into the presence of Bel's
  priest.</p>

  <p>Huge he was, powerful, heavy muscled, thick of neck and
  nose and lip, with a knotted, shaven poll, gross, in seeming
  an unwieldy human beast, as dissimilar to the lithe beauty as
  day to night. Yet she spread her rosy, gem-banded arms and
  sank down with lowered eyes.</p>

  <p>"Hail to Ptah, priest of the Mighty One," she spoke in
  salutation.</p>

  <p>"Rise, Priestess of Adita," said Ptah, his small eyes
  nearly lost behind the heavy lids lighting at sight of her
  kneeling figure. "What seeks the Lamp of Pleasure in the house
  of Ptah?"</p>

  <p>"Counsel, O Wise One," Kalimita answered, rising, and went
  swiftly on to explain concerning her vow to Bel in regard to
  Naia of Aphur's child.</p>

  <p>"So?" Ptah pursed his heavy lips at the end; "Helmor is
  headstrong nor listens as closely as his fathers to the voices
  of the gods. In this case hardly could even I defy him,
  Priestess of Joy."</p>

  <p>"Not Bel's priest?" his caller questioned in a tone of
  unbelief, and broke off sharply and went on again quickly. "Am
  I in this then to stand forsworn? And think you what may
  depend upon it. Does Bel take a promise lightly&mdash;and were
  his favor purchased&mdash;" Once more she paused.</p>

  <p>Ptah frowned.</p>

  <p>"True," he said at last. "Few are brought to the temple,
  since there are fewer wars&mdash;and those in the greater part
  are children of slaves. It may be&mdash;woman of
  Adita&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"An augury&mdash;an augury, Ptah." Kalamita leaned a trifle
  toward him. "An augury to foretell how this matter tends. I
  dare thee to put it to the test&mdash;to gaze on the living
  expression of Bel's pleasure&mdash;to harken to the Strong
  One's choice."</p>

  <p>"Hah!" Ptah stiffened. Once more he pursed his lips, and
  then rising, he took up a metal hammer and struck with it upon
  a gong which Croft now perceived to be let into the substance
  of the door.</p>

  <p>Casting the hammer aside he waited until the man with the
  leathern apron appeared.</p>

  <p>"Go," he commanded then; "fetch me a suckling tabur and the
  knife of augury from the hall of sacrifice where it is
  stored."</p>

  <p>Returning to his seat he waited, his eyes never shifting
  from the shape of the woman before him until the man
  reappeared bearing the little creature he had named, and a
  massive knife of copper with a weighted blade.</p>

  <p>Rising, he received both and held them until the attendant
  had disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Bel&mdash;thou Strong One&mdash;show us thy pleasure
  in the matter before the nation and in the case of Naia of
  Aphur's suckling. Speak to us through the life of this
  creature I, Ptah, am about to sacrifice to thee," his heavy
  voice rumbled.</p>

  <p>Seizing the tabur by the hind legs, he poised the copper
  blade, and with one muscular sweep of his mighty arm, struck
  off his head, and laid the carcass down.</p>

  <p>"Let me, O Ptah!" cried Kalamita, seizing the reeking knife
  from the hands of the priest and kneeling to slit open the
  quivering belly of the tabur, so that the entrails were
  exposed. Plunging her pink-nailed hands into the quivering
  mass, she wrenched them forth and spread them writhing on the
  blood-stained floor.</p>

  <p>Ptah bent above them, marking the fall of them closely, The
  woman still knelt before him, watching his every change of
  expression out of questioning eyes, holding forth toward him,
  palm upward, her crimson-dripping hands.</p>

  <p>For a time while Croft sickened both at the sight of the
  uncouth male and the physically lovely woman&mdash;the
  spectacle of beauty and the beast sunk in the unclean orgy of
  a filthy rite, and at the decision resting upon it. Ptah said
  nothing, and after a time he straightened and lifted his hands
  toward the ceiling. "Bel, I, Ptah, thy servant, hear thee," he
  intoned hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"An augury&mdash;an augury!" Kalamita panted. "What says
  the Strong One? Speak, Ptah, that I as well may know his
  pleasure."</p>

  <p>Ptah lowered his back-tilted head. "Naught but the child
  may prevail to save Zollaria in this, matter," he made
  somewhat cryptic answer after the manner of his calling.</p>

  <p>But Kalamita sprang up, her red lips parted, her nostrils
  flaring&mdash;a light of unholy satisfaction in her eyes.
  "Then," she began, her tone tensely vibrant&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Nay." Ptah raised a hand. "It lies with Helmor. Him must
  you persuade to give ear to Bel's decision."</p>

  <p>"Or"&mdash;she bent toward him, laying her blood-dabbled
  hands against his mighty torso&mdash;"were the child brought
  into the temple&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hah!" Ptah's eyes fired. "Bel himself has spoken to thee
  also, Priestess of Adita. Were the child within this temple
  none, not even Helmor, would have the power to regain him, and
  were Helmor to know a third defeat, one more bidable to the
  gods might mount the throne."</p>

  <p>For a moment there was silence, and then Kalamita said
  slowly, "An' he listens not to Bel's message, perchance the
  Strong One will show me a way to gain our ends."</p>

  <p>Ptah nodded. "Perchance, Priestess."</p>

  <p>A glance of understanding passed between them, and Kalimita
  moved toward the door.</p>

  <p>"Enough&mdash;enough!" Croft flashed the signal upward, as
  Kalamita's screams rent the air.</p><a id="pic3"

  <p>"Be prepared to act quickly should such time arrive," she
  prompted, and was gone.</p>

  <p>False&mdash;utterly false&mdash;to her womanhood, to her
  nation, Zollaria's magnet would plot even treason if thereby
  she fancied she could serve her ends. The realization burst on
  Croft with a force little short of appalling. Filled with an
  intolerable sense of loathing, he followed her back to
  Bandhor's palace, and then returned to Himyra, he opened the
  eyes of his physical form, and groaned. Sunlight fell into his
  chamber.</p>

  <p>A semi-tropic warmth was all about him, and yet, all at
  once he shivered as with cold.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">VIII. &mdash; THE DREAM OF HELMOR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">KALAMITA and Ptah. He knew not wholly what
  they plotted, what plans might lie in their brains.</p>

  <p>Yet whatever they might intend certain it was that the
  death of Jason, son of Jason, was included in the plan. And
  whatever that plan might be, Croft was assured that the priest
  had taken time to weigh many matters while he bent above the
  entrails of the tabur suckling, before he had given voice to
  his none too explicit interpretation of their meaning.</p>

  <p>Kalamita&mdash;beautiful toy of the Zollarian court, and
  Ptah, priest of the nation's god. And when had there been a
  time or age wherein the lure of woman, the craft of priest,
  had failed to largely determine the setting of the stage, when
  both had not been involved in plot and counterplot? He
  shivered again and sprang up.</p>

  <p>Helmor alone, it would seem, stood now between Jason and
  destruction. And in that stand Helmor must be encouraged. He
  must be doubly warned that harm to the child meant nothing
  less than destruction to himself, the overthrow of his house.
  Such word might be sent him by the messenger who would carry
  an answer north to the borders of Mazhur. Yet before he could
  be sent some time must needs transpire, and, in the meantime,
  suddenly a thought seemed given birth in full form in Jason
  Croft's brain.</p>

  <p>Like another experienced long before when as a spirit he
  battled to find a way to reach a physical union with Naia the
  one woman for whom his spirit hungered, it fired him with its
  potent meaning, set a light of deep-formed purpose in his
  eyes. Helmor of Zollaria could be warned&mdash;and warned in
  such fashion that one of his nature could scarcely fail to
  give heed&mdash;or so Croft believed. Meanwhile his own work
  waited, work which in view of his latest knowledge more than
  ever demanded speed.</p>

  <p>He left the palace, entered his motur, parked now always in
  the red court in readiness for his demands, and drove swiftly
  to the shops, attended to such matters as demanded his
  immediate attention, and went on to the place where, when once
  the blimps were ready the hydrogen to inflate them would be
  formed.</p>

  <p>From there he passed swiftly to a monster warehouse,
  formerly filled with the merchandise of many galleys dragged
  up by harnessed canors from the quays along the yellow Na
  through tunnels, but now converted to his purpose&mdash;a hive
  of industry where dozens of men and maidens were busily
  engaged in varnishing a most amazing extent of cloth.</p>

  <p>And that night as he labored in the laboratory he called
  Robur and Gaya to him and explained to their ready ears those
  things he had heard and seen.</p>

  <p>At the end Gaya's soft eyes were wide with sympathetic
  sorrow, and Robur's square lower jaw was clamped hard. As
  Croft paused he broke into exclamation:</p>

  <p>"Now, by Zitu, Ptah was right. Naught but the child of
  Jason can save his unclean nation indeed&mdash;and should harm
  come on him Zitemku will have a foul pit full of Zollarian
  souls."</p>

  <p>Croft eyed him, his heart warmed by Robur's ever ready
  upflaring of spirit. But in the end he shook his head. "Aye,
  if he be harmed. But it were an empty revenge after all, my
  friend, and one which might not bring him again to my
  house."</p>

  <p>Robur nodded. "What then does Jason propose? Many suns must
  pass ere we are ready to attempt the rescue, and meanwhile
  Kalamita plans."</p>

  <p>"To warn Helmor of her planning," Croft told him and
  watched him widen his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Warn him? In what fashion may Helmor be warned in
  time&mdash;even were he minded to give ear to any word out of
  Tamarizia? Jason, you speak in riddles."</p>

  <p>Croft nodded. "Nay&mdash;Helmor would pay little heed to
  Tamarizian words, but were he to dream&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dream&mdash;" All at once Gaya caught her breath. Her
  glance met Croft's in a subtle understanding. "Jason, thou
  meanest&mdash;thou canst induce a dream in his brain?"</p>

  <p>"Aye." For the second time Croft nodded, well pleased at
  her intuitive understanding. "Why not? Gaya knows how in the
  spirit I called Naia of Aphur's spirit to me, before our
  marriage, and that nightly now we speak so together concerning
  our love and this present thing; also that I speak so to Zud
  of Zitra when the need arises, having taught him to answer the
  call of my spirit. Wherefore, may I not visit Helmor in the
  spiritual presence and by the same force inspire a vision of
  his and Zolliaria's danger in his mind?"</p>

  <p>For that was the thought that had come to him on waking
  after his return from Berla&mdash;the conception of the manner
  in which Helmor might be warned and fresh caution inspired in
  his guarding of Naia of Aphur and Jason, son of Jason, and
  even Helmor's self against the perils involved in Kalamita's
  schemes.</p>

  <p>"By Zitu!" Robur mumbled again.</p>

  <p>But Gaya sat brooding the thought for a moment longer,
  presently lifting her head to murmur, "Three times. Let the
  dream be repeated once and yet again, Jason, until it takes
  possession of him wholly, nor is absent from his thoughts at
  any time."</p>

  <p>Croft started slightly. He had only considered the one
  inspired dream of warning, but now, he realized swiftly the
  value of Gaya's words&mdash;the weight attached to the
  repetition of a dream. Her suggestion demanded acceptance.
  "Aye, Gaya," he assented. "Ga speaks through you to the
  benefit of child and mother. The dream shall be repeated three
  times, on as many nights&mdash;until Helmor is convinced of an
  agency behind it, even though the nature of that agency he
  fails to suspect."</p>

  <p>Robur rose. His manner was restless.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he whirled around.</p>

  <p>"You can do this thing?" he questioned. "Is naught
  forbidden to you, my friend? You can enter the mind of another
  and order the shape of the pictures in his brain?"</p>

  <p>Jason eyed him for a moment before he answered. "Naught is
  forbidden to the seeker after knowledge, Rob, so he see not
  from evil purpose or for merely selfish gain. All life is a
  rhythm&mdash;even as the sound of the harp given off from a
  vibrating string. And if I alter the rhythm of Helmor's mind
  to the preserving of the life of my child, the honor of his
  mother, the estate of himself, and the lives of his people,
  were the action vain?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, it were a work of justice and mercy," exclaimed Gaya
  before Robur found words in which to respond.</p>

  <p>Croft lifted a tiny vial and held it toward both man and
  woman. "Behold!" he cried sharply. "Fix your eyes upon
  it."</p>

  <p>Arrested by his sudden words and manner, they complied, and
  in an instant for them the room faded, gave place to another
  scene. A straw covered dungeon appeared&mdash;a dungeon with
  every detail of which Croft was familiar in his spirit&mdash;a
  woman, a blue girl of Mazzer&mdash;a child. Briefly Robur of
  Aphur and Gaya his wife beheld that picture and knew it for
  the room beneath Helmor's palace&mdash;and then the whole
  thing faded and once more they were gazing at a tiny vial in
  the Mouthpiece of Zitu's hands.</p>

  <p>It was no more than an example of mass hypnotism as
  practiced for ages by the Hindu fakers, a trick learned by
  Croft while still as a man of earth he had lived and studied
  in India for several years, but to the two Tamarizians it was
  altogether strange.</p>

  <p>"Zitu! Zitu!" Robur gasped, while his wife sat staring no
  longer at the vial but into Jason's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Think you that you have been to Berla?" he questioned,
  smiling slightly. "Nay, my good friends, the thing was but a
  changing of the rhythm of your minds into sympathy with mine;
  but a picture never absent from my thought, which I excited in
  your brains. Think you now that I may make Helmor behold a
  vision?"</p>

  <p>"Aye." Robur's tone was thick. "Aye, Jason, thou man unlike
  any other."</p>

  <p>"Aye, Helmor shall dream," Gaya echoed his assurance. She
  smiled, and her smile was strange.</p>

  <p>Yet no more strange than the hour passed by Jason,
  Mouthpiece of Zitu, before he stretched his body on its couch
  of copper, in the formulation of a dream&mdash;the careful
  marshaling of the various thought forms he meant of deliberate
  purpose to instill into Helmor's brain.</p>

  <p>Only when their sequence was wholly to his satisfaction did
  he relax his body, his physical mind, will his astral form
  swiftly to Helmor's palace and into Helmor's room.</p>

  <p>A vast apartment it was, draped in saffron hangings,
  lighted by small lamps to a dusky twilight, in which blue
  maids, slaves of the palace kept up a ceaseless waving of
  noiseless fans above the silver couch on which the emperor
  slept.</p>

  <p>Unseen, unnoted any more than the trailing smoke of one of
  the low-burning lamps he drifted to Helmor's luxurious bed and
  began hurling his thought force upon him, seeking thereby to
  awaken a sympathetic vibration inside his heavy head.</p>

  <p>Over and over he drew the mental pictures he had formed,
  concentrating all his power on them&mdash;Helmor defeated in
  every purpose&mdash;Kalamita and Ptah as
  coplotters&mdash;Helmor about to be dethroned&mdash;the child
  sacrificed to Bel&mdash;and Tamarizia resorting for vengeance
  to the sword&mdash;the Zollarian armies once more beaten into,
  a bleeding rabble&mdash;fleeing&mdash;leaving their own
  defenseless monarch to face the future alone&mdash;Kalamita
  haughty and sneering&mdash;her mask of meekness cast
  aside&mdash;showing at last as the one by whom these things
  had been brought to pass.</p>

  <p>And suddenly the lips of Zollaria's monarch moved. He
  muttered in his slumber, "Lost&mdash;all is
  lost&mdash;defeat&mdash;dishonor." For a moment while the
  slave girls eyed one another without stilling the sweep of
  their fans there was silence, and then Helmor groaned.</p>

  <p>He stirred, he knotted the fingers of a heavy hand.
  "Thou&mdash;thou treacherous one," he muttered. "Through thee
  Helmor stands undone." Croft thrilled. The things was
  succeeding. In his mind Kalamita answered. "Aye, Helmor,
  through me, these things have transpired to my ends. Defeat
  have I brought upon you. Tamarizia would have held back the
  sword, had you possessed the child to place safely in her
  hands."</p>

  <p>And then suddenly, as though to point the moral, appeared
  Naia, clasping the form of the infant the tawny siren had
  announced as slain, lifting it toward Helmor in suppliant
  fashion, even as in the flesh she had held it to him once. And
  she spoke sinking upon her knees. "Take him and give him back
  to his father, O Helmor, and all will be well with thee
  again." And Helmor, seizing the infant, lifted it toward the
  skies and&mdash;Kalamita screamed, covering her face, and
  turned to stagger out of his presence, while a multitude of
  voices sounded, crying, "Hail to Helmor, saviour of his
  nation! Hail to Helmor the Wise!"</p>

  <p>Whereat Helmor surged suddenly up in his bed, and sat
  blinking in the half dusk of his chamber, from one to another
  of his attendant slaves.</p>

  <p>So for a moment he sat, and then, throwing off his
  coverings, he rose.</p>

  <p>"Go," he directed in a voice that quivered with the emotion
  of his vision. "Rouse Gazar and say to him that I have
  dreamed, and require his presence."</p>

  <p>And on the instant one of the slave-girls dropped her fans
  and ran lithely from the room, leaving Helmor to sink back to
  a sitting posture on the couch, his heavy hands clasping his
  naked knees, his expression a thing of brooding,
  introspection, excited by his dream.</p>

  <p>So he remained until a man entered the apartment and
  advanced toward him shuffling across the rug-littered tiles of
  the floor.</p>

  <p>Old he was, bent, with no more than a fringe of ragged
  silver about an otherwise bald poll. Reaching the emperor's
  couch, he paused and bowed before him, in little more than an
  accentuation of his already stooping posture.</p>

  <p>"Helmor of Zollaria calls," he quavered, "and Gazar,
  servant of Helmor, appears. Speak to me the things thou hast
  seen in a vision, O Helmor, that I may make plain their
  meaning to your ears."</p>

  <p>Helmor dismissed the remaining slave-girls and complied.
  Oddly enough Croft had an opportunity to test the success of
  his endeavor at first hand, as Helmor recited each detail of
  his dream, and Gazar listened, nodding his head less in silent
  accentuation of the several points than because of some form
  of palsy that continually shook him; watching his patron with
  dark and observant eyes.</p>

  <p>He spoke only when Helmor had paused. "Thou didst lift the
  infant in thy arms, and Kalamita fled from before thee,
  shrieking?"</p>

  <p>"Aye." Helmor inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"In which is the meaning plain," said Gazar. "Let Helmor
  watch closely this woman, sister to him who captains all
  Zollaria's army&mdash;and let him guard closely the child of
  the Tamarizian Mouthpiece lest harm come upon it through her,
  who hating the father because of a personal slight put upon
  her in the past, thirsts now for an act of revenge."</p>

  <p>Helmor nodded. "Gazar's words seem words of wisdom," he
  rejoined, narrowing his eyes, and recalling as Croft fancied,
  Kalamita's scarcely veiled displeasure at his work on the
  means by which the eventual rescue of his loved ones was to be
  brought about. A vast elation, a reborn confidence thrilled
  him as he sought another room in the palace&mdash;no sumptuous
  apartment this time where sleepless attendants watched above a
  master's slumbers, but a deep-set room, soured by the lack of
  sunlight, where Naia of Aphur lay on the soiled padding of a
  battered couch, cradling Jason, Son of Jason, in her arms.</p>

  <p>He told her of his progress, now he should take Koryphu to
  Zitra, how there he should let him tell his story before
  Jadgor, how a message would be sent north through Mazhur,
  bearing Tamarizia's demands for a meeting between
  representatives of both nations, whereat Zollaria's demands
  and Tamarizia's attitude toward them might be discussed.</p>

  <p>And then he left her and fled swiftly back to Himyra and
  the form on the copper couch.</p>

  <p>Three days after Helmor of Zollaria dreamed of the loss of
  a throne, and his ultimate salvation through the safety of a
  child, Jadgor's galley arrived at Himyra with Koryphu of
  Cathur aboard. During the interval Helmor dreamed again
  twice.</p>

  <p>Koryphu's coming announced in advance from Scira was a
  somewhat stately affair, but seemingly failed to give the
  one-time prince much pleasure. His mien was solemn as he left
  the galley and met Robur and Jason on the quays before an
  observant crowd assembled for the occasion. His face was set
  into lines of somber consideration and there was a somber
  light in his eyes. One would have said that Koryphu of Cathur
  held himself as a bearer of bad news.</p>

  <p>Bowing perforce to the welcoming people of Himyra, he took
  his seat in Robur's motur and maintained the poise of a noble
  until the palace was reached and he and his two companions
  were closeted alone. Then he let his feelings loose in a flood
  of resentful speech, describing all that had transpired at his
  meeting with Kalamita, and at the end of his narration laying
  in Jason's palm the purple signet ring.</p>

  <p>"Whether this comes from Naia of Aphur of her own choice,
  or was forcibly taken from her I know not, O Mouthpiece of
  Zitu, but since it was given to me with the command to say she
  sent it to you with her plea for an early acceptance of the
  terms of ransom, I fulfill my mission and place it in your
  hands."</p>

  <p>Croft turned the trinket gently. It affected him
  strangely&mdash;and he had little doubt of the thoughts
  unexpressed in Koryphu's mind. The ring spoke to him with
  almost suffocating force of the slender hand whereon it had
  been worn, of Naia of Aphur, and all she stood for to him. And
  he sensed that for the Cathurian the sight of the purple gem
  had been a most unpleasant surprise&mdash;a hint that a woman
  of Tamarizia had faltered in her Spartan duty to her
  nation&mdash;had sent it to her husband to speak to him as
  ever now it was doing of herself. Suddenly he whirled on
  Koryphu with a question:</p>

  <p>"Think you, man of Cathur, that Naia, daughter of Jadgor's
  sister, cousin to Robur of Aphur, wife of Jason, sent this to
  him by the hand of Kalamita, through any choice save force? In
  Zitu's name, let me have your answer and promptly&mdash;son of
  Scythys's house."</p>

  <p>Koryphu's face grew pale and he licked his lips, ere his
  pallor vanished and gave place to a mounting flush.</p>

  <p>"Nay," he stammered. "Nay, Jason&mdash;I meant nought save
  to make plain the thought that Kalamita had added this to her
  efforts to persuade you. May Zilla strike me if I sought to
  question her who is Jason's wife."</p>

  <p>Croft nodded. "Then let the matter remain between
  ourselves. Koryphu of Cathur, so soon as you are refreshed, we
  go to Zitra, to hold speech with Jadgor in person concerning
  these things."</p>

  <p>"Let not Koryphu delay you," Koryphu said quickly.
  "Refreshment were not needful in a pressing matter or one
  involving the safety of Jason's wife and son."</p>

  <p>His response gave Croft satisfaction, and he took him at
  his word.</p>

  <p>"Accept Jason's gratitude then instead," he made answer.
  "So quickly as the galley shall fill her tanks with fuel for
  the motur, we shall go aboard."</p>

  <p>Already he had arranged with Robur to urge the work in
  Himyra during his absence, taking up all foreseen details with
  him and assuring him that he could answer questions by the
  wireless almost as quickly as though present in the flesh, and
  even before her arrival he had seen to it that the captain of
  the quays had orders to see the galley refueled.</p>

  <p>Consequently, Koryphu having waived all formality in the
  matter, afternoon found them dropping down the Na, and evening
  brought the mouth of the mighty river, where its yellow waters
  tinted the clearer flood of the Central Seas for miles. The
  galley pointed her trim prow into the north and east at her
  maximum of speed.</p>

  <p>Haste, haste, haste. The thing gnawed now at Jason Croft's
  heart. It urged him, spurred him, fired his every thought and
  action. And as he stretched himself on his couch that night
  with the signet of Naia of Aphur a purple talisman on a silver
  chain above his neck, it was with the determination to
  complete his task quickly in Zitra, and return in haste to
  Himyra, there to once more speed his work.</p>

  <p>Zitra rose white before them the morning of the fourth day,
  ringed by its shimmering walls, fairylike as a mirage on first
  appearance. Tamarizia's flag was broken out above the galley
  and it darted into the inner harbor through the massive
  silver-faced sea-doors.</p>

  <p>Jadgor and Zitra waited. Days before, Robur had warned his
  father of Croft's coming, by wireless, and the word had gone
  out that the Mouthpiece of Zitu was returning briefly to the
  city for the first time since the loss of his wife and
  child.</p>

  <p>Now as he stood on the afterdeck, brave in his metal
  harness, with the wings of Azil&mdash;the Cross Ansata blazing
  blue upon it&mdash;the azure plumes nodding above his helmet,
  Koryphu beside him, and the galley swung toward her mooring, a
  wonderful picture was spread before his eyes.</p>

  <p>The quays were banked with life. Jadgor, Lakkon, and
  members of the national assembly showed in metal harness or
  gem-encrusted garments; Zud, the high priest, stood beside
  them backed by a group of harpists, a band of the Gayana, the
  vestals of the pyramid, mark of Croft's semireligious position
  in the nation.</p>

  <p>White-clad they were, their hair loosened save for a
  binding silver fillet, their lower limbs cased in white
  leather nearly to their rosy knees. And back of them was the
  crowd, close pressed, necks craning, restrained by members of
  the Zitran guard, who were patrolling the quays or massed
  about the moturs, the carriages of the assemblymen, the
  officials of state, in a glittering phalanx at the end of the
  street of approach.</p>

  <p>Croft saw it all with a swelling heart as the galley
  touched the quay and a gangplank was run out. The trumpets of
  the guardsmen blared and the harpists lifted their instruments
  into position, their voices mounted in a chant of welcome and
  blended with the clamor of the crowd.</p>

  <p>At the foot of the gangplank, Jadgor and Zud and Lakkon
  waited. Jadgor and he struck palms.</p>

  <p>"Hail, Jason, Mouthpiece of Zitu," said Naia's uncle, and
  turned to Croft's companion. "And to Koryphu of Cathur
  greeting. It has come to my ear that Scythys's son has served
  right loyally Zitu's Mouthpiece and in him all the people of
  Tamarizia as well. Wherefore is he welcome to Zitra and
  Jadgor's palace as an honored guest."</p>

  <p>The face of the Cathurian twitched. As at the time Croft
  had approached him, he seemed deeply moved by the mark of
  favor from the president of his nation. "Now, by Zitu, O
  Jadgor," he replied in a tone of quick emotion, "your words
  make the heart of Koryphu beat once more as the heart of a
  man."</p>

  <p>Zud spoke to Jason. "Thou must speak to them, lord." His
  glance turned to the close-packed throng of faces. "For many
  days their thoughts have been upon you. They await the
  Mouthpiece of Zitu's words at this time."</p>

  <p>"Aye." Croft nodded. The thing was inevitable. He must
  speak&mdash;explain his mission to the people, give them some
  definite understanding of the situation and his motives. No
  matter how much he might begrudge the time involved in even so
  short a delay, the thing must be done.</p>

  <p>"Here?" he questioned.</p>

  <p>"Nay," said Zud, "the matter is arranged."</p>

  <p>Again Croft inclined his head and turned to lay his hand on
  Lakkon's shoulder much as he had done the morning Jason, Son
  of Jason was born. It was the first time the two men had met
  since the night he had sworn to carry the present matter
  through to the bitter end, and he sensed a mutual yearning
  question in the aged noble's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Father of Naia," he said, "this coming marks a step toward
  the goal to which both thee and Jason turn their hearts. Yet
  this sun shall make all plain."</p>

  <p>Then turning again to Zud, he followed toward the high
  priest's car, in which the prelate indicated that he was to
  ride.</p>

  <p>Jadgor and Lakkon entered their motur. The phalanx of
  guardsmen swung about. The trumpeters took the van. The
  harpists fell in before Zud and Jason. The Gayana&mdash;their
  arms filled with brilliant flowers&mdash;ranged themselves on
  either side, and lifted their voices in song. The procession
  moved off along the level floor of Zitra's pavements, through
  the welcoming throng, to pause after a time in the midst of a
  broad, open space.</p>

  <p>Croft recognized it with leaping pulses as the square in
  which he had been proclaimed as Zitu's Mouthpiece&mdash;saw
  that once more it held an elevated stage.</p>

  <p>Upon it he mounted with Zud and Jadgor and Lakkon, the men
  of the assembly&mdash;the harpists&mdash;the Gayana&mdash;over
  a carpet of the flowers they cast before his feet. His eyes
  swept over the faces of the concourse. His heart swelled oddly
  at the sight. This was Tamarizia&mdash;her people. This was
  Zitra&mdash;her citizens. These were the men and women of the
  nation he had taken a hand in saving from the nation to the
  north, in saving and making strong, and leading toward a
  greater progress, a wider knowledge&mdash;a broader
  individuality than they had ever known. These were the people
  of Naia's race. Of a sudden he stood before them&mdash;the
  picture of a strong man in his gorgeous harness.</p>

  <p>He lifted his hand. The throbbing of the harps&mdash;the
  liquid voices of the Gayana died. Croft spoke. To those lifted
  faces he told the story of all that had happened, the reason
  for his coming again to Zitra. To them he gave the substance
  of Zollaria's demands. A sound ran through them&mdash;deep,
  low-pitched&mdash;and unmistakable thing of amazement and
  resentment. It was as if the multitude groaned.</p>

  <p>He waited until it was past and gave them his
  word&mdash;the word of the Mouthpiece of Zitu, that Tamarizia
  would never yield an acceptance. He bade them to be of good
  courage, waiting until the steps he was intent on taking could
  produce results&mdash;and then&mdash;should his plans
  fail&mdash;should harm befall Naia of Aphur or Jason, Son of
  Jason&mdash;he promised them to call on them to follow him
  into action&mdash;to lead them once more against Zollaria with
  the sword.</p>

  <p>And now the people cheered. "Harken to the Mouthpiece of
  Zitu. Give heed to his words," a strong voice roared.</p>

  <p>Other voices took up the words&mdash;they became lost to
  all articulate seeming, blended into an acclaiming wave of
  sound, ran together into a composite thunder in a thousand
  throats that spoke of acceptance, in words no longer, but in
  unmistakable tones.</p>

  <p>Croft lifted his arms, high-flung before them.</p>

  <p>"My people," he cried, his face exalted by that mighty
  response, that rising ululation of lifted voices. "Zollaria
  shall receive Tamarizia's answer ere long."</p>

  <p>Again the roar of voices beat back like the pulse of a
  human surf upon his ears.</p>

  <p>He dropped his arms and turned.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said to Jadgor. Together they left the platform
  and entered the president's car, with Koryphu and Lakkon. They
  made their way through the swarming multitude, preceded by the
  trumpeters and guards.</p>

  <p>"This night the assembly meets to hear Jason's pleasure,"
  Jadgor said as he took his place at Croft's side. "Robur bade
  me smooth the path of your mission in a message. Wherefore I
  have summoned their number to a special session, since he said
  also that I best could aid you by arranging for your return to
  Himyra with speed."</p>

  <p>"Aye," Croft replied, his heart warming toward Robur.
  "Speed in all things, O Jadgor. So shall we solve this riddle.
  Speed in our work of preparation&mdash;in the execution of our
  plans&mdash;speed so great that we shall strike in terror upon
  the sight of Helmor and all Berla, and ere they expect our
  coming, wake to the threat of our presence over Berla's
  walls."</p>

  <p>"Hai!" Jadgor's eyes flashed at the answer. Old war-horse
  that he was, the picture fired his imagination, smacking as it
  did of the methods of the sword. "Robur said naught save that
  once more the forges of Himyra roar to the making of yet
  another marvel."</p>

  <p>Croft nodded. "Which presently I shall make plain."</p>

  <p>And he kept the promise, once the four men were closeted in
  a small room of the palace, its sliding door covered by a
  scarlet curtain, its windows partly veiled by crimson tissues,
  its floors half concealed by gorgeous rugs.</p>

  <p>First he called on Koryphu for his story of the meeting
  with Kalamita, and after the Cathurian had spoken, he
  explained all he intended doing and all that thus far he had
  done.</p>

  <p>At the end Koryphu was standing rigid, wide of eye and
  flared of nostril, with back-thrown head, Lakkon was watching,
  leaning against the end of a table, and Jadgor had thrown a
  hand across his body and was gripping the hilt of his
  heavy-bladed sword.</p>

  <p>"Now, by Zitu," he exclaimed, his tone a trifle hoarsened,
  "to fly above them, to rain death upon them&mdash;to bring
  them crawling for mercy where they had thought to tie our
  hands and despoil us at their pleasure! Mouthpiece of Zitu, O
  Jason, art thou rightly called. These things fail of mortal
  comprehension, save they be by Zitu himself inspired. Would
  Jadgor might go with thee on this avenging journey. Fire? Hah!
  Let them call on Bel if they still desire it. Tamarizia shall
  bring them fire from the skies themselves&mdash;clean
  fire&mdash;unlike that their filthy priesthood builds in their
  stinking god."</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Croft, well pleased by Jadgor's outburst of
  approval. "The fire of Zitu's justice, O Jadgor&mdash;that
  shall destroy the guilty wholly should the innocent come to
  harm."</p>

  <p>Jadgor opened his lips, paused and relaxed the tightened
  muscles of his throat by a swallowing movement. "By
  Zitu&mdash;this mission you shall ask tonight is therefore no
  more than a blind, a means of gaining time?"</p>

  <p>"Aye." Once more Croft assented. "Zollaria expects it. Let
  it be sent to occupy her mind."</p>

  <p>The lips of the Tamarizian president twitched. "Oh,
  aye&mdash;it departs for Mazhur beyond any doubting. We shall
  demand the naming of an embassy to confer with men of our
  choosing."</p>

  <p>Abruptly Lakkon asked a tense-voiced question&mdash;"Thou
  art assured she lies even now within Berla's walls?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," Croft told him, looking him steadily in the eyes.
  "And the father of Naia of Aphur knows well how Jason
  knows."</p>

  <p>Jadgor nodded, quickly sensing his meaning, and that he
  cared not to discuss the matter of his astral powers before
  Cathur's prince.</p>

  <p>"Enough," he said, rising, "we have gained an ample
  understanding and Cathur has been overlong aboard the galley.
  It were fitting now that he refresh himself."</p>

  <p>Summoning an attendant he gave orders that Koryphu be
  conducted to a room.</p>

  <p>Lakkon rose also, remaining until the Cathurian had quitted
  the apartment, then turned to Croft.</p>

  <p>"Thou hast seen her, Jason, my son?" he
  faltered&mdash;"thou hast seen her and the child&mdash;hast
  spoken with her in the spirit?"</p>

  <p>Croft smiled as he made answer&mdash;"Aye, since last I saw
  thee, Lakkon, many times."</p>

  <p>"She lies in Berla, indeed?"</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;beneath Helmor's palace."</p>

  <p>"How fares she?" Emotion thickened Lakkron's utterance.
  "Sent she no message by thee?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, the love and respect of a daughter." Croft explained
  the situation from first to last, even describing the manner
  in which Helmor had been warned.</p>

  <p>When next he paused Jadgor's eyes were narrowed to rigid
  slits, and Lakkon's features were pale and drawn.</p>

  <p>"Zitu," he said in husky fashion, "I doubt not thy power,
  my son. Naia, my own child, has named it to me and Zud himself
  confirms it a thing accorded to thee from Zitu's
  hands&mdash;yet to safeguard your child and hers, by causing
  Helmor to dream. This thing seems passing strange. Think you
  the man will give heed to such a warning sufficiently
  long?"</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;Tamarizia's messenger reaches him with a demand
  for parley," Croft declared from the depths of his inmost
  feeling. "Think you I had taken time to journey thus to Zitra,
  save that to my mind the step were one wholly needful to the
  full success of my plans?"</p>

  <p>Jadgor spoke. "Nay, Jason is right. This step is that of a
  statesman. Let Zollaria lie unsuspecting, while his devices
  are in the making. Tonight the matter of the messenger and his
  message will be arranged."</p>

  <p>Lakkon sighed deeply. His face was still pallid, but he
  seemed in a measure reassured.</p>

  <p>"Now, Zitu be praised," he said, once more addressing
  Croft, "since in very truth he appears to guide and strengthen
  your mind."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9">IX. &mdash; THE DEATH PLOT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JADGOR'S faith in the action of the assembly
  proved justified, in fact. Croft went before the
  representatives of the Tamarizian states that very same
  night.</p>

  <p>With Koryphu to precede him, telling of the meeting in the
  mountains north of Cathur, the slaying of the flier by
  Kalamita's orders&mdash;the swift retaliation of his fellow in
  simple fashion, he waited until the Cathurian had lashed the
  minds of the men who heard him to a pitch of sullen fury, then
  rose slowly to his feet.</p>

  <p>"These demands bid for no consideration," he began and
  paused, laying his hand on the hilt of his sword.</p>

  <p>An outburst of swift acclaim greeted the words and was
  followed by silence as he explained the object of his presence
  in Zitra&mdash;emphasized the need of a messenger being sent
  north, and asked for their sanctioning word.</p>

  <p>Now and then he was interrupted by a question, but for the
  most part he spoke without interruption. And at the end he
  cried very much as he had cried in the public square to the
  citizens of Zitra:</p>

  <p>"Grant me this, O representatives of Tamarizia&mdash;give
  me time to prepare Tamarizia's answer to this coward's threat
  of a treacherous nation, which, daring not again the shock of
  arms, seeks yet to win back her lost prestige behind the
  tender bodies of a woman and her child. Grant me the power to
  meet craft with craft, nor think that the signet given to
  Koryphu was stripped from the hand of Naia of Aphur save by
  force, in the treacherous hope that it might seem to support a
  spurious plea from her that Tamarizia yield."</p>

  <p>For a moment no one spoke after he had finished and stood
  waiting for their answer, and then the man from Bithur
  rose.</p>

  <p>"Nay," he cried, "not that Naia, daughter of Jadgor's
  sister, daughter of Lakkon&mdash;not that Naia, who was wed to
  Zitu's Mouthpiece within Atla of Bithur when the blue hordes
  of Mazzer captained by the brother of this same Kalamita, and
  other men of his nation, lapped like the waves of an unclean
  sea against Atla's walls. Not of such metal is her spirit.
  Tamarizians, send this messenger north from Mazhur; let him
  demand that Zollaria support or deny her woman agent's
  words."</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;aye," came other voices.</p>

  <p>Jadgor rose, his silver cuirass blazing. "Add to the
  message answer to Kalamita's foul threat, that if aught
  befalls Jason, Son of Jason&mdash;aye, or Naia, mother of
  Jason&mdash;ere parley is held on the matter, Tamarizia waits
  but the knowledge to unsheathe the sword."</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;aye," again a storm of voices answered his
  suggestion.</p>

  <p>"A vote&mdash;a vote!" someone began shouting.</p>

  <p>"Let Tamarizia's message be strong."</p>

  <p>In the end, once the turmoil excited by the Bithurian and
  Jadgor had in a measure subsided, a formal vote was taken, and
  Croft himself was empowered to draft the message entrusting it
  to one of the regular government couriers&mdash;men so
  employed for years and of trained endurance. Well satisfied,
  he went back to the palace, worked half the night in
  formulating it to his liking, interviewed the man who was to
  bear it, and watched his galley sail out of Zitra and turn
  north at dawn.</p>

  <p>And now Himyra and his work behind its red walls called
  him. He lost small time in answering its call. Once more his
  galley slipped forth from the massive sea-doors. Zitra sank
  into the Central Sea&mdash;or seemed to, slipping little by
  little beneath the sparkling waters with its shimmering milk
  white walls.</p>

  <p>Speed. He had used the word to Jadgor. And now he called
  upon the captain of the galley for it&mdash;speed to Himyra.
  And he promised himself speed on the task before him once he
  reached Aphur's ruddy city&mdash;such speed as never before,
  not even in the heat of his preparation against the Zollarian
  war, had he employed.</p>

  <p>For three days he chafed against the surge and plunge of
  the galley, the slither of each passing wave, until after dawn
  on the morn of the fourth, the mouth of the Na was reached.
  Eight days had been consumed on the journey&mdash;eight days
  wherein Naia of Aphur had lain in the room under Helmor's
  palace&mdash;their light, save for a few brief, moments with
  each dawning, shut away from her purple eyes&mdash;growing
  ever darker and larger in the white mask of her face.</p>

  <p>Eight days. The thought stabbed Croft almost as keenly as a
  dagger-thrust might have hurt. Eight days&mdash;and how much
  longer until he finished his work. There were times when his
  course&mdash;the time of her durance, seemed an infinity of
  days no less to him than to Naia of Aphur herself&mdash;times
  when, save for his unshakable resolution, he would have been
  tempted to wring his hands, to mouth at the trick fate had
  played upon him, to curse&mdash;perhaps to shriek his protest
  at the seemingly countless delays by which even in his labors
  he was faced.</p>

  <p>And Naia of Aphur had not even labor to break the ordeal of
  her waiting. On the morning of that eighth day Jason Croft,
  Mouthpiece of Zitu, stood looking down to the swirl of the
  Na's yellow flood past the hull of the galley with a somber
  face.</p>

  <p>Presently he raised it. Before night he would be in Himyra,
  and he had come back to the same conclusion he always reached.
  He squared his shoulders and set his lips back into lines of
  determination. He turned his face up the yellow river as
  though even then to catch the first glimpse of its mighty
  walls. In Himyra he would work.</p>

  <p>Work! It was the panacea for waiting&mdash;it was the
  answer to the riddle that obsessed him as he himself had said
  more than once in considering the matter&mdash;the means to
  Naia of Aphur's and Jason, the Son of Jason's release. He had
  forbidden word of his coming preceding him to Robur's city. He
  wanted no trumpery of public welcomes, no ceremonials, however
  slight, to delay his purpose now. Almost before the galley had
  tied fast to the quays he left it, and threw himself into his
  task.</p>

  <p>He gave himself wholly to it. He, appeared unexpectedly
  that afternoon in the shops, the forges, learning that Robur
  had not been idle, with a mounting satisfaction, finally
  meeting Aphur's governor face to face on one of his stops.</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" cried Robur. "I knew not of your returning. Is it
  your spirit come to mark my progress, Jason, my friend, or do
  I behold you in the flesh?"</p>

  <p>"Both," Croft answered. "Spirit and flesh united on the
  work before us, Rob, at last."</p>

  <p>"All is arranged?" Robur's eyes flashed with anticipation
  of Croft's answer.</p>

  <p>"Aye." Jason inclined his head. "There should be naught to
  distract from our labors from now until the end."</p>

  <p>"The end&mdash;ha!&mdash;the end," said Robur. "Together we
  shall bring it quickly, my friend."</p>

  <p>Little by little each day the work advanced. The liquid
  fire was an accomplished fact. Trusted men&mdash;the best
  educated in their line in Himyra were engaged now upon its
  production, its preparation for the final venture, as they
  filled it into the containing flasks.</p>

  <p>The shapes of six blimps were slowly forming&mdash;huge,
  unwieldy seeming, bags constructed out of Croft's varnished
  cloth. Little by little the means of putting the plan of
  rescue into execution was taking concrete form at last.</p>

  <p>Miles of rope and cordage were flowing out of the
  shops&mdash;were being woven into the harness by which the
  cars should be swung beneath the gigantic envelopes. Vast
  quantities of chemicals were being collected toward the
  production of unlimited cubic feet of hydrogen gas.</p>

  <p>Through all the seeming chaos Jason moved, ordering,
  directing, with a fresh certainty of precision now, as
  something like a definite result to all the days and nights of
  labor showed.</p>

  <p>With him went Robur, aiding and abetting in all ways toward
  the successful issue of the task. Gaya listened each night to
  a report of the progress made.</p>

  <p>During the war with Mazzer, Croft had perfected a dry-cell
  battery to solve the ignition troubles of the armored moturs.
  Now with the liquid fire in the process of manufacture, he
  turned himself to the problem of constructing an electric
  flashlight, by which signals between the blimps could be
  exchanged.</p>

  <p>Days passed. A Zitran had elapsed since his return from
  Zitra. At its end word came by wireless that Zollaria's answer
  had been received&mdash;that Helmor consented to the naming of
  a Zollarian delegation to discuss the terms of
  ransom&mdash;that a Tamarizian party would be formed and sent
  north to meet them, with instructions to protract the
  negotiations, turn the parleys between the Zollarians and
  themselves into a useless war of words.</p>

  <p>Croft read the message and wirelessed back his ratification
  of it. He was very well pleased indeed. Let the matter be
  delayed yet another Zitran as it might without exciting undue
  suspicion, since it would take well-nigh half that time for
  the two delegations to be arranged and get together, and he
  felt he would be practically prepared.</p>

  <p>Even now six monster bags were nearing completion in the
  huge sheds built by swarming workmen for their housing. The
  cars were ready for attaching, the moturs to be installed.
  That ceaseless driving of a double shift had crowded the work
  of two Zitrans into one so far as results were concerned.
  Satisfied with the word from Zitra, Croft flung himself into
  the last stages of his task with redoubled vigor. The
  envelopes were inflated and floated clear of the ground.</p>

  <p>Workmen swarmed about them on spidery trestles and stages,
  harnessing each monster inside its network of securely knotted
  cordage, binding fast with each intricate twist and turning as
  it seemed to the man who ceaselessly watched them, some part
  of his desperate hope.</p>

  <p>Motur-trucks brought from the shops of their fabrication
  the cages to be hung beneath each tensely floating shape. Men
  sweating at their labor, made them fast. The new moturs Croft
  had designed at first were assembled, delivered and mounted.
  Propellers were set in place. Day by day the first dirigibles
  of Palos grew nearer to completion.</p>

  <p>Robur was inseparable during those days from Croft. He
  viewed the monster devices with unbounded enthusiasm and
  amaze, vowing them the marvel of their age, repeating over and
  over again his own conception of the consternation they must
  cause in Zollarian minds when, without warning, they appeared
  and hung above Berla's walls. Gaya drove down at his
  solicitation on one occasion and gazed at the hugely bulking
  shapes out of widening brown eyes.</p>

  <p>Word came again from Zitra that the Tamarizian delegation
  had gone north.</p>

  <p>"Let them go," Croft cried to Robur. "Ere long shall Jason
  follow."</p>

  <p>"Aye, by Zitu," the Aphurian replied, casting his eyes
  toward the glistening gasbags, beneath which the swarming
  workmen toiled.</p>

  <p>Came a day when the last rivet was driven home, the last
  nut screwed into place, when Croft distributed largess to the
  workmen and a vast roar of human voices filled all the places
  where his latest creation had been given birth. Croft stood
  with Robur and viewed them&mdash;the mighty engines for the
  deliverance of his hostages to fate. His heart leaped.</p>

  <p>"With the sun," he said, turning to his companion, "let
  Himyra see them. We make a test."</p>

  <p>"I and thou," Robur returned, flashing his even teeth.
  "Dost remember the dawn you mounted the skies in the first
  airplane, Jason&mdash;and, returning, found Naia waiting to
  dare the venture with you? Now, by Zitu, Robur goes to try
  these blimps himself."</p>

  <p>Croft nodded. His hand crept out and closed on the other
  man's. Well he remembered the day his words recalled. His
  return from the trial flight in the plane to find Naia waiting
  beside the hangar in her russet leather dress, and how as they
  rose between the Sirian sun and Himyra, she had lifted her
  voice and sung in a pure abandonment of emotion. Deep in his
  heart he vowed that these monsters of his construction should
  bring her back to Himyra&mdash;give her the opportunity to
  sing again.</p>

  <p>Yet, all he said to Robur was, "Aye, Rob, if you wish."</p>

  <p>Robur's muscles gripped down upon his fingers. "And not
  only to the testing, friend of Aphur, but even to Berla
  itself."</p>

  <p>"Berla." Croft loosened his hand to lay it on Robur's
  shoulder, look into the son of Jadgor's eager face. "It is not
  in my heart, Rob, to refuse you anything in this."</p>

  <p>Dawn came and Himyra gasped&mdash;gasped and stood with
  heads back-tilted, staring upward at a mighty oblong bag that
  swung in majestic fashion high above the walls.</p>

  <p>It hung there like a monstrous bubble, glinting as the rays
  of Sirius struck upon it&mdash;drifting slowly as it seemed
  before the winds of morning. And yet&mdash;even as they
  watched it, turning and moving against the wind in steady
  fashion&mdash;silently&mdash;without seeming reason, too high
  above the red, red city of Aphur, for the ears of her. people
  to sense how its moturs roared.</p>

  <p>An hour before&mdash;under direction of Croft and
  Robur&mdash;it had been dragged slowly forth from its
  concealing shed. With filled tanks its engines waited the
  awakening touch of the engineers&mdash;men selected for this
  first attempt at dirigible navigation from the aviation
  personnel by Croft himself. A huge flash of the liquid fire,
  equipped with its spraying device, was attached to the carrier
  designed to hold it. When this was done Croft and Robur
  stepped aboard.</p>

  <p>A hundred workmen&mdash;men who had labored to construct
  it&mdash;held the ropes that still controlled it, ready to
  release it at a word.</p>

  <p>"Let go!" That word came in the Mouthpiece of Zitu's
  voice.</p>

  <p>Two hundred hands relaxed their hold upon the ropes. The
  blimp soared toward the skies.</p>

  <p>Himyra fell away beneath it, became a red gem on the yellow
  sand of the desert, the breast of Aphur, pierced by the thread
  of the Na like a sparkling, supporting chain. To the north and
  east the waters of the Central Sea showed as bright as
  burnished silver under the first rays of the sun.</p>

  <p>Robour made no comment, said no word. He stood
  tight-lipped, gripping the rail of the platform on which they
  rode with tensely muscled hands. Croft ordered the engines
  started&mdash;and even so there was no feeling that the mighty
  fabric moved. Rather it seemed stationary, the only solid
  thing in all existence, while Palos and all it held dropped
  away from beneath it, until Himyra's palaces and shops and
  houses became things no larger than the toys of children, her
  people, pigmies moving antlike on her streets.</p>

  <p>Croft pointed beyond the walls.</p>

  <p>"The desert," he said and watched while the blimp answered
  to the manipulation of her engines&mdash;her rudder and
  vanes.</p>

  <p>Then and then only he spoke to Robur for the first time.
  "The desert. Recall you, Rob, the morn of the first motur in
  Himyra, when we drove into it from Himyra's walls, and
  Lakkon's gnuppas bolted, and I touched the hand of Naia of
  Aphur first?"</p>

  <p>"Aye." Robur turned. Himyra was receding as the blimp
  followed her new course. "By&mdash;Zitu&mdash;we are aiming
  for it again."</p>

  <p>Croft nodded. "It is in my mind to try first the liquid
  fire upon its scanty vegetation, where it can do small
  harm."</p>

  <p>And after that he waited until they flew above a
  comparatively level tract of country, covered by a low-growing
  shrub that throve on scanty moisture, before he stationed
  himself at the spraying device and opened the valve of the
  flask.</p>

  <p>Far below, the scrub blossomed suddenly into tiny points of
  color like swiftly opening flowers&mdash;that grew, expanded,
  ran together in patches and lines of quivering light, until
  the whole mass of vegetation vanished, blotted out beneath a
  leaping sea of flame. A moment before it had lain there
  unchanged, as it and the desert had lain practically unchanged
  for years, and now it was a seething, smoking, blazing thing,
  sinking down in a red destruction unloosed upon it from the
  skies.</p>

  <p>Croft closed the tank. "Back to Himyra," he cried and
  turned a set face to Robur, to find his features pale and
  rigid, his eyes narrowed as though the vegetation beneath him,
  writhing in a swift dissolution, were to his imagination the
  bodies of men and women caught beneath a rain of death inside
  a city's walls.</p>

  <p>"It is finished, Rob," he said, speaking in a voice that
  quivered tensely. "As soon as the fliers are trained we go
  north."</p>

  <p>Croft nodded. The strange intoxication of success was upon
  him.</p>

  <p>"Ere night," he said, "we test the others." And then
  sinking his voice for no ears save Robur's. "And tonight I
  shall look into Naia of Aphur's eyes and tell her we are
  well-nigh prepared."</p>

  <p>That day he entered his motur once the blimp had landed,
  drove to the airplane hangars, and called for volunteers to
  man the other five ships.</p>

  <p>Returning with the men selected he personally tested each
  blimp, rising, maneuvering and returning before a constantly
  growing crowd, which in the end required the use of a
  detachment of the Himyra guard for its restraining.</p>

  <p>Himyra was seething with an excitement augmented with the
  ascent of each mighty glistening bag. A jostling throng
  pressed like an impenetrable wall about the sheds, as each new
  monster was towed out by its straining attendants, was manned
  by its waiting crew, and rose. They watched and pointed,
  gesticulated, and cheered.</p>

  <p>"Hail to the Mouthpiece of Zitu!" they roared whenever
  Croft appeared.</p>

  <p>That night, eagerness possessed him when he sought his
  chamber and laid himself down&mdash;an eagerness that had
  possessed him through the length of the day&mdash;an eagerness
  to visit Naia and tell her that the thing was done.</p>

  <p>He closed his eyes and released the bonds of his spirit.
  North and north he fled across the Central Sea. where the
  giant shapes he had designed and builded would make their way
  ere long. North and north over Mazhur, where the Tamarizian
  delegation had gone to meet that of the northern nation. North
  and north to Berla, and to Helmor's palace and the fetid room
  beneath it&mdash;to stand gazing with eager eyes on Naia of
  Aphur's form.</p>

  <p>Pale as death she sat there, waiting, waiting, as she had
  waited so long, and she was speaking. "Jason&mdash;Jason,"
  over and over she was repeating the word to his son.</p>

  <p>"Ja-son&mdash;" the baby lips repeated with a scanning
  effort. And Naia of Aphur smiled and gathered him into her
  arms.</p>

  <p>Jason&mdash;with a full heart Croft understood that she was
  teaching the child the name of his father&mdash;that this word
  was one of the first his tongue had known.</p>

  <p>"Beloved&mdash;O my beloved!" he sent their meeting call to
  her.</p>

  <p>She stiffened, threw up her head, and turned to Maia.</p>

  <p>"Come, take the child, thou faithful one," she
  directed&mdash;waited until the blue girl had complied and
  stretched her form on the couch, ere she answered his summons,
  releasing her astral body to steal into Croft's waiting
  arms.</p>

  <p>For a moment he simply held her, and then he told her.
  "Beloved&mdash;the time approaches. The thing is done."</p>

  <p>"Done?" she faltered.</p>

  <p>"Aye, finished wholly," Jason said, and felt her
  quiver&mdash;sensed the fires of her astral being
  quicken&mdash;found the form he held suddenly glowing.</p>

  <p>"Now Zitu be praised." In all her slender length she
  pressed suddenly closer to him. "Draws then so near the
  day?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, by Zitu," he declared.</p>

  <p>"I know not the meaning of it," Naia said, "but Maia lies
  daily on the straw within the door of our chamber&mdash;and
  she had heard mutterings now and then among the guard. Thy
  mention of Bandhor recalls it. Kalamita's brother has come
  among them within the last few suns, if one may credit their
  speech among themselves."</p>

  <p>"Bandhor? To what purpose?" Croft questioned quickly,
  vaguely disturbed that the Zollarian generalissimo should have
  held speech in person with members of the palace guard.</p>

  <p>"Nay, I know not. Maia but heard mention of his
  presence&mdash;some word concerning Helmor's signet."</p>

  <p>"His signet? Hai!" Croft found himself suddenly shaken.
  "Now may Zitemku seize that woman, and Adita turn her favor
  from her!"</p>

  <p>"Thou meanest&mdash;Kalamita?" And now Naia clung against
  him, not in womanly yearning, but with the quick fear of a
  mother. "Jason&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aye," he said tensely, "have you forgotten how she forced
  thy own ring from thee&mdash;or the foul thing she planned,
  save Helmor had overruled her? Now Zitu be thanked you have
  spoken of this in time since, in my own way, those things she
  plans may be learned, and Helmor warned."</p>

  <p>For now it seemed to him, that lost in the press of work in
  Himyra, supported by the sense of security derived from the
  dreams he had inspired in the brain of Zollaria's monarch he
  had indeed been blind, and that while he had labored without
  ceasing, the woman who hated him as only a woman of her type
  could hate, and Ptah, priest of Bel, and possibly Bandhor
  also, had been busy with their schemes. Wherefore, it was best
  that he learn quickly what those schemes embraced, what new
  danger to Naia and Jason, Son of Jason, might be involved.</p>

  <p>"Fear not, beloved. Zitu means not these spawn of Zitemku
  to prevail against us&mdash;wherefore we are warned. Ga, thou
  art, priestess of the Eternal Fire, to me&mdash;messenger of
  Azil have I been to thee, and shall be again&mdash;but
  messenger of Zilla will I be to these plotters&mdash;making
  all their plotting vain. Farewell, thou mate of Jason. He goes
  to learn what they plan."</p>

  <p>In a final caress, he sunk his mouth again to hers, seeming
  as always when he kissed her in such fashion to draw the very
  essence of her being to him. And then he left her, making his
  way swiftly out of the palace and pausing where the fire urns
  flared before it, across a mighty space.</p>

  <p>Once more, then, it behooved him to bring himself into
  contact with the woman Kalamita. He willed himself toward her,
  passed swiftly to Bandhor's palace and failed to find any
  sign; paused, baffled for a time before he recalled the scene
  he had witnessed between her and Ptah, Bel's priest, in the
  latter's quarters in the temple. Then, where better if she
  were plotting against Helmor, he asked himself, than in that
  ebon-walled room.</p>

  <p>Swiftly he sought it, and there he found her&mdash;and not
  only her, but Bandhor, Ptah, and another, a heretofore unknown
  man.</p>

  <p>The four were seated around Ptah's table, where flaring
  oil-lamps partly dispelled the gloom, pricking out the intent
  masks of the several faces, causing iridescent flashes of
  light from the Jeweled bands that circled Kalamita's arms, and
  broidered her garment's hem. In a way that half light struck
  Croft as wholly fitting to the scene wherein these four sat
  together and plotted against Helmor's reign.</p>

  <p>For that they were plotting, the woman's first words made
  plain.</p>

  <p>"It is to thee, Panthor," she declared, eying the third
  masculine member of the party. "It is for thee to say whether
  thy cousin shall hold Zollaria's throne. Twice have his plans
  to humble Tamarizia failed, his efforts proved vain. Think not
  but the people say Helmor has no more Bel's
  favor&mdash;wherefore Zollaria is no longer strong. So
  then&mdash;a quick stroke and the thing is done."</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;a quick stroke." Panthor nodded. He was
  heavy-set, not unlike Helmor, his cousin, in a way, with full
  lips of a sensual turn and closely cut hair, the stubble of
  which was blond. "But&mdash;regarding this child. I question
  not the sincerity of Kalamita, yet were it slain&mdash;even to
  gain Bel's favor, which none more than I admit is needful,
  would not Tamarizia, according to her own words, descend upon
  us with superior weapons and bring defeat to our armies
  again?"</p>

  <p>"By Bel, has then Panthor so little faith in his favor?"
  Ptah exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Peace." Kalamita's red lips curled. "Your question is a
  man's question, Panthor, and the question not of a man's
  heart, but his brain. Think you Tamarizia means all she
  says&mdash;or speaks to gain her ends. This Mouthpiece is a
  man&mdash;and Naia of Aphur is a woman&mdash;and though a
  child be slain, still is she a woman and the mate of Jason,
  and he has twice defeated Helmor's plans to gain. Think you
  the child's death would change the heart of Tamarizia's strong
  man, or that he would carry his threat far&mdash;were she kept
  safe from harm to be surrendered once more to his arms?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, by Bel!" roared Bandhor, striking the table. "My
  sister has struck the mark in her words&mdash;with Bel's favor
  purchased&mdash;her oath redeemed and the woman still in our
  possession, Tamarizia may well balk a resort to arms. It
  remains then to get the child in our hands."</p>

  <p>"My hands," said Ptah with an evil grin.</p>

  <p>Bandhor nodded. "Aye, into thy hands, Priest of the Strong
  One&mdash;and there is a way in which it may be done. Let
  Helmor's signet be presented to the captain of the guard now
  placed upon him, and our ends are gained."</p>

  <p>Kalamita leaned half across the table toward Panthor.</p>

  <p>"Thou knowest the device on Helmor's ring?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Panthor slowly.</p>

  <p>"And thou knowest some worker of stones?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, Priestess of Adita." A tremor of understanding crept
  into Panthor's tones.</p>

  <p>Kalamita drew back and regarded him out of narrowed lids.
  "Were it not possible to have him make what we need?"</p>

  <p>"By Bel&mdash;" Panthor began, and stiffened under her
  glance. "Aye&mdash;so it could be done. Yet time would be
  required."</p>

  <p>"Time?" The woman shrugged. "Is Panthor so anxious then, to
  mount the throne? Helmor plays into our hands in this in
  entering into parley with the southern nation. Once we have
  the child he will seek to regain him&mdash;to take from Bel
  what has been declared his own. Then&mdash;Bandhor&mdash;is
  not brother of Kalamita, and captain of Zollaria's men for
  nothing&mdash;Bel's own priest shall declare Panthor emperor
  in Helmor's place and Bandhor shall support him. How say
  you&mdash;is it not well planned?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Panthor thickly. "Aye, Priestess of Adita."</p>

  <p>"Then let Panthor see Helmor's sign cut on a stone."
  Kalamita rose. "And let him place it in Bandhor's hand when it
  is done. Ptah, build you the fires&mdash;let them be ready for
  the torch at the appointed time. Kalamita's oath to the Strong
  One shall be redeemed. How long, Panthor, before thy part
  shall be done?"</p>

  <p>"Ten suns, perchance twelve," said Panthor, he and Bandhor
  also rising.</p>

  <p>"See to it." Kalamita turned to leave the room. Ptah moved
  his heavy body to set the door open before her, and Bandhor
  joined her. They passed out and were gone.</p>

  <p>Ptah turned back. "Hail emperor, favorite of Bel," he said,
  bending his heavy neck to incline his head to Panthor.</p>

  <p>Panthor's expression changed. He drew himself up to his
  fullest height. Already he seemed to sense the weight of
  authority upon him as he answered. "By Bel&mdash;O
  Ptah&mdash;thou and I together once Helmor sits no more upon
  the throne."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">X. &mdash; THE ATTACK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">TEN days, at most twelve, before Helmor's
  spurious sign should be cut on a lying stone. And then one
  would bear it down to that dungeon where Naia waited a
  promised rescue, and with it as authority demand the child.
  And after that Croft sickened as he left Ptah's
  chamber&mdash;sickened at the thought of what might have
  happened save for Naia's listening ear as she lay on the straw
  inside the door of the dungeon&mdash;Naia's mention of the
  words the blue girl had overheard to him.</p>

  <p>But&mdash;suddenly he stiffened. In ten days a great deal
  might be done. Helmor might be warned as he had said to
  Naia&mdash;or&mdash;the rescue might actually be
  performed.</p>

  <p>Helmor might be warned as before in a dream&mdash;yet to
  make plain to the Zollarian monarch all by which he was
  threatened, it would need to be an elaborate dream indeed. And
  to speed the blimps to Berla would necessitate a start with
  crews but illy trained.</p>

  <p>And even were Helmor warned, how much would it avail, when
  his mind was matched against that of Kalamita, unless he might
  be induced to act directly against her, unless she and Bandhor
  and Panthor were arrested and confined? And could such a
  warning as Croft was able to give inspire the man on
  Zollaria's throne to such a move&mdash;or if it did so, would
  it not precipitate internal troubles in Berla, perhaps as
  fatal to Croft's own purpose as Kalamita's schemes? Torn on
  the horns of such a dilemma, his spirit writhed.</p>

  <p>In the end he made his way back to the palace and into
  Helmor's chamber. The man would be asleep, he fancied, but
  once he had gained his apartments he met with a surprise. Far
  from sleep, Zollaria's emperor sat in consultation with Gazar,
  the soothsayer he had summoned to him the night of his first
  dream of danger, and a man Croft had once defeated on a bloody
  field, and learned later to know by sight at the end of the
  first Zollarian war as Helmon, Helmor's son.</p>

  <p>Helmor's face was dark with ill suppressed rage.</p>

  <p>"Thou sayest that Panthor, my cousin, entered the house of
  Bel, upon their heels. What makest thou of it, Gazar? Speak
  thou who for years have been to me eyes and ears."</p>

  <p>So that was it. Soothsayer Gazar might be, but he evidently
  combined the work of espionage with his other vocation, as it
  now appeared.</p>

  <p>Croft gave him full attention as he began speaking
  slowly.</p>

  <p>"Helmor knows the claim his cousin makes for his house in
  Zollarian affairs. Were Bandhor to support him it were ill
  indeed. And Bandhor is the brother of Kalamita&mdash;whose
  power would appear to have made drunk her spirit as her beauty
  had made drunk the hearts of men. Also there is the matter of
  the Tamarizian's child."</p>

  <p>"Bandhor, Kalamita, Panthor&mdash;'tis a pretty trio, my
  father," Helmor said. "The woman grants her favor lightly
  where her interest is involved&mdash;and Panthor, is a man and
  ambitious&mdash;even as Ptah is a man, though a priest. Also
  has she a debt of hate to be repaid against this Mouthpiece of
  Zitu&mdash;whom I love not myself. Lies anything definite
  against them, O Gazar?"</p>

  <p>"Nay"&mdash;the old man shook his head&mdash;"naught as yet
  save what one may suspect&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then"&mdash;Helmor leaned toward him to speak in lowered
  tones&mdash;"what would Gazar advise?"</p>

  <p>"Look to the woman and the child. To me it is known that
  Bandhor has been among his guard. Let it be changed from sun
  to sun, O Helmor, neither captained by or including the same
  men twice. So it appears to me he shall be safe for the
  present, unless some unforeseen happening transpire. Let
  Panthor be watched closely by trusted men&mdash;watch for a
  meeting between any two or all of the four we have mentioned
  tonight, again."</p>

  <p>"It is well." Helmor leaned back in his seat. "See to it,
  Helmon, that the guard be changed. Distribute also a largess
  to the palace guard&mdash;announce additional pay to the
  soldiery in Berla of twenty mina, for the Zitran, and
  afterward as much. Gazar&mdash;have me these others watched.
  By Bel, our cousin may find it requires more to cast Helmor
  from his throne than the schemes of a woman and a priest."</p>

  <p>"Zitu." Croft breathed the word in his spirit. Helmor of
  Zollaria was far from asleep, indeed. More than that, now that
  he was awake he was well served. Panthor would seek an
  engraver of stones inside the next day or two, at latest, and
  Panthor would be watched. Helmor had more than one pair of
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Croft's confidence returned. After all, Kalamita and Ptah
  were not the only ones in Berla who played the game of
  statecraft, it would seem&mdash;and each day Naia and Jason
  would be watched by a fresh guard. More than that, additional
  pay would in a measure see the morale of the city's garrison
  restored. Once more as at the noon hour on the day before,
  Croft found himself swiftly uplifted as on invisible wings,
  his spirit filled with thankfulness to Zitu&mdash;the Father
  of all Life&mdash;with a voiceless paean of praise, for his
  everlasting justice, the inscrutability of his ways.</p>

  <p>In such a mood he returned again to Naia, and told her what
  had occurred&mdash;watched her astral fires pale and quicken,
  as side by side they bent above the child.</p>

  <p>"By Ga and Azil," he swore, "we shall not lose him. I go
  now to return in the flesh to Berla, by Zitu's aid inside
  Panthor's limit of days."</p>

  <p>"Zitu go with you and return again with you, Beloved," said
  Naia of Aphur, with the fire of her womanhood, her motherhood,
  in her purple eyes.</p>

  <p>Back, back to Himyra, sped the spirit of Jason Croft. It
  crept into the form on the couch of molded copper and opened
  its eyes. It urged it up a tingle with the knowledge it
  brought and all it involved. It sent it seeking an attendant,
  to bid the guardsman find the apartment of Robur and rouse him
  from his slumbers and summon him to the Mouthpiece of Zitu's
  chamber at once.</p>

  <p>And when Aphur's governor appeared with sleep driven
  swiftly from him, Croft told him all he had seen and
  heard.</p>

  <p>"Wherefore," he made an ending, "we go north from Himyra in
  three suns."</p>

  <p>"Three?" Robur stared. "But, by Zitu, Jason, think you
  their crews may learn so quickly to control them?"</p>

  <p>Croft nodded. "They are eager. In the morn I explain to
  them that there comes a need of haste. On the fourth day we go
  north with such as are able to follow. The rest may remain.
  Also, we take six of the airplanes with us."</p>

  <p>"Aye," Robur said&mdash;"yet can they fly not to such a
  distance. Short of Berla must they descend for fuel."</p>

  <p>"At Scira, at Niera," Croft told him, giving the routing of
  the planes as well as an answer. "Send in my name a message to
  Scira&mdash;that, with morn a swift galley depart for Niera,
  bidding Mazhur send a quantity of the fuel north along the
  highway to within a day's march of the northern border of the
  state. In these things, Rob, lies my reason for calling you to
  me. Much must be arranged ere we start." Long before this
  night he had planned each step of the journey in his mind, and
  he was ready now that the time for the actual work
  approached.</p>

  <p>"Aye." A look of steely purpose crept into Robur's eyes.
  "As ever, Jason, my friend, you are ready. The message shall
  be sent without delay." He rose.</p>

  <p>"We will take with us the man who sends it, also," said
  Croft. "Let it be understood. Once we are over Berla it will
  be needful that there be one who shall understand the signals
  of the flash-lights I have made, since according to my plans I
  shall land a plane in the square before Helmor's palace."</p>

  <p>Robur's eyes widened swiftly. "Thou wilt land a plane
  before his palace!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Aye," Croft answered, smiling slightly. "Who else? Think
  you I shall trust the final mission to another? Wherefore I
  shall require a man on one of the blimps, to read any such
  message as I may give."</p>

  <p>The glances of the two men continued to hold for a
  breathless moment, and then Robur said with feeling, "By
  Zitu&mdash;thou art a brave man, Jason, yet I sense not your
  plan in this. They will but fall upon thee&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nay." Croft shook his head. "Nay, Rob&mdash;and you think
  so, you sense not my plan indeed. Ere I make a landing before
  the palace of Helmor, a part&mdash;a small part of
  Berla&mdash;but one adjoining the space about the palace,
  shall be ablaze. In the light of that conflagration shall
  Jason of Tamarizia descend&mdash;and call upon Helmor for the
  surrender of the ones he holds to ransom, under penalty of
  seeing the remainder of Berla destroyed. Think you he will
  long falter, or seek to injure my person? Nay, he will make
  the better choice."</p>

  <p>For it was so he had planned it in the instant he gazed on
  the vast expanse of pavement fronting the palace, this same
  night when he had hung above it in spirit only. Then he had
  pictured it back by a roaring wall of unquenchable fire, in
  the leaping radiance of which the flare of the fire urns
  faded, by the light of which Helmor of Zollaria might cast his
  eyes up and behold the menace floating above him and all
  Berla, against the sky.</p>

  <p>And so he told himself now once more as well as Robur, the
  thing would be accomplished. In the light of that ruddy
  illumination he would descend to demand a parley with Helmor
  in person. It was so he would regain his wife and
  son&mdash;that Naia of Aphur&mdash;and Jason, Son of Jason,
  would be rewon. The fire of his determination, of his
  completed plan, blazed back at Robur with the light of a
  mighty purpose&mdash;a thing conceived in weary weeks of
  ceaseless thought and labor&mdash;a thing not to be any longer
  changed or swerved from its course.</p>

  <p>Before that light Aphur's governor paled slightly and set
  his lips.</p>

  <p>"Aye," he said a trifle gruffly because of his blended
  emotions, "now I understand thee, Jason. But it would take
  Zitu's Mouthpiece to undertake it in such fashion. And what
  does Robur of Aphur do to aid the success of the venture?"</p>

  <p>Once more Croft smiled. He laid a hand on his companion's
  shoulder. "He watches from the sky for any message I shall
  flash with the signal-lamp I shall carry&mdash;which, being
  interpreted to him by the man of the message tower, he shall
  see translated instantly into deeds. So shall he safeguard
  Jason's life&mdash;perhaps."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, aye," said Robur. "So be it. I shall send the
  message as Zitu's Mouthpiece directs. As for the rest, I like
  it not."</p>

  <p>Turning, he stalked from the room with a gloomy face.</p>

  <p>To himself, Croft admitted perforce that his plan was in
  the nature of a somewhat desperate chance. Yet he believed
  that he had read the Zollarian spirit aright&mdash;felt
  assured that he was predicating Helmor's actions correctly,
  when the final issue should be his to face, that he had
  erected his counter move on a firm foundation of human
  nature&mdash;was counting not overmuch on the mental attitude
  to be induced by the menace of a fiery dissolution rained down
  upon defenseless heads out of space.</p>

  <p>Returning with the assurance that he had dispatched a
  messenger with his orders, Robur found him no whit less firm
  in his resolution, and they discussed all details attendant on
  the departure of the blimps through the further course of the
  night.</p>

  <p>Morning ushered in three days of well-nigh ceaseless toil,
  of practice with the giant aircraft by day&mdash;of an
  overhauling of them, a correcting of minor faults by night, of
  consultations with the fliers in which every step of the
  expedition was explained to them by Croft&mdash;of a grooming
  and testing of the six planes that were to accompany the
  monster dirigibles north.</p>

  <p>Mutlos of Cathur sent back word the first day that the
  galley for Niera had put forth. That same night Croft and
  Robur visited the wireless tower, and Croft demonstrated his
  signaling flash.</p>

  <p>The man, trained to receiving and sending, read the code
  with little trouble, transcribing more than one message
  correctly and then flashing them back to Croft. Then, seating
  himself again at his key, he sent word to Zitra that the
  expedition was about to set forth.</p>

  <p>There followed two more training days wherein Croft gave it
  out that only four blimps would be taken, and those manned by
  the crews that showed the greatest aptitude in their work.
  Four, he had decided, would be enough for the venture, and at
  dawn on the morning of the fourth day they rose like monstrous
  glistening bubbles above Himyra's walls, and pointed their
  blunt noses north.</p>

  <p>Three days to Niera, to reach which the swiftest galley
  took five. So he had planned it. And at Niera he would
  descend. Long before he had taken the necessary steps for
  that&mdash;sending what apparatus he would require to the
  capital of Mazhur&mdash;that it might be ready for any
  need.</p>

  <p>The night before had seen the airplanes depart for Scira on
  the first leg of their flight. From there they would go to
  Niera, and there the entire expedition would once more
  meet.</p>

  <p>Three days, he thought, as he watched Himyra drop away
  beneath him with the gaping, cheering crowds that had gathered
  to see the blimps depart. Three days and four were seven. A
  day at Niera, to overhaul any weakness that might have
  developed in the flight across the Central Sea, a half day to
  the northern borders of Mazhur, the last jump, before the
  final hop off for the planes. And from there to
  Berla&mdash;four hundred miles or a trifle over. He allowed
  eight hours for that.</p>

  <p>Higher and higher soared the blimps. A strong wind raged
  about them, bucking the roaring kick of the propellers. Higher
  yet, he gave command. Higher and still higher, seeking a
  favorable current, higher and higher, until it was
  found&mdash;then north&mdash;north&mdash;where once more as
  always the lodestone of Naia of Aphur's being drew
  him&mdash;north and north. He was going north at last!</p>

  <p>The thought fired him. There was no sense of motion. Even
  as in the astral body, it was as though he himself stood
  silent and all beneath him moved. Overhead the monster gas-bag
  glinted like a thing of silver under the Sirian ray. Below him
  lay the no longer yellow ribbon of the Na, framed in the green
  band of the irrigated lands.</p>

  <p>To the north the Central Sea showed sparkling in the
  morning sunshine. And beyond the Central Sea was
  Mazhur&mdash;and beyond Mazhur&mdash;Naia&mdash;Naia and
  Jason, Son of Jason&mdash;captive in a hostile land. And
  Naia's hair was golden&mdash;as golden as the sunshine that
  glinted now on his flashing armor&mdash;and her eyes were as
  blue as the blue stones upon his breast, marking out in
  flawless outline the Cross of Life Eternal&mdash;the Cross
  Ansata&mdash;and Azil's wide-stretched wings.</p>

  <p>A wonderful, a mighty, a vast exaltation of the spirit
  seized him. He was going to her, borne swiftly out across the
  Central Sea on a favoring wind, as though Zitu himself had
  filled the lungs of his Omnipotent purpose, and were wafting
  him on his mission of salvation with a strong, beneficent
  blast.</p>

  <p>Purposely he had placed the wireless operator aboard the
  blimp under command of Rob. That night they exchanged
  signals&mdash;flashing message and answer between them, as the
  tireless engines roared. The moons of Palos rose and turned
  the Central Sea to indigo and silver&mdash;glinted on the
  monster racing-bags. Far down, their shadows raced across the
  tossing waves beneath them, like the shadows of weird
  clouds.</p>

  <p>Far off&mdash;a blot on the glinting waters&mdash;a galley
  showed. Croft found himself wondering just what emotions the
  sight of the four huge aircraft might cause aboard. At least
  he was sure the moons of Palos&mdash;those moons by whose
  light he had first held Naia of Aphur in his arms and kissed
  her&mdash;had never before beheld a similar sight. For a long
  time after he had ceased signaling to Robur's blimp he sat
  brooding, staring off across the moon-burnished surface of the
  waters which showed on every side.</p>

  <p>And then, wrapping himself in a robe, since the night was
  chill at that elevation, he laid himself down and after a
  time, to all appearances, he slept.</p>

  <p>In reality, he came to earth as he had come the night on
  which he had decided on the step upon which he had now set
  forth. He came and roused me and told me all that had occurred
  on Palos during the intervening months since we had spoken
  together last.</p>

  <p>And the thing fired me, woke in me an intense desire, so
  that as he paused I cried, "Croft, let me be present&mdash;let
  me see the end of the thing, at least."</p>

  <p>He smiled. "Man," he said, "I knew you'd say that, and the
  thing will be at night, three, four, five&mdash;six nights
  after this. Listen for my call then, Murray, and after
  that&mdash;you'll have to shift for yourself."</p>

  <p>I nodded. "Just the same, I'll stick pretty close to you,"
  I declared.</p>

  <p>"You can do it in the shape you'll be in," he retorted,
  smiling. "On the last hop off from just south of Helmor's
  country, I'll be aboard a plane. Rob knows his work, and he'll
  captain the blimps. They'll slip over Berla after dark and
  light up the buildings fronting the palace square. There is a
  bit of country outside the city that I'll make just about
  dusk, and land. From there when I see the light of the fire,
  I'll simply zoom up over the walls and alight in front of
  Helmor's doors&mdash;or that's the way I've got it planned. So
  you see it's lucky you're going to be capable of speedy
  motion, Murray, if you expect to go along."</p>

  <p>"But see here," I objected, "won't it be pretty risky
  coming down outside the city, like that?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "You haven't quite learned Palos yet,
  Murray. I'll hit a tract of uninhabited country, of course. If
  I were a Zollarian, I could pull the same stunt in the desert
  outside Himyra's walls. Now, do you understand?"</p>

  <p>I said I did, and he left me. And that is the way in which
  I came to witness the ending of the duel between Zollaria and
  Tamarizia, but more particularly between Kalamita and Jason,
  the Mouthpiece of Zitu, I shall endeavor to describe.</p>

  <p>Of what intervened during the next five days I know of
  course only by hearsay. Briefly, Croft made Neira on time, and
  came down. The airplanes&mdash;five of them, that
  is&mdash;arrived. The other had come to grief and been
  compelled to remain behind. He did not wait for it, but
  pressed on. The final stopping-place was reached.</p>

  <p>Croft, to Robur's horror, made use of a parachute with
  which he had equipped each ship, and dropped safely to the
  ground. Robur sailed into the north, and Croft, waiting until
  the planes had filled their fuel-tanks for the final stage of
  the journey, rose to follow just after the noontide hour of
  prayer.</p>

  <p>Afterward he told me that the thing held a strange
  significance for him at the time. There was a prayer in his
  heart as the plane soared up swiftly&mdash;a prayer for
  success and the safety of those he loved&mdash;and he knew
  that, back in Himyra, Gaya was praying in a similar fashion
  for Robur, for Naia and Jason, and himself. And he knew that,
  even if in less definite fashion, the same prayer was in the
  heart of the nation whose manhood drove the blimps before
  him&mdash;one of whose daring sons controlled the rising plane
  on which he rode.</p>

  <p>The hour of prayer. Eight hours he had allowed himself to
  cover the last four hundred miles. If nothing went wrong he
  would come in sight of Berla about dusk&mdash;and he would
  keep the blimps in sight, of course. One hour, two, three
  passed with the steady drone of the motur in his
  ears&mdash;four, five, six. Another, and the blimps paused and
  began a majestic circling.</p>

  <p>Berla was in sight from their greater elevation, and
  twilight was falling. Across it he winked his signal&mdash;and
  was answered by a responsive flash. The plane fled on,
  swerving to one side to find the spot where it should lie
  waiting. Like a great bat swooping, it sank and went skimming
  across the darkening landscape, seeking a place to alight. In
  the end it grounded far out beyond the now shadowy outlines of
  Berla's walls.</p>

  <p>Croft leaned back in his seat. Briefly he spoke to his
  pilot and seemed to rest, sagging inside his supporting
  straps. But, as aboard the blimp that first night, his spirit
  sought the chamber beneath. Helmor's palace&mdash;found Naia
  and Jason on the couch together watching the blue girl of
  Mazzeria, who was busy weaving patterns out of straws. Naia of
  Aphur&mdash;and Jason, Son of Jason&mdash;on this night of all
  nights&mdash;safe!</p>

  <p>Croft opened his eyes and lifted his body more stiffly in
  its seat. "Zitu&mdash;I thank thee," he whispered, raising his
  face to the now night-darkened heavens, and then&mdash;he sent
  the call for which I was listening on earth.</p>

  <p>Berla of Zollaria. It lay there, huge, dark, slumberous,
  safe; secure as the night pall wrapped it in all, seeming,
  undisturbed by any alarm of danger&mdash;unapproached by any
  force of foes. For what could harm Helmor's city, behind its
  darkly outlined walls? Four hundred miles of mountain, plain,
  and desert lay between it and the Tamarizian border&mdash;and
  as yet, save for the sending of a delegation to parley,
  Tamarizia had not moved. Dark, silent, it lay, save for where
  on either side of one of its many gates, the fire urns
  flared.</p>

  <p>And yet on the darkened terrain beyond them crouched the
  squat, wide-winged shape of the Tamarizian plane, with its two
  men, watching, watching. And somewhere&mdash;high above it
  rode the blimps, of which there was no sign. Yet they were
  there, and the plane was squatted, watching and they were
  things that, swifter than any method known to Zollaria's
  craft&mdash;swifter than the swiftest racing
  gnuppas&mdash;could cross mountain and desert and plain.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly&mdash;without sound, so high they
  rode&mdash;from but of the blue-black void of the
  heavens&mdash;there showed a winking light. Ruddy it was as a
  falling star&mdash;as it glowed briefly and vanished like a
  fading spark. And yet, seeing it, one knew that under cover of
  the darkness, before the moons of Palos wheeling up like
  racers of the night revealed them, the blimps were stealing
  in.</p>

  <p>Once more the ruddy pin-point winked, twice, thrice, and
  vanished, and as it faded for the last time it was answered by
  Croft himself from the plane. Briefly his torch glowed and was
  extinguished and the spot in the heavens did not appear again.
  Only Jason spoke to the flier. "Be ready, Avron."</p>

  <p>And the man replied, "Aye, lord," climbed into the pit of
  the fuselage, and began strapping himself in place.</p>

  <p>Croft followed suit. The two men sat staring out towards
  the walls of Berla, where the fire urns still made flickering
  flares against the gates.</p>

  <p>And that was all. Save for their breathing, the whisper of
  the night wind round them, there was no sound. Silent as death
  itself was the blimps' approach, and as unsuspected, until
  presently an arc of silver appeared above the eastern horizon,
  and up shot the first of the twin Palosian moons.</p>

  <p>Its upflung rays fell on a wondrous sight. They struck
  against the giant dirigibles, turning them into slowly
  drifting things of silver&mdash;huge, unbelievable, weird as
  the moonlight struck upon them, like monstrous dream
  shapes&mdash;unthinkable bubbles wafted forward on some
  unsensed breeze. So they must have burst upon the startled
  sight of Berla's people, first, soaring high above the city,
  circling as though in search of some definite spot, before
  they paused, appeared to hover for an instant, and began
  settling down.</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" Avron whispered tensely under his breath.</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Zitu's Mouthpiece as though in answer. "Watch
  ye now, Avron&mdash;watch."</p>

  <p>Down, down sank those mighty glistening shapes from the
  Palosian skies&mdash;down, down until at length without
  seeming cause they checked their descent, and hung gently
  swaying, until a strange red brilliance leaped up high over
  Berla's walls.</p>

  <p>"Go now&mdash;in Zitu's name," Croft spoke to his
  pilot.</p>

  <p>The motor roared&mdash;the huge plane quivered, seemed to
  shake off the lethargy of its waiting, trundled forward,
  gained headway, tilted, and rose.</p>

  <p>Up, up in a reaching slant, Avron drove it toward the
  growing radiance before it. And then, like a kite striking
  home upon its prey, it swept above Berla's ramparts and
  plunged down beneath the moon and flame-illumined gas-bags,
  toward the leaping fires.</p>

  <p>They leaped, they blazed, those fires spreading in a ruddy
  band of destruction before Helmor's palace. They smoked. The
  wind of night caught that smoke and swept it off across the
  city in twisting, writhing streamers and billows, like the
  tatters of a trailing shroud. For an instant it half veiled
  the racing plane, and Avron coughed. Then the machine burst
  through it and swam above the square already beginning to fill
  with a running, shouting, wildly gesticulating, mob, beyond
  which on the steps of the palace itself showed a body of the
  palace guard.</p>

  <p>THE fire struck off ruddy flashes from their massed
  cuirasses and helmets, pricked out the livid color of their
  saffron plumes. A captain lifted a sword and pointed toward
  the hovering gas-bags with a glinting blade. The roof of a
  house crashed down roaring in a fiery dissolution, casting up
  a myriad of sparks against the smoke pall of the major
  conflagration, from which a sickly, unsteady light was filling
  all the square, casting flickering shadows over the jostling
  mass of the panic-stricken crowd.</p>

  <p>Above that scene the airplane swam with a chattering motur.
  The milling masses heard it and lifted their faces toward it
  in a fresh alarm. It turned. It circled back.</p>

  <p>"Down," Croft spoke to Avron. "Land me before the
  guard."</p>

  <p>Avron nodded, worked with his controls briefly. The plane
  tilted, circled again at a lower level&mdash;and suddenly with
  deadened engine volplaned with the steady-winged swoop of a
  hawk toward the wide expanse of pavement, to trundle forward
  and pause.</p>

  <p>Before it the guard shifted uneasily, watched its slowing
  advance with widened eyes and paling faces, a slight backward
  movement of their ranks.</p>

  <p>Not so the captain, however.</p>

  <p>"By Bel&mdash;he has given one of them into our hands at
  least. Upon them!" he roared, and drew his sword to lead them
  in an overpowering charge.</p>

  <p>"Hold!" Croft rose in his place and faced the quick,
  forward surge of the guardsmen. "Naught has Bel given thee,
  captain. Wherefore spare thy praises. By design are we come
  among thee&mdash;for speech with Helmor. Put up thy
  sword."</p>

  <p>The firelight glinted on him as he left the plane and
  sprang lightly to the ground. It shone on his burnished
  harness, it struck upon his azure plumes. It pricked out the
  design of the Cross Ansata and the widespread wings of Azil on
  his cuirass. And suddenly the captain lowered the point of his
  weapon in a startled recognition.</p>

  <p>"Thou?" he stammered.</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Jason gruffly. "I, Jason, Mouthpiece of
  Zitu&mdash;to hold speech with Helmor, as thou hast already
  heard. I Jason of Tamarizia&mdash;the one man who may save
  Berla from destruction&mdash;by whose order what remains once
  that fire has burned itself to embers&mdash;may be spared. Go
  say as much to Helmor, and say also that I wait a meeting with
  him&mdash;here."</p>

  <p>Followed a tense moment, in which quite plainly the
  Zollarian debated his course, turning his glance from Croft to
  the slowly swinging menace of the moonlighted blimps above
  him&mdash;those glinting shapes so remote, so detached in
  their cold, almost frost-rimmed seeming&mdash;and yet as the
  man before him said the cause of the ravening flames in whose
  light that man appeared.</p>

  <p>And as though sensing his thought, Tamarizia's Mouthpiece
  spoke again:</p>

  <p>"Think not that save by my order any part of Berla will be
  spared&mdash;neither thou, nor Helmor, nor any of her people.
  That ye behold done here may be done elsewhere, Zollarian
  captain."</p>

  <p>"By Bel&mdash;" The captain sheathed his sword. Seemingly
  the situation was too much for him to handle unaided.
  "Restrain the people," he directed a lieutenant. "Hold him
  securely and in safety until I have seen this carried to
  Helmor's ears."</p>

  <p>The lieutenant saluted. Turning, the captain ran flashing
  up the stairs. His subordinates growled a command. The
  guardsmen advanced, split, moved off right and left, formed a
  cordon about the plane and Jason, facing outward toward the
  crowds in the square with leveled spears.</p>

  <p>Time passed. Jason of Tamarizia stood motionless with
  folded arms. The people of Berla pressed up to the very spear
  points, shrieking and mouthing. The conflagration roared.</p>

  <p>And then the palace doors opened. Helmor and Helmon
  appeared. Slowly and without any sign of undue haste they
  descended the steps until nearly at the foot they paused.</p>

  <p>The Zollarian monarch and Tamarizia's strong man stared
  into one another's eyes, and Helmor caught a body-filling
  breath.</p>

  <p>"So," he said, "it is thou. Word I had of thy presence, yet
  hardly it seemed thou hadst dared."</p>

  <p>Not a line of Jason's set expression altered as he replied,
  "Wherein Helmor heard right. Naught have I dared indeed. If
  Helmor doubts it, let him use his eyes. Let him gaze on yonder
  fire, and lift his vision to the skies. There may he behold
  the cause in those engines with which I have come upon him, by
  which Berla shall ere morning lie in ashes, save I and I only
  give the word that it be spared. Wherefore I dare naught in
  standing thus before him, to offer him the safety of himself
  and people. What would it profit Helmor to bid his guardsmen
  seize me, and thereby lose his one remaining chance of safety?
  Has he any means with which he may combat them&mdash;any cover
  beneath which he shall lie safe from a rain of unquenchable
  fire?"</p>

  <p>Helmor hesitated in his answer&mdash;hesitated even as
  those who know that they are lost. And indeed he must have
  known it in that instant as he lifted his eyes to the heavens
  and beheld there the unbelievable creations brought against
  him too remote for any resistance within his power to reach
  them, yet near enough to bring swift death upon himself and
  his people, as witnessed by the blazing wall of the city, at
  the foot of the palace square. And in that bitter moment of
  realization Helmor of Zollaria's spirit must have writhed.</p>

  <p>Now was humiliation come upon him&mdash;upon him who had
  sought to bring it upon others in his time. Staggered by the
  appalling swiftness of it, he found no words with which to
  meet the situation. And as he lowered his glance and forced it
  back to that of the man before him, Croft spoke again.</p>

  <p>"Nor Berla alone, O Helmor. These things be not of my
  seeking, nor of Tamarizia's design. Yet if I return not
  scatheless from this meeting, not only Berla but all Zollaria.
  as well shall burn. If I return not safely that begun this
  night shall certainly continue, and Tamarizia shall hurl her
  total strength against a treacherous nation which seeks by
  unlawful methods to further her ends. And in that day Zollaria
  as a nation shall go down in a red ruin, from which she shall
  not rise.</p>

  <p>"We sought not war, O Helmor, nor aught save only peace.
  Twice have you loosed your strength against us&mdash;and twice
  has it proved vain. Yet again you planned our
  undoing&mdash;and this third time you struck not as a man
  against men, but against the innocent, the weak and
  helpless&mdash;seeking through them to win what had been
  failed of through force of arms. Helmor of Zollaria struck not
  at the heart of a man as he hoped to Zollaria's and his own
  profit. But now must he face strength again.</p>

  <p>"Yet even so we come not in war against thee or thy nation,
  save in so far as it be needful to prove resistance vain. War
  we make not against the defenseless, the weak, nor wish
  to&mdash;and we hold it a thing for sorrow, were the helpless,
  the innocent, to perish for Helmor's or another's sin.
  Wherefore we come before thee and offer thee peace, O
  Helmor&mdash;a peace which Helmor needs but say the word to
  win."</p>

  <p>"Thy price? Name the ransom of Berla, Mouthpiece of Zitu."
  Suddenly Helmor appeared to find his tongue. His voice rose
  hoarsely. "By Bel, I would not see my people burn."</p>

  <p>"Helmor knowest," Croft said slowly, "I but require of thee
  my own. Let Naia of Aphur and the blue girl, her attendant,
  and Jason, Son of Jason, be brought forth and placed unharmed
  aboard the machine Helmor sees before him."</p>

  <p>"And afterward?" Croft's utterly controlled demeanor, the
  mildness of his demands, seemed in a way to disturb Zollaria's
  monarch, appeared to excite the suspicion of some hidden trap
  in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Nay, nothing," the Mouthpiece of Zitu returned. "Have I
  not said that I come not in vengeance upon thee? Hark ye,
  Helmor, I am not driven by any such intent as that of the
  woman who having led thee into this position now plans to cast
  thee from a throne. Yet, if ye yield not, by Zitu, whose
  Mouthpiece men name me&mdash;thy throne itself and all it
  stands for shall be destroyed."</p>

  <p>Helmor started. Croft's intimate knowledge of a plot
  against his tenure of his power seemed to shake him well nigh
  as deeply as all else. He stood silent, once more lost to all
  seeming in a gloomy consideration, into which broke the rising
  voices of the crowd. For they too had heard from their places
  outside the ring of threatening spears in the hands of the
  guardsmen, and now they cried to him, "O Helmor&mdash;yield to
  him&mdash;grant him his demands nor seek to resist him, O
  Helmor. Let not Berla be destroyed!"</p>

  <p>Those cries beat into his ears a very surge of plaint and
  entreaty. And hearing it Helmor threw up his head and turned
  to Croft.</p>

  <p>"This is the sum of your requirement, Mouthpiece of Zitu,
  which being granted, shall lead to nothing else?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, by Zitu, on the word of Jason," Croft assented
  quickly, making the words both agreement to Helmor's query and
  an oath.</p>

  <p>"O Helmor&mdash;" Once more the plea of a panic-stricken
  people.</p>

  <p>For a moment Zollaria's ruler gazed out across their
  terror-whitened faces. And then he yielded, lifting a hand and
  up-flung arm to calm them. "Peace. Helmor bows to thy wishes
  in this matter. Go, Helmon, son of Helmor, thyself bring forth
  the women and the child."</p>

  <p>"O Helmor. Hail Helmor! All praise to Helmor by whom we are
  preserved!" In swift transition from plaint to plaudits once
  more came the voice of the crowd. "Helmor the Wise
  One&mdash;the guardian of his people! O Helmor! Aye, aye,
  Helmor&mdash;give them to him!"</p>

  <p>They surged forward, lifting their hands in acclaiming
  gestures as Helmor turned and began to mount the steps.</p>

  <p>He had won, won! For an instant as the Zollarian prince
  climbed upward, Croft found himself unnerved. He had won the
  desperate venture. A few moments, a few heart beatings only,
  and he would look into Naia of Aphur's eyes, might rest his
  hand, if so he wished, upon the crown of her golden hair,
  winning like even to another Jason, that golden fleece of his
  desire. The thought pleased him and he smiled, and turned his
  glance toward Avron, staring down unmoved, as it seemed, in
  all the tumult, from his place in the fuselage.</p>

  <p>A few moments&mdash;aye, a few moments. He faced back to
  Helmor, standing with gloomy visage, and let his gaze, run
  past him and up the flight of steps behind him. A few moments
  and he would lift Naia and Jason, Son of Jason, into the pit
  of the plane behind Avron and rise with them free of Berla's
  prisoning walls.</p>

  <p>And then he stiffened. Helmor emerged from the palace, and
  with him, Naia of Aphur, and Maia walking beside her, and
  about them some half dozen members of the guard.</p>

  <p>And now no longer was Croft the Mouthpiece of Zitu, but as
  he watched the approaching party begin the descent of the
  stairs, noting the slender lines of Naia's figure, the
  deathlike pallor of her, straining his eyes for a first
  glimpse of the child. A moment&mdash;a single moment his
  leaping heart told him, and they would be reunited&mdash;one
  moment only remained of the dreary waiting. Naia of Aphur was
  coming toward him&mdash;nay, flying toward him.</p>

  <p>For, suddenly, without any warning, she was free of Maia's
  supporting figure, clear of the guardsmen, past Helmor and
  speeding swiftly in the firelight down the steps. Croft opened
  wide his arms.</p>

  <p>And then she was against him, lifting to his bended face
  eyes so filled with maddening horror that they struck fresh
  terror to his spirit, beating upon the cross the wings of Azil
  of his cuirass with tight-clenched, desperate hands, panting
  rather than speaking, into his startled ears the cry of a
  mother's frenzy.</p>

  <p>"Gone, Jason&mdash;gone. They have taken him from me. In
  the name of Zitu, hasten to Bel's temple and save him. They
  have gone to sacrifice our son!"</p>

  <p>Gone! For a heart's beat the soul of Jason Croft gave
  ground. Gone. This, then, was the end of his scheming, his
  months of weary labor. With success in his grasp he was
  beaten.</p>

  <p>"God!" he cried, not knowing in the shock of the moment
  that he spoke in English, and releasing the grip of his arms
  about her body, he seized her by the arms. His fingers bit
  into the white, white flesh upon them. "But&mdash;he was safe
  with thee when darkness fell, beloved."</p>

  <p>"Aye, aye!" She nodded in desperate affirmation, "Scarce
  had Gor gone when Helmon came to release us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Gor!" Croft bent straining eyes upon her.</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;Gor&mdash;creature of Kalamita. He it was who
  tore him from me, after he had slain the captain of the
  guard&mdash;saying it was done by Helmor's order. O Ga and
  Azil, canst not understand? To the Temple of Bel and save him
  or else let Berla be destroyed."</p>

  <p>"Aye, if he dies, by Zitu." Croft swept her close pressed
  against his side, and turned to Helmor.</p>

  <p>"Thou hearest, Zollaria, what answer have ye to words of
  Gor?"</p>

  <p>And in that moment when the balances trembled with the
  issue of life and death for himself, his people, his nation,
  as well as for the other actors in that tight-gripped scene,
  of every, blended human emotion, Helmor more than any time in
  Croft's knowledge of him proved his right to reign. One quick
  pace he came toward the Mouthpiece of Zitu, and the half
  fainting woman he supported, and paused with hand on sword and
  flashing eyes.</p>

  <p>"Nay, by Bel," he answered strongly. "Not by word of Helmor
  was this thing come to pass, but by the trickery of another,
  because of a plot against me, of which it would seem from his
  own words, Jason knows. Helmon, my son&mdash;" he turned
  briefly to the crown prince standing pallid and shaken before
  this fresh turn of events&mdash;"what know you of this foul
  matter?"</p>

  <p>And Helmon answered quickly, "Naia of Aphur speaks truth.
  Gor slew the captain who denied him entrance to the chamber,
  and cowed the guardsmen with his mighty strength&mdash;saying
  he took the child by thy orders, O my father; wherein as thou
  knoweth he lied."</p>

  <p>"Aye." Helmor's features darkened. "Yet sought to take
  advantage of the present instance to accomplish the interests
  of his sweetheart. By Bel, I swear it. Let Tamarizia say if he
  believes."</p>

  <p>Deep in his troubled soul Croft knew that he did. The thing
  was well in keeping with the methods Kalamita would almost
  certainly have employed. Beaten until the moment of the city's
  panic in her efforts to gain possession of the son of the man
  she hated, with a hatred defying reason&mdash;it would have
  been like her once the aircraft hovered above Berla to recall
  Helmor's words that the child should be given to Bel in the
  event that Tamarizia refused the Zollarian demands or made any
  hostile move.</p>

  <p>She might well have sent Gor on his mission, trusting to
  the excitement to gain him access to the palace, to Helmor's
  former words to overcome any refusal of his demands on the
  part of the guard. Such things passed swiftly through his
  brain as the crowd again took up its clamor&mdash;"To the
  temple, O Helmor&mdash;to the temple. Death to Gor who has
  undone us! Seek and slay him!"</p>

  <p>Jason Croft inclined his azure-crested helm. "Aye, Helmor,"
  he accepted, "Jason believes. This were the work of Kalamita,
  not another. Wherefore&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To the temple!" Naia of Aphur screamed. "In Zitu's name,
  waste no more words about it!"</p>

  <p>"To the temple&mdash;to the temple!" The words became a
  beating surf of sound on the lips of the people. "To the
  temple quickly, O Helmor!"</p>

  <p>Helmor acted. "Ho, guardsmen, attend me! To the Temple of
  Bel!" he roared.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">XI. &mdash; THE TEMPLE OF BEL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">To the Temple of Bel! To that ebon dark
  structure, where in its mighty enclosure crouched the figure
  of the unclean god. It was the one chance&mdash;the one
  remaining hope of a full success in his venture, and Jason
  knew it.</p>

  <p>"To Avron&mdash;up and remain with him," he cried to
  Naia.</p>

  <p>"Nay, Jason&mdash;nay, my beloved," she denied him,
  gasping. "With thee. Keep me in this at thy side."</p>

  <p>"Come, then." He tightened the arm about her yielding waist
  and crushed her to him. There was scanty time to argue.
  Already the guard were forming&mdash;massing a wall of their
  bodies about them. And there was a thing that demanded his
  attention. Swiftly he drew his signal lamp and pointed it to
  the skies.</p>

  <p>"To the Temple of Bel! Descend above it!" He sent a message
  with a hand that, despite his stern control, was not wholly
  steady. "To the Temple of Bel," he repeated, and lowered his
  eyes to find Helmor's eyes upon him.</p>

  <p>"I but signed the airships to follow us to the temple," he
  voiced an explanation, lest the man misunderstand him, and
  found himself wondering if the huge craft would be able to
  identify and find it&mdash;decided there was naught he could
  do to aid them, that the carrying out of the order lay wholly
  in the hands of Robur.</p>

  <p>And Helmor seemed to understand, though he made no answer,
  speaking instead to Helmon. "Remain and guard the machine. Let
  no one approach it."</p>

  <p>"To the temple!" Once more the voice of the crowd&mdash;a
  seething mass now of jostling, pressing bodies&mdash;of white
  faces and lifted arms in the flickering light of the
  firelight.</p>

  <p>Helmor answered the rising, ululation, "Aye, to the temple.
  Forward, guard!"</p>

  <p>Croft lifted Naia of Aphur, holding her terror-shaken
  figure before him, cradling it in his arms against his metaled
  breast. Side by side he went forward with Helmor as the guard
  advanced across the square, breaking a pathway through the
  mass of the people with their spears. Slowly at first, and
  then with a quickened rhythm beat their feet. Their moving
  mass gathered momentum as their captain lifted his voice and
  called a rising cadence. The light of the blazing buildings
  shone sharp upon the spearheads&mdash;shimmered and flashed on
  their glinting harness as they charged toward the shadowy
  mouth of a street.</p>

  <p>To the temple&mdash;the temple! The thud and clank of their
  feet, striking in a measured rhythm, seemed to beat the words
  into Jason's ears. To the temple&mdash;the temple! Naia of
  Aphur was praying. As he raced inside the cordon of other
  racing bodies, Croft caught the whisper of her pale lips
  beneath his own set, straining face.</p>

  <p>"Ga&mdash;Azil&mdash;Ga, eternal
  mother&mdash;Azil&mdash;angel of life&mdash;have
  mercy&mdash;spread thy wings in shelter above him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They reached the street and plunged among its shadows,
  pounding with a dull reverberation of many feet along it. To
  the temple&mdash;the temple. The walls of its banking
  structures gave back the echo of that ceaseless rhythm. He
  glanced at Helmor. Set of lip and narrow-eyed, his features
  distorted by the rage that burned within him, the realization
  of this latest menace come upon him, the haste that had made
  him cast aside all dignity of station, and sent him thus on
  foot in a last endeavor to offset it, the Zollarian ran with a
  steady, unfaltering stride.</p>

  <p>"Zitu&mdash;father of all life&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Croft tensed his muscles, pressing the yielding form of
  Naia closer to his pounding heart. Save for her whispers, the
  clank and thud of the charging body of men, their heavy
  breathing, there was no sound in all the night. Behind them
  Berla was burning, with a lessening glare. Here only the
  moonlight cut in silver bands and purple shadows as they
  raced. He glanced up toward the azure heavens. His
  sweat-misted eyes beheld a drifting shape&mdash;huge, too
  regular of outline for a cloud&mdash;the glistening, glinting
  envelope of a blimp.</p>

  <p>"They follow us, beloved&mdash;Robur follows." He spoke in
  muffled tones to Naia&mdash;and found her purple eyes lifted
  darkly to his face.</p>

  <p>Out of one street and into another raced the straining
  Zollarian guard, and along it, and into another, and through
  that into a second monstrous square.</p>

  <p>The Temple of Bel! Croft knew it&mdash;recognized it, felt
  his spirit once more falter as he sensed its dark mass
  lightened by some interior radiance that shone redly between
  the mighty pillars, pricking out each massive column in an
  inky blackness&mdash;the light of Bel's lighted fire!</p>

  <p>Croft sensed its meaning&mdash;that Ptah had done his part
  and ignited the sacrificial flame in the body of the monstrous
  god, lifted his eyes from the fire-etched line of the pillars
  and found smoke curling in whirling streamers above the temple
  faade, lifted his soul in a prayer that Robur would also see
  it, mark it a beacon to guide his searching, and ran on toward
  the serried flight of steps before him, reached them and began
  to climb.</p>

  <p>Up, Up, he made his way with Helmor and the now panting
  guard. Up, up&mdash;and what sight of horror would that
  radiance between the ebon pillars reveal when they reached the
  top?</p>

  <p>He sickened before the question, found himself straining
  still ever upward, made dizzy by his anguished thought.</p>

  <p>"Ga and Azil&mdash;Zitu&mdash;father of life&mdash;have
  mercy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Suddenly he lifted his arms and shifted the body of Naia,
  turning it more wholly toward him, as though thereby to hide
  from her eyes the light of the temple fires.</p>

  <p>Up, up&mdash;the last step at last. And there, among the
  pillars supporting the mighty colonnade, Helmor's party
  paused. Before and below them, the vast pit with its rows of
  surrounding steps, whereon a multitude might find
  seats&mdash;the idol in its center showed. Men&mdash;such as
  Croft had seen on the occasion of Kalamita's visit to the
  Priest of Bel, were working about the god. Smoke and flame
  curled from its flaring nostrils as they fed its inward
  fires&mdash;and its hands, extended flatly, palm up, before
  its ugly belly shone redly&mdash;they glowed. Heated to a dull
  incandescent, they waited the sacrifice.</p>

  <p>So much Croft saw in a single glance, and found his spirit
  lighten, even as Naia struggled to her feet and gazed upon the
  scene before her&mdash;cried out and covered her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Forward." He spoke to Helmor. "Bid the guard surround the
  idol&mdash;seize the men who attend it and hold them, while we
  make search for the child."</p>

  <p>For there was time&mdash;time yet to accomplish all his
  purpose. Bel's glowing hands were waiting, but not yet had the
  sacrifice been placed within them, and deadly purpose wakening
  swiftly once more in the mind of Jason, drove out his former
  fears. Enough he knew of Bel's worship to know that no
  sacrifice were acceptable to him, unless placed in the hands
  of the god.</p>

  <p>And Helmor seemed to comprehend both his intent and the
  situation fully. He addressed the captain of the sweating
  guardsmen. "Take a portion of your men&mdash;surround the
  image. Let none approach it." Then as the officer, saluting,
  turned to fulfill his orders, he drew back, with face gone
  livid, and faltered. "Stay! Nay, now, by Bel I dare not. The
  sacrifice approaches. Behold!"</p>

  <p>Lifting a shaken arm, he pointed. Croft followed the
  direction of his hand and starting eyes. He turned his baffled
  glance to the other end of the mighty enclosure, where at the
  head of the farther tier of steps a processional appeared.</p>

  <p>Ptah! He saw him, naked in all his wonderful animal
  strength save for a scarlet leathern apron about his bulging
  loins and a headdress of ebon plumes, and the glint of metal
  sandals and casings of metal on his feet and monstrous calves.
  And behind him a body of lesser priests.</p>

  <p>So much only he saw at first, and then, as Ptah and his
  satellites descended the upper tier of steps, Kalamita, in the
  veiled beauty of her physical form, appeared. Kalamita! Woman
  of flesh and fleshy beauty&mdash;Priestess of Adita. Her
  perfect body shone in the light of the sacrificial fires, an
  iridescent thing of tinted silk and jewels, and behind her
  Bandhor and Panthor.</p>

  <p>They descended a single step&mdash;and behind them came Gor
  in his banded cuirass of copper, on which the light struck
  dully, bearing the sacrifice.</p>

  <p>Jason, Son of Jason&mdash;he lay upon an ebon-colored
  cushion, and even as Croft's agonized eyes beheld him, he
  lifted little upflung hands and arms.</p>

  <p>"Ga&mdash;and Azil," cried Naia of Aphur in an anguish of
  recognition.</p>

  <p>Croft whirled on Helmor. "Forward. There remains yet time
  to save him!" he roared.</p>

  <p>"Nay, Mouthpiece of Zitu, I dare not." At the end, Helmor
  balked the issue. Lifelong superstition proved stronger than
  all other considerations. "Helmor nor any man may seek to keep
  from Bel what is consecrated to him."</p>

  <p>"Ga&mdash;" The prayer of a mother to the Mother
  Eternal.</p>

  <p>The thing was a matter of a few moments. Then Croft cast
  his glance upward.</p>

  <p>A monstrous, glistening oblong hung there, slowly turning.
  He lowered his gaze and swept it across the floor of the
  mighty pit, and from that to Ptah and those behind them. And
  then his voice lashed back at Zollaria's monarch. "Does Helmor
  fear then the fire of Bel&mdash;more than Tamarizian
  fires?"</p>

  <p>And Helmor answered. "Helmor, Tamarizian, performs not a
  sacrilege against his god. In his hands be it."</p>

  <p>"Then let Helmor behold!" Croft took the only chance
  remaining. Swiftly he darted down some half dozen tiers of
  steps and lifted his huge signaling-torch to the skies.</p>

  <p>"Set fire to the pit of the temple."</p>

  <p>Once, twice, he flashed that message, even though after the
  first swift sending, the blimp began sinking down. And then as
  it hovered lower and lower, bulking ever more hugely, he
  turned and climbed back with limbs that shook beneath him, to
  Naia's side.</p>

  <p>For that was the thought born of his desperate need as
  Helmor weakened in his purpose&mdash;to flood the level space
  between Ptah and the idol with a mass of impassable
  flame&mdash;to check him, hold him from the presence of his
  god with fire, since he might riot do it with men.</p>

  <p>Lower and lower sank the airship. Like a mighty cover
  settling down above the open enclosure, it seemed. And as
  Croft slipped an arm about the swaying form of Naia of Aphur,
  it paused.</p>

  <p>Paused, too, Ptah and his fellow priests. They had caught
  sight of Croft on the steps beyond the idol&mdash;marked the
  upflung posture of his arm. Their eyes had leaped above it and
  fallen on the glistening shape descending as it seemed, upon
  their heads. Perhaps consternation seized them&mdash;perhaps
  they waited merely to grasp its presence. But at all events
  they paused with lifted faces.</p>

  <p>And as they stood&mdash;the floor of the pit about the
  idol, beyond it farther and farther, burst into widening lines
  of flame. Swiftly those lines stretched out, spreading,
  spreading across the sunken level, as the monstrous shape
  above it poured down its fiery rain. In it the image of Bel
  glowed yet more hotly, became a thing of a myriad licking,
  darting, fiery tongues. The men who had stoked the fires
  within it vanished, writhing, caught beyond any hope of rescue
  in the open.</p>

  <p>And whether consternation had first seized the minds of
  Ptah and his party, it seized them now. They turned to draw
  back before the deadly menace of the sea of fire before them.
  Too late&mdash;its ever widening circle swung its arc against
  them. Ptah&mdash;Priest of Bel, shrieked once in mortal
  anguish, and went down.</p>

  <p>On the steps of Bel's Temple&mdash;on their way to Bel's
  idol&mdash;he and his fellows sank in a horrid dissolution,
  with a grotesquely terrible twitching of tortured bodies, a
  tossing of arms and limbs. They fell and, driven by their own
  contortions, dropped one by one from step to step among the
  lapping flames.</p>

  <p>Above them stood Kalamita&mdash;Priestess of
  Adita&mdash;stood as one wholly bereft of motion, until
  suddenly she shrieked in a voice that rang from end to end of
  the temple, turned to flee, and shrieked again, and fell
  forward, beating at her body&mdash;and Gor, casting aside the
  child on its ebon cushion, leaped down and caught her writhing
  figure in his arms.</p>

  <p>"Enough&mdash;enough!" Croft flashed the signal upward, and
  started running off between the pillars to reach the further
  tier of steps from, whence still rang the screams of Kalamita.
  And as he ran he drew his sword, and went on clutching it in a
  tightly gripping hand.</p>

  <p>"After him! Seize Bandhor, Panthor, and the woman. Hold
  them! Preserve the child!" Helmor roused from the fear that
  had held him impotent in the presence of Zollaria's now
  discredited god.</p>

  <p>The guard leaped to obey the order. Croft heard the pound
  of their feet behind him and ran on.</p>

  <p>A hundred feet, two, three. The fires below him having
  naught to feed them, were burning themselves out. He reached
  the tier of steps down which Ptah and his fellows had gone to
  their death. Bandhor and Panthor stood there, and
  Gor&mdash;his mistress's screams now sunk to
  moanings&mdash;her once lovely body marked by angry scars
  where the spattering liquid fire had sprayed from the lower
  steps and struck her, yet held a white, jeweled shape against
  his mighty breast.</p>

  <p>Toward them, still with his naked sword in his hand, he
  made his way. Behind him came Helmor's guard. And yet&mdash;as
  he advanced, oddly enough Croft gave little attention to them.
  His eyes seemed centered beyond all other purpose, on the
  shape of the ebon cushion Gor had cast from him ere he leaped
  to Kalamita's aid&mdash;that cushion beside which, wholly
  unheeded, lay the form of Jason, Son of Jason&mdash;his
  child.</p>

  <p>Then as he stooped to raise him in hands that trembled, the
  guard flung themselves on the two men.</p>

  <p>"Back," Bandhor suddenly thundered. "Back, men of Zollaria!
  It is thy commander speaking."</p>

  <p>And Helmor, bursting through the faltering soldiery,
  answered, "Nay, not so, Bandhor, thou traitor, any
  longer&mdash;not thou or Panthor, but Helmor rules still in
  Berla. Seize him&mdash;and lead him to the palace, there to
  stand trial with Panthor for his treason."</p>

  <p>Again the guard surged forward, closing about Bandhor and
  Helmor's cousin, and Croft found a slender form hurled swiftly
  against him, white hands clinging to him&mdash;the purple eyes
  of Naia of Aphur, lighted with the wild, sweet fires of
  fulfilled yearning, lifted to him across the body of the
  child.</p>

  <p>His heart too surcharged for words, he smiled upon her and
  laid Jason, Son of Jason, in her arms.</p>

  <p>With the sound of a caught-in sob, a gesture hungry in its
  passion, she gathered him to her, bent her face above him,
  rocking him gently with a swaying of her slender figure as one
  groping baby hand crept up and dug itself into the soft
  substance of her gown. Turning with him to the girl of
  Mazzeria, whom Croft now sensed for the first time as having
  followed from the palace&mdash;dogging faithfully her
  mistress's footsteps to the last.</p>

  <p>Ga, the Mother&mdash;the Virgin&mdash;the Madonna, bending
  in tender brooding above the infant&mdash;pressing it in
  loving rapture against the greater bulk of the form that had
  given it birth.</p>

  <p>From that sight Croft turned away his misted eyes to find
  those of Kalamita fixed on him in a stare of well-nigh insane
  hatred.</p>

  <p>She had struggled free from Gor, and, despite the pain of
  her burns, which in their blindly, upflung course, had spared
  not even the once beautiful mask of her face, was standing
  there before him. And, as their glances met, her tightly held
  lips parted.</p>

  <p>"Thou&mdash;thou," she mouthed; "thou Mouthpiece of
  Zitu&mdash;thou man of ice and fire&mdash;thou wrecker of the
  plans of Kalamita&mdash;thou man like not to any man before
  thee&mdash;by all the fiends of the foul pit of the underworld
  I curse thee&mdash;may they torture thy spirit&mdash;and that
  of her whom I have kept for Zitrans from thee, and bring
  sickness and loathsome disease on the child. May its flesh rot
  and its bones grow hollow like blasted reeds&mdash;may Adita
  cause thy mate to shrivel quickly&mdash;may she cease to
  please thee, and yet cling to thee&mdash;denying thee the
  pleasure she herself no longer gives. May Bel visit his wrath
  upon thee for the sacrilege thou hast shown him. I,
  Kalamita&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Peace." The captain of the guard laid hold upon her. "Thy
  pleasure with this woman, O Helmor?"</p>

  <p>And Helmor eyeing her, answered, "Nay&mdash;nothing. That
  she who has turned the minds of men with her beauty should
  stand thus now before them, were punishment indeed. Release
  her&mdash;let her go her ways."</p>

  <p>"Thy fault&mdash;thou Mouthpiece. The curse of Kalamita on
  thee!" Once more she wheeled on Jason.</p>

  <p>"Nay&mdash;curse no more," he told her. "Once thou didst
  challenge Adita to blast thy fairness and thou did not
  accomplish thy ends against me. And now it is in my mind that
  thy fickle goddess has taken thee at thy word."</p>

  <p>"Aye, peace!" said Helmor. "Get thee to thy palace,
  woman."</p>

  <p>For a moment Kalamita drew herself up before him, and then,
  flinging clenched hands above her tawny head in an impotent
  gesture, she turned to Gor standing stolidly waiting, and
  leaning her weight against him, went with him into the
  night.</p>

  <p>And that is all, as Croft would say, I suppose&mdash;since
  when he described Naia's winning to me at the time of the
  Mazzerian War he brought his narrative to a close with their
  marriage, until I demanded that the end of the war itself be
  told.</p>

  <p>So now one may fancy that to him the real ending of the
  matter would have been in that moment when he stood there with
  Helmor, and Naia, standing with Jason, Son of Jason, held fast
  against her breast, and Maia, the girl of Mazzeria, at her
  side, and knew that Helmor had no longer any thought save to
  see him depart with them in safety, that he and his city might
  also know themselves safe.</p>

  <p>But to my mind there is more to the story&mdash;not so much
  of an individual nature, as applying to the future of the
  Palosian life.</p>

  <p>For, to the ears of my spirit, which had witnessed all the
  crowded events, came Helmor's voice addressing Jason:</p>

  <p>"How now, Mouthpiece of Zitu&mdash;what else?"</p>

  <p>And Jason, answered. "Naught, O Helmor, save that we return
  to the machine before the palace, and depart in peace, unless
  by Helmor's wish."</p>

  <p>"What mean you by Helmor's wish?" There was no sign of
  understanding in the Zollarian monarch's intonation or the now
  somber lines of his face, as the last rays of the fire in the
  vast pit of Bel's Temple struck upon it.</p>

  <p>Again Croft answered slowly, "Naia of Aphur, wife of Jason,
  and Jason, Son of Jason, were seized for a purpose&mdash;which
  Helmor knows&mdash;and the end is&mdash;this."</p>

  <p>For a moment he paused and swept an arm about the mighty
  interior of the temple&mdash;embracing all&mdash;the
  still-smoking figure of the idol&mdash;the bodies of Ptah and
  his fellow priests, now lying charred and blackened below him
  on the serried steps.</p>

  <p>And then as Helmor made no response or comment on that
  scene of sudden death and desolation, he resumed. "Yet have I
  said that I came not in vengeance against thee, nor in war,
  nor for any reason save only to regain my own. Wherefore, I
  say again to Helmor, now, that the purpose he had in mind may
  be served equally in a different fashion&mdash;and that he say
  the word he may gain in peace what he might not obtain by
  either treachery or war&mdash;and I say to him. also that this
  night's work has preserved not only Naia of Aphur and Jason,
  Son of Jason, to me, but to Helmor also, his throne."</p>

  <p>And now Helmor spoke, nodding quickly. "Aye&mdash;Helmor
  does not overlook it. Speak, Mouthpiece of Zitu&mdash;how may
  these things you hint at be done?"</p>

  <p>Having fully caught his attention, Croft went on, "Let
  Zollaria and Tamarizia make a pact of peace between them,
  pledging themselves without reservation to sheathe the sword
  from this hour, nor draw it one against the other again. Let
  Helmor subscribe to this, and Helmon, Helmor's son. Let him
  proclaim the establishment of schools, the education of his
  people. Let him seek for his nation strength through the
  growth of knowledge, rather than the strength of
  arms&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Once more he paused, and again Helmor nodded.</p>

  <p>His face lighted swiftly as he caught Croft's meaning.</p>

  <p>"Aye, by Bel," he said. "It is thy knowledge, Mouthpiece of
  Zitu, that has made Tamarizia strong."</p>

  <p>"And not Tamarizia only, but Zollaria also," said Jason,
  "if Helmor sets his seal to such a bond."</p>

  <p>"By Bel," Helmor exclaimed, as all the suggestion embraced
  burst suddenly upon him. "Come then to the palace. Let us
  speak of this more fully. Delay thy departure as guests of
  Helmor and his people till morn."</p>

  <p>"Aye." Croft assented without hesitation, his stern face
  strangely exalted by the thought that out of this night of
  warring purpose and emotion, peace between age-old foemen
  might be born.</p>

  <p>Back, then, they made their way through the streets along
  which they had rushed so short a time in so vastly different a
  fashion to regain the square before the palace&mdash;where
  only the light of the fire-urns now served to show Avron,
  still sitting at his station in the pit of his machine.</p>

  <p>And there Croft, lifting his signaling-flash, sent a final
  message to the mighty shapes still circling over the city.
  "Remain until the morning. Watch for the plane at dawn."</p>

  <p>Robur's answering flash winked promptly back at him redly,
  and bidding Helmon join them, they entered the palace, through
  which Jason had flitted in the astral presence, so many
  times.</p>

  <p>Yet different now indeed was the situation, as Helmor
  summoned slave-girls to attend on Naia, provide for her every
  comfort. He left her with Croft for the moment and Croft drew
  her into his arms.</p>

  <p>For a long, long moment he held her, sensing her
  nearness&mdash;her dearness&mdash;the truth that now again,
  not only in spirit but in body, was she his own.</p>

  <p>"Beloved!" he whispered, and crushed her to him.</p>

  <p>"Beloved! " she whispered, and threw back her golden head
  to lift her purple eyes to him.</p>

  <p>So for a long moment, and then she spoke again. "And thou
  canst accomplish thy purpose, beloved&mdash;were it not well
  worth suffering; indeed? Thinkest thou Helmor is taken with
  the notion?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Jason, and he paused as he recalled Gaya's
  words that out of his bereavement, his agony of spirit, would
  come riot only peace to his soul, but a possible peace between
  the nations&mdash;and found himself undecided, but his own
  thought of such a peace as he had offered Helmor had been
  first inspired by a woman's attempt to give him encouragement
  in a troubled hour of need.</p>

  <p>"Zitu grant it."</p>

  <p>Naia nestled against him. "Go then and arrange it. I shall
  pray for thy success upon my knees."</p>

  <p>After that, Croft left her, and rejoined Helmor and his
  son. To that same apartment in which Jason had inspired his
  dream of warning against Kalamita, the Zollarian monarch led
  them, and there they took up the matter of a treaty between
  their nations, at the point where they had laid it down.</p>

  <p>Thereafter, while the hours passed, Helmor's expression
  altered; his eyes grew darkly flashing; the deeply graven
  lines in his somber visage relaxed as Croft expounded the
  advantages to be gained in a friendly intercourse between his
  own and Helmor's people, suggested with what must have seemed
  to the two Zollarians closeted with him, an inspired mental
  vision. He proposed the terms of the international
  coalition&mdash;teachers from Tamarizia to instruct. the
  Zollarian workmen&mdash;the establishment of telegraphic
  communication&mdash;a readjustment of trade
  relations&mdash;the extension north of Croft's interrupted
  scheme for a system of electrically operated
  railroads&mdash;the opening of shops and schools.</p>

  <p>Until at last Helmor, rising in no small excitement, sent
  Helmon to summon a scribe, and demanded the immediate
  drawing-up of a provisional bond, which Jason should take with
  him in the morning for ratification at Zitra. He began a
  restless pacing to and fro as the scribe set to work upon it,
  holding his heavy hands clasped together behind his back as he
  paced and turned.</p>

  <p>It was a strange night for Helmor of Zollaria, as he must
  have thought, wherein Jason, Mouthpiece of Zitu&mdash;the man
  who had thrice baffled his purpose, sat with him in his own
  apartment, and rather than crushing him wholly, now, in his
  final defeat&mdash;placed the objects of his seeking in his
  hands&mdash;a strange night, indeed, whereon he owed not only
  his own throne to his singular foeman&mdash;but the promise of
  a greater future than ever to his nation&mdash;greater than he
  had dreamed in all his scheming.</p>

  <p>And then&mdash;the scribe had finished his labors. Helmor
  strode to the table, removed his signet from his finger and
  affixed its seal to the agreement. Through the windows of the
  apartment a faint gray light was stealing&mdash;the harbinger
  of dawn.</p>

  <p>He replaced his signet, extended his hand to Jason. Across
  the promise of a newer dawn for their people Helmor of
  Zollaria and the Mouthpiece of Zitu struck palms.</p>

  <p>And in the light of that double dawn, the fullness of that
  double peace, Jason and Naia of Aphur, Maia, the girl of
  Mazzeria, and Jason, Son of Jason, went down to the waiting
  machine.</p>

  <p>Croft helped the women aboard and passed up the child.
  Cased in his suit and helmet of leather, Avron took his place
  in the machine. Then ere he followed, Jason turned to look
  into Helmor's face.</p>

  <p>"Hail Helmor&mdash;and farewell. And thou, Helmon, son of
  Helmor," he said.</p>

  <p>"Hail, Mouthpiece of Zitu&mdash;and Naia of Aphur&mdash;and
  farewell," they replied.</p>

  <p>Up, up shot the plane, leaving Helmor and Helmon and the
  soldiery to mark its swift ascent. Up, up it mounted over
  Berla, until the sunlight caught it also, turning its wheeling
  vanes like the greater shapes above them to gold. Up,
  up&mdash;the city fell away beneath it as it swung in an ever
  widening circle, beneath the mighty ships that air night had
  waited for its rising. Naia of Aphur lifted her voice.</p>

  <p>Clear, strong, true, and perfect as a golden bell, it
  mounted in a paean of thanksgiving.</p>

  <p>"Hail, Zitu&mdash;father of all life&mdash;and thanks from
  a grateful heart. Hail, Azil&mdash;giver of life&mdash;who
  poured life into the mold of life&mdash;from which I was born.
  Thanks be to thee for the life that is mine&mdash;this
  life&mdash;I hold from thee&mdash;to be mine own.
  Blessings&mdash;my blessings upon thee, Ga&mdash;that I am a
  woman&mdash;my thanks for the tears with which, womanlike, I
  have washed your feet&mdash;not knowing that so I washed out
  also sorrow&mdash;preparing thereby my heart as a flask for
  the mellow wine of life from which now joy is drunk."</p>

  <p>So sang Naia of Aphur, and I recognized the song as one of
  which Croft had told me&mdash;as one she had sung on another
  occasion when she bore him back from the camp of the Mazzerian
  army under Bandhor&mdash;as a chant&mdash;a prayer, used by
  Tamarizian women for one who had lain at the very door of
  death, and returned.</p>

  <p>Here, then, I think is the logical end of the
  story&mdash;with the great plane driven south by Avron, and
  behind him, Maia, the girl of Mazzeria, and Jason, mouthpiece
  of Zitu, and Naia of Aphur singing&mdash;with Jason, Son of
  Jason, held safe in her cradling arms.</p>
