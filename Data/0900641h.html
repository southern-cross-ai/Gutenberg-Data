<h2><a id="ch01" name="ch01">CHAPTER I</a><br>
"I cut throats with an outward thrust!"</h2>

<p class="first">I HAD this story from a dozen people, or thirteen
if you count Chullunder Ghose, whose accuracy is frequently
perverted. One grain of salt is never enough to add to the fat
babu's misstatements, although anyone who for that reason elected
to disbelieve him altogether would be just as wide of the mark as
the credulous who take what he says at face value. Chullunder Ghose
should he accepted warily. But the others are above suspicion, as
for instance King, Grim, Ramsden, the Reverend Father Cyprian, and
Jeremy Ross, all of whom regard the truth from various points of
view as economical.</p>

<p>Chullunder Ghose considers all truth merely relative at
best&mdash;likes to be thought a liar, since under that cloak he
can tell diluted truth unblushing. Consequently he is the only one
whose real motive for taking part in this magnificent adventure is
not discoverable; he scratches his stomach and gives a different
reason every time he is asked, of which the likeliest is this:</p>

<p>"You see, <i>sahib</i>, bad luck being habitual is bad enough,
but better than absolutely no luck. Consequently I took chances,
trembling much, stirring innate sluggishness of disposition with
galvanic batteries of optimism, including desire to keep wolf from
door of underfed family and dependents."</p>

<p>He certainly took chances, and he appears to have survived them,
for I had a letter from him only a week ago begging the favor of a
character reference and offering in return to betray trade secrets
in the event of his securing the desired employment.</p>

<p>Then there is Leonardo da Gama the Portuguese, who is dead and
tells no tales; but his death corroborates some part of what he
said to me, for one, and to others as will presently appear. His
motive seems to have been mercenary, with the added zest of the
scientist in search of a key to secrets, whose existence he can
prove but whose solution has baffled men for generations.</p>

<p>The Reverend Father Cyprian, past eighty and custodian of a
library not open to the public, aimed and still aims only at Hindu
occultism. He regards it as the machinery of Satan, to be destroyed
accordingly, and it was for that reason he gave King, Grim, Ramsden
and some others access to books no human eye should otherwise have
seen. For Father Cyprian collects books to be burned, not piecemeal
but in one eventual holocaust.</p>

<p>Some lay brother peculiarly conscious of a sin appointed Father
Cyprian by will, sole trustee of a purchasing fund, hoping thus to
rid the world of the key to such evil as the Witch of Endor
practised. For half a century Father Cyprian has been acquiring
volumes supposed long ago to be extinct, and it was possibly the
last phase of his beleaguered pride that he hoped instead of
burning them piecemeal to make one bonfire of the lot and go to his
Maker directly afterward.</p>

<p>In that case even pride may serve appropriate ends; for if he
had burned the books as fast as acquired, King could never have
studied them and drawn conclusions. He took King, Grim, Ramsden and
certain others into confidence subject to a stipulation; there were
and are still said to be nine super-books whose contents total tip
the almost absolute of evil. King and his friends might use what
Cyprian already had, and might count on his counsel and assistance;
but if they should come on any of the nine books, those were to be
Cyprian's to be burned along with all the others.</p>

<p>They were not to study the nine books, if obtained, and above
all they were not to reveal their contents to any outsider; for
Cyprian's purpose was, and is, to abolish the very memory of those
books' existence and the deviltry they teach, or are supposed to
teach. (For some say they teach wisdom.) But they might make what
use they cared to of information picked up on the side, and they
were free to deal with individuals as circumstances and their own
discretion might dictate. Father Cyprian, in fact, cared and cares
not much for consequences. He believes in cutting off the cause,
and he is sure those nine books are the key which, if thrown away,
Will leave the cause of necromancy impossible to rediscover. So
much for him.</p>

<p>Jeremy Ross came laughing on the scene, laughed with gay
irreverence all through the piece, and still laughs, no more
inclined to take life seriously than when he faced the Turks in the
three-day fight at Gaza, sharing one torn blanket with a wounded
Turk and destroying his chance of promotion by calling a British
colonel "Algy" to his face. On the other hand, he is as
unconquerably opportunist as when he tramped Arabia, lost, and
survived by means of a reputation for performing miracles.</p>

<p>Jeremy's admitted motive was desire to learn more tricks and
their underlying principles. He is convinced that even the "rope
trick, so often told of and so invariably unconfirmed, in which a
Hindu is supposed to climb a rope into the air and disappear, is
simply the result of well-trained ingenuity.</p>

<p>"A chap who knows how can do anything," says Jeremy, and he
proposed to learn how all the Indian tricks are done.</p>

<p>The motives he did not confess, but which were just as obvious
as the laugh on his lips and the sunburn on his handsome face, were
loyalty to Athelstan King and Grim and Ramsden, a kind of
irresponsibility that makes him plunge for amusement into every
game he sees, and a bedrock willingness to fight every combination
of men and circumstances for the right to be his own master. He has
no use whatever for orders from "higher up," for swank, eyewash,
stilts, inherited nobility, or what is known as statecraft.</p>

<p>"A diplomat's like me," says Jeremy, "only I call mine tricks
and he calls his statesmanship."</p>

<p>It was enough that King and Grim had winded the stronghold of
secret tyranny. Instantly Jeremy was game to make a pitched fight
and a picnic of the business of destroying it; and he was quicker
than either of them at penetrating the outer screen of commonplace
deception. He got along remarkably well with Father Cyprian, in
fact, astonishingly well, all things considered.</p>

<p>James Schuyler Grim is the protagonist of peace where there is
no peace. His passion is to introduce two pauses in the strife of
men where only one was formerly, and so little by little to give
some sort of new millennium a chance. Arch-pragmatist is Grim. He
holds men's lives, his own included, as worthless unless at work,
and his highest expression of friendship is to pile task on task
almost to the breaking point. He, too, resists interference from
"higher up," but without Jeremy's turbulence and with much more
wisdom&mdash;nearly satanic at times; which is one reason why
Jeremy does not always mock him to his face.</p>

<p>Jeremy does mock Athelstan King, because King is of the seventh
generation in the British army and respects accordingly the little
odds and ends of precedent and custom that to the Australian
resemble idol-worship. Jeremy was a trooper. King was a colonel but
is now employed by the same multi-millionaire who furnishes
supplies for Grim and Ramsden; in fact, he took Jeremy's place, for
Jeremy cannot abide the power of purse-strings and would rather
juggle by the roadside for his daily bread than yield to any man on
the ground of surplus cash.</p>

<p>Jeff Ramsden is another independent, who rather prides himself
on being slow of wit and heavy on his feet, whereas he is really a
solid thinker, building argument on argument until he is convinced,
and setting one foot down before he prospects with the other. He is
stronger physically than almost any two normally developed
athletes, but it would probably break Jeff Ramsden's heart to lose
his comfortable savings, whereas Jeremy loses his last cent as
cheerfully as he would win the other man's.</p>

<p>Then there are Narayan Singh, and Ali ben Ali of Siktinderam,
soldiers of fortune both, the one a Sikh with pantheistic
tendencies and the other a Pathan with seven sons. At any rate, Ali
ben Ali is pleased to admit they are his sons, and none denies that
he fought and slew the indignant legal owners of the mothers,
although there are cynics in the crag-top villages who vow that Ali
flatters himself. The mothers' statements (there were seven) made
for the most part under duress shortly before death were not
considered trustworthy evidence in the land that Ali comes
from.</p>

<p>Ali has enemies, but is a man, whatever else; and perhaps the
highest compliment ever paid Narayan Singh is that Ali ben Ali of
Sikunderam respects him and would think three times before
challenging the Sikh to fight, even if a mutual regard for Grim and
King did not put quarreling out of the question. They are awfully
disrespectful of each other's gods, but came to an early
understanding on the basis propounded by Narayan Singh after a
night-long argument:</p>

<p>"If your ridiculous Allah objects to my opinions why doesn't he
smite me? I challenge him! As for thyself, Ali ben Ali of
Sikunderam, thou art worth a dozen Allahs, being less cowardly,
more generous, and not afraid to stand up and be seen!"</p>

<p>"It is a pity about you, Narayan Singh," Ali ben Ali answered
nodding tolerantly. "I shall make a friend of you in this world
only to see you torn by devils in the next. However, that is
Allah's business, who is Lord of Mercies."</p>

<p>"Who is a big joke!" Narayan Singh corrected. "He will turn thee
into worms!" warned he of Sikunderam.</p>

<p>"Then I will gnaw the big thing's belly!" said the Sikh.</p>

<p>They agreed to postpone the debate until the next world and to
be stout allies in this&mdash;a plan which if followed universally
would abolish a deal of waste of time.</p>

<p>"For if I slew you, or you slew me," said Ali ben Ali, "there
would only be half our manhood left!"</p>

<p>And that was a point on which they could agree at once, for
neither of them had a poor opinion of himself, any more than either
cared a rap for Grin's and King's idealism. What they chose to
follow were the men, they being men, and like attracting if not
like at least its tribute.</p>

<p>Burt they were also attracted as much as Chullunder Ghose was by
the glamour of the unknown quantity and the lure of fabled
treasure; the babu being all acute imagination and alarm, they all
adventurous.</p>

<p>Surely ancient sciences meant nothing to them; yet it was
pursuit of ancient science and of nothing else that brought the
twelve together, and that might have added the thirteenth if the
number thirteen had not justified its reputation by proving fatal
to da Gama the Portuguese. And that was no pity, but for scientific
reasons.</p>

<p>He drank too frequently and inexpensively, and washed too
sparingly to be good company. His appetite in all ways was a
glutton's, drink included, and he took his erudition as he did
champagne or beer or curried anchovies, in gulps.</p>

<p>Nor was he nice to look at&mdash;saffron, under shiny black
hair, with a pair of coal-black eyes whose whites were yellow and
red with long
debauch&mdash;short&mdash;stout&mdash;asthmatic&mdash;dressed
always in rusty black broadcloth and occasionally white drill
pants, with black boots tied with broken laces. His face was seamed
and lined with tales untenable and knowledge unfit to be known. His
finger-ends were swollen and his nails close-bitten. His shirt,
which might have been a petticoat for stripe and color, bulged
through the gap between his pants and vest, increasingly untidy as
the day progressed, and he hitched his pants at intervals. He had a
little, black imperial beard that only half-concealed a chin cloven
not by nature but by some man's weapon. The cleft had the effect of
making him look good-humored for a second when he smiled. The smile
began with a sneer malignantly, passed with a peculiar melting
moment through an actually pathetic phase, and ended cynically,
showing yellow eye-teeth. He had no idea whatever of making himself
pleasant&mdash;would have scorned himself, in fact, for the attempt
if he had ever tried it&mdash;and yet he blamed the world and did
the world all the injury he could for refusing to love him. He
always wore a round black hat like an English clergyman's, and
never took it off, even indoors, until he was seated, when he held
it rolled up as if he kept his thoughts in it and was afraid of
spilling them.</p>

<p>It was Chullunder Ghose who decoyed him into the office in the
side- street off the Chandni Chowk, which is the famous Street of
the Silversmiths in Delhi, and a good street if you know what
goodness in a street consists of. Men&mdash;all manner of
men&mdash;go by.</p>

<p>They had an office in a side-street, one flight up over a
Maharatta drug-store, with the name "Grim, Ramsden and Ross" on a
brass plate on the door. The next-door building was a warehouse for
hides, hair, tallow, gum, turmeric and vicious politics, through
the midst of which they had access to a back stairs by arrangement.
But the front stairway by which you reached their office was a
narrow, steep affair between two buildings, littered with
fruit-peel and cigarette ends, and always crowded with folk who
used it as a sort of covered grandstand from which to watch the
street or merely to sit and think, supposing that anybody
<i>could</i> think in all that noise.</p>

<p>You had to pick your way up-stairs gingerly, but going down was
easier, because if you placed your foot flat against the back of a
man's head, and shoved suddenly, he would topple forward and carry
a whole row down with him, due to the fact that they sat
cross-legged and not with their feet on the step below as Europeans
would.</p>

<p>Existence there would have been precarious, but for Narayan
Singh, Ali ben Ali and Chullunder Ghose&mdash;the first two
truculent and the third a diplomat. It is fashionable nowadays to
show contempt for Westerners by pushing them off the sidewalk and
making remarks in babu English that challenge reprisals; so that,
even though King, Grim and Ramsden can disguise themselves and pass
for natives of the East, and Jeremy in plain clothes can make an
Arab think he is an Aras in disguise, the firm's name on the brass
plate would have been enough to start trouble, if it had not been
so obvious that trouble would include a Sikh dagger, an Afghan
<i>tulwar</i>, and the adder's tongue of the least compunctious
babu in all India.</p>

<p>It was the babu's tongue that drew da Gama past the door. He was
afraid of it, in the same way that some politicians are afraid of
newspapers, and it may be that he hoped to murder the babu as the
simplest road to silence. All are agreed he was surprised and angry
when Narayan Singh; swaggering down the narrow passage, bunted into
him as he stood hesitating and, picking a quarrel on the instant,
shoved him backward through the office door. Inside he found
himself confronted by the whole party, for Narayan Singh followed
him through and locked the door at his back.</p>

<p>He stood at bay, in silence, for a minute, showing his yellow
teeth, his hands making the beginnings of a move toward his pockets
and repeatedly refraining. So Ali ben Ali strode up to him and,
taking him in one prodigious left arm, searched him for weapons. He
pulled out a long knife and a black-jack, exposed them, grinning
hugely, in the palm of his right hand and returned them to their
owner. There was no pistol. Then he pushed the Portuguese toward
the office stool, which was the only seat unoccupied. Da Gama sat
on it, putting his heels on the rungs, with his toes turned
outward, whereafter he removed his round, black hat and rolled
it.</p>

<p>The others sat around the wall on bentwood chairs, or otherwise
as temperament dictated, all except Father Cyprian, who had been
accorded the desk and revolving chair in deference to age. Cyprian
held the desk-lid raised, but lowered it suddenly, and at the noise
da Gama started, stared a second, and then swore in Portuguese
between his teeth. None in the room understood Portuguese, unless
possibly the priest.</p>

<p>"You recognize me, I believe?" piped Cyprian, almost falsetto,
his little bright eyes gleaming through the wrinkles and his mobile
lips spreading and spreading away into a smile that advertised
amusement and was certainly a mask.</p>

<p>He has a face like a friendly gargoyle, full of human
understanding and a sort of merry disdain that goes with it.</p>

<p>"Keep to your trade of mumbling Mass! What do these others
want?" the Portuguese demanded rudely. "I have nothing to do with
priests!"</p>

<p>His low-pitched asthmatic voice was an absolute contrast to the
other's. So was his surliness. There was no connecting link between
them but that one, swift, momentary cloven lapse from hardness as
the Portuguese's face changed from one scowl to the next. But
Cyprian recognized that and was swift, before the human feeling
faded:</p>

<p>"My friend," he said, "it was you who tried to steal my library,
and I have never sought to have you punished, for I know the
strength of the temptation&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are a miser with your books&mdash;a dog in a manger!" the
Portuguese retorted. "You break your own law, which says you shall
not hide light under a bushel!"</p>

<p>"It is darkness that hides!" the priest answered with another of
his expansive smiles. "It was you, my friend, who tried to murder
me&mdash;a sin from which I only saved you by being one inch to the
eastward of your bullet's course."</p>

<p>"You lie like any other priest!" da Gama growled.</p>

<p>"No, no. Not all of us are rash. In fact, we&mdash;we all of us
are&mdash;are occasionally careful. Is this not the pistol that you
tried to shoot me with?"</p>

<p>He raised the lid of the desk again and drew out a surprising
thing born of the law against carrying firearms. It was a pistol
built of springs and teak-wood, nearly as clumsy as the old museum
holster pieces but as able as a cobra to do murder at close range.
Da Gama was silent.</p>

<p>"My friend, I have not even blamed you," the priest went on, his
thin voice squeaking with the rust of years. "I have pitied you,
and as for me you are forgiven. But there are consequences."</p>

<p>"What?" the Portuguese demanded, betraying, between scorn and
anger, once again that moment of human feeling.</p>

<p>"Something is required of him to whom so much has been
forgiven," the priest answered firmly.</p>

<p>"What?" the Portuguese repeated.</p>

<p>Jeremy reached for the pistol and began fooling with the thing,
as pleased with its mechanism as he was impatient of preliminaries.
Ali ben Ali of Sikunderam drew out his own long knife and thumbed
its cutting edge suggestively.</p>

<p>"You for twenty-five, and I for fifty years have sought the same
thing," the priest said, speaking slowly. "You have taken one line,
I the other. Mine is best, and now you must follow mine, my
friend&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For I cut throats with an outward thrust," Ali ben Ali
interrupted. "The point goes in across the wind-pipe and the
knife's heel separates the neck-bones."</p>

<p>It was horribly well spoken. Ali ben Ali failed in his youth for
a Bachelor's Degree but passed in rhetoric. Da Gama shuddered.</p>

<p>"Peace!" commanded Cyprian.</p>

<p>"For the present," assented he of Sikunderam, stowing the knife
away with its hilt projecting. For religious reasons he was careful
not to show the alien priest too much respect.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" da Gama asked.</p>

<p>Father Cyprian reached into his desk and produced a little
chamois- leather bag. Opening that he poured about thirty gold
coins into his hand and held it out toward the Portuguese, whose
eyes changed expression suddenly.</p>

<p>"The balance of those," said Cyprian, "and the nine books. You
may have as much of the money as you can use, my friend, and you
may have my share too, for I need none of it. But the books must be
mine to do as I choose with."</p>

<p>Da Gama went through all the motions of his smile and ended on
the usual sneer. "No doubt! If you have the books you will need no
money."</p>

<p>"I shall do as I please," the priest answered, not choosing to
argue that point. "Do you know whence these came? Look at
them."</p>

<p>He poured the coins into da Gama's open hand, and the
Portuguese's dark eyes seemed to take fire from behind. None was of
more recent date than a thousand years B.C., and one or two were of
such soft gold that all the impression had been rubbed and squeezed
away.</p>

<p>"The little bag&mdash;you know the little bag?" the priest
asked, handing him that too. "You recognize it? Yes? You left that,
you remember, with the money in it when you tried to shoot me, and
my servant pulled your coat off. He would have captured you,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Da Gama smiled again, beginning and ending meanly, on a note of
insolence, but passing inevitably through that momentary human
stage.</p>

<p>"But never mind," Cyprian went on. "You may have them back,
except the gun. My servant shall bring your coat. You have been
forgiven. But where did you get that money? I must know."</p>

<p>"Yes, we must all know that," agreed Ali ben Ali's deep voice,
and the Northerner drew his knife again, thumbing its edge with a
kind of professorial appreciation.</p>

<p>Grim, dressed as a Punjabi, had sat watching da Gama's face. Now
he saw fit to betray that really it was he who was in charge of the
proceedings.</p>

<p>"You understand?" he asked. "All that Father Cyprian asks for is
the books."</p>

<p>"And you?" da Gama demanded, sneering again. It seemed to be his
policy to get on terms with strangers by provoking. "You care only
for money?"</p>

<p>Grim dug into the folds of his loose upper garment and produced
a telegram from his employer in New York.</p>

<p>INVESTIGATE AND REPORT ON PERPETUAL DISAPPEARANCE OF SPECIE IN
INDIA. MELDRUM STRANGE.</p>

<p>He passed it to da Gama, who read it and cocked one eyebrow:</p>

<p>"Your alibi?" he suggested, pronouncing the word as if it were
Portuguese, which for undiscoverable reasons made it more
offensive.</p>

<p>Grim ignored that.</p>

<p>"We want to discover what has happened to the billions of
dollars worth of gold and silver that has been won from the earth
during the thousands of years since mining was first commenced. The
cash in circulation doesn't account for one per cent. of it. Where
is the rest?" he explained.</p>

<p>"What if you find it?" asked da Gama.</p>

<p>"If you help, you may have as much of it as you can use,"
Cyprian interposed.</p>

<p>"Father Cyprian wants the nine books," Grim repeated. "He wants
to destroy the knowledge that has enabled certain unknown men for
thousands of years to drain the world of its supply of gold and
silver. I wish to discover where the gold and silver is. You may
have enough of it if your help amounts to anything."</p>

<p>"I also desire to know where the gold and silver is!" remarked
Ali ben Ali, from his seat on a cushion in a corner. "I, too,
desire enough of it!" he added, sticking his long-knife
point-downward in the floor and laying the palm of his hand on the
hilt to stop its trembling. "My heart quivers as the knife
does!"</p>

<p>It was easy to believe him. At that moment his gray-shot beard
framed avarice and not much else, except the ruthlessness that gave
it energy. His eyes contained the glint of morning on the Himalayan
crags. Ali ben Ali of Sikunderam saw many visions at the mention of
the magic name of gold and silver.</p>

<p>"I cut throats with an outward thrust!" he added meaningly,
pulling up the knife again and glancing at the Portuguese.</p>

<p>Then Athelstan King took a hand.</p>

<p>"The same men who own those nine books keep the secret of the
gold and silver coin," he said, speaking downright as his way
is.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" da Gama sneered.</p>

<p>"Because like you I have devoted years to the pursuit," King
answered; and in his eyes there was the sort of steely gray
strength of the hunter who looks up-wind and into sunlight.</p>

<p>"Pursuit?" Da Gama was at his usual occupation, sneering. "Did
you catch much?"</p>

<p>"You, at any rate!" King answered; and Chullunder Chose observed
the opportunity for self-advertisement.</p>

<p>"His honor having given orders to this babu&mdash;said babu
having followed same," he smirked, wiping sweat from his hairy
chest with a handkerchief, perhaps to call attention to the
diligence with which he had labored.</p>

<p>Then he chose to emphasize and illustrate dexterity by throwing
down the handkerchief and catching it between his toes.</p>

<p>"You're simply a prisoner," said King, looking straight at the
Portuguese.</p>

<p>"This," said Narayan Singh, on the floor beside Ali of
Sikunderam, "is the writing of one Dilji Leep Singh, who swears
that he helped you steal books out of a temple, but was never paid
for it. He will be a witness if required."</p>

<p>Narayan Singh laid a paper on the floor just within range of da
Gama's eye, and it was that that really turned the trick. He had
imagination. He could see defeat.</p>

<p>"You may have a fair share of the money, if we find it with your
assistance," Grim reminded.</p>

<p>"And I have forgiven you," added Cyprian.</p>

<p>"But I cut throats with an outward thrust," said Ali ben Ali of
Sikunderam.</p>

<p>"Oh, what is it you want?" the Portuguese exclaimed, throwing up
his clenched fists suddenly&mdash;theatrically. "Am I briganded and
held to ransom after twenty-five years? All right! I surrender!
Write down your promises, and I will tell!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch02" name="ch02">CHAPTER II</a><br>
"Produce but the gold, thou Portuguese!"</h2>

<p class="first">BUT they wrote no promises. It was da Gama,
desperate to the point of daring them to take his life and never
sure that Ali ben Ali or the Sikh would not accept the challenge,
who wrote down terms on a half-sheet of paper.</p>

<p>"Hell! There! My minimum! Without you sign that there is not a
torture in the universe severe enough to make me talk!"</p>

<p>"Same being Portuguese opinion, anarchistic possibly! This babu
risking personal humiliation volunteers advice&mdash;be skeptical!"
remarked Chullunder Ghose, rolling off-center so as to reach the
door of a small cupboard.</p>

<p>He pulled out a gallon jar of whisky and shoved it along the
floor sufficiently noisily to attract da Gama's notice. Father
Cyprian walked out, saying nothing, and Narayan Singh relocked the
office door behind him.</p>

<p>"Advice not being asked, same tendered deferentially, which
is&mdash;" said the babu, pausing&mdash;"give him one drink,
subsequently withholding remainder of contents of gallon jar
pending answers to questions. No water on any account!" he added,
pursing up his lips.</p>

<p>The sweat broke out on da Gama's forehead. He was no hero, but
was gifted with imagination. As long as the priest stayed he had
banked on that unbegged forgiveness, calculating, too, that the
priest would tolerate no illegal violence in his presence. But
Cyprian was gone, and he looked around the room. They all knew, and
he knew they knew, what the whisky torture meant to a man of his
disposition. He shoved the crumpled half-sheet into his pocket and
capitulated.</p>

<p>"What do you want to know?" he demanded hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Give him one drink," ordered King, and then, when the
Portuguese had tossed that down his throat&mdash;"Where did you
find those coins?"</p>

<p>"In the ruins of a temple. I cannot describe the place."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"It has no name."</p>

<p>"You can lead us to it."</p>

<p>Da Gama nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "I can lead, but you will find nothing. That is,
I removed the gold&mdash;you see it. You may search a thousand
years. I brought it all. I am intelligent&mdash;me. You have not
the intellectual requirements. Yet I tell you, I know
nothing&mdash;nothing! Only Cyprian the priest is capable, for he
has books. But the fool thinks they are wicked, and he won't tell!
He is a dog in a manger&mdash;a miser&mdash;a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind him. Tell us what <i>you</i> know," King
interrupted.</p>

<p>"I know that none of you will live unless you cease from
interference with the Nine Unknown!"</p>

<p>"Put that whisky back into the cupboard!" Grim ordered.</p>

<p>Chullunder Ghose obeyed. It was stifling in the office and for
the second time the Portuguese capitulated.</p>

<p>"There is only one course worth trying," he said, trying to
moisten his lips, which had grown dry at the mere mention of the
whisky jar. His tongue looked a size too large. "You must subsidize
me&mdash;support me. You must get those books from Cyprian and let
me read them. You will all fail otherwise. I am the only man who
ever lived who carried the search for the Nine Unknown the little
way that even I have gone. I am the only one who found
<i>anything</i>. They have made several attempts on <i>my</i> life.
What chance would <i>you</i> have to escape them? Whisky
please."</p>

<p>Grim shook his head.</p>

<p>"Then water!"</p>

<p>"Earn your drink," Grim answered.</p>

<p>"<i>Tshaa!</i> Well&mdash;it doesn't matter what I tell you! You
will be useless without me. You lack the required intelligence. The
problem is vertical, not horizontal. All the clues are cut
off&mdash;blind from underneath. There&mdash;you do not understand
that. What is the use of telling you? The Nine Unknown are at the
top. That is a simple statement. Nine individuals, each
independent, collectively forming a self-perpetuating
board&mdash;each known to all the other eight but to no other
individual on earth&mdash;not known, that is to say, to any other
person in the world as being a member of the Nine. You understand
that?</p>

<p>"Each of the Nine, then, appoints nine others known only to him,
and each of whom supposes his principal to be merely a servant of
the Nine. They think the orders they receive from him are
second-hand orders, passed along. Thus, there are eighty-one first
lieutenants, as it were, who think themselves to be
second-lieutenants. And each of those eighty-one employs nine
others, in turn known only to himself, making seven hundred and
twenty-nine third lieutenants, each of whom knows only eight, at
most, of his associates, but all whom are at the service of the
Nine, whom they know neither by sight nor name. You follow me?</p>

<p>"Every one of the seven hundred and twenty-nine third
lieutenants has nine men under him, of his own choosing, each of
whom again has nine more. So the chain is endless. There are no
clues. If you discover, say, a fourth lieutenant, all he knows is
the identity of the individual who gives him orders and, perhaps in
addition to his own nine subordinates the names of eight
associates, none of whom knows more than he.</p>

<p>"When one of the Nine Unknown dies, the other eight elect an
individual to take his place. None but they even guesses that a
vacancy was filled. None, except the Nine, knows who the Nine are.
Each first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth
lieutenant is responsible for nine; and they to him. Nothing is
written. No muster-roll."</p>

<p>"How old is this organization?" King demanded.</p>

<p>"How old is India?" the Portuguese retorted. "How many dynasties
have thought they ruled? They levied taxes and they all paid
tribute to the Nine! If the money the Nine have received during all
those ages had been invested at compound interest the whole world
would be so awfully in debt that people would understand what has
been happening and might possibly wake up. But there is wisdom in
the books the Nine make use of&mdash;one book to a man, each book
dealing with a branch of wisdom. They have simply hoarded money,
letting the nations use gold as it is won from mines and only
taking tribute of principal, not interest. Do you believe
that?"</p>

<p>King, Grim, Ramsden and Jeremy nodded. Ramsden read aloud from a
memorandum book:</p>

<p>"Last year the production of silver alone amounted to more than
a hundred and sixty million ounces. The East absorbed more than a
quarter of that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And is howling for silver again!" said King. "Where did forty
million ounces disappear to? There is some in circulation&mdash;not
much; ornaments account for some of it; a little has been hoarded
by the peasants, but it's less in these days of high prices and
taxes; where is the balance?"</p>

<p>"I have none of it, Lord knows!" exclaimed Chullunder Ghose,
holding up both hands with pious resignation.</p>

<p>"Where did it disappear?" said the Portuguese. "Here is
some"&mdash;he shook the chamois-leather bag&mdash;"but all I found
was leavings in a crack of a temple cellar, where they stored the
tribute a thousand years ago."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," remarked Chullunder Ghose, "India continues
swallowing gold and silver in measures of <i>crores</i> , that
which is swallowed not reappearing in any discernible shape,
contrary to teachings of political economy, which being religion of
West is probably poppycock possessing priests with check-books and
top-hats. Where is gold and silver? That is whole point."</p>

<p>"Babylon had gold and silver," said the Portuguese. "Where is
it?"</p>

<p>Jeremy took twenty sovereigns from his belt. (He always carries
them, they constituting his uttermost reserve, never to be spent,
but to be bluffed with.) He jingled them from band to hand as if
their music inspired him. Da Gama went on talking:</p>

<p>"<i>Always</i> India has imported gold and silver&mdash;always!
But where is it? Some jewelry, but not much; the bracelets of one
generation are melted by the next. A very small percentage
disappears from wear. Of course, there is a little lost. A little
more is buried and forgotten. But the balance&mdash;the accumulated
surplus of at least six thousand years&mdash;I estimate it as a
heap as great as the pyramid of Gizeh! And. where is it?"</p>

<p>Chullunder Ghose blinked. Ali ben Ali drew his knife and stuck
it quivering in the floor again. Narayan Singh breathed sibilantly
through set teeth. Jeremy palmed his twenty sovereigns in a pile,
and they all disappeared except one, which was fascinating; he did
it again and again, and you couldn't tell where the nineteen were
until he caught them out of air in his left hand.</p>

<p>"What became of the gold of Solomon?" da Gama asked. "He had so
much of it. The records say men thought nothing of gold and silver
during his reign. He died, and the gold went&mdash;where? Some say
Solomon himself was one of the Nine Unknown&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who says that?" King demanded.</p>

<p>"I for one!" da Gama answered. "But there are books. Ask Cyprian
the priest. He has them. Where is the gold the Spaniards and the
Portuguese shipped home from South America and Mexico? Where is all
the product of the Rand and of Australia? They took seven billions
of dollars worth of gold and silver from the Comstock&mdash;just
one reef in Nevada&mdash;yet tell me: how much gold and silver is
there in the world to-day? The greatest hoard&mdash;greater than
all other known hoards put together&mdash;is in the United States
Treasury, and it doesn't amount to a hat-full compared to the total
that is known to have been mined in the course of history! Where
has the rest disappeared?"</p>

<p>"That's what we're asking <i>you</i> ," Grim warned him; and Ali
ben Ali drew the handle of his knife back and let go so that it
hummed like a thing thrown.</p>

<p>"I must see the books that Cyprian the priest has," da Gama
answered, looking at the knife and shuddering.</p>

<p>"They give no clue to the treasure," King answered.</p>

<p>Da Gama actually laughed, a thing he hardly ever did. It sounded
like something breaking. Jeremy laughed too, like breaking water,
and palmed all twenty sovereigns with one sweep, instantly showing
the same hand empty.</p>

<p>"The hand deceives the eye!" said Jeremy. "And I've seen written
stuff that fooled a banker's clerk!"</p>

<p>"No book can fool me!" said da Gama, slapping his forehead and
showing the cloven weakness as he smiled. "I know Sanskrit as Max
Müller never dreamed of knowing it! Show me the books of Cyprian
the priest and I will tell you where the treasure is!"</p>

<p>"You're talking rot!" said Jeremy. "If Father Cyprian has the
books and they contain the secret, why can't he go straight and
find the treasure? Eh? We wouldn't waste whisky on you!"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, but it is little whisky that you waste," da Gama
answered. "As for Cyprian, the man is blinded by fanaticism. He
knows a little Sanskrit&mdash;just perhaps enough to pass for
erudition among ignoramuses&mdash;brut he will not read what he
sees. He is purblind."</p>

<p>"I read what I saw, and I know more than a little Sanskrit,"
King retorted quietly, but da Gama was more than ever cock-sure and
sneered back at him.</p>

<p>"If Cyprian the priest were not a fool," he said, "he would have
set his communicants to stealing books from me! For I have the keys
to his books, and he cannot read his without mine. And all my keys
are good for is to fit the locks that he guards like a miser! Get
me his books, and I will unlock their secrets for you in a week. In
ten days I will show you such a heap of gold and silver as will
make you mad! I wish to see you mad! Have no fear that I will
disappoint you!"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there was not one man in the room who would have
dared place Father Cyprian's books in the hands of da Gama.</p>

<p>"Let's see; you have escaped the vengeance of the Nine how many
years?" asked Grim, and da Gana laughed again. He saw the
point.</p>

<p>"Bring us your books, and you shall compare them with Father
Cyprian's," said King. "Thereafter, the books are his, but you
shall have as much as you can use of any gold and silver
found."</p>

<p>Da Gama hesitated. He had intellect, and worked it&mdash;prided
himself on that. Few of the human passions, except drink and
avarice and infidelity, had any influence with him, so he reviewed
the situation on its merits, being candid with himself. Like Grim,
he sought no solace but results, and he would have wondered why
Grim despised him, had he been aware of it.</p>

<p>"I cannot bring my books," he said. "They weigh too much."</p>

<p>"We'll carry them," offered Jeremy.</p>

<p>"Give me a drink," da Gama answered, nodding. It was obvious he
agreed, with a proviso.</p>

<p>The babu poured forth whisky into the office tumbler and
presented it. Da Gama drank.</p>

<p>"We should have an understanding," he said, smacking his lips.
"There was wisdom in the accumulation of gold and silver by the
Nine. Don't disregard that. It all has to do with the <i>Kali
Yug</i> [*] and its end that was prophesied six thousand years ago.
The purpose is to cheapen money by the squandrous abundance of
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>[* The age of darkness referred to in Sanskrit writings.]</p>

<p>"Krishna!" gasped Chullunder Ghose.</p>

<p>"&mdash;to abolish capitalism&mdash;do you see?" da Gama went
on. "That will be the end of the <i>Kali Yug</i> . Capitalism is
the age of darkness. To put in place of
money&mdash;brains&mdash;intellect, that is the idea. To cheapen
money by abundance, not of promises to pay, but of veritable gold
and silver. Money being worthless, brains will
count&mdash;intellect&mdash;you understand me? Have you intellect?
No! Just habits! Have I intellect? Oh yes! But have I the reforming
zeal? By no means! I am lazy. Let the world remain material and
money-drunk; it suits me better! Can you accomplish anything
without my intellect? No indeed. You cannot understand the
Sanskrit, which is a language of conundrums. You would turn the
floods of money loose and create a havoc. Money would be worthless,
and you no better off. In the books the Nine Unknown possess is the
only secret of how to prevent the havoc. It means high thinking,
and that is hard work&mdash;too hard. I say, let us take advantage
of the money, and not turn it loose. Let the <i>Kali Yug</i>
persist! Let us be rich&mdash;wealthy&mdash;affluent beyond the
dreams&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay! There is no affluence beyond my dreams!" said Ali,
plucking at his knife. "I could use a million <i>crores</i> of gold
and silver! I would buy the North&mdash;and build a city&mdash;and
raise a <i>lashkar</i> [*] such as Iskander's
[**]&mdash;and&mdash;and speak not of millenniums! The world will
burn my day out! Produce but the gold, thou Portuguese!"</p>

<p>[* Army.]</p>

<p>[** Alexander the Great.]</p>

<p>"Produce the books!" said Grim.</p>

<p>The Portuguese got down from the high stool and leaned his back
against it.</p>

<p>"Are we agreed about the money?" he asked, looking from eye to
eye for disagreement.</p>

<p>His was that disposition. He would promise anything to men in
whom the seed of disagreement lay, knowing that the future would
hold opportunity. But his wandering eye was fascinated by Jeff
Ramsden's clenched, enormous fist. It seemed to symbolize. It was a
totem. It did not stand for intellect, but it was heartbreakingly
honest, neither Latin in its attitude toward a problem, nor
cynical, nor unjust&mdash;not too credulous&mdash;just aboveboard,
and direct, and faithful.</p>

<p>"Produce the books!" repeated Grim.</p>

<p>But he was dealing with the Latin temperament, which is not
frank, reserving always little secret back-ways out from its
commitments.</p>

<p>"I will go and arrange it," da Gama answered. Whereat Jeremy did
three tricks in succession with a coin, as if by way of
illustration.</p>

<p>"I'll go with you," Ramsden volunteered. "I can carry quite a
lot of books."</p>

<p>"No!" said the Portuguese, contriving to look scandalized in the
way the Latin nations do when anyone suggests a view of their
back-yard. "There are my personalities. I mean, I am not a
pip-show. I go alone. I will arrange. You may meet me. You shall
have the books."</p>

<p>"I have seven sons," announced Ali ben Ali of Sikunderam, with
his steel eyes focused on infinity, as if he were dreaming of his
distant hills.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;they would, no doubt, do to carry books," said the
Portuguese, not understanding him.</p>

<p>Whereat Ali ben Ali got up and left the room, Narayan Singh
locking the door again when he was gone. The others understood that
perfectly.</p>

<p>"Go and make your arrangements. Where will you meet us?" Grim
demanded.</p>

<p>"Do you know my quarters? There then," said the Portuguese. "In
an hour? No, that is too soon. I have books in one place and
another. They must be collected. Come to-night."</p>

<p>"Leave one of those coins with me," said Jeremy. "You shall have
it back."</p>

<p>Da Gama made a gesture of magnificence and passed the
chamois-leather bag. Jeremy tipped the contents into his hand, and
chose, holding up a coin between his fingers.</p>

<p>"What's it worth?" he asked. "You can have it when you like,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Write me a receipt for it."</p>

<p>Da Gama took a crumpled sheet of paper from his pocket and
straightened it out, smoothing the reverse side.</p>

<p>"This babu advising skepticism, as aforesaid! Safety first!"
advised Chullunder Ghose, squirming nervously. "Same being ancient
adage!"</p>

<p>"I get you," laughed Jeremy, and he waved aside the proffered
sheet of paper, which da Gama pocketed again with an air of
impudent indifference.</p>

<p>Jeremy produced an English five-pound note from his pocketbook
and wrote his name on it. [*]</p>

<p>[* A formality usually required before any responsible party,
will cash a stranger's bank-note.]</p>

<p>"Take it. I'll trade back whenever you say."</p>

<p>The Portuguese looked disappointed but folded the five-pound
note on second thought and slipped it in the lining of his hat.</p>

<p>"So," he said tartly, "I cannot make use of that one, since it
is offered as security. If your excellency had another of the same
denomination, to be lent me pending&mdash;"</p>

<p>King pulled out his wallet at once and produced the equivalent
of five pounds in Indian currency notes. The Portuguese accepted
them, and they needed no signature.</p>

<p>"<i>Gracas</i> . To be repaid, <i>señor</i> . Then we meet
tonight&mdash;at my&mdash;ah&mdash;hotel."</p>

<p>He bowed magnificently, wholly unaware that the gesture made him
look ridiculous. Narayan Singh unlocked the office door, and he
backed out, continuing to bow, ignoring nobody, treating Chullunder
Ghose to equal deference, the sneer on his yellow face giving the
lie offensive and direct to his politeness, and he unconscious of
it. He believed he made a most impressive exit.</p>

<p>"He is thirsty&mdash;very thirsty. And he has five pounds,"
remarked Chullunder Ghose, as apropos of nothing as the
Northerner's remark had been about his seven sons.</p>

<p>"Let's look at the coin," said Grim, and Jeremy passed it.</p>

<p>Grim is a numismatist, if a job in a museum at the age of
eighteen can make a man that. They sent him to the Near East
subsequently on the strength of what he knew. He shook his
head.</p>

<p>"It's the same one Cyprian showed us. I've never seen one, nor a
reproduction of one like it. I believe it's older than Cyrene. It's
not Indian&mdash;at least, that isn't Sanskrit lettering&mdash;and
it's better made than any of the earliest coins we know about. That
might be a coin from lost Atlantis!"</p>

<p>"Pre-Adamite!" suggested Jeremy, but Grim was serious.</p>

<p>"I tell you," he answered as the door burst open and Ali of
Sikunderam strode in, "we're in touch with the riddle of all
history&mdash;the riddle of the Sphinx perhaps! Oh Lord, if we can
only keep in touch!"</p>

<p>"By Allah, there are worse responsibilities than seven sons!"
said Ali ben Ali, grinning. His grin sat crosswise of a black beard
like sea-foam in the night. "If keeping touch is all your honor
asks, then count it done!"</p>

<p>"Does a watched pot boil? Or a watched thief steal? Or a watched
door open? Your sons will interfere with him!" remarked Chullunder
Ghose, scratching his nose with an action suggestive of thumbing
it.</p>

<p>"Bellyful of forebodings! They have orders not to interfere with
him," the Northerner retorted.</p>

<p>"Simply to watch?" asked King.</p>

<p>"Simply to watch him."</p>

<p>"Watch me!" said Jeremy. "Come close if you like."</p>

<p>He palmed the prehistoric coin in half-a-dozen ways in swift
succession, making it move from hand to hand unseen, and plucking
it at last from mid-air, said:</p>

<p>"I'll bet a fiver the Don steals a march on us."</p>

<p>"He will steal nothing!"</p>

<p>Ali ben Ali of Sikunderam held up a hand as if declaiming in the
mosque.</p>

<p>"My seven sons are the cleverest thieves that live! A thief can
fool a non-thief, but not a professional. They are seven to
one!"</p>

<p>But Jeremy laughed. Whereat Ramsden, bearded like the bust of
Anthony, unclenched his fist and let go the burden of his thoughts.
He was a prospector by profession, used to figuring in terms of
residue.</p>

<p>"Forty million ounces!" he exclaimed. "Do you know what only one
million ounces a year, say, for six thousand years would
mean&mdash;how many trains of box-cars it would take to move it? It
would need a fleet of ocean liners! Talk of secrecy's a joke!"</p>

<p>"Nine Unknown having kept said secret for six thousand years!"
Chullunder Ghose retorted.</p>

<p>"And whose is the money by right?" asked Grim; that being the
kind of poser you could count on him for.</p>

<p>"The fighter's&mdash;the finder's!" shouted Ali of Sikunderam,
and Narayan Singh agreed, nodding, saying nothing, permitting his
brown eyes to glow. And at that Chullunder Ghose looked owlish,
knowing that the soldier wins but never keeps; sacrifices, serves,
eats promises, and dies in vain. He did not tell all he knew, being
a rather wise civilian. He sighed&mdash;Chullunder Ghose did.</p>

<p>"There possibly may be enough for all of us!" he said, rolling
his eyes upward meekly.</p>

<p>Then Cyprian returned from strolling in the Chandni Chowk with
that incurious consent of crowds conferred on priests and all old
men&mdash;between the hours of indignation.</p>

<p>"You didn't hurt him? Children, you didn't hurt him?" he
demanded. "Did he drink a little too much? Did he talk?"</p>

<p>King and Grim repeated what had happened, Cyprian smiling,
shaking his head slowly&mdash;possibly because of old-age, yet
perhaps not. At eighty years a man knows how to take advantage of
infirmity.</p>

<p>"The long spoon!" he said. "The long spoon! It only gives the
devil leverage! You should have kept him here."</p>

<p>Ali ben Ali flared up at that, Koran in mind along with many
other scriptures that assail the alien priest. "My sons&mdash;" he
began.</p>

<p>"Are children, too," said Cyprian. "I credit them with good
intentions."</p>

<p>"They are men!" said Ali, and turned his back.</p>

<p>Then Jeremy, who has no reverence for anyone or anything, but
two men's share of natural affection, took Cyprian by the arm and
coaxed him away to lunch at a commercial club, promising him a nap
on a sofa in a corner of the empty cloakroom afterwards. The
ostensible bait he used was an offer to introduce a man who owned
an ancient roll of Sanskrit <i>mantras</i> ; but it was Jeremy's
own company that tempted; Cyprian leans on him, and seems to
replenish his aging strength from the Australian's superabundant
store&mdash;a strange enough condition, for as religion goes, or
its observances, they are wider than the poles apart.</p>

<p>"All things to all men, ain't you, Pop!" said Jeremy. "Come and
eat curried quail. The wine's on ice."</p>

<p>"And there you are!" remarked Chullunder Ghose, as the two went
out, illustrating the "thereness" of the "areness" by catching a
fly on the wing with his thumb and forefinger and releasing it
through the open window, presumably unharmed. "Matters of mystery
still lack elucidation, but 'the wine's on ice!' How Anglo-Saxon!
Wonderful! United States now holding greater part of world's supply
of gold, and India holding total invisible ditto, same are as plus
and minus&mdash;so we go to lunch! I dishonestly propose to issue
bills of exchange against undiscovered empyrean equity, but shall
be voted down undoubtedly&mdash;<i>verb. sap.</i> as saying
is&mdash;brow-beaten, sat upon&mdash;yet only wise man of the
aggregation. Sell stock, that is my advice! Issue gilt-edge scrip
at premium, and pocket consequences! Sell in U. S. A. undoubtedly,
residing subsequently in Brazil. But there you are! Combination of
Christian priest, Sikh, fanatical Moslem, freethinker, agnostic,
Methodist minister's son and cynicalist, is too overwhelming for
shrewdness to prevail. Myself, am cynicalist, same being
syndicalist with opportunist tendencies. I go to tiffin.
Appetite&mdash;a good digestion&mdash;a siesta. <i>Sahibs</i>
&mdash;humbly wishing you the same&mdash;<i>salaam</i> !"</p>

<p>Chullunder Ghose, too, bowed himself out backward, almost as
politely as the Portuguese had done&mdash;indubitably
mocking&mdash;giving no offense, because, unlike the Portuguese, he
did not sneer.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch03" name="ch03">CHAPTER III</a><br>
"Light and longer weapons."</h2>

<p class="first">IN their day the Portuguese produced more
half-breeds per capita than any other nation in the world; there
are stories about a bonus once paid for half-breed babies. Their
descendants advertise the Portuguese of Goa without exactly
cherishing the institutions of the land that gave them origin. They
have become a race, not black nor white, nor even yellow, but all
three; possessed of resounding names and of virtues that offset
some peculiarities; not loving Goa, they have scattered. A few have
grown very rich, and all exist in a no-man's land between the rival
castes and races, where some continue to be very poor indeed.
Others are cooks, stewards, servants; and a few, like Fernandez de
Mendoza de Sousa Diomed Braganza, keep hotels.</p>

<p>His was the Star of India, an amazing place with a bar and a
license to sell drinks, but with a separate entrance for people
ridden by compunctions. It was an ancient building, timbered with
teak but added to with sheets of corrugated iron, whitewashed. Some
of the upper rooms were connected with the cellar by cheap iron
piping of large diameter, up which those customers who had a
reputation to preserve might pull their drink in bottles by a
string. Still other pipes were used for whispering purposes. In
fact the "Star of India Hostelry" was "known to the police," and
was never raided, it being safer to leave villains a place where
they thought themselves safe from observation.</p>

<p>As happens in such cases, the Star of India had a respectable
reputation. Thieves only haunt the known thieves' dens in story
books. It was no place for a white man who insisted on his
whiteness, nor for Delhi residents, nor for social lions.
Nevertheless, it was crowded from cellar to roof with guests
belonging by actual count to nineteen major castes, including more
or less concealed and wholly miserable women-folk. The women in
such a place who keep themselves from contact and defilement suffer
worse than souls in the seventh pit of Dante's hell.</p>

<p>Nine out of ten of the guests were litigants in from the
country, waiting their turn in the choked courts, tolerating
Diomed's hospitality because it was cheap. The farce of
caste-restrictions could be more or less observed. Intrigue was
easy. You could "see" the lawyer of the other side. And as for
thieves and risks, where are there none? The tenth in every
instance was undoubtedly a thief&mdash;or worse.</p>

<p>There lived da Gama, pure blooded Portuguese, greatly honoring
the half-breed by his presence. Like the caste-women, da Gama kept
within the stifling walls by day as a general rule. But, again as
in the women's case, his nights were otherwise. <i>They</i> went to
the roof then, where such little breeze as moved was hampered by
curtains hung on clothes-lines to make privacy. <i>He</i> went to
the streets, and was absent very likely all night long, none
knowing what became of him, and none succeeding in entering his
locked, large, corner room.</p>

<p>That night King, Grim, Ramsden and Jeremy went to Diomed's hotel
to keep their tryst with da Gama. They were dressed, except Jeremy,
as Jats&mdash;a race with a reputation for taking care of itself,
and consequently seldom interfered with; surly, moreover, and not
given to answering strangers' questions. Jeremy wore Arab clothes,
that being the easiest part he plays; plenty of Arabs go to Delhi,
because of the agitation about the Khalifate, so he excited no,
more comment than the other three.</p>

<p>Mainly, in India, the religions keep apart. But that is where
the Goanese comes in. He acts as flux in a sort of unacknowledged
way, currying favor and abuse from all sides. There were in
Diomed's Star of India hotel not only Sikhs and Hindus, but bearded
gentry, too, from up Peshawar way, immensely anxious for the fate
of women-folk they left behind them, but not so respectful of a
Hindu's matrimonial prejudices.</p>

<p>So the roof was parceled into sanctuaries marked by lines of
sheeting, each stifling square in which a lantern glowed&mdash;a
seraglio, crossing of whose threshold might lead to mayhem; for
nerves were on end those murderous hot nights, and lawsuits had not
sweetened dispositions.</p>

<p>To the Northerners the quartering of that roof by night was pure
sport, risk adding zest. They were artists at making dove-cotes
flutter&mdash;past grand masters of the lodge whose secret is the
trick of making women coo and blush before their husbands' eyes.
And not even an angry Hindu husband takes chances, if he can help
it, with the Khyber knife that licks out like summer lightning in
its owner's fist. So there were doings, and a deal of wrath.</p>

<p>King, Grim, Ramsden and Jeremy found da Gama's room and drew it
blank. There was a key-hole, but it was screened on the inside by a
leather flap that yielded when pushed with a wire without giving a
view of the room. Some one&mdash;there was always someone lurking
in a corner in the Star of India, possibly a watchman and perhaps
not&mdash;volunteered the information that the "excellency
<i>sahib</i> " might be on the roof.</p>

<p>Fernandez de Mendoza de Sousa Diomed Braganza, sent for, denied
having a pass-key to the room or any knowledge of its occupant's
movements. He, too, deliberately non-committal, suggested the roof
and, deciding there was no money to be made, began to be rude. So
Grim offered him fifty rupees for one look at the inside of da
Gama's room.</p>

<p>"There is nothing in there," Diomed insisted.</p>

<p>Grim raised the offer to a hundred and then pretended to lose
interest, starting away; whereat the Goanese chased all possible
informers out of the passage, produced an enormous key, and pushed
wide the two-inch teak door that was supposed to keep da Gama's
secrets.</p>

<p>"I told you there was nothing in there!" he said, pocketing
Grim's money.</p>

<p>He was right to all intents and purposes. There were a bed, one
chair, a little table, half-a-dozen empty shelves, and a cheap
old-fashioned wardrobe, from which such garments as da Gama owned
had been thrown out on the floor. For the rest, a dirty tumbler,
two empty bottles, a carafe, pens, ink, paper, a dilapidated
dictionary and some odds and ends.</p>

<p>"Where are his books?" Grim asked.</p>

<p>"Gone!" said the Goanese unguardedly.</p>

<p>"Then there <i>were</i> books!"</p>

<p>"That is to say your excellency, <i>sahib</i> &mdash;how should
I know? Are you spies for the police? If so&mdash;" Grim showed him
another hundred-rupee note.</p>

<p>"I am a poor man," said Diomed. "I would like your honor's
money. But I know nothing."</p>

<p>The eyes of a Goanese are like a dog's, mild, meek, incalculably
faithful; but to what they are faithful is his own affair. He is
likely not faithful to the world, which has broken trust with the
half-breed too often for the shattered bits to be repaired. He was
afraid of something&mdash;some one&mdash;and too faithful to the
fear to take any liberties.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the room was dumbly eloquent. It had been raided
recently by men who were at no pains to conceal the fact. Even the
pockets of the clothes were inside out.</p>

<p>"How many men came?" Grim demanded.</p>

<p>"<i>Sahib&mdash;bahadur</i> &mdash;your excellency's
honor&mdash;I do not know! Are you spies for the police?" he asked
again, and then smiled suddenly at the absurdity of that, for the
police don't argue with hundred-rupee notes. "I will die rather
than say a word!" he continued, and crossed himself.</p>

<p>"You know Father Cyprian?" asked Jeremy in English, so
unexpectedly that the Goanese stampeded.</p>

<p>"You must all come out! I must lock the door! You must go away
at once!" he urged. "Yes, oh yes, I know Father Cyprian&mdash;an
old man&mdash;veree estimable&mdash;oh, yes. Go away!"</p>

<p>"Take my tip. Confess to Father Cyprian! Let's try the roof,"
said Jeremy; and as it was no use staying where they were the
others followed him.</p>

<p>"You see," said Jeremy over his shoulder, pausing on the narrow
wooden stairs, with one hand on the rail, "if he goes and confesses
to Cyprian, Cyprian won't tell us, but he'll know, and what's in a
man's head governs him. Better have Cyprian know than none of
us."</p>

<p>They emerged on the roof into new bewilderment, for there were
sheets&mdash;sheets everywhere, and shadows on them, but no
explanation&mdash;only a pantomime in black and white, exaggerated
by the flapping and the leaping lights. Somewhere a man sang a
Hindu love-song, and an Afghan was trying to sing him out of
countenance, wailing his own dirge of what the Afghan thinks is
love&mdash;all about infidelity and mayhem.</p>

<p>"That's one of Ali's seven sons," said King, so Grim cried out,
and the man came, swaggering between the sheets and breaking down a
few as his elbows came in contact with the string, leaving a
chattering rage in his wake that pleased him beyond measure. Nor
was it one of the sons at all, but Ali of Sikunderam himself.</p>

<p>"Where is the Portuguese?" King asked him.</p>

<p>"My sons have him in view. I don't know just now where he
is."</p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>"That's just it. I don't know. They were to report here one by
one, as each watched him for a distance and then turned him over to
another."</p>

<p>"And none has returned."</p>

<p>"No, none yet."</p>

<p>"What have you been doing?"</p>

<p>"By Allah! Quarreling with Hindus. If you <i>sahibs</i> had not
come there is one who might have found his manhood presently and
made sport&mdash; "</p>

<p>"Have you watched da Gama's room?" demanded King.</p>

<p>"Nay, why should I? Who should watch a bat's nest! I have held
the roof, where my sons may find me."</p>

<p>"Then you don't know who, or how many men went to the
Portuguese's room?" Ramsden asked him.</p>

<p>"Ask the Prophet! How should I know! You heard me say I kept
roof," he retorted. He had a notion that Ramsden was a subordinate
who might be snubbed, because he said less than the others.</p>

<p>"Are your sons as wide-awake as you are?" Ramsden asked; and
Jeremy, seeing his friend's fist, drew deductions; he whistled
softly and stood aside.</p>

<p>"My sons are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Seven Sleepers!" Jeff suggested, finishing the sentence for
him; which was cartel and defiance in the raw code of Sikunderam,
although Ramsden hardly knew that yet.</p>

<p>He learned it then. Ali whipped his knife out and sprang, being
due some education too.</p>

<p>The knife went whinnying through the air and pierced a sheet,
where it knocked a Hindu lantern out and was recovered presently.
Before a hand could interfere or a word restrain them Ali and
Ramsden were at grips. The hairy Northerner within the space of ten
grunts lost his footing and began to know the feel of helplessness;
for Ramsden's strength is as prodigious as his calmness in
emergency.</p>

<p>As easily as he had wrenched the knife away Jeff whirled the
Afghan off his feet and shook him, the way a terrier shakes a rat,
making his teeth rattle and a couple of hidden knives, some
cartridges and a little money go scattering along the
roof&mdash;shook him until all the kick was out of him&mdash;shook
him until his backbone ached and even his desperate fingers,
weakening, ceased from clawing for a hold.</p>

<p>Then, holding him with one hand by the throat so that he
gurgled, Jeff set him on his feet, reserving his other fist for
such necessity as might arise.</p>

<p>"This had to come," he said. "Now&mdash;you know
English&mdash;are we friends or enemies?"</p>

<p>He let go with a laugh and shoved Ali back on to his heels,
ready to grip again if the other should choose enmity.</p>

<p>"By Allah! Wait until my sons learn this!" gasped Ali, rubbing
the throat under his beard where Jeff's thumb had inserted
itself.</p>

<p>"I will lick them two at a time when their turn comes. Now's
your turn. What's <i>your</i> answer?"</p>

<p>Ali looked in vain for a hint of sympathy. The others stood
back, giving the man of their own race full opportunity. There was
nothing for Ali ben Ali to do but capitulate or fight. He did not
stomach either course contentedly.</p>

<p>"If I say friend you will think I am a coward," he retorted.</p>

<p>"If you say enemy, I will know you are a fool!" said Ramsden,
laughing; and that was additional cause for offense, for whatever
you do you must not laugh when you speak of weighty issues with
Sikunderam.</p>

<p>"You laugh at me? By&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ramsden realized his error in the nick of time. Sikunderam would
submit to being thrown off the roof rather than be laughed at.</p>

<p>"I jested with the thought that you could be a fool," Jeff
answered.</p>

<p>It was lame, but it just limped. It gave the Northerner his
chance to back down gracefully.</p>

<p>"By Allah, I am friend or enemy! Nothing by halves with me!"
said Ali. "I am not afraid of life or death, so take your
choice!"</p>

<p>"No, <i>your</i> choice," Jeff answered.</p>

<p>"Mine? Well, I have enemies and by Allah a friend is as scarce
as an honest woman! Let these be witnesses. I call you friend!"</p>

<p>"Shake hands," said Ramsden, and Ali shook, a little warily
because of the strength of the grip he had felt.</p>

<p>"You have the best of the bargain," he said, striving to grin,
not finding it too easy, for he passed in his own land for a man
who brooked no insult. "You are one man and I eight, for I have
seven sons!"</p>

<p>"If they're included," answered Jeff, "that saves my thrashing
them!"</p>

<p>"They <i>are</i> included, for the sake of thy great thews,"
said Ali. "Now they are yours as well as mine. Your honor is
theirs, and theirs yours. We become nine!"</p>

<p>"Nine again!" laughed Jeremy. "If anyone were
superstitious&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Jeff thought of a superstition, and of Ali's knife that had gone
slithering through the sheet and smashed a lamp. The Northern knife
is more than weapon. It is emblem, sacrificial tool, insignia of
manhood, keeper of the faith, in one. Jeff set out to find the
knife and give it back, doing the handsome thing rather more
effectively because of clumsiness.</p>

<p>Seizing a handful of the Hindu's. slit sheet, he tore the whole
thing down, disclosing two inquisitively angry women and a man. The
man was stout, and could not speak for indignation, but was not so
bereft of his senses that he did not know the value of a
silver-inlaid Khyber knife.</p>

<p>Jeff threw the sheet over the women, solving that part of the
problem with accustomed common sense, and solved the other with his
toe, inserting it under the indignant Hindu, who was exactly wide
enough of beam to hover the whole weapon under him diagonally as he
sat still with his legs crossed. Jeff seized the long knife, picked
up a corner of the bobbing sheet, pushed the Hindu under it to join
his women-folk, and offered the knife to Ali, hilt-first.</p>

<p>"Thou art my brother!" exclaimed Ali, minded to grow eloquent.
Emotion urged him to express his fundamental creed, and the easiest
thing in the world that minute would have been to start him
slitting Hindu throats. "Together thou and I will beard the Nine
Unknown!" he boasted. "We nine will show the rest the way! By
Allah&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was working himself up to prodigies of boasting, to be
followed certainly by equally prodigious feats, for that is how
swashbuckling propagates itself; and no mistake is greater than to
think swashbuckling is unimportant; the world's red history has
been written with its sword- points.</p>

<p>"Thou and I&mdash;"</p>

<p>But there came interruption. One of his sons arrived, striding
like a Hillman up the stairs and touching nothing with his
garments, as a cat can go through undergrowth. A young man, with
his beard not more than quilling out.</p>

<p>"Now we shall know!" said Ali, and King took the youngster's
elbow, swinging him into the midst, where he stood
self-consciously.</p>

<p>"Where is the Portuguese?" King asked him. "The Portuguese?"</p>

<p>Ali of Sikunderam, magnificently posing, scratched his beard and
grew increasingly aware of anti-climax as the meaning of the
question was explained. The youngest of the seven sons with his
spurs to win and no more than a murder yet to his credit seemed to
be lagging behind opportunity&mdash;forgot&mdash;was stupid.</p>

<p>"Oh! Ah! Yes. That little yellow man&mdash;him with the little
black beard and the black coat&mdash;da Gama&mdash;him you mean?
How should I know where he is? Oh yes, I followed him a little way.
But there were others, who left this roost with him, carrying books
and rolls and things like that. One beckoned me and ordered me to
carry books. Hah! He was a Hindu by the look of him, a man in a
yellow smock. Having received my answer, which was a good one, he
acknowledged his mistake and paid me a compliment. He said he had
not understood. He had been told that porters and dependable guards
would come, and had mistaken me for a porter. He asked my
forgiveness, standing in mid-street with his arms full of musty
books&mdash;what sort of books? Allah! How should I know! Not a
Koran among them, you may be sure of that!&mdash;I wasn't
interested in his books&mdash;He said that men would soon come from
a house in the next street, who would seek to kill him, so would I
go to that house&mdash;he described it to me, and an evil place it
is&mdash;and obstruct the men who came out, quarreling if need be?
Well&mdash;that was a man's work, and I went. I have just come from
there."</p>

<p>"What of da Gama? What happened? Did you see the
Portuguese?"</p>

<p>The questions came like pistol-shots in several
languages&mdash;English, Punjabi, Pushtu, Hindustanee.</p>

<p>"No. I don't know what became of the Portuguese. There was a
woman there&mdash;inside. I followed her in. Men came later, and I
hamstrung one of them! When I can find my brothers we will all go
to that house, and there will be happenings!"</p>

<p>There was nothing to be said. Not even Ali spoke a word. The
youngster went rambling on, inventing things he might have said and
deeds he might have done if he had thought of them at the time,
until it slowly dawned on him that there was something lacking of
enthusiasm in his audience. Ali did not even trust himself to utter
a rebuke, and none else cared to. The vibrations of bitter
disappointment&mdash;if that is what they are&mdash;made themselves
felt at last, and the young man backed away, explaining&mdash;to
himself&mdash;to the night at large:</p>

<p>"How should I have known? The man said <i>he</i> would carry
books, and would I do the dangerous work? Am I a coward? How could
I refuse him? And besides&mdash;"</p>

<p>There came two others of the seven&mdash;older men&mdash;hard
breathing, breaking out in sweat, and anxious for news of Abdullah
the youngest. They had seen nothing of the Portuguese at all. In
accordance with a plan&mdash;a "perfect" plan as they explained
it&mdash;they had waited in the appointed shadows to see the
Portuguese go by. There were only six streets he could take, and
they had watched each one, leaving the youngest to tag along behind
the Portuguese and act as communicating link. Whichever way the
Portuguese should take, the brother whom he passed would follow;
and Abdullah, the youngest, would run to inform the others. The
plan was perfect. The Prophet himself could not have devised a
better one.</p>

<p>But Abdullah had not come. And another man <i>had</i> come, who
said Abdullah was lying belly-upward of a knife-thrust in another
street. So. They went to see, Suliman first finding Ahmed, so as to
have company and help in case of a brawl. Not finding Abdullah they
had come back.</p>

<p>"There is Abdullah," remarked Ali dryly. "Beat him!"</p>

<p>Which they did. Like the immortal Six Hundred at Balaclava,
theirs not to reason why. They beat him to the scandal of a whole
community that bivouacked on one roof, and rival roofs with no such
violence to entertain them cat-called comment to and fro, casting
aspersions on the house and good name of Fernandez de Mendoza de
Sousa Diomed Braganza, who could not endure that in silence,
naturally. He came up on the roof to investigate.</p>

<p>Running into King and cannoning into Grim off Ramsden, Diomed
recognized the strangers who had invaded his hotel, paying money
for unprofitable answers, and undoubtedly not sent by the police.
That was enough. The stranger is the man to turn on, because the
crowd is sure to back you up. Besides, he had their hundred rupees,
which probably exhausted that source of revenue&mdash;and the dry
cow to the butcher, every time!</p>

<p>Striking an attitude that would have cheapened Hector on the
walls of Troy with his straight black hair abristle like a
parokeet's crest, Diomed Braganza called on the "honorable guests
of his hotel" to "come and throw robbers off the roof,"&mdash;a
dangerous summons on a hot night in a land where passion lies about
skin deep and nearly all folk have a bone to pick with
Providence.</p>

<p>There had been enough North country horse-play, and enough meek
tolerance for once. The women's voices chattered like a hennery
aroused at night, and the men responded, from instinct and emotion,
which combine into the swiftness and the fury of a typhoon.</p>

<p>"I am your servant! I have tried to make you comfortable! These
ruffians are too many for me!" shouted Diomed. "Come and help me,
noblemen&mdash;my guests!"</p>

<p>They came with a rush, the nearest hesitating under cover of the
flapping sheets until they saw and felt pressure behind them and
the dam went down, not in a tide of courage but of anger with the
racial rage on top, which is the swiftest of all, and the
fiercest.</p>

<p>That was no time to argue. Ramsden took Diomed by thigh and
shoulder, raised him overhead, and hurled him screaming and kicking
into the thick of the assault, to create a diversion if the
half-breed had it in him. And he hadn't! He had shot his bolt and
served his minute. Three or four went down under his impact, but
the rest ignored him as the spate screams past an obstacle. And
there were knives&mdash;clubs&mdash;things thrown. Over and through
and under all the noise there was a penetrating voice that prodded
at the seat of anger:</p>

<p>"They are spies! They are government agents! <i>Bande
Materam</i> !" [*]</p>

<p>[* Hail Motherland!&mdash;the slogan of the Indian
nationalist.]</p>

<p>Ramsden held the stairhead for the others to back down one by
one, King dragging Ali ben Ali by wrist and neck to keep him from
using his Khyber knife that according to his own account of it had
leaped from the sheath unbidden. (Ali was not the first, at that,
to blame his true reactions on to untrue circumstance.) And even
so, King only held him as you hold a hound in leash, until the
moment&mdash;which occurred when Grim and Jeremy fell backward down
the stairs together, struck by a bed hurled at random; wooden frame
and loose, complaining springs that whirred like the devil in
action. King dodged to avoid the thing, and Ali cut loose to uphold
the testy honor of Sikunderam.</p>

<p>So there was a scrimmage for a minute at the stairhead that beat
football, Grim and Jeremy returning, forcing their way upward to
stand with their friends, and the others all in one another's way
as each insisted on retreating last and all except Ali helped to
plug the narrow exit. They had Ali's sons in the midst of them, for
precaution, but that arrangement did not last long. Ali's Khyber
knife was whickering and working in the dark a stride or two ahead,
and someone reached Ali with a long stick, drawing blood. Ali
yelled&mdash;not a call for help exactly, yet the same thing,
"<i>Akbar! Allaho akbar</i> !" the challenging, unanswerable
battle-yell of Islam, naming two truths, one implied&mdash;that
"God is great" and that the witness of it means to die there
fighting.</p>

<p>Might as well have tried to hold a typhoon then as Ali's three
sons. There was one who had been beaten, with his pride, all raw,
aspiring to be comforted in anybody's blood. He broke first, but
the other two were only a fraction of a second after him, and there
was a fight joined in the dark a dozen feet ahead, where men hurled
broken lanterns, bed-legs, copper cooking-pots, friend hitting
friend&mdash;where a fool with a whistling chain lashed right and
left&mdash;and answering the "<i>Akbar! Akbar! Allaho akbar</i> !"
of Sikunderam there rose and fell the "<i>Bande Materam</i> !" of
someone prodding Sikh and Hindu passion.</p>

<p>"Hail motherland!" You can stir the lees of almost any crowd
with that cry. Thought of retreat had to go to the winds as King,
Grim, Ramsden and Jeremy hurled themselves into the fray to
disentangle Ali and his illegitimates, if possible&mdash;as all
things, of course, are possible to men whose guts are in the right
place.</p>

<p>Possible, but not so easy! It was dark, for one thing; all the
lamps were smashed that had not been extinguished by the women, and
Ali had deliberately struck to kill at least a dozen times, using
the quick, upturning thrust that lets a victim's bowels out. There
was blood in quantity that made the foot slip on the roof and,
though it was impossible to see how many he had hit&mdash;and his
own count of a hundred was ridiculous&mdash;there was no doubt of
the rage for retaliation. The men in front were yelling to the men
behind for light and longer weapons, and three or four came running
with a pole like a phalanx-spear, while shouts from below announced
that some had fallen off the roof.</p>

<p>Another shout, worse, wilder, turned that shambles into panic in
which women fought men with their long pins for a footing on the
stair.</p>

<p>"Fire!" And the acrid, stringing smell of it before the cry had
died away and left one man&mdash;Grim&mdash;aware that he who had
started the "<i>Bande Materam</i> " and he who had cried "Fire!"
were the same! It was the note of cynicism&mdash;the mechanical,
methodical, exactly timed note&mdash;the note of near-contemptuous
understanding that informed Grin.</p>

<p>Not that information did him any good, just then. There was a
rush of panic-stricken brutes, plunging deathward in the lust for
mere life, screaming, stripping, scrambling, striking, tearing at
the clothing of the ranks ahead; and the half-inch iron pipe that
did for stairhead railing went down like a straw before it, so that
men, women, children poured into the opening like meat into a
hopper and there jammed, filling the jaws of death too fast! Others
leaped on top of that, hoping to unplug the opening by impact, or
perhaps beyond hope, crazed. There wasn't anything to do that could
be done. No seven men in all the earth could tame that
rush&mdash;not even Ramsden, who fought like old Horatius on the
bridge across the Tiber, and was borne hack on his heels until he
swayed above the street and saved himself by a side leap along the
low parapet.</p>

<p>Then the smoke came, billowing upward all around the roof, and a
scream arose from the people jammed in the stairhead&mdash;song of
a charnel-house!&mdash;hymn of the worst death!&mdash;and an
obbligato made of crackling. Then the smell, as human flesh took
fire, worse even than the Screaming and the roar of flames!</p>

<p>Through all that ran a
bellowing&mdash;incessant&mdash;everlastingly repeated&mdash;on
another note than the mob-yell from the street and the brazen gong
of the arriving firemen&mdash;penetrating through the scream and
the increasing crash of timbers&mdash;giving a direction through
the choking smoke as a fog-horn does at sea.</p>

<p>"Jimgrim! Oh, J-i-m-g-r-i-m! Oh, J-i-m-g-r-i-m! It is
I&mdash;Narayan Singh! Come this way, J-i-m-g-r-i-m!"</p>

<p>Over and over again, unvarying, on one note, nasal, recognizable
at last as bellowed through the brass horn of a
phonograph&mdash;the summons of a sane man in a sea of fear!</p>

<p>Grim gathered the others. There was light now and a man could
see, for the flames had burst the roof. Thirty or forty more of
Diomed Braganza's guests swooped this and that way in a herd like
mercury on a tipping plate, and one cried that the bellowing
through the trumpet was the voice of God! That was the end, of
course. Fatalism multiplied itself with fear and they leaped,
hand-in-hand some of them, some dead before they reached the street
and others killing those they fell on. Sixty feet from coping down
to pavement&mdash;plenty for the Providence that governs such
things!</p>

<p>"Jimgrim! Oh, J-i-m-g-r-i-m! Oh, J-i-m-g-r-i-m! It is
I&mdash;Narayan Singh! Come this way, J-i-m-g-r-i-m!"</p>

<p>Grim took to his heels and the others after him, running along
the two-foot parapet because the roof was hot and smoking
through&mdash;leaping the right-angle corner to avoid a flame that
licked like a long tongue&mdash;making for the middle of the rear
end, where the smoke blew back, away from them, and they saw a man
like the spirit of the black night shouting through a brass
phonograph horn thirty feet away from a roof across the narrow
street.</p>

<p>"Jimgrim! Oh, J-i-m-g-r-i-m!"</p>

<p>"Here we all are! What now, Narayan Singh!"</p>

<p>"<i>Sahib</i> , there is a ladder below you! Reach for it!"</p>

<p>Too low! Too late! The ladder lay dimly visible along a ledge
ten feet below. They saw it as the roof gave in and a gust of flame
scorched upward like the breath of a titanic cannon, illuminating
acres. All the secret tubes for conveying drinks and information in
the "Star of India" were carrying draft now. The core of the
inferno was white-hot. King's and Ali's clothes began to burn; the
others were singeing. Narayan Singh's voice through the brass horn
bellowed everlastingly, emphasizing one idea, over and over:</p>

<p>"For the love of God, <i>sahib</i> , reach that ladder!"</p>

<p>The ladder was out of reach.</p>

<p>"I don't cook good!" laughed Jeremy, amused with life even in
the face of that death. "I'd sooner die raw! Anybody strong enough
to hold my feet? Not you, Jeff&mdash;you take his&mdash;it calls
for two of us. Hurry, some one!"</p>

<p>Jeremy leaned on his stomach over the parapet. King seized the
long Arab girdle, knotted that around his own shoulders so that the
two of them were lashed together in one risk, and laid bold of
Jeremy's heels.</p>

<p>"Over you go, Australia! You belong down-under!"</p>

<p>Jeremy laughed and scrambled over. Ramsden laid hold of King's
ankles, setting his own knees against the parapet; and to the tune
of crackling flame and crashing masonry the living rope went
down&mdash;not slowly, for there wasn't time&mdash;so fast that to
the straining eyes in the street it almost looked as if they fell,
and a scream of delighted dread arose to greet them.</p>

<p>Jeremy reached the ladder, grabbed it, and it came away, adding
its weight and awkwardness to the strain on Ramsden.</p>

<p>"Haul away!" yelled Jeremy&mdash;not laughing now.</p>

<p>The turn-table motion of the ladder in mid-air was swinging him
and King.</p>

<p>Jeff Ramsden's loins and back and arms cracked as he strained to
the load. The others, obeying Grim, held him by the waist and
thighs to lend him leverage, Grim holding his feet, in the post of
greatest danger at the rear, where the flame roared closer every
second.</p>

<p>"Quick, <i>sahib</i> ! Quick!" came the voice of the Sikh
through the brass horn.</p>

<p>Ramsden strove like Samson in Philistia, the muscles of his
broad back lumped up as his knees sought leverage against the
parapet and King's heels rose in air. (His legs would have broken
if Jeff hadn't lifted him high before hauling him in.) Grim, unable
to endure the heat behind, put an arm around Jeff's waist and threw
his own weight back at the instant when Jeff put forth his full
reserve&mdash;that unknown quantity that a man keeps for emergency.
The ladder and the living rope came upward. And the parapet gave
way!</p>

<p>It was Grim's arm around Jeff's waist that saved them all, for
Jeff hung over by the thighs; the Afghans' hold was mainly of
Jeff's garments, and they tore. The broken stone hit King and
Jeremy, but glanced off, harming no one until it crushed some
upturned faces in the crowd. And Jeff's task was easier after all
without the stone to lean on. He did not have to lift so high. He
could pull more. King, Jeremy and ladder came in, hand over
hand.</p>

<p>"Quick! Quick! Oh quickly, <i>sahibs</i> !" came the Sikh's
voice through the horn.</p>

<p>But the heat provided impulse. There was only one way to get
that ladder across from roof to roof. They had to up-end it and let
it fall, trusting the gods of accident, who are capricious folk, to
keep the thing from breaking&mdash;they clinging to the butt to
prevent its bouncing over. And it fell straight with four spare
rungs at either end. But it cracked with the weight of its fall,
and by the light of the belching flame behind them they could see
the wide split in the left-hand side-piece. Someone said that Jeff
should cross first, because his weight was greatest and the frail
bridge would endure the strain better first than last.</p>

<p>Jeff did not argue, but lay on the ladder and crawled out to
where the break was, mid-way. Across the midway rung he laid his
belly&mdash;then set his toes on the last rung he could reach
behind him&mdash;passed his arms through the ladder&mdash;and
seized with his hands the rung next-but-one in front. Then he
tightened himself and the ladder stiffened.</p>

<p>"Come on! Hurry!" he shouted.</p>

<p>They had to come two at a time, for the last of the roof was
going and they stood on a shriveling small peninsular beleaguered
by a tide of flame. The Afghans came afoot, for they were used to
precipices and the knife-edge trails that skirt Himalayan peaks,
treading along Ramsden's back as surely as they trod the rungs. But
King and Grim crawled, King last. And it was when Grim's hand was
almost on the farther coping, and King's weight was added to Jeff's
midway, that the ladder broke.</p>

<p>Narayan Singh had turbans and loin-cloths twisted through the
rungs at his end long ago, and had a purchase around a piece of
masonry. So only the rear end of the ladder fell to the street.
King clung to Jeff's waist while the other half swung downward
against the opposing wall, and the thrilled mob screamed again.
Jeff, King and ladder weighed hardly less than five hundred pounds
between them. They went like a battering ram down the segment of an
arc, spinning as the turbans up above, that held them, twisted.</p>

<p>It was the spin that saved them&mdash;that and the madness of
Narayan Singh, who snatched at the ladder and tried to break its
fall with one hand! Both circumstances added to the fact that the
ladder broke unevenly, caused it to swing leftward. It crashed into
the wall, but broke again above Jeff's hands, and catapulted both
men through the glass of a warehouse window, where Narayan Singh
discovered them presently laughing among bales of merchandise. They
shouldn't have laughed. There were more than a hundred human beings
roasted in the building they had left. Maybe they laughed at the
unsportsmanship of Providence.</p>

<p>Narayan Singh was deadly serious, though unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"I watched the Portuguese! <i>Sahibs</i> . I <i>thought</i>
these seven sons are not the princes of perfection they are said to
be! They made a plan in that whispering gallery that you just left!
But I kept my own counsel. I followed the Portuguese. I know where
he went. The Portuguese has talked. The Nine Unknown are aware of
danger! You are spied on. They knew you would come to this place.
Someone in their pay set fire to the hotel, and said you did it!
Their agents now are telling the mob to tear you in pieces! They
say you are secret agents of the Raj, who set fire to the place
because a few conspirators have met there once or twice!
<i>Sahibs</i> , if you are caught there will be short argument!
They saw you from the street. Listen! They come now! What shall we
do?"</p>

<p>"Do? Track the Portuguese!" said King. "How's that, Jeff?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" said Ramsden, something like a big dog in his readiness
to follow men he liked anywhere, at any time, without the slightest
argument.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch04" name="ch04">CHAPTER IV</a><br>
"Here's your Portuguese!"</h2>

<p class="first">THEY escaped by way of the roof by means of the
oldest trick in Asia, which is the home of all the artifices known
to man. All thieves know it, and some honest men. You join in the
pursuit. You call to the human wolves to hurry. You have seen the
fugitive. You wave them on, answering questions with a gesture,
saving breath to follow too, glaring with indignant eyes, impatient
of delay, but overtaken&mdash;passed. So, falling to the rear, you
face about at last and, while the wolves yelp; on a hot trail in
the wrong direction, you walk quietly in the right
one&mdash;yours&mdash;the opposite&mdash;away.</p>

<p>They found a stair down to the street through the house of a
seller of burlap, who was edified to learn that they were
authorized inspectors. He obeyed their recommendation to shut his
roof-door tight. They took some samples of his goods to prove, as
they said, by laboratory tests that the fire risk in his house was
nothing serious, which made him feel immensely friendly. And out in
the street they became customers of the burlap- merchant, hurrying
home after a belated bargain&mdash;bearing samples&mdash;an excuse
that let them through the fireline formed of regiments just
arrived, whose business seemed to be to drive every one the way he
did not want to go.</p>

<p>So presently, behind the drawn-up regiments, they threaded a
thinning crowd toward the north, leaving the tumult and the honking
motor-horns behind. The streets grew dimly lighted and mysterious,
to Jeremy's enormous joy. His passion is pursuit of everything
unconventional. They strode down echoing alleys where no European
ever goes, unless there is a murder or a riot too high-tensioned
for the regular police. They stopped and ate awful food in a place
where sunlight never penetrated, drinking alongside surly ruffians,
who sat on their knives in order to keep conscious of them all the
time.</p>

<p>The way they took led by taverns out of which the stink of most
abominable liquor oozed&mdash;raw, reeking ullage with the King of
England's portrait on a label on the bottle&mdash;where women
screamed obscenities and yelled in mockery of their own
jokes&mdash;places where the Portuguese had led his night-life, and
had not been loved. Time and again Narayan Singh, with a sheepskin
coat hung loosely on his shoulder as a shield, peered into a
den&mdash;sometimes opium, sometimes drink was the reek that
greeted him&mdash;to inquire whether the Portuguese had headed back
that way by any chance. Invariably he was cursed, and certain gods
were thanked, by way of answer. One could gather that da Gama was
not liked even relatively in the places he frequented.</p>

<p>Narayan Singh, full of his office of guide, and proud of his
accomplishment in having found and blazed da Gama's trail, visited
every haunt the Portuguese frequented, talking between-whiles.</p>

<p>"It was here they sat, <i>sahib</i> &mdash;he and the man who
gave orders to the others who carried the books. And the Portuguese
told all about our meeting in the office, I listening, pretending
to be drunk&mdash;so drunk along the floor they all but trod on me!
Da Gama desired to play you on a hook, saying he needed money from
you. Therefore the other said&mdash;nay, <i>sahib</i> , I never saw
him before, and don't know who he is, but he wore yellow&mdash;the
other said the Nine will give da Gama money, if he will go to a
place he knows of, where he will discover it left in a bag for him.
The Portuguese asked how should he believe that? And the other
answered that neither the Nine nor any agents of the Nine tell lies
for any reason; moreover, the other added that all you
<i>sahibs</i> and your servants&mdash;by whom he meant Ali and his
sons and me&mdash;will be roasted to death within an hour or two.
So I rolled out of this <i>kana</i> * into the gutter, which is
cleaner, and as soon as I had watched da Gama to another place I
ran to warn you. Let us only hope he has not escaped us between
then and now."</p>

<p>[*A word meaning almost any kind of place.]</p>

<p>"Can't!" laughed Jeremy. "He's no more than a shilling up a
conjurer's sleeve! Process of elimination gives the answer."</p>

<p>So they harked along da Gama's trail into a rather better
quarter of the city, where the ladies of undoubtful reputation ply
the oldest trade without severely straining any caste laws. Priests
live fatly thereabouts. Whoever entertains a Sikh, for instance, or
Mohammedan, or Hindu of a lower caste than hers, may regain purity
for payment&mdash;which is very shocking to the civilized, who only
buy seats in the senate, or perhaps a title, or who "use their pull
with the press" to hush up things the public shouldn't know.</p>

<p>There, in a rather wider street, in a house that had gilded
shutters, they sat cross-legged on embroidered cushions vis-à-vis
to a lady sometimes known as Gauri, which is a heavenly name. She
was pretty besides inquisitive, and the turquois stud in the curve
of one side of her nose contributed a piquancy that offset
petulance. Her vials of vituperation were about full, and she
outpoured almost at the mention of da Gama's name.</p>

<p>Know him? Know that slime of adders stuffed into a yellow skin?
She wished she did not! But who were the gentlemen, first, who
wished to know about him? Men whom he had robbed? Amazing! What a
mystery, that such a <i>pashu</i> * as that Portuguese could win
the confidence of anyone and steal as much as one rupee! Yet he had
robbed her&mdash;truly! Her! A lady of no little
experience&mdash;He had robbed her of a thousand rupees as lately
as yesterday. He had laughed at her to-day! The beast had spent her
fortune! Practically all her savings, except for a jewel or
two.</p>

<p>[* Unmitigated brute having neither soul nor conscience&mdash;a
very comprehensive Hindi word.]</p>

<p>And he had robbed others! Although it served the others right!
Vowing fidelity to her&mdash;the brute&mdash;he had intrigued
elsewhere, as she had only just discovered, coaxing other women's
savings from them. What did he use the money for? To bribe the
priests' servants to bring him old books out of
temples&mdash;smelly old books full of magic and ancient history!
<i>He</i> said that if he can get the right book he can find so
much money in one place that all the rest of the wealth in the
world wouldn't be a candle to it! She was to have a tenth of all
that. She supposed he made the other women equally tempting
offers.</p>

<p>As a rajah on his throne might feel toward a dead dog on a
dung-heap; so she felt toward da Gama! She wished the Lords of
Death no evil, but she hoped they might have the Portuguese,
nevertheless! He had come that afternoon and laughed at her! She
had asked him for a little of her money back, and he had mocked her
to her face! He had boasted flatly that she would never see one
<i>anna</i> of her money back, and had then gone, mocking her even
from the street!</p>

<p>Whereat Jeremy, adept at following the disappearing shilling,
hinted to King in a whisper. So King made a suggestion, and the
priestess of delight blew cigarette smoke through her nose in two
straight, illustrative snorts.</p>

<p>She&mdash;hide that <i>pashu</i> in her
house&mdash;now&mdash;after all that had happened? There <i>was</i>
a day when she had hidden him&mdash;a day born in the womb of
bitterness, begotten of regret! How vastly wiser she would have
been to leave him to the knives of the men he had robbed! He was
always a thief. She knew that now, although then she had thought he
was persecuted.</p>

<p>King made another suggestion, launching innuendo deftly on the
ways of jest as he accepted sherbet from the Gauri's maid. She
looked as if she wished the drink were poisoned, and retorted
without any button on her rapier:</p>

<p>"Thug! You would like to search my house to steal the
Portuguese's leavings! There is nothing! He took all! And it would
cost me three hundred rupees to the priest to repurify the place if
I let such as you go through it!"</p>

<p>Now a fool would have taken her statement at face value,
believing or disbelieving as the case might be, and learning
nothing. A clever fool would have paid three hundred for the
privilege to search, learning that the Portuguese was not there,
but otherwise no wiser after it. Wisdom, yoked up with experience,
paid attention to the price she quoted and, not liking to be
cheated, doubled the price and made a game of it. For, although
<i>all</i> cheat him who buys, and <i>some</i> cheat the gambler,
the odds against the gambler are so raised already by the gods that
some folk let it go at that.</p>

<p>"Three hundred for the priest? I'll bet six hundred you don't
know where the Portuguese is now!" said King.</p>

<p>Her eyes snapped.</p>

<p>"Tell for less than a thousand?" she retorted scornfully. "I am
not a spy!"</p>

<p>"But I am a gambler," King answered. "I offered to bet. I will
bet you five hundred you don't know where da Gama is this
minute."</p>

<p>"You said six hundred!"</p>

<p>"Now I bet five. In a minute I reduce my stake to four. Next
minute three&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have no money to bet with," she answered. "Da Gama has it
all!"</p>

<p>"Yet, if you were betting on a certainty you wouldn't lose, so
you could afford to stake your jewelry," King answered. "I will bet
five hundred rupees against that necklace of pearls that you can't
tell me where the Portuguese is!"</p>

<p>"Who would hold the stakes?" she asked hesitating.</p>

<p>That was a poser, but Ali of Sikunderam was ready for it. He
drew forth his silver-hilted knife and made the blade ring on the
floor.</p>

<p>"You hold them!" he said, looking hard at her&mdash;upwind, the
way he was used to viewing the peaks of Sikunderam. "If my friend
wins, I come to claim the stakes. I am old in the ways of women,
and I come with this in my right hand! Only if you win you keep the
stakes."</p>

<p>She judged his eyes, and understood, and nodded. King laid on
the carpet five one-hundred rupee notes. She laid her necklace
opposite. Ali of Sikunderam raked all the lot together with the
point of his weapon and then pushed them toward her. She put on the
necklace and folded the notes.</p>

<p>"I could send my maid," she said. "The place is
indescribable."</p>

<p>But the maid of any such mistress as Gauri is more untrustworthy
than treachery itself. Having nothing to lose, and the world before
her, her eccentric trickery is guaranteed.</p>

<p>"I deal with principals. I bet with you," said King.</p>

<p>"I cannot go there! I am afraid to go there! It is too far!"
exclaimed Gauri. "It was my maid, not I who followed him. She knows
the way. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ali of Sikunderam ran a thumb-nail down the keen edge of his
knife, and Gauri shuddered, but it was Narayan Singh who voiced the
right solution. He leaned over and touched the nearest of Ali's
sons, who was day-dreaming over the maid's
delightfulness&mdash;perhaps imagining her likeness in the Moslem
paradise.</p>

<p>"Two horses!" he commanded. "Instantly!"</p>

<p>The youngster came to with a start and glanced at his sire, who
nodded. King produced money. Gauri claimed it.</p>

<p>"Let the owner of the horses send his bill to me!" she insisted,
and nearly enough to have bought two horses disappeared into a
silken mystery between her breasts.</p>

<p>So Ali's youngest went on an errand he could run without much
risk of tripping up, but "instantly" is a word of random
application and he was gone an hour before the horses stood
incuriously at the door perceived by half a hundred very curious
eyes; for the doings of a lady such as Gauri are of deeper interest
than chronicles of courts.</p>

<p>It was not until Ramsden came forth, bulking like a rajah's
bully, and the others formed up like the riff-raff hirelings who
attended, to the unprintable pursuits of aristocracy, that the
crowd went its way to imagine the rest and discuss it over
betel-nut or water-pipes.</p>

<p>Gauri ceased expostulating when it dawned on her that she would
ride escorted by nine assorted footmen. That is an honor and a
novelty that comes to few of her position on the stairs of
disrepute. And then, there was intrigue, that was meat and drink to
her. There was the possibility&mdash;the probability of venomous
revenge; and a bet to win, if no chance of her money back from the
Portuguese.</p>

<p>She began to try to stipulate before the hour was up.</p>

<p>"If I find him for you, you must kill him!" she insisted.</p>

<p>"If you don't find him, you lose your necklace," King
retorted.</p>

<p>"What if he tells you his secrets?" she said suddenly. "The
<i>pashu</i> will be afraid. He will tell the secret of the
treasure! He has had ten thousand rupees of my money! You must tell
me what he tells you&mdash;"</p>

<p>She grew silent&mdash;looking&mdash;reading men and faces, as
the third of her profession was. King's eyes had met Grim's and the
glance passed all around the circle&mdash;not of understanding, but
unanimous. They recognized a chance, and without speaking all
accepted it. So King conceded terms:</p>

<p>"Daughter of Delight," he said, "if in obedience to us you help
find treasure, you shall have your share of it.</p>

<p>"How much?" she demanded.</p>

<p>But it is wiser, if you want to shorten argument, to let East's
daughters bear the market for themselves.</p>

<p>"How much do you want?" King asked and she named the highest
figure she could think of that conveyed a meaning. (<i>Crores</i>
look nice on paper but are over ambition's head.)</p>

<p>"A <i>lakh!</i> " she said, laughing at her own exorbitance.</p>

<p>"Good! If your help is worth an anna you shall have a
<i>lakh</i> of rupees!" King answered.</p>

<p>She demanded, naturally, two <i>lakhs</i> after that, but Ali of
Sikunderam declaimed on the subject of unfaithfulness. A
<i>lakh</i> she had said; a <i>lakh</i> she should have; his Khyber
knife was there to prove it! He was as vehement as if they had the
treasure in the room with no more to do than divide it, and she
capitulated, more fearful of Ali's Northern knife than of all other
possible contingencies. She understood the glint in those eyes that
were the color of the breeding weather.</p>

<p>"A <i>lakh</i> ," she agreed; and then the horses came, and
fiscal whispers had to be exchanged between the owner of the horses
and the maid, who indubitably swindled everybody, though she had to
part with a "reward" to Ali's son, that being
India&mdash;specifically Delhi and the seat of government, where
extortion is the one art that survives. The horses were an
illustration&mdash;crow's meat, hungry, made to labor for a last
rapacious overcharge.</p>

<p>But nothing more was required of the horses than a walking pace.
The two veiled women rode them in the midst of men who were in no
haste, because to seem to hasten is to draw attention. It was
better to swagger and invite attention, which has a way of
producing the opposite effect.</p>

<p>They headed as straight as winding ways permitted toward the
northern outer fringe of Delhi, where the ruins of the ancient city
lie buried amid centuries' growth of jungle. Not a tiger has been
seen in that jungle for more than thirty years, but few care to
wander at night there, for everything else that is dangerous abides
in that impenetrable maze, including fever and fugitives from
justice.</p>

<p>As they left the last of the modern streets the moon rose and
they followed a track that wound like the course of a hunted jackal
between ancient trees whose roots were in much more ancient
masonry. The "servant of delight," as she preferred to call herself
since her mistress was what she was, led with King's hand on her
bridle-rein, recognizing the route by things she was afraid
of&mdash;ruins shaped like a human skull that drew a scream from
her&mdash;roots like pythons sprawling in the way&mdash;a hole in a
broken wall that might be a robber's entrance&mdash;terrified, and
yet employing terror consciously&mdash;enjoying it, as some folk
like to sit in a rocking boat and scream. Life to amuse her had to
raise the gooseflesh and offend the law, both of which are
accomplishments of night in northern Delhi; so her faculties were
working where another's would have turned numb.</p>

<p>They came at last to the world's end, where a shadow blacker
than a coal mine's throat declared that life left off, and might
have been believed except for moonlight that glistened beyond it
along the ragged outline of a broken wall. There, under the bough
of an enormous tree, whose tendrils looked like hanged men swinging
in the wind, they turned into a space once paved so heavily that no
trees grew and only bushes strangled themselves, stunted, between
masonry. On the far side was a building, still a building, though
the upper part had fallen and the front looked like the broken face
of a pyramid.</p>

<p>Once it had been magnificent. The outside and the upper portions
had collapsed, from earthquake probably, in such way as to preserve
the middle part like the heart of an ant-heap. Partly concealed by
bushes was an opening indubitably dug by men through the débris.
That they entered, into a tunnel that was once a corridor open on
one side to the air. And at the end of fifty dark yards, guided by
matches struck two at a time, they turned to the left into a hall,
whose marble sides had been quarried off long ago, but whose
columns were still standing like rows of twisted Titans holding up
the world's foundation.</p>

<p>There was a platform at one end, on which had stood a throne.
But on it now were a canvas camp-bed, an old black hand-bag with a
dirty shirt in it, a couple of pairs of filthy blankets, and a
lantern. Someone lighted the lantern, and about a million bats took
wing; the air was alive with them, and the women hugged their
heads, screaming.</p>

<p>A few opened tin cans tossed into a corner showed how someone
had contrived his meals; and one meal at any rate was recent, for
there was unspoiled soup remaining in a can beside the bed. But no
sign of the Portuguese. Not a hint of where he might be. Only the
certainty that he had been there that day! There, on the bed,
turned inside out and empty, lay the chamois-leather bag that
Cyprian had given back to him; but there was no more trace of the
coins that had been in it than of da Gama.</p>

<p>Narayan Singh was the first to speak:</p>

<p>"Da Gama came for money, <i>sahibs</i> . I heard the boast made
that the Nine never lie." He seemed afraid his own word might be
doubted since they hadn't found da Gama. "Nevertheless&mdash;the
money that we know he had is missing&mdash;gone&mdash;where?"</p>

<p>He picked up the chamois-leather bag and shook it. "Up
somebody's sleeve!" chuckled Jeremy. "Look for the Don and I'll bet
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>He spoke English, and the women's exclamations stopped him.</p>

<p>Ramsden went looking, not so talkative but bashfully aware, as
big men sometimes are, of strength and an impulse to apply it. It
was foolish to go looking in an empty hall, but men who don't pride
themselves on intellect occasionally are better served by
intuition. He stooped over where a solitary section of a broken
marble column lay on top of débris in a corner of the floor, and
they heard his joints crack as he shoved the marble off the
heap.</p>

<p>"Here's your Portuguese!" he said quietly.</p>

<p>He might have found a golf-ball. But he, too, spoke English and
the women exclaimed at it. The maid seized hold of Jeremy's hand
and began to examine his fingernails, which inform the practised
eye infallibly; but Jeremy snatched his hand away and hurried to
hold the lantern and look with the rest at what Ramsden had
discovered.</p>

<p>The yellow rays shone on the body of the Portuguese laid dead
and hardly cold in a shallow trench hoed in the rubble. The marble
column had closed it without crushing what was in there, and the
corpse was smiling with the funny, human, easy-natured look that
the man had worn in life for fragments of a second as he passed
from sneer to sneer. He had died in mid-emotion, and the women
vowed the gods had done it. They promised the gods largesse to save
them from a like fate.</p>

<p>There was no other explanation than theirs of how he died, nor
of who else than the gods had killed him. They searched the body.
There was no wound&mdash;bruise&mdash;no smell of acid
poison&mdash;no snake- bite&mdash;nothing, but a corpse with a
scarred chin, smiling! And no hat!</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch05" name="ch05">CHAPTER V</a><br>
"The nine's spies are everywhere."</h2>

<p class="first">FOR those who sacrifice themselves upon the altar
of her needs&mdash;whether supposititious needs or
otherwise&mdash;India holds recompense, as such quarters for
instance as Father Cyprian's, wedged between two gardens in a
sleepy street, with the chimney of a long-disused pottery kiln
casting a shadow like that of a temple-dome on the sidewalk in the
afternoon. From India's view-point Cyprian was all the more
entitled to consideration in that he had never openly conducted any
siege against her serried gods. He had saved the face of many a
pretending pagan, holding in the privacy of his own conscience that
the damned were more in need of comfort than an extra curse. So
pagan gratitude had comforted his old bones, unpretending pagans
not objecting.</p>

<p>He was housed ascetically; but there is a deal more repose and
contentment to be had in quiet cloisters than in the palaces of
viceroys, princes, bishops. Tongue in cheek, he had pretended to
the arch-pretenders that he thought their magic formulas
bewildering, doing it repeatedly for fifty years until it was
second nature, and men, whose minds were rummage shops of all the
secondhand old-wives' tales, not only used their influence to repay
flattery but labored, too, to unearth facts for him beyond their
understanding. India, surviving Anglo-Saxon worship of the playing
fields and all unnecessary sweat, takes her amusement mentally. It
was "entertainment exquisite" to bring to Father Cyprian, the alien
albeit courteous priest, new facts and revel in his intellectual
amazement. (For in fifty years a man learns how to play parts, and,
as Jeremy had noticed, Cyprian was "all things" to a host of
various men.)</p>

<p>He could discuss the metaphysical, remote, aloof though
omnipresent All of Parabrahman just as easily as listen to the
galloping confession of a Goanese in haste to unburden conscience
and, as it were, dump burdens at the padre's feet. Shapely,
dignified old feet, well cased in patent-leather slippers, resting
on a folded Afghan <i>chudder</i> to keep them off the tiled
floor.</p>

<p>Fernandez de Mendoza de Sousa Diomed Braganza watched them, as
he knelt and searched the very lees of his imagination. He was very
proud indeed to confess to Father Cyprian, a rare enough privilege,
that of itself, if boasted of sufficiently, would raise him twenty
notches in the estimation of the envious world he knew. All he
could see below the screen were those old aristocratic-looking
slippered feet, but they were reassuring, and he longed to touch
them.</p>

<p>"And so, father, that Arab, speaking English veree excellentlee,
so that in fact I was awfulee taken by astonishment and made
suspeecious&mdash;yes indeed&mdash;recommended me to come to you
for confession!"</p>

<p>"Why did you obey an Arab?" wondered Cyprian.</p>

<p>"Oh, I think he, was the devil! How else should he speak English
and laugh so light-heartedly? I saw his head against the night sky
and I think he had horns&mdash;oh yes, certainlee!"</p>

<p>Cyprian cautioned him.</p>

<p>"If <i>he</i> was not thee devil, that one, then the other
was&mdash;the great brute dressed as a Jat who seized me as if I
were trash to be thrown away and hurled me against my customers!
Father, I assure you I was like a cannonball! He hurled me and I
upset many men&mdash;oh yes, decidedlee! And though the whole hotel
was subsequently burned, and from below I saw those veree selfsame
individuals burning in the flames, I have seen them since! If they
are not the devil, they are salamanders&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is not for you to say who the devil is," warned Cyprian,
aware of how the Goanese mind leaps from one conclusion to another.
"How is it you escaped?"</p>

<p>"Oh, veree simplee. I have been most faithful in the matter of
the candles for the altar of Our Lady of Goa, so when that&mdash;I
am sure he was thee devil!&mdash;hurled me into the ranks of my
customers I was assured in my conscience that that is enough, and I
fled first, before there was a stampede, which I foresaw
infalliblee. So when the stampede began I was on the stairs, and
there I smelt the smoke and went to see as Moses went to see the
burning bush, and seeing flame I ran to thee street and was saved.
But my whole hotel and my fortune are up in flame&mdash;oh pity
me!"</p>

<p>So Father Cyprian pitied him with due restraint, and dismissed
him after a priceless homily in which he pointed out how profitably
Diomed might have given all that property to the Church, instead of
keeping it for the devil to make a bonfire of. Whereafter he told
his servant to open the slats of the jalousies and admit sufficient
of the morning sun to make the place look cheerful.</p>

<p>And a plain, cool, white, stone room with an ancient tiled floor
and vaulted ceiling is a great deal easier to make cheerful than
any sumptuously furnished boudoir in the world. The delights of
mild asceticism are immensely keener than the pleasures of the
epicure. The sun came in, obedient, and the light and shadow
alternated in long triangles on floor and wall, leaving the rear of
the room in shadowed mystery.</p>

<p>There was no sign of the library&mdash;merely a breviary, and
one or two books liberally marked with penciled slips on a table
against the wall. In addition to the chair that Cyprian used there
were six others, equally simple and equally almost impossibly
perfect in design and workmanship&mdash;each chair as old as the
Taj Mahal and no two chairs alike, yet all one unity because of
excellence.</p>

<p>A man may be ascetic without craving ugliness&mdash;an
anchorite, in moderation, without shutting out his friends. A
bronze bell from a vanished Buddhist temple announced visitors.</p>

<p>The servant&mdash;Manoel&mdash;another Goanese&mdash;soft-footed
as a cat and armed with pots of fuchsias came in to announce what
he regarded as too many visitors at that hour of the morning.</p>

<p>"They are <i>not</i> elegant. Not in the least&mdash;oh,
no."</p>

<p>"Their names?" asked Cyprian.</p>

<p>Manoel mispronounced them, was reproved, set the pots down, and
departed to admit the visitors, changing his mood like a chameleon,
only much more swiftly and with rather less success. For instance,
it did not convince Cullender Ghose, who entered first, as
impresario.</p>

<p>"Hitherto not having poisoned padre <i>sahib</i> , said sacred
person being vigilant, you therefore impel malevolent influence of
evil eye on these unholy <i>sahibs</i> who are honoring this babu
with employment? Stand back, son of miscegenation! Cease from
smiling!"</p>

<p>Who <i>would</i> smile if addressed in those terms by an
arrogantly fat babu? Not a <i>bishop's</i> butler. Still less
Manoel. He scowled and&mdash;so tradition says&mdash;a man must
smile before he can blast with that dreadful bane called Evil Eye
in which the whole of the Orient and most of the newer world
believes implicitly. Under the protecting scowl Chullunder Ghose,
with his back to Manoel for extra safety's sake, marshaled the
party in&mdash;Grim, Jeremy, King, Ramsden, Ali of Sikunderam,
Narayan Singh, and one of Ali's sons who was beckoned in by
Chullunder Ghose for "keyhole prophylaxis," as the babu explained
in an aside. The other sons remained squatting in the dust in the
patterned shadow of a great tree opposite. Falstaff never had a
raggeder, less royal following as far as mere appearance
went&mdash;inside or outside the priest's house. They all looked
like men who trod the long leagues rather than the pavement.</p>

<p>For though in the new, raw world, where twenty centuries have
not sufficed to give the sons of men a true sense of proportion, he
who would be listened to must masquerade and mountebank in new
clothes of the newest cut, India knows better&mdash;looks
deeper&mdash;and is more wise. So in vain that net is laid in sight
of her. Viceroys, kings and all their pomp are side-shows, and the
noise they make is a nuisance to be tolerated only for the sake of
more or less peace. They are heard in the land and not listened
to&mdash;seen, and appraised like shadows on the sands of time. The
men who go in rags out-influence them all.</p>

<p>Manoel the Goanese, for instance, with all European error
multiplied within him by miscegenation, scorned that ragged
bodyguard beneath the tree for servants of men of no intellect or
influence; and even so, a passing constable, with native vision
warped by too much European drill, but with all his other faculties
and fondnesses alert, paused over the way to meditate how innocence
might be made to pay tribute to worldly wisdom&mdash;paused,
scratching his chin with the butt of a turned wooden truncheon and
both eyes roving for a safe accomplice.</p>

<p>"That constabeel is a Hindu pig with hair on his liver, who
designs an inconvenience to us&mdash;by Allah!" said one Hill
brother to the next.</p>

<p>And all six nodded, in a circle, resembling bears because of
sheepskin coats hung loosely on their shoulders.</p>

<p>So within; the padre's servant Manoel approached the seventh,
who stood guard by the door of Cyprian's sitting room, offering
cakes to Cerberus.</p>

<p>"Taste it," he suggested. "Veree excellent&mdash;from
oversea&mdash;the land of my ancestors&mdash;it came in a great
flagon. Onlee veree distinguished people have been given any."</p>

<p>A hand like a plucked bear's paw closed tight on the long glass,
and with both eyes on the Goanese the Hillman poured a pint of
sweet, strong liquid down his throat, not pausing, not even
coughing. The glass was back in the hand of the Goanese before the
other had finished his gasp of astonishment.</p>

<p>"Tee-hee! You like it, eh? Come, then, into the pantry, where is
plentee more. You shall have your fill."</p>

<p>"No, for I don't drink wine," said Rahman, wiping his lips on a
sleeve. "Such dogs as thou know nothing of the Koran, but to drink
wine is forbidden."</p>

<p>In vain the Goanese brought more, in a glass jug, tempting scent
and vision. Rahman stood with his back to the keyhole, just
sufficiently inflamed by one pint of Oporto to have split the
Goanese's stomach open at the first excuse, and not quite sure that
he hadn't already excuse enough for it. So Manoel kept his
distance, and the conference within proceeded safely.</p>

<p>Cyprian began it, naturally, beaming on them with his loose, old
lips and eyes that never betrayed secrets.</p>

<p>"So you failed? I see you failed," he said, glancing from face
to face. "He gave you the slip, that Portuguese?"</p>

<p>"They killed him," Grim answered simply.</p>

<p>"Ah! A longer spoon than ever! Too bad! But his hat&mdash;you
found his hat of course?"</p>

<p>"No. Missing!" answered Jeremy. "He had a five-pun' note inside
the band, with my signature."</p>

<p>Cyprian's lips moved, but he said nothing audible.</p>

<p>"Worse than that!" King added. "In his pocket should have been a
paper on which he had jotted down terms he was prepared to make
with us. We wouldn't sign it, but the terns were down and an enemy
would draw conclusions."</p>

<p>"Gone too?" asked Cyprian.</p>

<p>"Yes. Taken," King answered. "Pocket was inside-out."</p>

<p>"Worse yet!" put in Ramsden. "All those ancient coins have
disappeared. Here's the bag&mdash;empty!"</p>

<p>"All except this one!"</p>

<p>Jeremy held up the one he had given pledge for. Cyprian took it,
turning it over and over in a hand as soft and smoothly wrinkled as
a royal grandmother's.</p>

<p>"Coins gone? Hat gone? Eh?" said Cyprian. "That hat&mdash;he
kept his memoranda on a strip of parchment inside the sweat-band.
If we had the hat&mdash;well&mdash;if we had the hat, I might have
fitted his key into my lock, as it were. Well&mdash;so we are worse
off than before!"</p>

<p>"Much worse!" remarked Chullunder Ghose. "Flesh creeping, holy
one! This baba, consumed by elementary anxiety, calls attention to
arresting key of situation, which is: Enemy lurking in ambush, is
now aware of opponents' identity. Opponents being us!
Alarming&mdash;very! Unseen, and selecting opportunity with
exquisite precision, will sneak forth and smite us shrewdly,
wasting no time! <i>Verb. sap.</i> ! Your obedient servant,
<i>sahibs</i> !"</p>

<p>"He knows," said Cyprian nodding. "He knows."</p>

<p>Ramsden half-unconsciously clenched two enormous fists, and
Cyprian laughed.</p>

<p>"If we could deal with them in that way their secret would have
been the world's five thousand years ago&mdash;wouldn't it?" he
said whimsically. "No, my friends. They may do violence to us; we
must admit that possibility. But it behooves us to use other means.
We are lost if we try violence&mdash;babes in the wood, eh? No whit
safer then than Sennacherib's Assyrians. We might as well walk
barefoot into a cavern full of snakes! But the Lord slew the
Assyrians. The Lord, too, fought against Sisera. Wisdom! We must be
wise! You understand me?"</p>

<p>He was trying to be all things at the same time to seven men of
differing creeds, not one of which was his, and he was much too
wise to venture on the freehold of religion, although that, and no
other motive, was the impulse that had kept him laboring for fifty
years. He knew that Jeremy, for one, would openly rebel at the
first suggestion of creed or dogma, to say nothing of Narayan Singh
and Ali of Sikunderam, who perhaps were not so important, although
quite as unwilling to be compromised.</p>

<p>"Nobody understands a damned thing!" answered Jeremy. "I know
what we saw&mdash;a dead Don minus hat, and his pockets inside-out.
We all know what the woman said. I've heard you. It all amounts to
nothing, plus one gold coin&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'd better hear about the woman," Cyprian
suggested.</p>

<p>Jeremy told him, reproducing the whole scene and Gauri's
conversation, down to the last remark of Gauri when she saw da Gama
lying dead.</p>

<p>"'See? See? They fooled him, and the fool tricked me! I am a
greater fool! I tell you, none but a <i>fakir</i> has the better of
a <i>fakir!</i> Men say of me, and such as me, that I learn
secrets. <i>Phagh!</i> Go and be <i>fakirs</i> , all of you! That's
what Gauri thought of it," said Jeremy.</p>

<p>"And she was right. She was right," said Cyprian.</p>

<p>Whereat Jeremy whistled. He smelt adventure coining down
wind&mdash;unexpected&mdash;just the way he likes it best.
Chullunder Ghose, who loves to feel his own flesh creep, made a
noise like a stifled squeal and shivered.</p>

<p>"Padre <i>sahib</i> , be advised by me!" he interrupted. "Being
far from affluent baba perspiring much for underdone emolument, am
nevertheless like package of Autolichus containing products of
experience! That Mister Ross can be a <i>fakir</i> , yes. He is so
clever, he can even imitate himself, same being most difficult of
all cynicisms. But he is Australian. His deity is Nth power of
Irreverence, same if brought in contact with high-church parties
lacking sense of humor, being much more dangerous than dynamite
with fuse and caps! I speak with feeling! Mister Ross will make
conjuring tricks with seven-knotted bamboo rod of holiest mahatma,
and we are all dead men&mdash;families at mercy of the rising
generation&mdash;oh, my aunt!"</p>

<p>Jeremy smiled, pleased; he likes applause. Head suddenly on one
side like a terrier's who hears the word cat, he watched Cyprian's
face, alert.</p>

<p>"There is truth in what Chullunder Ghose says&mdash;truth, and
exaggeration," Cyprian announced. "There is always danger in
attacking deviltry. But exaggeration in such cases is"&mdash;he was
going to say a sin, but checked himself&mdash;"a serious mistake
because it terrifies."</p>

<p>Every man in the room except Chullunder Ghose smiled broadly at
that. Cyprian smiled too, and none of them, except perhaps the
babu, realized that he had chosen that means of eliminating any
shade of terror from the argument.</p>

<p>"You!" he said suddenly, pointing a finger at Jeremy. "You! Are
you able to govern yourself? Can you understand that if you play
this part, one laugh at the wrong minute may mean death?"</p>

<p>"I hope I'll die laughing&mdash;in my boots," responded
Jeremy.</p>

<p>"Your death&mdash;and others!"</p>

<p>"Whose, for instance?" Jeremy came back at him. "I've seen men
in India I'd kill for sixpence each!"</p>

<p>"These&mdash;your friends," said Cyprian.</p>

<p>"That's different. All right. I don't laugh. I make up as the
lousiest-looking holy man you ever saw. What after that?" demanded
Jeremy.</p>

<p>Cyprian looked hard at him. In one soft palm lay the gold coin,
and he tapped it with a forefinger.</p>

<p>"This is our only point of contact," he began. "You must take it
and do tricks. You must challenge the Nine in public! It is
dangerous, and others must go with you to prevent abduction. Are
you willing?"</p>

<p>"Bet your life!" said Jeremy. "Who comes?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" remarked Chullunder Ghose, aware of the wheels of
Destiny.</p>

<p>"My young friend Jeremy, do you command sufficient self-control
to let yourself be disciplined by our babu?" asked Cyprian.</p>

<p>The padre's lips moved pursily, as if he were masticating
something, and his face was toward Jeremy, who grinned, but his
mind was already far away considering something else. Grim noticed
it and grew aware that Cyprian had made his mind up without waiting
for the answer. Quick work! But Grim is constitutionally
cautious.</p>

<p>"How about the babu?" he objected. "Can Chullunder
Ghose&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cyprian banished the objection with a gesture.</p>

<p>"You must be dumb, friend Jeremy&mdash;dumb!" he went on,
forcing deep thought to the surface through a sieve that strained
out all unnecessary words&mdash;particularly all unnecessary
argument. "Chullunder Ghose must talk."</p>

<p>"My God! You see me shudder?" exclaimed the babu, not
exaggerating.</p>

<p>His fat shoulders heaved as if an earthquake underlay them, and
a kind of grayness settled on his face. Nevertheless, none doubted
his intention. A century or two ago he would have braved the Holy
Inquisition out of curiosity.</p>

<p>"Whatever is said, Chullunder Ghose must say," repeated
Cyprian.</p>

<p>"Hear me say it now, then! Caesar, <i>moriturus te saluto</i> !
Speech, committing me, silence absolves actual offender! My belly
shakes, yet family must eat. <i>Sahibs</i> , increase my
microscopical emolument!"</p>

<p>Never was a man more serious. Chullunder Ghose, all clammy with
anxiety, rolled his handkerchief into a ball and caught it with his
naked toes repeatedly; but King moved over, and sat on a cushion on
the floor beside him.</p>

<p>"You and I have tackled worse than this together," he said.</p>

<p>"Ah! Yes. <i>You</i> and I! But this Australian! He would tie a
knot in the tail of Hanuman* himself, and trust to irreverence to
get him out of it! He will cry, Cooee!&mdash;and pretend to a
Brahman that such is colloquial <i>lingua franca</i> of the
gods!"</p>

<p>[* The monkey-god.]</p>

<p>"It is!" laughed Jeremy. "Australia's God's country. If I can't
talk the dialect, who can?"</p>

<p>"Peace, peace!" said Cyprian, smiling. "Let us joke afterward.
Colonel King, may I trust you to instruct friend Jeremy&mdash;drill
him, that is? We cannot afford mistakes."</p>

<p>King nodded. In all India there was none else who had traveled,
as King had done, from end to end of India in different disguises,
penetrating the reputedly impenetrable. If King had but possessed a
tithe of Jeremy's gift of doing marvels with his hands, he would
have been the man to send. But you don't discover jealousy in men
of King's attainments. A trace of that would have made them fail a
hundred times. Both he and Grim were safer men than Jeremy, and
knew it; but they were also much less brilliant, and knew that too.
As far as courage went there was nothing to choose, although they
would all have picked on Ramsden if asked who was least amenable to
fear; and Ramsden, knowing too well what it cost him to control
those thews of his, would have picked Narayan Singh.</p>

<p>"You know there is a Hindu festival at Benares very soon?" said
Cyprian. "I am old, or I would go with you. I know those
ceremonies. I could guard against mistakes. Now, understand: the
danger is abduction! There will be a million men and women in
Benares&mdash;more! You&mdash;disguised&mdash;unknown&mdash;you
could vanish as easily as seven pebbles from the beach! So you must
all go, each to watch the others. Be two parties. Jeremy,
Chullunder Ghose, Ramsden&mdash;one. The other, all the rest of
you, pretending to be strangers to the first. But all Hindus,
mind&mdash;able to claim acquaintance if you must."</p>

<p>"We shall be in next world very presently!" remarked Chullunder
Ghose. "What is object of this impropriety?"</p>

<p>Cyprian made a noise with his tongue. He did not like the word
impropriety. He answered looking anywhere but at the babu.</p>

<p>"The Nine Unknown must keep themselves constantly informed. In
order to know they must observe. To observe they must go, or send
their representatives. To be in touch with the mind of the
mass&mdash;which their purpose must be certainly&mdash;they will
take care to attend the festivals, in person or by proxy. If one of
their number should go to Benares&mdash;as is possible&mdash;extra
precautions will be taken of course to preserve incognito. But in
any case there will be at least one of their principal lieutenants
there to bring dependable reports. You understand that?
Now&mdash;"</p>

<p>The old man was warming up. He moved in his chair restlessly and
kept wiping his lips on a lawn handkerchief. His gestures, losing
the indeterminate, painstakingly tactful quality, were becoming
imperative.</p>

<p>"In cryptographic books in my possession it is laid down as
inviolable rule that one of the Nine <i>always</i> visits Benares
at this season of the year. They receive money&mdash;gold and
silver&mdash;that accumulation never ceases. And the East changes
slowly; without a doubt a great deal of the money even in these
days of banks goes to Benares, Hardwar, Prayag and such places by
porter at the times of pilgrimage. Someone is there to receive it.
You understand?"</p>

<p>Ramsden opened his mouth at last. Economy&mdash;constructive,
pioneer economy was his long suit.</p>

<p>"It would take a freight-train to haul the money. The amount
that disappears in one year&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Could be carried among a million pilgrims without attracting
notice," Cyprian retorted. "Do you realize your opportunity?
Contact is our problem! If, by challenging attention, you can once
make contact with the Nine Unknown, you may leave the rest to me!
We will presently find the books! Then you may have the
money&mdash;anyone may have it! The books&mdash;those nine
books&mdash;they are the true goal."</p>

<p>"If the cash really goes to Benares, it would take a train to
haul it out!" Ramsden insisted. "In that case we need only watch
the railway&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who said the money is hauled out again?" Cyprian retorted
testily. "For all you know there is a hole under a temple in
Benares&mdash;"</p>

<p>He checked himself, aware that for the first time he had
awakened incredulity. Even Chullunder Ghose allowed an expression
of mockery to light his face up suddenly. Ali of Sikunderam
exploded:</p>

<p>"Allah! If the Hindus had that much money in a hole beneath a
temple, the Hills would have smelt it years ago! Moreover would the
English not have learned of it? They smell gold as a thirsty horse
smells water in the plains. And if the English were afraid to take
it on a pretext, would the Hills refrain? Would that bait not have
brought the <i>lashkars</i> * yelling down the Khyber? And would
guns have held them back in smell of all that loot? Allah! Show me
but one sack of gold, and I will show you how hillmen
plunder&mdash;I and my sons!"</p>

<p>[* Hillman armies.]</p>

<p>But Ali of Sikunderam was wax in Cyprian's hands. Swift, subtle
flattery turned his indignation into boasting, out of which net
there was no retreat.</p>

<p>"You and your sons&mdash;invaluable! Splendid! You should have a
part, but oh, the pity of it! You are Moslems."</p>

<p>"Aye! The pity of it!" answered Ali. "When the <i>sirkar</i>
needed men to go to Lhassa who should not upset the heathen bellies
of Thibetians with a true religion, was I chosen with three sons to
make that journey because we could not act Hindu? Doubtless! Bring
me a thousand Hindus, and if one of them can pick me out of a crowd
as not being a Hindu of the Chattrya caste, I will go back to my
Hills and hold my peace!"</p>

<p>"But not in Benares. You would not dare in Benares," suggested
Cyprian.</p>

<p>"By Allah, in Benares they shall think me a double-holy Brahman
born in paradise! I will have the sadhus kissing feet within the
hour!"</p>

<p>"So. Excellent!" said Cyprian. "That is, if you dare."</p>

<p>"I would like to see the thing I dare not do&mdash;I and my
sons!" answered Ali.</p>

<p>"You speak of them as yours. I would rather heat them pledge
themselves," said Cyprian.</p>

<p>"By Allah, they will swear to what I bid them swear to!"
answered Ali. "If I say a hill is flat, they prove it! If I say a
Hindu wears his belly inside out, they demonstrate that, too, on
the nearest unbeliever! If I bid them be Hindus, they will even
shave themselves and look that part. Wait and see! I will bring
them in."</p>

<p>He strode to the door to tell Rahman, who was standing guard, to
go and summon them. Rahman went off to obey and the door was closed
again, but opened a minute later by Chullunder Ghose, who leaned
his whole weight on the knob and used it suddenly. Manoel, the
butler, entered on his knees and fell face-downward, saying
nothing, amid silence.</p>

<p>"Eavesdropping!" exclaimed Cyprian at last.</p>

<p>The Goanese did not answer&mdash;too afraid, or too wise. He lay
with his face between his hands in an attitude of abject
supplication.</p>

<p>"Put him outside for the present," ordered Cyprian; and Ramsden
took Manoel by the waistband, tossing him into the pantry as you
throw a stick into the fire.</p>

<p>"I tell you," said Cyprian, "we war with powers! The Nine's
spies are everywhere. More than once I have suspected Manoel,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>The door burst open again. It was like a thunderclap in that
quiet sanctuary. Rahman stood with a hand laid flat on either
door-post, leaning in, his eyes screwed tip and glinting like the
heart of flint.</p>

<p>"They are gone!" he said.</p>

<p>"Allah! My sons gone?"</p>

<p>Ali leaped up and drew his knife, though none, not even he, knew
why.</p>

<p>"All gone!" answered Rahman. "There was no fight, for there is
no blood. I think they went of their own will."</p>

<p>"By Allah, then they saw the prospect of a fight!" swore
Ali.</p>

<p>He stood on feudal right that instant&mdash;claimed Ramsden's
help, they two having plighted troth over a restored knife, and
there is no pledge more inviolable.</p>

<p>"Brother, I need thy strength," he said with dignity.</p>

<p>And Ramsden did not hesitate. Believing that his wits are slow
and that strength is all he has, he volunteers for all the odds and
ends and heavy work, the others conceding the point to avoid
discussion, but setting far too high a value on him to risk him
unnecessarily. (You may discuss a man's thews to his face, but not
his spirit.) So they trooped out behind Jeff, Jeremy leading,
leaving only Grim alone in the room with Cyprian.</p>

<p>It had occurred to Grim, as intuitions do come to a thoughtful
man in a flash sometimes, that if the guard left in the street had
gone so suddenly there was a chance that someone hoped to gain
advantage by their absence.</p>

<p>If so, then Cyprian was the obvious objective. If not, even so
it would do no harm for one of the party to stay and protect the
old man.</p>

<p>He offered no excuse, no explanation; simply stayed.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch06" name="ch06">CHAPTER VI</a><br>
"They fled before me!"</h2>

<p class="first">HAVING eased his mind concerning the requirements
of another world, Fernandez de Mendoza de Sousa Diomed Braganza
began to speculate on the improbabilities of this
one&mdash;improbability of credit in the first place. None had been
so foolish as to underwrite the fire risk on his hotel. It was a
dead loss. It was equally improbable that any of his erstwhile
guests would pay their bills, since the books were burned; they
would blame him for the loss of their effects, and probably bring
suit against him.</p>

<p>He knew equally well that the police would be in search of him
that minute to arrest him on a charge of criminal responsibility.
He knew his wisest course would be to go to the police and
surrender himself because Father Cyprian, the
next-door-to-infallible, had said so, and, deciding to do that, he
hurriedly reviewed another long list of
improbabilities&mdash;acquaintances, who had been friends before
the fire, who might be asked, but probably would not consent to
furnish bail.</p>

<p>So he turned to the left when the padre's front door shut behind
him, minded to call on one acquaintance on his way to the police.
That circumstance prevented him from seeing the arrival of Grim,
Ramsden, Jeremy, King and all the others, who approached Cyprian's
from the opposite direction. They were within before Diomed turned
and retraced his steps. So all he saw were Ali's sons in the dust
under the tree&mdash;them and the constable opposite, who was
rubbing at his jaw-bone with the end of a yellow truncheon to
assist the processes of thought.</p>

<p>What brought him back was nothing more concrete than one of
those changes of mind, like the action of a ship in irons in a
light wind; in India they call them disembodied spirits that govern
men in their extremity. He had vacillated&mdash;thought of another
acquaintance, who might be less difficult to pin to than the first.
Noticing the constable he chose the other sidewalk, naturally. And
with both eyes on the law's hired man from under the sheltering
brim of his soft felt hat he just as naturally stepped by accident
on the skirts of the sheepskin coat of one of Ali's sons.</p>

<p>The men of Sikunderam don't fancy being stepped on. It is even
likely they would choose a Goanese last if obliged to name the
individual to be permitted some such liberty. Nevertheless, the act
was obviously unintentional and nothing more than a mild curse
would have followed if Diomed had not, tripping and trying to
recover, kicked the hilt of a yard-long northern knife. And that is
sacrilege. A Hillman would not kick his own knife.</p>

<p>So the curse that leaped from the lips of one of Ali's sons was
like the hissing and explosion when you plunge a hot iron into oil.
Diomed sprang back as if a snake had bitten him, and even the
constable across street awoke out of speculative meditation, for it
looked as if the gods had come to life to solve his problem for
him. It is good to be alert and on hand when the gods arrange the
play.</p>

<p>And as he sprang back Diomed knew the face of his antagonist for
one that had cursed him previously&mdash;on the roof before the
fight and the fire began. He recognized him as a man who had been
held back by the others lest he use steel prematurely. And thought
in the mind of a Goanese confronted by predicament is as swift and
spiteful as an asp's. It recoils automatically on the person who
aroused it.</p>

<p>Now he could surrender to advantage! Now he need not go
empty-handed to the mills of the police that grind so small, and so
impartially, so be that they get their grist! This came of
confessing his sins to Father Cyprian! Now bail was unimportant.
There were dozens who would hurry to his aid if it were known he
had scapegoats, locked up in the next cell, ready to be
sacrificed.</p>

<p>All of that passed through his mind with the speed of starlight,
in between the opening and closing of the Hillman's angry teeth. He
beckoned the constable, who came, standing warily a good yard from
the sidewalk, not enamored of the chances yet, for they were six to
one and the gods not finished shuffling. It is the privilege of the
gods to make things easy for a man.</p>

<p>"Arrest all these!" commanded Diomed, in English for the sake of
extra emphasis. "They are the villains who set fire to my hotel! I
warn you they are dangerous! Arrest them instantlee!"</p>

<p>The constable could recognize the danger without help. He was
perfectly aware of six long knives&mdash;not yet free of their
scabbards, but poised between earth and air like Mohammed's coffin.
Moreover, the fire was news to him.</p>

<p>"Brothers, I <i>said</i> that constabeel designed an
inconvenience to us! Stand back-to-back!"</p>

<p>The "brothers" stood so, around the tree-trunk, inoffensive as a
third rail.</p>

<p>"In case you reefuse to arrest them I will reeport you! This is
a highlee important case&mdash;veree!" said Diomed, pulling out a
pencil to write down the constable's number. "I saw these men set
fire to my hotel!" he added.</p>

<p>But the constable, preferring life to an eulogium in the
Gazette, demurred.</p>

<p>"Where are your witnesses?" he countered, grinning.</p>

<p>Diomed flew into a rage immediately. He knew the law, or said he
did, and threatened to invoke the whole of it, including dark and
lawless influence, on the constable's unrighteous head. He named
names. He cited instances. He mentioned the policeman's ancestry.
Raising his voice indignantly he summoned all the neighborhood to
witness cowardice&mdash;corruption&mdash;a policeman in receipt of
bribes refusing to arrest six murderers!</p>

<p>The neighborhood had no will to associate itself with outside
scandal, having plenty of its own, and the few who had been in the
street departed&mdash;all but one. A man in an orange-yellow smock,
with a big, red caste-mark in the middle of his forehead, a twisted
orange-yellow turban, and no other visible garment, property or
distinction, stood where another great tree marked a narrow
cross-street and beckoned, holding his forefinger close up to his
eye as if in some way that lent long range to the invitation.</p>

<p>And the constable by now was more enraged than Diomed, with this
addition, that his rage was based on absolute injustice; for the
things that Diomed had said of his female relatives were not to be
borne by a man of spirit and some authority. They had reached the
stage of snapping fingers, and Diomed's two arms were waving like
semaphores as he leaned forward, showing simian teeth, to spit
denunciation in the constable's indignant face.</p>

<p>"One beckons," said a voice beside the tree.</p>

<p>"And you are corrupt&mdash;corrupt&mdash;everybodee knows
it&mdash;son of an evil mother&mdash;you accept bribes from all and
sundree and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He wears a yellow garment, brothers, such as the <i>sadhus</i>
* wear, but yellower. He is only one. We could beat him if he lied
to us. He beckons, and he signals silence&mdash;"</p>

<p>[* Wandering holy men.]</p>

<p>"All together&mdash;run, then!"</p>

<p>They were gone like leopards flushed from cover, down-street,
each with a hand on the hilt of a Khyber knife, as good to stand in
way of as the torrents of Sikunderam in spate. They swooped on the
man in yellow as if he were foe, not friend, meaning to seize him
and whirl him along between them; but he knew the...</p>

<p>[The next paragraph was partially unreadable in the book.]</p>

<p>...he had evoked, and he stepped down...had vanished when they
reached the...lasted half a minute casting this and...of hounds
before one of them saw...and the six went full-pelt at a...course,
hardly thinking now, but...and three purposes: to outrun the
con...to overtake the man in yellow, to keep together.</p>

<p>"There!" exclaimed Diomed, pausing in a torrent of abuse. "Now
all thee world can see how you let criminals escape!"</p>

<p>And the abuse had got its work in. There is poison in the stuff,
that breeds miscalculation. It is like a smoke-screen thrown off by
a human skunk to mortify whoever has weak sensibilities. The
constable was angry and aware of duty to be done&mdash;someone to
be arrested. Six criminals, accused of arson, had escaped under
cover of the seventh's volleys of abuse, and so the seventh must be
guiltier than all! He raised his truncheon&mdash;actually to hammer
out a signal on the side-walk&mdash;but, in Diomed's excited
imagination, to attack. And Diomed struck him&mdash;twice, in the
face, with the flat of his hand, hysterically&mdash;struck an
officer of the law in execution of his duty!</p>

<p>So the truncheon went to work in earnest, and poor Diomed was
beaten over collar-bone and forearm until he wouldn't have dared
move them for the agony. Then he was handcuffed ignominiously,
swearing, beseeching, praying, and marched away, followed by
inevitable small boys as free from the vials of compassion as the
monkeys are that some say are their ancestors. They said things
that excited Diomed to wilder imprecations yet.</p>

<p>And among the boys there was a dwarf&mdash;a man in
orange-yellow, taller by half a head than the tallest youngster,
and as stocky as two of them, but gifted with the same free
movement, so that he passed in the crowd unnoticed. He edged his
way closer and closer to the constable, who glanced about him
nervously, aware that in these "higher education days" the riots
and the rescuing are done by school boys while their elders do the
propaganding in the rear. He hurried, driving his prisoner in front
of him with thumps from the truncheon on the backbone just above
the trousers-band. It was several minutes before the dwarf could
edge close enough to speak low and yet be heard.</p>

<p>"You are fortunate!" he said at last. "Surely you have promotion
in your grasp! You have taken the infamous Braganza, who is charged
with burning his hotel and murdering a hundred guests!"</p>

<p>"I knew it! Come and give your evidence!" the constable
retorted, for the East lies glibly or not at all. He tried to seize
the dwarf as a material witness, but missed him in the crowd, and
had to hurry on for fear of losing Diomed, whom he charged
presently with arson and with employing six Afridis to preserve him
from arrest. "I fought them all, and they fled before me," he
asserted.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there was a strange assortment of individuals in more
or less pursuit of Ali's sons, with Ali in the lead, of course,
since the "sons" were his valuable property, and with Chullunder
Ghose as naturally in the rear, as utterly indifferent to the sons'
fate as the noon is to the netting of fish at ebb tide, but on the
job and anxious notwithtstanding.</p>

<p>"For if an earthquake had emptied Bedlam, releasing affinities
of swine of Gadarenes, and if government officials plus editors of
daily press were in charge of whole proceedings, <i>that</i> would
be diamond-edged sanity compared to <i>this!</i> This is worse than
acting on advice of experts! This is&mdash;oh, my aunt!"</p>

<p>He was not far wide of the mark; for as he waddled, wiping sweat
from his fat face, he could see the whole long-drawn line extending
down-street, each in his own way calling curious attention. Jeremy,
for instance, reveling in being taken for an Arab, looking ready to
go mad and do a whirling dervish dance at the first excuse, with
the long, loose sleeves of his black coat spread like wings, in
full flight after Ali.</p>

<p>Then Ramsden angrily, annoyed with Jeremy for making such a
public exhibition of himself yet unable to overtake him and
remonstrate, striding along like Samson who slew the
Philistines.</p>

<p>King next, side by side with Narayan Singh, neither of them even
fractionally off-key, and therefore about as noticeable as two true
notes in a flat and sharp piano scale.</p>

<p>"Man that is born of a woman is like ginger-pop!" remarked
Chullunder Ghose, pausing to consider. "Cut string&mdash;cork
flies&mdash;and he spills himself! Step one on the path of wisdom
is to <i>be</i> wise&mdash;<i>ergo</i> &mdash; by the waters of
this Babylon I sit me down and weep&mdash;thus&mdash;tree, I greet
you, weeping sweat, not tears! Great tree, what a world of men and
women you have mocked! Mock me a while, your shade is comforting
and your shafts of wit pass overhead! Now let us see&mdash;King
<i>sahib</i> is remarkable for sanity. <i>Ergo</i> , he will notice
me in rear. Observing emulation of Fabius Cunctator by this babu,
King <i>sahib</i> will suppress inborn proclivities of Anglo-Saxon
and pattern his thought accordingly.</p>

<p>"He will follow down that street to next corner, where he will
park himself broodily, sending Narayan Singh forward to repeat
process. Thus, whenever I proceed as far as corner and become
conspicuous, King <i>sahib</i> will observe me and will signal to
Narayan Singh. We shall thus be in touch. And the others will
behave as the sparks that fly upward, which can't be helped. That
is my guess. Being heirs of all the ages, I shall sit in shade and
see the world go by. Suspicious? Very!"</p>

<p>Chullunder Ghose was right. King did turn the corner in pursuit,
and at the next one did sit down on the veranda of a boarding-house
for Sikhs, where Narayan Singh, who kept up the pursuit along
another street, could find him and whence he himself might see
Chullunder Ghose if the babu should see fit to come to the corner
and signal. The others, following Ali of Sikunderam, who shouted
inquiries a hundred yards ahead, stuck to the pursuit like people
in a motion-picture comedy.</p>

<p>"Item one, a fool is very foolish," said Chullunder Ghose to
himself, leaning his fat back against the tree and flapping flies
with an enormous handkerchief. "Therefore congenital deficiencies
of Ali's sons comply with formula. <i>Verb. sap</i> . If they had
been attacked said idiots would have stood at bay by door of
padre's house, in accordance with law that nature abhors a
vacuum&mdash;doubtless. Empty heads apply, at spigot of authority
to be filled with instructions. They would have focussed attention
on padre's house inevitably. <i>Quad erat&mdash;nicht wahr</i> ?
<i>Ergo</i> , they were not attacked.</p>

<p>"What then? A woman? Much too early in the morning. And
again&mdash;no fight! If six such idiots pursued a woman, or women,
through the streets of Delhi, there would be bad blood spilt as
certainly as there are speeches when a politician pursues office.
Therefore not a woman. This time not the sex that bringeth forth in
sorrow and regretteth same.</p>

<p>"Then a man! The unproductive sex! At least as sorrowful but
less opaque! Motives more easily discernible. The six translucent
jewels of Sikunderam have been decoyed&mdash;and by a man, or
men&mdash;therefore for profit! Whose? Why? I lift a stone. Why do
I lift a stone? Because I need the space it sits on&mdash;or I wish
to throw it&mdash;or&mdash;if he&mdash;they&mdash;needed the space
on which the sons of Ali sat&mdash;or the street in which they
sat&mdash;I see&mdash;I get you&mdash;'Steve, I get you!' as
Jimgrim says&mdash;behold, I see through mystery! Let us hope
actions are not so loud as words. Thou tree&mdash;thou solid, dumb,
obtruding tree, farewell!"</p>

<p>There came a <i>tikka-gharri</i>* drawn by one horse on the way
home from assisting at the <i>Rishis</i>** only knew what all-night
revelry. Chullunder Ghose signaled the driver, who declined a fare
sleepily, without success. The babu waddled to mid-street and had
climbed in before the protesting Jehu could whallop his nag to a
trot.</p>

<p>[* Hired cab.]</p>

<p>[** Spirits.]</p>

<p>"Give her gas!" said Chullunder Ghose, translating slang learned
from Grim into opprobrious vernacular.</p>

<p>So the weary cabman whacked the wearier horse and, better to
call attention to himself, the babu stood up screaming that he had
a gall-stone and would die unless in hospital within the minute. He
was seen, heard, contemplated.</p>

<p>But he only drove two blocks, around a corner, and then paid the
astonished cabman the exact fare. If he had overpaid him he would
only have multiplied suspicion. Then he walked back three blocks,
parallel to the street in which was Cyprian's house, and turning
the corner suddenly was just in time to see three men in
orange-yellow smocks approach Cyprian's door and ring the bell. He
stood there long enough to watch them enter and see the door shut
again behind them.</p>

<p>"Kali!" he exclaimed then. "Let us hope Jimgrim is appreciative!
Dogs of the Wife of Siva the Destroyer! Oh, my aunt!"</p>

<p>He had been in time to see Ali of Sikunderam charge up the steps
and plunge into the building&mdash;for the men he hurled his
questions at had misdirected Ali and he had covered an unnecessary
mile before learning that his precious sons were foul of the
law.</p>

<p>He ran like an articulated jellyfish until he reached a corner
whence he could see King perched on the boarding-house veranda.
There, ignoring all discretion, he pulled his rose-pink turban off
and threw the thirty yards of silk in air, whirling it until King
raised a hand in answer.</p>

<p>Promptly King leaned out over the veranda-rail at the corner of
two streets and made a gesture that Narayan Singh saw from a
quarter of a mile away. And the Sikh, not optimistic, having seen
too much, but understanding that the gang was wanted back at
Cyprian's, went at the double to retrieve as many of the gang as
possible from a building in front of which two square lamps
advertised&mdash;POLICE.</p>

<p>Narayan Singh had seen Rahman follow Ali, and then Jeremy, then
Ramsden. None had come back down the steps, so he was in no doubt
what to do, although he did not know yet how absurdly simple the
strategy of the man in orange-yellow had been, nor how simpler and
more finished would be that of Jeremy.</p>

<p>Like will-o'-the wisp in orange livery he had simply led those
six North-country swashbucklers a dance along street after
street&mdash;up the stairs of the police station&mdash;and there
had accused the lot of them of theft! There was nothing whatever
for the police to do but hold them.</p>

<p>When Ali got there pandemonium was loose, for the six sons'
weapons had been taken and they were resisting further search as
desperately as hell's imps would object to
baptism&mdash;teeth&mdash;talons&mdash;imprecation&mdash;horizontal
mostly, with a couple of policemen laboring at each limb and each
lot expanding and contracting soddenly in spasms. One
policeman&mdash;he who had recently arrested Diomed the
Goanese&mdash;went from lot to lot using a truncheon unapplauded,
aiming at the heads of Afghans but oftener hitting his friends. He
said nothing about recognizing them, having already claimed to have
defeated them in mortal combat. The obvious solution was to stun
them lest they recognize himself, but it was extremely difficult to
hit their heads.</p>

<p>And into that confusion Ali leaped like a firecracker, knife and
all, to be brought to a stand by the officer's revolver. The
officer was in his place, in charge, behind the desk. There might
have been murder done, Ali was in no mood for compliance, with his
darlings being whacked and twisted under his eyes. The fact that
the police were bleeding, and his sons not more than warming up for
a morning's work, added to his zeal, and instinct warned him that
the man in yellow was the "father" of the rumpus. Therefore, Ali
was for springing at the man in yellow's throat when Jeremy strode
in smiling like an illustration from the Book of Ruth, with Rahman
yelping like a wolf a step behind him.</p>

<p>"<i>Salaam aleikoum</i> ! Peace! Let there be peace!" boomed
Jeremy in a voice with a ventriloquial note that fills a room. He
sounded, as he looked, like a man from the Old Testament. Ali
detected magic in the wind and yelled a word that his sons obeyed
on the instant. Even so, the police were human and eager for
revenge, but Ramsden walked in.</p>

<p>Baring his forearms, he offered to kill with his hands the first
three constables who struck a prisoner. So there was peace as
Jeremy requested, and the man in yellow took advantage of it, going
close to two of Ali's sons, who were held fast, with a policeman on
each wrist. He said he wanted to identify them. Jeremy observed,
and Ramsden observed Jeremy. The officer observed all three, but
Jeremy's hand is swifter than any eye.</p>

<p>"They are the men who stole from me!" said the man in yellow. "I
had a gold coin similar to this one in each hand. Rushing at me,
they seized my wrists and took the money, which you will find on
their persons. Search them!" He drew from a pocket in his smock and
displayed one ancient coin that Jeremy and Ramsden identified as
having belonged to the Portuguese da Gama.</p>

<p>"Search them!" ordered the officer, tapping his revolver on the
desk.</p>

<p>"Wait! First let me also identify!" said Jeremy; and he, too,
went close to the same two of Ali's sons.</p>

<p>He removed and palmed a coin that the man in yellow had secreted
in the nearest man's sash.</p>

<p>Not satisfied with that, he walked tip to the police officer and
whispered to him. Then, from him, to the man in orange-yellow who
was beginning to look less pleased&mdash;a mite impatient.</p>

<p>"Have I ever seen you anywhere?" asked Jeremy. "Were you ever in
Jerusalem? Jaffa? Alexandria?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"He lies!" said Jeremy. "I know him well! This was a trick by
the Hindu to steal a gold watch from your honor," he went on,
smiling at the officer as if butter hardly ever melted in his
mouth. "However, as the Prophet saith, on whom be peace, 'Let not
words and emptiness of speech suffice!' Search all three men!"</p>

<p>Now Ali's sons stood still, submitting, for they had felt what
Jeremy's nimble fingers did. And Jeremy, with his back to Ramsden,
passed to him two gold coins for safety's sake, stepping forward
again instantly. The jaw of the man in orange-yellow dropped.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;that Arab&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>But the searchers had stripped Ali's sons in vain, and it was
his turn. The first hand thrust into his pocket drew out the
officer's gold watch and chain.</p>

<p>"Magic!" exclaimed the officer. "He never once came near
me!"</p>

<p>"Lock him up then! Such as he are dangerous!" said Jeremy not
turning a hair, and the officer accepted the advice, insisting,
too, however, on holding three of Ali's sons as witnesses.</p>

<p>It was then, as the door of one cell slammed on all four and a
fifth already in there, that Narayan Singh strode in, appraised the
situation, and strode out again, leaving as many to follow him as
could or would.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch07" name="ch07">CHAPTER VII</a><br>
"Shakespearean homeopathic remedy!"</h2>

<p class="first">GRIM and Cyprian sat face to face in silence with
a shaft of sunlight streaming through the space between them.
Infinitely tiny specks of dust&mdash;for Cyprian was a martinet and
Manoel used cloth and broom incessantly&mdash;danced
tarantella-fashion, more or less as gnats do, in the golden
fairway.</p>

<p>"You observe them?" said Cyprian presently. "Each one of those
moving specks is itself made of billions of infinitely tiny specks
all in motion. That is the way the universe is made. All
atoms&mdash;all in motion&mdash;in an all-pervading essence known
as ether. You know that? It is in the books&mdash;the oldest of all
books as well as the newest. The ancients knew about it seven
thousand years ago, if we accept their heretical chronology. I have
their books to prove it. These Nine Unknown are the inheritors of
scientific secrets that used to form the basis of the Ancient
Mysteries. Yes, that's so. That's so. There isn't any doubt of it.
Not religious secrets, understand me&mdash;no, no, they are enemies
of all religion! They use scientific truths to stir superstition by
pretending their phenomena are miracles! Devils' work! They
know&mdash;the rascals! They have knowledge! Compared to them our
modern scientists are just as Julius Cesar would have been if
somebody confronted him with Paine's fireworks or an eighteen-inch
gun or the radio. Clever fellow, Csar. Bright as a button. He would
have tried to explain it away; tried&mdash;but there would be the
phenomena&mdash;effect&mdash;result of cause; you have to know the
cause to understand effect. No use repudiating it. Our moderns fail
exactly as Julius Caesar would have done. And the Nine Unknown
laugh. Devils!</p>

<p>"Nothing suits them better than to have the scientists, the
newspapers, the governments, the secret service, the police, all
vow that no such knowledge as theirs exists&mdash;no such
organization. Above all they chuckle because the church denies
them. Missionaries are their best friends. To declare they are
non-existent without proving it leaves the rascals free to do as
they please, without lessening the superstition of the crowd. You
understand?"</p>

<p>Grim did not. He has the pragmatist-adventurer's view of life,
dissatisfied with all veils hung between himself and noumenon, and
studying each phenomenon from the angle of "what's the use of
it?"</p>

<p>"Why deny what you can't prove? Why not discover their science
and employ it properly?"</p>

<p>Cyprian interrupted him with a frown and a flash of temper that
betrayed volcanic will unweakened by his age and only curbed by
discipline.</p>

<p>"<i>Tchut!</i> Wiser minds than yours decided about that long
ago. Beware of the sin of presumption! These people have been
branded as magicians&mdash;tricksters! Their pretensions,
magic&mdash;tricks!
Humbugs!&mdash;evil-workers!&mdash;liars!&mdash;cheats! They have
imposed on superstition. Take the consequences. Banned by the
Church. Outlawed. Burn their books! Who shall say then that they
have, or ever had, a scrap of scientific knowledge? That is my
task&mdash;fifty&mdash;two-and-fifty years of effort. Burn the
books! The nine books! Burn them! They have defied the
Church&mdash;<i>sed prevalabit</i> !"</p>

<p>"I don't get you," answered Grim. "Knowledge ought to be known.
Those books&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are mine! To do as I see fit! Did you not agree?" demanded
Cyprian.</p>

<p>Grins had agreed, but that did not admit the whole contention.
Grim, because he keeps an open mind, has been accused by
missionaries of belonging to nearly every heathen cult in turn, but
his name stands written on no muster-roll. He is under no vows of
obedience. He countered:</p>

<p>"King and I have talked this over&mdash;lots. King has been on
the trail of it for twenty years you know. Are you sure the Nine
aren't honorable men, who know more than is safe to teach the
public?"</p>

<p>Cyprian smiled at that like a martyr prepared to die for his
convictions.</p>

<p>"Only, someone killed the Portuguese," Grim went on. "Why? If
they know so much, why kill a drunken crook you can afford to
pity?"</p>

<p>"I have told you. They are devils," answered Cyprian.</p>

<p>"And while the hotel burned there was a voice urging the crowd
to attack us," Grim continued. "The same voice shouted,
'Fire!'&mdash;deliberated creating panic. Someone had searched the
Don's room&mdash;carried his books away. Same man&mdash;same men
more likely&mdash;returned to burn their tracks. That hardly seems
like men who, as you put it, have inherited the knowledge of the
Ancient Mysteries."</p>

<p>The expression of Cyprian's face changed. He drew on his mask of
patience that at eighty a man has learned to use consummately or
not at all. It was quite clear that if he gave discussion rein
these colts of other creeds would gallop away with him, Grim
particularly. Discipline was out of the question. Whip he had none.
Argument was useless. It would do no good to tell a man like Grim
to let speculation alone.</p>

<p>"Would you go and find my servant Manoel?" he asked; for
helplessness is like a weapon, in a wise man's hand.</p>

<p>Grim left the room.</p>

<p>Manoel sat cross-legged on a blanket in the corner of the
pantry, hardly having moved from the spot where Ramsden dumped him
down. The sin of speculation&mdash;if it is a sin&mdash;could not
be laid to him, for he was
dumb&mdash;determined&mdash;obstinate&mdash;like a clog that has
hidden to escape a thrashing and will neither run away nor come to
heel. He did not even shake his head when Grim ordered him into the
padre's presence; so Grim went back and reported the state of
affairs, having more than one purpose in mind.</p>

<p>And it seemed good to Cyprian just then to supply Grim with the
wherewithal to take his mind off the subject they had been
discussing. Helplessness was put to work again.</p>

<p>"I am old. It tires me to undertake these&mdash;do you think Mr.
Ramsden frightened him too much&mdash;I wonder&mdash;would you
mind, eh? See what you can do with him&mdash;persuade him to come
in here&mdash;yes? Such a rascal as he has been!&mdash;no, by no
means always honest&mdash;but a servant&mdash;he has been a
comfort. Will you talk to him?"</p>

<p>That was tantamount to <i>carte blanche</i> . Grim, incapable of
nosing into the domestic secrets of his host, could, would and did
crowd every limit to the edge when given leave. He squatted down,
cross-legged too, in front of Manoel and waited until the shifty
brown eyes had to come to a rest at last and meet his gray ones.
(The passport says they are gray, which makes it legal, but no two
agree as to their real color. Possibly they change, although his
zeal is fixed.)</p>

<p>"You're in luck. You've one chance!" Grim said speaking in
Punjabi.</p>

<p>Manoel did not answer; but the word luck probed the very heart
of inborn passion.</p>

<p>"Da Gama and Braganza had no luck at all," said Grim, and Manoel
lowered his eyes, not straight downward but along the arc of an
ellipse because of certain racial peculiarities.</p>

<p>"Da Gama died. Braganza's house was burned. Do you feel brave?"
Grim asked him.</p>

<p>Manoel looked up&mdash;suddenly.</p>

<p>"Who are <i>you?</i> " he asked.</p>

<p>His lips parted loosely. The corners of his mouth dropped, and
he shifted his eyes to left and right, showing more than was
wholesome of the bloodshot whites.</p>

<p>Dread, unexpected and acute, was unmistakable; it acted like a
solvent on the sullenness of fear. Grim saw his chance&mdash;almost
too long to be called chance; he had nothing to go on but
conjecture.</p>

<p>"Who do you <i>think</i> I am?" he retorted. "Look into my eyes!
Who am I?"</p>

<p>Manoel hesitated, with the expression of self-conscious
innocence facing a firing squad. Having double-crossed friend and
enemy alike there was nothing to fall back on but his conscience,
obviously! Grim bored in, wishing he knew something definite to
base assault on.</p>

<p>"Didn't you expect me?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>The million-to-one shot landed! Grim's face hardly changed
expression, but his eyes had laughter in them that the Goanese was
far too scared to recognize.</p>

<p>"&mdash;but I didn't look for a Punjabi. He who told me wore a
yellow smock&mdash; a <i>sadhu</i>. I have not had time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Time!" Grim retorted, forcing the note of indignation.</p>

<p>"I have not had time, and I have not been paid," said Manoel,
shifting his eyes again, and then himself, so that Grim, who was
all alert suspicion, jumped to a conclusion.</p>

<p>"Do you know they killed da Gama?" he asked, setting his face
like brass, and Manoel shuddered. "Do you mean to tell me you have
not been paid?" he went on, fixing his eyes on the Goanese and
speaking slowly.</p>

<p>And whether or not Manoel had pocketed his price, imagination
warned him he was helpless, at the mercy of someone who would
harvest whether he had sown or not. Admission that he had been paid
was no proof of it at all, he being what he was.</p>

<p>"But now he knows I was at the keyhole. He will dismiss me. And
first he will investigate. So he will find out, and I do not dare!
I will give the money back!"</p>

<p>That, too, was no proof that he had been paid. But it <i>was</i>
proof that he had taken more than one step on the path of treason.
Grim turned and swiped at a fly. Again the unhappy Manoel
shifted&mdash;not so much his eyes this time as his whole person,
although his eyes did move. It was because his eyes moved that he
did not see Grim looking in the little kitchen mirror.</p>

<p>"Give it here!" said Grim.</p>

<p>"The money? I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No. Give <i>it</i> here&mdash;or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me go then! I must run! I do not dare stay and face his
anger!"</p>

<p>But Grim knew now, and he is one of those who use knowledge,
patiently or promptly as the case may be. He leaned forward. Manoel
screamed, as a chicken does when a housewife has her by the legs.
Grim seized him by the collar-band, and all ten chocolate fingers
closed on the iron wrist. Grim jerked him forward, threw him on his
face and sat on him, proceeding then to raise the blanket.</p>

<p>"Thought so! Yow! You little scorpion!"</p>

<p>He seized his victim's wrist and twisted it until a knife
dropped&mdash; kicked the knife across the floor&mdash;glanced at
the back of his thigh to observe that it was hardly
bleeding&mdash;laid the folded blanket on the Goanese's head and
sat on that&mdash;then lifted what had been beneath the blanket,
carefully.</p>

<p>It needed care. It was an old book bound in vellum, crackled
with age. Within, in sepia, beautifully written in the Maharatta
tongue, with diagrams, on paper yellowed with age and thumbing, was
what purported to be a literal translation of a very ancient
roll.</p>

<p>The first page, on which the translator's name had very likely
been, was missing. On the second was a pentagram within the
dodeahedron&mdash;the geometrical figure on which alchemists assert
the universe was built. Beneath that was a diagram of the Hindu
cosmogony side by side with the Chaldean. On the third page, in
Maharathi at the top, as if continuing a paragraph from page one,
was the following:</p>

<p>Whereafter, being certain that the roll would not be missed
until (here a name was illegible) should come again, I hid in the
cave with the hag who made provision for my needs, and by the light
of the unextinguishable lamp I labored at the construing, with
haste, that the whole might be accomplished, yet with diligence,
lest errors enter in.</p>

<p>This finished volume witnesseth.</p>

<p>Which being done, this shall be hidden in a place known only to
the hag. Whereafter, I will endeavor to return the roll lest (the
undecipherable name again) should fall under suspicion and stiffer
for infidelity. That risk is great, for it is hard to come at the
place where the rolls are kept.</p>

<p>But death is no more than the gates of life.</p>

<p>The hag has her instructions. So this fruit of my long husbandry
shall fall into the right hands. He who guided hitherto being
All-wise to accomplishment.</p>

<p>Then here begins:</p>

<p>On the next page, at the top, in bold Maharathi characters, was
the first law of the Cabalists, and of all alchemists and true
magicians since the world began.</p>

<p>AS ABOVE, SO BELOW.</p>

<p>Grim read no further, for the stuff absorbed him to the point
where near-unconsciousness of every other circumstance prevailed.
His whole being yearned to the lure of that musty volume and its
secrets. He craved it as some unfortunates crave opium. The merely
physical appeal of drugs, prodigious though it is, monopolizes no
more than the intellectual attraction of the unknown does a man of
Grim's temperament. If he had read another page he would have read
a dozen, and a dozen would have only whetted appetite. He closed
the book with a slap that brought the pungent dust out, and removed
himself from Manoel's head.</p>

<p>"You insect! If you had the original of this I'd trade you my
right hand for it!"</p>

<p>"Let me go!" sputtered Manoel. "Oh, sir; I am afraid to face
him! Take the book and let us both go!"</p>

<p>But Grim took book and Manoel, each by the back, and shoved the
Goanese along in front of him into the padre's presence.</p>

<p>"He seems to have been keeping this for you," he said and laid
the volume on Cyprian's knees.</p>

<p>"Had he read it?" demanded Cyprian.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Oh, no, sir! Oh, father, oh, no, no! It is black magic
and forbidden. I would never read it!"</p>

<p>"What odds? He wouldn't understand a word," said Grim, and
Cyprian nodded.</p>

<p>"Let him go," said Cyprian. "Drive him from the house!"</p>

<p>But Grim had spoken English, and the fear that gnawed Manoel's
bowels multiplied. It dawned on him that he had been tricked. Grim,
then, was Father Cyprian's friend, and not&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" he shouted. "No! You must be merciful! This is my
sanctuaree! I may not be driven forth! I tell you I did it to save
you from murder because you are old! You are ungrateful! You commit
a great sin if you drive me forth!"</p>

<p>He wanted to throw himself down in the attitude of supplication,
but Grim had him by the neck.</p>

<p>"He expected somebody," said Grim. "Shall we see this through
now?"</p>

<p>"Face the adversary!" Cyprian answered.</p>

<p>But age gave way to youth. He waited for Grim to make the next
decision. And Grim held his arm out, helping&mdash;almost lifting
the old man from his chair.</p>

<p>"You'd better be seen at the door," he said. "We'll let them see
Manoel go empty-handed."</p>

<p>He turned on the Goanese and shook him.</p>

<p>"Listen, asp! Get your belongings. Oh! Only a blanket, eh?
Preparations all made&mdash;everything out of the house but
that?"</p>

<p>He followed him to the pantry, watched him through the door, and
seized him by the neck again as he emerged.</p>

<p>"Now, you've another chance. Don't speak in the street! Show you
haven't got the book&mdash;look scared&mdash;walk! You understand
me? If you disobey I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, oh! Onlee let me not go! I will&mdash;"</p>

<p>Grim stood back. It was Cyprian, trembling with age rather than
emotion, who stood in the doorway and sped the errant Goanese with
his left hand raised palm-outward and a look of pursed-up
horror.</p>

<p>"I tell you, father, I did it to preevent murder!" sobbed Manoel
with great tears running down into his whiskers. "Give me
benediction then, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cyprian did not deny him that. It possibly accomplished more
than Grim's threat. Manoel departed down-street with his head hung,
and the blanket draped over one arm, avoiding all encounters; and a
man in orange-yellow by the great tree opposite&mdash;where Ali's
sons had sat&mdash;drew such deductions as he saw fit. Grim
standing in shadow within saw the man make a signal.</p>

<p>"Good!" he said. "Shut the door now," and Cyprian obeyed as if
learning lessons. It was hard, maybe, at eighty to learn to
dispense with even a dishonest servant.</p>

<p>They returned to the sitting-room, whence the cloistered peace
had gone, although the sunlight still streamed through the spaced
jalousies.</p>

<p>"Pity the first page is missing," said Grim by way of making
conversation.</p>

<p>"It isn't!" snapped Cyprian, and looked to see.</p>

<p>Confronted by the fact, his last strength seemed to vanish and
he sat down, knocking the book to the floor. Grim rescued it.</p>

<p>"On the first page, at the top, was the finest cosmogony ever
drafted," said Cyprian, "and underneath it an explanation of the
terns used."</p>

<p>He spoke as if hope were dead forever. Grim changed the subject,
or tried to&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let's hope our crowd don't return too soon!"</p>

<p>"I should have searched that blanket," Cyprian grumbled. "He had
the first page wrapped in it. I know he had!"</p>

<p>Grim tried again. "Tell me what the 'unextinguishable lamp'
means on page two," he demanded.</p>

<p>"Mind your own business!" Cyprian snapped back, struggling to be
calm. "If I will burn books, shall you rifle their secrets first?
Phoenix from the ashes, eh? No, no! Hear no evil&mdash;see no
evil&mdash;know no evil&mdash;that is my advice to you, my son!
What I burn need not trouble you!"</p>

<p>"Are your books in this house?" Grim asked, suddenly alarmed at
a random notion.</p>

<p>But Cyprian chose to be amused at that, shaking his head
sidewise with the palsied humor of old age.</p>

<p>"Do you think I am in my dotage?"</p>

<p>Grim had no time to reply. There came a long peal on the bronze
bell, that clanged on its coiled spring as if the temples of all
Thibet were in alarm. Grim went to the front door, opened suddenly,
and stood back.</p>

<p>Three men entered, all in yellow smocks. They came in swiftly,
almost on the run&mdash;stopped suddenly&mdash;and hesitated. They
were surprised to see Grim.</p>

<p>"I am the padre <i>sahib's</i> new servant," he said in the
dialect, smiling.</p>

<p>Then he turned the key and threw it out through the little round
peep-hole that exists somewhere or other in most Indian
front-doors.</p>

<p>"Father Cyprian is in there," he said, with a jerk of his head
in the direction of the sitting-room.</p>

<p>They eyed Grim curiously, saying nothing. Bigger, stronger than
Grim as far as appearance went, they wore the impudent expression
of men who have been taught from infancy that they are better than
the crowd, of other clay&mdash;bold, yet with a sort of sly air
underlying impudence, and an abominably well-fed look, although
they wore the simple smock of the ascetic. Finally they all three
smiled at Grim, and one of them motioned him to lead the way into
the sitting-room. The man next to him who motioned had a long silk
handkerchief in one hand, and on his forehead the crimson signet of
the goddess Kali. Grim stepped back instead of
forward&mdash;ducked&mdash;stepped back again&mdash;and stood in
the pantry entrance with blood chilled and the gooseflesh
rising.</p>

<p>"My hour is not yet!" he assured them.</p>

<p>Except for Grim's activity there had hardly been a motion
visible, and yet&mdash;the handkerchief was in the other hand. The
executioner had missed. And if there had been a score of witnesses
they would likely all have sworn there had been no attempt made,
for the pride of the Thug* is in his swiftness. None sees the
strangling when it happens, it is so quick.</p>

<p>[*Thuggee, as far as its practise by wandering bands is
concerned, was stamped out by the Government long ago; but its
methods, and the skill of its practitioners, survive.]</p>

<p>All three men smiled with the coppery, cast expression of
determination that can bide its time. Grim motioned them again
toward the sitting-room, and they went in one by one, the man with
the handkerchief first, and the last man turning on the threshold
to assure himself that Grim was not bent on reprisal. But no effort
was made to exclude him. The door was left open until he walked in
after them and closed it&mdash;having his own reasons.</p>

<p>Cyprian was very near collapse. The apparition of the three in
orange-yellow came like an almost mechanical dénouement, to which
Manoel's misconduct had been overture&mdash;warning perhaps. His
old hands clutched and clutched again the carved ends of the
chair-arms. But he said nothing. He was fighting for self-mastery.
His lips were moving, probably in prayer; and repeatedly his eyes
sought Grim's, although Grim refused him any answering signal. Grim
knew he held the winning hand, and he who knows that is a fool if
he fails to play it carefully.</p>

<p>His cue was to make believe he had no weapon&mdash;to postpone
violence&mdash;to unmask purposes&mdash;to ascertain
facts&mdash;before admitting the possession of a forty-five. Even
when the orange-yellow exquisite tried thuggery he had not so much
as made a gesture to reach his weapon, and the three were fairly
satisfied that he was unarmed. They sat down in a row on the long
strip of yak-hair rug that covered half the floor, facing the
shuttered window, at an angle of forty-five to Cyprian.</p>

<p>Grim went and sat in the corner facing Cyprian, whence he could
watch them at an angle athwart the flowing lines of light. They
were nearer to the door than he was, but had no forty-fives, which
made a difference. They produced what they did have&mdash;two
old-fashioned muzzle-loading pistols between three of
them&mdash;cocked, and fitted with percussion caps. Grim looked
afraid, and Cyprian <i>was</i> afraid.</p>

<p>"You want what?" Cyprian demanded, speaking English for no other
reason than that those words trembled out first.</p>

<p>"Books!" replied the middle of the three men, using the same
language with a readiness and absence of foreign accent, that
astonished because of his bronzeness and the orange-yellow smock.
There was no reason why he should not know English, except that he
looked like one of those who pride themselves on their refusal to
learn it.</p>

<p>"What books?" asked Cyprian feebly.</p>

<p>But only his voice failed. There was no suggestion in his eye
that he dreamed of yielding. Rather, he was recovering self-command
as the effect of shock receded.</p>

<p>"All the books you have, including that one," the same man
answered, pointing at the volume Grim had saved from Manoel's
clutches.</p>

<p>Cyprian took his own time about answering that, moving his lips
and jaws as if first he had to masticate the words and glancing
down at Grim repeatedly to see whether Grim had any signals for
him.</p>

<p>But Grim sat still, the way a <i>chela</i> sits by the feet of
his <i>guru</i> , unpresuming, waiting for the wisdom to come
dropping word by word from the privileged lips of age. When the
time should come for Grim to give a signal he was minded to make it
abrupt and unmistakable.</p>

<p>"Who are you men?" demanded Cyprian at last; and the three in
yellow looked amused. Either they disbelieved that he did not know,
or they thought it amusing he should dare to ask; it was not clear
which.</p>

<p>"We are they who demand the books," answered he with the
handkerchief, and his companions nodded.</p>

<p>"And if the books are not here?" Cyprian asked.</p>

<p>"We will take that one, and you with it! Later you will show us
where the others are."</p>

<p>Grim heard the noise he was waiting for, but did not move, for
the sound was vague as if, on the sidewalk, thought was producing
words, not action yet. He hoped the bell would not ring&mdash;hoped
the key dropped through the hole would be interpreted&mdash;hoped
Cyprian would not have apoplexy at his next remark. For it was time
and he was ready.</p>

<p>"Holy one," he said in the dialect, playing the part of the
<i>chela</i> still, "would it not be wiser if I tell them where a
<i>few</i> books are?"</p>

<p>He allowed his eyes to wander furtively in the direction of the
far wall, where the room was in shadow.</p>

<p>"And I win!" he exclaimed in English suddenly.</p>

<p>They had turned their heads to follow the direction of his
glance. They looked back along the barrel of a forty-five. And of
all things in the world that are difficult, the hardest is to tell
which of three of you sitting side-by-side will be first in the
path of a bullet.</p>

<p>"They are hollow-nosed bullets," Grin assured them. "Put your
hands up, please!"</p>

<p>They held their hands up, palms to the front, suggesting Siva's
image.</p>

<p>"We are not afraid," said the man in the middle. "We are watched
for. Others come."</p>

<p>"Yes, others come," said Grim, aware of noises penetrating
through the thick door and thicker walls.</p>

<p>"Bet you they're in here! What'll you bet?" demanded Jeremy's
voice as the door flew open and the whole crowd poured in, Jeremy
leading&mdash;all the crowd, that is, who had been in the room
before and two besides.</p>

<p>Ali of Sikunderam came last, volcanically angry, muttering
Islamic blasphemy into his ruffled beard that either he had tugged
at or some other man had pulled.</p>

<p>Narayan Singh went straight for the two pistols and kicked them
away from their owners. One went off. A lead ball as large as a
pigeon's egg was flattened on the stone wall close to Cyprian and
the smell of cheap black powder filled the room. Using that as an
excuse the three in orange-yellow put the ends of their turbans
across their mouths and nostrils, moistening them thoroughly with
spittle.</p>

<p>"Being very holy men no doubt, oh yes!" remarked Chullunder
Ghose, picking up both pistols as his own perquisite. "Spirits of
the cess-pool! Who invoked them? That is the worst-smelling powder!
Are infernal regions advertised by Christian missionary actual? My
aunt! Shall I open window, holy one?"</p>

<p>But Cyprian was losing consciousness. King went at a bound for
the door and was in time to stop the three strange visitors with
three blows. (India, who knew almost all human knowledge long
before the West was born, has yet to learn to use her fists.) He
bade Ali and his sons hold them, and returned to discover what the
source of the reeking smoke was. He suspected a grenade with some
new sort of fuse. But there was only the assassin's long silk
handkerchief, dropped on the carpet as if by accident. He kicked it
and nothing happened, though the smoke did not cease.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Grim was holding Cyprian's head while Ramsden lifted
him and Jeremy forced a window. Between them they got the old man's
head into the fresh air. He showed signs of recovery. But the three
coughed so violently that they could hardly hold him up, and the
open window seemed to make no difference inside the room; there was
no telling where the smoke came from.</p>

<p>Nor was it actually smoke; rather a thin mist, with a hint of
pearliness and green in it. There was a faint suggestion of
sweetness and a little ether. It was a compound undoubtedly, and
there was lots of it, but neither King nor yet Chullunder Ghose
exploring on hands and knees could find its source nor any
container that might have held it.</p>

<p>Outside the room, where the gas or whatever it was spread
swiftly but not so densely into the hall, Ali and his sons were
taking law into their own hands. There was a cellar door&mdash;a
trap with big strap-hinges&mdash;and the weight of the door, with
rust and friction added, was as much as two men striving mightily
could move. That appealed, and the sons of Ali raised it. Down
below was a stonewalled cellar twelve by twelve or so, empty of
everything except some builders' trash.</p>

<p>Ali with his drawn knife drove the prisoners one at a time until
they jumped down in there.</p>

<p>"If they break their legs, may Allah mortify the stumps!" he
requested piously.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, tearing about the room, upsetting things and vowing
there were devils loose, Narayan Singh lost equilibrium, fell over
Chullunder Ghose, and collapsed with his head near the silken
handkerchief. King seized him to drag him from the room, and
noticed a burn where his face had touched the silk. Chullunder
Ghose picked up the handkerchief and dropped it with a yell.</p>

<p>Ramsden, Jeremy and Grim picked Cyprian up between them and ran
for the door with him, meaning to make for the street. They met
King dragging the Sikh, and for a second there was a tight jam,
into which Chullunder Ghose came headlong.</p>

<p>"Oh go! All go! Only go!" he shouted. "Now I know it! Manicheean
magic![*] It is death! It is unquenchable!"</p>

<p>[*The Manichees were Persians, whose teaching was a form of
dualism. But they also celebrated mysteries and were said to
practise magic and theurgy.]</p>

<p>Cyprian heard him.</p>

<p>"Poison&mdash;from the ancient books!" he gasped. "Come
away!"</p>

<p>They had reeled through the door in front of the babu's
impact.</p>

<p>"Where are those prisoners?" King shouted.</p>

<p>Ali and his sons began to labor at the trap-door, but it had
jammed in place and was difficult to start again. Chullunder Ghose,
purple with effort and choking, sized the situation up and charged
back into the sitting-room.</p>

<p>He came back like a "soccer" forward, shouting and kicking the
handkerchief along in front of him.</p>

<p>"Out of my way! Out of house! Quick!"</p>

<p>They fled before him&mdash;all but Ali and his sons. The men of
Sikunderam considered dignity and flight before a babu, at his
order, incompatible. They went on working at the trap, and raised
it about six inches.</p>

<p>"So! Good! Now down again!"</p>

<p>The babu kicked the handkerchief through the opening and, as
Sikunderam showed no symptoms of obedience, jumped on the trap,
forcing it out of their fingers and down into its bed with a report
like an explosion. There he squatted, looking like a big bronze
temple image.</p>

<p>"Now is good!" he said. "Keep open house until gas shall
evanesce! Practitioners of Manicheean deviltry will now be hoist
like engineers with own petard! Shakespearean homeopathic remedy!
<i>Verb</i> very <i>sap!</i> Oh yes! Tell <i>sahibs</i> , no more
danger now!"</p>

<p>And saying that, Chullunder Ghose himself keeled over.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch08" name="ch08">CHAPTER VIII</a><br>
"He is very dead!"</h2>

<p class="first">IN one hot brick cell, closed by an iron door with
a peep- hole in it, there were three of the sons of Sikunderam, one
Hindu in orange-yellow with a crimson caste-mark on his forehead,
who had refused his name, and Fernandez de Mendoza de Sousa Diomed
Braganza, whose name and occupation were as well known as his
temper was notorious and his predicament acute.</p>

<p>None of the others seemed to worry much. The "sons" were aware
that father Ali and his patrons knew their whereabouts, and it is
Law in the North, whence they came, that the feudal claims are
first. There would either be a rescue, or a use of influence, or
possibly raw bribery this side of midnight. They were sure of that,
whether rightly or wrongly.</p>

<p>And he in orange-yellow, having had the trick turned back on him
by Jeremy, was none the less apparently at ease. He wore the
would-like-to-be- dangerous smile of the hanger-on of priests not
subtle, rather threatening&mdash;the smile of a man who holds
himself superior to others as rule number one of policy. There is
nothing in the world more sure than that the priests and
politicians <i>always</i> abandon their clients when convenient;
nor anything more fixed than the assurance of the due-to-be-
abandoned until the miserable fact confronts them.</p>

<p>Diomed, on the other hand, was neither full of faith nor hope;
and he never did pin much to charity. Having counted on forgiveness
of his sins, he found that there was fortune still to reckon with;
and he did not believe that fortune ever favored Goanese much. He
supposed he must sin some more.</p>

<p>"We are five in one predicament. Shall we compare notes?" he
suggested.</p>

<p>Being first man in that cell he felt almost <i>in loco
parentis</i> , a guise that any innkeeper assumes without much
difficulty. That son of Ali whom he had recognized in the street
was not one of those detained, so he was unaware of facing men
whose enmity he had already, and could not lose without suitable
compensation, of which they, and they only, would be judges.</p>

<p>The sons of Ali held their peace. Their knives had been taken
from them. Talk is no equivalent for steel. Lacking the one, in the
North's opinion, it is unheroic and incontinent to substitute the
other.</p>

<p>"Wait!" says Sikunderam. "The hour of God's appointing cometh!
Wait, saying nothing!"</p>

<p>But the man in orange-yellow, regarding Allah as a myth, served
an even more destroying goddess, whose devotees are encouraged to
seek opportunity, not wait. He spoke, and his voice was strangely
reminiscent, so that Diomed stared open-mouthed at him.</p>

<p>"Someone set fire to a hotel in the night," he said.</p>

<p>"Mine! My hotel!"</p>

<p>"So there are three," said he in orange-yellow: "he who knows
the secret, they who wish the secret kept, and he or they who wish
to know who did it."</p>

<p>"Do you know who did it?" demanded Diomed, thrusting his little
black-bearded face forward so as to read the other's expression
better.</p>

<p>But there was no expression, except that cast-copper smile
betokening superiority. He in yellow was returning the compliment
by watching Diomed, so neither of them saw the rapt attention
displayed on the faces of Ali's sons. But the men of the North, who
are fools, as all India knows, were born with their ears to the
whimpering wind. They are easy to deceive, but as to voices and the
memory of voices never. Six eyes from Sikunderam, more used to
lean, long distances, met in the cell gloom and three heads nodded
almost imperceptibly.</p>

<p>"They who wish the secret not known may bid first," said the
orange- yellow man. "Nothing for nothing and from nothing. The key
that opens is the key that fits. My necessities are a lock that
holds me. Has anyone the key?" He stared into the eyes of
Sikunderam, impudently, challenging. In the dark of the cell they
looked like three young startled animals.</p>

<p>"Whoever would take on himself the theft of that policeman's
watch would have my friendship," said he in orange-yellow.</p>

<p>"You know!" exclaimed Diomed. "You know who burned my
hotel!"</p>

<p>"I know!" he confessed, with another of his bronze smiles,
glancing surreptitiously, at Ali's sons.</p>

<p>His need was to make <i>them</i> understand him. Diomed might
shout to heaven that he had stolen the watch, and the world would
only vote him mad; but if one of those Hillmen should confess, and
the other two should confirm it, what court could help believe?</p>

<p>"I will say who set fire to the hotel unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was they! It was they! They did it!" Diomed interrupted.
"Now I know them! They are the devils who fought on the roof! They
are the sons of evil mothers who&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was silenced by a slap across the mouth, backhanded, that
made his lips bleed and cut the knuckles of the smiter. But not one
word was said to him. Nor did he who had struck the blow speak at
all, for economy is the essence of good teamwork.</p>

<p>It was the second of three self-styled brothers who pointed a
lean fore-finger; and the third who gave tongue to what all three
had in mind.</p>

<p>"Aye! Thou knowest! And we know! We know the voice of him who
cried '<i>Bande Materam!</i> ' That same voice&mdash;thy
voice&mdash;cried 'Fire!' before the fire was set!"</p>

<p>"Ye were there then?" the Hindu answered mockingly; and Diomed,
with a half-breed's instinct for coming violence, drew his knees up
to his chin on the bench. He screwed himself into the corner to be
able to jump either way.</p>

<p>"Aye, we were there, seven of us and the father of the seven, a
Sikh too, and a Jat and some <i>sahibs</i> , who will swear to that
voice of thine, thou raven croaking in a cave! We are not men who
can be imposed on! We&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man in orange-yellow interrupted. Like all who pride
themselves on their intelligence he underrated that of his would-be
victims. He threatened them. Whereas, two things are sure: if you
threaten the men of Sikunderam you must be able to make good, and
prove it; and if you plead to them, you must prove you are
empty-handed&mdash;a true supplicant for charity. Between those two
poles all earth lies belly-upward to be bargained over. They are
poles like light-houses that no man possessed of open eyes could
miss. But pride is like box-blinkers.</p>

<p>"You Moslems don't like to be hanged. I can call witnesses.
Better make terms with me!"</p>

<p>The Indian courts of justice war with a system of perjury that
is older and more popular than law. The consequent precautions and
delays, and the system, that if ten men swear to a thing and twenty
swear against it, the twenty win, may lend itself to obvious abuses
that, according to Sikunderam, are avoided easiest with cold
steel.</p>

<p>The sons of Ali had no steel. Tradition would have counseled
patience and dissimulation. But the heat in the cell was growing
insufferable for men born where the clean air whistles off
everlasting snow-peaks, and stuffiness&mdash;being kin to
strangulation&mdash;breeds hysteria, which in turn brings all
innate proclivities to the surface and upsets any calculation based
on intellect. He in orange-yellow was an intellectual. He knew the
rules. The sons of Ali were no psychologists.</p>

<p>"Let him die before he does us injury! Be quick, my
brothers!"</p>

<p>That was a call for action, understood and never argued, over.
He in orange-yellow gave a shout blended of agony and unbelief as
fingers like hairy spider-legs closed on his throat. Other parts of
his anatomy grew palsied with pain, in a grip that he had no more
chance of breaking than a sheep has of breaking the butcher's hold.
Noise ceased.</p>

<p>It was at that stage of proceedings that the cell-guard, whose
ear had been to the peep-hole, hurried to summon his officer. He
ached with ill-will, because his sinews had been twisted when the
sons of Ali objected to arrest. He wanted to see them dragged out
one by one and beaten. But exactly at the same moment there entered
from the street three men in orange-yellow, with the caste-mark of
Kali on their foreheads, who approached the desk and made signs to
the bewildered officer. The bewilderment was all too obvious.</p>

<p>He was as displeased as a magistrate might be to whom an
arrested violator of the law made masonic signals; nevertheless,
not nearly so certain what to do, since there was no appeal in this
case to his honor and the dictates of conscience. He was bluffed
before they said a word to him.</p>

<p>"This is a day of reckoning," announced the leader of the three.
"One of ours is in your keeping. He is part of the price. We demand
him."</p>

<p>The Moslem officer hardly hesitated. Saying nothing, but livid
under the impress of that fatalistic fear which is the only force
blackmail has, he started toward the cells and disappeared through
a door into the corridor, followed by the cell-guard. The door
slammed, but opened again a minute later. The officer stood there
beckoning. The three followed him in, and the door, slammed shut a
second time.</p>

<p>"Look!"</p>

<p>The officer flung the cell-door open and the cell-guard brought
his carbine to the charge, showing his teeth for extra argument.
The three in yellow, self-controlled, peered in like visitors being
shown the sights, their bronze faces showing no more emotion than
the image on copper coins; but the police-officer was trembling
with anxiety.</p>

<p>"I ask you to believe&mdash;" he stammered in Punjabi.</p>

<p>One of the three interrupted him, touching his sleeve, not
wasting any words.</p>

<p>The three were interested&mdash;neither more nor less. There was
possibly as much trace of amusement on their lips as you may see on
the granite monument of one of the old Pharaohs&mdash;semi-humorous
acceptance of the iron rule of destiny, observed without surprise.
The officer tried speech again.</p>

<p>"Beware, most honorables! They are dangerous!"</p>

<p>The same quiet hand on his sleeve requested silence. The three
had seen all there was to see, but continued looking; for the
processes of thought are said to be accomplished best with all eyes
on the object.</p>

<p>In front of the door, as if laid there for inspection, was the
body of the individual in orange-yellow who had threatened the sons
of Sikunderam. Most of his throat had been torn out by human
fingers, and the back of his head lay flat against the
shoulder-blades in proof of a broken neck. Both arms were twisted
so that the hands were around again to where they should be, backs
to the floor. The feet were toe to toe, after describing three
quarters of an outward circle, and a leg was obviously broken.</p>

<p>"He is very dead!" remarked the one voice of Sikunderam,
speaking for three minds.</p>

<p>The sons of Ali sat back on the bench, backs to the wall, in an
attitude that gave them leverage in case one indivisible impulse
should decide them to attack. They could launch themselves from the
wall like tigers out of ambush. One hint of reprisals and no
cell-door on earth would be able to slam quick enough to keep them
in.</p>

<p>But unaccountably there grew an atmosphere of calm, as if Allah,
Lord of Kismet, had imposed an armistice. The electric tension
eased, as it were, and muscles with it. Someone in yellow smiled,
and Sikunderam answered in kind through a gap in a black beard. All
three men in yellow strode into the cell, stepping over their
co-religionist, and one of them turned to beckon in the officer,
who, at their suggestion, sent the cell-guard to the office out of
sight and hearing.</p>

<p>"Is it lawful to imprison these five, of three languages, three
races, three religions, in one cell?" was the first question. There
was only one answer possible:</p>

<p>"No, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>The same quiet finger on the same sleeve banished the
explanation. Without a word said it was made clear that the legal,
or rather the illegal fact was all-sufficient.</p>

<p>"Most honorables, that is how your co-religionist in yellow met
his death!" piped Diomed, emerging out of a catalepsy. "Most worthy
followers of Kali, these three savages attacked him without excuse
and butchered him brutally. I offer to give evidence!"</p>

<p>Miscegenated intuition&mdash;perverted, that is&mdash;told
Diomed that his chance lay in taking sides against the man in
uniform. The three he addressed were obviously visitors, not
prisoners, and the officer's fear of them was plain enough.</p>

<p>"This policeman threw us into one cell in the face of protests.
<i>He</i> is responsible."</p>

<p>He pointed at the officer, who scowled but the three ignored
both of them. Instead, the one who acted spokesman launched a
question at the sons of Ali that was half-proposal, half-riddle,
and breath-taking regarded either way.</p>

<p>"You understand, that if you escape from this cell illegally,
you are guilty of that in addition to the charge of murdering this
man?"</p>

<p>"And other charges&mdash;other charges, <i>señores</i> ! They
burned my hotel! Arson! That is what the judges call it&mdash;an
indictable offense!"</p>

<p>One of the sons of Ali smote Diomed over the mouth again, and
nobody objected. There was a little something after all in his
thought that fortune hardly favors Goanese. The sons of Ali fell
back on the code of Sikunderam, which calls for incredulity at all
times, but particularly when a Hindu makes a proposition. They
looked what they were exactly&mdash;men from out of town. The
smiter rubbed his knuckles.</p>

<p>"Ye speak riddles," said the spokesman.</p>

<p>"You understand, that they who might set you at liberty,
ignoring authority, would have the power to overtake and kill?"
asked the man in yellow.</p>

<p>It began to dawn on Sikunderam that these were overtures for a
bargain. All three faces closed down in accordance with the code
that decrees a bargain shall be interminable and he who can endure
the longest shall have the best of it. But the men in yellow were
in haste. One of them drew a long silk handkerchief from hand to
hand with a peculiar, suggestive flick.</p>

<p>"You understand that for all advantages there is a price? Go
free!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;" said the officer.</p>

<p>The finger on his sleeve commanded silence. He obeyed.</p>

<p>"Go free, in the fear of Kali, Wife of Siva, the Destroyer! Go
free, until a day of reckoning! When Kali asks the
price&mdash;observe!"</p>

<p>As if one thought functioned in the minds of all three, one of
the men in yellow stepped toward the Goanese and taking him by the
shoulders jerked him to his feet. The Goanese was too astonished to
defend himself.</p>

<p>"Have I not offered&mdash;" he began; but the second of the
three in yellow pushed him sidewise, so that he reeled backward on
his heels toward the third.</p>

<p>There was a motion of the handkerchief, as quick as lightning
but less visible, and Diomed fell
unpicturesquely&mdash;dead&mdash;a heap of something in a soiled
check shirt and crumpled collar&mdash;so dead that not a muscle
twitched or sigh escaped him.</p>

<p>"For a death there must be a death," said one of the men in
yellow.</p>

<p>The teeth of Sikunderam flashed white in a grin of pleased
bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Hee-hee! He didn't slay your yellow man. We did it!" chuckled
the spokesman.</p>

<p>The Thug was at no pains to explain his beastly creed. It was
better to leave the three less cultivated savages to speculate on
what the sacrifice had meant. His point was won. He had impressed
them. They had seen the swiftness of the silken death. Undoubtedly
they would soon begin to ponder on the fact that Diomed was slain
in the presence of an officer of police, and to couple that with
another mystery.</p>

<p>"Go! Let them go!" ordered one of the three, and the officer
began to fumble with the lock.</p>

<p>He flung the door open with an air of petulant impotence, and it
struck the cell-guard, who had crept back to listen. The door hit
his heel as he ran and one of the three in orange-yellow stepped
out into the corridor without the least suggestion of surprise. He
beckoned him. Not a word was said. The second&mdash;not he with the
handkerchief&mdash;held out a hand to warn the sons of Ali that
freedom was postponed. The first man continued beckoning, and the
cell-guard kept on coming, carbine at the charge, as if he intended
violence. But he stepped into the cell with his eyes fixed in a
stony stare, as if he had been hypnotized. It was the second man's
turn to beckon; and as the "wretched, rash, intruding fool" obeyed
the unspoken call of nemesis, the third man used the handkerchief.
The cell-guard fell in a heap on Diomed. The officer picked up the
carbine mechanically and laid it on the bench.</p>

<p>"Now go!" said the spokesman, motioning the Hillmen out with a
gesture worthy of the angel of creation bidding the aeons begin.
"Kali is all-seeing. Ye cannot hide. Kali is all-hearing. Ye may
not tell. Kali is unforgetful. Therefore, when a price is set pay
swiftly&mdash;even as ye saw this man pay!" He laid a finger on the
officer's sleeve, who trembled violently. "For if not, ye will pay
as these did!" He signified the corpses with a gesture. "Go!"</p>

<p>So the three went, wondering, not troubled as to what the
official explanation would be, of three murders in a cell and three
lost prisoners. The newspapers next day might call that mystery. To
them another mystery was paramount, and all-absorbing:</p>

<p>Who were the men who had released them? Where had they learned
that skill with a handkerchief? Why had they slain Diomed? And why
had they three been released? Moreover, what would the price be
that was mentioned, and would they&mdash;three Moslems&mdash;be
justified in paying it, suppose they could, to the priests, of a
Hindu goddess? How much would they dare tell to Ali, their
ferocious sire, considering the silence that was laid on them? And
if they should tell Ali, and he should tell Jimgrim, for instance,
and Jimgrim should consult the others, would the priests of Kali
visit vengeance on themselves as the fountainheads of
disobedience?</p>

<p>There was more to it besides:</p>

<p>If Kali was all-seeing, as the Three had warned them, did that
simply mean that they were being followed?</p>

<p>He in the middle faced about suddenly and walked backwards with
his arms in his brothers'; but he could see no Hindus in pursuit.
They tried a score of tricks that Hillmen use when the stones are
lifted in the valleys and the "shooting-one-another-season" has
begun&mdash;tricks that the hunted leopard tries, to assure himself
that he has left the hunter guessing wild. But though they hid, and
strode forth suddenly from doorways, so that passersby jumped like
shying horses in fear of highway robbery, they detected no
pursuit.</p>

<p>"The man in yellow lied to us," said one of them at last. "They
let us go, and that is all about it."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"They were afraid."</p>

<p>"But of what? They could have killed us easily."</p>

<p>"Nay! None slays me with a handkerchief! By the Bones of Allah's
Prophet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They could have slain the cell-guard in the passage, and could
then have shot us with his carbine through the hole in the iron
door. They were not afraid of us!"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, we three are afraid of them!" announced the
brother who had spoken first. The other two did not dispute the
fact. "I say&mdash;if we are wise&mdash;we will&mdash;hold our
peace&mdash;a little while&mdash;and wait&mdash;and see&mdash;and
consider&mdash;and if perhaps&mdash;there should seem to be a
need&mdash;and an advantage&mdash;then later we might tell. What
say you?"</p>

<p>"Allah! Who put wisdom into <i>thy</i> mouth?"</p>

<p>"It is wisdom! Let us consider it!"</p>

<p>They agreed to use their own term, to leave the proposition
"belly- upward" for a while.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch09" name="ch09">CHAPTER IX</a><br>
"Silence is silent."</h2>

<p class="first">CYPRIAN was not in a quandary. He would have known
what to do, but his eighty-year-old lungs were too full of a
sickly-tasting gas for him to function physically. That which is
born of the spirit is spirit, but the brain must wait on material
processes. He was just then in Jeremy's keeping&mdash;held in the
Australian's arms&mdash;being thought for by Jeremy.</p>

<p>And as the stars in their courses once warred against Sisera,
circumstances and his reputation combined to trick Cyprian. Never
would it have entered Jeremy's head that dignity, discipline,
responsibility to some one higher tip were necessary ingredients of
Cyprian's code. Having saved the padre's life the only other thing
that Jeremy considered was "the game."</p>

<p>Then there were the neighbors. Right and left were locked
godowns stored with merchandise. Opposite, behind shade trees and a
wall were Goanese, who would not have thought it moral, expedient,
polite or safe to interfere in the padre's doings uninvited, even
supposing they had seen what was going on. And the heat prevented
their seeing anything, for May was merging into June and none who
could afford to stay indoors dreamed of venturing forth.</p>

<p>The remainder of the street's inhabitants were Moslems with a
sprinkling of Hindus at the lower end; and every one of those knew
Cyprian by reputation as a student, and perhaps a practitioner of
black magic&mdash;a man to be feared, if not respected; moreover, a
man with influence. Nine out of any ten of them would have looked
the other way if Cyprian's house were burning down. The tenth in
nearly every instance would have run as far away as legs or a
bicycle could take him.</p>

<p>The constable, whose duty it was to patrol that street, having
quitted himself well with one arrest that morning, retired to a
basement cellar to brag of his doings and gamble on fighting
quails.</p>

<p>On top of all that there undoubtedly had been some deliberate
clearing of the street by influences never named but referred to,
when spoken of at all, as "they." The street was as peculiarly
empty as it sometimes is when a royal personage is due for
assassination.</p>

<p>The obvious course for a man in Cyprian's position, with three
would-be assassins in his cellar and his whole house full of
anesthetic, was to report at once to the authorities, leaving
subsequent developments to take their course. But Cyprian was in no
condition to give orders; and none of the others, King included,
cared to invoke official skepticism. No man, who confesses to
himself that he is searching for a heap of gold as heavy as the
Pyramid, and for the books that explain how the heap was
accumulated, is exactly unselfconscious when official investigation
looms among the possibilities.</p>

<p>There was furthermore Narayan Singh, unconscious&mdash;in itself
an almost incredible circumstance; for that doughty Sikh is a
drinker of notorious attainment and less likely than any of them to
succumb to fumes. He had keeled over like a gassed canary. King and
Grim were giving him first aid, considering his recovery of vastly
more importance than any debatable obligation to call in the
police. They knew the police for mere bunglers at best and sheer
obstructionists as far as true inquiry was concerned. They knelt on
the sidewalk one each side of the Sikh, who breathed like a cow
with its throat cut; and Jeremy, holding Cyprian like a baby in his
arms, came and watched.</p>

<p>"If you can make him vomit, he's yours!" he advised. "Get
something functioning&mdash;no matter what. One natural process
encourages the next. Knead him in the solar plexus."</p>

<p>King and Grim, having tried all other methods, experimented with
Jeremy's.</p>

<p>"Damn it! There's an antidote if only we could lay our hands on
it," said King. "I've heard about this stuff&mdash;saw its effects
before. It's a capsule as big as a rupee. They puncture it under a
handkerchief. The minute the air gets to it the contents turn to
gas. Beastly stuff burns the skin as it emerges, but changes again
as it spreads and becomes anesthetic. The thieves who use the stuff
carry the antidote with them. It's all in one of Cyprian's
books."</p>

<p>"If pop 'ud wake," suggested Jeremy. But Cyprian only
sighed.</p>

<p>"Where are the three Hindus?" Grim demanded.</p>

<p>"In the cellar. Ali pitched 'em in there&mdash;first-class job.
Chullunder Ghose is sitting on the hatch to keep 'em out of further
mischief," Jeremy announced.</p>

<p>"Ramsden&mdash;where's Rammy?" Grim demanded.</p>

<p>"Here."</p>

<p>Jeff, with a cloth about his face well drenched in water, had
been exploring the floor of the sitting-room on hands and knees for
evidence that would explain the enemy's method. He emerged through
the front door, panting.</p>

<p>"Gas is disappearing," he gasped.</p>

<p>"Rammy! Narayan Singh is going West! Get a move on! Get those
three Hindus. <i>Make</i> 'em produce their antidote! Stop at
nothing!" That was Grim with the mask off&mdash;dealer in
fundamentals.</p>

<p>So the purple patch that was the shadow of Jeff Ramsden ceased
from existence on the white wall&mdash;simply ceased. He can be
swift when occasion calls for it. Within, where more or less
silence had been, was a great noise, as Jeff's weight landed on the
trap and that of Chullunder Ghose, capsized, complaining.</p>

<p>"Off the trap! Lively!"</p>

<p>Ali of Sikunderam and his sons had been lying belly-downward
listening in vain for noises from below. Imagination yearned for
cries of pain and half-invented them. But the door was too thick,
and sat too tightly in its bed for even their fond wish to get
itself believed.</p>

<p>"By Allah I swear I broke the legs of all three!" boasted Ali,
face to the wood.</p>

<p>But he said no more, for Ramsden seized him by arm and leg and
threw him clear, the sons scampering away on hands and knees before
the like indignity could happen to themselves. Then Ramsden got his
fingers into the only crevice, strained, grunted, strove and gave
it up. The door and frame were jammed hermetically.</p>

<p>"Crowbar!"</p>

<p>Ali Sikunderam&mdash;to employ their estimate&mdash;scattered in
search of cold iron, while Jeff continued torturing his fingers
vainly. One of the sons came in from the street on a run with loot
from a Moslem godown. Blood on his forearm told the
story&mdash;view of a crowbar through a
window&mdash;action&mdash;acquisition.</p>

<p>"Good!" said Ramsden, and the woodwork began splintering
forthwith&mdash;old teak, as dry and hard as temple timber, ripping
apart with a cry as if it lived, and desired to live.</p>

<p>"Get a rope&mdash;or a ladder!" Ramsden grunted.</p>

<p>Out on the sidewalk, under Jeremy's running fire of comment and
advice, Narayan Singh had vomited and was showing other signs of
resuming the burden of life, as Jeremy had prophesied. Cyprian, on
the contrary, had fallen into the easy sleep that overtakes old
folk and infants, so that Jeremy, sniffing to make sure the gas was
all gone, carried him inside presently and up the narrow stone
stairs to the first-floor bedroom&mdash;clean, simple, severe as a
monastery, yet comfortable, since only the needless things were
missing.</p>

<p>The head of the bed was backed against an iron door that was
papered over, white like the rest of the walls, with an overlapping
fringe to hide the tell-tale crack.</p>

<p>The legs of the bed were set tight against wooden blocks screwed
down to the floor, with the obvious purpose of re-enforcing the
lock that was low enough down on the door to be hidden by the
bed-frame. Jeremy noticed how tightly the casters were jammed
against the blocks, as if they had been subjected to tremendous
pressure, and it was that, as he laid Cyprian down, that caused him
to scrutinize the door more curiously.</p>

<p>He is sure of his senses, having trained them. Too used to
deceiving others' eyes he disciplines his own. He could have sworn
that the door moved&mdash;inward&mdash;by a fraction of an inch;
that is to say toward the wall and away from the head of the bed.
He tested it, after making sure again that Cyprian was sleeping,
and discovered he could get the fingers of one hand in between the
bedpost and the door. And there was a long mark on the wide paper
covering the iron door, in proof that it had recently pressed
outward against the bed.</p>

<p>So either the lock was unlocked, or it did not function, or else
it had been locked again since he entered the room.</p>

<p>Curiosity eats Jeremy like acid. He must know or be miserable.
Mystery merely whets appetite. With an, other glance to make sure
Cyprian was sleeping, he cautiously pulled the bed clear of the
wooden blocks and rolled it a yard along the floor. Then he stooped
to examine the keyhole. There was no key in it, and there had not
been, for it was still stuffed with soap, and a piece of white
paper rubbed on to the soap was in place&mdash;Cyprian's modest
effort at constructive camouflage. On the floor lay an irregularly
oblong sliver of white stone&mdash;two inches by an inch. The door
had been forced from the inside, recently.</p>

<p>Jeremy tore back the paper from door and wall in two
considerable strips. The tongue of the old-fashioned lock projected
not more than an inch into unprotected stonework and was merely
resting now in a neat groove that the fallen sliver fitted.
Nothing&mdash;on Jeremy's side, that is&mdash;prevented the door
from swinging open. He tested it with his fingers. It refused to
yield.</p>

<p>And he could swear he had seen it move when he first laid
Cyprian on the bed.</p>

<p>He glanced at Cyprian, half-inclined to wake him&mdash;glanced
at the iron door again and speculated.</p>

<p>"Probably the old boy keeps his books in there. Shock might
kill, if he wakes and learns thieves are in the coop. Sleep on,
Melchizedek!"</p>

<p>Knowing the danger to himself of using firearms, in a country in
more or less perennial rebellion, where the carrying of modern
weapons is forbidden except for sport, Jeremy looked about him for
an implement less compromising to himself. In a corner, behind a
cretonne curtain under which the padre's garments hung, he found an
Irish blackthorn walking stick&mdash;a souvenir of Ballyshannon
days, where Cyprian once did temporary duty. The stick was as
strong as a professional shillalah with twice the length&mdash;a
deadlier weapon than gun or sword in given circumstances.</p>

<p>Down-stairs Ramsden broke up the trap-door section by
section&mdash;layer by layer. It was so thick and so well
carpentered that nothing less than absolute destruction laid the
hinges bare. By the time it was possible to reach the bolt, that
swung in place across the whole width of the trap and bit into
twelve-inch beams, there was no more sense in fooling with it, for
the door was totally destroyed. Jeff used the bolt for a purchase
for his rope, the sons of Ali having failed to find a ladder, and
went down band over hand into the dark.</p>

<p>Not even the eyes of Sikunderam could see more than an
unexpected red light, and trash heaped in a mess below; but there
seemed to be less of the trash than when Ali had flung the three
into the pit. Where a pile of boxes had been, that should have
lessened Jeff's descent, there was nothing to meet his exploring
feet and he had to drop the last yard, for the rope was short.</p>

<p>The next they all knew was a roar like a bull's as Jeff joined
battle with an unseen foe; and that was followed by an increase of
the crimson glow and the indrawn roar of a furnace. It was like a
glimpse into the bowels of a great ship, or into Tophet.</p>

<p>"Come on! Help, you fellows!" was all the explanation Jeff had
time for&mdash;English at that&mdash;a sure enough sign he was
excited.</p>

<p>King left Narayan Singh in Grim's hands&mdash;came on the
run&mdash;and swung down the rope like a sailor. And Chullunder
Ghose was next, "so curious" as he explained it afterward,
resembling a seaman less than any other being in the world, first
jammed in the broken trap like a cork in the neck of a
bottle&mdash;breaking the hold of the wood-work by sheer weight and
strength&mdash;then suddenly descending with the rope like red hot
wire between his hands, to fall the last yard and be met&mdash;as
it seemed to him&mdash;by an ascending floor constructed of
upturned splinters.</p>

<p>And down on Chullunder Ghose in that unfortunate predicament
there dropped Sikunderam in swift succession, sire and sons,
grateful for the cushion&mdash;but to Allah, not the babu&mdash;and
stepping off without pausing to pass compliments.</p>

<p>At the cellar's farther end there was a door down, and the whole
of Cyprian's arrangements for the eventual holocaust of black books
were plain to see in the light of a galloping fire. The holocaust
was prematurely born. The three had set the match that was to have
been Cyprian's torch on his last pilgrimage. The books, stacked
hundreds in a pile inside an ancient pottery kiln, were all alight
and the glue in the backs of some of the more modern ones was
priming for the rest.</p>

<p>Cyprian had stacked ample fuel under them in readiness, but to
that the three had added trash. There was no fire-door to be shut
to exclude a draft; the furnace-jaws gaped wide. The chimney at the
junction of Cyprian's house and the godown was serving its ancient
purpose, and the trap-door that Ramsden broke was letting enough
draft to feed the ravening fires of Eblis. Out on the sidewalk Grim
saw the shadow of sulphur-and-black smoke belching from the summit
of the old quiescent kiln; Narayan Singh was left to do his own
recovering, and Grim, guided by instinct, took the stairs four at a
stride instead of plunging like an <i>ifrit</i> into Ramsden's
broken hole.</p>

<p>He was just in time to see Jeremy swing the blackthorn down
two-handed on the back of a head that emerged for reconnoitering
purposes through the cautiously opened iron door. The blow would
have cut the head clean off if the weapon had only been an ax. A
man in yellow fell face-forward and his shoulders prevented the
door from shutting, although someone tried to pull him back in by
the feet. Simultaneously Grim and Jeremy seized the iron door and
wrenched it wide open, and a stab like a fork of lightning missed
Grim by the thickness of a moonbeam&mdash;missed and was not quick
enough, for Jeremy brought the blackthorn down on a long knife with
a serpent handle, disarming a yellow, invisible someone, who
dropped whatever else he held and retreated into deeper gloom.</p>

<p>Cyprian slept on, moving his lips and old fingers as if
dreaming. Jeremy, all-trusting in his own luck, signaled, passed
the blackthorn into Grim's hand and reached for matches. Grim
agreed with him. With their feet they shoved the victim of Jeremy's
weapon back whence he had come and stepped through over him,
closing the iron door at their backs. Then Jeremy struck a
match&mdash;in time&mdash;exactly in the middle of the nick of
shaven time. The blackthorn came in use again&mdash;crack on a
wrist that thrust upward with another such knife as the first man
had tried to sting with. The blow broke the wrist. Someone
smothered an exclamation.</p>

<p>"Curse these matches!" exclaimed Jeremy, and struck another.</p>

<p>On the floor of a closet about ten by ten lay two of the Three.
The man whom Jeremy had first struck was dead undoubtedly. The
other's leg was broken&mdash;Ali's work&mdash;and now the wrist was
added to his inconveniences. He was writhing in pain, though making
no noise, and all mixed up with the dead man. Evidently two of them
had been carrying the fellow with the broken leg, and the third had
run back through a door that faced the iron one&mdash;a rat in a
stopped run, panicking this and that way.</p>

<p>Jeremy struck another match and Grim tried the inside door. As
he laid his hand on it the fugitive, finding retreat cut off below,
came charging back and Grim recoiled against the wall, guarding
with the blackthorn like a single stick. The man in yellow lunged
at him with a knife such as the other two had used, but as he
lurched forward with his weight behind the thrust the point of
another knife knocked his upper front-teeth out and cut through his
upper lip, emerging an inch or two, then turning crimson in the
flow of blood. Through the opened inner door came red light glowing
and diminishing&mdash;glowing and diminishing&mdash;silhouetting
Ali of Sikunderam.</p>

<p>"It is all in the trick of the thrust, <i>sahibs</i> ,"
announced Ali, stooping over the victim to withdraw his beloved
weapon. "See&mdash;the neck is broken&mdash;thus&mdash;the point of
the knife goes in between two vertebrae, and Allah does the
rest!"</p>

<p>"What's that fire below there?" Grim demanded.</p>

<p>"The old kiln. Rammy sahib&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's burning?"</p>

<p>"All the priest's books, praise Allah!"</p>

<p>Grim's face looked ghastly in the waning red light. In that
moment he saw all his hopes go up in smoke and flame.</p>

<p>"There'll be a blaze through the top of the chimney by now
that'll bring the whole fire brigade!" he announced with
resignation.</p>

<p>"Not a bit. Trust Ramsden," said another voice.</p>

<p>Athelstan King came up like a stoker from a ship's inferno, more
than a little singed and sucking burned finger-ends.</p>

<p>"Ramsden found an old sheet of corrugated iron underneath the
litter and bent it to fit the fire-door. The draft's in control. It
was hot work."</p>

<p>"And the books?" Grim asked him.</p>

<p>"Napoo! No more books! Where's the padre?"</p>

<p>"Fast asleep."</p>

<p>"When he learns this it'll kill him," said King with conviction,
unconsciously confirming Jeremy's first guess.</p>

<p>Ramsden came up the narrow stairway and demanded light. The glow
behind him was so low that his bulk in the door obscured it
altogether. Grim cautioned him and opened the door into Cyprian's
room. The light fell on Ramsden's singed beard and his clothes all
charred in patches.</p>

<p>"All red ash now," he whispered. "No more smoke." Jeremy tiptoed
into the bedroom and stood looking down at Cyprian. Presently he
felt his pulse.</p>

<p>"Fever!" he whispered. "He's unconscious."</p>

<p>Ramsdell gathered tip the man with the broken wrist and leg and
laid him on the floor in Cyprian's room. They all trooped in,
followed by Ali and his sons, Chullunder Ghose last. The babu was
the only one who showed any symptoms of contentment, although he,
too, was singed, and burned about the hands.</p>

<p>"Expensive consideration for man with family on microscopic
stipend!" he remarked, removing a burned silk turban and
readjusting it. "What shall do next?"</p>

<p>None answered. None knew exactly what to do. One of Ali's
sons&mdash;the youngest&mdash;succumbed to the weak man's impulse
to invoke the Blessing of the Platitudes.</p>

<p>"Silence is golden," he announced sententiously.</p>

<p>"Oh excellent advice! O god out of a Greecian box! O oracle!"
Chullunder Ghose exclaimed. "All the wisdom of all those wicked
books is incarnated into this fool! Silence is not only golden, it
is silent! Silence is as silence does! <i>Verb</i> very <i>sap!</i>
O <i>sahibs</i> , let us muzzle all these men! Shut up this shop
until darkness intervenes, then beat it, in jargon of Jimgrim
sahib&mdash;same expressive&mdash;very! Beat all concerned, this
prisoner included unless the gives us every information, plus!"</p>

<p>"Plus what?" asked Ramsden.</p>

<p>"Plus obedience&mdash;not like these sons of Himalayan mothers,
whose only virtue is that they economize by sleeping mostly in the
jail!"</p>

<p>Ali was over by the window, looking out into the street.</p>

<p>"My sons are here," he announced grandiloquently, trying to hide
a grin.</p>

<p>"Where? Outside? Call them in!" King snapped. "We don't want
more publicity."</p>

<p>Ali threw the window open and beckoned. The sons came lumbering
up-stairs like half-trained animals.</p>

<p>"Tell the <i>sahibs</i> : how did you leave the jail?" demanded
Ali. Maybe intuition warned him that they had a splendid lie all
cooked and ready to serve.</p>

<p>"We fought our way out! See&mdash;we left our knives in the guts
of the police! Each of us slew three men!"</p>

<p>"Allah! My boys! My sons!" exclaimed Ali.</p>

<p>The others all looked down at Cyprian. Jeremy took a towel and
put water on the old man's parched lips. None&mdash;not even
Ali&mdash;as much as half-believed the story of the fight with the
police, but all knew it was based on lawlessness of some sort that
would not add to Cyprian's peace of mind when he should recover
consciousness.</p>

<p>"If he pulls through this, the worry and disappointment will
kill him anyhow," said Ramsden, rather ignoring the circumstance
that for upward of eighty years Cyprian had been training himself
to withstand the slings of fortune.</p>

<p>"We might give the old boy a chance," suggested Jeremy. And in
his eye there gleamed antipodean mischief.</p>

<p>Ali was still at the window.</p>

<p>"Lo, a constabeel!" he announced. "He observes smoke issuing
from the chimney without a tikut.[*] Lo, he speaks with Narayan
Singh, who lies to him. A child can tell you when a Sikh lies. Lo,
he writes a reeport in his parketbuk.[**] There will be a summons
before municipal magistrates. I know the custom."</p>

<p>[*Ticket. The English word is used to mean any kind of pointed
and numbered permit.]</p>

<p>[** Pocketbook.]</p>

<p>Narayan Singh, a little weak yet as to equilibrium, came
up-stairs and thrust his head cautiously through the bedroom
doorway.</p>

<p>"There will be a summons for smoke-nuisance against a Hindu,
name of Murgamdass," he announced with a grin.</p>

<p>Grim caught all eyes, glancing from face to face, as a captain
measures up his team in an emergency.</p>

<p>"Did the policeman appear suspicious?" he asked quietly.</p>

<p>"Very!" Narayan Singh answered. "He suspected a Hindu of seeking
to avoid payment of fee for necessary permit to use furnace within
municipality. I confirmed his plausible suspicion,
hoping&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Anything else?" Grim asked him.</p>

<p>"No, <i>sahib</i> . Nothing else."</p>

<p>"You fellows game?"</p>

<p>Grim caught all eyes again. If they were not game, none are.
There were all the brands and all the elements of that geist that
is all-conquering because it simply cannot understand defeat.</p>

<p>"Two courses," Grim announced. "We can call in the police, and
quit."</p>

<p>Chullunder Ghose sighed like a grampus coming up for air.</p>

<p>"Or we can carry on and face the consequences. Vote please.
Those in favor&mdash;"</p>

<p>Chullunder Ghose raised both hands; all the others one.</p>

<p>"Ayes have it. Very well. Then after dark we'll take these two
dead yellow-boys and plant them where their friends put da Gama.
Meanwhile, take Cyprian somewhere and get a good doctor for him.
Don't say who he is. Ali, you and your sons guard the prisoner
while we find a good place to hide him in."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch10" name="ch10">CHAPTER X</a><br>
"Can't hatch a chicken from a glass egg."</h2>

<p class="first">THAT night there stood in front of Cyprian's an
ox-cart, tented and painted to resemble the equipage of
old-fashioned country gentry's womenfolk. Chullunder Ghose had
conjured the thing from somewhere, magnificent Guzerati bullocks
included, selecting the form of conveyance least likely to be
interfered with by police.</p>

<p>But to make assurance on that ground doubly sure there was
Narayan Singh as driver, naked of leg and otherwise garbed as a
Hindu, reenforced by Ramsden and two of Ali's sons, the latter
shaven, and so angry at having to adopt Hindu disguise that it
would have called for a whole squad of "constabeels" to arrest
them.</p>

<p>Directed by Ramsden the corpses of the two followers of Kali
were laboriously trundled by the oxen as far as possible in the
direction of the scene of da Gama's death, and thence carried by
Ali's protesting sons, who dumped them naked into the débris where
the Portuguese had lain, and rolled the same broken pillar over
both of them that once had helped to hide da Gama's remains.</p>

<p>Judged as corpses they would have looked more edifying in the
orange- yellow smocks they wore in life, but smocks, dyed just that
color, are not purchasable in the open market. Thrift is
thrift&mdash;the careful use of opportunity.</p>

<p>In another part of Delhi a more dangerous negotiation was
proceeding, rendered no easier by the almost unconquerable yearning
to fall asleep that was the natural consequence of two nights'
wakefulness in Punjab heat.</p>

<p>It was Jeremy's proposal. Grim had seconded. King demurred.
Chullunder Ghose had so squealed and chuckled with approval, vowing
the whole proposal a stroke of genius "better than the gods could
think of," that King gave in.</p>

<p>They drove the still unconscious Cyprian, wrapped in a blanket,
to Gauri's house and lodged him there&mdash;a member of an order of
strict celibates, in the house of a lady of Rahab's trade!</p>

<p>"What's the odds? He doesn't know it," argued Jeremy.</p>

<p>The lady was over ears and eyes in delicious
responsibility&mdash;intrigued until her fat ribs shook with
giggling&mdash;unaware of the patient's identity, for they had put
him into a nightshirt, but as sure as that the stars were shining,
that life&mdash;her life as she loved it&mdash;was being lived.</p>

<p>"If you hold your tongue you shall have for yourself one full
share, equal to that of each of us, in whatever we discover," Grim
explained to her.</p>

<p>"But let one hint drop, and you eat my knife!" said Ali. And
Gauri believed both of them.</p>

<p>In all lands where the laws are written for the benefit of
privilege there are smugglers&mdash;not only of contraband jewels
and rum, but of contraband knowledge and skill. There are men, who
belong to no certified profession, who can do as well for you in
the way of experience, and at half the price, as any blockade
runner can in the matter of lace or tobacco. No license confers
skill, any more than payment of the duty improves art. Many a
doctor, barricaded from or pitched out neck and crop from his
profession knows more than the exclusive orthodox. But he has to
follow Aesculapius and Galen in peril of imprisonment and fine.
That is the point. He must not talk.</p>

<p>None knew, and none cared, why Doctor Cornelius MacBarron might
not any longer use the title legally that his patients conferred on
him gratefully, whether the law approved or not. For one thing he
was an Eurasian&mdash;fifty-fifty&mdash;Caledonian Light Infantry
on one side, and a dark mama&mdash;no sinecure to go through life
with. So he might not choose. What people said to or concerning him
he had to tolerate, extracting now and then advertisement, more
profitable than solacing, from the scandalous&mdash;even if
merited&mdash;slanders of the regular professionals.</p>

<p>It was bruited abroad in Delhi&mdash;behind the drugstore
counters, and in mess-rooms, and elsewhere&mdash;that at absurdly
reasonable prices Cornelius MacBarron would cure anything&mdash;and
what's more, hold his peace. He was said to have quite a wide
following, and to know more secrets than a banker.</p>

<p>Whatever he knew, and whomever he recognized, he said nothing
when brought in a cab in broad daylight to the Gauri's scandalous
abode. With the long, lantern jaws and raw bones of a Scotsman, sad
brown eyes, an unenthusiastic presence and a sallow skin, he did
not seem to invite conversation or curiosity. Rather he repelled
both.</p>

<p>"There's your man," said Jeremy, showing him Cyprian in Gauri's
scented bed. "Cure him if you can."</p>

<p>MacBarron did not ask, "Who is he?" but "Is he hurt?"</p>

<p>"No. Sick. Old. That's all," answered Jeremy.</p>

<p>"My fee will be fifty rupees&mdash;per visit," MacBarron
announced, as if saying his prayers.</p>

<p>Jeremy produced the money. MacBarron folded it, and spoke
again&mdash;</p>

<p>"Leave me alone with him, please."</p>

<p>Whereat Jeremy demurred, but was overruled by the others, who
conceded, under the inspiration of Chullunder Ghose, that it was
reasonable. A man without the right to practise has excuse for
dispensing with witnesses.</p>

<p>MacBarron emerged from the bedroom about fifteen minutes later
and announced, like a verger opening pews, that in his opinion the
patient would recover.</p>

<p>"He must lie still. Here is a prescription. Let him drink it as
often as he will. You may pay me now for a second visit; that is
wiser."</p>

<p>So they paid him, and he was on his way to the waiting cab when
King detained him.</p>

<p>"Not so swiftly! We've another job. Do you mind walking?"</p>

<p>MacBarron minded nothing if he was paid. King led him through
narrow streets to a place where three alleys came together on the
right-hand side and a high wall on the left with a narrow door in
it concealed the lower story of a minaret, whose mosque had long
since succumbed to the ravages of time.</p>

<p>The door opened when King struck three blows on it, and Ali's
dark face appeared in a challenging scrutiny.</p>

<p>"He groans much, but says nothing at all," Ali announced
abruptly, and turned his back to lead them in.</p>

<p>The minaret was Ali's good provision. <i>Wakf</i> , the system
of Moslem endowments for charitable purposes, is as liable to abuse
as any other human scheme for standing off the evil day. Ali's
blood-brother, having lent his sword in a blood-feud to which a
wealthy merchant in the Chandni Chowk was party, was now in receipt
of a comfortable income and the job of muezzin to a minaret without
a mosque. In theory he was supposed to cry the summons to prayer at
the appointed times, but in practise he was neither seen nor heard,
lest busybodies should inquire into the source of his revenue.</p>

<p>Naturally, no man with a sinecure like that would be willing to
share it for nothing. He demanded hotel prices, and was indignant
when Ali withheld ten per cent. as his own commission. But the
virtue of him was that he was just as much bent on secrecy as
anyone, and the watch he kept in consequence was priceless. Even
after Ali had admitted King and MacBarron within the wall Ali's
brother examined them and grumbled at having to entertain half
Delhi.</p>

<p>"Is this a <i>Salleevayshun-armee-khana</i> ?" he demanded.</p>

<p>King led MacBarron by the winding inner stair to a room at the
top of the minaret, where the muezzin was supposed to sleep, and
whence the now decrepit gallery was reached by a narrow door in the
masonry. The door was closed, and such light as was available came
through a six-inch slit in the wall, for Ali's brother would permit
no artificial light for fear of attracting attention.</p>

<p>On a truck bed in the darkest part of the round room lay the
sole survivor of the three who had burned Cyprian's books. The
whites of his eyes gleamed in darkness, but the rest of him was
nearly invisible, for they had taken his yellow robe away, and his
coppery, dry skin was of a shade that nearly matched the gloom. It
was too hot to endure blankets.</p>

<p>MacBarron glanced at him, and then at King without visible
emotion.</p>

<p>"My fee will be a thousand rupees," he announced.</p>

<p>"Check do?"</p>

<p>"Cash."</p>

<p>King was obliged to return and obtain the money from Grim. That
took time, because Grim had to send a messenger to cash his check.
When King reached the minaret again the prisoner's leg was already
in plaster of Paris brought by Ali from a Goanese apothecary's, and
the wrist was being manipulated in spite of the Hindu's protests.
They had tied him to the bed; there was no other way of controlling
him. The only thing he had not done to make trouble for them was to
cry aloud.</p>

<p>"That arm must come off," announced MacBarron five minutes after
King's return. "The reason is this&mdash;"</p>

<p>He went into details, deeply technical, displaying the same
fearlessness in diagnosis that an engineer does when ordering parts
of a locomotive scrapped. His objection to witnesses had vanished,
for it was obvious that none of this secretive batch of clients
would dare to expose him; and he had sufficient sense for
situations not to ask the prisoner's permission. The whole
conversation was in English until he bent over the bed at last and,
looking straight into the victim's eyes, said curtly in
Punjabi&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your arm must come off at the elbow."</p>

<p>That produced speech at last&mdash;coppery, resonant argument
all mixed with threats intended to convey one point of principle:
Anything&mdash;anything went; they might burn him living; he would
not resist. But he would enter whole into the next world, with his
right wrist fit for Kali's service! If they sought to take his arm
off he would work a vengeance on them! If they did not believe
that, let them take the first step!</p>

<p>"Hocus-pocus!" said MacBarron, not particularly <i>sotto
voce</i> .</p>

<p>"Is the leg all right?" King asked him.</p>

<p>"It is set. It will heal. He will limp."</p>

<p>"Good enough. Please come again this evening," said King.</p>

<p>"To cut the arm off? Very well. That is two visits in
twenty-four hours. Two hundred rupees extra. In advance."</p>

<p>King paid him, and he went.</p>

<p>"By Allah, we of Sikunderam, who think we will plunder India
when the British go, must first take lessons from that man!"
remarked Ali.</p>

<p>"Go below and keep watch!" ordered King, and in a minute he and
the prisoner were alone together, looking in each other's eyes.</p>

<p>"Want to lose your arm?"</p>

<p>The man grinned in agony. The grin was half-grimace, but there
was defiance and even amusement there.</p>

<p>"The arm that knows the trick of the handkerchief&mdash;the
killing arm?"</p>

<p>King put as much cruelty and mockery as he could summon into his
voice.</p>

<p>But the trouble was that King knew well how far in the worst
extremity he would be willing to go. And what was strength of
character, too manly to take full advantage of helplessness even
for any reward, the other could read but could not understand. He
misinterpreted it as weakness&mdash;fear. Whereas about the only
fear King has (and that unspoken&mdash;secret&mdash;sacred in his
inner-being) is that he may not in some crisis quit himself as if
all the decent fellows in the world were looking on.</p>

<p>"Will you amputate?" asked the Hindu, pointing to the injured
wrist with his other hand and grinning again. He had feared
MacBarron. He was no more afraid of King than a priest is of
policemen. The worst of it was King knew well that, whatever power
this fellow might have of summoning assistance without the use of
obvious means, he would not use it except in dire necessity.</p>

<p>There is no rule more strict than that, probably because the
penalty for breach of it is unimaginably awful. Radio is a joke, a
mere clumsy subterfuge, compared to the gift some Indians have of
communicating with one another across great distances. Every man
who has the least acquaintance with the East knows that. But they
don't give up their secret even in extremity, or use it without
unquestionable reason.</p>

<p>It was possible that he might tell secrets under the torture and
fear of amputation. But King was not morally capable of doing that.
Instead he tried bribery&mdash;a bargain he would have said.</p>

<p>"Keep your arm and join us. You may have one full share in any
discovery we make."</p>

<p>The man laughed genuinely&mdash;just as copper-voiced as he was
copper-skinned. It was as if some devil in an unseen world had
reached over and struck a gong in this one&mdash;three rising notes
and then the overtones, all mockery.</p>

<p>King laughed too, on a descending scale. He
appreciated&mdash;what few from the Western Hemisphere can
realize&mdash;that money, a material reward, or any of the
compensations that the West deems valuable have no weight whatever
in the calculations of the thinking East. The politicians and a few
of the bunnia class have swapped old lamps for new, but at the very
mention of western money or wisdom the old East laughs. She can
afford to.</p>

<p>"All right," King said. "Where are we then?" He turned his face
away deliberately, as if discouraged. "If I can't overcome you,
what do you propose to do with me?"</p>

<p>He gave the man time to consider that, then met his eyes
again&mdash;objective-thinking Anglo-Saxon challenging the East
that thinks subjectively or not at all. Neither could pierce the
other's veil.</p>

<p>"You are no use," said the Hindu, letting his head fall back on
the folded blanket that served for pillow. His eyes were alight
with fever.</p>

<p>In spite of the intolerable heat King made sure that the door
leading out to the gallery was locked, for whoever dares set limits
to the capacity of esoteric India is likely to find himself
surprised. Then he left him, giving orders below to keep on the
<i>qui vive</i> and not to give the prisoner water or information.
He would let the man torture himself a while and lift his veil in
his own way.</p>

<p>And presently at Gauri's house, superintended and giggled over
by Gauri and her maid, King, Grim and Jeremy put on the three
orange-yellow smocks that had been the garb of the enemy, coppering
their skins with some compound of vegetable greases that Gauri
procured for them, and changing every expression of their faces
until Gauri and the rest pronounced them perfect strangers. Then
Grim and Jeremy submitted to King's drill, which was exasperating
in insistence on minutest details, Gauri prompting him.</p>

<p>"Do you think you could manipulate a handkerchief the way you
saw it done?" King asked, tossing one of Gauri's long silk scarfs
to Jeremy.</p>

<p>He imitated perfectly the swift, apparently effortless pass from
hand to hand. There is nothing that Jeremy can't imitate. Nothing
was lacking except the will to kill by strangling the victim, and
the secret of how it is done.</p>

<p>"Can't hatch a chicken from a glass egg," he said
apologetically. "I'm safe until I thug somebody."</p>

<p>King was insatiable&mdash;drilling, drilling, making them repeat
all manner of proposed behavior in emergency, until they struck at
last from very weariness, and Gauri brought cooling drinks and
comfort in the shape of flattery.</p>

<p>"Perfect!" she told them.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, this deferential babu, like wholesale tiger
smelling traps invariably, would better accompany this expedition,"
said Chullunder Ghose. "Obesity is only
disadvantage&mdash;curiosity impelling&mdash;adipose
impeding&mdash;striking happy medium at all times&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You be still!" commanded King.</p>

<p>"Certainly, <i>sahib</i> ! I desist! Am silent! Sublime
satisfaction in service of noblemen makes obedient babu dumb! Your
humble servant. Mum's the word, like Yankee skirmisher in No Man's
Land! Nevertheless&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, looking up under lowered eyelids like a meek,
ridiculous, fat schoolgirl.</p>

<p>Grim recognized the reference to a Yankee skirmisher as an
appeal to himself. "Spill it!" he ordered. "Be quick."</p>

<p>"Silence being self-imposed on all three <i>sahibs</i> ,
somebody should come along to scintillate with clever verbiage.
Self being otherwise unoccupied&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whatever you said would give the game away," Grim interrupted
severely.</p>

<p>"Even secret hymn to goddess Kali?"</p>

<p>He intoned it, throwing out his chest and making a pig's snout
of his fat lips around the lower bass notes, that rumble and roll
like the voice of the underworld glorifying in destruction, making
of cruelty, death and disease sweet satisfaction for the dreadful
bride of Siva. Few ever heard that hymn who were not initiates of
Kali's dreadful cult, or&mdash;</p>

<p>"Were you ever held for the sacrifice?" King asked him
suddenly.</p>

<p>"<i>Sahib</i> , I am superstitious! Reference to secret details
of risky past might cause repetition of same, which decency forbid!
Am dumb!"</p>

<p>He would not tell how he had learned that hymn. He knew the
value of it, and of silence. He was indispensable.</p>

<p>"No extra charge!" he announced with pursed lips.</p>

<p>"One break and you're fired!" said Grim.</p>

<p>"One break and we are all dead!" he retorted. "Awful!
Yet&mdash;at my age&mdash;nevertheless&mdash;how many last chances
I have had! Cat-o'-nine tails is rank outsider compared to most of
us! Whoever boasted of dying daily had me in mind. <i>Verb. sap</i>
."</p>

<p>They waited until long after dark, when Ramsden reported the
safe disposal of two corpses, and was detailed to take care of
Cyprian.</p>

<p>"Tell him he's in the house of an Indian gentleman, whose wife
can't very well interview him in her husband's absence," Grim
advised. "Say his own place was full of gas, so we had to lock it
up. If he asks any more questions, tell him the doctor says he must
sleep."</p>

<p>Narayan Singh was told off to await the doctor. Then the three,
Chullunder Ghose following, set forth on what was actually a
forlorn hope.</p>

<p>"Pray, you men!" said King, half-laughing. "If we can't get an
inside track to the Nine through this man, we may as well admit
defeat. He's dry&mdash;full of fever&mdash;in
pain&mdash;half-conscious. We can fool him now or never."</p>

<p>They could almost fool themselves. Their shadows on the street
wall so resembled the parts they played that they had the sensation
of being followed by assassins, the heavy footsteps of Chullunder
assisting the suggestion.</p>

<p>They totally fooled Ali of Sikunderam and his suspicious
brother. Ali thrust his long knife through the partly opened door
in the wall and threatened to disembowel the lot of them unless
they made themselves scarce.</p>

<p>"By Allah, shall a Hindu set foot on the sacred threshold of a
mosque?" he demanded, as the rightful keeper of the place shifted a
lantern this way and that behind him to expose the intruders
better.</p>

<p>The voice of Chullunder Ghose was revelation&mdash;impiously
making use of holy writ from the shadows in the rear:</p>

<p>"And they came unto their own, but their own received them not.
Even in A. D. seventy they knew the nature of Sikunderam! Give sop
to Cerberus, <i>sahibs</i> ! Price of admission is payable in
Beehive brandy!"</p>

<p>"I knew it all along!" said Ali with a curt laugh.</p>

<p>"Aye, any fool would know it;" his brother agreed.</p>

<p>"Open the door then, fools!"</p>

<p>Chullunder Ghose waddled in first, pushing aside the two
custodians, bowing in his three employers, retiring again behind
them to hold up both hands like the leader of an orchestra
directing <i>pianissimo</i> . Thereafter not a word was said.</p>

<p>In creaking, bat-winged darkness they four mounted the minaret
stairs, pausing each half-dozen steps to listen for sounds from
above. Chullunder Ghose, holding a flask of water destined for the
prisoner's use when he should acquire the right to it by bargain,
stopped on the rickety floor below the upper room and sat,
cross-legged, with his face toward the opening through which the
other three must pass&mdash;a square hole at the stair-head. Low
sounds&mdash;human speech assuredly&mdash;emerged through it, using
some other than the ordinary language of the streets.</p>

<p>The words ceased as King in the lead reached midway up the last
flight of stairs. A face appeared in the opening&mdash;coppery even
in that dim gloom&mdash;a new face, not the prisoner's. King, never
hesitating, took the next step and the others followed. A word
would have betrayed them. But even the babu&mdash;he
particularly&mdash;rose to the heights of instant self-
command.</p>

<p>A stanza of the hymn to Kali rose from the babu's throat like a
burst of faraway organ music, and the face in the opening withdrew.
King went on up. He had not hesitated. He was not lost.</p>

<p>Keeping step, not harrying, not looking to the right or left but
purposely moving like men in a dream, the other two followed him
through and sat down along-side him in the attitude the three
book-burners had taken on Cyprian's yak-hair carpet, Jeremy at one
end.</p>

<p>The owner of the unexpected face thrust his hand against the
door that led to the gallery, letting in sufficient star-light to
reveal the orange-yellow of his long smock. Then he sat down facing
them, with his back to the wall by the head of the bed.</p>

<p>He said something, using a language that is
dead&mdash;extinct&mdash;that never did exist according to some
authorities. Instead of attempting to answer, all three bowed low
from the waist with their hands palms-outward, like temple images
come to life. And again Chullunder Ghose's gorgeous barytone burst
forth in praise of death.</p>

<p>There is this about ancient mysteries. Nine-tenths of them, if
not more, are forgotten and the words a generation passes to the
next one&mdash;"mouth to ear and the word at low breath"&mdash;if
not a substitute are no more than a fragment of lost knowledge. He
who had spoken in perhaps the mother-tongue of lost Atlantis was
content to carry on in Punjabi.</p>

<p>"Ye heard his call, too? Brothers, ye were awake! I came up the
outside and broke the lock with a chisel. Ye were cleverer! Ye did
not slay, for I hear the voices of the guards down-stairs. Ye did
well. Are there orders? Ye are not of my Nine, for ye make no
answer to the signal."</p>

<p>Speech was impossible. Their one chance was to pretend to a vow
of silence, such as <i>fakirs</i> often take. Instead of speaking
Jeremy flicked the handkerchief from one hand to the other with the
diabolical, suggestive swiftness of a past-practitioner of
Thugee.</p>

<p>The man by the head of the bed betrayed astonishment&mdash;maybe
disgust.</p>

<p>"By whose order should he die?" he demanded. "I have tested him
according to rule. He has not betrayed. His failure is not
complete. He&mdash;they&mdash;two of them are dead&mdash;burned all
the books because they could take none. This one sent the Silent
Call to give us information. He deserves life."</p>

<p>He paused for an answer. And the first sign having succeeded,
Jeremy repeated it&mdash;as an executioner whose patience was
exhaustible.</p>

<p>Promptly, as if they had rehearsed that very combination,
Chullunder Ghose sang of the death that is Kali's life, and his
voice boomed through the opening in praise of pain that is Kali's
ease&mdash;and of want that is her affluence.</p>

<p>That tide in the affairs of men that Shakespeare sang was surely
at flood that night! It brimmed the dyke. He by the head of the bed
was aware of it, restlessly.</p>

<p>"The Nines are no longer interlocked as formerly," he grumbled.
"One Nine has an order that another counteracts. There is
confusion. There is too much slaying to hide clumsiness. Our plan
was patterned on the true plan of the Nine Unknown, but we are a
bad smell compared to their breath of roses! They know, and are
Unknown. We do not know, and too many know of us."</p>

<p>A thrill that commenced with King and passed through Grim
reached Jeremy, but none of them confessed to it. They sat still,
expressionless, three bronze faces staring straight forward, only
Jeremy's fingers moving in the overture to death. The long silk
handkerchief flicked back and forth like a thread in the loom of
the Fates.</p>

<p>The man on the bed groaned dismally, and as if that were a
signal for the bursting of the dyke that stood between ignorance
and understanding&mdash;for there always is a dyke between the two,
and always a weak point where the dyke will yield if men can only
find it&mdash;he by the head of the bed called up from his
inner-man the lees of long-ago forgotten manliness. Then not in
anger, but calmly as became a follower of the Destroyer's Wife, he
cast his ultimatum at the three.</p>

<p>"I, who shall be slain for saying this, yet say this. Listen,
ye! Dumb be the spirit in you as the lips your vow has sealed! This
man, whom ye have come to kill because he failed, lest failure be a
cause of danger to worse devils than ourselves&mdash;is my
friend!"</p>

<p>He paused, appearing to expect some sign of astonishment.
Friendship is treason to Kali. Comment was due, and Chullunder
Ghose obliged, hymning new stanzas in praise of Her who
annihilates.</p>

<p>"This man once spared me. I spare him. Ye shall not sacrifice
him. Hear me! I came, not knowing who he was. Ye came, knowing.
Your orders are to kill <i>him</i> . Mine are to go to Benares and
slay one said to be a true Initiate of the Nine. But I am weary of
all this. Ye <i>shall</i> not slay; I <i>will</i>
not&mdash;unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused again, making no motion with his hands. But he left no
doubt there was a weapon within reach with which the argument might
be continued if convenient to all concerned. Jeremy's hands moved,
but only to manipulate the handkerchief. He, Grim and King all had
pistols, so no need for hurry. King broke silence, sparing words
like one who mistrusts speech&mdash;</p>

<p>"We three have grown so weary of it all that a watch was set on
us, lest we fail."</p>

<p>Confirming that, Chullunder Ghose's barytone hymned one more
stanza to the Queen of Death. The man on the bed groaned wearily.
In the street the sound of revelry&mdash;the last verse of a
drunkard's love-song&mdash;announced and disguised the news that
Narayan Singh arrived on the scene with the doctor.</p>

<p>"If there is only one who watches you, is there any reason why
we four should fear him?" asked the man by the head of the bed.</p>

<p>That sounded like a trap. In dealing with the secret
brotherhoods it is safe to suspect that every other question is
asked for precaution's sake. The wrong answer would be an
astringent, drying up confidence at the source.</p>

<p>"So be <i>one</i> died&mdash;" said King, not daring yet to
speak openly, because he did not know the key-phrases that identify
man to man.</p>

<p>The other nodded.</p>

<p>"I am not an executioner," he said. "Let your brother use his
skill."</p>

<p>And he nodded suggestively at Jeremy. The man on the bed groaned
again. Chullunder Ghose was absolutely still. From below came
Narayan Singh's carousal song and the voices of Ali and his brother
commanding silence in the name of decency.</p>

<p>It began to be clear to King that his suspicion was
accurate&mdash;that the members of one Nine did not know the
members of any other Nine and had no means of challenging. Each
Nine reported to its chief, who in turn was one of nine. That was
what da Gama said, and though the Portuguese was not to be believed
without deliberation, even deliberation must have limits. King took
the chance.</p>

<p>"I have no means of testing you," he said. "You do not respond
to my signs."</p>

<p>"Nor you to mine, brother! Let us then give pledges satisfactory
to each."</p>

<p>"If we let this fellow live," King answered, and paused,
observing that the man by the head of the bed pricked his ears.</p>

<p>He remembered that as Kali's follower he must not offer to
deprive the goddess altogether of her prey. There must be a
substitute.</p>

<p>"Will you betray the Initiate of the Nine to us in Benares in
order that we may not fail to make Her a sacrifice?"</p>

<p>"No!" came the answer&mdash;abrupt and firm. "Substitute him who
sings to Her below there!"</p>

<p>It was time for heroic measures. Insofar as reason applies to
murder, he was reasonable. And besides, King was aware of a sound
in the outer darkness that Chullunder Ghose heard too, for the babu
sang to drown it.</p>

<p>"I believe you are an impostor! I believe you know nothing of
Benares! I believe you are that faithless member of another Nine
whom we were told to watch for! If there should be a substitute I
think that thou&mdash;"</p>

<p>King pointed an accusing finger at him. Jeremy made the
handkerchief perform like a living thing. It even looked
hungry.</p>

<p>"Nay, nay!" said the other.</p>

<p>"Show me proofs!" said King.</p>

<p>The subtle noises in the night had ceased and there was now no
cause for hurry. It was almost possible to see&mdash;as one could
sense&mdash;the pallor on his face as the man by the head of the
bed reached out to push the door a little wider open and admit more
starlight. Whatever his weapon was, he had to see clearly to use
it. As his wrist reached out across the opening a huge hand closed
on it&mdash;from outside.</p>

<p>It was no use screaming, though the blood ran cold. The
followers of Kali train themselves to self-control. It was no use
moving, because two repeating pistols, King's and Grim's covered
him.</p>

<p>He could not speak. Terror, the stronger for being suppressed,
gripped him tighter than the unknown hand that held his wrist
against the door-frame like material in a vise.</p>

<p>The door of the minaret below slammed suddenly, and one man was
heard to enter. King felt the wheels of destiny turn once and drop
the finished solution like a gift into his hand. Destiny had chosen
the right man, and his assistants waited on him, saying nothing,
offering no advice, not even glancing sidewise to observe him. It
was apparent to the man by the head of the bed that they, all three
acted on instructions in accordance with a pre-arranged plan, that
which is obvious being untrue nine times out of ten.</p>

<p>"You are he whom we should watch for," King said slowly. "There
is talk of your sedition. That is why, they sent you to Benares.
That is why you were picked to sacrifice that true Initiate of the
Holy Nine."</p>

<p>King paused and took another long chance. Had not the others
acted in threes? "You were ordered to Benares, where two others
should join you. You, who cannot use the handkerchief, were to be
decoy. We are they who should have met you in Benares! Yet you can
no more tell which of us three are the two than you could escape
from the task imposed on you!"</p>

<p>The man's jaw dropped. He believed himself taken in the toils of
the relentless machine that owned him and a thousand others. There
is no more paralyzing fear than that.</p>

<p>"You would have cheated HER!" said King.</p>

<p>He rose and made a sign to Grim and Jeremy that was not easy to
mistake. They lifted the unconscious prisoner off the bed and,
taking more care of his bandaged leg than was quite in keeping with
the circumstances, carried him down through the opening in the
floor. From below came the sound of one short strangling cry.</p>

<p>"Clumsy!" said King. "He lacks practise!"</p>

<p>Then there was whispering and the sound of a dead weight being
carried down wooden stairs. The door below slammed. There was the
noise of men's feet outside&mdash;then of wheels. First Grim
returned, and then Jeremy. The expression on their faces was of
great elation suppressed and crowded to the point of
near-explosion.</p>

<p>"You will go to Benares. You will lead to the slaying him who
was appointed for the sacrifice. You will be judged thereafter by
the judges."</p>

<p>Some gesture that King made must have been visible from the
outer- gallery, for the hand that held the wrist let go. The door
was shut tight from without. In the ensuing darkness King
descended, leaving Grim and Jeremy to guard the new prisoner, and
Chullunder Ghose, holding both sides in silent laughter that made
tears stream down his cheeks, motioned him toward the ground floor.
Chullunder Ghose remained where he was, wallowing in exquisite
emotion.</p>

<p>Narayan Singh, descending by broken masonry, groping for
foothold, found his foot in King's hands and so reached <i>terra
firma</i> .</p>

<p>"<i>Sahib</i> , it would seem the gods are with us! The doctor
has a place where he can treat that patient better than in this
tower. He and I brought a litter on wheels and men to push it. The
babu signaled me that there were doings up-stairs, so I climbed by
the broken masonry, knowing the value of surprise in an emergency!
Shall the doctor amputate?"</p>

<p>"Tell him no," said King, "but keep him <i>incommunicado</i>
."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch11" name="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a><br>
"Allah! Do I live, and see such sons?"</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was a cellar below the minaret&mdash;a mere
enclosure in between foundations, but no less practicable as a
dungeon on that account. Therein they cached the prisoner with
Narayan Singh and three of Ali's sons on guard, instructed not to
show themselves to the man they guarded but to be as rabid as
wolves at bay toward all trespassers.</p>

<p>Then, because a good rule is to hold your conferences where not
even friends expect you, King Grim and Jeremy went and sat like
great owls in the shadow of a wall above a low roof several hundred
yards away. There they could see one another and not be seen.</p>

<p>King met Grim's eyes. Grim met King's. The two spoke
simultaneously&mdash;</p>

<p>"You were right!"</p>

<p>"Pop Cyprian won't believe it though!" laughed Jeremy, yawning.
"Sleep under the stars, you blighters! Here goes then!"</p>

<p>He curled himself up, and was breathing like a kitten in a
moment.</p>

<p>"There are two Nines!" King said with conviction.</p>

<p>"The real gang, and this Kali outfit!" Grim agreed.</p>

<p>"Right! But as Jeremy says, Cyprian won't believe it."</p>

<p>King faced toward Grim and as if playing cards they tossed
deductions to and fro, each checking each. "One's good. The other's
bad."</p>

<p>"The Kali outfit patterned their organization after the real
Nine's, in the hope of stumbling on the secret."</p>

<p>"They've spotted a real Initiate of the Nine."</p>

<p>"Bet you! Maybe one of the Nine. Marked him down. Expect him in
Benares."</p>

<p>"Told off this man-in-yellow to kill him."</p>

<p>"What for? <i>Qui bono</i> ? Ring in one of their own thugs to
pose as the dead man?"</p>

<p>"Probably. He might discover something before the remaining
Eight get wise."</p>

<p>"But why pick a man who can't use the handkerchief, and whose
loyalty must have been questionable?"</p>

<p>"Probably he's the only one who can identify the proposed
victim."</p>

<p>"If so, they'll watch him."</p>

<p>"Which means they'll have watched him to-night!"</p>

<p>"Uh-huh. They must have seen him enter the minaret."</p>

<p>"Good thing we left Narayan Singh on guard."</p>

<p>"You bet&mdash;and those three sons of Ali's who were in trouble
with the police. They'll fight like wolves."</p>

<p>"All nerves. Better than watch-dogs. What next?"</p>

<p>"Sleep!" said Grim.</p>

<p>And they did sleep&mdash;there on the roof, where none but the
stars and the crescent moon could see them and only Chullunder
Ghose knew where to track them down.</p>

<p>Chullunder Ghose slept too, hands over stomach and chin on
breast, with the broad of his back set flat against a wall and his
whole weight on the trap-door that provided access to the
cellar&mdash;turban over one ear&mdash;so asleep that even minaret
mice (hungrier than they who live in churches) nibbled the thick
skin of his feet without awaking him.</p>

<p>The North&mdash;Sikunderam in particular&mdash;can sleep, too,
when it has no guilty conscience; and it begins to measure guilt at
about the deep degree, where squeamish folk leave off and lump the
rest into one black category. None the less, although the sons of
Ali yawned when Narayan Singh posted them around the iron-railed
gallery, with orders to keep one another awake and summon him at
the first sign of an intruder, yawning was as much as it amounted
to. They sat like vultures on a ledge and listened to the Sikh's
enormous snores that boomed in the waist of the minaret. (He
calculated that the second floor, midway of either, was the key to
the strategic situation.)</p>

<p>Nominally each of Ali's sons from where he sat could view a
hemisphere, so that their vision actually overlapped. But in
practise there was one whose outlook included a high, blank wall,
over which it was humanly impossible for an enemy to approach,
because there were spikes along the wall, and broken glass, and
beyond it were the women's quarters of a much too married
rajah.</p>

<p>So that one&mdash;Habibullah was his name&mdash;was more or less
a free lance, able to reenforce the others or to spell them,
without that extra loss of self-respect that might otherwise have
attended desertion of a fixed post. Narayan Singh had said, "Sit
here&mdash;and here&mdash;and here." Burt he had evidently meant
"Divide the circle up between you." So Habibullah construed it, the
other two confirming; but it was an hour before anything happened.
Then:</p>

<p>"One beckons," said Ormuzd&mdash;he facing due east. There was a
roof in that direction on which the light from a half-shuttered
upper window fell like a sheet of gold-leaf. "One sits like a frog
in a pool and beckons. Come and see."</p>

<p>So Habibullah, having faced west long enough, changed his
position and sat by Ormuzd.</p>

<p>"Huh! He beckons. Is his garment yellow, like that of him we
slew in the jail, or does the light make it seem so?"</p>

<p>They watched with the infinite patience of Hillmen and all
hunting animals, until the third brother came around to lend two
eyes of flint&mdash;just one look and away again, back to his
post.</p>

<p>"He beckons," he agreed.</p>

<p>"Does he beckon to us or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To us!" said Habibullah. "Moreover, he is clothed in yellow.
The light shows it. He is one of those who loosed us from the
jail."</p>

<p>As if confirming Habibullah's words, the man on the roof in the
pool of light raised up a Himalayan <i>tulwar</i> , shaped so
exactly like the one that Ormuzd left in the police station that
the two who saw it thrilled like women seeing a lost child. The
northern knife is more than knife.</p>

<p>"What does he want with us, think you?"</p>

<p>"Go and see!"</p>

<p>"That drunken dog of a Sikh who snores within there will awake
and&mdash; "</p>

<p>"Never mind him. Climb down by the broken edges of the stone. We
have done worse many a time in our Hills."</p>

<p>But caution is as strong as curiosity in the mind of Sikunderam.
No Highlander who followed Bonnie Charlie to his ruin was as hard
to pin down to a course&mdash;or harder to turn from one, once on
his way. Habibullah sat and weighed the pros and
cons&mdash;including the likelihood that he in the pool of light
might be a <i>shaitan</i> &mdash;until the other two cried shame on
him. His reason in the end for going to investigate was fear that
their loud arguing might wake Narayan Singh and that the Sikh might
possibly claim all the credit for some discovery.</p>

<p>Hand over band at last he went down the broken side of the
minaret&mdash;leaped like a goat on to the street wall above the
heads of Ali and his brother, who were sleeping the sleep of
innocence in the shadow of the gate&mdash;and gained the
street.</p>

<p>But none came to meet him, as he had half-hoped. He was left to
his own devices to find a way up to the roof the man had beckoned
from&mdash;not nearly as easy a feat as threading the bat-infested
ledges of eternal hills. In one street an unwise "constabeel"
presumed to demand what his business might be; whereat Habibullah
ran for half-a-mile in zig-zags, never losing direction; and
finally, by way of a stable and the iron roof of a place where they
sold chickens, he climbed to a point of vantage whence he could
look down from darkness into the pool of light.</p>

<p>"<i>His-s-s-t</i> !" he remarked then to attract attention. And
a second later his skin crawled like a sloughing snake's all up his
spine and then down again.</p>

<p>The man in the pool of light took no notice, but another had
leaned out of the darkness almost within arm's reach and, flashing
a little electric torch, grinned straight into his face.</p>

<p>"You should go to him&mdash;go to him&mdash;he beckons, does he
not? Go to him then!" he whispered.</p>

<p>The whisper was the worst part of it. If he had spoken out loud
Habibullah would have tried a little bombast to reassure himself.
As it was, the creepy sensation increased; nor was there any
knowing how many other men there might be grinning at him from the
darkness&mdash;grinning at him who had no knife! He could see one
of his brothers&mdash;just a shadow motionless among the shadows of
the minaret, and the sight made him lonelier than ever.</p>

<p>"Why wait for the handkerchief?" suggested the voice beside him;
and that settled it; Habibullah leaped down on to the roof like a
young bear, making all the noise he naturally could.</p>

<p>But the noise did not startle the man in yellow, who sat in the
midst of the pool of light. It did not as much as annoy him. He
smiled&mdash;a beastly, bronze, arrogant smile that chilled the
blood of Habibullah worse than the other man's whisper had
done.</p>

<p>"You beckoned?" said Habibullah, forgetting that he who speaks
first most often has the worst of it.</p>

<p>The other shifted himself out of the patch of light suddenly,
and left Habibullah standing there.</p>

<p>"Did I beckon a fool for the police to shoot at?" he asked from
behind a chimney. "Their nets are laid. The order is to seize all
strangers from Sikunderam. You and your brothers are as sure of
death as the fat sheep in the butcher's hands, unless&mdash;step
this way out of the light, fool!"</p>

<p>Habibullah obeyed, and was sorry he obeyed, on general
principles.</p>

<p>"Who are <i>you</i> ?" he asked. He tried to make his voice
sound truculent, but it was only desperate. He wished he had not
come.</p>

<p>"You left the jail without asking who I am. Why ask now? Better
obey me."</p>

<p>"In what respect?"</p>

<p>"In all respects!"</p>

<p>Obedience is a hard pill to force down the throat of a Hillman.
The fact that he thought himself helpless did not sweeten the dose
for Habibullah. The other was a Hindu, which made it worse. So he
said nothing, as the only way he knew of nursing his disgust, and
perhaps the man in yellow believed that silence signified assent
(although perhaps not. He was wise in some ways.) Nevertheless, he
proceeded to display his ignorance.</p>

<p>"There are two men dressed like me in that minaret."</p>

<p>"<i>Two</i> men?" said Ali, looking hard at him.</p>

<p>"<i>Two</i> !" he answered positively. "One is injured. One is
whole. The whole one is at fault and the injured one has failed.
Both die to-night. It is your business to admit three of us into
the minaret."</p>

<p>"Mine?"</p>

<p>"Yours and your brothers'."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;Bah! By Allah, what you ask is impossible! We are not
alone there. There is a Sikh&mdash;"</p>

<p>"True. And a babu. Do they not sleep?"</p>

<p>"But there are others, who keep watch outside by the door in the
wall."</p>

<p>"Aye, and <i>they</i> sleep, or how didst thou escape unseen?
Kill them, too, and earn merit!"</p>

<p>Habibullah withdrew again into the silence, for emotion choked
him. He could contemplate killing Narayan Singh and Chullunder
Ghose with comparative calm, even while doubting that three of them
could master the turbulent Sikh. But to murder in cold blood,
without warning, Ali ben Ali of Sikunderam, sire, tutor, patron,
paymaster, hero, bully and belligerent accomplice, was something
that not even sons of the Hills could consider, say nothing of do.
Hardly believing his ears he bridled speech, the slow, dour cunning
of the mountains coming to his aid at last. The limit of amazement
being reached&mdash;fear having worked its worst&mdash;he rose
above both like a swimmer coming up for air.</p>

<p>"How much will you pay?" he demanded.</p>

<p>The man in yellow laughed&mdash;a conquering laugh all full of
scorn and understanding.</p>

<p>"Rupees, a thousand!" he answered.</p>

<p>"Show me! Pay now!"</p>

<p>Habibullah stooped and held his hand out&mdash;mocking. He did
not believe that man in yellow had a thousand rupees, certainly not
that he would part with them. But the other produced a roll and
counted the money out in hundreds:</p>

<p>"&mdash;eight, nine, ten!" he said, placing the lot in the
Hillman's extended hand. "Blood-money! These are witnesses!"</p>

<p>He made a sound exactly like the hum of a bronze bell struck
with a muted hammer. Instantly two faces, thrust forward into the
light like disembodied phantoms, grinned at him.</p>

<p>"Go! Kill! And when you have killed set a lantern on the gallery
of the minaret!"</p>

<p>Habibullah glanced down at the ten bank-notes that his fingers
closed on, and all the Hillman's yearning for the hardest bargain
ever driven surged in his ambitious breast.</p>

<p>"How shall we slay without weapons?" he demanded. "The police
had our <i>tulwars</i> &mdash;"</p>

<p>The man in yellow interrupted him by passing hilt-first the
<i>tulwar</i> that he had used to signal with. It was not
Habibullah's own. He raised it&mdash;possibly to glory in its
balance as it quivered like something golden in the
window-light&mdash;yet even so perhaps not; for the North is quick
to use the unsheathed argument.</p>

<p>He was aware of the click of an old-fashioned pistol in the dark
not far behind him, so he lowered the <i>tulwar</i> again and
thumbed the edge of it. Concession had bred appetite:</p>

<p>"We are three," he said. "We had three weapons&mdash;two more
such as this."</p>

<p>"Aye," came the instant answer. "Thine and another's. That is
not thine. That will be claimed by its owner. Thine and the other
may be had for service rendered."</p>

<p>It was shrewd. No knight of the Middle Ages set a value on
golden spurs one atom greater than the Hillman's superstitious
reverence for his knife. With it he reckons himself a man; without
it, something less, and so is reckoned.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the greater the weight on one side of a bargain,
the more determined should the haggling be. That is scripture.
Habibullah cast about for an alternative and landed a good one at
the first attempt.</p>

<p>"You say two yonder must die? My brothers and I might kill
those, saving trouble with the Sikh, who is a man of mighty wrath,
to kill whom would offend his masters. Better bind him while he
sleeps, and tell him afterwards that others did it. Then kill the
babu, who is useless and has the tongues of ten women. Whereafter
slay&mdash;we three could slay&mdash;the two men you say are due to
die to-night."</p>

<p>That was a long speech for Habibullah. It produced a profound
impression and he struck an attitude while the two disembodied
faces appeared in the shaft of light again and conversed with
number one. They spoke a language he knew nothing of, and displayed
skill in the use of light and shade that was beyond his
understanding, for although he screwed his eyes, and dodged, he
failed to see anything but faces; and in the end he began to be
afraid again, more than half-believing number one was speaking with
spirits of the air.</p>

<p>"Only the spirits don't use pistols," he argued to himself. And
twice he heard the click of a pistol hammer as if someone in the
dark were testing it, not nervously but as a warning. "I would like
to lay this blade just once where the neck of that face should be!"
he thought.</p>

<p>And someone seemed to read his thought, for a pistol in a hand
unconnected with any evident body emerged into the light and warned
him pointblank.</p>

<p>"We should have to see bodies of the slain," said number one at
last in plain Punjabi; and the two faces vanished.</p>

<p>"All Delhi may see them for ought I care!" Habibullab answered,
forgetting for the moment that there was only one prisoner in the
cellar.</p>

<p>"So we should have to enter the minaret."</p>

<p>"Lo, I make you a gift of the minaret!" laughed Habibullah,
growing bolder as he realized his point was gained. These were not
such dangerous people after all. How his brothers would wonder when
he regaled them with the account of his skilful bargaining!</p>

<p>"You will need to arrange for us to enter," said the man in
yellow.</p>

<p>Habibullah was silent, scratching his young beard, pondering
what that proviso meant.</p>

<p>"The guard at the gate must be slain," his interlocutor went on.
And Habibullah's beard continued to be scratched, a row of
milk-white teeth appearing in a gap in the black hair as his lower
lip descended thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Strange arguments appeal to savage minds. The rock on which
Habibullah's wit was chafing itself keen just then was not the
stipulation to kill Ali of Sikunderam (for that was
excluded&mdash;imponderable&mdash;abstract&mdash;not to be reckoned
with, and having no weight)&mdash;but the puzzling, protruding,
concrete circumstance that he in yellow did not dream of entering
the minaret by any other way than the front door.</p>

<p>Could he not climb? Was he lazy, or afraid, or proud? What was
the matter with him? No man, having murder in his mind and able to
command the very captain of the jail, was worth taking seriously if
he only thought in terms of front-doors! Habibullah knew exactly
what to do now.</p>

<p>"There is no other way than to kill those who guard the gate,"
said he in yellow.</p>

<p>"No other way," Habibullah agreed. "I will do it."</p>

<p>"How will you let us know when the work is done and the gate is
unlocked?" the other demanded.</p>

<p>"We will light a lantern and carry it thrice in a circle around
the gallery. Then come swiftly, for we will open the door and wait
for you; and we will tell the Sikh afterwards that it was you who
bound him," said Habibullah.</p>

<p>He was not sure yet what he meant to do. But he was sure he
would outwit the man in yellow, whom he thoroughly despised now,
not fearing him even a little, so mercurial, albeit simple are the
workings of the Hillman intellect. He had the man's money. Why
should he fear him? Who feared fools? Not Habibullah! Father Ali
should have reason to boast of one son this night!</p>

<p>Something of his thought exuded&mdash;emanated&mdash;some vague
aureole of ignorant conceit emerging under the cloak of pretended
assent.</p>

<p>"Remember!" warned the man in yellow. "This is a part of the
price to Kali, payable for your release from jail! There will be
more to pay another time. And he who fails to pay Her the least
particle of Her demand&mdash;is less to be envied than a woman
dying as she bears a dead child!"</p>

<p>Habibullah shuddered, and recovered. He was not a woman, praise
be Allah!</p>

<p>"It is time I go," he said abruptly, and in a moment he had
swung himself down into the street along which he could see the
"constabeel" vainly pursuing imaginary footsteps. He kept behind
the "constabeel" and gained the minaret without accident. He was
minded to beat on the door in the wall and swagger in triumphantly
with all that story to relate and a thousand rupees to confirm it
with. Only the suspicion that the man in yellow possibly could see
him from the roof prevented.</p>

<p>He still did not know how the Hindu should be tricked. He knew
that pocketing the money for a murder he had not the remotest
intention of committing was only part of the business. They must be
fooled to the full taste of Sikunderam, and none&mdash;no man on
Allah's footstool&mdash;could do that half as well as Ali, father
Ali, who was sleeping by his brother at the gate&mdash;father Ali,
wiliness incarnate!</p>

<p>So he climbed the outer-wall like a bear in the hills, making
much less noise than he normally did on level ground. And he
dropped so lightly into shadow on the other side that Ali did not
wake until the hot breath rustled in his ear.</p>

<p>"Look, father Ali! Look!"</p>

<p>He held the money&mdash;all that money!&mdash;most incautiously
in the rays of the hooded candle that bode in a crevice of the wall
against emergency. Ali&mdash;waking&mdash;seized the
money&mdash;naturally&mdash;even before he rubbed his eyes. It was
in the hidden pocket under two shirts, and with a sheepskin jacket
double-buttoned over all, before poor Habibullah could protest.</p>

<p>And then, in the righteous wrath of an outraged sire, Ali ben
Ali rose and cursed his son for daring to absent himself from post
without permission!</p>

<p>"Allah! Do I live&mdash;and see such sons? The dung a pigeon
drops on a ledge will stay there! Yet you leave! O less than
ullage! Less than the stink of a debauch&mdash;for that clings! Son
of all uncleanliness, get to thy perch again!"</p>

<p>So Habibullah went, for there was no gainsaying father Ali. He
who had slain in seven duels the husbands of the mothers who had
borne the sons he claimed, was not to be withstood by one son
single-handed in the hour of rising wrath. The necessary element
was speed, and Habibullah used it, shuddering as a new curse
hounded his retreat.</p>

<p>Nor did he enter the minaret, for that would have been to awaken
the babu and the Sikh too soon, before
he&mdash;Habibullah&mdash;should have time to think. He climbed by
the broken masonry again like a steeplejack, and swung himself up
on the gallery between his wondering brothers.</p>

<p>"Mine!" said one of them, pouncing on the <i>tulwar</i> .</p>

<p>"You shall have it in exchange for mine!" said Habibullah,
snatching it away. "Peace! Listen!" He had done his thinking.
"Father Ali bade me say this: He will beat whichever of you leaves
the gallery! He gave me other work to do."</p>

<p>Which untruth being loosed, and therefore off his conscience,
Habibullah entered the minaret through the gallery door and
descended the creaking stairs, after carefully fastening the door
behind him lest his brothers overhear and make a hash of what
should be a neat, nice piece of strategy.</p>

<p>He was angry with father Ali&mdash;not to the point of rebellion
yet, but full of indignation and desirous of revenge. He was minded
to take his information to a man who, all his faults considered,
was a generous soldier of mettle and resource. The money was gone;
but the chance for a creditable deed remained; and if his own
brains were insufficient for the task, he knew where to find
sufficient ones.</p>

<p>So he stooped over Narayan Singh and checked him in mid-snore.
The Sikh seized his wrist and let go again.</p>

<p>"The foe?" he demanded. "Trespassers?" (Whoever is not friend
comes into Narayan Singh's category of "foe," to be dealt with
accordingly.)</p>

<p>"Hus-s-s-sh!" warned Habibullah. "Let the babu not hear!"</p>

<p>"No! Let the babu sleep!" Chullunder Ghose called up on his seat
on the hatch. "There is first the thunder and then these
whisperings! My God, for the gift of silence in these precincts!
Oh, well, oh, very well, I come! Unfortunate babu is slave of
circumstances in all things!"</p>

<p>He came waddling up the stairs, and struck a match so suddenly
that Habibullah cursed him.</p>

<p>"Hillman's curse is Hindu's blessing!" said the babu piously.
"Now spill the beans! Unleash the dogs of war and let speech
coruscate! Give her gas!"</p>

<p>So Habibullah could not help himself. He was obliged to tell his
tale to both men, neither of whom believed him because he could not
show the thousand rupees that he boasted of having "lifted" from
the man in yellow on the roof. In fact the whole tale was too
fishy, coming on top, as it did, of that other yarn about fighting
a way out from the police cells.</p>

<p>"That I should leave a virgin bed on a trap-door for this!"
Chullunder Ghose sighed. "I lie, thou liest, he lies&mdash;what
unregenerated Prussian calls <i>die Lust zum Fabulieren</i> !
'Gas!' I said, and he delivers hot air! Oh, deliver me!"</p>

<p>"If you could prove a word of it&mdash;" Narayan Singh suggested
sleepily&mdash;"I might believe the next word; and if that one were
true I would credit a third, and so further. As it is, if you are
not back in your place on the gallery within&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Habibullah was desperate, and desperation has resources of
her own.</p>

<p>"What if I bring the three in yellow to the front gate? Will you
help me slay them?" he interrupted.</p>

<p>"I would <i>like</i> to slay them," said Narayan Singh. "Whoever
promenades the streets in yellow with the mark of Kali on his
forehead ought to be severed between skull and shoulders. Go back
to the gallery and keep watch! In the morning I will tell your
father Ali to discourage lying with a thick stick!"</p>

<p>"Lend me a lantern. I will prove it to you!" said
Habibullah.</p>

<p>Chullunder Ghose arranged his turban sleepily.</p>

<p>"Observe a symptom of <i>in vino veritas</i> ," he remarked,
"wine being possibly imagination in this instance. The savage
believes what he says, even supposing same is untrue."</p>

<p>Narayan Singh rose with a sigh and discovered a lantern he had
hidden where none else would find and adopt it. He lit it with
blasphemy, burning his fingers, ordered the babu back with his fat
hind-quarters on the trap-door, looked disgustedly at Habibullah,
shook himself to make sure the weights were there that told of
hidden weapons, and yawned.</p>

<p>"Forward! Up-stairs! Prove it! If you fail to prove it, over
with you!"</p>

<p>Habibullah led the way. With the lantern in the skirts of his
sheep-skin coat, lest the enemy catch sight of it before the stage
was ready, he stepped out on the gallery, with the Sikh peering
over his shoulder suspicious of tricks. Then he ordered his
brothers inside, they protesting volubly, making a show of
disinclination to desert the post. Narayan Singh was deeply
edified.</p>

<p>"Dogs on a dung-hill are as noisy and as timid!" he said
pleasantly. "Better kneel in there and pray for good sense&mdash;if
Allah is listening! Now, show thy proof!"</p>

<p>He shoved Habibullah outward to the railing and was close
behind, but Habibullah begged him to stay in the open door and
watch the light streaming from a window over a roof some way in
front of them; and still suspecting trickery the Sikh obliged. He
could not stand upright, but bent forward with a hand on either
post.</p>

<p>Then Habibullah, holding the lantern in his left hand, turned to
the right and made the circuit of the gallery three times, swinging
the lantern constantly to call attention to it. And when he had
made the third circuit, as it were of the walls of Jerico, the
light streaming from the window that Narayan Singh watched went out
suddenly&mdash;yet not so suddenly as when one switches off the
current. Someone invisible had held an obstacle between the window
and the minaret. He lowered it, and the light streamed forth
again.</p>

<p>"They have seen. Now they will conic to the gate to be slain!"
said Habibullah. "And if you, <i>sahib</i> , wish to have the
credit for it all, take my advice and climb down this way, not
waking father Ali!"</p>

<h2><a id="ch12" name="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a><br>
"I am dead, but the silver cord is not yet cut."</h2>

<p class="first">GRIM nudged King. King jerked at Jeremy's flowing
Arab headgear.</p>

<p>"Watch the minaret," Grim whispered.</p>

<p>The crescent moon had gone down. There was no light other than
the glorious effulgence of the stars. The minaret&mdash;a phallic
symbol posing as sublime&mdash;rose stately and quiet from a pool
of purple darkness. Nothing moved. Not even a dog barked, for a
wonder.</p>

<p>"Got the creeps?" asked Jeremy.</p>

<p>"Watch the minaret!"</p>

<p>A lantern appeared at the summit and disappeared&mdash;flashed
for an instant, as it might be from the skirts of a protecting
coat. Then, as whoever held it turned, its rays shone full on a man
unmistakable&mdash;too tall for the door&mdash;bent forward in it,
bearded and immense&mdash;Narayan Singh! The image was gone in an
instant, but left no doubt. The Sikh was alert and moving.</p>

<p>"Something's wrong," said Grim.</p>

<p>"Wrong with your nut!" said Jeremy.</p>

<p>The lantern flashed again, and this time did not disappear. In
someone's left hand&mdash;not Narayan Singh's, for they could see
the legs beyond it and they did not move as the Sikh's
would&mdash;it made the circuit of the gallery three
times&mdash;then vanished.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose that means?"</p>

<p>"Sons of Ali fell asleep and off their perch. Narayan Singh
looking for remains of 'em!" suggested Jeremy.</p>

<p>"It wasn't Narayan Singh who made the rounds," King answered.
"That light to our right front disappeared and came on again after
the signal."</p>

<p>"Signals, sure!" said Grim.</p>

<p>"Could the Sikh&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" Grim answered. "Narayan Singh is O.K."</p>

<p>"Trick-work nevertheless," said Jeremy. "There <i>were</i> three
of Ali's sons on that gallery. They looked like great horned owls
and we wondered before we all went to sleep what it was that
resembled horns. Remember? Where are the three now?"</p>

<p>"I vote we investigate," said Grim.</p>

<p>"Seconded!"</p>

<p>"Unanimous!"</p>

<p>They reached a dark passage by way of neighboring roofs and
dropped to street-level, nearly frightening to death the same
policeman who had been disturbed by Habibullah. The servant of the
public peace retreated at full speed and left them all that part of
Delhi for experiments&mdash;assassination&mdash;robbery&mdash;what
they willed. Since nationalism raised standard and voice the
streets have not been safe for a lone policeman.</p>

<p>"If they've rescued our prisoner&mdash;" Grim began.</p>

<p>"More likely garroted him to keep him from talking," said
King.</p>

<p>"Well, in either event&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We're flummoxed!"</p>

<p>King made no secret of his pessimism. He was all for action; all
for reprisals; but he felt sure there had been disaster.</p>

<p>"If they've got him, we've lost our inside track. We'll never
get another!" he said miserably.</p>

<p>There were no street sounds as they made their way cautiously
along the shadows. Now and then a dog yelped in the distance, but
as happens often when the moon has gone down all the neighborhood
seemed hushed. Just once they heard&mdash;or thought they heard a
cry and the <i>thump-thump-thump</i> of something falling. Then all
was still again.</p>

<p>Suddenly a voice rose&mdash;high-pitched, eager, exultant:</p>

<p>"My son! Oh, Allah! Oh, my son!"</p>

<p>Another voice, low-growling, cursed the first one into silence.
Then a door slammed. Voices again rose and fell in excited talk as
it might be behind a wall; they were muted; the resonance was
gone.</p>

<p>Grim, in the lead, began running. The others broke into a trot
behind him. Grim stopped and drew his pistol. King came abreast
feeling for his own weapon. Jeremy did the same on King's right.
They were fifty paces from a man sitting in deepest shadow on a
stone by the street-door of the minaret, who held his hand up,
saying nothing.</p>

<p>"Narayan Singh!" said Grim at half-breath.</p>

<p>"Hurt?" (That was Jeremy.)</p>

<p>The Sikh seemed to be bending over something. He was holding up
his hand for silence rather than to ward off an attack. He had
recognized friends. They heard him growling in the general
direction of the door, as if less talking behind him were what he
craved. He rose as they approached, standing astride one fallen
object, with another at his feet and a third behind him.</p>

<p>"It is good you came, <i>sahibs</i> . If you will drag these
corpses in I will climb the wall and break the necks of Ali's sons!
The sons of evil mothers shut the door on me, and are making more
noise than stallions in a horse-camp!"</p>

<p>King laid his head to the door in the wall and gave tongue in
the guttural speech of Sikunderam:</p>

<p>"Open, there, Ali! And silence!"</p>

<p>The door opened wide in a moment and Ali stood framed in the
gloom:</p>

<p>"King sahib! <i>Sahibs</i> ! Allah's blessing! Lo my boy! My
Habibullah! Pride of my old heart! He slew three yellow ones with
three blows of a <i>tulwar</i> ! Three in three blows! There they
lie! Lo! Look! The <i>tulwar</i> ! See the blood on it! See the
nick in the blade where it bit too deep and struck the wall beyond!
A smites! Ho! A true son of Sikunderam!"</p>

<p>"Peace! Silence!" ordered King, and turned again to help drag in
the corpses of three men in yellow smocks.</p>

<p>"He shall have a purse and fifty rupees in it!" Ali boasted.</p>

<p>But Narayan Singh cut that short, brushing by him, straight
forward to essentials, discovering Chullunder Ghose recumbent on
the trap-door, acting dead-weight.</p>

<p>"Back again, then?" said Narayan Singh&mdash;it might be
scornfully.</p>

<p>"<i>In statu quo</i> ," the babu answered, smirking. "Unless
dead, in which case disembodied spirit might emerge unobserved,
prisoner is in durance vile beneath me&mdash;among rats!"</p>

<p>"You weren't here five minutes ago," said the Sikh. "Get off.
Let the <i>sahibs</i> see."</p>

<p>"I was certainly successful rogue in former incarnation," said
the babu, rolling to his hands and knees and heading for the door.
"<i>Karma</i> * now reversing rôle, I get away with
nothing&mdash;absolutely!"</p>

<p>[* Karma. The law by which sins of a former life are inevitably
compensated for in this life or a future one, and good deeds in the
same way are rewarded.]</p>

<p>Narayan Singh raised the trap skeptically. Nevertheless, the
prisoner was there. He blinked up at Grim, King and Jeremy. Smocked
like himself in yellow they exactly fitted the only mental picture
he had. Priest of a dreadful creed, dread was his portion. Likely
he was only kept from suicide by the teaching that he who robs Kali
of the joy of killing in her own way is doomed to flicker in the
astral gloom for aeons, useless and hopeless, until finally he
ceases in darkness and never is.</p>

<p>"Others were less fortunate than thee. To them no opportunity to
make amends and ease the pangs of afterlife! Behold them!" King
said, speaking as if he himself were Karma, judging dead souls.</p>

<p>One by one&mdash;head in one hand, body in the
other&mdash;Narayan Singh dumped the corpses of three followers of
Kali down into the rat-infested dark; and Jeremy held the lantern
so that he who had not lost his life yet might see and
comprehend.</p>

<p>"Consider <i>them</i> ," King warned him. "<i>They</i> died not
by the handkerchief but by the sword, displeasing <i>Her</i> in
death as well as life!"</p>

<p>And outside, just beyond the rays of the candle set in the niche
of the outer wall, Chullunder Ghose held high dispute with Ali of
Sikunderam.</p>

<p>"Shame?" said the babu. "I am utterly disreputable. Therefore
appreciate value to others of what I lack. I assess shame of
Habibullah at rupees a hundred. Ante up, as Jimgrim has it! Make it
slippery and soon, as Jeremy <i>sahib</i> would say!"</p>

<p>"You have no honor!" Ali retorted hotly.</p>

<p>"None!" agreed the babu. "All dishonor me&mdash;including you!
Insult me with rupees a hundred, or I will tell who slew those
three! Habibullah will then resemble egg thoroughly sucked by
grandmother&mdash;all hollow! The money please."</p>

<p>"May the curse of the Prophet of Allah, whose name none taketh
in vain, wither and disintegrate thy bowels! May the worms that die
not eat thee! May food be to thee like ashes and thy drink as
bitter as a goat's gall! May thy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly!" said the babu. "Money please! Or else&mdash;"</p>

<p>So Ali of Sikunderam drew painfully from somewhere underneath
his shirt&mdash;like a man pulling out a long thorn or a well
barbed arrow- head&mdash;one bank-note for a hundred rupees, and
the babu pouched it.</p>

<p>"Then it is agreed," said Ali, "that Habibullah slew those three
with three strokes of his <i>tulwar</i> ?"</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Chullunder Ghose. "Do you wish receipt in writing
with stipulation black on white? Will sign same. No extra
charge!"</p>

<p>"See this!" said Ali, showing his own knife. "The bargain is
made. You have the money. Keep faith, or feel this!"</p>

<p>"My aunt!" said the babu, and shuddered. (But the shudder may
have been the camouflaging movement under which he slipped the
money into hiding.)</p>

<p>King, Grim and Jeremy emerged from within the minaret, listening
to Narayan Singh, who wiped his hands on a piece of sacking and
talked in low tones.</p>

<p>"Give Habibullah credit for it, <i>sahibs</i> . He was afraid of
them, but what odds? He and I climbed down by the broken masonry
and waited in the shadow of the wall. I would have used a pistol,
but feared the police, so when the three came near I said to
Habibullah 'Draw, and smite!' The fellow's hand was trembling so
that he nicked the edge of the <i>tulwar</i> against the wall! And
they came on, perhaps thinking we were waiting to welcome them. So
I took the <i>tulwar</i> from him and struck three times. Then I
gave the weapon back and said: 'Well smitten! Good sword,
Habibullah!' And Ali heard, listening through the key-hole. He
opened the door and called his bastard in, slamming it again on me.
So I waited, hoping no police would come to see the bodies and
start trouble."</p>

<p>Grim laughed silently. He had seen the Sikh's harvest before,
and could have told his sword-cuts from among a hecatomb.</p>

<p>"Habibullah's head will swell, though, if we let him boast of
what he didn't do," said King.</p>

<p>"Let it swell, <i>sahib</i> . It will fall the easier. These men
in yellow are no Sadhus* blessing their enemies. They hold revenge
more sweet than a hill-bear does wild honey. Let Habibullah boast
of it!"</p>

<p>[* Holy men]</p>

<p>"Let's go!" said Jeremy suddenly. "I'm betting all I've got,
those three were watched. For every one Narayan Singh killed
there'll be ten on our track before morning!"</p>

<p>The eyes of all four met in the light of the match that Jeremy
struck to light his cigarette. All four men nodded.</p>

<p>"Chullunder Ghose!"</p>

<p>The babu heard King's low call and came on the run, like a
hippopotamus in flight for water.</p>

<p>"Quick now! Think!" King ordered. "Problem is to evacuate. Take
away the prisoner&mdash;leave corpses here&mdash;all go somewhere
safe, unseen. Do you think we can make the office in the Chandni
Chowk?"</p>

<p>"Oh golly!" said the babu. You could feel him growing gray that
instant. "Best imaginable is sane ox-cart used for general
obsequies under direction of Ramsden <i>sahib</i> . Same is at
Gauri's&mdash;probably&mdash;oxen asleep in gutter and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go get it!" ordered Grim. "Narayan Singh, go with him! Send
Ramsden back, and wait at Gauri's, both of you!"</p>

<p>"For my emolument I take a manifold of risks!" Chullunder Ghose
said. "Oh, fickle Fortune, I am undone this time! <i>Eimai,
Ollola</i> , as Greeks would say! I vanish!"</p>

<p>And he did. His adiposity was no apparent handicap when sweet
life was at stake. He had the gift of making even Ali's sullen
brother open swiftly, and the door slammed shut behind babu and
Sikh before King and Grim could light their cigarettes from
Jeremy's. Thereafter he made no more noise than a parish clog
would, slinking down dark alleys.</p>

<p>Followed conference. At best they would be a noticeable cortège
marching in front and rear of an ox-cart drawn by such magnificent
beasts as Chullunder Ghose would bring presently, if luck
permitted. And at worst sonic one in yellow would tip off the
police to interfere, perhaps accusing them of running contraband.
Arrest, then, would be inevitable, and would mean the end of their
investigation of the Nine Unknown.</p>

<p>Evidently more than one of the spurious Nines was linked against
them, all guided by an unseen hand. There was no guessing whence
the next assault would come, although it was fair to presume it
would be surreptitious. Ali of Sikunderam, called into conference,
turned Job's comforter:</p>

<p>"<i>They say</i> these followers of Kali have noiseless weapons,
<i>sahibs</i> ! Tubes that deliver a poisoned dart with accuracy as
far as a revolver shoots! The poison is brewed from the venom of
cobras and the blood of vampires&mdash;very quick stuff. A man
struck by it falls conscious, yet stupefied, and in great pain sees
himself decompose until the stink from his own body suffocates him
in the end!"</p>

<p>"What do you advise?" King asked him.</p>

<p>"An exorcism! Let my brother hunt up a brewer of potions, and
all the darts of Kali will never hurt us! A man known to my brother
brewed me a potion before I returned to the Hills once on a time to
establish Habibullab's parentage. Behold me: I live! He who
disputed my claim was buried in more than one piece and in more
than one place! Ho! I scattered him among the villages as Allah
spreads the wind! I hewed him! I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good! Let your brother go," King interrupted.</p>

<p>There was virtue in the strange proposal. Ali's brother was a
surly, ill-conditioned brute, too long possessed of a sinecure to
be depended on. In a pinch he would be a positive handicap to
whichever side he was on, and to be rid of him by any tolerable
means was good use of opportunity. The brother himself provided all
the absolution necessary.</p>

<p>"I should be paid!" he objected. "They ask to have their lives
preserved. They could not find the magician without me. They should
pay me rupees fifty!"</p>

<p>He could have had more, if he had only known. Grim paid him
fifty and spoke him civilly, shoving him out through the gate. It
was Jeremy, watching him curiously over the top of the wall where a
broken stone provided a safe vantage point&mdash;just out of
curiosity, to see which way he went, as he explained it
afterward&mdash;who saw him shot down from behind by a dart that
made no noise.</p>

<p>A part, then, of Ali's croaking had been accurate! His brother
lay, if not dead, motionless. Jeremy, up at his niche in the wall,
reported someone in what might be a yellow smock creeping up along
the darkest shadows, searching the body, taking money and
everything else he could find. Whereat Ali, using Habibullah's back
for vaulting horse, leaped on the wall with the stone in his hands
that had once sat in Jeremy's niche and, standing for better
effect, hurled the stone down on the back of the head of the
robber&mdash;and was gone down like a deep-sea diver in its wake
before a voice could check hint. None knew&mdash;not even
he&mdash;whether he had lost his footing or just followed to make
sure.</p>

<p>They heard a skull crack under the impact of the stone, and
Ali's voice, calling before his feet touched earth for the door to
be opened for him. King opened and admitted someone else! A man in
a yellow robe, exactly like those they three were wearing, strode
in and stood with folded arms confronting them&mdash;producing the
effect of ice on hot imagination! Habibullah raised the candle. Its
light shone on beads of sweat on the cruellest face, as the
handsomest, that any of the three had ever seen.</p>

<p>Bronze, as the other men had been. Smiling like the
Sphinx&mdash;an incarnate enigma. Tall. Strong as a gorilla,
judging by the heft and set of splendid shoulders. Standing with
the air of absolute authority that only years of use of it can
give. In majesty, in intellect, and in impressiveness, as far above
those others who had hounded them as eagles are above the beasts
they watch.</p>

<p>He stood in silence, and in due time with one finger pointed at
the tell-tale cigarettes. Those contradicted the disguise of yellow
robes and caste-mark. Surprise, or whatever it was that had numbed
the minds of all three, now set King's wits moving again. He
wondered why Ali had not taken advantage of the open door, and
strode to shut it before any more of the enemy could enter. He with
the bronze face touched him on the arm. King kicked the door shut
with his foot, and as the spring-lock snapped he turned about to
face a weapon he knew well.</p>

<p>He had cut his eye-teeth in the Indian Secret Service, and
therefore knew the feel of hypnotism. He knew the only way to stand
against it&mdash;switched his thought instantly to another
object&mdash;anything&mdash;anything whatever, so be it served to
concentrate his will and was outside the thought of the
practitioner. Mathematics was King's formula. They vary. Each man
acts on experience, and some withstand while others fail. He worked
out in his head the cube of 77, and turned to swing for the jaw of
the hypnotist.</p>

<p>His brain felt free but the blow failed. It glanced off as if
guarded by a pugilist; and yet the newcomer had not moved. That was
descent into subjection&mdash;step one! The others would follow
swiftly. The man with the bronze face smiled at him, and King faced
about&mdash;turned his back on him&mdash;worked with an ice-cold
frenzy at the problem of the square of the
hypotenuse&mdash;eliminating all else, visualizing the
diagram&mdash;winning back to self-command and sanity.</p>

<p>The other two stood motionless. As they described it afterward,
they thought they had been struck by one of Ali's fabled darts,
making them inert while still aware of what was happening. They
felt no pain, but there was a strange sensation in the ears and
behind the eyes.</p>

<p>King was not more than half-in-command of himself. Habibullah
and the other two of Ali's sons were stricken with superstitious
awe. And on the door that King had kicked shut Ali of Sikunderam
was now thundering with a fist and the hilt of his knife; it
sounded like marriage tom-toms in the distance&mdash;somewhere away
at the other side of Delhi&mdash;yesterday&mdash;last
week&mdash;months ago&mdash;anywhere and any time but here and
now.</p>

<p>"So it's up to me, is it?" said King to himself.</p>

<p>He sized up his antagonist, and fancied matching strength with
him still less than he did the risk of attracting police to the
scene. Suddenly he drew his automatic. And as suddenly the man in
yellow moved a hand that touched the pistol. A shock like
electricity went up King's arm and he dropped the pistol because he
could not help it. The man in yellow, still smiling through his
bronze mask, kicked it away into the shadows.</p>

<p>"Any more weapons?" he asked&mdash;in English! His voice was as
magnificent as his stature&mdash;as surprising.</p>

<p>King knew he counted on the effect of it, for the hypnotist
works by rule of thumb and uses one trick after another until the
resisting victim yields. He hung on to his remaining self-command
like a man over-board clinging to an oar, and was conscious of the
sound of wheels advancing tip-street. He could hear bullocks' feet.
He knew what that meant.</p>

<p>Ali's hammering ceased, and just as suddenly began again.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" King demanded&mdash;a very unsafe question
to put to a skilful hypnotist, unless you happen to be just as
skilful in defense. It was tantamount to lowering his guard by way
of tempting an opponent. But he knew that all he had to do was gain
time now and keep the man's attention. A hypnotist engaged in
trying to master three strong men at once is as oblivious to other
sounds and circumstances as his victims will be when he has control
of them.</p>

<p>"You!" said the fellow with the bronze face. "Only you! These
are not strong enough!"</p>

<p>He pushed Grim and Jeremy&mdash;brushed them aside with his left
hand, and they fell to the ground as if he had pole-axed them. That
of itself had almost been enough to overcome the last of King's
resistance, only that King's face was toward the wall and the
bronze man had his back to it. King saw something, the other did
not even hear.</p>

<p>"You know so much, you shall be a Ninth, and later on perhaps a
captain of a Nine!" He continued to speak English.</p>

<p>The bronze smile never varied, but the dark eyes changed; they
were considering King's resistance, speculating as to the source of
its strength, calculating which next trick to play. Slowly, the way
a serpent moves advancing on a spell-bound bird, his right arm
began to approach King's eyes, and every faculty the man owned was
concentrated in one immense magnetic effort to induce a responding
state of mind in King. King knew that if the finger touched him he
would go down under it beaten&mdash;for the time at all events.</p>

<p>He stepped back&mdash;saw the wall&mdash;again saw something
else&mdash;another, less inhuman hand&mdash;stepped back again and
shouted to help break the spell:</p>

<p>"Rammy!"</p>

<p>Jeff boasts that eight of him would weigh a ton. If so, two
hundredweight and a half of solid bone and muscle landed from the
top of the wall feet-first on the shoulders of the
hypnotist&mdash;as unexpected and as efficacious as a mine exploded
in a crisis! The hypnotist was caught off-guard, and all his
deviltry was no more good.</p>

<p>Slow to think and cautious as he always is, Ramsden had lain on
the top of the wall to listen and look before jumping. He knew what
to do. He had the whole plan mapped out in his mind. But he knew,
too, that his only chance of executing it was to keep the bronze
enemy engaged. Give him a minute's respite and he would be as
dangerous as ever. The two had gone down on the stone flags hard
enough to knock the senses out of any ordinary men. But the enemy
recovered as swiftly as a snake recoiling for the strike, and Jeff
had to wade in fist-first whether he wanted to or not, taking the
fight to him, giving him no grace for concentration, forcing him on
the defensive, barking his orders at King like irregular explosions
from a motor-car's exhaust.</p>

<p>"Let Ali in! Out o' here! Leave this erne! Get Grim! Get Jeremy!
Quick! Quick! Cyprian's! I'll fix this&mdash;"</p>

<p>Fixing consisted of catch-as-catch-can, no hold barred, all the
fist-work thrown in there was time and room for. He of the bronze
face knew his hour was come unless he could break the arms and legs
of his heavy assailant. His occult powers were as contingent on
environment and suitable conditions as are steam and
electricity.</p>

<p>Jeff knew he could expect no quarter. Weight for weight they
were a match, and strength for strength&mdash;a man who had kept
fit by wrestling because he loved the last ounce of the grit and
guts he drew from the Great Quartermaster's store&mdash;and another
who had cultivated strength from a delight in mastery, and cruelty,
and the ability to go unchallenged. The magic of good nature, slow
to wrath, against black magic and relentlessness!</p>

<p>It was not easy to judge which way the odds were.</p>

<p>They tore, wrenched, struck and scrambled for holds like lions
in the mating season when the lioness looks on. Once the man in
yellow set his teeth into Jeff's collarbone and tried to tear it
out; but that only offered Jeff a steady target for his fist; it
was as good as a head in chancery; Jeff's fist went home into the
other's jaw with a blow that put all hypnotism out of the question
for the rest of that fight; it was like the thump of a pole-ax in
the slaughter yards.</p>

<p>Every hold that either got was broken by fist-work or some other
means that would be reckoned fouling in the ring. Again and again
each crashed the other's head down on the stone flags. They fought
beside the stones that had fallen from the summit of the minaret,
striving to break each other's bones against sharp corners. Once,
when the man in yellow drew a deep breath, Jeff got three fingers
in under his ribs and all but tore them out. That was the only time
when pain drew a cry from either of them. According to Ali, who was
hectoring his sons, dragging out the prisoner, helping King to
carry out Grim and Jeremy, and narrating his own adventure between
breaths, they looked like a tiger battling with a python as they
rolled, heaved, struck and snarled for breath under the torture of
each other's holds. King said they looked like an illustration out
of Dante's Hell.</p>

<p>They bled from collision with the masonry. They soon became so
slippery with blood that no hold held, and that was when Jeff's
advantage gradually told&mdash;(if gradually means much in a fight
that was as swift as the whirling typhoon is from start to finish.)
Ramsden had the other's arm bent backward around his head and was
twisting it with one hand while he kept a scissors-hold and pounded
the man's eyes with the other fist&mdash;when King at last got the
prisoner and Grim and Jeremy, with Ali's sons for guard, into the
covered ox-cart.</p>

<p>King came on the run then. He reached the spot as the bronze man
broke the scissors-hold and writhed heels-over-head to untwist the
tortured arm. And as King picked up a broken stone to brain the
enemy, Jeff rose&mdash;swept tip his weakening man by neck and
leg&mdash;lifted him&mdash;and with an effort born of twenty years'
clean living and good will hurled him head-first on to the flags.
His skull cracked like an egg.</p>

<p>"I <i>said</i> I'd fix him. Let him lie," said Jeff beginning to
feel himself for damages.</p>

<p>"No, bring him," King answered.</p>

<p>Without waiting for the reason Jeff gathered up the still
pulsating body and carried it outside to the already crowded
bullock-cart. There Ali was holding forth to his sons, talking to
them from the driver's seat through the embroidered curtains:</p>

<p>"Remember that, sons of forgetfulness! Bury my brother and bear
it in mind against the day of revenge. He died like a fool, but I
was wise. I felt the tingle of the magic and fell unresisting. Put
him in the wagon gently. Lo, they took the rupees Jimgrim gave him!
But I live! Hah! I lay considering how to attack that devil from
behind! When the tingling left my bones I used my knife-hilt on the
door, and if Rammy <i>sahib</i> had not come I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One man make room for this corpse! Let the prisoner make its
intimate acquaintance!" King interrupted.</p>

<p>So Ali's advice to his sons was cut short and one of the guards
had to get out and follow the cart, in which were now two corpses,
the prisoner, Ali and two sons, and Grim and Jeremy. Ramsden acted
as driver, sticking his toes under the bullocks' tails in the
fashion of Hindustan and steering with a tail in each hand, making
noises to the patient brutes pretty closely resembling the cry of
an angry parrot.</p>

<p>Ramsden could have passed for a hospital case without extra
make-up. His late antagonist had used the losing desperado's
recipe, disfiguring where he could not break, in the vain hope of
destroying the superior man's morale. With hair torn from his black
beard&mdash;raw seams where the Hindu's fingernails had
grouted&mdash;blood in his hair, and turban gone&mdash;torn
raiment, and great bruises showing through the rents&mdash;Ramsden
looked more like a wild man from the Hills than any sort of
civilized being. And that was no ill circumstance in itself, for it
tended to prevent interference.</p>

<p>The same solitary constable who had run when Grim, Jeremy and
King dropped down into the street like highwaymen, came close to
regain his own self-respect by bullying these night-farers. But
King walked in front in yellow garb, with that red caste-mark on
his forehead; one of the sons of Ali with a <i>tulwar</i> walked
behind, making the keen steel whistle and announcing that three
heads with three blows was his average score. Worst of all, Ramsden
sat perched above the shaft-tail, looking capable and willing to
pull any man to pieces&mdash;growling like a big bear.</p>

<p>So the constable remarked it was a hot night, and Habibullah
called him a liar, saying no heat was like that of Tophet, where
the enemies all went whom he beheaded three at a time with three
blows.</p>

<p>"Ho! I scatter their brains for the birds!" he shouted, until
even father Ali&mdash;richer than he had been&mdash;considered it
expedient to reprimand him.</p>

<p>"Have I wasted rupees fifty on an empty boaster?" he demanded
acidly through the rear embroidered curtains; and thenceforward
Habibullah marched sedately, thumbing the <i>tulwar</i> instead of
swinging it, reflecting on life's little ironies no doubt.</p>

<p>Inside the ox-cart Grim and Jeremy recovered presently, not
having once lost consciousness. The effect of the bronze man's
hypnotism had been like that of the drug curare, paralyzing the
nerve centers yet leaving them free to feel and to think as acutely
as ever. The hypnosis lasted several minutes after the man's
death.</p>

<p>"Proving," said Grim, "that we ourselves did it to us. All he
did was to know how to make us do it."</p>

<p>But that did not help Jeremy. He was disconsolate. Shame ate his
heart out that he, the deceiver of thousands, the ventriloquist,
the conjurer, should have fallen captive of another's bow and
spear.</p>

<p>"For it's as much a trick as palming 'em!" he grumbled. "I swear
it's a trick! By crickey, I'll learn it, and by God I'll hypnotize
the whole of India! You watch!"</p>

<p>Grim lit an oil lamp that hung in a bracket from the roof and,
more with the notion, of quieting Jeremy than anything, began to
introduce the prisoner to the corpse.</p>

<p>It was no use pretending any longer to the prisoner that they
were Indian members of a different Nine; he had heard them speaking
English.</p>

<p>But there was a chance that he knew no German, and an almost
equally good one that superstition had eaten all his judgment long
ago. Grim whispered a long while in German to Jeremy, who presently
raised the battered corpse and propped it in the corner, where the
feeble lamp-rays shone on the face and the open eyes. The jaw fell,
and Grim, watching the prisoner's face, settled back into his own
dark corner satisfied.</p>

<p>The corpse spoke!</p>

<p>"I am dead!" it announced in Punjabi through broken teeth that
had left their mark indelibly on Ramsden's fist.</p>

<p>The prisoner gasped. Ali and his sons grew gray with fear. Their
teeth chattered. Ali would have used the hilt of his long knife on
the corpse to beat it into silence but for Grim's restraining arm.
The atmosphere was perfect for any kind of illusion&mdash;stifling,
electric, full of panic.</p>

<p>"I am dead, but the silver cord is not yet cut," said the
corpse.</p>

<p>Even Grim felt a shiver pass through him. He reached up and
turned the light out lest the illusion fail, for the jaw had
dropped unseemly and betrayed no intention of closing again to
frame the words that Jeremy put into it. Nevertheless, they had
seen the blood and the broken teeth&mdash;enough to account for
faults of pronunciation.</p>

<p>"I see dimly&mdash;only dimly," said the corpse. "Who sits
against me?"</p>

<p>Two of the sons of Ali, deathly frightened, named their names.
The corpse went on with sharper accent:</p>

<p>"Who else? I smell&mdash;"</p>

<p>The word smell may have had significance unknown to Jeremy. It
made the prisoner toe the line. He sat up straight and
answered:</p>

<p>"I sit in front of you. Why speak Punjabi? Talk in our
tongue!"</p>

<p>"I? I? Who is I?" the corpse demanded angrily. "Nanak."</p>

<p>"Ah! I had looked for Nanak. I was seeking Nanak when the Karma
overtook me.* Nanak&mdash;listen!"</p>

<p>[* i.e. when he was killed by Ramsden.]</p>

<p>"Speak the secret tongue!" said Nanak, trembling in his last
effort to retain incredulity and self-control.</p>

<p>Grim struck a match and blew it out. The moment's flash lit up
the dead face, making it seem to move&mdash;an accident&mdash;one
of those accidents that do occur to men who strive persistently.
All that Grim had intended was to guard against Nanak's escape.</p>

<p>"Nay. For I will not speak twice; and these must understand,"
said the corpse. "Hear thou me, Nanak. These are they of an alien
race whom the gods have sent to unmask the Nine Unknown. Obey them,
Nanak. For. the Nine Unknown are known to the gods, who have
endured them long enough."</p>

<p>The prisoner had passed the point of incredulity and hesitated
on the verge of full belief.</p>

<p>"If thou speakest truth," he said, "tell me, why art thou dead,
and I living?"</p>

<p>A poser for the priests! But the answer was as prompt as the
solution of any trick staged by Jeremy.</p>

<p>"Karma* overtook me. The tale of thy years, Nanak, has a while
to run. Thy willingness to shield a friend at thy cost has obtained
thee a privilege. Obey these men, Nanak, that the gods may love and
recompense thee!"</p>

<p>[*It is an axiom that neither man nor any of the gods can
prevent the fulfillment of the law of Karma.]</p>

<p>The corpse ceased speaking. In the ensuing silence Nanak with a
crackling throat sought to induce it to say more, wheedling,
imploring, praying for answers to a score of doubts that tortured
his bewildered mind.</p>

<p>But if Jeremy knows one thing it is this: Never repeat a
miracle! If lightning never strikes the same tree twice, no
conjurer need hope to mystify again the same audience in the same
place with the selfsame trick.</p>

<p>Grim struck another match and lit the lamp. The corpse looked
more dead than even Ali's brother did, who lay face-downward with
the thin, round end of a brass dart just protruding from the base
of his shaved skull. The dead thing's head lolled sidewise and
rolled with each bump of the two-wheeled cart, amid a chorus of
quick, low-breathed exclamations of:</p>

<p>"Allah! Lord of Mercies! Nay, there is no God but Allah! Allah!
Allah!"</p>

<p>Then came Chullunder Ghose, near-naked and beside himself,
charging by King, not recognizing him, distracted, slippery with
sweat. King's fingers slipped off his arm and failed to bring him
to a halt. He ran straight at the big oxen, that will gore a white
man but permit the vegetarian Hindu almost any liberties. Setting a
foot on the how of the yoke between them he leaped along it and
collapsed in Ramsden's lap&mdash;a mound of hot flesh on a fellow
every inch of whose anatomy was sore.</p>

<p>"Oh terrible! Most awful happenings! Rammy sahib&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ramsden, saying nothing, bundled him over the rump of the near
ox to the street, where he lay for a minute calling on a pantheon
of gods and devils. It was luck that preserved the wheel from
passing over him. King turned back; Grim and Jeremy emerged;
Chullunder Ghose was hauled clear of hoofs and wheels. Ali of
Sikunderam suggested drastic remedies.</p>

<p>"A Hindu thinks fire is a god.* Burn him then with latches! Let
the god wring speech from him!"</p>

<p>[*Agni&mdash;the principle of fire.]</p>

<p>"Oh, terrible! Oh, awful happenings!" moaned the Babu.</p>

<p>They could not wait there in mid-street while Chullunder Ghose
rambled of uncertainties. Nor was there room for the babu in the
covered cart without removing guards or corpses. Corpses had it.
One corpse at least.</p>

<p>"Out with him! Into the shadow! In with the babu! That's
it&mdash;drive on, Rammy!"</p>

<p>Noises that only oxen understand emerged from Jeff's aching
throat, and with a tail in each hand again he sent the conveyance
forward, only to bring it to a halt a moment later.</p>

<p>Now another apparition raged up-street, as nearly naked as the
babu had been&mdash;bearded, this
one&mdash;swift&mdash;enormous&mdash;with a turban still in place
and shaking what looked like a club in his right hand.</p>

<p>"<i>Sahibs</i> !"</p>

<p>"Quick, Narayan Singh! What's happened?"</p>

<p>He could hardly speak for gasping. There was spittle on his
black beard&mdash;smoke, and its stinging red-rimmed traces in his
eyes&mdash;a cut across his knuckles where le had guarded a
blow&mdash;and a bloody, wet mess where a knife of some kind had
passed between arm and ribs.</p>

<p>"They got my pistol!"</p>

<p>"Who? How? When? Where?"</p>

<p>"They did! Now! From behind!"</p>

<p>"Where, man? Where?"</p>

<p>"Her house! Gauri's!"</p>

<p>"Where's Cyprian?"</p>

<p>"<i>Sahibs</i> ! <i>Sahibs</i> !" Narayan Singh was wilder-eyed
than ever. The thing in his hand was no club, but a broken section
of a bed-rail. He shook it like a clansman summoning the
border-watch.</p>

<p>"They have burned the house!"</p>

<p>"And Cyprian?"</p>

<p>"My sons! My sons!" yelled Ali of Sikunderam. "I left four of
them at Gauri's!"</p>

<p>He waited for no ceremony of permission&mdash;charged
down-street with the remaining sons, waving his Khyber knife,
beside Habibullah, bidding him make good his newly won fame as a
smiter of three in three blows. And in the nick of time Jeremy
pounced on the prisoner, who was seizing the obvious advantage;
they fought under the wheels, rolling over and over, hardly noticed
until Jeremy found breath to shout for help&mdash;a shout that
saved Chullunder Ghose.</p>

<p>For while the babu lay in something like hysterics, grateful for
the darkness in the covered cart, three men in yellow crept from
the rear and groped over the cart-tail, seizing Ali's brother's
corpse by both the feet and dragging it out in such light as there
was for inspection.</p>

<p>"Dead! Nay, he is not the boaster!" said a voice in Punjabi.</p>

<p>"Look!" said another. "They fight under the cart! Our
<i>guru</i> is alive!"</p>

<p>"Nay, we found the <i>guru's</i> body! Those are others!
Slay!"</p>

<p>It was then that Jeremy shouted&mdash;then that King, Grim and
Ramsden darted around the cart&mdash;then that one of the men in
yellow answered:</p>

<p>"Nay, I say I <i>saw</i> the boaster run!"</p>

<p>So whether they fled from Grim and Jeremy, or whether Jeff's
appearance was too terrifying, or whether they dared all in lust
for vengeance on the man who "slew three Kali-wallahs with three
smites," did not transpire. They fled, dodging the blows aimed left
and right at them&mdash;dodging even the terrific swipe of Narayan
Singh's broken bed-rail&mdash;leaving behind neither explanation
nor the corpse of the guru with the bronze face&mdash;although
where they had cached that was another mystery.</p>

<p>King tied the prisoner, Ramsden superintending. They roped him
into the cart by arm and legs, while Grim kept watch and Chullunder
Ghose gasped up his bad news, sentence about with the Sikh.</p>

<p>"They killed the Gauri with a cord!"</p>

<p>"<i>Sahibs</i> , they fired the house and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They seized me, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Sahibs</i> , I went for Cyprian, but they had him already.
The bed was empty, and I broke it for a club to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hell, you men!" said Ramsden. "Why not go to the house and
see."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch13" name="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a><br>
"I felt the tingle of the magic and fell unresisting."</h2>

<p class="first">THEY went. They saw. There was not a trace of
Cyprian&mdash;only the Gauri's house in flames and a belated
fire-engine in charge of a weary man who said:</p>

<p>"These women's houses are a bad risk&mdash;jealousy, you
know&mdash;carousal&mdash;anything may happen&mdash;lamp upset
arson maybe&mdash;you police&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the policeman had his hands full and, being a white officer,
in a land where they say the white man's bolt is shot, sought
excuses for not interfering too much.</p>

<p>"Native prejudices, don't you know."</p>

<p>There lay a man in mid-street, belly-downward, with a great
wound in his back such as ten lives could have sped through&mdash;a
northerner&mdash;Hillman by the look of him&mdash;perhaps
Sikunderam. Quarrelsome lot, those tribesmen. Probably he set the
fire and died for it.</p>

<p>But what should a wretched policeman do, with the certainty that
a Hindu lawyer would he hired by somebody to accuse him of stirring
racial passions? He ordered the corpse carried to the morgue, to
await identification.</p>

<p>Around a corner hardly a hundred yards away stood Ali of
Sikunderam, most bitterly reviling fate between the bouts of
explanation that he brandished, as it were, in the teeth of
friends:</p>

<p>"<i>Sahibs</i> , they slew him as a beast is slain&mdash;my
Habibullah! They ran from behind and hit him with a butcher's
cleaver! What can I do? How can I claim the body? The
police&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But how&mdash;listen, Ali! How did they come to pick
Habibullah?"</p>

<p>"<i>Sahibs</i> &mdash;have I not said? The house was burning and
no <i>ishteamer</i> * yet. And no police. One stood by the corner
and asked me as I ran, 'Who is the great one who can slay three men
with three blows?' Who am I that I should swallow pride? I
answered: 'Lo! My son, my Habibullah! He slew three with three
blows! Will you see him try the feat again?' said I. And with that
the fellow shouted, 'Him first!' pointing. Whereat about a dozen
men ran forth from a doorway, and one of them smote my son with the
cleaver!"</p>

<p>[*Ishteamer: fire-engine. Anything that goes by steam.]</p>

<p>"What did you do?" asked Narayan Singh, standing in the shadow
of the ox-cart for concealment's sake; for he looked like a man who
had come hot from fighting.</p>

<p>"What <i>could</i> I do? <i>Ishteamers</i> came&mdash;two of
them&mdash;and the police. May Allah blast the lives of the police!
I ran&mdash;I and my two sons. What else?"</p>

<p>"No sign of Father Cyprian?"</p>

<p>"None! Nor of my four sons!" answered Ali, running the fingers
of both hands through his gray-shot beard. "If my sons lie in the
ashes yonder, burned by Hindus, may Allah so do to me and more
likewise unless I burn half of Delhi to the ground! I will lay
India waste! I will raise a <i>lashkar</i> * in the Hills and raid
and rape this land until a Hindu won't dare show himself!
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>[*Army.]</p>

<p>"Hs-s-sh!" said King. "We can't wait here. What next?"</p>

<p>"What next is where to hide ox-cart!" sighed Chullunder Ghose.
"Characteristic of ox-carts being tractability! Requirements of
this party, self included, being absence from the flesh at present!
Even the police could trace us by the corpses&mdash;like a lot of
bottles! Debauch of bloodshed! Self am drunk with
blood&mdash;inebriated&mdash;very! I say office! That is advice of
blood-drunk babu! Go to office. Subsequently I lose ox-cart in
Chandni Chowk, being goat as usual!"</p>

<p>"But the prisoner?"</p>

<p>"I said 'subsequently,'" sighed Chullunder Ghose, oppressed in
spirit by the world's obtuseness and its too material demands. "To
the office with the prisoner; to hell with me. Your servant,
<i>sahibs</i> ! <i>Vae victis</i> ! Caught with stolen ox-cart,
trying to conceal same under garbage&mdash;no friends&mdash;no
attorney&mdash;ten years&mdash;<i>verb. sap.</i> &mdash;are we
going? Yes?"</p>

<p>They went, but Ali and one son backed off, promising to turn up
at the office by another route. Ramsden, with Jeremy to lend him
aid and countenance, sought an Eurasian apothecary, to whom Jeremy
told fabulously interesting tales of dark intrigue while Ramsden
was sluiced out, salved and bandaged&mdash;"à la queen's taste," as
the man of drugs described it. Thereafter Jeremy and Ramsden chose
a round-about route, using every trick in Jeremy's compendium for
throwing off pursuit&mdash;which brought them, subject to the
quirks of Destiny, beneath the window of a building, whence
policemen issued&mdash;five&mdash;that minute freed from extra
duty&mdash;arguing.</p>

<p>"It was a hundred-rupee note!" said one of them. "Nay,
fifty!"</p>

<p>"I saw!"</p>

<p>"I likewise!"</p>

<p>"I say it was fifty!"</p>

<p>"I saw you take it from his clothes. It was in a leather purse.
You threw the purse away. It was a hundred!"</p>

<p>"Fifty!"</p>

<p>"Show us then!"</p>

<p>They all stood in a group beneath a street light, and the man
who had emerged first drew a fifty-rupee note from his pants
pocket, carefully unfolded it, and held it in the pale rays.</p>

<p>"Good that we were all dismissed together, or it would have been
but ten by now!" said one of them, and they all laughed.</p>

<p>"Who can change it? Ten for each of us!"</p>

<p>They laughed again. Not one of them had change. Ramsden and
Jeremy were within five paces when the laugh was cut
short&mdash;turned into the blasphemy of spitting cats&mdash;and
like the blast that whoops along the valleys of his homeland Ali of
Sikunderam with one son swept into the middle of the group,
snatched the fifty-rupee note, spat in the face of the man who had
held it, and vanished!</p>

<p>"Hell!" exclaimed Ramsden. "Now we're it'!"</p>

<p>He was right, or he would have been, but for Jeremy. Failing the
right victim, pick the easiest and "shake him down!"</p>

<p>The five policemen turned on two who might have money, and who
looked easy to convict of almost anything.</p>

<p>"<i>Sahibs</i> !" said Jeremy; and the very title flattered
them. "This is the servant of the <i>Burra-wallah</i> High
Commissioner Dipty <i>sahib</i> . He and I recognized those
rascals!"</p>

<p>The police closed in around them.</p>

<p>"This bandaged bear? The Dipty-<i>sahib's</i> butler maybe? A
fine tale!"</p>

<p>"Aye! And an end to it, unless ye use discretion!"</p>

<p>Jeremy fell back on dignity of the assumed kind&mdash;something
that he lacks unless by way of mimicry. To a man those five police
were Moslems. Jeremy was robed in the hated garb of a Hindu sect
notorious as more fanatical than even the most bigoted
"True-believers." But the police of most of the cities of the world
have experienced the fruits of interference with entrenched
ecclesiastics. However lawless, they let them alone if they may,
occasionally envying, no doubt, the opportunities for "honest
increment" so hugely greater&mdash;so immensely safer than their
own.</p>

<p>This follower of Kali doubtless had his own way of exerting
influence. It <i>might</i> be true that the "Dipty-sahib" kept a
strong man in his pay for private reasons. If it were a lie, the
man in bandages seemed none the less to be befriended by a member
of a dangerous cult.</p>

<p>"Dogs!" snarled Jeremy. "Will ye snoot among the garbage, or be
laid on a true scent?"</p>

<p>He was giving them no option really. No policeman, not the most
cantankerous Mahommedan, would dare refuse a clew from a religious
personage. None might wear those orange-yellow robes except the
recognized initiates of a dreaded mystery. That much was notorious.
Surely no initiate would play a trick on the police.</p>

<p>"You know where we may find those robbers?" one asked with as
much deference in his voice and manner as he found compatible with
True- believing.</p>

<p>"I know," answered Jeremy. But he knew, no more than they, as he
recounted afterward, the sheer, stark impudence of the trick he was
going to play on them. He was simply "spieling," as he called
it&mdash;"talking to encourage the ideas to come;" and whenever
Jeremy does that the unexpected happens.</p>

<p>"Show us, <i>sahib</i> ."</p>

<p>Jeremy's whole facial expression changed. The idea had come to
him, smiling from the blue. He wore now the look of rapt intensity
with which he holds an audience, while his subtle fingers achieve
impossibilities of legerdemain. That look of itself alone would
have been sufficient, but for Ramsden; he had to explain away
Ramsden satisfactorily, or else to extricate him brazenly, and the
difficulty only added to the zest.</p>

<p>"You know <i>our</i> house?" he asked, selecting his words to
avoid a compromising wrong phrase. (He did not even know at that
time whether or not the followers of Kali had a temple, or even a
meeting-place in Delhi.)</p>

<p>"The temple of Kali? Surely," said one of the police.
"Well&mdash;go to that, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>They looked disappointed, and the air of deference waned
visibly, as Jeremy noticed; but they did not know he noticed
it.</p>

<p>"Nay, better; I go with you. Lead on. We will follow to attract
less notice."</p>

<p>The police agreed to go four in front, provided one of them
might follow behind for "discretionary purposes."</p>

<p>They were not capable of quite trusting a Hindu stranger in the
circumstances, any more than Jeremy was really sure they could
guide him to the enemy's headquarters. But the police know scores
of things of which they do not comprehend the significance. They
led Jeremy and Ramsden to the very door of a temple, on whose front
the image of the Dreadful Bride of Siva scowled through her regalia
of snakes and skulls.</p>

<p>It was a battered image. Moslem rule and riot each had taken
toll of it. The nose was missing. Not a snake or skull of all her
ornaments was whole. The dirt of a generation and the tireless
energy of time had joined their forces, so that Kali's face was
ground like that of the poor&mdash;into unrecognition; part of the
disguise, that, like the necklaces and snakes. None cared. None
visited that temple to ask unpleasant questions. Though the
purlieus of the door were clean enough to appease the municipal
inspectors, the gloom within was unattractive. He who lurked in a
yellow smock in the shadows beyond the threshold was no showman,
but a guardian of sacred privacy, whose very glance was a
rebuff.</p>

<p>"Do ye dare enter?" Jeremy asked of the about-to-be-confused
police.</p>

<p>They naturally did not dare. It dawned on them that they were
fooled, and helpless.</p>

<p>"You should look for your Hillmen in a coffee-shop, three
streets to your right and straight along for half a, mile," he told
them, smiling.</p>

<p>So they smiled back, dejectedly, as victims of a practical joke
who do not care to admit they are annoyed. They saw him thrust
Ramsden toward the inner temple gloom, and turned away with a grim
jest about Hindus and holy places that would have done credit to
the Prophet of Allah himself.</p>

<p>"Let's sit," suggested Jeremy.</p>

<p>Ramsden sat down, almost on the threshold, almost absolutely
invisible in the deep night that precedes dawn; and Jeremy beside
him, next the street.</p>

<p>"We'll give them time to lose sight of us, and then hoof it,"
said Jeremy. "Meanwhile, we know now where the yellow-jackets' nest
is. If a yellow-belly sees us he'll mistake me for a member of the
gang."</p>

<p>"Not so!" said a voice in the dark within a yard of him, in
English.</p>

<p>He looked into the eyes of death&mdash;of Kali!&mdash;of the
Goddess of Annihilation!&mdash;into the eyes of Siva's awful Bride!
Her arm reached out toward him from the darkness. Living snakes,
encircling her hair like tresses of Medusa, writhed as in torment.
Skulls that might have been of monkeys or of men&mdash;that was no
telling in that light&mdash;rattled like dry gourds on a rope about
her shoulders. There was a faint smell, not of a charnel-house, but
of herbs that suggested prophylaxis, and by inference the reason
for it&mdash;blood!</p>

<p>"Catch hold of me!" gasped Ramsden, reaching for Jeremy's hand.
But he was fixing his attention elsewhere.</p>

<p>The goddess was young, as with a youth eternal. Full lips,
cheeks, breasts&mdash;burning eyes aflow with something else than
greed&mdash;a plump arm, shapely as a serpent&mdash;grace of
movement&mdash;snakes&mdash;and dry skulls!</p>

<p>And the smell&mdash;the word "smell," Jeremy remembered, had
brought that yellow-robed prisoner to his senses&mdash;the
penetrating, subtle smell of herbs did more than offset things. It
banished them! They faded out.</p>

<p>Ramsden had lost consciousness, huge and heavy, with his
shoulders across Jeremy's thighs, until someone took him by both
feet and drew him into the temple. Jeremy felt himself going. The
gloom swam&mdash;full of Kali's glowing eyes&mdash;she seemed to
have scores of them that everlastingly reduced themselves to
two.</p>

<p>"I felt the tingle of the magic and fell unresisting."</p>

<p>He remembered Ali's boast. He let himself go&mdash;lay back in
the arms of someone whom he could not see&mdash;Kali's arms and her
snakes for aught he knew!&mdash;and let them drag him unresisting
head-first into the darkness that was cool and echoing and dry.</p>

<p>So he was conscious when they slammed a door on him. Nor would
he have been Jeremy if he had lain still, uninquisitive. He set to
work to grope about a great room, stumbling over Ramsden's inert
bulk, until his hand rested on a truckle-bed and his ears heard
breathing. He produced matches from the belt in which he kept
cigarettes and money under his smock&mdash;struck one&mdash;saw a
face he knew, and burned his fingers while he stared at it.</p>

<p>"By God! Pop Cyprian!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch14" name="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a><br>
"We've got your chief!"</h2>

<p class="first">"RAMMY, old top!"</p>

<p>Jeff Ramsden had moved, and Jeremy's voice in the womb of
blackness greeted his return to consciousness. But he had to repeat
the words several times before there was any answer; Jeff had
forgotten where he left off, and lay cautious like the centipede
"considering how to run."</p>

<p>"Listen, it's me, Jeremy. We're under Kali's temple, and Pop
Cyprian's here sleeping like a baby on a full meal. I've struck
matches&mdash;seven left&mdash;can't find lamp or candle. I'll
strike one more, and keep the last six for emergency. Wake up!"</p>

<p>It dawned on Jeff that Jeremy did not consider this was an
emergency. He laughed.</p>

<p>"Good enough!" said Jeremy. "Don't stare at the match. It's the
last, remember."</p>

<p>There are those who don't believe in miracles, but accept the
turning on of light as commonplace. Moreover, they may vote, and
some are known as educators.</p>

<p>This happened: where nothing was, and no light, suddenly a
vaulted crypt developed, glowing with the color of warm gold
wherever rays from a mean, imported Japanese match shone on a
projection. Agni, leaping from the womb of wood, had wrought
another wonder, that was all. (The age of miracles is done.)</p>

<p>Between two shadows of carved pillars lay Cyprian face-upward,
like a corpse laid out for burial, but breathing rhythmically,
smiling like a man who sees beyond the veil and is agreeably
surprised. He lay on army blankets on a bed that could be carried
easily, and was covered up to the armpits with a white sheet. The
shadows all around him leaped like things alive. Arches appeared
and vanished. Jeff tried to guess the height of the vaulted roof
above him.</p>

<p>"Blast!" remarked Jeremy. "That's the fifth time! My fingers are
cooked through."</p>

<p>Light vanished, but the momentary picture left its impression on
the retina. For seconds, though his eyes were shut, Jeff saw the
golden masonry, and Cyprian in an aura that the shadows were
closing in like floods to overwhelm.</p>

<p>"I've tried to wake him," said Jeremy. "I've pinched him. He
don't move. But his respiration, temperature and pulse all seem
about normal. Do you suppose he's hypnotized?"</p>

<p>"I know I've been poisoned," Jeff answered. "You'll have to
pardon my bad French."</p>

<p>He vomited enormously; but even so, with that necessity off his
mind, he could not remember what had happened.</p>

<p>"You were knocked over by a smell," said Jeremy. "It didn't get
me."</p>

<p>That was swank unshriven&mdash;Jeremy, not long ago a victim of
the hypnotist whom Ramsden slew, reasserting his equality.
Subsequently, from beneath, as memory always works, the salient
points of recent history emerged into Jeff's consciousness,
developed by the acid understanding that Jeremy had some need to
assert himself.</p>

<p>"Wasn't I in a fight?" asked Jeff.</p>

<p>"No, old top. The other Johnny was. You won. Listen: King, Grim
and the rest of 'em are prob'ly in our office in the Chandni Chowk,
waiting for us. We're under the floor, and maybe under the cellar
of Kali's temple. A lady runs the place whose hair needs
combing&mdash;no, not cooties&mdash;snakes! She wears men's skulls
for ornaments. Vamped 'em possibly. Our crowd hold one yellow-belly
prisoner, and what with Narayan Singh and you we've killed a
bag-full. Contrariwise, they've got us. My guess is we're safe
enough as long as our crowd is alive and alert. But if they should
burn half of Delhi in order to roast our folks alive, why
then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why then you would be <i>spoorlos</i> ,* wouldn't you!" said a
voice in the dark, that was a man's, but for all the money in the
world not Cyprian's.</p>

<p>[* Without a trace.]</p>

<p>Jeremy accepted that as an emergency and struck match one of the
remaining six. A breath blew it out before it finished sputtering.
He struck another, sheltering it between his hands. Eyes laughed at
him, but a breath blew the match out before he could see the face
that framed them. Nevertheless, he was nearly sure that breath and
eyes belonged to different individuals. He struck a third match and
Jeff prospected in his own way. Jeff's fist, launched not quite at
random in the dark, hit someone hard and sent whoever it might be
crashing backward against Cyprian's cot, upsetting man and cot
together&mdash;waking Cyprian.</p>

<p>"Mercy, where am I? Light! Turn on the light!" said the old
priest querulously. Memory failed him, too.</p>

<p>But a voice spoke like the resonances of a bronze bell, in a
tongue that neither Jeremy nor Ramsden knew, and
slowly&mdash;almost like aurora borealis&mdash;soft light beginning
dimly in a dozen places filled the crypt. It seemed to commence
among corners and slowly to collect itself into a whole, until at
last it framed nine individuals, the chief of whom in the center
out-frowned all the others as a mountain dwarfs the hills. He was
motionless, immense, a man who had attained the stark simplicity of
elemental knowledge and a kind of power that goes with it. Except
for one thing he could have passed for a Mahatma&mdash;one of those
pure embodiments of spirituality, who set the whole world first and
themselves last, thus conquering the world. In his eyes there
glared the cold fire of ambition. He was proud with the pride of
Lucifer, who fell. Pride is the first of all foes that the Mahatma
vanquishes, and so this individual's attainment, if prodigious,
none-the-less was not good.</p>

<p>Compared to the man whom Jeff fought in the yard of the minaret
he was as two to one. Even his physical strength seemed twice that
of the former. In poise, calm, majesty of brow, and magnetism he
more resembled one of those temple images that sit in the gloom and
stare through eyes of amethyst, than any ordinary being. He looked
aloof from human standards; yet&mdash;the hunger for human power
burned in him, and could be felt.</p>

<p>His coppery skin shone, well groomed, although hardly clothed at
all, and his muscles were like bronze castings. His smile was
thick-lipped, but as static as the rest of him, as if it had been
cast in place. On his forehead, under an orange-yellow turban, was
the crimson caste-mark of the cruel goddess whom he chose to serve,
but he wore no other ornament, nor any clothes except the yellow
cloth twisted scantly on his loins. His feet were bare, and he sat
with their soles turned upward in the attitude impossible, or at
best a torture, to the western races.</p>

<p>"<i>Bong!</i> "</p>

<p>The word, if it was one, sounded like a hammer on bell-metal,
producing overtones that hummed away into infinity. The eight who
were with him hurried like supers betrayed by a rising curtain to
straighten themselves into rigid attitudes on either hand&mdash;all
except one, the woman. Jeremy knew her again, although the snakes
and skulls were missing. Alone of all of them she sat
irregular&mdash;apart from the exact arc of a circle that the
others kept&mdash;like a picture of Herodias, lacking John
Baptist's head just yet a while. Lovely, if you love that kind of
thing. Rich, ripe, full-lipped, with eyes of a challenging candor
that had looked with curiosity and some amusement&mdash;but no
pity&mdash;into more and worse evil than the rest of the world
suspects there is. Sex-insolence robed in a leopard-skin.</p>

<p>She had jewels on most of her fingers, and on one toe what
looked like a wedding-ring set with diamonds; but her nostril had
not been pierced for the jeweled stud so much affected by Hindu
women, and her earrings were not the usual drooping things but
emeralds cut table-shape and set so that even the claws of the
setting were invisible.</p>

<p>The others were seven men in yellow smocks, not remarkably
different from those who had conducted the offensive hitherto, but
possibly a mite more sure of themselves and a shade less anxious,
consequently, to create impressions. Seven men so much alike in
motive and self-discipline that a kind of graceless unity had
settled on them, making of men of varying height and weight one
pattern molded by unanimous desire.</p>

<p>"Who are these people? Where am I?" Cyprian demanded, sitting
up.</p>

<p>Instead of answering, the bronze man in the midst pointed a
finger at Jeremy and spoke in English: "You and he, pick up that
bed and set it down between you!"</p>

<p>By "he" he meant Ramsden. By giving a command that would
probably not be disobeyed he intended to impose his will. The most
imperial control must have beginning, and the hypnotist does not
live&mdash;nor ever did&mdash;who can exert authority without by
some means gaining first the victim's own consent.</p>

<p>Jeremy was done with being hypnotized.</p>

<p>"You go to hell!" he answered civilly in English.</p>

<p>"Ditto!"</p>

<p>Ramsden reenforced him with a gruff voice and a gesture like a
gladiator's. He feared poison-gas much more than any mental
trickery.</p>

<p>"Come over here, Pop!" Jeremy said to Cyprian. "Try to
walk."</p>

<p>Cyprian made the attempt, getting his feet to the floor and then
thrusting himself up with both hands. He did not do badly. Jeff
caught him before he tripped and fell, and set him down like a
child between himself and Jeremy, where the old man, leaning
against Jeff's shoulder, shut his eyes after one hard look at the
nine who faced him. He was conscious, for his lips were moving. He
might have been memorizing a formula.</p>

<p>"Can you do this?" said Jeremy, smiling impudently into the face
of the enemy's spokesman.</p>

<p>He avoided the woman's eyes. She had a long silk handkerchief
that she plied between her fingers restlessly. He snatched it
without looking at her, and went through the motions of the
Thug-assassin, tossing the handkerchief at last into the lap of the
immense man in the midst. It was the essence of
disrespect&mdash;irreverence.</p>

<p>"Beat that if you can!"</p>

<p>The woman giggled. He who should have been respected spoke in an
unknown language.</p>

<p>"<i>Bong!</i> " or so it sounded, and about eight other
syllables. It was as startling as the gong that checks ten thousand
horsepower in mid- turn.</p>

<p>Four of the nine got up and passed behind the pillars to their
rear, returning in a minute with a wooden stretcher and a great
weight on it. The woman giggled again.</p>

<p>"Look!" said the man in the midst, again in English.</p>

<p>But Jeremy had looked. His cue was disobedience. It did not
interest him to con again the features of the man whom Jeff had
fought and killed&mdash;whom he had made to sit up and seem to
speak in the ox- cart.</p>

<p>"I get you!" he answered, laughing. "Who killed Cock-Robin? That
it? Want to bet? I'll bet the man who took his number down can do
the same to you! Come! Put your money up!"</p>

<p>Disobedience increasing into disrespect, was rising to Jeremy's
head like wine. His voice and the little curt laugh betrayed it.
Cyprian's old, lashless eyes opened a trifle&mdash;hardly wider
than walnuts at a winter's end&mdash;and his lips ceased moving.
When he spoke at last he had pulled himself together and there was
the strength in his voice that is the accumulation of half a
century's conceded deference. He spoke as one having authority:</p>

<p>"Peace in the presence of death!"</p>

<p>"I'm not joking, Pop," said Jeremy; but the fumes were no longer
rising. "Rammy can lick that blighter!"</p>

<p>"Peace!" commanded Cyprian.</p>

<p>He was still leaning against Ramsden's shoulder. Jeff's right
arm was around his waist as if it had been a girl's. Depending on
Jeff's grip the old man leaned forward&mdash;raised one
finger&mdash;pointed at the bronze face opposite&mdash;opened his
eyes wide at last. He seemed to be drawing deep on his reserves of
strength.</p>

<p>"Peace! Do you hear me!" He was speaking English just as Jeremy
had done. "As long as we are unaccounted for&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was the bronze man's turn to laugh. He and the woman rang a
carillon like bells in tune. The other seven smiled, as if the
abyss in which their thoughts dwelt swallowed any sound they might
have made.</p>

<p>"My brother!" said the bronze man simply, making a gesture
toward the bier. The two words explained the whole of his attitude,
although the word did not necessarily imply blood-relationship.</p>

<p>"Watch out you don't join him in Hell!" sneered Jeremy,
bridling, repeating his curt, dry laugh&mdash;the danger
signal.</p>

<p>So Cyprian reentered the lists, raising his head off Ramsden's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"You do not dare!" he said, pointing a lean forefinger. And
again he spoke English. "You have no occult power! You can harm no
men who are awake. You are a weak thing&mdash;a poor
thing&mdash;helpless&mdash;human flesh and blood! You are as
helpless in the face of honesty as that!"</p>

<p>He pointed at the corpse. Wise, wise old Cyprian! Nine out of
any ten religionists would have voiced some tenet of their creed,
and so have given the enemy an opening into which to thrust the
barbed darts of religious rivalry.</p>

<p>"You will never get my library," he went on. "Trustees have
orders what to do with it. And if you harm me, can you pick the
knowledge from my old dead brains?"</p>

<p>The woman laughed aloud. The man in bronze smiled triumphantly.
Jeff Ramsden's arm closed around Cyprian, and Jeremy leaned
forward, as if to interpose his own body between the old man and
the shock that was trembling on cruel lips to be launched. News of
the burning of his books was likelier than not to unhinge Cyprian.
It was a bomb reserved to batter his defenses. Jeff forestalled
it&mdash;drew the fuse.</p>

<p>"Your books are up in smoke," he said. "Rather than let them
carry even one away we&mdash;"</p>

<p>No need to finish the friendly lie. Cyprian understood that
friends had been forehanded with the torch.</p>

<p>"All?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Every last one," said Jeff.</p>

<p>"You <i>know</i> that?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Cyprian stiffened himself, almost as if ten years were taken off
his age.</p>

<p>"I am content. I have deserved it. It was pride that prevented
me from burning them long ago. You are certain they are all
gone?"</p>

<p>Then the old man bowed his head, and the enemy understood there
was no more chance in that direction. There is little you can do in
that way with a man who owns nothing and asks no more favors of the
world. But you may threaten. He tried that next: "At your age death
without water&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is easier than for you!" said Cyprian.</p>

<p>"At the mercy of ants&mdash;"</p>

<p>"God's creatures!" answered Cyprian. "I am old. I can face my
end."</p>

<p>Or you may tempt&mdash;perhaps.</p>

<p>"We know much. You know a little. Add yours to ours, and we can
track the Nine down."</p>

<p>Cyprian bent his head again, this time to hide a smile; but the
woman saw it. She made some kind of signal to the man. Cyprian was
elated. The double confession couched in ten words, that these,
too, were hunting the Nine and did not even know their whereabouts,
was like a breath of incense.</p>

<p>The man with the bronze smile read the woman's signal and
appeared to be digesting it. He said nothing for about a minute.
Then:</p>

<p>"We have a man who knows a member of the Nine by sight."</p>

<p>Jeff and Jeremy looked up, and down again, not daring to
complete the exchange of glances. Even so, it was enough. The nine
who watched all recognized the movement and interpreted it. The
woman held her hands palm- downward about midway from her bosom to
the floor and moved them outward in a motion that suggested
leveling the earth for new erections.</p>

<p>"Your friends hold him prisoner!"</p>

<p>"You deduce that?" Cyprian asked, looking up with a swift
bird-movement of the head.</p>

<p>Ignorant himself of whether it was trite or not, he was afraid
that Jeff or Jeremy might blurt out an admission. He knew better
than to give away one scrap of information. Tell the enemy nothing.
Concede nothing. Yield nothing. That was next to being his
religion. That was why he bought up books on occultism and the
secret sciences. It was part and parcel of him.</p>

<p>Jeff detected Cyprian's call for discretion sooner than Jeremy
did. His slower wit was working at full power, plugging as it were
against obscurity; whereas Jeremy, knowing himself the quicker, was
leaping from one possibility to another. Jeremy, if left to it,
would have tried to strike a bargain, leaving mother-wit to solve
it when the time for double-crossing came. Jeff would have used
force. What his mind was pondering, deliberately rather than
obtusely, was: Why had he not been searched? The comfortable
weights disposed beneath the ragged costume he was wearing were
enough proof of the fact. Did these men, knowing not a shot had
been fired in the long night's hurly-burly, simply deduce from that
a lack of firearms? Were they so careless?</p>

<p>Jeff doubted it. There was another reason. Figuring the
probabilities he guessed that only two or three had captured him
and Jeremy with the aid of gas, and had been glad enough to get
them under lock and key until the others came. But they would
hardly dare use gas again with their own unprotected persons in the
crypt. Not very swiftly, but as surely as he sets his feet when
walking, Jeff reviewed the argument, and then, as if the wound
beneath a bandage hurt him, shifted his position.</p>

<p>Jeremy was on another track. He wanted to know what they knew,
unlike Jeff, who did not care and only wanted to be out of it. A
jest died still-born on Jeremy's lips. It would have suited his
sense of fitness to make that dead man speak again, and Cyprian,
aware of indiscretion in the air, shook nervously.</p>

<p>But he with the bronze smile realized that nothing he had said
or done had brought the prisoners nearer to the right subjective
state in which he could impose his will on them. And he lost
patience. Time seemed to be an element in his immediate affairs,
and the woman kept making signals that impressed the others, if not
him. Suddenly he moved&mdash;about six inches&mdash;leaning forward
and thrusting his hands in front of him as if they were serpents'
heads.</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;three&mdash;may&mdash;not&mdash;live&mdash;longer&mdash;than
&mdash;you&mdash;can&mdash;endure&mdash;<i>Her</i> &mdash; agonies.
Unless&mdash;you&mdash;choose&mdash;to&mdash;be&mdash;of&mdash;use!"
he said.</p>

<p>Each word was separate&mdash;almost as if etched&mdash;spoken in
English with an accent learned at one or other of the universities.
And at the word "Her" his eyes met the woman's, as if she were the
expert in applied torment.</p>

<p>"The younger shall be hurt first. The older shall look on," he
said as if it were an afterthought.</p>

<p>"How be of use?" asked Jeremy.</p>

<p>"Like this!" said Jeff; and he was on his feet before the words
had shaped themselves.</p>

<p>He could be quick when thought's slow processes had ground out a
conclusion. Loosing bold of Cyprian he leaped at the woman and had
thrown her into Jeremy's lap before Cyprian's shoulders hit the
floor.</p>

<p>"Hang on to her!" he yelled.</p>

<p>And then, with every sinew aching from the former fight, he
launched himself straight at the man in the middle, landing on his
neck before a man could move to his assistance. One tenth of a
second then would have been plenty for the whole of Jeff's plan to
go up in smoke like Cyprian's library, but he was squandering no
tenths. With a hand on the back of the neck of his enemy he hurled
him forehead-forward to the stone floor&mdash;stunned him. And as
the seven sprang to assist their chief Jeff dragged him out from
under them, cuffing two into unconsciousness and knocking another
into the discard somewhere behind the pillars. Then at last he drew
his automatic pistol, and throwing his back against a pillar stood
at bay, with a foot on the bronze man's stomach and the pistol
muzzle threatening him.</p>

<p>"Are you heeled?" he called to Jeremy.</p>

<p>But Jeremy had his hands too full for any such issue as a gun.
He had the daughter of the Ohms to wrestle with. A trapped leopard
with the smell of the forest in her lungs would have been a toy
compared to her. No python ever wrapped and unwrapped coiling
energy so fast, nor struck so swiftly. She was strength and hate
and savagery all compressed into the heart of charged springs, and
a knife in each hand made her no whit easier to overcome. What was
worse, Jeff had only knocked out three of the seven. Four were on
their feet and fancy-free&mdash;it might be they were doubly
dangerous for lack of the control the man in their midst had
exercised before Jeff laid him out.</p>

<p>Jeremy with his knee in the woman's stomach twisted one wrist
until she dropped that knife with a scream of anger. But her right
wrist was stronger than his left, and her stomach muscles could
resist his knee. She slipped out from under him and kicked the
fallen knife. One of the seven pounced on it, and Jeff shot him
dead before he could raise his hand to drive the blade into
Jeremy.</p>

<p>But that was not Jeff's plan. Noise, that might bring help was
likelier to bring more enemies. Gas was what he feared. As long as
there were living followers of Kali in the crypt it was hardly
likely their friends would turn the gas on. He wished the giant
under his foot would show signs of life. If Jeremy should kill the
woman and he should shoot all the others there would probably be a
greater risk of gas than ever.</p>

<p>But Destiny was overturning. They were down inside the works.
Like a pair of interwoven springs released Jeremy and the woman
fought in spasms, she using teeth and he his fists at
last&mdash;for how else should a man release his biceps from
unyielding jaws? The underlings in, yellow lurked behind pillars
for their opportunity, as likely as not possessed of firearms and
afraid to use them yet lest Jeff should finish off their chief. The
woman, for a second mastering Jeremy, writhed close to a pillar.
Jeff decided he must shoot her&mdash;just as two men
moved&mdash;the man under his foot and Cyprian. Both moved at
once&mdash;spoke&mdash;used the same word&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cease!"</p>

<p>Then: "Don't shoot again. Put up your weapon," ordered
Cyprian.</p>

<p>He under Jeff's foot shouted something at the woman in a tongue
that not even Cyprian understood, and she, with a last dynamic dig
with her knife at Jeremy's right eye, laughed and relaxed, so that
Jeremy scattered his strength and she slipped away from him before
he could recover. She had the knife poised for throwing, with the
haft against the heel of her hand and her elbow well back, when
Jeff coughed and her eye looked down the barrel of his automatic.
Jeremy laughed and took the knife and thanked her for it, in return
for which she spat so nearly straight into his mouth that he could
neither eat nor drink for days without remembering it.</p>

<p>And all that while the light&mdash;the pale, cool, unexplained
light that had started in a dozen places and appeared to join
itself together into one&mdash;had continued steadily, casting no
shadow in their midst but leaving all the outer portions of the
crypt in darkness.</p>

<p>It began to grow dim; not at once, but gradually, as it once
came, resolving into separate mysteries, each withdrawing, and each
growing less. Jeremy went for the woman again, but she laughed,
escaping his clutches easily, mocking him and as the light waned
focussing her thought on Cyprian. It was as obvious as the
increasing dimness that when darkness came Cyprian was due for her
attentions.</p>

<p>So Jeff Ramsden, feeling that his plan was no good after
all&mdash;but game until the gods should hoist his
number&mdash;bent his knee rather than his shoulders and seized the
man beneath him by the wrist.</p>

<p>"Come close, you two! Quick!"</p>

<p>Cyprian and Jeremy obeyed him, in a twilight so dim now that the
pillars of the crypt resembled tree-trunks in a forest, and the
shadows moving in among them, ghosts.</p>

<p>"Tie this man, Jeremy!"</p>

<p>So Jeremy took the girdle from Cyprian's black soutane and
kneeling on the bronze man lashed his wrists behind him so that
nothing less than sharp steel might set them free again.</p>

<p>"Let me go. I'm going to turn you out of here," the man
protested.</p>

<p>"I know you are!" Jeff answered.</p>

<p>As he spoke, in front of him, somewhere among the deepening
pillar- shadows, an arm moved swiftly and a knife struck the pillar
behind him half an inch above his head. The woman's laugh rang
ghostly like a pixie's in the forest, but the broken blade fell on
Jeff's trussed prisoner and buried itself in the flesh of his arm.
He cursed, and the woman left off laughing. Jeff took aim at where
her laugh had seemed to have its origin, and fired. The
pistol-flash, like lightning in the night, showed nothing but the
pillars&mdash;and a gloom beyond&mdash;and no less than a dozen
faces over yellow smocks, all waiting in the outer dark for
<i>something</i> to begin.</p>

<p>"I've four shots left and no spares. Where's yours?" Jeff asked
Jeremy.</p>

<p>There was no answer, but the sound of a
struggle&mdash;strangling it might be&mdash;then of heavy breathing
through the nose&mdash;and&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Bong!</i> "</p>

<p>It was the same word in an unknown tongue that had produced
obedience before. But it was not the same man using it. It may be
that a man with all his wits about him and no other care to
subdivide attention might have detected mispronunciation: But there
was much to think of. Expectation held its breath. It was
pitch-dark now.</p>

<p>Jeremy, feeling for Jeff's hand, guided it to the prisoner's
mouth, not speaking. Jeff felt a gag made of a turban end, and
understood; his two immense hands closed on the victim's jaws, and
the gag was tightened into place and held there by a pistol-butt.
Nevertheless, the voice of the bronze man once more broke the
silence&mdash;speaking English with an accent learned at one or
other of the universities&mdash;each word separate.</p>

<p>"Good. You&mdash;have&mdash;won&mdash;this&mdash;bout.
It&mdash;is&mdash;conceded. Go&mdash;free.
Your&mdash;three&mdash;lives&mdash;in&mdash;exchange&mdash;for&mdash;mine.
My&mdash;men&mdash;will&mdash;show&mdash;you&mdash;to&mdash;the&mdash;
street&mdash;in&mdash;. Go&mdash;free."</p>

<p>Then Jeremy's voice&mdash;this time indubitably Jeremy's:</p>

<p>"All right, cocky! You come with us to the street as guarantee
of good faith! And I want to understand each word you say. Feel the
knife on your Adam's apple? It'll cut in halves the first word you
use in any other than the English language! Now&mdash;give your
orders!"</p>

<p>The voice changed to bell-metal.</p>

<p>"Lead them to the street and let them go. Let no harm touch
them."</p>

<p>Jeremy's voice again, high-pitched and disrespectful, taking no
man nor his makings seriously:</p>

<p>"We've ten shots and a knife to keep our end up with. We'll
croak you at the first hitch!"</p>

<p>Bell-metal again:</p>

<p>"Make haste! The day increases. Lead them to the street."</p>

<p>"In darkness!" ordered Jeremy. "No light to see to shoot us
by!"</p>

<p>"In darkness!" said the bell obediently.</p>

<p>There was movement somewhere&mdash;almost inaudible footfalls.
Then a voice at a little distance, speaking in Punjabi&mdash;</p>

<p>"This way&mdash;come!"</p>

<p>Jeremy gathered up Cyprian, who leaned back in the hollow of his
arm reserving all strength for emergency. Jeff, holding the gag
firmly with the pistol-butt, seized the prisoner's neck in fingers
like a vise and put such pressure on the jugular and carotid as
answered all objections in advance. Together, in an eight-legged
group like a spider treading warily, they started for the voice,
each touching each&mdash;Jeff's strength as taut and alert as
dynamite with fuse attached.</p>

<p>"All is well. Keep coming!" said the same voice.</p>

<p>"All 'ud better be well!" remarked Jeremy. "We've got your
chief. He gets it first remember!"</p>

<p>Whoever controlled that mysterious light obeyed the order to
keep it turned off. That made discovery impossible, but eased no
nerves. A dozen times the giant whom Jeff was dragging writhed in a
sudden effort to eject the gag, and many more than a dozen times
between the middle of the crypt and a door set somewhere in its
invisible circumference they drew in breath believing they were
attacked.</p>

<p>"This way, <i>sahibs</i> !" the voice kept calling, too
sugar-sweetly to be free from guile; and they kept following, too
fearful to refuse. Time and again they cannoned into pillars, as if
whoever led them was boxing the compass in a calculated effort to
confuse.</p>

<p>"The door in less than ten steps, or I shoot!" said Jeremy at
last.</p>

<p>The click of the slide of his automatic as he tested it
confirmed the threat. But they were at the door. He tripped over a
step that instant. And if Jeff had not needed his pistol-butt for
forcing home the gag there would have been an all-betraying
flash&mdash;and only India's gods know what next. Jeff used his
fist instead&mdash;letting go his prisoner, swinging with all his
weight behind a left-hand hay-maker, and hitting he never knew
what. It vanished along with what might have been a feminine scream
cut short. When he swung again there was nothing there.</p>

<p>"Come on!" said Jeremy, and:</p>

<p>"This way, <i>sahibs</i> !" said the voice.</p>

<p>They mounted invisible steps and came to a ramp sloping upward
between stone walls. It seemed to curve around the circumference of
three parts of a circle, and they took each step with shoulders
against the wall, prospecting carefully, with a foot in advance for
fear of traps. Once, when they had mounted for as many minutes as
was possible without giving vent to emotion, Jeremy stopped in the
lead and forced himself to breathe steadily a dozen times. Then,
obtaining self-command:</p>

<p>"Remember! No lights!" he called out in the bell-metal
voice.</p>

<p>"No lights! This way, <i>sahibs</i> !" came the answer.</p>

<p>Once or twice bats struck them in the face, but there was no
other opposition until a great door creaked on heavy hinges and a
darkness something less opaque announced that they were in the
temple. It was still impossible to see a hand outstretched a yard
before the eyes; but there was another quality to darkness, and the
echo changed. The door to the street was shut. They knew it must be
daylight, but there was nothing to prove it&mdash;not a crack that
the faintest ray shone through.</p>

<p>But there was noise. Something&mdash;a man by his
breathing&mdash;labored at a bolt, or it might be at a swinging bar
that held the outer door shut. He muttered at his work.</p>

<p>"Krishna!" was perfectly distinct&mdash;not a word you would
expect in Kali's temple, she having little in common with the god
compassionate.</p>

<p>There was the sound of hoofs&mdash;in itself no startling
circumstance, for they let the sacred bulls pass freely in and out
of many Hindu temples. But the squeak of unoiled wheels was added
to it; and if that meant anything it was that the dust of unclean
streets had defiled a sacred floor. Dust on a bull's feet is one
thing; on wheels another.</p>

<p>He who had led the way out of the crypt drew breath between his
teeth and called to his chief in the secret tongue for orders. Jeff
set his back against the heavy door to hold it open, Cyprian
whispered something neither heard, and Jeremy took chances at a
venture. He answered in Punjabi, in the bronze voice:</p>

<p>"I will see these to the street. Return, thou, and call the
others to attend to this when these have gone!"</p>

<p>That certainly was vague enough. But it covered as much of the
facts as anybody knew, and there was no need to explain why the
chief did not answer in the sacred tongue. How should he dare be
misunderstood by the men who held him as their hostage?</p>

<p>The guide seemed disciplined until his own will was an automatic
agent of obedience. He turned with a retching of bare feet on stone
and started back. Invisible, he sought the invisible door
unerringly, and Jeff&mdash;invisible as either, and as ignorant of
what might happen next as anyone on earth&mdash;played by ear, as a
musician might, for the peak of the man's jaw as he passed. He hit
it, which was a miracle. He sent him stunned down the dark ramp,
spinning on his heels and falling backward; and the heavy door shut
tight on him before the echo of the blow had ceased.</p>

<p>"My aunt!" said a voice in English. "Now is winter of a babu's
discontent! <i>O tempora! O mores!</i> "</p>

<p>The belaboring of fists on iron was resumed as if in panic.</p>

<p>"To the last man and the last rupee&mdash;and then the deluge!"
said the same voice.</p>

<p>The beating on the outer door redoubled&mdash;something like the
fluttering of a moth against a window-pane, but heavier.</p>

<p>"Chullunder Ghose!"</p>

<p>"O gods whom I have mocked, am I in hell? Who knows my
name?"</p>

<p>"Strike a match, Jeremy!"</p>

<p>The light, as the sound of its striking, was nearly swallowed in
the blackness of a domed roof. But a few rays showed two oxen yoked
to a two- wheeled covered cart, one standing and the other lying
down, while a fat man humped against the temple door shielded his
eyes with a forearm.</p>

<p>Jeff laughed, and Jeremy heaped swift conclusions into one mess
to be brushed away:</p>

<p>"Selling out to the enemy? Double-crossing us? Got captured?
What's the secret, babu-ji?"</p>

<p>"They greet me with an insult! Oh, my elements! A Frenchman
would have fallen on my neck! This Anglo-Saxon race is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;in a hurry!" Jeremy cut in. "Omit the
captions&mdash;spill beans!"</p>

<p>"<i>Are</i> spilt! <i>Any one</i> can pick up same! Was suitably
engaged in losing ox-cart&mdash;uncamouflaged and less amenable to
shrinkage than well fed elephant or long-distance cannon. Very
exercised in mind&mdash;<i>verb, sap</i> . Could neither sell nor
give away same for obvious motives. Hyena-headed <i>shroff</i> *
approached clandestinely refused to lend even small sum on such
security without proof of ownership. Same being <i>non est</i> in
legal verbiage, sought to leave oxen straying in public
thoroughfare. Brute beasts, having appetites, refused to be lost,
and followed lone acquaintance&mdash;me!&mdash;presumably on
off-chance. Most perplexing! Prayed. Not often efficacious, gods
who are neglected in between-times continuing stand-offish in
emergency as working rule. Nevertheless, bright notion burst
bomb-like on imagination. Bring outfit here! Deposit same in midst
of enemy, decamping forthwith. Off-shoulder burden of
responsibility in lap of adversary, handicapping same! No sooner
said than attempted&mdash;came here&mdash;door open&mdash;drove
in&mdash;caught by curiosity was urged by inner impulses to forage,
being poor babu with family in need of aliment. Shut temple-door
accordingly in fear of observation from without. Immediately all
was dark! Panic! Terror- stricken! Sought to open door again and
failed! O God, what shall we do?"</p>

<p>[* Money-lender.]</p>

<p>Jeff Ramsden felt his way to the temple-door and groped for the
fastenings.</p>

<p>"Where are our friends?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Presumably in office wondering what next! Oh, we are in the
wrong place for solaces of friendship! O my God, what next!"</p>

<p>Jeremy, groping, lifted Cyprian into the ox-cart and asked him
to stay in there. Ramsden discovered the trick of the
door-fastening and set his strength against a spring that held a
beam in place. It yielded inch by inch.</p>

<p>"Pull on the door!" he grunted.</p>

<p>Chullunder Ghose obeyed and in another second sat down hard on
the stone floor, blinded by inrushing light. The street outside was
bathed in the early sunshine, and a loiterer or two&mdash;the usual
beggars and the usual social nondescripts&mdash;turned to observe
what might he. The least commotion would have brought a crowd
wondering. Whatever was to be done must be commonplace&mdash;as
calm and apparently in keeping with ancient precedent as all the
other unnoticed extravagances of a land of paradox.</p>

<p>Jeff glanced behind him, screwing his eyes up to penetrate the
gloom.</p>

<p>"Chuck the prisoner in!"</p>

<p>"Leave him!" urged Jeremy.</p>

<p>Jeff strode into the dark, felt the prisoner with his toe,
gathered him up, and hove him like a sack of potatoes in through
the embroidered curtains.</p>

<p>"Chullunder Ghose! Get in and sit on him!"</p>

<p>The babu knew better than to disobey. Jeff in that mood is force
in motion, not to be turned aside or made to cease.</p>

<p>"Jeremy! Walk in front!"</p>

<p>Jeremy looked once at him, no more afraid of Jeff than of the
oxen, yet aware of something else. The idea that had caught Jeff
Ramsden in its orbit and was using him as steam can use the
locomotive, was irresistible. He grinned, saluted impudently,
turned on his heel, and led the way, the rents that the woman had
made in his yellow smock making him look more than ever like a
member of India's great uncountered and unquestioned
beggar-holymen.</p>

<p>Jeff, with a tail in each hand and his toes at work, tooled the
ox-cart carefully out through the temple-door, leaving it gaping
wide behind him, not once looking back, assuming to the best of his
ability the expression of bored insolence that sits so often on the
faces of men who deal with privilege. Even his voice as he cried to
the oxen (that refuse to go unless they hear agony) had the tired
note of second-hand sanctity. The ox-cart bumped over the cobbles.
The splendid, hungry brutes helped themselves at random from
frequent sacks of grain beneath the street-side awnings, and from
infrequent carts&mdash;objurgated, but indifferent from long use.
Jeremy reproved with time-worn proverbs someone who kicked the
off-side bullock in the mouth for too bold robbery. All was well;
or all seemed well, until from behind embroidered curtains at
Jeff's back Chullunder Ghose piped up again.</p>

<p>"Not knowing plans, not offering to pass on same. Respectfully
advise attention, nevertheless! In Chandni Chowk and environments
this ox-cart will be as invisible as elephants in Pall Mall! Ford
car might pass through unnoticed. Airplane would not cause comment.
We are antique anachronism, subject to inquisitive police and
mockery of youthful element. I urge judiciousness! Moreover, of two
religious personages in my charge, one peeps through the curtains
at the rear and the other chokes as if the gag were disagreeing
with him. On which one shall I sit?"</p>

<p>It was Father Cyprian who solved that riddle&mdash;he who eased
the gag in the prisoner's mouth in time to prevent asphyxiation,
and he who whispered to Jeff through the front curtains, annoying
Chullunder Ghose, who yearns to enjoy full confidence in
everything.</p>

<p>"I have seen a friend of mine&mdash;Bhima Ghandava by name. I
did not know he was in India. He must have just returned from his
travels. We shall be safe in his house."</p>

<p>"Who is he? Will he admit us?" Jeff objected. Jeff's mind was
bent on another course, and he yielded ungracefully.</p>

<p>"Yes, he will admit us. He will hide this cart. He is my
friend."</p>

<p>"Which way?"</p>

<p>Jeff drove his toe under the tail of the near ox, crying like a
sea-bird in the gale's lee, and they changed direction, leaving
Jeremy to walk the middle of a street alone until he turned of his
own accord and took the situation in. Thereafter he strove to
follow with dignity, as he had led with grace.</p>

<p>They wended time-hallowed streets, avoiding the great
thoroughfares and hunting quiet as the homing pigeon goes. There
might have been a compass under the naked crown of Cyprian's head.
And at last they reached a wide teak gate in a high wall at an
alley's end, where Cyprian, reaching from the ox-cart, pulled a
brass chain. Eyes scrutinized them through an iron grill.</p>

<p>"Can you entertain us? Have you a messenger?" asked Cyprian. And
a voice with a smile in it answered in English:</p>

<p>"Why certainly. Welcome! Come in!"</p>

<p>Then someone rattled iron bars, and the great gate swung inward
to admit them.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch15" name="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a><br>
"Abandon can't and cant all ye who enter here!"</h2>

<p class="first">"WE'RE no good!"</p>

<p>Athelstan King was spokesman, on a cushion on the office floor
with his shoulders wedged into the corner and Grim facing him, on
another cushion, backed against the desk. King was suffering from
ex-officialitis, a disease that gets men harder in proportion to
their length of service. His best work had been done without the
shadow of officialdom&mdash;over the border, where the longest
purse, the longest wit, and the longest knife are Law&mdash;but
that had not preserved him from official commendation afterward,
which is a poison more subtle than cocaine.</p>

<p>Grim, on the other hand, had never been praised by anyone except
his enemies, and by them only for ulterior purposes.</p>

<p>"I feel good," said Grim, yawning and keeping an eye on the
prisoner, who was blindfolded and tied behind the desk.</p>

<p>"Phah! <i>Melikani!</i> "* remarked Ali of Sikunderam, sitting
son-less and despondent with his back against the door. "Moreover,
shaven and unmarried! What do <i>you</i> know of life's
bitterness?"</p>

<p>[* American.]</p>

<p>"Nothing!" Grim agreed. "Life's sweet."</p>

<p>"I have lost my son&mdash;my best son!" Ali grumbled. "Allah is
Lord of Mercies, but my Habibullah was a jewel too good to
die."</p>

<p>They had heard that a dozen times at least between the night
that seemed a thousand years away and morning that was just
beginning to describe how villainously filthy was the office
window. They spared their comments.</p>

<p>"I dare not claim the body, but the <i>Wakf</i> ** will bury it,
which is <i>something</i> ."</p>

<p>[** Moslem charitable fund.]</p>

<p>Narayan Singh, his black beard resting on his chest, woke out of
a reverie and seemed to consider Ali for the best part of a
minute.</p>

<p>"Unless your remaining sons are more wakeful and alert than pigs
that perish, they will be even as Habibullah," he said
presently.</p>

<p>"Pigs?" Ali bridled at the word. Nerves were on edge that
morning. "My sons are posted all about us as the eyes of angels!
What do you mean by pigs?"</p>

<p>"I go to see how many of them sleep," the Sikh answered. "Let me
pass."</p>

<p>Ali moved away from the door ungraciously and as slowly as he
dared. If the Sikh had only weighed a little less&mdash;had only
lacked an inch or so of reach&mdash;had only a shade less courage
and a shorter list of dead men to his credit&mdash;there would have
been a fight that minute. As it was, there was only a delay while
Ali removed his mat, lest the Sikh's foot subject it to defilement.
Narayan Singh strode out, and Ali slammed the door behind him with
violence that made the clouded-glass pane rattle.</p>

<p>"We erred in demeaning our society, admitting persons without
<i>izzat</i> ,"* he announced to whom it might concern.</p>

<p>[* Honor. (There is no exact equivalent.)]</p>

<p>"<i>Chup!</i> " said King and Grim together&mdash;a very rude
word in the circumstances.</p>

<p>Neither of them cared who knew that Narayan Singh might have
their blood and bank accounts to back him for the asking.</p>

<p>"There's dust in my lungs!" announced King. "This office
building is a fire-trap. If the enemy marked us down they'll burn
the whole block. We'll have drawn ill fate on to the heads of a
hundred people&mdash;or more. Suppose we move on."</p>

<p>"Where to?" Grim objected. "How will Rammy and Jeremy find us?
This was the rendezvous."</p>

<p>"Was! If they were alive they'd be here."</p>

<p>"Life's longer than that," Grim objected. "Then there's
Chullunder Ghose&mdash;"</p>

<p>King interrupted, smiling with a tired, wry face&mdash;not
cynical, but sorry, because of the probabilities:</p>

<p>"They've caught him with the ox-cart. There must be a million
ways to get into trouble with that contraption. We shouldn't have
sent him."</p>

<p>"But we did," Grim answered. "Here's our place until someone
shows up."</p>

<p>King knew that. Left to himself he would never have suggested
any other course. Had he doubted Grim he would never have voiced
his own doubts. But there is comfort in the privilege of pouring
forth unwisdom to be contradicted. He had been that kind of
rebuttal-witness for many a good man in the toils of
discouragement. It was his turn.</p>

<p>"Oh, go to hell!" he answered wearily.</p>

<p>For an hour after that they sat in silence, listening to the
brassy ticking of the export-clock&mdash;the quarreling of birds
along the roof- edge&mdash;all the noises that an Indian population
makes in getting ready for the day&mdash;unpleasant noises for the
most part from the western view. Alternately they slept by fits and
starts, but there was always one of them awake, and all three
instantly caught the rhythm of Narayan Singh's returning feet. Ali
opened the door for him unbidden, forgetful already of the dawn's
resentment.</p>

<p>"And the boys&mdash;my sons&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Are awake <i>now!</i> " the Sikh assured him, and faced the
others to announce his news.</p>

<p>"There are tales in the street of an ox-cart, driven by a god
some say&mdash;some name the god&mdash;wandering all night about
the city. The <i>bunnias</i> laugh, but the crowd is saying it
portends events. Men say the oxen were as big as elephants, and the
cart like the Car of Jaggernathi! They say it means India will rise
and free herself!"</p>

<p>"Has the hour come for the North then?" wondered Ali, plucking
at his knife.</p>

<p>"If six men of the North stay awake, I think none in yellow can
pass them. But if the enemy should come in pink or
green&mdash;above all green&mdash;" Narayan Singh went on.</p>

<p>"My sons are not fools!" Ali countered hotly, getting to his
feet.</p>

<p>But Narayan Singh took little notice of him.</p>

<p>"If a man in green came, asking for the whereabouts of friends
of Father Cyprian, I think our six would let him through
unchallenged&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You lie! By Allah, in your beard, you lie!" said Ali with his
left hand on his long knife, thrusting the hilt outward.</p>

<p>"I <i>think</i> the man in green is past the inner-guard
already," said Narayan Singh, with his ear cocked for the outer
passage but his eye on Ali's weapon.</p>

<p>"A man with green silk lining to his long cloak, and on his
forehead a caste-mark such as I never saw&mdash;two triangles, one
on the other. A man with a woman's smile&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My sons would gut him!" Ali swore.</p>

<p>But Narayan Singh opened the door. A man who answered well
enough to the description walked in with the considerate deference
of one who needs defer to nobody. The smile was a woman's as the
Sikh had said, and the face a preserver of secrets, although
sunnily handsome. Nothing that that man wanted to conceal would
ever become news. He told nothing&mdash;gave away nothing, except
that he was something of a dandy and comparatively well-to-do. The
caste-mark on his brow&mdash;two yellow triangles one on the
other&mdash;told nothing; one could not even guess whether he was
Hindu or Mohammedan; his eyes were like a Parsi's, and his costume
was a compromise&mdash;European shoes for instance, and imported
socks showing under the green-lined old-gold cloak.</p>

<p>"Friends of Father Cyprian?" he asked, glancing from face to
face.</p>

<p>There was no challenge in his glance, and no fear. He did not
see a prisoner in yellow peeping at him from around the desk, but
Ali did.</p>

<p>King got off the floor and advanced toward him.</p>

<p>"We're anxious for news of Cyprian," he said.</p>

<p>"I was told to bring three <i>sahibs</i> &mdash;Grim, King and
Narayan Singh."</p>

<p>"By whom? To bring us where?" King asked.</p>

<p>"By Father Cyprian. As to where&mdash;that is&mdash;"</p>

<p>He hesitated, giving King full opportunity to frame whatever
speech he had in mind. And King flung irresolution to the
winds:</p>

<p>"Fact is, we're afraid to be seen on the streets," he confessed.
"There were incidents last night. Arrest would be inconvenient.
We&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have a closed car," the newcomer announced.</p>

<p>But that eased no anxieties. A closed car outside an office in
that narrow street would only arouse curiosity. The first
inquisitive policeman would learn the car's number after which to
trace its course through Delhi would not call for much
ingenuity.</p>

<p>But the anonymous messenger told where he had left the car,
which of itself was proof that he could only come from friends.
Then within the minute, leaving Ali to guard their prisoner and
gather the somnolent sons beneath his wings, King, Grim and Narayan
Singh were in full flight by the private route, through the
warehouse where men dealt in wholesale drugs and outlawed
politics&mdash;out by a back-door to another street&mdash;across
that to a sub-cellar gambling-den, whose lawless owner could not
afford to tell tales&mdash;out by a window into a yard&mdash;across
the yard into a shed where a Jew swapped camels and was
hand-in-glove with all illicit traffickers&mdash;through his
side-door into a blacksmith's shop, and out of that into a street
where a big closed Daimler with crimson curtains waited. It looked
like a Maharajah's car, but lacked the royal insignia, and there
was no small platform up behind for footmen.</p>

<p>"If your honors please&mdash;"</p>

<p>The suave guide, holding his cloak to show as little of the
green lining as might he, bowed them in, followed, and slammed the
door&mdash;which was signal and direction; for without a word said,
a driver who looked like a Gourkha but wore spectacles, started
away at the highest speed conceivable in those thronged, narrow
streets.</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes, by the grace of those who guide the comets
in their wild ellipse, having hit nothing, killed nobody, he blew
his horn in the throat of a <i>cul-de-sac</i> ; and by the time
they reached the end of it a great gate opened, admitting them
without reducing speed.</p>

<p>They could hear the great gate slam, and the clang of iron bars
that fell in place, but could only see ahead because of the crimson
curtains. And ahead was nothing but the whitewashed stall the car
belonged in, wide open to receive it. They came to a standstill
with the front wheels on its threshold.</p>

<p>But their guide opened the near-side door and they stepped out
into a garden of half an acre in which a fountain played. A house,
that certainly had been a temple not so long ago, stood face to the
fountain, and there were flowers everywhere&mdash;in hanging
baskets&mdash;in niches where perhaps the images of gods had
been&mdash;on steps and balconies, in windows on a score of ledges,
on the roofs raised one above the other&mdash;and in masses to
right and left of the driveway and the walk that curved between the
fountain and the house.</p>

<p>They were thirty yards away from a pillared portico that shaded
the house-entrance. Rioting colors, the splash of water and the
sunlight on ancient masonry, the quiet, the coo of cloves, and that
peace that comes from absolute proportion of design, united to make
them feel in another world, or else on another plane in this one.
The assurance of their guide completed the effect. Unquestionably
he was confident of introducing them to wonders.</p>

<p>"Please feel at home," he said, smiling. "There should be a sign
over this doorway adapted from the famous warning above the gate of
Dante's Hell&mdash;Abandon CAN'T and CANT all ye who enter here!
Another mystery? Ha-ha! You will understand it after
breakfast."</p>

<p>Breakfast! They could smell new-roasted coffee and hot rolls!
They were willing to abandon almost anything that instant. Only
manners checked a stampede!</p>

<p>"I would burn a city for half such impulse!" swore Narayan
Singh. "My belly yearns like a woman for her lover!"</p>

<p>But a man came forward in the portico to greet them, who might
have checked a royal progress. Not that there was evidence of
majesty about him, or of potential violence. There was nothing
whatever forbidding in his whole surroundings. He might have been
the spirit of the place, but his smile was compact of all the manly
elements, and hate omitted.</p>

<p>He was middle-sized, more than middle-aged and yet so hale and
well preserved that his age was difficult to guess, nor was his
nationality determinable, although like his messenger he wore
distinctly oriental clothes&mdash;a costume of compromises for the
sake of comfort&mdash;Hindu on the whole. But he wore no
caste-mark. There were no twin triangles on his brow beneath the
plain white turban.</p>

<p>His beard, and, as presently appeared, his hair, were iron-gray,
not long but affluent and carefully groomed. Hands, face, forehead
were netted with tiny wrinkles that seemed to have been smoothed
out rather than caused by time; the impression was that he was
growing young again, after having faced the worst the world could
do to him. Great hunters, great explorers, great law-givers, great
sailors have such lines as his. He knew. He had looked in the jaws
of infinitely worse than death and had not flinched. Fear for
himself had no hold on him. Therefore he was lord of all he
surveyed, and not proud, because pride is foolish, whereas he had
humor. The humor shone forth from his eyes. Ease made her home with
him.</p>

<p>"Please feel welcome," he said in English. "I am Bhima Ghandava,
and this is my house. Your friends are up-stairs. Your wonderful
ox-cart is in my stable, the oxen have been fed, and so have your
friends and their prisoner. As soon as you have washed you will
find breakfast waiting. After that I am sure you would rather talk
than sleep, although the sleep would do you more good, so please
come to the library."</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but accept his invitation and follow his
green-lined <i>chela</i> * into a place where marble, cool water,
soap, towels, and the bathroom smell made life for the moment no
longer a dream but an exquisite luxury.</p>

<p>[* Disciple.]</p>

<p>The white man <i>thinks</i> the bath is a religion peculiar to
himself. The English made a privileged Order of it centuries ago,
and it is the only creed that the whole West can agree on. But it
also is the one lone recognizable common denominator by which West
and East may understand each other in the end&mdash;the outward and
visible product of an inborn yearning to be clean. There was no
difference between Grim's and King's devotion to the ritual and
Narayan Singh's, except perhaps the Sikh enjoyed his most.</p>

<p>Then rolls and coffee on white table-linen in a chamber in which
priests had kept the Mysteries before men forgot what such things
are and what simplicity must go with them.</p>

<p>An atmosphere outlives the men who made it. It is easy to feel
lawless in a smugglers' den&mdash;brave and determined 'tween-decks
in a ship just home from drifting in the polar ice. It was easy to
feel then and there that the hatch was off the hold of the
impossible and all things waited for accomplishment by them who
dared, and knew. There was a sense of being in the very womb of
faultless Destiny.</p>

<p>"I would trade my whole accomplishment and all my medals, just
to know I was worthy to sit here!" said Narayan Singh
piously&mdash;then set his teeth into a buttered roll and washed a
titanic mouthful down with coffee that smelt of paradise.</p>

<p>There were no attendants. The messenger in green-lined finery
whom their host had called his <i>chela</i> vanished when he had
shown them where to go. None intruded on their privacy until the
food was all devoured, and even then it was an old acquaintance who
burst in on them, weary-eyed and as contented as a bear among the
honey-pots.</p>

<p>"<i>Sahibs</i> ! Exquisite adventure! Luck at last! Gods whom we
have long offended have forgiven us! We are in house of holy adept,
whose tobacco is as perfect as his point of view! I swear, thou
swearest, he swears! I drink, thou drinkest, he drinks! Rammy
<i>sahib</i> consumed one quart of imported stout at seven A. M.
Jeremy <i>sahib</i> had whisky-soda. Me, I have drunk cognac,
contrary to caste and precedent. Am intoxicated with exuberance!
Ghandava <i>sahib</i> drank gin&mdash;I am sure&mdash;I saw him! He
does all things same as everybody. <i>Sahibs</i> , secret is, he
doesn't <i>give</i> a damn! He knows too much! He is incorporated
essence of accumulated ancient knowledge! Ask him anything&mdash;I
bet he knows it! He put oil on Rammy <i>sahib's</i> injuries that
has made him feel like pigs in clover. You, you
incredulate&mdash;but me, I know a good thing when I see same. I
want somebody to bet with!"</p>

<p>Chullunder Ghose sat down cross-legged where a shaft of golden
sunshine quivered between the slats of a shutter, and fanned
himself with a handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Am commanded to escort you three <i>sahibs</i> to <i>sanctum
sanctorum</i> soon as gorges rise at thought of further rations.
Personally I ate nine rolls and drank a gallon. Emulate me. There
is lots more!"</p>

<p>They followed him up stone stairs worn by the tread of ancient
feet&mdash;stairs set in the heart of the masonry by builders who
had no need to economize in labor or material, and passed between
what once had been the priests' rooms, walking on rugs whose origin
was Asia from Mongolia to Damascus. At the end of one long passage
was a door at least a foot thick carved with the stories of the
gods; Chullunder Ghose thumped that with both fists. It opened at
once, as if by a hidden mechanism.</p>

<p>They found themselves in what was probably the largest room in
the building. It opened by means of high windows on a deep veranda
banked with flowers, and its ceiling was vaulted in four sections,
with one pillar in the midst to support the inner ends of all four
arches. Somewhere were hidden ventilators through which fans drove
cool air; the purr of the fans was dimly audible and, just as with
Ghandava's costume, there was enough modernity about the place to
provide comfort without sacrificing any aspect worth
preserving.</p>

<p>The deep, long window-seats, for instance, were upholstered in
brocaded cloth, and the stone floor was spread with several layers
of rugs. There were books wherever shelves could be fitted between
projecting portions of the masonry; and an enormous toucan, neither
caged nor chained, sat perched on a bracket projecting from one
wall, looking futuristic.</p>

<p>Bhima Ghandava himself rose out of an overstuffed leather
armchair to greet them. Ramsden was sprawling in another one.
Jeremy sat cross-legged on a divan in a corner near the big bird,
whose phonetics he was trying at intervals to imitate. The
prisoner, unbound, sat like a big bronze idol on the floor with his
back to the window; and Chullunder Ghose resumed the perch he had
left at one end of a window-seat. Cyprian was not in sight, but
there was a sound of book-leaves quickly turning that suggested
him.</p>

<p>"Please be at home," smiled Ghandava.</p>

<p>They collapsed into deep armchairs, but Narayan Singh gave up
the effort to feel comfortable in his and after a minute squatted
on the floor instead, with his back against it. Bhima Ghandava
resumed the window-seat <i>vis-a-vis</i> to Chullunder Ghose, and
then&mdash;as if he might have been watching through a peep-hole
for the proper moment&mdash;the green-lined <i>chela</i> entered,
addressed him as "most reverend <i>guru</i> ,"* asked whether he
needed anything, and was dismissed.</p>

<p>[* Teacher.]</p>

<p>It was conceivable&mdash;although not certain by a thousand
chances&mdash;that that little incident had been designed on
purpose to suggest the proper attitude of deep respect. Perhaps the
<i>chela</i> had himself conceived it to that end. Ghandava was not
in need of the sort of mechanism that surrounds mere royalty. He
provided his own atmosphere.</p>

<p>"I am trying to make this prisoner feel at home, too," he said
with an air of comical regret, "but he seems to yearn for brimstone
and red-hot coals! This is too tame!"</p>

<p>The bronze man sat immobile. Not a feature moved. His wrists
were unbound but he had crossed his arms over his breast and held
them so as if hypnotized. The proud smile on his thick lips seemed
to have been frozen there. He hardly seemed to breathe. He did not
blink. When King, Grim and Narayan Singh entered he did not so much
as glance at them. He was like a dead man at a feast.</p>

<p>"He imprisons himself!" said Ghandava. "You see before you the
embodiment of fear and not the slightest need for it. No
combination of physical terrors could reduce him to that condition.
He is self-hypnotized. He is afraid with a fear that is within
himself&mdash;that he has cultivated in himself&mdash;that he has
used to govern others. Dynamite could hardly loosen it. What shall
we do with him?"</p>

<p>That was hard to answer.</p>

<p>"He's the head of their gang, and he's dangerous," said
Jeff.</p>

<p>"To whom?" Ghandava asked. "He seems safe to us at present!"</p>

<p>Whereat Cyprian piped up, emerging from behind the only detached
bookcase in the room, wiping spectacles and looking as if he had
been cataloging all his life.</p>

<p>"You are right!" he said sharply. "He is only a danger to his
friends. I say, release him!"</p>

<p>Ghandava glanced at Jeff, whose fist had done the capturing. By
right of <i>lex non scripta</i> * the decision was up to him. But
Jeff, though an irresistible force when his mind is made up, is no
leaper at blind conclusions or interpreter of men's minds. His
forte is common sense, applied.</p>

<p>[* Unwritten law.]</p>

<p>"Stow him incommunicado, while we talk," he suggested, and that
was carried by acclamation.</p>

<p>Bhima Ghandava summoned the green-lined <i>chela</i> by means of
an electric hell.</p>

<p>"Such arrogant simplicity! How simple are the great! He who
could <i>think</i> and be obeyed! To use a common bell&mdash;such
meekness!" exclaimed Chullunder Ghose, rolling his eyes in an
ecstasy.</p>

<p>Bhima Ghandava explained what was required. The <i>chela</i>
addressed remarks to the prisoner, who took no more notice of them
than the image of Buddha would if a fly had rested on it. King
leaned over and prodded Chullunder Ghose in the stomach with a pole
meant for closing windows.</p>

<p>"Less emotion!" he commanded.</p>

<p>Jeff hove himself out of his chair and seized the prisoner under
the arms.</p>

<p>"Lead the way," he said simply.</p>

<p>But as if the threat of violence and the physical contact were
all that were needed to resolve the prisoner's fear, he instantly
began to struggle, springing upright as if Jeff's touch had
released a spring, and smiting Jeff with his clenched fist three
times running between the eyes. Jeff reeled backward and then,
closing with him, had to fight like Samson to save his neck from
breaking; for the bronze man got him by a hold below the arms and,
spinning him upside-down, crashed his head against the floor and
set his foot on the bent neck. It was only three layers of rugs
that saved Jeff from being killed.</p>

<p>For once "Rammy old top" was in the hands of a stronger
adversary. Though he swept the man's legs together with one arm and
threw him, thereafter using every artifice he knew, sending home
punch after terrific punch when opening offered, he could not pin
his adversary down. His previous injuries, though rendered nearly
painless by Ghandava's oils, were a handicap. Each sledge-hammer
blow that his opponent landed, each volcanic wrench at Jeff's arms
and legs, made matters worse.</p>

<p>The end could have only been postponed for seconds. The others
began to rush to Jeff's assistance. Even Chullunder Ghose was on
tip-toe to plunge into the fray, and Cyprian lay down his
spectacles to look for something heavy. But Ghandava's
out-stretched hand kept all of them, <i>chela</i> included,
standing back, they not knowing what he meant to do, yet certain he
could command the situation in a second when he chose. Even Cyprian
expected it, and laid down the heavy brass vase he had picked
up.</p>

<p>But for half-a-minute the pace was too quick for Ghandava, or so
it seemed. Jeff and his prisoner twisted and writhed like bears at
war in spring-time. The bronze man hurled Jeff clear, sprang to his
feet again, seized a wrought-iron cobra meant to hold a lamp and
lifted it to brain him.</p>

<p>The thing weighed about two hundred pounds, and Jeff's forearm,
raised to intercept it, would have smashed like kindling.</p>

<p>Yet it was Ghandava's hand&mdash;smooth, soft palm
upward&mdash;that met the full force of the blow, arresting it
midway&mdash;a hand that looked as if it could not lift the bronze
snake, let alone resist it! And he said one word, in Sanskrit
possibly, at least in an unknown tongue, that seemed to stiffen the
prisoner again from head to foot, so that he stood transfixed with
the heavy bronze thing in his hands, arrested in mid-motion.</p>

<p>"Now take him away," he said quietly; and instead of Jeff the
<i>chela</i> touched him. The giant set down the iron cobra and
followed the <i>chela</i> like a man in a dream&mdash;out through a
door, at the end of the room, that closed on both of them.</p>

<p>"If we use force in their way they can conquer us," Ghandava
said almost apologetically. "It was what you know as luck, friend
Ramsden, that enabled you to capture him last night. You took him
by surprise, or he would have twisted you as a basket-maker twists
the reeds between his hands. The same with every other force they
use; if you stand up against it, it will flatten you. You saw me
then? What I did was to redirect his energy. If I had turned it
inward it would have destroyed him. Instead, I used it to arrest
that iron weight in mid-career&mdash;used his energy, not mine. It
is only a question of knowledge."</p>

<p>"Like riding a horse!" suggested Jeremy. "But how? Tell you
what, sir, I'll swap you! Show me that trick, and I'll teach you
any two you like of mine!"</p>

<p>Ghandava laughed merrily and got back to his place on the
window- seat.</p>

<p>"I rather doubt my need to know your tricks," he answered, "and
to learn mine, if you care to call them tricks, would take more
years than you believe you have at your disposal. Besides&mdash;how
should I dare to teach you, if I could?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Jeremy. "I'm not a crook."</p>

<p>Ghandava smiled again.</p>

<p>"Few of us are what we think we are," he answered.
"You&mdash;all of you&mdash;are on what Hindus call the Wheel. You
are tied to Destiny, the agents of it, bound in your appointed
places. Every star&mdash;planet&mdash;meteorite&mdash;each speck of
dust that swings into view does so in obedience to law. Order is
the first law. None can escape his destiny."</p>

<p>"Ah! Now we all get fortunes told! I shiver on brink of
expectancy! Am I to be plutocrat? To go to jail? To travel
overseas? To be distinguished personage?"</p>

<p>"You're going to be prodded in the belly!" King assured him.</p>

<p>"Ouch! <i>Sahib</i> , there should be a law against this!
Cease!"</p>

<p>"If I could tell fortunes, do you think I would?" Ghandava
asked.</p>

<p>Cyprian, with his thumb between the pages of a black book, came
toward the window and chose a high-backed chair in which he could
sit without doubling up like a rag doll. He preferred dignity to
any kind of comfort.</p>

<p>"To be brief with you, Ghandava," he said, as if calling a
meeting to order, "we are all in your debt for princely
hospitality. Is there more we may expect of you? Our purpose is to
expose the Nine Unknown. We want the secrets of the Nine
Unknown&mdash;their books&mdash;their treasure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Their treasure!" sighed Chullunder Ghose.</p>

<p>"Their treasure and their knowledge!" Grim agreed.</p>

<p>"Their books!" said Cyprian. "Can you help us?"</p>

<p>"Can I, do you mean, or will I?" asked Ghandava.</p>

<p>He smiled as if he found the situation funny.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch16" name="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a><br>
"Sahibs, that is a true speech!"</h2>

<p class="first">GHANDAVA began to pace the floor with hands behind
him.</p>

<p>"To begin with, nothing is impossible!" he said, with an
abruptness that made Cyprian blink.</p>

<p>Chullunder Chose sighed like an epicure in presence of his
favorite dish, deftly avoiding King's attentions with the
window-pole. King was in favor of hard facts and no delirium.</p>

<p>"Does it strike any of you that this account of the Nine Unknown
is ridiculous?" Ghandava asked.</p>

<p>"Not in the least!" said Jeremy promptly, and the others
nodded.</p>

<p>"We <i>know</i> ," said Cyprian.</p>

<p>"Da Gama told us," said Chullunder Chose.</p>

<p>"They've persecuted us ever since we took the field against
them," said Narayan Singh.</p>

<p>"That is what appears to me ridiculous," Ghandava answered. "You
presume a body of nine men, inheritors, as you describe them, of
the scientific secrets of the ancients. You credit these nine with
such wisdom that according to you they have been able to accumulate
enormous quantities of gold at regular intervals for thousands of
years without anyone discovering either its hiding-place or their
method. Yet you say they have persecuted you without success. How
do you propose to account for their alleged success along one line,
and their rather clumsy series of failures along another? Do the
two accounts appear to you compatible?"</p>

<p>"They don't," Grim said. "We decided yesterday that those who
are attacking us probably belong to a different organization."</p>

<p>"Does it occur to you," Ghandava asked, "that these Nines who
have attacked you are themselves in search of the real Nine?"</p>

<p>"That had occurred to this babu," Chullunder Ghose admitted
self- complacently, with his hands folded across his stomach.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell us then?" King demanded.</p>

<p>"Belly being tender part of my anatomy, have said nothing that
might provoke assault on same," the babu answered with both eyes on
King's prodding pole.</p>

<p>Jeremy produced the three coins that remained from Da Gama's
original treasure trove. He passed them to Cyprian, who handed them
to Ghandava.</p>

<p>"Those look like evidence to me," said Jeremy.</p>

<p>"Don't forget," said King, "we've another prisoner in the
office, who swears he was told off to kill a member of the real
Nine in Benares."</p>

<p>Ghandava nodded, but Cyprian joined issue with him.</p>

<p>"Why believe what he says? The organization is a series of
Nines, each member of a Nine being himself a captain of another
Nine and so on. I am entirely satisfied on that point. Thus, the
only means of control or of investigation is from the top. Da Gama
said so. One Nine knows nothing of another. For all we know the
Nine Unknown may be at war with one another. A subordinate told off
to murder one of the Principals might say in honest
ignorance&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ghandava interrupted him with a gesture.</p>

<p>"Doubt from the unexpected quarter! I see I must explain," he
said; but he paused for almost a minute. His next words were
dramatic&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am myself commissioned by the Nine Unknown!" For a second
there was silence. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>"God bless my soul!" exclaimed Cyprian.</p>

<p>Ghandava laughed. Cyprian crossed himself unostentatiously. The
others betrayed astonishment tinged with incredulity, except that
Narayan Singh and Chullunder Chose, while surprised into
speechlessness, looked disposed to credit almost anything.</p>

<p>Ghandava on the whole seemed not displeased with the reception
of his statement.</p>

<p>"The 'Nine Unknown' are known to themselves by another name; and
by yet another name to their few confidants; but they do exist, and
they are the inheritors of all the scientific knowledge of the
ancients," he went on.</p>

<p>"And the gold that has vanished in the course of centuries? Are
they inheritors of that?" asked Ramsden.</p>

<p>"My friend, if I should know the secrets of the Nine, does it
occur to you that I would tell them?"</p>

<p>"Their books! Their books!" Cyprian muttered, and Ghandava took
that up with him.</p>

<p>"Others have wanted those. They who burned the library at
Alexandria did so in order to secure them, and that was when men's
memories were fresher than they are now. <i>They</i> failed, as all
others have done. The Emperor Akbar tried to get the books. He
plundered India for them. But he died in ignorance of their
whereabouts, although in those days some of them were kept within
an hour's walk of Akbar's palace."</p>

<p>"Then <i>you</i> know where they are now!" Cyprian said
excitedly. He could keep neither lips nor fingers still.</p>

<p>"My friend, I have just returned from extensive travels. I know
<i>nothing</i> , beyond that the Nine sent for me and that I have
been commissioned to perform a duty."</p>

<p>"Where are the Nine now?" Cyprian asked him, and Ghandava
laughed.</p>

<p>"We wander from the subject," he replied. "These spurious Nines,
whose organization you describe, have existed for centuries. They
seek the undiscoverable secrets of the Unknown Nine. Their own
secrets are mere hypnotism, mere trickery, mere evil hidden under
the mask of Kali-worship, Thuggee and what not else. In the place
of Knowledge they have grafted superstition, and in place of Truth,
fear. They rule by fear, over- and under-riding the law by keeping
the custodians of public peace in a constant state of fear of them.
They have nothing whatever in common with the Nine who have
commissioned me, and who are altruists&mdash;simply."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" exclaimed Cyprian. "I mean&mdash;pardon me, I beg to
differ! If they were altruists, and have the knowledge you pretend,
they would reveal it to the world&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For the world's undoing!" Ghandava added dryly.</p>

<p>"How can the world be undone by useful knowledge?" King
objected.</p>

<p>"Or how can there be too much treasure?" asked Chullunder Ghose.
"Let loose even the dogs of war&mdash;devouring monsters!&mdash;and
give me money enough&mdash;This babu will buy the victory for
either side! If your principals have all that money, why didn't
they buy the best side in the late fracas of 1914 and finish the
business swiftly? Ouch! King <i>sahib</i> , I beseech you, lay the
pole down!"</p>

<p>"Why do they not now buy India's liberty?" Narayan Singh
demanded. "The British tax-payer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who ever purchased liberty?" Ghandava answered. "Liberty is
earned, or it ceases to exist!"</p>

<p>"Then what are they hoarding gold for?" Ramsden demanded.</p>

<p>"Altruism?" asked Cyprian with raised eyebrows and wrinkled
forehead, looking over his spectacles. "Is there no need of
altruism at this moment?"</p>

<p>Ghandava fell back on his smile.</p>

<p>"You assume too much," he answered. "Altruism has nothing to do
with selfishness."</p>

<p>"Then your people are not altruists in any recognized sense of
the word!" snapped Cyprian.</p>

<p>The old man was getting more and more impatient, possibly
because he felt the control of the situation and of the party
slipping from his grasp. Yet it was he who had introduced Ghandava.
There was not much he could do about it.</p>

<p>"You mean their altruism is not comprehensible to you?" Ghandava
answered. "You assume that the gold that has disappeared for
centuries is all accumulated in one place and lying useless. I
think I can assure you that is not so."</p>

<p>"But the knowledge?" King objected.</p>

<p>"The books!" insisted Cyprian.</p>

<p>Ghandava smiled again and pointed a finger at Cyprian.</p>

<p>"You, my friend, would burn the books if you could find them!
Akbar, if he had found them, would have used the knowledge they
contain for the carving of new empires. Those who burned the
library of Alexandria would have done at least that. Those whom you
call 'my people' have their own interpretation of the books and
their own opinion of their proper use."</p>

<p>"But knowledge," King objected again, "if knowledge is true it
can't do harm, can it?"</p>

<p>"No? Of what is dynamite the product? Of no knowledge?" Ghandava
retorted. "Was it ignorance that built the big guns and invented
poison-gas?"</p>

<p>"The money! The money! Where is the money?" Chullunder Ghose
exclaimed excitedly.</p>

<p>"Gold is not money. Gold is gold," Ghandava replied. "Tell
me&mdash;is humanly comprehensible energy continuous without fuel?
Energy must be released&mdash;is that not so?
Water&mdash;coal&mdash;petroleum&mdash;the tides&mdash;harnessing,
you call it. Did it never strike you there is more energy contained
in a ton of gold than in a million tons of coal? Does that open any
vistas? Do you see that to squander gold as money would be only to
debauch the world, which is already too debauched, whereas gold's
energy released in proper ways might change the very face of
nature? I am telling you no secrets. All the chemists know what I
am hinting at. They don't know how to release the energy from gold
or uranium or thorium, that's all."</p>

<p>"And you?" They chorused the question. He ignored it.</p>

<p>"These Nines, who are variously disguised as anarchists and
Kali- worshipers, know very well that the day of gold <i>as
money</i> is past. Paper based on gold is the present medium. Paper
serves the purpose. Presently the gold will go&mdash;as money. It
is then that its real potency will be discovered. <i>These three
coins that I hold in my hand contain sufficient energy to blow the
whole of Delhi instantly into smithereens</i> . Can you imagine
what might happen if the wrong individuals should learn the secret
of releasing that energy?"</p>

<p>"Inform the right ones then!" suggested Cyprian, with an
intonation not quite innocent of sneer.</p>

<p>"Who are <i>they?</i> " asked Ghandava. "Governments? They would
use the knowledge to annihilate defenseless nations. Scientists?
They would incorporate, and then subdue the world into a new
commercial slavery. The. churches?"</p>

<p>He turned to Cyprian.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;your church, my friend, would burn the books
containing the secret knowledge&mdash;that is by your own
admission. And tell me: which of the other churches would you be
disposed to trust?"</p>

<p>"Well, what do you propose to do with the gold, or the energy
released from it, or the secret knowledge?" Grim demanded.</p>

<p>"That, my friend, is fortunately not my province!" Ghandava
answered, chuckling. "Have you money in your purse?"</p>

<p>Grim nodded.</p>

<p>"Do you know arithmetic?"</p>

<p>He nodded again.</p>

<p>"Some languages? A little natural science? A reputation
possibly? Some skill in diplomacy perhaps? A little self
acquaintance, worth more than all the rest? And the sum-total of
all that is your capital?"</p>

<p>Grim nodded.</p>

<p>"What do you propose to do with it?"</p>

<p>Grim grinned, beginning to see the point.</p>

<p>"Is that my business?" asked Ghandava. "It is every man's own
business what he does with the knowledge that he knows! It is the
business of those who keep the ancient secrets to say what they
will do with them. As long as they keep the secrets&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am like a flat balloon!" Chullunder Ghose broke in. "Oh
grief, why art thou part of me! I who was all optimism&mdash;how my
buoyancy solidifies and bears me down! I saw a pyramid of gold.
Necessitous by force of <i>Karma</i> ,* how I thanked the gods! And
now this holy <i>guru</i> takes the pyramid away and gives us
energy! Oh energy! You jade! I love you not! My belly aches for
money and a long rest! Ow! King sahib&mdash;please!"</p>

<p>[* The law that the sins of former lives inevitably must be met
in this and future ones.]</p>

<p>"But if others steal the secret&mdash;" Jeremy suggested.</p>

<p>Ghandava hesitated. If guesswork had a chance of uncovering his
thoughts, he was speculating whether it was safe to continue. He
seemed most afraid on Cyprian's account. They say, with how much
truth outsiders never know, that information won by any of his
cloth is the property of all of his superiors on demand&mdash;and
they are a goodly number.</p>

<p>However, Ghandava bound none of them by oath.
Instead&mdash;again if guesswork's aim was true&mdash;he limited
himself to explanations that would not explain, and to statements
capable of more than one interpretation. That is the ancient and
accepted way. All prophets and all great teachers have adopted it
in self-defense.</p>

<p>"I, too, am on the Wheel," he said, pacing the floor between
them like an old sea-captain on the poop. "I serve my little
purpose in the great design, and thereafter disappear. Within my
own sphere I am useful; outside it helpless. You recall? You came
to me, asking advice and assistance."</p>

<p>"We've heard some bad advice," said Cyprian with the deliberate
rudeness that old age claims to justify.</p>

<p>Ghandava took no notice of it. He even avoided the odious
alternative of offering the other cheek self-righteously. Not even
a fly, departing on the wing, could have been less recognized than
Cyprian's remark.</p>

<p>"You have a plan, I suppose?" he suggested.</p>

<p>He addressed them all, but they all looked at Cyprian; for it
was he who had been interrupted while laying down the lines of a
plan, in his own place, previous to the holocaust of books. He
seized the opportunity to resume the reins.</p>

<p>"I had a very good plan," he said peevishly. "I proposed just
now that we let a prisoner go, but you have hidden him
somewhere."</p>

<p>Again Bhima Ghandava refused to take offense. An old man's
querulousness seemed to mean no more in his philosophy than the
barking of dogs a mile away. The absolute indifference to petulance
offended Cyprian more than anger might have done and his feeble old
hands fidgeted more nervously than ever on the chair-arms.</p>

<p>Jeremy, observing more intently than the others, crossed over
and sat beside him. Cyprian laid a hand on his shoulder and ceased
trembling. He was always more at ease with Jeremy to lean on.</p>

<p>"Suppose you tell the plan," Ghandava suggested, sitting back in
one of the deep armchairs.</p>

<p>In that attitude you could imagine him in rooms at Oxford or on
a grass-bank under a big tree taking part in a village council. In
fact you could imagine him doing almost anything except starting
trouble.</p>

<p>Cyprian, seeming to draw strength from Jeremy, obliged himself
to smile; but he was plainly subduing passion.</p>

<p>"Had I known, Ghandava, that you are connected with the Nine
Unknown, I never would have come here. You <i>know</i> that," he
said, shaking his head at him.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it," said Ghandava. "That is why I never told you,
friends though we have been. But now that you are here and know the
fact, suppose we make the best of it?"</p>

<p>Ghandava was talking at the others now, <i>through</i> Cyprian.
It was growing clear that Cyprian had made his mind up to withdraw.
Ghandava, realizing that, was equally determined not to lose the
men who, by an accident, had come within his orbit.</p>

<p>"The best?" said Cyprian squeakily. "You tell me you are
employed by the Nine&mdash;in their <i>confidence</i> &mdash;and
you ask me to tell you my plan for obtaining knowledge of them, and
perhaps for capturing their books!"</p>

<p>Ghandava continued smiling, but if he had looked superior he
would have lost the good-will of every man in the room, especially
Jeremy. He was not aggressive; not on the defensive. He was more
like a counsel called in to pass judgment on a problem, seeking the
solution as he listened.</p>

<p>"You speak as if you had the <i>right</i> to the Nine's books,"
he answered quietly. "They would dispute that. From certain
knowledge I assure you there is nothing on earth more impossible
than for you to discover where the books are. You cannot even prove
that the books exist!"</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen them?" Cyprian asked him dryly, suddenly
motionless, watching under lowered, wrinkled lids.</p>

<p>Ghandava laughed.</p>

<p>"I have seen <i>some</i> books. How shall I know to which of
them you refer?"</p>

<p>"<i>All</i> of them!" snapped Cyprian.</p>

<p>"My friend, I will tell you something," said Ghandava. "There
are hundreds of thousands of books, each one of which would come
within your definition. There are libraries in crypts beneath the
desert sands, that represent the knowledge of nations that
disappeared before Atlantis took shape. There are books whose very
alphabet <i>fewer</i> than nine men know, written in a language
compared to which Sanskrit is a <i>modern</i> tongue. There are
individual books among those that contain more true scientific
knowledge than all the works of all the modern chemists and
metallurgists put together. If you had all the books you would have
no building big enough to contain a <i>tenth</i> of them. And if
you were twenty years old you would not have time to learn the
wisdom contained in one book&mdash;which book, however, it is not
within your power to find."</p>

<p>He spoke as one having authority. But he said no more than is
commonly said in the East among men who look deeper than the daily
press for fact, and who listen to the real news of the hemispheres
that susurrates below or else above the bleatings and
bull-boastings of such as sell what they call learning in the
market-place. Cyprian, King and Grim, for instance, were not in the
least surprised. Narayan Singh nodded. Chullunder Ghose assented
less silently:</p>

<p>"I have prayed to the gods; I have even bestowed expensive
presents on the gods, depriving unfortunate family of necessaries
to that end. I have promised the gods, so often and so suppliantly
that they cannot help having heard&mdash;if there are any gods! I
have even told the priests the gist of my intentions, same being
probable secret of failure down to date. If I can find <i>one</i>
such said ancient book and sell same to American Museum, U. S. A.,
I will found orphanage with half of proceeds, and no questions
asked as to orphans' pedigree. Our Ali of Sikunderam
may&mdash;Ouch! King <i>sahib</i> , please apply pole to proper
purposes!"</p>

<p>"So it amounts to this," Ghandava said. "If your purpose is to
rid the world of an evil, I am at your services in so far as I
agree with you what evil is. If you hope to intrude on those who
have commissioned me, I must merely look on. I may possibly prevent
you."</p>

<p>"Let's make a bargain then," suggested Jeremy.</p>

<p>But Bhima Ghandava had no appetite for bargains.</p>

<p>He made a grimace more suggestive of contempt than anything he
had said or done since they entered his house.</p>

<p>"I will do what I <i>can</i> do, freely," he answered.</p>

<p>"We're your guests. Outline what you will do," Ramsden
suggested.</p>

<p>Cyprian agreed to that. There was nothing to lose by listening
to what Ghandava might intend. But the trouble was that he intended
not to give away his hand.</p>

<p>"Father Cyprian had a plan," he said, and folded his arms,
leaning back to listen.</p>

<p>"Go on, Pop!" urged Jeremy. "Lead what you've got! Make him play
higher or pass!"</p>

<p>Cyprian yielded, not as the men of the world yield, but with a
sort of dry, implied assertion that surrender is a victory.</p>

<p>"We all discussed a plan&mdash;we had agreed&mdash;hadn't
we?&mdash;Jeremy to visit Benares&mdash;disguised&mdash;Chullunder
Ghose to talk for him&mdash;Jeremy to be dumb <i>fakir</i>
&mdash;do tricks&mdash;Take the coins of course&mdash;Display
them&mdash;By their means attract attention of these
rascals&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Attention of the <i>rascals</i> &mdash;excellent!" Ghandava
commented.</p>

<p>"The others," Cyprian continued, "Ramsden, King, Grim, Ali of
Sikunderam and all his sons&mdash;go to Benares,
too&mdash;disguised as Hindus, naturally. Watch. When Jeremy
attracts attention of the enemy, they watch&mdash;they watch. You
understand me? Very well then. That was the plan: To watch, and
then track down the enemy."</p>

<p>"I will help you to watch and track down the enemy," Ghandava
said, as a man might who is promising to vote the party ticket.</p>

<p>He was firm, and enthusiastic. Everyone in the room believed
him, even Cyprian. But to believe is not perforce to consent.</p>

<p>"You understand? For my part, I have made no promises," said
Cyprian.</p>

<p>"I have asked none," said Ghandava. "What I have to give, I
give. When do you propose to start? How will you travel? Where will
you stay when you reach Benares? I will do this for you," he said,
unfolding his arms and sitting forward. When he opened his mouth
suddenly in that way the outlines of his jaw and chin showed
distinctly through the gray beard and altered his whole appearance.
He seemed to age enormously&mdash;to be as old as Cyprian&mdash;to
know, from having suffered it, the whole of earth's
iniquity&mdash;and yet to have retained (perhaps, though, to have
gained) a knowledge and assurance beyond human means of measuring.
When he moved his mouth again, enumerating what he would do, the
look of old-age vanished and he was almost on apparent footing with
Ramsden and Narayan Singh.</p>

<p>"I will do these things for you; I will arrange for your
protection&mdash; "</p>

<p>Cyprian snorted, as if he had taken snuff.</p>

<p>"How?" he demanded. "How?"</p>

<p>But Ghandava waved aside the interruption.</p>

<p>"I will give you permission to say you represent the Nine
Unknown. That will lend authority to Mr. Jeremy's claims to be a
wizard!"</p>

<p>"We might <i>say</i> we represented the Nine Unknown without
<i>any one's</i> permission!" Cyprian objected acidly.</p>

<p>"You <i>might</i> . But without permission it would be <i>very
dangerous</i> ," Ghandava assured him; and again there was none in
the room, not even Cyprian, who doubted.</p>

<p>Chullunder Ghose shivered and gasped like a fish out of water,
and Narayan Singh, squatting on the floor, leaned forward that his
eyes might look closer into Ghandava's.</p>

<p>Not that Ghandava minded any of those demonstrations. He seemed
oblivious to praise as well as criticism of himself.</p>

<p>"I will provide you with means of traveling to Benares," he went
on.</p>

<p>"Oh for the wings of the spirit! Give us but a blessing, great
Mahatma, and we shall be in Benares in a minute! Put power on us!
Ouch!"</p>

<p>King returned the window-pole to its place at rest beside him,
and Ghandava continued, ignoring the babu's rhapsody:</p>

<p>"I will provide quarters for you in Benares. And a man shall
guide you into secret places."</p>

<p>"What in return for all this?" Jeff demanded.</p>

<p>"Nothing in return. I am proposing to help you in tracking down
your enemy," Ghandava answered.</p>

<p>"Protection? You spoke of protection," said Cyprian. "How do you
propose to do that? Black art?"</p>

<p>Ghandava smiled at him.</p>

<p>"The enemy will use black art," he answered. "The enemy will
destroy itself. At intervals it does. The hue and cry accumulates,
and grows so great at last that the Nine protect themselves by
letting ever such a little knowledge pass out into the hands of the
enemy. They try to use it, and they die. There was
Sennacherib&mdash;you have heard of him and his army of Assyrians?
I could cite you fifty instances from history, and for every one
such there are a thousand that men never heard of."</p>

<p>"Then you mean, your Nine masters preserve their precious
secrets merely for their own protection?" Cyprian demanded.</p>

<p>Mention of Sennacherib's army and other Old Testament victims of
imponderable forces roused him like a watch-dog guarding against
trespassers. That was his field.</p>

<p>"No, but they protect the secrets, and the secrets them,"
Ghandava answered. "I will show you why. If one of you will open
the big album on that small table by the door you will find in it
more than ten thousand newspaper clippings in more than twenty
languages, every one of which is a direct statement of what the
nations are preparing to do in the next war. You will see mention
of gases that will decimate whole cities in an hour; or submarines
that will render the seas not navigable, and so starve peoples; of
airplanes carrying two-ton bombs loaded with such poison as will
penetrate all known substances and kill men in agony; of guns with
a range exceeding a hundred miles; of newly discovered methods of
vibration that will shake whole cities into ruins; and of many
other things, some even worse than those.</p>

<p>"<i>The forces that the Nine Unknown can use are infinitely
greater than any those war-devising idiots have dreamt of!</i>
Shall they trust their secret to the daily press? And shall they
not defend themselves and their secret against the ambitious rogues
who stop at nothing to possess themselves of what, if they had it,
would put the whole world at their mercy? And they have no mercy,
you know," he added reminiscently, as if he had investigated and
could bear true witness.</p>

<p>"Then you're asking us to track down the enemy so that you may
pounce on him? It that it?" asked Ramsden.</p>

<p>"My friend, I ask nothing!" Ghandava answered, leaning forward,
laying both hands on his thighs for emphasis. "Those who have
commissioned me, forever give without exacting or accepting a
return."</p>

<p>Narayan Singh nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"<i>Sahib</i> ," he said, "that is a true speech. That is how a
man may know that he deals with the <i>Buddhas</i> * and not with
rogues. They give, because they <i>will give</i> , and ask nothing
because none can recompense them."</p>

<p>[* The word is best known as the title of the Lord Gautama or
Buddha. It means "the enlightened."]</p>

<p>Cyprian snorted.</p>

<p>"How about the gold then&mdash;the gold they hoard like
misers?"</p>

<p>"Did <i>you</i> ever part with gold to them?" Ghandava answered,
with the first hint of tartness he had allowed to escape him.</p>

<p>Then, as if regretting that lapse, he crossed the floor and laid
a hand on Cyprian's on the chair-arm.</p>

<p>"My old friend, I will never harm you&mdash;never!" he said
quietly. "You would like to rid the world of certain
knowledge&mdash;or rather of the possibility of learning it, for
the world is ignorant of its very nature. Well, those who have
commissioned me are just as careful to keep that knowledge hidden.
The difference is that we preserve it&mdash;you would burn
it&mdash;that is all. There is no chance of its becoming known. But
if you will be patient you shall glimpse what might happen if even
a millionth part of the knowledge were made known to men not ready
for it. You shall see a wonder, and then guess, if you will, what
Caesar&mdash;who crucified a million Spaniards simply because he
had the power and the inclination&mdash;would have done with poison
gas! Thereafter, consider what the world to-day would do with even
one of the secrets kept by those whom you have heard of as The Nine
Unknown!"</p>

<p>Cyprian's eyes were not dry, but a strong light came through the
window; he pretended it was that. His lips moved silently.
Then&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will burn all their books I can find!" he said in eighty-year
falsetto.</p>

<p>"All you can find," Ghandava answered, smiling.</p>

<p>"I will not go to Benares," Cyprian announced.</p>

<p>He was trembling violently. He looked almost incapable of going
home.</p>

<p>"Stay in my house. Search my library for forbidden volumes!"
Ghandava urged him.</p>

<p>Cyprian stood up, steadying himself on Jeremy's arm, then
brushing Jeremy aside.</p>

<p>"These shall go!" he said. "To Benares! They shall go&mdash;and
shall see. And if they see books, they shall bring them&mdash;bring
them back&mdash;back to me. I will burn what they bring! Ghandava
says he makes no demands. These made me a promise. All the books
they find are mine to do with as I please!"</p>

<p>He looked about him, as if expecting to be contradicted. But it
was true, they had made that promise. None answered.</p>

<p>"Now, make whatever plans you like!" said Cyprian, sitting
down.</p>

<p>Jeff was still pondering the same perplexity, revolving it and
overturning all the possibilities to find what lay beneath, just as
he would have explored a mineral prospect.</p>

<p>"I don't understand yet," he objected, thrusting his lower jaw
forward, meaning to understand if it took all day. "You ask nothing
from us? You ask us to go to Benares, don't you?"</p>

<p>"No," Ghandava answered. "You were going to Benares."</p>

<p>"What do you want us to do when we get there?" Jeff
demanded.</p>

<p>"Nothing!" said Ghandava. "Yet your purpose was&mdash;in going
there&mdash;I think&mdash;to get in touch with and to
undo&mdash;will the word serve?&mdash;then to undo an organization
<i>calling itself</i> the Nine Unknown. I have offered to
help."</p>

<p>"You say that it <i>isn't</i> the Nine Unknown," Jeff
objected.</p>

<p>"Are you less intent on that account?" Ghandava asked. "When you
came this morning you were anxious for an issue with your enemy.
You have felt the teeth and talons of the underlings. You asked me
for help in discovering the captains. I will help."</p>

<p>"You propose to take advantage of us?" Jeff suggested. But his
smile withdrew the sting.</p>

<p>"No more than you of me," Ghandava answered. "We go the same
way. Let us march together. There will never be a stage of the
proceedings at which you are not at liberty to withdraw."</p>

<p>"Accept that!" ordered Cyprian, pursing his lips up, nearly
rising to his feet again, and sitting down.</p>

<p>They accepted, one by one, each meeting Ghandava's gaze and
nodding. That was the nearest they came to a pledge at any
time.</p>

<p>"And, now," Ghandava said, "we may as well bring in the prisoner
again."</p>

<p>Almost before the last word left Ghandava's lips Chullunder
Ghose squealed delightedly. Ghandava rang no bell. No gong
announced his pleasure. Yet, exactly as he gave the wish expression
the door at the end of the room opened wide and the green-lined
<i>chela</i> entered, leading the prisoner as easily as a farm-hand
leads a bull.</p>

<p>"Did you see that? <i>Sahibs</i> , did you notice&mdash;"</p>

<p>King prodded the babu into breathless silence. The prisoner
turned with his back to the window and faced Ghandava, who observed
him like a professor of entomology considering a wasp, not
unkindly, almost with familiarity, wholly curious. The bronze man
seemed no longer to be hypnotized.</p>

<p>"What shall be done with you?" Ghandava asked.</p>

<p>The prisoner smiled loathsomely&mdash;a brute unable to see
plain motives. "You can do nothing with me! Your law is you may not
shed blood," he answered.</p>

<p>"If I let you go, will you let these friends of mine go in peace
to Benares?"</p>

<p>The bronze man hesitated. Then a smile of evil cunning added to
the coarseness of his lips, and he drew himself up with an effort
to seem princely.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said in Hindi&mdash;arrogant, according favors. "That
is granted."</p>

<p>"Go then!" said Ghandava; and the green-lined <i>chela</i> led
the giant out.</p>

<p>"Sleep now. You all need sleep," Ghandava said, and none, not
even Cyprian, objected when he showed them to cool rooms within
thick walls where silence and soft mattresses held promise of
delight. They all slept, saving Grim, who lay awake and thought of
Ali of Sikunderam alone in the office with a prisoner.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch17" name="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a><br>
"There will be no witnesses&mdash;say that and stick to it!"</h2>

<p class="first">UNITY is the profoundest law. Man, attempting
little bush- league innovations imitates unconsciously the
Infinite. So the custom is the same in Naples, or Palermo, or
Chicago&mdash;Pekin&mdash;Delhi&mdash;Teheran&mdash;Jerusalem&mdash;
who wages a vendetta does so on his own account, at his own risk,
and he recognizes no higher law than his own will.</p>

<p>Police&mdash;all governments&mdash;are off-side&mdash;enemies in
common, whom foes should unite to defeat. Whoso calls in the police
is despicable in the eyes of friend and enemy alike.</p>

<p>And there is another rule, almost universal throughout nature.
The unusual, the unexpected, the unconventional are fighting cues.
The sparrow with white feathers, the man with new ideas, the fellow
whose weapons are not <i>en règle</i> , alike must meet intense
resentment. Fists in a land where daggers are the rule, are more
heretical than ragtime in a synod. Heresy is provocation.</p>

<p>So there came to Ali of Sikunderam, in the office up the alley
in the Chandni Chowk, a woman&mdash;veiled. Men say that was
nothing exceptional in his experience. Seven sons by seven mothers
are excuse for that witticism on which slander feeds, and scandal
is self-multiplying&mdash;very breath in the nostrils of the
scandalized. Nevertheless, it was nothing unusual for a veiled
woman to be seen in that neighborhood. Scores&mdash;hundreds of
them threaded the alley daily. None paid attention to this one as
she climbed the crowded stairs, although that may have been partly
because observant eyes&mdash;and in India all eyes are
observant&mdash;might have noticed that several men in rather dingy
yellow robes were watching her possessively from up and down the
alley. No wise man insists on trouble in such circumstances.</p>

<p>She was veiled when she knocked at the office door. But the
instant Ali opened she threw back the veil, as if she knew whom she
would find in there and what means was the best for holding his
attention. Certainly she seized it on the instant.</p>

<p>"Queen of all pearls! Pearl among queens!" he said, staring at
her.</p>

<p>She being alone, and he well armed, there was nothing about her
that he needed to fear; and there was much he found no difficulty
in admiring.</p>

<p>She was full-lipped, heavy-breasted, and her long, black, oily
hair was coiled in thick ropes that resembled snakes. She had full,
bold eyes like Gauri's, whom Ali had thought of honoring with his
feudal attentions until her house was burned, which made her not
worthwhile. And she wore the same air of worldly wisdom and of
tolerance for the world's too-little virtue that had made of Gauri
such an easy lady to hold converse with. She was Gauri's
size&mdash;height&mdash;so like Gauri that the floors of memory
swept Ali's caution out from under him. But her golden ornaments
were heavier than Gauri's. The emeralds in her ears were worth as
much as all of Gauri's fortune before da Gama looted her. And in
one other aspect she was noticeably different.</p>

<p>There was a swelling under her left jaw that looked almost like
the mumps, only it was more inflamed and discolored. Someone or
something had struck her, not only recently but terrifically
hard.</p>

<p>"Queen of the queens of Paradise, who hit thee?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>He spoke tenderly&mdash;for him; but the Asian ardor blazed
behind his eyes, and no woman not on adventure bent would have
faced him without blenching. Ali, however, did not consider that.
Men think less alertly after going long without sleep.</p>

<p>"Am I in paradise?" he asked. "Art thou a houri?"</p>

<p>She smiled at him. It may be that the smile cost agonies, on
account of the swollen jaw, but she answered in a soft, low voice
that thrilled with the suggestion of mystery, speaking&mdash;marvel
of all marvels!&mdash;in his own tongue, the guttural, hoarse
Pushtu of Sikunderam.</p>

<p>"Prince of princes! Captain of the thousands!"</p>

<p>Perfect! That is exactly the way to speak to a Northern
gentleman. Ali stroked his beard and rearranged the riding-angle of
his Khyber knife.</p>

<p>"Djereemee-Rass <i>sahib</i> , King <i>sahib</i> , Jimgrim
<i>sahib</i> , Ramsden <i>sahib</i> , all send greeting. With the
sons of queens, who call thee sire, your honor's honor should
follow me to a certain place."</p>

<p>She smiled again, and Ali stroked his beard until it shone under
his hand as if from brushing.</p>

<p>"Who struck thee?" he demanded for the second time.</p>

<p>"A man in the street&mdash;a <i>badmash</i> *&mdash;a man in
yellow&mdash;one of those who worship Kali," she answered.</p>

<p>[* Low-down scoundrel.]</p>

<p>Ali hesitated. Natural suspicion stirred a naturally shrewd wit,
and memory, on the verge of sleep, awoke with one of those starts
that bring the recent panorama of events in a flash before the
mind. That set him thinking. She had asked him to bring his sons;
therefore they had not been waylaid yet. She had a tiny spot of
crimson on her forehead, where the caste-mark of the Kali sect had
been recently rubbed out. She, if one of the enemy, might know the
names of all the white men in the party, because of the five-pound
note in da Gama's hat-band, signed by Jeremy, and the sheet of
paper in da Gama's pocket on which the Portuguese had jotted down
terms&mdash;and undoubtedly names. Ali added those circumstances
tip and multiplied the total into certainty: She sought to decoy
him in order to force from him news of his friends' plans and
present whereabouts.</p>

<p>"Queen of cockatrices!" he spat out suddenly, and slapped her
with his flat hand over the jaw where the swelling was.</p>

<p>He slapped as he augured, shrewdly. Pain was so sudden and
intense that for a minute she could not scream, but lay on the
office floor holding both hands to her face and rocking herself. He
stooped over her, according to his own account to feel for weapons,
but made a commencement by twitching at an emerald ear-stud, and
the speed with which she drew a dagger then was swifter than a
snake's. He sprang clear, avoiding her upward stab by the width of
the goose-flesh on his belly.</p>

<p>"Mother of corruption!"</p>

<p>She had had her chance and lost it. Whipping out his long knife
he knocked her dagger spinning, and with his teeth showing clean as
a hound's in a battle-laugh between the gray-shot black of beard
and upper-lip he set one foot on her and pressed her to the
floor.</p>

<p>"Mother of evil tidings! What ill-omen brought thee? Speak!"</p>

<p>But she would not speak, although he showed his swordmanship,
whirling his blade until it whistled within an inch of her defiant
eyes. And from that he drew his own conclusions.</p>

<p>"So! Not alone? An escort waits&mdash;too far away to hear
screams&mdash;but will come unless the she-decoy returns in time.
Hah!"</p>

<p>He removed his foot from between her breasts and she raised
herself with a hand on the floor, but he kicked her under the
injured jaw again and with the same toe sent her floundering behind
the desk, where the prisoner in yellow lay.</p>

<p>Suddenly then it occurred to him that she and the prisoner
should not hold intercourse. It only takes a second for the East to
tell the East the news. He pounced on her again and dragging her
away, flung her across the room, bending then over the man in
yellow to make sure his bonds were taut and cursing him for having
dared to see what he could not help seeing.</p>

<p>"Allah! If I were a hard man I would tear thy tongue out to save
talk! Luckily for thee my heart is wax. I am a man of mercy."</p>

<p>He repaid attention to the woman then, and it was time; she was
creeping along the wall toward the door. He seized her by one foot
and, she kicking like a caught fish, pulled her back to the
farthest corner, where he tied her hand and foot with thin string
meant for wrapping parcels, using the best part of a ball of the
stuff, for Ali was no sailor.</p>

<p>The rest of his task was simple enough&mdash;and satisfying. He
removed the emeralds from her ears, the gold from her neck, wrists
and ankles, and every one of the jeweled brooches that fastened her
outer garments.</p>

<p>She called him a pig of an Afghan for that, and he was in the
act of gagging her by way of reprisal when another knock sounded on
the office door.</p>

<p>He knew it was none of his sons. They had their own private code
of signals. He picked up the only rug and heaped it over the woman
to conceal her.</p>

<p>"Mother of a murrain!" he growled in Pushtu. "Does death tempt
you? If so, make one sound, and die thus!"</p>

<p>In pantomime he showed how a Khyber knife goes in below the
stomach and rips upward. Then he arranged the rug over her and
turned to face the door.</p>

<p>"Open!" commanded someone&mdash;a stranger with a strange voice,
speaking Hindu.</p>

<p>There was only one voice. He could only hear one man shifting
his feet restlessly. He could not see through the frosted-glass
panel of the door, nor through the keyhole for the key was in
it.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"A messenger. The <i>sahib's</i> sons have sent me."</p>

<p>That was an obvious lie. The sons of Ali of Sikunderam knew
better than to instruct their furious sire by, deputy.</p>

<p>"How many of you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"One."</p>

<p>But he suspected, and suspicion was unthinkable without its
concrete consequence, with Ali's nerves in that state. He struck
the glass panel with his knife-point and as the glass broke clapped
his eye to it.</p>

<p>He could only see one man&mdash;a fellow in a yellow smock,
apparently unarmed. He, too, used the broken pane to get a glimpse
of Ali. He used it to good purpose. Drawing back suddenly he thrust
a long stick through with such force that it drove Ali back on his
heels and sent him reeling against the desk. And before he could
recover a lean hand beneath a yellow sleeve inserted itself through
the broken pane and turned the key. One man walked in, followed by
five others, the last of whom closed the door behind him and stood
with his back against the broken glass.</p>

<p>"Be swift!" said the first man. "Two belonging to us are here. A
woman and a man. Where?"</p>

<p>But six to one, though odds enough, were no conclusive argument
to Ali of Sikunderam. And there are few, who have not seen it, who
are able to imagine the swiftness and the spring-steel savagery of
the North at bay. All six drew knives from under their smocks, but
all too late&mdash;Ali had laid out two of them, gutted and
writhing in their own hot bowels, before he had as much as to guard
himself. And as the third man advanced with a jump to engage, the
sixth screamed; someone in the passage thrust a long knife through
the broken glass and pierced him through the kidneys from
behind.</p>

<p>The reserves had come! Now three men had to deal with Ali and
with six of Ali's sons!</p>

<p>But they were three stern fighters, and they, too, had
reenforcement.</p>

<p>She on the floor, whom Ali had struck and kicked and covered up,
struggled&mdash;only ifrits or a sailor could explain
how&mdash;from the tight-wound string, and seized a knife whose
hilt was slippery with the blood of its erstwhile owner. With that
she slashed the lashing on her ankles, and a yell from one of Ali's
sons warned him in the nick of time that she was up on her feet and
coming.</p>

<p>Rahman's pantomime saved him. Rahman, speechless with
excitement, ducked as he, too, would have ducked if the knife had
been swinging at the base of his on skull. And Ali imitated, hardly
knowing what he did, guided more by telepathic instinct than by his
reason. For the second time the woman's knife missed him by a
hair's breadth. The back of his neck felt seared as if a hot iron
had almost touched it, so close and so terrific was the woman's
lunge.</p>

<p>But it was <i>her</i> last act, not his. The North's retort
discourteous is quicker than the wild boar's jink and rip. The
impulse brought her stumbling against his back and he threw her
with the "chuck" they boast in Cornwall&mdash;over his shoulders,
forward&mdash;caught her as she fell&mdash;thrust her like a shield
with his left hand into an opponent, driving the long knife with
his right into her body three times&mdash;and then slew the man
behind her with a downward blow that split his skull midway to the
mouth. The knife stuck in the tough bone. The men in yellow rushed
him, taken in the rear themselves by Rahman and the other sons. Ali
let go the Khyber knife and drew his dagger; and from that moment
there was no more hope or thought of quarter&mdash;no hope for
whichever side was weaker, unless interruption came. And the odds
were five to two, for two of Ali's sons were down.</p>

<p>And who should trespass into other men's disputes in Delhi, in
these days of non-cooperation and distrust? A man might yell for
help the day long, and no more than tire his lungs. There is
trouble without wooing it, and he who starts a fight may finish it
counting on no interference from strangers.</p>

<p>Now the office was a shambles&mdash;blood and bowels on the
floor&mdash;loose-limbed dead men yielding this and that way to the
kicks of the frenzied living&mdash;grunts&mdash;low, explosive
oaths&mdash;the sudden, sullen, lightning thrust and parry as the
daggers struck or missed&mdash;no shouting now.&mdash;no breath for
it&mdash;the stink of raw blood and the electric thrill of death's
wings&mdash;thumping of feet growing fewer. No beasts fight as
evilly as men.</p>

<p>Three of Ali's sons, including Rahman bled to death on the
office floor while their sire raged like a typhoon over them,
working with a dagger for room and time in which to free the long
knife from his victim's skull. And then with a foot on the skull
and a wrench he had it. So, not neatly, as Narayan Singh would have
slain, but roughly like the butchers who cleave meat in a hurry as
it hangs, he hacked the two remaining Kali-men to death, saving
three sons&mdash;one so badly wounded that his only chance was in
the hospital.</p>

<p>"And so what?" he demanded, questioning Allah it might be as he
wiped his reeking blade on a victim's smock.</p>

<p>The two whole sons asked nothing, but proceeded to the looting,
one stripping his dead brothers first of every valuable thing and
the other naturally picking out the woman. Ali laughed at him.</p>

<p>"Fool! Am I brainless? Should I tie her and not scratch?"</p>

<p>He had no more breath for words. Disgust at losing three, it
might be four sons in such a mean fight half-unmanned him. With a
gesture he ordered the woman thrown under the rug again where he
himself had hidden her, and the son obeyed. He did not really know
why he ordered that. He was hardly thinking. Rather he was looking
about him for a bandage for his son's wounds. Suddenly he thought
that if he left the wounded son there, as he must, the presence of
the woman's body might make lying difficult; and Ahmed would have
to lie like history or else say nothing when relief should come.
Lying is much the easier of those alternatives, to a man born north
of where the Jumna bends by Dera Ghazi Khan.</p>

<p>"Take her out! Cover her in that!" he ordered; and the prisoner
behind the desk, hearing but not seeing, made a mental note of
it.</p>

<p>He heard, too, the grunting and heavy footsteps as the two
uninjured sons picked up the rug with the woman's body and carried
it out to be dumped in the unused cellar where rats would eat it,
and whoever found bones might conjecture what he pleased.</p>

<p>Then Ali, bandaging his wounded son as carefully as circumstance
permitted, gave him water and forbidden whisky from the office
gallon jar, and bade him sit there with his back propped in a
corner until someone should come from the Moslem hospital&mdash;to
whom he should lie like a gentleman.</p>

<p>"These men in yellow came&mdash;broke in&mdash;found me and my
brothers&mdash;attacked us murderously&mdash;and were slain by me,
Ahmed son of Ali ben Ali of Sikunderam. I know not why they came,
nor who they are."</p>

<p>That was the lie, and surely good enough for a man at death's
door, in a land where a trial may take a year awaiting.</p>

<p>"There will be no witnesses: Say that and stick to it!" said
Ali. "Beg of the <i>Wakf</i> for proper burial for thy brothers
and, it may be, also for thyself!"</p>

<p>Then he gagged and blindfolded his prisoner, released his legs
and hurried him out between the two uninjured sons through the door
at the end of the passage into the warehouse, where all was gloom
among the bales and none asked questions in any event. Thence he
sent one son running to find a man, whose word was good with the
Moslem hospital, and sat down on a bale of aloes to consider.</p>

<p>The problem was how now to get in touch with King, Grim, Jeremy
and Ramsden. He was not afraid of being caught, because only his
friends had keys to the warehouse door, nor afraid of consequences
if he should be caught, since in a land of lies, who lies the best
is king. Dead men are not efficient witnesses, and Ahmed had been
well trained. But the prisoner was an embarrassment, and he did not
care to dispose of him without instructions.</p>

<p>He removed the stuffy blindfold from the prisoner, not from
merciful but mercenary reasons. The drugs in the bales all about
them were pungent and exceeding dry. He had a thought, that became
him as soldier of fortune.</p>

<p>"Are you thirsty?" it occurred to him to ask.</p>

<p>Unwilling to admit it, for he guessed the motive, the prisoner
shook his head. Ali gravely doubted him. He sought a bale of
capsicum, and pulling loose a handful crushed the stuff to powder
under the prisoner's nose. If he had not been thirsty previous to
that, his condition now was indisputable.</p>

<p>"You shall drink when you tell me where my friends are!" he said
bluntly.</p>

<p>"I don't know that," the prisoner answered.</p>

<p>"By Allah, but you do! You saw the fellow with the green-lined
cloak, who took my friends the <i>sahibs</i> and the Sikh away with
him. You recognized him, for I saw your eyes. Tell me where he
lives."</p>

<p>The prisoner coughed up most of the torturing dust.</p>

<p>"I will tell you when you tell me what you did with HER," he
answered, the water running from his eyes. "Where have you hidden
her?"</p>

<p>"I killed her," Ali answered, so promptly and frankly, that the
prisoner was sure he lied.</p>

<p>"Let me speak with HER, and I will tell you anything you want to
know," he answered.</p>

<p>"Answer my question. Moreover write an order for a thousand
rupees payable to my son, who will collect the money and bring
water back with him. Then you shall drink," said Ali; and having
thrown more dust of capsicum into the prisoner's lips and nostrils,
he settled down to bide his time and meditate.</p>

<p>Sleep was overtaking him again. He had to wrestle with his
senses. Thoughts shaded into one another, and the outlines blurred
until a half- dream and a fact were indistinguishable. He could not
guess what capital to make of the prisoner's belief that
SHE&mdash;whoever <i>she</i> was&mdash; was still living. He had
slain her, that was sure.</p>

<p>The prisoner wished to speak with her, that was also sure. Ergo,
she meant something to the prisoner; but what? And what might it
all mean to his friends the <i>sahibs</i> ? Ali was forever
thoughtful for his friends, when his own immediate and perhaps
prospective needs had had attention. How he wished he had brains
like Jimgrim <i>sahib</i> , or King <i>sahib's</i> experienced
wisdom, or Jeremy <i>sahib's</i> swift intuition, or even the
ability to grind an answer out as Rammy <i>sahib</i> did, seeming
to compel his intellect to work by brute force! He tried that, but
solutions would not come.</p>

<p>He heard his son return and listened dully to the account of how
the ambulance was coming presently. He heard the ambulance arrive,
as in a dream, and heard the tramping and excited comments of the
men, who found all those corpses and one unconscious Hillman in the
office, and were suitably impressed. He heard the tramping and the
voices die away, and later, as the heat increased, sent one of his
two sons for water, which he drank in the prisoner's presence.
Then, giving orders to his sons to increase the prisoner's thirst
by all means possible, he fell asleep and dreamed, according to his
own account of it, of emeralds and wild-eyed women and of a great
high-priest who came and blessed him, making signs in the air as he
did so with an unsheathed Khyber knife.</p>

<p>He awoke with a start, and stared into a strange face!</p>

<p>"Is this he?" a quiet voice asked, and then he heard a voice he
would have known in any crowd as Jimgrim's:</p>

<p>"Sure. Say, Ali? What did you keep the prisoner dry for? And
what does the locked-up office and broken glass mean? Bhima
Ghandava <i>sahib</i> and I have had to come the back way because
of a police guard on the stairs and in the passage. Why?"</p>

<p>Ali explained and, drawing the two aside, told partly why he
gave the prisoner no drink.</p>

<p>"He believes SHE still lives," he added, wondering what Grim
would make of it.</p>

<p>Grim glanced at Ghandava.</p>

<p>"Loose him and let him go!" advised Ghandava, almost
instantly.</p>

<p>"By gad, sir&mdash;by the Big Jim Hill&mdash;I do believe you're
right!" Grim answered.</p>

<p>"Ye are mad!&mdash;both mad!" said Ali, staring stupidly. "Good
enough. Let the prisoner go!" commanded Grim.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch18" name="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br>
"He has whatever she had!"</h2>

<p class="first">IT was Grim, returning from the Chandni Chowk that
afternoon, awaking them one by one, who summoned another conference
in Ghandava's great, cool library. Ghandava had disappeared, but
the smell of artful cookery ascended from below-stairs, and the
green-lined <i>chela</i> kept himself in evidence at intervals,
incurious and yet alert. He never seemed to listen, nor to keep
from listening, but hovered in and out like a house-mouse busy with
affairs behind the scenes. Once he was gone for a whole hour.</p>

<p>"Giving my imagination utmost creeps!" as Chullunder Ghose
remarked.</p>

<p>"Ghandava fears only this," said Grim: "The prisoner may be too
incensed by Ali's ill-treatment. He was a wabbler to start with.
You remember, when we caught him in the minaret he was flinching
from doing murder in Benares. He'll return to his superiors,
because there's nowhere else for him and he may flop hack
altogether. He'll say the snake-woman is alive and that we've
hidden her. His murderous instincts may have been so stirred up by
Ali that he'll volunteer to identify and kill us all as opportunity
permits."</p>

<p>"Why should Ghandava worry about our getting killed?" asked
Jeremy, unimpressed.</p>

<p>"He's in with us," said Grim.</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Gone. Benares!"</p>

<p>Jeremy whistled. Again he saw adventure coming to him on the
wing down-wind, and liked it.</p>

<p>"You see," said Grim, "they won't rest while they think we've
got that woman. They'll not look for her corpse while they think
she's alive, and they'll probably try to kill us one by one until
we give her up."</p>

<p>"Tell 'em she's dead then, and where to find the body," Jeff
suggested. "Where's Ali and where did he hide it?"</p>

<p>"No!" Grim answered instantly. "Let's get a woman to represent
her! Keep them tracking us&mdash;you get me? Let them think their
woman has swapped horses&mdash;joined us. One man we've let go will
give them ground for that idea. The other&mdash;the big
one&mdash;will tell 'em we're cahooting with the Nine
Unknown&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How'll he know that?" Jeff objected.</p>

<p>Grim signified the green-lined <i>chela</i> , who had come in
through one door, apparently to set a book in place, and walked out
through the other at the rear.</p>

<p>"He showed him the way out. He told him that," said Grim.</p>

<p>"Oh glorious! Oh exquisite! What ignorant West would call
'Telepathy'!" Chullunder Ghose exclaimed. "Mahatma, knowing what
outcome of conference will be, <i>wills</i> that <i>chela</i> shall
say thisly and do thusly! Krishna! This is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Billiards!" said King, and prodded him in the stomach with the
window-pole.</p>

<p>"I forsee fortune!" Narayan Singh announced. But what <i>he</i>
means by fortune is the opportunity to use his faculties, including
swordsmanship.</p>

<p>"Thou second-sighted butcher!" said the babu.</p>

<p>"<i>Chup!</i> "* commanded King.</p>

<p>[* Shut up!]</p>

<p>"You see, it's this way," Grim resumed. "Ghandava knows how we
hit this trail, considers we're honest, and says we're useful to
his employers. We're helping to put the hat on these criminal
Nines, whose hour, by his account of it, has come. He plans to
reciprocate. He'll let us see what we started after."</p>

<p>"The gold?" demanded Ramsden.</p>

<p>"So I understand him."</p>

<p>"Books! Tut-tut! The books!" said Cyprian, emerging with a big
book in his hands from behind the detached case.</p>

<p>But Grim shook his head. Ghandava had said nothing about showing
where the secret books were kept. Cyprian shrugged his shoulders,
losing interest, and if he cared that men had died he did not show
it. Probably he wanted not to seem to know too much.</p>

<p>"Where's Ali?" Ramsden asked again.</p>

<p>"Gone with two sons in search of Gauri. She looks enough like
the woman of the snakes to pass for her in a pinch with the lights
turned low. At any rate, she's our lone chance," Grim answered.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said King. "She'll funk it."</p>

<p>"Broke. House burned. Past the bloom of youth. Funk nothing!"
Grim retorted. "She'll jump at the hope of a <i>lakh</i> of
rupees."</p>

<p>"Who'll pay her the <i>lakh?</i> " wondered Jeremy.</p>

<p>"That was the bargain we made&mdash;a <i>lakh</i> in return for
her help if we find the money."</p>

<p>"And if we can't collect?"</p>

<p>"Grim, Ramsden and Ross must pay her a solatium."</p>

<p>"And if Ali can't find her?"</p>

<p>"Then the plan's down the wind."</p>

<p>But it was not, although Ali came within the hour and swore that
neither he nor either of his sons could find the woman.</p>

<p>"She is doubtless already in the household of a priest," he
swore resentfully. "I could have scared the fool! By Allah! She
would have obeyed if I had found her!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my God! <i>Hinc illae lacrimae!</i> " remarked the babu,
voicing the collective gloom. "We get a mental glimpse of gold and
lo, it vanishes physically with the veil of an immodest woman!"</p>

<p>But they were reckoning again without the green-lined
<i>chela</i> . Fastidious, ascetic, handsome, one would have
selected him no more than a church verger to know Gauri's
whereabouts. Yet he came in smiling&mdash;said they should be
getting ready&mdash;and offered to find Gauri soon enough.</p>

<p>"For I have means within means," he explained, without
explaining.</p>

<p>"Get me a carriage. Send me home!" commanded Cyprian.</p>

<p>But that was vetoed instantly. The battle in the office was as
sure to cause investigation as a fire does heat. Cyprian might have
been seen passing in and out on several occasions, and if inquiry
should lead to his house there were the furnace and the ashes of
burned books to excite suspicion further.</p>

<p>"Stay here, Pop, until we come back from Benares, or our
bargain's off!" said Jeremy.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;you mean?"</p>

<p>"If you leave this house before we return, and we find books,
we'll keep 'em!"</p>

<p>"Take the padre-<i>sahib</i> with us!" urged Narayan Singh. "He
is old and little. Somewhere we can hide him."</p>

<p>Behind the old priest's back the green-lined <i>chela</i> shook
his head, disparagingly. But there was no need. Cyprian, loaded
down with more than weight for age, would have refused that anyhow.
Nor did his empty nest, with its secret squirrel-horde of books
gone, attract him any more than the prospect of answering awkward
questions. There would be no servant&mdash;no tidings&mdash;none of
the associations that had made the place worthwhile.</p>

<p>"I will stay here," he said simply, and returned, black book in
hand, behind the bookcase.</p>

<p>Then came the game of getting ready. Little, little details are
the nemesis of dams, designs and men. They had to think of all the
details of manner and habit, and they ended up by lamp-light,
weary, with the green- lined <i>chela</i> looking on. Then, after
supper in the room below, it was all to do over, for Gauri came
with her maid and drilled them, while Ali snored and dreamed of
vengeance on every man in India who had worn, did wear, or ever
should wear a yellow smock; and it happened thus that their edifice
of make-believe was crowned&mdash;pluperfect.</p>

<p>For Gauri was a pauper. Shabby clothes were all she had, so she
and the maid, whose lack of fortune was involved in hers, were as
sharp-eyed and hungry for a chance as adjutants* at dawn.</p>

<p>[* An enormous bird protected in India as a scavenger.]</p>

<p>"How did you come here?" Ramsden wondered, when they paused
between rehearsals.</p>

<p>Gauri glanced at the snoring Ali, shuddered at his long knife,
and explained:</p>

<p>"They said he&mdash;that one&mdash;looked for me. I was afraid.
His knife is his god. Better trust one who worships his belly.
Better trust Chullunder Ghose! I ran and hid. But another in a
green-lined cloak came, saying Ali wanted me in behalf of a
<i>sahib</i> in the Street of Shah Jihan. One who overheard him
told me, and I went to see. There a man with a caste-mark such as I
never saw met me and brought me hither. That is how I came.
Now&mdash;ye say Ali slew that woman whom ye wish me to resemble?
Slew her without witnesses?"</p>

<p>They nodded, waiting. Something was in the wind, for her eyes
shone.</p>

<p>"Pay me for my services whatever jewelry she had!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" Jeff Ramsden's thoughts were a bar behind the rest
as usual.</p>

<p>She interrupted him.</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> has whatever <i>she</i> had," she said simply.</p>

<p>She had cast her die, and she was a gambler heart and soul.
Nothing&mdash;no argument could change her once the stakes were
down; and she had named the stakes&mdash;her neck against whatever
Ali's loot amounted to!</p>

<p>So Ali had to wake up, she protesting that the best way would
have been to loot him while he slept. Grim did the explaining,
taking all for granted, to save time.</p>

<p>"Ali, there is an argument. You settle it. One says, whoever
finds this gold should have the whole of it; the others, that all
should share and share in any case. What say you?"</p>

<p>And if the North loves one thing it is playing Solomon,
pronouncing wise decisions, justice in the abstract being one thing
and according it another.</p>

<p>"We being friends," said he, "what injures one is injury to all;
and by Allah, what profits one should profit all of us. So we
should share and share alike."</p>

<p>Grim looked disappointed&mdash;subtlest flattery!</p>

<p>"Then if I alone should of my own skill win a treasure, should
you share that?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"By the Prophet of Allah, why not?" Ali answered, delighted to
have Jimgrim on the hip. "Whatever any of us finds while our
agreement lasts belongs to all, to be shared between us."</p>

<p>Grim might have jumped him then, but Grim was wise.</p>

<p>"Then could the vote of all of us dispose of the discovery of
one?"</p>

<p>"Why certainly, by Allah, yes!" said Ali. "Was that not agreed
in the beginning?"</p>

<p>"Then let us vote on this," said Grim: "Gauri offers her service
for the jewels you took from the woman you slew in the office!
Someone should propose a motion! Let us see the jewels anyhow."</p>

<p>Trapped&mdash;aware that he was trapped, and on the horns of his
own verdict&mdash;Ali looked about him; for the East may not be
made to hurry even in dilemma, having earned that right by studying
dignity for thirty thousand years. He had two sons. Conceivably he
might tempt Chullunder Ghose, or threaten him, and cast four votes.
Omitting Cyprian, who might, or might not vote, that left the odds
five to four against hint, for he knew Narayan Singh would side
with his Western friends, and there was no doubt in his mind
whatever what they would do.</p>

<p>He might refuse to show the loot. He might walk out, explaining
he would think the matter over, and naturally not return. He who
had lost so many sons had a right to consider himself&mdash;to
recompense himself as best he could. Yet he was not quite sure of
the value of his loot. The gold was heavy enough, but the ear-studs
might be glass. In the long, long pause that followed Grim's
question he even considered the thought of betrayal&mdash;for he
was born north of Peshawar, where treason and a joke are one. But
he knew that if he went to the police, then he would have to do his
own explaining of perplexing matters that were best let lie.
Moreover, the police might&mdash;nay, <i>would</i> search him.</p>

<p>And the men he faced were men. In his own storm-tempered,
hillman way he loved them.</p>

<p>"It was knowing that myself must first comply with the decision,
that I answered as I did," he said with dignity, hitching to the
front beneath his shirt the leather-pouch in which he carried his
own secrets. "Lo, I set example. Look! By Allah, let none say Ali
of Sikunderam fell short of an agreement!"</p>

<p>Handful after handful he pulled out the necklace&mdash;little
golden human skulls on a string of golden human hair&mdash;the
bracelets&mdash;the anklets&mdash;the brooches&mdash;and the
earrings last. He tossed the earrings into the midst of the heap,
half-hoping none would notice them; but by the light he saw in
Gauri's eyes he knew that whether they were glass or not they, too,
were gone for just so much of the forever as a woman could
withstand his siege.</p>

<p>"Lo, I have given five sons and now this!" he said with dignity.
"As Allah is my witness, I give, knowing there is recompense."</p>

<p>"Someone should make a motion," Grim repeated.</p>

<p>"What I give is given," said Ali, gesturing magnificently. "I
will not vote."</p>

<p>Ramsden picked the necklace up and weighed it in his hand.</p>

<p>"This ought to be enough alone," he said. "It's worth
about&mdash;at least&mdash; "</p>

<p>"No! No! All or nothing!" Gauri screamed, and her eyes looked
nearly as infernal as the woman's in the temple had done. "See!
Look! The ear- studs&mdash;Kali emeralds!&mdash;none like them!"
Then her voice dropped. "I must wear those&mdash;all those," she
added, confidently, knowing her case was won. "The priestess'
insignia! Mine! Keep your <i>lakh</i> of rupees! I choose
these!"</p>

<p>They agreed, for they had to. Even Ali agreed to it. But his
wintry eyes met hers, and she breathed uneasily as she put her head
through the ugly golden necklace and the maid set the studs through
the holes in the lobes of her ears.</p>

<p>"Each emerald a fortune!" the maid whispered. But Ali heard
it.</p>

<p>"Aye, a fortune!" he said nodding. "Who should grudge a dowry to
the queen of cows?" Which was a Hindu compliment, intentional, so
understood and shuddered at. She knew the North, or rather the
freebooting blades who came thence.</p>

<p>"Wear them! Wear them! They become thee!" Ali urged her.</p>

<p>So, with the jewels on and her hair arranged in heavy coils, the
lady of delights&mdash;as Ali called her&mdash;looked not so unlike
the priestess. All she lacked was, as Chullunder Ghose assessed it,
"just a year or two of education."</p>

<p>The worst was that she thought a course of visiting from shrine
to shrine and making little offerings to gods and goddesses in
turn, along with favors to the priests, entitled her to know it
all. Of men she was a shrewd enough judge. She could weigh the
chance of wrath and pick a living in the trough of evil. But of
women&mdash;save such women as herself&mdash;she knew scarce
anything, and that distorted.</p>

<p>"Self, knowing women too well, can attempt conversion," said
Chullunder Ghose and set to work to try to teach her how a
priestess, used to the public eye and awe, would sit, and stand,
and move about, and be.</p>

<p>Time and again she flung herself to the floor in tantrums,
cursing the fat babu in the names of the whole Hindu Pantheon.
Repeatedly he coaxed her back to patience, helped by the maid, who
kept reciting what the emeralds were worth&mdash;pure
music!&mdash;music that had charms to soothe the Gauri's
breast.</p>

<p>"Even so they tell me chorus girls are taught to act as
duchesses!" said the babu. "Failing all else shall escape to London
and start academy of female manners! Watch me,
Gauri&mdash;beautiful Gauri&mdash;goddess among women, watch
me&mdash;walk like this!"</p>

<p>And in spite of stomach big enough for two men, hams that would
have graced a Yorkshire hog, and a costume not intended for
solemnities&mdash;his turban was pink&mdash;he walked across the
room with perfect grace&mdash;Falstaff playing Ophelia, surpassing
good.</p>

<p>She imitated him. He sighed.</p>

<p>"Thus, <i>sahiba</i> ." None had ever called her that. The title
is for wives of honest husbands, and she softened, even to the
brink of tears. "You are a queen&mdash;a goddess. All know it. That
is not enough, though. You, you the goddess, know it! You are not
afraid of what they think. You do not <i>want</i> them thus to
think. They <i>do</i> so think. You <i>know</i> they think. You are
a goddess! Now, Bride of the Mountains, walk across the room
again."</p>

<p>"Aye, Bride of the Mountains!" murmured Ali.</p>

<p>Chullunder Ghose had meant a pious compliment, for one of the
names of the Daughter of Himavat, the Bride of Siva, Him who sits
upon the peaks, is Gauri. But Ali misinterpreted, and Gauri
understood. The jewelry was hers; and she was Ali's&mdash;no
escape! She burst into tears again, beat on the floor with her
fists, had hysterics, and obliged the poor babu to start again at
the beginning.</p>

<p>Then the road! Old India by night in yellow smocks beneath an
amber moon, with an ox-cart following, in which the women
lay&mdash;a two-wheeled, painted cart with curtains, driven by the
green-lined <i>chela</i> and drawn by the same two splendid
Guzarati beasts well fed and rested in Ghandava's stable! The
ancient gate&mdash;the guard, too sleepy to make trouble, too
respectful to draw curtains, and aware of the weight of silver in
shut palms&mdash;then the wide way flowing on forever between
shadows so silent and drunk with color that the creaking of a wheel
alone recalled a solid world.</p>

<p>And Jeremy&mdash;drunker than the shadows were!
Full&mdash;flooded&mdash;flowing over with delight; the memory of
wild Arabia awake within him and a whole unknown horizon beckoning
in moonlight to adventure such as Sinbad knew! He danced. He sang
wild Arab songs&mdash;as suitable as any, since an unknown tongue
was all conditions called for. He flicked a long silk handkerchief
with imitative skill. And the few, afraid night-farers drew aside
to let the short procession pass.</p>

<p>Jeff Ramsden, striding like a Viking with a rod across his
shoulder, meant ostensibly for vicious dogs, a calf like Samson's
showing under the yellow smock, and an air of ownership. He owned
the earth he trod on. Good to see.</p>

<p>Then King and Grim together, yellow-smocked and striding just as
silently, more modern, more in keeping with the picture and
matched, as it were, in the setting by Chullunder Ghose, who walked
after them without enthusiasm, not needing to pretend, except to
creed; pink turban gone, he, too, was in orange-yellow.</p>

<p>Then Narayan Singh, in yellow like the rest, a little too
ostensibly unarmed. The hilt of something swinging as he strode was
exaggerated by the smock that covered it, and his shadow resembled
a monster's.</p>

<p>Then the cart. Then Ali and his two sons, not pleased with
playing Hindu, looking like dark spirits of the night whom men
might well avoid. Wayfarers beg rides in India even as in the West,
but none did that night. None stole a ride. And the multitude, who
make it their profession to extort alms by the ancient
processes&mdash;who watch the highways and by day or dark flock
forth like bugs to pester&mdash;not recognizing innocence,
desisted.</p>

<p>All one night they trudged the highway with the geometrical
designs of irrigation ditches glinting in the moonlight all about
them; and at dawn they were offered bed and board by a Brahman, who
called the green-lined <i>chela</i> "holy one." At one end of the
garden-compound, of which his house formed the front, was a long
shelter subdivided into stalls, in which he said it was his
privilege to acquire merit by entertaining pilgrims. He asked no
questions&mdash;only offered food and asked a blessing in
return&mdash;so there they slept on string-cots, three to a stall,
the women-folk remaining in the closed cart, angrily complaining of
the heat.</p>

<p>Then night again and another march, the women, too, on foot; for
they left the ox-cart with the Brahman&mdash;six or eight miles'
walk in mellow moonlight to a wayside station, where a Hindu
station-master said they honored his poor roof, and where, by dint
of lies along the wire, he finally secured a whole reserved
compartment for them on a through train for Benares.</p>

<p class="first">BENARES! Mother Gunga, who if she would, could
tell of the birth of half-a-world, lapping the steps below the
<i>ghats</i> . Crimson fire and leaping flame where they cremate
the dead. Moonlight on a hundred thousand heads and shoulders, as
the "heathen" stand breast-deep reflected in the stream and pray
for blessedness. Built on Benares! For the temples that have stood
a thousand years are crumbling above foundations that were ancient
cities before Hermes was Hierophant of Mysteries. Troy seven times
rebuilt on Troy is but a new thing to Benares.</p>

<p>The train rolled in, panting at the end of awful night; and it
was no more to Benares than a new bird added to the hordes of
feathered scavengers.</p>

<p>Under the hot iron roof the train disgorged its crowd, itself
impersonal, they seeking abstract bliss&mdash;an iron-age implement
subserving Manu and His laws. It was no more to Benares than the
flies that drone around the <i>ghats</i> at dawn.</p>

<p>The green-lined <i>chela</i> led, threading the swarm that
checked and gathered itself, bleating for its females and its young
like sheep, demanding neither food nor sleep but the view of Mother
Gunga and the privilege of plunging in at sunrise.</p>

<p>Gauri and her maid walked beside Chullunder Ghose, both
veiled.</p>

<p>"One sees us!" said the babu. "Let the veil fall open."</p>

<p>On the journey they had labored over it, cutting and stitching
until if loosed it fell so perfectly that her face could be seen in
profile&mdash;which was best&mdash;and be covered again instantly.
Gauri saw a man in yellow staring at her, and snatched the veil
together.</p>

<p>"He is big, and I am afraid of him!"</p>

<p>"Good," said the babu.</p>

<p>"But he saw I am afraid!"</p>

<p>"Better! He knows you are not a goddess! You <i>should</i> be
afraid of him! Now, not knowing, he will go and say he knows, same
being excellent in politics but no good when up against Jimgrim and
the green-lined <i>chela</i> &mdash;latter being devil very likely,
though I think not. Woman, behave fearfully! He turns again and
looks."</p>

<p>So Gauri hid behind Chullunder Ghose's bulk, as if she were a
merchant's wife out for the first time far from home. And the very
tall man who had turned and looked beckoned another, shorter,
nearly naked one, who came and followed the party, presently
beckoning others to keep him company.</p>

<p>So, though they threaded a score of streets not wider than an
ox-cart, turning this and that way almost incomprehensibly like
ants, and entered at last a high door in a wall, which slammed
behind them and was bolted and barred by someone in a cabin like a
sentry-box, who performed his task unseen, they knew they were not
lost to knowledge. They could hear the footsteps of the spies, who
ran to tell their whereabouts to whom it might concern.</p>

<p>And here&mdash;in a quiet clean oasis&mdash;the green-lined
<i>chela</i> seemed no longer in authority. He accepted orders from
a man in white, whose bald, bare head was fleshless&mdash;skin on
bone, as if it had died but still was needed by the body. Only his
eyes lived, burning, down deep in the sockets. It seemed he was
host.</p>

<p>"Introduce us. What's his name?" Grim asked.</p>

<p>"No name," the <i>chela</i> answered.</p>

<p>Only then they all remembered that the green-lined <i>chela</i>
, too, had given no name, then or at any time.</p>

<p>"What's yours?" Grim asked him, but he laughed and shook his
head.</p>

<p>So, failing introduction, Grim lined up the party, named them,
and began to speak about Ghandava. That name, too apparently meant
nothing here. The living skeleton in white took no account of it.
He turned on his heel and led them indoors, into an ancient palace,
nowadays as plainly furnished as a monastery, and up-stairs to the
first floor. There, saying nothing, he made a gesture, signifying
that the floor was theirs and, turning to the <i>chela</i> , who
had followed, dismissed him with a monosyllable. The <i>chela</i>
neither spoke nor displayed the least emotion, but turned and
went.</p>

<p>Nevertheless there was an atmosphere of comfort, and even of
friendliness. The man in white stood waiting by the door until
silent servants brought water and a heap of clean sheets. Others
brought food&mdash;bread, vegetables, milk&mdash;and then, but not
till then, the man in white left them, not having said one word
except to the <i>chela</i> to dismiss him, yet contriving to convey
the thought that they were welcome.</p>

<p>"And why not welcome?" wondered Jeremy. "Bemares looks to me to
need jazzing."</p>

<p>"My God!" Chullunder Ghose exploded.</p>

<p>All the long front of that floor was a veranda, cool and deep,
facing the Mother of Rivers above ancient roofs. They had five
separate vistas between temple domes, and down one lane of
ancientry could see the granite steps, and thousands of naked men,
and women veiled in lightest muslin, descending to bathe and pray;
for sunrise is the holiest hour of all.</p>

<p>Rafts on the river's bosom swarmed with Brahmins sitting rigid
in the act of meditation. Between the rafts the stream flowed
spread with flowers, because none of the thousands had come
empty-handed, but with garlands, loose blossoms and plaited strings
of buds by way of offering:</p>

<p>The cooing of doves was all about them, and the music of
temple-bells. The breath of Mother Gunga, who gives life and takes
it, pervaded all&mdash;miasmic say the scientists, ignoring truth
of a millennium. (They drink the water where the ashes of the dead
are strewn, and take no hurt.) Birds everywhere, especially crows
lining the ridges of temple roofs with jet black; and down the
granite steps to the river's brink, between the men's bare legs and
over the gaudy garments laid aside, monkeys scampering to drink,
unfearful and unnoticed.</p>

<p>"Good!" said Jeremy, sniffing and filling his lungs.</p>

<p>Along a street below them caste-less bearers were carrying the
dead on litters, to be bathed a last time at the river brink before
being laid out on their funeral pyres. None noticed. In Benares it
is life that counts, not death, and life is of the spirit not the
senses. When a pilgrim shuffles off his mortal coil they make away
with it and burn it swiftly, lest it hamper his efforts to climb
higher.</p>

<p>Down another vista lay the ruins of a temple like an island in
the stream; for centuries ago, when Gunga rose in spate, she
underswept the walls and rooted in among them till the whole
enormous building tumbled into the flood. Now a naked <i>fakir</i>
stood on the highest stone of its ruins&mdash;young, with long hair
on his shoulders&mdash;poised against the blue sky&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fancy free!" suggested Jeremy. "That lad looks happy. Nothing
to wear, nor do but stand still! How many meals a day, I
wonder?"</p>

<p>"One," said a voice; and there Ghandava stood, among them,
unannounced!</p>

<p>"I have creeps!" remarked Chullunder Ghose.</p>

<p>He glanced at the door. It was locked on the inside, but
Ghandava might have done that&mdash;only the lock squeaked badly,
and nobody had heard it.</p>

<p>"There are three of them. The three are one," Ghandava went on,
taking no notice of the babu's nervousness. "They stand on that
stone all day and all night, taking turns, relieving one
another."</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded Jeremy.</p>

<p>"It always was so," he answered. "But their vigil is nearly
ended."</p>

<p>Ghandava was bright-eyed; not from opium, that is a feverish
glow, but with the light of the ecstasy men earn, who by denying
self attain self-knowledge. Harder work than laying bricks!</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded Jeremy a second time.</p>

<p>"Seek, and to every question you shall know the answer, if you
seek well enough, my friend," Ghandava replied. "There are others
who seek answers," he added cryptically.</p>

<p>Whereat Chullunder Ghose recounted how a man in yellow had set
spies to follow them through the streets. Ghandava smiled.</p>

<p>"You are protected," he said quietly. "You shall decoy them to
another place."</p>

<p>"For that they may attack us in the other place?" Chullunder
Ghose asked in consternation.</p>

<p>"Because their time is come."</p>

<p>But Ali of Sikunderam grew angry at answers in the shape of
conundrums. The Hindu garb and his losses fretted him. He paced the
floor like a Hillman, which is a wholly different stride from any
Hindu's, and rounded on Ghandava at the end of a turn&mdash;head
and shoulders over him&mdash;his fingers on the hilt of something
underneath the smock.</p>

<p>"By Allah, I have paid already more than all these! Five sons I
have given!" he exclaimed. "Shall my life follow theirs without a
reason? Name thy intentions step by step, <i>Mahatma-ji</i> !"</p>

<p>He used the word Mahatma as soldiers of fortune of the Middle
Ages used the word monk&mdash;insultingly, and Ghandava, it seemed,
knew better than to smile at him. An air of patronage night have
been a spark to fire the tinder of the Hillman's wrath.</p>

<p>"Sit down then. I will tell you," said Ghandava, choosing a
stool for himself and pausing until all were seated on chairs and
mats.</p>

<p>He let it appear that Ali's protest was what moved him, and Ali
made sly grimaces at his sons to signify that they should learn a
lesson in deportment from their sire.</p>

<p>"Lo, we listen. By Allah, we have ears," said Ali at last
importantly.</p>

<p>"You were seen to arrive in Benares," Ghandava began, "because
the prisoner you let go from my house in Delhi forewarned those who
are interested. You were seen to have this woman with you, and they
are saying now that their priestess has wormed her way into your
confidence, as otherwise she would surely have escaped and returned
to them. Now, if one of you were to meet with one of them, and were
not afraid, and should confirm that theory, taking an actual
message perhaps from Gauri to them, using the formula, '<i>She
says</i> '&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not afraid!" Narayan Singh said, interrupting. He stood
up, and all who saw him knew he told the truth. He was afraid of
neither death nor devils.</p>

<p>Ghandava nodded.</p>

<p>"I spoke to you all of the Wheel," he said quietly. "The Wheel
turns and unless we are alert an opportunity is snatched or taken,
for us or against us. In a place, which you shall see, the Nine
have preserved for centuries a truth&mdash;knowledge of a truth,
that is; for truth is like skill, unless used constantly it
disappears. The time will cone, but is not yet, when that truth may
be given to the world with safety. Those in whose hands the ancient
secrets are, being human, have made mistakes. Knowledge in the
hands of criminals and fools is worse than ignorance. Let me
illustrate:</p>

<p>"You have heard of the scientist who, seeking without wisdom for
the knowledge he could neither weigh nor measure, introduced into
America a moth that killed the trees? So. Once, when they who keep
the secrets thought the time had come, they entrusted to some
chosen individuals instruction concerning the scope of man's mind.
But the time was not ripe. They who learned were faithless and
self-seeking, so that from that one secret that escaped there
sprang the whole evil of witchcraft, sorcery, necromancy, black
magic, hypnotism, what is now called 'mob psychology,' the black
art of propoganda, and inventions that are even worse.</p>

<p>"Again: Surgeons and doctors know no more anatomy than a
mechanic knows of alchemy. They who keep the secrets once taught
certain men the rudiments of what was common knowledge long before
Aesculapius. Those, though, turned the knowledge to their own
account, so that it died again of selfishness&mdash;which is
all-destroying; and all that remains of the art, that it was sought
to heal the world with, is the trick by which practitioners of
Thuggee kill their victims with a silken handkerchief!</p>

<p>"Chemical dyes mean poison gas. The art of flying, which was
understood in India ten thousand years ago, means bombing of
defenseless cities. Alcohol means drunkenness. Morphia, which is an
anodyne, means vice. Only very rarely do the men appear in whose
hands knowledge may be trusted. Then, and not until then, the world
goes forward.</p>

<p>"But those who seek knowledge for selfish ends persist. In that
way they are faithful! They seek it like prospectors&mdash;at times
alone, at times in hordes. And because of the Wheel and the Law, as
men unearth gold so these lawless seekers after knowledge draw near
at times to the discovery. They <i>would</i> discover. They
<i>would</i> possess themselves of secrets and destroy the world,
unless they who keep the secrets were alert.</p>

<p>"Through alertness it is possible to see that they destroy
themselves, as the hosts of Korah, Dathan and Abiram did in your
Bible days&mdash;as Babylon destroyed itself, from too much
wealth&mdash;as he who discovered gunpowder destroyed himself; only
swiftly, and secretly, lest the world learn too much and inquire
for more.</p>

<p>"The lawless Nines who hide under the mask of Kali-worship, by
elimination and persistence have come near to discovering the place
where the secret of gold is kept. The place must be
changed&mdash;nay <i>is</i> changed; but lest they learn that, they
shall be allowed to find the former place and to take the
consequences. It is there that the Wheel turns and <i>you</i> enter
in."</p>

<p>"How so?" demanded Ali truculently; but none took any notice of
him, which seemed to set him thinking on his own account. He
listened attentively, but with a changed expression, while Ghandava
went on with his story.</p>

<p>Suddenly Chullunder Ghose threw up his hands in
consternation.</p>

<p>"Holy one!" he exclaimed. "Emolument is more than pleasing, same
is necessary on this plane on which we function! Is profit barred?
Is all excluded but the risk? Myself am text-book of scientific
ignorance and not proud, but&mdash;family and
dependents&mdash;impoverished babu&mdash;<i>verb. sap.</i> , Most
Holy One!"</p>

<p>Ghandava chuckled.</p>

<p>"You shall see, and may help yourself," he answered.</p>

<p>"When shall I go with my message to these people?" Narayan Singh
asked, standing up again.</p>

<p>Ramsden rose, too, stretching himself, nearly as tall as the
Sikh and half-again as heavy&mdash;a man to count on in tight
places.</p>

<p>"I'll go with you," he said quietly, meeting the Sikh's
eyes.</p>

<p>Narayan Singh bowed, smiling a little. It was just the smallest
inclination of the head, but a whole song set to music could never
have answered half as much. He said no word. They understood each
other.</p>

<p>"When shall we go?" asked Ramsden.</p>

<p>"When you have seen," Ghandava answered. "You must see; and
every word you subsequently say to them the woman must say first to
you. It is essential that these criminals destroy themselves. All
you are asked to do is to make that simple for them!"</p>

<p>They ate breakfast all together on the deep veranda, Gauri and
her maid as anxious as Chullunder Ghose about the rules of caste
they broke, yet none of the three willing to pose as holier than
Ghandava, who ate with them and had been a "heaven-born" until he
abandoned caste altogether. Gauri consoled herself with the sight
of the plundered emeralds.</p>

<p>"I shall have enough to pay the priests," she said aloud, as if
answering the voice of conscience.</p>

<p>She did not see Ali's flint eyes blazing, nor the sly, secretive
acquiescence of his sons; nor did she know why, when the meal was
done, the sons threw dice on the veranda floor. No money passed
between them, but they threw three times, watching each main
breathlessly, and he who lost swore acridly in the name of
Allah.</p>

<p>Ghandava watched it all but made no comment, unless, about five
minutes later as he faced the Ganges, an adaptation of two of the
Apostle Paul's most wholesome axioms that he let fall had bearing
on Ali's attitude:</p>

<p>"Since all things work together for our good, and now is the
appointed time, why not? Shall we be going?"</p>

<p>He did not say where they were going. They followed curiously,
both women keeping close to him and Ali bringing up the rear with
his two sons. It was as plain as clay that the North was in the
mood of those old Highlanders who followed Prince Charlie once as
far as Preston Pans. The rear, where they can do least
demoralizing, is the right place for those gentry.</p>

<p>Ghandava led up-stairs&mdash;the last way anyone
expected&mdash;out on to a roof, and up by a winding flight of
steps that circled about a tower, with a stone curtain on their
right that rendered them invisible from anywhere unless so distant
that their heads would be unrecognizable. And then
down&mdash;through a door at the summit of the tower&mdash;round
and round a circular stairway in the tower's core, with ample air
to breathe, but in darkness so deep that Ghandava's reassuring
voice seemed to come from another world:</p>

<p>"This way! This way!"</p>

<p>And the echoes rumbled down into infinity like the voice of an
underground stream. Ghandava's spirits seemed to rise as they
descended.</p>

<p>Both women screamed at intervals, but there was always somebody
for them to cling to, and the voice of Ali behind them proving his
own fearlessness&mdash;to himself at least&mdash;by lecturing his
sons.</p>

<p>"A man is a man in the dark! A man is a man in the devil's face!
A man dies fighting, and Allah receives him into Paradise! Fear is
a fool's religion, sons of Ali!"</p>

<p>"Aye, and the world is full of fools!" Chullunder Ghose
confessed. "Self being one! Are there snakes?"</p>

<p>"No snakes!" Ghandava answered.</p>

<p>"Insects?"</p>

<p>"None!"</p>

<p>"Lost souls?"</p>

<p>"No. They would find no rest here!"</p>

<p>"We are going down&mdash;down!" The babu's voice boomed hollow.
"We are surely in Gunga's womb!"</p>

<p>"Not yet!"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;, where are we then? I hear the rushing of
waters!"</p>

<p>"Only air&mdash;good air," Ghandava called back.</p>

<p>"I hear water boiling!"</p>

<p>"No, for there is none."</p>

<p>The babu's trepidation served to keep the women from hysterics,
since he voiced another fear than theirs and the two disputed
mastery instead of blending into panic and hysteria. Guided by
Ghandava's voice and the feel of cool, smooth masonry now on one
hand, now the other, they hurried in single file along a tunnel
whose floor felt polished under-foot as if a hundred generations
has passed over it.</p>

<p>"No bats!" Chullunder Ghose complained. "So there must be
devils!"</p>

<p>"No, no devils," said Ghandava.</p>

<p>"Krishna! What then? Look! See! I am blind! I saw another world!
I cannot see! I am blinded! I swim in fire! Why do I not burn?"</p>

<p>They stopped. They had all seen one flash, and then nothing but
its aching image in the retina&mdash;light to which a blow-pipe
flame would have been gloaming!</p>

<p>"Watch! Wait!" called Ghandava.</p>

<p>"Not again! Not again!" cried the babu, and his cry re-echoed in
imprisoned space&mdash;"Again, again, again, again, again!" Then
the light&mdash;three flashes.</p>

<p>"God!"</p>

<p>That was King, clapping both hands to eyes that had been
overstrained on active service.</p>

<p>"Allah! I saw devils!" (That was Ali.)</p>

<p>"Holy One, where are we?" (That was the babu.)</p>

<p>"Under the bed of Ganges!"</p>

<p>"The fire? Is it Agni?*"</p>

<p>[* The Spirit of Fire.]</p>

<p>"Electricity!" said Ramsden, speaking from memory of fuses blown
out in the wilderness.</p>

<p>"No." Ghandava was about to explain, but three more blinding
flashes interrupted.</p>

<p>"What then?" asked Ramsden, positive, from memory.</p>

<p>"Gold!" fell the answer on breathless silence, in which they
could all hear Ali and his two sons loosening their Khyber
knives.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch20" name="ch20">CHAPTER XX</a><br>
"Nevertheless, I will take my sword with me!"</h2>

<p class="first">A PALE-GREEN astral-looking light developed
gradually, turning the heart of darkness into twilight. They
discerned the shadowy outlines of a cave buttressed with titanic
masonry. There were no images, no carvings on walls, nor anything
to mar simplicity. The proportions expressed restful, pure and
final peace.</p>

<p>There was no smell of dampness, although Ghandava said they were
under the bed of Ganges. There were no bats, no filth, no
occupants. There was nothing in there&mdash;in an acre of earth's
foundations&mdash;but one square altar set against a wall; and
thence the light came, seemingly.</p>

<p>Ghandava led to the altar with no more outward reverence than
the vergers use who show the crowds around cathedrals. It was of
some green substance so like jade to the eye that Ramsden,
advancing an incautious finger, touched it. He drew it back with an
oath.</p>

<p>"Pardon! I should have warned you. Are you hurt?" Ghandava
examined Jeff's finger. "It burns like radium."</p>

<p>"Oh, buncombe!" said Jeremy, breaking an hour's silence. "I've
carried gold in my belt for years. My belly hasn't got a mark on
it!"</p>

<p>Everyone laughed, even Ali, and the women who knew no English.
But Ghandava continued as much at ease as if he stood before a
blackboard.</p>

<p>"You see?" he said, and pointed to where the wall arched over
the altar in the shape of a shovel, base to the ground, with the
apex leaning out above the center of the green stone. Exactly in
the middle of the arch emerged what might have been a pipe of some
unrecognizable substance, and for a space of two or three feet
around it the stone wall seemed to have the consistency of pumice,
as if its life had been burned out.</p>

<p>"Hot gold drips from that opening, drops on the stone below, and
dissipates into electrons!"</p>

<p>"Hell!" said Jeremy.</p>

<p>"Men could raise hell with it, couldn't they!" Ghandava
answered. "There is more force in one drop than in a box of
dynamite&mdash;more in a ton of it than in Vesuvius!"</p>

<p>"Who tends it?" asked Jeremy.</p>

<p>"Those whose turn it is," Ghandava answered. "They are beyond
that wall."</p>

<p>"Where is the store of gold?" demanded Ali hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Gone! Removed!"</p>

<p>"There can never have been much gold, or who could have moved it
in haste?" the Hillman sneered, nudging his two sons.</p>

<p>"Never more than enough at one time in this place than to keep
the drops dripping," Ghandava answered. "It has been dripping since
long before Atlantis disappeared. Calculate it! There is enough in
store to continue the process for as long again. But it must
continue elsewhere. We must find another way of purging Gunga."</p>

<p>"Riddles! Forever riddles!" Ali grumbled. "Who believes a word
of all this? Allah&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ghandava interrupted him:</p>

<p>"Have you ever thought how many thousands bathe in Gunga daily?
How many dead, who died of sickness, are laid on the banks for the
stream to wash them? How many drink as they stand waist-deep in
Gunga? And how few die?"</p>

<p>"They say it's the sunlight," King objected. "I've read that
germs of sickness can't live in Ganges water because of the strong
sun."</p>

<p>"And you believe it?" asked Ghandava. "If so, why does the sun
not kill germs in the Amazon, or the Congo River, or the Jumna or
the Irrawaddy?"</p>

<p>"Damned if I know!" said Grim. "Go on, Ghandava. Tell."</p>

<p>"Billions of people have drunk Ganges water, since the
pilgrimages began so long ago that there is no record of them. None
ever died of drinking it. They have come with cholera, and plague,
and small-pox. For lack of fuel for the pyres they have thrown
their dead unburned into the stream. And beside the dead they have
drunk the Ganges water, taking no harm. That is because of
this."</p>

<p>He signified the altar-stone and paused:</p>

<p>"Gold is the greatest purifying agent in the universe. In the
words of the Hermetic Mystery: 'AS ABOVE, SO BELOW.' Gold is thus
also the root of every evil. Gold, resolved into electrons, is the
greatest force available to men. It is also by the same law men's
greatest weakness. Released it could abolish labor, lack, necessity
for digging coal&mdash;or it could obliterate! There is gold enough
in the world to usher in the golden age, or to wipe out
civilization!"</p>

<p>He paused again dramatically, then added:</p>

<p>"Nine men know the secret!"</p>

<p>"The devil they do!" said Jeremy.</p>

<p>"Many have sought for the secret until a few of them know nearly
where to look. A week&mdash;a month&mdash;a year and they would
find this place. It is wisdom to let them find it now. So say those
who have commissioned me."</p>

<p>"By Allah, I weary of words!" shouted Ali, all his patience
vanishing into its elements as gold had done. His voice
reverberated overhead. "Show me as much gold as I can bear away, I
and my sons, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>In the dim green light he met Narayan Singh's eyes&mdash;could
not avoid them. The big Sikh leaned and shoved a shoulder under his
chin, shoving him backward so that he could use his right eye only
with difficulty; and his sons could not have helped their sire
without first passing King and Grim, with Ramsden on King's
left-hand and Grim against the wall.</p>

<p>"Friend Ali, peace, I pray thee!" said the Sikh.</p>

<p>There was no alternative. The hilt of something underneath the
Sikh's long smock made that fact clear.</p>

<p>Ghandava looked up at the spout above the green altar,
listening. He said nothing, but started to walk away, and they
followed in a frightened group, the women hurrying past him and the
men, especially Ali, trying to disguise fear by striding
measuredly. Chullunder Ghose gave up that effort.</p>

<p>"Lo! I claim merit! My share of the gold is a gift to Mother
Gunga!" he blustered, struggling to the last to make a joke of it,
and ran. Shoving the women in front of him he disappeared into the
dark and they could hear his heavy footsteps stampeding until the
echoing noise was swallowed in a tunnel-gurgle sounding like a
laugh.</p>

<p>"The gold is uncontrollable when it begins to drip," Ghandava
explained. "The process can be started but not stopped. It has been
so for a hundred centuries. Not even they who keep the secrets
could exist inside the cavern when the drops fall."</p>

<p>As they left the cave a blinding flash burst behind them,
casting their shadows forward into the tunnel like the fragments of
shelled infantry. Even so, facing away from it, their eyes were
hurt. Intellect itself seemed stupefied, and was restored by a
breath of indrawn air that reeked of hot Benares, all decaying
flowers, humanity and grease.</p>

<p>"It ventilates the tunnel," said Ghandava. "That air, drawn in,
will be burned up in the next explosion."</p>

<p>"Where does the product go?" Grim asked him.</p>

<p>"It is used."</p>

<p>"Why doesn't the explosion burst the cave?"</p>

<p>"It would, but the quantity is measured."</p>

<p>That was all they could extract from hint by way of information.
When they asked more questions he reminded them that these were
ancient secrets and himself no more than a man commissioned for a
task.</p>

<p>"Already you have seen more than uninitiated individuals ever
saw <i>and lived to tell about</i> ," he assured them. "And this is
only one of very many wonders that are done with gold. This is only
a trifling matter compared to what can be&mdash;what <i>is</i>
&mdash;done daily."</p>

<p>"Then you are an initiate?" asked Grim. But he did not answer
that.</p>

<p>Another flash behind them that sent tattered shadows leaping
into the dark ahead showed an opening in the right-hand wall, set
at such an angle and so narrow that they had passed it on their way
down without being aware of its existence. Ghandava led through it
now, ignoring the babu and the women, who by then were ascending
the circular stair in the panic that will yield to nothing less
than daylight.</p>

<p>"You shall see, because you must say you have seen," he
explained, taking Ramsden and Narayan Singh each by the arm, as the
passage widened and turned back nearly in the same direction they
had just cone. Evidently they had only made a circuit to pass
through the end wall of the cave. "Say nothing that is not true,
even to the enemy!" he added.</p>

<p>And now it felt like entering the workshop where the gloaming is
woven of green and golden ether. They approached a cavern&mdash;not
too close, for he restrained them&mdash;in which three men watched
as if attending looms, only that these looms were invisible and the
shuttles resembled fish that darted to and fro forever on the sane
course, each swallowing the other as they met. The pale green light
resembled water&mdash;the men, great hooded seals&mdash;and the
silence finished the illusion, so that the ears strained for a
sound of waves on some imaginary beach.</p>

<p>But there was no sound&mdash;not even a foot-fall; and of gold
they saw no more than one bar that a man in a hood brought down
steps from a gallery hewn overhead. Even the steps resembled
submarine rocks, and the whole illusion was so perfect that they
caught themselves not breathing, and wondering how long they could
stay submerged.</p>

<p>When Grim started to speak Ghandava held a hand up and
restrained him. Silence, it seemed, was part of the twilight
mystery. There was no heat, it was cooler there than in the other
cave; no light but the dim opalescence in which shuttles made of
other light swam. Nothing to understand. It stripped
incomprehension naked and left it aware of itself.</p>

<p>"Come!" said Ghandava. "You have seen a workshop older than
Benares! You have seen enough!"</p>

<p>Ali had seen enough to stir cupidity, and it controlled him. He
brushed by with his hand on his knife-hilt and was for plunging
into the cavern with his left arm hiding his face. The illusion of
green water was too real to be faced without subconscious
precaution of some sort. He walked forward with the sidewise
pendulum motion of one who wades into the surf&mdash;threw up both
hands suddenly&mdash;turned&mdash;and came hurrying back with eyes
and tongue protruding. "No air!" he gasped.</p>

<p>But something else had terrified him&mdash;something he could
not, and never tried to explain. Followed by his two sons he took
to his heels, pursuing Chullunder Ghose and the women up toward
daylight; and was first out on the summit of the tower with a view
of all Benares, in spite of the others' long start, thanks to the
legs and the wind of a mountaineer.</p>

<p>"Behold, who would worship Allah?" asked Narayan Singh; and
there being no more Moslems there, none answered.</p>

<p>Slowly, with Ghandava in the lead, they returned by the tunnel
and the steps within the tower, none saying much because of
breathlessness, nor any climbing better than Ghandava, much the
eldest, who waited at least a dozen times for them to overtake him.
Up near the summit of the tower he opened a door that admitted to a
gallery with a pierced stone screen around it; and there in full
sunlight, with eyes aching, and with the sound of Ali's voice
arguing above, they squatted down facing the Ganges to learn what
more Ghandava had in store for them. He sat meditating for ten
minutes before he spoke. Then:</p>

<p>"Only Truth persists. All <i>things</i> are relative, and pass
when they have seen their day. Truth is and all phenomena are
Maya.* It is nothing, then, that what you have just seen must
vanish. Benares has vanished ten times. The river below you has
swallowed city on top of city, and the cavern we were in lies under
the foundations of a temple whose steps the Ganges laved long
before Egypt grew beside the Nile. This was the Temple of the
Mysteries before the Pyramids were built. And now it perishes. But
Truth remains."</p>

<p>[* Delusion.]</p>

<p>"Were the men we saw below there any of the Nine Unknown?"
demanded Ramsden.</p>

<p>"None of them," Ghandava answered, looking him full in the face.
"The men you saw are <i>chelas</i> . You will never see the Nine
Unknown."</p>

<p>He was growing restless, for Ghandava. There was still the air
of contact with eternity that made him so courteous and earned
respect for him without his claiming it. But there was a subtle
change, nevertheless, though he waited to speak again until he had
their absolute attention. Then:</p>

<p>"The appointed time is now. I will instruct Mr. Jeremy and those
who are to work with him. Are you two ready?"</p>

<p>Ramsden and Narayan Singh met each other's eyes and nodded
gravely.</p>

<p>"There is a <i>chela</i> below, who will lead you to the place
where the Kali-worshipers make ready. He will leave you there.
Gauri, in a minute, taking words from my mouth, will give you a
message to deliver. They will believe the message, but will keep
you with them unless they are more mad than there is reason to
believe. There are grades of madness. Theirs is familiar, and
understood. All then that will remain for you to do will be to
persuade them to watch Mr. Jeremy, and to follow him to the woman.
You will be cared for. Play your parts, tell only truth, say no
more than you must, and remember you are rendering a service to
humanity."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I will take my sword with me," announced Narayan
Singh.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch21" name="ch21">CHAPTER XXI</a><br>
"My house is clean again!"</h2>

<p class="first">IT was noon when Narayan Singh and Ramsden,
following a <i>chela</i> fifty years of age, chose what shadows
were available in streets that baked like ovens between the
stifling walls. The <i>chela</i> led them past an opening in a
carved wall and gave the agreed signal, passing on as if
unconscious of them. They turned and walked boldly into a ruinous
temple, whose floor was deep with the dung of sacred bulls and
whose only light was from little oil-dishes swung by wires from a
roof invisible in gloom.</p>

<p>As the eyes grew used to the dark they were aware of the big
bronze man in yellow who had been their prisoner, standing with his
back to an inner-door with arms folded over his breast. They could
see the white teeth glistening between thick lips, and the whites
of his eyes with a glow behind them.</p>

<p>He in no way resembled a spider, yet Jeff thought of him as one.
Imagination painted in the web. He looked as if he expected them
and, saying nothing, beckoned, with his other hand behind him on
the handle of the wooden door. When they were near enough he threw
the door open and stood aside to let them pass in.</p>

<p>Jeff led the way with the nerves of his neck all tingling in
expectation of a silken handkerchief from ambush. The only thought
in his head just then was whether his neck-muscles might not be
strong enough to resist the handkerchief for the necessary fraction
of a second until his fists could come in play. Imagination! For in
step behind him strode the Sikh, who, if nothing more, would have
given the alarm in time.</p>

<p>They were in a round room lighted by kerosene lanterns and scant
rays filtered through old sacking stretched across openings in the
gloom overhead. The walls were the base of a dome, whose arch was
dimly visible, and around the walls not less than seventy men in
yellow sat facing the center, where a plain stone platform a yard
high stood in the midst of pillars that rose up in the form of a
pentagon into the dark&mdash;a pillar to the apex of each
angle.</p>

<p>They wore no masks, but the faces of all alike were stamped with
evil and it would have been next to impossible to memorize the
varying features. Proud, confident, deliberate crime was the
key-note according unity, and it might have been four-score
reflections of one face for all that a man could remember
otherwise. The enormous bronze man leered at Jeff, thrusting his
face so close that it was all that Jeff could do to refrain from
punching him again; but all he did was to lead Jeff and Narayan
Singh to the platform, where he left them to face whichever way
they chose.</p>

<p>"You may sit down!" said a voice in English.</p>

<p>But they continued standing. To have sat or squatted would have
betrayed the long sword under the Sikh's smock&mdash;their only
weapon. Jeff had left his automatic behind on Ghandava's advice,
since&mdash;as Ghandava phrased it&mdash;"it is easier not to kill
when the means are absent. He who interferes with no man's
<i>karma</i> is wisest."</p>

<p>They turned around, peering through the pillars to discover from
which face the voice had come. He who had spoken waited until they
both faced him, then spoke again&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where is SHE?"</p>

<p>He was a little man&mdash;the smallest in the room, and his
voice was as tiny and mean as his English accent was ludicrous,
stressing each syllable, querulous, excited, full of a kind of
schoolmaster authority.</p>

<p>"<i>She</i> sent us," Jeff answered, and there was silence for
the space of half a minute while they all considered the reply.
Then:</p>

<p>"That may be so," a voice said from across the room. "How else
should they know this place?"</p>

<p>"Why did <i>she</i> send you?" asked the little man.</p>

<p>He appeared to be in haste for information. Jeff obliged
him.</p>

<p>"<i>She</i> said to me and to this other man: 'Obey me, and be
rewarded. Tell those whom you will find in the place I name to
follow you to where a <i>fakir</i> in the robe of Kali is
performing feats. Follow the <i>fakir</i> to wherever <i>he</i>
goes. <i>He</i> will lead to the place of the secrets you two men
have seen.'"</p>

<p>"You have seen? What have you seen? They say they have
seen!"</p>

<p>He translated the information into another tongue, and there was
a chorus of exclamations. Then the little man said again&mdash;</p>

<p>"What have you seen?"</p>

<p>Jeff told him: "We saw the gold turn liquid and drop on the
green anvil. We saw it turn to blinding light with a great
explosion. We saw the place behind the wall, where the secret is
and the men prepare it. But we only saw one bar of gold."</p>

<p>"Bah! Bah! Who cares for the bars of gold if we have the secret!
Where is this place?"</p>

<p>"The gold-light blinded us," Jeff answered. "We were led. But
the <i>fakir</i> knows the way."</p>

<p>"How should <i>he</i> know?"</p>

<p>"He can make the dead talk," Jeff answered with perfect
irrelevance, and there was another pause while they considered
that.</p>

<p>Narayan Singh nudged Jeff. A man who had risen from the wall was
walking toward them. He came close and looked into their faces, all
unconscious of the sword that trembled on the Sikh's thigh. They
recognized their first prisoner whom Grim had let go. Without a
word he returned to his place by the wall and then, standing:</p>

<p>"That is so," he said. "These are the same men. Their
<i>fakir</i> makes the dead speak, having stolen that secret from
the Nine or learned it from the books of Cyprian. One of them slew
Kansa, our leader in Delhi, and they brought the corpse a distance
in the cart with me. In the presence of all who were in the cart,
Kansa spoke to me, being dead, bidding me obey these people."</p>

<p>He sat down. His speech, too, was received in silence.</p>

<p>"Why does <i>she</i> not come to <i>us</i> ?" asked the man with
the squeaky voice at last. And Jeff, primed an hour before by Gauri
picking words from Ghandava's lips, was ready with the answer:</p>

<p>"She said if we would help her, we may become as you, members of
your order, sharing in all things. So we help. It was <i>she</i>
who went before us into the place where gold becomes light. She
said she will be there waiting, only we must come soon."</p>

<p>"What sign did she give?" the big, bronze man demanded with a
sneer.</p>

<p>And for answer to that Jeff threw into the lap of the little man
with the squeaky voice a golden skull twisted from the end of a
necklace that morning in spite of Gauri's protests. The little man
considered it a minute. Then:</p>

<p>"This is trite," he said at last. "<i>She</i> would not have
told the secret signs. See, all of you!"</p>

<p>And he sent the gold skull passing around the circle from hand
to hand, until it returned to his again.</p>

<p>It was as clear as twice two, even to Jeff's ponderous
intellect, that these men were not being taken by surprise. Someone
had been there already&mdash;someone at Ghandava's instigation
probably&mdash;warning what they could expect. They were like men
strained to the start of a race, so keyed up by expectation that
caution was irksome and at most perfunctory.</p>

<p>However, there followed a debate, because some maintained that
one of the messengers ought to be kept prisoner while individuals
should be sent with the other to investigate the <i>fakir</i> and
report. The majority were for obeying the summons immediately. They
said She was a seeress and they said other things about her, that
would not look well between the covers of a book, but that
explained a great deal of their ritual and superstition. And at
last the prisoner whom Ali had kept without water got tip on his
feet.</p>

<p>Jeff broke into a sweat, and Narayan Singh drew in breath
sharply between his teeth, for on this man's temper&mdash;so
Ghandava said&mdash;more depended than was good to contemplate.</p>

<p>But it seemed he was not so revengeful against Ali as to offset
that against success: he spoke fluently in a tongue that not even
Narayan Singh knew, apparently urging them to obey the summons and
make haste&mdash;touching his own breast, as a man might who argues
that his judgment of a situation was more trustworthy than others.
They appeared to yield. Then the big bronze man who had acted
janitor raised another point.</p>

<p>He, too, used the secret language but his argument was plain
enough. He demanded that Jeff and Narayan Singh be tied and put in
his charge. That was agreed to. He had copper-wire in his hand in
readiness to tie their wrists together, but the other man who had
been prisoner forestalled him with thick twine. He refused to tie
their bands behind their backs, as the other wanted to, arguing
that that would attract attention passing through the streets, but
lashed Jeff's right wrist to Narayan Singh's left. Then someone
gave them a basket to carry between them with a cloth thrown over
it so that their wrists were hidden.</p>

<p>There was no more said. The man who had tied them lost apparent
interest and mingled with the others. The big bronze man leered
threateningly in Jeff's face and pointed toward the door, following
about one stride behind with the evident intention of killing at
the first suspicion of trickery, and the others filed out one by
one in solemn procession led by the smallest man of all, who had
spoken first.</p>

<p>Seventy men in single file, headed by two stalwarts carrying a
basket between them, would arouse comment anywhere but in Benares.
There, there are fifty more astonishing processions on almost any
day of the year, and all are so absorbed about the business of
their own escape from <i>Maya</i> that none disturbs himself about
the other man's affairs. They were not even noticed. If one thing
about them were remarkable it was that they excited no remarks,
despite the yellow smocks and the caste-mark of their dreadful
goddess; and when they filed through a gate into a temple-yard and
vanished they passed from the mind of the crowd as well.</p>

<p>It was a yard like any of a hundred in that city of clustered
shrines. Four walls, carved deep with the forgotten stories of a
thousand gods, enclosed an oblong space paved with heavy blocks in
front of a temple whose every inch was carved in high
relief&mdash;and all so black with age and dirt that none might
read what legend it embodied. It was hidden lore, as safe from
public knowledge as the books whose ashes lay in Cyprian's kiln, or
as the Mysteries of the Nine themselves.</p>

<p>But on the temple steps in front of the portico a part was being
enacted that anyone might interpret how he chose.</p>

<p>A <i>fakir</i> smeared with ashes, and as nearly naked as the
law permits, with more meat on his well-ribbed frame than the
ordinary run of <i>fakirs</i> boast, was doing tricks with three
skulls before a spell-bound gathering of nondescripts. It was
amusing stuff, and the effect on the audience was like champagne,
laughter being ten times welcome in a place where all else is so
serious as in Benares.</p>

<p>For a while he would keep the three skulls circling in the air
in the way that any common juggler can contrive; but then, with
both arms suddenly extended to their limit, he would cause the game
to cease and the skulls came to a dead rest facing the audience,
one on the palm of each extended hand and the third on his plain
black turban.</p>

<p>Then each skull talked to each, or tossed amusing scraps of
wisdom to the audience.</p>

<p>It was perfect foolery, so masterfully done that folly seemed no
part of it. To an audience asking only to believe, and dreading
more than anything to criticize, it was
inspired&mdash;miraculous&mdash;in keeping with the
place&mdash;undoubtedly contrived by unseen Powers.</p>

<p>The advent of the seventy in yellow, with two stalwarts bearing
a basket at their head, was so plainly a religious portent that the
audience, already enraptured, now gave double credence&mdash;a
condition that reverted on the seventy, causing them, if not to
believe in the <i>fakir's</i> occult powers, at least to credit his
authority.</p>

<p>The <i>fakir</i> set the jawless skulls again in motion and the
seventy sat down to see. Then a fat man with a naked stomach, his
sanctity expressed by ashes, and a pink silk turban crowning all,
came and sat in front of the <i>fakir</i> , below him on the paving
stones, facing both him and the audience. And while the three
skulls bobbed and circled in air the fat man spoke in Hindustance,
which was the only language likely to be understood by more than a
handful of any Benares audience.</p>

<p>"Hear what <i>she</i> says!" he whined in a nasal singsong. "Who
is <i>she</i> ? Let any ask who dares! Where is <i>she</i> ? Let
him tell, who can find her! What says <i>she</i> ? The skulls will
tell! Now listen!"</p>

<p>They ceased from circling in air and rested as before on the
<i>fakir's</i> head and his extended hands. The <i>fakir's</i>
ashen face was motionless, and no breath seemed to come and go now
through his slightly-parted lips. Only his head jerked suddenly
from side to side from one skull to the other, so that all eyes
followed his. He appeared to be wondering as much as they did at
the dead things' hollow voices.</p>

<p>Hollow they were&mdash;maybe to cover mispronunciation and
croaking, as may be forgiven dead things. And as each one spoke, it
moved, not much, but enough to suggest an unseen lower
jaw&mdash;although if the <i>fakir's</i> hands moved too no one
observed it. Not even his head seemed to nod, to account for the
movement of the skull that rested on it. The <i>fakir</i> said
never a word.</p>

<p>"I am the skull of Akbar!" said the left-hand skull.</p>

<p>"I am the skull of Iskander!" replied the right-hand one.</p>

<p>"And ye were two fools!" croaked the upper, all eyes watching it
as the <i>fakir</i> turned his upward.</p>

<p>"I had gold in my day!" announced the Akbar skull.</p>

<p>"I had more! I had more!" the thing that named itself Iskander
answered. And the audience thrilled. They were Hindus. Neither of
those famous kings had been of their faith.</p>

<p>"Where is the gold now?" croaked the upper skull. "I buried
mine!" said Akbar.</p>

<p>"I buried mine!" Iskander answered.</p>

<p>"Where?" demanded the skull on top.</p>

<p>"I forget!" said the right-hand skull.</p>

<p>"I lost the secret!" said the one on the left.</p>

<p>"I keep the secret!" croaked the upper one.</p>

<p>"Who art thou?" asked the Akbar skull.</p>

<p>"I am a woman in a leopard-skin! I am <i>she</i> who knows the
secret! They who have the right should follow me!"</p>

<p>"Yes! Whoever is not afraid of the spirits that guard the
secret, follow!" piped the fat man; and the greater part of the
audience trembled, glancing sidewise at one another and remaining
seated. They were no such fools as to trespass into ancient
secrets. Some began to run away, fearing sorcery.</p>

<p>Tossing the skulls from hand to hand the <i>fakir</i>
disappeared into the temple. The courtyard emptied. The men in
yellow, led by Jeff and Narayan Singh carrying the basket, followed
the <i>fakir</i> one by one. Another of India's every-day marvels
was a thing gone by, to be discussed and magnified and finally
forgotten or else woven into the fabric of religious legend.</p>

<p>Jeff and Narayan Singh walked swiftly. They wanted to speak, but
did not dare, for they could not outdistance the bronze man at
their heels; and the others came equally fast, breaking into a run
as the <i>fakir</i> disappeared down an opening in the
hollow-shaped floor of a dark chamber.</p>

<p>The <i>fakir</i> was all alone, and seemed in haste. (No sign of
the fat impresario.) In darkness they could hear the <i>fakir's</i>
naked feet shuffling along an echoing tunnel, and the big bronze
man urged Jeff and Narayan Singh to run. Jeff kicked something, and
a hollow rattle announced a skull bouncing away in the dark ahead
of him. The bronze giant's toes struck another one, and a man
somewhere behind them kicked the third. The <i>fakir</i> had
abandoned his dead oracles! He appeared to be in full flight.</p>

<p>That was too much for the giant. He thrust Narayan Singh aside
and rushed by, following by ear, bellowing back to the crowd to
hurry after him. And as the first half-dozen forced themselves
between Narayan Singh and the right-hand wall the blade of a knife
passed between his wrist and Ramsden's. The thongs that held them
together parted, and a voice said:</p>

<p>"Wisely, <i>sahibs</i> ! Hold the basket as before!"</p>

<p>They turned to look, but could not see. The tunnel was alive
with men who hurried by them, until every man of the seventy had
passed, excepting one. He tugged at them.</p>

<p>"Now turn back!" he urged excitedly.</p>

<p>"Who are you Jeff asked, but he could not answer. The Sikh had
him by the throat and was burning the darkness with his eyes,
trying to recognize him.</p>

<p>"Quick! Who are you?" Jeff repeated.</p>

<p>As he spoke the faint reflection of a far-off flash of light
lifted the darkness, like summer-lightning. Simultaneously Jeff and
the Sikh recognized the prisoner whom Ali had kept dry. He was
scared&mdash;in pain because of fingers clutching at his
throat&mdash;but unmistakable. The Sikh let go.</p>

<p>"Quick! Come away!" he gasped, pulling at them,</p>

<p>[Pages 346-347 missing from the paper book used to create this
ebook.]</p>

<p>...wads down a gun-barrel, until it ceased in what seemed
vacuum. Lungs ached, and they retched; but a blast of air ice-cold
by contrast, came whistling back, providing breath, but no other
surcease, for they heard like a flood at war with fire the seething
roar of water, and the earth's foundations seemed to shake beneath
them.</p>

<p>"Are you there?" yelled Jeremy, groping wildly for his
friends.</p>

<p>Narayan Singh gripped him by the shoulder, and the two turned
back for Jeff. They stumbled on him, wrapped in death-grip with his
adversary. The Sikh's foot struck home into the bronze giant's
stomach. Jeff's fist, breaking from a python-hold, descended like a
poleax on the giant's neck, and in a second the three were
careering headlong for the tunnel's end with the pressure of a full
gale and the roar of a boiling flood so near behind them that in
their spines they knew the very feel of death. By the arms the two
dragged Jeff waist-deep out of surging water that followed and
swamped the hollow temple floor, and the three fell all together
gasping in the sunshine on the portico.</p>

<p>There presently Chullunder Ghose, still smeared with ashes and
half- naked, came to them with the erstwhile prisoner in yellow
trying not to appear to walk with him. The babu was triumphant, the
man in yellow sheepish, hiding fear under a veneer of pride.</p>

<p>"Where is Ali?" gasped Narayan Singh.</p>

<p>"Gone!" said Chullunder Ghose. "<i>Sahibs</i> , all is lost but
honor!" Nonchalantly he toyed with one great emerald ear-stud. "Am
unfortunate babu, but there are compensations. Devil, being slow on
foot presumably, takes hindermost fugitive who is too fat to
run&mdash;sometimes! There <i>are</i> exceptions. Am same.
Exceptional this time&mdash;very!"</p>

<p>"<i>Where</i> has Ali gone?"</p>

<p>"Where does flame go when <i>any</i> person blows out candle? To
where it came from, I <i>suspect</i>. <i>Verb. sap</i> . Ali
<i>did</i> come from Sikunderam, same being suitable environment
for gent of his kidney. Ali said to me: 'May Allah do so to this
son of my mother, and more likewise, if those <i>sahibs</i> are not
asking for destruction. I have lost too many sons. What shall I do
about it? There will be police investigation and many corpses to
explain.'&mdash;And this babu, being abject individual, had access
of enlightenment, plus memory of much experience with legal
luminaries. Am known to the police. Same is reciprocal. Police are
also known to me. Nice, isn't it" he asked, turning the emerald
toward the sunlight.</p>

<p>He was ordered bluntly to explain himself, and to cut the
explanation short.</p>

<p>"Am not explainable," he answered. "Am portion of riddle of
universe, but capable of genius on occasion. It occurred to this
babu that you are very ballistic <i>sahibs</i> &mdash;oh yes,
very&mdash;likely to be spat forth same as bullets from throat of
any cataclysm. Yes&mdash;am optimist. Having assisted Jeremy
<i>sahib</i> to juggle with skulls in temple compound, am
henceforth capable of believing anything&mdash;even that Jeremy
<i>sahib</i> will survive underworld explosions.
Ergo&mdash;<i>sahibs</i> , there is no hurry; I tell you Ali has
vanished; so has everybody!&mdash;ergo, it occurred to this babu
<i>most</i> opportunely that scapegoat is needed to obsess
intellect of seriously exercised police, who will be spurred to
indiscreet enquiries by higher-ups in club armchairs. Who better
than Ali? What solution better than elopement to Sikunderam? No
sooner thought than said&mdash;for a price! Good counsel in
emergency is surely worth two emeralds, but an Afghan is more
thrifty than Scotchman, Jew, Armenian and Greek combined, plus
Yankee trader thrown in. He would only part with one! Pretty, isn't
it? Worth, what would you say? How much?"</p>

<p>"Come now, come&mdash;what happened?" Ramsden demanded.</p>

<p>"Solution happened, <i>sahib</i> , this babu advising, Ali
making much haste to elope with lady. Thus. The Gauri knew too
much. Too much knowledge, in brain of lady of her mode of living,
leading to blackmail sooner than later always, same leading to
inveiglement in nets of the police,&mdash;distance should therefore
lend enchantment to otherwise somewhat faded charms of said
enchantress. <i>Nicht wahr</i> ? She has dowry&mdash;less one
emerald, surrendered as extremely meagre fee to this babu, who
explained to her that unless she shall hide her charms in
Sikunderam with Ali, who will make her, perhaps and perhaps not,
queen of many cutthroats, the police will inevitably capture her
and take the jewelry. And to Ali this babu remarked that unless he
shall take the Gauri with him, she will most certainly betray to
the police his weakness for butchering inoffensive members of Hindu
religious sect. And as for the maid, let Ali's son take her, she
also knowing too much. Advice was accepted&mdash;on
spot&mdash;instantly. Three-fold solution&mdash;very excellent. Ali
has a wife, who has a dowry. One son has a wife, who has youth and
good looks. The other surviving son has an example. They are
gone&mdash;northward. Can you beat it? as Jimgrim would
remark."</p>

<p>"Where are King and Grim?" demanded Jeff.</p>

<p>"Hunting for me, <i>sahib</i> . They are very angry. I cannot
imagine why. They suspect me of complicity in flight of Ali. Most
unreasonable. I am here to beg your honors' confidence&mdash;and
<i>some</i> additional emolument, not as inducement&mdash;oh, no,
most unnecessary!&mdash;but by way of reward in advance for holding
my tongue! Am not altruist," he added significantly.</p>

<p>"What do <i>you</i> want here?" demanded Jeremy, looking
straight into the face of the erstwhile prisoner.</p>

<p>"Protection!" he answered, rather humbly. "Bhima Ghandava has
disappeared."</p>

<p>"What of it?" asked Jeremy.</p>

<p>"He is that member of the Nine Unknown whom I was to have
killed! I betrayed my party to him, thinking it better that they
should all perish. But now Ghandava <i>sahib</i> has disappeared,
and I have no friends!"</p>

<p>Chullunder Ghose tapped him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Have you money?" he demanded. "No? Jewelry? No? Well&mdash;am
charitable. This babu will give advice in <i>forma pauperis</i> .
Go and be a hermit, which is proper course for individual with
aching conscience and no friends! Go! Be off! In words of Hamlet,
stay not&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the man in yellow was already gone; perhaps he was afraid of
King and Grim, angry, sweating, baffled, who came hurrying across
the temple courtyard.</p>

<p>"Bhima Ghandava has disappeared!" King announced out of breath,
and then listened while Ramsden related what had happened.</p>

<p>They went and pounded on the door of the house where they had
been lodged, but none answered, and they desisted at last in fear
of the police. However, the police were all busy on the waterfront,
where an ancient ruin on which <i>fakirs</i> used to stand in
turns, had vanished into the river&mdash;by earthquake, as the
newspapers asserted afterward&mdash;although no seismographs
recorded any earthquake in Benares.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done but to return to Delhi, and no man
but Cyprian to whom they dared to go. To have asked anybody else to
obtain European clothing for them would have led too surely to
enquiry. They searched for him first at Ghandava's house, but found
that empty and deserted. Cyprian was back in his own home, being
nursed by Manoel, who looked ashamed&mdash;repentant.</p>

<p>"The rascal!" said Cyprian. "The rogue! The impudent,
incorrigible sinner! You remember, there was a front page missing
from one of my occult books that be had hidden under a blanket in
the pantry? Well, he, Manoel had torn it out. I found
him&mdash;where do you think? I found him in a rear room in a
back-street starting a new religion with the aid of that page of
symbols! Rascal! But he is not altogether bad. He has been a
comfort. See, my sons&mdash;my house is clean again!"</p>

<p>"But why did you leave Ghandava's house?" asked Jeremy.</p>

<p>"They came and took all the furniture away!"</p>

<p>"Who did?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. People I had never seen before. They provided me
with a carriage to come home in, but gave no explanations. I hope
Ghandava is not in difficulties. He was always a courteous host and
a considerate friend, but there is only one possible result of
dabbling in occultism and the black arts."</p>

<p>"We heard," said Jeremy, "that he is one of the NINE&mdash;one
of the actual NINE UNKNOWN."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Cyprian. "Oh, no! I don't believe it. Whoever the
Nine Unknown are, they are devils&mdash;men without souls! Bhima
Ghandava is a gentleman. No, no, he can't be one of them."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, Pop, I believe he is!" said Jeremy.</p>

<p>"So do I," said King and Grim together.</p>

<p>"I'm pretty nearly sure of it," said Ramsden cautiously.
"Remember: he said that what <i>we</i> saw was merely a
trifle&mdash;nothing compared to all the other knowledge of the
Nine Unknown."</p>

<p>"My son, it is easy to say things," said Cyprian.</p>

<p>"Aye," exclaimed Narayan Singh, "and difficult to know things.
But I <i>know</i> . And no man can persuade me I do not know. Bhima
Ghandava is one of them."</p>

<p>"Knowledge," said Chullunder Ghose, rubbing his fat stomach,
"what is knowledge for, if not for use? Myself, am pragmatist.
Myself, am satisfied that <i>sahibs</i> wisely trusting this babu
to hold his tongue will provide same abject individual with
continuous employment at a generous remuneration. No, <i>sahibs</i>
, no! Am good sport! No&mdash;no threat intended! Blackmail not
included in my compendium of ways and means! Am gentleman,
accepting sportsmanlike standard of West and looking forward to
reward&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In hell, I'm afraid, unless you mend your ways, my, friend!"
said Cyprian.</p>
