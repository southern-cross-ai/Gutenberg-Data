<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;WHICH CONCERNS A
PENKNIFE</h2>

<p>The train rumbled dilatorily through the open country. The boy,
huddling in the corner of the third-class carriage, stared at the
changing series of views, framed by the window on his left, with
unseeing eyes.</p>

<p>His mind was occupied with other visions, visions of the
episodes of his recent experience. They were all very, very vivid,
and they left him trembling and unstrung, and his eyes swimming on
the borderland of tears.</p>

<p>It is said that when a man falls over a precipice he recalls all
the unimportant and some of the important events of his life during
the few seconds' flight through the air. In somewhat similar case
there were several precipitate moments during this journey when
Arthur Gaffyn endured a composite review of all the perverse moods
and experiences of his seventeen years of life that had reached
their apotheosis in that ill-omened ten minutes in "the Rook's"
study.</p>

<p>The climax was unendurable, horrible, and in some vague way,
unfair! It was useless to keep on saying to himself that school was
in any case a disgusting place, that the chaps at Cullington were a
lot of cads, and that the headmaster&mdash;or "the Rook" as they
called him&mdash;was a <i>beast</i> He found it easier to convince
himself of the truth of the last statement than of the other two.
The Rook he knew had disliked him from the first, never troubled to
try to find out anything in him, had damned him at sight as not a
representative specimen of the school "type."</p>

<p>But the school? It was absurd perhaps, but there was an
indefinable something about the school, a sort of sentiment which
pervaded the place. There were things about it he would never
forget, things and boys he knew that he would remember when all
other memories were dim.</p>

<p>There was old Seedy Simpson, who had been his chum for two
years. He had a curious affection for Seedy. And there was Tony
Younger, and Steele, and young Bates; and then there was Curly
Smithers, who had short flaxen hair and a most wonderful infectious
laugh. They were all decent chaps, and the memory of them would
make him sigh forever and ever.</p>

<p>And there were jolly days, days of sunlight, and "rags," and
absurd games, and days when he had distinguished himself in some
surprising manner. And there were curious odd moments when the
place satisfied him. Just a grin or a look some boy or master would
give him, the sun making patterns on the classroom floor, and birds
twittering outside the window. There were even moments in
chapel&mdash;usually the dullest and most boring of
places&mdash;when the drone of some old hymn would find an
emotional response within himself.</p>

<p>And there was cricket which always made an appeal when it wasn't
rammed down one's throat, and the thrill of a game of fives, which
he played well; and there were some glorious bouts of boxing in the
gym, at which he was no mean exponent. Indeed, one of the proudest
moments of his life had been when Moll, the gym-instructor, had
said, "Young Gaffyn is one of the best judges of distance we
have."</p>

<p>And now it had all come to this sudden and violent
end&mdash;dismissed!</p>

<p><br>
The disgrace of it! He tried to persuade himself that it wasn't a
disgrace; that it was all due to the Rook's prejudice; that the
whole thing was ridiculous; that he was not really "the person
without moral bias" that the Rook had denounced; but the weight of
his condemnation depressed him. It was useless to try to console
himself with the reflection that nothing within himself had
changed, and that incidentally he was now a free spirit, lording it
in a railway carriage while the chaps at Cullington were swotting
at their Greek prose, or their tiresome permutations and
combinations. The terrible and irrevocable fatality could not be
denied. He felt himself to be "a thin ghost or disembodied spirit"
haunted forever by the Rook's portentous threat of doom. It was not
so much the Rook himself, although he was terrifying enough; it was
what the Rook represented. He had been denounced by that cold
abstract voice that seemed to express the unalterable edict not of
a man but of a tradition, centuries and centuries of unswerving
faith in certain set forms and conventions&mdash;truth, justice,
"the honor of the school." And at his back he had not only the
traditions of Cullington but of all other schools, and of all the
masters at all the other schools, the church, the king, the judges,
the police, the army, the navy, the whole human fabric. Whatever
Arthur thought himself, he could not stand up against this. He felt
as though the forces of human life had formed a phalanx from which
he was shut out.</p>

<p>The train pulled up at a station and some people got out. It
started forward again, jerkily, and he beheld an outlying district
of congested squalor, where small back gardens and yards made a
pathetic attempt to strike a note of gaiety. It was the first
objective thing he had observed, and his heart was vaguely stirred
by the pathos of it.</p>

<p>"These people, too," he thought, "are outcasts. Perhaps I shall
come to this."</p>

<p>But his mind became busy again reviewing the incidents of the
crime that had led to his undoing. It had been the custom every
year for the Head's wife to take all the boys who sang in the choir
for a treat. It was a very rum business. They had a brake and drove
over to Moblechester, and had tea at the Aquarium. It was a curious
building where all sorts of queer things went on. There were crowds
of stalls and side-shows, and a man who did silhouette portraits,
and there was a large central hall where a concert took place. The
tea was prodigiously good, but he thought all the rest of it rather
boring. None of his particular friends were in the choir, and he
wandered about the building very much alone. It was a heavy, humid
sort of day, and the high-spirited fooling that went on among the
other boys got on his nerves.</p>

<p>After a time he went in to the concert-hall by himself and sat
up in a corner. There was a string-quartet playing. He hadn't a
program, and he didn't know what it was they played, but after
sitting there some time, the music affected him in an unaccountable
manner. He felt very much as though he wanted to cry, as though he
couldn't stand it. At the same time he had a feeling that he could
only describe as being egotistical. He looked round at the other
people there, and hated them. He hated their ugly, silly,
expressionless faces. He felt tremendously moved, and somehow
superior. He wanted to commune with some one, some one who would
understand, but there was no one there who would be likely to
understand. The only person in sight whom he knew was the Head's
wife. She was seated in the front row, looking very bored and
important. The situation became intolerable, and he went out. He
wandered round the gallery, and a mood of sullen perverseness came
over him. He avoided any boys he met from the school and wandered
into a cutler's booth. It was a large place elaborately constructed
in white wood and metal, with innumerable mirrors. There was an
attendant talking to some ladies by the door. He strolled to the
end of the shop. There appeared to be millions of glittering metal
things. One long counter was covered with penknives. His eyes
alighted on a particular penknife in the corner. It was a large
knife with mother-of-pearl covering, and it had about eight or ten
attachments. One could do nearly everything with it. It was a
splendid knife. It would certainly cost over a sovereign. He stood
there pondering and gazing at the knife a long time.</p>

<p>As the train traveled heavily London-ward, he tried to analyze
his own real feelings and motives at the moment when he perpetrated
the mad act that had been the cause of his dismissal. It was very
difficult, difficult and confusing. It had all been so sudden, an
impulse, in fact. He knew that it had suddenly occurred to him how
jolly it would be to have the knife, and he knew he had not enough
to pay for it. Interwoven with this thought was the reflex of the
sullen mood of resentment against his fellow-man on that humid
afternoon, and the further encouragement of a small voice that
said:</p>

<p>"There are swarms of these here. <i>One</i> won't make any
difference."</p>

<p>And then he had a vision of himself swanking with the knife when
he got back to Cullington. The whole thing was instantaneous. He
slipped the knife into his pocket, and made for the door.</p>

<p>He had got out into the gallery and then the appalling thing
happened. It was so horrible, he struggled not to think of it. But
the vision of that moment recurred again, and again, and again. He
had not allowed for the mirrors. There was another attendant, a
young man with a dark mustache. He would remember that man's face
till his dying day. It was a perfect nightmare. He had been caught
hold of and taken into an office. The Head's wife had been
summoned. Two or three flushed officials talked excitedly. He had
nothing to say. He believed he cried in a dry-eyed, ineffectual
sort of way. He lost the power of speech and volition. The Head's
wife was terrible. She looked at him with those hard, cruel eyes of
hers. She must be the most unattractive woman in the world. He
remembered noticing the light down on her upper lip and the stiff,
silly way she held herself. He remembered her imploring the
officials to spare "the honor of the school," and the acid tones of
her voice as she added:</p>

<p>"If you will be kind enough to leave the punishment of the
offender to the Head, I assure you, gentlemen, you shall be
satisfied in every way. Every reparation shall be made. It is a
serious thing for us, for the school."</p>

<p>She had seemed to him at that moment terrifying but
unconscionably ridiculous. He could not remember then what the
officials had said, or what the Head's wife had said. He seemed to
lose all power over his receptive senses, and stood there dumbly,
unnerved, like an animal waiting to be slaughtered. He had visions
of prison, and he thought to himself:</p>

<p>"It is all over. Everything is finished."</p>

<p>Some one led him down to the brake on which the boys were to
return. By a curious chance none of them had witnessed his
adventure. He remembered Watkinson of the lower Sixth strolling up
and saying:</p>

<p>"Hullo, Gaffyn, where have you been since tea?"</p>

<p>And himself answering:</p>

<p>"Oh, mucking about."</p>

<p>The return journey in the brake, and the normal condition of
things when they got back to school steadied him somewhat. He kept
asking himself whether the whole thing weren't an hallucination,
some mad dream that had come to him while listening to the music.
Or even if it were true, whether it wouldn't blow over, after the
imposition of some trifling punishment. He tried desperately to
work at his "prep," but the incidents of the afternoon kept
interposing themselves between his eyes and the book. It was
useless. Suddenly Baynes, the senior prefect, entered the
class-room. He looked round and spotted Gaffyn, and then said in a
matter-of-fact way:</p>

<p>"Gaffyn, the Head wishes to see you in his study after
chapel."</p>

<p>Then indeed the nervous impulses of his body rioted exceedingly.
He tried to appear casual, as though he knew what it was about, and
that it was of no importance. But incidentally he felt physically
sick. He answered, "All right," and dared not lift his eyes from
the book till the end of "prep."</p>

<p>In chapel the cold greenish light from the gas-brackets made the
faces of the boys and masters appear ghoulish and revolting. From
his point of vantage in the choir he watched the Rook's face. It
gave no clue to the sinister proceedings that were to follow. It
looked cold and expressionless, less like a rook than like a
vulture. He wondered for the first time why he had been called a
rook and not a vulture. He was certainly very dark, had raven-black
hair turning gray at the temples and a heavy dark mustache. He was
very short-sighted and wore thick spectacles. This probably
accounted for his always looking down, and indirectly it may have
accounted for his walk. He had a most peculiar walk, a sort of
pounce from one foot to the other, as though he were not sure of
himself beyond a stride. He seemed to poise on one leg, and then
dart forward on to the other and poise again. It added to his
bird-of-prey appearance.</p>

<p>Not once during the short service did the Rook look up, and not
for a moment did Arthur take his eyes off him. Some dreary
hymn-tune droned through the chapel, and Mr. Harris up in the
organ-loft had pulled out the <i>vox-humana</i> stop, and was
giving full play to that peculiar drone of hurdy-gurdy emotionalism
which is deemed the right and appropriate atmosphere for breeding a
religious spirit in a Christian heart. It was strange but at that
moment he felt a recurrence of the sense of egotistical elation
which he had experienced at the concert in the afternoon. He
thought to himself:</p>

<p>"How silly all this is; silly and sordid and commonplace!"</p>

<p>But immediately the vision of all other chapels, and the tyranny
of righteousness (again accompanied by the police, and the judges,
and the king, and the army, and the navy) once more combined to
depress him. He felt very much alone. If only there were some one,
just one other person who would believe in him, help him. He was
not wholly bad, he kept saying to himself. Chapel was finished, and
the boys were scurrying to their different dormitories. With
desperate deliberation he walked up to the Rook's study. He knocked
on the door, but the master had not yet arrived, so he stood
patiently without.</p>

<p>He seemed to wait an interminable period, and then he heard the
steady pounce of the Rook coming along the corridor. He stood on
one side in the respectful attitude expected of a boy at Cullington
College. The Rook walked by him without glancing in his direction.
He opened the door and turned on the electric light, and went into
the room, followed by Arthur.</p>

<p>He fancied the Rook mumbled, "Shut the door." In any case, he
did so, and stood in the usual culprit's place facing the desk. In
the brief moment while the master was walking to his seat behind
the green standard lamp, the whole appearance of the room impressed
itself on the boy's mind in an indelible picture. The heavy
Victorian furniture and the cold green walls, the photograph of
Zermatt between the two windows, several photographs of school and
college teams, and, for some reason or other, an enlargement of a
portrait of Mr. Balfour framed in oak.</p>

<p>To his dying day he would remember that moment, and the intense
silence while his heart was beating against his ribs. He thought
the Rook was never going to speak; he meant to go on just torturing
him with his accusatory silence.</p>

<p>But at last the voice came, like the snapping of a steel
spring:</p>

<p>"Well, Gaffyn, what have you to say?"</p>

<p>Arthur shivered. He believed he murmured limply:</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir."</p>

<p>There was another ghastly pause, and then the Rook said:</p>

<p>"You don't know, eh?"</p>

<p>He became aware of the Rook looking at him for the first time.
His eyes looked enormous through the thick glasses. The tones of
his voice changed. He spoke in a thin, melancholy key:</p>

<p>"Do you deny that you took this property from the cutler's
shop?"</p>

<p>Arthur answered faintly:</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>The Rook took off his spectacles and wiped them. Arthur was
aware that he could not see him without his spectacles, but he
looked so horrible without them, so like a blind monstrosity, that
he secretly prayed that he would put them back again. But he went
on rubbing and blinking at the lamp. Suddenly in a loud, stern
voice he said:</p>

<p>"Indeed! And may I trouble you to tell me <i>why</i> you took
it?"</p>

<p>Arthur shuffled from one foot to the other and coughed. He could
not get his voice. At last he managed to stammer:</p>

<p>"I didn't think it would matter very much, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>The head-master of Cullington readjusted his glasses and fixed
his eyes on the desk in front of him.</p>

<p>"Really! That's very interesting. You didn't think it would
matter very much? You think that deliberate stealing doesn't matter
much? You think that honor, and truth, and honesty do not matter
very much, eh? You think that the honor of the school does not
matter very much?"</p>

<p>Arthur did not answer, and the Rook continued:</p>

<p>"This is not the first time you have been before me, Gaffyn. But
it is, I think, the first time you have been before me for
stealing. There are many other things against you, but stealing is
an offence we do not condone. If you will steal a penknife, you
will steal anything else. If you will steal and think it does not
matter very much, it means that you will do anything that Satan
prompts you to. You are the most dangerous sort of boy to have in a
school, in fact the most dangerous element to have in society of
any sort, for you have ability and no moral bias."</p>

<p>The Rook paused and fumbled with some papers; then he said
icily:</p>

<p>"We do not require such boys at Cullington. You will catch the
2:37 back to London to-morrow. You are dismissed."</p>

<p>Arthur was staggered. He had expected punishment, but it had
never occurred to him that it might take this extreme form. He
could not for the moment grasp exactly what it signified. Only one
thing stood out clearly&mdash;freedom! He would be leaving school,
getting away from it all. There was no mention of police, or
corporal punishment, or anything of that sort. It would be more a
sort of mental and moral punishment. He would be bundled off and
left to stew in the juice of his own bad conscience, branded
forever with the hall-mark of guilt by the school, and all the
other schools, by the judges, the police, the army and navy and all
the other paraphernalia of an upright people. He would wander about
the world a forsworn convict. He was astute enough at that moment
to jump to the conclusion that it was the longest-headed, most
diabolical punishment of all. And it was all brought about by a
pearl-handled penknife. A temptation rose to his lips to mutter,
"What a ridiculous fuss to make about a penknife!" but he did not
say this; he merely answered:</p>

<p>"Very well, sir."</p>

<p>The Rook was still staring at his desk, and he heard him say in
a matter-of-fact voice:</p>

<p>"We have promised the director of the Aquarium that yon shall
leave the school to-morrow. I have written to your father
explaining the reason. You may go."</p>

<p>As he lay shivering in his bed that night, his mind became
acutely concerned with the Rook's penultimate sentence, "I have
written to your father explaining the reason."</p>

<p>Good Heavens! Was there ever a more deplorable position to be
in? His father would <i>have the reason explained to him!</i> He
could not by any stretch of the imagination picture how it would
affect his father. If his mother had been alive, his dear French
mother who had died five years ago, he would have rushed to her and
thrown his arms around her neck and sobbed. And she would have
sobbed, too. She would have scolded, blamed, stormed, commiserated
and hugged him. It would have been a terrible quarter-of-an-hour,
and then would have come that sense of peace, and the cosy feeling
of starting all over again. And afterwards she would have fought
for him cunningly and desperately. She would have routed the
judges, and the masters, and the army, and the navy, and all the
rest of them. She would have triumphed, and made him triumph. But
his poor, ineffectual, highly-strung, sensitive father! How would
he take it?</p>

<p>Never, never, never in all their united lives had his father
given him anything of intimacy, or any demonstration of affection.
Not but what he believed that his father had a real affection for
him in his peculiar way, but he simply could not bring himself to
show it. When they were together there was always a feeling of
intense self-consciousness. He would talk, but always of general
and abstract things. If the conversation showed the slightest
tendency to veer towards personal matters, his father would behave
like a frightened rabbit. He would be most garrulous when most
nervous. He would dash about for topics to ward off the terrible
personal equation.</p>

<p>It must be said for Arthur, whose character has already given
evidence of a certain lack of stability, that during that sleepless
night, and also during the train journey to town, he was more
concerned for his father than for himself. It would simply be
torture for his father to get that letter from the Rook "explaining
the reason."</p>

<p>He was still analyzing the probabilities of his father's
behaviour, and heaving with the turmoil of his own emotions, when
the train slowed down and rumbled across the iron bridge and into
the big terminus.</p>

<p>It became necessary then to bestir himself, and rescue his box
from the general commotion going on round the luggage-van. He
somewhat guiltily ordered a four-wheeled cab. He resented having to
do this, because his father would have to pay for it, and his
father, he knew, was by no means well off. But there was no
alternative; his box was too heavy to carry.</p>

<p>The cab itself had a guilty look, and it meandered off in the
direction of Bloomsbury at the pace of a thing that dreads to find
the journey accomplished. When they arrived in Eccles Square, he
asked the cabman to help him in with the box. The man looked at him
with the expression of a person whose most sacred feelings had been
violently outraged. But he made no comment and got down from his
seat. The journey up those five stone steps to his father's house
was accompanied by the most amazing exhibition of physical
suffering on the part of the cabman it had ever been Arthur's lot
to witness. He gasped and panted, wheezed and struggled, so
violently that Arthur had visions of his home-coming being marked
by the man's dissolution on the hall mat. However, when Mrs.
Stabbe, the cook-housekeeper, had come to the rescue, and lifted
the box quite easily by herself and put it round the corner, Arthur
asked him how much the fare was.</p>

<p>Through the violent derangement of his vocal organs the cabman
managed to say, "Three-and-six," and Arthur handed him four
shillings.</p>

<p>When the door had slammed, Mrs. Stabbe remarked:</p>

<p>"Lord! Master Arthur, you're just like your father. The fare's
only two shillings."</p>

<p>Arthur grinned uncomfortably and said:</p>

<p>"Is the guv'nor in, Mrs. Stabbe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," she answered. "He's in the studio with Mr.
McIlrane."</p>

<p>Mr. Gaffyn senior was an architect, and he lived alone in this
high narrow house in Eccles Square, attended by Mrs. Stabbe and one
maid. He conducted his business in a studio at the back, that had
formerly been a laboratory built over the garden by the former
tenant, who was an analyst. The house was a curious mixture of
elegance and shabbiness. There were a few pieces of rare old
furniture, a few traces of gentleness and refinement, the faded
relicts of a woman's influence, and for the rest, everything was
serviceable, fairly comfortable, and very much worn. There was
oil-cloth on the upper landings on which the pattern had been
completely obliterated, except in corners where people didn't
tread, and in many places there were holes right through to the
boards. The heavy curtains in the drawing-room seemed to have
secreted the grime of Bloomsbury for generations. The ceilings were
black, and the paper was hanging in ominous bulges in the hall. On
the other hand, there was a splendid modern bathroom, all white
tiles and new nickel fittings, probably some innovation insisted on
by the late Mrs. Gaffyn. The small breakfast-room at the back had
been fitted with new oak panelling, and there were six framed
pastels of a very modern <i>genre</i>, signed by J. Guillot.</p>

<p>&gt;Over the mantelpiece in the drawing-room was a photograph of
Arthur's mother holding a baby in her arms. And this baby was not
himself. It was his little sister who had died within the year of
her birth and who had been the cause of his mother's death. This
much he had learned from his Aunt Elizabeth. His mother was the
daughter of a famous French baritone, a Monsieur Jules Carbonnet,
who created many parts in the operas of Massenet at that time, and
who was, moreover, a man much talked about, owing to his somewhat
eccentric manners and his florid mode of life. "Florid" was not
Aunt Elizabeth's term. She called it "peculiar," and she added by
way of parenthesis that she was afraid "old Carbonnet was not all
he ought to have been." The term "florid" was introduced mentally
by Arthur in forming his own deduction of the character of his
notorious grandfather.</p>

<p>It appeared that his father met his mother in Paris, where he
had been sent when quite a young man by some architectural society
to report with two other architects on the result of the labors of
Baron Haussmann in restoring the irrepressible city after the
Franco-German War. Mr. Gaffyn had been chosen partly because he
promised to be one of the coming architects, and partly because he
spoke the French language fluently. The exact conditions under
which he met Mlle. Carbonnet remained obscure. As far as Arthur
could remember, the marriage had been entirely successful. They
seemed to get on wonderfully together. He remembered his mother's
endearing terms. She called Mr. Gaffyn "<i>mamie</i>" and sometimes
"my little one," which, in view of the fact that her husband was
six feet two inches, seemed peculiarly piquant to the boy. And Mr.
Gaffyn on his part would blush painfully if anyone were present and
mutter, "Yes&mdash;we&mdash;well, m'm, my dear&mdash;" and would
quickly plunge for some topic of general interest. But he would
fidget about, and watch her in a furtive, adoring manner. Arthur
could not remember that he ever used a stronger term than "my
dear," or that he ever gave her little presents, or made endearing
advances. He was just as conventional and self-conscious with her
as with other people. But she seemed to understand him, and treated
him precisely like a baby.</p>

<p>Arthur was the only child until a certain tragic summer. Between
the day of his birth and the birth of his little sister there had
been an interval of eleven years.</p>

<p>Arthur could not bring himself to dwell on those terrible days.
The anguish of his father seemed to express itself in eccentric
movements. For a time he became frankly "a queer character." He
never gave any evidence of giving way to grief. He was like a sane
man hiding behind the pose of an insane man. When, on the day of
his wife's funeral, tearful relatives threatened to throw
themselves on his bosom, he talked to them about Byzantine
architecture.</p>

<p>He wore extravagantly out-of-date clothes, studied Spanish, and
physics, and subjects which bordered on the esoteric. He became a
profound seeker after qualities. If he secured a commission, he
would spend an unconscionable time over his designs. He would go to
South Kensington, and spend days considering the section of a
certain cornice. He would then set it up with meticulous precision.
Suddenly some other idea would come to him, and he would tear up
this elaborately-considered drawing and do something quite
different.</p>

<p>Alas! for the early promise of the young architect who went with
such excellent credentials to Paris. Very few commissions came his
way. People became impatient of all this nervous searching after
quality, and this vacillation. They shrugged their shoulders and
called him "poor old Gaffyn." A man of irreproachable taste and
great sensitiveness and power of invention, he had all the
qualities of a great architect without any of that sense of
practical application which will see a thing through. And a strange
thing was that, despite his passionate groping for beauty in his
work, he seemed to take delight in surrounding himself with ugly
and commonplace things in his house, and in being chilling and
matter-of-fact in his convention. This was so, in any case, since
the death of his wife.</p>

<p>He had an assistant who was a curious counterpart of himself. He
was an old-young man named McIlrane. That is to say, he was
actually twenty-six years of age, but he might have been anything
from thirty-six to forty-six. He was as profound a student as Mr.
Gaffyn, and equally as ineffectual. He had a thin aquiline face and
wore spectacles, and he imitated Mr. Gaffyn unconsciously. There
was surely never a more unpractical couple destined to run a
business. The marvel is that drawings were completed at all. They
entered big competitions, and talked about some minor point of
aesthetic interest until it was nearly the day of sending in. As a
matter of fact, there is no record of their ever having secured a
prize in open combination, or of having been the joint architects
of any recognized building, with the exception of one small
mausoleum, which a wealthy stock-jobber had erected to the memory
of his uncle who was killed in the Zulu War.</p>

<p>But they lived a wonderful life of their own, sublimely
oblivious to success or failure. They burned the midnight oil
profusely, and were never tired of expounding new theories about
architecture or biology, or of experimenting in new media for the
expression of their architectural ideas. Mr. Gaffyn would watch
McIlrane making a shaded charcoal sketch of a cap. When it was
finished, they would pin it up on the wall, and go to the other end
of the studio and stand side by side with their heads slightly
aslant and criticize it.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;don't you think, perhaps," Mr. Gaffyn would say,
"the&mdash;er&mdash;filet of the scroll&mdash;er; a little broader,
eh?"</p>

<p>And McIlrane would reply:</p>

<p>"Ah! I thought perhaps you'd think so, Mr. Gaffyn. Yes, yes, I
am quite sure you're right, though I may have rather emphasized the
cast shadow underneath. Perhaps in the model the effect would be
broader."</p>

<p>They would make another drawing, and then a clay model of the
cap, and worry over it for days, and eventually decide that it was
the wrong type of cap altogether. And all this for a job which they
stood only the remotest chance of getting! The stock-jobber's
mausoleum was indeed a <i>magnum opus</i>&mdash;it took seven
months to design&mdash;but the client was not particularly pleased
with it. He did not consider that it was sufficiently suggestive of
the Zulu War. And after he had freed himself from his architects,
he employed a local brass furnisher to cover it with spears, and
assagais, and skulls.</p>

<p><br>
The meeting between Arthur and his father on the day of his return
took place in the hall. After the retreat of the cabman, and Mrs.
Stabbe's intimation that the master of the house was in the studio,
Arthur remarked that he would not disturb him. He would see him
later. He then went upstairs and mooned about the different rooms
to see if there were any alterations or additions, a vague
expectation that was quickly doomed to disappointment After that he
unpacked his box in a sketchy way and had a warm bath. This was a
luxury he always looked forward to in his father's house, for it
was an operation that at school was attended with the greatest
degree of discomfort.</p>

<p>He took a long time over the bath and dressed in a leisurely
manner, and then strolled down to the dining-room on the ground
floor. There was very little there to interest him. The The air
seemed heavy with stale tobacco smoke, and on the horsehair settee
was a pile of old copies of <i>The Times</i>, and various trade
journals. He took an apple out of a bowl on the sideboard and stood
munching it in front of the window. After a few moments he heard
the studio door open and slam, and his father's footsteps scurrying
across the hall.</p>

<p>Arthur's heart was beating rapidly, and he bit desperately at
the apple, feeling that in some way the action helped him to
control his nervousness. He heard his father fumbling at the
hat-stand. He was evidently going oat. He did not know of Arthur's
return. Making a great effort to steady himself, he strolled
casually across the room and into the hall.</p>

<p>Mr. Gaffyn was in the act of taking an umbrella out of the
stand. He looked up quickly and said:</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>Arthur replied:</p>

<p>"Hullo!"</p>

<p>There was a desperately disconcerting pause. He noticed his
father fussing about with his gloves and putting some papers down.
He made a curious noise in his throat, and at last said:</p>

<p>"Oh, so you've got back, then."</p>

<p>Arthur wriggled against the wall, still munching the apple. He
answered:</p>

<p>"Yes, I got a cab from Charing Cross. The man helped me in with
the box."</p>

<p>Mr. Gaffyn again said, "Oh" and blew his nose. He then took his
hat down from the peg and remarked jerkily:</p>

<p>"I'm just going out to try and get some decent tracing-paper.
This stuff of Boliver's is hopeless; don't take the ink, you know.
McIlrane thinks Shaw's is the best."</p>

<p>It was Arthur's turn to say "Oh" and there was another pause.
Neither father nor son looked at each other. Suddenly Mr. Gaffyn
said:</p>

<p>"I see you've got one of those apples. Fred sent them up from
Basingstoke&mdash;not bad. Codlings, you know. I don't think
they're a patch on Blenheim oranges&mdash;haven't the flavor."</p>

<p>Arthur leaned against the wall, and screwing up one eye, peered
along the line of an oak frame with the other, as though intensely
interested to see whether it were true. At the same time he
answered:</p>

<p>"Oh, I don 't know. I rather like a Codling."</p>

<p>"Oh, they're really all right," answered Mr. Gaffyn; "only
they're cookers. We're very busy. We're going in for this new
Grimchester Municipal Buildings job. It's a very big thing; working
night and day."</p>

<p>Arthur again said "Oh" but in a different key. It was an "oh"
that struggled to convey the idea that he was immensely pleased and
interested, although as a matter of fact his only feeling was one
of intense relief, for he felt convinced from his father's manner
that he meant to avoid the tragic subject which was the immediate
cause of Arthur's presence in the house. And this, indeed, proved
to be the case. Mr. Gaffyn gripped his belongings, and opened the
front door. He repeated:</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a very big thing," and he darted out into the
street; and never under any circumstances did he ever give any
hint, or make any reference to the letter which the Rook had sent
him "explaining the reason why."</p>

<p>Later in the evening they dined together, an uncomfortable meal
of desultory interjections. The safest ground was the health and
welfare of various relations and friends. Arthur would say:</p>

<p>"Is Aunt Elizabeth all right?"</p>

<p>And Mr. Gaffyn would reply:</p>

<p>"'m, yes, fairly so so. She gets touches of this gastric
catarrh; doesn't take care of herself."</p>

<p>There would be another pause, and then Mr. Gaffyn would say:</p>

<p>"George Carrowby has got rid of the lease of that house at
last."</p>

<p>And Arthur would reply with one of his most sympathetic "ohs,"
having but a vague idea who George Carrowby was, and certainly
never having heard that the said gentleman had a lease he was
anxious to dispose of. After a longer interval Arthur would jerk
out:</p>

<p>"This pudding's good!"</p>

<p>And Mr. Gaffyn would reply:</p>

<p>"Yes, it's better than sometimes. She usually gets it too
stodgy."</p>

<p>It was a brief meal, Mr. Gaffyn eating with great rapidity, and
fidgeting with his pipe, which he would occasionally take out of
his side pocket and place on the cloth, and then replace again.
Arthur was too nervous to be interested in anything but the
pudding. The cheese had barely made its appearance before Mr.
Gaffyn lighted his pipe and said:</p>

<p>"Must just see what McIlrane did about the plan of the ground
floor."</p>

<p>And he went quickly out of the room and back to the studio.
Later in the evening a friend of his called, a Mr. Cottersby, a
local surveyor, and Arthur heard them discussing drainage, and the
marvelous results to be achieved by using the new system of
reinforced concrete. He listened for some time, and then wandered
once more round the house. He discovered a seven-years' old copy of
Cassel's <i>Sports and Pastimes</i>, and spent an hour examining
the diagrams of gentlemen playing badminton and rackets, and young
ladies striking graceful attitudes at archery. This amusement then
began to pall, and he crept downstairs again and listened in the
hall. The maid, a fat-faced Welsh girl, called Ada, came up from
the kitchen with a tray on which was a Tantalus and some glasses.
She went into the studio. As the door opened, Arthur heard Mr.
Cottersby's voice saying:</p>

<p>"Yates &amp; Platts' estimate was more than seven hundred and
fifty lower than the lowest, so old Griggs, the assessor, began to
smell a rat. He called a committee meeting&mdash;I happen to know
because my partner, Stillway's brother-in-law, was on it&mdash;and
he said&mdash;"</p>

<p>The door snapped to, and Arthur muttered to himself, "Oh,
hell!"</p>

<p>He ate two more of the Codling apples and went upstairs. The gay
bathroom once more made an irresistible appeal. He undressed, had
another warm bath, and then went to bed.</p>

<p><br>
It would be difficult to know how much of the wretchedness of that
night was due to the unreasonable action of eating raw apples, just
before a hot bath, and how much was due to the reaction from the
strain he had passed through, but he spent a very unhappy
night.</p>

<p>A feeling of loneliness and remorse crept over him as he rolled
between the sheets. He wondered about the chaps at Cullington, and
what they were thinking of him. Old Seedy Simpson and Dicky
Younger&mdash;they would all get to know about it. He was free, a
free man to wander the world, and they were slaves, tied hand and
foot, but oh! how he envied them! The morning would come. At
half-past six the bell would ring and there would be the usual
grousing and clatter, and they would have to get up and rush down
to chapel, and have a cheerless breakfast of thin tea and
bread-and-butter, and then be bullied by the masters for not having
learned things overnight; but they had something, something that he
had lost, that he would never be able to regain. He could get up in
the morning any time he liked, nine, or ten, or half-past. He could
probably have bacon and marmalade for breakfast, and mooch about
all day, but there would always be that peculiar fear, something
that the Rook had branded him with, the mocking condemnation of the
whole world; and it was all because of that ridiculous
penknife!</p>

<p>It was true the Rook had said, "There are many other things
against you," but they were on a different plane to this. Bagging
apples twice (one doesn't steal apples, one bags them),
insubordination several times&mdash;there was that disgusting day
when he lost his temper with Elkin, the mathematical master, and
told him "he didn't care a damn about his silly theories"&mdash;and
that other occasion when one spring afternoon he had gone off for a
ramble across the country instead of playing cricket. On the way
back he had met Bodwell, his form-master, on horseback. And Bodwell
had scowled at him and said: "If you were half a man, Gaffyn, you
would be playing cricket!"</p>

<p>He didn't know why this remark infuriated him so, but it did. He
was keen on cricket, but on that day the country seemed more
alluring. There were small fleecy clouds scudding before the light
wind. It seemed unreasonable if one could not sometimes enjoy these
things all by oneself. He had noted Bodwell's fat back shaking on
the horse as he ambled down the hill. He had suddenly run after
him, and bawled out in a rude voice:</p>

<p>"I didn't feel in the mood to play cricket!"</p>

<p>There had been a lot of trouble about that, apologies and all
that sort of thing. One does not have "moods" in a public school.
It isn't done. And if one does, one controls them, and in any case,
under no circumstance does one lose one's temper with a master. He
lay there palpitating with a sense of outrage at the mere
recollection of that incident. After all, why should one
<i>have</i> to play cricket? It was understandable that one should
<i>have</i> to learn lessons, for if one did not, no one, except
perhaps a beastly swot like Baynes, would ever bother to learn
anything at all. But a game! He supposed it was all somehow
involved in that bigger thing, "form," and what the Rook called
"the honor of the school." The school ought to do well at cricket,
of course. It wouldn't do to get another hiding from Bradwell
College, as they had last year; a fearful hiding it was, an innings
and over a hundred runs. But still, surely there <i>might</i> be
other things. Suppose a chap, for instance, had the instincts of a
landscape-painter. Was he never to go about observing things except
from cover-point or long leg? Suppose that old boy&mdash;what was
his name?&mdash;Corot!&mdash;suppose he had been sent to an English
public school. Would he have been considered "half a man," or a
person without a sense of "form," because he sloped off one
afternoon by himself to look at the windmill at Cheney-Guildhurst
silhouetted against the meadows of Wray's Farm, instead of acting
as long-stop to Greene, the first eleven fast bowler?</p>

<p>Of course he ought not to have taken the penknife; that was a
silly, unpardonable thing. He vowed to himself he would never do
anything of that sort again. Not that he felt there was anything
fundamentally vile in the action&mdash;he would not have taken it
from a poor man, or from anyone if it had made them
unhappy&mdash;but it was so obviously likely to lead one into
endless trouble and difficulties.</p>

<p>But in the meantime, what was going to become of him? He would
have to work, he supposed. He was, in any case, to have left school
the following term. He would have to do what his Aunt Elizabeth
called, "go out into the world and earn his own living." What did
he want to do? Frankly, he had not the faintest idea. In fact, the
idea of earning his own living appeared revolting to him. He would
like to be a great person suddenly, without all the sordid business
of going through the mill. He would like to be a Sir Joshua
Reynolds, or a Mr. Gladstone, some one people would talk about in
the newspapers, and nudge each other as he passed, and say, "There
he is."</p>

<p>There was no reason why he should not attain this eminent
position, so why should he feel so wretched? He wanted some one to
confide in intensely, some one who would believe in him, who would
hug him and torture him at the same time. Who was there who cared
for him? He knew that his father did in his rum way, but never,
never, never had he given the slightest sign. And for his part, he
loved his father passionately. He could not help it. He loved the
feeble fuddling way he did things, the something pathetic that
seemed to lurk behind his eyes and color all his movements. He
thought of his father's eyes that so seldom looked at him. They
were not the eyes of a furtive, dishonest person. They were
extraordinarily clear and gentle, like the eyes of a very young
girl, and they moved restlessly, as though they covered some sacred
thing that was too sensitive to endure the prying intrusion of the
outside world.</p>

<p>He wondered whether, when the discussion of drainage was
finished, his father would lie in bed, as he was doing now, and
feel all overflowing with vague, inexpressible feelings that made
one want to cry. It was all badly arranged, this world. There were
other people. There was Edith, of whom we shall hear later. He
detested her cordially. And there was Aunt Elizabeth; she was an
awful old fool, but he rather liked her in an unaccountable way.
She was his father's sister. And then there was Eleanor. How very
strange! Why had he not thought of Eleanor before? <i>Of course</i>
there was Eleanor. For years now he had loved Eleanor very dearly.
She was his cousin. Aunt Elizabeth's daughter. How often had he not
lain awake at night at school, and thought of her lustrous eyes.
She had wonderful eyes. They seemed all misty and comforting. The
rest of her face was obscure, a sort of dim halo of olive skin and
fair, brown hair, just an atmosphere for the beautiful eyes to rest
in. It seemed strange that during these hapless days, and this
unendurable night, he had not remembered before, the beautiful eyes
of Eleanor, that it had only just occurred to him what a good idea
it would be to marry her. And then <i>she</i> would hug him, and
torture him, and he would be wretched again, and then would come
that wonderful, comforting sense of peace.</p>

<p>"It's an awful rum business," he thought, and dwelling upon the
divagations of this abstruse thought, he passed into the land of
dreams.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;THE DISENCHANTED DAY</h2>

<p>Mr. GAaffyn's agony in having to make up his mind became evident
in his manner. He darted through doors to avoid his son, and when
they were inevitably thrown together at mealtimes he plunged into
channels of conversation that were entirely outside the boy's
comprehension. To the despair of Mrs. Stabbe, he made pencil
sketches on the tablecloth of architectural features that were
being introduced into the competition drawings for Grimchester
Municipal Buildings. He talked about Pugin, and Scott, and Inigo
Jones, about the transition period in French Gothic, about the
absurd restrictions made by the Grimchester town council. He talked
about a fever that Mr. Cottersby's daughter was suffering from,
about the futility of the Government, the iniquity of certain
measures that affected rural landlords. He talked about the way the
Great Western Railway bungled the handling of steel girders, and
the genius of Mrs. Stabbe in making a rice-pudding without using an
egg.</p>

<p>But of Arthur or of himself, not a word!</p>

<p>Arthur would get up late and have breakfast by himself, with his
left arm curled lovingly round a book. He would have three or four
warm baths during the day, stroll about the streets, look in the
shops, buy sundry bottles of ginger-beer, and sometimes go to the
Oval to watch a cricket match. The only personal contact he had
with his father would be over a small question of finance. When he
had no money left, he would hang about the hall at some opportune
moment when his father was either going out or coming in. He would
then wriggle about at the bottom of the stairs, and say:</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;er&mdash;I say, could you possibly spare me a bob or
two! I&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>And Mr. Gaffyn would answer very quickly:</p>

<p>"Eh! Oh&mdash;er&mdash;yes. I&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>And he would cough and put down a few shillings, and simply race
away through the door.</p>

<p>This mode of life went on for exactly three weeks and four days,
before any incident came to break the monotony of it. And then one
morning, just after one of the little financial incidents mentioned
before, Arthur was startled by his father saying jerkily:</p>

<p>"Let's see, school broke up yesterday; I've asked Elizabeth to
dinner on Thursday," and he vanished.</p>

<p>Arthur pondered over this statement all day. There was nothing
surprising in Aunt Elizabeth paying a visit. On the contrary, it
was rather remarkable that she had not been before. But why did his
father break the formality of their relationship by telling him of
the approaching visit! And why, more especially, did he remark,
"School broke up yesterday," as though the two statements were to a
certain extent connected? He could not come to any satisfactory
conclusion in the matter, and he spent the intervening three days
in a greater state of contemplative idleness than usual. The
dominant fact that impressed itself on his mind was that the visit
of Aunt Elizabeth meant also the visit of Eleanor.</p>

<p>He thought of Eleanor lingeringly, and decided that he would
take the earliest opportunity of making love to her. Thursday
should be an enchanted day. He would start his life afresh, with
the eyes of Eleanor helping him, luring him on to greater and
greater ambitions.</p>

<p>Thursday was indeed a very glorious day, and he decided that he
could pay it no greater tribute than to spend the morning and
afternoon at the Oval. Consequently he persuaded Mrs. Stabbe to
give him a packet of sandwiches and a piece of cake and an apple,
and he started out for Kennington. He sat the whole day on a very
hard bench, with his back to the gas-works, under a sweltering sun,
and watched five professionals pile up a huge score for Surrey. It
was glorious! It was, in fact, the happiest day he had spent since
he left Cullington, and he frequently thought of his life there,
and compared it unfavorably with the present splendid freedom of
his days. When the last ball was bowled and there was the usual
scamper across the field, he got up and stretched himself. He felt
rather tired and stiff, and he walked along the asphalt walk toward
the exit gate. He had not gone twenty yards before a boy came
clambering over the benches and almost stepped on his toes. He
looked at the boy's face, and the boy looked at him. It was Seedy
Simpson! Instinctively he cried out:</p>

<p>"Hullo, Seedy!"</p>

<p>And instantaneously his mind became occupied with several
peculiar psychological impressions. In the first place, he was
immediately conscious that the relationship between Seedy and
himself was not what it was. It was very apparent that Seedy knew
all about <i>him</i>, and what he'd done. It was also apparent that
he was a little uncertain how to act. Arthur thought he detected an
expression on Seedy's face as though he wanted to be friendly, but
was frightened. At the same time his father's remark, "School broke
up yesterday," flashed through his mind. What a fool he was,
himself! He might have known that he would meet some of the
Cullington chaps there, especially Seedy, who always rushed over to
the Oval directly he got back. And perhaps there were some more of
the Cullington boys about, and Seedy was afraid of being seen with
him! He believed he would be friendly if it weren't for that. It
was very contemptible to be afraid of your own opinions. All these
thoughts passed through his mind before he heard Seedy say:</p>

<p>"Hullo, Gaffyn!"</p>

<p>That in itself was an acknowledgement of a different state of
things, for at school it was always "Moods." That's what Seedy and
most of the others called him at school. "Moods"&mdash;on account
of his preposterous remark to the form-master that he did not feel
in the mood to play cricket&mdash;a remark that seemed so
incredible and un-English that it eventually passed away among the
limbo of Cullington mythology, and was not believed.</p>

<p>The two boys looked at each other self-consciously, and it was
Arthur who came to the rescue and proved himself the man of the
world by saying:</p>

<p>"Hayward played a great game."</p>

<p>Seedy looked relieved, and answered:</p>

<p>"Corking! That was a spiffing drive over the dock!"</p>

<p>Arthur struck his shoe with his cane and blew out his
cheeks.</p>

<p>"Been beastly hot," he remarked.</p>

<p>Seedy said "Yes, beastly!" and looked in the direction of the
pavilion.</p>

<p>Arthur felt that it was necessary to relieve his friend of the
suffering he was going through on his account, so he said:</p>

<p>"Well, I must be going; got some friends coming to dinner."</p>

<p>The idea of "friends coming to dinner" was a brilliant
inspiration. It showed that he did not wish to intrude himself on
Seedy, and also that he was very much a man of the world.</p>

<p>Seedy said, "Oh, so long then; I'm looking for my cousin."</p>

<p>Arthur returned to Eccles Square feeling that an ugly cloud had
gathered on the horizon of this enchanted day. He was angry and
depressed. Was it to be always like this? Would this wretched
business be always cropping up! He felt angry with Seedy&mdash;if
the positions had been reversed he would not have behaved like
that&mdash;but more angry with fate which had side-tracked him into
this contemptible position. Seedy's attitude stung him into a
desire to show these people what he was made of. He would prove
that he had the right stuff in him, that he was, moreover, in some
ways superior to them&mdash;yes, even to Seedy, and Baynes, and the
Rook, and the judges, and the bishops, and all the rest of them. Be
damned to them! He paid his twopence on the top of the bus at
Waterloo Bridge with cheeks whose scarlet flush was not caused
entirely by the heat. He arrived home feeling sullen and
pugnacious.</p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth and Eleanor had already arrived, but he could not
face them in his present mood. The inevitable warm bath and a
change of clothes wrought a more equable frame of mind, and he went
down to the drawing-room with the incident of the afternoon but a
rankling impression.</p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth was curiously unlike Mr. Gaffyn, except for
certain formations about the chin and nose. She was very stout, and
had a round, plump face and brown eyes, and a wonderful flow of
conversation, the bulk of which was heralded by the prefix, "they
say."</p>

<p>She did not apparently indulge in any opinions of her own; her
whole mental outlook was directed by the mysterious consensus of
opinion embraced by the word "they." Perhaps the principle "they"
was the newspaper that was delivered every morning at her door. She
read it all through religiously, and held a not unpopular
superstition that anything which appeared in print was <i>ipso
facto</i> true. "They" also consisted of some half-dozen friends
and relations whom she was in the habit of meeting, and who also
read and implicitly believed in the same newspaper. It also
included Edith.</p>

<p>Edith was a Gaffyn, the most masterful, brilliant, and
successful of the Gaffyns. Aunt Elizabeth called her "cousin," but
she was indeed but a very distant relation. She came of a different
branch of the family altogether, the Shropshire Gaffyns, who
counted among their numbers a general, a knight, a member of
parliament, and even a bishop. They were presumably the original
Gaffyn stock, whereas Mr. Gaffyn's own family history was very
obscure. A student of sociological questions might have imagined
that at some time during the last generation some wayward son had
broken away from the Shropshire family tradition and wandered to
London, and married an actress; or had become an artist, or done
something else entirely disreputable.</p>

<p>Edith herself had married Robert Yardley, a very successful
consulting engineer. They lived at Bradehurst, in Surrey, and had
three young children. Edith was young, barely twenty-six, but she
expressed something of the insolent force of her tradition in her
manner, in her strong capability, and in the proprietary sway she
held over this poor and ineffectual branch of the family.</p>

<p>So great was Aunt Elizabeth's veneration for Edith that she
frequently varied her phrase "they say" with "Edith says," and
sometimes it would be "Edith says that they say," and occasionally,
"They say that Edith says."</p>

<p>On this particular evening when Arthur returned from the Oval,
he did indeed interrupt Aunt Elizabeth's dissertation to his father
on the wonderful things that "they" said about the remarkable
things that Edith said about the amazing things that Edith's
children said, but he was too immediately occupied when he entered
the room with gazing into the swimming eyes of Eleanor and thinking
to himself: "Yes, by Jove, how awfully jolly it will be to be
married to you," to follow this discourse very closely. He had a
curious feeling that Eleanor knew of what he was thinking, and that
she was blushing with pleasure at the thought of it. He looked away
and felt a little ashamed of his boldness.</p>

<p>When they were seated at dinner, Aunt Elizabeth turned the fire
of her battery upon Arthur. She said:</p>

<p>"Well, Arthur, I hear you've left school."</p>

<p>Almost automatically Arthur replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, school broke up last Monday," and he instinctively glanced
at his father, and then looked away. How Very rum! Why hadn't he
thought of that before! His father was very busy with his soup. If
Aunt Elizabeth had come before the end of the term, she would have
wanted to know why it was. Now perhaps she would never know "the
reason why." But he dreaded to be cross-examined. Of one thing he
felt certain. If it came to the point, he would have to tell. He
might prevaricate, but for some reason or other he simply could not
tell a deliberate lie in front of his father. Fortunately the
incidents of leaving school did not interest his aunt so much as
the more immediate demands of his future. She said:</p>

<p>"And what are you going to do in the world!"</p>

<p>And Arthur made the only appropriate reply:</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know, Aunt."</p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth rattled the bangles on her little plump wrist as
she negotiated the soup, and said:</p>

<p>"Well, you mustn't become like your father and never know your
own mind. Do you want to be an architect! They say architecture's
very overcrowded. Or a builder! They say building is a very good
trade to be in, if you're clever. They say there's a lot of money
to be made at it."</p>

<p>Arthur again said he didn't know, and looked at Eleanor. He felt
that the conversation was too personal and sordid to be carried on
before her. Her eyes were watching him with an intent sympathy. How
splendid it would be to have those eyes always watching him, always
reflecting his own hopes, and sorrows, and joys!</p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth was still holding forth to his father about the
building trade, and he fancied that once Mr. Gaffyn mumbled:</p>

<p>"Yes, he has a talent, I think, for drawing."</p>

<p>And Aunt Elizabeth replied:</p>

<p>"Well, I shouldn't let him be an artist, whatever you do. They
say there's no money at all in it. Look at the Pasebys. They say
Tom Paseby is one of the cleverest landscape painters in the
country, and I know, as an absolute fact, they have the greatest
difficulty to pay eighty pounds a year rent for that place of
theirs at Hammersmith. Lena has to go out and do fashion-drawing,
or typewriting, or something. Charlie goes to a common grammar
school. They say it's awful; so rough and all that. No; Edith says
she thinks you ought to make him a builder. Why, what with your
influence and that, I should think you could put him on to a lot of
good paying work, eh?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gaffyn pulled at his little tuft of beard, and Eleanor
smiled and said:</p>

<p>"I don't believe Arthur is half practical enough to be a
builder."</p>

<p>"Not practical! Fiddlesticks! He's got to be practical. Everyone
has to be practical these days. Edith says we've had too many
dreamers in our family, as it is. There was your Uncle Brian; he
went mooning round the world. They say he died out in some South
Sea island among a lot of naked savages. That was a nice thing! And
then there was Harvey; he came to no good. He was always trying one
thing and another, chopping and changing about. He never left a
penny."</p>

<p>"He may have had a very happy life," remarked Eleanor.</p>

<p>O angel! She became to Arthur at that moment more adorable and
desirable than ever. He did not hear the biting diatribe that Aunt
Elizabeth indulged in, in reply to this remark. A sudden dazzling
vision filled his mind; it was the vision of a home. He could see
the room quite clearly, a sunny white-paneled room that looked out
into a garden full of flowers. The bees were droning lazily, and
the birds were singing in praise of the glory of the day. He was
seated at the end of a polished table, his own dining-table, and
opposite to him his wife was smiling into his eyes with that
provoking mothering expression. He would be rich, of course, and
famous, and surrounded by beauty, and love, and the song of birds.
He felt a curious little stab of pride, as though he knew he were
predestined for these things. He would be in some way
exceptional.</p>

<p>"They say that Robert Yardley is making three thousand a year,
if he's making a penny. He's a clever man, if you like. My word!
yes, I should say he is. Now, there's a good line to go in
for&mdash;engineering. Of course Arthur wouldn't be clever enough
for that; besides, they say it costs a lot of money at first,
hundreds of pounds for the apprenticeship, and then it's years
before you earn anything. But I don't know; I should think one
could <i>pick up</i> building. You know; get some one else to do it
for you, and all that sort of thing&mdash;sublet it&mdash;isn't
that the expression? I shall speak to Edith about Arthur, and see
what she says."</p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth dabbed her lips with her napkin, and prepared to
go upstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Gaffyn said:</p>

<p>"If you care to see them, I could show you some of the drawings
for this new competition we're going in for. The Grimchester
Municipal Buildings."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," replied Aunt Elizabeth, waddling toward the
door, "that you waste a lot of money over these competitions, John.
Edith says that they say these competitions cost a lot of money,
and you stand a very poor chance of getting them, when all's said
and done. I should think it would be much better to get hold of
jobs privately, even if they're not such big jobs. You don't stand
the risk, and you don't have the expense."</p>

<p>Arthur saw his aunt disappearing into the studio, followed by
his father. Eleanor lingered for a moment by the door. It was the
golden opportunity. He looked at her wistfully, and could not for
the life of him think what to say. The fat-faced maid, Ada, entered
the room with a tray. He followed Eleanor to the door, and his
voice felt hard and dry as he said:</p>

<p>"Are you keen on drawings!"</p>

<p>And Eleanor was so very composed and at ease. It almost
irritated him.</p>

<p>"Why, of course I am. Uncle's drawings are always wonderful."
And she laughed kindly.</p>

<p>Arthur stuck his hands into his trousers pockets, and they went
into the big studio. Mr. Gaffyn spread the plans and elevations out
on the center table, and Aunt Elizabeth looked at them through her
spectacles, and kept on making little clicking noises with her
mouth and repeating:</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I hope you get it, I'm sure."</p>

<p>Eleanor leaned over the drawings and declared that they were
fine, and that she was sure Uncle would get the job; and Arthur
leaned on the table as near her as he dared, and watched the little
lobe of her ear with the tress of light-brown hair above it. After
that they filed upstairs again to the drawing-room, and Aunt
Elizabeth talked about rents, the indolence of work-people, the
almost uncanny intelligence of Edith's children, the movements of
various remote members of the royal household, about cuts of bacon,
and the best place to buy cork carpet.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock the ladies prepared to go, and it was only for
less than five minutes that evening that Arthur found himself alone
with Eleanor. She came downstairs ready to depart, while Aunt
Elizabeth was carrying on a whispered conversation with Mr. Gaffyn
on the second landing.</p>

<p>Arthur was in the dining-room, and he came out into the hall and
grinned at her, and Eleanor smiled at him in her kind way as she
buttoned her glove.</p>

<p>"You're off, then," was the brightest thing it occurred to him
to say.</p>

<p>Eleanor replied, "Yes, we're off. You must come over and see
us."</p>

<p>"Rather, I'd like to."</p>

<p>There was a pause; then Arthur said:</p>

<p>"How's Angela?"</p>

<p>Angela was a parrot, a bird that Arthur was not the least little
bit interested in, but it came to his mind on thinking of Aunt
Elizabeth's house.</p>

<p>"Poor Angela! She's not been at all well." Eleanor talked at
considerable length about Angela, and Arthur looked at her with his
burning eyes, and thought:

<p>"Oh, dear, I wish to goodness I could say the right thing to
you. I'm just desperate about you, can't you see?"</p>

<p>But all the time she talked about the wretched parrot, and he
was forced to reply: "Oh, I say!" or "What bad luck!"</p>

<p>It was a subject of conversation that gave absolutely no
loophole for endearing advances, and it was eventually interrupted
by the sound of the slow and painstaking process of Aunt coming
down the stairs. Arthur walked with them to the corner, and saw
them on to a bus, and Aunt Elizabeth's last words were:</p>

<p>"Well, Arthur, we must write to Edith about you. I shouldn't
hang about, though. I should start doing things. Make up your mind
firmly, and then go in and do it. That's what they say."</p>

<p>She panted on to the step of the bus, and so occupied was
Eleanor in piloting her mother through the perilous journey over
the backboard and into the body of the bus that she did not get an
opportunity of turning round and waving to Arthur. He watched it
swerving out of sight.</p>

<p>It was an unsatisfactory termination to what he had so hoped
would be an enchanting day.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;THE JUDGMENT OF EDITH</h2>

<p>Five days after the events chronicled in the last chapter,
Arthur was seated one morning at half-past ten in the dining-room,
reading a book. He was, as a matter of fact, awaiting his
breakfast. He yawned rather impatiently, and suddenly his father
came bustling into the room from the studio. They exchanged a noise
with their mouths that was their usual morning greeting if they
should happen to meet. Mr. Gaffyn went to the bureau and fussed
about with some papers. He was just about to depart when he
suddenly said over his shoulder:</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;er&mdash;Edith Yardley has written&mdash;asks you
down&mdash;might perhaps go, eh?"</p>

<p>Arthur replied:</p>

<p>"Oh! When?"</p>

<p>"She says&mdash;er&mdash;to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right."</p>

<p>Mr. Gaffyn went back to the studio, and Arthur pondered over
this latest development. By saying "might perhaps go," he knew that
his father meant that he wanted him to go. It was as near a direct
order as his father ever gave. He would certainly have to go, and
just as certainly he knew it would be an awful bore. He also knew
for what purpose he was being sent. He was to be examined,
cross-examined, and to have his mind made up for him, for Edith was
notoriously the only Gaffyn capable of making up her mind. Every
important problem in the family was submitted to her. Personally,
he detested her and everything about her, and this was a feeling
which he suspected was cordially reciprocated. However, there was
no help for it. It would have to be gone through with. He tried to
comfort himself with the reflection that, in any case, it was in
the country, which for the moment he would be glad to get back to.
And then, travelling was in itself very attractive, and he might
see something of old Yardley in the evenings. He was a decent old
chap, and could talk quite intelligently about cricket.</p>

<p>He spent the day in the usual manner, and even extended his
normal activities to the point of buying three new collars and a
shirt, and discussing exhaustively with Mrs. Stabbe the question of
whether one pair of socks would last till he returned. On the
following day he caught a train early in the afternoon, and arrived
at Bradehurst at four o'clock, where he found a trap that had been
sent to meet him. The drive took twenty minutes, for "Lorriemuir,"
the Yardleys' house, stood high on chalk soil, and commanded a fine
view across Surrey.</p>

<p>It was a large, new, red-brick and stucco building, standing in
its own grounds and surrounded by gravel paths, clumps of mixed
shrubs, and occasional oblong beds of standard roses.</p>

<p>When the trap drove up to the door, it was greeted with the loud
barking of two small dogs. And as he descended, Edith came across
the lawn to meet him. He had not seen her for nearly two years. The
Yardleys had been living at Manchester for part of that time, and
on the occasions when they came to London, he was at school. They
had only taken up residence at Bradehurst during the previous
winter.</p>

<p>Edith Yardley was a good-looking woman with brilliant coloring,
and had masses of gold-brown hair banded tightly under her hat. She
was tall and well-proportioned, and she moved briskly but without
flurry. There was something about her face a little hard, and about
her manner something more than a little imperious. She was one of
those people who instinctively take control, and whom others
instinctively obey. Men for the most part admired or feared her,
and women either adored or hated her.</p>

<p>She was wearing a white print frock that gleamed in the sun, and
from her waist was suspended a bunch of keys which jingled as she
walked. She looked like a hospital nurse, except for the straw hat
with its black velvet band.</p>

<p>She called out across the lawn, in a fresh strong voice:</p>

<p>"Well, Arthur, did you have a good journey?"</p>

<p>"She's bright, and hard, and metallic," Arthur thought, as he
replied:</p>

<p>"Oh, quite decent, thanks."</p>

<p>She called up to some one in a room upstairs, and a maid
appeared and took possession of his bag. Edith shook hands and led
him indoors.</p>

<p>"Chapple will show you your room and the bathroom," she said.
"Then come down to the dining-room. We shall be having tea quite
soon."</p>

<p>The dogs continued to bark, but on the first-floor landing this
noise was drowned by the sounds of laughter and yelling on the
other side of the door, and the disturbing truth dawned upon the
visitor that there were children! Of course he knew that Edith had
children, but he had overlooked the fact. He had never associated
with young children. He did not know how many there were, or what
they were like, and how he ought to behave to them, and he was
terrified. There appeared to be two bathrooms, one of which was
occupied. It may be observed at this point that these bathrooms
were the most impressive features to Arthur of his visit. They
appeared to be the mecca of all the conscious activity of the
place. At an incredibly early hour in the morning taps would start
running, and people would commence whistling or singing in them,
and this would continue throughout the day. Other rooms in the
house were used, but only in a vague, migratory sort of way, and
when people appeared in them, they seemed to have just come from
the bathroom, or to be just going to the bathroom.</p>

<p>Nurses and maids in new print frocks would bustle in and out
with brass cans and towels, and would wash, and splash, and scrub
either themselves or the children from dawn to midnight. And all
these attendant satellites of Edith's appeared unconsciously to
imitate her. They walked with the same sure sense of conscious
strength and superiority. They were equally cheerful, equable, and
consciously moral. During his visit Arthur came to the conclusion
that when Edith awakened in the morning at six-thirty, her first
thought was, "What uncomfortable thing can I do to-day?"</p>

<p>She had not sufficient imagination to conceive anything
dramatically uncomfortable, like wearing a hair-shirt, so she
confined herself to doing hundreds of little, fidgeting,
uncomfortable things.</p>

<p>To Arthur's mind the house was the acme of discomfort and
discord. There was not a comfortable chair in the place, except in
Mr. Yardley's smoke-room, which was kept locked. The decoration was
like a hospital; sanitary paints, oilcloth and tiles. Whatever the
weather was like, every window in the place was kept open night and
day. The children slept in the open, on the veranda, and were fed
on sterilized milk and various health foods. They were brought up
on some new system which Edith one day explained to him. It had an
Italian name, and it seemed to consist in letting them do exactly
what they liked, and in encouraging them at all times to make as
much noise as they were physically capable of. The meals were
heralded in by a crescendo of sound, the barking of dogs, the
yelling of children, and the breezy clatter of maids, culminating
in a vigorous banging on gongs; and when it came to the point,
there seemed to be nothing to justify all this noise, there being
very little to eat, except clean napkins and mysterious sections of
unattractive-looking health foods lurking behind parsley. A
paraphrase of the old school tag occurred to Arthur's mind at
lunch-time on the second day: "A great mountain is in travail, and
a ridiculous nut fritter is produced."</p>

<p>The children, moreover, found in him a splendid objective on
which to exercise various principles of their educational training.
They were at that age when it is a little difficult for an
inexperienced eye to determine sex, but he had a shrewd suspicion
that the eldest child was a girl. They were encouraged at all times
to be natural and frank, and Arthur reaped the full benefit of
this. At the very first tea this eldest child asked him if he ever
cleaned his finger-nails, and also asked him why he didn't speak
more distinctly. They pulled him about, and shouted in his ear, and
asked him endless embarrassing questions. If Edith spoke to him, he
was conscious of all their eyes being fixed upon him in critical
expectancy.</p>

<p>The eldest child&mdash;she was certainly a girl!&mdash;corrected
his pronunciation of words, and pulled him up over his facts. It
was his first experience with young children, and he had never
imagined that the good God could have created anything so heartless
and cruel.</p>

<p>He made a desperate attempt to be friendly and playful with
them, to enter into their mode of life, but he found it impossible.
He simply could not stand their noise, their excessive inane
vitality. He hated them more passionately than anything he had so
far hated. He would slink out of the house at times, harboring
vindictive ideas toward physical violence.</p>

<p>"I would like to get hold of that eldest girl," he thought once,
"and take her down the garden behind the summer-house, and bash her
in the eye."</p>

<p>It was with the greatest difficulty that he kept these criminal
instincts under control. Neither did Edith in any way tend to
ameliorate his outraged feelings. The only remarks she would make
to check this infantile hooliganism would be:</p>

<p>"Now, Gladys, my pet!" or "Be careful, darling!"</p>

<p>Breakfast was at half-past seven, and everyone was expected to
be down on time. Arthur could not for the life of him see why, as
they had nothing to do all day except wash each other, they should
start at this unreasonable hour.</p>

<p>In the morning Edith wore a print frock and an apron, and she
rattled and glittered about the house, doing all her uncomfortable
little things, washing the dogs, counting the linen, checking the
housekeeper's books, and weeding in the garden. Everything tended
to make Arthur feel a drone and an encumbrance. He tried to keep
out of the way, but he was rapidly caught up in the vortex of this
bustling life, where everyone except the children was doing their
duty so zealously and cheerfully. In fact, the whole household
seemed to have the word "duty" stamped upon its brows. Even over
the matter of the baths, Arthur was aware of a different point of
view from his own. He was in the habit of having a bath because he
derived a certain amount of sensuous enjoyment from it, but to the
Yardley household the bath was merely the symbol of the clean and
godly life. It was, in fact, <i>not right to enjoy</i> a bath;
<i>one ought to have</i> a bath, and that was the end of it. And
this view held good throughout the whole functioning of the
household. One got up early, not because one wanted to, but because
one didn't want to. Meals were not pleasant diversions; they were
medical functions where the right and proper nourishment was
administered to the blood cells. Walks were not a form of natural
enjoyment; they were calisthenic exercises for the benefit of the
mind and body, and were always taken at regular times and in the
direction of the most salubrious spot.</p>

<p>On the very first morning he was darting from one room to
another, trying to find some sanctuary from the restless aggression
of this house, when he met Edith in the hall, carrying some blinds.
She said:</p>

<p>"Arthur, I wonder whether you would mind just putting these
blinds into the rollers in the nursery?"</p>

<p>Arthur had no mechanical genius at all. He lugged the blinds
upstairs, and examined them and the fittings for half-an-hour. He
then made an effort to force the blinds in somehow, and succeeded
in pinching his fingers. After he had managed to get them in the
wrong way up, Edith came in. She smiled superciliously, and
said:</p>

<p>"You're not very practical, are you?" and with a few deft
touches of her competent fingers put the matter right.</p>

<p>She then sent him for a screw-driver and a gimlet, and told him
exactly how to fix the brackets. But he became so flustered and
irritated by the fact of her watching him that he did it all wrong
even then. And she said in her quiet voice:</p>

<p>"I expect you had better let me do it."</p>

<p>It is always galling to be made to look ridiculous, but to be
made to look ridiculous by a girl is intolerable. He went out for
what he called a "mooch." But this did not save him from further
ignominy. Edith was always finding him these little uncomfortable
jobs, things which she must have known he would not be successful
at. And he thought to himself:</p>

<p>"Damn it! she's putting me through a sort of exam; she's going
to report on me."</p>

<p>Even over that little question of the "mooch" there was trouble.
For as he came strolling up the path in time for lunch, he noticed
Edith watching him from the bathroom. As he was putting up his hat
and coat in the hall, she came downstairs, and remarked as she went
through to the dining-room with some vases:</p>

<p>"They didn't teach you to walk very well at Cullington. You
ought to hold yourself up."</p>

<p>This remark annoyed Arthur very much, and he went upstairs and
banged his bedroom door with unnecessary violence.</p>

<p>One source of disappointment at Bradehurst was the fact that Mr.
Yardley only put in an appearance twice during the ten days Arthur
stayed there. Edith said he was working very hard, and could not
often come down. On the first evening when he came home, he was
apparently dog-tired. He arrived home at half-past eight, and after
supper sat smoking a pipe, and occasionally muttering
monosyllables. He was a very big man, older than Edith, with deep
gray eyes and a sense of breadth and power about him. He blinked at
Arthur sleepily, as though he would be friendly if it weren't so
much bother.</p>

<p>Arthur was impressed by the fact that, although Mr. Yardley had
come down from town and had been working hard all day, his supper
was identical to that which the rest of the family usually had;
that is to say, it consisted of cold boiled fish, done up in some
yellow sauce, and stewed fruit and custard, and the drink was hot
water. It occurred to him as being an incongruous meal for a person
of Mr. Yardley's bulk and appearance.</p>

<p>There was something about Mr. Yardley that Arthur liked; and he
liked him especially because, when he was there, he was the only
comfortable thing in the house. He came down again on the Saturday
following, and on Sunday was apparently allowed to have his
breakfast in bed. In any case, he did not appear till nearly
lunchtime, when he strolled heavily about the garden and examined
the standard roses, as though he had seen them for the first time.
Arthur observed him from his bedroom window, whither he had gone
under the conviction that the propitious moment had arrived to
change his one pair of socks. The three children came racing out on
the lawn, pushing each other about. Mr. Yardley turned slowly and
regarded them with the same expression of wondering awe that he had
extended to the roses. They might have been the strange phenomena
of some scientific experiment, and he the professor, a little
uncertain how to account for them.</p>

<p>Edith came round the comer, carrying a basket and a pair of
scissors. Arthur heard her well-modulated voice talking to Mr.
Yardley about the flowers, and Mr. Yardley replying in his deep
purring tones. They passed under the window.</p>

<p>"That's a rum thing," thought Arthur. He wasn't very clear about
what was rum except that&mdash;well, when Mr. Yardley and Edith
passed under his window, they were quite alone. They would not know
that anyone was listening, and yet Edith spoke to him in exactly
the same voice that she employed when telling the cook not to put
onions in the vegetable pie. Arthur didn't know, but he thought:
"If yon're <i>very</i> keen on anybody, I believe you have a
different voice for them, when you're alone. I believe I wouldn't
talk like that to Eleanor, not when&mdash;when everything had come
off."</p>

<p>It was a glorious morning and he sat musing by the window,
keeping just out of sight. He wondered whether they were keen on
each other, these two. He tried to think what it would be like to
kiss Edith. He decided that it might not be bad. Despite
everything, he could understand that some one might find something
attractive about Edith. She had a lovely complexion and all that
sort of thing, and yet&mdash;she ought to be different. Was old
Yardley keen on her? It was a very funny business, all this
business of people being keen on each other.</p>

<p>On Sunday afternoon old Yardley "mooched" with him round the
garden and the lanes, and they got on famously. He talked about
cricket and boxing, and told him some amusing stories about his
grandfather, M. Jules Carbonnet.</p>

<p>On Monday morning Arthur went to the station to see him off, and
much to his surprise, just as the train was coming in, Mr. Yardley
slipped something into his hand. He had no time to comment, for the
broad back of Mr. Yardley was disappearing into a first-class
carriage, and the train had left the platform before he realized
that he was gripping the milled edge of a sovereign.</p>

<p>That evening Arthur was sitting at a table, and trying to read
and to make himself comfortable on a high-backed chair at the same
time. Edith came into the room; she spent most of her evenings
going in and out of doors. She brought a work-box and suddenly sat
down at the table deliberately opposite to Arthur, and said:</p>

<p>"Arthur, I want to talk to you about your career. Your father
has asked us for our advice. He's not very capable of making up his
mind, and there is a fact I think I ought to tell you. He is very
hard up, and it will be necessary for you to earn your own living
at once. Now the point is: what are you going to do?"</p>

<p>She threaded a needle with unerring precision, and
continued:</p>

<p>"Robert, as you know, is a very practical person, and we have
discussed you. It appears that you have some talent for drawing. Is
that so?"</p>

<p>Arthur felt himself going hot and cold, and the irresistible
desire to lose his temper expressed itself in his:</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know."</p>

<p>Edith was consciously tolerant with him. Her voice became more
suave and deliberate.</p>

<p>"All the artistic professions are, as you know, very difficult.
It might be years before you could earn your own living, and your
father is not well enough off to keep you till then. We are
writing, therefore, to suggest a compromise. Robert thinks it would
be a good idea for you to be a designer. It appears that one may
quite quickly make money at designing, if one applies oneself. And
you would thereby be able to adapt your natural talents to
commercial ends. Robert is therefore sending a letter of
introduction to Mr. Fred Blinkinshaw, of Blinkinshaw and Bepstow.
He knows the firm very well. They were the biggest decorators in
England. He is sure they will help you all they can. What do you
think about it?"</p>

<p>The principal thing he thought about it was: what on earth has
this all got to do with Edith? Why should Edith give him advice?
Why should Edith have to break it to him that his father was hard
up? Why should Edith have to work the introduction, and do
everything else? He doubted very much whether it was Mr. Yardley's
advice at all. It was probably all Edith. He looked at her, her
proud capable face frowning slightly at some linen material she was
sewing, and the lamplight silhouetting in golden streaks the heavy
masses of her fine hair. He felt an unpleasant sense of impropriety
that this girl, for she wasn't so very much more, should know all
about him, and these sordid affairs of his home life. He wriggled
in the uncomfortable chair and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know."</p>

<p>And then his mind became occupied with his father. The poor old
guv'nor! He visualized that pathetic figure spending the rest of
his days leaning over a drawing-board, or talking expansively to
McIlrane about the details of chimerical jobs that he would always
dream of getting and never get. His heart ached, and he was glad he
was going home to-morrow. Of course he would work and help his
father. He didn't want to be told by Edith what he <i>ought</i> to
do.</p>

<p>He sat there ruminating on what it meant to be a designer, when
Edith got up and left the room. As a matter of fact, she went to a
little room upstairs where there was a writing-desk, and she wrote
a letter which ran as follows:</p>

<p class="letter">My dear Bess,<br>
<br></p>

<p>We have had Arthur here for ten days and he is returning
to-morrow. I am afraid he has all the characteristics of the Gaffyn
male! And curiously enough he is in appearance rather like his
Uncle Brian, who died in the Cook Islands. I acknowledge that he is
rather good-looking in a sensuous kind of way, and he has certain
attractive manners, but for the most part he is lazy, too fond of
comfort, and hopelessly unpractical. I have talked him over with
Robert, and Robert, who always likes everyone, thinks he may be
artistic. So now I think I have an idea. I am sending you a letter
of introduction, signed by Robert, to Mr. Fred Blinkinshaw. Let us
see whether they can make a designer of him. It will be a happy
combination of art and commerce. Now it's no good talking it over
with John. He will never make up his mind. Tell him we have
discussed it, and say that Arthur is quite keen on it, and then
post the letter and get an appointment. I'm sure this will be a
good solution. We are all, as usual, very fit. Many thanks for the
recipe for chocolate shape.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Your affec.<br>
Edith.</p>

<p>On the following day Arthur returned to town. Edith came to the
gate to see him off. She said:</p>

<p>"Well, good-by, Arthur. You must come and stay with us
again."</p>

<p>And Arthur mumbled:</p>

<p>"Yes, rather."</p>

<p>At the station he purchased three penny cakes of chocolate and
two of butter-scotch from an automatic machine, and secured a
comfortable corner seat in a carriage. On the way up, he gazed out
of the window and munched his well-deserved delicacies
meditatively. Just as he arrived at the fourth packet, and the
train was rumbling through some pleasant meadow-land, he
muttered:</p>

<p>"Lord! what a cow!"</p>

<p>But whether this remark was addressed to a genuine species of
its kind which was indeed gazing abstractedly at the train, or
whether it was a mental reflection upon the character of some
person occupying his thoughts, we will not attempt to
determine.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;MESSRS. BLINKINSHAW &amp; BEPSTOW</h2>

<p>All the world knows the famous house of Blinkinshaw &amp;
Bepstow. With its huge central block of buildings in Soho, and its
equally imposing branches in Manchester, Glasgow, Paris, and
Montevideo, the tentacles of its ramifications exert their
influence in every part of the civilized globe. It combines the
laudable ambition of supplying the public with "the maximum of
taste" in furniture, decoration, and upholstery, with the silent
workings of huge financial operations. Everyone knows a Blinkinshaw
&amp; Bepstow cretonne or bedroom suite, but no one knows the
details of the vast ululations of capital that flow secretly behind
the balance-sheets of this very distinguished firm. Huge hotels
spring up, are stamped with the hall-mark of Blinkinshaw &amp;
Bepstow's crowning reputation, pass into other hands, and either
succeed or fail. Great liners ply the waters of the Atlantic and
Indian Ocean, and their proprietors are justifiably entitled to
charge the maximum rates, because their ships have been "decorated
throughout by Blinkinshaw &amp; Bepstow." To say that your house
has been done up by Blinkinshaw &amp; Bepstow is to say that you
have done the very best and the most expensive thing. You become at
once a very desirable member of society.</p>

<p>When yon enter the premises of Blinkinshaw &amp; Bepstow in
Soho, a tall military-looking man in pale-blue and gold ushers you
through a cunning arrangement of double doors, and deposits you in
a sort of large marble atrium, where you stand on a thick-pile
Turkish carpet, and blink feebly into the mysterious lights and
shadows. You are allowed a few moments to accustom yourself to your
exalted location, when a very old gentleman with snow-white hair
and gold pincenez comes forward and looks into your eye. He has a
melancholy but sympathetic expression. He seems to want to convey
the idea that your sorrows are his sorrows, that your hopes are his
hopes, that he has no other object in life than to be kind and
gentle with you. You mention some vague project, but he does not
reply. He leads you reverently into the shadows, and switches on
electric lights. You find yourself in gorgeous fitted rooms of
carved oak and tapestry; knights in armor scowl down at you from
galleries; huge Chinese vases stand dumbly for you to bow your knee
before them as you pass. You are impressed. You lose all sense of
time or social values. The mission you came on is forgotten;
neither does your cicerone remind you of it. He speaks in his
soothing, melancholy voice, and extols the fading glories of the
crafts. He becomes your brother. You are like pilgrims wandering
hand in hand in search of revelation. Your imagination riots with
the moving possibilities of it all. That Chinese lacquer bed with
the maroon hangings; how gorgeous that would look in the little
white room at home! But the dear old gentleman shakes his head.
There are tears on the brink of his eyes. He does not seem to want
to part with the lacquer bed. He touches the smooth surface
lovingly, and turns away. You feel that he is too overcome to
speak. And then your desire increases. You become passionate. You
follow him doggedly and other ideas present themselves, but at the
back of your mind is the vision of the lacquer bed. Over an inlaid
Dutch table he becomes lyrical in his quiet way, but you can tell
by his eyes that he knows how you are suffering. He, too, is
suffering, and there is a poignant moment as you hover by a Boule
cabinet. Suddenly he turns to you, and his eyes are clear, as
though the struggle is over, as though some sympathetic chord in
yourself has moved him so deeply that he is forced to make a
concession to you. You find yourself seated at a desk, writing. The
Chinese bed is yours; and everything you have is his. What does it
matter! Are you not fellow-sufferers? Is the world so pitiable a
place that a few hundred pounds one way or the other will affect
it?</p>

<p>You part from him, you don't know how, and find yourself in the
street. You walk gaily homeward, dreaming and humming snatches of
half-forgotten melodies, and it is only when the dim shadows of
evening creep over the city, and your wife says, "Did you remember
to order that ceiling paper for Lucy's bedroom?" that you realize
that there is a genius behind all the works of God and man, the
indefinable quality of getting the very uttermost out of life.
Wasn't it Carlyle who extolled this quality so profoundly!</p>

<p><br>
On a certain evening in the early autumn, Arthur found himself on
the top floor of the premises of Blinkinshaw &amp; Bepstow. He had
not passed through any of the experiences enumerated above, for
several very good reasons. One was that the firm was officially
shut, and great dust-sheets covered the more important <i>objets
d'art</i> Another was that he was there in a purely office-seeking
capacity.</p>

<p>On the other hand, his experience on the top floor was almost as
surprising and unsettling as our own on the ground floor, when we
entered to order Lucy's bedroom paper. He described it afterwards
as being "rampageous." You must picture him at that time, a
trimly-built young man with rather dark, dreamy eyes, brown hair,
and an olive skin. Under his arm he carried a small folio of
drawings made by himself at odd times, and he awaited hesitatingly
the realization of his first business appointment, to meet a Mr.
Frank Leffbury, described as the head designer of the firm. And
suddenly he found himself in an atmosphere that recalled his
schooldays gone mad. There were several large studios and smaller
studios partitioned off by wood partitions and glass windows, and
although it was late in the evening, a lot of young men were in the
large studio, some howling comic songs and others fighting with
rolls of paper. It is not at all like a business. And then he found
himself in another smaller room, with real walls and a trapdoor
leading through to the big studio, and he gazed at the back of Mr.
Leffbury, who called out in a breezy voice:</p>

<p>"Hullo! Do you want me?"</p>

<p>And he turned round, and Arthur beheld an elderly, thick-set man
with a gray beard, who at first glance gave more the impression of
being a sailor than a decorative draughtsman. He was in his shirt
sleeves and he wore a low collar and a dark blue tie. His eyes were
keen and kind behind the thick steel spectacles.</p>

<p>"My name is Gaffyn, sir," Arthur said timidly. "I have an
appointment."</p>

<p>And then the seafaring designer cried out:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I remember. Some one spoke to me about you. Come in.
Roll yourself a cigarette. No, I expect you're too young. Sit down
a moment I must get this bloody drawing settled."</p>

<p>And he called through the trap-door. It was all very
bewildering. And it did not become less so when a young man named
"Henry" entered. He was a gorgeously-appareled young man with
jet-black hair brushed right back, and he and Mr. Leffbury carried
on the most remarkable conversation Arthur had ever heard in his
life. It concerned a red-ink tracing that Mr. Leffbury was working
on, and the talk was a mixture of foul language, profanity,
ridiculous badinage, and a quite intense seriousness. Arthur was
fully convinced that under the extravagant manner of their
discourse, they really were discussing the best way to treat a
certain section of a building. At one moment Mr. Leffbury would
say: "Oh, no, my darling; where is your intelligence! Where do you
get the light for the <i>entre-sol</i>?" And at another point Henry
would tell Mr. Leffbury "not to be a bloody old fool, but to use
his gump."</p>

<p>So keen did the discussion become that they rushed out of the
room to examine some other plan, and Arthur was forgotten. He
examined some amazingly clever water-color drawings hanging on the
walls, and peeped furtively at large plans of buildings and
architectural "blues." This was a business not untouched with
romance. And then Mr. Leffbury returned, rolling a cigarette, and
he said:</p>

<p>"Now then, old chap, show me what you can do."</p>

<p>And to Arthur's surprise the head designer found virtues in his
futile drawings. There was "a nice feeling" in this, "an undeniable
quality" in an amateurish study of apple-blossoms, "a good instinct
for line" in a desperate attempt to design a repeating pattern. Mr.
Leffbury licked his cigarette, and his eyes glowed with a quiet
excitement. He talked eagerly about the great future of the crafts,
the illimitable possibilities of this studio at Blinkinshaw's, the
genius of great artists of whom Arthur had not heard, and suddenly
he remarked:</p>

<p>"Good Lord! I've got to go up to Rugby to-night. What is the
time?"</p>

<p>It was, perhaps, this remark which settled the matter in
Arthur's mind. Outside was the drone of traffic and the tooting of
horns. All around the room were scattered plans and sketches of
royal palaces, imperial institutions, colossal liners, and hotels.
They lay there in embryonic lines, vast unborn adventures awaiting
the magic touch of this little bearded man lighting his cigarette,
who remarked casually: "I've got to go up to Rugby," as though it
were the most ordinary thing in the world. In a flash Arthur felt
himself for the first time in touch with the great moving world.
Things were being done here. There was movement.</p>

<p>"I shall like this," he thought.</p>

<p>And then Mr. Leffbury said:</p>

<p>"Well, if you like to come on, Gaffyn, I can find you a little
niche. There's plenty of work, but we have a very good time. There
are no restrictions. Provided you work like a blasted slave, you
can do any old thing you like. Just hark at those devils!"</p>

<p>This latter remark referred to a noise coming from the outer
studio. Some of the young gentlemen were apparently giving
imitations of the coyote-house at the zoo.</p>

<p>Mr. Leffbury's eye alighted on a large drawing mounted on a
light wooden frame, which some one had apparently just started. He
fidgeted in front of it, as though annoyed that he could not have a
go at it. He puffed excitedly at his cigarette, and then suddenly
he turned away, and striking a theatrical attitude exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Gaffyn, in this little room we control the decorative destinies
of Europe."</p>

<p>At the same instant young Henry came bursting in again, and Mr.
Leffbury called out:</p>

<p>"Henry, isn't it a fact that in this little room we control the
decorative destinies of Europe?"</p>

<p>And the brilliant youth answered:</p>

<p>"Oh, to hell with the decorative destinies! What have you done
with my clothes-brush, Pa?"</p>

<p>The clothes-brush was found, and some tobacco borrowed, and
Henry went out. And then Arthur said boldly:</p>

<p>"I think I should like to join, if you can arrange it, sir."</p>

<p>"All right," Mr. Leffbury answered. "Come in on Wednesday, any
time you like. I shall be away to-morrow. And then I'll tell you
what to do. And for God's sake don't call me 'sir.'
Good-night!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;FRANK LEFFBURY</h2>

<p>It is not known, and it probably never will be known, except to
a favored few, that at the time when Arthur was starting on his
career&mdash;that is to say, in the late nineties&mdash;a certain
man made a great and heroic effort to revolutionize the crafts in
London. His ambition was nothing less than to introduce something
of the spirit of the medieval gilds into the arena of commercial
London; to instil into the minds of an influential crowd of
materialists the enthusiasm for an ideal, the complete submergence
of the individual in the interests of society, the sense of
fellowship and cooperation conspiring toward a common search for
beauty; something of the spirit that raised the spires of
Westminster and Amiens. And some who knew him very well were amazed
not that he failed, but that he came so near succeeding, and that
the reason of the failure was not attributable to the outside
forces which opposed him, and which, indeed, he almost mastered,
but to disloyalty and abuse of privilege from within.</p>

<p>The man who made this heroic effort was a man quite unknown to
the general public, the employee of a large firm, and his name was
Prank Leffbury.</p>

<p>He was one of a family of seven children of a poor bootmaker in
Leicester. The father died when he was nine, and he was the second
son. His elder brother, who was thirteen, was found work in a
printing-house, and at the age of ten Frank was taken from school
and employed by the Midland Timber Corporation at their wharf on
the canal. He, and his brother, and his mother, who took in the
neighbors' washing, managed to support themselves and the younger
children for two years. At the Midland Timber Corporation's wharf
Frank's work was purely mechanical, assisting the men in loading
and unloading, running across the yards with messages, and holding
the planks for the great saws. But, as he afterward confessed, it
was here that he fell under the spell of his first love&mdash;wood!
He got to like the smell of it, the sight of it, the possibilities
of it. He spent long hours in the firm's sample room, and in a
short time found no difficulty in differentiating between East
India satin-wood and West India satin-wood, and the various kinds
of bird's-eye maple. He learned the capacities of wood, and their
whims and eccentricities. There was, moreover, a world of romance
in the cases that showed the veneers from strange trees in
different parts of the world.</p>

<p>"It was wood," he said to Arthur one day, "that first gave me
the lust to know other things. And as a matter of fact, you cannot
have a much better subject to start on than wood, which has been
one of the best friends to man. I remember that it was one day
during the lunch-hour on the wharf, after I had been examining the
grain of a fine specimen of sycamore that had just come in, that
the great idea came to me. It had been raining, and suddenly the
sun came out. I was looking at the canal and thinking of the
wonderful journey of the sycamore, and its history and romance,
when I became imbued with the great desire not only to know all
about woods, but to know all about everything else. I made up my
mind that I would acquire all knowledge, everything! Everything
there is to learn I would set out to learn. I would read all the
books that had ever been written. I would find out just exactly why
everything is, and what it is, and wherefore. I was ten years old
then." He sighed, and added, "I am now an old man and I haven't
learned very much, but I thank God I can still go on learning."</p>

<p>During the short time he had spent at the national school he had
not been taught to read, except the very simplest words, so he
devoted his spare moments to drawing. He used to draw the barges on
the canal, and the timber yards and the mills. At the age of twelve
he had an accident, losing two fingers of his left hand in the
machinery. He spent three months in the Leicester Infirmary, and a
man in the bed next to him taught him a little about reading. His
mother used to call and complain about the difficulties of
supporting the family without his help. Before he left the
infirmary a plague of typhoid broke out in the town, and two of his
younger sisters died. When he returned home he found the family in
dire straits. He went back to the timber yard for a few months, and
then his mother decided to take the family up to London. A cousin
at Walthamstow had offers his eldest brother a situation in his
shop, which was a stationer's and small printer's, and it was
thought that the third brother, who was now eleven, might make
himself useful there. Mrs. Leffbury could get employment in a
laundry, and there would probably be no difficulty about finding
work for Frank.</p>

<p>The family arrived at Walthamstow on a bleak day in November,
and occupied two rooms and a lavatory, which the cousin had been
kind enough to secure for them. On the following morning his mother
told Frank he had better go out and find work. He thought the
matter over, and decided that he would most likely find employment
in some trade where his knowledge of timber might be of use. He
wandered about till he came to a builder's and timber merchant's,
but they did not require assistance. He tried one or two other
places without success. On the way back he observed a small
cabinetmaker's shop. He went in, and a gaunt old man in an apron
and steel-framed spectacles came forward.</p>

<p>"Do you want an assistant, sir?" Frank asked.</p>

<p>The old man shook his head and started to move away, and Frank
turned to the door. By the side of the door was a plank of polished
birch. As the old man was only two or three yards away, Frank
remarked:</p>

<p>"That's a nice piece of birch."</p>

<p>The old man looked at him with his melancholy eyes and said:</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"I say that's a nice piece of birch."</p>

<p>"What do you know about birch, my boy?"</p>

<p>"I know something about birch, and also teak, and hazel, and
oak, and mahogany; in fact, most of them."</p>

<p>The old man gazed at the small boy, rubbed his brow and
said:</p>

<p>"H'm."</p>

<p>Then he looked round his shop with a bewildered expression, and
asked:</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about joinery!"</p>

<p>And Frank said:</p>

<p>"Yes, a bit."</p>

<p>The old man beckoned to him to come into a room at the back.
Fixed on a winch was the framework of the lower structure of a
Boule cabinet He was evidently in difficulties. He was restoring
the cabinet, but getting into trouble with the veneers.</p>

<p>"You've got an interesting job there," said the small boy.</p>

<p>The old man explained the difficulties of the problem in a
doubtful voice, as though he thought it was a waste of time. But at
the end of his discourse Frank said:</p>

<p>"I can tell you where I think you're wrong, Mr. Brackett."</p>

<p>And he explained at length what <i>he</i> would do under the
circumstances.</p>

<p>The old man muttered "H'm" at intervals, and took off his
spectacles, and wiped them, and put them back again. When the
discussion was finished he sat wearily on a chair, and looked at
Frank.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" he said.</p>

<p>"Frank Leffbury."</p>

<p>"H'm." He thought for a long time, but eventually rose and
leaning against a small, black, iron, fireplace, expectorated
gloomily into the meager grate.</p>

<p>"I might try you for a bit," he said at last.</p>

<p>They went back again into the shop, and after very careful
deliberation Mr. Brackett agreed that Frank should come for a week
on trial. Then, if satisfactory, he should receive eight shillings
a week "to make himself generally useful."</p>

<p>Frank went, proved generally useful, and stayed with old
Brackett for nine years.</p>

<p><br>
It was in some respects a very satisfactory period. Old Brackett
employed no one else, except occasionally when there was a great
rush of work, as, for instance, the demand for a coffin. He himself
had a fair, but rather limited knowledge of his profession. He
taught Frank a certain amount, but for the most part he had to find
things out for himself. He worked at Mr. Brackett's from eight in
the morning till six in the evening, and every evening he went to
the Polytechnic, attending the antique, life, and design classes,
and occasionally going to lectures.</p>

<p>Mr. Brackett was a Baptist, a very religious man, and extremely
conscientious about all his business dealings. He raised Frank's
salary at regular intervals, and at the age of twenty-one he was
receiving twenty-three shillings a week. It was as well that he had
attained this princely income, for the maintenance of his family
fell more and more upon him. His elder brother married a girl from
a tobacconist's shop and went to live in Streatham, and his mother
developed such attacks of rheumatism that she became almost a
cripple. The third brother had made no startling success after his
entry into the stationery world, and the youngest was still too
young to earn money. Of the two girls, now aged twelve and
fourteen, the eldest had also been drafted into the stationery
business, but the younger stayed at home to wait on her mother.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-one, restless desires and ambitions took
possession of Frank, and he had almost decided to make a plunge
into some more adventurous mode of life and to leave Mr. Brackett,
when that gentleman solved the difficulty for him by dying, being
buried in one of his own coffins. It was a misfit, a coffin he had
made for a local tripe-dresser, but unfortunately he had taken the
wrong dimensions. Frank Leffbury did not find any great difficulty
in securing employment, for he had by that time developed into a
really brilliant draughtsman, and he had all the mechanical
knowledge of the cabinet-making trade at his back, also. He
eventually took a situation at Prothero's, a small decorator in
Bayswater. He received a salary of thirty shillings a week, but out
of this he had to pay his fare to and from Walthamstow; also to
wear a clean shirt at least once a week, and a clean collar at
least twice a week. He stayed there a year, and then quarreled with
Mr. Prothero about the design of a paneled room. He left one
evening in a rage and never returned.</p>

<p>For twelve years after that he lived the life of a journeyman
draughtsman, moving about from one firm to another. He acquired the
reputation of being a very good designer, but a very difficult man
to deal with. He was, indeed, restless and dissatisfied. And his
dissatisfaction was not confined entirely to material things. The
material did certainly weigh heavily upon him. He was always
vaguely desiring happier conditions of life, a better home and
furniture, the chance to travel, freedom for himself; but always
these longings were suppressed or crushed by the insistent demands
for the immediate material support of his family.</p>

<p>But this was not all. He came at that time under the influence
of William Morris and other pioneers struggling for the spiritual
freedom of the masses. He visited the Fabian Society, and talked
with people whose ambitions were evolutionary. He was appalled by
the realization of the social conditions from which he had sprung,
and among which he earned his daily bread. He was torn between the
overpowering claims of the artist and the reformer. He wanted to do
something really big, not just to earn money. He went on working,
and studying, and hoping. At the age of thirty-three his ambition
"to acquire all knowledge" had, in any case, reached the point
where he was acknowledged to have one of the most retentive
memories in London for architectural detail. He was a complete
authority on decorative style; he was a very clever mathematician
and took a delight in conic sections and algebraic speculations; he
had studied physics and the theory of light; he knew something of
Egyptology and, for some reason or other, had studied subaqueous
plant life; and he could tell you how the Chaldeans built their
temples of reeds. He could, moreover, speak French and German, and
had read <i>Don Quixote</i> in Spanish. As a friend of Mr.
Blinkinshaw's remarked one day, "If that man Leffbury had ever had
any education, he might have been quite a clever man."</p>

<p>He was, in fact, not only a clever man, but a very remarkable
one, and, like a great many other remarkable men, the texture of
his life was curiously uneven. He had great ideals and ambitions,
and at the same time yielded to ridiculous vices and weaknesses.
Normally of a temperate disposition, he would occasionally get
riotously drunk. As far as everyone knew, he led a clean
life&mdash;in fact, there could be no doubt of it; one had only to
look at his sane, healthy face&mdash;and yet he had an
uncontrollable liking for filthy and improper stories, of which he
possessed an unlimited repertoire. His language was at all times
colored by extravagant and indecent terms, and he had a nice turn
for profanity.</p>

<p>As he grew older this side of his character became emphasized,
and he also developed moods when it was impossible to know how far
he was acting, and how far he was being sincere. At the age of
thirty-four he was head of a studio in Manchester, where he lived
for ten years. It was at that time that he came into touch with Mr.
Fred Blinkinshaw.</p>

<p>The Blinkinshaws had started a small cabinet-making and
upholstery business in the suburbs of Manchester, when an uncle of
Fred and James Blinkinshaw died and left the two brothers fifteen
hundred pounds each. They immediately moved their business to a
more central position, and at the end of three years were one of
the flourishing houses of Manchester. James was frankly a
materialist, what Mr. Leffbury called "one of the claws and talons
crowd," but Fred, was a man with imagination. He met Frank
Leffbury, and marked him down as a man to be secured by his firm.
James did not see the necessity&mdash;it was an unnecessary
expense&mdash;but Fred, despite his more imaginative disposition,
had the greater force of character, and he won the day. They
approached Leffbury, and he was engaged as their head designer at a
salary of three hundred and fifty pounds a year, a considerable sum
at that time.</p>

<p>The result was almost immediately successful, and the
Blinkinshaws secured some good contracts in competition. At the end
of six years Blinkinshaw &amp; Co. was one of the biggest concerns
in the north of England, and Mr. Fred cast his eye longingly on
London. There was considerable misgiving about this, James being
terrified at the risk, but eventually Fred got in touch with a Mr.
Septimus Bepstow, who ran a large wholesale house for the
manufacture and sale of brass beds and bedroom furniture, in the
East End. He was also an ambitious man, and he had considerable
capital. There were many board meetings and discussions, but
eventually Blinkinshaw &amp; Bepstow took an old Georgian house in
Soho, and started business. Prank Leffbury was again appointed
chief designer. The concern wobbled for several years, till the
imaginative Fred came to the conclusion that the thing was not
being done on a big enough scale. By some means unknown to anyone
but himself, he persuaded a well-known nobleman, who was a
notorious speculator, to invest a huge sum of money in the
business, and it became a limited liability company. Large
factories were erected in the suburbs, and vast sums were spent on
advertising. In a few years the Blinkinshaw &amp; Bepstow "note" in
decoration became a byword throughout the land. All the biggest
contracts came into their hands, and the Georgian house in Soho was
extended till it occupied the whole of two blocks.</p>

<p>At the age of fifty-three Frank Leffbury found himself the chief
of a staff of twenty-five designers working for one of the biggest
limited liability companies in Europe. But in the meantime he had
passed through many mental vicissitudes. All his sympathies were
with the theory of cooperative workmanship. He detested these big
commercial enterprises like poison. He had assisted at the
launching of the arts and crafts movement, and was a member of the
Art Workers' Gild. He found himself, almost reluctantly, in a
position of power, and the receiver of the colossal salary of five
hundred pounds a year. It was a larger sum of money than had ever
been paid to a designer before, but his conscience told him it was
something in the nature of a bribe. He would have liked to have
broken away and to have been a free-lance again, but he seemed to
be held as in a vise by the conditions which surrounded him. His
mother had become bedridden, his two sisters were still dependent
on him, and he had to move the family to a house in St. John's
wood. He had to work like a slave, and he knew not the meaning of
the word "liberty."</p>

<p><br>
One night in the summer he was working alone in his room at the top
of the building in Soho, when a feeling of depression came over
him. He had been to an exhibition of the arts and crafts during his
lunch-hour. There were, perhaps, twenty people in the building,
examining the somewhat futile exhibits. He was thinking about this,
and of the hopelessness of the movement. The window was open and
outside he could hear the dull roar of London, like the growl of a
beast of prey. The contact of these two impressions operated on him
in a queer way. The growl of the beast was like the mighty,
irresistible roar of commercialism, and the memory of the Arts and
Crafts Exhibition like the pale ghost of some hapless idea. He
stood up, leaned out of the window and lighted a cigarette.</p>

<p>Suddenly a phrase came to his lips in the way that a phrase will
sometimes come to a person of a certain type of creative genius,
before the thought which created the phrase has had time to very
clearly formulate itself. The phrase which occurred to Frank
Leffbury was:</p>

<p>"Why not start from the other end!"</p>

<p>It was odd, but this very simple and laconic query eame to him
in the light of a revelation. He peered eagerly into the street,
and watched the lights flitting hither and thither.</p>

<p>"Why not start from the other end?"</p>

<p>It was so absurdly simple! He was fifty-three years old, and it
had not occurred to him before. Trying to put it concisely to
himself, it amounted to this:</p>

<p>"Instead of trying to oppose commercialism, why not use
commercialism? Commercialism is a fact, deep-rooted in the lives of
the people, ineradicable. The arts and crafts movement is an
excrescence on society. It has nothing to do with the fundamental
purposes of being."</p>

<p>He puffed fiercely at his cigarette, and the simplicity of the
idea dazzled him. The hour and the man was peculiarly opportune.
Blinkinshaw &amp; Bepstow was not only a big firm, but they
promised to monopolize the entire decorative industry of the
country. They had already bought out two very old and
well-established firms in the city, and it was rumored that the
Blinkinshaws privately held large quantities of shares in firms who
were their reputed rivals. It was on the road to becoming a corner
in the trade. The strength of his own position was undeniable. He
knew that the Blinkinshaws knew that no one could take his place.
He commenced to dream and to formulate his scheme. His scheme,
roughly speaking, amounted to this: He would form a spiritual
commonwealth within a material oligarchy.</p>

<p>He would gradually build up around him a coterie of men imbued
with his own altruistic views. There would be no violent and
dramatic dnouements. The thing would work itself. The whole system
would find itself permeated with the doctrine of the fellowship of
man, and they would go forward in a reverent search for beauty. So
strong would the position of this coterie become that they would
gradually be able to force into working order some of the rules of
the ancient gilds. There would be a revival of the apprenticeship
system. There would be mutual cooperation. Men would be taught
their trade thoroughly and efficiently. There would be sick
benefits and pensions, and the opportunity for study and travel,
and eventually there would be co-partnership. The Blinkinshaws
would be swamped, and a gild in its truest sense would be
formed.</p>

<p>However fantastic these ideas may appear to an outsider, Mr.
Leffbury must be given the credit of believing them practicable,
and he must also be given the credit of having no personal ambition
in the matter at all. On that night when he listened to "the growl
of the beast," he visualized the day when the beast should growl to
a more melodic phrase, and he pictured himself, when the reeds were
piping to the happier England, creeping away among the shadows,
unknown but desperately happy.</p>

<p>He turned to the pencil elevation on his bench and muttered:</p>

<p>"I shall never get this bloody drawing done to-night; that's
certain!"</p>

<p>Such was the man under whose aegis Arthur commenced his
professional career.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII&mdash;THE DESIGNER</h2>

<p>The syllabus of study which Mr. Leffbury drew up for Arthur
consisted of the following: Two days a week he was to spend in the
studio at Blinkinshaw &amp; Bepstow's, making tracings and doing
any work he was capable of, and observing closely the work which
was going on. On the other four working days he was to go to South
Kensington Museum and make sketches in pencil and color, and also
drawings to scale of such objects as Mr. Leffbury suggested. On two
evenings a week he was to attend an architectural class at the
Regent Street Polytechnic, and on two evenings a life-class. On
Thursday evening he was to attend some lectures on historic
ornament, and on Saturday a cabinet-making class. On Sundays he was
advised to go out into the country and sketch, and in his spare
moments he was to read everything he could get hold
of&mdash;scientific books, essays, lives of the painters, history,
biology, fiction, the newspapers, and reviews. He was, moreover, to
keep his mind alert for impressions, and to train his memory, and
above all things, to keep cheerful.</p>

<p>He found the last instruction the easiest to follow, for he
started out on this professional pilgrimage with buoyant spirits.
He certainly felt rather bewildered by the variety of the manifold
activities he was to pursue, and he would at moments wonder, when
he was doing a certain thing, whether he ought not to be doing
something else. But it was all amazingly exciting. He was to be a
citizen in the best sense of the term. He would eventually be
independent and would be able to help his father, be as insulting
as he liked to Edith, and marry Eleanor. The affair of the penknife
would be forgotten, and he would become great and successful, and
people would look up to him. He found the atmosphere of
Blinkinshaw's extremely entertaining, and the studio reminded him
of a glorified school. They were nearly all very young men, with
the exception of Mr. Leffbury, and there was the same schoolboy
spirit of ragging, and fooling, and noise going on all day. But
there was the added glory of independence. Many of the young men
were getting quite large salaries, and they dressed like Piccadilly
club-men. They took cabs, lunched at expensive restaurants, and
took girls to the music-hall in the evening. They would turn up for
work in the morning, and boast of the previous evening's
adventures, being rather proud of looking washed-out and exhausted.
He soon found among them a remarkable variety of character.</p>

<p>There was the brilliant youth, "Henry," whose other name was
Waldren. He had tremendous animal spirits, and drew divinely, but
he gave Arthur the impression of being shallow and insincere. There
was George Arthur, a Scotsman, with rather a cruel, sensual face,
who made most astoundingly clever water-color drawings. There was a
young man with a smooth child-like face, named Bertram White. He
was reputed to be the cleverest designer in the firm, next to Mr.
Leffbury, and was in charge of one section of the studio. Despite
the innocence of his appearance, he was notoriously the heaviest
drinker in the place. There was a very tall boy, named Hazell, who
was also clever and who also drank. There was a Yorkshireman, named
Levistock, with dark hair and olive skin, who nurtured a sullen
resentment against the whole social system. He would sit on his
high stool, and fidget with his pencil, and growl about the tyranny
of capital all day. There was Jimmy Long, a round-faced, gladsome
creature, always pursuing the chimera of what he called "life."
There were two Frenchmen, named Tonquet and Luneville. They were
employed principally on French interiors, or what the rest of the
studio called "the lousy Louis'." They seemed rather bewildered by
the boisterous atmosphere of the place, but Tonquet made himself
popular with his imitations, which were very good. He could imitate
birds and animals, and water running down a sink, and wood being
sawed. Luneville was of a more melancholy disposition, but he was
greatly admired not only on account of his work which was
excellent, but on account of his exhaustive knowledge of obstetrics
and other unmentionable subjects. There was a Swede named Larsen,
who spoke very little English, but who gave amazing exhibitions of
feats of strength. And there were many others that it took Arthur a
long time to individualize.</p>

<p>The life and liberty in that studio seemed an incredible thing
for a business house to tolerate. There was apparently no rule
beyond the fact that the work was done. And the work was indeed
very well done, and always on time. The whole studio would
occasionally work all night, if a big contract were being competed
for. But apart from that, the young men were at liberty to keep
their own hours. They could smoke, sing, swear, wear ridiculous
clothes, go out for drinks or meals as often and as long as they
liked, fight with rolls of paper, give imitations of leading
actors, have moods, telephone to chorus girls; everything was
tolerated as long as the work was done. This was all part of the
system instituted by Mr. Leffbury.</p>

<p>The heads of the firm knew, of course, the kind of life that was
led upstairs, and it is known that many stormy board meetings took
place with regard to it. Mr. James Blinkinshaw and the other
directors wanted to have the same rules of punctuality and behavior
apply to the studio as to the rest of the establishment, but Mr.
Fred supported Mr. Leffbury.</p>

<p>"You have to remember, gentlemen," he once remarked at a board
meeting, "the success of this firm is primarily due to the studio,
to the craftsman. I acknowledge that this man Leffbury is a madman,
but the point is: he gets the work done. The number of skilled
draftsmen is limited, and we have the pick of the bunch. If we lose
Leffbury, one of our rivals will get him, and probably some of the
other designers will follow him. And then you have to remember," he
added, smiling indulgently, "these men are&mdash;er&mdash;artists
in a sort of way. This&mdash;er&mdash;lack of
discipline&mdash;shall we call it?&mdash;is perhaps one of the
peculiarities of the artistic temperament."</p>

<p>The board laughed at this extravagant statement, and Mr. James
Blinkinshaw exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Artistic fiddlesticks! This is a business, not a
bear-garden."</p>

<p>Nevertheless Mr. Fred carried the day, and Leffbury was allowed
to conduct the "bear-garden" on his own lines.</p>

<p>Arthur found the contrast between the noisy vitality of the
Blinkinshaw studio and the austere seclusion of South Kensington
very striking. This was in the days before the new and somewhat
commonplace building, which at present houses the finest collection
of works of art in the world, had been erected. It is true that in
those days the corridors were badly lighted, and the central courts
were dim, but there was a peculiar mystery and fascination about
the place, which has since been spirited away. Arthur soon learned
to love the museum. He loved the silence of it, and the heavy
chiaroscuro of corridors filled with furniture and plaster casts;
the sense of beauty brooding across the centuries and transfixed in
little passages of wood, and stone, and ivory, and damask. These
objects, imprisoned in their cases or resting dumbly against the
walls, seemed eloquent of a common purpose. And on certain days in
the autumn when a heaviness was in the air, he would wander forth
and meet the ghosts who fashioned them. They would come whispering
through the galleries in the polyglot garments of past centuries,
with all their loves, and hatreds, and passions that moved them in
their day forgotten, and only their lips moving in a kind of
worship.</p>

<p>He remembered once coming across a woman's workbox made in the
seventeenth century. It was exquisitely embroidered in colored silk
needlework, and partially padded. There were some quaint formal
figures representing the story of Hagar and Ishmael, and the color
had faded to an almost uniform tone. Arthur could not account for
it, but the box produced in him a peculiar feeling of tenderness,
and every time he passed it he was conscious of little thrills of
vibrating emotion. Who was the dear ghost who haunted the work-box?
And what was she to him, or he to her?</p>

<p>The museum was filled with these ghosts; and more especially did
he like the little fragments of things, for they were the most
ghost-ridden. Torn pieces of tapestry, broken sections of
architraves, an incomplete caryatid, a Roman base without the
column; in these things there was little left but the
indestructible spirit. It was as though the great heart of the
world reached out to them across the centuries, and would not let
them go.</p>

<p>He loved the color of things, color that had been burnished by
the sun of Italy and Arabia, color evolved from the molten furnaces
at Limoges, the color of Chinese porcelain, the color of Persian
rugs. What was it about color that stirred the emotions! Why did
the vision of a combination of colors in a certain rug or on a
painted plaque set his pulses throbbing, while another combination
left him cold and indifferent?</p>

<p>It was very exciting, the threshold of this new life! He was no
longer a schoolboy; he was a man. He would develop and express
himself for what he was worth. At Blinkinshaw's there was the great
lure of the living world, the promise of wealth, cleverness,
dazzling but obscure possibilities, the commanding figure of Mr.
Leffbury, and the varied attractive qualities of the other men. At
the museum there was the great lure of the dead world with its
undying whispers.</p>

<p>Between these two centers four years of his life passed rapidly.
By a sort of algebraic progression he was gradually drawn away from
the dead world to the living world; that is to say, by Mr.
Leffbury's system of instruction he gradually ceded days from
museum study to the practical work of the Blinkinshaw studio, till
at the end of that period his whole time was at the disposal of the
firm. But it must be acknowledged that as this progression worked
toward its inevitable conclusion, his own state of mental happiness
did not develop in a parallel degree. Notwithstanding the stimulus
of vitality at Blinkinshaw's, he began at the end of that time to
develop moods of dissatisfaction there which he did not experience
in the museum. He made progress as a designer, but showed more
promise as a colorist than as a practical draftsman. He divided his
companionship between Levistock, who talked of "the tyranny of
capital," and Jimmy Long, who quoted Omar Khayyam.</p>

<p>He learned to smoke cigarettes, and to swear, and to talk about
politics and women. He shaved, wore high collars, and fell in love
promiscuously, and once desperately with a girl called Myra
Henness, a student from South Kensington School. She was a small,
pert, little thing, with very bright coloring, and she wore short
hair and a <i>jubbah</i>. He spent many restless days and nights on
her account, and they ambled round the museum together, and giggled
and pushed each other surreptitiously. Once he told her about the
work-box and how it affected him, and she laughed and said:</p>

<p>"You're <i>too</i> funny."</p>

<p>And curiously enough, he thought at the time that it was rather
attractive, the way she said this. It was not till he visited her
home at Notting Hill one Sunday afternoon that the disillusionment
came. Alas! for the cruelty of youth! He met her three sisters and
her mother. The sisters were like Myra, only their legs were too
short for their bodies, or their bodies were too long for their
legs, whichever way you like to conceive this unfortunate physical
defect. In any case, the appearance of these sisters reacted on him
disastrously. Myra appeared to him after that less like a girl than
like a species, and a species of an almost repelling kind. The
mother, also, was unpleasantly suggestive of what Myra would be
like in thirty-five years' time. He avoided her, and spent his
Sundays sketching barges up the river.</p>

<p>He continued to live with his father, who took an absorbing but
uncritical interest in his work. He talked at great length about
his drawings, and the objects he had drawn and studied, but he gave
no opinion upon their merits, or made any reference to his career
and future. He never asked questions about his comings and goings,
or proffered advice upon any subject at all. He was even apparently
unaware whether Arthur received a salary or not. In any case, at
the end of that time Arthur was receiving a pound a week from
Blinkinshaw, and he had nothing to spend it on except himself,
although it was very evident that the Eccles Square establishment
was being run on most parsimonious lines. Scores of times it
occurred to Arthur that he ought to suggest that he contribute to
the household expenses, but when it came to the point, he simply
could not bring himself to speak of such a matter to his father.
The very mention of such a thing would be too embarrassing and
painful. It would be cruelty to his parent. And so they continued
their daily companionship without any show of affection, and with
all the finer impulses of mental communion suppressed.</p>

<p><br>
It was not till nearly the end of this fourth year that a series of
little disillusionments combined to weld him into a normal state of
restlessness and discontent. It expressed itself succinctly in a
remark he suddenly made one day to Levistock:</p>

<p>"I don't see what all this bally business of bedroom suites and
machine-made papers has got to do with art."</p>

<p>The profession he had slipped into appeared to him as a naked
means to an end, a way of making money in one of the least
objectionable ways, but nothing more. And something told him that
this was not, and never would be, satisfying.</p>

<p>Sometimes at odd moments in the museum, inspired by the
contemplation of the work of medieval craftsmen, of French weavers,
and Italian silversmiths, and the spirit of the painter-priests who
depicted the Passion of Christ on a little gilt diptych in the
thirteenth century, he felt thrilled with the desire to "go and do
likewise." But when he was brought up against the actual conditions
which prevailed in a studio turning out drawings for a modern
limited liability company, the whole thing went to pieces. The
buoyant optimism of his early days was strangled by the realization
of the cynical attitude of his fellow-workers.</p>

<p>Gradually he discovered that the dignified exterior of
Blinkinshaw's was only a veneer. It covered the old wormwood of
commercialism with a cynical impressiveness. The swarms of
well-dressed salesmen who had the management of the work in their
hands, were utterly ignorant and unscrupulous. They had no other
ideas than that of making the work pay the uttermost farthing, of
putting in "shoddy" wherever it could be managed without showing,
of introducing faked material where real material had been paid
for, of beating down the subcontractors and the workmen so that in
the end they could show a good profit on the job in their statement
to Mr. James and Mr. Fred Blinkinshaw. These gentlemen would be in
and out of the gorgeous bar of the "Queen of Rumania" all day long,
drinking and standing each other whiskies and sodas, arranging
secret "deals" and "dos." On the occasions when Arthur visited this
alluring establishment he would observe them leaning heavily
against the bar or whispering together in the corners, and the
remarks which reached him were always of this nature: "I got him by
the short hairs, dear boy"; "I can put you on to a very cheap line
in hardware. A friend of mine&mdash;"; "If you could introduce Mr.
So-and-so to me, I'd make it all right for you over that&mdash;";
"Well, I'll tell you what I'll do; I'll share the commission with
you if you 11 persuade &mdash;&mdash; to place that order for lino
with &mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"These are the men," thought Arthur, "who really have 'the
decorative destinies of Europe' in their hands."</p>

<p>And then he learned that the rare antique furniture was mostly
made at Walthamstow. It was one of the jokes of the firm, and the
dear old gentleman who sold it with tears in his voice had the
reputation of being the cutest salesman in London. The
disillusionment in regard to the studio took longer to detect, but
in its effect was even more disturbing than the other. He soon
found that in spite of all the cleverness and plausibility of these
young men, there was no loyalty to Mr. Leffbury, and no loyalty to
an idea. Every man was for himself, and there was the rumor of a
plot by Bertram White and Waldren to usurp Mr. Leffbury and to get
the control of the studio in their own hands. He could not analyze
his own feelings in the matter. He wanted to get on himself and to
be successful, but something told him that that was not and never
would be everything. He could not define the quality of his
discontent, but he knew that it was there, like a stranded
thing.</p>

<p>But still he went on, for the reason that there was no
alternative, and indeed this spirit of discontent did not permeate
all his days. He had the divine recompense of youth and an
uncrushable faith in Mr. Leffbury.</p>

<p>In company with Jimmy Long he discovered the delights of the
little French and Italian restaurants in Soho. It was Jimmy who
suggested the inspiring institution of sharing a bottle of Beaune
between them for their lunch, and they would return to the studio
in a roaring state of optimism. Sometimes they would go to
Pollini's to dinner in the evening, and afterwards visit a
music-hall, or sit over their coffee and talk. They would talk
about art, and socialism, and the chaps at Blinkinshaw's and Mr.
Leffbury and his ideas, and foreign countries, and free trade, and
musical comedies, and eventually and always about women. Jimmy was
a companionable little beast, an averred sensualist, but by no
means a fool. He was older than Arthur, and these four years gave
him a patriarchal right to lay bare his impressions, and to impart
his records of successful enterprises in the dubious pursuit of the
erotic passion.</p>

<p>That phase of life was very exciting. Somewhere in the world
there was at that moment, walking quietly and unknowingly, that
woman, that divine and wonderful person who was going to dovetail
with all the vague desires of his heart. His eyes were always
searching for her in the crowd.</p>

<p>Often after lunch these young men would stroll down Regent
Street arm in arm, with their hats at jaunty angles. And there they
would see the most adorable women of every description, walking
briskly or looking into shop-windows, their little chins and noses
peeping from under most alluring head-gear. Some of these would be
alone, but they were invariably the sort who just glanced at our
cavaliers and then hurried by. And those that did look, and even
grinned at them&mdash;well, both these young men held very decided
views about women of that sort.</p>

<p>"Besides," as Jimmy remarked one day, "they're usually so damned
unattractive."</p>

<p>Occasionally at a music-hall they would look down from some
dizzy elevation upon visions of inaccessible loveliness. To the
strains of disturbing music, beauty would hold out her arms in her
great central appeal. The young men would hold their breath and
gaze mesmerized across the unbridgeable spaces. The world seemed
controlled by some ironic Tantalus creating unnecessary
allurements, and chaining the feet of heroes out of their
reach.</p>

<p>And as Arthur found the conditions of his professional life more
and more disillusioning, the closer did he hug his ideal of
womanhood. He would wander down the Brompton Road at times and look
in the antique shops. And he would think to himself:</p>

<p>"One day I shall buy that old shawl for her, and that little
oval mirror to place upon her dressing-table. Perhaps she will come
along here with me, and we will choose some of that videt glass to
place upon our sideboard."</p>

<p>Sometimes perverse moods would come to him, sullen desires for
expression. If she should prove inaccessible! Society had such
cunning arrangements. However dearly one loved a woman, when it
came to the point one practically had to buy her. One had to have
money, to be a social entity. And all this was very difficult and
ill-regulated. It was the James Blinkinshaws who could afford to
buy.</p>

<p>One day in spring he walked across the park. The rhododendrons
were out, and there was a feeling of movement in the air. A
carriage swung round the corner by the Achilles statue. In it sat a
finely dressed woman. Her face was proud and insolent, and
provokingly beautiful. She gave the boy a half-glance of disdain
and looked away. The thought flashed through his mind:</p>

<p>"I'd like to have you, and break you."</p>

<p>He had the momentary prescience of some hour when he would face
a woman like that, as proud, and disdainful, and beautiful as she.
And he would be proud, too. It would be a competition of pride and
strength, and he would triumph.</p>

<p>He spent his summer holidays with Aunt Elizabeth and Eleanor.
His father was always to come, but failed to turn up at the last
moment, owing to "some urgent Work he could not leave."</p>

<p>As time went on he discovered grave deficiencies in Eleanor. She
was kind and lovable, but he probed her and found a point where
things became vacant and unsatisfying. She was not the lady of the
work-box, who haunted his dreams.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;SELF-EXPRESSION</h2>

<p>During those years which preceded the South African War there
was a great wave of industrial prosperity in London, and the house
of Blinkinshaw &amp; Bepstow rode flamboyantly on the crest of that
wave. Nothing seemed to go wrong. Nearly every big competition they
entered was secured. The contracts that the firm had in hand must
have amounted to several millions of pounds. Salaries were
increased, the studio was enlarged, and extravagance was the order
of the day. And yet it cannot be said that as the line of fortune
took this upward curve the spirits of our hero made a corresponding
sweep. In fact, they seemed to take a diametrically opposite
course.</p>

<p>School-life had inured him to a certain amount of immoral talk
and profanity, but what depressed him was the underlying keynote of
cynical indifference. Nobody cared. Every man was for himself. Not
only was there a lack of loyalty to "Pa" Leffbury, but he and his
ideas were the secret butt of endless obscene mirth. Moreover, the
fashion of excessive drinking increased as the prosperity of the
firm became more assured. It was a known fact that many of the
salesmen would drink anywhere from fifteen to twenty whiskies and
sodas during the day, and the drinking was not confined to the
salesmen. The young gentlemen of the brush and pencil held their
own. It became the fashion to boast of one's physical capacity for
consuming alcohol. The laurels of prowess in this direction passed
from one brow to another; from the ingenuous-looking Bertram White
to Henry Waldren, from Henry Waldren to Hazell, from Hazell to a
very charming young gentleman from Budapest, named Kaponyi, who
invariably arrived in the morning holding his head and saying:</p>

<p>"Gott! vot a night it vas!"</p>

<p>The tilting of glasses, and the whispering and scheming would
commence in the bar of "The Queen of Rumania" at eleven o'clock in
the morning, and would continue until this delectable place of
refreshment closed its doors reluctantly at half past twelve
o'clock at night.</p>

<p>The only satisfaction Arthur derived from having to earn his
living in this atmosphere was the sardonic reflection that Edith
was responsible for his introduction into it.</p>

<p>And the only note of relief amid these disintegrating forces was
the figure of Frank Leffbury. He appeared strangely impervious to
the shallowness and insincerity of his associates, as though by the
force of his personality he could move mountains. He stood there
like a good mariner in a treacherous sea, with his eye upon the
compass and his trust in the crew. It seemed to matter to him less
whether a contract was secured, or whether people were scheming to
overthrow him, than whether the section of a certain cornice were a
thing of beauty. He insisted on believing in everyone, and in the
validity of his ideals.</p>

<p>Arthur asked Levistock one day his opinion of him, and the
reformer said:</p>

<p>"Leffbury's all right, only he's a sanguinary fool. He's trying
to run with the commercial hounds and hunt with the idealistic
hares. He's trying to graft the ideals of St. Francis on the fangs
of a man-eating tiger. He doesn't stand a dog's chance of
succeeding."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't he succeed?" said Arthur.</p>

<p>"For a hundred and one reasons. And the principal one is, you
can't have a revolution in the crafts without having a
corresponding revolution in society. He's starting at the wrong
end. The first thing we've got to have is what Shaw asks
for&mdash;equal distribution of wealth, every man, woman, or child,
irrespective of age, sex, or character, to have an equal wage, and
the abolition of private property. Then you can begin to talk about
ideals."</p>

<p>They were in the museum at the time, and Levistock peered at
some old Spanish ironwork and sighed.</p>

<p>"Does it ever strike you how ridiculous it is that we should
have a museum at all? All these things ought to be in the homes of
the people, but instead of that, it's considered so remarkable to
see a beautiful thing, a decent piece of wrought-iron, for
instance, that one has to put it in a museum, and people come and
stare at it open-mouthed. They starve and underpay the people, and
then they erect a place like this, and stuff it full with decent
things, and then they say: 'Look what we are doing for you, you
dirty dogs! We're helping you and educating you. We're showing you
what you ought to have in your own homes.' Whereas the swine know
all the time that the very commercial conditions which they impose
make it impossible for the people to produce these things in their
homes. It's like leading a muzzled dog up to a juicy bone."</p>

<p>The reformer blew his nose, and Arthur took this opportunity of
interjecting:</p>

<p>"But the museum belongs to the people."</p>

<p>Levistock grinned superciliously and, stuffing his rather grubby
handkerchief into his sleeve, replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, and so does the army, and the navy, and the general
post-office, and Hampstead Heath and the crown jewels! How does it
help them? What's the good of owning India and Australia, if the
baby at home is starving?"</p>

<p>This struck Arthur at the moment as being such a dazzling
argument, he could think of nothing to reply.</p>

<p>The pendulum of their discussion swung backward and forward.
Arthur was by no means convinced by the arguments of his colleague,
but he was undoubtedly impressed, and his impressions were further
accentuated by certain visits which they paid together to the more
squalid regions of Walham Green and Hammersmith. Levistock,
moreover, provided him with printed matter giving figures of the
appalling pauperism in the East End of London, particulars of the
sweating, and low wages, and the spread of vice and disease. On the
other hand, he was furnished with the details of the rent-roll of
certain dukes and landowners who held the very districts where
these appalling conditions prevailed. And the knowledge of these
things depressed him intensely.</p>

<p>One afternoon Mr. Leffbury accompanied Arthur to the museum.
They went for the purpose of taking notes of Italian doorways for
the design of a conrtyard that was to be added to the house of a
wealthy manufacturer in Yorkshire. The said gentleman, seeing
nothing incongruous in introducing to the bleak moors architecture
designed for a sunny clime, and having the money to pay for it, the
work was to be done "as per instructions."</p>

<p>It was a humid day in April, and Mr. Leffbury was in one of his
perverse moods. He spoke very little to Arthur as they went along
on the top of a bus, except to use language with regard to the
Yorkshire manufacturer that was almost as humid as the day.</p>

<p>In the museum he gradually calmed down, and they strolled about
among the carved doorways, and wellheads, and fonts, and examined
the "Gates of Paradise" of Lorenzo Ghiberti. Then suddenly his mood
changed, and he talked about Italy, where he had never been,
excitedly. And he said to Arthur:</p>

<p>"Go to Italy while you're young, Arthur. None of these things
are any good to you when you're old."</p>

<p>He looked at a low relief by Donatello, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"My God! what pigmies we are! Just look at this! Doesn't it make
you despair? See how the forms emphasize the lines of the
architectural setting. Do you note how the old devil gets his
deepest shadows just where the light is strongest? Look at these
dancing girls! Aren't they darlings! And yet you don't want to love
one individually. They take their place too well. It's the whole
thing you love. How the word nature has become abused. Imagine this
treated by Jacques, the R.A. You would find five, pretty,
realistic, chorus-girls. You would immediately debate within
yourself which one you would like to take out to supper. You
wouldn't see it as a whole. It would just express the academic
nimbleness of the lecherous, well-fed Jacques. When you go to
Italy, Arthur, keep this in mind, think of yourself. Express
yourself. Don't be mesmerized by reputation, or by what people call
'nature.' Did you tell me you were going to Italy?"</p>

<p>Arthur said "No" rather breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Strange! Perhaps I dreamt it, or there was something about you
associable with the Donatello relief."</p>

<p>He talked about Italy very vividly, just as though he had been
there. He talked about the bambini on the foundling hospital in
Florence, and about other Delia Robbias, and about the Church of
San Miniato, and Fiesole, and the pavements in Sienna, and Venice
at night-time, and Naples in the spring. And Arthur became very
excited, and kept on thinking to himself:</p>

<p>"I shall go to Italy while I'm young."</p>

<p>So intimate and confidential did Mr. Leffbury become that Arthur
became bold enough to lead him to the work-box, and to tell him
about the peculiar way it affected him. Mr. Leffbury looked at him
quickly, and after a pause said:</p>

<p>"Arthur, you have one of those faces that the world will love to
torture."</p>

<p>He became silent after that, and then sighed and suggested that
they should go and have some tea. They went out into the Exhibition
Road and walked down toward South Kensington station, where there
was a teashop. It was getting dark, and as they walked along Mr.
Leffbury said ruminatively:</p>

<p>"Everybody has a work-box handed them when they enter this silly
business we call 'life.' Everything else is puzzling,
incomprehensible. But about the work-box there can be no mistake.
It's put in our hands. And when we die, we leave it behind. And
others follow on, and take up the work-box. The things we make are
scattered, but the work-box remains. And so those others who come
after us know us less by what we made than by the love that we
imparted to the making."</p>

<p>He again paused, and then added: "I can well believe in your
lady of the work-box. The ghosts that hang around work are the most
insistent of all."</p>

<p>As they crossed the road Arthur looked at his chief's face. It
was pinched and worn by a life of struggle with uncongenial
surroundings. He was getting old. In another environment and with
better opportunities he might have been one of the world's
recognized successes. He had more brains, character, and
imagination than the majority of men, and yet the verdict of
Levistock was the general verdict: "Old Leffbury's a sanguinary
fool." They all thought that. They laughed at him behind his
back.</p>

<p>And as Arthur glanced at him, his heart was touched with pity
and pride. Pity for the pathetic figure of the man, and pride that
suddenly, with one little sentence, he should have lifted the veil
and given a glimpse of his soul to Arthur.</p>

<p>"The love that we impart to the making."</p>

<p>A wonderful secret to carry through one's life! And what did the
James Blinkinshaws care; or the shallow draftsmen; or the salesmen
with their unquenchable thirst? "I can put you on to a good thing,
dear boy, if you'll introduce me to So-and-so."</p>

<p>At the door of Blinkinshaw's they parted, and Arthur ran into
Jimmy Long.</p>

<p>"Hullo," cried Jimmy. "Where have you been? I've got a hell of a
hump. Come and have a drink."</p>

<p>"I've been to the museum with Pa," Arthur replied.</p>

<p>"Oh. Was the old man amusing? Tell me something amusing, for
God's sake!"</p>

<p>"Yes. He was in quite good form."</p>

<p>Arthur found himself let into the bar of "The Queen of Rumania";
and Jimmy calling for "two gins and bitters. Miss Parkisson."</p>

<p>He sipped the gin and glanced round the bar, where the usual
crowd had congregated. Some men were having oysters and stout, and
others drinking port wine and sherry. Arthur involuntarily wondered
how much a week these men spent on these comforts, and how much
they allowed their wives for housekeeping. The cold greenish light,
and the glittering mirrors and blood-red mahogany, and the two
great pale blue Doulton-ware vases of hideous design suddenly
brought home to him the sordid ugliness of this atmosphere. He
touched Jimmy's arm, and said:</p>

<p>"Let's go somewhere else. I can't stand this place."</p>

<p>"All right, my lad."</p>

<p>They strolled out and went into Oxford Street. Arthur was still
quivering with a strange sense of excitement. He wanted to talk. He
said:</p>

<p>"Let's go and feed at Pollini's. I want some red Italian
wine."</p>

<p>"Right-o. You haven't told me what the old man said."</p>

<p>"Oh, he talked about all sorts of things. He said he thought I
was going to Italy."</p>

<p>"You're not, are you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. I may go one day soon."</p>

<p>This seemed so interesting a proposition that Jimmy insisted on
having another gin and bitters in the bar of Pollini's, and they
eventually entered that gay establishment with a walk not devoid of
swagger. They sat near the band and ordered chops and a bottle of
Beaune. Under the influence of these good things and the moving
strains of waltz music, the multiple activities of Arthur's
sentient being rioted exceedingly. He became extremely garrulous.
He looked into the eye of his friend, and realized for the first
time that he was the dearest chap in the world. The room was an
enchanted place. They toasted each other, and swore undying
friendship. They glanced at the other tables, where incredibly
beautiful women dreamed into the eyes of their lovers, or sparkled
with a genial appreciation of the splendid glamor of this life. The
remarks that Mr. Leffbury had made to him became diffused by the
riotous interplay of the senses. Much that he had said became
transcendent, and the rest was gloriously obscure. But he kept on
thinking to himself:</p>

<p>"I'm not going to tell Jimmy everything he said. It was, in a
sort of way, sacred."</p>

<p>But he talked of Italy. Before the Beaune was finished he had
definitely invited Jimmy to accompany him the following year to
Italy. They would go to Paris, and Monaco, Bordighera, Genoa, and
so on down to the south. Then to Sicily "to see the Byzantine
stuff," and perhaps go across to Egypt and up the Nile, and return
through Algeria, Morocco, and Spain. There would be art, music,
adventures, red wine, and romance.</p>

<p>They moved to a recess and had coffee and a liqueur, and pursued
luxuriously the wild helter-skelter of their thoughts. They lost
the sense of time and place, and became intently conscious of the
consuming fires of an idolatrous present. It was absorbing,
tremendous. Jimmy suddenly got up, and said he had just caught
sight of a friend he wanted to speak to. Arthur beheld him talking
to a lady with dark hair, near the door. He laughed.</p>

<p>"What a devil Jimmy is," he thought indulgently. He seemed to be
rather a long time, so he gave him up at last and went out into the
street.</p>

<p><br>
He spoke genially to several people in the street about anything
that came into his head, and was told by a lady in Oxford Street to
"go and fry his silly, shiny face." He took this speech in very
good part and laughed uproariously, and eventually managed to find
his right bus. As he sped along in the night air, he recollected
that his father was away. He and McIlrane had gone off in pursuit
of some elusive job in the north of England.</p>

<p>"What an old rascal Jimmy is!" he thought again.</p>

<p>Nearly all those chaps did that sort of thing. Well, well, what
did the old man say? Express yourself. Yes, he would do that. He
felt peculiarly virile and unself-conscious to-night. Thank God for
youth! He would not grow up and become like Pa Leffbury. He would
not reach the other's age without going to Italy and experiencing
all those things which are the prerogative of youth. As he
descended from the bus, the various thoughts that had raced through
his mind on the journey began to crystallize into one concrete
idea.</p>

<p>"That rascal Jimmy!" "Go while you're young!" "Express
yourself!" And then came the reflection that his father was away.
The concrete idea concerned the Welsh maid, Ada. She slept in a
room on the top floor, and Mrs. Stabbe slept in a room on the floor
below.</p>

<p>When he let himself in his heart was beating rapidly. The house
was all in darkness. There was no sound but the rhythmic tick of
the hall clock. He hung up his hat and coat, took off his boots,
and crept upstairs.</p>

<p>"I've seen her looking at me slyly, in such-and-such a manner,"
he thought to himself. Images raced through his brain. Little
expressions and postures that he had hardly noticed at the time.
They became pregnant with meaning. He stole into his bedroom,
leaving the door ajar. He laughed softly to himself, and put on a
dressing-gown. He was very much himself to-night, a dynamic force
demanding expression. He went out again on to the landing. The
clock still ticked and in the distance traffic rumbled; someone was
whistling for a cab. On the opposite side of the landing was his
father's bedroom door, a ponderous dark thing that might have been
open or shut. He went by it without looking, but half-way up the
next flight of stairs, he had to turn and peer back at it. And then
he crept back and passed his hand over the face of it. Yes, it was
shut. He started off again, but with less confidence. On the floor
above he listened outside Mrs. Stabbe's room. He fancied he
detected the faint sound of heavy breathing. He passed on, but his
eye could not help straining over the bannisters to see the angle
of that door below.</p>

<p>"Curse the ghosts that haunt these inanimate things!" he thought
testily.</p>

<p>He reached the top landing. Opposite to him was the door of
Ada's bedroom. He was shivering with a nervous agitation. He looked
down the staircase once more. He almost expected to hear the door
creak, and his father come out. He could almost hear the tones of
his gentle voice:</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;who is that?"</p>

<p>But he knew that his father was not there. And then he began to
see that it would really be easier if his father <i>were</i> there.
That shut and silent door! It was so like his father, who had never
said, "Arthur, do this or do that"; who had only been like a
sentinel on the outskirts of his life, silently watching,
expressing nothing, but exerting a deathless influence.</p>

<p>"These others who come after know us by the love that we
impart."</p>

<p>He gave a little cry and crept downstairs again. As he did so,
he thought he heard a door on the top landing open stealthily and
then close. When he reached his own landing the house was again
silent, except for the grandfather clock below, solemnly ticking,
like some insatiable monster devouring the fateful seconds that
would never return.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX&mdash;"RACING AWAY INTO THE UNKNOWN"</h2>

<p>One day in the early summer a disturbing disruption took place
in the house in Eecles Square. Since Mr. Gaffyn's return from the
north of England it was apparent that something had gone wrong. He
had seemed more abstracted and restless than ever. Edith turned up
in one of her most masterful moods. She took temporary possession
of the household. The maid, Ada, was dismissed, and the upper part
of the house was let to an auctioneer and his wife. Mrs. Stabbe,
Mr. Gaffyn, and Arthur were confined to the ground floor and the
basement, and the expenses of the establishment were reduced to a
minimum. Edith spent rather less than a week effecting this
reorganization, and before she left she took Arthur aside and said
that, as she believed he was now receiving twenty-five shillings a
week, his father thought that he might contribute ten shillings a
week to the household expenses, and perhaps he would hand this over
to Mrs. Stabbe every Saturday.</p>

<p>The suggestion made Arthur furious, for the reason that he was
certain that his father had never thought anything of the kind, and
also because it was what he had wanted to suggest himself for a
long time, but had never been able to bring himself to the point;
and lastly, because it was just like Edith's "managingness" to come
butting in and telling him what he ought to do. As though the
family couldn't arrange a little thing like that without her
interference!</p>

<p>He said, "Oh, all right," in a voice that must have conveyed the
idea that he very much resented parting with ten shillings a week,
whereas he had already made a mental resolution that he would make
it fifteen.</p>

<p>It was a curious feature about the relationship of this family
that Mr. Gaffyn never appealed directly to Edith about anything. If
there was some matter which disturbed him and about which he could
not make up his mind, he always asked Aunt Elizabeth to call. And
then he would hint at it in a vague, sketchy manner, beginning his
sentences in the middle. Aunt Elizabeth would talk the matter over
and sleep on it, and then get Eleanor to write a letter to Edith,
and Edith would act instantly and deliberately, without consulting
anyone, although she had a way of talking to the others as though
it was all their idea.</p>

<p>When the family gathered together Mr. Gaffyn still had the habit
of addressing Elizabeth, who would repeat exactly what he had said,
only with more completed sentences. Edith would say nothing until
he interjected:</p>

<p>"Better, perhaps&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then Edth would say:</p>

<p>"Why, of course that would be an excellent idea." And then she
would set forth what the idea was, and Mr. Gaffyn would believe
implicitly that it was his idea, and so in a way it would be, for
Edith had the genius to know what it was that Mr. Gaffyn would
probably want to do, if he could but formulate the resolution in
his mind.</p>

<p>The domestic upheaval affected Mr. Gaffyn considerably. He
seemed worried and distraught. Arthur did not know whether his
father was aware that he contributed his fifteen shillings a week
to the house, but he noticed that at times Mr. Gaffyn regarded him
with a kind of nervous anxiety. He would occasionally fidget about
the dining-room after meals, as though he were going to speak to
Arthur about something personal. He would even get as far as:</p>

<p>"You&mdash;er&mdash;I want&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then he would fly off at a tangent, and make some safe
remark about general matters.</p>

<p>After a little while, however, the household in this more
restricted manner settled down to a normal state of affairs.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, almost exactly a year later that the sudden and
tragic event occurred which severed forever all chance of a more
tangible understanding between these two.</p>

<p><br>
Arthur had been attending some lectures on the Italian Renaissance,
and he returned home one evening about half-past ten from one of
these. As he let himself in, he noticed that the light was on in
the dining-room. This was rather unusual, for his father invariably
dined at half-past seven and then spent the rest of the evening in
the studio. "Perhaps he has a visitor," he thought.</p>

<p>He did not hurry. He hung up his hat and coat, and then went and
washed. After that, as he did not hear a sounds he opened the
dining-room door quickly and peeped in. A strange sight met his
gaze. The dinner had been cleared away, and the table was littered
with papers. His father was sitting huddled up on a chair by the
fireplace and apparently doing nothing. The boy had an immediate
presentiment of some calamity. He ran forward and touched his
father's shoulder, but the elder man did not speak. He gave an
almost inaudible moan and continued to gaze on the floor.</p>

<p>Arthur rushed to the staircase and called down to Mrs. Stabbe in
the basement.</p>

<p>That lady came bustling up, the contagion of alarm depicted on
her white face.</p>

<p>Between them they helped Mr. Gaffyn across the passage to his
bedroom. He hardly appeared to know them, but he murmured once very
softly:</p>

<p>"No, no, please don't trouble! No, no, it's&mdash;quite all
right."</p>

<p>Arthur rushed across the square and had the good fortune to
catch a doctor who had just returned from a visit. He was a young
Jewish doctor, named Schultz. He came at once. When he had examined
the patient it was only necessary to glance at the doctor's face to
see that the affair was critical.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stabbe was crying. She said:</p>

<p>"O Lord, sir, I was afraid of something. The master seemed so
queer. He called me after dinner and got me and Mr. Alcott from
upstairs to witness his signature to some papers. One paper was his
will, sir," she added in a whisper.</p>

<p>During the rest of that night and the five days which followed,
the mind of Arthur became focused on the central terrifying
fact&mdash;his father was dying. He became dimly conscious of other
people and incidents happening around him, but they were only
shadows emphasizing the main issue. He was aware of Aunt Elizabeth
and Eleanor being constantly present with their help and sympathy.
He was aware of the young Jewish doctor, with his pale face and
dark hair, who struck him as being too temperamental for a doctor.
He gave more evidence of emotion than anyone. He was aware of Edith
arriving on the following afternoon, and by some means or other
converting the house into a professional hospital in the course of
a few hours. He was aware of the arrival of a competent-looking
hospital nurse, and of the enormously helpful genius of Mrs.
Stabbe, who rose to the occasion in an incredible manner.</p>

<p>Other people were there vaguely. McIlrane darting furtively in
and out of the studio and looking scared; several old friends. But
all these people had little reality. The central fact itself had
little reality until that ominous evening of the fifth day. He was
in his father's bedroom, and the nurse was standing by the bed. His
father was breathing in a peculiar way, and the young Jewish doctor
arrived. He stooped down by the bed and made some observations.
Then he came over to the gas-fire, next to Arthur. They stood there
silently a long time, watching the figure on the bed. Then suddenly
the doctor said in a dreamy voice:</p>

<p>"Racing away into the unknown."</p>

<p>It was not till that moment that the truth stood out naked and
relentless. He tried to steady himself, and said:</p>

<p>"I suppose it is so."</p>

<p>The young doctor patted his shoulder and turned away.</p>

<p>After a pause, Arthur followed him and whispered:</p>

<p>"Will he ever be conscious again?"</p>

<p>And the doctor replied:</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not in this world."</p>

<p>He looked at Arthur sympathetically, and then turned and spoke
to the nurse.</p>

<p>He went into the next room and found Aunt Elizabeth crying.
Eleanor came up to him and kissed him. He kissed her in return, and
was conscious of a little thrill of comfort. Edith was writing
letters at a desk, and there was no sound but the scratching of her
pen and the gentle sobbing of Aunt Elizabeth. After a time the
young doctor came in. He went straight up to Edith and said:</p>

<p>"I think I will call Dr. Pellescourt. It will be more
satisfactory for everyone."</p>

<p>Edith nodded her head and said:</p>

<p>"Yes. Very well. Do so, then."</p>

<p>She licked the edge of an envelope, and the doctor fidgeted
nervously with his watch-chain, and went out. Arthur went across
the landing again and looked at his father. There was no apparent
change. He felt that he could not stand the strain of that peculiar
breathing. He returned once more to his relatives. Four times
during the ensuing half-hour he wandered to the bedroom and back.
Then the bell rang. There was a sound of some one speaking in the
hall. The young doctor came nervously across the passage, followed
by an elderly man with a pointed beard and a heavy tread. They went
straight into the bedroom. Arthur did not move. They seemed to be
there an interminable time. At last they both returned and came
into the sitting-room. The younger doctor introduced the elder man
to Edith. He said:</p>

<p>"This is Dr. Pellescourt."</p>

<p>The elder man nodded casually, but not unkindly, at the rest of
the room. He looked tired and rather bored. One gathered that it
was not an interesting case. Eleanor darted across to him and
said:</p>

<p>"Do you think there is any hope, doctor?"</p>

<p>The elder man looked at her rather peevishly and answered:</p>

<p>"Everything possible is being done."</p>

<p>He went out into the hall, and the younger man whispered
something to Edith. Edith immediately sat down, wrote a check and
gave it to him. The younger man went into the hall, and the door
slammed. There was another long silence. The auctioneer who
occupied the upper part of the house came home. Arthur heard
McIlrane creeping across the hall and whispering to him, and then
the auctioneer saying:</p>

<p>"Dear! dear!"</p>

<p>He went upstairs on tiptoe. In a few moments there was the smell
of food being cooked. The auctioneer and his wife were preparing
their supper. At half-past ten Edith said:</p>

<p>"I don't think there is any need for you and Eleanor to stop,
Bess. There is nothing you can do. I will stay here to-night. I
will sleep on this sofa."</p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth cried once more, and was persuaded to have a
little brandy and water. She and Eleanor took their departure.</p>

<p>When they had gone, Edith said:</p>

<p>"You might as well lie down, Arthur. I will call you if it is
necessary."</p>

<p>Arthur did not answer. He stood staring at the fire. He went in
once more to see his father. It was very painful. He did not feel
like crying. He felt horrified. After a time he returned to the
sitting-room and drank some brandy. He heard McIlrane go out of the
front door, and Mrs. Stabbe bolting the shutters in the basement.
It became much stiller after that. He could hear his father from
the sitting-room. There was no one now but the nurse, and Edith,
and himself. Edith produced some knitting. She again said:</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better go to bed, Arthur? There's no point in
sitting up. I will call you if it is necessary."</p>

<p>He looked at Edith. "She is doing her duty," he thought. He
watched her fingers, almost fascinated by their dexterous
movements. Without saying anything, he eventually went into his
bedroom, and lay on the bed. He was trembling. He felt that there
was no question of sleep.</p>

<p>"Racing out into the unknown!" The phrase recurred to him again
and again. What did it mean? Was there really anything after? The
episodes of the week rushed through his mind. The night when he had
come home and found his father in the peculiar position by the
fireplace, with all the papers scattered on the table. And Mrs.
Stabbe's prescience of fatality, because she had been called in to
witness the signature to a will. And then the arrival of the
doctor, and the desperate effort it required to make up one's mind
what to do next. He remembered that he almost automatically sent a
telegram to Edith, even before despatching one to Aunt Elizabeth.
Very vividly he remembered the arrival of McIlrane at nine o'clock
in the morning, and the peculiar way he seemed quite unable to
realize what it meant. He remembered Mellrane saying, after he had
explained the position to him as well as possible:</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry. H'm! well, well. I suppose I'd better not
consult him about that template that Higgs &amp; Hanwell have sent
us, instead of sending it straight to the surveyor at Brinton
Marsh."</p>

<p>McIlrane had never been able to realize the seriousness of the
whole thing. He seemed to look upon it as some ridiculous
interruption to the fine artistic intimacy he shared with Mr.
Gaffyn. He looked at the others rather suspiciously. He kept on
going in and out of the studio and standing in the hall, as though
he expected some one to come out and say:</p>

<p>"It's all right. You can go in now."</p>

<p>And during those days and nights Arthur had stood mostly in his
father's bedroom, listening to the terrible sound of his breathing.
Mr. Gaffyn had been conscious at times, and Arthur had waited
patiently, ready to snatch at any comfort, or at any sign of a
disposal to speak. On the afternoon of the third day he had been
leaning over a chair by the gas-fire, when he happened to look up.
And suddenly he realized that his father was looking at him
intently. His clear gray eyes were wistful and childish, and
strangely enough he did not look away.</p>

<p>Instinctively Arthur walked across to the bed, and touched his
father's hand.</p>

<p>His father continued to gaze at him, and perhaps for the first
time in their lives these two continued to look at each other
without self -consciousness.</p>

<p>Arthur lowered his head and said:</p>

<p>"Father!"</p>

<p>Mr. Gaffyn had seemed to try and speak, but the boy could not
catch what he said. Then suddenly he had shut his eyes and gripped
Arthur's wrist. His hands seemed abnormally bony and cold. He
pinched the boy's flesh with the flat part of his hand, but the
fingers had no grip. Then he had seemed to shiver and become
comatose. The nurse had come into the room and busied herself with
some preparation. The patient had not opened his eyes again that
day in Arthur's presence. On the fourth and fifth days he had
opened his eyes, but to Arthur's grief he obviously did not see
him. He just stared upward and occasionally muttered to himself
incoherently. He was already in some world of his own. He was
occupied with images the vision of which no living thing could
share. And then to-night had come that sudden portent:</p>

<p>"Racing away into the unknown."</p>

<p><br>
The boy was utterly exhausted. It had all come so suddenly and
terribly that he could not grasp the significance of it. He was
simply aware of a nameless horror which he was too worn-out to
face. Within a few minutes of resting his head on the pillow he
fell into a restless slumber. This slumber seemed to last a very
short time, when something chilling brought him back with a start.
His eyes became aware that it was already daylight, and, moreover,
that a cold hand was pressed against his brow. He started up.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>In the dim room he realized that Edith was leaning over his bed,
and that he was wrapped in an eider-down coverlet. Her clear voice
was saying:</p>

<p>"Arthur, we did not wake you. He never regained consciousness.
It was quite peaceful."</p>

<p>He jumped from the bed, and gasped:</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>He pushed by her and out into the passage, and entered his
father's room. The light, filtering through the blind, revealed
that grim and definite acknowledgment of the Central Fact. The
gas-stove was out. All the medicine bottles had already been
cleared from the small table by the side of the bed. They would not
be required again. The nurse was asleep in the next room. His
father was lying with his eyes closed, and his face looking
incredibly young and beautiful. But perhaps the fact that struck
the boy more than anything was that all the clothes had been
removed, except one sheet. The window was open and it seemed
intensely cold. He felt inclined to cry out:</p>

<p>"But he'll be cold! How frightfully cold it is! Are you quite
sure? Isn't it somehow unnecessary to do all this so quickly!"</p>

<p>He felt curiously angry with Edith. It was so characteristic of
her. Why did she always come interfering and doing things in this
way? The cold-blooded thoroughness jarred his nerves. He wanted to
give way to the floods of passionate grief that were pouring
through his heart, but he stood there atrophied, shivering. He
became aware of a heavy coat being put over his shoulders, and
Edith's voice saying:</p>

<p>"Arthur, you must be very brave. It is all for the best."</p>

<p>His teeth chattered, and yet he could not cry. Suddenly he felt
an arm round his shoulders, and Edith's cool firm lips pressed
against his cheek.</p>

<p>"You mustn't stand here, Arthur dear. You will catch a cold.
Come into the other room, and I will make you some tea."</p>

<p>He continued shivering, and allowed himself to be led into the
sitting-room. The fire was burning brightly, and the nurse was
sleeping on the sofa. He sat in the easy-chair by the fire. Almost
against his will his eyes followed Edith about the room. What an
extraordinary woman she was! She had been up all night. She had not
changed her frock, and yet she looked perfectly fresh and calm. She
moved with brisk, deliberate movements to the tray on the
side-table, and then took the tea-caddy from the cupboard. The
kettle was already simmering on the fire, and in a few minutes a
cup of tea was thrust into his hands. The nurse continued sleeping,
and Edith went to the desk, and began writing letters. It was very
silent, and he became aware of the clock ticking in the hall. It
reminded him of a certain night, the night when he nearly took
advantage of his father's absence. He wondered whether his father
was listening to that tick, and whether he knew now what had passed
in Arthur's heart.</p>

<p>Soon began the manifold signs of the day's normal activities.
The clatter of milk-carts, the whistling of errand-boys, the buzz
of traffic, some letters falling into the box. Everything would go
on just the same. Presently there was the faint sound of sizzling,
and the smell of bacon being fried. The Alcotts upstairs were
preparing their breakfast. Edith went below and awakened Mrs.
Stabbe, who had been busy too, during the night while Arthur slept.
At nine o'clock McIlrane came, and Edith led him through the studio
and shut the door. In a little while he came out on tiptoe and left
the house, and as he passed through the hall Arthur heard him
sobbing like a child.</p>

<p>All day long Arthur sat by the fire, or moved restlessly from
one room to another. And all day long Edith untiringly coped with
the various problems and situations which arose. Aunt Elizabeth and
Eleanor arrived at ten o'clock, and shed tears on Arthur's face,
but he did not respond. He stood there, dazed and curiously
dependent on Edith. She made him eat, go out and send some
telegrams, and buy some stamps. At odd moments he found her looking
at him in a queer, wistful way. She did not give him anything
difficult to do, but she encouraged him to be occupied, and would
not leave him alone for long. Numerous people called during the
day, including another cousin whom Arthur had forgotten, named
Walter Gaffyn. He was a chartered accountant, a small man with a
dark mustache, and as he entered the hall Arthur heard him say to
Edith:</p>

<p>"I say, this is a bad business! Dear, dear! I <i>am</i>
sorry!"</p>

<p>He demanded full medical details, seemed rather disagreeable and
was plainly irritated by the whole thing. He was very anxious to
know when the funeral would be, as he had arranged to take his wife
to Bognor for the week-end. He was boisterously friendly to Arthur,
and cried out:</p>

<p>"Why, it's years since I saw you, Arthur! How you've grown!
Getting on all right in business? You're in the furnishing line,
aren't you? You must come over and see us. We're always in on
Sunday evenings."</p>

<p>He slapped Arthur's back, and took his departure.</p>

<p>Mr. Edwin Beck called. He was apparently Mr. Gaffyn's solicitor.
He spent some time in the bedroom talking to Edith. Then he entered
the sitting-room and made a remark to Aunt Elizabeth that amounted
to the original reflection that "in the midst of Life we are with
Death." He shook Arthur's hand and said:</p>

<p>"Please accept my deepest condolences. I shall hope to see you
on Saturday."</p>

<p>He then took some papers out of the desk, and also his
departure.</p>

<p><br>
This strange dream went on for days till the funeral was over. All
sorts of people came and went. People whom he did not know came and
pressed his hand, and proved to him by a glance of the eye that
they understood. Others whom he did know proved by a glance of the
eye that they felt that the whole thing was a personal
inconvenience, and an affair to be got through with the least
possible discomfort. Amid it all, the one person who gripped his
imagination was Edith. What did Edith really think and feel? His
dislike of her passed into a sort of amazement, and from amazement
into a curious reliance.</p>

<p>On that last dreadful day when he stood in the churchyard, like
one in some fantastic dream, and the clergyman was droning forth
the wisdom of St. Paul, and the small groups of silent figures in
their somber clothes were gazing with awestruck self-consciousness
at that ghastly oblong hole in the earth, as if aware that for each
one of them that would be the inevitable goal, for some reason or
other he glanced at Edith.</p>

<p>She was looking down, her strong face rather paler than usual,
and her beautiful hair visible under her black hat. She stood very
erect, and on her low, white brow there seemed the same
inexplicable calm that always characterized her. In that setting
she appeared somehow distinguished. There was the calm pride of
conscious moral strength. It was as though she had arranged the
whole thing as an expression of herself. It was a duty that his
father should die. It was a duty that she should come and help him
die. It was a duty that she should show sympathy, kindness, and
firmness to her less competent relations. It was a duty to use her
ability, her power of organization, her pride, to help these weaker
vessels.</p>

<p>When it was over and they moved back to the carriages, he almost
unconsciously drew near her! as one might in a world of abstract
fancies cling to the presence of a concrete fact.</p>

<p>He rode back in the carriage with her, and Aunt Elizabeth, and
Eleanor, and Aunt Elizabeth spoke in a subdued but relieved voice
of the way the Reverend Leggatt had read the service. She gave a
brief list of the people who had been at the funeral, and also a
list of some who had not put in an appearance. Edith replied in
quiet monosyllables, and Arthur and Eleanor did not speak.</p>

<p>At five o'clock that evening Edith took him aside and said:</p>

<p>"We think, Arthur, it would be nice if you would go home and
stop with Bess for a little while. She will be very pleased to have
you, and then we can discuss the best thing to do later on. Mrs.
Stabbe will look after the place. Mr. Beck is coming at six
o'clock, and he wants to speak to you about the will, you
know."</p>

<p>This was all said kindly, but with an air of finality. It was
curious that the implied arbitrariness of this arrangement did not
annoy him. He was, in any case, in no mood for opposition, and he
derived at that instant a queer sense of satisfaction at being
ordered about by Edith. He surprised himself by saying:</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"We are staying to-night at the Grosvenor. We shall be returning
to Bradehurst to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. Are you coming up again soon?"</p>

<p>Edith gave him an odd little glance, and answered:</p>

<p>"Yes. On Friday. I have to bring Mildred up to see the
dentist."</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X&mdash;THE BUNGALOW AT BODIESHAM</h2>

<p>There was surely never a drier or more illuminating script than
the will of Mr. Gaffyn. Certain pictures and furniture were left to
Aunt Elizabeth, a tall-boy to Edith Yardley, some architectural
books and 50 to McIlrane, and 50 to Mrs. Stabbe. To his son,
Arthur, he left the remainder of his property, amounting to shares
and capital producing approximately one hundred and ten pounds a
year, the freehold of the bungalow at Bodiesham, and the remaining
furniture at 14 Eccles Square. There were no other provisos or
instructions.</p>

<p>When Mr. Beck solemnly read the document through to Arthur
across a leather-top table, the legatee was at a complete loss as
to what it all represented. The one thing that stuck in his mind
was "the bungalow at Bodiesham." What on earth was the bungalow at
Bodiesham? He had never heard of such a place. When Mr. Beck, who
spoke very slowly, clearly, and precisely, eventually had to
relinquish what to him was obviously the unqualified joy of reading
a legal document out loud, and when he had put it down, and taken
off and wiped his spectacles, and cleared his throat, Arthur
ventured to ask him what the bungalow at Bodiesham was.</p>

<p>Mr. Beck smacked his lips in the pleasurable anticipation of
further declamation, and said:</p>

<p>"The bungalow at Bodiesham is a property three miles from the
Sussex coast. It is a two-story building that your father built
himself about twelve years ago. It was not quite completed at the
time of your mother's death, and as far as I know has never been
occupied. The reason for this, I do not know. I have no evidence
that the bungalow was ever even put in a house-agent's hands,
though I believe it is quite a desirable property and on a very
salubrious part of the coast. It cost something between fifteen
hundred and two thousand pounds to build, and has three acres of
land attached. It is near some sand-dunes. It is possible that your
father had the idea of opening a golf-course there, and making the
pavilion into a club-house; though perhaps from lack of capital, or
some other reason, the scheme never materialized."</p>

<p>Mr. Beck stabbed with a pen into a sheet of blotting-paper, and
looked at Arthur as though he expected some comment. Being
disappointed in this respect, he continued:</p>

<p>"Well, now, Mr. Arthur, this matter is for you to decide. You
are quite at liberty to sell the bungalow, or to let it. There is
no proviso in the will with regard to it. It is simply left to you.
Personally, I should advise you to let us place it in an agent's
hands for letting. I think we ought to get at least sixty-five or
seventy pounds a year for it, and it will mean that addition to
your income. Would you like me to send my clerk, who is an
experienced man, to look it over and report? Or would you care to
go and have a look at it yourself? Or what?"</p>

<p>Arthur said very deliberately:</p>

<p>"I should like to go and look at it myself."</p>

<p>Mr. Beck entered something in a note-book with a fountain pen,
and said:</p>

<p>"Very good."</p>

<p>Arthur surprised himself by further supplementing his sudden
resolution with:</p>

<p>"I will go on Saturday."</p>

<p>Mr. Beck again wrote something, and again said:</p>

<p>"Very good."</p>

<p>He then rose and held out his hand, and added:</p>

<p>"If you will report to me on your return, I will endeavor to get
these little matters settled as expeditiously as possible."</p>

<p>On the following Saturday Arthur caught an early train that
landed him at the market town of Lanby-Wodehurst. From there it was
a seven-miles' drive across low-lying country to Bodiesham. He
hired a trap from the inn, and decided that as it was a glorious
day and he did not know how long his "inspection" would take, he
would engage the man for the single journey only. The village of
Bodiesham consisted of an inn, about five cottages, and a smithy.
After dismissing the driver, he learned from the very ancient smith
that the bungalow was about half a mile further on, along a track
through what he called "the leas." The leas was a gently undulating
country of grass slopes, sand, and patches of gorse.</p>

<p>In this invigorating air in which there was a strong smack of
the sea, he walked briskly along. The depression which had followed
on his father's death became mellowed by the gaiety of the day, and
almost succumbed to the virile impulses of youth. Suddenly, as the
track led eastward over a rather higher elevation of ground than
usual, he beheld a narrow belt of dark pine trees, and silhouetted
against it, with its front facing south, was the bungalow.</p>

<p>He walked more quickly, and was aware of being strangely
agitated. His eyes devoured the white lines of the bungalow, and he
tried to take in every detail at a glance. A hundred yards from the
face of the building was a grass bank. Between the two were
evidences of the beginning of a formal garden, and on the top of
the bank was a young elder-tree. Instead of going straight to the
central door of the bungalow, Arthur made for this bank, which
commanded an uninterrupted view of it, and sat down beneath the
elder-tree. As he gazed at the lines and proportions of this white
building, he felt his heart swelling within him, and suddenly he
broke down and cried for the first time since his father's death.
He was troubled for the moment to account for this excessive
feeling, but gradually the whole truth of the thing came to
him.</p>

<p>He knew his father's work so well, and this was
so&mdash;<i>him</i>. It was so characteristic and&mdash;of this he
was quite sure&mdash;it was the finest thing his father had ever
designed. It was a labor of love. He felt the love of his father in
every line of it. It was very, very simple, and he knew the
infinite trouble his father would take to get a thing simple. He
could tell the love the other had expended over getting the
proportions of the graceful columns just right, and the beautiful
cornice that bound it all together. Over the central hall was a
dome, and on either wing was a broad veranda. It was rather on the
lines of an eighteenth-century colonial house, but with all sorts
of characteristics of his father. The windows and the doors were
peculiarly his father's, and no one else could have designed that
fanlight above the central porch.</p>

<p>A labor of love! The whole tragic import of that phrase came
home to the youth as he leaned forward on the bank.</p>

<p>The bungalow had been "not quite finished at the time of his
mother's death." His father had been secretly building this for
her. He was going to give it to her as a surprise. He had lavished
his whole soul upon it. His labor of love! And then, "it had not
been occupied. I have no evidence that the bungalow was ever even
put in a house-agent's hands." O fools and blind! As though his
father could do that! He had probably visited it sometimes in
secret, and sat beneath the elder tree and dreamed about it on this
very spot. And then this strange characteristic of the man; he
passes it on to Arthur without a word! He does not say: "Arthur,
this is a sacred place to me and to you. I want you to keep it
sacred." He does not admonish him any more than he had admonished
him when he sent him to school. He does not give a hint. He does
not even say "to my dear son, the bungalow at Bodiesham which I
designed and built for my beloved wife." This would have been the
most ordinary, generally accepted wording, even for an old
dry-as-dust like Beck, but his father, who he knew was overcharged
with emotional impulses, merely said, "to my son, Arthur, the
bungalow at Bodiesham"!</p>

<p>The boy sat there gazing at this strange legacy, and dreading to
enter it. It was as though his father, by his very silence, had
bound him irrevocably to the tragic heritage of his unexpressed
emotions. Already among the weeds which clustered on the formal
garden, he was beginning to visualize the pictures which this
setting was intended to disclose. The boy forced back the tears,
and taking the key which Mr. Beck had given him, walked across the
lawn. He had great difficulty in getting the lock to accept the
unaccustomed attentions of the key, but at length he stood in his
father's hall. The plaster had cracked in places, but there was no
evidence of dampness. The foundations must have been sound. The
walls were quite bare, and there was no furniture of any sort in
the bungalow. In some of the rooms he discovered an odd plank or
two, and a trestle, and on the upper landing some rolls of ceiling
paper that had never been used. Two of the bedrooms were without
fireplaces, but all the main constructional part of the building
was sound and finished. On the ground floor was a beautiful
L-shaped room with delicate plaster paneling. It would have made a
splendid room for music.</p>

<p>"O God!" the boy groaned to himself. "What am I to do with
this!"</p>

<p>What did his father mean him to do with it, this deserted
legacy? He must have thought of it. He must have had Arthur in his
mind's eye when he said "to my son, the bungalow at Bodiesham." Was
it to be a sanctuary, or merely a means of increasing his income?
He somehow could not believe that. Whenever his father wished him
to do a thing, he expressed that wish by some vague implication.
With his uncritical mind which touched nothing but his work, with
his peculiar faculty of seeing both sides of a question at the same
time, in the affairs of the world he was a negative quantity. And
yet, as Arthur wandered about that house, he felt that he knew his
father for the first time, that he was more intimate with him than
he had ever been.</p>

<p>He entered the principal bedroom and looked out of the window.
Across the dunes a narrow strip of sea lay quivering like a white
ribbon. He opened the lattice and sighed, and as he did so a little
incident impressed him. Some martins had made their nests under the
eaves of the roof, and as he sighed two of them fluttered away with
a cry. Eavesdroppers! That was quaint; he hadn't thought of it
before, the meaning of the word. They listened at the bedroom
windows of the happy and the wretched. They heard people sob in the
night, and they heard the laughter of children in the early
morning. On this day they had heard him sigh as he entered the
heritage of his father. They would flutter away and tell the other
birds. There would be a bond of understanding. Somehow he felt glad
that the martins had made their nests under the eaves of his
father's house.</p>

<p>He stood at the window a long time, watching the sand glittering
in the sunlight. What was he to do? Did his father mean him to come
and live here? It would surely be possible to live on a hundred
pounds a year, given a house. He could live simply, and work, and
study. It would be a glorious place to study, silent and beautiful;
rather lonely, perhaps, but he would get used to that. And he could
wander about, and paint the sand-dunes and the sea. The martins
went swirling by beneath the window, and overhead a lark was
praising the beauty of this peerless day. What a contrast to the
fetid atmosphere of Blinkinshaw's! Indeed, a glorious legacy! His
decision was made. He would come and live here.</p>

<p>Immediately he desired to return, to make all arrangements so
that he could come at once. He went quickly all over the bungalow
once more, determining which rooms he would make use of. He would
use three; the kitchen for his meals, the largest bedroom to sleep
in, and the bedroom facing north as a studio.</p>

<p>Ruminating on the fair prospect of these resolutions, he walked
at a good pace back to Lanby-Wodehurst, and had the good fortune to
have only forty minutes to wait for one of the trains which
occasionally connected this sleepy town with more active centers of
civilization.</p>

<p><br>
When he broached the subject of his resolve in the evening, Aunt
Elizabeth exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious! you can't do that! You can't go and live
alone. They say man wasn't made to live alone. You'll go mad.
Besides, how are you going to manage? You can't cook and all
that."</p>

<p>And Eleanor said:</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you'll be very lonely, Arthur. Are there any
cottages near? Perhaps you could get a woman to come in and do for
you."</p>

<p>"I'm certain Edith will think it's preposterous," continued Aunt
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"It's nothing to do with Edith," answered Arthur, the gall of
anger rising, "and you needn't write and let her know until I've
gone. I shall just arrange it with Beck."</p>

<p>When Mr. Beck was informed, he went through all sorts of tricks
with his nose and throat to get his voice to the right timbre of
chilling dissuasion.</p>

<p>"The place requires three or four hundred pounds at least to
make it habitable. You will have to pay twenty pounds a year
ground-rent, and if you live there, there will be rates and taxes.
Oh, no, my boy, you want at least three hundred a year to keep that
place up."</p>

<p>"I can manage to live there on eighty pounds a year," answered
Arthur.</p>

<p>"But you won't even have eighty pounds a year. By the time you
have paid the rates and taxes, the cost of removal,
the&mdash;er&mdash;incidental expenses in connection with the
winding up of your father's estate, you will have nearer sixty
pounds a year."</p>

<p>"Well, I can live on sixty pounds a year," replied the boy
doggedly.</p>

<p>Mr. Beck shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"There is no electric light or gas."</p>

<p>"I can burn candles."</p>

<p>"Did you test the drains!"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Another shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p>"Well, I can only advise you as an old friend of your father's.
I have no power to force you to act contrary to your wishes. I will
simply point out that if you will allow us to let the bungalow,
your income will be about two hundred a year, which, with what you
earn in your profession, will soon place you in a position
of&mdash;er&mdash;comfort and security. You will soon, perhaps, be
considering the question of marriage, eh? And then there is your
career to be considered. What can you do at Bodiesham to develop
your career? You will have barely sixty pounds a year, and no
opportunity that I can see of augmenting it. You will not be able
to entertain; you will be cut off from all society; and you will
not even be able to keep up the estate. Why, the place requires two
gardeners for a start."</p>

<p>And then Arthur surprised himself by saying:</p>

<p>"I shall be going down to Bodiesham this day week."</p>

<p>Mr. Beck looked distinctly irritated at this, and he again
shrugged his shoulders and said:</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>He then rang the bell for his clerk, and Arthur shook his hand
and departed.</p>

<p>He next visited Mr. Leffbury and explained the matter to him.
Mr. Leffbury sighed and said:</p>

<p>"O Lord! you are a lucky devil! I wish I could go and live in
the country. Sixty pounds! Why, you can live like a bloody king on
sixty pounds a year in the country. Take your water-colors, and
come and show me what you're doing now and then."</p>

<p>He avoided the big studio. He was afraid of what might be said
about his father. There was no limit to the cynical flippancy of
the young designers. But on the stairs he met Jimmy Long. Jimmy
said:</p>

<p>"Hullo, Gaffyn. I'm awfully sorry to hear about your
guv'nor."</p>

<p>And Arthur pressed his hand and didn't reply. They looked at
each other for a few moments, and then Arthur said:</p>

<p>"I'm leaving. I'm going to live in the country."</p>

<p>"Are you really? When are you going?"</p>

<p>"On Saturday."</p>

<p>"Jeminy! Well, look here, won't you come and feed with me one
night before you go?"</p>

<p>Arthur hesitated, and then said:</p>

<p>"Yes, all right. What about Friday?"</p>

<p>"Friday's good. I'll meet you at Pollini's at seven."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p><br>
The following days were devoted to collecting painting material and
books, and in arranging the details of having certain pieces of
furniture sent by rail to arrive at the time he did.</p>

<p>On Friday Edith came up to town to take Mildred to the dentist.
He suspected that Edith would have been informed by Aunt Elizabeth
by letter. For some reason or other he felt uncomfortable about
this, but fortified his resolution by constantly repeating to
himself:</p>

<p>"I won't stand any nonsense from Edith about this."</p>

<p>He made a point of being out when she came, but arrived home at
half-past five and discovered that she and Mildred were still
there.</p>

<p>To his surprise she made no comment about his scheme until just
before she left, when she said:</p>

<p>"How are you having your things sent, Arthur?"</p>

<p>"By rail."</p>

<p>"When did they go?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday."</p>

<p>"Do you expect to find them there to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Edith looked thoughtful. Then she said:</p>

<p>"What train are you going by?"</p>

<p>"The 10:37 in the morning."</p>

<p>This was all that was said, and Arthur felt somewhat
relieved.</p>

<p>After she had gone he went downtown and dined with Jimmy Long at
Pollini's. They had a farewell feast and drank a great deal of
Beaune. Arthur felt the need of this humanizing society. Over the
red wine he unburdened himself to Jimmy. He told him every little
thing about his thoughts, and feelings, and resolutions. He talked
about his father, and the mystery of death, his shame at the affair
with Ada, his ambitions. The conversation rioted among the problems
of life and love. They discussed Mr. Leffbury again, and the future
of Blinkinshaw's, and again and again returned to women and beauty,
and the mystery of life. Arthur forgot his previous promise to take
Jimmy to Italy, but instead invited him to come and spend the
summer holiday at the bungalow&mdash;an invitation that was
accepted with warmth. But they did not get drunk; although when
Arthur parted from his friend, the latter stood a certain risk of
missing his last bus owing to his insistence on quoting Omar
Khayyam to a policeman in Charing Cross Road.</p>

<p><br>
Saturday was a gray day with low banks of clouds blowing up from
the west, but Arthur set forth on his new life in a cheerier frame
of mind than he had been in since the beginning of his father's
illness.</p>

<p>He arrived at Lanby-Wodehurst at half -past twelve. To his
disappointment, his furniture and effects had not arrived, but he
arranged with a local carrier to send them on immediately when they
did. There was a train due at 2:05. They would probably be on
that.</p>

<p>He took his bag, which contained a few clothes, sketching
materials, and a quantity of food which Aunt Elizabeth had insisted
on his taking, and started out to walk.</p>

<p>He covered the first two miles briskly, the breath of the sea in
his face, and then the bag began to feel very heavy. He changed
hands frequently, and had a long rest. At the end of the third mile
he regretted not having indulged in the desperate extravagance of
taking the trap. He had no idea that a bag, which seemed so
unnoticeable to carry from a bus to a train, could become such a
dead weight. But he trudged on, consumed with a desire to reach his
new home. At the end of the fourth mile he again rested, and
debated whether he wouldn't open the bag and have some lunch, but
his anxiety to become installed in his father's bungalow overrode
this wayward temptation.</p>

<p>It was nearly three o'clock by the time he reached the bungalow,
and both his hands were blistered and his shoulders ached. He was
trembling with exhaustion when he finally deposited his burden in
the kitchen.</p>

<p>Despite his weariness and the inner craving, he felt it
necessary to go all over the building again carefully. Yes, it was
very exciting. He eventually returned to the kitchen and opened the
bag. He took out a loaf, and a packet of tea, and some butter, and
a tin of corned beef. And then an unfortunate fact presented
itself. He had several tins of things, but no tin-opener. Moreover,
he knew he would be able to collect some wood for a fire, but he
had forgotten to bring a match.</p>

<p>This was very annoying, but he cut himself a large hunk of bread
and buttered it, and leaned against the window-sill and dreamed of
the glorious life of freedom before him. He also had an apple which
Eleanor had thrust into his overcoat pocket, and which he found
very acceptable.</p>

<p>After this repast he once more wandered over the bungalow and
visualized his things in the places he had planned for them. It was
half-past three, quite time they arrived. He went out into the
garden and sat for a time on the bank. Then he went up into the
pinewood and collected some twigs.</p>

<p>"I'll borrow some matches from the old chap who comes in the
cart," he reflected.</p>

<p>Then another disquieting thought occurred to him. He had
forgotten to order any candles. He had no means of lighting after
dark. However, it was summer-time; it didn't get dark till nearly
nine o'clock. He would manage. Besides, after the things had come,
he would go into the village and see what he could get.</p>

<p>He wandered round the pine-trees and up on the dunes, keeping
the bungalow and the road always in sight; but no cart came. At
five o'clock he began to think it would be jolly to have some tea,
but he had no means of lighting a fire. He did not like to leave
the bungalow in case the things came, and he could not remember
noticing any building nearer than the village half a mile away. He
went inside and ate some more bread and butter. At half-past six a
fine rain began to fall, and he went upstairs and sat on a trestle
by the bedroom window. The trestle was a great comfort. It was his
only piece of furniture. It was not till nearly seven that the
alarming idea came to him that the things might not come at all!
This was Saturday. If they didn't come to-day, they certainly
wouldn't come to-morrow. There was absolutely nowhere to lie down
(he couldn't balance himself on the trestle), and he hadn't a rug,
and no light or fire. It was certainly rather disgusting. He would
probably be able to get something to-morrow in the village, but he
daren't leave the bungalow to-night; and he had no other comforts
than bread and butter, and a suit of pajamas and a tooth-brush.</p>

<p>He stood patiently by the window, and the room began to get very
chilly; it was certainly going to get dark to-night earlier. The
wind was moaning gently through the chimneys, and outside the
pewits went swirling by with their plaintive cry.</p>

<p>"I mustn't get depressed by this," he thought, and he walked
briskly about the rooms, his footsteps on the bare boards echoing
all over the bungalow.</p>

<p>Every five minutes or so he would go to the window and peer out.
Once he heard a cart rumbling on the road and ran to the door, but
it was only a farm cart laden with Swedes, lumbering through the
rain. After it had gone he thought:</p>

<p>"What a fool I am! I might have borrowed some matches from that
man."</p>

<p>The rain increased in violence, and he gave up all hope of his
things arriving that night. He cursed his luck and tried to
determine how he would spend the night. He tested the effect of
lying on the floor, but wherever he indulged in this recumbent
luxury, it seemed incredibly drafty. He eventually decided to try
lying in the corner of the L-shaped room in a recess, with his head
on his bag.</p>

<p>Suddenly&mdash;it must have been after nine&mdash;he heard the
crunching of wheels on the road. He ran to the door again. Hooray!
There, indeed, was a small cart, with a lantern on its left side,
pulling up at the gate.</p>

<p>As he ran down the path toward it, he had time to reflect that
it was a very small cart to bring all his effects. When he reached
the gate, a man got down from the seat and said:</p>

<p>"Garf'n?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's right." Arthur answered.</p>

<p>The man grumbled and went to the back of the cart, and Arthur
joined him.</p>

<p>He pulled out what was apparently a camp-bed covered with a
canvas, and a mattress similarly treated. Arthur peered at
them.</p>

<p>"These aren't my things, are they?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Eh?" exclaimed the man. "Garf'n, ain't it,&mdash;the
bungalow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's right."</p>

<p>He looked at the label. It was certainly addressed to him, and
there was a large box also covered with canvas. He helped the man
bring in these mysterious things. When they were deposited in the
hall, he ventured to remark:</p>

<p>"But these are not the things I was expecting. I am expecting
some furniture."</p>

<p>"Furniture!" exclaimed the carrier.</p>

<p>"Yes, I had it sent off on Thursday by freight-train from
London."</p>

<p>"Freight-train? From Lunnon? Lord, whoy, you woan't get they for
a week."</p>

<p>"But what are these, then!"</p>

<p>"Oi doan't know nothin' abowt it. Oi bring these 'ere from
Wodehurst. They come from Lunnon by passenger-train. Oi believe Mr.
Cheney 'ad a telegram from Lunnon to bring un on at once."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," said Arthur, and he gave the driver a goodly
proportion of his week's income.</p>

<p>"Well, this is an extraordinarily rum thing," he thought after
the man had gone.</p>

<p>The bed was a very neat little camp-bed, and the mattress was
quite dry under its canvas cover. The top of the box was somewhat
flimsy and he was able to open it with his hands. He pulled it near
the kitchen window, but he could not see its contents, so he groped
among them. Almost the first thing he felt was a packet of candles.
Then he again cursed, because in the excitement he had forgotten to
borrow a match from the carrier.</p>

<p>However, he groped further, and lo and behold; there was a
packet of safety-matches. He was able to light a candle, which he
propped up in the fireplace. He then rapidly examined the rest of
the contents of the box. There was a tin of mixed biscuits, a piece
of cooked bacon, some cheese and some condensed milk, a rug, a
sweater, a small spirit-stove and a tin of spirit, some apples and
bananas, a screw-driver and a hammer, a corkscrew and a
tin-opener!</p>

<p>There was no card or evidence as to where this amazing package
had come from. It is quite possible that Arthur would never have
been able to satisfactorily determine this point had it not been
for the fact that the sweater was wrapped in a piece of brown
paper, and inside was an old torn label of Messrs. Marshall &amp;
Snelgrove. The relict of the address on the label amounted to:</p>

<p>Mrs. Yardl<br>
Brad<br>
S<br></p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI&mdash;ARTHUR HAS TWO VISITORS</h2>

<p>It is always tiresome to the free spirit, or to a gentle egoist
like Arthur, to have to acknowledge that something which "they" say
is, in effect, the truth. It was particularly galling to Arthur to
be forced to swallow the incontrovertible platitude of Aunt
Elizabeth, "They say that man was not meant to live alone." But as
the days, and weeks, and months went by, this statement leered at
him, showing its white fangs of naked veracity. It was, indeed, an
appalling, wretched time.</p>

<p>It is true that on certain days when the sun shone and he got
into a snug position on the dunes, or down by the harbor of
Fareshaven, with his water-colors and Whatman paper in full working
order, life was a very complete and satisfying business. He became
conscious of nothing but the virile thing growing under his hands.
He wanted nothing else.</p>

<p>But when he returned to the bungalow, and more especially when
the evening came on, he could not disguise from himself his
unutterable loneliness. With his own furniture, which arrived five
days after it was due, he fitted up the three rooms as he had
planned. He did not put up his own bed, as he found Edith's
camp-bed quite comfortable, and it did not seem worth the bother to
change. He had a good supply of books, and he read Marcus Aurelius;
and Walt Whitman, and Emerson, and Vasari's lives of the Italian
painters, and the <i>Decameron</i> of Boccaccio, and the <i>Life of
Benvenuto Cellini</i>, and the novels of Tolstoi, and Turgeniev,
and Anatole Prance, and Joseph Conrad. But the written words of
these fine teachers could not compensate for the lack of contact
with his fellow-man. He visited the village as often as he could
and talked to the smith and the farm-hands, but he did not make
much progress with them. Occasionally he would visit the village
inn, drink ale in the bar, and try to strike up a friendship with
the village people, but he was always aware of them looking at him
rather suspiciously, and his voice seemed strained and
self-conscious in contrast to their rich homely burr.</p>

<p>If he had followed his inclinations, he would have packed up and
returned to town within the week, but greater than these fears of
darkness and loneliness was the fear of being thought afraid, and
the dread of being despised by Edith and his other relatives. He
had set out to live alone in the bungalow, and here he would stay
until a reasonable excuse should present an opportunity of
release.</p>

<p>Every week or so he wrote to Aunt Elizabeth or Eleanor, and
occasionally sent post-cards to Jimmy Long or Levistock. He could
not bring himself to write to Edith. In the first place, there was
no message with the things she had sent. He had no official
intimation that they came from her. He felt that she ought to have
written. And in the second place, the gift had somehow annoyed him,
made him feel ignominious. He would have been in a desperate state
if they had not arrived, and this very fact made the gift the more
objectionable.</p>

<p>The days seemed incredibly long, and the nights infinitely
longer. The hours when he became immersed in his work, or inspired
by some illuminating thought transmitted from the pages of a book,
were merely gleams in an infinity of wretchedness. The memory of
his father was always with him, and the tragic atmosphere of the
bungalow, with its eternal suggestion of still-born happiness.
Whether he lay on the bank in the sun, in the shadow of the
veranda, or in his silent bed at night, he was always aware of the
sterile purposes of this unhappy building. The unexpressed love of
his father and the inexpressible love of his mother, were they
gone? Dead to him forever? He thought, and thought, and thought,
and drew comfort from Emerson and despair from his own perverse
moods. He wrestled with a thousand desires and inclinations, and
touched the lowest rung of human experience&mdash;self-pity.</p>

<p>One night the wind rose and howled in the chimneys and rattled
the windows. Arthur sufered paroxysms of physical fear. He thought
he heard some one walking in the rooms below, and the bannisters
creaking. He had no keys to the rooms, and he expected every moment
to hear the handle of the door turn stealthily; his heart almost
stopped with fear.</p>

<p>He lay there a long time trembling; then he thought to
himself:</p>

<p>"After all, what does it matter! Suppose some one comes in and
kills me, will it be worse than this living wretchedness! Who would
care if I were alive or dead!"</p>

<p>He saw himself in a detached way, a lonely boy without love or
friendship. Did he want to live? He struggled hard to keep back the
tears. What did life hold out for him that he should be afraid of
death? And yet something was telling hm he must not think like
that. But he was lonely, lonely, lonely. He reached the rock-bottom
of this dark well of silent self-pity. He seemed to see his soul
stark and desperate, suspended in space, out of touch with any
living contact. The very desperateness of this despair suddenly
fired a spark that lit the dark places of his yearning heart. He
jumped from his bed and walked firmly to the door, and opened it.
He shouted in a loud voice into the empty spaces of the house:</p>

<p>"Hullo! Hullo!"</p>

<p>There was no answer but the wind wailing relentlessly, and yet
he felt somehow comforted. He walked up and down the room, his
physical fears assuaged, but moral fears, like pale ghosts, hovered
at the back of his mind.</p>

<p>"I can understand," he thought; "one has to fight, and fight,
and fight. I can understand, if one lives too long alone, one goes
mad. It is because one is not complete. No living thing is
complete; it is all connected with the rest of life. Physical
things are connected by the law of gravitation, spiritual things by
the law of love. Man is spiritual; he belongs to the rest."</p>

<p>He spent what the French call a "white night," trying to adjust
the impulses of his egotistical desires to the iron bars of
philosophic reflection which were being smelted in the white-hot
furnace of his suffering. When the dawn came he felt that something
had been destroyed in him, and something had been born.</p>

<p>There were many more nights such as this, nights spent in
striving to solve imponderable problems, to grapple with
unspeakable fears, to find within himself some satisfying faith.
But the dominant force which kept him faithful to his father's
bungalow was the force of personal pride, a curious, elusive,
egotistical force which seemed more powerful than reason or
philosophy.</p>

<p>In August Jimmy Long kept his promise and paid a visit, staying
for a week. To his surprise the loneliness seemed to impress Jimmy
less than it did himself. The weather was fine, and his former
colleague seemed content to spend the day in semi-nudity, bathing,
lying in the sun, and smoking. Inside the bungalow he howled
popular melodies that made the windows rattle, and found infinite
delight in grilling steaks and experimenting in strange dishes that
had an unfortunate habit of sticking to the pan. He pronounced it
"a great life."</p>

<p>After he had departed on Saturday the place seemed lonelier than
ever. For the first few days it was unbearable, and he said to
himself:</p>

<p>"I sha'n't be able to stand this much longer."</p>

<p>Many times he was on the point of packing up and going off to
London, but from day to day he put it off. It was late August. Aunt
Elizabeth and Eleanor were in Wales. Edith he had not heard from
since he left home. There was no one he could go to.</p>

<p>He went out for long rambles, and once stayed a night in
lodgings in Littlehampton. And every time he returned, the bungalow
seemed lonelier.</p>

<p>He had made over a hundred water-color drawings in the open, and
he did some still life, some real "hard" drawing. He made a careful
study of an old rusty anchor he found on the beach, and sketches of
teazels and sea-holly and poppies, and on wet days he made drawings
of the interior of the bungalow. He also wrote verses, and one he
dedicated to "The Lady of the Work-box."</p>

<p>In September he caught a chill and was feverish for two days and
nights. He stayed in bed and lived on milk which was delivered by a
woman from a farm a mile away. When he recovered from this he was
excessively weak. He lost interest in his work and sat about the
garden or the bungalow, occasionally reading, but for the most part
doing nothing. He felt himself getting into a low, maudlin state,
and that some great effort was required of him. He started writing
down his experiences in the manner of a person who is expecting to
die, but the result didn't please him, and he tore up the
manuscript. As he got a little stronger, he went in for reading
aloud, and learned passages from Shakespeare and Milton, which he
declaimed in his most theatrical manner to the bare walls. The old
physical fears by this time had vanished. He had no terrors of the
darkness, but a peculiar numbed indifference was getting possession
of him. His letters to Aunt Elizabeth and Eleanor had gradually
become rarer, and he had refused again and again their offer to
come and stay with him for awhile.</p>

<p><br>
It was on the second day of October that the thing happened which
was destined to be the indirect cause of a change in the whole
tenor of his life.</p>

<p>It had been a dull day without rain, but with a great deal of
humidity in the air. It was about half-past six, and was already
getting dark. He was carrying some faggots into the kitchen from
the yard when he heard the noise of an automobile coming slowly
along the lane. To his surprise, it came to a stop at the gate of
the bungalow, and lay there panting and gasping, like a thing that
has had an exhausting journey. A man in motor-goggles and oilskins
leaped down from the car and approached the house. As he came to
within about a dozen yards, he cried out:</p>

<p>"Arthur!"</p>

<p>Arthur came round from the side of the bungalow, and approached
the visitor. He recognized him as his cousin, Walter Gaffyn. On
catching sight of Arthur, he shouted:</p>

<p>"Hullo! Arthur, old man! I <i>have</i> had a job to find you.
I've come over from Bognor. We're living there now. I heard you
were here; thought I'd give you a look up. How are you?"</p>

<p>Arthur replied:</p>

<p>"I'm all right, thanks. Will you come inside!"</p>

<p>They went through the front door, and Walter continued
shouting:</p>

<p>"Well, you are a rum chap to live here like this! How on earth
do you manage! Get a woman in to cook and so on, I suppose? Why,
it's quite a nice property. Bit lonely, I should think. Tell me all
about it."</p>

<p>Arthur said there was really very little to tell, and he lighted
a paraffin lamp, and led the way into the room in which he had his
meals. He made a hasty mental calculation of the food there was in
the house, and said:</p>

<p>"Will you stop to supper? I have some&mdash;er&mdash;stew and
stuff, nothing very special, but if you'll stop&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No thanks. I'm afraid I must get back to dinner. We dine at
eight. You haven't a drop of Scotch, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Arthur said he regretted he hadn't, and Walter roared out:</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right. You've heard the news, of course?"</p>

<p>"What news!"</p>

<p>"Why, about the Yardleys."</p>

<p>"What about the Yardleys!"</p>

<p>"What! D' you mean to say you haven't heard? It's been in all
the papers."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I hardly ever see the papers. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Lord! what a rum chap you are! Not see the papers! Living the
simple life, eh?"</p>

<p>And Walter Gaffyn laughed with boisterous incredulity.</p>

<p>"What is it about the Yardleys?" Arthur repeated.</p>

<p>Walter swelled with the importance of a person with news. He
twirled his dark brown mustache, and said:</p>

<p>"Robert Yardley was found dead in bed last Monday night."</p>

<p>"Dead!" exclaimed Arthur. "Good Lord!"</p>

<p>Walter seemed satisfied with the success of his first
pronouncement. But his sense of dramatic effect forbade him to rush
all the details into the one statement. He looked at Arthur, and
then added:</p>

<p>"But that's not all. The point is&mdash;and this is why there's
been a good deal of talk in the papers&mdash;he didn't die in his
own bed!"</p>

<p>Arthur looked at his cousin questioningly, somewhat impatient of
the studied delays.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what bed?" he stammered.</p>

<p>And then Walter, with his nice sense of climax, delivered the
culminating bombshell in a stentorian voice:</p>

<p>"He died suddenly in the night in the flat of Miss Rene
O'Beirne, a lady described as an actress."</p>

<p>Arthur's mind rioted with a hundred visions. He gasped:</p>

<p>"But what&mdash;why was this? And why was it in the papers?"</p>

<p>Walter thoroughly enjoyed the effect of this astounding news. He
started out to elaborate his important information. He replied:</p>

<p>"Why was it in the papers? My dear boy, there was a post-mortem.
You can't suppress a post-mortem. The papers were all over it, like
flies on a tart. 'Sensational death of a famous engineer!'
'Regrettable story,' and so on. Everything came out. The woman, of
course, was a prostitute."</p>

<p>The mind of Arthur became keenly occupied with the vision of
Edith. Good God! It was incredible! Edith! He tried to think of her
as they broke the story to her, as she gave evidence, as she stood
by the body that once...as the people looked at her in the court.
Would she be proud again? Could she ever look proud again? Could
she ever look as he was visualizing her at that moment, as she
looked at his father's funeral, standing strangely erect and her
eyes cast down, insolently proud of her calm strength?</p>

<p>"Good God! it will break her! She is finished," he thought.</p>

<p>Walter was grinning at him with smug satisfaction. He was saying
in a more confidential manner:</p>

<p>"Of course, I never could stand Edith, Arthur. And I gathered
from what I saw at your place that you couldn't either. Of course
I'm sorry for her; it'll break her up, I should think. The disgrace
of it! Talk about a clean cop! No hushing up anything like that.
But Lord! she never knew how to manage Robert. He was a nice chap.
I used to like Robert&mdash;a man of the world and all that sort of
thing. Beastly bad luck for him, eh? The disgrace, you know! Won't
matter to him much now, anyway! Ha, ha! But, Great Scott! I went
there once or twice. Robert would come home to dinner about
half-past eight. Give him <i>cold fish</i> for his dinner! Did you
ever hear anything like it? Cold fish! <i>Cold</i> fish!"</p>

<p>Walter broke out into paroxysms of incredulous interjections. It
appeared to be all most amusing and preposterous to him. Arthur
felt a wave of anger at his cousin. What a disgusting cad the man
was! Fancy being able to laugh at such a tragedy!</p>

<p>And then, after all, it was true; he had not liked Edith, but
she was extraordinarily good. She had come out very well at the
time of his father's death. She was very kind in her peculiar way.
She had done a lot for him. He had never been grateful to her, not
a word. Underneath all her apparent hardness there was some
mystifying quality. And now in this dark hour there was
that&mdash;pride, wasn't it? He felt a desire to see her, to see
how she would take it all, to see her proud face humbled, perhaps
softened. She was an abnormal woman in her way. Certainly this
little cad had no right to laugh at her.</p>

<p>"I knew this would interest you if you hadn't heard," Walter was
running on. "That was partly why I came over; and just to see the
country and so on. You must come over and see us. Lucy'll be
delighted. Do you get any shootin' here? Snipe or wild duck,
eh?"</p>

<p>Arthur said "No," and thought of Mr. Yardley walking among the
standard rose-trees at Bradehurst and smoking his pipe, while
Edith, with her basket and scissors, clipped the dead shoots and
spoke in her calm, detached voice about the artificial manure that
Scatter &amp; Company were advertising in their trade
catalogue.</p>

<p>"A good lay-out here for a golf-course, what! Was that your
governor's idea, do you think? This pavilion, eh? The club-house,&mdash;yes.
Too far, of course, from town. Poor old Robert! He was
a good player. He had one of the longest drives I've ever seen;
usually came a cropper on the green; a bit inclined to pull. I
wonder they hadn't let you know. Well, you are a rum un, living
here alone. I should get one of these country girls to keep house,
I think. Ha! ha! ha! The simple life. Oh, my word!"</p>

<p>"I must go to her," Arthur thought suddenly. He hadn't any idea
what he would do or say when he went. He could not analyze his
motives for wanting to go. But he knew very definitely that he
would have to go.</p>

<p>"Come back with me to dinner, and stop the night. Lucy'll be
delighted."</p>

<p>"No, I can't do that, thanks."</p>

<p>"Not? Well, you are a rum chap! I must be off, then. Give me a
hand with the screen, will you?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII&mdash;PARIS AND BACK</h2>

<p>It was a quarter of eight in the evening when Arthur arrived at
Bradehurst station. As he was not expected, and a trap was an
expensive luxury, he walked the two miles to the Yardleys' house.
It was quite dark, and on two occasions he took the wrong turning,
so that he did not eventually arrive till past nine o'clock. He
felt peculiarly nervous and agitated. He did not know why he had
come, or what he was going to say when he saw Edith. He half hoped
she wouldn't be at home. He walked up the gravel path and rang the
bell. A maid whose face was unfamiliar to him opened the door. He
asked for Mrs. Yardley, and the girl showed him into the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>When the maid retired he balanced himself on the edge of the
settee, and his heart was beating at an unreasonably rapid rate. He
sat there for less than three minutes, when Edith entered the room.
Any ideas he had entertained that he would see a crushed and broken
woman were instantly dissipated by his first glance at her. She
said quietly:</p>

<p>"Arthur! How kind of you to come. You'll stop the night. I'll
have your bag taken upstairs."</p>

<p>He could not but be struck by the curious change in her. Her
face was flushed, and her eyes were rather bright. She gave him the
impression of some primitive creature that, driven into a desperate
position, was straining every nerve and sinew to fight for its
life. She looked, if anything, prouder, more alert, more
commanding. She had herself tremendously in hand.</p>

<p>"She's a remarkable woman," Arthur thought, and he stood by the
fireplace, not knowing what to say.</p>

<p>He was conscious, moreover, that in her attitude to him there
was some fundamental change. She was glad to see him. She motioned
him to be seated, and she herself sat down. Her head was
silhouetted against the dark corner of the room, and in her poise
there was something indicative, almost majestic.</p>

<p>He felt ashamed of the silence that he did not know how to
break, and he said haphazardly:</p>

<p>"I'm leaving Bodiesham. I find it too lonely."</p>

<p>"Ah! I expect it is. It's good for a time, though, to live
alone."</p>

<p>He answered:</p>

<p>"Yes, of course; I liked it in a way. It did me good, I think. I
see things differently. I did a lot of work, and read a great deal.
I was very wretched at times. I went through all sorts of
things."</p>

<p>He was surprised to find himself exchanging these confidences
with Edith. They were, in a way, a sort of defence. He couldn't
say, "I'm awfully sorry to hear about your trouble," or make some
trite remark to this effect. He tried to show by his change of
manner that he understood, that he was sympathetic.</p>

<p>She did not answer for awhile. Then, still gazing at the fire,
she said:</p>

<p>"I am leaving here, too. I am going to London. All my maids left
suddenly on Wednesday. I only have the woman who opened the door to
you."

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I haven't made up my mind."</p>

<p>She smiled sadly and answered:</p>

<p>"That's always been a trouble, hasn't it? Come! I'll get you
some supper."</p>

<p>"Can I help? I've become fairly domesticated."</p>

<p>"No, don't you bother. It'll be a change for you to be waited
on."</p>

<p>In ten minutes she returned and said:</p>

<p>"Come! It's all ready."</p>

<p>As they walked across the hall, some sardonic voice&mdash;in
fact, his cousin Walter's&mdash;whispered:</p>

<p>"Cold fish. <i>Cold</i> fish!"</p>

<p>But on arriving in the dining-room, the anticipations of this
mocking spirit were confounded. For lo and behold! there was an
omelet, and some sort of bird in a casserole.</p>

<p>They sat down, and Edith served.</p>

<p>The supper was surprisingly good, and afterward Edith asked him
if he cared to smoke. They talked scrappily about commonplace
matters. Nothing was said about the tragic thing which lay so
heavily at the back of both their minds.</p>

<p><br>
He stayed three days, and then returned to London. Aunt Elizabeth
and Eleanor welcomed him with open arms and copious weeping. How
dreadful it all was! And how was dear Edith taking it? Who could
have suspected that that amiable man, Robert Yardley, could have
been such a villain! There was enormous discussion, and many and
various disclosures of unpleasant details.</p>

<p>He looked at Eleanor. Her eyes were just as kind and mothering
as ever but there was about her something small and insignificant
compared to Edith.</p>

<p>It is to be feared that he used Aunt Elizabeth's house rather
like a hotel during his week's stay. He went to see Mr. Leffbury,
and showed him a few of his best water-colors. He went to
picture-galleries and museums and wandered about London. He went
out to dinner with Jimmy Long, and Levistock, and others, and
visited theaters and music-halls.</p>

<p>He found London at that time a very disturbing place. The South
African War was on, and the streets were full of cheering people,
and there was considerable drunkenness. The music-halls were
patriotic in the worst sense of the word. Swaggering, blustering
jingo songs, flag-waving, and drunken cheering, seemed to be the
order of the day and night. The excitement of this life after the
austere existence at Bodiesham at times elated him, but for the
most part it nauseated him. He found the atmosphere of
Blinkinshaw's more feverish and unsettling than ever.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" he thought, "or rather, thank my father! I haven't
got to come back to this!"</p>

<p>It was Mr. Leffbury who gave him the idea which he next acted
upon. He visited him very late one evening in his room at
Blinkinshaw's. He was in a particularly despondent and bitter mood,
but Mr. Leffbury seemed unusually cheerful. He was, as a matter of
fact, working on a drawing which rather pleased him. His little
window was open, and he rolled and licked innumerable cigarettes. A
wagonette passed below, crowded with medical students blowing penny
horns and yelling at the top of their voices. Arthur relieved
himself of some of his pent-up misgivings. He told Mr. Leffbury his
impressions of London in its present phase, and the head designer
suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>"My dear Gaffyn, you mustn't go fishing in the deep waters of
philosophic reflection with the bent pin of cynicism. You'll catch
nothing."</p>

<p>And then he laughed and said:</p>

<p>"By God! that's rather good. I'll make a note of it, if you
don't mind. But honestly, the trouble with you is, you haven't
enough to do. The only way to be happy is to be overworked."</p>

<p>He took a clean sponge and washed down part of the drawing he
was working on, and continued:</p>

<p>"If one has no imagination, one can be happy on nothing, but
<i>you</i> can't. I don't think you've found your right means of
expression. Get on with your job. Don't bother about all these
other people."</p>

<p>And he waved his hand toward the window.</p>

<p>"Everybody's first job is to save his own soul. Let all these
others go to hell in their own way. They'll find out. You won't do
any good interfering with them. If this age teaches us anything, it
teaches us the value of selfishness. I'm selfish; that's why I'm
happy, and why I sit here half the night working on these bloody
drawings."</p>

<p>He peered along the surface of his drawing to see whether it had
dried, and then suddenly looked up and said:</p>

<p>"Why don't you go to Paris and study painting!"</p>

<p>"Paris? I couldn't afford it."</p>

<p>"Yes, you could. You could go to old Berthelot's. It's one of
these municipally endowed places. You pay about two francs fifty a
week. And for the rest, you can easily live on twenty francs a week
in Paris. He's an excellent teacher. I feel you've got something in
you. You might do something big. Go out after the big thing. Hunt
round till you find your right medium. Don't be discouraged if you
don't do a Rembrandt during your first term."</p>

<p><br>
At half-past ten the next morning Arthur was in Mr. Beck's office.
He explained that he wanted to raise some money to go to Paris and
study. Mr. Beck pointed out that, owing to his extravagances in
living at the house at Bodiesham and letting himself in for rates
and taxes and other expenses, he was already living beyond his
income. The legatee was obdurate, and the upshot was that some
shares invested in a gas company were sold at a great loss, and
Arthur found himself in possession of one hundred and twelve pounds
in cash. "I shall be able to live in Paris for two years on this,"
he thought.</p>

<p>He brought his painting materials from Bodiesham, bade farewell
to Aunt Elizabeth and Eleanor, had a great night out with Jimmy
Long and Karolyi, and then took his departure from London.</p>

<p>He secured a room in an obscure corner of Montmartre and
attended M. Jules Berthelot's academy. He found the life there
different from the Quartier Latin life which he had read of. The
students at M. Berthelot's were nearly all English and American,
earnest young men anxious to "make good." He met them in class, but
saw very little of their private lives. His stay in Paris was
principally noteworthy for the friendship which he established with
a young Califomian named Leslie Hales.</p>

<p>He was a large-framed, slow-moving young man with a peculiar
intentness of expression. Arthur had never met anyone quite so
interested in life. He had a clear gray eye, and a habit of
thrusting his head forward and listening, as though everything he
heard was of tremendous importance and value. Arthur found unending
delight in going around with Hales. It was like taking a very
intelligent child about. He liked to watch his face and see the
effect of every new experience reflected on it. Extremely
kind-hearted, rather sentimental, not very deep, but tremendously
anxious to be deep, Leslie Hales regarded all the passing phenomena
of daily life as symbols of revelation to stir the depths of his
soul. He was amazed, entranced, bewildered; at times even the
wonderful fecundity of his expressions dried up at the endless
manifestations of beauty and interest being eternally unfolded
before him. To anyone with the cynic tendencies of Arthur, he was
an excellent antidote.</p>

<p>M. Berthelot was an elderly man with a black beard and a very
guttural voice for a Frenchman. Arthur found him difficult to
understand at first, but the students had a code of interpretation
which they passed from one to the other. He would stand in front of
a drawing and make peculiar noises in his throat; then he would
close his hand and wave his thumb backward and forward. This would
mean that the drawing required more movement. At other times he
would look at it, first below, and then above his spectacles, and
stick his hands into the flaps of his trousers, which came in
front, and say:</p>

<p>"Egh! Egh!"</p>

<p>This meant that the drawing was going on all right.</p>

<p>He was never very polite to anyone, and never encouraging, but
he had a faculty of inspiring confidence and even affection.</p>

<p>After the first disastrous attempts, Arthur found painting in
oils more satisfying than water-colors. Occasionally, he and Hales
would go out to Compigne and paint twilight in the Barbizon
manner. It was enormously fascinating.</p>

<p>At the end of November, Edith wrote. She said she had taken a
house in St. John's Wood, near Regent's Park. There was a studio
attached to it which she never used. If at any time he wanted to
come back to London, he could always make use of it, and as there
were two little rooms off it, he could even live there, if he
liked.</p>

<p>He wrote and thanked her, and said he might one day be very glad
to avail himself of her kind offer. He added that he hoped the
children were well.</p>

<p>Arthur's attempts at economy were not very successful; neither
could he account for the way in which the money went. He seemed to
live very cheaply, but there was always the ubiquitous claim of
"extras." There were artist's materials to buy, and a few clothes;
and then, of course, he had to go about a bit and visit the various
theaters, and cabarets, and cafs. Hales was much better off than
he was, and he did not like to appear stingy in his society.
Besides, in the company of his newly-found friend he was very apt
to forget, and to lose his sense of proportion.</p>

<p>So interested were they both in the abstract joys of living that
the mere fact of whether they paid one franc or five francs for a
seat at a <i>caf chantani</i> seemed trivial and hardly worth
considering.</p>

<p>An incident occurred one night that brought home to Arthur the
fact that certain phases of Parisian life were not entirely
fictional. He and Hales were returning from the Caf Rouge, where
they had been listening to a black-haired Bohemian gentleman play
Liszt with impassioned fervor. They were walking down a quiet
street and discussing ethnological characteristics. Arthur casually
observed two men ambling in their direction. Just as they reached
them he saw Hales fall forward, as though pushed, and at the same
moment felt himself gripped from behind. One of the men snatched
his watch, his pocket-book, and other available property on the
front of his person. It was then that something seemed to stir in
the slow-moving Californian. He went off like a firework. It was
amazing. All his limbs seemed to be driving right and left, like
pistons. Arthur found himself on the ground, grabbing a man's legs,
while two bodies fell limply near, one in the gutter, and the other
against the wall. Hales was apparently engaged in breaking up a
third. A fifth man, who had Arthur's watch and pocket-book, had
bolted, and in a few minutes the street seemed to be in a perfect
state of revolution. Swarms of people collected, and the noise was
deafening. They took different sides; a woman scratched Arthur's
face, and another woman tore the first woman's hair. No police
appeared on the scene of this pandemonium for fully ten minutes,
and when they did arrive they did not tend to soothe the
atmosphere. Some people struck at the police, and the chief
gendarme shrieked like a madman and was quite incomprehensible.
When it was observed that Arthur was English, and Hales presumably
of the same nationality, there was more strife and division of
opinion. The English were not popular in Paris at the time of the
Boer War, and after the police had taken their names and addresses,
and the apaches were revived with buckets of cold water and nips of
brandy, the two young men were escorted out of the neighborhood
with boos and jeers, and an occasional missile of a more
substantial character.</p>

<p>When they arrived at their rooms they counted the cost. Arthur
had lost one hundred and sixty francs and his watch, and was badly
cut and bruised, and Hales had a lump the size of an egg on the
back of his head. Nevertheless, the Californian's eyes were glowing
like live coals, and he kept muttering:</p>

<p>"Lordy! Lordy!"</p>

<p>When he looked at himself in the glass he said:</p>

<p>"My! Gaffyn, that was some considerable mix-up. We'll hear no
more of it, you bet. Phew! I've heard say they spring these
surprise-packets sometimes, but I never reckoned to get to grips
with a real apache."</p>

<p>The horizon of Hales's genial experiences was being enlarged
entrancingly. He walked about the room like a cat. Life had never
entertained him so lavishly.</p>

<p>"Jeminy!" he exclaimed after a time, "I'm real sorry about your
pocket-book and timepiece. You'll never get them back. Call on me
if there's anything you want Paris, eh? The hub of civilization.
Jeminy!"</p>

<p>They continued their ethnological discussion till a late hour,
with the practical illustration of their evening's experience as a
basis.</p>

<p>When Christmas arrived Arthur discovered that the one hundred
and twelve pounds, which was to last him two years, was now reduced
to rather less than twenty.</p>

<p><br>
On the twenty-ninth of December he told Hales that he was going
back to London on business for a few days. It was very apparent
that somehow or other he must raise more money. Hales said:</p>

<p>"I wish I could do the round trip with you. I'll be going over
in the spring, anyway. My folks are coming from California. They're
going to make London their headquarters and buzz round for
awhile."</p>

<p>Arthur did not suspect that this casual remark was to have a
very important bearing on his life.</p>

<p>On the very first evening he had spent with Hales, the latter
had told him all about his "folks," and given him the full story
and details about each one of them. He had, on the same occasion,
told him his views on religion, art, and philosophy. He had invited
him to come out with him to California when he returned, and to
stay with him as long as he liked, as his guest. He had asked
Arthur a hundred and one questions about himself, and had deplored
the lack of religious feeling in modern France, and also the dearth
of good breakfast cereals. He invited him to use his well-appointed
<i>appartement</i> as often and in any old way he liked, and to
come and take his books or anything else he fancied, without
asking.</p>

<p>Arthur was a little aware that if Hales had not seen him again
after that evening, he would probably have forgotten him forthwith.
Nevertheless, at the moment he was entirely sincere. He had a way
of coming up close and saying:</p>

<p>"Now, just tell me exactly what you feel about so-and-so."</p>

<p>He would listen interestedly for some minutes, occasionally
interjecting:</p>

<p>"You don't say!"</p>

<p>He did not seem to care to pursue a subject to any degree of
profundity. Life was too full of these surprising and entertaining
things to waste a great deal of time on any one particular phase of
it. His attitude toward life was precisely that of a child with a
new toy. His large, kind, sympathetic face was as open as a book,
and his eyes reflected the quick sensibility of his mind. Without
being excessively clever, he had great breadth of outlook and a
certain broad tolerance. Arthur found it was just as difficult to
hurt him mentally as the apache found it hard to hurt him
physically. He was invulnerable. If in one of his perverse moods
Arthur would say something rather cutting, or something which
reflected on the character of the Californian, he would observe him
turning it over in his mind as he muttered:</p>

<p>"Is that so! Well! well!"</p>

<p>And he would be perfectly certain that the inner reflection
would be:</p>

<p>"Well, now, that's mighty interesting."</p>

<p>A fault was merely a reflection of another aspect of the
splendid toy.</p>

<p>So prodigiously did Hales talk, and such a wide field of
acquaintances did he describe in detail that the casual reference
to "my folks" did not stir in Arthur any particular
recollection.</p>

<p>He bade his friend <i>au revoir</i>, and returned to London and Mr.
Beck.</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII&mdash;ALICE FLIES A KITE</h2>

<p>Some there may be whose lives, regulated by the moral bias of
their training and tradition, lead through what appear to us the
normal processes of predestination. In their youth you may observe
them gazing into the rigid perspective of their future. It is true
the ebb and flow of material fortune may be an uncertain factor in
their development, but so ingrained within them are certain moral
precepts, so sure is their fundamental conception of their life
purpose, that one has only to glance at some child to say:</p>

<p>"If God spares little Charlie, he will one day become a bishop,"
or "If Edna makes eyes like that, she is destined to become the
mistress of a soap king."</p>

<p>One feels that after childhood everything important is finished.
The rest is merely the <i>rptition gnrale</i> of the drama
conceived in the dim ages of primordial lust, and tediously
rehearsed during the centuries of physical and moral struggle. The
performance itself is an affair of puppets, so well manipulated by
the Great Producer that we believe they are real actors and
actresses. We say: "How magnificent George looks in his sailor
suit! And wasn't it fine the way he killed the pirate chief!"</p>

<p>Or we say:</p>

<p>"How exquisitely the duchess handed Mrs. Bung a cup of tea!"</p>

<p>And we applaud these actions as being real and splendid
episodes. And when a poet says, "The child is father to the man,"
we accept it as a whimsical and poetic license, and not as a hard,
concrete, scientific fact.</p>

<p>Others there are of whom we cannot take stock. They are the
wayward children whose impulses make the history-books uncertain
records. Sometimes they lead great lives obscurely; at other times
they lead mean lives, although they figure on a great canvas. It
has yet to be completely understood that there never was a hero,
except a stage hero. Some children have had the heroic impulse more
strongly developed than other children, and with the help of
grease-paint, and limelight, and the prompter, they have forced
their men-or-women-children down to the footlights, and made them
strut as heroes, and people in the pit have cried: "Hurrah!
hurrah!"</p>

<p>But for the most part, we in the pit are clever enough to know
that we shout this more for our own satisfaction than because we
believe it. We are really applauding the amiable virtues which the
actor symbolizes, and which we would so much like to emulate
ourselves. We shout because we in the pit are very good critics,
and we want to impress the producers with the sense of our approval
of that always commendable tag, "virtue rewarded, vice
vanquished."</p>

<p>And the difference we note in the eyes of these wayward children
is that they already perceive that life is a fluid, and not a rigid
business. They gaze into their perspective until they behold some
point which becomes the center of a new sphere of experience. At
any moment the whole system of life may revolve round that.</p>

<p>Heredity, environment, moods, digestion, nerves, impulses,
prejudice, and passion&mdash;all these old actors in the dead drama
have passed away, but you read the influence of their work on the
faces of the wayward children.</p>

<p>It was not without reason that the boys of Cullington School
called Arthur, "Moods." And the illustrations he gave of this
unreliable quality during the following year were more varied and
illuminating than perhaps at any other period of his life. He
worried the life out of Mr. Beck. He would turn up and demand that
certain interests and shares be sold, so that he might prosecute
his studies in Paris. In a few weeks' time he would return and ask
him to reinvest this money as he had decided that he would never be
a painter; he was coming back to live in London and going into some
commercial business. Then he would appear again, probably the next
morning, and explain that after all he thought he would complete
his studies in Paris. One day he wrote that he had decided to sell
the bungalow at Bodiesham, but a telegram arrived before the
letter, saying, "Don't sell. Cancel instructions. Calling." But of
course he didn't call, or in any case, not for two months, and then
it was with the object of raising more money in order to go to
Italy. But he never went to Italy. He stayed on in Paris and took
to writing essays and verse.</p>

<p>At the end of that year he had expended nearly one half of the
capital that his father had left him, and he was as unsettled and
undetermined about his future as ever. He became more and more
convinced that painting was not his right means of expression, but
he hung on in Paris because he liked being there with Hales, and he
thought he might as well do there whatever he was going to do, as
in London.</p>

<p>Other things also contributed to the general unsettling of his
outlook, and one of them was the visit of Hales's "folks" to Paris
in the spring.</p>

<p><br>
Hales's "folks" proved to be a mother and a sister. The mother was
a diminutive little woman who barely came up to her son's elbow.
She had bright eyes and a vivacious manner, and the same friendly,
confiding way of talking. She gave everyone the impression of
having taken a sudden personal liking to them, and so, indeed, she
usually had. The sister was fifteen, and Arthur fell in love with
her at once. Alice was a composite of her mother and brother. She
had tremendous animation. "She's a streak of life," Arthur thought
when he first observed her. She exuded life. Her eyes danced with
the eternal fun of the thing. The sun was in her hair, her eyes,
her skin, and the joyous movements of her trim little school-girl
body. She was very straight and compact, and always gave Arthur the
impression that she had just washed her hair. He loved her hair. It
was very light brown, and thick and wavy. In some ways she was
surprisingly old and self-possessed, and in other ways an
incorrigible baby. Her brother called her "Pipsie" for some reason
or other, and she called him "Boodles."</p>

<p>They were charming folk, and they all behaved to each other like
lovers. Arthur was fascinated watching them. He had never before
met people like them. They were so intensely interested in every
little thing concerning each other. It was on the second night of
their arrival that Arthur was invited to meet Hales's folks at his
rooms. And although Arthur knew that the mother and sister had been
there nearly two days, they behaved as though they had only just
begun to talk about things. They wanted to know exactly about
everything in the flat, what everything was and why it was, how he
managed about this, that, and the other; what he did if the
concierge failed to turn up, how he managed to entertain visitors,
how he got to M. Berthelot's studio, where he kept his linen, and,
a very important point, what he did about breakfast cereals.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hales's greeting to Arthur was:</p>

<p>"Mr. Gaffyn, I'm very, very pleased to meet you. My son is quite
crazy about you and your work. Now just tell me all about yourself.
What you think of the life here, and what you think of Leslie."</p>

<p>During dinner they both expressed a wish to visit Arthur's room.
Arthur said of course he'd be delighted, only his place was a mere
pigsty.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Hales said:</p>

<p>"Why, we'll just love to come."</p>

<p>And Alice added:</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Gaffyn, we'll be just tickled to death."</p>

<p>So they came, and saw, and were tickled to death.</p>

<p>And after they had gone Arthur sighed and thought:</p>

<p>"I wish that girl were ten years older."</p>

<p>And he dreamed of her soft brown hair, and the quick way she had
of suddenly looking straight at him.</p>

<p><br>
They stayed in Paris a month, and Arthur saw a good deal of them.
He occasionally managed to have a walk alone with Alice, and he
found her a fascinating child. She talked to him as though they
were old friends.</p>

<p>"I often tried to figure out what you were like," she said one
day. "You know, when Boodles gets a pen in his hand, there's no
stopping him. He covered reams with a description of you, but I
don't think you're a bit like he said. I shouldn't have thought you
were English. You haven't any of the 'don't-you-know' sort of
thing."</p>

<p>"My mother was French. Perhaps that accounts for it," said
Arthur, smiling.</p>

<p>"French, was she? I should have liked to have known your mother.
Tell me about her. Tell me all about your folks."</p>

<p>And Arthur told her a good deal, and she kept looking at him
with her quick glance of interest and sympathy. Then she said:</p>

<p>"What are your ambitions, Mr. Gaffyn?"</p>

<p>Arthur pondered this comprehensive question for a moment, and
answered:</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know that I'm very ambitious."</p>

<p>And then the child said a surprising thing. As she spoke, he
watched her square chin, and her eyes bent on the ground as she
swung along with big strides.</p>

<p>"I want you to be ambitious. Everybody ought to be ambitious. I
don't mean ambitious to make money or become famous. I mean
ambitious to help in the big thing. I'm going to do what I can. I'm
going up to Smith College next fall. If I do well there, I'm going
to take up medicine. And then I'm going to help people&mdash;you
know, help in all sorts of ways. There's such a lot to be done. I'm
afraid people are very silly and bad, and they want helping. Don't
you think so?"</p>

<p>Arthur said he thought they did, but he could not help laughing.
She laughed, too, and said:</p>

<p>"It's too bad to laugh at me. I know you think I'm a
high-brow."</p>

<p>Arthur said he didn't quite know what a "highbrow" was, but if
it was a person who said very wise things at a very early age, he
agreed with her.</p>

<p>"But this isn't very wise," she said.</p>

<p>"'People are silly and bad, and they want helping!'" he quoted.
"I think that's the wisest thing I've ever heard. I shall always
remember that."</p>

<p>They entered the Luxembourg gardens which were, as usual, full
of the kind-faced <i>bonnes</i> with their charges. Some small boys
were flying kites. The eyes of Alice danced with delight and she
suddenly seized Arthur's arm and said:</p>

<p>'"Will you come here and fly a kite with me one day?"</p>

<p>"Of course I will."</p>

<p>"When! To-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes. To-morrow."</p>

<p>Arthur agreed to get the kite, and he did so that very
afternoon. He gave an inordinate number of francs for it, for he
wanted a fine kite with a long tail, a kite worthy of Alice.</p>

<p>The following morning he called for her at Hales's rooms, and
the other two were just as eager about the kite, and wanted to
come, too, but Alice said:</p>

<p>"No! you've got to stay home, or go and look at stuffy old
pictures. I'm going alone to fly the kite with Mr. Gaffyn. We're
going to play around together."</p>

<p>And Mrs. Hales said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Gaffyn, be careful! This young lady has evidently set her
cap at you, and when she does that, she's inclined to be
dangerous."</p>

<p>And Leslie took Arthur solemnly by the coat-sleeve and said:</p>

<p>"Arthur, I'm sorry to have to tell you that my sister is
notoriously the worst flirt in the whole of Los Angeles, and that's
a mighty speedy spot."</p>

<p>And then Alice assaulted him with such violence that he was
obliged to go down on his hands and knees and sue for pardon. And
so they set off alone.</p>

<p>It was an ideal day for flying a kite. There was a gentle
breeze, and the blue sky was fleeced with tiny white clouds. They
had some difficulty in getting the kite to rise, and Alice seemed
to know more about it than he did. She made him run with it about
fifty yards, while she held the other end of the cord. It swerved
and took eccentric angles above the earth, and then suddenly swung
upward. Alice let out yards and yards of slack, and followed it up,
and Arthur joined her and they ran across the grass together. They
ran and ran, backwards and forwards, till the kite seemed almost a
speck in the air.</p>

<p>"Look! look!" Alice cried ecstatically. "Isn't it
<i>splendid</i>?"</p>

<p>He looked at her face. She was gazing up at the sky with her
lips parted, and her clear shining eyes reflected the blue light of
the sky. Arthur was conscious of a complete and satisfying moment.
There came to him a tense appreciation of the beauty of that stuff
we call "young life." He felt for this small girl a love that was
in some way connected with the vibrant splendors of that radiant
day. He realized in that moment that the child had suddenly
introduced into his life some force that could not be destroyed,
epitomizing as she did, not merely the vision of a new race and a
new friendship, but the vision of youth itself, the most
indestructible thing in nature. He thought to himself: "How I would
love to have a little girl like you. Some one to worship and lavish
all that I have upon, and who would believe in me despite all the
world."</p>

<p>He would want nothing more than the touch of her hair, and the
right of kindred worship. To stand by her side and gaze up at the
sky, and to feel the full force of all living things crying
out:</p>

<p>"Aye, it's <i>splendid! splendid! splendid!</i>"</p>

<p>And, indeed, the cup of Alice's happiness was very full on that
morning. She made him carry home the kite. And they took a cab, and
on the way called at a confectioner's and bought candies, and
arrived home very late for lunch, neither feeling at all
hungry.</p>

<p>Leslie's greeting was:</p>

<p>"Well, Gaff, did she make love to you?"</p>

<p>And Arthur replied:</p>

<p>"No; but we had a splendid morning."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV&mdash;A NEW CENTURY DAWNS</h2>

<p>TO what extent the moody and vacillating behavior of Arthur
throughout the rest of that year was due to the little episode of
flying a kite with a school-girl, it would be difficult to
determine. It is certain that after the departure of Alice and her
mother, he settled down to work in a preoccupied manner. The moods,
in fact, did not begin to have any operative effect until the late
summer, when, according to the testimony of Hales, the boy began
"to prance" in a most disturbing manner. Four times that autumn he
went across to London on some wild project, and then returned.</p>

<p>At Christmas time he bade a definite farewell to his friend,
announcing that he had decided to return to London for good, and to
take up literary work.</p>

<p>The American, who had had definite farewells made to him before,
took it with all due solemnity, but in his inmost heart fully
expected to see his friend return within the ensuing week.</p>

<p>And so indeed he did, but in this case it was to report on the
effect of certain external events upon his mind, events which had
the effect of bringing to a head the half-formed slumbering
resolutions of the year.</p>

<p>When he returned to London he pitched his camp once more at Aunt
Elizabeth's, but he cast his eye longingly on the studio flat that
Edith had offered him. He would have liked to have taken it, but he
resented this eleemosynary aspect of his friendship with Edith.
When he had refused the offer of it and gone back to Paris, she had
said:</p>

<p>"Well, I expect it will be here when you come back."</p>

<p>There was an uncomfortable sense of fatality about the way Edith
said these things.</p>

<p>"It means," Arthur thought, "that I am eventually destined to
occupy it."</p>

<p>And for that very reason he fought against it. Every free spirit
hates having a destiny. So he stayed at Aunt Elizabeth's, and
"mooched" about London in a still unsettled frame of mind.</p>

<p>He visited his friends at Blinkinshaw's and surveyed once more
this restless arena of discontent. The Boer War had affected the
decorative trade rather adversely. There was an air of uncertainty
and suspicion about the place. Several of the designers had been
dismissed, and there were rumors and rumors. Arthur had harbored
the idea that if things went badly, he could always return there,
but now it seemed rather questionable. What was going to happen to
him? He felt himself drifting helplessly. He was spending the small
capital his father had left him, and he was not sure even now that
he had chosen his right profession. He was twenty-five, and was
wandering through life without any direct motive or ambition. What
was it "they" had said about his family! That they couldn't make up
their minds? His father, his Uncle Harvey, who was no good, his
Uncle Brian, "who died among naked savages."</p>

<p>"After all," he thought, "it doesn't much matter where you die.
But one ought to live, somehow."</p>

<p><br>
The last day of that year was the last day of the old century, and
Jimmy Long and several others arranged to see the new century in.
They decided to dine at Pollini's, then have one or two drinks, and
ultimately make their way to St. Paul's Cathedral at twelve
o'clock. Arthur was invited to join them.</p>

<p>The arrangement did not work out according to schedule, owing to
a sudden demand from Mr. Fred Blinkinshaw for some drawings that
had to go off by a train that night to Leeds. Jimmy Long and
Learoyd were engaged on them, but not Levistock or Karolyi.
Consequently, when Arthur turned up he was taken by a section of
the party to the bar of "The Queen of Rumania" to await the others.
"The Queen of Rumania" was in quite her best New Year's Eve mood.
The saloon was crowded with salesmen and others from the firm, and
a good sprinkling of designers. There was considerable toasting and
standing treat. By eight o'clock a goodly proportion of these
gentlemen were, in Levistock's words, "well oiled." They stood
leaning against the bar, with their glasses at incredibly dangerous
angles, and glowing at each other with friendly nods and winks.</p>

<p>"Well, good luck, old boy!"</p>

<p>"I deserve it. Go' bless yer. What'll you have!"</p>

<p>"Good luck, Henry! Good luck, Mr. Smith!"</p>

<p>"Mine's a Scotch and small 'polly.'"</p>

<p>"Well, cheer-o, old pal, and a very happy New Year and many of
'em."</p>

<p>"New century, you mean. Here you are, many new centuries, Mr.
Bert! Good luck to you! Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't mind telling you, dear boy, if my turnover is as
good this year as last, I've nothing to grumble about."</p>

<p>"I've done pretty well. I'll have the same again, please, Miss
Purvis; not too much soda."</p>

<p>"Good luck, Charlie! Good luck, Fred! A 'appy New Year!"</p>

<p><br>
It was nine o'clock before Jimmy Long and the others joined them,
and as Pollini's was rather full, they all adjourned upstairs to
the dining-soom of the "Queen of Rumania."</p>

<p>They had chops and steaks and tankards of ale, and became
extremely noisy. After that, as there were still more than two
hours to put in before the midnight service at St. Paul's, they
decided to go to the Oxford Music-Hall. It was several hundred
yards to this place of entertainment; consequently, it appeared
necessary on the way to call at one or two houses for refreshment.
The streets were very crowded, and they went along arm-in-arm,
singing and shouting; nor were they by any means conspicuous in
doing so. When they arrived in the music-hall, it was so crowded
there was only just room to stand up at the back of the lounge.
They could not see the stage, but they could hear the cheers when
portraits of famous generals were thrown on the screen, and they
all joined lustily in the chorus of:</p>

<p class="poem">"Sons of the Empire marching out to war,<br>
With our brave colonials from the distant shore."</p>

<p>They soon tired of this, however, and went to the bar at the
back, where were crowds of other young men like themselves, and
older men, and colored men, and dark featured foreigners, and
prostitutes. Some of the party was mislaid here, and they never
came across them again. At about eleven o'clock Arthur, and
Levistock, and a young man named Kettle left the music-hall and
started out for St. Paul's. It took them nearly an hour to reach
there. The streets were full of drunken people, and hawkers and
impromptu orchestras. Kettle insisted on visiting more
public-houses, and became very drunk and quarrelsome. In the Strand
they left him in the center of a crowd of people. He was
endeavoring to convince a big Canadian soldier that Canada was
geographically a smaller country than Spain. He seemed to stand a
level chance of being murdered, and the other two were not anxious
to share the same fate.</p>

<p>When they came to the upper end of Cheapside it was nearly
twelve o'clock. The crowd was enormous, and quite out of hand. They
were pressed back against a shop-window. They could see nothing but
the people near them, and the great dome of the cathedral looming
solemnly against the night sky. The noise was deafening. Groups of
people were singing different songs&mdash;patriotic airs, and
jingles, and hymns. A line of drunken Scottish soldiers nearby were
trying to join hands and sing "Auld Lang Syne," but the song was
lost in the general din. A sailor and a civilian were fighting at
the corner of the street near where they stood, and a prostitute
was shrieking because some one had torn her hat off. A few
individuals were gazing dumbly heavenward, as though prepared to be
impressed by the solemnity of the hour, but for the most part it
was a composite dirge of drink and disunion. And as they looked
round at this heaving mass of fuddled humanity, with its drunken
soldiers and sailors, and white-faced civilians, and pickpockets,
and charlatans, and loose women and adventurers, the great clock
struck twelve. Levistock touched Arthur's arm, and nodded in the
direction of the cathedral:</p>

<p>"Hark at it! Two thousand years of the teaching of Jesus
Christ!"</p>

<p>And then it was that the naked ugliness of the whole thing came
home to the boy. He was not in the mood to reason that, after all,
these people were only a small minority, the dregs of a very large
and cumbrous civilization, that they did not represent the
cathedral round which they held their orgie. He accepted them as in
every way symbolical of the age, the product of Christian teaching,
and commercial enterprise, and "progress." He would not grant that
at that moment there were millions of people sleeping in their
beds, or even singing in their drawing-rooms, who were leading
decent and courageous lives. He saw only the grim sordidness of it
all, the significance of this epic confusion.</p>

<p>Struggle, struggle, struggle&mdash;there was nothing else.
Through all these two thousand years they had done nothing but
fight for the mean and wretched wherewithal to exist. And now, like
a great sea, they came surging round the walls of this church which
had professed to mother them. Work without love, life without
beauty, struggle without hope, disunited, quarrelsome, lascivious,
pitiable. He thought of the salesmen in the "Queen of Rumania."</p>

<p>"Good luck, old boy. If my turnover is as good this year as
last&mdash;"</p>

<p>That was all. The sole epitome of luck, the good turnover! More
money, more comfort, more security, more drink. And so they would
go on. Another two thousand years, and other men would come. Some
would have been "lucky" and some would not, and the prostitute with
her towzled hair would still shriek because some one had torn her
hat and the crowd was jeering at her.</p>

<p>What did this raging sea care for the gentle eyes of his father,
for what was valuable in himself, for the "hare-brained ideas" of
Mr. Leffbury? Dash all this high-falutin' sensibility to pieces!
Eat, drink, and persuade yourself you're gay; for to-morrow another
will take your place!</p>

<p>He hated Levistock for using that phrase, "Two thousand years of
the teaching of Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>All the church-bells were ringing, and the sirens from factories
and steamers down on the river were hurling their strident
challenge to the stars. It sounded like the prolonged shriek of
some wild beast that has attained the culmination of its feral
passion. He felt faint and exhausted, and he evaded Levistock and
darted down a side street. His one thought was, "I must get away
from this."</p>

<p>What was he to do? Were other cities any better than this!
Certainly not Paris. Berlin? St. Petersburg? New York? Were they
not all on that night giving expression to the triumphant
realization of their two thousand years of abortive culture? Could
it go on? Was there not already behind it all some dark menace of
destruction? He hurried down a side street where great newspapers
were going to press. He heard the dull throb of the machines and,
in the rooms above, the click of typewriters and telephones.</p>

<p>The work-box!</p>

<p><i>Dot-dot-dash-dash-dash-click-click</i> secret codes and
messages. Intrigues, whispers, rumors, jealousies, personal feuds,
secret diplomacy. Already in locked chambers old men were at work,
peevish old men who held the happiness of the world in their hands,
and they were working without love in their hearts.</p>

<p>In the neighborhood of Oxford Street he visited a coffee-stall,
for he was cold and hungry.</p>

<p>There was a small group of men gathered round the stall, and a
thin white-faced young man was arguing testily with the
coffee-stall keeper. Arthur could not catch the drift of the
disputation, but he could see the profile of the young man, with
his collar turned up and his hat right over his eyes, and he heard
his cockney voice rise to a whining crescendo:</p>

<p>"Ugh! a lot yew do for people, I must say! A lot yew do!"</p>

<p>And then the gruff voice of the coffee-stall keeper, as he
vigorously buttered a piece of toast:</p>

<p>"I do what I can."</p>

<p>There was something in that. If only everybody would do what
they could.</p>

<p>He hurried on in the direction of Bayswater, and let himself
into Aunt Elizabeth's house. It was very dark and cold, and he went
straight to bed. He fell into a heavy sleep, but awakened a few
hours later. He was rather feverish. The woman with the towzled
hair, shrieking near the cathedral because the people jeered at
her, kept haunting his memory. He felt in some dim way that he was
responsible, that he ought to have helped her and defended her. It
was very terrible. And then the other voice, strangely
comforting:</p>

<p>"I do what I can."</p>

<p>He slept at last, hugging the vision of a fat-faced man
vigorously buttering a piece of toast.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV&mdash;THE REFORMER</h2>

<p>On the following evening Edith Yardley had a surprising
experience. She arrived home about eight o'clock, having attended a
committee-meeting of a society that had for its object the better
welfare of young and indigent mothers. When the maid opened the
door she said:</p>

<p>"Mister Arthur is here in the drawing-room. He has been waiting
for you nearly two hours."</p>

<p>Edith said:</p>

<p>"Oh. Thank you."</p>

<p>And she put her muff and chatelaine down on the hall-table, and
hurried into the room and shut the door. When she looked at Arthur
standing by the fireplace, she was aware that he was laboring under
the stress of some great emotion. She did not immediately ask him
what the trouble was; she spoke soothingly, apologized for keeping
him waiting, and asked him to stay to dinner. But the boy seemed at
a loss, and almost incoherent. He said he was not hungry; that he
had "just called in." And then Edith showed a touch of that quality
which was part and parcel of her genius for management. She went
down on her knees and poked the fire until it blazed; and then she
rose and switched off the electric light, so that the room was only
illumined by firelight. After that she took him by the arm and made
him sit in a corner of the Chesterfield. She herself sat in the
opposite corner, and shaded her eyes with her hands so that he
could not see them. They sat there silently for some minutes,
listening to the crackling of the flames. Then she said in a very
low voice:</p>

<p>"Tell me what it is."</p>

<p>He started by saying he didn't know; it was really nothing. He
just felt rather down about things; that was all. Then he paused,
and with some hesitation started telling her about his previous
evening's experience and how it had affected him. He gradually
became more animated, and leaned forward and conjured visions out
of the flames.</p>

<p>"Honestly, I'm frightened. I can't think what's going to happen.
Of course I know there are decent people and all that, but God,
it's this dead weight in the foreground. It isn't their viciousness
so much; there's a lot of rough good-humor and kindness among them.
It's their frightful ignorance, commonness, not in the coarse
sense, but in the ignorant sense, poverty of idea, poverty of
ambition, poverty of taste. Look at their homes, the things they
buy if they have money, their ideas of pleasure, of amusement! I've
been thinking of it all night. Besides, it isn't a minority; it's
the bulk of people. They're no better in Paris. And the tragedy is,
so many are contented; they think it's all right. I don't think I'm
a socialist. I don't know. I detest politics. Politics are all
about economics. I can't see that a man who lives in a palace in
Kensington is essentially luckier or happier than a man in one room
in Stepney. What I see is the vast untapped spiritual wealth. It's
all going to decay."</p>

<p>The boy stopped and glanced at the woman, but as he could not
see her eyes, he looked back at the fire.</p>

<p>"I want to do something about this, Edith. I have been thinking,
and thinking, and thinking. I want to change my profession again. I
want to do what I can. I'm not clever enough to frame policies, or
reconstruct the social fabric or whatever they call it, but I could
do something, a sort of mission of discontent. Don't you see! I
want to keep hammering at the idea that no one must be contented.
One must always be restlessly striving for finer things, for higher
things. I want to write; not direct propaganda, but stuff that
reflects realities, and has point and significance&mdash;plays, I
think. They have a more direct appeal. Everybody goes to the
theater; hardly anybody reads. It isn't only the poor who are
'common.' I thought of a play last night. I worked it all out; at
least, a lot of it is vague, but I've got the main idea. Shall I
tell you what it is?"</p>

<p>He saw the outline of her face, and her hand shading the fire
from her eyes, as she whispered:</p>

<p>"Tell me."</p>

<p>"It is very simple. It is the drama of the conflict of opposing
forces struggling for an illusion. In the struggle the people don't
destroy each other; they destroy the illusion. It sounds trite, and
so are many big things. As I see the world at the present day, we
are like the Gaddarene swine rushing down the steep place."</p>

<p>He moved nearer to the woman on the Chesterfield and altered the
tone of his voice:</p>

<p>"In this race for material prosperity, suppose one day something
should happen. Suppose the big thing we're struggling for should
prove an illusion. Let us imagine, for instance, all these great
powers and cnnning chancelleries who have erected this colossal
system of material values so artfully interdependent; imagine one
day that the greed and lust for the control of them became so great
that they flew at each other's throats, like wild beasts&mdash;a
colossal war, so great that everybody was in it, every ounce of
material value was poured into the thing. And in the struggle the
thing itself should be destroyed. That is to say, that all
commercial values should be destroyed, and then when they counted
the cost, they found that these values were only an illusion, that
commercial values were of no value. Then, perhaps, they would
return to the work-box with love in their hearts."</p>

<p>He looked up, and seemed to expect her to speak, but she
remained in the shadow.</p>

<p>"I have something within me, some sort of gift; I don't know
what it is. I want to express myself. I am an artist, I suppose; a
person whose mission is to shape things, to influence, to discover
beauty which has been there all the time, dormant, perhaps, to some
others. But O God! how many of these others there are! How dead
they are! Buried under the crumbling masonry of this social muddle.
And what I feel is, it isn't all economics, it isn't necessary to
be rich to see beauty, to find beauty in one's work, to be
courageous and to have fine thoughts and feelings. But as it is,
this canker of material progression is growing, and growing, and
growing, and unless we all do what we can, there'll be nothing left
but the surgeon's knife. Do you know what I mean by the surgeon's
knife? The sudden dull rumble of distant guns, and then the end!
The blasting of all material values into nothingness, the maiming
and slaughtering of young men like cattle. Who was it said, 'The
central fact of war is the blood and brains of man scattered over a
field of mud'! I forget. Nothing like that will count. The
surgeon's knife will be very effective. There will be no quarter,
no mercy, no abiding by rules, no concession to humanity until the
whole of these material values have been exorcized. Then the thing
will stop of itself, exhausted. But hearts will break for all time
from the sheer pity of it. There will be the desperate
reconstruction. Some genius will discover the new point round which
the rejuvenated system will revolve. That, perhaps, will be the
surprise&mdash;the realization that the rigid conceptions of old
are dead. Then the world will be ruled from within, and not from
without. Why should we wait for this! Why should there not spring
up now among the peoples a class something on the lines of the
<i>intelligentzia</i> in Russia, people who love the arts and
sciences, and the love of work, forming a dead weight to sit on the
chests of these old men who rule the world&mdash;an impossible
people, you can do nothing with, who refuse to hate anyone, who
insist on being intelligent despite their training?"</p>

<p>He leaned forward and held out his hands toward the fire. Then
he added:</p>

<p>"Don't imagine I think this could be brought about suddenly. But
it's the thing to work for. Imagine it! A sort of freemasonry of
love, with its ramifications in every civilized country. It would
be tremendous. The women are already restless. They are banding
together, and quite rightly. There may come a struggle of the
sexes, and it may be followed by the struggle of youth against age.
For too long has the world been ruled by the old; the time of the
young is coming. Edith, will you help me in this! I don't know how
it is, but last night everyone appeared unstable, vacillating. I
don't mean the people who had been drinking. They were rolling
about like tubs. I mean all the people I could think of, and the
people who rule and order and write; and as I surveyed them
mentally, you seemed to be the one reliable figure in this shifting
kaleidoscope. I had to come and tell you."</p>

<p>He gazed at her, and she seemed curiously silent and watchful;
not a bit like the old Edith who used to come butting in, and
arranging, and managing things for people. He liked this new aspect
of her. He felt convinced that she would help him, but that she
would help him in his way and not in her way; that she understood.
Her voice came out of the darkness:</p>

<p>"I'm so glad this has happened, Arthur. It was nice of you to
come to me. It makes me proud. Yes, yes, yes, I know exactly how
you feel. I have felt these things, too, bitterly. I am older, more
experienced; it is all very difficult and&mdash;" She seemed about
to give expression to some opinion, and then changed her mind. She
came nearer to him, and took his hands, and placed them on her
knees. In the dim light her face looked pinched and strained.</p>

<p>"Of course I'll help you. It will be splendid. You shall come
here and work in the studio. You shall live there just as you like.
It shall be quite independent of the house. You can come in and
have your meals with me, or you can have them sent in to you. You
must always confide in me, tell me what you're doing. I'm not
clever, Arthur. You give me much greater credit for ability than I
really have. But I will help you. I will see that everything is
done for you. I will make you a great man."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I want to be a great man," the boy
answered.</p>

<p>"But I want you to be a great man. It is the only stipulation I
make. The greater you are, the more good you can do. Isn't that so?
Oh, it'll be fine! I shall watch you growing and growing, and being
talked about, and I shall be very proud."</p>

<p>The fire was dying down, and he could only observe the
intermittent glimpses of her chin and brow. He could not see her
eyes. A gong rang in the hall, and she said in a changed voice:</p>

<p>"When did you last eat, Arthur!"</p>

<p>He replied:</p>

<p>"Oh, I had some tea and things about midday. I haven't felt like
eating. I drank some whisky last night. It always makes me feel
rotten."</p>

<p>"You must come and have some soup."</p>

<p>"I don't think I will."</p>

<p>She took his arm and led him into the hall. He again protested,
and she smiled and said:</p>

<p>"If you don't come and have some soup, I sha'n't help you to
reform the world."</p>

<p>A sudden resentful feeling came to him that she was mocking him,
treating him like a baby.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to be bossed entirely by this woman," he thought,
and he walked deliberately to the hat-stand. He already had his
coat on, when he found her at his elbow. For the first time that
evening he looked into her eyes. There was a strange pleading look
he had never seen before.</p>

<p>"Arthur, don't you see! I'm sometimes very lonely. You might
stay a little while."</p>

<p>Never before could he recollect Edith appealing to him. It
flattered his sense of dynamic power. He was no longer the
school-boy to be told to wash his hands, or "not to slouch." He had
asserted himself, and the act produced a pleasurable sensation. He
removed his coat and answered:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. Of course, I wasn't thinking."</p>

<p>He stayed till half-past ten and elaborated his schemes for
future work, and Edith discussed the practical details of his home
affairs. It would be necessary for him to return to Paris to
collect various belongings and settle a few minor matters. In a
week's time he hoped to start on his mission to write plays, "stuff
that reflects realities, and has point and significance."</p>

<p>He surprised Mr. Beck the following morning by calling on him
and returning eighty-five pounds, which he asked him to "put back
in the gas-works." Mr. Beck gave him up as a bad case, and put the
money in the bank.</p>

<p>"He will come back to-morrow and want it again," he thought, not
unreasonably.</p>

<p><br>
His one regret in cutting short his student career in Paris so
precipitately was the severance of the companionship of Hales. He
thought the whole matter over and decided that the best plan was to
tell the big Californian precisely all about it. So he invited him
to dinner at the Caf du Bourse, which was a favorite haunt of
theirs. The cooking was excellent, and the management supplied a
red wine in old bottles covered with cobwebs. Some evilly-disposed
people used to aver that Monsieur Badet had a special
breeding-place for cobwebs, which he applied to comparatively new
bottles, but these people were generally indigent students who
resented the fact that they were not at the moment in a position to
purchase the good fare at Monsieur Badet's table.</p>

<p>In any case, the cobwebs always gave an added piquancy to the
occasional imbibings of Arthur and Hales, neither of whom knew
anything about wine. When the cork was drawn. Hales would put his
nose to the top of the bottle and say: "My! that's a mighty fine
bouquet, Gaffyn." And when Arthur had sipped it, he would say: "By
Jove; this wine's jolly good to-night." Consequently, why should
anyone begrudge Monsieur Badet his innocuous assiduity!</p>

<p>Certainly on this occasion the cobwebs were prolific. They
covered the label and hung in cloudy mists round the neck of the
bottle. The waiter apologized for disturbing them when he removed
the cork.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm very, very sorry you're going," Hales remarked, as an
oval dish of whitebait was set before them. "Now just tell me
exactly how it all came about."</p>

<p>Arthur started diffidently and apologetically, and then
described the scene on New Year's Eve. He became eloquent, and
Hales was kept busy interjecting: "You don't say!" or "Is that
so?"</p>

<p>When the picture was completed he remarked inevitably:</p>

<p>"Well, now, that's mighty interesting!"</p>

<p>"Tell me," Arthur said. "What is New York like! Or the other
American cities?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied his friend, "on the stunt you're going on, it's
much of a muchness. Of course, there are some striking
dissimilarities. There's less drink, ever so much less drink. We're
a comparatively temperate folk, and our domestic lives are, for the
most part, pure and sweet. But when it comes to what you call
'materialism.' My! we have Europe guessing."</p>

<p>Hales swirled some claret round in the bottom of his glass; then
he said:</p>

<p>"I get the drift of what you're after, Gaff; and I admire your
attitude. Where I think you're a bit wrong is in judging a people
by some external symbols. That bunch of hooligans who loafed round
St. Paul's on New Year's Eve don't represent England, any more than
those apaches who tried to do us up in the Rue Quatre Septembre
represent Paris. Society is a big thing. It's come down through a
lot of very dark work. We're only a small fraction of a big
tradition. The majority of people are dead, and we're just clearing
up the mess a bit."</p>

<p>"On the contrary," Arthur said, "it seems to me that the
majority of people are unborn. And the point is, what are we doing
for the unborn people? At present we're preparing a mess for them.
We're making it as difficult as possible."</p>

<p>"I don't agree with you there. I think we're progressing. I
grant you all the external ugliness, but look how these cobwebs
conceal this fine old wine!"</p>

<p>Hales poured himself out another glass, and continued:</p>

<p>"Where I think my people have it on Europe is that they do
believe in and appreciate the good wine under the cobwebs. They're
younger, you know. They have more hope, more faith, more belief in
themselves. And, by God! look at the kindness and charity and
humanitarian movements there are to-day, compared with a hundred
years ago. It was probably ugly then, only the ugly things have
been destroyed, and it was certainly more cruel. Why, in those days
they would hang a young boy for stealing a leg of mutton!"</p>

<p>Arthur thought for a moment, and then said:</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe that's true. But I have a feeling that the
commercial system is breeding something more cruel than the
hangman's noose of the last century. It is, in any case, a thing
which concerns me. I wasn't judging only by the people I saw on New
Year's Eve. I was thinking of the people I met in business, and
what I've heard of politicians, newspapers, and all that sort of
thing; the way all these trades, and even the arts, are honeycombed
with corruption and false standards."</p>

<p>"Well, there's a lot in that, and I think it's a very big thing
you're after. This'll be mighty interesting to me. My people are
coming back again in the fall; I'll hope to bring them to some
theater to see one of your plays."</p>

<p>Arthur had a golden vision of Alice seated in the stalls,
looking at the stage, with her lips parted and her eyes sparkling
with appreciation of his attempt to "try and help the bad and
foolish."</p>

<p>Leslie raised his glass and said, "Happy days, Gaff!"</p>

<p>And Arthur raised his, and replied, "Happy days, Hales!"</p>

<p>After dinner they visited a pig fair in Montmartre, and
continued their discussion of the imponderable. One of Hales's last
remarks was:</p>

<p>"If I may say so. Gaff, what I'm afraid of about you is, you'll
go buzzing round the firmament too much. Take my advice and keep
your feet on the good old earth while you've got the chance. Write
about yourself and your own experiences."</p>

<p>It flashed upon Arthur that this was a curious corroboration of
Mr. Leffbury's advice, when he talked about going to Italy.
"Express <i>yourself</i>. Don't be mesmerized by reputation, or by
what is termed 'nature.'"</p>

<p>On the following day Hales came with him to the St. Lazare
station to see him off, and he was surprised to observe how moved
the big Califomian was at his departure. He repeated half a dozen
times:</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry you're going."</p>

<p>And then he seemed to dry up, as though words failed. When the
horn went, he wrung Arthur's hand till he almost cried out with
pain. The last he saw of him was his tall figure walking rapidly
beside the train, and his long arm waving his hat, while his kind
face was forcing a smile that was obviously a desperate effort to
restrain tears.</p>

<p>"This is a very wonderful thing," Arthur thought as he sank back
on the cushions when the train had rumbled out of sight of the
platform. And all the way to London he pondered on the strange
vicissitudes of affection, which shed her favors in a quite
unaccountable manner. Why should Hales, who was quite a stranger to
him and, indeed, a foreigner, be so unreasonably drawn to him, and
display an affection which he had no recollection of having enjoyed
before!</p>

<p>For some time he debated the question whether he shouldn't
change his mind and go back to Paris. He could write there as well
as in London. But still, perhaps it would be rather mean to
Edith.</p>

<p>"Write about yourself and your own experiences."</p>

<p><br>
He arrived at Edith's house in St. John's Wood on the following
morning at ten o'clock. The maid showed him through the studio. It
all looked very cozy and jolly. The stove was lighted, and there
was an easy chair and a Chesterfield, and a thick Turkey carpet on
the floor. In the best position for light was an old oak desk,
open. On the flap were several scribbling-pads, note-paper,
envelopes, stamps, three pens, a large bottle of ink, and
blotting-paper. He hung up his hat and coat with a consciously
proprietary air, and strolled to the desk. It was very quiet, an
ideal place for writing. He sat for a few moments enjoying the
pleasantly attractive atmosphere of the room. Then he took up one
of the pens and dipped it in the ink, and drawing a pad toward him,
wrote at the head of it:</p>

<p>"Moods: a Tragedy."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI&mdash;LADY MILLWORTHY'S MUFF</h2>

<p>The remarkable thing about the five-act tragedy, "Moods," was
that Arthur wrote it in six weeks. There was very little else about
it that was remarkable, except that it had twenty-seven speaking
parts, and the note of tragedy applied to the majority of them.</p>

<p>At about that time Edith, by some means or other, made the
acquaintance of that well-known actor, Gregory Brecknock. He used
to come occasionally to lunch on Sundays, or to tea in the
afternoon. He was an elderly, scholarly-looking man who had had
thirty years' experience in playing solid parts in London, without
ever having had a "lead." He was very friendly to Arthur, and in
due course was prevailed upon to read "Moods." His opinion was:</p>

<p>"My dear boy, you've some good stuff in this, but it's
hopelessly overweighted. There are far too many ideas and
characters, and far too little movement. You must come to the
theater more, and see how characters are brought on and off, and
how you can economize your material."</p>

<p>And so it came about that Arthur became a regular habitu of
London theaters for awhile. He went to see everything that was
playing. Occasionally Edith accompanied him, but for the most part
he went by himself. At the same time he read plays, and studied
plays, and talked plays. Gregory Brecknock took him behind the
scenes and introduced him to actors. He also took him to "The Old
Guys" club, which, as you know, is not far from Adelphi Terrace. It
is run mostly by city merchants and lawyers, but has a large
sprinkling of "the profession," and is also occasionally graced by
the presence of royalty and by some of the most pronounced
characters in London. Witty judges and famous pianists, jockeys,
prize-fighters and poets&mdash;they all look in there on the famous
"Old Guys" Saturday nights.</p>

<p>Among all the people he met, Arthur found actors, perhaps, the
most attractive class. Their childish vanity and impulsiveness, and
above all, their innate kindness of heart, appealed to him. They
lived so very much in a world of their own. Their love-affairs were
so promiscuous, so desperate, so impersonal, that he found it
difficult at times to be certain of domestic relationships.
Everybody on the stage was a "darling" or a "dear boy." And at the
moment when these expressions were used, they were, indeed,
sincerely meant. It was not an artificial atmosphere so much as an
ultra-natural one. They were like a lot of children, fascinated by
the love of love. The constant call on their emotions kept them in
a fluid state. They were most attractive people. When he was
introduced to them he liked the way the men at once called him
"dear boy," and the friendly, confiding way the women would hold
his hand.</p>

<p>He knocked about a lot among these people, and devoutly read his
Ibsen. He also studied Shaw and Pinero, and the other modern
people, and then at last he settled down again to write "Moods: A
Comedy."</p>

<p>At everybody's instigation he made it a comedy, and he reduced
the number of characters to eleven, and the acts to three. He
struggled hard, moreover, to stick to one simple idea.</p>

<p>The comedy took him much longer to write, nearly three months,
and Gregory Brecknock's opinion was that it was "a big improvement,
a very big improvement, but still, the way you get your characters
on and off the stage, dear boy, won't do at all. And it still wants
a lighter touch."</p>

<p>This opinion was generally endorsed by another actor friend
called Giles Hobday, who said, moreover, that he would like to show
it to a friend who had had a good deal of experience in
play-writing. In due course this friend appeared. He was a small,
keen-faced man named Klutz. He was more enthusiastic than Arthur
had expected. He said he thought something might be done with the
play, but he suggested drastic alterations, and he also said: "The
title won't do, dear boy. It sounds too gloomy. People want to be
jollied along."</p>

<p>Arthur felt very dubious about these alterations. He felt they
were going to upset his original idea considerably. At the same
time, the bare chance of getting a play accepted and produced,
dazzled him. The lure of this world was very strong.</p>

<p>He made another attempt, and rewrote most of it. Klutz thought
the result was much better, and promised to show it to a manager's
reader.</p>

<p>Nothing more was heard of the play for five weeks, and then it
was returned to Arthur with a printed notice of rejection. He
showed this to Klutz, and the latter said:</p>

<p>"Ah! I thought that might happen. Let me have it, dear boy. I've
another idea."</p>

<p>He took the play away, and there was another long interval. It
was now midsummer, and Arthur thought to himself:</p>

<p>"I'm afraid old Hales and 'his folks' won't see one of my plays
in the autumn."</p>

<p><br>
He was working on another play, when a very exciting thing
happened. One morning Klutz came bustling in. He was very agitated
and mysterious. He said:</p>

<p>"Look here, dear boy, I think I'm on the track of something.
Only&mdash;er&mdash;it's just this. We're all fair and square,
aren't we? What I mean to say is, <i>les affaires sont les
affaires</i>. I think I see a chance of placing your play, and if I
do, I take it you won't have any objection to sharing your
royalties with me?"</p>

<p>Arthur's heart beat with excitement. He immediately envisaged
the glories of a "first night." A crowded house, cheers, calls for
the author, a raving press. "Discovery of a new and brilliant
playwright!" "A White Hope of the English Stage."</p>

<p>He said as calmly as he could:</p>

<p>"Why, of course not."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Klutz. "Good! Well, now, it's like this. There's an
actress I know, called Flora Beedman. She's a very good actress,
and there's a gentleman I know, whose name I'm not at the moment at
liberty to divulge, who's anxious to give her a star 'lead.' Do you
see what I mean!"</p>

<p>"Yes, quite."</p>

<p>"Well, I've shown it to her, and she's quite keen. The only
thing is, there isn't really a star part for her. Anyway, not
enough. Now what she suggests is, you should work up the part of
Lady Millworthy and make it the central, dominating figure. It'll
be quite easy. And then, you remember the incident about the muff
in the second act? Well, she wants that made more of, too, and what
we <i>both</i> think is that the play should be called 'Lady
Millworthy's Muff.' That's a good idea, eh?"</p>

<p>Arthur said: "I see."</p>

<p>"Now, if you can weigh in to this, I wouldn't be surprised but
that we can get it put on in the autumn, perhaps at the Comedy, or
the Prince of Wales."</p>

<p>Arthur was trembling with varied emotions. He was both furious
and elated. He felt that it was an appalling desecration of the
lofty muse at whose shrine he worshipped. He would never be able to
convey through the medium of this new development the spirit of the
fine purposes which had prompted him to write. At the same time a
little voice said: "Here's your chance. Do what you can. You may be
able to. You'll be heard, in any case. When you're known, you'll be
able to write what you like."</p>

<p>He scratched with his pen on one of Edith's pads, and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I'll have a shot, if you like."</p>

<p>Arthur did his best to develop the character of Lady Millworthy,
and made a good deal of the muff episode. He understood from Klutz
that the play was accepted, subject to certain slight alterations
which Miss Flora Beedman had commissioned Klutz himself to make,
and that it would be produced in London in October, probably at the
Comedy.</p>

<p><br>
Hales arrived alone in London in September, and Arthur was able to
inform him that his first play was already accepted and would
shortly be produced. Hales was wildly delighted. He clapped Arthur
fore and aft, and his eyes glowed with pleasure.</p>

<p>"My!" he exclaimed, "that's splendid! Your first play! Well,
well, you're a marvel! I have to go over to Paris on Friday, but
you just let me know the date of production and I'll come right
over and be there in full war-paint I'm only sorry my people won't
be here after all. I had a letter from Alice last Saturday, and
there's been some little trouble. They won't be able to get away
yet awhile. Now tell me all about this play."</p>

<p>And then, indeed, Arthur felt a little embarrassed. He had to
acknowledge that it was not exactly as he intended it to be. He
was, in fact, already rather vague about some of it himself, and he
felt himself shrinking under the ingenuous cross-examination of his
friend. At the earliest opportunity he switched off to something
else.</p>

<p>When Hales had returned to Paris, the reality of the approaching
production was brought home to Arthur by the notification of a
rehearsal to which he was bidden. It seemed too good to be true. He
went, and was introduced to Miss Beedman, a large fiorid woman, not
at all the type of person he had conceived as Lady Millworthy. In
fact, as the characters appeared one by one, the horror came to him
that they were not a bit as he had fancied them. He doubted once or
twice whether it really was his play. He certainly recognized
sentences occasionally, but the whole thing seemed somehow alien to
him. The producer, a swarthy, elderly man, came forward and "dear
boyed" him, and said if he had anything to suggest, he would be
delighted to hear it. Arthur said no, he didn't think so, and
during some unrecognizable scene, slunk out of the theater.</p>

<p>A week before the production Klutz suddenly appeared one morning
in a great state of consternation. He came into Arthur's studio and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I say, dear boy, there's the very devil to pay. Guelderdieim's
turned rusty. I'm not taking sides one way or the other. I know
nothing about it. I've known Flora some time. She's a good sort. I
believe he's using this yarn that's got round just to burke his
obligations."</p>

<p>"What yarn?"</p>

<p>"Why, this yarn about Flora and young Champneys. I don't believe
there's anything in it, not a word of truth. But the old man is
furious. He swears he has evidence. And he's queering the whole
game."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? What game?"</p>

<p>"I mean, dear boy, that the play is <i>off</i>. Gueldersheim was
putting up the money, and he's backed out of it, all on account of
this ridiculous yam about Flora and young Champneys."</p>

<p>"You mean that they're not going to put on the play?"</p>

<p>"That's exactly the size of it. But now, look here, don't lose
hope. I've another idea. You leave it to me again for a bit."</p>

<p>"No, I'm damned if I do! I'm fed up with your crowd!"</p>

<p>"Now, look here, dear boy, it's not a bit of good cutting up.
I'm as sorry as you are; the only thing is to make the best of it.
I just ask you to give me one more chance."</p>

<p>Arthur was almost on the verge of tears, and he growled
something incoherent. He protested again that he wished to have
nothing further to do with Klutz and his crowd. Mr. Klutz was
imperturbable, and the interview ended negatively. He got back one
copy of the script, but there were other copies about, and also the
parts. Three weeks later he received a letter from Mr. Montague
Beale, a theatrical agent in Shaftesbury Avenue. It was to the
effect that Mr. Beale would be glad of a visit from Mr. Arthur
Gaffyn <i>re</i> the rights of his play, "Lady Millworthy's
Muff."</p>

<p>This seemed mysterious, but Arthur had heard of Montague Beale,
and he knew that he had a good name in the theatrical profession.
He was a Jew, and like many others of his race, had the reputation
of being as cunning as "a bagful of monkeys," but at the same time
being perfectly honest. It was said of him that he never made
contracts; his word stood.</p>

<p><br>
Arthur made the suggested visit, and he found a smooth-faced,
middle-aged gentleman sucking the stump of a cigar. He nodded and
said:</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Gaffyn; I'm pleased to meet you. I've read
your play and I think I can place it."</p>

<p>Arthur said "Really?" in rather inane fashion, and the agent
continued:</p>

<p>"I'll tell you who it's for. It's for Jimmy Cosway. D' you know
Jimmy?"</p>

<p>Arthur replied: "Not personally. I've seen him act, of
course."</p>

<p>Jimmy Cosway was at that time a popular actor of light comedy
and farce. He was a small man, with a whimsical personality that
made people laugh at the very mention of his name.</p>

<p>"My idea is this," said Mr. Beale. "We think there's some good
stuff in this play, but we shall want a great deal of alteration.
We want the character of the fop, Algernon Gadwood, made more of,
and the character of Lady Millworthy subdued. Cosway will play the
part of Algernon, and we want to introduce the suggestion of the
double meaning in 'Lady Millworthy's Muff.' Do you see? We want
Algernon to really be 'Lady Millworthy's Muff,' and then we shall
have all the muff episodes to emphasize the point. Jimmy has some
very good ideas of 'business' that might be introduced about the
muff in the second and third acts. What do you say?"</p>

<p>Arthur mumbled something about not thinking it would make a good
farce, and Mr. Beale exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, we won't have it a farce! We'll keep some of the love
element up to concert-pitch, but we'll have to cut some of those
allusions to hypochondria. There's an M.P. who drinks, isn't there?
We can't have that. People don't like it. Now Jimmy's producer, Lee
Whittle, is a very clever young man. He knows the ropes of the game
inside and out. What I suggest is, that he come and talk it over
with you."</p>

<p>Arthur thought there could be no harm in talking it over, and he
said so. Mr. Beale said:</p>

<p>"Good! I'll ring up and make an appointment."</p>

<p>Arthur's interview with Lee Whittle was impressive, and to him
unforgettable. Lee Whittle was a young man about thirty years of
age, with raven-black hair brushed straight back, and very dark
eyes. He had an impressive way of talking and speaking. He came to
Arthur's studio and stopped three hours and a half, and he held the
floor all the time. He walked up and down, and declaimed in a
magnificent voice. Every little sentence was rounded and finished
to perfection. He talked Arthur off his feet. He pointed out a
hundred and one technical difficulties arising through Arthur's
ignorance of stage-craft. And in drawing his attention to the
inevitable alteration to these defects, he gradually induced him to
introduce the snappy way of piecing it together that, in the
opinion of himself, and Jimmy Cosway, and Mr. Beale, the piece
demanded. Arthur made desperate attempts to compromise, but so
involved did some of it become, that he left much of it in the
hands of Whittle to do what he liked with. The interviews,
discussions, and alterations went on for three weeks, and then he
was given a contract signed by Mr. Beale on behalf of James Cosway
and a syndicate.</p>

<p><br>
It was in this way that "Moods: a Tragedy" developed into "Lady
Millworthy's Muff: a farcical Comedy." It was produced at the old
Cock-Pit Theater in Pall Mall and, as you know, ran for almost two
years. When the author watched it on that historic "first night"
from the dim recesses of a box, he involuntarily thought of the
expression on poor Yardley's face on that morning in the garden at
Bradehurst when he looked at his children with the expression of an
alchemist who has produced something he cannot account for. The
success of the play was never in doubt. Lady Millworthy's muff got
the whimsical Algernon into most compromising positions from which
he always managed to extricate himself. When, during the third act,
an M.P., who in the original play was a hypochondriac, but now was
only a libertine of a flippant description, called and discovered
Algernon in his wife's boudoir; and when Algernon put on an
overcoat, placed the muff on his head, and pretended to be a
hussar, saluting the M.P. as he walked out, the house rocked with
laughter. But the author thought: "What has all this got to do with
a certain night I hung about St. Paul's Cathedral? Thank God I
didn't tell Hales about this!"</p>

<p>It is necessary at this point to go back a little and trace the
corollary of another progression which concerns the emotions.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII&mdash;THE MOUNTAIN PEAK</h2>

<p>During the evolution of this phase of his professional career,
the mind of Arthur might be traced in the analogy of a mariner
exploring strange and fascinating waters, endeavoring to
concentrate his attention on the compass with a view to avoiding
shoals and shallows, and at the same time with vision strangely
alert and at times distracted by the new and appealing revelations
of fresh vistas of romantic scenes. He experienced, in the first
place, a degree of domestic comfort he had never enjoyed before.
The oak desk in the studio was the be-all and end-all of his
necessary activities. Nothing else intruded. The little room in the
annex was fitted up as a bedroom, and in some secret and mysterious
way everything which concerned his personal comfort was
accomplished silently for him. His clothes were brushed and laid
out for him. Clean linen was always to be found in the drawers of
the chest. The studio was always kept clean, and dusted, and warm.
His breakfast was sent to him on a tray, and very often his lunch,
but for dinner he invariably went into the house and shared it with
Edith. The reason for having his lunch alone was that if he went
into the house for this meal, the three objectionable children were
there. In the evening they were in bed.</p>

<p>The change in the character of Edith impressed him in many ways.
She was just as managing, but in a gentler, more mothering way. It
took the form of asking him if he had a clean handkerchief when he
was starting out for the theater, or in seeing that he changed his
boots if he had been out in the wet.</p>

<p>She never interfered with his work, but he gradually felt drawn
to tell her about it, and ultimately he found it necessary to read
everything to her before he sent it to be typed. He began to rely
on her in every little way. Sometimes he would become conscious of
this reliance, and it would anger him. He would ride the high horse
of domineering independence, and do some unnecessarily brusk and
thoughtless thing. And then he would feel ashamed of this, and in a
rather self-conscious manner make some little atonement.</p>

<p>For long periods she would be to him but a vague, impersonal,
protective force. And then suddenly there were intervals when there
was something acutely personal about her. He was always a little
proud of her when they went about together. She looked a person of
importance and distinction when she walked to her seat in the
stalls of a theater. She dressed with dignity, and no other woman
carried herself so well. He had heard men whisper, "That's a damned
fine woman."</p>

<p>The whisper had made him look at her furtively. She was "a
damned fine woman" in their sense, and as Arthur knew, "a damned
fine woman" in another sense. She had, at moments, that aspect of
insolent conscious superiority which is peculiar to certain English
women of good birth. It cannot be called vanity, because it is so
unerringly sure. A peacock is vain, because it puffs out its
feathers and pretends that it is not only beautiful, but superior.
But apart from its beauty, a peacock has nothing at all to back up
all this pretence. A peacock is one of the biggest fools among
fowls. A woman of the type of Edith is not pretending anything; she
knows. Her face is simply the index of an innate consciousness of
centuries of moral restraint, duty, the exercise of power in a
reasonable way, courage in the face of trials and adversities,
loyalty to herself and her tradition, self-reliance, a strong and
inflexible will, and an intense hatred of what is mean and
contemptible.</p>

<p><br>
Arthur found himself wondering about her tentatively. As time went
on, the periods when he thought of her impersonally narrowed, and
the moments when he thought of her acutely became accentuated. She
was, in a way, such a strong foil to himself that she seemed even
mysterious.</p>

<p>With his loose grip on all the concrete things of life, and his
temperamental moodiness, which carried him along into channels
where everything became an affair of experience, either beautiful
or ugly, attractive or repulsive, Edith appeared at times an
incredible enigma, like an unscalable snow-capped mountain rising
from a marsh.</p>

<p>And then little incidents began to happen which made him wonder
whether, after all, the mountain was so unscalable, and the very
perilousness and hazard of the dubious ascent began to have a
strangely attractive fascination for him, even in the realms of
imagination.</p>

<p>Why was Edith so peculiarly good to him? Not only good, because
she was good to everyone in her sternly puritanic way, but good to
him in an almost surrendering way? She revealed aspects of her
character, gentle and yielding, which he had not observed her
reveal to anyone else, not even to Yardley or the children. When he
did anything gracious or successful, there would come to her face
an expression of pride in him in a possessive sense. When he did
anything wrong, she would look unhappy for the moment, and then
would come that brooding, mothering look, as though she must
protect him from himself. He believed her to be a clever woman, and
one thing about her disturbed him. She made so little comment about
his work. He would have to interrogate her for opinions, and she
always seemed reserved and diffident about giving them. But for the
most part he was always suspecting that beneath those keen fine
eyes there lurked the dim reflection of a smile, as though she were
humoring him; as though she regarded all these wild hopes and great
ideals of his as the harmless playthings of a child she loved.</p>

<p>It would be idle to pretend that the passage of that year marked
in him any development toward a less egoistical attitude. On the
contrary, he became more self-centered and arbitrary. He was, in
effect, "spoiled." And it seemed odd that the spoiling should have
been done by the former mistress of Bradehurst! But she was not
entirely alone in this. As time went on, Edith seemed disposed to
become a more social being. Dinner-parties took place, and little
receptions, and snug teas, and always the theatrical and literary
element predominated. The tragic affair of Robert Yardley became
mellowed, and, indeed, only added a piquancy to the atmosphere of
these bohemian gatherings. Nearly all the ladies who came to visit
Mrs. Yardley told her that Arthur was "a charming boy." He
certainly developed more assurance, and the ability to know how to
act in various social positions. He had, as Mr. Leffbury once
remarked, "a face the world will love to torture." He was
good-looking in a Latin way, with dark brown hair, rather dreamy
eyes, and a pale skin. His figure was slight and elastic, and he
had an engaging way of smiling at people who attracted him. Pretty
actresses found delight in flirting with him, and in drawing out
this impressionable boy. He had a genius for saying the unexpected
thing, and very frequently his naivete and impulsiveness would set
a room full of sophisticated people in a mood of merriment. He was
seldom gay in the boisterous sense, but he had a faculty of
disengaging odd and entertaining aspects from the general panorama;
and always about him was that restless air of the sentiment being
who is searching and is not satisfied.</p>

<p>When he came up against the kind of conditions he would have to
cope with for the successful exploitation of his work, he became
even more dissatisfied, and yet remained more sensitive to the
claim of the inner feelings which had induced him to abandon
painting. He saw the tragedy of "Moods" slip out of his hands and
become the thing of furs and furbelows that it was, and he
thought:</p>

<p>"Oh, well, let them do what they like. I shall start again!"</p>

<p>And so, indeed, he did. He built on his experience, pointing the
structure of simpler ideas with ironic thoughts. Long before the
production of "Lady Millworthy's Muff" he had completed another
comedy called "One of Us," and he made up his mind that they should
either "take it or leave it." There should be no tinkering with
"One of Us."</p>

<p>He got Gregory Brecknock to read it one day, and the actor
said:</p>

<p>"This is very ambitious, Arthur, dear boy, very ambitious. You
might get the Stage Society, or one of these extreme stage reform
people to put it on for a special matinee, but I'm
afraid&mdash;yes, I'm very much afraid that no London manager would
look at it."</p>

<p><br>
On that very afternoon a curious little experience happened to him.
He went over to the house. Gregory Brecknock was in the
drawing-room, talking to Edith. They were laughing as he walked
into the room, but they left off suddenly, and an uncomfortable
feeling came over him that they had been talking and laughing about
him.</p>

<p>Edith stood up and said:</p>

<p>"Will you have some tea, Arthur!"</p>

<p>He observed the proud tilt of her chin as she walked across the
room to a tray-stand, and it suddenly rushed upon him that he was
jealous. He was jealous of Gregory Brecknock! Why was this actor
always loafing around here? Hot on this suspicious terror came the
thought:</p>

<p>"Well, after all, what has it to do with me? What am I jealous
about?"</p>

<p>He had his tea in a rather gloomy silence, and went back to the
studio, but all the evening he kept on revolving the fact that he
was jealous, and wondering what he was jealous about. He looked at
Edith at dinner time quite furtively, and the man's remark kept
recurring to his mind:</p>

<p>"She's a damned fine woman."</p>

<p>He thrust this thought back. It was too ridiculous.</p>

<p>He started to write a third play, and some little studies of
London types. He worked consistently for weeks, but at odd moments
of the day he would suddenly look up from his writing tablet and
ponder. Round and round his mind would eddy strange little currents
of elation, suspicion, wonder. He would brush these aside, but they
would recur again.</p>

<p>He developed a habit of going over to the house at unexpected
times to ask Edith's opinion about something, or to tell her of his
plans. It was early in April when "Lady Millworthy's Muff" was
produced, and on that eventful night, also, the slow dance of these
dubious emotions reached their apotheosis.</p>

<p>He and Edith occupied a box, and other people in the theater who
knew them visited them between the acts. These included Gregory
Brecknock, who, moreover, stopped in the box for the whole of two
acts at Edith's invitation. There had been a dinner-party before
the theater, and everybody was in very high spirits, except the
author. Arthur was in a strangely divided mood in which egoism and
outrage struggled for supremacy.</p>

<p>After the first act, two young women called the "Porson girls,"
who were friends of Brecknock, came into the box, and they all
laughed and joked. Brecknock looked at Arthur's face, and
laughed:</p>

<p>"Arthur looks like a boy caught stealing apples in an orchard,"
he said. "He can't make up his mind whether to bolt, or pick one
more."</p>

<p>"It's going to be a <i>huge</i> success," said one of the Porson
girls. They were all merry and Edith was, unusually for her.</p>

<p>"He's horrified lest he should make some money out of it," she
said.</p>

<p><br>
When the lights were lowered previous to the second act, and the
orchestra was playing a Hungarian dance of Dvorak's, this idea did,
indeed, flash through his mind for an instant. Money! Suppose he
did make money! What would he do with it? The trend of his
affections switched his mind instantaneously to the bungalow at
Bodiesham. He would cultivate the garden, make the place look
decent.<br>
The curtain went up. The actors were at it again, strutting about,
making their points, getting effective exits. He hung back in the
box and glanced at Edith. He noted her lips slightly parted, and
her eyes shining as she watched the movements of the players. He
thought he observed Brecknock also glancing at her, rather than at
the stage.</p>

<p>"She's a damned fine woman!"</p>

<p>Something stirred within him. He wanted the play to end. He
hated all these people going in and out of canvas doors, and the
silly laughter from the auditorium.</p>

<p>Before the last act Brecknock returned to his seat in the dress
circle, and they were alone. For some reason or other his mind kept
returning to the bungalow at Bodiesham. How cold and bleak it would
look there now under the moonlight, with the creepers and grass,
like cobwebs, clustering round the white building!</p>

<p>"This isn't the sort of thing I meant to do," he thought at
random. "I don't think I'd like to spend money made out of this
play, on the bungalow."</p>

<p>Suddenly, about half-way through the act, he gripped Edith's
arm.</p>

<p>"Come!" he said. "Let's go. I want to go."</p>

<p>He saw the surprised look in her eyes as they shone in the
darkness.</p>

<p>"Go!" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Yes, come on! I want to go at once," he answered bruskly.</p>

<p>She obeyed in silence, and he helped her on with her
opera-cloak. They went down the passage and out to the foyer, and
hailed a cab. They rode home in dead silence, each waiting for the
other to speak. When they arrived home the household had
retired.</p>

<p>In the dining-room a bright fire was burning, and some light
refreshments were placed on the sideboard. Edith was watching him,
tremulously observant, and looking a little scared. He strode to
the fireplace and lighted a cigarette. He puffed at it for a few
seconds, and then threw it away. Suddenly he said:</p>

<p>"Take off your cloak!"</p>

<p>She looked startled, but again she obeyed. She was wearing a
black dress of some shiny material that emphasized the glowing
splendor of her white skin and the shape of her fine shoulders. At
her breast she wore a bunch of lilies-of-the-valley.</p>

<p>Arthur looked at her, and searched her fiercely challenging
eyes. They both breathed rapidly, without anything being said. Then
he suddenly seized her arm and said hoarsely:</p>

<p>"What does that fellow Brecknock come hanging about for?"</p>

<p>He saw beneath her questioning intentness the flicker of
startled surprise, and he knew by that glance that there was
nothing in the affair of "that fellow Brecknock." He knew,
moreover, that she would be too proud to deny it. He also knew at
that instant that he had never really believed it himself. The
thing was merely a tool for the medium of his expression of
dominance.</p>

<p>"I will have you and break you!"</p>

<p>When before had this phrase occurred to him? She suddenly shook
his hand free and started to move in the direction of her cloak,
with an insolent toss of her head. In a flash he had thrown his
arms round her shoulders from behind and pulled her back. She
struggled, but he kissed her neck and cheek, and then twisted her
round and faced her.</p>

<p>Her eyes were shining, but the hollows looked dark and sunken,
as though she were suffering. She gasped:</p>

<p>"Arthur! Arthur! What are you doing!"</p>

<p>For answer he gripped both her arms and hurt her. He saw her
wince with pain, but he still continued doing it. Then, as she shut
her eyes, he crushed her to him and kissed her on the lips. He felt
her body trembling against his and trying to force him back, as she
cried:</p>

<p>"Arthur, I'm eleven yeas older than you. Do you hear? I'm eleven
years older!"</p>

<p>She kept repeating this parrot-cry desperately, as though it
were the first line of her defense, while her lips remained passive
to his kisses. Then he said huskily:</p>

<p>"I don't care; I want you. I must have you. I love you."</p>

<p>With ice-ax and alpenstock the explorer was already among the
snow-capped peaks. The dizzy heights were scalable, if only one had
courage and zeal, and the intense joy of adventure which is the
prerogative of youth.</p>

<p>"I am eleven years older than you, Arthur. Oh, my dear!"</p>

<p>Suddenly her right arm was free, and she passed it over his hair
and framed his face with the lily curve of it. She looked wildly
into his eyes and cried:</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear! Oh! Oh!"</p>

<p>The cry was very near akin to pain as she pressed her lips to
his of her own free will. And then Edith, too, looked like a boy
who has been caught stealing apples.</p>

<p>"Oh, what are we doing? Arthur, this is madness. Madness, I tell
you!"</p>

<p>She was no longer Edith to him. She was some strange siren he
had chased from crag to crag up the slopes of the mountain. They
were alone now up there together, and beneath them was all the
glory of the world.</p>

<p>"Madness! What is madness?" he cried. "Is the world so very
sane? What is it but a place where people go in and out of doors
and make each other laugh and cry? If this is madness, then the
stars are mad, and the spring flowers trembling in the grass
to-night beneath the moon. I never felt so strong, so virile, and
so sure as now when I crush you in my arms. Kiss me again!"</p>

<p>She shut her eyes, as though she dare not let him see the
passion that rioted within.</p>

<p>"Oh, Arthur, my beautiful, my beautiful!"</p>

<p>And up among the mountain peaks they could hear the god Pan in
the valley below, blowing upon his reed the clear sweet notes of an
old song he had played from immemorial times.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;IN SEARCH OF SENTIENT JOYS</h2>

<p>Edith became very watchful, and her face still bore the
expression of the boy who has been caught stealing apples. Before
they started out on that tour of sentient joys, she looked herself
squarely in the face and said:</p>

<p>"Harden yourself to the knowledge that it won't last."</p>

<p>And as a corollary she determined that while it lasted she would
get the utmost out of it. They went to Paris, and then on to
Switzerland. From Switzerland they journeyed to the Italian lakes,
and then to Milan, Verona, and Venice. They stayed at Venice three
weeks, and then proceeded to Florence and Sienna. From Sienna they
worked their way up the Mediterranean coast to Genoa, and so
through Bordighera, Mentone, Nice, and back to Paris.</p>

<p>During this time she studied the temperamental composition of
her lover with an almost morbid thoroughness. When he was gay, her
heart responded like that of a young girl. When he had moods of
depression, she humored him and found the way to restore him to
cheerfulness. She knew when to leave him alone, when to rail him,
and when to tease him. She would sit for hours in some dim church
which did not interest her after the first five minutes, while he
mooned all over it and made notes. She would let him go for long
walks by himself, while she sat in the hotel and busied herself
with her fingers. In the meantime, she took on her shoulders all
the unpleasant side of traveling. She bought the railway tickets,
looked after the luggage, interviewed hotel managers, selected the
rooms, coped with couriers and touts. When the little things went
wrong, it was she who kept her head and soothed his peevishness.
And she said to herself:</p>

<p>"This is the crowded hour of my life. When the illusion has
vanished, a day will come filled with little emptinesses, and he
will fall in love."</p>

<p><br>
It was at Bellagio, in the garden of the hotel overlooking the
lake, on a seat under a cactus-tree, that she talked to him about
her first marriage.</p>

<p>"I was eighteen, and my mother wished it. That is really all. I
loved my mother, and I was brought up with an almost Chinese
reverence for parentage and duty. I did as I was told. And, in his
way, I believe Robert loved me. He was always fond of me to the
very end. Do not be deceived. I knew quite well the sort of life he
lived. I knew he was what they call 'a man of the world,' which
usually means a man who keeps his excesses out of the public gaze.
He was a clever man. His people came from Bristol, where they
thought a lot of him. It was my idea to go to London. I was
ambitious, and so was he. He worked very hard, and I helped him. At
least, I did a lot to help his career. We were married for five
years before I discovered the thing that was destined to destroy
him."</p>

<p>"What was that?" Arthur asked.</p>

<p>"Drink."</p>

<p>"Drink? Do you mean to say Yardley drank, as well as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It began, I believe, in a very usual way. He worked too hard,
got tired, and took a 'pick-me-up.' Gradually this developed into
the old business of nip, nip, nip. I struggled with him for years,
and tried to make him give it up. Again and again he promised, and
again and again he broke his promise. Perhaps, if I'd really loved
him, I would have been more desperate. But I felt my first duty was
to the children. I took them down to Bradehurst. We practically
drifted apart, except that for appearance sake he came down
sometimes."</p>

<p>"But this is ghastly," Arthur remarked. "I used to like old
Yardley."</p>

<p>"I know. So did almost everyone. He was very kind, sympathetic,
gentle. The remarkable thing is, it did not affect his brain. If he
had lived longer, perhaps it would. But men have told me that he
had one of the cleverest and most lucid brains in London. And, for
my part, I never knew him to lose his head. He was never once cruel
to me, never unkind. As far as I can remember, he never spoke an
unkind word to me, or acted against my inclinations. And before I
went to Bradehurst, I knew of occasions when he would drink a whole
bottle of brandy during the afternoon and evening. Isn't it
incredible! I believe there are other men like that. The tragedy
is, I could not pity him. I tried hard. I felt withered, frigid,
unresponsive. I tried to shut it all out of my mind and to
concentrate on the bringing up of the children."</p>

<p>"If you had loved him, you might have saved him," Arthur said
suddenly.</p>

<p>"I know. But one can't make oneself love, dear. And when I found
out what was happening, every vestige of love in me dried up. I
shut him out of my life. As you know, he came down sometimes in the
evening, or for week-ends. He had his own room. And I would not
allow alcohol in the house."</p>

<p>The boy thought for a moment, and then he gripped her hand and
muttered:</p>

<p>"Hell!"</p>

<p>He did not seem entirely satisfied with Edith's attitude in the
matter. He peered down into the waters of the lake reflecting the
pale moon. Somewhere in the distance a bell was tinkling.</p>

<p>"It must have been awful for him," he said at last.</p>

<p>She put up her hand and touched his cheek.</p>

<p>"Arthur, you're not angry with me for this? You don't think I
ought to have&mdash;"</p>

<p>He could see a tear gathering on the brink of her eye, and he
kissed it away.</p>

<p>"It's awfully hard for everyone," he murmured. "Everything's
very difficult. The older I grow, the more difficult everything
seems. And love&mdash;I mean love like ours&mdash;is, perhaps, the
greatest tyrant of all."</p>

<p>She pressed her cheek against his, and said:</p>

<p>"O Arthur, there's surely nothing greater, nothing finer than
this love of ours."</p>

<p>He did not answer. She looked at his eyes, and forced him to
speak by the appeal of her glance. And he answered:</p>

<p>"No, no; I know. But I was thinking of that other love at the
moment; the love of the big thing, the sense of love for the
unhappy, the downtrodden."</p>

<p>She gripped his hand and said:</p>

<p>"Do you know when I first loved you? It was on the day of your
father's death. I loved you because you were unhappy. I loved you
for your baby helplessness, and because I knew you couldn't manage
without me. And then I loved you because you hurt me when you were
cruel to me. You became a part of me, and I wanted you all the
time. O my beautiful!"</p>

<p><br>
It was under the shadow of Santa della Salute in Venice, on a
violet night, with the ripples lapping the sides of the gondola,
that they spoke of the future. In the distance some full-throated
tenor was singing at the serenata, "abominably when you're near,
but divinely, across a hundred yards of water," as Arthur put it.
Edith spoke of his career.</p>

<p>"I want you to express yourself, Arthur, as your friend Mr.
Leffbury said. I know exactly what you feel about the play. I'm not
going to let you get depressed because you find things not exactly
as you dreamed them. There'll be no need to worry about money. You
shall do exactly as you like, write what you like, say what you
like. No one shall interfere, and if they won't accept your plays
as you have written them at first, they'll have to in the long run.
And gradually you'll find out exactly what you can do, and the best
way to do it. I suppose you'll think it wicked of me,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What could I think wicked of you?"</p>

<p>"Only that I am ambitious for you. I want you to be a great man,
some one talked about and looked up to, a great influence, a force
in public life. I know you have it in you."</p>

<p>He had already tasted a little of the sweets of success. He had
moved among successful people. And this woman with her quiet power
had led him by the hand, and, in her way, had shown him "all the
glories of the world."</p>

<p>Intoxicating sounds stole across the water. The mantle of stars
gleamed overhead with a special significance for them, as it had
gleamed with a special significance in a kindred clime to Troilus
and Cressida, and as it was gleaming with a special significance to
a pornographic, German, honeymoon couple in a gondola a dozen yards
away.</p>

<p>He kissed her chin and murmured:</p>

<p>"I'd like to be something, for <i>your</i> sake. Do you hear?
For your sake. Just for you, and because you've made the beauty of
this night for me; because you've taught me to love. For my own
part, I don't know. As I wander about Italy, I think a lot about
old Leffbury and the things he said. What did he mean by, 'Don't be
mesmerized by nature'? I went into St. Mark's this afternoon. I
didn't like it at first, but it grows on you. It's so damned savage
and domineering, such an aristocrat. It lies there on the piazza
like some great savage beast, suggesting centuries of murder,
piracy, and tyranny, with a splendid bombastic insolence. Then you
push aside the great curtain, and go in out of the sun. Directly
you get inside, an unaccountable wave of tenderness comes over you.
All the cruelty and tyranny seems mellowed, as though something has
happened to purify these things. This afternoon there were some
women there in their black shawls, and with their market-baskets.
They were kneeling in front of the altar of St. Aloysius, counting
their beads. I felt curiously envious. I knelt down and wished I
knew how to pray. I wished I weren't so sophisticated, so
'superior.' I wanted to be absorbed in the Great Thing, whatever it
was. And then, when one has that feeling, all these things like
careers and success seem so trivial It's only love that matters,
love in the big way." They were silent; then she said
breathlessly:</p>

<p>"Arthur, you love me in the big way?"</p>

<p>For answer he kissed her lips.</p>

<p><br>
It was in Sienna that he began to get restless and wanted to return
home.</p>

<p>"I am beginning to get the conscious-tourist feeling," he said.
"This is no place for pottering about, doing little bits of
sketches. One wants to absorb it. It has the face of perpetuity. I
am always feeling self-conscious when these native people stare at
me. Lazy devils they are for the most part, but they are all doing
<i>something</i>. They're part of the scheme. They blend into it.
All we tourists who go gaping about open-mouthed&mdash;we're just
an excrescence on the thing. Leffbury said, 'When you go to Italy,
express <i>yourself</i>.' There's a lot in that, for what else is
there in Italy to express? When I had been round the cathedral and
this extraordinary market-square, and seen those amazing early
Siennese masters' paintings, I realized that I had nothing to say
about it at all. It is all fixed and finished. I could never say
anything in paint more valuable than what Cimabue has said, so why
waste one's time? These old boys were successful because in their
day they were moderns. They did something with the age they lived
in. I am a modern. I want to get back to London, with all its sins,
and vices, and ugliness, and beauty, and mystery, and do something
with <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>And then he added,</p>

<p>"I don't know how it is. Italy is very fine, but it's not quite
so fine as I expected."</p>

<p><br>
In Rapallo there came to Edith one of the dreaded days, one of the
days of "little emptinesses." And she could not account for it.
Something seemed to have suddenly shifted. There was no quarrel, no
outward difference; only the sudden little consciousness of empty
moments. The sun shone gloriously on their first vision of the
Mediterranean, and the little white villas were spotted about
enticingly among the pine hills. Fishing-boats drifted lazily in
and out of the bay. It was an ideal place for repose, an ideal
place for lovers. But something was grimly incomplete. There was a
restlessness. Like a good general, Edith acted promptly.</p>

<p>"Let us go on to Genoa," she said.</p>

<p>They arrived in Genoa, and the weather was very hot. There was a
lot of trouble with the town customs and some railway officials who
wanted to take the luggage away to examine it at their leisure.
Edith, with her rather scanty Italian and her best
Shropshire-Gaffyn manner, managed to force her way through. But
Genoa was not a success. They stayed at a bad hotel that was rather
dirty, and there were no mosquito-nets in the bedroom. They slept
badly, and the boy was inclined to be quarrelsome.</p>

<p>They cut the sights of Genoa and went straight on.</p>

<p>They arrived at Mentone with a feeling of relief. France was
like home. But when they got to their hotel, they found that a bag
of Arthur's which contained his sketching things was missing. It
had probably never got beyond the notorious officials at Genoa.
Arthur was in a state of furious despair, and he cursed the whole
Italian nation luxuriously. The next day Edith said she would see
what she could do. She sent Arthur for a walk, and then returned to
Genoa by herself, from which town she sent him a telegram that she
could not get back that night. She was away two days, and then
returned with the bag, to find her lover in a state of maudlin
apprehension. He kissed her and said he had been a cad, and they
had a long and passionate reconciliation. Edith did not give him
time to let this cool; they went on to Nice, where he seemed to
want to stop for a bit, but like a skilful driver of a horse that
has bolted, she drove him on. They were in Paris the next morning,
and in London the following day.</p>

<p>Arthur found his studio ready for him, and several letters and
statements from Mr. Montague Beale. "Lady Millworthy's Muff" was
continuing a great success. Two companies were on the road, and a
manager in New York was negotiating for the American rights.</p>

<p>While he had been finding "nothing to express" in Italy, the
rolling-stone of "Lady Millworthy's Muff" had been gathering moss
for him in England.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX&mdash;THE FUGITIVE PHILOSOPHER</h2>

<p>The impulse which came to Arthur to write "The Fugitive
Philosopher" was, to a certain extent, a reactionary impulse from
that of writing "Lady Millworthy's Muflf." The book was, in effect,
a series of essays, which it took him the best part of a year to
compile. He came back from Italy full of ideas, despite the fact
that he found something lacking in Italy, and the medium of
commentary appealed to him at the time as the best one for their
expression. It was, moreover, extraordinarily satisfying to receive
definite financial offers for another play, and to refuse them. It
appealed to his vanity, and it also appealed to another quality in
him which was, indeed, the underlying motif of "The Fugitive
Philosopher." For the underlying motif of "The Fugitive
Philosopher" was to reveal various phases of human life, and to
detach from them what was spiritual, and what was material. They
were less essays than sketches of various substantive types which
moved, or spoke, or came in conflict, and thereby lent point to the
discriminating researches of "The Fugitive Philosopher." He was,
indeed, a very pleasant, easy-going gentleman, a little vague and
somewhat unpractical; and he rode, tilting at these social
windmills with a chivalrous inconsequence. He was very, very
fugitive, but somehow lovable. He dashed from one point to another,
finding beauty in unexpected places, happiness in squalor, love "in
the big way" in the breast of a harlot, insincerity in the gaiters
of a bishop, solemn nonsense in the pomp of royalty, hollowness in
the chink of gold, glimpses of divinity in the heart of the
sensualist, joy in suffering, sentimentality in a scheming
politician&mdash;and through all things an unerring belief in
ultimate good.</p>

<p>These commentaries were undoubtedly the best and most sincere
work Arthur ever accomplished. He put the best of himself into
them, and some of them appeared separately in the better-class
reviews.</p>

<p>In the meantime, life in the house in St. John's Wood moved to
the throb of a steady pulse. Arthur, in his way, was happy, and
Edith was drawing all the enchantment possible from her "crowded
hour." They entertained, and the people who visited them gradually
evolved from the theatrical type to a more polyglot species. Soon
after their return. Aunt Elizabeth, who had never recovered from
the staggering surprise of their marriage, and who only tolerated
it on the conviction that "they say that marriages are made in
Heaven; Edith ought to know!" visited them.</p>

<p>But by that time the sensation of the thing had been somewhat
dwarfed by an even more startling development in her own house, for
Eleanor had become engaged to a schoolmaster, a young sandy-haired
north-countryman named Burnett.</p>

<p>"They say he's very clever, and will probably soon get an
appointment as inspector. Of course they won't get married just
yet, dear. But Eleanor's very happy. At least, she ought to be, I'm
sure. She's thinner than she used to be. I don't know how it is.
They say she drinks too much hot water. It's lowering to the
system. He's given her a very pretty emerald ring with two
sapphires. It must have cost a good deal."</p>

<p>She turned her attention to Arthur:</p>

<p>"Well, are you going to write another play, Arthur! I must say I
was surprised to hear what a success it had been. I can't think how
you can have thought of it all. They say you'll make a lot of money
out of it. It seems funny you're making money! I always put you
down as one of the Uncle Brian kind. Well, well, dear, I'm very
glad for your sake. I expect Edith helped you, didn't she? I nearly
died when he put the muff on his head; very funny I call it. They
say some of the playwrights make a lot of money. How proud your
dear father would have been!"</p>

<p>Hence the fugitive philosopher!</p>

<p><br>
On the proposal of Gregory Brecknock he was elected a member of
"The Old Guys" club, and despite the serious call he felt toward
the new line of his work, he could not always remain impervious to
the appeal of the glamorous life. It was very pleasant occasionally
to stroll into "The Old Guys," and to talk and be called "dear boy"
by well-known actors, and to drink whisky and exchange views with
clever people. And sometimes he would hear people nudge each other
and say, "Who is that!" and the answer would be, "That's young
Arthur Gaffyn, who wrote 'Lady Millworthy.'" Alas! he wished it
could have been a more worthy fame. But he promised himself that a
day should come when the sufficient answer would be:</p>

<p>"Why, don't you know? That's Gaffyn!"</p>

<p>It was pleasant in "The Old Guys," and it was even pleasanter in
certain drawing-rooms when pretty women would come up, take his
hand and say:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Gaffyn, I simply <i>loved</i> your play."</p>

<p>And everybody said:</p>

<p>"Of course you're writing another play. When will it be
ready?"</p>

<p>He steadied himself against these allurements, and looked to
Edith for support.</p>

<p>"One of Us" was submitted to several managers' readers, but they
all rejected it, although one suggested that if certain alterations
were made, it might be reconsidered. Arthur refused to do this, and
went on with his commentaries. He left "One of Us" in Edith's hands
to do what she liked with. She did, indeed, eventually succeed in
getting it produced at a special matine by the Prompt Side Club,
but it was badly staged and mercilessly slated by the press, who
condemned it as dull and "not likely to advance the reputation of
the author of 'Lady Millworthy's Muff.'"</p>

<p><br>
Regularly every month he received long letters from Hales, who had
returned to California. They were remarkable letters, sometimes
covering twenty or thirty pages. They touched on every conceivable
subject, and as they were not very legibly written, it is to be
regretted that Arthur often skipped a good deal of them. Especially
was this true when he talked on philosophy and American politics.
Arthur dived among the pages for any news of Hales himself, or of
Alice, or her mother, or of their prospective movements. Soon after
his marriage he received a characteristic letter from his friend,
full of warm-hearted congratulations and a sentimental effusion on
the state of matrimony. He had added, incidentally that the affair
had broken Alice's heart, and that she was trying to kill herself
by eating excessively of watermelons. They all, however, sent their
love, and a small present was on the way.</p>

<p>The reference to Alice stirred up old half-forgotten longings.
He could not exactly define to himself what they were. Only that
when the far-flung line of his emotions sought the satisfying hour,
he could not find that any moment was so complete, so fine a thing
as that moment when he had stood by the child's side in the
Luxembourg Gardens and gazed up at the kite. What was it! He could
not love the child in the way he loved Edith; she was too young,
not to be considered in that way at all. Perhaps there was
something about her he envied, that she alone possessed, the stuff
of absolute purity and youth. He was still young, but not in the
way that she was young. He had been soiled, made cynical,
coarsened. He had lost that outlook of the child-mind. If he could
only have a child like Alice; but he knew that such a thing was
more than unlikely. And he had moments of restless envy. Envy of
Alice! She would one day meet a boy like herself, pure, and with
the eyes of a child. Ah! what was all this talk of art, and
success, and fame? What compensation could it be for the glory of
one such moment missed? He was jealous of the youth who would one
day love Alice. He knew it was a wild and unreasonable emotion, but
it created images and visions which at odd moments crept into his
dreams and made "the little emptinesses" that, by a telepathic
process, were conveyed to his wife.</p>

<p>More particularly was this the case when the days were fine, and
when that first tender warmth heralded spring. He was happiest when
the weather was murky and dull. He could have the log-fire burning
in his studio, and he could pore over his work. And in the evening
there was light, and warmth, and entertainment, and artificial
things that satisfied his moods.</p>

<p><br>
In the following August he, and Edith, and the children, went down
to Devonshire, where they stayed for six weeks at a small house in
a fishing village called Freshingley. At this time the eldest girl,
whose name was Mildred, was eleven; the second girl, Phyllis, was
nine; while the boy, Martin, was eight.</p>

<p>These children, like the majority of children, were at their
best at the seaside, and Arthur made a further effort to get on
with them. They amused him at times, and he liked to watch them
bathing, and shared in their wild joy of revel in the sea and sun.
But between them there was always a barrier of distrust. They could
not exactly see the point of him, and he felt that they were only
polite to him because Edith urged them to be.</p>

<p>They called him "Arthur," and made no attempt to conceal their
opinion that he was a rather unnecessary addition to the family.
Mildred, who was an extraordinarily quick and intelligent child,
gave promise of resembling her mother, but unfortunately she
emphasized some of her mother's worst qualities.</p>

<p>As at one time in his life Arthur was prejudiced against a girl,
because she was reminiscent of her mother, so it is to be regretted
that now he was attacked by shafts of prejudice against a mother,
because she was reminiscent of her daughter. He was not by any
means aware of this. It was one of these sub-conscious processes
which affect us all. He was still convinced that he loved his wife
dearly, and that everything was for the best in this best of all
possible worlds.</p>

<p>When the moods of restlessness came to him, he persuaded himself
that he was out of sorts, or that there was some specific reason
for them.</p>

<p>It was not till the last week of their stay in Devonshire that
the first canker of real doubt crept into his soul.</p>

<p>One evening he and Edith went for a stroll alone up to the top
of Burness Common, which is on the edge of a moor two miles from
Freshingley. It was a perfect day, with an almost cloudless sky,
and the sun began to set "in the grand manner," as it does
occasionally at that time of year.</p>

<p>They sat on a flat slab of stone which local report described as
a relict of the Druids. All around them were low scrub and
blackberry bushes, and the air was heavy with the scent of gorse.
Little sheep-bells tinkled pleasantly in the near distance, and in
the garden of an old cottage a hundred yards away, a man was
cutting the lawn.</p>

<p>During the afternoon Arthur had been reading "Paolo and
Francesca" and he wanted to talk about it, but he discovered on the
way up that Edith had not read it. He was not particularly
surprised at this, but unreasonably disappointed. He talked about
the book a little, and about ideals, and then suddenly, when the
sun began to set, he felt a great desire for silence. He took her
hand and they watched the slow march of the golden light flooding
from the west. Everything seemed to become more vivid and
significant, and the birds sang above them as if in praise of this
wonderful system of gradations that lashed the horizon blood-red,
and left the sky overhead the palest topaz; and the bees were
making a last desperate effort to snatch the produce of the dying
sun.</p>

<p>"The time, and the place, and the loved one all together."</p>

<p>The boy sat there with the strings of his heart attoned to this
majestic phrase, when Edith said:</p>

<p>"The tints are simply perfect, aren't they?"</p>

<p>It is difficult to know what it is about a word that makes it
have the effect of shattering an illusion. A word can, at its best,
express but little, yet it can at times give the index to a quality
of thought.</p>

<p>Tints! Poor Edith! Perhaps, if she had lived long enough among
artists, she would have known that they don't use the word "tint."
It is certain that if she had known the effect the word would have
on her irrational beloved, she would not have used it. He started
visibly, and then pulled himself together. After all, why should
Edith&mdash;? At the same time, to talk about "tints" means that
you don't appreciate values. "Tints" is a ridiculously trivial word
to use in connection with a sunset. Old ladies at sketching classes
talk about "tints." As a word it has no dignity, no majesty, no
real beauty; it is a superficial thing. It meant that she didn't
feel the sunset in the way he did. And immediately the string
became slightly out of tune.</p>

<p>"The time, and the place, and&mdash;a vacuum!"</p>

<p>Such are the little things that mark the milestones of our
journey, as we go haltingly down the hill when the sun has set.</p>

<p><br>
In town once more, the physical effects of the holiday reacted on
"The Fugitive Philosopher." He set to work with a will, and drowned
the whispers of these unfulfilled longings in the rhetorical
outpourings of the gay iconoclast. He hammered away at the
white-hot metal of his evolutionary ideas, and tried to forge a
constructive thesis. He hit out right and left among the social
idols, and succeeded in one or two cases in bringing upon himself
both opprobrium and praise. An eminent magazine accepted and
published three of the commentaries, and one which was called "The
Fairway of the Styx" and which described the nugatory movement of a
certain press syndicate which, by keeping in mid-channel, never
reached either shore, led to a certain amount of discussion. And
other people made their appearance at Edith's hospitable
board&mdash;critics and editors, and even a well-known
publisher.</p>

<p>The great psychological difference between Edith and Arthur
centered round that word "ambition." Edith could not help being
ambitious in the worldly sense; it was ingrained in her. She could
not see the point of doing a thing unless you were a success at it.
You should take your place and be recognized as a great exponent of
whatever yon were doing. With her keen, practical mind, and her
instinct for managing and organizing, she identified herself with
Arthur's work, and automatically pushed it forward. Arthur did not
know one-tenth of the things she did to get him talked about and
famous.</p>

<p>The boy fundamentally had none of this ambition. Or if he had,
it was an external thing that he assumed on the nights when he went
into "The Old Guys," or similar places. In his heart he despised it
in the same way that he despised himself if he drank too much, or
made "calves' eyes" at pretty actresses, or lost his temper and
behaved cruelly to his wife. All these things he did, and they had
their reaction; and then he sighed and "fought his way back."</p>

<p>But underneath it all was the other thing, the great
restlessness, the vague desire for interpretation of the motive of
"love in the big way."</p>

<p><br>
One morning he found an envelope on his desk. It was addressed in
unknown writing. He opened it and discovered a page cut from a
journal called "The Whispering Gallery."</p>

<p>"The Whispering Gallery" was one of those wretched parasites of
the press which eke out their miserable existence almost
exclusively through innuendo.</p>

<p>There were several pages of short paragraphs which were heralded
with the prefix: "Surely It Cannot Be True That&mdash;"</p>

<p>One of these ran:</p>

<p>"The author of a successful play now running in London, and who
is married to a lady whose first husband died 'in regrettable
circumstances,' was expelled from school for stealing?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX&mdash;AN AFFAIR IN "THE OLD GUYS"</h2>

<p>Arthur's first instinct on reading this paragraph was to cry
out:</p>

<p>"The cads!"</p>

<p>His second instinct was to rush off and fight some one; it was
essentially an affair of bloodletting. His third instinct was to
show it to Edith; and then he began to reflect. After all, it would
do no good to show it to Edith. He had never told her about the
affair of the pearl-handled penknife; in fact, he had almost
forgotten about it. How incredible it was after all these years!
Nearly eleven years, and then suddenly the thing is thrown in one's
teeth! How despicable! What good can it do anyone to dish up a
thing like that? Who could have done it? One of the boys, probably,
who was there at the same time and who was now clinging to the
lowest rung of the journalistic ladder&mdash;probably a much bigger
blackguard than he was himself!</p>

<p>For of course he was a blackguard. In the light of his present
mental outlook it was, in any case, a foolish thing to do. And yet
even now he didn't know that he viewed it as a criminal act. He
supposed he had a "kink"; it might be called his "property kink."
He couldn't get the hang of the property business. What, after all,
was property? How was it gained? Property was a dead thing, and the
gain of it was entirely fortuitous. If property were a symbol of
something noble, and if people were rewarded with property for
doing fine and noble things, he could understand something of the
awe with which it was treated. How did people make money! They
either inherited it, or they acquired it by cunning and rapacity,
by the exercise of their superior gift of "dealing" with their less
nimble-minded fellow-creatures. The simple, reverent person "earned
his living," but the huckster, the adventurer, the exploiter, "made
money." He thought of the salesmen at Blinkinshaw's, and of "Lady
Millworthy's Muff." It was all nonsense, disgusting. The worst
things in life were rewarded with property, and the harder people
struggled for property, the more vicious they became.</p>

<p>"Carrion crows fighting over a corpse," he thought.</p>

<p>And then, "In the end they'll destroy themselves."</p>

<p>He felt a tremendous desire to discuss this with some one, to
find some one with whom to share his righteous indignation. Edith?
The more he thought of it, the more impossible it seemed to talk
about it to Edith. She wouldn't understand. He couldn't explain to
her about the penknife. He could almost envisage her slightly
startled glance, and her involuntary shrinking back as she
said:</p>

<p>"But surely, Arthur, you didn't really <i>steal</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>His memory reverted to a paragraph he had read in a newspaper
the previous week. It was a Sunday paper which reproduced every
week a few paragraphs from its edition of ninety years ago. He had
read an account of a boy of nineteen being hanged in public at
Newgate for stealing three shillings from his master, a cutler in
Cheapside. Ninety years ago! It occurred to him at the time as
being horrible, but he had not thought of it in connection with
himself. Now he did. The penknife was worth at least twenty-five or
thirty shillings. At the present moment, if this law still held
good, he would be liable to hang! He might have been hanged by the
neck in public for stealing a penknife! What was the difference?
There was no difference between that boy and himself. The only
difference was in the social attitude toward them. In this way,
then, people were advancing. Property was, perhaps, less sacred.
And so a time would come&mdash;If it were less and less of an
offence to take property perhaps one day there would come the
realization that all property was illusory "objective
phenomena."</p>

<p>He became quite elated when this idea occurred to him. An
irresistible desire again came to him to talk to some one. He went
slowly across into the house. There was a little writing-room on
the ground floor where Edith often worked in the morning. She had a
desk there, and a lot of files and books. He went in stealthily.
She was not there. He glanced at a small pile of letters on the
desk, which she had opened and put together neatly. For some reason
he felt he must glance at her letters, and he did so. The third one
was an envelope identical with the one he had received containing
the cutting. He picked it up. It was empty!</p>

<p>So Edith knew; she had taken it away. He looked hurriedly in the
waste-basket. There was no sign of "The Whispering Gallery."</p>

<p>He felt strangely alarmed, and yet defiant. Then he heard her
coming downstairs. He was conscious at that moment of a somewhat
similar feeling to that which had assailed him when he was waiting
outside "the Rook's" study. He walked deliberately out into the
passage.</p>

<p>When Edith saw him, she said:</p>

<p>"Hullo, dear; do you want me?"</p>

<p>He looked at her keenly, and answered:</p>

<p>"No. I'm just looking for a thesaurus I left somewhere."</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll just have a look for you."</p>

<p>She entered the morning-room, and they both poked about in
corners, looking for a book which both knew was not there. He
wanted to talk to her, but was tongue-tied. He thought her eyes
looked strained, and the pupils seemed smaller, as though she were
trying to focus something beyond her normal vision. He said, after
a time:</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's out at the back after all. I'll have another
look."</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>"I'll look in the dining-room."</p>

<p>He followed her there, hoping that the barrier between them
might come crashing down, and that he could tell her what he wanted
to. They made a ridiculous and abortive search in most of the rooms
of the house. Sometimes he came near her, and felt tempted to throw
his arms round her and make her weep with him. But just when the
temptation was strongest, she would look up at him again with her
narrowing eyes.</p>

<p>He went at last, and she followed him over the way.</p>

<p>He found the thesaurus on his own desk where he had been
working. At least Edith saw it first, and pointed to it and
said:</p>

<p>"Well, you are a funny boy!" and she attempted to smile. But the
smile seemed forced and hard. He watched her leave the studio,
neither of them speaking.</p>

<p>When the door had shut, he looked at it for a long time, and
then buried his head in his hands. He wanted to think the whole
thing out clearly. The dominant thought that impressed him was that
it was silly, silly and trivial; and yet likely in some way to have
fateful consequences. He didn't know what these consequences would
be, but he felt that they would assert themselves in some dramatic
and uncomfortable way. Perhaps the case would be dished up in the
courts. He would have to appear in a libel suit. All sorts of
things might happen and be said. But even more disturbing was the
effect the paragraph was likely to have upon his relationship with
Edith; in fact, the effect it had already had. It was an
insuperable barrier. Whether they agreed to say nothing about it,
or whether they agreed to discuss it, there would always be that
indefinable mental residuum.</p>

<p>His mind went back to his school-boy days when he had visualized
himself in a detached way, as a boy hounded through life by the
unbreakable verdict of the law, the schoolmasters, the judges, the
police, the army and navy, and all the other disciplined forces of
society. He felt lonely and wretched. At one time it was as though
Edith had detached herself from these forces, and was willing to
fight for him tooth and nail. And he knew she would be willing to
do this now, in an external sense.</p>

<p>Her opposition would be passive, rather than active. She would
fight for him because she would believe it was her duty to do so,
and also because she loved him. But it would be a championship
vaguely unsatisfying. There were things about him she did not
grasp, and things about her he grasped too clearly.</p>

<p>The room seemed dark, and empty, and silent, and he sat there
listening to the crackling of the fire.</p>

<p>Suddenly the dark places of his mind were lighted by the
inspiring gleam of recollection. It was a spring day, and the
little white clouds were scudding before the warm breeze. A child
was looking up at the sky and saying:</p>

<p>"People are silly and bad, and they want helping."</p>

<p>Here was, indeed, the ultimate solution. There was no
misjudgment here, no carping criticism, no vague doubts or
suspicions. The mere fact that people were silly, meant that they
wanted helping. The mere fact that they were bad, meant that they
wanted helping. There was no other standard. It was final. You must
not hang people for being bad, you must help them. When would,
these forces of righteousness realize this childish truth? "Love in
the big way."</p>

<p>When would they realize that the human soul is more sacred than
property! Property! Property! Property! This dead thing that we had
made with our hands was now our master. We walked the dear earth,
with our hands and feet chained, while the iron God drove us
forward with a whip. While we went about our daily work, property
was scheming and arranging our future. Nay, more than that, in many
a secret chamber in Europe he was whispering and making silent
compacts. He was arranging the destruction of unborn children for
the satiation of his lust for gold. While we were wanting love and
the things of beauty, he was breeding hate, suspicion, jealousy,
and envy. He was forging more chains for our feet, more armor for
our bodies to wear, more morasses of material difficulties for us
to cross. Property made the laws, fixed the customs, ruled the
state with a rod of iron, controlled the church, and flung doles of
charity in the face of the dangerous poor.</p>

<p><i>Tick-tick-dot-dot-dash-dash-dash!</i> He thought of that
night he passed the newspaper printing plant on New Year's Eve.
What was going on behind all this? Plot and counter-plot. What had
property in store for the ultimate solution? Was it not more likely
that suddenly the heart of man would revolt against the iron God?
Then would come the greatest struggle of all.</p>

<p>"For a man to struggle against property," thought Arthur, "is
like a naked person with an umbrella fighting a giant in armor and
a broad sword. Well, what could he do? The only thing to do would
be to run away and breed more men with more umbrellas. And then one
day they would return. They would swarm round the man in armor and
attack him. A lot of them would be killed, but at last one of them
would be able to poke his umbrella into the giant's eye, and then
the giant would fall over. And when they had him on the ground they
would jump on him, and eventually get hold of his sword, and stick
it into him between the joints of his armor.</p>

<p>"Yes," he thought after reflection. "That would be the greatest
joy of all, to kill him with his own sword."</p>

<p>He tried to settle down to work, but it was impossible. He took
his hat and went out. He wandered up to the top of Hampstead Heath.
A fine rain was falling, but he did not seem conscious of it. He
only became intensely aware of large and imposing houses, and
automobiles, and policemen. The army of righteousness! He went
right across the heath, and then southward. He made his way to
Camden Town, and Kentish Town, and passed through districts of
congested squalor. The words of "the Rook" recurred to him:</p>

<p>"If you will steal, you will do other things. You are the most
dangerous type to have in a school; you have ability, and no moral
bias."</p>

<p>It was untrue; he had moral bias. It was toward love, which is
the only true morality there is. Love, which was as virile in
Camden Town as in the mansions on Hampstead Heath. But property
would take no account of love, except the love it could buy.
Honesty, sobriety, and chastity&mdash;these were the virtues that
property admired and encouraged. Property had no objection to
drinking to excess in his own home, to being brutal and bestial to
his wife in the secrecy of his own chamber, to bringing off a
brilliant "scoop" in the city by some involved transaction that,
performed in a meaner manner, would land him in the police court;
but property was very strict when it came to the actions of his
dependents.</p>

<p>And so with cynical insolence he drew up a table of moral
values. Such and such a fine for drunkenness in public, so many
months' imprisonment for interfering with his property, so many
thousand pounds for interfering with his wife.</p>

<p>"Think of it," Arthur said to himself. "You can buy an umbrella
for ten-and-sixpence, and the virtue of a woman for a similar
amount."</p>

<p>Umbrellas kept running through his head that day, probably
because it was raining, and he had none.</p>

<p>"You can buy the virtue of any woman who is agreeable for quite
a small sum, providing she does hot belong to Mr. Property. Then
she becomes very, very expensive. It is exactly the same table,
only much more expensive. He has no other way of looking at it than
through pounds, shillings, and pence."</p>

<p>In the Euston Road a young girl passed him, with dark rims round
her eyes. She passed very slowly, and said something.</p>

<p>He did not stop, but he muttered to himself:</p>

<p>"I could take you, my dear, take you and hurt you terribly. I
could even destroy you in an indirect and horrible fashion, and Mr.
Property would not mind. You don't come within the iron circle of
his rules. Although I have 'no moral bias,' I could love you. Do
you understand f I could love you in the big way. I could be your
friend and help you, simply because you want help. I think Alice
would help you, too. She understands these things. I don't know
whether she would call you silly or bad. Silly, I should think, but
in any case it would be sufficient that in your heart you were
unhappy. Something in her would stretch out to meet something in
you."</p>

<p><br>
He found himself near Charing Cross, and he was feeling tired and
hungry. He went into a restaurant and ordered some food. While they
were bringing it, he recollected that it was Saturday night, the
night of "The Old Guys."</p>

<p>He sat a long time after his meal, thinking and rolling
cigarettes. Then he had a whisky and soda, and strolled across to
the Adelphi.</p>

<p>When he entered the club he heard the low roar of conversation
and the occasional popping of corks. He hung up his hat and coat,
and entered the dub-room. There was the same crowd, and the air was
thick with tobacco-smoke. A famous Belgian cellist was talking
French to a small group of men he did not know. He strolled past
them. One or two men nodded to him, and he found Gregory Brecknock
talking to two other actors. As he approached them he thought he
detected a slight interchange of comment, and the conversation
seemed to shift its ground. Their faces looked shiny in the white
light, and the skin was drawn tightly across their cheek-bones.
Brecknock said in his well-modulated voice:</p>

<p>"Well, dear boy, how's the wife?"</p>

<p>Arthur said:</p>

<p>"All right, thanks."</p>

<p>He stood on the fringe of the group, smoking. The actors
continued their conversation, but somehow they did not seem anxious
to draw him into it. He wandered away and talked to other men. In
the further room Lee Chadde, the comedian, was howling a comic
song, and he could hear the roars of laughter greeting the
"points." He stood near the doorway and thought to himself:</p>

<p>"Several of these men have seen the paragraph; I can tell by
their manner. They look at me and their eyes narrow in the same way
Edith's did. There's that old swine, Carraway; he's nearly drunk
already. I believe he was whispering about me just now to that
other man. He sends companies on tour. He's rolling in money. They
say he seduces the girls in his chorus; it's one of the
stipulations. They think it's rather 'amusing' here. They call him
an 'old character.' They don't mind that about him. At least, it
isn't 'they'; it's property. But they look at me like an unclean
thing. They're in a perfect terror lest I might go and 'pinch' one
of their umbrellas. Well, let them go to blazes! I'm going to have
a drink."</p>

<p>He drank several whisky and sodas and felt an insolent
indifference to the crowd. He talked to Campbell, the dramatic
critic of "The Bird's-eye View," and contradicted him about his
opinion on Shaw. He argued with old Wybourg about industrialism,
and tweaked a gentleman named Tylor about his melancholy outlook
concerning the stage. But all the time there was stirring within
him a simmering hatred toward Carraway. His eyes kept roving
towards the fat, flabby face of the theatrical manager, and nearly
every time he looked, he noticed Carraway glancing furtively in his
direction. He was, moreover, whispering to people in thick
whispers. Arthur became convinced that Carraway was talking about
him and quoting the paragraph.</p>

<p>The old Adam of violence spoke through his veins. It was nearly
midnight when one of those unfortunate scenes which are of such
rare occurrence in a gentlemen's club took place in "The Old Guys."
Arthur was not exactly drunk, but he had had enough whisky to give
him a perverse and ill-proportioned sense of things. He fumbled his
way through the crowd till he was right opposite Carraway, and he
looked straight at him.</p>

<p>Carraway leered superciliously and suddenly said in his guttural
voice:</p>

<p>"Oh, Gaffyn, let me introduce you to my friends, Mr.
&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then Arthur looked at Carraway insolently from his eyes to
his boots, and deliberately turned his back on the three of them.
He suddenly felt a heavy nudge in his back, and turning round
beheld Carraway's malevolent face thrust close to his. He said with
a low growl:</p>

<p>"I'd like to know what the devil you mean by that?"</p>

<p>And Arthur pushed by him and answered:</p>

<p>"Oh, you go to hell!"</p>

<p><br>
And then the preposterous affair rapidly reached its climax. He
felt his face suddenly splashed with the contents of a glass, and
he turned and slapped the flabby cheeks of Carraway with the full
force of his open hand. Then the commotion began. Carraway rushed
at him like a bull, but this was the thing Arthur had been looking
forward to for nearly two hours. He ducked and brought his left up
with a snap to Carraway's jaw, and rejoiced that he had learned
something of this game from "old Moll" at Cullington. The fight was
not allowed to proceed beyond the exchange of two or three blows
before the crowd of men separated them, with cries of:</p>

<p>"Hullo! What's all this! Steady! Steady!"</p>

<p>But to Arthur's delight, he was aware of having got in a really
good "left" to Carraway's fat cheek, high up, quite sufficient to
result in a pretty useful black eye. The noise became deafening,
and two groups surrounded the two men, while the secretary and two
older members of the committee were calling out:</p>

<p>"Order, please, gentlemen! No fighting here. Keep them apart.
Order! order!"</p>

<p>Arthur found himself rounded up and pushed out of the room, but
before he had reached the hall he heard the voice of Carraway
bawling out:</p>

<p>"He's a dirty thief!"</p>

<p>In the vestibule of the club, the secretary, who was accompanied
by Brecknock, came bustling up and said:</p>

<p>"What's all this about, Gaffyn?"</p>

<p>And Arthur, with the school-boy spirit still strong in him,
answered:</p>

<p>"He cheeked me."</p>

<p>There was a great noise of talking all around him, but he
thought he heard the secretary mutter:</p>

<p>"Well, well, we shall have to make an inquiry about this."</p>

<p>He went out into the air, feeling strangely calmed. It had been
a soothing and satisfactory termination to a restless day. He
walked all the way back to St. John's Wood, and did not realize
till nearly home that his clothes were almost wet through. He let
himself in, and as usual found Edith waiting up for him. She came
out into the hall and, he thought, kissed him rather feverishly.
Then she put her hand to her head and said:</p>

<p>"I think I'll go straight up, dear. I have rather a bad
head."</p>

<p>He answered quietly:</p>

<p>"Oh. I'm sorry. You shouldn't have waited up."</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>"Why, of course. I couldn't go to bed till you came in. You'll
find anything you want in the dining-room."</p>

<p>She started to go slowly up the stairs, when Arthur said:</p>

<p>"I've been to 'The Old Guys.' I've handed in my
resignation."</p>

<p>He said this, partly because he wanted her to know, and partly
because he wanted to see her eyes. She stopped abruptly and looked
down at him.</p>

<p>"Have you? Why?"</p>

<p>He answered nonchalantly:</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. I think they're rather a lot of
bounders."</p>

<p>She looked at him questioningly, and he noticed that her eyes
had not altered since the morning, except that they appeared more
strained and tired. He said:</p>

<p>"Good-night."</p>

<p>And she answered faintly, and walked hesitatingly up the
stairs.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI&mdash;A FIELD OF DAFFODILS</h2>

<p>"Either it is true, dear boy, or it isn't true. If it is
true&mdash;well, there's nothing more to be said. If it isn't true,
I'm afraid it's up to you to start a libel action."</p>

<p>Gregory Brecknock walked up and down in Arthur's studio, with
short, deliberate steps. He was obviously concerned. Arthur lolled
back in his swivel chair, and chewed the end of a pen. At last he
said:</p>

<p>"What do you mean precisely by 'there's nothing more to be
said'?"</p>

<p>Brecknock shrugged his shoulders:</p>

<p>"Well, really, dear boy, it simply amounts to the fact that the
thing must take its course. The paragraph was produced at the
committee-meeting of the club. There isn't the slightest doubt in
the mind of any member that it refers to you; although no one, mind
you, believes that it is true. The committee simply feels that it
is due to the honor of the club, and to the unfortunate publicity
that the affair has gained, that you should force 'The Whispering
Gallery' to apologize, or sue them for libel. If you do this,
Carraway has promised to make an <i>amende honorable</i>, but if
you won't, he threatens all sorts of things. He's very annoyed, and
his left eye is a perfect gem of color."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you; it is true."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Why, it's absurd, dear boy. There must have been some sort of
silly mistake. People like you don't steal."</p>

<p>"I tell you, I stole a penknife. What's that to do with
Carraway?"</p>

<p>"That's what Carraway wants to know. He says he made no
reference to your stealing anything till you punched him in the
eye. And now everybody in London is talking about it."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to apologize, or take out an action for libel, or
do anything."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid they'll ask you to resign."</p>

<p>"You can tell them I've resigned already."</p>

<p>Brecknock did another turn up and down the room, and then he
said in an altered voice:</p>

<p>"Come, come, Arthur. I wish you would be reasonable about this.
I introduced you to the club, you know. I feel responsible. I'm
sure it's all nonsense. Even if there is anything in the statement
(boys do do queer things, you know), the suggestion is still
libelous. You've made a fool of yourself over this, dear boy. No
one would have bothered about the paragraph in 'The Whispering
Gallery' if you hadn't made such a scene. The silly rumor would
have died in a fortnight. But now you must fight it."</p>

<p>Arthur thought for a moment, and then he answered:</p>

<p>"I suppose you don't think it would matter having Edith dragged
into it, too, and 'the regrettable incident'?"</p>

<p>"That part of the paragraph would not be the subject of
libel."</p>

<p>"But it would all come out. No, Gregory, it's all rot. I won't
have anything to do with it. Of course I'll be sorry to leave 'The
Old Guys,' but it won't break my heart."</p>

<p>"But, my dear boy," persisted Brecknock after meditation, "I
want to point out to you that if you take this course, the affair
won't terminate with your resignation at 'The Old Guys.' Everybody
will get to know about it. They 11 believe that the story is true,
and they will exaggerate it. You won't be able to belong to any
decent club, and you will be boycotted wherever you go. It will
ruin your career."</p>

<p>"Career! career!" cried the boy, waxing furious. "What's the
good of coming and talking to me like a schoolmaster about careers!
The very word stinks. It's what all these fools think about, and
nothing else! Careers and personal ambitions; swine with their eyes
glued on the ground, rushing down the steep place. Call me a fool
if you like, only don't come and howl about careers, as though all
one's work was just a means of edging nearer stage-center! Good
God! Brecknock, as you stand there, you remind me of 'The Rook.'
That's what we called our head-master at Cullington. He talked
about my career and about 'the honor of the school.' The honor of
the school! Do you hear that? I tell you, all these
things&mdash;careers, ambition, honor&mdash;are empty terms. How
can a thing have honor which hasn't a heart? The words sound like
the rattle of dice in a box, and when the player has thrown them on
the table, everybody looks to see whether he's lucky, or unlucky;
but they don't stop to realize that the dice-box is empty, because
in most cases the player has thrown away his all."</p>

<p>The actor shook his head and smiled.</p>

<p>"I don't follow you, Arthur. I'm talking about 'honor,' not
'honors.' I quite agree that what you say holds good with 'honors,'
but not with 'honor'."</p>

<p>"What is the diflference?"</p>

<p>"I'm not good at definitions. But you know the meaning of honor.
It's a big word. It's the kind of behavior we expect from each
other&mdash;chivalry, fair play, and so on."</p>

<p>"I tell you, if you get it down to a fine point, it's just a
question of personal vanity. There's no difference between 'honor'
and 'honors.' There are crowds of men who are strictly honorable,
who wouldn't do a dirty trick to save their lives, and yet who
ought to be horsewhipped through the streets of London. And there
are crowds of dishonorable men, who play ducks and drakes with the
ten commandments, and yet who are of such a quality of soul that
the others are not fit to lick their boots."</p>

<p>Gregory Brecknock shrugged his shoulders and sighed.</p>

<p>"Well, if I can't persuade you, I can't," he said, and then he
came forward, and shook Arthur's hand.</p>

<p>"You're a rum chap," he added, and took his departure.</p>

<p><br>
After he had gone, Arthur went into the house and interviewed
Edith.</p>

<p>"I want to go away into the country for a bit," he said. "I
can't work here. London is getting on my nerves."</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>"Very well. Would you like me to go with you?"</p>

<p>He hesitated, and answered:</p>

<p>"Of course I should like it. I don't want to bother you, though.
I'm not very companionable just now."</p>

<p>"Where shall we go? I'd like to go away with you for a change.
We can leave the children."</p>

<p>"I should like to go to Bodiesham."</p>

<p>"That would be delightful. I'll make the arrangements."</p>

<p>He went back to the studio and picked up several sheets of
manuscript, and put them down again. Words and phrases jumbled
through his mind. Careers! Honor and honors! Love! He had been a
fool to work up that row with Carraway. If it had not been for
that, the affair might have fizzled out. Impulse! A very dangerous
person. Impulse, no friend of property. One must always be
circumspect, tactful, <i>expedient</i>. A disgusting word,
expediency! Expediency was the <i>aurea mediocritas</i> of
property. Politicians, editors, publicists, acted invariably
through expediency. What a temptation it must be sometimes to act
on impulse, to be flagrantly sincere! Sometimes, indeed, the
primitive school-boy instinct would assert itself. A member in the
House of Commons would call another a "damned liar." Then property
would rap on the desk and say, "Order! order!" The conspiracy of
righteousness would reestablish itself.</p>

<p>In the meantime he would go down to Bodiesham and think things
out amid the silence of the dunes.</p>

<p>In the afternoon he heard the two eldest children come home from
school. The eldest boy was shouting up the stairs, and Edith was
calling back in reply. A little later he could vaguely hear the
second girl practising scales in a room above.</p>

<p>It suddenly occurred to him:</p>

<p>"What have all these people to do with me? These are Edith's
children. They and that part of her life which they represent,
which was the finest part of her life, are nothing to me. In a way
she loves me, in a passionate, possessive way; and I love her. But
she leaves my soul hungry, unsatisfied, empty."</p>

<p>In the evening two people came to dinner, and he proved a morose
and unsociable host. When they had gone he said to Edith:</p>

<p>"I hope you won't mind. I've been thinking about it. But I want
to be utterly alone for a little while. After a few weeks at
Bodiesham let us meet, and we can go and stay together at
Eastbourne, or wherever you like for as long as you like. Only just
for the moment&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her eyes were watching him intently. He fancied she gave a
little involuntary shudder, but she said quite placidly:</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p><br>
He spent the following day getting a few odds and ends together,
and late in the afternoon when he was coming out of a shop in
Oxford Street, where he had been to get some books, he ran into
Levistock. The Yorkshireman looked thinner and more lugubrious than
ever. He seized Arthur's hand, and pulled him down a side
street.</p>

<p>"The bust has come, Gaffyn," he said.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Levistock?"</p>

<p>"They've done the old man in. The place is chaos."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that 'Pa' has left Blinkinshaw's?"</p>

<p>Levistock nodded his head, and spoke agitatedly.</p>

<p>"They rounded him up like a pack of low-bred hounds. It was
simply a plot. Henry Waldren and White got hold of James
Blinkinshaw and some of the others. There's been a perfect dust-up.
About seven of the chaps have been sacked, and Henry and White
share Pa's position. Cutting down expenses, you see. And they've
sprung it that Pa is too extravagent with his ideas, too
idealistic, not keen enough on doing what is wanted by the public.
But it would never have come about, if it hadn't been for Waldren
and White. They don't care one way or the other. They simply wanted
his job."</p>

<p>"They betrayed him, in fact?"</p>

<p>"They're swine! They're all swine. The decks are cleared for all
the dirty business of grab and take. No one gives a damn. No one
has any interest in the firm, except what he can get out of it.
It's all dead. Pa began talking one night, and James Blinkinshaw
said he wasn't going to have a 'serious' business affected by this
medieval rot about gilds, and so on. It happened that, at the
moment, he had a pull over Fred, because he had just made a lot of
money over some hotel deal&mdash;nearly quarter of a million, they
say. James and Fred had a bally row, but Fred, for once, had to
give way. I tellyou, it's hell!"</p>

<p>"And what has happened to Pa?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I expect he'll get a job somewhere else. He took
it very well. He seemed a bit dazed and disappointed. He said to me
the night before he left, 'I could have done a lot with this place,
Levistock.' I don't believe he cares about himself. He's sick that
the big idea didn't come off, sick and disillusioned. He'll never
get such a chance again."</p>

<p>"If you hear where he's gone to, let me know, Levistock."</p>

<p>"All right. I expect I shall hear. What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"Trying to live down 'Lady Millworthy's Muff' and other
things."</p>

<p>"Ah! I'm glad you say that. It is drivel. I went to see it. It
somehow didn't seem a bit like you."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you the story of it one day. Good-by, Levistock."</p>

<p>"Good-by."</p>

<p>The news about Blinkinshaw's disturbed Arthur considerably.
During the business of packing and preparing for his departure,
there kept rumbling at the back of his mind the reflection that
nothing can last that exists solely for material ends. Even a
business must have some redeeming quality of idealism. There must
be character, sacrifice to an idea, a sense of service. All the old
business concerns that had survived were like that. They had been
started by men of character, and very often handed down to their
sons, or others imbued with the same ideals. Directly they came
into the clutches of "the claws and talons crowd," they went to
pieces. Business was like that, and so were states and
communities.</p>

<p>It was the second day of March when he arrived at Bodiesham, and
there was no question this time of lacking the "bare necessities."
Edith had sent down an old housekeeper and a considerable amount of
furniture. He found fires lighted in several of the rooms, and the
lawns had been cut and trimmed, but no attempt had been made to
interfere with the general character of the bungalow.</p>

<p>He suffered a reaction of remorse on his first night. He felt he
had been unkind to Edith, unkind and selfish. He longed for the
comfort of her arms and the sanctuary of her protecting presence.
He felt tired, and weak, and sorry for himself. The incidents of
the last week jumbled together in his mind in a riot of discontent.
He felt himself a failure; and everything that he valued was a
failure. He, and his father, and Frank Leffbury, and people like
themselves were not only not wanted; they were hated. The
juggernaut of social progress came pounding across them, anxious to
grind them to dust. If they were to live, they must subscribe to
the edicts of the great machine. They must do what property
required and jettison the rest.</p>

<p>He thought about Edith intently. Why had he experienced that
sudden passion to escape from her? It was something to do with his
work. He wanted to re-establish himself, "to fight his way back,"
as Mr. Leffbury had said. His nerves were jangled by the
environment of insincerity of which he had become suddenly aware in
London. But Edith was not insincere. It was only that she wouldn't
quite understand. He wanted to go out on the sand-dunes and be
alone, and think about his work clearly, but he had the
disconcerting recollection of her reference to "tints." It was
wildly unreasonable and selfish, and he was aware of it, and angry
with himself for feeling it and giving way to it. He spent a
wretched night pitying himself and Edith and the world. The world
to which he wanted to give so much, and yet which seemed so anxious
to shut him out!</p>

<p>In the morning he rose early and went out on the dunes. A cold
breeze was blowing from the north, but he felt comfort in the
action of walking and in the contemplation of the open countenance
of nature. In the afternoon he painted a clump of sea-holly
silhouetted against the black fabric of an old tarred wreck on the
shore, and experienced the first thrill of unalloyed pleasure he
had enjoyed for many a day.</p>

<p>In the evening the housekeeper cooked him a meal, and afterward
he settled down to write.</p>

<p>The month of March proved particularly cold and wet and windy,
and his opportunities for finding relief in painting were rare, but
he gradually settled down to develop the further disputations of
"The Fugitive Philosopher." He revised and polished and furbished
that discriminating gentleman until he became a very real and
endearing companion. He wrote to Edith regularly, but made no
further reference to the idea of meeting her in Eastbourne, and she
replied promptly and in loving terms, but gave no hint that she
expected him to. It was an unfortunate fact about Edith that she
was a very poor letter-writer. She had no gift for expressing
herself. Her letters were full of little facts about the house and
their friends and the children, and solicitude for his welfare and
instructions for the housekeeper; never anything else.</p>

<p>Arthur liked to see her letters lying on the breakfast-table,
because he knew it meant that she was all right. But he knew so
well what they would contain that gradually he began to skim them
through. They never had the element of surprise, or expressed any
point of view that was not utterly dull.</p>

<p>This was the more regretable because, in herself, Edith was not
essentially dull. A nature so full of ability and resource was ever
revealing itself in new lights, but like so many people of her
kind, when she sat down to write a letter she became somewhat
self-conscious of the fact, and of her lack of the power of
expression, and she consequently confined herself to bald
statements of little facts, which read as interestingly as an
iron-monger's catalogue.</p>

<p>Early in April there came a sudden change in the weather. Arthur
went out one day and was aware of that first velvety quality of
tenderness in the air which makes one lift up one's heart. "The
Fugitive Philosopher" warmed to this happy transition. He wrote
entrancingly of the triumph of young life, and even broke into
verse of the beauty of "April Among the Sand-Dunes."</p>

<p>One day he went through the meadow-lands near Lenby-Wodehurst,
and beheld for the first time that year a field of young daffodils.
The vision stirred him by its dazzling beauty, but there followed a
sudden reaction, a moment of emptiness.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," he thought, "to love this by oneself."</p>

<p>He walked home, thinking of Edith and the daffodils and the
mystery of life, little knowing that the inevitable was even at
that moment racing through the country to deliver its climax at his
door.</p>

<p>For the inevitable on this occasion took the form of a large
automobile containing three people, a chauffeur, a very big man,
and a dainty woman.</p>

<p>Arthur was just about to have tea when he heard the fearsome
thing come snorting up to the gate, and he thought to himself:</p>

<p>"Oh, hell! Here's that wretched Walter!"</p>

<p>He did not go to the door for a few minutes, in fact, not till
he heard a voice that he immediately recognized calling out:</p>

<p>"Hello, Gaff! My! isn't this a splendid situation."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII&mdash;ALICE HEARS THE NIGHTINGALE</h2>

<p>Young life was very much to the fore that evening. The climax
enveloped our hero with a bewildering intensity. Everything that
had ever happened to himself or to the world seemed inconsequential
and worthless. All remorse, foreboding, and regret vanished. He
stood there grinning with pleasure, while Leslie kept on calling
him "Dear old Gaff," and hitting and punching him till he
positively hurt. He could not take his eyes off Alice, and his
heart kept saying illogically, "She's entirely different, and she's
exactly the same."</p>

<p>His visitors were in a tremendous state of high spirits, and
they were all over the bungalow in the space of a few minutes, like
children. Leslie, as usual, was the more loquacious, and he
explained as he plunged up the stairs:</p>

<p>"Lordy! we did get a turn when we found you weren't at home.
Your good wife&mdash;My! isn't she a peach!&mdash;told us how the
land lay. Bit run down by city life, eh? Well, you've struck a
quiet enough retreat here, anyway. What a place to work and think!
Your old dad built it, didn't he? He must have been a very
considerable artist. Look at this timber-roof, Alice? Did you ever
see anything like it? Well, we thought we'd spring a bit of a
surprise on you. It was Alice's fault. She had what she called
'wanderlust'; it came on exactly three weeks ago yesterday. She
came to me and said, 'Boodles, I want to go aroaming, or I'll go
crazy.' 'All right,' I said. 'In the fall we'll buzz round Europe.'
'Fall!' she said. 'Nonsense! I want to start to-morrow.' I said it
was impossible, but I found our things packed and two seats on the
Eastern express booked, and mother fixed it up with some cousins of
ours. Whiz! bang! we were in New York in a week, and there we had
to lie around for two days, with Alice eating her head off. When we
were on the ocean she seemed to breathe for the first time, and was
quite agreeable to me during the crossing. We arrived in Liverpool
yesterday morning, called at your home last night, and lo and
behold! here we are!"</p>

<p>Arthur laughed.</p>

<p>"It's jolly for me. I like people who do things on impulse."</p>

<p>"Dear old Gaff! Now, look here; we've fixed up this old wreck of
an automobile and we mean to do some of the rural and cathedral
stunts in this island. Is there a hotel nearby where we can rest
for two days, and then won't you come with us?"</p>

<p>They were standing in a group in one of the bedrooms upstairs,
and the window was open. Under the eaves of his father's house the
martins were twittering, telling each other of the mad things of
which young life was capable.</p>

<p>Arthur looked at Alice, and said:</p>

<p>"There's no reason why you shouldn't stay here a day or two.
There are several beds. It would be ripping. Then we could see. I
ought to be working, of course, but it's awfully nice to have you
both."</p>

<p>There was considerable protest at the inconvenience this
arrangement might cause, but eventually it was agreed to. Edith's
camp-bed was brought into requisition again, and the housekeeper
was sent scurrying across to the farm for more eggs and bacon and
milk. The chauffeur was sent to Lenby-Wodehurst to put the car up
at a garage, and to stop the night where he liked.</p>

<p>While they were having an evening meal, Arthur looked at Alice
and said:</p>

<p>"Do you remember the day when we flew a kite in the Luxembourg
Gardens?"</p>

<p>And all the time he was thinking to himself:</p>

<p>"It's very curious that I never realized she would one day be a
woman. She's very much a woman. She has the poise of womanhood,
with all the grave expectancy of a child. Her eyes are limpid and
express the wondering vision of a Donatello Madonna.</p>

<p class="poem">'Her rapt soul stirring in her eyes'</p>

<p>Who was it said that? She was born for motherhood. She should be
the mother of a saint, or perhaps of a sinner whom she would make a
saint by her enveloping purity."</p>

<p>He also thought:</p>

<p>"She has her hair up. Now one can see more clearly the delicate
shape of her little head. I like the quick way she tilts her chin
back and laughs at her brother."</p>

<p>And as these thoughts were racing through his mind, Alice
clapped her hands and cried out:</p>

<p>"Will I ever forget the day we flew the kite? And the little
fleecy clouds way up above it, and the bearded cabby and the
candies we bought at Mouquin's, Mr. Gaff? Shall I call him 'Gaff,'
Boodles? You know we always do at home."</p>

<p>"Yes, you may call him 'Gaff,' but you mustn't call him Arthur.
We all know you flirted outrageously with him in Paris, but now
that you have your hair up and he's a married man, we'll have to
put a stop to it. Do you know what we call you in Los Angeles,
Gaff?"</p>

<p>There was a fearful scuffle between brother and sister, but
Leslie managed to get out:</p>

<p>"We call you Alice's&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he never succeeded in saying exactly what it was of Alice's
that Arthur was reputed to represent on the shore of the Pacific
Ocean. Alice said it was too bad, and that if he said what it was,
she would go right away and have nothing more to do with him. They
talked after that about old times, and the modern trend in art, and
the careers of some of the men they had known at Monsieur
Berthelot's. Leslie asked Arthur a hundred and one questions about
his work and his views. And Arthur told the whole story about "Lady
Millworthy's Muff," and explained his present ideas. Alice said
they were fine, and to his surprise he learned that she had spent
the last two years at the California Academy of Science, where she
had been making astonishing progress, according to Leslie, in
physics and chemistry.</p>

<p>"So that is the way," Arthur thought. "People are silly and bad,
and so we will help them through the medium of physics and
chemistry."</p>

<p>"To-morrow," he said, "I would like to show you a field of
daffodils."</p>

<p>This was received with acclamation, and Alice said
excitedly:</p>

<p>"I want to hear a nightingale. Do you know. Gaff, I've never
heard a nightingale."</p>

<p>And Leslie added:</p>

<p>"It's a very remarkable thing, Gaff, but in California where we
have the very finest scenery in the world and the most beautiful
flowers and natural fauna, and where the air is clear and bright,
we have virtually no singing-birds. While in this little murky
swamp of an island, where the air is always damp and the sun shines
for about five minutes a fortnight, you have some of the finest
songsters in the world. Now isn't that strange?"</p>

<p>Alice said it wasn't strange; it was a very natural
compensation, and Arthur remarked:</p>

<p>"Very well. When I've shown you the daffodils we'll go in search
of the nightingale. There are not many about here. They're not fond
of the sea, but we shall hear them further inland. Surrey's a good
county."</p>

<p>The following day was warm, with a moist gray sky, and they
walked across the dunes to Lenby-Wodehurst. Arthur was in the
seventh heaven of happiness. He forgot all about the pearl
penknife, "The Old Guys," and his "career"; and alas! it must be
acknowledged that he did not think a great deal about his wife. The
country around his father's bungalow seemed to have a fresh
significance. It surprised him that he had not realized before how
beautiful it was&mdash;the gentle slopes of sand with the dark
bushes, and the little, definite, pale yellow notes of the young
gorse, the low horizon and the great sweep of moving clouds above.
It was all moist and sane and loving, and as they neared the
meadowland, the gray piles of farm-buildings, and the brown cattle
scattered in the green distances, and the young willows growing in
a clump by Farmer Ridgway's pond, came into view. Alice had her
daffodils. Ah! the joy it was to see her face light up, and the
free, splendid way she ran to meet them. She was across a gate and
among them, like a mother among her young children from whom she
had been separated too long. With little cries of pleasure she
gathered them up and held them for the others to see.</p>

<p>And Leslie cried out:</p>

<p>"Well now, did you ever! It's a sight for the gods!"</p>

<p>And Arthur said:</p>

<p>"Isn't it perfectly glorious!"</p>

<p>Leslie was thinking of the daffodils, and Arthur was thinking of
the daffodils and Alice, and of the young life that is born on an
April morning. They trudged through the moist meadows and
penetrated into the coppice near Farmer Cotter's. There Alice found
some white violets and primroses, and the hour was very satisfying.
Her face was radiant and flushed, and she held them to her
bosom.</p>

<p>As Arthur and Leslie climbed over a stile that marked the track
on the way to the brick-works, she called out:</p>

<p>"Hi! there, you boys, are you running away from me?"</p>

<p>And she suddenly burst into song:</p>

<p class="poem">"Oh, never leave me,<br>
Oh, don't deceive me!<br>
How could you treat<br>
A poor maiden so?"</p>

<p>"Do you boys want to go and visit that old brickworks, or what
is the idea!"</p>

<p>It was Alice's voice, young and fresh, breaking the spell, but
somehow he could not reply. Leslie was saying to him:</p>

<p>"Well, mine host, and what is the proposition now?"</p>

<p>He said "Eh?" and looked at them both vaguely. Why have these
things the power to come back across the years and jeer at us?
Ironic truths! The penknife, the wayward kiss, the sudden yielding
to an unforeseen temptation, and lo! something is pushed back,
obscured. We are older, wearier, shop-worn. We no longer have the
right to look into the eyes of youth. That part of us is damaged.
It is only permitted because underneath it all, there is something
that is untouched, that we may "fight our way back to." Arthur
remembered how, on that morning, the martin had swept in curves
above the hedge and had been a symbol to him; as though there were
some protecting genius lurking beneath the eaves of his father's
house, something that was still sacred to him, a sanctuary that
external behavior could not pollute. Almost mechanically he
said:</p>

<p>"I think we had better be returning to the bungalow."</p>

<p>"Well, I could eat something," replied Leslie. Alice laughed,
and the day once more resumed its normal loveliness.</p>

<p>They stayed five days in Bodiesham, and then "the old wreck of
an automobile" being brought from Lenby-Wodehurst, and the question
of whether Arthur would accompany them or not being thought
unnecessary of discussion, the three of them started out one
morning in search of cathedrals and nightingales and old timbered
houses and historical homesteads and rolling country and romance.
They went to Winchester and Salisbury and Stratford and Wells and
Tewkesbury, and Arthur began to deplore that "the island" was not
more thickly populated with cathedrals. He figured it out that in a
month they could visit every cathedral in it, and the dream might
end.</p>

<p><br>
It was in an old, timbered inn near Winchester that Alice heard the
nightingale. They arrived there very late and dined alone in the
public room. After dinner they explored the inn, and the insatiable
Leslie found in the landlord a most productive source of
information. He asked him every conceivable question about the
antiquity of the place, the construction of the building, the
history of the county; about the landlord's personal life, his
ideas, and his religion. And the landlord, who was, indeed, a rare
relict of landlordism, was very proud to be thus drawn out, and
very proud of his inn and its antiquity, and excessively proud of
his own history and of his ideas and his religious views.</p>

<p>Much as Arthur admired this fast-vanishing type of humanity, at
the end of an hour he became restlessly aware that in some way the
warm splendors of an April night were not being taken the fullest
advantage of. He went quickly from the room and explored the upper
storeys of the house. There was no balcony, but a small room that
was probably used on rare occasions as a private sitting-room had a
lattice-window that opened out on to the garden. He stood there for
a moment, and then heard a sound that made his heart thrill. He
went back on tiptoe to the room where the others were. The landlord
was telling Leslie the story of a stuffed pike that adorned a glass
case above the fireplace, and Alice was listening a little
abstractedly. She looked up and smiled as he came in, but the
landlord continued his dissertation. Arthur went up to her, and
whispered:</p>

<p>"Come and hear the nightingale."</p>

<p>She stood up with alacrity, and they both went quickly from the
room. They did not speak as they crept upstairs, and he led her to
the lattice-window in the room above, which was only lighted by the
dim reflection of the night sky. They stood side by side and peered
out.</p>

<p>The night was still and warm, with the hushed aspect of
expectancy. The thin crescent of a pale moon hung idly in the sky,
lighted by the glow of myriad stars. The country lay beneath them,
formless and mysterious. Deep tones of warm gray and black blended
into each other, or vanished mysteriously, broken here and there by
vague touches of lighter tone. Trees near at hand took on grotesque
forms, and there was the feeling that living things were moving
beneath the obscurity. A dog barked in the distance, and then left
off.</p>

<p>Alice leaned on the window-sill and looked out. The perfume of
spring flowers and the strange complexity of scents which
characterize the living land reached them. Down in the garden a
cricket chirped, and things rustled in fitful starts and then were
silent.</p>

<p>Suddenly it seemed to become stiller. There was nothing but the
solemn immensity of the night, the vast illimitable dome of
gleaming mystery. And then&mdash;</p>

<p>"ch'k, ch'k, ch'k."</p>

<p>Low down, as if in some hedge, came the first wary notes of the
night-bird, as though he was attuning his voice to the mellow
symphony of the night. Then came a silence, as though the night
were listening, or perhaps an invisible orchestra was recalling the
opening phrase away up among the stars where mortals could not hear
it.</p>

<p>And then, high up and away&mdash;or was it near at hand? one
could not tell the place from whence it came&mdash;the full beauty
of the song broke forth, rich and full and tender, rising and
falling, but ever in rhythm with the pulse of darkness. Plaintive
and melancholy, but bringing a message of hope and pity, it became
less like a song than like the spirit of the night expressing
itself in melody in one's heart, something elusive and
intangible.</p>

<p>He looked at the girl as she stood there gazing upwards. Her
lips were slightly parted and her expression was one of awe and
wonder. She did not stir. She seemed to dread lest any movement of
her own might break the spell, that a word might bring
disenchantment to the splendor of the night.</p>

<p>They were like two worshippers in the dim recesses of a vast
cathedral, hushed and reverent, and finding joy in the solemn
communion.</p>

<p>And suddenly she slipped her arm confidingly through his and
looked at him, and her eyes were shining with tears.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII&mdash;LOVE AMONG THE TOMBSTONES</h2>

<p>"The old wreck of an automobile" made rapid and sure progress.
It lapped up miles of country, like a thirsty carter. And other
things more nearly concerning the emotions also made progress
toward their predestined end. It was strange that Leslie did not
see the danger of this sentimental pilgrimage. He was, perhaps, too
happy, too much in love with the genial aspects of friendship and
beauty, and the never-ending revelations of this amazing stuff
called life.</p>

<p>He would come across his sister and his friend strolling arm in
arm through the garden of an inn, and he would say:</p>

<p>"Now then, you two; flirting again!"</p>

<p>But it seemed very natural to him. Alice had been to a
co-educational college; young men didn't make her feel
self-conscious. Arthur was his friend, and it was a great joy that
Alice had taken to him. They were great pals. Besides, there could
be no question or anything else. Arthur was married, and that was
the end of it. Alice was not quite twenty and Arthur was
thirty-two. This, also, gave her the natural right to treat him in
a sisterly way, as, for instance, when he discovered them that
night in the room of an inn in Hampshire, standing arm in arm, like
two children, listening to a nightingale.</p>

<p>"The Babes in the Wood" he called them, although on that night
he fully appreciated the nocturne of their mutual enjoyment. He
talked about the nightingale's song for days, and said it was
"really very impressive." He tried to analyze exactly what it was
the nightingale did, and why it sang at night, but he found the
others somewhat unresponsive in this discussion.</p>

<p>He vaguely wondered once or twice why Arthur didn't talk more
about his wife. He could understand that she might not want to make
the trip; some women were such home-birds, and she had those three
children to occupy her. But he liked Edith; he took to her on the
occasion of his visit when he found Arthur away. He told Alice that
he considered her "a strong, capable, and very beautiful woman." He
admired the way she moved about, and gave them clear, precise
information about Arthur's movements and locality. And he liked the
way she listened.</p>

<p>"Very few people know how to listen intently and intelligently,"
he observed.</p>

<p>The arrangement was that they were to spend a month in England,
and then to continue their trip for another two months on the
continent, visiting France, the Austrian Tyrol, and Italy, and were
to return to California in July.</p>

<p>When the last week of the English trip arrived they found
themselves in Norfolk. Leslie said:</p>

<p>"Now see here, Gaff, you'd better make your plans and trot along
with us to France."</p>

<p>Arthur answered dolefully that he was afraid he wouldn't be able
to arrange it. He must be getting on with his work, and there were
all sorts of reasons. And Leslie remarked:</p>

<p>"I know; he's homesick. Poor little boy!"</p>

<p>And then he had a brilliant idea:</p>

<p>"Why not go back and fix it up with the wife, and bring her,
too?"</p>

<p>But to this idea, also, there appeared to be vague and dubious
objections. As the day of parting began to draw near, a gloom began
to creep over the small party. It started with Alice, spread to
Arthur, and curiously enough became most pronounced in the
impressionable Leslie.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully put out that you won't join us, Gaff," he kept
repeating, and he lumbered through the interior of Norwich
Cathedral as though he were visiting a mausoleum destined to
contain his own bones.</p>

<p><br>
On the night before they returned to London they put up at the
village of Heynsham, and after dinner Arthur and Alice went for a
casual stroll together through the village. This was according to a
habit which had developed during the previous three weeks. There
was an old church surrounded by a sea of tombstones which looked
very desolate in the moonlight, and their footsteps seemed drawn
toward it. They went slowly along a winding path among the tombs
till they came to a little stile that led to a deserted-looking
road around a coppice. At the stile they rested, and Alice perched
herself upon it. Arthur stood beside her and gazed at the
tombstones, as though fascinated by their appeal. They were silent
for some time, and then Alice said:</p>

<p>"Death is a terrible thing, death and parting. It all seems so
cruel."</p>

<p>And Arthur replied:</p>

<p>"It is love alone which makes it cruel."</p>

<p>And he took her hand and held it to his brow, and dared not look
at her.</p>

<p>"In the alchemy of nature it seems to me that there are terrible
lapses, mistakes. There are so many things that give the illusion
of love."</p>

<p>He looked up at her and noticed that she was breathing quickly.
Her eyes looked drawn and anxious. She passed her hand through his
hair and said:</p>

<p>"Arthur, are you unhappy?"</p>

<p>And he gripped her hand more tightly and kissed it, and muttered
with a sob:</p>

<p>"O God!"</p>

<p>She took her hand away, as though staggered by the realization
of the immensity of the sudden great forces that were at work
beneath these fragmentary words of theirs. She said:</p>

<p>"O Arthur, this is&mdash;awful."</p>

<p>They looked into each other's eyes dim with tears, and she
gasped breathlessly:</p>

<p>"Arthur, it's no use pretending. You and I&mdash;We mustn't go
on like this; we simply <i>mustn't</i>. I was a fool to come to
Europe. But I don't know how it was; when I was a little girl and
you played with me in Paris, I made a sort of niche for you. That's
what Leslie meant. They call you my 'saint.' I thought of you, and
thought and thought. And suddenly this year I thought of you more
desperately. I wanted to see you again. That's why I came. I called
it 'wanderlust,' but it was you I wanted to see. It was madness. I
knew that you were married, but I didn't think about you in that
way. I just wanted to see you again, to hear you talk, to know that
you were still my saint up there in the niche. And you came down
and touched my hand, and we went along the road and heard the
nightingale, and things went tearing through my heart. It was all
wonderful! And I will go back and dream of these days and nights
forever."</p>

<p>He kissed her cheeks which were damp with tears, and he
said:</p>

<p>"Alice! Oh, my dear, what is to be done? I am desperate and
desolate. When I think of your departure I cannot face the
future."</p>

<p>"You will have to face the future, Arthur."</p>

<p>"How is one to tell?" he cried despairingly. "How can youth
tell? There are all these other things that have the illusion of
love. Youth grasps them and finds too late that they are illusory.
A saint? What strange trick of nature is this that, through the
fragrant purity of your soul, sees in me a saint! Alice, I am
vicious and weak and stained with all the dreary ugliness of the
world. I have struggled and given way, fought and been defeated.
What makes you see me as a saint?"</p>

<p>She slipped down from the stile and came very near him. Looking
into his eyes, she said softly:</p>

<p>"Only this. If I were alone with you to-night, I would trust you
with my soul."</p>

<p>He gave a little sob and groped for her hands again. He kissed
them and murmured:</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, my dear!"</p>

<p>"Listen, Arthur," she said again. "I want to help you. All these
things you tell me don't count very much. You want believing in. Do
you understand! I know you. Deep down you are a saint; you have the
sacrificial spirit. All these other things that splash you as they
pass, they do not touch you, the real you, the you that lies so
deep and silent. Oh, let me look at your dear eyes again!"</p>

<p>She held him apart, and he gave a little cry, as though he
wanted to draw her to him. She whispered:</p>

<p>"You'll think of me, Arthur, not only in the future, but now.
You won't make it too difficult for me?"</p>

<p>"No, no," he muttered hoarsely. "It is only that I am jealous of
you, I think. I am jealous of the young life in you. I see you here
within reach of my arms, and your face is only lighted by the
stars. The stars have an unerring way of stating things, and the
young life in you is laid bare. That is the difference between us.
It is more difficult for you now, and will be more difficult for me
in the days to come. For me it is the end, but for you it is the
beginning. In some strange way I have cast a spell over you. You
think you love me, but the day will come when you will find this to
be an illusion, as I found illusion when I was your age. For me
there will be no more illusion. I shall grope on, haunted by the
vision of 'that other one' who will one day take the place I madly
dreamed of. And Alice, much as it tortures me, I'm glad the stars
are never wrong. You will be happy, and you will one day come and
tell me."</p>

<p>And then she gave a cry and threw her arms round him.</p>

<p>"No, no," she sobbed. "I can't let you go like that. It isn't
true. There will never be anyone else. Arthur, you mustn't believe
that. Oh, my dear, the world will be all empty and dark without
you, empty and dark for ever and ever."</p>

<p>The night was very still, and on the other side of the coppice a
peewit uttered his plaintive warning of coming rain. The silhouette
of the old church stood out impressively against the night sky, and
the air was laden with the perfume of spring blossoms.</p>

<p>Ecstasy, fear, and temptation rioted in the veins of the young
man. Visions of dazzling days and nights danced before his eyes.
The re-awakening! The dynamic instincts of creative man! Joy and
hope surging toward the splendid threshold of the unborn! To live
again, to be born again, to look once more through the portals of
youth into the realms of everlasting beauty!</p>

<p>The peewit went shrieking across the path, flying very low.
To-night the sky was dear; to-morrow would come the rain. And
yet&mdash;</p>

<p>The child had said "the you that lies so deep and silent."</p>

<p>The affair would not be difficult of accomplishment; he had the
power to persuade her. They could simply go off suddenly, leaving a
letter for poor old Leslie. He pictured the expression on her
brother's face when he read it. It would be terrible. He would
either cry, or kill some one. But by the time they met again he
would have gotten over it. He would consider it regretable, but in
his inmost heart, "mighty interesting."</p>

<p>It wasn't Leslie who would count in this affair; it was the
girl.</p>

<p>He couldn't fool himself, or misread the unerring message of the
stars upon her child-face. He could sink low, but he could not sear
that "something deep and silent within him" by an everlasting
outrage.</p>

<p>He kissed her cheek once more, and felt her lips tremulously
quivering against his chin. And then he gripped her arm and
said:</p>

<p>"Let us go, then."</p>

<p>She sighed, and they went in silence past the tombstones and
back to the inn.</p>

<p>It was getting late, and as they came through the yard at the
back she suddenly stopped him. She placed a hand on either side of
his cheeks and looked at his eyes, and she said in a whisper:</p>

<p>"I knew that you were my saint"</p>

<p>He looked at her strained eyes, but he could not answer.
Something within him seemed to be choking and he wanted to be
despairingly alone, to be able to wrestle with his own
wretchedness. When they arrived at the inn Alice ran straight
upstairs, but Leslie came out of the smoking-room where he had been
cross-examining a commercial traveler upon his methods of doing
business. He called out:</p>

<p>"Hullo, Gaff, I've been looking for you. A telegram came for you
just as you went out."</p>

<p>They went along together to the office, Arthur remarking that
"it was a gorgeous night." They handed him the telegram and he
opened it. It ran:</p>

<p>"Advise return immediately. Mrs. Gaffyn very ill."</p>

<p>It was signed "Beggs," which was the name of the
housekeeper.</p>

<p>It is impossible to analyze the complexity of virtuous and
vicious impulses which stir in the human heart. At least, if it is
not impossible to analyze them, it is impossible to tell which way
they will jump when acted upon by some sudden and unexpected
phenomena. Does it not seem inconsistent, for instance, that
Arthur, who a few minutes previously had been accentuated by an
idealistic conception of behavior, should suddenly experience an
almost fiendish wave of hope that some one who was very dear to
him, and who had been loyal and passionately loving to him, should
die? It was, perhaps, not so much a hope, as a sudden vision that
Edith might die, and his mind was more actively engaged with the
result of this calamity than with the fact itself. If Edith should
die?</p>

<p>He showed the telegram to Leslie and said:</p>

<p>"I must catch the first train in the morning."</p>

<p>And Leslie said:</p>

<p>"My! this is bad news! Lordy! I am sorry, Gaff, old man. But why
wait till the morning? We can dig out the old automobile, and get
Raikes to run you up tonight."</p>

<p>It had not occurred to Arthur that this was possible. He
said:</p>

<p>"But how will you manage? There's no station here, or
anything."</p>

<p>And Leslie put his hand on his shoulder and answered:</p>

<p>"That won't cut any ice, old man. He can come back for us. I'll
go dig him out."</p>

<p>In an hour's time Arthur found himself speeding on the way to
London, his mind dazed by varying emotions. The chauffeur was no
good in the dark, and lost his way many times, but eventually they
arrived in London at half-past five. He drove straight to St.
John's Wood. A nurse opened the door. She glanced at him and
said:</p>

<p>"She's doing as well as can be expected. She has double
pneumonia. It's a serious case."</p>

<p>In the drawing-room he found Aunt Elizabeth sleeping on a sofa.
She awakened and kissed him, and said:</p>

<p>"My poor dear! She's very low, Arthur, very low indeed. They say
it's touch and go. You can go up and see her, but she won't know
you, Arthur. She's unconscious. She's been unconscious for twelve
hours. Oh, dear! we've had a dreadful time. We have two doctors and
two nurses night and day. She caught it doing this slumming work in
the East End. Got wet through, and sat in her wet clothes all the
afternoon helping a mechanic's wife who nearly died giving birth to
a child."</p>

<p>"How long has she been ill?"</p>

<p>"Let's see. Friday&mdash;Monday&mdash;Tuesday night. Nearly ten
days."</p>

<p>"But why didn't they send for me before?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know, my dear, Edith's so funny about that! only
heard three days ago when she was getting worse, quite by chance.
She said they weren't to bother people, and she kept on giving
particular instructions that they were not to send for you. Those
were almost her last words before she lost consciousness. And then
it grew so serious I told Mrs. Beggs she'd better do so. How did
you comet. Are your feet wet?"</p>

<p>Arthur went upstairs and beheld his wife lying on her back,
breathing desperately. The nurse hovered near the bed. The doctor
had called at twelve o'clock and was expected again at six.
Everything possible was being done.</p>

<p>Arthur washed himself and then sat in a chair by the fireplace,
listening to the terrifying breathing of his wife. His heart was
torn by pity and remorse.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV&mdash;TOUCH AND
GO</h2>

<p>It was, indeed, as Aunt Elizabeth said, an affair of touch and
go. On the following night the crisis came, and the doctor appeared
anxious and summoned his consultant. They spent some time together,
and came out of the room looking very grave. Everybody went about
the house on tiptoe, and Arthur would not go to bed. He sat there
dazed, looking at the others and gripping the arms of his chair in
agony. The children were sent across the way to a friend's, and
Eleanor called with her husband. She kissed him and cried
convulsively. Late in the evening Leslie appeared alone. They had
just arrived in town. He said that Alice was resting; she had sent
her love. He looked terribly concerned. He wandered about the
house, holding his long arms in front of him, as though he were
offering himself for any sort of service. He kept patting Arthur's
shoulder and saying:</p>

<p>"There, there, dear old man! It'll come out all right! You'll
see!"</p>

<p>He disappeared later, as though he could not stand the strain.
Arthur sat on, enduring the agony of the struggle. About dawn he
dozed a little, and once the nurse awakened him and said in an awed
voice:</p>

<p>"I think you had better go into the next room."</p>

<p>She seemed frightened of his presence and the effect that
certain developments might have on him. But he answered like a
drunken man:</p>

<p>"It's all right, nurse."</p>

<p>In the morning he fainted, and they carried him into the next
room. When he came to, he noticed a slightly different expression
on the nurse's face. She said:</p>

<p>"I think it's going better. I think it's more hopeful."</p>

<p>The doctor came at seven and verified the statement. All day
long people came and went, moving softly. In the evening the doctor
came to see him, and gave him something in a glass to drink. He
touched his shoulder and said:</p>

<p>"It's going to be all right."</p>

<p>Arthur went back in a dazed condition to his wife's bedroom. The
breathing was less terrible, but again he sat there through the
night.</p>

<p>On the following day the doctor smiled for the first time, and
said:</p>

<p>"I think we may say that the crisis has passed."</p>

<p>On the afternoon of that day Arthur slept soundly for the first
time in three days. When he awakened at ten o'clock at night he
found Aunt Elizabeth in the room.</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>"Well, my dear. Thank God! She's beginning to recover
consciousness."</p>

<p>Arthur said "Thank God!" and slept again.</p>

<p>About five o'clock he awakened, feeling refreshed. He went into
Edith's room. She was sleeping. He sat looking at her. After a time
she opened her eyes and gazed at him. She looked at him dreamily,
and then closed her eyes and gave her head a little shake, as
though dismissing a foolish illusion. He went up to the bed and
kissed her brow, but she moved restlessly, as though disturbed by
disquieting dreams, and he left the room.</p>

<p><br>
As the days went by a furtive passage of glances took place between
them.</p>

<p>With her strong constitution and her determined will, Edith soon
seemed to control the vacillating spirits of disease. She lay there
without speaking, but alert and conscious, doing the right thing
for her body. When Arthur came near her she seemed a little
disturbed, as though struggling to control herself more completely.
When he kissed her she responded dreamily.</p>

<p>On the fifth day of her recovery he was standing by the
fireplace, when she said in a matter-of-fact way:</p>

<p>"You've come back, then, Arthur."</p>

<p>He came nearer to the bed, and answered:</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>He wanted to say more, to explain himself more completely, but
he doubted whether she were fit to suffer emotion and he did not
quite know how much she understood. He added weakly:</p>

<p>"Can I get you anything?"</p>

<p>She shook her head and looked away.</p>

<p>At the end of a fortnight she was sitting up, and Leslie and
Alice had gone off to France. He had not seen Alice since the night
at Heynsham.</p>

<p>He went back to his work, and it was during that month that he
completed the second volume of "The Fugitive Philosopher."</p>

<p>At the end of May the doctor said that Edith must go away and be
braced up. The obvious place was Bodiesham. It was furnished and
ready, and the housekeeper was still there. He hired a car and they
drove down all the way, and for some reason persuaded Aunt
Elizabeth to accompany them.</p>

<p>The month of June was glorious, and in the light sea-breezes
Edith rapidly regained her strength. Arthur worked and went for
walks about the country, and found it peopled with images of Alice.
He saw her standing on an elevation among the dunes, the wind
blowing strands of hair across her face. He visited the field where
the daffodils had made her cry with delight. They were all dead
now, and there was an emptiness in the meadows near Lenby.</p>

<p>Leslie wrote to him and kept him in touch with their movements,
but there was no word from his sister. In his heart he followed
them to Paris and to Basle, and all through Switzerland and the
Tyrol. Her eyes would come between him and the sheets in front of
him, and he would think:</p>

<p>"Where is she now? What is she doing? Is she thinking of me? Is
she happy? Is she unhappy? Has she already met 'that other
one'?"</p>

<p>And at night he would sit alone on the veranda of his father's
house and dream of her. He would suffer agonies of apprehension
lest something terrible had happened to her&mdash;an accident amid
the Alps, typhoid fever through drinking impure water, a railway
smash. And yet, what was it all to him? He would never see her
again. She had gone, passed out of his life forever. But he could
not face the grim certainty of it. He tried to visualize the joy
and happiness that would come to her when she did, indeed, find
"that other one." But the vision was more disturbing than the
certainty of separation.</p>

<p>He could see her on the steps of another veranda in California,
perhaps with children climbing round her knees, and she would start
with tremulous joy when she heard the approaching footsteps of that
man whom Arthur tried not to hate with unreasonable venom. And on
some occasion, in the dim seclusion of the house, she would tell
him about Arthur. Then the boy, with the supercilious superiority
of youth and possession, would grin and say:</p>

<p>"Poor old chap!"</p>

<p>And he would kiss her pity out of her.</p>

<p><br>
By the end of the month Edith became her normal self, and Aunt
Elizabeth returned to town. Edith could walk and work, and she
seemed happy and contented again, but anxious to get back to the
children, or to have them down there. They did not speak of
intimate things. There was a sort of mutual unexpressed
understanding between them that somehow the center of their
affections had shifted. The difference in their ages seemed more
emphasized, and Edith returned to her earlier attitude of mothering
indulgence. She never disagreed with him or interfered with any of
his inclinations, but her actions seemed more passive and detached.
He felt, in a way, a little frightened of her and her calm
reserve.</p>

<p>On the third of July there came a cable from Leslie from
Bordighera. It read:</p>

<p>"Arriving London eighth. Leaving for States fourteenth."</p>

<p>When Edith read this cable she said:</p>

<p>"Oh, wouldn't it be jolly to ask them to spend their last few
days here!"</p>

<p>Arthur looked at her, but her face gave no indication of any
feeling other than that of a well-bred hostess suggesting the right
thing.</p>

<p>Arthur carried the cablegram crumpled up in his trousers' pocket
all day. Occasionally he took it out and looked at it. Early the
next morning he sent this reply:</p>

<p>"Wife and I delighted if you will come Bodiesham on eighth till
departure."</p>

<p>He lived in a state of fever for the next three days, when
another cable said:</p>

<p>"Delighted to accept kind invitation."</p>

<p>On the evening of the eighth "the old wreck of an automobile"
once more made its appearance in Bodiesham, delivering its two
travelers safely at the gate of the bungalow. Leslie started a long
apology for not cabling before. It appeared to be Alice's fault.
She was like all women, with the obvious exception of Mrs. Gaffyn,
he was sure; they simply could not make up their minds. Alice had
wanted to go to Oxford and Chester and some other old places they
had missed. She was insatiable; she had run him off his feet this
trip. The next time he came to Europe he was going to bring a
bagful of monkeys with him; they would be more restful. She had
nearly killed him climbing inaccessible peaks in the Tyrol; he
would be glad to lock her up in the cabin of the steamer; and so
on.</p>

<p>When they sat down to dinner they were all extremely garrulous,
with the exception of Arthur. Leslie naturally was so, and Alice
and Edith adopted it in a wildly defensive sort of manner. Edith
surprised him. She appeared to be under the stress of a great and
pleasurable excitement in meeting these two. She had travelled a
good deal herself, and the recent tour of their guests supplied a
topic of conversation that was by no means exhausted when they left
on the thirteenth.</p>

<p>Alice was extremely entertaining. With her keen powers of
observation, her apt way of expressing things, and her sense of
fun, she gave many pungent descriptions of their adventures which
kept them all in a genial state of laughter. And Arthur laughed,
too. He could not help it, although his heart was aching. She was
so young and fresh and buoyant, so redolent of the joyous things of
"the young life."</p>

<p>And he kept thinking to himself:</p>

<p>"How beautiful she is! I did not think before about her beauty.
I only thought of her as 'my Alice'; all the dear tones of her
voice that seem created for me, that mean things only to me. She is
blushing now, and I know she thinks she loves me. And so, indeed,
she does. But youth will trample on that. She has the inexhaustible
fount. Oh, youth is cruel, cruel, cruel! Youth has its own game to
play, and will be served. Nothing can stand against youth. Don't be
a fool! Don't be a fool!"</p>

<p>After dinner they all sat out on the veranda, and there was no
opportunity of talking to Alice alone. She would give him quick
little pleading glances, and sometimes an expression would come to
her face, a little pucker of the brow, a strained look like that
which came to her in Heynsham churchyard when she said:</p>

<p>"O Arthur, this is&mdash;awful."</p>

<p>It was not till the following afternoon that he secured a few
words alone with her. They all walked across the dunes to the sea,
and Alice and Arthur soon took the lead. When they were a hundred
yards ahead, he whispered:</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>And the tones of her voice attuned to his as she answered:</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, it's been dreadful. I wanted you horribly. But you
mustn't talk to me now, or I shall cry, or do something awful. We
ought not to have come. It's only going to make it worse."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you write to me, Alice!"</p>

<p>"I was frightened. I wrote to you several times, and tore up the
letters. It seemed so mean. I could only write to you in one way,
and I'd no right to."</p>

<p>"You received mine?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I couldn't have lived without them, but I was
terrified lest Leslie should see them. I read him little bits, and
then burnt them. If he were not such an innocent babe, he could
have told everything by my manner. But O Arthur, you ought not to
have written me like that. Your letters went right through me. You
ought not to write to me, but you <i>must</i>. I shall give you an
address in Los Angeles where you must write me often and tell me
everything, every little thing about yourself. Your letters will be
the only thing I have."</p>

<p>"And you will write to me?"</p>

<p>"Yes; only let me write to your club, or somewhere. It's
frightfully wicked, but I can't lose you altogether. Do you know
what you are! You're just my unsatisfied longing! I used to long
for you in Italy, and in Switzerland. I longed for you in the
morning and the afternoon and the night, especially at night when I
was tired. I used to think how much more beautiful everything would
have been if you had been there to share it. When we saw anything
particularly beautiful I thought of you at once, and then I longed
and longed, and I knew it was no good. I used to cry at night
sometimes, and then scold myself. Do you think I'm terribly
wicked!"</p>

<p>He glanced at her fair face as she frowned perplexedly at the
vision of the sea. And he smiled grimly and answered:</p>

<p>"Yes. You're a terrible adventuress!"</p>

<p>She shook her head and whispered:</p>

<p>"You mustn't laugh at me, Arthur. It is wicked, you know. I
sometimes wonder and wonder what there can be about me that you
find to love. You're so wonderful and clever. You have everything,
and I'm just a child."</p>

<p>And he said hoarsely:</p>

<p>"If you talk like that, I shall suddenly take hold of you and
kiss you in front of the others. Oh, you darling!"</p>

<p>She blushed, but her eyes shone.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake! don't do anything mad, dear."</p>

<p>As they came round a slope and upon the foreshore, she suddenly
clutched his arm and cried excitedly:</p>

<p>"Look! look!"</p>

<p>Two yachts were manoeuvering within half a mile of the shore.
They looked splendid scudding before the wind, their white sails
striking a note of gaiety upon the luminous expanse of sparkling
water.</p>

<p>"That is what I envy," Arthur thought as he observed her eyes
reflecting the sudden vision. "She has the genius of youth. She can
destroy in a flash the solemn bickerings of regret. She is the
medium of nature. Nature will play upon her in this way until the
impressions and visions increase and increase, and then there will
be nothing left of the old regret. She will rise, a new and
beautiful phoenix from the ashes of this miserable romance. What
troubles me is that, blindly as I love her, I cannot help envying
her. Why should I envy her f I have had my youth."</p>

<p>They sat on the shore and threw pebbles, and Edith and Leslie
joined them. Leslie was giving Edith a concise precis of the manner
of conducting the tomato industry in Southern California, an
industry in which he and some of his family apparently had a
commercial interest. When he observed the yachts, his mind
immediately flew to the American Cup Races, and he said that over
in the States "Sir Thomas Lipton was held to be a good sportsman,
and everybody wanted him to win."</p>

<p>Despite his affection for him, there were moments when Arthur
felt that Leslie was an unconscionable bore. He would give slow and
deliberate dissertations on all sorts of subjects, expecting the
others to be as interested as he; and in the meantime the precious
moments were slipping by.</p>

<p>In this respect he had to acknowledge that Edith behaved
extremely well. She seemed to go out of her way to take him off
their hands, and during the next two days they found several
opportunities for roaming off together.</p>

<p><br>
During the evening of the following day, just before dinner, they
went up into the pine-wood behind the house and were lost to sight.
They sat upon the moss-grown stump of an old tree, very close
together, and he kissed her hands. After a silence she
whispered:</p>

<p>"Tell me. What are you thinking of?"</p>

<p>And he groaned:</p>

<p>"I'm counting the hours. There are seventy-three left, and
then&mdash;"</p>

<p>She pinched the tips of his fingers and said:</p>

<p>"Arthur, dear, you simply <i>mustn't</i> look at it like that.
We'll be back some day very soon; you see if we don't. And now,
tell me about your work. What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, grub along and do things that nobody wants."</p>

<p>"That isn't true; you know that people want them. You are one of
the rare ones; you have the power of creation. It's the most
precious gift in the world. Think of all you can do to help. More
and more people want help. You must dip into yourself and produce
the things that help them."</p>

<p>"Like that wretched play that will never stop running."</p>

<p>"O fugitive philosopher, how can you say that! You know that
what matters is that you are true to yourself. I'm going to work
hard, too. When I get through this physics business I'm going to
take up medicine. It's all we can do, Arthur&mdash;just push along
and help people. I can help a little bit in my material way with
medicines and advice. I think I ought to have a good bedside
manner, don't you? But you&mdash;you can help so much more. You can
help spiritually. You can help to shape things, give form and
thought and poignancy to the most matter-of-fact existences; show
people how to think and live and appreciate beauty. What does it
matter if some of them jeer at you, or trample on your work! What
matters is that those for whom your message is intended will know
you by your work. Do you ever walk along a crowded street and look
at the faces, and suddenly you look into one pair of eyes, and you
don't quite know what happens, but you are conscious that in some
way life is a finer thing than it was before! Those who have the
great secret know each other in a crowd."</p>

<p>He looked at this strange child who talked so wisely, and used
such simple phrases, and he said:</p>

<p>"With you; yes, yes, with you."</p>

<p>He couldn't exactly formulate what he wanted to say, but he
stroked her hand and managed to add in a low voice:</p>

<p>"You'll always believe in me, Alice. I know that. It will help
me to go on. It is only through the eyes of women that men
accomplish things of beauty, and yours are the most beautiful eyes
in the world. Yours are the eyes that Shelley must have dreamed of
and Leonardo painted, but which Napoleon would not have understood.
Strange! as I talk to you, I seem to realize the
cleavage&mdash;creation and destruction. The world has so far been
ruled by the destroyers, by the old, by the tyrant, but the day of
youth is dawning."</p>

<p>They were silent, and then he continued dreamily:</p>

<p>"I promise you I will go on. I shall always think of you.
Perhaps when I am no longer dazzled by the contact of your
presence, you will help me the more. You make me feel strong and
virile. It's a big thing to feel, this great glow of life passing
all around one, and to know that, for good or evil, one influences
it. I sometimes think of the million, million unborn children whose
happiness we hold in the hollow of our hands. Yes, yes, one can do
that, be an influence, help to shape things."</p>

<p>"Oh, Arthur, I shall be so happy if you'll promise me that."</p>

<p>He pressed her hand and rose. As they came through the wood she
smiled and said:</p>

<p>"Even if you're not a saint, it would be so easy to make you
one. You just want a little managing. I think I would throw you in
the deep and make you strike out for yourself."</p>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV&mdash;THE DUST OP THE SEA</h2>

<p>When the day of parting dawned, the elements adapted themselves
to the gloom of this event in a portentous manner, for it rained
heavily and a cold wind blew from the east. In the morning they all
went out for a walk in mackintoshes. The two younger members
managed to scramble ahead of the others and to carry on a
breathless and scrappy dialogue with the rain beating their
faces.</p>

<p>"Only five hours more!"</p>

<p>"Five hours and seventeen minutes!"</p>

<p>"I will spare you the seventeen minutes to pack and dress. For
the rest, you must keep near me and let me gaze at you."</p>

<p>"Arthur, you're simply shameless."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"It's the way you look at me. Surely the others can read your
eyes."</p>

<p>"What does it matter? People never begrudge a meal to a man who
is just going to be executed."</p>

<p>"But you're not going to be executed. You're only going to be
left behind."</p>

<p>"I love you."</p>

<p>"And you made a promise."</p>

<p>"Which I shall keep. Only, while we walk along like this for the
last time, I want to keep on whispering, 'Alice, I love you.' I
want to impress you on the air. When you have gone I shall come out
here sometimes for walks alone with you. I want the sea and the
sand and the gorse and these slabs of stone to bear witness; then
when I whisper, 'Alice, I love you,' they will understand and be
sympathetic."</p>

<p>"And as I walk the deck of the steamer, I will accompany you. I
will look at the sea and I will think, 'It's the same dear sea that
he is looking at, and he loves me.' There! are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>"For one of the precious moments, yes. You are a darling!"</p>

<p>"When will you write to me?"</p>

<p>"I will write to-night; you will get a letter on the steamer at
Liverpool. And then you will not hear for three weeks."</p>

<p>"You have not told me where to write you."</p>

<p>"Oh, write to 'The Old Guys Club, Adelphi.' No; I had forgotten;
not there. I will send you an address to-night."</p>

<p>"You are going to work and win out. I shall be so proud of
you."</p>

<p>"Anything I do will be because of you."</p>

<p>"And no one will ever know. I suppose there are thousands of
people like that, who have some dear and wonderful secret that
helps them on, and the world never knows."</p>

<p>"They're calling us to go back to lunch."</p>

<p>"And to waste another of the hours."</p>

<p>"Not quite; I can sit opposite you at lunch and watch you."</p>

<p>"Like an open book. Or rather, like an open newspaper with
flaming headlines: 'I Love You. Romantic Affair in South
England.'"</p>

<p>The rain stung their faces and the keen air braced their nerves.
They were both young, and they laughed in the face of their
impending doom.</p>

<p>At lunch-time Leslie said:</p>

<p>"Well now, if you good people would only come over to our side,
we'd give you the time of your lives. You'd just love California,
Mrs. Gaffyn; the scenery is wonderful and the climate makes you
want to jump around like a cat. Why not come over and spend a
summer with us?"</p>

<p>Edith smiled and said:</p>

<p>"It would be delightful; it's very kind of you to suggest it.
I'm afraid&mdash;you see, I have the children to consider." Then
she paused, and added:</p>

<p>"I don't see why Arthur shouldn't go."</p>

<p>Arthur glanced at his wife and a curious little wave of fear
swept over him. He could not account for it; he could not foresee
any reason for fear of any sort. It was like a subconscious warning
of some impending calamity that he had no reason to expect, and yet
which chilled him with its insidious touch.</p>

<p>Leslie said:</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I'm sorry; I suppose that is so. Well, if Arthur
would come along, we'd look out for him."</p>

<p>But he seemed a little doubtful whether he ought to persuade
Arthur to make such a journey without his wife. He switched off
again into the glories of California, its eucalyptus trees, its
flowers and fruit and people and social life, till Alice pulled him
up with:</p>

<p>"In fact, everything except nightingales."</p>

<p>And then Arthur looked at her, and his eyes proclaimed the
flaming headlines. The car came for them at five o'clock, and
Arthur went with them as far as Lenby-Wodehurst, where they took
the train.</p>

<p><br>
The departure was like a dream. They huddled together silently in
the car, and Leslie shared their grief. He did not even seem to
notice that they sat holding each other's hands and looking out of
the window. When they arrived at the station there was little time
for weeping. As in a glass darkly, Arthur saw Leslie bustling about
calling out to porters, and Alice standing wrapped up in her
rain-proof cloak, with the collar touching the little pink lobes of
her ears. And he could see only her eyes through a mist and feel
the tremulous pressure of her hands. As the train came thundering
in, Leslie gripped his hand and said to Alice:</p>

<p>"Kiss him good-by."</p>

<p>She did so, and he stood there in a trance, with the magic of
that kiss tingling his cheeks and the vision of those eyes that
burnt him with their longing. Then she whispered:</p>

<p>"I am going to be so proud of you."</p>

<p>A clatter and roar, the shriek of a whistle, and the dream
vanished. But still he stood there, with the rain tempestuously
striving to wash away the imprint of that kiss. He laughed softly
at the foolhardy effort of the gods. No violent onslaught by any
combination of these cunning devices of nature should ever rob him
of the memory of that tender caress.</p>

<p>He walked out of the station and through the muddy streets of
Lenby. At the corner of Steed's meadow he called at a cottage where
an old farm laborer named Hilton lived by himself. He was an old
man who had lived in the cottage for twenty-two years, and Arthur
knew him well. He came to the door, and Arthur said:</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Hilton. Will you do me a favor! I may shut up
the bungalow and travel about. In any case, I want to know if you
will mind my letters being addressed to you here? I will call for
them; or if I am away, I will leave a covering envelope for you to
forward them. I will pay you for this."</p>

<p>Old Hilton looked at him meditatively and said:</p>

<p>"That'll be all right, sir."</p>

<p>Arthur proffered him half a crown, but he shook his head:</p>

<p>"There be no call for that, sir. Thank 'e kindly. I'm always
pleased to oblige folk."</p>

<p>Arthur said:</p>

<p>"It's very kind of you, Mr. Hilton. Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night, sir."</p>

<p>He walked across the meadows and came out upon the dunes. It was
getting dark and the sea was roaring dully. He walked toward it, as
though he had an urgent message; and so, indeed, he had. He stood
upon a little hillock and murmured:</p>

<p>"Alice, Alice!"</p>

<p>Gulls went shrieking overhead, and the murmur of the sea struck
a note of perpetuity.</p>

<p>He stood there a long time, aware of the vibrant forces of
Nature around him and curiously intent on his own place in this
setting.</p>

<p>"No one has ever been able to think these things out properly,"
he mused at length. He felt strangely incomplete, as though a great
part of him had been cut away and the other part was trying to find
itself. It was at present being blown about, with its face washed
by the salt rain.</p>

<p>"That's what we all came from, according to Darwin," he
reflected at random. "The dust of the sea!"</p>

<p>He tried to think about "the dust of the sea," but another
phrase seemed more pertinent and elbowed its way to the fore.</p>

<p>"They who have the great secret know each other in a crowd."</p>

<p>Yes, it was very evident; he would have to start all over again,
grimly and earnestly. He had made a terrible blunder. He had fallen
in love with a young girl with whom he had no right to fall in
love. She had gobbled him up, as it were, body and soul, and there
was only this little part of him left. What was he to do with it?
The salient features of the case were two. First, she would get
over it; she would get over it quite quickly and fall in love with
some one else. Of that he was perfectly certain. The second feature
was that he wouldn't get over it. For him it was the end, except
for that one little part of him which stood gasping on the sand.
And, concerning that, he had made a definite promise. He had
promised her that he would go on. That was the most important thing
in the world, the thing to cling to&mdash;his promise to her. For
that was the little part of her that he could always keep.</p>

<p>His case was so desperate that he had come down here to try and
find himself. If it had not been for his promise, this little part
of him might easily be thrown away. It could go out now, for
instance, straight into those breakers, and beyond them to where
the current was very strong, bearing down the channel eastward.</p>

<p>But no, he couldn't do that; for Alice still held him by some
peculiar power, although at that moment she was racing away from
him in a train forever. Therefore he would have to make a
tremendous effort. He would have to key up this little part of him
into a living and interested force. Alice had said, "You have the
power to help spiritually, to shape things."</p>

<p>Yes, this very living agony would help him in that. From the
ashes of his grief he would be able to raise up images that, after
waiting, they who passed him in the crowd would understand. And of
those others who came after, they would know him less by what he
did than by the love that he imparted. He experienced a moment of
tranquillity.</p>

<p>"There will always be the sense of incompleteness that robs the
full hour of its splendor, but there will be moments of calm when I
shall find within myself the power to help others. A great
impersonal love. There is consolation in the very thought of
it."</p>

<p>He turned his footsteps in the direction of the pavilion.</p>

<p>"I must concentrate on what I am going to do for her sake," he
thought. "I must struggle to keep my mind attuned to the appeal
that springs perpetually from the memory of her image. It will be
terrible and cruel, the more terrible because now I can only see
all in rigid perspective. Alice vanishing forever, and then the
narrow way of my life that will begin again when I enter the
pavilion. Edith will be waiting for me. She will probably be
knitting or sewing. She will look up and say, 'Did you get your
feet wet, Arthur?' and then I shall change my boots and wash, and
get a book and sit down. And then we shall start our life again. In
a few days we shall go to London. I shall resume my work, and she
will be immersed in bringing up those children. And so it will go
on. One will accomplish a certain amount of work, and then one will
grow old, and eventually one will die, and&mdash;Q God! one will
have never known the complete hour!"</p>

<p>The rain blew in more tempestuous gusts. It was getting dark and
the pavilion looked a little ghost-like, with its white profile
somewhat blurred against the dark line of fir-trees. In the
L-shaped room with the veranda on the first floor, where they
principally lived, a vague light was burning.</p>

<p>"Edith has not lighted the large lamp," he thought</p>

<p>He plodded up the wet paths to the front door and let himself
in. He heard the housekeeper in the kitchen moving about near the
range. He took off his hat and mackintosh, changed his boots and
went upstairs.</p>

<p>The bungalow seemed curiously silent. He went quietly into the
sitting-room. He could not see his wife at first, for she was round
the angle of the room. But as he went forward he was conscious of
her sitting by the small lamp. For some reason or other he did not
go straight to her, but drifted to the window. He felt a little
impatient and irritable. He wanted her to say:</p>

<p>"Well, Arthur, did you get your feet wet?"</p>

<p>And then he could resume their normal companionship again, and
the big struggle would commence. He was anxious to begin the big
struggle.</p>

<p>He stood looking out of the window and noticing the fantastic
shapes of shrub and trees in the half-light. Suddenly it dawned
upon him that Edith had not spoken.</p>

<p>He looked across at her and to his surprise observed that,
although she was sitting near the lamp, she was not sewing, or
knitting, or reading. She was apparently just sitting there, with
her hands on her knees.</p>

<p>The light from the small lamp seemed to be flickering a little
uncertainly. And then it was that he was again assailed by the
chilling gusts of fear he had experienced earlier in the day. What
had happened? What was going to happen! Nothing could be more
terrible than the misery he was enduring, and yet something seemed
to tell him that it might be more feral, more wildly
unreasonable.</p>

<p>He was trying to raise himself above his sorrow, to assert the
little part of him that remained, but this instant mood of tragedy
that seemed to haunt the hollow spaces of the bungalow was
thrusting out its arms to pull him back.</p>

<p>He passed his hand across his brow, and said faintly:</p>

<p>"Can you see? Don't you want the big lamp?"</p>

<p>Edith did not answer. He walked across the room and looked at
her, and then she jumped up and seemed to slink back against the
wall. And when she looked at him her eyes were sunk in the dark
hollows of her face. He stood gazing at her and listening to the
wind moaning round the bungalow. When at last she spoke, her voice
sounded high, crueller than the wind, a disconnected thing blown
from some land where the sun never shines. She said:</p>

<p>"Well, you didn't go off with her, then?"</p>

<p>The unexpectedness of this statement lashed the strings of his
heart. For a moment his whole power of volition stopped. The
spectrum of his moral vision was broken into a discordant jumble of
colored lights. It was neither what he expected nor desired, and
yet it did suddenly release one ray of dazzling beauty&mdash;Alice
racing on her way to London and Liverpool, but still
accessible!</p>

<p>But he knew that he could never adjust the impulses of this
bright vision to the demands of concrete action. It was not for his
own sake, or for Edith's sake, that he had let Alice go.</p>

<p>At the same time he was intensely aware of an outraged sense. It
was not his idea of the way to begin the big struggle. In all these
years of their married life Edith had not once crossed him, had
never been angry with him, had humored him as a mother does a
spoilt son. And suddenly she turns and rends him with these
terrible tones of her voice, at the very instant when he has
resolved to be true and loyal to her, when he is going to make
amends. And she was saying other things, cruel and bitter things,
things that seemed so cruel and bitter that it required an effort
to understand them.</p>

<p>"You fool! do you think I couldn't see?"</p>

<p>And then something terrible and common-fibered:</p>

<p>"You, with your stupid ideas that I've put up with all this
time! All this highfalutin nonsense about ideals; and then you go
and make love to the first young girl you meet! Oh, I knew it would
come. I'm not a fool."</p>

<p>Suddenly she flung herself on a chair and buried her face in her
hands and sobbed.</p>

<p>"Oh, go! go!" she cried. "What is the good of pretending, you
and I?"</p>

<p>He saw her shoulders heaving, and in the dim light her hair
looked bedraggled and almost white. The reflection came to him that
the days were coming when her hair would be truly white and she
would sob alone in the darkness.</p>

<p>The moment when that common-fibered something in her had jarred
upon him gradually became diffused in a wondering pity. This woman
had given him her all, her love, her health, her strength, and her
life. And now for the first time she had flung her dignity to the
winds and was grovelling at his feet. She was a raw, naked bit of
herself, as he was, crying out for some light in the darkness. She
was crying shamelessly:</p>

<p>"I know you love her. I want you to love her. I knew this would
come, Arthur. I gambled on it. I have no right to stand in your
way. Listen!"</p>

<p>She suddenly stood up and swayed in his direction. She
nervelessly seized the lapels of his coat, and said:</p>

<p>"They don't sail from Liverpool till to-morrow. You still have
time. Go away with them. Go and live in America. Start your career
again. In a year or two marry her, and write and tell me you are
happy."</p>

<p>The monstrous offer of sacrifice came quivering from her lips,
the bitter renunciation of age to the bowels of youth. The cleavage
between their mental attitudes never seemed more definitely
declaimed. Despite her moral superiority, her sane and healthy
outlook, he saw her at that moment a thing of commoner clay than
himself. She had taken him when he was Alice's age, snatched the
best years of his life, aware of what would happen, and then
through cold-blooded reasoning bowed to the bitter inevitability.
He had given up Alice because Alice was intangible, a delicate
spring flower belonging to the spring, the predestined mate of some
other virginal blossom; and he could almost hear her whisper:</p>

<p>"I am going to be so proud of you!"</p>

<p>She was racing away now to where the sun shines on lake and
river and brilliant flowers, and where "the young life" may find
itself. And he was standing grimly in this dark bungalow on the
threshold of "the big struggle."</p>

<p>What more profitable beginning could be made than here in the
dark places of this woman's heart cowering before him? To set aside
all blame and regret, to look pity between the eyes and give it
your all because it needs it?</p>

<p>Suddenly he seized her shoulders, as he had that night when he
first asserted his power over her. Almost brutally he crushed her
to him and kissed her.</p>

<p>"Edith, I won't have this! Do you understand? We are all
assailed by these things at times. Who isn't? But you are my wife.
We've got to win through. I'm not going away. I'm going to stay
here with you. Do you hear what I say? We've got to help each
other. Kiss me; give me your lips!"</p>

<p>"No, no!"</p>

<p>When at last she hung helpless in his arms, their usual
relationship was somewhat reversed. It was he who fetched the
Chesterfield and made her put up her feet, and then he lighted the
fire and the large lamp. He ordered the housekeeper to cook the
supper, and afterward read to her and talked quite calmly of their
future plans. And when at night he had supplied her with hot
water-bottles and the other comforts a convalescent values, he lay
awake listening to her regular breathing.</p>

<p>The rain and wind had somewhat abated, and the martins were
silent under the eaves of his father's house.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI&mdash;KICKING THE SHAVINGS UNDER YOUR FEET</h2>

<p>In a small room at the top of a narrow building in Notting Hill,
an elderly, bearded man was poring over a drawing-board. The
building was owned by Messrs. Tonks &amp; Aiken, a firm of
decorators and builders in a moderate way of business. In truth,
Aiken was no more, but Tonks was an ambitious young man from
Lancashire, with unlimited "ideas" and very limited capital. He was
very proud of this little business, and particularly proud of the
fact that in the top room he kept a real designer of his own. There
was considerable romance about this designer, for he had been, and
still was, in Tonks's opinion, the greatest designer in England.
That he had been reduced to the position of working for Tonks was
due, in the first place, to the strange <i>dbcle</i> that had
occurred in the decorating world a few years previously. The firm
of Blinkinshaw &amp; Bepstow had "sacked" nearly everybody, and
other firms, finding that there was no need to keep up the high
standard which this firm had established, had "managed"&mdash;that
is to say, they had abandoned the attempt to try and produce
anything except what the public wanted.</p>

<p>In the second place, this Mr. Leffbury, the designer, was known
as a very "difficult" man. He had worked for all sorts of people.
He wouldn't work for anybody he didn't like, and he wouldn't do
anything he didn't like. Consequently, Tonks was rather proud that
he worked for him, and not only worked for him, but worked for
precisely one-eighth the salary that he used to receive from the
princely firm of Blinkinshaw &amp; Bepstow. Tonks flattered himself
that he understood Mr. Leffbury, and so, to a very large extent, he
did. He called him "Pa," and left everything that concerned his own
work entirely in his hands. When he produced idealistic schemes of
decoration that no client would look at, Mr. Tonks just grinned and
debited them in his books against the jobs that were
successful.</p>

<p>On this particular afternoon it was nearly dark, and he had come
up from the shop to the first floor. He called up the
staircase:</p>

<p>"Hullo! I say, Pa!"</p>

<p>And a voice came back:</p>

<p>"Yes, what is it?"</p>

<p>"Can you see a young feller named Gaffyn?"</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"There's a young feller named Gaffyn wants to see you. Shall I
send him up?"</p>

<p>Mr. Leffbury came out on to the staircase and scratched his
chin.</p>

<p>"Gaffyn, eh? Oh, yes, I remember. Send him up, will you? I'd
like to see him."</p>

<p>As his visitor entered he called out cheerily:</p>

<p>"Hullo, Arthur, how are you? I'm glad to see you. Have a
cigarette."</p>

<p><br>
It was ten years since they had met, and during that time Mr.
Leffbury had only occasionally thought about the young man. He was,
indeed, a man of curiously impersonal friendships. He tried, though
not always successfully, to treat everybody alike. Was he not a
protagonist of some harebrained scheme of the brotherhood of man?
His work brought him into contact with hundreds of people, and he
took them as they came and tried to find the good in them. But he
retained a vivid recollection of the visit which he had paid one
afternoon to South Kensington Museum with the boy, and the strange
association of him with Italy and Donatello. As he glanced at him
now he thought:</p>

<p>"Good Lord! I was right about him. He has been tortured by
something. He looks like an idealist struggling with the claims of
sense; one of those primitive saints painted by Cimabue. How thin
and worn he looks!"</p>

<p>Arthur perched himself on a high stool, and said:</p>

<p>"Hullo, Pa! it's nice to see you again."</p>

<p>He was affected by the way Mr. Leffbury had aged. His beard was
almost white and the hair on the top of his head was exceedingly
sparse, but his eyes retained his keen and interested glance.</p>

<p>Somewhere at the back was the pleasant hum of a steam fret-saw,
and a boy was whistling in the yard below. The little room was
warmed by a gas-stove that throbbed gently, and on the buff-colored
walls were drawings in various stages of completion. He was aware
of an odd sense of jealousy of this little, bearded man. What was
his secret of happiness! The room seemed like a sanctuary from
distressing thought; it had the placid air of concentration in
absorbing work.</p>

<p>Mr. Leffbury said:</p>

<p>"Excuse me while I wash in this paneling, or else the color will
run. You're married, aren't you!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Children?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Mr. Leffbury sighed and proceeded with his watercolor wash. Once
he glanced above his spectacles, and the thought raced through his
mind:</p>

<p>"Racked by some silly love-affair."</p>

<p>Hot upon this there came disturbing visions of his own
youth.</p>

<p>A sunlit garden of Highgate; a girl in a large straw hat,
looking up at him quickly from under its shadow. Something of an
aristocrat; no "game" for an humble draftsman. She was the daughter
of a client, but she had found something in him which, she had
said, "made life a finer, bigger thing that it was before." She was
smiling, and from across the garden stole the sound of an organ
droning in the church. Her father was moving on the gravel path,
and he could hear the pleading tones of her voice: "Frank, Frank,
nothing will ever be the same again." A thrush was talking in his
garrulous way up in the cedar tree. For the rest, no one was
allowed to share these memories that stirred in the heart of Frank
Leffbury and he resented any intrusion that threatened to disturb
them.</p>

<p>So for a time they remained silent, each unreasonably jealous of
the other. When the elder man had finished the wash, he held the
drawing to the stove in order to make it dry more quickly, and
said:</p>

<p>"Well, what have you been doing all these years, Arthur?"</p>

<p>"Oh, writing mostly; I'm working for the 'Resurgent.' I belong
to a society called 'the Morgeson Society.'"</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"It's a society run by a man named Morgeson, who's very wealthy.
The idea is to discover children of unusual talent among the poor
in the East End, and then to help them."</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! I see! 'The general excellence of society,' eh?"</p>

<p>"Something of the sort. We've already discovered two perfectly
amazing Jewish children in Shadwell&mdash;musicians. We've sent one
to Brussels and the other to Prague to be educated. We found a
little girl in Nine Elms. She's ten, but she has an extraordinary
memory. We're negotiating now about her training. The Morgeson
Society unearthed about twenty-five children last year. They're all
astounding. There's a mine of talent in the East End that goes to
pot every year because no one looks after it."</p>

<p>Mr. Leffbury looked at the younger man and said:</p>

<p>"And so you're very happy?"</p>

<p>Arthur looked a little gloomily at his hands resting on his
knees, and he answered:</p>

<p>"It's interesting work."</p>

<p>Mr. Leffbury thought:</p>

<p>"And you're as miserable as the deuce."</p>

<p>Out loud he said:</p>

<p>"How old are you, Arthur?"</p>

<p>"I'm thirty-five."</p>

<p>"As much as that? Lord! how time flies!"</p>

<p>Mr. Leffbury had not recovered from his spasm of jealousy, and
he felt resentful over this sudden intrusion into his placid
retreat, bringing with it associations of youth and passion, dreams
of Italy and its dear regrets, and the realization of his own age
and his crusted calm. He said a little boisterously:</p>

<p>"Do you hear that steam-saw, Gaffyn? I've arrived at the stage
when I must have the drone of the working world around me. I like
the sound of saws and planes. I love the smell of size and paint.
To be bothered by people asking questions all day, to have problems
to solve, to walk among men in blouses and kick the shavings under
my feet and give instructions to the little pot-bellied foreman in
his shirt-sleeves, with his bowler hat jammed right down over his
eyes&mdash;that's my idea of happiness."</p>

<p>And Arthur thought:</p>

<p>"Why does he say this to me? Besides, he's lying a little; not
altogether, but he's keeping something back. I don't believe he's
happy at all."</p>

<p>He gazed mutely at a large section of a cap washed in umber,
hanging on the wall, and said suddenly:</p>

<p>"Where are all your dreams, Pa, that you had at
Blinkinshaw's?"</p>

<p>The older man looked up at him quickly, as though about to make
an angry retort, and then he sighed instead and wiped his brushes
on a rag.</p>

<p>"I'm not working any more to-night," he said. "Come and have a
bit of dinner with me. There's a shabby little Italian restaurant
near here. The food is poisonous, but it's the best there is, and
one can get a tolerable flask of Chianti."</p>

<p>Arthnr made no reply, but he suggested acquiescence by his
deliberate manner of rising and putting on his hat. They turned up
the collars of their coats, for the night was damp and windy, and
sauntered out into the street.</p>

<p>They entered the cheerless restaurant with its red plush seats
and mirrors, and managed to secure a seat in the corner. They were
each consumed with their own inner emotions and were a little
self-conscious of the other. The difference in their ages was too
great to allow of any particular intimacy, and they looked upon
each other as merely a means for introspective discoveries. It was
Arthur who broke the silence. He said:</p>

<p>"You must forgive me mentioning Blinkinshaw's, Pa, but yesterday
I saw an appalling sight. I met that chap 'Henry.' He was shuffling
along a side street in Bloomsbury. His clothes were frayed and his
toes were positively sticking out of his boots. His face was
blotchy and puffy, and his eyes bloodshot. He cadged sixpence from
me, and darted into a 'pub' with it, like a rabbit bolting down a
hole. I knew he drank, even in my time, but I never realized how it
could destroy a man. He's little older than I am. I could not help
thinking of him on the night when I came to see you first. He was
such a gorgeous creature."</p>

<p>Mr. Leffbury broke a roll and nibbled the end.</p>

<p>"Well," he answered, "that is where one of my 'Blinkinshaw
dreams' vanished&mdash;into the bar of a pub. You seem, to an
extent, Arthur, to have given up the role of artist for that of
reformer. My experience tells me that we reformers have more to
fear from the people we want to reform than from outside
opposition. The older I grow, the more I realize that man must be
thrust back on himself. There is no outside help for him. He has to
save his own soul."</p>

<p>"So that is why you walk about the workshops and kick the
shavings under your feet?"</p>

<p>The older man looked at the younger a little dubiously and
answered:</p>

<p>"I've thought about all these things that torture you, Gaffyn,
and I tell you there's only one solution&mdash;love and work. In
combination I mean; work is no good without love, and love without
work is a destroyer."</p>

<p>He watched the younger man's face, and a perverse mood came to
him to probe the tumult of his youth. Between them lay a dubious
concoction described as "calves' brains." He took up the
silver-plated spoon and fork and served Arthur with a portion. Then
he drank a glass of Chianti in little sips and looking across the
table, said:</p>

<p>"This love question is the most illusory thing in nature. A
young man and a young woman meet, and finding a lot in common which
corresponds to the physical attraction which they have for each
other, they weave a senseless myth that they are special people,
specially designed for each other; that they will live in this way
to the end of their lives, and that afterward they will be united
eternally in some fantastic union. It's absolutely ridiculous.
Either would have been equally competent to have loved some one
else. Love is too big a thing to box up like that. There is a
universal love which sways the magic of creation. It is only that
these two have drawn a little of it to themselves, and embellished
it with all the mysterious glamor which surrounds sexual
attraction."</p>

<p>He studied the look of gloom which clouded the young man's face,
and added:</p>

<p>"We eat up each other in time, in the same way that you and I
now devour the brains of a young calf who had the same illusions in
some damp meadow."</p>

<p>Arthur pushed the plate from him and muttered:</p>

<p>"Why do you torture me like this?"</p>

<p>Mr. Leffbury suddenly became earnest:</p>

<p>"Because I wish to God it was you who ruled the world! When I
say you, I mean youth and impulse and love. It must come to that,
for the old, who own, rule, and govern the world, have worked
without love in their hearts. In the trouble that is
coming&mdash;and there is very big trouble coming to
humanity&mdash;it won't be the young who are to blame, or even the
weak or the sensual. It will be the old, who have worked without
love. Wasn't it you and I who talked about the work-box? What
wonderful things we've made out of the work-box, Gaffyn! Things to
save time, to increase comfort, to 'speed up' humanity, to create
luxury! And what does it all amount to? Work without love. Do you
remember the old punishment, now abolished&mdash;the punishment of
abortive labor? A man was made to carry bricks across a yard, and
then carry them back again, and so on all day. In time it drove him
mad. What does this prove? That even the vile have a soul, the
instinct of service. Man cannot work without love. But these
chartered libertines of righteousness, these old men whispering in
their secret chambers and pulling the wires, are simply carrying
bricks from one end of the yard to the other and back again. One
day they will go mad, and then they will drive the young before
them like cattle to the slaughter. For that is the peculiar form
that this madness will take, a sort of perverted sense, a joy in
destroying what is young and splendid.</p>

<p>"Do you know, when you came into my room just now and I said
something cruel and unreasonable to you&mdash;do you know why I did
it? Because I was suddenly jealous of you, of your youth. And I am
quite a nice old man, as old men go. But you see it everywhere; the
old coveting the things of youth and wanting to destroy the young.
And the old have the power. They have the instruments, the
accumulated symbols of coined labor of dead centuries, with which
to wreak their perverted vengeance. The young, you see, have to be
'educated,' and that is where the old men get their biggest pull.
They can teach what they like, print what they like, inculcate any
doctrine they like. The young find themselves 'baptized' before
they're conscious, wearing stiff collars and reading the newspapers
before they've had time to think. The young never get a chance, not
a dog's chance. They're tied hand and foot and pushed into the
maelstrom. The only hope for the world is when the young shall rule
it."</p>

<p>The younger man looked down and fumbled with the bread by the
side of his plate. He suddenly said:</p>

<p>"Impulse&mdash;is impulse right, Pa? I have particular cause to
know. You have spoken of impulse. I want to think about it
clearly."</p>

<p>The older man was about to reply when he observed his companion
look up at him with a strained and anxious look. His lips were
trembling and he was obviously anxious to impart some confession.
He looked down again, and Mr. Leffbury remained silent. And then in
a low voice Arthur said:</p>

<p>"Three months ago I left my wife. I am alone, and there are all
sorts of impulses&mdash;"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII&mdash;THE SENSUALIST</h2>

<p>"Let us go across to my rooms; I live not far from here with my
sister. I think she's out to-night; in any case, she won't disturb
us. We can have a smoke and chat, and if you feel in the mood, you
can tell me all about it."</p>

<p>There was a mild squabble over the bill, each wanting to pay,
but eventually the matter was settled by a division.</p>

<p>When they were at last ensconced in two easy chairs on either
side of Mr. Leffbury's fire, that gentleman continued:</p>

<p>"An impulse has, in any case, the virtue of being a free action,
untrammeled by self-consciousness or tradition. A good impulse is a
permanent good, and a bad impulse is only a transient evil. For
instance, an impulse may strike a blow, but will never wage war. It
has the gift of recovery; it isn't vindictive or calculating. That
is why impulsive people are invariably naive and lovable. It's
these long-headed, calculating people who cause all the trouble.
Roll yourself another cigarette."</p>

<p>Arthur fumbled with the tobacco-pouch and succeeded in making
himself a somewhat billowy-shaped cigarette. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're right; but I must ask your opinion whether I
should act on impulse now. I married my wife on impulse, and she
married me on calculation, I should say. To that end, impulse has
proved wrong."</p>

<p>"And calculation has proved criminal. You say your wife was
eight years older than you. What is this but the old, covetous of
the young, and anxious to destroy it? She knew what she was doing.
And so the affair has proved a failure?"</p>

<p>"Not at first; it seemed all right. And then one day I fell in
love. She was an American girl; this was seven years ago."</p>

<p>"Ah! a girl of your own age?"</p>

<p>"No; the same tragedy repeated itself. She was much younger than
I. If she had been my age, I think I should have acted on
impulse."</p>

<p>"And you, too, wanted to destroy the young, and you forswore
it?"</p>

<p>Arthur struck a second match to light his unsuccessful-looking
cigarette.</p>

<p>"In a way, I suppose. It didn't seem playing the game. She was
so young and splendid. I loved her in a fantastic manner. Oh, it is
all very difficult, Pa. I hate these people who are always shouting
their slogans about the 'will to do this, that, and the other.' I
am like an astronomer with the will to study the stars, who is
condemned to live in a basement Sometimes one can peer up and get a
peep over the area-steps of some pale star above the housetops. It
is just enough to make one reckless; one wants to grasp the whole
firmament. It was something like that I felt about her. She was my
one star, the thing that proved there was a sky above. I loved her
desperately, and yet she made me want to worship her from afar. And
so I conquered my impulse. Was I wrong?"</p>

<p>Mr. Leffbury puffed solemnly at his pipe.</p>

<p>"Tell me," he said. "What was the cause of the estrangement with
your wife? Had it to do with that?"</p>

<p>"No, curiously enough, it hadn't. We had that out and settled
it. The trouble was caused by a pearl-handled penknife."</p>

<p>"What on earth do you mean?"</p>

<p>"When I was a boy, I stole a penknife at school. I was dismissed
for it; I never thought any more of it. But eleven years after,
when I was becoming a little known, the affair was dished up by
innuendo&mdash;you know, in one of those filthy rags, that do these
things. But I wouldn't move in the matter. I made rather a fool of
myself, and was hounded out of a club I belonged to. My wife knew
of it, but wouldn't say anything. It caused a serious breach
between us, however, one of those strained, unexpressed things. I
became aware of her looking at me in a queer, furtive manner, as
though I were an unclean thing. I thought it had blown over, but
suddenly up it came again. You see the imputation had never been
denied; in fact, it was undeniable. And then it became twisted and
exaggerated. I went on with my work, but I found that people cut me
and publishers boycotted me. I believe some story went around that
I had been doing some dirty business in the city&mdash;running a
bucket-shop or something! It became quite interesting. I believe it
would really have amused me, if it hadn't been for the effect it
had on my wife. We ignored the matter at first, but eventually it
couldn't be ignored and I told her the whole story. She behaved in
the most womanly manner, and forgave me and sympathized with me, as
you may imagine, but her eyes! Good God! into her eyes there came
that look, like a thick veil between us. With her training and her
tradition it was impossible not to feel the cleavage. She fled to
the opposing camp, and my heart hardened against her. I felt very
much alone in my struggle with her. The combat was unequal. She had
everything and everyone on her side, and she was a woman of action,
while I could only review the battle in a detached way, like a
spectator. The pawns we fought with were the marshaled array of
'little things.' Oh, those little things! How much more important a
part they play in the struggle than the big things. I learned to
put up with the children; Martin, the boy, is quite a nice chap.
There was never the suggestion of a quarrel; it was only just the
way she looked at me in odd moments, her frigid patronage, little
worrying ways of fussing over purely material things, a certain
narrowness of outlook. And then, beneath it all, despite her
somewhat insolent sense of moral superiority, a 'common-fibered'
something. How can I explain it?</p>

<p>"She seemed to fall away from me, to be a different person. She
became less my wife than a symbol of those forces of which you
spoke, Pa; forces I felt myself to be just outside. Honestly, this
civilization of ours beats me; I give it up! I feel like a child in
an engine-room. I see the wheels going round and great cranks
turning, but they mean nothing to me; I want to be out in the sun.
It was at this time that I joined the staff of 'The Resurgent.'
You've heard of it? It has been described in the respectable press
as 'a magazine run by madmen for madmen'; you know what that
means&mdash;anyone who won't sell his soul is a madman.</p>

<p>"The thing surged on, working up to little climaxes and then
dying down. The tragedy was not helped by the fact that I had not
the ability to be cruel. When these little climaxes came she used
to cry, and swear she loved me. And I pitied her intensely. I was
tied to her by all these years of companionship, a time marked by
many hours of tenderness and passion. I believe in her hard,
aristocratic way she loves me still. My love for her is dead, but I
cannot kill my pity. I sometimes pray for the power to be cruel.
Our separation has worked by drifting methods. For longer and
longer periods I went down and stayed at my father's bungalow at
Bodiesham. I found it a sort of sanctuary, as though it were still
haunted by his gentle, distinguished presence. I can work there. As
you know, I made some progress. 'The Fugitive Philosopher' was well
reviewed. I have done other stuff that has called forth some meed
of sympathy from unexpected quarters. A child said to me, 'They who
have the great secret know each other in a crowd.' That's true
enough, Pa. We have to turn to children for wisdom and love, eh?
Heavens! have you any whisky?"</p>

<p>Mr. Leffbury produced a tantalus from a cupboard, and set out
two glasses and a siphon. When the concoction was mixed, Arthur
drank half his tumbler rapidly, and continued:</p>

<p>"I suppose in time I shall become like Henry, Pa, and shuffle
down back streets, with my toes sticking out of my boots."</p>

<p>He laughed a little wildly and rested his feet on the
fender.</p>

<p>"I know what they say of me&mdash;I'm a sensualist. And it's
true; I am a sensualist. But my idea of a sensualist differs from
theirs. Do you know what I mean by a sensualist? I mean a man who
has the whole world at his feet, and then doesn't take it. That is
the maximum appeal to sense that a man can enjoy. Who was that old
fool? Nero! He fiddled while Rome burnt. My heart goes out to that
man. My only dread is that he fiddled badly, scraped like a rich
amateur. But if he fiddled well! Here was an idealist for you! The
one man who realized that spirit is more important than matter,
that it is better to make divine music than to save property. Why
shouldn't Rome burn?</p>

<p>"I am a sensualist because my life has been concerned with
qualities and textures, rather than with substances. Well, why not?
I have helped to shape things a little, haven't I? What else do any
of us do? We're not finished products, any of us; we're tendencies.
We're just the sentient nerves connecting the dead with the great
unborn. The dead are clamorous, calling to us to carry on the
things they fought for, but the unborn are more insistent. They
touch our hearts with the knowledge that they will reap our sowing.
Life is quality, not quantity. Sometimes these fools will seize a
segment of clay and round off the edges, and call it a general, or
an admiral, or a judge, and shove it into a wall at Westminster and
speak of 'Glory' and 'Honor.' Do you know why they do it? They do
it because they're afraid of the dead and afraid of the unborn.
They have to keep on pinching themselves to show that they're
alive. It gives them confidence to see a tombstone and to bring in
acts of Parliament. Oh, the pompous drivel! They will spend a
century discussing whether Shakespeare's father was a publican or a
butcher, and will write tedious books to prove that another man
wrote his plays, but they won't understand that the only thing that
matters a damn is <i>themselves</i> in relation to the spirit of
the plays.</p>

<p>"Shakespeare was a sensualist. He got up in the morning and
drank beer for breakfast, and the beauty of the sunrise would make
him cry. What better biography could anyone desire than that? If
there is a God, the sensualist must be very dear to him, for he
interprets so many of His inventions, like a skilled musician
playing the works of a composer."</p>

<p>"One night I was alone in the bungalow at Bodiesham. I was
suffering terribly, when, for some reason or other, I started
thinking about Christ. It's a strange thing. I was then
thirty-four, and I think it was the first time I had thought about
Christ seriously. At school I attended two services daily in His
honor. Why is it that we always have His teachings dinned into us
till we hate them, at an age when we have not the imagination to
grasp them? I detested the Christian religion, with its dull dogma
and its dreary service in the ugly chapel. But on that night I was
so wretched I groped for consolations. And on a sudden I thought of
that bearded Jew who was crucified at Calvary because of His
convictions. And I thought the story through, and wished I had not
heard it before. I should like to have come across it suddenly for
the first time that night. I should have liked to have had it told
me by an Arab storyteller, his body swaying in the moonlight under
the white wall of a Syrian mosque. Or even more than that, I should
like to have written the story myself, to have had it come to me in
a dream. For when you come to think of it, it's the most wonderful
story in the world. With its background of olive groves and violet
nights and Eastern music and, against this, that amazing
full-blooded man who was not afraid to hate the Scribes and
Pharisees, and who took a stout whip of thongs and drove the
money-changers out of the temple with lusty blows. Here was a
sensualist after one's own heart. That was the one thing He could
not stand&mdash;the money-changers in the temple! And when they
heckled Him, He answered them in parables&mdash;a splendid,
artistic touch!&mdash;and parables that will live forever.</p>

<p>"He was the one man who was not afraid to let himself go, and
they killed Him for it and shoved thorns and nails in His flesh,
and so He pointed the salvation of the world in terms of physical
sensation. And after he died the money-changers went back to the
temple, and they've been there ever since. But what I like is His
insistence on the great divergence between sin and the sinner. He
hated one and loved the other. He shut no one out. He raised the
Magdalen from the dust, and didn't ask questions when the afflicted
were brought to Him. And then that wonderful incident at the end,
when the thief who was crucified with Him turned to Him. I like to
think of that thief, not as a muscular hooligan of the highway, but
as some little whining Jew of a property-receiver, a man whose life
wouldn't bear looking into. Think how he would have suffered! The
sickening terrors of fear and remorse and contrition, his
hopelessness and utter isolation! And then the ghastly pain as he
looked down at his bleeding limbs, the limbs that perhaps only his
mother had loved in her idolatrous way! Floods of self-pity swamp
him, and suddenly, as the sweating horrors of death close in, he
looks up and into the eyes of a God who says:</p>

<p>"'To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.'</p>

<p>"It's the most wonderful story in the world! It's getting late.
Pa, and you haven't given me your opinion about my impulse."</p>

<p>Mr. Leffbury watched the young man's face intently. In the
little room, lighted by a cold incandescent gaslight, he listened
to the voice of the young man of whom he had been envious. He
answered in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Arthur, when you move about in the crowd I hope you will always
find one pair of eyes that knows your 'secret.' I would help you if
I could. What is this impulse now you want me to adjudicate upon?
Your relationship with your wife, as far as I can judge, has gone
beyond impulse. Is it the other woman, the girl?"</p>

<p>Arthur nodded:</p>

<p>"Next week she is coming back to Europe. The thought of it
tortures me. I am a riot of impulse. I love her wildly,
desperately. What am I to do?"</p>

<p>"What is the difference in your ages?"</p>

<p>"Twelve years."</p>

<p>"Does she still love you?"</p>

<p>"How can I tell? We have been sending lovers' notes to each
other. It is six years since we met. She is a child,
impressionable, happy. It may have been an illusion on her part.
The young forget. There is romance in writing loving letters. How
can I trust her youth? She says things that send my spirits raging
up to the skies, and at other times things that fill me with
foreboding and doubt. She talks of people I have never seen, speaks
affectionately of youths who go with her to picnics and dances. It
is all a wild jumble in my brain. How can one trust the written
word? She has the genius of love. How can I detach her love for me
from the ocean of love which is her natural birthright? What am I
to do?"</p>

<p>The older man thought for a moment, and then he said kindly:</p>

<p>"Your impulses won't lead you far astray, if you keep them
worthy of your secret. The secret which you and I believe in,
Arthur, and those others who will know us in the crowd, is that
that world which we believe in, that world that shall one day
evolve from these chaotic happenings, is the world you have
pictured to me&mdash;a child in the Luxembourg Gardens gazing up at
a kite."</p>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII&mdash;ARTHUR WRITES A LETTER</h2>

<p>12B Rue de la Grande Arme,<br>
St Germain.<br>
<br>
To Frank Leffbury, Esq.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>My dear Pa,<br></p>

<p>I wanted to escape from ciyilization, so I came to Paris. You
may understand this paradox better than most people. It is, indeed,
not a paradox at all, but a very obvious platitude. Paris presents
more "escapes" than any city I know. You may think from this that I
am leading a wild life, becoming a sort of "Henry." Alas! this is
anything but true. I am far too unhappy, too distracted to face the
reaction from these doubtful pleasures. I only find relief by
probing about and looking into faces more unhappy than my own. I
promised you I would tell you the outcome of my adventures, and so
I leave this letter to explain itself. My pen runs on, but I feel a
queer, detached person looking over my shoulder, if you can
understand what I mean. Have you ever seriously contemplated
self-destruction? I have, and I failed, not through lack of
courage, but because I reached the point when I realized that
self-destruction wouldn't be any solution at all. One has to hug
one's dear remorse all through one's life, go to bed with it, get
up with it, follow it through the work-a-day world until it becomes
one's companion, learn to love it like a piece of old furniture
that has been in the family for generations.</p>

<p>Nature, who overdoes everything, is particularly prodigal when
it comes to questions of sexual attraction. The thing is
ridiculously overdone. I am told that barely one twentieth of
nature's production attain to maturity. Perhaps it is her inverted
way of expressing the fact that quality is more important than
quantity. She doesn't give a damn for all this wastage, as long as
the best survives. I do not understand this popular belief that
human life is sacred. Why is it sacred? Because we don't understand
it? But what do we understand? Nothing, except the impulses of our
own hearts. I believe in the sanctity of an idea, but not of a
person. Otherwise we might lay ourselves out to produce millions
and millions of healthy policemen, shall we say? Fancy the world
entirely populated and overcrowded with healthy policemen and dairy
girls. Heavens! it would be better to produce one sickly Heine
writing from "his mattress grave."</p>

<p>I am writing all this down as it comes into my head, because I
want to forget all about you. I want to set down just what I have
gone through and how it has affected me. I want to dig it out of
myself. You will realize, then, that this is a selfish letter,
written more for my own benefit than for yours. But it will help me
enormously to give it to some one, and so you must pay the price of
having too sympathetic a heart!</p>

<p>When I beheld my beloved again&mdash;it was in the vestibule of
a hotel&mdash;she seemed to me more wondrous than ever, more
intensely my own. She was the complement to the shattered fragment
of me that had roamed the earth these many years. She was more and
more of a woman, with the brooding motherliness of her kind. As I
touched her little fingers, that sacro-sensuous message swept
through my heart. I don't know whether it is sacred or profane, but
the message seemed to be: "You will be the mother of my
children."</p>

<p>I could hardly speak to her, she seemed so rare and wonderful a
thing. There were a whole lot of them there, apart from her
brother; all young people, buoyant and gay, and full of lively
purposes. I was introduced sketchily. I didn't get the hang of who
they all were, or what they were doing, except that they were going
on a tour round Europe. They talked prodigiously&mdash;you know
what these Americans are!&mdash;but I liked them for their
simplicity and youth, and their keen way of lying in wait for
impressions. If I had any misgivings, it only took the form that my
heart's desire was more of an assured woman, her attitude more
mothering and consciously friendly. She called me "old man" and
"dear old Arthur," terms the significance of which I did not grasp
till afterward.</p>

<p>So crowded were the white-hot arrangements of this joyous
party&mdash;they left the following night for Paris&mdash;that I
did not get an opportunity of seeing her alone. I dined with them,
and her face was flushed and excited with what I believed to be the
joy of seeing me again. I was to meet them a fortnight later in
Switzerland, and take the Italian trip with them.</p>

<p>But just before my time for departure a cable came from her
brother to say that sickness had broken out in the party. He
advised me not to come and said he was writing. I suffered an agony
of suspense awaiting his letter, dreading some terrible news about
my dear one. But when the letter came it said that one of the girls
and one of the young men had developed typhoid fever through
drinking impure water. They were very ill, and the party was upset.
Alice and another girl had constituted themselves nurses. He would
let me know later how things went.</p>

<p>It was three weeks before I heard again. Then the brother wrote
once more. The invalids were getting on well, but the boy, who had
the ridiculous name of "Cinders"&mdash;I think it was a
nickname&mdash;had been very ill. He and the girl were staying on
at Lausanne, and Alice and the other girl were going to remain and
look after them, while the rest of the party were leaving for
Florence. Would I join them there? Then I began to suffer paroxysms
of misgiving. Why had Alice not even sent me a card! Why should I
go to Florence? What was Florence to me or I to Florence that I
should worship her while Alice was nursing some boy in Lausanne? I
became restless and distraught. A dozen times I packed my things
and prepared to start for Lausanne, and a dozen times I changed my
mind. Perhaps, after all, she did not want me to go? She had not
written.</p>

<p>And then her letter came. It was a long and loving letter, full
of regrets for not having written before, crowded with details of
the tedious "Cinder's" illness, and embellished with endearing
terms; but there was no hint that she expected me at Lausanne! For
the first time I began to suspect the "dear old man" attitude. I
was consumed with jealousy and doubt I replied post-haste, not
daring to express my doubts, but hinting desperately at my desire
for her and my anxiety to see her again immediately.</p>

<p>Again three weeks went by, and then came another letter like the
last. They were staying at Lausanne&mdash;they had learned to love
the place&mdash;until September, and then they would be coming back
through London.</p>

<p>I had no misgivings then. I heard the slow music of this dance
of tragic circumstances drawing nearer and nearer, and across the
fair prospect of my newly awakened life there fell the shadow of
the dancers swaying slowly to its gentle rhythm.</p>

<p>I lived in a sort of trance for weeks. I wrote to her every day.
Sometimes I tore the letters up, sometimes I sent them. I bullied
myself into an obeisance of a kind. I said, "You fool, isn't this
what you predicted? What else could you expect?"</p>

<p>Work was out of the question. I was living alone in rooms at
Chelsea at the time. I used to wander about the streets at night
and think: "Is she asleep? Is she awake? Is she thinking of me?
That other one, has he really come? Is it possible that anyone
could love her as I love her?" And then I would break away in
despair and mutter, "I can't go on! I can't go on!" In the morning
I would try and write calmly to her. There was a stimulus for
writing calmly, for if I considered the letter calm enough, I sent
it, but if it was too violent, I kicked myself into tearing it
up.</p>

<p>She wrote me two more letters before the month of September
came. They were very similar to the others, kindy affectionate, but
marred by an undercurrent of pity. God! how little a thing pity is
when we die for love!</p>

<p>I began to dread the day when she would come. I was frightened;
I felt insecure in my grip upon myself. The strain of those months
was telling upon me terribly.</p>

<p>It was in this mood that I came to Paris. It was on the way; she
would have to pass through it. I was, indeed, starting for
Lausanne. But here I hardened my heart. In the agonizing crisis
that came to me, I realized for the first time that it would be
possible to be cruel. I knew that I could leave my wife utterly and
finally. She would get over it and "settle down"&mdash;a disgusting
term!&mdash;but for me everything else was finished.</p>

<p>And now I am in a fever of despair. I wander about the streets
desperately, and at night I do not sleep. Again and again I have
visions of the tragedy that is upon me. Do you know what will
happen, Pa? I can see it all as vividly as this pen I hold in my
hand. A letter will drop into the box. Her dear writing! Listen;
this is what she will say:</p>

<p class="letter">I have some wonderful news for you. I am in a
dream. It is all too beautiful to be true. You were right, Arthur
dear, in your prediction concerning me. I want you to forgive me
and to share my happiness. Will you come and see me to-morrow at
&mdash;&mdash; and I will tell you everything. Alice.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, I know she will ask me to "share her happiness." O
God! And then I shall laugh in a silly, hysterical way, laugh and
cry and rage, and then everything will be dark and silent.</p>

<p>Of course I shall go. I shall go the next day to the flat, or
hotel, or whatever it is. I shall go to "share her happiness" and
to offer her my hand. I can see it all quite clearly and I rehearse
my part by day and night.</p>

<p>I can see the little room with the Chesterfield before the fire.
The maid announces me. And then as I enter, Alice, with a little
cry of pleasure, comes forward to meet me. She "old man's" me
unmercifully. I observe the cosy security of the room, the crumpled
cushions on the Chesterfield, Alice with one of the strands of her
beautiful hair dishevelled, her eyes deep and a little tired, as
though she had been disturbed in a dream, and a boy in a gray suit
who rises and grins at me in a friendly, patronizing way. She will
say:</p>

<p>"Dear old Arthur, I'm ever so glad to see you!"</p>

<p>And on her face will be the strained glance of pity.</p>

<p>Everything is finished and inevitable. I cannot speak. I stand
there gazing foolishly at her gold-brown hair and that
incriminating curl I love so dearly. In all my life I have never
suffered as I suffer at that moment. She never seems so much my
own, my very own. All the dear lines of her little body, and the
wistful poise of her small head. O God! I had made them mine.
Everything about her is mine. I have stamped it on my heart and
carried it about with me in a thousand earthly fragments. And now
she stands before me with the eyes of a lover, languorously happy,
as though the horrors of sense have become exalted and she finds in
them some divine elation.</p>

<p>I cannot believe that I must not take her in my arms. It is the
supreme moment I am to awaken in her, when I see bewilderment pass
to the yielding ecstasy of love. I do not know how long I stand
there, but my eyes are trying to convey:</p>

<p>"Alice, Alice, it is I. You and I, dear. Surely there can be no
other. You cannot have forgotten. Those hours we loved cannot be
forgotten or destroyed. This is some mad dream, this other thing.
If I were alone with you, surely I could re-awaken&mdash;If I could
press my cheek against yours, as I did that night when you said you
could not let me go, surely I could draw you back to me. It must be
so. Oh, my dear, my dear."</p>

<p>Again and again I rehearse this scene. But she smiles and speaks
to me again in her warm voice, and I turn and shake the boy's hand.
I can see him, too, quite clearly. There is nothing wrong with him.
He is real enough, one of her own people. I can see the clear gray
eye, the strong and purposeful chin. Yes, yes, I must "share her
happiness."</p>

<p>We talk inanely about Swiss hotels, or the way of making
omelettes at Mont St. Michel, or something equally ridiculous, and
then I stand up and congratulate them, and pass out of their lives.
For I know I have not the strength to be "an old pal."</p>

<p>"Dear old Arthur!"</p>

<p>But she will not leave me alone with her pity. She tells the boy
to wait while she walks with me to the end of the street. And the
boy grins, with the conscious superiority of his unassailable
position.</p>

<p>In the street she presses my arm.</p>

<p>"Arthur dear, I'm so sorry."</p>

<p>And I keep on repeating:</p>

<p>"I'm glad for you. I hope you'll be happy."</p>

<p>The tears are in her beautiful eyes as she says:</p>

<p>"You'll never do anything foolish, Arthur!"</p>

<p>"No, no, I won't do anything foolish."</p>

<p>And then, like a fool, I give a sob, perhaps, and the tears are
streaming down her cheeks, but I manage to say:</p>

<p>"I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm sorry, Alice."</p>

<p>We are at some crowded corner and I mount a bus. I am struck by
the fact that people are laughing and talking, and boys are selling
newspapers. Why on earth should people want newspapers? What news
can there be when love is shut out?</p>

<p>From the top of a bus I look back and see her standing waving to
me. She looks so fragile and slight, so alone amid the ugly turmoil
of the corner, I cannot get it out of my head that I ought not to
go back and look after her. My Alice! My dear!</p>

<p>Then, with a swerve, we pass into the obscurity of the night. I
have been through all this a hundred times today.</p>

<p>If you have any pity, Pa, leave your muddy drawings for a day
and come and see.</p>

<p>Your disconsolate disciple,<br>
Arthur Gaffyn.</p>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX&mdash;MR. LEFFBURY REPLIES TO ANOTHER LETTER</h2>

<p>Nottingdale.</p>

<p>My dear Arthur:</p>

<p>Why are you always destined to make a fool of me! I am very busy
to-day (a music-room for some blasted lady of title. Tonks and I
are getting a move on. I am now his pupil), and yet I left off
early and came home. I went to my desk and took out an old
sandalwood box. There are certain things in it. I am not going to
tell you about them; you don't deserve it. The white lilac is in
bloom in the garden of the square here, and on my table are these
<i>yerba buena</i> letters of yours. There is too much <i>yerba
buena</i> about them altogether. By the way, I did read your
"Fugitive Philosopher," and I must concede that you are something
of a philosopher, or in any case, you are the most unreasonable
person I have ever met, which amounts to very much the same thing.
Perhaps, in my life, I have tried to be too static a philosopher. I
have always wanted to know everything, to have all knowledge at my
finger-tips and to weld the result into some cosmic understanding.
Your desire seems to be to know nothing, to feel your way through
the maze, and to be always peeping over the edge! You are, indeed,
something of a cheat. I had great hopes, in my position of
father-confessor, of observing you find your way out by some fine
spiritual evolution. But you must needs meet the old trouble with
the usual moon-calf remedy. I am disgusted with you, but I add to
my store of knowledge. I discover that, after all, all philosophy
is fugitive. It is as fluid as the Gulf Stream and equally as
debatable a warmer of humanity.</p>

<p>When you wrote me that preposterous letter from Paris&mdash;was
it only last summer?&mdash;and I left my work and went over and
found you with a fever in some vile-smelling rooms, my philosophy
was of a fixed and rigid order. I was really rather pleased with
it; and I enjoyed my visit immensely. Heavens! how I worked and
dived within myself. I did not realize that philosophy could be so
good a friend to man. Indeed, all that can be said is that in
trying to help you, I helped myself.</p>

<p>Don't you remember "kicking the shavings under one's feet"?
Didn't I demonstrate to you the joy of things purely intellectual;
the love of work, the love of one's fellow-man, the consciousness
of being in touch with the great heart of humanity stretching out
toward God? I will acknowledge now that I started talking to you
with my tongue in my cheek, because I pitied you, but so persuasive
and eloquent did I become, that gradually I began to believe that
what I said was true. I was tremendously pleased with myself. I
think I left you in worse case than I found you, certainly more
argumentative and irrational, but I returned to London with peace
in my own heart. For days I could think of nothing but what a
satisfactory person I was. I had been haunted by the eyes of youth
at a magic casement, expectant for the satisfying hour. And lo! the
magic casement had become a dark tower of troubled gloom, and you
had drawn me into it, and I had done my duty. I had pointed out to
you the illusion of these sentimental periods. The satisfying hour
is only found within. I was pleased that I had pointed this out to
you. And I was wise enough to withdraw another remark I had made.
"No," I said. "The world has not one tenth the power of torturing
you that you have of torturing yourself. A child like you can no
more escape from his temperament than a leopard can escape from his
spots."</p>

<p>So pleased was I with this postulate that I wrote it down, I
remember. And I promised myself to help you. I would weave around
you a delicate web of this shifting philosophy, that would have to
be adapted to moods and seasons. And suddenly you cut the Gordian
knot of my placid self-satisfaction with your outrageous telegram:
"I went to Lausanne. There was no other." Was ever a man made to
cut so ridiculous a figure! Fool and renegade! Because a girl who
has been intelligently educated calls you "old man," your Latin
blood becomes suspicious. You see the dancing elf of friendship
when you are yearning for the warm breasts of Hebe! In your fevered
anxiety it does not occur to you that a girl who has had years of
training in physics and medicine would naturally nurse any
fellow-being in a crisis! Because her letters are sane and healthy,
and are not couched in the same outrageously sentimental strain as
your own, your imagination riots with scenes that are more vivid
than reality. Indeed, with such as you there is no point of
difference. As I see you, your only hope lies in this woman. She
may make some sort of man of you, if she only makes you her slave.
I note with satisfaction that you went to Lausanne; Lausanne did
not come to you. Odd's Bodikin! I really believe you expected her
to! You seemed to accept it as your natural prerogative that a girl
like this would run after you, an officially married man into the
bargain. I rejoice that she made you go to Lausanne. In fact, I
have a confession to make concerning this girl. I have written to
her and I have had a reply&mdash;one of the nicest letters I have
ever had in my life. Among other things she said this: "You bet
your sweet life. Pa Leffbury, I won't spoil him. There has been a
conspiracy to spoil him all through. I'm going to make him prance
like a two-year-old."</p>

<p>There is great hope for this child.</p>

<p>So loose and inconsequent is your grip on concrete things that
if I were holding a watching brief for humanity, I'm not sure that
I should not dismiss you altogether, but for the fact that you have
the salutary effect of disturbing me. In fact, you are the most
disturbing thing in life, its kind of moral genius, with an
infinite capacity for suffering and enjoying.</p>

<p>Some there are who have a faculty for pushing their way about in
a crowd. Others can only look on from a window, but so profoundly
does the spectacle move them that they are driven to express their
vision of it. And so, if their expression is sincere enough, they
may eventually become more active agents than the pusher in the
street below. To this end I would, perhaps, justify you.</p>

<p>At any moment the magic casement may light up and become a place
of revelation. And who shall say from what obscure corner these
things we desire so much may not come? You are all visions. A
wooden box, an empty room, a shut door, dumb ghost-ridden
things&mdash;these are the realities which move you. The history of
a race, the precision of science, the phenomena of social progress,
mean nothing to you at all. You are just outside them. You are as
apposite to the functionary of society as a haunting scheme of
color, or that recurring theme in Schubert's <i>Impromptu</i>,
would be to the steel frame of a New York building.</p>

<p>Even when you send me an extravagant message from Las
Palmas:</p>

<p>"I have found the great solution, Pa Leffbury. Every hour is a
satisfying hour."</p>

<p>I rage against the tawdry apothegm, but I am haunted by the
vision of you. The "great solution"! Fiddlesticks!</p>

<p>"Every hour a satisfying hour!"</p>

<p>Yes, yes, I dare say! And every duck is a swan, and no one has
ever been in love before, and the "great solution" is once more
this calf-love affected by the moon.</p>

<p>I promise you you will suffer again intensely, despite your
"solution," for the simple reason that others will suffer and you
are only the "sensitive nerve." This Alice of yours will have a
bilious attack, or she will have children, or you will see a poor
child with a scrofulous neck, and behold, the magic casement will
again become a place of torment. You will rage and weep, and be a
source of irritation to others, as you are to me, but neither they
nor I will be able to dismiss you.</p>

<p>It is good for us all to be disturbed sometimes in this game of
hunt-the-thimble. For isn't it really all rather like that? We're
primarily time-devourers. We hate time, and invent things to
destroy it. Everyone is glad to find it is later than they
expected. We are glad when it is near the end of the day or the
week. We are glad when winter is over, and the spring, and
half-past six, and the term, and the summer, and even the
holiday&mdash;just as though we were secretly hunting for
something. We're like a lot of greedy children with a pudding in
which some one is reported to have put a lucky sixpence. So anxious
are we to get at the sixpence that we tear the pudding to pieces
bit by bit. It is not till we begin to get old that we are apt to
ask ourselves whether the chance of a lucky sixpence is worth the
destruction of the whole pudding.</p>

<p>You with your satisfying hours!</p>

<p>Do you imagine that your description of California moves me in
the slightest? You would find equal delights in Bayswater or
Canning Town in your present mood. Of course I know the madrons
tree; it is simply the Greek arbutus. But what are tamales? And
what is an adobe house? And an oyster loaf? And what, in God's
name, is a high-ball? It is useless to ask me to share these joys
with you. I am as much a slave to my "shavings" as you are to the
eyes of your mistress.</p>

<p>I am, in fact, angry with you, angry and a little jealous; and
for the reason that you have the faculty of escaping "just
outside." However we may circumscribe you, you will always be
there dancing about, like a will-o'-the-wisp, just outside the
circle. The schoolmaster will say you are "a detrimental," the
politician "an anti-social," the churchman will give you up as a
hopeless case; and yet I must concede this point to you, that if
they cannot encompass you, it is they who are "just outside." They
do not, in truth, know their job, and that is the only quality I
can bring myself to reverence in any man.</p>

<p>I went to St. Anne's in Soho on Wednesday night and heard Bach's
"Passion" music. It is evergreen, and gave me great comfort.
To-night I have discovered a new and interesting blend of tobacco.
I am honoring you by smoking it as I write. No, I shall never come
and see you, but I feel better for writing this letter, calmer and
more of a static philosopher, and I will always be pleased to put
you right upon these hoary theses that you are so apt to evolve.
Upon one I will put you right at once. It is not the old who rule
the world. It never was and never will be. It is the young.
Whatever we may do to them, they triumph. It is their game all
through. People talk of a world-calamity, but I promise you there
is only one conceivable world-calamity&mdash;that humanity should
lose the faculty to fall in love. It isn't the old or even the wise
who keep us all agog, but youth with his disturbing visions. You
never sent me back that copy of Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason"
which I lent you. I don't suppose you ever will, or that you will
ever read it, you young devil! Ah, well! I have bullied you enough
to-night!</p>

<p>Your friend,</p>

<p>Frank Leffbury.</p>
