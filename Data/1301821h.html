<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<br>
<p>L<small>IKE</small> some of the explorers whose deeds are
recorded in these pages, I have been enticed far beyond the
distance I contemplated reaching on setting out upon my
investigations. Having only started to examine a single point in
the history of Victoria, I have been led the length of producing
a complete and authentic account of the exploration and
colonization of that Province.</p>
<p>This work had its origin in a curiosity to ascertain more
particulars of the discovery of Port Phillip Bay by Lieut.
Murray, than are supplied by the meagre statements respecting
that event which have hitherto been published. It occurred to me
that the log of the <i>Lady Nelson</i>, Murray's vessel, might
contain some interesting details; so, having ascertained that it
was in existence in the Public Record Office, I applied for, and
was favoured with, permission from the Admiralty to inspect the
log, and am thus able to present to my readers all those parts of
it which bear upon the subject of this book. Being astonished
that a document of such historic importance should have been laid
aside and forgotten, I naturally concluded that others relating
to the early history of the Colony had shared the same fate. This
led me to ask permission to inspect the Colonial Office papers in
the Record Office, which was courteously granted; and I set to
work upon a regular search through several hundred volumes of
despatches and letters of the New South Wales
Correspondence&mdash;from the foundation of the Colony in 1788,
to the colonization of the Port Phillip District&mdash;and also
through most of the Tasmanian Correspondence to the same period.
From these papers, which contain a vast amount of information
respecting the early history of Australia, I have been able to
bring to light numerous documents which have hitherto remained as
if mere ordinary official records.</p>
<p>Among these are all the papers and correspondence relating to
the settlements attempted to be founded by Colonel Collins at
Port Phillip in 1803-4, and by Captains Wright and Wetherall at
Western Port in 1826-27. None of these papers seem ever to have
been printed; and I know of no published account of either of
those attempts to colonize the territory of Victoria. Whenever
mentioned, they are barely noticed by writers who have treated of
the early settlement of the Colony.</p>
<p>Some documents, also, now brought to light, seem to set at
rest the controversy whether Hume and Hovell, on arriving at the
coast, both believed that they were at Port Phillip Bay or at
Western Port, and also whether the party of Batman or of Fawkner
first selected the site of Melbourne.</p>
<p>I have been disappointed in not discovering two important
documents&mdash;for which I have sought wherever there seemed a
chance of finding them in this country, and have also written out
for them to Sydney&mdash;namely, Bass's original journal of his
whale-boat expedition to Western Port, and the report made by
Surveyor-General Grimes of his investigation of Port Phillip Bay,
when sent from Sydney to examine that harbour in 1802. The
leading facts of the former are doubtless given by Flinders, in
his "Terra Australis"; whose chart of the bay is completed from
that of Grimes. But, as my desire has been to record the
statements of the first explorers themselves, not secondary
recitals of them, however complete and accurate, I regret being
unable to give the exact words of Bass and Grimes. I, however,
rejoice at the fact that the report of the latter has recently
been found in Sydney, although unable to set it out in these
pages, and hope that some one will also be more fortunate than I
have been in discovering Bass's original journal&mdash;the only
important document now wanting to complete the authentic history
of discovery in Victoria.</p>
<p>The facts contained in these pages could have been compressed
into much smaller space, by merely giving the substance of the
documents set out, with references to where they may be found;
but then the work would be without its chief value as an
authority,&mdash;most of the documents in it having never before
been printed.</p>
<p>My desire being to produce an accurate and complete work on my
native Colony, I now present this in the form which strikes me as
likely to make it most useful as a permanent historical record.
Its merit consists, not in my attempt to tell the tale of
exploration and colonization in my own language, but in letting
the explorers and colonizers speak in theirs. History would be
more accurate had those who made it been allowed to state, in
their own way, how they did so, instead of other people
attempting to tell their story better for them.</p>
<p>Some of my readers, who know how strong my sympathies are with
those large ideas which regard the United Empire as one
nation&mdash;one country&mdash;may perhaps be surprised that I
should have so much interested myself with the details of the
early history of one of its provinces; but I see no reason why
the strongest Imperial sentiments should not co-exist with the
warmest affection for that particular part of the Empire in which
a man has been born and brought up. His devotion to the unity of
the Empire need be none the less, because he thinks his own
Colony, or division of the British Dominions, the best, and does
his utmost to promote its advancement, in friendly and healthy
rivalry for progress with the others. The interests of the
Empire, and of its component parts, run upon such parallel lines,
that it appears impossible that they can ever come into
collision. The welfare of the whole is essential to each part, as
that of each part is to the whole.</p>
<p>I should be guilty of an unpardonable omission were I not to
acknowledge my obligation to the Colonial and Admiralty
Departments, in granting me permission to examine their
documents, and to use those of them which appear in this book;
and I cannot speak too highly of the uniform courtesy and
kindness with which I have been aided in my investigations by the
gentlemen of each of the departments with whom I have been
brought in contact,&mdash;particularly those of the Record
Office, where most of my investigations have taken place. My
thanks are specially due to Mr. Alfred Kingston, for greatly
facilitating my researches, for many valuable suggestions, and
much kindness, during the long time I have pursued my inquiries
in his office.</p>
<p>I am also indebted to Mr. William Henty for valuable
information respecting the settlement founded by his family at
Portland Bay, and to Mr. Flinders Petrie, for some interesting
facts about the explorations of his grandfather, the celebrated
navigator. I have to thank Mr. H.B.T. Strangways for some kind
assistance, and to acknowledge the helpful interest taken in my
work by Messrs. Chesson, William Walker, J.A. Youl, C.M.G.,
Frederick Young, and by the late Mr. Edward Wilson.</p>
<p>To Mr. Bonwick, Mr. Westgarth, Mr. Rusden, Rev. Dr. Lang, Rev.
Julian Woods, and others, great praise is due for their services,
in giving to the world such knowledge respecting the history of
Victoria, as has been obtainable from Australian sources of
information.</p>
<p>The fact that Australia was governed till 1856, according to
the Crown Colony system, accounts for most of the important early
official documents, relating to the history of the country,
having been sent to England.</p>
<p>I at first thought of strictly limiting this history to the
exploration and colonization of the territory; but, as it
approached completion, it seemed desirable to continue it, on an
abbreviated scale, down to the time when the Port Phillip
District,&mdash;after having been separated from New South Wales,
and passing through a short existence as the Crown Colony of
Victoria,&mdash;was finally invested with all the functions of
constitutional self-government. At this period the early history
of the Colony clearly ends. From the occupation of the territory
downwards, the leading events are, therefore, noticed; but if
recorded on the same scale as those of the earlier and less known
periods of the colonial history, they would have occupied at
least as much space.</p>
<p>What this work does for Victoria might well be done for each
of the Australian Colonies. It is time that all the documents
bearing upon their history should be printed. Some years ago a
literary society in New York sent over to this country and
obtained copies of all documents relating to the history of that
State, which have since been published. The same has been done
for other portions of the American Union. My book must do some
service, if it only direct attention to the mine of information
respecting colonial history which it has far from exhausted. Not
until the forgotten materials for the history of each of the
Colonies are collected, as I have endeavoured to collect those of
Victoria, can a comprehensive history of Australia be
written.</p>
<p>I have only been able to accomplish this undertaking by
spreading it over some years&mdash;other avocations having
prevented me from devoting myself continuously to the work. It
has been a labour, but one of love, lightened by the interest
which the expectation and realization of new discoveries impart,
not merely to the geographical explorer himself, but, in no small
degree also, to the historian who seeks to bring to light the
forgotten records of his achievements.</p>

peninsula&mdash;Vancouver proposes to ascertain the
fact&mdash;His despatches to Lord Grenville on the
subject&mdash;Mungo Park volunteers to explore in

<p>A<small>USTRALIA</small> has had no Columbus. It is even
doubtful if the first navigators who reached her shores set out
with any idea of discovering a great south land. At all events,
it would seem, their achievements were so little esteemed by
themselves and their countrymen, that no means were taken to
preserve their names in connexion with their discoveries. Holland
long had the credit of bringing to light the existence of that
island-continent, which until recent years was best known by her
name.</p>
<p>In 1861, however, Mr. Major, to whom we are indebted for more
recent research upon the subject, produced evidence which
appeared to demonstrate that the Portuguese had reached the
shores of Australia in 1601, five years before the Dutch yacht
<i>Duyphen</i>, or <i>Dove</i>,&mdash;the earliest vessel whose
name has been handed down&mdash;sighted, about March, 1606, what
is believed to have been the coast near Cape York. Mr. Major, in
a learned paper read before the Society of Antiquaries in 1872,
indicated the probability that the first discovery was made "in
or before the year 1531." The dates of two of the six maps from
which Mr. Major derives his information are 1531 and 1542. The
latter clearly indicates Australia, which is called Jave la
Grande. New Zealand is also marked. The other maps, though
without dates, doubtless relate to discoveries made a few years
earlier. Mr. Major, in kindly explaining these interesting
particulars to the author, also referred to a letter of Andrea
Corsali, a Florentine, written in 1515, which leaves little doubt
that Europeans had at that date got as far on the way to
Australia as Banda, if not New Guinea. In a subsequent paper, in
1873&mdash;the original report of the pretented discoverer in
1601 having been found in Brussels&mdash;Mr. Major charges this
Portuguese navigator, who claimed to have discovered, in 1601, a
southern land in the position of Australia, with gross imposture;
for he describes the country, which he calls Lu&ccedil;a Antara,
as containing many populous cities and towns, as abounding in
gold, and with inhabitants addicted to cock-fighting.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* "Further Facts relating to the Early Discovery
of Australia, communicated to the Society of Antiquaries." By
Richard Henry Major, Esq., F.S.A.]</p>
<p>Two of the six maps referred to by Mr. Major, as indicating an
early discovery of Australia, are probably those mentioned by
Captain Flinders in the introduction to his "Terra Australis",
where he says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Within these last few years, however, two curious
manuscript charts have been brought to light, which have favoured
an opinion that Terra Australis had really been visited by
Europeans nearly a century before any authentic accounts speak of
its discovery. One of these charts is in French, without date;
and, from its almost exact similitude, is probably either the
original, or a copy of the other which is in English, and bears,
with the date 1542, a dedication to the King of England. In it an
extensive country is marked to the southward of the Moluccas,
under the name of Great Java, which agrees nearer with the
position and extent of Terra Australis than with any other land;
and the direction given to some parts of the coast approaches too
near to the truth for the whole to have been marked from
conjecture alone. . . . . It may, at the same time, be admitted
that a part of the west and north-west coasts, where the
coincidence of form is most striking, might have been seen by the
Portuguese themselves, before the year 1540, in their voyages to
and from India."</blockquote>
<p>On turning to Admiral Burney's work,** to which Flinders
refers for the preceding statement, we find the history of the
early discovery of Australia thus summed up:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[** "Chronological History of Discoveries in the
South Sea or Pacific," published 1803.]</p>
<blockquote>"All these circumstances justify and support the
opinion that the northern and western coasts of New Holland were
known, and were the Great Java of the sixteenth century. There
are likewise reasons for supposing that the eastern coast had
been seen; but they are not sufficient to authorize the insertion
of any part of it in a chart of the discoveries made previous to
1579."</blockquote>
<p>Burney has little doubt that some of the land seen "by Torres
to the southward was part of the <i>Great Terra Australis</i>.
And what renders this more remarkable is that, in this same year,
1606, a Dutch vessel saw land in 13&frac34;&deg; S., which was
supposed to be a continuation of the land of Papua or New Guinea.
The furthest seen by the Hollanders was named by them Cape Keer
Weer (Cape Turn-Again). Accordingly, there is some reason to
believe that the <i>Great Terra Australis</i> was twice seen in
the year 1606, but, not being known as such, it cannot be said to
have been then discovered."</p>
<p>Further on in the same volume the writer says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Nothing was known with certainty concerning a
southern continent previous to the year 1616. The land seen in
1606 by the <i>Duyphen</i> yacht, and named Cape Keer Weer . . .
. was believed to be part of New Guinea; and a total ignorance
seems to have prevailed in the world concerning the navigation of
De Torres between New Guinea and the <i>Great Terra
Australis</i>, besides that Torres himself supposed all the land
seen by him to the south of New Guinea to be islands.<br>
<br>
"In the month of October, 1616, a ship named the
<i>Eendracht</i>, commanded by Theodoric Hertoge, being on her
passage outward bound from Holland to the East Indies, fell in
with land about 25&deg; S., which proved to be part of the
western coast of the <i>Great Terra Australis</i>."</blockquote>
<p>Though the date of the first discovery of Australia, and the
name of the man who made it, have passed into an oblivion which,
most probably, will never be penetrated, no such obscurity exists
with regard to the occasion on which civilized men first saw any
portion of that Australian territory of which we are going to
treat. Unless some unknown navigators have never returned to tell
the tale, or that all record of it has been lost, the famous
Captain, then Lieutenant, Cook and his comrades were the first to
set eyes upon the shores of the present colony of Victoria.</p>
<p>Sailing from Cape Farewell in New Zealand for the coast of
what was then supposed to be the peninsula of Van Diemen's Land,
the Endeavour, on the morning of Thursday, April 19th, 1770,
sighted land near Point Hicks, which was called after the first
lieutenant, who first saw it. The position of this headland is a
little to the west of Cape Howe, the eastern extremity of the
present colony. The great navigator did not stop to make any
investigations, or to solve the mystery about Tasmania; but he
turned away, and pursued his course along the east coast of
Australia, discovering Botany Bay, April 27th, Port Jackson on
the 6th, and Moreton Bay on the 16th May, and passing and naming
York Cape August 21st. On that day he also took possession of
"the whole eastern coast . . . . in right of his Majesty King
George the Third, by the name of New South Wales." He then
steered towards New Guinea.</p>
<p>A quarter of a century passed before anything was added to the
little knowledge of Victoria acquired by Cook's glance at her
coast. As, however, the earliest description, even though meagre,
of places and persons of interest must, convey first impressions
better than any subsequent writer can attempt, either more
briefly or fully, to describe them, the following extract from
"Cook's Voyage in 1770" should have a place in any complete
history of the discoveries which we have to narrate:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"<i>Wednesday</i>, 18<i>th</i>.&mdash;In the morning
of the 18th we saw two Port Egmont hens and a pintado bird, which
are certain signs of approaching land, and, indeed, by our
reckoning, we could not be far from it, for our longitude was now
one degree to the westward of the east side of Van Diemen's Land,
according to the longitude laid down by Tasman, whom we could not
suppose to have erred much in so short a run as from this land to
New Zealand; and by our latitude we could not be above fifty or
fifty-five leagues from the place where he took his departure.
All this day we had frequent squalls and a great swell.<br>
<br>
"<i>Thursday</i> 19<i>th</i>.&mdash;At one in the morning we
brought to and sounded, but had no ground with 130 fathoms. At
six we saw land extending from N.E. to W. at the distance of five
or six leagues, having eighty fathoms water with a fine sandy
bottom.<br>
<br>
"We continued standing westward, with the wind at S.S.W. till
eight, when we made all the sail we could, and hove away along
the shore N.E. for the easternmost land in sight, being at this
time in latitude 37&deg; 58' S. and longitude 210&deg; 39' W. The
southernmost point of land in sight, which bore from us W.
&frac14; S., I judged to lie in latitude 38&deg;, longitude
211&deg; 7', and gave it the name of Point Hicks, because Mr.
Hicks, the first lieutenant, was the first who discovered it. To
the southward of this point no land was to be seen, though it was
very clear in that quarter; and by our longitude, compared with
that of Tasman, not as it is laid down in the printed charts, but
in the extracts from 'Tasman's Journal', published by Rembrantse,
the body of Van Diemen's Land ought to have borne due south: and,
indeed, from the sudden falling of the sea after the wind abated,
I had reason to think it did; yet, as I did not see it, and as I
found this coast trend N.E. and S.W., or rather more to the
eastward, I cannot determine whether it joins to Van Diemen's
Land or not.<br>
<br>
"At noon we were in latitude 37&deg; 50', longitude 210&deg; 29'
W. The extremes of this land extended from N.W. to E.N.E., and a
remarkable point before N. 20 E. at the distance of about four
leagues. This point rises in a round hillock, very much
resembling the Earn Head at the entrance of Plymouth Sound, and
therefore I called it by the same name. The variation by an
azimuth taken this morning was 3&deg; 7' E., and what we had now
seen of the land appeared low and level; the sea-shore was a
white sand, but the country within was green and woody. About one
o'clock we saw three waterspouts at once; two were between us and
the shore, and the third at some distance upon our larboard
quarter. This phenomenon is so well known that it is net
necessary to give a particular description of it here.<br>
<br>
"At six o'clock in the evening we shortened sail and brought to
for the night, having fifty-six fathoms water, and a fine sandy
bottom. The northernmost land in sight then bore N.E. by E.
&frac12; E., and a small island lying close to a point on the
main bore W., distant two leagues. This point, which I called
Cape Howe, may be known by the trending of the coast, which is
north on one side and south-west on the other; it may also be
known by some round hills upon the main, just within it.<br>
<br>
"<i>Friday</i>, 20<i>th</i>.&mdash;-We brought to for the night,
and at four in the morning made sail along the shore to the
northward."</blockquote>
<p>Although nothing was done for so many years to decide whether
Tasmania was joined to Victoria&mdash;a question respecting which
Cook seems scarcely to have raised a doubt&mdash;the subject did
not wholly escape attention. The peninsula theory was evidently
shaken some years before it was finally refuted. The first to
question it seems to have been Captain John Hunter, who went out
with the colonizing expedition to Botany Bay, as second captain
of the <i>Sirius</i>, under Captain Phillip, whom he afterwards
succeeded as Governor of New South Wales. Hunter was sent in
command of that vessel for supplies to the Cape. He sailed from
Port Jackson, October 2nd 1788, and re-entered it May 9th, 1789.
On his return voyage he made the following
observation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"In passing (at a distance from the coast) between
the islands of Schooten and Furneaux and Point Hicks&mdash;the
former being the northernmost of Captain Furneaux's observations
here, and the latter the southernmost part which Captain Cook saw
when he sailed along the coast&mdash;there has been no land seen;
and from our having felt an easterly set of current, when the
wind was from that quarter (north-west), we had an uncommon large
sea; there is reason thence to believe that there is in that
space either a deep gulf or a strait which may separate Van
Diemen's Land from New Holland. There have no discoveries been
made on the western side of this land in the parallel I allude
to, between 39&deg; 00' and 42&deg; 00' S., the land there having
never been seen." ***</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[*** "Historical Journal of the Transactions at
Port Jackson and Norfolk Island. By Captain John Hunter,"
published 1793.]</p>
<p>Captain Vancouver, in a despatch * to Lord Grenville, dated
"<i>Discovery</i>, False Bay, Cape of Good Hope, August ye 9th,
1791," proposes to solve this geographical problem. He
says,&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* New South Wales Correspondence, Record
Office.]</p>
<blockquote>"Since receiving my instructions at Falmouth for the
prosecution of our voyage, I have much regretted not being
fortunate enough, in a further interview with your lordship, to
have gained your final opinion respecting the examination of that
extent of coast of the S.W. side of New Holland which in the
present age appears a real blot in geography, particularly when
we reflect on the many vessels that in this improved age of
navigation have passed the meridians, we have every reason to
suppose it occupies not more than 150 leagues to the south of it,
without endeavouring to bring home any further information
respecting that extensive country . . . ."</blockquote>
<p>After avowing his ambition to acquire "every knowledge of the
distant regions" he was going to visit, and stating that Cook's
chart of the Sandwich Islands had left him "but a small field to
occupy two winters in their further examination," he
says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"And likewise as when I had the honour of
communicating my wishes to prosecute such an examination, your
lordship seemed highly to approve of the idea, it is my intention
to fall in with the S.W. Cape of New Holland, and should I find
the shores capable of being navigated without much hazard, to
range its coast and determine whether it and Van Diemen's Land
are joined, which, from all information at present extant,
appears somewhat doubtful. I should be exceeding sorry to lose
this opportunity of throwing some light on the above subject,
having sufficient time before me to do it and reach the Sandwich
Islands, refresh, &amp;c., &amp;c., prior to proceeding on the
American coast, agreeable to my instructions.<br>
<br>
"I shall, however, prescribe this design with the utmost caution,
and, should I find it attended with intricacy and danger, ever
having the object of our voyage in view, abandon it and proceed
into the Pacific Ocean."</blockquote>
<p>How far Vancouver carried out his proposed exploration of the
Australian coast appears in a letter ** he addressed to Governor
Phillip at Sydney, dated "<i>Discovery</i> at sea, 15th of
October, 1792," and sent with another, headed "<i>Discovery</i>,
Monterrey, 29th December, 1792." In this document the navigator
thus briefly gives the first intimation of the existence of what
must ultimately become one of the most important harbours and
naval stations of the United Empire:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[** Record Office.]</p>
<blockquote>"On my passage into this ocean I visited a small part
of the S.W. coast of New Holland, and there discovered one very
excellent port, which I have honoured with the name of King
George the Third's Sound. As I think from the situation the
fertility of the country . . . . it may be worthy some further
attention."</blockquote>
<p>Having made this valuable addition to the geography of
Australia, he followed the coast as far as Termination Island in
long. 122&deg; 8'; but, there being indications of boisterous
weather, which he did not like to encounter on an unexplored
coast, he sailed for Tasmania, and, passing to the south of that
island as well as of New Zealand, one of his ships, the
<i>Chatham</i>, discovered the islands which bear her name.</p>
<p>Before coming to expeditions which were successfully carried
out, and some of which stand unsurpassed in the annals of
exploration, one great traveller must be mentioned as offering to
investigate the unknown regions of Australia. We cannot doubt
that he would have achieved great success; and how different
might have been his career had his proposal&mdash;which for some
reason was not acted upon&mdash;been carried out! It has been
forgotten, if it were ever publicly known, that Mungo Park
volunteered to proceed as an explorer to Australia. In the N. S.
Wales official correspondence,*** there is a letter to John King,
Esq., of the Treasury, dated May 15th, 1798, from Sir Joseph
Banks, communicating Park's offer and the very modest terms which
he annexed to it. Sir Joseph, after speaking about the
introduction of hops into N. S. Wales, and the fitting up of a
plant cabin in the <i>Porpoise</i>, which was about to sail for
that colony, remarks that, though the country had been possessed
"more than ten years, so much has the discovery of the interior
been neglected that no one article has hitherto been discovered,
by the importation of which the mother country can receive any
degree of return for the cost of founding and hitherto
maintaining the colony." He then proceeds as follows, with
respect to the exploration of the interior, and Mungo Park in
connexion with it:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Record Office.]</p>
<blockquote>"It is impossible to conceive that such a body of
land, as large as all Europe, does not produce vast rivers,
capable of being navigated into the heart of the interior, or, if
properly investigated, that such a country, situate in a most
fruitful climate, should not produce some native raw material of
importance to a manufacturing country as England is.<br>
<br>
"Mr. Mungo Park lately returned from a journey in Africa, where
he penetrated further into the inland than any European before
has done by several hundred miles, and discovered an immense
navigable river running westward, which offers the means of
penetrating into the centre of that vast continent, exploring the
nations that inhabit it, and monopolizing their trade to our
settlement at Senegambia, with a small force, and at an expense
which must be deemed inconsiderable when compared with the object
to be attained, offers himself as a volunteer to be employed In
exploring the interior of New Holland, by its rivers or
otherwise, as may in the event be found most expedient.<br>
<br>
"His moral character is unblemished, his temper mild, and his
patience inexhaustible, as he has proved during his African
expedition; he is sufficiently versed in astronomy to make and to
calculate observations to determine both latitude and longitude;
he knows geography enough to construct a map of the countries he
may visit, draws a little, has a complete knowledge of botany and
zoology, and has been educated in the medical line.<br>
<br>
"He is very moderate in his terms: he will be content with ten
shillings a day and his rations, and happy if his pay is settled
at twelve shillings. The amount of his outfit for instruments,
arms, presents, &amp;c., will not, I think, exceed 100<i>l</i>.
He will want a decked vessel of about thirty tons under the
command of a lieutenant, with orders to follow his advice in all
matters of exploring. Such a vessel may easily be built in the
country, if one already there, which is found to have very bad
qualities as a sea-boat, cannot be made sufficiently trustworthy;
and Lieutenant Flinders, a countryman of mine, a man of activity
and information, who is already there, will, I am sure, be happy
if he is intrusted with the command, and will enter into the
spirit of his orders, and agree perfectly with Park.<br>
<br>
"The crew of such a vessel need not, in my opinion, consist of
more than ten men&mdash;four for boat-keepers, and six to proceed
in the country with one or both the commanders, as may happen
when inland journeys are to be attempted.<br>
<br>
"If either or both these projects are carried into execution, I
will readily undertake to draw up instructions for all parties,
and to correspond with them during the execution of their plans,
under the superintendence of your office, such hopes have I of
material discoveries being made, and such zeal do I really feel
for the prosperity of a colony in the founding of which I bore a
considerable share."</blockquote>
<p>Had Mungo Park gone out to Australia at the time in question,
although he would have arrived too late to have anticipated the
great exploit of Bass, which we must next proceed to notice, he
would assuredly have reaped the laurels which have crowned other
discoverers; and there is little doubt that Victoria would have
formed an important part of the sphere of his explorations.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<h4>EXPEDITIONS OF BASS AND FLINDERS.</h4>
<p class="negindent">Two excursions in the <i>Tom
Thumb</i>&mdash;Famous voyage of Bass in the
whale-boat&mdash;Governor Hunter's despatch describing
it&mdash;Bass meets escaped convicts&mdash;Wilson's
Promontory&mdash;Western Port reached&mdash;Bass convinced of
existence of a Strait&mdash;Remarks of Flinders on the whale-boat
voyage&mdash;His visit to Furneaux Islands&mdash;He and Bass sail
round Tasmania in the <i>Norfolk</i>&mdash;Fate of Bass.</p>
<p>W<small>E</small> now come to the period when the exploration
of the territory of Victoria really commenced. Cook had sighted,
and sailed away from, the coast of our future colony. Eighteen
years later, Captain Phillip founded the first settlement in
Australia, at Port Jackson. He arrived at Botany Bay, January
18th, 1788,&mdash;a date which will ever be memorable as the day
on which the Anglo-Saxon race was first planted in the Great
South Land, and the foundation laid for one of the grandest and
most important extensions of the British Empire. For thirteen
years after this historic event, nothing was done to solve the
problem of the southern coast&mdash;the doubt respecting Tasmania
still continuing.</p>
<p>At length, in October, 1795, Flinders and Bass first started
in the direction in which they subsequently made their great
discoveries. Little had been added to the knowledge which Cook
had acquired of the coast to the south of Port Jackson, Indeed,
even in the near neighbourhood of Botany Bay, the country had not
been thoroughly investigated; for to throw further light upon it
was the object of the first expedition of Bass and Flinders.
Their boat, the <i>Tom Thumb</i>, was but eight feet long; and,
besides themselves, it was only manned by a boy. The result of
the journey was the tracing of the George River, which runs into
Botany Bay, twenty miles further than it had previously been
examined. On March 25th, 1796, the same gallant craft and crew
started again, and proceeded as far south as Port Hacking, which
they investigated, returning to Sydney, April 2nd, after meeting
with some hair-breadth escapes. At one time Bass had to keep the
sheet of the sail in his hand, whilst Flinders steered with the
oar, and the boy bailed out the water which washed in upon them;
and on another occasion, the surf, carrying the boat on to the
beach, completely drenched them and everything they had.</p>
<p>The expedition, in 1797-98, of Mr. George Bass, surgeon of the
<i>Reliance</i>, is one of the most remarkable in the annals of
adventurous discovery. The author regrets that he cannot narrate
it in the words of the explorer himself; but after seeking in
vain in all quarters in this country, where there seemed any
chance of Bass's original journal being found, and writing to
Sydney about it, he is obliged to give the facts of the
expedition second-hand, as stated by Flinders in his "Terra
Australis". Mr. Flinders Petrie, grandson of the distinguished
navigator, writes to the author in reply to his
inquiries,&mdash;"As to Bass's journal, I am as much in the dark
as you are." That this brave explorer made copious notes of his
voyage in the whaleboat, there can be no doubt, judging from the
fact that, when he afterwards sailed round Van Diemen's Land with
Flinders, he amply recorded his observations. Colonel Collins, in
his "Account of the English Colony in New South Wales," published
1802, says that he is able to enter, "with some degree of
minuteness, into the particulars" of the cruise round Van
Diemen's Land, "being enabled to do this from the accurate and
pleasing journal of Mr. Bass, with the perusal and use of which
he has been favoured."</p>
<p>The principal hope of Bass's journals being in existence is
that, like Grimes's report, they may be disinterred from among
the early official papers in Sydney. The one relating to the
Western Port expedition would be of much greater value than the
other which describes the voyage round Tasmania; for of that we
have the account of Flinders, the joint hero with Bass of the
enterprise. It does not appear, from the following despatch
relating to the former&mdash;the whale-boat&mdash;expedition,
that a copy of Bass's journal describing it was sent to this
country by Governor Hunter. That officer's letter to the Duke of
Portland, in the Record Office, would, therefore, seem to be the
earliest written account of the famous whale-boat voyage now
extant in this country, as far as the author has been able to
discover. This despatch, which appears never to have been
published, runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">"<i>Sydney, New South
Wales</i>,   <br>
"1<i>st March</i>, 1798.       </p>
<blockquote>"<small>MY LORD DUKE</small>,&mdash;The tedious
repairs which his Majesty's ship <i>Reliance</i> necessarily
required, before she could be put in a condition for going again
to sea, having given an opportunity to Mr. George Bass, her
surgeon&mdash;a young man of well-informed mind and an active
disposition&mdash;to offer himself to be employed in any way in
which he could contribute to the benefit of the public service, I
inquired of him in what way he was desirous of exerting himself,
and he informed me nothing could gratify him more effectually
than my allowing him the use of a good boat, and permitting him
to man her with volunteers from the King's ships. I accordingly
furnished him with an excellent whale-boat, well fitted,
victualled, and manned to his wish, for the purpose of examining
along the coast to the southward of this port, as far as he could
with safety and convenience go. His perseverance against diverse
winds, and almost incessant bad weather, led him as far south as
the latitude of 40&deg; 00', or a distance from this port, taking
the bendings of the coast, more than of 600 miles. He coasted the
greater part of the way, and sedulously examined every inlet
along the shore, which does not in these parts afford a single
harbour fit to admit even a small vessel, except a bay in
latitude 35&deg; 06' called Jarvis's Bay, and which was so named
by one of the transport ships bound here, who entered it, and is
the same called by Captain Cook 'Longnose Bay'; he explored every
accessible place until he came as far as the southernmost parts
of this coast, seen by Captain Cook, and from thence until he
reached the northernmost land, seen by Captain Furneaux, beyond
which he went westward about sixty miles, where the coast falls
away in a W.N.W. direction. Here he found an open ocean westward,
and by the mountainous sea which rolled from that quarter, and no
land discoverable in that direction, we have much reason to
conclude that there is an open strait through, between the
latitude 39&deg; and 40&deg; 12' S., a circumstance which, from
many observations made upon tides and currents thereabouts, I had
long conjectured.<br>
<br>
"It will appear by this discovery that the northernmost land seen
by Captain Furneaux is the southernmost extremity of this coast,
and lies in latitude 39&deg; 00' S. At the westward extremity of
Mr. Bass's coasting voyage he found a very good harbour, but
unfortunately the want of provision induced him to return sooner
than I wished and intended; and, on passing a small island laying
off the coast, he discovered a smoke, and supposed it to have
been made by some natives, with whom he wished to have an
opportunity of conversing. On approaching the shore, he found the
men were white and had some clothing on, and when he came near he
observed two of them take to the water and swim off. They proved
to be seven of a gang of fourteen who escaped from hence in a
boat on the 2nd of October last, mentioned in Letter No. 30, and
who had been treacherously left on this desolate island by the
other seven, who returned northward. The boat, it seems, was too
small for their whole number, and when they arrived at Broken Bay
they boarded another boat, the <i>Hawkesbury</i>, with fifty-six
bushels of wheat on board, and then went off with her northward,
leaving the old boat on shore.<br>
<br>
"These poor distressed wretches, who are chiefly Irish, would
have endeavoured to travel northward and thrown themselves upon
his Majesty's mercy, but were not able to get from this miserable
island to the mainland. Mr. Bass's boat was too small to
accommodate them with a passage, and as his provision was nearly
expended he could only help them to the mainland, where he
furnished them with a musket and ammunition and a pocket compass,
with lines and fish-hooks. Two of the seven were very ill, and
those he took into his boat, and shared his provision with the
other five, giving them the best directions in his power how to
proceed; the distance being not less than 500 miles, he
recommended them to keep along the coast, the better to enable
them to get food. Indeed, the difficulties of the country, and
the possibility of meeting hostile natives, are considerations
which will occasion doubts of their ever being able to reach us.
When they parted with Mr. Bass and his crew, who gave them what
clothes they could spare, some tears were shed on both sides. The
whale-boat arrived in this port after an absence of twelve weeks,
and Mr. Bass delivered to me his observations on this adventurous
expedition. I find he made several excursions into the interior
of the country, wherever he had an opportunity. It will be
sufficient to say that he found, in general, a barren,
unpromising country, with very few exceptions; and, were it even
better, the want of harbours would render it less valuable.<br>
<br>
"Whilst this whale-boat was absent, I had occasion to send the
colonial schooner to the southward, to take on board the
remaining property saved from the wreck of the ship <i>Sydney
Cove</i>, and to take the crew from the island she had been cast
upon. I sent in the schooner Lieut. Flinders of the
<i>Reliance</i> (a young man well qualified), in order to give
him an opportunity of making what observations he could among
those islands; and the discovery which was made there by him and
Mr. Hamilton, the master of the wrecked ship, shall be annexed to
those of Mr. Bass in one chart, and forwarded to your grace
herewith, by which I presume it will appear that the land called
Van Diemen's, and generally supposed to be the southern
promontory of this country, is a group of islands separated from
its southern coast by a strait, which it is probable may not be
of narrow limits, but may perhaps be divided into two or more
channels by the islands near that on which the <i>Sydney Cove</i>
was wrecked.*</blockquote>

<p>The following particulars respecting the expedition in
question are gathered from Flinders's "Terra Australis". In the
evening of December 3rd, 1797, Bass set out on his voyage with a
crew of six seamen and six weeks' provisions. On the 19th he
discovered Twofold Bay, and next day rounded Cape Howe, and thus
Victoria was again seen by white men, who were perhaps the very
first to set foot upon her soil; for in the evening Bass landed
"at the entrance of a lagoon, one mile north of Ram Head." Here a
gale detained him for ten days, the time being spent in examining
the country, of which he did not favourably report.</p>
<p>Renewing his voyage, December 31st, Bass proceeded beyond Ram
Head much more than fifteen leagues&mdash;the distance from it at
which Point Hicks was marked&mdash;but he could recognize "no
point of projection which would be distinguishable from a ship."
By noon next day he calculated he had run upwards of a hundred
miles. A more southerly course was then taken, and the boat
reached what the explorer supposed was Furneaux's Land, but which
he afterwards became convinced was Wilson's Promontory&mdash;so
named by Governor Hunter, on the joint recommendation of Flinders
and Bass, after Thomas Wilson, Esq., of London, a friend of the
former.</p>
<p>Having, on January 3rd, 1798, visited one of the adjacent
islands, where he found the convicts who had run off with the
boat from Sydney, Bass coasted along the mainland, and, after
rounding an open bay, on the 4th reached Western Port, which,
according to the boat's run, he considered to be about sixty
miles N.W. by W. &frac12; W. from his supposed Furneaux's Land,
and in about latitude 38&deg; 25' S. Here the gallant explorer
repaired his noble little craft, and made an examination of the
port. Water was found with difficulty, and was brackish
everywhere, except in the winding creek on the east side of the
port. Only four natives were seen, and but few kangaroo; "black
swans went by hundreds in a flight, and ducks&mdash;a small but
excellent kind&mdash;by thousands."</p>
<p>After being detained in Western Port till January 18th&mdash;a
week over the time for which he had been provisioned&mdash;Bass
was reluctantly obliged to turn back, otherwise he would
doubtless have been the discoverer of Port Phillip Bay, which was
within an easy day's reach of him. During the first night of his
return journey, he was obliged to shelter behind a cape,
afterwards named Liptrap. Next morning, running down to the
islands west of Wilson's Promontory, he was again obliged to seek
shelter at Cape Liptrap, where a succession of gales detained him
for a week. During this delay he salted a quantity of petrels,
with which he had at the islands replenished his supply of
provisions.</p>
<p>Starting again on the 26th, Bass took five of the seven
escaped convicts, whom, on his outward journey, he had found on
an island, and, landing them on the mainland, gave them
directions how to steer for Sydney. He also assisted them with a
few things he could spare. The other two, who were unequal to
attempt an overland journey of five hundred miles, he took with
him in the boat. These convicts were probably the first white men
to see the coast up to this point where Bass found them. On
February 3rd, he fell in with the five at the Corner Inlet, but
nothing more was ever heard of them.</p>
<p>Wilson's Promontory was rounded on the 26th, and another
detention till Feb. 1st took place in Sealer's Cove. The explorer
utilized this time by examining the promontory. Flinders remarks,
in passing it in the <i>Investigator</i>, on his way out from
England in 1802, that the adjacent islands were "laid down upon
my chart of 1799, on the authority of Mr. Bass; and when it is
considered that this enterprising man saw them from an open boat
in very bad weather, their relative position to Wilson's
Promontory will be thought surprisingly near the truth.
Unfortunately the situation of the promontory itself, owing to
some injury done to his quadrant, is considerably in error, being
twelve or fourteen miles wrong in latitude."</p>
<p>Speaking of the current which ran at Wilson's Promontory at
from two to three miles an hour, Bass in his journal&mdash;the
words of which are given in inverted commas by
Flinders&mdash;says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Whenever it shall be decided that the opening
between this and Van Diemen's Land is a strait, this rapidity of
tide, and the long south-west swell that seems to be continually
rolling in upon the coast to the westward, will then be accounted
for."</blockquote>
<p>On Feb. 2nd Bass sailed to Corner Inlet, and was again
detained until the 9th by those adverse winds which had so much
impeded him, and which next day once more stopped his
progress&mdash;this time with so much severity that he was
obliged to retreat to the beach through a heavy surf, in lat.
which he made to be 37&deg; 47' S. There the natives, who
appeared to have never seen or heard of white men, paid the
explorer a friendly visit. At daylight on the 11th the brave boat
was again launched, and at four in the afternoon anchored under
the Ram Head, where there was another delay till the evening of
the 14th, when a favourable breeze suddenly sprung up, and at ten
o'clock carried the explorers past Cape Howe, and by noon of the
15th to Twofold Bay. On the night of Feb. 24th, 1798, this
wonderful voyage was terminated by the safe arrival of Bass and
his crew within the splendid harbour of Sydney.</p>
<p>Captain Flinders speaks in suitable terms of the great exploit
of his friend. He remarks that,&mdash;"In the three hundred miles
of coast from Port Jackson to Ram Head, he added a number of
particulars which had escaped Captain Cook." Flinders then sums
up the new discoveries made by Bass:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Our previous knowledge of the coast scarcely
extended beyond Earn Head, and there began the harvest in which
Mr. Bass was ambitious to place the first reaping-hook. The new
coast was traced 300 miles, and instead of travelling southward
to join itself to Van Diemen's Land, as Captain Furneaux had
supposed, he found it, beyond a certain point, to take a
direction nearly opposite, and to assume the appearance of being
exposed to the buffetings of an open sea. Mr. Bass himself
entertained no doubt of the existence of a wide strait separating
Van Diem en '8 Land from New South Wales; and he yielded with the
greatest reluctance to the necessity of returning, before it was
so fully ascertained as to admit of no doubt in the mind of
others. But he had the satisfaction of placing at the end of his
new coast an extensive and useful harbour, surrounded with a
country superior to any other known in the southern parts of New
South Wales.<br>
<br>
"A voyage <i>expressly</i> undertaken for discovery in an open
boat, and in which 600 miles of coast, mostly in a boisterous
climate, was explored, has not, perhaps, its equal in the annals
of maritime history. The public will award to its high-spirited
and able conductor&mdash;alas! now no more&mdash;an honourable
place in the list of those whose ardour stands most conspicuous
for the promotion of useful knowledge."</blockquote>
<p>The names of Bass's six attendants in the whale-boat ought to
be recorded; but that of only one of them seems to have been
preserved. Flinders mentions that Mr. Thistle, who with seven
others was drowned in the accident to the cutter of the
<i>Investigator</i> at Cape Catastrophe, at the entrance to
Spencer's Gulf, had made the voyages to Western Port and round
Van Diemen's Land.</p>
<p>While Bass was absent, Flinders left Port Jackson, on Feb.
1st, in the <i>Francis</i>, commanded by Captain Hamilton, and of
which schooner Mr. Reed was master, to bring away the people and
cargo remaining with the wreck of the ship <i>Sydney Cove</i> on
Preservation Island, one of the Furneaux Group. On the outward
voyage, the coast was sighted about Cape Howe, as well as in
other places, and Wilson's Promontory was seen. On Feb. 25th,
when setting out to return to Sydney, Flinders says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"It was still a matter of doubt whether the land to
the south of the islands was or was not a part of Van Diemen's
Land, and I therefore requested Mr. Reed to make a stretch that
way. At noon our latitude was 40&deg; 44&#8532;', and the peak of
Cape Barren bore N. 13&deg; E. . . .<br>
<br>
"We stretched on until the land was seen beyond 40&deg; 50', and
then veered to the northward. In this latitude Captain Furneaux
says, 'the land trenches away to the westward'; and as he traced
the coast from the south end of the country to this port, there
could no longer be a doubt that it was joined to the land
discovered by Tasman in 1642. The smokes which had constantly
been seen rising from it showed that there were inhabitants; and
this, combined with the circumstance of there being none upon the
islands, seemed to argue the junction of Van Diemen's Land with
New South Wales, for it was difficult to suppose that men should
have reached the more distant land, and not have attained the
islands intermediately situated; nor was it admissible that,
having reached them, they had perished for want of food. On the
other hand, the great strength of the tides setting westward,
past the islands, could only be caused by some exceedingly deep
inlet, or by a passage through to the southern Indian Ocean.
These contradictory circumstances were very embarrassing; and,
the schooner not being placed at my disposal, I was obliged, to
my great regret, to leave this important geographical question
undecided. At the time we veered to the northward, the coast of
Van Diemen's Land was about three miles distant."</blockquote>
<p>When Flinders reached Sydney again in the <i>Francis</i>,
March 9th, he found that Bass had been back a fortnight from his
famous whale-boat expedition. The former says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"He communicated all his notes and observations to be
added to my chart. There seemed to want no other proof of the
existence of a passage between New South Wales and Van Diemen's
Land than that of sailing positively through it."</blockquote>
<p>The demonstration of this fact, being clearly part of the
history of the discovery of Victoria, must now be briefly
noticed. Flinders gives his own account of the voyage in his
"Terra Australis," and Collins in his "Account of the English
Colony in N. S. Wales," vol ii., published twelve years earlier,
in 1802, enters "with some degree of minuteness into the
particulars . . . from the accurate and pleasing journal of Mr.
Bass." It appears that on Oct. 7th, 1798, the colonial sloop
<i>Norfolk</i>, of twenty-five tons, left Port Jackson on her
important voyage of discovery. She is called by Collins "the
small-decked boat" and "long-boat". She carried Flinders and
Bass, and, to use the words of the former, "an excellent crew of
eight volunteers from the king's ships." She was provisioned for
twelve weeks. The brig <i>Nautilus</i> sailed in company with her
on a sealing expedition to Furneaux Islands. Twofold Bay was
visited and examined by Flinders and Bass. Continuing their
voyage on the 14th, they reached Kent's Group on the 17th. They
were detained by adverse winds for some days at the Furneaux
Islands, some of which Bass explored, and, as appears in
Collins's work, minutely described, whilst Flinders made
soundings.</p>
<p>At length, Nov. 1st, they reached the north coast of Van
Diemen's Land, and steered westward along it, at a distance of
from two and a half to three miles. Port Dalrymple, where
Launceston now exists, was entered on the 3rd and quitted on the
20th; but next day a gale from the west drove the <i>Norfolk</i>
back to Furneaux Islands, from whence she was not able to renew
her course till Dec. 3rd. On the 6th, Circular Head was passed,
and Flinders remarks,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"From the time of leaving Port Dalrymple no tide had
been observed until this morning. It ran with us and continued
until three o'clock, at which time low land was seen beyond the
three hummocks. This trending of the coast so far to the north
made me apprehend that it might be found to join the land near
Western Port, and thus disappoint our hopes of discovering an
open passage to the westward; the water was also discoloured, as
if we were approaching the head of a bay rather than the issue of
a strait, and, on sounding, we had seventeen and afterwards
fifteen fathoms."</blockquote>
<p>An extraordinary flight of sooty petrels,** which the
discoverers observed Dec. 9th, will justify a short digression.
Flinders writes,&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[** Or Mutton-birds.]</p>
<blockquote>"There was a stream of from fifty to eighty yards in
depth, and of 300 yards or more in breadth; the birds were not
scattered, but flying as compactly as a free movement of their
wings seemed to allow; and during a full <i>hour and a half</i>
this stream of petrels continued to pass without interruption, at
a rate little inferior to the swiftness of the pigeon. On the
lowest computation I think the number could not have been less
than a hundred million."</blockquote>
<p>In a note it is calculated that,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Taking the stream to have been fifty yards deep by
three hundred in width, and that it moved at the rate of thirty
miles an hour, and allowing nine cubic yards of space to each
bird, the number would amount to 151,500,000. The burrows
required to lodge this quantity of birds would be 75,750,000;
and, allowing a square yard to each burrow, they would cover
something more than 18&frac12; geographic square miles of
ground."</blockquote>
<p>On this day, Dec. 9th, passing between the mainland and Three
Hummock Island, one of the group to which the discoverers gave
the name of Governor Hunter, Flinders says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"A long swell was perceived to come from the
south-west, such as we had not been accustomed to for some time.
It broke heavily upon a small reef lying a mile and a half from
the point, and upon all the western shores; but, although it was
likely to prove troublesome and perhaps dangerous, Mr. Bass and
myself hailed it with joy and mutual congratulation, as
announcing the completion of our long-wished-for discovery of a
passage into the Southern Indian Ocean."</blockquote>
<p>Colonel Collins gives in inverted commas a brief extract from
Bass's account of this discovery. This, therefore, and the
sentence previously given about the currents at Wilson's
Promontory, contain the only words descriptive of his remarkable
voyages which we can feel certain are the explorer's own. Collins
proceeds,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Mr. Bass says (with all the feeling and spirit of an
explorer) that 'he already began to taste the enjoyment resulting
from the completion of this discovery, which had been commenced
in the whale-boat under a complication of anxieties, hazard, and
fatigue, known only to those who conducted her,' modestly sharing
the praises to which he alone was entitled with those who
accompanied him.<br>
<br>
"It was worthy of remark (Mr. Bass says) that the northern shore
of the strait from Wilson's Promontory (seen in the whale-boat)
to Western Port resembled the bluff bold shore of an open sea,
with a swell rolling in, and a large surf breaking upon it; while
the southern shore, or what is the coast of Van Diemen's Land,
appeared like the inner shore of a cluster of islands, whose
outer parts break off the great weight of the sea. The cause of
this is immediately obvious, on recollecting that the swell of
the Indian Ocean enters the strait from the southward of west.
The greater part of the southern shore is a bight, whose western
extreme is Hunter's Isles and the north-west cape of Van Diemen's
Land. Now, as the swell comes from the southward as well as
westward, it must, after striking the north-west part of the
southern shore, evidently run on in a direction somewhat diagonal
with the two sides of the strait until it expends itself upon the
northern shore, where both swell and surf are found. But to the
southward of this diagonal line the swell must quickly take off,
and totally disappear, long before it can reach the shore to make
a surf. Hence arises the difference.<br>
<br>
"That the swell of the Indian Ocean comes, by far the greater
part of the way, from the southward of west can hardly be
doubted, since it is well known that the prevailing winds are
from that quarter."</blockquote>
<p>Thus was solved the problem of the insularity of Van Diemen's
Land. On Dec. 9th its N.W. extremity, named by Flinders, from its
appearance, Cape Grim, was passed, and, following the trending of
the coast, a southern course was taken. The <i>Norfolk</i>
anchored at the entrance of the Derwent on the 21st, and next day
proceeded up the river for about twelve miles. On January 3rd,
1799, she again put to sea, and, after quitting Van Diemen's Land
and its adjacent islands, sighted the Australian coast on the
9th, somewhere near Ram Head. On the evening of the 11th
according to Flinders, and the 12th according to Collins, anchor
was cast inside Port Jackson, the discoverers having, as the
former remarks, "exceeded, by no more than eleven days, the time
which had been fixed for our return."</p>
<p>Both Flinders and Collins record that, on the return of the
<i>Norfolk</i>, Governor Hunter&mdash;who, we have seen, was one
of the first to suggest doubts as to the peninsula
theory&mdash;paid a just "tribute" to the services of Bass by
calling the new strait after him.</p>
<p>In July of the same year the Norfolk, which derived her name
from the island where she was built, was employed by Flinders in
the investigation of Morton Bay.</p>
<p>Having now reached the end of the achievements of Bass as an
explorer, it only remains to express regret that the career of a
man of so much promise should have been so early closed. His fate
is not quite certain; but, having been taken prisoner by the
Spaniards in South America, he is believed to have been sent to
work in the mines, and there to have died.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> discoveries of Lieutenant Grant, in command
of the <i>Lady Nelson</i>, are next in order of date. An account
of them was published in London in 1803.* The particulars
contained in this chapter are; derived from that work, except
where other sources of information are indicated. Grant begins by
dilating upon the advantages of the sliding keels possessed by
the <i>Lady Nelson</i>&mdash;an invention which he informs us was
made in America, during the War of Independence, by his friend
Captain John Schank, "of the Royal Navy, formerly one of the
Commissioners of the Transport Board." The name of this gentleman
is borne by the well-known Cape in Victoria. A very good plate of
the <i>Lady Nelson</i> is given in the work; and certainly
everything connected with this historical little craft&mdash;her
achievements and ultimate fate&mdash;deserves to be bound up with
the history of that important territory of the Empire, so large a
portion of the coasts of which were first discovered and made
known to the world by her officers and crew.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The title of the volume is "The Narrative of a
Voyage of Discovery performed in his Majesty's Vessel the <i>Lady
Nelson</i>, of Sixty Tons Burden, with Sliding Keels, in the
Years 1800, 1801, and 1802, to New South Wales. By James Grant,
Lieutenant in the Royal Navy." Published 1803.]</p>
<p>It appears that on the thirteenth day of the present century,
"the <i>Lady Nelson</i> hauled out of Deadman's Dock into the
river, having her complement of men, stores, and provisions on
board," and that the latter "were of the best kind," and
"calculated for fifteen men for nine months, and the water for
six months." She was also "supplied with abundance of
anti-scorbutics." His ship arrived at Gravesend on the 16th, and
Grant expresses satisfaction at her working so well, but, he
adds, "few who saw us pass that did not say something against so
small a vessel destined for a long voyage. The general
appellation we got was that of his Majesty's
<i>Tinder-box</i>."</p>
<p>The Downs were reached on the 20th, where a very large convoy
had been lying at anchor nearly a month, detained by westerly
winds. There, on the night of the 23rd, the little vessel gave
good promise of her capabilities to encounter the storms she had
to meet, by riding out a gale which drove six of her companion
ships on shore; on the 26th she rode out another, and then ran
into Ramsgate harbour, where she was detained till the evening of
February 7th. Spithead was reached on the 8th, and Portsmouth
harbour on the 9th. At Gosport she received four "brass carriage
guns. . . . from three to four pounders," in addition to the two
on board, and was so fully furnished with small-arms, ammunition,
provisions, supplies, &amp;c., as to become very deep in the
water, "insomuch," says Grant, "that we had only two feet nine
inches clear abreast the gangway. Many people who saw the <i>Lady
Nelson</i> reckoned her unfit for so long a voyage, which gave me
much trouble to keep the crew together." Grant, however, observed
to Captain Schank, who visited the ship before her departure,
"that a short time at sea, with the consumption of fuel and
provisions, would bring us to the proper equilibrium."</p>
<p>Having from this cause, and from the demand for their
services, lost some of his crew, Grant left Portsmouth on March
17th, with a convoy under Captain Durham of the <i>Anson</i>, and
on 18th they took their departure from Dunnose in the Isle of
Wight. On the 20th, the convoy fleet got away from the <i>Lady
Nelson</i>, and she was taken in tow by "the <i>Brunswick</i>,
East Indiaman, commanded by Captain Grant," but on the 23rd, in
consequence of the increase of the wind, the ships were
disconnected, the people on board the <i>Brunswick</i> supposing
that Grant intended returning to Spithead, "as deeming it
impracticable to go on."</p>
<p>There was not much reason to apprehend danger from enemies'
ships, as appears from the first of the three following letters
** of instruction. It is dated Whitehall, February 21st, 1800,
and addressed to Grant:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[** In the Record Office.]</p>
<blockquote>"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;I transmit to you,
enclosed, the open Instructions which, by his Majesty's commands,
I have given to the Governor of New South Wales, and which are to
be followed in making the surveys and discoveries for which the
<i>Lady Nelson</i>, under your command, has been fitted out and
provided. As vessels fitted out for this purpose have always been
respected by the nations of Europe, notwithstanding actual
hostilities may at the time have existed between them; and as
their country has always manifested the greatest attention to
other nations on similar occasions, as you will perceive by the
letters written in favour of vessels employed in discoveries by
France and Spain, copies of which you receive enclosed, I have no
apprehension whatever of your suffering any hindrance or
molestation from the ships of either of those nations, should you
fall in with them; with this view and the better to secure you
against all hostility or interruption, the instructions enclosed,
as well as this letter, are both left open, and you are to keep
them so. You are also, on pain of his Majesty's utmost
displeasure, to refrain on your part from making any prize of, or
from detaining or molesting the ships of any other nation,
although they may be at war with his Majesty.</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="center">"I am, &amp;c.,</p>
<p align="right"><small>"PORTLAND."</small>   </p>
<p>The Duke's next letter, of February 26th, 1800, to the
Governor of New South Wales, is important as directing the
movements of the <i>Lady Nelson</i>, not only on her outward
voyage, but in her subsequent explorations. The instructions
are:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;You will receive this by
the sloop, the <i>Lady Nelson</i>, which has been constructed and
fitted out for the purpose of prosecuting the discovery and
survey of the unknown parts of the coast of New Holland, and of
ascertaining, as far as is practicable, the hydrography of that
part of the globe.<br>
<br>
"The <i>Lady Nelson</i> is provided with a complete set of
instruments, and every other article necessary for the attainment
of that object, which are consigned to you, and are conformable
to the enclosed list.<br>
<br>
"You are to take care to furnish the officer employed under you
in this service with the necessary instructions, wherein you will
particularly take care that he be directed to examine with
diligence, and to survey and plan, with as much accuracy as
circumstances will permit, all such coasts; and you will order
him to take and lay down upon his chart all such soundings as he
shall think likely to prove useful for the guidance of those who
may navigate along those shores in future, to pay especial regard
to the examination and accurate delineation of all such harbours
as he shall discover and judge to be commodious for the reception
of shipping, and also of such shoals and other dangers as he may
from time to time meet with; to fix in all cases, when in his
power, the positions, both in latitude and longitude, of
remarkable headlands, bays, and harbours by astronomical
observations; also to observe the variation of the needle and the
right direction and course of the tides and currents, and to
record all such observations in his journal with the most minute
exactness.<br>
<br>
"The survey of the Southern or South-Western coast of the country
appears to be of the most immediate importance. The probable
benefits of the whale fishery, and the shortening the passage
through the Straits, which are discovered to exist between the
main and the group of islands known at present by the name of Van
Diemen's Land, would be of high importance. The group of islands,
themselves affording (as one of them is known to do) an excellent
harbour, is worthy of particular attention. When any considerable
river is discovered, you are to order him to navigate up the same
as far as the <i>Lady Nelson</i> can proceed with safety,
carefully planning the course and the banks of it, and noting the
soundings as he proceeds, and to land as often as he sees reason
to suppose that any considerable variation has taken place either
in the productions of the soil or the customs of the inhabitants,
and to examine the country as far inland as he shall think it
prudent to venture with the small number of persons who can be
spared from the charge of the vessel, whenever there appears to
him a probability of discovering anything useful to the commerce
or manufactories of Great Britain. He will note in his journal,
in all places where he shall land, either on the sea coast or the
banks of a river, his opinion of the comparative fertility of the
soil, which may best be judged of by the size of the trees and
the degree of vigour with which trees, shrubs, and plants appear
to him to grow; as also such articles of the produce of the soil
and the manners of the inhabitants as he shall deem worthy of
notice; and in all places which appear to him of any importance
to Great Britain, either on account of the shelter for shipping
or the probable utility of the produce of the soil, he is to take
possession in his Majesty's name, with the consent of the
inhabitants, if any, under a discharge of musquetry and
artillery, and to record the whole proceedings at length both in
his log-book and his journal; and, if uninhabited, to set up some
proper inscription as first discoverer and possessor. He is to
plant such seeds of fruit-trees and useful vegetables as he shall
be supplied with, near to such landing-places as he may discover,
in which a safe and commodious anchorage and easy landing render
it likely that ships may hereafter frequent, and where the soil
appears most fertile and productive; and to collect in all places
such seeds of trees, plants, shrubs, and grasses as he shall find
in a state of maturity, and judge to be worthy of notice, either
from their beauty, their particularity, or their possible
utility; and to collect such specimens of vegetables, animals,
and minerals as he shall think likely to prove interesting to
naturalists at home.<br>
<br>
"In case of any person being sent with him to assist him as a

Britain. He is, however, to deliver to you on his return the

<p>But, to notice the leading incidents of the voyage before the
<i>Lady Nelson</i> reached the fields of discovery&mdash;two days
after parting from the <i>Brunswick</i>, she was chased by the
<i>Hussar</i> frigate, in charge of a West Indian convoy, on
suspicion of being an enemy's cruiser, and next day some of the
ships of the convoy, in like manner, mistook the <i>Lady
Nelson</i>, and did their best to get out of her way, "One of
them," says Grant, "much to his credit, hove to and fired a shot,
almost plump on board of us. After hoisting his colours, I showed
him ours, when he stood on. Another vessel, the <i>Hope of
Liverpool</i>, I could hardly keep clear of; for the more I
endeavoured to avoid him, the more he attempted to get near me,
insomuch that we were near running on board each other. He asked
me very haughtily who I was and where I came from; I replied by
hoisting my pendant and colours. Nevertheless, he was not
satisfied, and, as he had no force, I believe he intended, if he
could, to have run me down."</p>
<p>On April 13th, Grant put into St. Jago, which he left on the
27th. Here two lads of the crew made off with one of the boats,
but were captured by the Portuguese authorities and conducted
into the town, "both riding on one ass," amidst "the ridicule of
the inhabitants". The second mate, who had sown the seeds of
disaffection, was delivered to the Governor to be put on board
the first British vessel. With the Governor's permission, also,
there were "entered on the ship's books two young men, making up
the crew to twelve in all." Grant afterwards speaks of his
sailors as "young and inexperienced lads," but says "they had
become so alert and attentive . . . . as to demand my highest
praise." He describes an unsuccessful expedition he made in the
island to shoot wild guinea-fowl.</p>
<p>During the progress of the voyage to the Cape, a brig was met,
whose captain came on board, and, Grant records, "asked one of my
men whether I was not a little mad, for he could not credit the
story, I told him of our going on a voyage of discovery." On July
8th, anchor was cast in Table Bay, and on 17th in Simon's Bay.
Though upwards of a hundred days out, the <i>Lady Nelson</i>
sustained no loss or damage of canvas, spars, or boats, but her
sliding-keels were broken off.</p>
<p>Before she left the Cape, a ship called the <i>Wellesley</i>
arrived with Government stores. Having parted from her convoy,
she was attacked, but with the aid of the passengers beat off a
French vessel. Grant mentions that the <i>Wellesley</i> brought
directions to him to proceed through Bass's Straits, and they are
doubtless those contained in the letter, the date of which, being
subsequent to the sailing of the <i>Lady Nelson</i> from England,
at first puzzled the author, when he procured this copy of the
document at the Record Office:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">"<i>Whitehall</i>, 5<i>th
April</i>, 1800.<br></p>
<blockquote>"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;Having received
information from Port Jackson, in New South Wales, that a
navigable strait has been discovered between that country and Van
Diemen's Land, in latitude 38&deg;, which has been lately passed
through by a lieutenant of the <i>Reliance</i>, who afterwards
returned round the South Cape, it is his Majesty's pleasure that
you should sail through the said strait in your way to Port
Jackson, by which means you will not only shorten your voyage,
but will have an opportunity of more minutely surveying the said
strait, and of applying your instructions, as far as
circumstances will admit of it, to this part of your
route.</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="center">"I am, &amp;c.,</p>
<p align="right"><small>"PORTLAND."</small>   </p>
<p>Grant says that, while at the Cape, he "was often teazed with
groundless fears and apprehensions formed by idle people, on
account of the seas which so small and singularly constructed a
vessel as mine had to encounter in the run from the Cape to New
Holland. However, the winter passage we had already made with so
much safety, joined to the good opinion the crew entertained of
the <i>Lady Nelson</i>, and their determination not to quit me,
brought us many visitors and numbers of volunteers from different
ships in the bay." He, however, declined all offers, "to the
disappointment of many," except of an eccentric Dr. Brandt, whom
he received on board, together with his baboon and dog, and also
a carpenter, of whom he was in need. To oblige Admiral Sir Roger
Curtis, he also consented to convey a Dane, who was sentenced to
transportation to New South Wales, but whose emancipation he
obtained soon after his arrival&mdash;the man having behaved
remarkably well during the voyage.</p>
<p>On October 7th, Grant took his departure from the Cape, having
"bid adieu to many who came down to see the <i>little</i> vessel
depart, most of whom entertained doubts of our ever reaching New
South Wales."</p>
<p>November 2nd, the Island of Amsterdam was passed, an
ineffectual attempt being made to gain the anchoring ground.</p>
<p>The long. on November 23rd was 130&deg;E., lat. 38&deg; 31' S.
They "had now crossed Captain Vancouver's track, which is the
farthest eastward of any laid down in this parallel of latitude."
In the evening of December 2nd, "one of those long flies, known
by the name of horse-stingers, came on board, and," Grant says,
"was a stronger proof of land being near than any we had yet
seen." At eight next morning it was visible "right ahead,
appearing like unconnected islands, being four in number, distant
six or seven leagues." Grant calculated the western point of land
to lie in 142&deg; E.</p>
<p>The following is a copy of the original report of the
discovery of an extensive portion of the coast of Victoria,
furnished by Grant to Governor King. Although published by the
former in his account of the voyage, it is desirable that it
should be reproduced, as the work is old and scarce, and there is
some little difference between it and the MS. report. It will be
observed that many of the names originally given by Grant are
still retained, though some have disappeared from the map of the
Colony. A pen and ink chart is attached to the MS., similar to
that printed in Grant's book. A blank is left in the coast-line
in the vicinity of Port Phillip; the gulf or bight immediately
outside it is marked Governor King's Bay, and the gulf from
Wilson's Promontory to Western Port is called King George's
Sound&mdash;a name which Grant, in the account of his subsequent
voyage to Western Port, says it scarcely deserved. The gulf
extending between Cape Otway and Wilson's Promontory is
represented as forming a much deeper indentation of the coast
than actually exists.</p>
<blockquote>"Remarks *** on board the <i>Lady Nelson</i>, by
Lieutenant James Grant, on coming in with the land of New
Holland:&mdash;</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[*** N. S. Wales Correspondence, Record
Office.]</p>
<blockquote>"<i>December</i> 3, 1800.&mdash;At daybreak, made all
possible sail, judging myself to be in latitude 38&deg; South.*
At 8 a.m. saw the land from N. to E.N.E., the part that was right
ahead appearing like unconnected islands, being four in number,
which, on our nearer approach, turned out to be two capes and two
high mountains, a considerable way inshore, one of them being
like the Table Hill at the Cape of Good Hope; the other stands
further in the country. Both are covered with large trees, as is
also the land, which is low and flat as far as the eye can reach.
I have called the first of these hills Schanks Mountain, and the
second Gambiers Mountain. The cape I call Cape Northumberland.
Also another smaller but conspicuous jut of the land, which we
plainly saw when abreast of Cape Northumberland, I named Cape
Banks. When Cape Northumberland bears N.W. by W., distant eight
or nine miles, Schanks Mountain bearing north, and Gambiers N. by
E. from you, Schanks Mountain loses its table form and appears
like a saddle. There does not appear to be any harbour so far,
but there may be shelter under Cape Northumberland from N. and
N.N.W. winds, as also between Cape Banks and it from easterly
winds. The shore is in general a flat sandy beach, the sea at
present making no breach upon it.</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* In margin&mdash;"Longitude worked back
141&deg; 20' E."]</p>
<blockquote>"<i>December</i> 4.&mdash;As we stood along the
shore, steering east, saw the land as far as we could see,
bearing S.E.; hauled close up for it. This forming a conspicuous
cape, I named it Cape Bridgewater in honour of his Grace the Duke
of Bridgewater. At seven, little wind and a heavy sea. The shore
is a sandy beach, from where we made the land to this cape, and
flat land covered with brushes and large woods inland. Found we
could not weather Cape Bridgewater. Tacked occasionally, and got
four oars on the lee side, which I kept employed all night; a
heavy swell and baffling light winds from S.S.W. to S.E. In the
morning, by day-break, weathered the cape six or seven miles,
when another cape appeared bearing east by north about fifteen or
sixteen miles distant, forming, with Cape Bridgewater, a very
deep bay, and to appearance had shelter for anchorage, though
much heavy swell. I was anxious to examine whether it was safe to
enter in or not; the land appeared beautiful, rising gradually,
full of woods. I being in doubt of clearing the shore, made me
more anxious. I accordingly out boats and took with me two hands
armed; there was then little wind but much sea, with gloomy
weather. After getting in-shore about five miles, I found there
was no shelter from southerly winds, and very deep water
apparently all the way in. The ship had now hove to with a fresh
wind at W.S.W., and, being very likely to blow with rain, I put
back. The wind did not stand, and presently we plainly saw
several fires on the shore. The sea still being very heavy, and
no wind, got the launch ahead to tow. At noon it was a great
matter of doubt whether I should not be forced to anchor; the bay
being very deep, I could hardly clear it with a steady breeze.
Our latitude was 38&deg; 21', Cape Bridgewater then bearing N.W.
by W. twelve or thirteen miles. I called the other Cape Nelson,
after the ship. At one a light breeze, which, with the boat
ahead, got us clear of the shore.<br>
<br>
"<i>December</i> 5, P.M.&mdash;Light airs and a very heavy
rolling swell in upon the shore; saw several fires. We being
rather too far into the bay, which is very deep, I was for some
time very doubtful whether we should not be obliged to trust to
our anchors&mdash;the boat still ahead, towing. A light breeze
springing up, we got our head to the southward and shot out. The
western cape of this bay I called Cape Bridgewater, and the
eastern cape, Cape Nelson. This is a very deep bay, and, with
southerly winds, ought carefully to be avoided. Cape Nelson bears
from Cape Bridgewater E.N.E. fifteen or sixteen miles. The
country is beautiful; apparently fine soil, plenty of grass, and
full of wood. Towards evening, saw many fires a little way
inland. A number of seals about, and porpoises. At six in the
evening we had a moderate breeze from S.S.E., Cape Bridgewater
bearing north by east four leagues, and Cape Nelson E.N.E.,
distant six leagues. Got in the boats. Tacked occasionally during
the night, working to windward. At 5 a.m. saw another cape, which
forms not unlike the Dedman in the Channel of England; it runs a
considerable way into the sea, and makes its appearance, when to
the westward, like a very long barn, as it appears arched on the
top with a high bluff end towards the sea, not unlike the gavel
of a house or barn. This I called Cape Solicitor.** Off this cape
are two small islands; the largest makes like two distinct
islands in two hummocks, joined by a neck of low land, which is
not seen until pretty close, when a smaller island is seen a
little further within the first. These I called Lawrence
Islands.***</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[** In his "Voyage" Grant says, "I named this
land Sir William Grant's Cape."]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** In his book he adds, "after Captain
Lawrence, one of the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House."]</p>
<blockquote>"As they will be an excellent mark for making this
part, and save much trouble to those who have not an opportunity
to keep far enough to the northward to make Cape Northumberland,
and as they are very remarkable, navigators will know where they
are. As you draw abreast of these islands, the largest being to
the southward, and which made in two hummocks, you will have its
outer end from the shore appear like a square-topped tower, very
high, and a particular white spot in the middle of it, which I
take to proceed from the birds. The other end also is very high.
This island will appear exactly as here described when it bears
north or north by west half north, when you have an offing of ten
or twelve miles from it. They bear from Cape Solicitor S.E. or
S.E. by S. twelve miles distant, and there appears no danger
between them and the shore. Cape Solicitor now loses its long
form as you get to the eastward, and its particular shape, which
was discernible when to the westward, hides itself now in a high
bluff point, steep and inaccessible. The land round is moderately
high; much wood, and apparently very pleasant; many fires about
this cape. From Cape Solicitor the land runs to the northward as
far as the eye can reach or discern from the mast-head, and forms
a very large and deep bay. I now wished for the wind from the
northward, so that I might explore it. There must, I think, be
harbours in it, but, having the wind light from S.S.E., varying
every quarter of an hour to E.S.E., it would be folly to spend so
much time at present as that would require. The bottom of this
bay is hardly discernible from the mast-head.<br>
<br>
"<i>December</i> 6, <small>P.M</small>.&mdash;Light breezes and
cloudy weather. Tacked occasionally, keeping the shore on board.
At three, made a considerable large island, high and inaccessible
on the sides. We had an opportunity of seeing apparently a good
soil with grass on it, but no trees. This island bears about
E.S.E. from Cape Solicitor. By a good observation at noon
following, I made its latitude to be 38&deg; 29' S., longitude by
my account (reckoning from Cape Northumberland, which I suppose
to be in 142&deg; 30' E. of Greenwich) I make this island lay in
144&deg; 40' E., it bearing from me, when the observation was
taken, N.N.W., distant eighteen or twenty miles, my latitude
observed being 38&deg; 45' S. This island I named Lady Julian's
Island, in honour of Lady Julian Peircy. Observed that we ran
faster along the land than our distance from log would give us. I
presume there is a considerable drift to the eastward.<br>
<br>
"<i>December</i> 7.&mdash;By the mean of four azimuths and
amplitudes the variation is 2&deg; 50' E. We had now fresh
breezes and cloudy weather. I ran under a commanding sail during
the night&mdash;the wind at S.S.W. and S.W. At daylight we saw
the land making in a cape ahead; hauled up to clear it. This cape
is due E.S.E. with a moderate offing from Cape
Solicitor&mdash;distance, per log, 70 miles. As it is the eastern
promontory of this deep and extensive bay, I named it Cape Albany
Ottway, in honour of my much respected friend, William Albany
Ottway, Esq., Captain Royal Navy, one of the Commissioners of the
Transport Board. Another very high and considerable cape, bearing
E.N.E. from Cape Albany Otway, I named Patten's Cape. This cape
is from Albany Otway distant eight or ten miles E.N.E. &frac12;
E. I also distinguished the bay by the name of Portland Bay, in
honour of his Grace the Duke of Portland. The land about here is
truly picturesque and beautiful, and resembles much the land
about Mount Edgcomb, near Plymouth, which faces the Sound, as any
I can compare it to.* It abounds in wood, very thick groves, and
large trees; it is moderately high, but not mountainous. We saw
no fires, most likely from the shore being inaccessible, and much
surf breaking on it. From Cape Albany Otway, E.N.E. ten or twelve
miles, lays another point of land, which shows, as you round
Albany Otway to the eastward, to have a clump of trees regularly
planted on its brow. It is rather high land, and I was inclined
to think, from its projection, we could find anchorage under it,
as we had a commanding breeze now at W.S.W. I bore it pretty
close; but, as I approached it, I found several heavy breakers
off at least six miles from shore; no rocks are to be seen. I
called it Cape Danger and hauled off. In getting to the eastward
I found no shelter nor any place where there was any likelihood
of anchoring; but from the number of little juts and low points
of land further to the northward and eastward, I was determined
to try if any such place could be got, for I never saw a finer
country, and the valleys appeared to have plenty of fresh water
in them, which though not particularly in want of at present, yet
it would be very acceptable. Firewood is rather scarce with us,
therefore I wished to get some. At 11 a.m., after having read
prayers to the people, it being Sunday, I out boats, manned and
armed the launch, and went in search of a place to land in, if
not to anchor the ship. I got within a cable's length and a half
of the shore, and found the surf breaking so heavy that it was
not at all prudent to attempt it. The shore was a sandy beach,
with small rocks interspersed here and there. Even now I had no
soundings with the hand lead-line, so that I verily believe the
beach is steep too. I was very much disappointed to be so near,
and obliged to go on board without setting my foot on this
beautiful spot. It resembles the Isle of Wight as near as
possible in appearance from the water, therefore I called this
part of the coast, which falls into the bottom of the small bay
from Cape Danger to the very low land which is distinguished by a
long ridge of breakers off it, Wight Land, in honour of my friend
Captain Wight, son-in-law to Commissioner Schank. I now returned
on board, got the boats in, and by observation found the latitude
to be 38&deg; 52' S., about eight miles from the shore&mdash;Cape
Danger bearing N.N.W., distant ten or twelve miles.</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* In the margin, beside this sentence is the
following in Governor King's handwriting:&mdash;"Mr. Black in the
<i>Harbinger</i> was close in with this land, and describes it
nearly the same as Lieutenant Grant.&mdash;P.G.K."]</p>
<blockquote>"<i>December</i> 8.&mdash;At half-past 12 p.m., bore
away from the land, the wind being W.S.W. At one, having got
sufficient offing, hove and got the boats in, and made sail to
the eastward. At 8 p.m., Cape Albany Otway bearing west eighteen
or twenty miles, we now made a very high and lofty cape, covered
with trees down to the water's edge, as all the country round is.
From this cape the land breaks short round to the northward,
further than we can discern from the mast-head. I had now a fair
wind, and might have done a great deal this night; but I had my
doubts whether this land, which fell off to the northward, should
not have been followed and kept on board, as from a small chart,
which was given me by Sir Joseph Banks, which I have on board, I
find, from the southernmost point of the Straits as far as they
had then been surveyed, the land trained off to the northward in
the same form, nearly as it did here from Cape Patten, with this
difference, that the cape I allude to on the chart had several
islands off from it, neither did the latitude exactly correspond,
and the land which it gave, running to the northward, was low and
bushy. The land here is high, with large forests of trees, and
there are no islands to be seen; I therefore chose the middle
road. I made snug sail and ran sixty miles E. I judged that, if
it was a bay, I would see the eastern extreme of it. At daylight,
however, we could see nothing anywhere but the looming of the
land we had left from the mast-head.<br>
<br>
"I now bore up and ran N. by W., and at six I saw the land again
ahead, forming a very deep bay, which I could not see the bottom
of from the mast-head. At eight I saw the land bearing from me
E.S.E., extending further to the southward than I could see. I
now, being certain of my route, hauled up E.S.E., and named this
bay Governor King's Bay. It is one of the longest we have yet met
with. Cape Albany Otway forms the westernmost headland, and the
South Cape the easternmost headland; the distance of about 120
miles due E.S.E. At noon it fell calm, the sun very sultry.
Observed, in 39&deg; S., mercury at 73&deg; and
74&deg;.**</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[** The following note is in the
margin:&mdash;"If such a deep bay as this actually exists, it
favours the idea of New South Wales being insulated by a
Mediterranean Sea; however, this the <i>Lady Nelson</i> must
determine in the voyage she is now gone on.&mdash;P.G.K."]</p>
<blockquote>"<i>December</i> 9, <small>P.M</small>.&mdash;Light
airs, inclinable to calm. At 4 p.m. we could see several islands
bearing E.S.E. The mainland seemed to have an opening in it to
the northward of these islands, which I stood in for, but found
it was another bay with low land. This bay runs into the main
nearly east, the northermost cape of which I called Cape Liptrap
in honour of my friend John Liptrap, Esq., London. The main now
showed extending a considerable way to the southward, with
several islands off the cape. I judged this was the point of land
I looked for, from the colour of the water. I sounded; had fifty
fathoms water, fine sand. South Cape distant nine or ten miles;
the land abreast of the ship appearing to be no great distance
off, and being stark calm, I got the boats out and sent the
launch ahead to tow, while I, thinking I should have the pleasure
of setting my foot on this fine country, certainly in such fine
weather, set off for the nearest land, with two hands in the gig,
ordering the ship to tow in after me, and, when the breeze sprang
up, to get the launch in, and stand in for me. At noon, calm,
hazy weather. Sounded in forty-one fathoms&mdash; sand and
shells.<br>
<br>
"P.M.&mdash;Calm. I pulled in-shore for some islands laying off
from the main at the western side of the South Cape, and made for
the largest of them, which appeared to be most fertile, having
taken some seeds to sow on it, if I should be able to land. I
could not have believed the distance was so great as it proved to
be&mdash;at least twelve miles from where I left the ship, and
which, for some time before we had got in with the shore, we had
lost sight of. At last we got in with the island, but, although
not a breath of wind, we found it impossible to land on that side
of it at least, it being steep, and a surf running very heavy on
it; therefore, having no more time, as the ship was not insight,
and it being two in the afternoon, I judged it prudent to get on
board as fast as possible, which we effected by four o'clock. We
had now a light breeze from the eastward; the weather was
intolerably close and sultry, the mercury standing at 72&deg; and
73&deg;. Got in the boats and made sail to the southward. At
seven, the wind at east freshened into a strong gale, and at
eight it blew a thunder-storm with much heavy forked lightning;
but, it being from a weather shore, I kept close at the wind in
order to get to the southward of the islands laying off this
cape, when on a sudden the wind shifted due west, very dark with
heavy rain and lightning, which continued all night, the wind
abating at twelve at night. In the morning it was calm, with hot,
sultry weather. Again, at noon, I had a good observation in
latitude 39&deg; 30' S., the south part of the main or South Cape
bearing N.W. by N., distant twenty miles, and longitude 147&deg;
18' from a good lunar observation taken on the 8th. All round the
western side, and even this far south of the cape, there is fifty
fathoms, forty-five, and forty: white sand and broken shells. I
called that space laying between Cape Liptrap and the South Cape,
King George's Sound,*** and I have no doubt but there is a good
harbour in the bight to the northward, eastward of the south
cape, in the western side of which Cape Liptrap makes the
northern head of. The land here is high, and the mountains
covered with wood. Cape Liptrap is low and flat, as is the land
in this bight, where I judge there is shelter. There is an island
bearing from the western part of the South Cape, south, a little
easterly about twelve miles from the shore; it is round and
inaccessible on all sides, it bearing from me now N.W. by W.,
distant twenty miles. The above-mentioned island I called
Redunder,* from its resemblance to that rock&mdash;a set of
breakers to the southward and eastward of that rock, on which,
though calm, the sea breaks much. Bearing now from me N.N.W.
&frac14; W., distant six miles. Islands to the eastward of me,
there are five in number, the largest of which, from its
resemblance to the Lion's Mount at the Cape of Good Hope, I
called Sir Roger Curtis Island; it is high and inaccessible on
the N.W. side, and is covered with small bushes to the top. The
body of the same bearing from me now E.S.E. seven or eight miles,
other two forming like hay-cocks, only with higher and more
perpendicular, which stand at a considerable distance from each
other, the largest of which bearing from me S.E. &frac14; S.,
distant sixteen or seventeen miles. The smallest bearing from me
S.E. by E., distant ten miles, and is nearly shut in with the
S.E. end of Sir Roger Curtis Island. The fourth is a rock
standing a considerable height out of the water, nearly in a
position between the two sugar-loaf or haycock islands, bearing
from me S.E. &frac14; S. The fifth is a high, perpendicular,
barren cliff, which is, as you get almost abreast of, formed like
two joined at the bottom, rising to a sharp edge, and rugged at
the top; it makes like a large tower or castle. I called it the
Devil's Tower, it bearing from me E. by N., distant ten or twelve
miles. An island in with the shore, bearing N.N.W., distant
eighteen miles, which I named Moncur's Island; and another,
bearing N. by E., sixteen or seventeen miles. Land, apparently an
island, we can just see from the mast-head. It is here to be
observed that these bearings were taken at noon, and, it being
stark calm, the ship was nearly stationary. By a good observation
the latitude was 39&deg; 30', longitude 147&deg; 18' E. of
Greenwich, calculated from a lunar observation two days before.
But I take the correct longitude to be 147&deg; E. from my making
the Ram Head, according to the best charts; therefore the
bearings are laid down on my chart from 147&deg; E. Sultry, close
weather.**</blockquote>

but unsuccessfully, to land from a boat on an island off Wilson's
Promontory, which point is conspicuously marked on his chart
"South Cape". One of the islands is described as "an immense
rock, on one side perfectly round, with a large hole in the
other, in the form of an arch, with a breastwork rising high
enough above the level of the sea to preclude the water from
getting into it; the hollow appeared as if scooped out by Art
instead of by Nature. I gave it the name of the Hole in the Wall;
and to the range of islands stretching along the main, Glennie's
Islands, after Mr. George Glennie, a particular friend of Captain
Schank's, to whom I was under personal obligations. On the summit
of all these islands there was a thick bush growing, whereas the
land of Cape Liptrap, already mentioned, exhibited a fine level
country."</p>
<p>The <i>Lady Nelson</i>, having left England March 18th,
entered the heads of Port Jackson at six in the evening of
December 16th, after a passage of seventy-one days out from the
Cape. She let go her anchors in Sydney Cove at half-past
seven.</p>
<p>Grant may well be allowed to express "the satisfaction of" his
"being the first vessel that ever pursued the same track across
that vast ocean; as we have no traces of its being done,
particularly from the Island of Amsterdam, viz., between the
degrees of lat. 38&deg; and 39&frac12;&deg; S., until the <i>Lady
Nelson</i> made the coast of New Holland in lat. 38&deg;, and
steering to the eastward along a tract of land nearly four
degrees to the westward of any seen by Messrs. Bass and Flinders.
. . . I now," continues the hero of the expedition, "reflect with
much pleasure that I had conducted my little vessel safely out,
which many judged impracticable, both in England and at the Cape,
without any damage either in rigging, masts, or spars, besides
fulfilling the Duke of Portland's orders to search for a passage
through these Straits. Many able officers and seamen at the Cape
thought it too hazardous an attempt in running down the land in
such a high southern latitude, where, in general, heavy S.W.
winds are constantly blowing, and where I might, from the long
range of coast, not be able to extricate myself. . . . The
peevish and ignorant railed altogether at the attempt in such a
vessel to make the voyage to New South Wales, and scrupled not to
say we should have a long drift of it, as it was impossible to
run or scud, the sea being too heavy for such a purpose. . . .
Having, however, conquered all these difficulties of the
imagination, I felt thankful to God for the great success we had
met with, and the protection He had shown us throughout the whole
voyage."</p>
<p>The <i>Lady Nelson</i>, in entering upon her eventful colonial
career, certainly did that which alone ought to immortalize her
name&mdash;she was the first ship that ever sailed parallel to
the entire southern coast-line of Australia, passing through
Bass's Straits. Grant records the arrival from the Cape of Good
Hope, on January 11th, 1801, of the second ship through the
Straits, the <i>Harbinger</i> brig, commanded by Mr. Black, and
on February 7th, of the brig <i>Margaret</i> from England,
commanded by Mr. Byers; the former made land "about Cape Albany
Otway and Cape Patton", and the latter "nearly in 38&deg; 20',
about Cape Bridgewater." Mr. Black sighted and named King's
Island. In a printed sheet of "Observations upon the Chart of
Bass's Straits, combined under the direction of Captain G.P.
King, Governour of New South Wales, by Ensign Barrallier", in the
British Museum,* it is stated that "the South Point and Reefs" of
King's Island "were seen by Mr. Reid in 1798."</p>

State of H.M. Settlements in N. S. Wales," and dated March 1st,

<p class="foot">[* New South Wales Correspondence, Record
Office.]</p>
<blockquote>"Much has been done towards exploring the coast to
the southward by Captain Flinders and Mr. Bass, but I can observe
nothing, in either of their narratives, to conjecture that a more
eligible situation exists, on every account, for forming the
principal settlement at than Port Jackson, nor can I discover
from their observations any other place proper to fix another
settlement at to the southward of this, unless in the Straits,
either at Port Dalrymple on the south, or Western Port on the
north side. Perhaps the former would be the most eligible place,
on account of the prevailing winds, which are from the south to
west Since the discovery of Bass's Straits and the chart
published by Arrowsmith, the following vessels have gone through
them, and from their observations the charts that accompany this
are formed:&mdash;The <i>Lady Nelson</i> passed through, coming
from England, in December, 1800. She made the land in latitude
38&deg;, longitude 141&deg;, and kept along the New Holland
shore. In January, 1801, a small brig from the Cape of Good Hope,
commanded by Mr. Black (a person of good abilities as a surveyor
and navigator), passed through, and, keeping more to the
southward, made Cape Albany Otway, and, standing across to the
southward, made an island lying in the centre of the west
entrance of the Straits, which he named King's Island, and
afterwards passed through the centre of the Straits. A few days
after, a brig from England made King's Island, and, having met
with an uncommon easterly wind, was ten days getting through. She
worked from the north to the south side, and passed through
Banks's Straits. Since then two vessels have been for six months
together sealing at different times of the year, and have
attempted to get to the westward of Western Port, but could not
succeed, owing to the constant west and south-west winds, which
blow with scarce any interval, and send a very great sea quite
through. As these vessels were extremely well found and
persevered greatly, I am led to the belief that a passage to the
Cape of Good Hope through these Straits, if not impracticable,
would be very unadvisable to attempt; but, for ships coming from
the westward, these Straits are certainly most happily situated,
as no ship need go higher than 39&deg; 30' S. Every seaman knows
the difference there is in the weather in that latitude and in
46&deg;, which ships must necessarily get into to round Van
Diemen's Land. It is true that the wind is constantly from the
west and south-west until the distance of the south cape, when it
invariably comes from the north-east, which causes nine ships out
of ten to be from ten to fourteen days getting to Port Jackson,
after having rounded the cape, all which is avoided by passing
through the Straits, which are sufficiently wide. The distance
from Cape Albany Otway to King's Island not being more than
sixteen leagues, the parallel of 39&deg; 15' takes a ship clear
of all. The latitude and longitude of Wilson's Promontory, from
many coinciding observations and by chronometers, is 39&deg; 10'
S. and 146&deg; 52' E. The chart that accompanies this is not
meant as a conclusive one, as much additional information is
expected from the <i>Lady Nelson's</i> present voyage of survey,
which she sailed on in November last; nor can a chart be
considered as perfect until Captain Flinders has examined the
Straits. Still the one now sent may be published as a sufficient
guide for any vessels using the common precautions on their way
hither. The conjecture of New South Wales being insulated from
New Holland still remains undecided. Lieutenant Grant, in the
<i>Lady Nelson</i>, saw no land at the bottom of Portland Bay in
passing it, but his survey of Wilson's Promontory and Western
Port does away the supposed opening between these points, which
was presumed might be the south entrance of such a separation, as
it lies nearly in the meridian of the Gulf of
Carpentaria."</blockquote>
<p>It is difficult to realize that only seventy-six years have
elapsed since it was conjectured that Australia might be
penetrated, or perhaps intersected, by a Mediterranean Sea.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
<h4>VISITS TO WESTERN PORT OF THE "LADY NELSON" UNDER GRANT AND
MURRAY.</h4>
<p class="negindent">Grant goes to Western Port&mdash;Accompanied

Port.</p>
<p>T<small>HE</small> <i>Lady Nelson</i> was not long unemployed
after her remarkable voyage from England. Grant informs us, in
his book, that "the original idea of Captain Schank, who was the
cause of the <i>Lady Nelson</i> being sent out, was to have
discovered all the territory of New South Wales, and to explore
far beyond its limits, leaving the same to be surveyed at a
future opportunity by those competent to it. All that I aimed
at," says Grant, "was the making an eye-sketch of the coast, and
laying it down as accurately as I could, with a journal of all
occurrences, natural history, soil, with such remarks and
observations as I might be able to make." He informs us that,
notwithstanding the voyage the <i>Lady Nelson</i> had made,
"doubts and hints were thrown out that she was not a safe vessel,
and was unfit for the service she was going upon." He also
complains that some articles, including four brass carriage guns,
were taken out of her, so that, if she were "lost, Government
would be less the sufferer."</p>
<p>It was decided that the course of the <i>Lady Nelson</i>
should in the first instance be directed towards Bass's Straits,
although Grant was of opinion that, as winter was approaching, it
would have been better had she been sent north to "have
ascertained if the Gulf of Carpentaria had any inlet to Bass's
Straits." Their pay having been reduced, only two of the original
crew remained, the places of the rest being supplied by convicts,
"three parts" of whom "were sea-sick and unable to move" the
first day or two they were afloat. Grant also took with him
Ensign Francis Barreillier * and four privates of the New South
Wales Corps, Mr. Cayley, the botanist, and two Sydney aborigines,
Euranabie and his wife Worogan. "The <i>Bee</i>, sloop, or rather
decked-boat of fourteen or fifteen tons burthen," accompanied the
<i>Lady Nelson</i>; "she was manned by convicts, one of whom
commanded her."</p>
<p class="foot">[* Sometimes spelt with one r, sometimes
Barrallier.]</p>
<p>On March 8th, 1801, the vessels got out of Port Jackson, but
the <i>Bee</i> being unequal to the somewhat severe weather, was
obliged to put back next day. After a short stay in Jarvis Bay,
the <i>Lady Nelson</i> proceeded south, and passed Wilson's
Promontory on the 20th. Continuing along the coast, Grant named
"Cape Paterson, in compliment to Colonel Paterson of the New
South Wales Corps."</p>
<p>He records that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"At p.m. of the 21st we had sight of the island which
forms the south head of Western Port, having the likeness of a
snapper's head or horseman's helmet. By eight we were up with it,
and, on opening the entrance of the port, I found two small
islands situated about three quarters of a mile from the south
head, with apparently a good passage between them and the island
forming the harbour. From its likeness, as above-mentioned, to a
snapper's head, I named it Snapper Island; it falls in a high
clay bluff down to the water's edge. The small islands lying off
from it were covered with seals, numbers of which, on our
approach, precipitated themselves into the sea, covering the
passage, while others remained on the rocks, making a very
disagreeable noise, somewhat like the grunting of pigs. They were
of large size, many of them being nearly equal to that of a
bullock. I judged them to be of that species of seal called by
the fishermen sea elephants; accordingly, I named these Seal
Islands. I sent a boat ahead to sound the passage, and found,
between the Seal Islands and the south head, twelve, nine, six,
five, and three and a half fathoms water, which last was the
shoalest in mid-channel. This passage will shorten the distance
when there is a leading wind; but, standing round to the westward
of Seal Islands, there will be found sufficient room for any
number of vessels to beat in. Mr. Bass, when he visited this
place in the whale-boat, entered the port by the eastern passage,
which is much the smallest, and coasting the western shore, from
whence he made his remarks. It is probable that these islands
lying so close to the opposite side of him, they did not show
themselves to be detached from the southern side of the entrance,
and this I judge because he makes no mention of them. And I am
the more inclined to this opinion as no one has ever thought of
looking here for seals, notwithstanding they may be found in
great numbers, with an excellent harbour, affording good shelter
for vessels employed in pursuit of them.<br>
<br>
"It had rained constantly and heavily all the night, and by its
continuance we could not see any great distance from the vessel;
therefore I kept the lead going as she worked up the harbour. . .
. .<br>
<br>
"At half-past 5 p.m. came to an anchor in six and a half fathoms
of water, fine sand, and abreast of a sandy point, bearing west
three quarters of a mile, which I named Lady Nelson's Point as a
memorial of the vessel, as she was the first decked one that ever
entered this port."</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Barreillier and the second mate, Mr. Bowen&mdash;of whom
more afterwards&mdash;went on shore and saw many swans and
red-bills.</p>
<p>Grant proceeded on the 22nd in search of the stream described
by Bass at the head of the harbour. He notes that, during the
progress of this excursion, "pelicans and albatrosses in great
numbers" were seen.</p>
<p>The explorer was attracted to land upon what he named
Churchill's Island, but did not accomplish the object with which
he set out. Next day the second mate also ineffectually attempted
to discover the stream; Grant himself "explored the banks of a
considerable creek which opened abreast of the vessel."
Barreillier and Murray, the first mate, were occupied surveying
part of the harbour, whilst Cayley, the botanist, went in search
of plants, penetrating "a considerable way in Snapper Island".
Numerous water-fowl and land-birds were seen, but all very
shy.</p>
<p>Grant says in his book,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The 25th and 26th being clear and fine, search was
again made for the fresh-water stream; the survey was carried on.
. . . I went up the creek already mentioned in the boat, and
found it to terminate in a large salt marsh, having the
appearance of being at times overflowed to a considerable extent:
the trees were not very large, but the underwood was very thick;
however, I penetrated through it to a considerable distance, and
found here and there spots that appeared as if they had been
cleared by manual labour. These spots were covered with good
tender grass, and afforded, by their agreeable verdure, great
pleasure to the sight. . . .<br>
<br>
"The open land, which, as I have mentioned, had the appearance of
being frequently overflowed, was clothed with grass which grew
everywhere luxuriantly, and seemed like other salt marshes, well
adapted for the purposes of fattening cattle. . . . The length of
this creek is about two miles and a half, the water is perfectly
salt, and it ends in a small run of about twelve feet in
breadth."</blockquote>
<p>Bowen at length discovered the stream of fresh water, and
captured a couple of cygnets, one of which became tame, and was
presented to Governor King. Murray, Barreillier, and Cayley were
sent on the 27th to explore the stream, up which they proceeded
as far as the boat could go. It wound very much, "to the number
of forty-two short reaches," and "the breadth of the entrance was
about half a cable's length, and at the farthest part the boat
went, not more than eighteen or twenty feet, the passage being
there impeded by trees lying across it." The same day Grant,
"attended by the faithful Euranabie," made "excursions along the
shore to the mouth of the harbour," observing a creek, not as
large as that just mentioned, "having its entrance quite filled
up with beach, so that the sea could not enter it."</p>
<p>Grant thus describes the dexterity with which his black man,
Euranabie, caught a fish:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I had no sooner expressed my wish on this matter
than, turning about, I missed my companion from behind me: not
divining the true cause of his absence, I grew impatient and
halloed for him, upon which he instantly presented himself from
the wood with a small stick in his hand. Asking me for my knife,
he presently sharpened one end to a point, and then, stripping
himself, he leaped from one point of the rock to another, until
he met with an opportunity of striking a fish, which he did, the
stick penetrating quite through it; and in this state he came and
presented it to me. During this transaction I could not but
admire the keenness of his sight, and his ability to preserve the
steadiness of his position, standing as he did upon the rough
edge of a sharp rock, the sea washing above his knees, his eyes
intent upon the fish, very difficult to strike from the smallness
of its size, presented to him in a narrow back. I have before
remarked upon the gentle disposition which is so striking a
feature in the character of the New Hollander. In the individual
of whom I am now speaking it was remarkable; his attention and
readiness to oblige on all occasions were very great. Though I
pressed him to take the fish several times, he as constantly
refused it, but accepted of some tobacco, which he was
exceedingly fond of smoking."</blockquote>
<p>On the 29th, Murray and Barreillier were sent to ascertain
"certain particulars respecting the entrance of the port, and
with regard to Seal Islands", on which they were directed, if
possible, to land. In this, however, they failed, the day proving
boisterous; but they "brought the boat to anchor off a sandy
beach, which appeared to have no surf, when they were suddenly
surprised with a heavy swelling sea, which being immediately
followed by another of the same, the boat filled and was upset on
the beach. Fortunately no lives were lost, though all were
immersed in the water, from which Euranabie . . . first escaped
to shore." The provisions and ammunition were lost or spoiled.
"At the turn of the tide they launched the boat and returned on
board." A black swan and four ducks which they had shot were
recovered, "and this", says Grant, "afforded them and us, who
were on board, the consolation of a savoury meal."</p>
<p>Grant started with Barreillier on March 31st for a somewhat
extended expedition up the fresh-water river. They were drenched
the first night by a heavy thunder-storm. They "traced a branch
of the river on the right, a small distance from the mouth of
this stream, as far as the boat could go," and "then followed its
course on shore along the bank, and found it fed by the greater
river only." "Plots of very rich pasture" were found . . . . "At
some considerable distance, however, the land rose to a height,
and being covered with large trees, which appeared to be
shattered by storms, had for this reason obtained the name of
Mount Rugged. We marched pretty far inland, and found the country
everywhere free from inundations, interspersed with woods and
open plains, and exhibiting a very picturesque appearance."</p>
<p>Among the birds noticed was the <i>Bell Bird</i>, which has "a
note not unlike the tinkling of a bell, so that when a number of
these birds are collected together, the noise they make is
similar to that made by the bells of a team of horses." The
author never remembers hearing more than one or two of them at a
time. An old colonial friend, the laughing-jackass, is mentioned
as the "laughing-bird whose note can only be compared to the 'ha!
ha! ha!' of a hearty-laughing companion."</p>
<p>"An extensive and level country, which was entirely clear of
timber and underwood," is also described:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The grass was so luxuriant here that it was
difficult to pass through it, as it reached above our knees. . .
. This plain extended further than we could see on one side; on
the other it was bounded by hills. We walked over it some
distance, and found the soil rich and good: the grass, with which
it was everywhere plentifully covered, had the appearance of rye
grass, much like that which I had seen in England. And I do not
hesitate to pronounce that I saw no land about Sydney or
Paramatta which, for richness of soil, appeared better adapted
for the purposes of agriculture. In saying this I do not mean to
confine the observation to a small spot such as I then viewed,
but to the general face of the country, which I had occasion
afterwards to go over to the extent of several miles . . .
."</blockquote>
<p>Speaking of the trees, Grant "observed some which had grown to
the height of sixty or seventy feet, without any branches except
at the top; these were slender and light wood. . . . I had a few
of them cut down and brought on board." A species of sassafras
was discovered by the second mate, Bowen, of whom Grant speaks in
the following high terms:&mdash;"I must not omit doing justice to
the diligence and talents of the young man . . . . whose use and
value I have experienced on many occasions."</p>
<p>Bowen, on April, 21st, discovered, near the mouth of the
fresh-water river, part of a canoe with two paddles, and some
line used in fishing. The canoe "was framed with timber, and,
instead of being tied together at the ends, was left open, the
space being afterwards filled with grass worked up with strong
clay." It and other specimens collected were deposited with
Governor King.</p>
<p>The vessel was moved to the shore opposite to that where she
had been lying, "in order to near a small island lying in the
opening of the extensive arms described by Mr. Bass, of which
this port has two branching out to the northward. I named this
island Margaret Island, in honour of Mrs. Schank, to whom I am
indebted for several articles, useful on board my little vessel.
. . . The tide ebbing very fast, we found ourselves in shoal
water . . . the bottom being a soft mud.</p>
<p align="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>
<p>"But to proceed. As I am no friend to vessels being on the
ground, unless there be an absolute necessity for it, by carrying
a hawser out, I soon hauled her off, and brought her up nearer to
Margaret Island, at which we stayed for some time. We found this
island to be in general flat, but well covered with wood. Here we
deposited some seeds, but did not find the soil equally rich with
that of Churchill Island. Mr. Barreillier and I went for a great
length of way up this arm." The country is described as level and
very fertile, "having many woods of large timber trees,
intermixed with open savannahs of the most rich and luxuriant
grass." Being in want of water, Grant says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Luckily I heard the bull-frog, which is common to
New South Wales, and I made towards the thicket from whence his
croaking issued, and there found a present supply. . . .<br>
<br>
"This arm, being nearly dry at low water, reminded me of the
appearance of Porchester Lake when the tide is out. Indeed, the
entire view of Western Port has no small resemblance of Spithead
and Portsmouth harbour."</blockquote>
<p>Grant's dates are somewhat confusing, for having recorded what
took place on a particular day, he describes something which
happened at an earlier date. He continues,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"On the 17th we got under weigh, and at night brought
up in twelve fathoms water, with rather a foul bottom. In the
morning we discovered a sand-shoal, whereon the waves were
breaking very heavily close to us. This ought to be carefully
avoided by keeping the south and east shores on board, as it lays
a long distance from the north and west side, and has at all
times a surf on it. We availed ourselves of this bottom, and in
half an hour caught abundance of large snappers. We shifted our
berth and brought up in a small nook or bay, which I named
Elizabeth Cove, in honour of Miss Elizabeth King, daughter of
Governor King, then at Sydney.<br>
<br>
"Great part of the survey of this extensive harbour being
completed on the 22nd of April, notwithstanding the delay
occasioned by wet and unfavourable weather, and there being yet
more to do, I was anxious to be gone. We were, however, detained
by the badness of the weather until the 29th, when at break of
day I weighed and stood out of Western Port, passing to the
westward of Seal Islands, and found a large passage capable of
any vessel beating into it; care, however, should be taken to
give the westernmost head a wide berth, to avoid some heavy
breakers which appear a mile from it even in good weather. . .
.<br>
<br>
"On entering this harbour the easternmost shore, or right-hand
side, giving the Seal Islands a berth of three-quarters of a
mile, unless a preference is given to going between Seal and
Snapper Islands, which was the passage by which the <i>Lady
Nelson</i> entered. The former passage is the principal entrance
into the harbour, and with the before-mentioned offing from the
islands, and a N.E. &frac12; E. course by compass, will carry a
vessel up to Elizabeth's Cove or Bay. . . . Our course out was
S.W. &frac12; W. by compass, which carried us clear of
everything."</blockquote>
<p>Grant sums up the advantages of the place by stating "that
Western Port is capable of containing several hundred sail of
ships in perfect security from storms, and will admit of being
fortified. It is a convenient harbour for going in and coming out
at all times, is situated in a country which may easily be
improved by cultivation, and in an excellent climate." He says,
also, "I had not, from the time of my departure, a sick man among
my ship's company, one man only excepted, whose skull had been
fractured.'"</p>
<p>The <i>Lady Nelson</i> made a survey of the coast from Western
Port to Wilson's Promontory for a distance of seventy miles; but
the weather so much impeded her that Grant thought it better to
make the best of his way back to Sydney, which he reached May
14th, 1801, having been obliged to shelter for four-and-twenty
hours in Botany Bay.</p>
<p>The Hentys at Portland, and Batman and Fawkner at Port
Phillip, are usually regarded as the first cultivators of the
soil of Victoria; but Grant was the very first. The particulars
of the earliest planting and harvest-home, which ever took place
in the colony, are well worthy of some space in its history. The
first cultivator must therefore be allowed to tell the tale of
his husbandry. He describes how, a day or two after his arrival
in Western Port, when in search of the stream described by Bass,
he came upon a spot so well adapted for the purposes of culture,
that he determined to have it prepared for the reception of the
seeds which he had brought with him. Grant thus gives his own
account:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"In proceeding along the shore, I fell in with an
island, pleasantly situated, and separated from the main by a
very narrow channel at low water, but even then sufficient for a
boat to pass, though much larger when the tide is in. I passed
through it and landed on the island towards the N. and W. It is
of gradual ascent, well covered with trees of a considerable
height, and much underwood. The situation of it was so pleasant,
and the prospects round it so agreeable, that this, together with
the richness of the soil and the sheltered position of the spot,
made me conceive the idea that it was excellently adapted for a
garden. Having determined upon establishing a garden in this
place, I thought it incumbent upon me to give the island the name
of Churchill, after a generous and public-spirited gentleman,
John Churchill, Esq., of Dawlish, in the county of Devon, who, on
my leaving England, supplied me with a variety of seeds of useful
vegetables, together with the stones of peaches, nectarines, and
the pepins or kernels of several sorts of apples, with an
injunction to plant them for the future benefit of our
fellow-men, be they countrymen, Europeans, or savages. I had,
moreover, been furnished with many seeds for the like liberal
purpose by my friend Captain Schank; but let me not omit the
pepin of an apple, differing from all other fruit of the kind, in
having rarely more than one pepin in each apple. I hope the name
I gave with it in New Holland will not be forgotten (Lady
Elizabeth Percy's Apple), should it happen to prove a common
fruit of the country, as it was owing to her ladyship's care and
attention in preparing the pepins that I was enabled to introduce
it."</blockquote>
<p>The narrative is again taken up,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"On the 28th March, 1801, not having found any other
place fitter for the purpose, I went on shore at Churchill's
Island, with the resolution of clearing ground for a garden, as I
before mentioned was my intention. The party I took with me burnt
a space of about twenty rods; they felled the larger trees. . . .
I was pleased to find the soil easy to dig, rich and loose.<br>
<br>
"On our return to Churchill's Island," continues Grant, three or
four day 8 afterwards, "I found my people had cleared the spot I
had laid out for a garden, and that there was nothing wanting but
to prepare the ground to receive such seeds as I should choose to
plant. And here we were under a difficulty which it was no easy
matter to remedy, for we had neither hoe nor spade with us. It is
true I had brought out the latter implements for gardening with
me from England, by the advice of my friend Captain Schank, who
foresaw the occasion we should have for them, and they were
delivered, amongst other things, into his Majesty's storehouse,
from whence, from whatever principle of economy and good
management, it was not easy to draw anything out again.<br>
<br>
"However, we were in possession of a coal-shovel, which, though
it was thin and much worn, served the purpose, the soil being, as
I have already observed, exceedingly light and easy to work;
indeed, a spade was much wanted in another respect, which was
digging for water&mdash;an experiment I was desirous of making,
and which I found could not well be made with a
coal-shovel."</blockquote>

<p>This historical coal-shovel should certainly have been
reserved for a place of honour in the Museum of the Colony.</p>
<blockquote>"The ground was now prepared, and I sowed my several
sorts of seeds, together with wheat, Indian corn and peas, some
grains of rice, and some coffee-berries; and I did not forget to
plant potatoes. With the trunks of the trees I felled I raised a
blockhouse of 24 feet by 12, which will probably remain for some
years, the supporters being well fixed in the earth. Indeed, I
was anxious to mark my predilection for this spot on account of
its beautiful situation, insomuch that I scarcely know a place I
should sooner call mine than this little island. Round this
skeleton of a mansion-house I planted the stones and kernels of
the several fruits I had brought out, not forgetting that of the
curious apple before mentioned. I made this plantation rather
late in the season, but I am in hopes that some of the crops will
flourish, and I wait the pleasure of a good report hereafter.
Several of my crew remained on this island for seven or eight
days. . . . Birds they found, and particularly parrots in great
numbers; but in their search for water they were unsuccessful,
though I am strongly of opinion it might be procured by digging.
. . . We turned up a few stones, and some interspersed with veins
of iron ore,&mdash;indeed, so rich of the metal that they had a
visible effect on the needle of our compass."</blockquote>
<p>Having given, in Grant's own words, the particulars of the
first planting of Victorian soil, which was certainly effected
under serious difficulties&mdash;considering that the only
implement was a coal-shovel&mdash;we must now record the first
harvest-home which ever took place in the territory. It is
described in the log of the <i>Lady Nelson</i>&mdash;of which we
shall speak in the next chapter. That vessel, in command of
Lieutenant Murray, again entered Western Port, December 7th,
1801, and anchored in Elizabeth Cove. Next day she was taken up
to <i>Lady Nelson</i> Point.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 9th, Murray records:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"A.M.&mdash;I went in the gig to Churchill Island,
and there found everything as we left it&mdash;I mean the remains
of our fires and huts. The wheat and corn that Lieutenant Grant
had sown in April last was in full vigour, six feet high, and
almost ripe; the onions also were grown into seed; the potatoes
have disappeared. I fancy that the different animals that inhabit
the island must have ate them or otherwise destroyed them. I
regretted not having time or men to spare to clear a larger spot,
and sow the wheat already grown, as the next crop would be large.
I never saw finer wheat or corn in my life, the straw being very
near as large as young sugar-cane."</blockquote>
<p>The log further states, on the same day, after mentioning the
capture of three pair of young swans:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"At 3 p.m., sent the second mate to Churchill Island
to cut down the wheat on purpose to feed the young swans with it.
At sun-down they returned on hoard with the wheat, in the whole,
perhaps, a bushel in quantity, a good deal mixed with oats and
barley, all fine of their kind; some potatoes also were found,
and two onions."</blockquote>
<p>Such was the result of the very first cultivation of the soil
of Victoria.</p>
<p>But to return for a moment to Grant. He informs us that
Governor King was well pleased with what he had done, although
the weather had prevented him from carrying out the whole of his
instructions. His expectations in New South Wales, however, not
having been realized, he sailed from Sydney for England on
November 9th, 1801, three days before the <i>Lady Nelson</i>,
commanded by Murray, started on the expedition, of which we shall
next give the results.</p>
<p>In the New South Wales Correspondence ** is a despatch of July
8th, 1801, in which Governor King acquaints the Duke of Portland
with the result of Grant's expedition to Western Port in the
following terms:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[** Record Office.]</p>
<blockquote>"Having in my last informed that the <i>Lady
Nelson</i> in coming here passed through Bass's Straits,
agreeable to your Grace's directions, and that Lieutenant Grant
was sent to survey and examine that passage; but from the
inclemency of the weather in that high latitude at this season,
his discoveries have extended no further than making a minute
survey, and ascertaining Western Port to be a safe and spacious
harbour for any number of ships. Lieutenant Grant, and the
officers who were on that survey, report the soil about Western
Port to be equal in goodness to that of Norfolk Island. The
important situation of that port, and its relative connexion with
this settlement, point it out as a proper and necessary place to
have a settlement at, not only from its convenient situation in
the centre of the Straits for ships to stop at, either by reason
of adverse winds or any other cause, but also from its
advantageous situation for a seal fishery, which will be more
particularly explained on the chart sent by the <i>Albion</i>,
which has been ably surveyed by Ensign Barrallier of the New
South Wales Corps, and who will be a great acquisition in
surveying and delineating these hitherto unknown coasts, as,
unfortunately, Lieutenant Grant, although a good seaman and a
sober, steady, capable officer, yet he has no knowledge of
surveying and delineation&mdash;this necessary qualification in
officers of the navy not being so much attended to as the more
active and important duties of their profession. The <i>Lady
Nelson</i> returned here the 15th May."</blockquote>
<p>After reporting that she was then absent, the Governor
adds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"As the <i>Lady Nelson</i> will return here by the
1st August, I intend to despatch her and another colonial vessel
in September to survey and examine Bass's Straits and the
south-west coast."</blockquote>
<p>We must now give the leading incidents connected with the
second visit of the <i>Lady Nelson</i> to Western Port, as
related in Lieutenant Murray's log, which, having never yet been
published, is quoted at greater length in the following pages
than it need otherwise have appeared. The little vessel left
Sydney November 12th, 1801, and after Murray had made some
observations at Kent's Group, she sighted Sir Roger Curtis's
Island and Wilson's Promontory on the evening of December 5th,
1801, and, on that of the 6th, Cape Liptrap and Phillip
Island.</p>
<p>It is stated that next morning the island was rounded, and
that the ship got close up with Grant's Point. Numerous soundings
and "light baffling" winds are recorded, and at length, at 6 p.m.
on the 7th, so runs the log:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Gained the entrance and passed between Grant's Point
and Seal Island, which island seemed as full of seals as when we
were last here,&mdash;a circumstance that almost makes me
conclude that neither the Harrington or Mr. Rushford have been
here. Kept standing up the harbour with a S.W. wind; at seven
came to anchor in Elizabeth Cove in six fathoms water, with. . .
. Lowered down the gig, and I went on shore to observe if any
signs of strangers were to be seen. Saw nothing to make me think
the cove had been visited since we left it in May last; in short,
the only difference was that the land appeared in a higher state
of verdure now that it was at that time."</blockquote>
<p>Next day the vessel went up to Lady Nelson Point, and then as
near the mouth of the river as possible. On the 9th, the corn
which was planted in April was, as we have seen, reaped. At the
river, everything seemed the same as when they had been there
before, leaving the presumption that no vessel had been up for
water. There had evidently been a flood in the river, for a
temporary hut built on its banks was partly washed away? These
were "in a high state of verdure, and in many places the view
truly romantic and wild."</p>
<p>On the 11th, Murray ran to Lady Nelson Point, and "anchored in
the mouth of the salt-water lagoon, seven-fathom water." On the
16th he walked along the beach six or seven miles, but saw no
signs of strangers having been there; and Bowen, the first mate,
with a boat's crew, went to Seal Island, which, he reported,
could not have been visited by any one since the previous voyage
of the <i>Lady Nelson</i>, as the "seals were as plenty as ever,
and several thousand pups lying on shore." Next day, Murray says,
"As it continued calm all night, and seeing we could not proceed
to sea this day, I again sent" Bowen "to Seal Island to get some
of the skins, both as a specimen to Government and for our own
uses, as several of the people were without hats or shoes." The
previous day, several dozen rock-fish were caught at Grant's
Point.</p>
<p>Murray records, on the 18th, a somewhat important
discovery:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I sent Bond and Messing, two soldiers, to cut down
some more wood, doing which they were fortunate enough to
discover a spring of water, which, however, at first looked only
equal to fill a breaker or two. I went on shore, and found, on
clearing it a little with our hands, that at once we got a
hundred gallons of very good water, much better than the river
water which . . . . in particular rendered myself unfit to attend
to duty. This discovery induced our farther search, and in the
morning a spring was found that, on being cleared, proved equal
to watering, in a few days, a line-of-battle ship. Pleased with
this circumstance, took a gang of hands on shore, and made a good
road to it. We also cleared the spring of all the dirt, roots and
boughs of fallen and decayed trees . . . . and found the bottom
to be a rock or very large stones collected together. It is worth
observing that in half an hour after it was entirely empty it was
again quite full of clear good water. We now filled all our empty
casks, and everything on board that would hold water, intending
to go to sea when the wind would permit. As in this cove wood is
plenty, the water is not above fifty yards from the seaside, and
also that a vessel of any size may be wooded and watered in two
or three days, and at the same time ride secure from all winds
either close in, or farther out, it will not seem absurd in me to
observe that it is the best place in the harbour for any vessel
to lay in, whether her stay is to be short or long. It may also
be noticed that besides this large spring there are several other
lesser ones, at one of which . . . we at once filled one hundred
gallons of water, and this morning it was again overflowing. I
must now remark that the soil of this island as far as we have
penetrated is very sandy; no black mould is seen. The trees are
very small, and invariably decayed . . . although this cove and
island can supply a ship in abundance with what is generally
considered the greatest of her wants, yet I fancy it would poorly
pay a settler."</blockquote>
<p>Particulars like these, which have hitherto been unpublished,
may be of value, as enabling places now well known and inhabited,
to be identified as those thus early described; and possibly some
of the first colonists of these parts may be able to remember
traces of the visits of the <i>Lady Nelson</i> for which they
have, perhaps, hitherto been unable to account.</p>
<p>On December 20th Murray "got a large board hung up at the
entrance of the road to Fresh Well or Spring, on which was
painted in oil colours directions for any stranger how to get to
the Watering Place"; the pathway to it he also had levelled, so
that water-butts might be rolled along it.</p>
<p>Everything was for some days ready for sea, but the winds, as
usual, were unfavourable.</p>
<p>At length Murray is able to record, on December the
24th:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"At 8 a.m. hove up and made all sail down the
harbour; at nine the wind died away, and we towed hack into
Elizabeth's Cove again and dropped our small bower, but kept our
sails loose, in order to be off the first spurt of wind. . . . At
half-past one p.m. again hove up and made all sail down the
harbour; but at 3 p.m. it again fell little wind and we came too
in half-four fathoms water, about five miles below Elizabeth's
Cove."</blockquote>
<p>Here Murray went on shore, and walked down the beach a long
way, but saw no signs of the Harrington or Mr. Rushford, of whom
he expected to have found traces, or of any other person having
been in the place. It again came on to blow, and as the vessel
lay quite open to the sea, she had to run back to Elizabeth Cove,
where she anchored after dark, and at daylight on Christmas
morning was found to be nearly in her old anchorage. A sudden and
violent squall came on at noon which caused a strain upon her
three anchors. It continued for four hours and settled into a
regular gale with thunder and lightning, and "more sea than"
Murray "supposed was possible to be in this Cove." At 3 p.m. on
the 26th, "the gale continued to increase and a sea got up still
higher than it yet had been at any time since the gale
commenced."</p>
<p>Murray says it was "the hardest by far I ever yet saw in this
country, and as it blew dead on shore outside, nothing less than
the greatest Providence could have saved us had we got to sea
either of the times I attempted it." The entry in the log states
that, "At 7 p.m., the weather looking very bad," they "made a run
for Lady Nelson's Point, the gale following as hard as ever," and
"at half-past 9 p.m. came to an anchor" there, and "lay easy in
smooth Water . . . . right under the Land." On the 28th, however,
"a strong wind sprung up at North, and from that veered to N.W.
and blew hard. At 8 a.m. the vessel drove, and before the other
Bower was gone and had hold, she tail'd in on a Mud Bank, which
obliged us to weigh the Best Bower with Long Boat, and lay it out
ahead to heave her off," and at flood tide they "ran her to the
leaward of Lady Nelson's Point."</p>
<p>Speaking, on the 29th, of how his expedition had been impeded,
Murray remarks, "Thus has this kind of weather bound us here this
last 12 days, in spite of all our endeavours to proceed to sea."
Next day it also blew hard.</p>
<p>On the 31st a number of swans were seen near Churchill's
Island. Bowen, the first mate, was sent after them, and he
succeeded in capturing six. The same afternoon, the weather
having improved, the vessel ran down and anchored at Elizabeth's
Cove, where wood and water were taken in. The well was in fine
order, and mention is made of the discovery of another spring,
"the banks of which where covered with watercresses and wild
blackberries. Got some of both on board." On New Year's morning,
1802, "a strong wind coming from W.N.W., threw a sea into the
Cove not at all pleasant. I therefore," says Murray, "up anchor
and again ran up under Lady Nelson's Point, and at 11 a.m.
anchored"; and "the New Year was usher'd in with us by splicing
the mainbrace and three cheers, by the weather with a black
squall of wind and rain, and this kind of weather continued with
little or no variation till noon." During the next few days the
weather gradually quieted down.</p>
<p>When the <i>Lady Nelson</i> was first at Western Port, none of
the natives, and scarcely any traces of them, were observed, but
during this second visit their fires were visible in several
directions. At length, on January 4th, the day before the
vessel's departure, a meeting with them took place, which is thus
recorded in the log:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"At 2 p.m. the launch returned on board. We have at
last got some kind of knowledge of the natives of this part of
the country. The following is the substance of the report of Mr.
Bowen, first mate. At 7 a.m. left the head of the Fresh Water
River, after having in vain looked for some of the crowned birds
and having been able to shoot nothing (a few ducks excepted).
Having proceeded down the river, and being nearly half way on
board, he observed a fire lighted on the beach between Crown Head
and the entrance of the river, and, thinking it could be nothing
but natives, he immediately put back to prove, knowing I was
extremely anxious to have, if possible, a friendly intercourse
with them. As the boat approached the beach these blacks were
perceived sitting in the same form as those of Sydney, and each
of them a bundle of spears in their hands. Our people hollowed to
them, which they instantly answered, and did not seem at all
alarmed on the nearer approach of the boat. Three boys made their
appearance. As between the beach and the boat there lay a bank of
mud about 200 yards across, Mr. Bowen could not get quiet so
close as he could wish. However, he singly got out and began to
walk towards them, which when they perceived they jumped up on
their feet, and it now was perceived that one of them was a very
old man with a large bushy beard, and the rest of his face
besmeared with red oaker; the others were young men. They were
all clothed with the skins of Apposums as far as their middle,
and this old man seemed to have command over the others. As Mr.
Bowen advanced they all pulled off their dress and made signs to
the officer, that before he came any nearer he must do the same.
This was immediately complied with. They then all sat down again,
and Mr. Bowen plucking a root of fern advanced pretty close to
them, holding it up. They seemed to understand it as it was
meant. When he got within a few yards of this party the old man
seemed rather uneasy and began to handle his spears. Mr. Bowen
then threw them a tomahawk, and one of the young men picked it
up. On Mr. Bowen beckoning them to sit down, doing the same, they
again threw him back the tomahawk, and all except the old man sat
down. Mr. Bowen then broke a piece of stick, and cut it with the
tomahawk and tied a handkerchief to it and again reached it to
them. On this one of the young men ventured to reach his hand and
take it out of the officer's, but would by no means be so
familiar as to shake hands. Mr. Bowen then ate some bread and
then gave them some which they did not eat, but carefully laid it
by under some fern-roots or leaves. On getting some ducks they
took no other notice of them than to examine in what manner they
were killed. What their ideas on that head were we know not, as
they did not take the least notice of our firearms even when,
towards the latter end of the parley, it was found necessary to
point one at the breast of the old man, who all along was very
suspicious of our designs. All this time they expressed a good
deal of wonder at the colour of Mr. Bowen's skin, and one of the
young men made very significant signs to him that he must have
washed himself very hard. They now made signs to Mr. Bowen to go
back to the boat, and pointed down along the beach to Crown Head.
Mr. Bowen accordingly went into the boat, and pulled down as they
walked. After pulling about 1&frac12; mile they stopped, and
beckoned for the boat to come in. Here three women made their
first appearance; each with a child at her back. Mr. Bowen went
on shore. Here little passed on either side further than when Mr.
Bowen asked for fire to warm himself they pointed to the boat and
made signs for him to go there and get it. The women sometimes
shook their hands to him and the boys laughing and whooping. A
few more trifles were here given to them. A little before this
all our people got out of the boat stark naked, as was desired,
and walked somewhat near the natives, on which the old man sent
the boys away to the women, and he, after having in a great
passion made signs for us to go to the boat, began to retire with
his face to us, and brandishing his spear, so that every one
thought he would heave. When our people turned their backs the
young men seemed more quiet. As we saw that all hope of further
intercourse for the present was at an end, Mr. Bowen ordered Bond
to fire his piece over their heads in order to make good his
retreat to the boat. This had the desired effect, as they one and
all were out of sight in an instant. Before this they must have
taken the musket for nothing but a stick. All the weapons they
were possessed of was their spears (them of a small size) and a
stone tomahawk along with the Wumara they throw with. With
respect to their size the young men where much the same as those
of Sydney, but the old man was very stout. Their hair was in the
same nasty manner as those of Sydney. Their understanding,
however, seems to go beyond those of Sydney, or Jarvis's Bay.
They were not deficient in making out our signs and we were easy
able to understand from their motions what they would be at. From
there being but little food for them on the beach here, and their
being clothed in the skins of Apposums, I presume they are bush
natives. The women, I forgot to mention, appeared to be middling
well-shaped and good-looking children. They were, however, always
at some distance. Mr. Bowen and the people having joined the
boat, came on board. Observed that all the remainder of the day
they retired back into the woods, and about 6 p.m. doused their
fire at once, although it must have covered near an acre of
ground."</blockquote>
<p>Next morning, January 5th, 1802, the <i>Lady Nelson</i> was at
length able to run out of Western Port upon the important cruise
of which we shall treat in the next chapter. In the midst,
however, of her discoveries, she returned to this friendly
harbour, remaining in it, on this third visit, from January 31st
till February 15th.</p>
<p>Among the chief incidents recorded in the log during this
stay, is a walk which Murray took, of seven or eight miles along
the beach to Lady Nelson's Point, when he observed a great
variety of birds, flights of white cockatoos, and twenty or
thirty swans on the Salt Water Lagoon. The birds were all so shy
that only a single pigeon could be shot.</p>
<p>Murray remarks that "the trees where all in bloom", and "I am
apt to think summer does not begin in this part till January. On
penetrating further into this Island the soil was found good as
far as we are judges."</p>
<p>Some of the birds coming to drink at the well on the shore,
were shot by a man who was placed to sit near it for some hours
towards sun-down.</p>
<p>It is recorded on the 5th, that, "as it was calm and no
appearance of getting out, at 8 a.m. hove up and towed the vessel
to Lady Nelson's Point in order to send the boat up the river for
birds, such plenty of them of various kinds being on this Island.
At noon dropped our anchor in six fathoms water, Lady Nelson's
Point bearing W. b. S. half a mile, and Crown Head N.E. b. E.
eight or nine miles, and Margarett Island N.E. half N. seven or
eight miles."</p>
<p>On the 9th the vessel sailed down again to Elizabeth's Cove,
and completed her supply of water and wood, intending to sail
next morning, but the weather again interposed. It was calm on
the 9th, with "a constant thick fiery haze, latterly it was so
dark as to resemble the approach of night." On the 10th Murray
observes that "for these two days past having found a quantity of
oysters, mussels, and other shell fish at low water, to-day gave
the shore a strict search at low water, and plainly perceived
that a company of six or eight men would not run any risk or
hazard of being starved here for several months." Some very
handsome shells were also found. On the 12th and 13th they
prepared to run out, but "it constantly kept falling calm", so
that on the latter day the observation is made "that this kind of
weather is as destructive to the intent of this cruise as gales
at sea." Murray then took "a walk down along the beach far enough
to see all the entrance to this port, and by ascending an
eminence was confirmed in an opinion that several of those
dangerous sand rollers had shifted their births, and by so doing
had rendered the channel narrower than hithertofore."</p>
<p>Thus the discoverer passed his time, while waiting for a
favourable opportunity of starting upon his most important
cruise.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>
<h4>PORT PHILLIP BAY DISCOVERED AND ENTERED.</h4>
<p class="negindent">Existing accounts of discovery of Port
Phillip Bay inaccurate&mdash;The forgotten log of the <i>Lady
Nelson</i>&mdash;Correct dates of first discovery and entry of
the Heads&mdash;The man who first entered them&mdash;Murray in
the <i>Lady Nelson</i> sails from Western Port and discovers the
new harbour&mdash;Steers for Cape Otway and examines King's
Island&mdash;Returns to Western Port&mdash;Entrance to Port
Phillip examined&mdash;The <i>Lady Nelson</i> anchors in the
bay&mdash;Entries in her log <i>in extenso</i>.</p>
<p>I<small>T</small> is surprising that the facts respecting so
important a discovery as that of Port Phillip Bay should have
remained up to the present time so imperfectly known, that the
date should be erroneously stated, and the name of the man who
first entered the bay should have been entirely forgotten, or
more probably have never been made public. But so it is.</p>
<p>Curiosity has been hitherto content with the statement that
Lieutenant Murray, in the <i>Lady Nelson</i>, discovered the bay
on February 15th, 1802, that he named it Port King, called a hill
on the right of the entrance Arthur's Seat, and compared the
shores to Greenwich Park.</p>
<p>For further and more full particulars of the bay, the
description of Flinders, who entered it about six weeks after
Murray left it, is quoted almost as if he had been the original
discoverer, although he spent a much shorter time inside the
Heads than Murray, who was almost a month in the bay. In fact
Flinders is the only one who has ever done any justice to the man
who bore off from him the prize of the discovery, for it is he
who has published the few facts which have been recorded of
Murray's expedition.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable instance of the small value often attached
to important discoveries when first made, that the log of the
<i>Lady Nelson</i>, in which Murray so minutely describes every
day's proceedings, should have been immediately laid aside, and
since it was sent to England have possibly only been read through
for the first time by the author, in the Record Office, within
the last four or five years. It was with no ordinary interest and
pleasure that he perused this document, containing the first
writing ever committed to paper within the bay upon which now
stands his native city. The reader has already had an
introduction to the log in the last chapter.</p>
<p>With a despatch to the Duke of Portland, of May 21st, 1802,
Governor King forwards the log and charts, and says that he hopes
these documents "will convince your Grace that that highly useful
vessel, the <i>Lady Nelson</i>, has not been idle, since under my
direction, and although Mr. Murray unfortunately does not possess
the qualities of an astronomer and surveyor, yet I trust his
efforts and success will, in proportion to his conduct as a
seaman and officer, more effectually ensure your Grace's
recommending him for his being confirmed as a Lieutenant in the
Navy, and in the command of the <i>Lady Nelson</i>, which I hope
he will appear deserving of."</p>
<p>Had Murray been as good a penman as many discoverers who have
not had half as much to relate, he would have published some
account of his proceedings, which would have prevented them from
being even temporarily forgotten. It is not to be supposed that
the writers on Victorian exploration, who have derived their
information from Colonial sources, could have given the
particulars now brought to light; for the log of the <i>Lady
Nelson</i>, the only written record of Murray's exploration, has
been in this country almost from the time of its first
existence,&mdash;having, as we have seen, been sent from Sydney
within less than two months of the date of the return of the
vessel to that port, March 24th, 1802. It is time, therefore,
that the exact facts of the discovery should be made public,
especially when we find a recent writer like Mr. Trollope stating
that, Flinders "is the first who has left us any record of his
having landed on the country which we now call Victoria."</p>
<p>It need scarcely be added that Mr. Rusden, whom Mr. Trollope
mentions as his authority upon the early history of the colony,
and who is as accurate as any writer can be who has not consulted
the documents in the Record Office, has written nothing from
which the statement in question could even be inferentially
drawn.</p>
<p>The author being curious to see, if extant, some account by
Murray himself, of his great discovery, instead of the meagre,
second-hand statements of it which alone are current, inquired at
the Record Office, and finding that the log of the <i>Lady
Nelson</i> was there, obtained permission from the Admiralty to
inspect and copy it.</p>
<p>This valuable document requires that the following important
corrections should be made in the statements which have so long
been accepted respecting the discovery of Port Phillip Bay. The
date of that event is upwards of six weeks earlier than that
which is generally assigned to it,&mdash;being Tuesday, January
5th, 1802, and not February 15th; and the Heads were first
entered on February 1st or 2nd, by Mr. Bowen, first mate of the
<i>Lady Nelson</i>, who was sent round from Western Port with
five men in the launch of that vessel, to examine the entrance;
Murray prudently thinking that, as he had been obliged to turn
away after nearly getting into the bay on January 5th, it was
advisable that such an investigation should take place before
making a second attempt to take in his ship.</p>
<p>On failing in the first, Murray steered towards Cape Otway and
then down to King's Island, returning to Western Port, January
31st,&mdash;the weather having, as usual, been most unpropitious.
Bowen was accordingly despatched early next morning, Feb. 1st,
and returned to the <i>Lady Nelson</i> in Western Port late in
the evening of the 4th, having accomplished his object; so that
unless he spent a night in the ocean, or on shore outside the
Heads,&mdash;which is not stated and seems very
improbable&mdash;he must have entered the bay on the 1st, and
remained inside it during the 2nd and 3rd, returning to the
<i>Lady Nelson</i> on the 4th.</p>
<p>The weather&mdash;of which Murray says in one entry in his
log, "I never experienced such a length of bad weather at any
time of year or in any country since I sailed the
seas"&mdash;again detained the <i>Lady Nelson</i> until Feb.
15th, when she sailed from Western Port, and safely anchored
inside Port Phillip Heads&mdash;the 15th being the date now
universally given as that of the first discovery. This confusion
of the day when the <i>Lady Nelson</i> sighted the Heads, with
that when she first entered them, ought not to have occurred; for
in the printed sheet in the British Museum, entitled
"Observations upon the Chart of Bass's Straits Combined", by
Ensign Barrallier, and referred to at page 46, it is correctly
stated that Murray discovered Port Phillip, January 5th, 1802,
and that it was "examined by him from 14th February to 11th
March."</p>
<p>Not only is no point on the bay, which he was the first to
enter, called after Bowen, but his name is altogether forgotten,
even if it were ever publicly mentioned in connexion with the
discovery. He at least deserved to have one of the Heads called
after him; and the other should have borne the name of Murray,
which also has not been attached to any place in the territory in
the exploration of which he rendered such valuable services.
Surely it can never be too late to make reparation to the
memories of deserving men! Bowen, who appears all through the
expedition as a most active and efficient officer, and valuable
assistant to Murray, must not be confused with his name-sake, who
was subsequently engaged in founding the first settlement in Van
Diemen's Land, at the Derwent.</p>
<p>Having thus briefly stated the important corrections in the
history of the discovery of Port Phillip Bay, it will be
desirable to go more into detail respecting Murray's proceedings,
and to give some considerable extracts from his long-forgotten
log. This document is not written in the most accomplished
literary style&mdash;the writer almost invariably spelling were
"where", and sure "shure." It is, however, full of important
particulars; and besides recording the ordinary monotonous facts
as to wind and weather, ship's courses and concerns, is very
descriptive of the incidents of the voyage.</p>
<p>On Nov. 12, 1801, the <i>Lady Nelson</i> sailed out of Port
Jackson upon her memorable expedition, to fill up the few
remaining blanks in the map of the coast-line of our present
colony, and to more completely examine some points already
discovered. Murray was also to extend his investigations to some
of the islands in Bass's Strait. He accordingly, in the first
instance, proceeded to Kent's Group, which he reached Nov. 20th,
and quitted Dec. 5th, anchor being cast at Elizabeth Cove,
Western Port, on the 7th.</p>
<p>The log records, as we have seen in the last chapter, the
incidents of the ship's stay in that harbour. She was detained
for several days after being made ready for sea, sometimes by too
light and at others by too strong winds,&mdash;being obliged to
go back to her safest anchoring-grounds on two or three occasions
when she attempted to leave the port. It was fortunate that she
did not get out; for such a violent gale came on, that Murray
expresses doubts if she could have stood it had she been
outside.</p>
<p>At length the famous Tuesday, January 5th, 1802, arrived; and
we shall learn, in the words of Murray himself, what
happened:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"At * 4 a.m. a light Wind sprung up at East, got our
kedge, hove short loosed sails and hove up; made sail for
Elizabeth's Cove. At half-past 6 a.m. came to an Anchor, sent our
Empty Casks on Shore and compleated our Water. In Launch. At 9
a.m. hove up and made Sail down the Port. Wind at S.E. and a
Stiff breeze with Clear Weather. At noon Cape Shanks bore N.W.
distant seven miles, Grant's Point N.E. by E. ten or twelve
miles, and Philip's Island East twenty miles.</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* It will be observed that in this log the days
begin at noon; so that this first paragraph appears under the
head of January 4th.]</p>
<blockquote>"Winds from S.E. to East with Clear Weather. At a
Quarter past one p.m. Cape Shank bore N.E. b. N; nine miles. Kept
running down along the Land Steering West and West by North in
order to train the whole of this Land along. Found it impossible
to survey any part of the Coast as yet from the numerous Natives
Fires which cover'd this low Shore in one volume of Smoke.** At 3
p.m. we saw a head Land bearing W.N.W., distant about twelve
miles, and an opening in the Land that had the appearance of a
Harbour N.W. ten or twelve miles. Bore away for this last, it
having the appearance of fine Steady Weather although the Wind
now Blowing was dead on the whole of this Shore. Yet I knew she
would work off in case we were deceiv'd. Accordingly kept
standing down for this entrance which every minute, from its
appearance, made us shure it was a good Harbour. At 5 p.m. saw a
small Island in the entrance, and observed that between it and
the main lay a Reef in appearance. On my seeing this we bore away
to the Leeward of this Rock, and I had the 1st Mate and
Boatswain's Mate *** at the Mast Head looking out. At this time I
suppose we were within 1&frac12; mile of the entrance, as we
thought, and I perceiv'd that the Sea Broke Short and was withall
heavy, hove the Lead and found only ten fathoms Water. Astonished
at this I hauled our Wind and called out to them at the Mast Head
to know if they saw any danger, but none was at time seen. I bore
away again and deep'd into eleven fathoms, when Mr. Bowen called
out Rocks Ahead; immediately hauled our Wind and stood off. On
closer observation of my own, and going often to the Mast Head, I
saw that the Reef did nearly stretch across the whole way, but
inside saw a fine Sheet of smooth Water of great extent. From the
Wind blowing dead on this Shore and fresh, I was obliged to haul
off under a press of Sail to clear the Land, but with a
determination to overhaul it by and by, as no doubt it has a
Channel into it, and is apparently a fine Harbour of large
extent. Kept pressing Sail, and by 8 p.m. the extreams of the
Land bore from N.W. to West; distance twenty miles, I fancy. It
luckily happen'd that the Wind blow'd about as much as our vessel
likes, and I am convinced that, under our circumstance, no vessel
would have done more. I wish I could say as much for her in Light
Winds. During Night Tack'd off and on every two hours. At
day-light the haze over the Land prevented our seeing it, as the
Wind blow'd at East and E.N.E. with a heavy Sea on. I did not
like to bear down on a Lee Shore, and so kept our Wind.
Stretching over for the Westernmost Side of the Bay&mdash;it is
proper to observe that no part of this Bay as yet has been
Survey'd owing to the <i>Sea Wind</i>, and the before-mentioned
numerous Fires of the Natives; but as our Courses and distance
were all with a free Wind till we haul'd off, and then also we
made a Streight Course and little Lee way, there will no great
mistake be found in that part of this Bay laid down till 8 p.m.
from our run from Western Port; the apparent Soil of all the Land
from abreast of Elizabeth's Cove to Cape Shanks is excellent,
after you round Cape Shanks and stand down to the Westward the
Land is invariably Low and Sandy with little humocks here and
there of Grass, and small Bushes till you get down as far as this
supposed Harbour. On the opposite side of it the Land gently
rises a little for about ten or twelve miles, seemingly good
Ground; it then Sweeps away in a long bight of Low Land which we
just could perceive at Sun down. Had the Wind moderated or the
Sea gone down, I would certainly have run down to that Low Land
and train'd it along as well as every other part of this Bay; in
the present State of Wind and Sea it would not have been prudent
or safe. At Noon saw the distant appearance of Land on our
Larboard Beam, and from our Latitude observ'd 38&deg; 48' 04", I
take it to be somewhere near about Cape Shanks. Bore away for
Cape Albany.* Ends in gloomy Weather and the Scud passing over
head from the S.W. Had Altitudes for Time Keeper one Set giving
Longitude 144&deg; 35' 00", and the second Longitude 144&deg; 35'
15" East. All this twenty-four hours Sounded Gd. from forty-five
to thirty-three fathoms. Sand mix'd with Shells and Brown
Specks."</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[** This was possibly only that deceptive blue,
hazy, atmospheric appearance, which in summer often alarms even
experienced bushmen, making them think that bush fires are upon
them, whereas the haze is either the result of heat or produced
by smoke blown from bush fires at a considerable distance.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** In a subsequent entry Barnes is the name
given to the boatswain's mate.]</p>
<p class="foot">[* At first named Cape Albany Otway, but since
the colonization of the territory known as Cape Otway.]</p>
<p>The entry of January 6th, 1802, is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Fresh Winds from S.E. to N.E. and a very high Sea up
owing, 3 fancy, to the late long Gale. Kept running for Cape
Albany, and by 7 p.m., having nearly run into its Latitude and
Longitude, took one Reef in the Topsail and Main Sail and Stow'd
small Sails. Stood off and on during Night. In the Morning it was
very hazy, otherwise we would have seen the Land. At 7 a.m."
(January 7th) "bore up West and W.N.W., being nearly in its
Latitude, and at half-past nine a.m. saw it (Cape Albany) bearing
W.N.W., ten or twelve miles distance, and Cape Danger N.W.,
sixteen or seventeen Miles; both these capes make with a white
Sandy Front and Middling high. All the Land between is Sandy
hills and long Sandy Beach, as also what part of the Land we saw
stretching into Portland Bay. Sounded Ground (all these
twenty-four hours) every two hours, and found no difference in
the Soundings (which were from thirty-three to thirty-eight to
thirty-two), the Ground being invariably Sand mixed with Shells
and Brown Specks, sometimes a little gravel till the last time,
when we had only twenty-four fathoms fine Sand. At this time Cape
Albany bore N.W., twenty-six or twenty-seven Miles. At Noon
hauled our Wind for Harminger Rock, but owing to the very heavy
Sea and wind we did not make better than a S.E. course, the
vessel Labouring and pitching a great deal. The Latitude Observed
was 39&deg; 46' 22" South. A.M. had altitude for Time Keeper
giving 1st Set 144&deg; 04' 00", and 2nd Set 144&deg; 04' 15"
East, and the Latitude at Noon at this time was 39&deg; 20' 00"
South.<br>
<br>
"<i>Thursday</i>, 7<i>th January</i>, 1802.&mdash;From Noon till
5 p.m. Strong Winds at N.N.E. and a confus'd heavy Sea on, the
vessel Labouring much. . . . At 5 p.m. we had several Squalls
from N.W. to S.W., and so hot as to resemble the Steam of an Oven
with a Firey looking Sky; this Weather in half an hour settled
into a hard Gale at S.W. Close reef'd the Top Sails and handed
them. Close reef'd the Main Sail; sent down the Top Gallant Yards
and Masts. Up Fore Sail and Lay too Under close reef'd M. Sail
and Storm Stay Sail; by 7 a most tumultuous Sea was up; we
laboured much and lurch'd very heavy. At 8 p.m. it moderated a
little with Rain, and from that till 4 a.m." (January 8th) "we
had partial Squalls. Made some Sail; at 6 a.m. it clear'd up. Set
close reef'd Top Sails; at 8 up Top gallant Yards and Masts, and
Set the Sails, out all reefs, intending to make Governor King's
Island while this clear Weather continued. It will be seen that
the unfavourable Winds and Weather have totally prevented me from
either tracing the Coast from Cape Shank to Cape Albany, as also
after making Cape Albany, from being able to run on Straight
Course to Harminger Rock; both of these Points, however, will be
attempted afterwards&mdash;had Altitd. for Time Keeper 1st Set
giving Longd. 145&deg; 08' 15"; 2nd Set 145&deg; 09' 30", which
causes me to suspect there must be an Easterly Current running.
At Noon fine clear Weather and Smooth Water, a thing rather new
to us. Latitude by an Altitude of &#9737; Lower Limb 39&deg; 58'
46" South."</blockquote>
<p>Subsequent observations made on the afternoon of the same day,
the 8th, Murray says, "confirmed me in an opinion that we must
have been driven to the eastward. Accordingly at three p.m.,
seeing no land from the mast-head with a clear horizon, hauled
our wind to the westward." The log records that about six o'clock
on the morning of the 10th,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Saw the Loom of the Land from the Mast Head, which I
take to be Governor King's Island; its Southern most Point bore
S.W. Southerly distant sixteen Miles, and its North Wester most
Point or Extreams W.N.W., fourteen or fifteen Miles. We only
could see it now and then as the Squalls passed over it. At 7
a.m. we had some hard Squalls at W.N.W. and W. b. N., which made
us lower our Top Sails to them; they where attended with hard
Rain. At 8 it cleared a little, but in a Quarter of an Hour was
Black and Squally again. Kept working up to this Land, which I
rather think, from its Longde., is part of the same that on the
Sixth I saw, and supos'd the Northern most Cape of it to be Cape
Danger, and another Cape Albany. I have not, however, seen either
of them yet, but will, in making the Circuit, easily know them,
both being Sandy Bluffs. Got Altitude for the Chror., giving
Longitude, 1st Set 143&deg; 57' 45", and 2nd Set 143&deg; 59'
45". Tacking Occasionally to gain the Land, but made little of it
from the Strong Wind and Confused Sea running . . . Latitude
observed 39&deg; 53' 07"."</blockquote>
<p>On the 11th the <i>Lady Nelson</i> anchored in Elephant Bay,
so called from "a great number of Sea Elephants of an immense
size lying asleep on the beach. On Elephant rock, which was about
one and half miles in circumference, there might have been 6 or
7000 seals of different sizes." The entry of the 17th, when the
ship had returned to that bay, states:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"We have now overhauled and Surveyed the Island from
its N.W. and Westermost Points to its South West Points, being in
length about fifty-five or sixty Miles, and although the Westerly
Winds that have blown for such a length of time has retarded our
Voyage, yet they have enabled us to Strictly Search every part of
this Island between the before-mentioned points, and should a
N.E. Wind come and remain Steady for a few days we will be able
to overhaul the remaining part of ye Island with equal accuracy.
Of the advantages to be derived from this fine Island I shall say
but little, the plain truth is to be seen in this
journal&mdash;it contains plenty of Wood and Water; the Woods are
full of animals, and excellent of their kind; the Shores are
lined with fine Oil (if I may be allow'd the expression), and
this part of the Island has two good Bays in it well Sheltered
from all the dangerous Winds that I understand blow in this
Country. It is a fact that all along this Coast a vessel may
anchor (as I did) unless the Wind blows from the East, S.E.,
N.E., or North Points of the Compass. It is proper to observe
that I named this last discovered Bay The Bay of Seals, from the
number of those animals on the Shores of it, and the Rocks
outside of this Bay Seal Rocks."</blockquote>
<p>Murray afterwards ran as far south as Three Hummock Island,
and, returning to King's Island in the forenoon of the 27th,
"stood for the Sand Capes or Bluffs", the largest and
perpendicular one of which he named Cape Farewell, and "took a
departure from it, intending to run to Cape Albany."</p>
<p>At noon the latitude observed was 39&deg; 25' 18". "Until 8
p.m." the log reports,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Had variable Winds and hot, sickly Weather, and a
dull, fiery sky, and so thick that we could not see above a mile
ahead. Kept making our course for Cape Albany as the wind would
allow."</blockquote>
<p>At four in the morning of the 28th they were obliged to lie to
in a gale with a very high sea. The altitude gave Longitude
143&deg; 30' 40" and the latitude observed was 39&deg; 12' 33".
Murray says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"This Weather has again rendered abortive my plan of
getting the direct line of bearing and distance between Cape
Farewell and Cape Albany Oatway. It is useless to animadvert on
it. I shall only observe that I never experienced such a length
of bad Weather at any time of the year, or in any country since I
sailed the seas. . . . At noon wore to the S.W." and did so again
to N. at 8 p.m. At the same hour next morning (29th) tacked to
the S.W. "A.M. Had Altitude for time-keeper, one set giving
longitude 144&deg; 28' 45" east, and [2nd set 144&deg; 25' 00"
**] these differ from Dead Reckoning twenty miles; therefore an
easterly current must run if the chronometer speaks truth. At
noon the gale rather increased, with most surprising heavy
squalls, hail, and rain. Latitude observed 39&deg; 16' 48" south.
Tacked in a very high sea to the northward. . . . Kept pressing
sail in order (if possible) to gain some westing."</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[** Words in brackets are struck out in pencil in
the log.]</p>
On the 30th,&mdash;
<blockquote>"At half-past 5 a.m. saw the Land bearing from W.N.W.
to N.E., distant about six or seven leagues. Tacked to the S.W.
At 8 a.m.; the body of this Land bore N.W., distant about eight
or nine leagues. At half-past 9 a.m. tacked and stood in for the
Land; sounding every hour. . . . At noon we chanced to get the
sun's Altitude, giving Latitude 38&deg; 49' 00", So. Longitude
from time-keeper 144&deg; 05' 00", and Longitude by Dead
Reckoning 143&deg; 46' 45"; course N. 37&deg; W., and distance
twenty-seven Miles. As the Weather again looked much like a S.W.
gale we tacked and stood off from the Land, its North-western
cape bearing N.W., distant four leagues, and its North-eastern
extreams N.E. b. N. four or five leagues. The North Cape of this
Land makes Bold, and no Low Land was to be seen to the northward
of it. [It is to be observed that if this is Cape Albany it lies
twenty Miles to the Northward of what Lieut. Grant has laid it
down in.***] The very bad weather has again prevented me at this
time from overhauling this Cape or tracing the adjoining
Coast."</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[*** Sentence in brackets is struck out in
pencil.]</p>
<p>Murray seems at times to have been doubtful as to his
position. On the 10th, we have seen, he was uncertain whether the
two capes of King's Island were not those which he had previously
described as Cape Albany (Otway) and Cape Danger; and he says
nothing afterwards to clear up the point. We shall now find him
arriving unexpectedly at the next place he reached. There can be
no doubt, however, as to Western Port, where he had previously
been with Lieutenant Grant in April and May, 1801, of Kent's
Group, King's Island or Port Phillip Bay, at all of which he
remained some time.</p>
<p>We shall continue in his own words the record of his sail on
the 30th and 31st,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"At 4 p.m.," on the former, "tacked to the N.W. in
order to keep hold of the Land till more favourable Weather came.
At 8 p.m. again tacked; hazy cloudy weather. At 12 p.m. again
tacked, and stood in for the Land all Night. At 6 a.m." (January
31st) "saw it bearing North five or six leagues distant. At
half-past 9 a.m. had Altitudes for chronometer, 1st set giving
Longitude 144&deg; 12' 15" [and 2nd set 144&deg; 18' 30" *] At
this time the Northern point of Land bore North, distance twelve
miles, and its North-eastern extreams N.E. b. N. fourteen miles.
Made sail in for it with Top-gallant sails, Royals, and all our
small sails. At 10 a.m. perceived with surprise it was Cape
Shanks and Grant's Point instead of Cape Albany. I now judged it
most prudent to get in, and send our boat down to overhaul for a
Channell into the Harbor mentioned in the log of the 5th of this
month. Accordingly stood in for it, and by noon Cape Shank bore
N.W., distant six or seven miles, and Grant's Point N.E. b. E.
ten or eleven miles. We had a very heavy Swell, and perceived the
Surf about Seal Island Breaking in a fearfull manner. Sounded
every hour as pr. colume . . . . Fine Weather and fresh Winds
from S.E. to East; latterly it closed in with Wind at S.W. and
hazy Weather. At 2 p.m. passed Seal Island and kept standing up
the Port. Observed that the long range of Breakers on the Western
Side of the Port had, several of them, shifted their berths
nearer to Mid-channell, and instead of lying in an East and West
direction now lay almost North and South; the whole of them, for
several Miles, Broke incessantly and remarkable lofty; we passed
within two Miles of them. The Reefs on the Eastern Side also
broke much farther out than ever I saw them do before. In short,
the Mid-channel up this Port has (by the immense run of bad
Weather) apparently been made a great deal narrower than when we
left it a month ago. We Sounded all the way up and had from
seventeen to four fathoms."</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Drawn through in pencil.]</p>
<p>And now, in the very next sentence, are recorded the
interesting particulars of the prompt despatch of Bowen to
investigate the entrance to Port Phillip Bay,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"By 5 p.m. got to an anchor in Elizabeth's Cove with
the Best Bower, and moored with the Kedge; out Boats and got the
Launch ready for sailing in the morning to explore the Channel of
the Western Harbor before-mentioned. I went on shore in the gig.
Found the well as we left it, full of fine clear Water, and our
Board of directions hanging at the entrance of the Pathway, which
was still in good order and level. At 4 a.m." (Feb. 1st) "I sent
the Launch with Mr. Bowen and five men, armed with fourteen days'
provision and water, down to the Westward as intended, giving him
particular instructions how to act both with respect to the
Harbor and the Natives, should he fall in with any; the substance
of which was, that on finding a Channell into the Port he would
take marks proper for coming in with the vessel and immediately
return to me, and at all times to deal friendly with the Natives
if they would allow him, but not on the other hand to run any
risk or be trifled with. It may now be proper to observe that my
intentions are that, if a passage into that Harbor is found, I
will take the vessel down into it and Survey it as speedily as
circumstances will allow; from that trace the coast to Cape
Albany, from Cape Albany run strait to Cape Farewell and
Harbinger Rocks; (and if time) after that follow up the remainder
of my Orders."</blockquote>
<p>The return of Bowen on Feb. 4th, from his successful
examination of the entrance to Port Phillip, is thus recorded in
the log of that date&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"At half-past 9 p.m. the Launch returned on board all
well. Mr Bowen reported that a good Channel was found into this
new Harbor Water from ten fathoms to six, and about a mile and a
half broad; and according to his account it is a most noble sheet
of Water, larger even than Western Port, with many fine Coves and
entrances in it, and the appearance and probability of Rivers. A
number of Shells where found on its Beaches; Swans, Pellicans,
and Birds of various Sorts where seen in great numbers&mdash;the
boat's crew lived on Swans all the time they were away. No Water
was as yet found, the officer having no time to spare, nor no
natives seen, but numbers of their huts. In short, from such a
Report as I have received, and of the truth of which I have no
doubt (as the attention and care of this officer has always been
conspicuous), it would be unpardonable in me not to give this New
Harbor a strict overhaul."</blockquote>
<p>At length arrived Monday, Feb. 15th 1802,&mdash;a day much to
be respected, but which has too long deprived two other worthy
days of the honour of the first discovery and entry of Port
Phillip Bay. The Log records that on Sunday&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"At 7 p.m. a breeze sprung up at S.E., with drizzling
rain; it continued all night, and at 4 a.m." (Monday 15th) "we
took up kedge in gig, loosed sails, and hove short. At 5 a.m.
weighed and made all sail down the Port. By 8 a.m. Grant's Point
bore E. b. N. distant ten or eleven miles, and Cape Shanks N.W.
distant seven or eight miles. Kept running down along the Land at
about eight or nine miles distant. Wind at S.E., hazy, foggy
Weather. At half-past 10 a.m. Cape Shank bore E.S.E. distant
fifteen miles, and the South Head of the New Harbour or Port N.
b. E. eight or nine miles distant. By noon the Island in the
entrance of this Harbour bore north &frac12; a mile distant. At
this time we had a view of part of this Spacious Harbour; its
entrance is wide enough to Work any vessel in, but a ten-fathom
bar stretches itself a good way across, and with a strong tide
out and the Wind in the ripple, is such as to cause a Stranger to
suspect Bocks or Shoals ahead. We carried in with us Water from
fourteen to six fathoms. Kept standing up the Port with all sail
set."</blockquote>
<p>The description is thus continued in the entry headed the
15th, which according to log-keeping begins at noon,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Fresh Winds from S.E. to South, and hazy Weather
throughout. Working up the Port with a very strong Ebb against us
we however gained ground. The Southern Shore of this noble Harbor
is bold, high Land in general, and not clothed as all the Land of
Western Port is with thick Brush, but with Stout Trees of various
kinds, and in some places falls nothing short in Beauty and
Appearance from Greenwich Park. Away to the Eastward, at the
distance of about twenty miles, the Land is Mountainous; in
particular, there is one very high Mountain, which in the
meantime I named Arthur's Seat, from its resemblance to a
mountain of that name a few miles from Edinburgh. To the N.E. b.
N., about five miles from the South Shore, lies a cluster of
small Rocky Islands, and all round them a Shoal of Sand. Plenty
of Swans and Pelicans were found on them when the Boat was down,
from which I named them Swan Isles. To the N.E. b. E. there is an
opening, and from our Masthead no Land could be seen in it The
Northern shores are low, with a Sandy Beach all along. At
half-past 3 p.m. we got to anchor in a Sandy Cove in seven
fathoms Water, Bottom fine Sand, Swan Isles bearing N.E. b. N.
distant five miles. A Bold rocky point, which I named Point
Patterson, E.S.E. 1&frac12; mile; a long Sandy point, named Point
Palmer, West 1&frac12; mile; and the nearest point of the Shore
S.W. quarter of a mile distant. Handed sails, &amp;c., out boats,
and I went on shore and walked through the Woods a couple of
miles. The Ground was hard and pleasant to walk on, the Trees are
at good distances from each other, and no Brush intercepts you;
the soil is good as far as we may be judges. I saw several
Native's Huts, and very lately they have burnt off several
hundred Acres of Ground. Young Grass we found springing up over
all the ground we walked; the only Birds we saw were a few
Parrots; we found some Shells on the Beach, and returned on
board. I have named this Harbor Port King ** in honor of the
Governor, P.G. King, under whose Orders I act. Set a Third watch
of People with an officer. In the morning"&mdash;of the
16th&mdash;"sent the Gig to Swan Isles for Swans, and on board we
caught a few Bock Fish. Employed on Sundry jobs about our
Rigging. At noon the Gig returned with three live and four dead
swans."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<i>Tuesday</i>, 16<i>th</i>.&mdash;Fine weather
throughout. Wind N.E. After Dinner I took a Walk through the
Woods of this part of the Country, attended by one soldier and
our carpenter to examine the Wood. To describe this part I walked
through is simply to say that it nearly resembles a Walk on
Blackheath and the Park if we set out of Question the Houses and
Gardens of the latter: the Hills and Valleys rise and fall with
inexpressible elegance. We discovered no water, nor any new Wood
of consequence, but it is impossible a great want of Water can be
here from the number of Native Huts and Fires we fell in with in
our march. From the top of a High Hill I ascended, and casting my
eyes to the N.N.E. a large Sheet of Water was seen which I am
induced to think is either a Harbour or a large River. We also
perceived that this Port trained away up under Cape Shanks. On
our return to the Boat Andw. Lusk found a perfect Nautilus shell;
he made me a present of it. Indeed it is but common justice to
observe that the invariable good, attentive, and decent behaviour
of this old man, ever since he joined this vessel renders him a
fit object of mercy. This day a few snappers were caught, and
some Bock Fish. At sundown a native Fire was seen about a mile in
land. In the morning early" (17th) "I sent Mr. Bowen and Bond,
armed, to speak them. Neither fell in with them. At 9 a.m. hove
up our Bower with a light air at N.E. and dropped a few miles
further up the Port. We now saw the same fire just lighted by the
Natives and presently perceived several of them come out of the
Bush, but the moment they saw the vessel they sprung into the
Woods out of Sight. At 11 a.m. we came to an anchor in five
fathoms Water, handed Sails, &amp;c. as there was a native Fire
Burning a little way in Land, I sent the Launch with Mr. Bowen
and four hands, armed, to see if any Natives where here, and
before the Boat was half-way on Shore, we had the satisfaction of
seeing eighteen or twenty men and boys come out of the Wood, and
seat themselves down on a Green Bank waiting the approach of our
Boat, with which I had sent some Shirts and other trifles to give
them. The Boat accordingly landed in the midst of them, and a
friendly intercourse took place with dancing on both sides. In an
hour the Boat returned. Mr. Bowen had dressed them in our White
Shirts, and invited them on Board. This, however, they declined,
but exchanged for all this. Got a Basket of Straw neatly enough
made. They where all clothed in the skins of oposums, and each
had a Bundle of Spears, a Stone Mogo, and one Basket. They wished
much to know what our Arms where, and their use, and did not seem
entirely to believe Mr. Bowen that they were only walking-sticks.
No women where amongst them. I sent the Boat again with some
Bread, Looking-Glasses, Tomahawk, and a Picture, as Presents to
induce them to part with some of the Weapons and Dresses, as also
to inform us where there was water. Ends in fine Weather, Wind
N.E."</blockquote>
<p>The following is in the margin,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"This day all hands put upon two-thirds allowance of
bread."<br>
<br>
"<i>Wednesday</i>, 17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Light airs inclinable to
Calm throughout this twenty-four hours. The Boat (as mentioned in
latter part of yesterday's Log)"&mdash;forenoon of same
date&mdash;"proceeded to the Shore and were as before, received
in a friendly manner by the natives, all of whom were seated in a
circle on a beautiful spot of Grass near a high point of Land.
Mr. Bowen and all the crew, consisting of five men and the boy,
Mr. Brabyn, went up with their Dinners in their hands and sat
down in the midst of them (eighteen in number) and began to eat,
showing the Natives how to eat Bread, &amp;c., and gave them
anything they chose to ask for. Mr. Bowen gave them all the
things I had sent as well as several of his own things, stripping
himself almost naked to comply with their wishes, and his example
was followed by the whole of the boat's crew. As there was two
fine-looking boys amongst them I sent Mr. Brabyn on shore
purposely to see and gain their confidence by his attention to
their youngsters, both of whom he dressed in his shirts,
handkerchiefs, trousers, &amp;c. All matters continued in this
state while our people had anything to give, and all we got was
two spears, a basket, and a mogo, and even these they again took
from the seaman that had them in keeping. This, however, the
officer took no offence at, being determined, if at all possible,
to keep on friendly terms with them. It was in vain that the
officer and crew tried (by signs too significant not to be
understood) to gain intelligence where water was to be found or
on what Beaches Shells where most Plenty. To all such inquiries
they turned a deaf ear, and only seemed intent on getting what
our People had&mdash;even to the last Shirt. By this time our
People had nearly finished their Dinner, and Isaac Moss, having
the Boat in charge, got up and was slowly walking down to her. At
this time the boy Brabyn happened to turn his head towards the
Wood, and saw a man in the very act of throwing a spear at Moss,
as well as a large body (not before seen) behind a large fallen
Tree, with their spears all in readiness for throwing. The boy
immediately cried out to Mr. Bowen (who was at that very time in
the act of serving out Bread to all the party he was sitting
among) that he would be speared, but before the Words where out
of his mouth a Spear of a most dangerous kind was thrown at, and
did not escape Moss by a yard, and in an instant the whole of the
treacherous Body that Mr. Bowen and four of our people where
sitting in the midst of, opened to the right and left and at once
left them all open to the party in ambush, who immediately were
on their Feet and began to throw Spears. Still such was the
forbearance of the officer, that only one piece was fired over
their heads, but this was found only to create a small panic, and
our party where obliged to teach them by fatal experience the
effect of Walking Sticks. The first fire made them run, and one
received two Balls between his Shoulders. Still some of them made
a stop to heave. The second fire they all set off with
astonishing speed, and most likely one received a Mortal Wound.
Before another piece was Fired, Mr. Bowen laid hold of one of
their number, and held on till three of our people came up and
also grappled him. Strange to tell, he made such violent
struggles as to get away from them all; nor did the contents of
the Officer's piece bring him up, although one Ball passed
through his Arm and the other in the Side. He was traced a good
distance by his Blood. The remaining pieces where by this time
Fired, and our party gave Chase to them all. On Board I kept a
strict look-out with the Glass, and as we lay only little more
than a quarter of a mile off the point they where seated on, I
plainly saw the Natives running through the woods, which was by
no means thick. One fellow in particular had been dressed in one
of my White Shirts, and the Officer had tyed the Wrists of it
with String which hindered his getting it off. Him we plainly saw
from the vessel pass the roots of black Trees with such speed as
more to resemble a large white Bird flying than a man. To
increase their Panic as they passed along I gave them a discharge
of our Guns loaded with round and grape, but am almost certain
they did them no damage. By this time our people returned from
the chase, having found on their way back a number of Spears,
Dresses and Baskets, &amp;c. Made the Boats Signal and they came
off. Thus did this Treacherous and Unprovoked Attack meet with
its just punishment, and at the same time taught us a Useful
Lesson to be more Cautious in future. With respect to the size of
these Natives they are much the same as at Sydney, their
Understandings are better though, for they easily made out all
our signs when it answered their purposes or inclination. When it
did not they could be dull enough. They were all Cloathed in
Oposum Skins, and in each Basket a certain Quantity of Gum was
found. Not the least sign of a Canoe has been seen. I conclude
they live entirely inland, and, if we may judge from the Numbers
of their Fires and other Marks, this part of the Country is not
thin of Inhabitants. Their Spears are of various kinds, and all
of them much more dangerous than any I have yet seen. The
workmanship of their dresses, their Lines and Baskets are far
from despicable. Their Mogos or Stone Axes are such as are common
at Sydney. In the afternoon the Boat went to Swan Isles and
caught three live Swans of large Size, and in the morning" (the
18th) "the Launch went with Mr. Bowen and a party well-armed to
sound for a Channel, round which the vessel might sail in order
to survey the Port. Usefully employed on board. It is rather odd
that the Fish here have as yet invariably taken away our Hooks,
to the number of between thirty and forty, and but few are
caught. Latitude observed, 38&deg; 20' 00".<br>
<br>
"<i>Thursday</i>, 18<i>th</i>.&mdash;Pleasant Weather throughout.
Employed as necessary. P.M. the Launch returned, having been
fortunate enough to discover plenty of Fresh Water, and a Channel
all round this part of the Port from ten Feet to fourteen
Fathoms. A.M." (the 19th) "I took a long range through the Woods
attended with an Armed Party; we discovered nothing new, but
found several of the things we gave the Natives, which in their
Fright they had dropped. The ground we walked over was open, and,
the same as before described, with good soil. The Tide where we
lye flows full and change at three Hours in the afternoon, and
its perpendicular rise is about six feet up and down.<br>
<br>
"<i>Friday</i>, 19<i>th</i>.&mdash;Calm. Do. Weather. This Day
another Overhaul of the Wood took place, but nothing (not before
mentioned) was found. Numbers of Natives' Tracks, Fires, and Huts
were seen. As Usual sent the Launch to Swan Isles, and she got
three live ones. Observed that to-day the Surf on the Sea Shore
broke with great noise, and also for the first time observed a
Sand Boiler bearing N.E. b. E. of us, and distant about three
Miles; and from the Mast Head to the W.N.W., at eight or nine
Miles distance, several Breakers where seen. Employed as
necessary. Scoured our Decks and cleaned below. Ends in hot
Sultry Weather, but clear. One Native Fire in Sight on Arthur's
Seat, distant about ten Miles.<br>
<br>
"<i>Saturday</i>, 20<i>th</i>.&mdash;Light Airs inclinable to
Calm, and fine Weather throughout. Variously Employed. Sent an
Armed Party and our Carpenter a long range through the Woods to
try the different Kinds of Wood. None, however, was found of Use,
the Trees being almost invariably Oak, and other Wood Quiet
common at Sydney. A Bed Waistcoat of Mr. Brabyn's was found with
some Bread in each Pocket. In this he had dressed one of the
Native Boys, who in his fear left it, I fancy, as soon as he
found how to get it off, for it was Buttoned on him. A.M." (21st)
"sent the Launch for Swans. I have to observe that the Breakers
mentioned in Yesterday's Logs disappeared in the Afternoon, as
also the roaring of the outside Surf took off about midnight, and
this morning about 9 a.m. we were visited by the Tale of a Smoaky
S.W. gale, which, however, by noon came to nothing. Querey, if
there has not a Gale from the S.W. been blowing a little distance
off&mdash;ends in Fine Weather.<br>
<br>
"<i>Sunday</i>, 21<i>st</i>.&mdash;S.W. Winds and Mid good
Weather throughout. P.M. the Launch returned on Board with five
Swans. P.M. Punished Thos. Smith with two dozen Lashes for being
Drunk thirty-six Hours on a Stretch and behaving with insolence
to both officers. Bond, the Soldier, also had a Quart and half a
pint of Spirits stole from him. Smith must have taken it, but we
could not bring it home to him. A.M." (22nd) "Finding we could
not move higher up the Port with the Vessel I sent the Launch
over to the Western Side to examine the passage into an Harbor or
River I saw from the Hill on the 16th Inst. Usefully Employed.
Sent the small Boat to Fish. Ends in fresh Breezes at S.W. and
Clear Weather.<br>
<br>
"<i>Monday</i>, 22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Gloomy Weather and Fresh Winds
at S.W. throughout. The small Boat caught a few Rock Fish and
returned on Board. At Noon the Launch returned, having found an
entrance into the Sheet of Water they were sent to Overhaul, but
only at High Water seven or eight Feet on it, consequently no
Harbour for Shipping; the Boat proceeded a Mile and an half up,
and in running that caught twenty Swans of large size without
wasting one charge of Shot (which, by the bye, is now become a
scarce article, not above three or four lbs. being in the
vessel); however, from the report made of the place, as it may
lead to something of more consequence, I shall, after the survey
of the Port is completed, give it a good Overhaul. I must mention
here that both our Boats are now in such a state of decay, from
Age and constant mending and patching, that they both keep a hand
constantly bailing when pulling or sailing. This Circumstance, it
is needless to mention, in a certain degree retards our
proceedings. Employed on Board on our Rigging, &amp;c. Ends in
hazy Weather and S.W. Wind.<br>
<br>
"<i>Tuesday</i>, 23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Gloomy Weather and moderate
Winds at S.W. P.M. I went in the Launch and Sounded a few Miles
of the Port up towards the watering place; the Soundings were
Nine Feet to Six Fathoms, bottom fine Sand (further out perhaps a
deeper Channel may exist; this will of course be ascertained in
the proceeding of the Survey); afterwards we walked through the
Country some distance; found the soil invariably good, the Ground
almost clear, and the ranges of Trees as regular as they are in
general in Parks, with fine strong Short Grass under Foot.
Employed as necessary. Ends in Light Airs and Close hazy
Weather.<br>
<br>
"<i>Wednesday</i>, 24<i>th</i>.&mdash;First part of this
twenty-four Hours we had a great deal of Thunder, Lightening, and
hard Bain. Mid and latter parts it Blew a hard gale at S.W., with
Squalls at Intervals; it is with satisfaction I can observe we
held on (although all ataunto) with the small Bower and one third
of a Cable out, a proof of the goodness of the holding Ground.
Employed as necessary. Cut a Boat Load of Wood. Expended two
decayed Scrubbing Brushes, and one Rudder Iron broke in the
Launch.<br>
<br>
"<i>Thursday</i>, 25<i>th</i>.&mdash;First Part the Gale
continued. Mid and latter Fresh Winds at S.E. and clear.
Occasionally Employed. Observed several very large Native's Fires
at the Foot of Arthur's Seat and on the Western Side of the Port;
hauled our Seine several times along the Shores nearest us, but
caught no Fish, owing probably to there being Flats of Sand lying
of them to the distance of 200 Yards. The Freshness of the Wind
hindered our getting a Base line by two Latitudes to-day. Got the
distance of the &#9737; and &#9790; nearest Limbs. Ends in fresh
Winds at S.E. and Clear.<br>
<br>
"<i>Friday</i>, 26<i>th</i>.&mdash;First and Mid parts fresh
Winds and clear; latterly Calm pleasant Weather. P.M. Examined
the Beach and Land for about eight Miles. A.M." (27th) "Sent our
Long Boat on Shore; turned her up and set our Carpenter to work
on her, she leaking so much as to keep (even alongside) a hand
constantly bailing, and our small Boat is so bad as to render it
hazardous to go any distance from the Vessel in her. A.M. got the
distance of the &#9737; and &#9790; nearest Limbs.<br>
<br>
"<i>Saturday</i>, 27<i>th</i>.&mdash;Fine Weather and moderate
Winds throughout Variously Employed; both Boats Employed Sounding
and on the Survey of the Harbour. A number of very large Native's
Fires on the Hills round the Eastern and Western Shores of the
Port have been seen these two days past. A.M." (28th) "Sent Mr.
Bowen and Mr. Brabyn in the Gig to get the Latitude of the
Northern end of Swan Isles, and at noon I got the Latitude of a
point about seven Miles North and South of them, from which a
Base line was got for the Survey of the Harbour.<br>
<br>
"<i>Sunday</i>, 28<i>th</i>.&mdash;Do. Winds and Weather.
Employed as needfull. Gave some of the People Liberty on Shore,
&amp;c.<br>
<br>
"<i>March</i>, 1802.&mdash;<i>Monday</i>, 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;Fine
Weather and moderate Winds. Occasionally Employed. At 5 a.m."
(2nd) "took up our Kedgc, hove Short, loosed Sails and Sheeted
home the Top sails. Weighed and made Sail up the Port intending
to run as high as the Watering Place; the Wind in a little time
died away, and the Tide ran so rapid as to Sweep the Vessel on a
Shoal of Sand with only five Feet Water on it; as it was
perfectly smooth we immediately hove her off without her
sustaining the least damage, and dropped back into our old Berth
between Point Patterson and Bowen's Point, so named from Mr.
Bowen's Skirmish with the Natives on it. Moored with the Kedge.
Ends in Calm hot Weather. The Flies are now got so troublesome as
to almost hinder a person from sitting a moment in one place.<br>
<br>
"<i>Tuesday</i>, 2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Calm Pleasant Weather
throughout. Employed getting on Board Stones for Ballast and
Stowing Do. away. At 4 a.m." (3rd) "sent the Long Boat for a turn
of Water and to Sound that part of the Harbour between the vessel
and it; by noon she returned on Board with a turn of Water; it
was found that a Bank of Sand lay from Shore to the Distance of a
Mile, or a Mile and a Quarter with only four, five, six, seven,
and eight Feet on it at low Water, and it extends nearly four
Miles along Shore; when you have passed this there is from five
to nine Fathoms Water up abreast of the Watering Place. There is,
however, little doubt of a deep Channel being outside of this
Shoal, and this Point will be ascertained in the course of
Tomorrow.<br>
<br>
"<i>Wednesday</i>, 3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;First part Moderate Winds at
S.E. Mid part Calm; latterly a Breeze sprung up at S.W. with
Cloudy hazy Weather. Employed on our rigging, &amp;c. At 4 a.m."
(4th) "sent the Long Boat for a Load of Water, and also to make a
traverse going and coming and sound all the way.<br>
<br>
"<i>Thursday</i>, 4<i>th</i>.&mdash;Gloomy Weather and Moderate
Winds throughout. Employed as necessary. P.M. the Launch returned
on Board with a turn of Water, but had not been able to find a
Channel fit for vessels of any Draught of Water, although she
stood well out from the Shore to at least three miles. This Bank
has only from four to eight Feet Water on it, and in many places
is not above 100 Yards Broad. Then immediately you fall into
seven, eight, and nine Fathoms and carry such Water up Abreast of
the Watering place; it is very probable that at a good distance
from the Shore there exists a Channel of deeper Water round the
Edge of this Sand Bank, and this point shall not be left
undetermined. A.M." (5th) "again sent the Long Boat for Water and
to Sound. Ends in gloomy Weather and drizling rain.<br>
<br>
"<i>Friday</i>, 5<i>th</i>.&mdash;First and Mid parts hazy dull
Weather, and now and then drizling rain; latterly the Weather
cleared up. P.M. the Launch returned with a Load of Water.
Employed getting it on Board and Stowing it away. A.M." (6th) "I
went in the Launch in search of a Channel by which vessels of
larger Draught of Water than ours might get up Abreast of the
Watering Place, and was fortunate enough to find one of a Mile at
least in Breadth, lying off the Southern Shores of this Port
about three or three and a half Miles, and having from ten to
sixteen Fathoms Water in at low Water and Neap Tides; and in this
Water a Vessel of any Draught may lie secure from all Winds. At
about a Mile and a half from the Spring at which to-day I loaded
the Boat with Water and examined it, as far as we are judges, it
is most excellent Water, as clear as Cristal, lies from the Beach
about ten or a dozen Yards, and plenty of it to Water the Grand
Fleet of England; it is nearer the Entrance than the Foot of
Arthur's Seat by about two Miles, and can easily be found out by
the Land, which a few Miles before you come to it is low, whereas
all the other Land on both Sides is High with Bold points, if a
Boat Stear East or E. b. S. from Point Paterson nine Miles, and
puts into the Shore, they will not be far off it. There is plenty
of Ducks about it, but so shy that only two have been shot, a
circumstance we did not a little regret as they exceed in flavour
any I ever eat. We are now compleat in Water, and will soon be
Wooded. In the morning, Weather in the way. I intend going over
into the Sheet of Water mentioned in the Log of Monday, the 22nd
February, in order to see what it contains.<br>
<br>
"<i>Saturday</i>, 6<i>th</i>.&mdash;Fine Weather throughout. Wind
variable to S.W. Employed on Board fitting new Waist Cloths, the
others being Quiet decayed, and her sides and Bends being very
bare, I gave them a Coat of Red (the only Colour we had on Board)
and Blacked the Bends and Upper Works. I went in the Launch over
to the Sheet of Water (as intended) with an Armed Boat's Crew,
and by noon" (7th) "got to its entrance. This day has been so
clear that we were able to see Land all round the Port, and, in
many places, very high Head Lands in those low places where we
could not be certain of Land by the eye. There were numerous
Native's Fires; indeed all round the Port to-day there were
Native's Fires, and some of them very large.<br>
<br>
"<i>Sunday</i>, 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Fine Weather throughout. Winds
from S.W. to N.W. to N.E. Employed as necessary. By 1 p.m. I got
into the Sheet of Water and by pulling all round it, found it to
be a very extensive Sheet of Water, but in few places more than
six Feet Water, and the greatest part of it so Shoal as to Ground
the Boat; in the entrance at one place there is a small Channel
of about 50 or 60 Feet in Breadth, with from 9 Feet to &frac12; 2
Fathoms Water in it, but of no use as it Shoals to a couple of
Feet before you get in the Soil of the Land. All round this
extensive place is good and its appearance exceeds in Beauty even
the Southern Shores. The number of large Swans seen almost
exceeds belief, but by this time most of them could Fly, we
however caught Eleven; Ten of which were large. All of us slept
this night on a pleasant little Island with a few handsome Trees
on it. Soil good and so clear as to be fit for the Hoe at once. I
named it Maria Isle, after a sister I lost some Years past. A.M."
(8th) "we had another Chase after Swans, and returned on Board.
Ends in pleasant fine Weather.<br>
<br>
"<i>Monday</i>, 8<i>th</i>.&mdash;First and Mid parts Stiff Gale
at S.W., latter more moderate with Clear Weather. Necessarily
employed, as we now intended Sailing in a few days. I judged it
consistent with His Majesty's Instructions (a copy of which I was
furnished with from the Governor, and Commander in Chief of New
South Wales) to take possession of this Port in the Form and
manner laid down by the said Instructions, and accordingly at 8
o'clock in the morning," (9th) "the United Colours of the
Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland were hoisted on Board and
on Port Patterson and at One o'clock under a discharge of three
vollies of small arms and artillery the Port was taken possession
of in the name of HIS SACRED MAJESTY GEORGE <small>THE</small>
THIRD <small>OF</small> GREAT BRITAIN <small>AND</small> IRELAND
(KING) &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Served double allowance of Grog.
In the afternoon I went on Shore attended with an armed party and
passed the remainder of the Day about and under the Colours
flying on Shore; at sun down hauled down the Colours on Board and
ashore. Observed the Distance of the Sun and Moons nearest Limbs
on Point Patterson.&mdash;Note, this Log contains 31 Hours, and
ends at &#9737; Down."</blockquote>
<p>And now we must for a moment break the thread of Murray's
interesting narrative, to do homage to the flag which, on that
famous March 9th, 1802, was first unfurled in Port Phillip Bay.
Thanks to the progress of colonization, the Union Jack is no
longer as Murray describes it, "the United Colours of the
Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland." in the restricted
geographical sense in which he seems to use the words. It is the
flag of a United British Empire which embraces Australia, South
Africa, and Canada; and every true son and friend of the new
territory which we have just seen brought for the first time
under the shadow of that flag, as well as of the mother country,
and of all our world-wide Colonial dominions, must earnestly hope
that that flag may for ever float over them all, as the pledge
and symbol of their perpetual unity in the grandest, strongest,
most free, and pacific Empire which has ever arisen in the annals
of the human race, or can henceforth appear upon the face of this
globe.</p>
<blockquote>"<i>Tuesday</i>, 9<i>th</i>.&mdash;Hazy Weather and
moderate Winds at S.W. throughout. Employed getting ready for
sea. Overhauled our Keels Fore and Aft. Cleaned them &amp;c. We
have now Expended 19 Weeks and one Days Provisions, out of 24
Weeks we were victualled for, commencing on the 27th of October
1801, and owing to the Quantity of Bread decayed along with what
the Swans and other Birds have eat, we are rather short, even
what we have left is very bad; therefore it will not be in my
power at this time to prosecute the object of our Cruize much
further; it is in vain that I regret so little having been done
in such a length of time; the Weather and other Circumstances
have been rather against us the whole Cruize, however the little
that is performed of the Original Orders, is pretty Accurate, and
I trust will give the Commander in Chief some satisfaction.<br>
<br>
"<i>Wednesday</i>, 10<i>th</i>,&mdash;Fresh Winds from S.W. to
S.E. and hazy Cold Weather throughout. Occasionally Employed
making ready for Sea. Sent a party to Overhaul the Beach and
Woods. PM got the Distance of the &#9737; and &#9790; nearest
Limbs. For these last two or three days great numbers of Natives
Fires have been seen all round the Port, except between Arthur's
Seat and Point Palmer. Draught of Water aft 5 Feet 9
Inches,&mdash;Forward 4 Feet 10 Inches.<br>
<br>
"<i>Thursday</i>, 11<i>th March</i>, 1802.&mdash;First and Mid
parts Moderate Winds at S.E. with hazy Weather, latterly a light
Breeze at N.E. and from that to E.S.E. Employed securing
everything for Sea. At 4 a.m." (12th) "hoisted in the Launch
after Picking up our kedge, sent Top gallant yards aloft, hove
Short and loos'd Sails. At 7 a.m. Weighed and made Sail down the
Port, by 8 a.m. with a strong Tide of Ebb running out we got into
the entrance Carrying all the way from 9 to 16 Fathoms Water, we
then fell into such a ripple, that we expected every moment it
would break on Board, having now from 10 to 7 and 8 Fathoms
Water, we however got clear out, and by &frac12; past 9 a.m. the
point of Entrance bore N.E. b. E. distance 3 or 4 Miles, and a
remarkable high Nob of Land (if not an Island) W.N.W. 4 or 5
miles. By noon the Entrance bore N.E. b. N. 9 or 10 miles.<br>
<br>
"As at the last Change the Tide Flow'd at &frac12; past One p.m.
and on the full at 3 Hours it is probable that the long Shoals
that lye from the Shore cause this difference, the Longitude is
nearly 145&deg; 00' 00" East. This is by two Lunars and its
corresponding situation to Elizabeth's Cove, but there may be an
error of 10 or 15 miles in this Calculation. Latitude observed

<p>The <i>Lady Nelson</i> experienced very severe weather between
Wilson's Promontory and Kent's Group, so much so that on March
18th, the log records that, "by the continual Labouring and
Pitching of the vessel, she in many places of the Deck Leaks, as
also all round her Bows, and this kind of Weather has caused us
to lose Sixteen fine Swans"; and on the 20th there is an
entry&mdash;"Lost in addition to the others, Six more fine Swans,
owing to the incessant labouring of the vessel." On the 22nd she
was obliged to lay to in "a most furious squall"; and at length,
after her very stormy and eventful cruise, the gallant ship and
crew once more safely anchored in the noble harbour of Port
Jackson, on Wednesday, March 24th, 1802. The following is the log
entry for that day:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Fine Weather throughout, inclinable to Calm at
&frac12; past 3 p.m South Head bore S.S.W., the North Do. N.N.W.
distant 4 or 5 miles. At 4 p.m. passed Bradley's Head at 6 passed
Garden Island and by &frac12; past 6 p.m came to an anchor in

<p>It may perhaps be thought that, during so long a stay in Port
Phillip, a good deal more might have been done in the way of
exploring the country, especially when it is remembered what
Flinders did in the few days he was in the harbour. There
certainly was time enough for Murray to have sent a party on foot
to walk round the bay; but the only examination by land of any
importance, which he seems to have made, was his ascent of the
high hill mentioned in the log of February 16th. This can
scarcely have been Arthur's Seat, or he would have said so,
having already named that mount. But it must be remembered in
Murray's favour, that his boats were unseaworthy, his provisions
rapidly failing, and that he and his crew had undergone all the
hardships of a long cruise in unusually severe weather; so that
they were in no condition to have undertaken any extensive land
explorations. The natives too had given them reason to apprehend
danger to any, necessarily small, party which could have been
spared from the ship. Flinders undoubtedly accomplished more
during his much shorter visit; but, when everything is said,
Murray and his right-hand man, Bowen, are in all fairness
entitled to very high praise for their great achievements, and to
full credit for having done their best under the most difficult
circumstances in which they were placed.</p>
<p>What subsequently became of these two worthy men, the author
has not ascertained. Of the fate of their gallant little ship,
this will perhaps be the most convenient place to speak, although
we shall hear of her again in connexion with the history of that
bay which she discovered. In a despatch of March 16th, 1815, Gov.
Macquarrie says,&mdash;"The <i>Lady Nelson</i> brig is still very
serviceable", she is again mentioned in 1816-17, Oxley in May,
1819, examined Port Macquarrie in her; and a few years
subsequently there is something said about her having been
supplied with a mast and yard. Capt. Bremer speaks of her in
connexion with the formation of a settlement at Melville Island.
Her ultimate fate is mentioned in a printed account from the
"Sydney Gazette" of the Settlement on the North Coast. This
document, which is in the Record Office, is by a Mr. George
Miller, who had served in North Australia for four years. He
states that the <i>Lady Nelson</i>, in company with three other
vessels, left Sydney August 25th, 1824, and anchored in Port
Essington, September 20th. Want of water preventing the formation
of a settlement there, the expedition established itself on
Melville Island. In December or January, "the <i>Lady Nelson</i>
was again despatched for live-stock; and the commander of the
<i>Stedcombe</i>, having landed a portion of his cargo, tendered
his vessel for the conveyance of buffaloes; his tender was
accepted, and both vessels sailed for the islands nearly at the
same time, but never returned. Some time after, I learned that
both vessels had been cut off by the Malays on one of the small
islands to the north of us, and all on board massacred." In a
printed account of the voyage of Lieutenant Kolff in 1825,
through the southern part of the Archipelago of the Malaccas, by
Mr. Earl, communicated by the Geographical Society to the
Colonial Office, it is mentioned, under date September 8th,
that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The brig left the Arras, and on the following day
arrived at Vordate, the northernmost of the Timorlaut Group. . .
. The following day they anchored near Larrat. . . . The year
previous to the visit of M. Kolff, an English brig, which had
arrived on the south-east part of the island to obtain
provisions, was captured by the natives and the crew murdered,
with the exception of two youths who were saved by the women. One
half of the crew were on shore at the time of the attack, and the
two youths who were saved were with them. Some unsuccessful
efforts were made by M. Kolff to obtain them. They were on the
opposite side of the island."</blockquote>
<p>A note says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"This brig was probably the British Colonial vessel,
<i>Lady Nelson</i>, which left the settlement at Melville Island
to obtain provisions, and was never heard of
afterwards."</blockquote>
<p>The name "Amherst" is in print, and "Nelson" in writing, put
as a correction in the margin.</p>

<i>Investigator</i>&mdash;Sir John Franklin.</p>
<p>A<small>LTHOUGH</small> the name of Captain Matthew Flinders
has hitherto occupied greater prominence, in connexion with the
discovery of Port Phillip Bay, than that of Lieutenant Murray,
there can be little doubt that he would be the last to grudge
that officer full credit for the one great achievement which will
prevent his name from being ever forgotten. But though Murray
carried off the palm for the discovery, the visit of Flinders to
the harbour must always rank only second in importance and
interest. It was the result of circumstances which the
distinguished navigator has himself described in his valuable
work.</p>
<p>Flinders informs us, in his "Terra Australis," that, on the
return to England of the <i>Reliance</i> at the latter end of
1800, a plan for the investigation of the coasts of Australia was
submitted to and approved by the Government. On January 19th,
1801, he was commissioned as lieutenant to command the sloop
<i>Investigator</i>, which had previously borne the name of
<i>Xenophon</i>. She was a vessel of 334 tons. The equipment was
on a liberal scale. The East India Company undertook to
contribute 1200<i>l</i>., "the voyage being within the limits of
the Company's Charter." Flinders's instructions, which were of
considerable length, directed him to proceed st to the coast of
New Holland for the purpose of making a complete examination and
survey of the said coast." The <i>Investigator</i> carried with
her eighty-eight persons.</p>
<p>She sailed from Spithead July 18th, touched at Madeira,
reached the Cape October 16th, and left it November 4th. The
Australian coast was sighted at Cape Leeuwin December 6th, and
King George's Sound entered two days later. Here some time was
spent in examining the country in the immediate vicinity, and in
preparing the ship for her further voyage.</p>
<p>She took her departure from the Sound January 5th, 1802, and
coasted along the Australian Bight, reaching Fowler's Bay, "the
extremity of the before-known south coast of Terra Australis," on
the 28th. From thence Flinders proceeded with the discovery and
examination of the coast to the eastward. Coffin Bay was reached,
and named after Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin, February 16th. Port
Lincoln was entered on the 26th, and named, says Flinders, "in
honour of my native province."</p>
<p>Quitting this place March 6th, the vessel proceeded to examine
Spencer's Gulf, and reached, on the 9th, to five leagues beyond
Cape Lowly. Next day Flinders proceeded in the cutter to about
the same distance higher up, till on the 11th the "oars touched
the mud on each side, and it was not possible to proceed
further." Having gone up the west side of the gulf, the explorer
returned down its eastern shores, which he also thoroughly
examined, and arrived at Hardwicke Bay on 19th.
<i>Investigator</i>'s Strait was next entered, and the north
coast of Kangaroo Island and the Gulf of St. Vincent were
discovered and subjected to the same searching examination which
distinguishes Flinders's expedition. Backstairs Passage was
sailed through April 7th.</p>
<p>Next day the meeting with Baudin, the French navigator, took
place, and is thus described:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Before two in the afternoon we stretched eastward
again; and, at four, a white rock was reported from aloft to be
seen ahead. On approaching nearer, it proved to be a ship
standing towards us; and we cleared for action in case of being
attacked. The stranger was a heavy-looking ship, without any
top-gallant masts up; and, our colours being hoisted, she showed
a French ensign and afterwards an English Jack forward, as we did
a white flag. At half-past five, the land being then five miles
distant to the north-eastward, I hove to; and learned, as the
stranger passed the leeward with a free wind, that it was the
French national ship <i>Le G&eacute;ographe</i>, under the
command of Captain Nicolas Baudin. We veered round as <i>Le
G&eacute;ographe</i> was passing, so as to keep our broadside to
her, lest the flag of truce should be a deception; and, having
come to the wind on the other tack, a boat was hoisted out, and I
went on board the French ship, which had also hove
to."</blockquote>
<p>Flinders was accompanied by Mr. Brown, the naturalist, who
acted as interpreter. Baudin stated that he had examined the
south and east of Van Diemen's Land, and had been separated from
his companion ship, <i>Le Naturaliste</i>, in a gale on March
21st; but that he had since "explored the south coast from
Western Port to the place of our meeting, without finding any
river, inlet, or shelter, which afforded anchorage." He had,
therefore, passed Port Phillip Bay without noticing the entrance,
a few days after Murray had sailed out of it.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 9th, Flinders again went on board the
French ship and described his recent discoveries to Baudin. The
place of meeting is given as "35&deg; 40' S., and 138&deg; 58'
E.," at which Flinders observes, "the <i>discoveries</i> made by
Captain Baudin upon the south coast have their termination to the
west, as mine in the <i>Investigator</i> have to the
eastward."</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this meeting, and the fact of the discoveries
made by the <i>Lady Nelson</i>, of which these French navigators
must have been aware&mdash;having been at Sydney subsequently to
their interview with Flinders&mdash;M. Peron, the naturalist of
the expedition, in his published account of the voyage, coolly
ignores the fact of the discoveries made on the south coast by
Grant, Murray, and Flinders, and asserts that D'Entrecasteaux,
"n'ayant pu lui-m&ecirc;me s'avancer au-del&agrave; des
&icirc;sles St. Pierre et St. Francis, qui forment la limite
orientale de la terre de Nuyts, et les Anglais n'ayant pas
port&eacute; vers le Sud leurs recherches plus loin que le Port
Western, il en r&eacute;sultait que toute la portion comprise
entre ce dernier point et la terre de Nuyts &eacute;tait encore
inconnue au moment o&ugrave; nous arrivions sur ces rivages."</p>
<p>After quoting this extract, Flinders generously defends M.
Peron by expressing his belief that "what he wrote was from
over-ruling authority, and smote him to the heart; he did not
live to finish his second volume."</p>
<p>Flinders points out that the portion of the coast to which
Baudin was entitled, by right of first discovery, to give the
name of Terre Napol&eacute;on, was of but limited extent,
"between the latitudes 37&deg; 36' and 35&deg; 40' S., and the
longitudes 140&deg; 10' and 138&deg; 58' E. . . . making, with
the windings, about fifty leagues of coast." As the beginning of
this interval of 150 miles "cannot be placed further to the
south-east than Cape Buffon", the French had clearly no claim to
include any part of the present Colony of Victoria within the
limits of Terre Napol&eacute;on.</p>
<p>Two letters are to be seen in the Record Office,* in which
Flinders gives, probably, the earliest account of his meeting
with Baudin. It quite tallies with his statements in his
"Voyage," from which we have been quoting.</p>
<p class="foot">[* "New South Wales Correspondence," 1802.]</p>
<p>The first is a letter to the Admiralty, of May 11th, 1802, two
days after his arrival at Sydney, in which he says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"On April 8th, in latitude 35&deg; 42' south, and
longitude 139&deg; 10' east, I met with the French national ship
<i>Le G&eacute;ographe</i>, which had come from Bass's Strait,
and was proceeding westward in her examination of the south coast
of New Holland. Captain Baudin informed me that, after parting
with the <i>Naturaliste</i> in the Strait in a heavy gale, he had
had fine weather, and had kept the coast close on board from
Western Port to the place of meeting with us; but that he had
found no bay or place where a vessel could anchor, the coast
having but few bights in it, and those affording nothing to
interest."</blockquote>
<p>In a letter of May 20th, to Sir Joseph Banks, Flinders
says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Baudin "expressed some surprise at meeting me, whom
he knew by name, and observed that it was unnecessary for him to
prosecute his survey, as the coast was now already done, and
therefore he should come to Port Jackson when the winter weather
set in."</blockquote>
<p>All the coast-line, of which Flinders was the original
discoverer, belongs to the present Colony of South
Australia&mdash;of the entire sea-board of which, with the
exception of a short portion to the extreme west, and Baudin's 50
leagues, he was the sole discoverer. It would have been
impossible to omit a brief notice of the interesting and
important particulars connected with the approach of this great
Australian navigator to the shores of our Colony.</p>
<p>The <i>Investigator</i> sighted the coast of Victoria at its
extreme western point on April 18th, and proceeded eastward.
Flinders recognizes many of the most conspicuous points as having
been sighted and named by Lieutenant Grant, who, he informs us,
had been promoted to the rank of Captain. On the 23rd, anchor was
cast "under the north-east end of King's Island." Next day the
vessel stood for the mainland, and the following morning was
within ten miles of Cape Otway.</p>
<p>The preceding facts and extracts have been taken from
Flinders's book; but, in pursuance of our purpose of recording
the very earliest statements made by the explorers of whom we
speak, the following extract is given from Captain Flinders's
journal, in the possession of his family. It has been kindly
copied out and sent to the author by the navigator's grandson,
Mr. W. M. Flinders Petrie.</p>
<p>It will be observed that there is a discrepancy, as to the
date of the entry of Port Phillip, between the journal and the
"Voyage to Terra Australis", arising doubtless from the mode of
keeping logs, which is certainly confusing to landsmen. It
appears by the journal that the bay was entered April 27th; by
the book, the 26th. The real date, therefore, depends upon which
of these documents is in accord with civil, and which with
nautical time. If the journal, from which the extract immediately
appended is taken, gives the civil date, then Flinders's entry
into Port Phillip must be put down as having taken place on April
27th, instead of April 26th, as recorded in "Terra Australis",
and hitherto accepted as the day of that event. Mr. Flinders
Petrie, with whom the author has communicated on the subject,
writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"There is an entry, strange to say, on this very
subject in the journal, showing that the day was reckoned to
begin twelve hours before civil time. At the end of 27th April,
1802, one of the very days in question, it has been entered that
that day was continued to thirty-six hours to agree with civil
time; this entry was, however, dashed out, and was never acted
on, the next entry after the two twelve hours of 27th April being
begun as 28th April."</blockquote>
<p>The author is also much indebted to Mr. Flinders Petrie for
kindly copying and sending the following extracts from his
grandfather's journal:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">"Extract from <small>CAPTAIN
FLINDERS'S</small> Log of the <i>Investigator</i>.</p>
<blockquote>"1802, <i>April</i> 26.&mdash;Light breezes and
cloudy weather. At one, saw land bearing N. 59&deg; E. like an
island; hauled more up. At two, hauled close to the wind, seeing
low land running out to windward (E.S.E.). At dusk, the island
(seemingly) N. 59&deg; E. to 79&deg; E.; but there are spaces to
the northward where the land is seen only at intervals. Bent the
stream cable. Light airs and fine weather. At eight, tacked from
the shore. At two, tacked to the northward, and again at four to
the southward.<br>
<br>
"At 5.30, tacked towards land supposed to be an island, and which
was soon after seen to the north-eastward. As we neared the land
we found a low shore running in the front of the higher, supposed
island, and the north-westward, joining apparently all round.
Before eleven, bore away, rounding the head of the bight; the
bluff highest land N. 71 E., and an irregular rocky point N.
9&frac12; W. about six miles. At noon, there was the appearance
of an opening round the rocky point, but it seemed to be narrow
and to break nearly across from the rocks off the point to the
opposite head, which is a low bluff.</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="center">"(Remarks accompanying the above
day.)</p>
<blockquote>"From the square-topped point of yesterday the land
trends to the N.N.E., becoming gradually lower until it is very
low land. There is one remarkable hummock, which may be either an
island or a hill near the sea-side; it bore N. 5&deg; W. at
sunset. The land like an island seems to be high land, more
especially at its western end, where it slopes off suddenly, and
the land to the northward seems to be further distant; whence I
judge that between them may be the Western Port of Mr. Bass,
although its distance is not equal to what I supposed of that
port. In the morning the joining of low land to the bluff mount
prevented us from thinking any further that we were near the
Western Port, and until noon no idea was entertained of any
opening existing in this bight; but at that time an opening
became more and more conspicuous as we ran farther west, and high
land at the back appeared to be at a considerable distance;
still, however, I entertained but little hopes of finding a
passage sufficiently deep for the ship, and the narrowness of the
entrance prevented me from thinking it the west entrance into
Western Port.<br>
<br>
"1802, <i>April</i> 27.&mdash;Mod. breezes and fine weather. Soon
after noon, hauled up for the opening. At 1&frac12; h., entered
the opening; kept away to clear a ridge of rocks running off from
the E. point, towards which the ebb set us. At 2.30, tacked on
coming upon the edge of a shoal, and afterwards occasionally
between it and the south shore, working upwards. At 4&frac12; h.,
the water shoaled suddenly, and, the flood being made, drifted us
upon a mud-bank before the ship came round, where she stuck fast.
Lowered down the gig and sounded round the ship, finding it shoal
to the eastward. Hoisted out the cutter and carried out a kedge,
by which we hove her off, but she struck almost immediately
against another bank of ten feet. Sent the cutter to sound, and,
getting the ship's head to the deepest water, she went off, and
the water soon deepened to four, six, and ten fathoms, upon which
we came to with the best bower and furled sails. Light breezes
and fine weather. A.M.&mdash;Head breezes and fine weather,
overcasting at times. Took the cutter up the port in order to
ascend the bluff mount to the eastward, and see the general form
of the port, and lay off the shoals. Employed on board in drying
the sails, which had gotten wet in the sail-room from leaks
during the last gale. A large shark caught
alongside.</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="center">"(Remarks accompanying the above
day.)</p>
<blockquote>"From several appearances I at first judged this port
to be Western Port, although many others did not answer, for
Captain Baudin had met with no harbour along the coast after
leaving that; and from his account he had had fine weather and
kept the shore close on board to the time of his meeting us. The
entrance is about two miles wide, but the deep channel in does
not seem to be much more than one mile. After passing the
entrance, which may be safely done by keeping the rocks on the
eastern hand tolerably close on board, the port opens into a
spacious expanse of water, the northern boundary of which is not
visible from the mast-head. There is a middle bank, with shoal
water round it, about three miles from the entrance, and
passages, seemingly, on each side. We took the weathermost, or
southern passage, and found the water to run deep close to the
southern shore for some little distance. Afterwards, shoal water
appeared in places both near the shore and towards the middle
shoal, and we grounded as before-mentioned.<br>
<br>
"In the expedition to the bluff mount, which I judge to be about
seven miles from the ship, the naturalist and landscape painter
accompanied me. The view from the mount presented a large expanse
of water, the boundary to which was scarcely visible, and for
60&deg; to the northward could not be at a less distance than
fifteen miles, and may probably be twice as much; and round the
furthest visible point on the western shore the water extended to
the south-westward until lost behind the land. No island, the
middle dry shoal excepted, or other object appeared in the port
to attract attention; but it seemed to be an immense basin of
water, most of which may probably be shoal. In going and
returning, however, we had tolerably regular soundings from four
to seven fathoms, passing a little without the place where the
ship grounded. To the eastward, three or four leagues, a
considerable space of water appeared which seemed to be shoal,
but having communication with the sea; this may probably be
Western Port."</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Flinders Petrie adds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The above is copied verbatim from Capt. Flinders's
log."</blockquote>
<p>Thinking that Captain Flinders, whilst supposing himself to be
the first discoverer of the bay, had either given it a name, or
had one in contemplation for it, the author inquired of Mr.
Flinders Petrie, who wrote in reply, "Port Phillip is unnamed in
the journal, and only called 'No. 16 Port' in one or two
cases."</p>
<p>Having quoted from Flinders's description, entered in his
journal at the time of the voyage, it will now be desirable to
give some extracts from his "Terra Australis" concerning his
proceedings at Port Phillip. He says, under date Monday, April
26th, 1802,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"In the morning we kept close to an E.S.E. wind,
steering for the land to the north-eastward, and at nine o'clock
Captain Grant's Cape Schanck, the extreme of the preceding
evening, was five leagues distant to the N. 88&deg; E., and a
rocky point towards the head of the bight bore N. 12&deg; E. On
coming within five miles of the shore at eleven o'clock, we found
it to be low, and mostly sandy, and that the bluff head, which
had been taken for the north end of an island, was part of a
ridge of hills rising at Cape Schanck. We then bore away
westward, in order to trace the land round the head of the deep
bight, and at noon the situation of the ship and principal
bearings were as under:&mdash;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the west side of the rocky point there was a
small opening with breaking water across it; however, on
advancing a little more westward, the opening assumed a more
interesting aspect, and I bore away to have a nearer view. A
large extent of water presently became visible within side; and
although the entrance seemed to be very narrow, and there were in
it strong ripplings like breakers, I was induced to steer in at
half-past one: the ship being close upon a wind, and every man
ready for tacking at a moment's warning. The soundings were
irregular, between six and twelve fathoms, until we got four
miles within the entrance, when they shoaled quick to 2&frac34;.
We then tacked; and, having a strong tide in our favour, worked
to the eastward between the shoal and the rocky point, with
twelve fathoms for the deepest water. In making the last stretch
from the shoal, the depth diminished from ten fathoms quickly to
three; and, before the ship could come round, the flood-tide set
her upon a mud-hank, and she stuck fast. A boat was lowered down
to sound; and, finding the deep water lie to the north-west, a
kedge-anchor was carried out; and, having got the ship's head in
that direction, the sails were filled, and she drew off into six
and ten fathoms; and, it being then dark, we came to an
anchor.<br>
<br>
"The extensive harbour we had thus unexpectedly found I supposed
must be Western Port, although the narrowness of the entrance did
by no means correspond with the width given to it by Mr. Bass. It
was the information of Captain Baudin, who had coasted along from
thence with fine weather, and had found no inlet of any kind,
which induced this supposition; and the very great extent of the
place, agreeing with that of Western Port, was in confirmation of
it. This, however, was not Western Port, as we found next
morning;** and I congratulated myself on having made a new and
useful discovery; but here again I was in error. This place, as I
afterwards learned at Port Jackson, had been discovered ten weeks
before by Lieutenant John Murray, who had succeeded Captain Grant
in the command of the <i>Lady Nelson</i>. He had given it the
name of Port Phillip, and to the rocky point on the east side of
the entrance, that of <i>Point Nepean</i>.</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[** In the margin opposite this are the words
"Tuesday, 27th."]</p>
<blockquote>"Our situation was found in the morning to be near
two miles from the south shore, and the extreme towards Point
Nepean bore N. 83&deg; W. two leagues. About three miles to the
north-by-west were some dry rocks, with bushes on them,
surrounded with mud flats; and they appeared to form a part of
the same shoal from which we had three times tacked in 2&frac12;
and 3 fathoms. The mud-bank where the ship had grounded is
distinct from the middle shoal; but I am not certain that it is
so from the south shore, from which it is one mile distant. The
Bluff Mount (named <i>Arthur's Seat</i> by Mr. Murray, from a
supposed resemblance to the hill of that name near Edinburgh)
bore S. 76&deg; E.; but from thence the shore trended northward
so far that the land at the head of the port could not be seen,
even from aloft. Before proceeding any higher with the ship, I
wished to gain some knowledge of the form and extent of this
great piece of water; and Arthur's Seat being more than a
thousand feet high, and near the water side, presented a
favourable station for that purpose.<br>
<br>
"After breakfast I went away in a boat, accompanied by Mr. Brown
and some other gentlemen, for the Seat. It was seven or eight
miles from the ship, and, in steering nearly a straight course
for it, we passed over the northern skirt of the shoal where the
ship had touched, but afterwards had from seven to five fathoms
nearly to the shore. Having observed the latitude there from an
artificial horizon, I ascended the hill, and, to my surprise,
found the port so extensive that even at this elevation its
boundary to the northward could not be distinguished. The western
shore extended from the entrance ten or eleven miles in a
northern direction, to the extremity of what from its appearance
I called <i>Indented Head</i>; beyond it was a wide branch of the
port leading to the westward, and I suspected might have a
communication with the sea; for it was almost incredible that
such a vast piece of water should not have a larger outlet than
that through which we had come.<br>
<br>
"I took an extensive set of bearings from the clearest place to
be found on the north-western bluff part of the hill; and we
afterwards walked a little way back upon the ridge. From thence
another considerable piece of water was seen at the distance of
three or four leagues; it seemed to be mostly shallow, but as it
appeared to have a communication with the sea to the south, I had
no doubt of its being Mr. Bass's 'Western Port.'"</blockquote>
<p>Flinders says that the soil at Arthur's Seat "was superior to
any upon the borders of the salt water which I have had an
opportunity of examining in Terra Australis," and that
"quantities of fine oysters were lying upon the beaches, between
high and low water-marks."</p>
<p>The work proceeds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"We returned on board at dusk in the evening; and at
daylight" (on the 28th) "the anchor was weighed with the
intention of coasting round the port with the ship. The wind was
at north-east, but the flood-tide was in our favour; and, having
made a stretch toward the middle shoals, we tacked and ran E.S.E.
along their south side until past eight; when, the flood having
ceased, we came to in seven fathoms. At slack water in the
afternoon we again steered eastward, but were obliged to anchor
from want of wind; and found that this slow mode of proceeding
was not at all suited to the little time for which we had
provisions remaining, besides that, there was much probability of
getting frequently aground; the plan of examining the port with
the ship was therefore abandoned.<br>
<br>
"Having left orders with Mr. Fowler, the first-lieutenant, to
take the ship back to the entrance, I went in a boat early next
morning," (the 29th) "with provisions for three days, in order to
explore as much of the port as could be done in that
time."</blockquote>
<p>The explorer first proceeded "past the second rocky point
above Arthur's Seat. The wind being at north-west, I was
obliged," he says, "to land behind some rocks more than two miles
short of the third point, but walked to it with my surveying
instruments. This was nine miles from the Seat, and the farthest
part of the shore seen from thence; further on the shore falls
back more eastward, in long sandy beaches, and afterwards curves
to the north-west; but it was lost to sight long before joining
the land on the west side of the port. After taking angles, and
observing for the latitude and longitude, I rowed to the windward
for Indented Head, five leagues off. . . . We landed at nine
o'clock at night, near the uppermost part which had yet been
seen."</p>
<p>On the morning of the 30th, the explorers "proceeded westward
along the shore", and had some friendly communication with the
natives, whose knowledge of fire-arms Flinders, at the time,
attributed to their having seen him shoot when he did not observe
them; but, he remarks, "it had probably been learned from Mr.
Murray." The entry proceeds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"At noon I landed to take an observation of the sun,
which gave 38&deg; 7' 6" for the latitude; my position being
nearly at the northern extremity of Indented Head . . . . and
after a dinner, of which the natives partook, we left them on
friendly terms to proceed westward in oar examination. The water
became very shallow abreast of a sandy point," probably Point
Richards, "whence the shore trends nearly south-west; and there
being no appearance of an opening to the sea this way, I steered
across the western arm, as well to ascertain its depth as with
the intention of ascending the hills lying behind the northern
shore. Two of the peaks upon these hills had been set from the
ship's deck at sunset of the 25th, at the distance of
thirty-seven miles; and, as their elevation must consequently be
a thousand feet or more, I expected to obtain from thence such a
view of the upper parts of the port as would render the coasting
round it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
"The width of the western arm was found to be six miles; and the
soundings across augmented rapidly to six fathoms in mid-channel,
and then decreased in the same way; but there was less than three
fathoms at two miles from the northern shore. That side is indeed
low and marshy, with mud-banks lying along it; and we had
difficulty in finding a dry place to pitch the tent, and still
more to procure wood wherewith to cook the ducks I had shot upon
the banks.<br>
<br>
"<i>Saturday, May</i> 1.&mdash;At day-dawn I set off with three
of the boat's crew for the highest part of the back hills called
<i>Station Peak</i>. Our way was over a low plain, where the
water appeared frequently to lodge; it was covered with
small-bladed grass, but almost destitute of wood, and the soil
was clayey and shallow. One or two miles before arriving at the
feet of the hills, we entered a wood where an emu and a kangaroo
were seen at a distance; and the top of the peak was reached at
ten o'clock. My position was then 21' of latitude from Point
Nepean, in the direction of N. 28&deg; 30' W., and I saw the
water of the port as far as N. 75&deg; E. at the distance of
seven or eight leagues; so that the whole extent of the port,
north and south, is at least thirty miles. The extremity of the
western arm bore S. 15&deg; 45' W., which makes the extent, east
and west, to be thirty-six miles; but there was no communication
with the sea on that side, nor did the western arm appear to be
navigable beyond seven miles above where I had crossed it.
Towards the interior there was a mountain bearing N. 11&deg; E.,
eleven leagues distant; and so far the country was low, grassy,
and very slightly covered with wood, presenting great facility to
a traveller desirous of penetrating inland.<br>
<br>
"I left the ship's name on a scroll of paper, deposited in a
small pile of stones upon the top of the peak; and at three in
the afternoon reached the tent, much fatigued, having walked more
than twenty miles without finding a drop of water. Mr. Lacy, the
midshipman of the boat, had observed the latitude at the tent
from an artificial horizon to be 38&deg; 2' 22", and Station Peak
bore from thence N. 47&deg; W.<br>
<br>
"In the evening we rowed back to Indented Head, and landed there
soon after dark."</blockquote>
<p>At this place they passed the night, and next day caught three
swans at "what Mr. Murray called Swan Harbour, but which," says
Flinders, "I have taken the liberty of converting into <i>Swan
Pond</i>," the water having been found so shallow, and full of
mud-banks. "At the south side of the entrance, upon the sandy
peninsula, or island as it is when the tide is in, I shot some
delicate teal, and found fresh water in small ponds."</p>
<blockquote>"The ship was lying about three miles within the
mouth of the port, near to the south shore; and, after I had
taken bearings at two stations on the sandy peninsula, we steered
a straight course for her, sounding all the way. It appeared that
there was a passage up the port of a mile wide, between the
middle banks and the western shore, with a depth in it from 3 to
4&frac12; fathoms. On the western extremity of the banks I had
2&frac12; fathoms, and afterwards, 5, 7, 4, 7, 8, 9, 9 to the
ship.<br>
<br>
"Lieutenant Fowler had had a good deal of difficulty in getting
back to the entrance of the port; owing in part to the western
winds, and partly from the shoals, which do not seem to lie in
any regular order. He had touched upon one of these, where there
was ten feet on one side of the ship, and, on the other, five
fathoms. This seems to have been a more eastern part of the same
shoal upon which we had before grounded; but no danger is to be
feared from these banks to a flat-floored ship.<br>
<br>
"I find it very difficult to speak in general terms of Port
Phillip. On the one hand, it is capable of receiving and
sheltering a larger fleet of ships than ever yet went to sea;
whilst, on the other, the entrance, in its whole width, is
scarcely two miles, and nearly half of it is occupied by the
rocks lying off Point Nepean, and by shoals on the opposite side.
The depth in the remaining part varies from six to twelve
fathoms, and this irregularity causes the strong, tides,
especially when running against the wind, to make breakers, in
which small vessels should be careful of engaging themselves; and
when a ship has passed the entrance, the middle shoals are a
great obstacle to a free passage up the port. These shoals are
met with at four miles directly from the entrance, and extend
about ten miles to the E.S.E., parallel with the south shore;
they do seem, however, to be one connected mass, for I believe
there are two or three deep openings in them, though we had not
time to make an examination.</blockquote>
<p>"No runs of fresh water were seen in my excursions; but,"
Flinders says that Mr. Grimes, Surveyor-General of New South
Wales, on being sent "by Governor King, in 1803, to walk round
and survey the harbour", "found several, and in particular a
small river falling into the northern head of the port."</p>
<p>The Yarra is here evidently referred to, for it is marked on
Flinders's chart of the bay, which he states he was able to
complete from that of Grimes, otherwise there would have been a
possibility of the Werribee being indicated above. It is clear
that only from want of knowledge of what was contained in the
"Voyage to Terra Australis", could the first discovery of the
Yarra have ever been attributed to the expedition either of
Batman or of Fawkner.</p>
<p>Of the territory Flinders thus speaks:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The country surrounding Port Phillip has a pleasing
and in many parts a fertile appearance; and the sides of some of
the hills and several of the valleys are fit for agricultural
purposes. It is in great measure a grassy country, and capable of
supporting much cattle, though better calculated for sheep. To
this general description there are probably several exceptions;
and the southern peninsula, which is terminated by Point Nepean,
forms one, the surface there being mostly sandy, and the
vegetation in many places little better than brushwood. Indented
Head, at the northern part of the western peninsula, had an
appearance particularly agreeable; the grass had been burned not
long before, and had sprung up green and tender; the wood was so
thinly scattered that one might see to a considerable distance;
and the hills rose one over the other to a moderate elevation,
but so gently that a plough might everywhere be used. The
vegetable soil is a little mixed with sand, but good, though
probably not deep, as I judged by the small size of the
trees.<br>
<br>
"The most common kinds of wood are the <i>casuarina</i> and
<i>eucalyptus</i>, to which Mr. Grimes adds the <i>banksia</i>,
<i>mimosa</i>, and some others; but the timber is rarely sound,
and is not large.<br>
<br>
"Were a settlement to be made at Port Phillip, as doubtless there
will be some time hereafter, the entrance could be easily
defended; and it would not be difficult to establish a friendly
intercourse with the natives, for they are acquainted with the
effect of fire-arms, and desirous of possessing many of our
conveniences. I thought them more muscular than the men of King
George's Sound, but, generally speaking, they differ in no
essential particular from the other inhabitants of the south and
east coasts, except in language, which is dissimilar, if not
altogether different, to that of Port Jackson, and seemingly of
King George's Sound also. I am not certain whether they have
canoes, but none were seen.<br>
<br>
"In the woods are the kangaroo, the emu or cassoway, paraquets,
and a variety of small birds; the mud-banks are frequented by
ducks and some black swans, and the shores by the usual sea-fowl
common in New South Wales. The range of the thermometer was
between 61&deg; and 67&deg;; and the climate appeared to be as
good and as agreeable as could be desired in the month answering
to November."</blockquote>
<p>The unsuccessful attempt of Collins to form a settlement is
next spoken of. Then it is stated&mdash;"Point Nepean is in
<i>latitude</i> 38&deg; 18' south. The longitude from twelve sets
of distances taken by Lieutenant Flinders"&mdash;one of his
officers and doubtless a relative&mdash;" in the port and six
others by me ten days before arriving . . . . is 144&deg;
30&frac12;' east; but these observations being mostly on one side
of the moon, the corrected longitude of time-keepers, 144&deg;
38' east, is preferred."</p>
<p>Speaking of the rise of the tide, Flinders says, "it appeared
to be high water <i>two hours and a half</i> after the moon's
passage; but at Point Nepean, the time of high water by the shore
is said by Mr. Grimes to be only <i>one hour</i> after the
moon.</p>
<blockquote>"On the 3rd of May, at daylight, the anchor was
weighed to go out of Port Phillip with the last half of the ebb;
and the wind being from the westward, we backed, filled and
tacked occasionally, dropping out with the tide. "When the
entrance was cleared, and five miles distant, Mr. Westall took a
view of it . . . . and at eleven o'clock, when we bore away
eastward to pass Cape Schanck, he sketched that cape and the
ridge of hills terminating at Arthur's Seat.<br>
<br>
"At one o'clock" on Sunday, May 9th, the heads of Port Jackson
were gained; "a pilot came on board, and soon after three the
<i>Investigator</i> was anchored in Sydney Cove.<br>
<br>
"There was not a single individual on board who was not upon deck
working the ship into the harbour; and it may be averred that the
officers and crew were, generally speaking, in better health than
on the day we sailed from Spithead, and not in less good
spirits."</blockquote>
<p>Flinders found the French ship <i>Le Naturaliste</i>, in Port
Jackson. On the 20th, Baudin arrived in <i>Le
G&eacute;ographie</i>, which a boat of the <i>Investigator</i>
assisted in towing up the harbour. The officers and crew were
suffering much from scurvy, so much so that many of them were
taken into the Colonial hospital; and, although the necessity of
increasing the number of cattle in the country had caused the use
of fresh meat to be forbidden, "some oxen belonging to the
Government were now killed for the distressed strangers."</p>
<p>In Governor King's despatch of May 21st, 1802, in the Record
Office, it is stated that, having sailed round Van Diemen's Land,
the two French exploring vessels separated, when the
<i>Naturaliste</i> "proceeded to Western Port, where they lay
some time without seeing the excellent watering-place
Acting-Lieutenant Murray found on Phillip Isle, during the
<i>Lady Nelson's</i> last voyage, which appears to have been a
principal reason for their visit to this place. It does not
appear they have any knowledge of Port Phillip or King's Island,
not having been to the westward of Western Port. The remainder of
the <i>Naturaliste</i>'s voyage is a secret.</p>
<p>"Previous to the <i>Naturaliste</i>'s sailing from hence, I
was highly gratified by the arrival of his Majesty's ship
<i>Investigator</i> on the 9th, and was still more pleased to
find that Captain Flinders had surveyed the S.W. coast to within
six degrees of Bass's Straits before he met the
<i>G&eacute;ographie</i>, which it appears had passed through the
Straits after parting company with the <i>Naturaliste</i>."</p>
<p>In a paper entitled "Memorandums of New South Wales," in the
Correspondence of 1809, the Governor refers to the object of
Baudin's visit, stating that "a naval force is absolutely
necessary," among other reasons, "to protect the Colony from an
attack by the French from the Mauritius, which would have taken
place long ago if the enemy had possessed a naval force equal to
the enterprise. There was no doubt but what it was their
intention when M. Baudin took correct plans of Port Jackson,
&amp;c., purchased a vessel there for the purpose of exploring
the passage to the Mauritius through Bass's Straits, where he
actually passed to the westward with his division, and arrived at
the Isle de France. And had he lived another year, I think it
very possible the commodore would most likely have visited the
Colony for the purpose of annihilating the settlement."</p>
<p>The detention and treatment of Flinders, on his calling at the
Mauritius, were in striking contrast to the hospitality extended
to Baudin at Sydney. Our explorer was detained eight years a
prisoner of war, his charts and papers were taken from him, and
his discoveries attributed to French explorers. The only
justification that could be urged for the detention is the
technical one, that his passport only held good whilst he was
with the particular vessel in which he set out, its terms being,
"de laisser passer librement et sans emp&ecirc;chement, ladite
corvette <i>Investigator</i>, ses officers, &eacute;quipage, et
effets, pendant la dur&eacute;e de leur voyage."</p>
<p>In the New South Wales Correspondence *** for 1805 is a copy
of a letter from Captain Flinders to Governor King, begun on
board the <i>Cumberland</i> at Coupang Bay, Timor, November 12th,
1808, describing his voyage up to that time, and concluded at the
Mauritius, August 8th, 1804. He reports his detention in the
island by the French. This is followed by one, in spirited
strains, from King to the Governor of the place, dated Sydney,
April 30th, 1805, in which it is urged that the detention of our
distinguished explorer was quite unjustifiable, and in striking
contrast to the hospitable reception of Baudin at Sydney. King
also requests the release of Flinders, and the delivery up to him
of his charts and papers.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Record Office.]</p>
<p>It is interesting to know a little of the personal history of
eminent men; and for the following facts respecting Captain
Flinders and his ship, the author is indebted to Mr. Flinders
Petrie. The distinguished navigator was born in 1774, and died
July 19th, 1814.</p>
<p>In one of his letters to the author, Mr. Petrie says,&mdash;"I
wrote to the Admiralty to ask what, became of the Investigator.
It seems that after her patching up at Port Jackson she was
brought back to Plymouth, November 24th, 1805, and placed in
ordinary at that port. In November, 1810, she was sold, probably
by auction, to be broken up, considering her rotten state six
years before. The later <i>Investigator</i>s, therefore, are not
the same ship."</p>
<p>It is also an interesting fact that one of the midshipmen of
the <i>Investigator</i>, when she visited Port Phillip,
afterwards became the famous Sir John Franklin.</p>
<p>Mr. William Henty has related to the author that, when on
their voyage to Tasmania in 1886, as fellow-passengers, Sir John,
who was proceeding to enter upon the Government of that Colony,
mentioned, in conversation with him, as their vessel, the
<i>Fairlie</i>, was passing out of the Australian Bight, that in
the particular place where they were, the <i>Investigator</i> had
incurred such danger of being embayed, that her topsails had to
be double-reefed twice in the short space of twenty minutes.</p>

<p>S<small>UCH</small> discoveries as those of Grant, Murray, and
Flinders did not fail to stimulate the national energies of
England to fresh enterprises of colonization, at a time when the
vitality of the nation was at the highest pitch of vigour.
Nothing has lent greater countenance to unworthy apprehensions,
that that vitality is on the wane, than the idea which has for
some years too extensively prevailed in this country,&mdash;and
which, until the Colonial Office was presided over by Lord
Carnarvon, had become too much the policy of the Imperial
Government,&mdash;that the Empire is large enough and ought not
to be further extended. What a contrast between the unworthy fear
of incurring additional Imperial responsibilities,&mdash;whereby
the Orange Free State and the Transvaal were allowed to become
independent in South Africa, Fiji was too long refused admittance
to the Empire, and New Guinea is even still left to create future
embarrassments,&mdash;and the manly national energy which
effected the colonization of Australia at times and under
circumstances of so much difficulty and danger! England in those
days did not require the outlet for an overcrowded population
such as she has since acquired; distances were practically three
or four times greater than at present; and, instead of having
enjoyed years of peace, Great Britain had not half passed through
her great struggle with Napoleon. Still, with an undaunted
courage which merited success and certainly achieved it, as
splendidly in peace as in war, she persevered in making in
Australia a grand extension of her Empire. The brilliant
victories of Napoleon gave France an ephemeral European power,
which disappeared whilst England was peacefully sowing in the New
World the seeds of Empire, only the firstfruits of which she is
beginning to reap.</p>
<p>In despatches * to the Duke of Portland, of the same date as
that which we have seen accompanied the log of the <i>Lady
Nelson</i>, May 21st, 1802, Governor King urged the importance of
a settlement being formed at Port Phillip, both on the ground of
the advantages of the situation and as a precaution against the
designs of the French, of which he was apprehensive.</p>
<p class="foot">[* New South Wales Correspondence, Record
Office.]</p>
<p>He writes,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"From the account given by Acting-Lieutenant Murray
and Captain Flinders, of the goodness of the soil and natural
advantages of Port Phillip in Bass's Straits, I beg leave to
suggest the propriety of a settlement being made at that place,
as much for the purpose of separating the numbers that will be
sent here, when peace is made, as to make an establishment in a
place so connected with the settlement. Nor can there be a doubt,
from the accounts I have received from those officers, of its
being a much more eligible climate for raising wheat than this
is. This measure I should immediately adopt, but unfortunately I
have no person under me that can be spared or entrusted with such
a command; but, when more officers come out, perhaps I may be
able to select out one that would answer for that situation,
which will require a person of some abilities and perseverance.
Unless I find it absolutely necessary I shall not take this step
without your Grace's approbation. . . . . I am the more
solicitous respecting forming this settlement from the
probability of the French having in contemplation to make a
settlement on the north-west coast, which I cannot help thinking
is a principal object of their researches."</blockquote>
<p>In December, 1802, Governor King sent Surveyor-General Grimes
and Lieut. Chas Robbins to thoroughly examine Port Phillip, and
they walked round the harbour, discovering the Yarra Yarra. The
result appears to have been a decided condemnation of the
territory as unfit for settlement. In the papers about Collins's
expedition, Record Office, is a copy of Grimes's plan of the bay,
similar to "Flinders's chart, with soundings all round the shores
and brief remarks about the country. The Yarra is traced past
Melbourne. The author has sought in vain for the report, even
writing out to Sydney for it. It has, however, quite recently
come to light. The following interesting particulars respecting
it are to be found in the "Argus" of September 12th,
1877:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The ancient rivalries of Batman and Fawkner as to
the discovery of the River Yarra and the country adjacent&mdash;a
dispute which at one time divided into two hitter factions the
inhabitants of the little village then called the Doutigalla
Settlement, and now known as the City of Melbourne&mdash;have
been decisively set at rest by the finding in the Colonial
Records in Sydney of a very curious and valuable manuscript
journal of an exploration sent forth in 1802 by Governor King
under the charge of Mr. Charles Grimes, the then Surveyor-General
of New South Wales. In gathering local materials for a memoir of
Captain Flinders, the illustrious Australian navigator, upon
which he has been engaged for some years, Mr. J.J. Shillinglaw,
of this city, recently disinterred from an obscurity of
three-quarters of a century the survey made by Grimes of what was
denominated Port King, until that name was altered by the
Governor to Port Phillip, after his predecessor, the first
Governor of New South Wales. This proved to be an elaborate and
accurate chart, showing soundings all round Port Phillip and
Hobson's and Corio bays, and the course of the Saltwater and
Yarra rivers&mdash;the former nearly as far as Keilor, and the
latter up to Dight's Falls in Studley Park. Following up the
traces thus obtained, Mr. Shillinglaw has been successful in
hunting up the manuscript journal of the exploration alluded to,
which contains much interesting detail of the nature of the
country passed over, the runs of water met with, and the
incidents of the voyage of the <i>Cumberland</i>, in which the
party was embarked. The discovery and ascent of the River Yarra
was made on Sunday, 30th January, 1803, and the description of
the surrounding lands makes it still more difficult to understand
why Port Phillip was abandoned by Collins, after a stay, of
nearly four months, as 'an unpromising and unproductive country'
exactly a twelvemonth afterwards to a day. The little
<i>Cumberland</i>, in which Grimes made his survey, lives in
history as the vessel in which poor Flinders was made prisoner in
the Isle of France when on his way home. The chart and journal,
which have been fruitlessly sought by all those writers who have
dealt with the early days of the Colonies, clear up many
misconceptions, errors, and pretensions, and will, no doubt, be
published by the gentleman who has had the good fortune to find
them. Nor should we omit to mention that, without the warm
interest shown in a matter of literary interest by Sir John
Robertson, the Premier of New South Wales, and Mr. Henry
Halloran, the Under-Secretary, these interesting documents might
possibly never have seen light."</blockquote>
<p>The following correspondence leaves little doubt that a copy
of the report was forwarded to this country. Prior to the
discovery of this document in Sydney, the only original
statement, by one of Grimes's party, which appeared to be extant,
is that contained in the report of Lieut. Robbins, enclosed in a
despatch of Governor King to Lord Hobart, dated January 16th,
1805. Robbins had been sent in the <i>Integrity</i>, at the end
of 1804, to make further investigations in Bass's Straits, with a
view to the formation of a settlement in the place of that which,
we are about to see, had a brief existence. He says in his
lengthy report about Western Port,&mdash;"In comparing it with
Port Phillip, which I was at the examination of in 1803, in
conjunction with Mr. Grimes, I have not seen any part of the
Western Port in my opinion so eligible for a settlement as the
fresh-water river at the head of that port."</p>
<p>So prompt was the Imperial Government in acting upon Governor
King's advice, that an expedition was organized and despatched
from this country to colonize Port Phillip, before the
unfavourable report of Grimes reached England.</p>
<p>The vessels of the expedition were H.M.S. <i>Calcutta</i>,
commanded by Captain Daniel Woodriff, and the chartered transport
<i>Ocean</i>. The Lieut.-Governor was Col. David Collins, who
went out as Judge-Advocate with Governor Phillip, in the
expedition which founded the first settlement at Port Jackson,
and who wrote the work about N. S. Wales, to which reference has
already been made. He was for many years first Governor of Van
Diemen's Land, where he died.</p>
<p>The expedition finally left the shores of England, April 27th,
1803; and, after calling at Rio and the Cape, the <i>Calcutta</i>
entered Port Phillip Heads, October 10th, where she found that
the <i>Ocean</i> had already arrived. Governor Collins had sent a
letter by a whaler from Rio, to Governor King at Sydney, asking
that a vessel might be sent to meet him at Port Phillip or in the
Straits; and no communication having been received nearly a month
after the arrival of the expedition, Mr. Collins, one of the
settlers, volunteered to proceed to Port Jackson to inform
Governor King of the formation of the settlement. Mr. Collins was
accordingly provided with a cutter, in which he conveyed some of
the despatches, which we shall presently notice. In seven days he
safely arrived within sixty miles of Sydney, when he was
overtaken and picked up by the <i>Ocean</i>.</p>
<p>The historical documents in this chapter are among the New
South Wales Correspondence in the Record Office. Vol. I., for
1804, contains numerous papers relating to the formation and
abandonment of the settlement at Port Phillip, and the volume for
1802-3 and 4 is almost entirely devoted to the subject and to the
settlements formed by Lieut. John Bowen in Van Diemen's Land, at
the Derwent and at Port Dalrymple; that at the former on
September 12th, 1803. Here again the <i>Lady Nelson</i> took an
important part in Australian colonization, for she arrived at the
Derwent five days before Bowen. This was not the man who first
entered Port Phillip.</p>
<p>From the following document it will be seen that considerable
freedom of selection was left to Col. Collins:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Copy of an Instruction to Lieutenant-Governor
Collins, communicated to his Excellency Governor King by the
Right Honourable Lord Hobart, one of his Majesty's principal
Secretaries of State, dated 7th February, 1803.<br>
<br>
"Although Port Phillip has been pointed out as the place judged
the most convenient and proper for fixing the first settlement of
your establishment in Bass's Straits, nevertheless you are not
positively restricted from giving the preference to any other
part of the said southern coast of New South Wales, or any of the
islands in Bass's Straits which, upon communication with the
Governor of New South Wales, and with his concurrence and
approbation, you may have well-grounded reasons to consider as
more advantageously situated for that purpose."</blockquote>
<p>It is evident that Collins made up his mind, almost
immediately upon his arrival at Port Phillip, if not before, that
the settlement was to prove a failure.</p>
<p>The following letter from him to Governor King, dated "Head
Quarters, Camp at Sullivan's Bay, Port Phillip, 5th November,
1803," describes the voyage out and arrival of the
expedition:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;I beg leave to acquaint
your Excellency that, having sailed from Spithead in his
Majesty's ship <i>Calcutta</i>, on the 24th April last, charged
with the establishing a settlement in this harbour, pursuant to a
recommendation from you to that effect, I arrived here on the 9th
ultimo, having, on my way hither, touched at Teneriff, Rio de
Janeiro, and Simon's Bay, at which latter place I purchased a
small quantity of stock and seed grain for the intended colony.
The <i>Calcutta</i> is commanded by Captain Daniel Woodriff, who,
having been once before in New South Wales, was selected by
Government as a fit person to be employed in the present
expedition; and I feel much pleasure in having it in my power, in
this early stage of my communication with your Excellency, to
bear my testimony to the propriety of their selection.<br>
<br>
"We were accompanied by the <i>Ocean</i>, a store-ship richly
freighted&mdash;such has been the liberality of
Government&mdash;with an ample supply of every article that could
be suggested as likely to be of advantage to an undertaking, of
the success of which Government had entertained the most sanguine
hopes. From this ship being a dull sailer, we parted company in
some very bad weather a short time before we made the island of
Tristan da Cunha, but had the satisfaction of finding that she
had anchored here on the 7th of October&mdash;only two days
before us&mdash;by which she had escaped a heavy gale of wind
which we met with on the 8th when off King's Island.<br>
<br>
"I have brought in with me 299 male convicts, sixteen married
women, a few settlers, and a small detachment, as per margin,**
from the Royal Marines, under my command; with a complete civil
staff, of which the Judge-Advocate alone is absent, but I have my
Lord Hobart's assurance he shall be sent out by the first ship
that sails after me."</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[** "Three subalterns, three sergeants, three
corporals, two drummers, thirty-nine privates."]</p>
<p>The following extract from this despatch is embodied in one
from Collins to Lord Hobart, of November 14th:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"From Mr. Mertho, who had been examining some part of
the bay, I received the first unfavourable impression of it,
which, I am truly concerned to observe, a more minute survey
thereof has only tended to strengthen.<br>
<br>
"Anxious to discover a place possessing the advantages of fresh
water, timber for building, and soil for agricultural purposes,
whereon I could land my people, I determined to lose no time in
examining the bay. Captain Woodriff and myself accordingly set
off on the morning after our arrival, and landed at the
watering-place under the high land on the eastern side of the
bay. Here we found fresh water, and enough for my purposes, but a
soil of sand only; the access to both of which was barred by
water so shallow that no loaded boat could approach within half a
mile, and with the wind at west not at all. Upon ascending the
hill we found sand on its summit, and its sides thinly clad with
miserable stunted timber.<br>
<br>
"The two following days were spent in an equally unsuccessful
examination of the western or lagoon side of the bay. Here we
found the soil somewhat better, but entirely destitute of that
great essential&mdash;fresh water.<br>
<br>
"Having received the most positive orders to discharge the
store-ship without any delay, I felt myself no longer at liberty
to continue my personal researches after a proper place, and on
Thursday, 13th (the fourth day from my arrival), I went on shore
with Captain Woodriff to a bay on the east side, where very good
fresh water had been obtained by sinking casks near the margin of
the sea shore. In the bay adjoining this I found a level of about
five acres, upon which I instantly determined to land my people,
stores, and provisions; and from which I have now the honour of
reporting my proceedings to your Excellency.<br>
<br>
"That every further information respecting this capacious harbour
should forthwith he obtained, Captain Woodriff despatched his
first officer, Lieutenant Tuckey, accompanied by Mr. Harris, the
Deputy-Surveyor of the settlement, and a Mr. Collins, a settler
(formerly a master in the navy), in the <i>Calcutta</i>'s launch,
attended by a boat belonging to me, on a survey of the harbour.
Upon this business they were absent nine days, and I have now the
honour to enclose a copy of the report made to me for your
Excellency's information, by which I think it will appear that,
having before me but a choice of difficulties, I could not be
anywhere better placed than I am, and where I shall wait until
honoured with your Excellency's commands for my future
proceedings.<br>
<br>
"The soil from Arthur's Seat to Point Calcutta, at the entrance
of the harbour, is light, and mixed considerably with sand; even
the few patches of black vegetable mould which here and there
have been met with abound therewith. I have nevertheless opened
two acres of ground for a garden, and am preparing five acres for
Indian corn. Of the success of the latter I do not entertain much
hope; but I find in it some employment for my people. These, I am
happy to say, conduct themselves most perfectly to my
satisfaction, wading the whole day long up to their middles in
water, with the utmost cheerfulness, to discharge the boats as
they come in.<br>
<br>
"The bread, flour, and salt provisions for their support, I have
stowed in large piles in the open air, while the bale-goods,
wine, spirits, and other articles of the most value, are
deposited under the large elaboratory tents, which I have guarded
as well as my small military force will allow. From the
scantiness of this I have been constrained to request Captain
Woodriff to land one non-commissioned officer and ten privates,
from the detachment of Royal Marines belonging to his Majesty's
ship under his command, to be lent for the duties of this
garrison during her stay here; but as the same necessity for this
assistance will exist after her departure, I must submit to your
Excellency whether it would not be expedient to increase my
forces by a small party from the troops under your command at
Port Jackson. As this must in a great measure depend upon what
may be your determination respecting my future proceedings, I
shall add nothing further on the subject, but that, were I to
settle in the upper part of the harbour, which is full of
natives, I should require four times the force I have now to
guard not only the convicts, but perhaps myself, from their
attacks.<br>
<br>
"I cannot but suppose that all the disadvantages of Port Phillip
are as well known to your Excellency as they are to myself at
this moment. If they are, you will have anticipated this Report;
but it may not have entered into your contemplation that there
are at this time between 300 and 400 people sitting down
cheerfully, with no other or more certain supply of water than
what is filtered daily through the perforated sides of six or
eight casks, which are sunk in the sand. The water certainly is
good&mdash;at least my sick-list does not indicate that it is
otherwise. How long the supply may last, or how far it is
calculated to meet a continuation of the dry weather which we
have hitherto experienced, time alone can determine; at present
the casks' regularly fill as they are emptied. I shall sink a
well as soon as the hurry of clearing the store-ship is over.
That labour has gone on rapidly, and she was discharged from
Government employ on the 4th instant. The <i>Calcutta</i>'s boats
have given considerable assistance in expediting this business,
from the nature of which, I fear, they must have suffered
considerably; but Captain Woodriff has most obligingly furnished
me with all the aid in his power."</blockquote>
<p>At this point in the letter to Governor King, as well as in
that to Lord Hobart, comes in the following condemnatory
extracts. After a few lines about the convicts, Collins tells the
Governor,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I shall, however, endeavour to get from them all the
labour I possibly can, there being much to be done to get my
stores and them under a more durable covering, than the canvas we
are at present under before the winter season sets in, if it
should appear expedient to your Excellency that I am to remain
here until that period. I am well aware that a removal hence must
be attended with much difficulty and loss; but, upon every
possible view of my situation, I do not see any advantage that
could be thereby attained, nor that by staying here I can at all
answer the intentions of Government in sending hither a colonial
establishment. The bay itself, when viewed in a commercial light,
is wholly unfit for any such purpose, being situated in a deep
and dangerous bight, between Cape Albany Otway and Point Schank,
to enter which must ever require a well-manned and well-found
ship, a leading wind, and a certain time of tide, for the ebb
runs out at the rapid rate of from five to seven knots an hour,
as was experienced by the store-ship. The <i>Calcutta</i> had
fortunately a Mr wind, and the tide of flood when she came in,
and she experienced a very great indraught, which had brought her
daring the night much nearer than she expected. With a gale of
wind upon the coast, and well in between the two above-mentioned
points, a ship would be in imminent risk and
danger."</blockquote>
<p>In the letter of the 14th to Lord Hobart, Collins thus
continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I regret that I have not a better report to make to
your lordship of the probable success of an expedition equipped
under your lordship's auspices, with a liberality that inspired
every one concerned in the undertaking with the most sanguine
hopes of success. You may rest assured that what is possible
shall be done by me to ensure it, if it should be Governor King's
opinion that I am to remain here. I have suggested to that
gentleman, in a private letter which I wrote him, that Port
Dalrymple, on the northern side of Van Diemen's Land, appears to
possess those requisites for a settlement in which this very
extensive harbour is so wholly deficient. Every day's experience
convinces me that it cannot nor ever will be resorted to by
speculative men. The boat that I sent to Port Jackson, was three
days lying at the mouth of the harbour before she could get out,
owing to a swell occasioned by the wind meeting the strong tide
of ebb. A ship would undoubtedly find less difficulty, but she
must go out at the top of the tide and with a leading wind, which
is not to be met with every day. When all the disadvantages
attending this bay are publicly known, it cannot be supposed that
commercial people will be very desirous of visiting Port
Phillip."</blockquote>
<p>As bad a shot as ever prophet made!</p>
<blockquote>"There is a run of fresh water in the N.E. part of
the harbour, where Captain Woodriff is proceeding with the
<i>Calcutta</i> to recruit his water. Here I understand the soil
is miserably poor and sandy, and the approach to it very shallow,
but I shall have the honour of transmitting the survey made by
Mr. Harris, the Deputy-Surveyor, by the
<i>Calcutta</i>."</blockquote>
<p>The following is the document&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">"Copy of Report of Survey made by
Mr. Harris, Deputy-Surveyor of Port Phillip.</p>
<blockquote>"The land in general round Port Phillip, at a short
distance from the shores, carries a deceitful appearance of a
rich country. The soil is, however, for the most part sandy, and
very thinly wooded. Some light black mould is found in the
heights and in the valleys; but neither in quality or quantity
sufficient for cultivation to repay the cares of the husbandman.
The best soil is found in the Western Bay, chiefly consisting of
marle, covered with a light black mould. Good water is found in
many parts on the eastern coast of the harbour, but the western
appears a dried-up country, seeming not to possess sufficient
moisture for the smallest cultivation. The northern shore is more
numerously inhabited than any other parts, from which it is
likely that water is to be found there, although no appearance of
it was seen daring the survey. Good clay and stone is found in
abundance on the eastern shore, fit for all the purposes of
building.</blockquote>

"Dy. Surveyor."   </p>
<p>The letter to Lord Hobart proceeds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"That ship"&mdash;the <i>Calcutta</i>&mdash;"has
nothing in her now belonging to the Government but the ammunition
intended for the settlement, for the reception of which I am
constructing a magazine, bomb-proof, to be formed of stone, and
Captain Woodriff would soon be at liberty to proceed according to
his orders to Port Jackson; but, having officially applied to him
to remain here until I can hear from Governor King, he has
acceded to my wish, and I hope your lordship will not disapprove
either of my request or his consent thereto. I shall send copies
of the letters which passed on that occasion by the
<i>Calcutta</i>.<br>
<br>
"I have been much disappointed in my hopes of saving the salt
provisions by the issuing of fish and kangaroo occasionally, but
of the latter not one has as yet been killed, and of the former
but very few taken. I shall, however, construct a boat as
speedily as possible to be employed on that service, and all the
aid that I can derive therefrom I will avail myself of.<br>
<br>
"I am sorry to state that many of the articles of ironmongery are
totally unfit for use, owing to the badness of the materials of
which they have been made. Specimens of these I shall send to the
Transport Board by Captain Woodriff.<br>
<br>
"I am getting on with a store-house, but I find great difficulty,
not only in procuring a quantity of proper timber sufficient for
the purpose, but in bringing in what I do find, owing to the
great labour of dragging a heavy timber carriage through a sandy
and hilly country. The preservation of my stores is, however, my
greatest care, and I shall not omit any exertion that may tend to
place them in proper security.<br>
<br>
"I am at a loss to know how to dispose of the settlers, this
place not holding out any prospect fox their succeeding in
agricultural pursuits. Sixteen having signified their wish of
remaining here, I have placed them in a valley close to my
encampment, where I have allowed them to construct temporary
huts, and allowed them small portions of garden ground. I imagine
the excellence of our provisions, than which none can be finer,
has induced most of them to remain here; but if I am not to
remove, I shall look out for situations whereon to place them,
and ease Government of the expense which they incur, as speedily
as the circumstances in which I shall find myself will admit of.
I am sorry to observe that in general they are a necessitous and
worthless set of people.<br>
<br>
"The ration which I at present issue is to each male convict for
seven days, 7 lbs. of beef, or 4 lbs. of pork, 7 lbs. of biscuit,
1 lb. of flour, 6 oz. of sugar. The one pound of flour formed no
part of the ration which I received from the Treasury, but it was
given to the first convicts who landed at Port Jackson, in
addition to 7 lbs. of biscuit, and I thought it would enable my
people to make a pudding on Sunday, which is the use to which
they put it, and find thereby a grateful addition to their salt
meat on one day in the week. When the biscuit is expended, which
it soon will be, I shall then issue seven pounds of flour.<br>
<br>
"I have issued, since my arrival, a complete suit of clothing to
each male convict&mdash;a comfort that the majority of them stood
much in want of, for the wretched apparel with which they
embarked was completely worn out long before we had reached the
most trying part of the voyage. During the progress of that, I
had made up and issued to them about sixty suits from the
materials which were put on board, to be made up on the passage,
and these were distributed to the men who were falling ill for
want of clothes, and to some who, being allowed to assist in
working the ship, were at all times exposed to the vicissitudes
of weather and climate.<br>
<br>
"The small quantity of stock with which I landed is doing very
well, and I hope will soon increase; but three heifers that I
purchased at the Cape, though each was two years old, could not
bear the cold and wet weather which we met with, and died soon
after we sailed. A small cow, which I bought at Rio de Janeiro,
will calve in a few days, and I have two fine bulls alive.<br>
<br>
"The people, for the three weeks which succeeded of debarkation,
continued healthy and well-behaved, but since that time we have
never had less than thirty under medical treatment, and a
desertion rather alarming has taken place among them, no less
than twelve having left the settlement within the last week.<br>
<br>
"I had received information that these men were to be followed by
five others, who I caused to be seized a short time before the
hour at which they proposed quitting the settlement. I have them
now chained to each other, with an assurance from me that they
shall remain in that state upon two-thirds allowance of
provisions, until they will either give me such information as
may lead to the apprehension of the others, or that those others
return, which I am not without hopes they may be induced to do,
when they find themselves disappointed in their expectations of
meeting a South Sea man, and their provisions fail them.<br>
<br>
"I have employed some people who I think I can depend on to go
after these infatuated wretches, and trust that they will
succeed, that an example sufficient to deter others may be made
of them.<br>
<br>
"The cause of this desertion I can no otherwise account for than
by the operation of the restless disposition of man, which is
ever prone to change, for the convicts are well fed and clothed,
and not overwrought. Complaint, I am well convinced, they cannot
have, for the hardest labour which we have had has been
discharging the store-ships, in doing which the gangs that were
employed were rewarded each Saturday night with a proportion of
spirits and water, which I thought they merited.<br>
<br>
"The <i>Ocean</i> being on the point of sailing for China, I have
judged it expedient to give your lordship these few particulars
of my situation; but by the <i>Calcutta</i>, which may be the
first in England, I shall have the honour of stating every
circumstance that has occurred more fully than I do at present;
and have the honour to remain, with much respect, my lord,<br>
<br>
       "Your lordship's most obedient and very humble
servant,</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="right"><small>"DAVID
COLLINS."</small>   </p>
<p>In his letter to Governor King of November 5th, Collins, after
requesting that two men who would be of service may be sent him,
and also a few thousand bricks, thus continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"As there are many free people at present at Sydney,
there may perhaps be some who may be desirous of visiting Port
Phillip; but as such could only prove extremely troublesome to me
at present, will you forgive my requesting that none may be
suffered at any time to come hither but such as I may have
occasion to point out?"</blockquote>
<p>Referring to the letter he had sent from Rio, by the whaler on
July 5th, Collins proceeds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Nothing having come in since my arrival, now nearly
a month, I conclude that Mr. Quested has been delayed upon his
voyage, and have therefore, being extremely desirous that you
should as speedily as possible be informed thereof, determined to
prepare a very fine six-oared cutter belonging to the settlement,
and send her forthwith to Port Jackson.<br>
<br>
"This letter will (I hope) be delivered to your Excellency by a
Mr. Collins, who came to this country on a fishing speculation.
He accompanied Captain Woodriff and myself on the examination of
the harbour, and was afterwards the associate with Lieut. Tuckey
in the more accurate survey which was made by that officer of the
whole of the extensive bay. His zeal for the good of his
Majesty's service is equal with his abilities to promote it; and
having offered his services to convey this information to your
Excellency, I am happy in the opportunity of introducing him to
your Excellency's notice, convinced that the service which he
will have rendered, as well as his own merit, will give him some
claim thereto.<br>
<br>
"I have had the boat prepared under his direction, and he seems
confident of her successfully making this short voyage. I cannot
but own that I shall feel no small degree of anxiety until I can
be informed of the event of it, which I trust your Excellency
will gratify me with as speedily as it may be in your power. The
despatches and private letters which I am honoured with the
charge of for your Excellency I do not send by this conveyance,
which I trust you will deem with me rather too precarious, but
they shall be forwarded with many others for various persons
under your Government, by the first safe conveyance which may
offer.<br>
<br>
"In the preparations which have been necessarily made on this
occasion, we have been materially assisted by Captain Woodriff,
who has most readily furnished me with such articles as the
public stores could not supply, and could be spared from the
ship."</blockquote>
<p>The letter concludes by stating that Mr. Collins had been
provisioned for a month, and had been instructed to act under
Governor King's directions with respect to his return; and also
that Captain Woodriff had been requested to remain till a reply
from Sydney should be received. After being seven days out, Mr.
Collins, as we have seen, was picked up by the store-ship
<i>Ocean</i>, which overtook him on her way from Port Phillip to
Sydney&mdash;Tuckey states within sixty miles of the latter.</p>
<p>Governor King replies to Lieutenant-Governor Collins from
Sydney, November 26th, 1803:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;I have received yours of
the 5th inst., dated from Port Phillip. Mr. Collins, who
delivered me your despatch, arrived here the 24th inst. in the
<i>Ocean</i> with his people and the cutter.<br>
<br>
"On receipt of yours I changed the destination of the <i>Lady
Nelson</i> (being the only vessel here), which was on the point
of sailing for Norfolk Island. I hope she will be ready to leave
this on the 28th inst., and that favourable winds will enable her
commander to deliver this despatch in a few days after.<br>
<br>
"The enclosures and accompanying survey will inform you that your
observations on Port Phillip have been fully anticipated, and I
have no doubt but Government is now in possession of that
information which went by the <i>Glatton</i>. That ship sailed
the 16th May last.<br>
<br>
"Not having received my despatches from the Secretary of State
(which I think you and Captain Woodriff were very right in not
subjecting to be carried to China by the <i>Ocean</i>, or risking
them in the open boat), I cannot proceed further than in laying
all the information I possess before you, and suggesting the
propriety of your consulting with Captain Woodriff on the
expediency of the measures it may appear necessary for you to
adopt, at the same time giving my opinion.<br>
<br>
"It appears, as well by Mr. Grimes's and Mr. Robins's survey as
by your report, that Port Phillip is totally unfit in every point
of view to remain at, without subjecting the Crown to the certain
expensive prospect of the soil not being equal to raise anything
for the support of the settlement. Unless you should have made
any further observations to encourage your remaining
there&mdash;perhaps the upper part of the bay at the head of the
river may not have escaped your notice, as that is the only part
Mr. Grimes and those that were with him speak the least
favourably of&mdash;from this circumstance I shall presume it
will appear to you that removing from thence will be the most
advisable for the interest of his Majesty's service.<br>
<br>
"You will perceive by the enclosure that my first view respecting
forming a settlement at Port Phillip proceeded from the report of
its first discoverer, Mr. Murray, and the subsequent account of
Captain Flinders, a copy of whose chart I also send. You will
observe that it was not my intention to fix that settlement, or
any other, until I heard from England; and you will also observe
the reasons that determined me on fixing a settlement at the
Derwent on Van Diemen's Land. . . . . I shall now state what I
consider the advantages and disadvantages of fixing your
government at the River Derwent or Port Dalrymple. . . . Having
possessed you of these circumstances, it remains with you to
determine which of the two places you consider most eligible to
remove with your establishment."</blockquote>
<p align="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>
<p>In a letter of the same date (November 26th) to Captain Daniel
Woodriff, Governor King says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I am much concerned that the survey I caused to be
taken at Port Phillip in December, 1802, which was sent to
England by the <i>Glatton</i> in May last, had not arrived in
England previous to your departure, in which case I presume, from
the information I have given Lieutenant-Governor Collins, no
debarkation would have taken place until you heard from me;
however, this is one of those events depending on circumstances
that cannot be guarded against, but amended as well as
possible.<br>
<br>
"I have given the Lieutenant-Governor every information I
possess, and have suggested to him the propriety of consulting
with you on the measures most advisable to be adopted; and, as a
removal appears indispensable, I judged that to attempt that
service with the <i>Lady Nelson</i> and <i>Francis</i> would be
tedious, and ultimately of more expense to the Crown than taking
up the <i>Ocean</i> would be; this I have done, and shall
endeavour to despatch her and the <i>Lady Nelson</i> on the 28th
instant, which is four days after her arrival.<br>
<br>
"I have communicated the Charter Party to Lieutenant-Governor
Collins; a copy should have been sent you, but that the time is
so short. You will please to observe she is taken up for four
months certain, in which time (or less) I trust the service will
be performed. As he insisted on 18<i>s</i>. a ton a month, I was
obliged to comply from the exigency of the occasion. I observe he
was taken up by the Transport Board in August, 1801, for six
months at 19<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. a ton per month.</blockquote>
<p align="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>
<blockquote>"It now remains for me to request a continuation of
your good offices and exertions in directing and assisting to
remove the colonists from Port Phillip to Port Dalrymple or
Hobart, as may be determined on, submitting the exigencies of the
case, and the benefit His Majesty's service will derive thereby,
to your consideration and determination. . . ."</blockquote>
<p>Among the very complete set of documents respecting the
settlement, in the N. S. Wales Correspondence, is a copy of the
Charter Party between Governor King and Mr. John Mertho, master
of the <i>Ocean</i>, dated November 25th, 1803. She is stated to
be of 481 tons register.</p>
<p>Col. Collins writes, from the Camp, Sullivan Bay, Port
Phillip, Dec. 16th, 1803, to Governor King, acknowledging his
letter of 26th ult., delivered by Mr. Collins, who returned in
the <i>Ocean</i> on the 13th. He expresses surprise at Captain
Woodriff's intention to sail with the <i>Calcutta</i> to Port
Jackson, but remarks that "the reasons which have operated with
him to form this determination are of a nature to preclude any
other than expressions of regret thereat." Captain Woodriff's
instructions from the Admiralty were "to land the colony at Port
Phillip, and proceed to Port Jackson."</p>
<p>Collins goes on to observe,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I find myself left to remove the establishment (with
the direction of which I have been entrusted) with the assistance
of only one ship.<br>
<br>
"This circumstance, however, unpleasant as it is, does not
discourage me in making the preparations that are necessary for
as speedily removing as I should have done, had I received that
assistance from the <i>Calcutta</i> which she could have afforded
me, and I hope, though I cannot speak positively, that it will be
in my power to dismiss the store-ship within the time desired by
your Excellency; to accomplish which (as I am perfectly sensible
of the expense attending that ship being employed on this
service) you may be assured no exertions of mine shall be
wanting.<br>
<br>
"Mr. Mertho having informed me, on his arrival, that his ship
would not be ready to begin receiving stores, &amp;c., for ten
days, I shall employ that interval in constructing a temporary
wharf over the flat, which I shall carry out about 500 feet, and
at which boats may then be loaded without grounding. This and
other preparations will sufficiently employ me until the ship is
ready, after which, if our weather is favourable, no time will be
lost in filling her, and embarking the establishment.<br>
<br>
"The embarkation of the whole cannot possibly take place at once;
I shall therefore divide the military, civil, and convicts into
two detachments, one of which, with a proportion of stores and
provisions, can very well be sent away at any time. . .
."</blockquote>
<p>The letter goes on to state that Collins had not made up his
mind whether to go to the Derwent or Port Dalrymple, and that, in
accordance with his instructions, he would, as soon as he should
be at liberty to do so, send, unless his Excellency should
disapprove, an establishment to King's Island, although he had
been informed that a settlement had already been formed there.
This letter was received, on the arrival of the <i>Calcutta</i>
at Sydney, on December 26th, and in a reply, dated the 30th,
Governor King informed Collins that a settlement at King's Island
had not been formed, and that it was undesirable to establish
one, as settlers would be likely to drive away the sea elephants
for which the place was resorted to by sealers. The letter
further says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I think there is a necessity for a small
establishment being left at Port Phillip in the most eligible
situation, as well for the purpose of advising any ships that may
hereafter arrive as for other advantages that will attend that
measure. Perhaps a trusty sergeant and superintendent might be
sufficient at present until further instructions are received
from England."</blockquote>
<p>On January 27th, 1804, Lieutenant-Governor Collins writes to
Governor King, from the "Ship <i>Ocean</i>, Port Phillip",
stating that Mr. Collins had returned in the <i>Lady Nelson</i>
from Port Dalrymple, with a report "on the whole favourable to
the establishment of a settlement" there, but that the Derwent
had been decided upon "previous both to the receipt of your
despatches and Mr. Collins's report." The portion of the letter
having most bearing upon our narrative runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"During the absence of Mr. Collins, I had caused the
proportion of the stores and provisions, which I designed to take
with me, to be embarked on board the <i>Ocean</i>, so that, on
the arrival of the <i>Lady Nelson</i>, nothing remained to be
done but the embarkation of the military and civil officers of
the establishment, together with the prisoners.<br>
<br>
"This being completed, I embarked myself yesterday evening on
board of this ship, and we have now only to wait for an easterly
wind to carry us out of the harbour, to the entrance of which we
are proceeding and I hope in a short time to have the honour of
communicating my arrival and establishment at the Derwent to your
Excellency.<br>
<br>
"The <i>Lady Nelson</i> has now on board the greater part of the
settlers, and I shall dismiss her immediately after their
disembarkation in order to give Mr. Bowen, and the other
gentlemen of the establishment who are to quit the settlement, an
opportunity of proceeding to England by the <i>Calcutta</i>,
agreeable to your Excellency's wish on that head.<br>
<br>
"I enclose a return of the whole number embarked with me from the
colony, and a copy of the directions which I have left with
Lieutenant Sladden, the officer next in command to
myself."</blockquote>
<p>The following is the extract of the <i>Ocean</i>'s log
respecting Collins's departure from Port Phillip:&mdash;</p>
<p>"<i>Wednesday, January</i> 25<i>th</i>,
<small>P.M.</small>&mdash;His Honour Lieutenant-Governor Collins
embarked on board." On the 27th, "at noon, sprung up a light
breeze from the S.W.; weighed and run down to the harbour's
mouth, and anchored in ten-fathom water," where the vessel lay
till the 30th, and then proceeded to sea. The log for Wednesday,
February 15th, records the arrival at the Derwent. At half-past 4
p.m. the vessel entered "the river, and half-past 6 anchored in
Risdon Cove in four-fathom water." The log records that, on March
25th, at 1 p.m., the <i>Ocean</i> was "clear of the river"
Derwent, on her return voyage to Port Phillip, where, at
half-past ten on the morning of April 16th, the harbour was
entered, and the ship's arrival reported to Lieutenant
Sladden.</p>
<p>An entry of Friday, May 18th, records:&mdash;</p>
<p>"A.M., unmoored ship, hoisted in the boats, and showed the
booms; bent the mainsail and top-gallant sails; reported the ship
ready to proceed to sea to Lieutenant Sladden. . . . . P.M.,
employed getting off baggage, &amp;c.; Lieutenant Sladden
embarked." On May 21st, she cleared the Heads, but did not anchor
in the Derwent until June 25th, on which day "the arrival of the
ship was reported to Lieutenant-Governor Collins."</p>
<p>Thus, in little more than seven months after the arrival of
Collins's expedition, was the settlement hastily abandoned,
without any attempt being made to give the territory a fair
trial, and its colonization was retarded for thirty years.</p>
<p>That the expeditions, both of Grimes and of Collins, acquired
their experience of Port Phillip, during the driest periods of
the year, may, to some extent, account for their unfavourable
opinion of the country.</p>
<p>In a letter from Sullivan Cove, Derwent River, Van Diemen's
Land, February 28th, 1804, Collins informs Governor King that his
reasons for preferring the Derwent were that the place was
already settled, and chiefly because he had discovered among his
military a spirit of discontent at having to attend daily drill,
which would, he hoped, be checked by the presence at the Derwent
of a detachment of the New South Wales Corps, who also would
remove any apprehensions he might have from a large sick-list.
The advantages also of the Derwent for commercial purposes, and
as a port of shelter, he considered superior to Port Dalrymple.
Once more he says, "I found Port Phillip wholly unfit for the
settlement."</p>
<p>From Sullivan Cove, Derwent River, Van Diemen's Land, Collins
writes to Governor King on February 29th, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I have the honour to acquaint your Excellency of my
arrival at this place on the 15th instant, after a long and
unpleasant passage of sixteen days from Port Phillip, during
which we were vexed by calms and foul winds, accompanied by very
bad weather, that considerably retarded our progress, both
through the dangerous navigation of the straits, and after we had
passed them."</blockquote>
<p>Nothing else in this long letter bears upon our subject but
the statement, "I left seven (convicts) in the woods at Port
Phillip, who must inevitably perish if they do not find means to
return before Lieut. Sladden leaves that harbour."</p>
<p>Among the numerous despatches, letters, returns, invoices,
accounts, and documents relating to Collins's expedition,
carefully preserved in the volume of New South Wales
Correspondence *** for 1802, 3, 4, are forty-eight General
Orders, published at Port Phillip. They are all printed; and as
one, issued within a week of Collins's arrival, is, doubtless,
the very first composition ever put in type in Victoria, its
reproduction will be interesting.</p>

<p>These printed orders, which are in Collins's name, and at

<p>Among other interesting documents must be mentioned returns of
Births, Marriages, and Deaths, from which it appears that the
first white native of Victoria, born November 25th, 1803, was
named William James Hobart Thorne, son of a marine; the first
couple married on the 28th were Richard Garratt, prisoner, and
Hannah Harvey, free; and the first man who died, on October 10th,
was John Skilhorne, settler. There were no other births or

<p>T<small>HE</small> most detailed narrative of his proceedings
at Port Phillip is given by Collins in the following despatch to
Lord Hobart:*&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* This despatch and Collins's other letters
noticed in this Chapter are in the Record Office.]</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">"<i>Sullivan's Cove, Derwent
River, in Van Diemen's Land,</i>   <br>
28<i>th February</i>, 1804.          </p>
<blockquote>"<small>MY LORD</small>,&mdash;By my letter of the
14th of November last . . . . your lordship will be acquainted
with my arrival at Port Phillip, and subsequent proceedings up to
that date.<br>
<br>
"In that letter I informed your lordship that, having no other
means of communicating with Governor King than by sending thither
an open six-oared cutter, and the necessity of making that
officer acquainted with my opinion of Port Phillip, and
sentiments respecting a speedy removal thence, being too urgent
to admit of my waiting for the departure of the <i>Calcutta</i>,
I sent thither Mr. Collins (who came out in the <i>Ocean</i> as a
settler), he very handsomely offering to undertake the voyage and
deliver my letter to the Governor.<br>
<br>
"The boat having been prepared under his immediate inspection
(her crew consisting, not of seamen belonging to the King's ship,
but of seven convicts upon whom I hoped I could depend), he
sailed upon this service, in which there certainly was much risk,
on the 10th of November, and in seven days was followed by the
<i>Ocean</i>, who was pursuing her voyage to China. The master of
this ship informing me that, if the wind permitted, he should
pass near enough to Port Jackson to deliver a letter, I gave into
his charge a duplicate of my despatches to Governor King.<br>
<br>
"The people who I had sent after the deserters, mentioned in the
latter part of my letter No. 1, returned on the 16th November
with five of them, whom they reported to have met with at the
distance of sixty miles from the encampment.<br>
<br>
"Hitherto I had not caused my commission as the Lieut.-Governor
to be read, reserving the publication of His Majesty's pleasure
therein until I should be permanently established in whatever
place might be adopted for the settlement, with the government of
which I had been honoured. Determining to make a public example
of these delinquents, I thought it would add to solemnity, which
I wished should attend this act of justice, to cause the
commission to be read, and gave orders necessary for the
occasion.<br>
<br>
"According to these orders, all the civil and military, settlers,
and prisoners, were assembled on the following day at eleven
o'clock on the Public Parade, when His Majesty's commission
appointing me to be the Lieut.-Governor of a Settlement to be
formed in Bass's Straits, was publicly read by the chaplain, the
Rev. Mr. Knopwood, at the conclusion of which the detachment of
Marines fired three volleys. I then addressed the convicts in
general, and, after pointing out the comforts which they enjoyed,
and the ill use which they made of them, I called the five
prisoners forward, who I caused to be punished with 100 lashes
each by the drummers of my detachment.<br>
<br>
"The apprehension of these people was followed in a few days by
the voluntary return of three others, who had been longer absent,
and whose appearance bore testimony to the hardships they had
undergone. These I did not punish; they immediately required
medical treatment, and I thought their own tale of their
sufferings might operate more effectually to deter others from
absconding, than any corporal punishment which I might indict;
and with this view I published in the general orders the
particulars of the information I had received from them.<br>
<br>
"While upon this subject I shall (though not in the regular
detail of the transactions of the settlement) report to your
lordship the subsequent desertions that took place among these
people.<br>
<br>
"There was among the prisoners, who were received from the hulks
at Portsmouth, one George Lee, a young man of education and
abilities. He had been noticed in the <i>Calcutta</i> in
consequence of these advantages, and on his landing I did not
employ him at hard labour, but permitted him to construct a small
hut, in which he resided. I was concerned to find that he abused
the indulgence, and misapplied the leisure which I allowed him,
by endeavouring to create dissatisfaction among the prisoners,
and throwing some very illiberal reflections upon the officers in
general of the settlement.<br>
<br>
"I thought it absolutely necessary to have this man's conduct
investigated, and for this purpose requested the Rev. Mr.
Knopwood to make the proper inquiry. The result of this was so
unfavourable to Lee that I determined to disgrace him, and
ordered him to be classed to a gang; but he prevented me by
withdrawing from the settlement, taking with him another prisoner
and a musket, which he obtained by uttering a falsehood, from the
people at my garden. This man was held in such estimation by the
prisoners in general, that they concluded he must be in
possession of some resources unknown to them to enable him to
live independent of the public stores; and I was informed that a
large party intended to join him.<br>
<br>
"Several robberies having been committed in the night preceding
Christmas Day, and one of a very daring nature in the
commissary's tent, from whence a gun had been stolen, I promised
to procure from the Governor-in-Chief a conditional emancipation
for any prisoner who should bring forward and prosecute to
conviction any person or persons who had been guilty of these
outrages. I also appointed a night-watch consisting of five
persons, which was afterwards improved into an armed and
voluntary association of the civil officers of the settlement,
for the protection of the persons, property, and peace of the
colony.<br>
<br>
"The reward that I offered had the effect which I had rather
hoped than expected. A convict (since dead) came to me in a few
days with information that the commissary's and other tents had
been robbed by two convicts, one of whom had been for some time
in the woods; the other went off the night he committed the
robbery. He also told me that five others had for some time
planned an escape which was to be executed that night, and they
were to join the two men who had robbed the commissary. I could
immediately have apprehended these people, and prevented them
making the attempt, but I judged it more advisable to detect them
in the act, and for that purpose sent out some people armed in
the course of the day, with orders to post themselves at a place
which, according to my informant, they must pass, and endeavour
to secure them, but at all events to prevent their escape. I was,
moreover, not certain that the information which I had received
was correct, but the event proved that it was so.<br>
<br>
"At one o'clock in the morning the non-commissioned officers,
whom I had sent out, brought me word that two of the party under
his direction had fallen in with the deserters, one of whom, not
answering on being three times challenged, had been fired at and
wounded, his companions making their escape, and leaving him on
the beach about three miles from the camp. I immediately
despatched one of the surgeons with dressings, a cart, and every
assistance which was necessary to bring him. This was accordingly
executed, and though the wounded man was immediately pronounced
to be in extreme danger (a slug having lodged in the abdomen),
yet neither the pain which he suffered, nor the expectation of
approaching dissolution, could induce him to utter a syllable
that would lead to a discovery of his associates, or of others in
the camp who might have assisted them in their escape.<br>
<br>
"This happened on the 27th December. Upon the 13th of the
following month, one of these wretches surrendered himself at the
camp, having accompanied the others, according to his
calculation, upwards of 100 miles round the extensive harbour of
Port Phillip. He brought in with him the commissary's
fowling-piece, and stated that he had subsisted chiefly upon gum
and shellfish. His companions intended to proceed to the
mountains which are to the westward of Port Jackson; and having
no reason, from the result of some researches which I caused to
be made after them, to think that they were in my neighbourhood,
I forebore harassing the military in any further fruitless
pursuit of them.<br>
<br>
"Having requested Captain Woodriff (who had nothing on board the
<i>Calcutta</i> belonging to the settlement but the gunpowder and
ordnance stores) to delay his departure until I should have had a
reply to my letter which I had sent by Mr. Collins, he acceded to
my request, as well as to a requisition which I made of a
non-commissioned officer and ten privates being landed for the
duty of the garrison, from the detachment of Royal Marines
belonging to his ship. I have now the honour to enclose copies of
the letter which I wrote to Captain Woodriff, and his answer upon
this occasion.<br>
<br>
"While waiting for the return of the boat from Port Jackson, I
employed some people in constructing a magazine of stone,
cemented with lime, capable of containing the ammunition that was
on board the <i>Calcutta</i>, in case any circumstance should
occur that might oblige me to land it.<br>
<br>
"I have now to acquaint your lordship with the arrival of the
<i>Ocean</i> store-ship from Port Jackson, on the 12th of
December. I learned that the master of this ship had fortunately
met with Mr. Collins in the boat which I had sent to Sydney, on
the eve of a heavy gale of wind, which he escaped by being taken
into the ship, and in her finishing his voyage to Port
Jackson.<br>
<br>
"Governor King had anticipated my objections to Port Phillip,
and, coinciding with me in the propriety of a removal, pointed
out two places to my election&mdash;Port Dalrymple, or a
settlement which had been commenced under his direction in the
Derwent River, in Van Diemen's Land. To enable me to judge of
either, he pointed out the advantages and disadvantages of both.
He seemed to incline to the former of these places, if it should
be ascertained, upon an examination of that harbour, that there
was at its entrance a sufficient depth of water for large
vessels, for which purposes he sent me down one of the colonial
schooners; and in order to facilitate the removal of the
establishment, he informed me that he had hired the <i>Ocean</i>
for four months, in which service she was to co-operate with his
Majesty's ship <i>Calcutta</i>. But I had the mortification to
learn from Captain Woodriff that he intended to proceed
immediately to Port Jackson, as he did not think it advisable to
risk the King's ship in exploring a new harbour.<br>
<br>
"I cannot but own that at the first communication of this
intention I felt myself very much hurt, for I reflected that I
should have to remove in one ship the people, stores, and
provisions, which had been sent out by Government in two, and,
consequently, should have to divide the small military force
which was under my command, as it was not possible the
<i>Ocean</i> could take us all at one time. Captain Woodriff's
reasons were of such weight with him that I did not oppose them,
and immediately set about the arduous undertaking which was
before me. I have the honour to enclose the copy of a letter
which Captain Woodriff wrote me on this occasion, and of my
reply. The <i>Calcutta</i> left me on the 18th of December.<br>
<br>
"I forthwith despatched the schooner, having given her some
repairs which she much needed, to the examination of Port
Dalrymple, sending in her Mr. Collins, who, from his knowledge as
a master in the navy, was well qualified to judge of the fitness
of the port, Mr. Humphrey, the mineralogist (who volunteered his
services on the occasion), and Mr. Clark, the agricultural
superintendent, with proper instructions and directions to touch
at Kent's Group in their way through the Straits, to look for His
Majesty's armed tender, <i>Lady Nelson</i>, which had been for
some time missing.<br>
<br>
"During the absence of Mr. Collins I loaded the store-ship,
putting on board somewhat more than half the provisions and
nearly all the stores, to facilitate which I ran out a jetty 380
feet from the beach, which proved of essential service.<br>
<br>
"On the 20th of January, one of the colonial vessels arrived with
a letter from Governor King, wherein he informed me that a
schooner had come in from Port Dalrymple, in the entrance of
which the master stated to him to have found only three fathoms
of water in a very intricate and narrow channel, and that he had
been impeded in procuring fresh water by large bodies of hostile
natives. His Excellency therefore imagined that I would give up
all idea of going thither, and proceed to establish myself in the
Derwent.<br>
<br>
"But previous to the receipt of this letter I had determined to
proceed to that settlement upon the return of the gentlemen I had
sent thither. The motives which led me to this resolution being
fully detailed in a letter to the Governor, I have taken the
liberty of enclosing a copy of it to your lordship, as well as a
copy of another letter to the same officer, which contains a
minute account of my transactions from my departure from Port
Phillip to my finally establishing myself in this place, where I
have every hope that the disappointments which have hitherto
accompanied me will cease, and that the anxious wishes which
hitherto have been procrastinated of carrying your lordship's
intentions into execution, respecting the formation of a
settlement in this part of New Holland, will at length be
completely realized.<br>
<br>
"I should not presume to refer your lordship to copies of my
letters to another person, for my transactions under the
authority of your instructions, did I not hope that the
multiplicity of the business which is at present upon my hands,
and the short time I can spare from attending them to write my
letters, will plead my excuse. I am extremely solicitous this
information of the place where I have fixed the settlement should
go to Port Jackson in time to save the <i>Calcutta</i>, which I
entertain a hope may have not yet sailed for England. Should I,
therefore, have omitted giving your lordship information on any
point, which I may hereafter regret not having sent, it must be
ascribed to the same cause, and will, I trust, meet the same
indulgence from your lordship.<br>
<br>
"On the day following the arrival of the sloop with Governor
King's last letter, I had the satisfaction of seeing the <i>Lady
Nelson</i> enter Port Phillip, having on board Mr. Collins and
his companions, who, happily for them, had been directed by me to
touch, as before-mentioned, at Kent's Group to look for this
vessel. I say happily for them, for, notwithstanding the repairs
I had given the schooner (the <i>Francis</i>), she proved so very
leaky that she was wholly unfit for proceeding on the service
upon which I had sent her. Mr. Collins, therefore, very prudently
dismissed her to Port Jackson, and proceeded to the examination
of Port Dalrymple in the <i>Lady Nelson</i>.<br>
<br>
"I have the honour to remain, with every sentiment of the highest
respect, my lord,</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="right">"Your lordship's most obedient,
very humble servant,          <br>
"<small>DAVID COLLINS</small>."   </p>
<blockquote>"The Right Hon. Lord Hobart."</blockquote>
<p>In a letter dated next day, February 29th, 1804, Collins
writes to Lord Hobart:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The season of the year when I arrived there, as well
as the soil of Port Phillip not admitting any of the corn to be
sown, I was only able to try some of the garden-seeds, when I was
concerned to find that of the eighteen or twenty different sorts
which were put into the ground, not one succeeded.<br>
<br>
"As they were perfectly dry and sweet when opened, the gardener
who I employed imagined that they must have been injured by the
heat of the ship's hold, but as some other seeds which I had of
my own, that were equally liable to be affected by the same heat,
vegetated and produced as plentifully as from such a sandy soil
could have been expected, I am rather inclined to think the seed
was bad of its kind, and would not have grown anywhere
else."</blockquote>
<p>Collins, writing to Lord Hobart from the Derwent, July 31st,
1804, announces the removal of the remainder of the Port Phillip
settlement:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Should my despatches by His Majesty's ship
<i>Calcutta</i> arrive in safety in England, your lordship will
have learned the establishment of the greater part of the
settlement intended for Port Phillip at this place. I have now
the honour . . . . to acquaint your lordship that, after much
anxiety and apprehension for her safety, the <i>Ocean</i>
anchored in this cove from Port Phillip on the 25th ult., having
been thirty-two days in the passage from thence, the which was
protracted to that length by her meeting with much tempestuous
weather, common, I apprehend, to this season of the year.<br>
<br>
"I am truly concerned to state to your lordship that, in
consequence of the delay and extreme bad weather on the voyage, a
very large portion of the valuable and increasing stock which I
had left behind me at Port Phillip has been lost. The season of
the year was much against them, but, on my embarkation on board
the <i>Ocean</i> in the month of January last, I could not
foresee or expect that the month of June would have nearly
elapsed before the remainder of the establishment should have
joined me. I knew that the distance between Port Phillip and the
Derwent might very easily be run in ten or twelve days, and
therefore concluded that the removal of the whole establishment
might have been effected before the bad weather set in. In this
persuasion, and being anxious to get some seed into the ground
before the proper season should elapse, I determined on bringing
with me the major part of the prisoners and settlers, leaving the
stock to follow, which I trusted by this arrangement would (in
point of room) be better accommodated."</blockquote>
<p>The return accompanying the letter shows that the loss
consisted of eighteen sheep, seventeen hogs, ten ducks, one male
goat, and six fowls.</p>
<p>In a letter of April 1st, 1804, from Governor King at Sydney
to John Sullivan, Esq., Permanent Under-Secretary for the
Colonies, a recapitulation of facts, detailed in despatches sent
by the <i>Calcutta</i> to Lord Hobart, is given, "in case any
accident may have happened to that ship." The Governor also
states that,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"As the <i>Ocean</i>'s coming here was eventual, and
not receiving my despatches from his lordship, I could only act
from Col. Collins's account, and the report of the survey I
transmitted by the <i>Glatton</i>, which convinced me of the
necessity of removing the settlement, either to the Derwent or to
Port Dalrymple. The <i>Buffalo</i> being absent, and the time it
would take to remove the stores, &amp;c., which were landed by
the two colonial vessels (<i>Lady Nelson</i> and <i>Francis</i>),
I conceived it would be advancing that part of His Majesty's
service to take up the <i>Ocean</i> for that purpose . . . . I
was the more induced to take this step, not being certain that
Captain Woodriff would remain at Port Phillip when he heard of
the war, and that a cargo of timber was ready for the
<i>Calcutta</i>. The <i>Calcutta</i> sailed from Port Phillip on
the receipt of my answer. . . ."</blockquote>
<p>A letter of August 6th, 1804, from Collins to Lord Hobart,
contains a statement also interesting when read in the light of
present circumstances. Speaking once more of Port Phillip from a
commercial and agricultural point of view, the writer
says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"My letters sent herewith will inform your lordship
that I am now placed in a situation most highly favourable to
both these purposes.</blockquote>
<p align="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>
<blockquote>"Your lordship will be possessed of my reasons for
quitting Port Phillip, which, I hope, will be satisfactory to
your lordship, more especially when the very great and superior
local advantages of my present situation are considered. His
Excellency, Governor King, has done me the honour to coincide
with me in the propriety of my removal, and of the spot which I
have chosen for the settlement about the middle of an extensive
and safe river, flowing into the sea at the extremity of the
southern part of Van Diemen's Land&mdash;a port, the advantages
of which, when once known, will insure its being the general
rendezvous of all shipping bound into these seas."</blockquote>
<p>The log of the <i>Calcutta</i>, from which the author was
permitted to make the following extracts, at Deptford, is in a
clear hand, and signed by Captain D. Woodriff. The author came
upon it in turning over some two thousand men-of-war logs, which
are kept at the Dockyard. The captain records that at Spithead,
March 31st,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Received my sailing orders from the Admiralty to
take the <i>Ocean</i> transport, on her arrival at Spithead,
under my orders, and to proceed to Port Phillip in New South
Wales; at the same time received instructions for my proceedings
when there . . . . also received an order to receive
Lieutenant-Colonel Collins, and such persons of the Civil
establishment of the new-intended colony for a passage to Port
Phillip, and to victual them the same as my ship's company."<br>
<br>
"<i>April</i> 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Came on board a party of marines
for New South Wales, viz., three officers, three sergeants, three
corporals, two drummers, and thirty-eight privates."</blockquote>
<p>On April 27th, 1803, the departure of the <i>Calcutta</i>,
accompanied by the <i>Ocean</i>, from Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, is
recorded, and the arrival of the former at Rio, June 30th, and of
the latter, July 1st. The departure from this port was on the
20th. Simon's Bay was entered August 13th, and quitted on the
26th. Three cows, two bulls, and twelve sheep for the new colony
were taken on board at the Cape.</p>
<p>An entry of October 9th states,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"At ten, saw the land from the mast-head bearing E.
by S. five or six leagues . . . . At noon, the nearest shore of
King's Island eight miles," and, on the morning of Monday, the
10th, "at five saw the land about Port Phillip bearing about N.
by E. Employed clearing away for anchoring. At eight, set the
topsails and made sail, ranged the cables. At nine, standing in
for what appeared to be the entrance of Port Phillip. Got
soundings seventeen to nineteen fathoms. At 9.30 entered the
harbour of Port Phillip, and at ten came to with the best bower
in six fathoms water. Found the <i>Ocean</i> transport at anchor,
having arrived on Friday last."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sent jolly-boat in shore to sound. Mustered by
divisions. Light breezes and small rain at times. . . . At four,
wore away upon the flood-tide, and moored ship a cable each way,
the small bower to the westward. Proceeded on shore abreast of
the ship, attended by Governor Collins and the first lieutenant

most composed of sand, and no symptoms of fresh water. At
midnight, strong gales with violent squalls and rain from the
S.S.W. A.M." (11th) "Bent the sheet cable. At seven proceeded,
attended by Lieutenant Houstoun and the Governor, to examine the

cleaning the decks and other requisite duties. Carpenters fitting
the launch.<br>

proceeded again, attended by the Governor and Lieutenant Tuckey,
to examine and search further up the bay to the northward,
&amp;c. . . . At &frac14; past 11 p.m., returned on board the
ship, not having been able to discover any fresh water or an
eligible situation to establish the colony, in consequence of the
extensive flats running so far off from the shores . . . . A.M."
(14th) "Proceeded again with the Governor to the place where we
sunk the cask to procure water, and where the Governor from
necessity came to a determination to fix the troops and colony
for the present . . . The carpenter returned with the yawl,
without finding a piece of timber sufficient to repair the
cutwater." He had been in search of it on the eastern side.<br>
<br>
"<i>Friday</i>, 14<i>th</i>. . . . At 2.30 returned on board, the
Governor having determined to fix the camp, &amp;c., near the
spot where I had ordered the casks to be sunk as wells to procure
water . . . . A.M." (15th) "Employed landing the cattle and
stock, together with the camp equipage. Cleared hawse and
directed the master of the <i>Ocean</i> to attend and assist the
master of the <i>Calcutta</i> to sound and examine the channel
near the spot where the colony was to land, in order to move the
ships nearer for landing the stores, &amp;c. The boats returned,
having found sufficient water and good anchorage about two miles
higher up the eastern side of the bay. Sent some more of the
colonial marines and party of working convicts on shore to clear
away and erect some tents, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
"<i>Saturday</i>, 15<i>th</i>. . . . At 30 past noon, unmoored

came to sail, as did the <i>Ocean</i>. At 3.30, light airs and
very variable to the northward, with rain; the tide of ebb,
having made too strong, came to again in thirteen fathoms, the

"Landed part of the colonial stores that were immediately wanted.

Employed fitting the launch to proceed on a survey of the
harbour. Gave Mr. J. H. Tuckey an order to proceed in the launch
to survey the upper part of the harbour of Port Phillip. At 8.30
a.m." (16th) "the launch proceeded on the survey. At 9.30 began
to disembark the convicts and colonial marines: attended with the
Governor at the landing of the men, and directed the master of
the <i>Ocean</i> to land the settlers and their baggage. At noon,
finished the disembarkation of the men, and mustered by
divisions.<br>
<br>
"<i>Monday</i>, 17<i>th</i>. . . . P.M.&mdash;All the boats
employed landing the baggage of the colonial marines and
convicts. The boats of the <i>Ocean</i> employed landing the
settlers and their baggage. A.M." (18th) "Directed the surgeon of
the <i>Calcutta</i> to deliver to Governor Collins the remains of
hospital stores, &amp;c. Employed landing various articles from
the ship, as requested by the Governor. Sent Mr. Purchis, the
master, with the jolly-boat to examine and sound the channel
leading up the bay. Cut four different specimens of wood when on
shore as samples, but the timber in general near the settlement
is very small and low, will not square more than nine or ten
inches, and the shaft not more than eight or ten feet. . . . At 4
p.m. Mr. Purchis returned, having found a good channel and deep
water for four or five miles E.N.E. of the ship. . . . Received
six passengers from the <i>Ocean</i> to proceed to Port Jackson.
. . ."</blockquote>
<p>On the 21st, the <i>Calcutta</i> was brought closer in; and it
is stated, "the captain and master on shore abreast of the ship
in search of fresh water, began to sink wells until we came to
sandstone rock, under which water appeared."</p>
<p>The same evening "Lieutenant Tuckey", who, we have seen, set
out on the 16th, "returned with the launch from surveying the
N.W. part of the bay, where he reports, or rather supposes, from
the swell from the westward, that an opening must certainly be in
that neighbourhood into the ocean on the west side of the land,
possibly about Cape Bridgewater, which passage it was intended to
have explored, but the swell and a strong current or tide setting
from the N.W. drove the boats so far to leeward as to prevent
their getting up again." The conjectures of first explorers
become curious and amusing when read in the light of known facts.
The idea&mdash;which is somewhat similar to one which, we have
seen, Flinders at first entertained&mdash;of a channel connecting
their part of the bay with the S.W. extremity of the Colony, must
be peculiarly entertaining to the inhabitants of Geelong.</p>
<p>At eight o'clock next morning, the 23rd, "Lieutenant Tuckey
proceeded again to survey the reported opening in the N.W. at the
head of the harbour"; and on the evening of the 26th he "returned
with the two boats", having ascertained that instead of an outlet
there was "a long arm of the harbour, in which, on the northern
side, they discovered a secure cove, with sufficient water to
receive shipping, and sufficiently secure to heave them down if
required, but no outlet to the sea."</p>
<p>Grimes was, doubtless, the first white man who ever went up
the arm of bay where Geelong stands, and Tuckey the second. It
would appear that Murray's boats never got so far from the Heads,
and that Flinders only crossed the sheet of water leading up to
Geelong somewhere about Point Richards. He must, however, have
seen the end of the harbour in that direction, from the top of
Station Peak.</p>
<p>The description of Tuckey's investigations is thus continued
in the log:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The timber throughout very small and short, and
latterly very scarce indeed; nor could they find any fresh water.
In the head of this arm Lieutenant Turkey fell in with a large
party of natives, who were very troublesome, and their numbers
increasing from 100 to 200. The lieutenant and party were obliged
to fire upon them, which drove them off, but with loss of one of
their companions, who was shot."</blockquote>
<p>The same day is recorded the firing by the <i>Calcutta</i> of
a royal salute of twenty-one guns, in honour of his Majesty's
accession.</p>
<p>On the morning of November 9th, Captain Woodriff, "at five,
proceeded in the barge, attended by Lieutenant Turkey, to explore
the channel for the ship to approach the watering-place near the
head of the harbour, and, if practicable, to approach it with the
ship"; and it is recorded that next morning "at 1 a.m. Captain
returned from the head of the bay, where fresh water was to be
had at tide time."</p>
<p>At six on the morning of the 19th, the
<i>Calcutta</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Weighed and came to sail, the launch attending on
the north side of the channel leading to Arthur's Seat. At 10,
one of the carpenter's crew came off in the punt to demand a
supply of ammunition, as the natives were very numerous about
their tent, and had been very troublesome. At noon, Lat.
observed, 38&deg; 19' S. Sent the necessary assistance to the
carpenters on shore until I could get up to the place with the
ship. . . . Very squally and unsettled weather with thunder and
lightning; wind flying all round the compass. At 2, anchored with
the best bower in 6 fms. water, . . . . the camp bearing west by
S. &frac14; S.; the end of the spit of the Island shoal N.E.
&frac12; N., veered to &#8531; of a cable. Sent all boats ashore
to fetch off the carpenter, his party, and the timber they had
cut down and prepared. . . . The first Lieut. and Master laying
down an additional buoy upon the spit of Island
shoal."</blockquote>
<p>In the morning of November 21st&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"At 5, weighed and made sail up the harbour; hauled
ranges of cable; the Launch and Yawl sounding ahead and upon each
bow. At 5.15 passed the buoy we laid down upon the Island shoal.
Steered N.N.E. along shore about 3 miles distance, having from 11
to 10 fm. sandy bottom. At 10, being abreast of the river, came
to with the best bower anchor &frac14; less 5 fm. Sandy bottom;
veer'd away and moor'd ship a cable each way."</blockquote>
<p>Thus was anchor first cast in Hobson's Bay, except perhaps by
the <i>Cumberland</i>, which conveyed Grimes and Robbins; but she
was only a small vessel, and the <i>Calcutta</i> a
man-of-war.</p>
<p>Next morning, the 22nd, the log records&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Mostly calm; down top-gt. yards. At 4 a.m. sent
carpenter and hands on shore to search for and cut down timber.
Landed sixty empty butts. An officer and hands on shore filling
water at the river, which must only be done upon the Ebb-tide, as
the water is salt upon the flood, and frequently so when blowing
fresh from the westward. . . . . Received 12 tons of water per
launch and rafts. Employed stowing it away. Carpenters and party
on shore cutting down timber. . . . Sent on shore more empty
casks, but could receive no water in consequence of the violent
surf upon the Beach, that the boats could not approach it. . .
."<br>
<br>
"<i>Wednesday</i>, 23<i>rd</i>.&mdash; . . . . Strong breezes and
squally weather with thunder, lightning, and rain, the Launch at
Grapnel near the shore among the breakers. Sent the Master and
kedge anchor to haul her farther off. At 5, moderate; got off six
butts of water per launch, but could not fill any in the river,
it being as salt as the water in the Bay, occasioned by the surf
on the beach, which penetrates through the sand into the river.
A.M." (24th) "Fresh breezes and a large surf upon the beach;
filled several butts of water up the river, but was obliged to
start them again, being so impregnated with salt. Carpenters on
shore falling timber. Lieut. and party attending the watering,
and getting the timber down to the Beach. . . . Received a Turn
of water per Yawl and small launch from another small run
occasioned by the late rains. Received one load, per large
launch, of compass timber. . . .<br>
<br>
"<i>Friday</i>, 25<i>th</i>. &mdash;. . . . Carpenters and
parties employed on shore falling and hewing timber and filling
water."</blockquote>
<p>The same work is recorded as being done on the four following
days, on the 27th, the supply of water being completed, to the
amount of fifty-five tons. On that day also they "caught a large
quantity of mullet with the seine which was served out to the
ship's company. . . . Mustered the ship's company and read
articles of war and abstract of Acts of Parliament."</p>
<blockquote>"<i>Tuesday</i>, 29<i>th</i>. &mdash;. . . . Struck
the carpenter's and watering parties' tents and brought all
off."</blockquote>
<p>On the morning of December 1st, 1803, the <i>Calcutta</i> left
her mooring at the upper end of the harbour to return to the
settlement. The log of that date records that,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"At 5 cleared hawse and unmoored ship; hove in upon
the small bower. At 9, sent a petty officer and 2 seamen to
accompany the ship in the launch down the harbour. At 9.30
weighed and came to sail with a fresh breeze at N.N.W. The launch
in company. Strong breezes and very squally weather. Hauled
ranges of both cables. Course steered sailing down nearly S.S.W.
Soundings from 5 to 11 fins, sand and clay. At 11, shortened
sail, not seeing the buoy upon the Swan Island shoal; supposed it
to be washed away or sunk. At 11.30 very squally; came to with
the small bower anchor in 6 fm. clay bottom. Launch came to about
&frac12; mile within us; veered to a whole cable. Strong breezes
and heavy squalls with rain, thunder, and lightning; furled
sails. A large sea and swell from the N.W."</blockquote>
<p>The following indicates the position of the ship at this
time:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Eastern side of the entrance of the harbour

Sounded frequently regular soundings from 6 to 8 fm. Light
breezes and fine. At 5.40 shoaled our water to 5 fm. At 5.45 the
ship took the ground upon the spit of sand running from the small
island called Swan or Cygnet Island."</blockquote>
<p>At 4.40 next morning the ship was afloat again, and&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"At 5.15, weighed and made sail for the Narrows. At
5.30 passed through between the buoys &frac14; less 5 fm., not
farther distant than 2&frac12; cables' length asunder. Course

19&frac12; feet water; and at 8.40 came to with the small bower
in 7&frac12; fm. water. Veered away and moored ship a cable each
way."</blockquote>
<p>On Saturday, December 11th, in the morning, "at 5, Lieutenant
Tuckey proceeded overland towards Western Port to examine that
harbour. The Captain and Master surveying the entrance of Port
Phillip and outer bay,"&mdash;a work in which they were also
engaged on the following day.</p>
<blockquote>"<i>Tuesday, Dec</i>. 13<i>th</i>.&mdash;P.M. . . .
At 3 the <i>Ocean</i> entered the harbour, and at 6 anchored near
the <i>Calcutta</i>, having been chartered by Governor King to
proceed back to this port for the purpose of removing the Colony;
for which purpose he had sent the <i>Ocean</i> Transport, as also
the <i>Lady Nelson</i> and a small schooner named the Edwin, but
neither the <i>Lady Nelson</i> or Edwin has yet appeared. The
<i>Ocean</i> also brought back Mr. Collins and the Colonial
Cutter that she picked up at sea and carried to Port Jackson. At
7 Lieutenant Tuckey returned from Western Port. . . . A.M (14th)
. . . . waited upon the Lieut-Governor to signify as <i>Ocean</i>
had arrived to remove the Colony, and other two vessels were
daily expected, I should proceed with the <i>Calcutta</i>
pursuant to my original instructions."</blockquote>
<p>The arrival of the <i>Francis</i> schooner, ten days from Port
Jackson, to assist in the removal of the colony to Van Diemen's
Land, is recorded in the log on the 15th.</p>
<p>At 6.30 on Monday morning, December 19th, the
<i>Calcutta</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Weighed and came to sail. At 7 it fell a little wind
and nearly calm. The tide of ebb running very strong out of the
harbour. At 7.50 passed the Narrows in from 7 to 9 fm. water. . .
. Standing to the S.E. along the Southern Shore at about
2&frac12; miles from the beach. . . . . Got the stream anchor and
hawser clear to stop the ship should the wind continue light and
variable. . . . Standing off shore to the westward and southward,
the swell setting the ship directly to the shore. At 1.40 tacked
to the eastward to endeavour to weather Cape
Schank."</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Calcutta</i> anchored in Sydney Cove, December
26th.</p>
<p>It is stated, on November 7th, that the cutter, taking Mr.
Collins to Sydney, "attempted to get out of the harbour, but
could not." When she did so is not recorded, but the departure of
the <i>Ocean</i> is entered on the 17th.</p>
<p>The scanty particulars of Collins's expedition, given in the
few accounts respecting the colonization of Victoria hitherto
published, have chiefly been derived from Mr. Tuckey, first
lieut. of the <i>Calcutta</i>, who was the historian of the
expedition. On his return to England he brought out a small
volume on the subject,** by far the greater part of which is,
however, devoted to the ship's voyage out and back. In the
chapter on Port Phillip, having described the landing at "a small
bay, eight miles from the harbour's mouth," he speaks briefly of
the danger of the approach to the Heads, the beauty of the
country, nature of the soil, want of water, the timber,
vegetation, birds, insects, fish, minerals, and climate.</p>
<p class="foot">[** "An Account of a Voyage to establish a Colony
at Port Phillip in Bass's Strait, on the South Coast of New South
Wales, in H. Majesty's Ship <i>Calcutta</i>, in the Years
1802-3-4. By J.H. Tuckey, Esq., First Lieut. of the
<i>Calcutta</i>." Published in London, 1805.]</p>
<p>He then describes the natives at considerable length,
detailing an encounter with them on "the N.W. side of the port",
in which one or two of them were killed. Their attack displayed
treachery and considerable daring. "Upwards of two hundred
natives assembled round the surveying boats." This is evidently
the meeting with the natives mentioned in the log of the
<i>Calcutta</i>.</p>
<p>Tuckey describes how he "with several other officers, and a
party of convicts to carry provisions, proceeded by land to
examine Western Port." "After passing the ridge of Arthur's
Seat," they continued "due east, nearly parallel to the sea
shore," until they reached "a point projecting into the sea,"
which they "supposed to be Cape or Point Schank". Immediately
under this they found "two strong runs of water", falling into
the sea. Here they halted for the first night, supposing
themselves to be "twenty-five miles distant from the Camp." They
started at daylight next morning, "and, keeping at the distance
of between three and five miles from the sea, at noon reached
Western Port," the examination of which "was unavoidably confined
to the space of a few miles on the western side; this was
principally owing to the man who carried the whole of our bread,"
says Tuckey, "having absconded soon after quitting the camp, and
to our being deceived in the extent of the Port, as well as the
distance to it, which we found much greater than we had any idea
of."</p>
<p>They were provisioned only for four days&mdash;the party
carrying water with them, and trusting to their guns for
additional food.</p>
<p>From the entrance of Western Port, for twelve miles along the
western shore, they found "but one place of commodious landing
for boats", and three good runs of water, with some pools
"covered with teal of a beautiful plumage, and, what was of much
more importance, of a delicious flavour."</p>
<p>The following is Tuckey's account of the remainder of his
journey:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"As our track to Western Port had never diverged more
than five miles from the sea, it was determined, on returning, to
endeavour to penetrate through the country in a N.W. direction,
which we supposed would bring us to Port Phillip at about twenty
miles' distance from the camp. We accordingly set off at daylight
of the third day from our night's station, which was about five
miles from the entrance of Western Port, and had scarce walked a
quarter of a mile when we came to an immense forest of lofty
gum-trees. The country here becomes very mountainous; in the
valleys, or rather chasms between the mountains, small runs of
water trickle through an almost impenetrable jungle of prickly
shrubs, bound together by creeping plants. After passing eight of
these deep chasms in six miles, which was accomplished with
infinite difficulty in four hours, we found the country grow
still more impenetrable, vast fields of shrub as prickly as furze
arresting our progress every moment. Several of our people who
carried water, being unable to bear the fatigue any longer, we
were obliged to give up our intention; and, after a short rest,
we shaped our course to S.W. in order to approach the sea, where
the country becomes open and less hilly. In this direction we
found the country well-watered, the soil very rich, and in many
places meadows of from fifty to a hundred acres, covered with
grass five feet high, and unencumbered with a single tree. At
sunset we reached the sea at Cape Schank, and, halting for the
night, arrived at the camp in the afternoon of the next
day."</blockquote>
<p>They had, according to the log of the <i>Calcutta</i>, set out
December 11th, and returned on the 13th, that ship leaving Port
Phillip on 19th.</p>
<p>After this examination of the country by Tuckey, there was
clearly no justification for the abandonment of Port Phillip, on
the ground of want of water and barrenness of the soil. Tuckey
records but little further about Port Phillip, which he quitted a
few days afterwards in the <i>Calcutta</i>. The first breaking up
of the settlement had not then taken place, and its complete
removal was not effected for some months after his departure. The
only subsequent particulars respecting it, which have been
published, seem to be those of the Rev. Mr. Knopwood, the
chaplain, from whose diary Mr. Bonwick quotes.</p>
<p>In one sentence of his work, Tuckey has immortalized himself
by leaving what must rank with the most remarkable predictions
ever rendered famous by non-fulfilment; "indeed," says he, "the
Kangaroo seems to reign undisturbed lord of the soil&mdash;a
dominion which, by the evacuation of Port Phillip, he is likely
to retain for ages."</p>
<p>Port Phillip had, however, one fair friend, a "Mrs. Hartley,
or rather Hopley," *** who writes to her sister in England the
following account, which is given by Mr. Bonwick in his "Port
Phillip:"&mdash;"We arrived in October, 1803. My pen is not able
to describe half the beauties of that delightful spot; we were
four months there. Much to my mortification as well as loss, we
were obliged to abandon the settlement, through the whim and
caprice of the Lieut.-Governor. Additional expense to Government,
and additional loss to individuals, were incurred by removing to
Van Diemen's Land, which can never be made to answer. Port
Phillip is my favourite, and has my warmest wishes. During the
time we were there, I never felt one ache or pain, and I parted
with it with more regret than I did my native land."</p>
<p class="foot">[*** There is, as we have seen in the list of the
settlers, a Mr. Hartley, who afterwards applied for compensation
on account of the removal of the settlement; and in that of the
Civil Establishment, a Mr. Hopley, assistant-surgeon. Mr. Bonwick
ought, therefore, perhaps not to incline to the latter name.]</p>
<p>It was fortunate, however, that this first attempt to form a
settlement on Victorian soil did not succeed, for thus the Colony
escaped the evils as well as the stigma of a criminal origin.
Ours, as other Colonies might have done, came into existence and
prosperity without the aid of transportation, which, however
beneficial it may at one time have appeared, instead of
accelerating, undoubtedly retarded the growth of Australia.</p>

<p class="foot">[* It will be convenient to state, once for all,

N. S. Wales Correspondence in the Record Office.]</p>
<p>B<small>ESIDES</small> expeditions, yet to be recorded, made
to the territory of Victoria, prior to its final colonization, a
few things were said and done respecting the country, during the
years it lay under the hasty and unjust condemnation of Collins
and his party, which cannot be omitted from any historical
account professing to be accurate and complete.</p>
<p>We have seen that Governor King, in writing to Collins, Dec.
30th, 1803, says that he thought it necessary that a small
establishment should be left at Port Phillip in the the most
eligible situation, and suggests that a trusty Serjeant and
superintendent might be sufficient, until further instructions
should be received from England. But, although the remainder of
the expedition under Lieutenant Sladden did not leave until May
18th, 1804, for some reason, no notice appears to have been taken
of Governor King's desire. At the very time when the place was
being abandoned, his Excellency was considering the expediency of
its occupation, for on May 15th, only three days before Sladden
left Port Phillip, King thus writes to Lord Hobart:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Having in my despatch by the <i>Calcutta</i>
possessed your lordship of the reasons which induced Lieut.
Collins to fix his colony at the River Derwent, on the south
coast of Van Diemen's Land, . . . . and considering that this
event could not have entered into your lordship's contemplation
at the time your despatch of June 24th last was wrote, I deemed
it most advisable to require the opinion and advice of the two
principal officers in this Colony, viz., Lieut.-Colonel Paterson
and Brevet-Major George Johnson, on the points contained in the
enclosed statement, and have in consequence thereof determined on
despatching Lieut.-Colonel Paterson, as soon as possible, in the
colonial vessel to examine Port Dalrymple, and from thence
proceed to Port Phillip and Western Port on the south coast of
New Holland, and on the north side of Bass's Straits, to fix on
the best situation for a settlement at one of those places; he
will then return to this place and inform me of his proceedings
and observations, when I shall send him with his own company and
a proportion of convicts and settlers, and every other assistance
our stores can afford. I shall also, on receiving Col. Paterson's
report, send as trusty a person as I can select to fix a post
either at Port Phillip or Western Port, as may be deemed most
expedient."</blockquote>
<p>The opinion of the officers above referred to was elicited in
reply to several queries submitted on May 18th, 1804, of which
the following are two:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"On a perusal of Governor King's letter to the Right
Hon. Lord Hobart, dated 23rd November, 1802, and his instructions
enclosed with that despatch to Mr. Robbins, does it appear that
Storm Bay and Port Phillip, or King's Island, are recommended for
settlements being made to counteract any intention of the French
intruding a claim to the prescribed limits of any part of this
territory?<br>
<br>
"<i>Ans</i>.&mdash;It appears so to us.<br>
<br>
"Reverting to the circumstance of Governor Collins being settled
on the south coast of Van Diemen's Land, and Lieut.-Colonel
Paterson being intended to establish Port Dalrymple, situate on
the north side of Van Diemen's Land and on the south side of
Bass's Straits, in conformity to his lordship's commands, Does it
not appear that his lordship's views, contained in the despatch
of June 24th, 1803, requires that either Port Phillip or Western
Port, on the south coast of New Holland and on the north side of
Bass's Straits, should be occupied by a post being established at
one of those ports?<br>
<br>
"<i>Ans</i>.&mdash;Port Dalrymple will be occupied by
Lieut.-Colonel Paterson in conformity to his lordship's commands;
it is also our opinion that his lordship's reasons for giving
these commands result from Governor King's despatch of November
23rd, 1802, which his lordship states to be rendered peculiarly
necessary in a political point of view. We are therefore of
opinion that one of the two ports on the south side of New
Holland and on the north side of Bass's Straits ought to be
occupied, and a post established in the most eligible port of the
two."</blockquote>
<p>In a postscript of the 16th May, 1804, to a letter dated the
15th to Mr. Sullivan, Governor King says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Since closing this letter I have received his
lordship's commands respecting settling Port Dalrymple; and
anticipating his lordship's further commands, viewing existing
circumstances, I shall also direct a post to be occupied either
at Port Phillip or Western Port, as may be deemed most eligible
by Lieut.-Col. Paterson, who sails in the <i>Integrity</i> cutter
in four days with a party to examine Port Dalrymple (where he
will leave a sufficient guard and some convicts), Port Phillip,
and Western Port; and on that officer's return, which I expect in
about four months, every other arrangement pointed out by his
lordship will be made."</blockquote>
<p>In a letter from King to Lord Hobart of August 14th, it is
stated that the "<i>Integrity</i> sailed the 7th June and
proceeded to the southward of Cape Howe, when she returned here
the 21st, having met with much bad weather and foul winds."</p>
<p>In Governor King's instructions, dated June 1st, 1804, to
Lieutenant-Governor Paterson, appears the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"You are also to examine how far you consider Port
Phillip or Western Port the most eligible for forming a post at,
not so much with a view to its being considered a present
agricultural settlement as a post of occupancy; although your
observations respecting the former advantages of Port Dalrymple,
Port Phillip, and Western Port, ought not to be totally
disregarded."</blockquote>
<p>On January 16th, 1805, Governor King writes to Lord
Hobart,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Acting-Lieut. Robbins having arrived before the
<i>Lady Barlow</i>'s departure enables me to communicate the
result of that officer's researches, by which your lordship will
observe that there is no port within the Straits than those
already known, viz., Port Dalrymple on the south side, and Port
Phillip and Western Port on the north side; and that Western Port
is, in a great measure, unfit for an agricultural settlement,
however well adapted its situation may hereafter be found for the
establishment of a post.<br>
<br>
"Exclusive of ascertaining these objects&mdash;the exact
situation of Cape Albany Otway, the North Cape of the west
entrance of the Straits is now ascertained, which has hitherto
been doubtful, and is very necessary for vessels coming here
through Bass's Straits to be acquainted with.<br>
<br>
"In addition to the chart of Acting-Lieut. Robbins's examination
of the N.W. point of Van Diemen's Land and Cape Albany Otway, I
have taken the liberty of sending an open despatch, containing a
letter from me to the Secretary of the Admiralty, enclosing
Acting-Lieut. Robbins's log, and a printed chart with the above
corrections, which I respectfully submit may be sent to the
Admiralty Board for the inspection of the hydrographer, Mr.
Dalrymple."</blockquote>
<p>Having now done with a man whose memory must always be
associated with honour in connexion with the early history of
Victoria, this will be the best place to mention what became of
him. In a letter of Lord Castlereagh of April, 1809, to the Lords
of the Treasury, the widow of Governor King, of New South Wales,
is recommended a pension of 200<i>l</i>. a year, on the ground of
her husband's "unremitting zeal and integrity" during "more than
twenty years' service", "in forming subordinate settlements in
that remote quarter of the globe or in conducting the government
of the whole." He is stated to have died September 3rd, 1808.</p>
<p>The written description by Robbins of Western Port exists in
the Record Office.** It principally consists of directions for
vessels visiting the harbour. The entrance is spoken of as st
wide and safe for a ship of any draft of water either to sail or
work in." Robbins says of the spring "found by the <i>Lady
Nelson</i> in 1802". "I cannot recommend it, for we found it
brackish." The following short extracts are given, as they may be
of some use in identifying certain localities elsewhere referred
to. Western Island is the name by which French Island seems to
have been called.</p>
<p class="foot">[** It is entitled, "Remarks, &amp;c., on the
Western Port, in His Majesty's Armed Colonial Vessel
<i>Integrity</i>. By Acting-Lieut. Charles Robbins, of His
Majesty's Ship <i>Buffalo</i>."]</p>
<blockquote>"Observing that off the west point of Western Island
angles off a muddy flat shoal, leaving a channel between it and
the N.E. point of Phillip Island about 2 miles; it runs flat a
good way off this point; having brought this point to bear south
about 1&frac12; miles at half-tide, the flat shoal of Western
Island will show itself to the northward of you, and as you run
up the channel widens, and a red bluff point of the main will
open with the S.E. point of Elizabeth Island; but this island,
lying so close in, makes a projecting point of Western Island,
those two points being only open; a little islet, or rather
shoal, will then show itself&mdash;this shoal is covered with
bushes; you may then steer directly for it, and will have from 7
to 15 fms. in the channel. The best anchorage appears to be to
bring this little islet to bear about N.E. &frac12; E. 1&frac34;
miles, and the S.E. of Elizabeth Island S.W.; there you may
anchor in 8 or 10 fms. muddy bottom, and is by far the best part
of the harbour. I worked the <i>Integrity</i> down to the
<i>Nelson</i>'s watering-place from this anchorage.</blockquote>
<p align="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>
<blockquote>"This Port may rather be called a spacious than a
good harbour for shipping, as from Elizabeth Island up it becomes
intricate, abounding with numerous shoals. The shores of the
main, as well as the Western Island, are bound with extensive
flat, muddy beaches. . . . Nor have I seen any place where fresh
water could be procured without the greatest difficulty; a creek
which was found at the N.W. part of the head of the port is the
only place where a quantity could be procured.<br>
<br>
"The passage up the port to the northward, between the main and
the west point of the Western Island, abounds with shoals;
however, a channel all round the Western Island exists, I have no
doubt, for a ship of any draft of water, were the situation of
the various shoals well ascertained. The East or S.E. side of the
port, therefore, at present is the only place a ship could
attempt with safety. . . . The North-East part of the head of the
port is all a fresh-water Tea Tree Swamp; on the hills a few
small gums, soil of very sandy nature; here is a small salt
creek; the fresh swamp is close at the back of it. The North-West
part of the head of the port, for five or six miles in extent
from east to west, and as far as I walked for 7 or 8 miles to the
northward, and apparently as far back as the mountains that
border on Port Phillip, is a fine meadow or pasture land, clothed
with fine grass and thinly with small gum and swamp oak trees. .
. . Here is a small creek of fresh water where a boat might come
in at half-tide. . . . At the western extreme of this
pasture-land commences, and runs all the way down to the sandy
point abreast of the west point of the Western Island, a
miserable low and swampy country for three or four miles in. . .
.<br>
<br>
"The soil on some of the points of the Western Island is pretty
good, but for the most part it is of a very sandy nature. . .
.<br>
<br>
"Having carefully examined the face of the country in the
vicinity of this port, I am of opinion that it possesses no great
advantages to render it an eligible place for a settlement. It is
badly watered; the greatest part of the land about it is low and
swampy, and very few trees of any size were seen."</blockquote>
<p>Lieutenant Robbins concludes with the extract previously
quoted, in which he expresses the opinion that the river at the
head of Port Phillip Bay would be a better site for a settlement
than any at Western Port. He makes the latitude of the southern
part of Phillip Island 38&deg; 33'.</p>
<p>There are also two MSS. in the Record Office by Lieutenant J.
Oxley, R.N.*** which contain some statements bearing upon our
subject. In the second of these the writer states,&mdash;"I was
in Western Port in 1804-5, having been sent by Captain Kent of
the <i>Buffalo</i> to accompany Lieutenant Robbins in the
<i>Integrity</i> cutter to ascertain whether it afforded any site
for forming a settlement, should Government have any intention to
occupy a port on the north side of the Straits. Port Phillip
having been previously examined by the <i>Calcutta</i> and found
ineligible for that purpose." He says that he was never in Port
Phillip, but that "the chart of it by Captain Flinders is
esteemed the best&mdash;there is another published by Lieutenant
Murray, the discoverer, which will serve well enough to run in
by."</p>
<p class="foot">[*** One dated 1810, on the "Country and
Settlements formed in Van Diemen's Land"; the other immediately
following it, "Remarks and Observations on the Coast of New South
Wales, including the Passage from the Cape of Good Hope, through
Bass's Straits, and round the South Cape to Port Jackson."]</p>
<p>Oxley describes Western Port in very similar terms to those
used by Robbins&mdash;in fact, in some places his words are the
same; but he conveys some information not given by his companion.
He states that Western Port "is the port to which M. Peron
directs the attention of the French Government in the event of
forming any establishment, and remarks that he hopes in this
place to see 'another Pondicherry arise.'" Oxley condemns it in
more decided terms than Robbins, observing, "If Port Phillip was
found bad, this port is certainly much worse, and can never in
any point of view be considered as a fit place for a settlement,
if at any future time it should be judged advisable to have
possession of a port on the north side of Bass's Straits. In
1802-3 the French carefully examined this Port and King's Island,
but I rather suspect they found nothing in either so very
inviting as to induce them to visit them again." This extract is
from the document bearing date 1810.</p>
<p>Thus, condemnation upon condemnation having been heaped upon
the territory of Port Phillip, the idea of forming a small
settlement or post of occupation, at either of its principal
harbours, appears to have been completely given up. The visit of
Robbins and Oxley to Western Port seems to have caused such a
project to have been finally laid aside for some years.</p>
<p>Before concluding with Oxley's documents, however, two or
three interesting facts which they contain must be noticed.
Speaking of Furneaux's and Cape Baron Islands, he remarks that
"Wilson's Promontory. . . is formed precisely of the same
materials as those islands, as are all primitive mountains in Van
Diemen's Land; there are regular soundings all over the Straits
from one side to the other, and it is not improbable but those
islands and other high rocks in the Straits are the summits of
lofty mountains, whilst either some great convulsion of nature,
or the agitation of the ocean, has sunk their base below the
level of the adjacent shores."</p>
<p>Oxley gives some directions respecting "the route to Port
Jackson through Bass's Straits", which, he says, "has now become
common, and affords, in the opinion of many, a much shorter
passage than round the South Cape." Sailors are told, "after they
have got as far to the Eastward as 130&deg;, "to keep in the
parallel of 39&deg; 11'"; and that "Cape Albany Otway is the best
land to make."</p>
<p>King's Island is spoken of as "very extensive, but affords
only one tolerable anchorage, viz. Elephant Bay. . . . In all the
charts of those straits which I have seen, this island is placed
considerably too far to the eastward; the latitude of Elephant
Bay, as ascertained by Lieutenant Murray in the <i>Lady
Nelson</i>, may be relied on"&mdash;viz. 39&deg; 51' 17".</p>
<p>"Between Cape Albany Otway and Wilson's Promontory the coast
falls almost directly back to the Northward&mdash;between those
two capes are two ports, viz., Port Phillip and Western Port,
neither of them good ones."</p>
<p>Describing Wilson's Promontory, Oxley says, "About ten miles
directly south of" it "is a remarkable high round island called
Rock Donda&mdash;between this island and the main are several
rocks and small islands, there is, however, a safe passage
between them, the usual passage for ships is to take Bock Donda
on the larboard hand."</p>
<p>Allusion is made to Port Phillip in a despatch to Lord
Castlereagh from Colonel Paterson, Lieutenant-Governor and
founder of the settlement at Port Dalrymple, Launceston, who,
writing from Yorkton August 12th, 1806, says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I have always considered this settlement of serious
moment, solely from its relative situation, which becomes in the
extreme more interesting from the circumstance of neither Port
Phillip or Western Port on the north side of the Straits and on
the south of the continent, being settled from the considerable
obstacles they present, which thus renders this the only port in
those Straits, the discovery of which must ultimately have the
desirable effect of doing away the necessity of sailing round the
South Cape, thereby saving a boisterous passage of ten degrees.
And although I have ever conceived that the particular advantages
of the local situation of this harbour as of sufficient
importance to alone render its establishment positively
necessary, yet it has, combined to these, an immense tract of one
of the most beautiful countries in the world."</blockquote>
<p>We have not yet done with Oxley's reports involving
condemnations of the Victorian territory. On April 18th,</p>
<p>1816, according to a despatch of Governor Macquarie to Earl
Bathurst, written on that day, Surveyor-General Oxley left
Sydney, for the purpose, in the words of another despatch of May
16th, "of prosecuting the discoveries to the westward, as far as
the ocean." In this document Governor Macquarie announces the
arrival of Oxley's party on the River Lachlan, "with provisions
and necessaries of every description, fully sufficient for five
months, in which time there is no doubt they will be able to
return to Bathurst, after executing the service they are sent on,
and tracing the Lachlan River to the sea, in case it extends so
far."</p>
<p>Governor Macquarie, in a despatch of September 5th, 1817,
communicates the result of Oxley's journey down the Lachlan,
stating that it "is matter of great disappointment and
mortification to me, having entertained, as I conceived, the best
grounded hopes that" the "Lachlan would have emptied itself by
the accession of many waters in a copious river into the sea on
the S.W. coast of this continent, and have marked the situation
of a future settlement."</p>
<p>Macquarie was more correct in his first judgment, when he
anticipated that a large river, fed by a number of streams, would
reach the southern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>He gives still more decided expression to his disappointment
at the result of Oxley's subsequent expedition down the
Macquarie, declaring in a despatch to Earl Bathurst of March 1st,
1819:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"If, my lord, I felt disappointment and regret at the
unexpected termination of the River Lachlan, . . . . it is
altogether impossible to state how much more I have felt
mortified by the sanguine expectations formed of the Macquarie,
having proved even more abortive than on the former occasion. . .
. Thus impressed with the futility of sending any further
expedition with a view to inspect all the boundaries of that vast
Savanna where Mr. Oxley abandoned his survey in hopeless
disappointment, I shall not take any further measures therein,
unless under instructions from your lordship."</blockquote>
<p>These expeditions had an undoubted bearing upon the discovery
of the territory of our Colony, being projected for the purpose
of determining the direction of the inland watershed of
Australia, which leads towards Victoria. The whole of that
portion of the island-continent was also included in the sweeping
condemnation which Oxley affixed to a vast region, when he found
that his Lachlan expedition had not realized his
expectations.</p>
<p>In his letter of August 30th, 1817, to Governor Macquarie,
enclosed in a despatch to Lord Bathurst of September 5th, Oxley
says, "I proceeded down the Lachlan in company with the boats
until the 12th May", and then, having described how he lost the
river among marshes, he proceeds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I determined, . . . . divesting ourselves of
everything that could possibly be spared, to proceed with the
horses loaded with the additional provisions from the boats, on
such a course towards the coast as would intersect any stream
that might arise from the divided waters of the Lachlan.<br>
<br>
"In pursuance of this plan I quitted the river on the 17th May,
taking a S.W. course towards Cape Northumberland as the best one
to answer my intended purpose. I will not here detail the
difficulties and privations we experienced in passing through a
barren and desolate country, without water, but such rain-water
as was found remaining in holes and the crevices of rocks. I
continued this course till the 9th June, when, having lost two
horses through fatigue and want, and the others in a deplorable
condition,"</blockquote>
<p>he changed his course "along a range of lofty hills" until
June 23rd, when he fell in with a stream which was with
difficulty recognized as the Lachlan. The course down it is thus
described:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I continued along the stream until 8th July, it
having taken, during this period, a westerly direction, and
passing through a perfectly level country, barren in the extreme,
and being evidently at periods entirely under water. To this
point it had been gradually diminishing and spreading its waters
over stagnant lagoons and morasses, without receiving any stream
that we knew of during the whole extent of its course. The banks
were not more than three feet high, and the marks of floods on
the shrubs and bushes showed that at times it rose between two
and three feet higher, causing the whole country to become a
marsh, and altogether uninhabitable.<br>
<br>
"Further progress westward, had it been possible, was now
useless, as there was neither hill or rising ground of any kind
within the compass of our view, which was only bounded by the
horizon in every quarter, entirely devoid of timber, except a few
diminutive gums on the very edge of the stream might be so
termed. The water in the bed of the Lagoon, as it might now
properly be denominated, was stagnant, its breadth about 20 feet,
and the heads of grass growing in it showed it to be about 3 feet
deep.<br>
<br>
"This originally unlooked-for and truly singular termination of a
river which we had anxiously hoped, and reasonably expected,
would have led to a far different conclusion, filled us with most
painful sensations. We were full 600 miles west of Sydney, and
nearly in its latitude; and it had taken us ten weeks of
unremitted exertion to proceed so far. The nearest part of the
coast about Cape Bernouilli, had it been accessible, was distant
about 150 miles. We had demonstrated beyond the shadow of a doubt
that no river whatever could fall into the sea between Cape Otway
and Spencer's Gulph; at least none deriving their waters from the
Eastern Coast, and that the country south of the parallel of
34&deg;, and west of the meridian of 147&deg; 30' East was
uninhabitable and useless for all the purposes of civilized
man."</blockquote>
<p>Oxley's demonstration, beyond the shadow of a doubt, is
certainly only surpassed by Tuckey's wonderful prediction. It is
singular that the limits within which, it was thus demonstrated,
no river could possibly fall into the sea, should be precisely
those in which was to be discovered the mouth of the greatest
river of Australia, the Murray, which receives the waters of so
many streams, including the Lachlan and Macquarie. The whole of
Victoria, the principal portion of South Australia, as well as a
large extent of valuable country in N. S. Wales itself, were thus
proclaimed uninhabitable in Oxley's wholesale excommunication of
territory from the pale of civilization.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all the signal instances of erroneous judgment
on record with regard to Victoria, subsequent explorers have not
been sufficiently cautious in entering the regions of prophecy
and condemnation. Other parts of Australia have since been
declared worthless, on grounds not more substantial than those
upon which the conclusions of Tuckey and Oxley were based. For
instance, Sturt's progress in Central Australia in 1844, having
been checked by a stony, waterless tract of country, the popular
notion of a vast inland desert sprung up and existed for some
years, till exploded by the heroic but ill-fated explorers, Burke
and Wills.</p>
<p>One or two incidents, bearing on the exploration of Australia
generally, may now be introduced. In a despatch to Lord Bathurst,
of April 4th, 1817, Governor Macquarie acknowledges the receipt
of Captain Flinders's charts of "Australia," and the journal of
his voyage. This is the first time that the name of Australia
appears to have been officially employed. The Governor underlines
the word. He states it was in pursuance of his lordship's
despatch of April 18th, 1816, that the expedition "for
prosecuting the discoveries recently made to the westward of the
Blue Mountains" had been fitted out; and, in a private letter to
Mr. Secretary Goulbourn, M.P., of December 21st, 1817, says,
speaking of the expedition which had sailed that very morning for
the West Coast of Australia,&mdash;"Lieutenant King expects to be
absent from Port Jackson between eight and nine months; and, I
trust, in that time will be able to make very important additions
to the geographical knowledge already acquired of the Continent
of <i>Australia</i>, which, I hope, will be the name given to
this country in future, instead of the very erroneous and
misapplied name hitherto given it of '<i>New Holland</i>', which,
properly speaking, only applies to a part of this immense
Continent."</p>
<p>In a letter of February 4th, 1817, to Lieutenant King, Mr.
T.W. Croker speaks of "the unexplored parts of the Continent of
New South Wales."</p>
<p>There is also a long letter to Lord Bathurst, dated April
22nd, 1817, from Mr. William Wentworth, in which he volunteers,
with much youthful ardour, to proceed to Australia for the
purpose of "exploring this fifth Continent, even from its eastern
extremity to its western,"&mdash;an enterprise which he declares
he is prepared to undertake, with the conviction that he "must
perfect the object or perish in the effort." The reply directed
to be given was, that the Governor had been instructed to send
out an expedition to the west of the Blue Mountains, which, it is
hoped, may have started before any fresh directions from this
country could reach him.</p>
<p>The names of the writers would be a temptation to stretch a
point, to bring in the two following letters upon an interesting
scientific subject, even if it had no direct bearing upon the
general geography and exploration of Australia. The first is a
private letter from the famous Sir Robert Peel, whose request was
complied with:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">"<i>Whitehall, Oct</i>.
20<i>th</i>, 1823.   </p>
<blockquote>"<small>DEAR LORD BATHURST</small>,&mdash;I have had
an interview with Sir Humphrey Davy, who is very anxious that
authority should be given to Sir Thomas Brisbane to measure an
arc of the meridian in New South Wales. I think every question
which one would naturally put before a proceeding of this kind
shall be sanctioned by the Government can be in this case
satisfactorily answered. Sir Humphrey Davy and his colleagues at
the Board of Longitude consider the interests of science will be
greatly promoted by the measurement.<br>
<br>
"They have entire confidence in the scientific persons whom Sir
Thomas Brisbane has on the spot, particularly Mr. Runcker. The
necessary instructions are already provided and in New South
Wales.<br>
<br>
"Sir Humphrey does not consider that the expense can be
considerable. I asked him to name the maximum, and he answered
one thousand pounds. Under these circumstances may I encourage
Sir H. Davy to hope that you will sanction and direct the
measurement proposed, which, if it be considered also, will serve
as a base line for any future interior survey of the
Colony?</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="right">"Ever most truly
yours,           <br>
<small>"ROBERT PEEL.</small>"   </p>
<p>The following is from Sir Humphrey Davy:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">"<i>Apartments, Royal
Society,   <br>
"Nov</i>. 21<i>st</i>, 1823.           </p>
<blockquote>"<small>MY LORD</small>,&mdash;The Right Honourable
his Majesty's Secretary of State for the Home Department having
done me the honour to inform me that your lordship was favourably
disposed to an undertaking which the Council of the Royal Society
consider as important to the interests of science, namely, the
admeasurement of an arc of the meridian of New South Wales, I
take the liberty, at their request, of transmitting this to your
lordship.<br>
<br>
"Several arcs have been measured in the Northern Hemisphere; but
one only, and that at a time when instruments were very
imperfect, in the Southern.<br>
<br>
"The present moment appears peculiarly favourable for such a work
to the Council, as there are persons at Paramatta who are able
astronomers and who are in possession of the necessary
instruments, with the exception only of a Zenith Sector.<br>
<br>
"The measurement of an arc in New South Wales would not only be
of importance to astronomy in affording data for determining
correctly the figure of the earth&mdash;a matter of great
interest to navigation&mdash;but would likewise be useful in
laying a foundation for a correct survey of our Colonies in that
great and unexplored country.<br>
<br>
"Your lordship's liberal and enlightened mind will, I am sure,
require no apology for this communication, which, as President of

<p>A Mr. William Leckie writes to Earl Bathurst from Old Broad
Street, on November 23rd, 1822, urging that, instead of the
suggested penal settlements at Morton Bay, Port Curtis, and Port
Bowen, it would be better to have the coast between Cape Otway
and Spencer's Gulf explored, with a view to the establishment of
a settlement there, in a more suitable climate, and to which the
length of voyage and expense of sending convicts would be
considerably less. Mr. Leckie makes one of those suggestions
which are amusing when read in the light of full information
respecting the regions to which they refer. He contends that as
Oxley had observed that the Lachlan was lost in marshes, and had
then reappeared to be again lost in others, these latter "must
extend to no great distance from the sea-coast; or, the country
being flat, a canal could easily be cut by the convicts, which
would render the whole country, to the westward of the Blue
Mountains, available for exportable produce."</p>
<p>The next we hear of Port Phillip is in a letter to Mr.
Secretary Wilmot Horton, Colonial Office, dated December 13th,
1824, from Mr. Thomas Rixon Williams, of Whilwell, near Tenby,
who aspired to make no less ample provision for his family than
the possession of the principal portion of the territory of
Victoria. He commences by saying that he was "anxious to make a
comfortable provision for a fast increasing family, and honestly
to benefit my latest posterity"; and, after expressing a desire
to promote emigration and colonization, asks the Government "to
confer upon me, my heirs and assigns for ever, a free grant of
land . . together with all rights and privileges inherent in or
arising from or belonging to the same." He then describes several
tracts on the mainland and Van Diemen's Land, one or more of
which he asks to be permitted to choose, among others,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"5th. All that tract of waste uninhabited land lying
around Port Phillip and Western Port, and bounded on the west by
a real or imaginary or natural line drawn or running northward
from the ocean in Long. 143&deg; 0' East to Lat. 36&deg; South;

<p>A<small>S</small> yet all the explorations of Victoria had
been confined to the coast, there being no record of any one
having penetrated more than a very few miles inland. The
expedition next in order of date came from a different direction,
and completely intersected the territory. Its results were
perhaps more important, as they certainly were more satisfactory,
than those of any previous expedition. The one in question was
that of Messrs. Hume and Hovell. The first-named explorer, Mr.
Hamilton Hume, was a native of N. S. Wales, and Captain Hovell
had been in the Colony since 1813. It is to be regretted that
these two gentlemen did not agree very well; in fact, on more
than one occasion during the journey, their differences were so
serious that Hovell and his attendants separated from Hume, but
soon, however, rejoined him again, he being the better
bush-man.</p>
<p>The point which the expedition reached was a subject of
dispute between Hume and Hovell&mdash;the latter being of opinion
that it was Western Port, the former that it was Port Phillip.
Some writers assert that this difference of opinion arose as soon
as the coast was reached; but, although there was afterwards a
decided disagreement on the subject between the leaders of the
expedition, the following letter, which the author has
discovered, would seem clearly to prove that, even after his
return to Sydney, Hume was under the impression that he had
reached the shores of Western Port.</p>
<p>If the question had, from the first, been a matter of dispute
between him and Hovell, Hume would doubtless have taken the
earliest opportunity of asserting his belief on the subject, and
would have at once communicated it to Governor Brisbane. The
chart, to which we shall subsequently refer, clearly indicates
Port Phillip; but, as far as the coast is delineated, it must
have been from information other than that acquired during the
journey. The name of Port Phillip is not once mentioned in Hume's
two earliest letters * on the subject of his journey&mdash;the
one which immediately follows and another, that of April 20th,
1826. The former, to Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane, transmitted to
Earl Bathurst, with a despatch from Governor Darling, dated
October 10th, 1826, gives the explorer's impression fresh, the
day after his return, and before he had had time to modify his
opinions. He thus writes:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* In the Record Office.]</p>
<p class="quote" align="right"><i>"Appin, January</i>
24<i>th</i>, 1825.   </p>
<blockquote>"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;I have the honour to
acquaint your Excellency that last evening I arrived safe home in
company with Mr. Hovell, who accompanied me in the expedition
your Excellency was pleased to entrust to my care for the purpose
of exploring a passage through the interior to Western Port.<br>
<br>
"I feel much pleasure in informing your Excellency that we have
discovered, adjoining to that extensive harbour, one of the
finest parts or tracts of country yet known in
Australia&mdash;immense downs and forests partially wooded, the
whole of which is easy of access and well-watered by the
different streams that run into the Tweed&mdash;I have so taken
the liberty to name the river that falls into Western Port; and I
think I may venture to say that there is, around and adjoining
the Tweed, from 80 to 100 miles of a square country that is fit
for any purpose of agriculture or grazing. The downs extend from
E.N.E. to W.S.W. full 80 miles, and they are upwards of 40 miles
in breadth in S.E. and N.W. directions.<br>
<br>
"The soil over the whole of these immense plains is good, but of
different qualities&mdash;samples of which I have brought that
were procured about ten miles distant from one another, together
with different kinds of stones, which I will forward for your
Excellency's inspection.<br>
<br>
"On Tuesday, 16th November, when in Lat. 36&deg; 20', Long.
147&deg; 25', we came on an extensive river, running at about 3
miles an hour to the westward; it was upwards of two fathoms in
depth, nearly 100 yards in width, and, for want of a boat, it was
not in our power to cross, and we proceeded down along its banks
in hopes of finding a ford where we might cross; but, after
travelling upwards of 20 miles down the river in a westerly
direction, the river became much wider and deeper than when we
first fell in with it, and not the least likelihood of there
being any shoal or ford that was possible for us to cross at. We
then determined on returning up the river to the Eastward, until
we could get above some of the streams that fell in from the
Southward, and on Saturday, 20th of November, at 3 o'clock in the
afternoon, when we had got above the second junction, we
succeeded in crossing the major branch with a temporary boat made
of tarpauling, which answered the purpose of taking our
provisions across, and such of the men as could not swim.<br>
<br>
"The river where we returned from on the 17th was then running
W.S.S. and was about the size of the Hawkesbury River at Windsor;
on the 24th November and 3rd December we fell in with and crossed
two more considerable streams, the former of which is in Lat.
36&deg; 24', Long. 147&deg; 10', and the latter, the last stream
we crossed before we arrived at Western Port, is in Lat. 37&deg;
22', Long. 146&deg; 25',they run to the westward at 1&frac12;
mile per hour, and take their rise to the eastward among the
Snowy Mountains. We came in sight of those snowy ranges on the
8th November, the East End of them then bore from us due South.
Their general course is N.E. and S.W., which obliged us to keep
considerably to the westward to avoid them.<br>
<br>
"I beg leave to recommend to your Excellency's notice and
favourable consideration, the men who accompanied us on the
expedition, as they have undergone a great deal of fatigue, and
have been very attentive to all orders given to them.<br>
<br>
"I will do myself the honour of waiting on your Excellency in a
few days, and trust I shall be able to render a satisfactory
account of our journey to Bass's Straits.</blockquote>

(Signed)      <small>"HAMILTON HUME."</small>   </p>
<p>In a private letter, also in the Record Office, from Governor
Sir Thomas Brisbane, apparently to Mr. Sec. Wilmot Horton, dated
March 24th, 1825, Hume and Hovell's great discoveries are thus
referred to:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I have also to announce to you the discovery of a
new and valuable country of great extent, extending from Lake
George towards Western Port, in Bass's Straits, by two young men,
Messrs. Hovell and Hume, the latter colonial; they were directed
by me to try and reach Spencer's Gulf in the hope of intercepting
any rivers that might run South of that parallel of Longitude,
and discharge themselves into these Straits. They were absent
near 3 months, but only got to the former place. It is my
intention, as soon as I have the means, to send a colonial vessel
to Western Port, to have that explored, as it seems to have
escaped Flinders and others. The other persons seem to have
performed their duty well."</blockquote>
<p>Governor Brisbane seems to have been unacquainted with the
investigations of Western Port by Grant, Murray, Robbins and
Oxley&mdash;so far and so soon had the early history of Colonial
discovery been forgotten.</p>
<p>In another letter,** upwards of a year after the first, Hume
speaks of Western Port, and is still silent about Port
Phillip.</p>

His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Colonial
Department, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.<br>
<br>
"<small>MY LORD</small>,&mdash;The prompt attention of your
lordship to the claims any individual may have the necessity of
submitting to your lordship, and the impartial disposition which
so much characterize your public conduct, emboldens me at this
time to intrude thus on your lordship's notice.<br>
<br>
"The increased emigration and population of this territory, in
the year 1824, arose to such an extent, and the then known
boundaries of eligible land thus being much circumscribed, the
established Colonists' means of extending their pursuits were, of
course, proportionately confined, and, in many instances, the
late emigrants were quite unable to select land, either for
agriculture or that of depasturing stock, &amp;c., in the
vicinity of any accessible safe harbour for shipping.<br>
<br>
"These circumstances loudly called for the services of some
person or persons who were qualified to explore those hitherto
unexplored regions, which, from their geographical situation,
were best calculated to remedy the evil, and give present
facility to the Colonist; and Sir Thomas Brisbane, ever anxious
to promote the interest and welfare of this extensive and
interesting Colony, expressed a wish for some person to undertake
a tour of four or five hundred miles into the interior.<br>
<br>
"Presuming myself (although an Australian) capable from
experience of undertaking such an expedition, I represented my
willingness to do so to his Excellency, who promised his sanction
and protection; and under this impression, I, in company with
Captain Hovell, prepared and purchased at our own private
expense, such convenience and necessaries as were suitable for an
undertaking of the kind.<br>
<br>
"Accordingly, in the month of October, 1824, we took our
departure from the most remote southern point of the County
Argyle, then known; and explored all that tract of country lying
between our point of departure (Lake George) and Western Port,
Bass's Straits, with more success than exceeded our most sanguine
expectations, an account of which I presume has before now been
honoured by your lordship's notice.<br>
<br>
"As a remuneration for those services, I have received a grant of
twelve hundred acres of Land; a quantity which the late Governor,
Sir Thomas Brisbane, did not feel justified in exceeding, but
promised to recommend me to your lordship's consideration.<br>
<br>
"I respectfully beg leave to impress on your lordship's mind the
great expense attending and fitting out such an expedition, the
losses, hardships, dangers, and privations attending so perilous
a pursuit for the period of seventeen weeks, and the incalculable
benefit that must arise at a future period to the public as the
discovery of so good and extensive a tract of land adjoining
Western Port; which promises to be a real and invaluable
acquisition to this and the mother country; inasmuch as its
advantages for shipping, agriculture, or the depasturing of
stock, &amp;c., are much superior to any discoveries yet known in
New South Wales.<br>
<br>
"Should there at some future period be a settlement established
at Western Port, I hope your lordship will be pleased to take my
services into your lordship's kind consideration, and extend the
grant already made by an additional grant at Western
Port.</blockquote>

<p>The following letter appears in the "Sydney Monitor", December
15th, 1826; but Hume says nothing in it to indicate any change of
opinion as to which of the two ports his expedition had
reached.</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">"<i>To the Editor of the
'Monitor</i>.'</p>
<blockquote>"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;On perusing one of the
numbers of the 'Monitor' a few days ago, I noticed the comments
of 'An English Emigrant', respecting Hume River, the Gulf of St.
Vincent, and several other bays and harbours on the coast I now
beg leave, Mr. Editor, to say that, in my opinion, I have
performed journeys enough. It is true some persons have profited
by my excursions into the interior; but in general terms, I
cannot say that I have. In the year 1814, in company with my
brother, <i>I discovered that tract of country</i> now called
Argyle. I was also there in the years 1815 and 1816, and in the
year 1817 I accompanied Mr. Thorsley and the late Mr. Meehan; Mr.
Meehan and myself discovered that beautiful lake, now called
'Lake Bathurst', and 'Goulburn Downs.' Some time afterwards I
conducted Mr. Thorsby and Mr. William M'Arthur to the same part
of the country. In 1819, I was with Mr. Meehan on a tour along
the coast from the Five Islands, and from thence across the Bong
Bong; and, in 1821, I went in the Government cutter
<i>Snapper</i>, in company with Mr. Berry and Mr. Johnstone, on a
survey along the coast as far as Mount Dromedary. It was my
intention to have set out on a tour last summer for the purpose
of tracing either Goulburn or Hume River, being of opinion those
rivers certainly must have an outlet on some part of the western
coast; but the expense of fitting out those expeditions are more
than my circumstances will allow, and on that account I
relinquished the idea.<br>
<br>
"I am still strongly of opinion that those streams, at some
future period, will prove to be the source of some occidental
rivers yet known; it was also the opinion of our late Governor,
Sir Thomas Brisbane, that some of the streams crossed by Mr.
Hovell and myself, on our journey in 1824 to Bass's Straits,
emptied themselves into the Gulf of St. Vincent's or thereabouts;
and the last time I had the honour of seeing Sir Thomas, he
expressed a wish that some person would endeavour to ascertain
what really became of the waters running westward beyond the
Murrumbidjee, and between that river and Bass's Straits. Hume
River is in latitude 36&deg; 20' and is distant from the eastern
coast (Barmouth Creek) in a due east and west line 150 miles.
There is probably four times the quantity of water running in the
Hume that there is in the Murrumbidjee or Lachlan rivers.<br>
<br>
"Goulburn River is in latitude 37&deg; 15', and distant from
Wilson's Promontory in a northerly direction about 100 miles; its
course is north-west. The distance from the Goulburn to Port
Phillip does not exceed eighty or ninety miles. Persons going
across by land from Bass's Straits would find these rivers much
easier crossed by keeping on the eastern side of the Snowy or
White Mountains, but the country in this direction is much higher
and more broken than it is on the western side.               I
am, Sir,</blockquote>

         <br>
<small>"HAMILTON HUME.</small>   </p>
<blockquote>"<i>Appin, November</i> 26<i>th</i>,
1826."</blockquote>
<p>Two maps, bound up with Governor Arthur's
despatch&mdash;hereafter given&mdash;on the subject of Batman's
expedition to Port Phillip, and each having inscribed upon it the
words, "In Col. Arthur's No. 53 of 4 July, 1835", are of
considerable importance, from the light they throw upon facts
connected with early discoveries at Port Phillip. The one
immediately concerning us purports to be the chart of the route
of Hume and Hovell's expedition; and, if it were made at the time
of their arrival at the coast, would quite decide the question
whether the explorers were then certain they had reached Port
Phillip or Western Port,&mdash;the two harbours being distinctly
though roughly sketched, and the line of route being clearly
drawn to the former. Hume's letter of January 24th, 1825, can
only be reconciled with this chart upon the assumption that the
coast was delineated on it at a subsequent time. The whole
country inland, except in the immediate vicinity of the sea, must
have been marked from observations made during the expedition;
for no other explorers had been across the territory from the
date when Hume and Hovell traversed it to the time of Col.
Arthur's despatch. The coast-line of the map was, therefore, most
probably completed, or corrected, on the return of the party to
Sydney, where documents and individuals with the best information
on the subject could be consulted, or on subsequent knowledge,
making it certain that Port Phillip was the harbour reached.</p>
<p>It has been suggested to the author that when Hume speaks in
his first letters of his journey overland to Western Port, he
applies the name to the surrounding country, in the same way as
the present Colony was afterwards called Port Phillip. Such an
explanation, however, will not stand consideration; for had the
idea in Hume's mind, when he wrote the letter of January 24th,
1825, been that he had reached the shores of Port Phillip Bay in
the Western Port District, he would not have omitted all mention
of the name of the harbour to which he believed he had been. That
name was as well known as that of the other port, and was just as
likely to be attached to the district, as it afterwards was.
Besides, when Hume speaks of a stream which he calls the Tweed,
as "the river that falls into Western Port", there seems little
room for doubt that he had the harbour itself in his mind, not a
tract of country. The name of the Tweed neither appears in the
map of the route to which we have referred, nor in the journal of
the expedition which we shall presently notice; so that it
evidently was a name only temporarily applied, which disappeared
when Hume revised the map and description of his journal, on
being convinced that the bay at which his expedition had arrived
must have been Port Phillip. The Tweed was probably the Werribee,
or perhaps the Saltwater River.</p>
<p>Following the route on the map backwards from the
coast,&mdash;we find Western Port with its islands, the outer one
distinctly marked, and the nearer one not clearly shown to be
either an island or peninsula. This is some evidence that the
chart was made before the expedition of Captain Wright had
completely investigated the locality. The words "Port Phillip
called by the natives 'Jillong'," are written upon the bay, the
shores of which, from about the position of Brighton to
Williamstown, are not defined. Close to where Geelong now stands,
the line of route terminates at what is marked as a long narrow
arm of the bay, like the mouth of a river. At, and a little
before, the termination of the route are three marks, thus
explained in a note on the chart:&mdash;"The red crosses (* *)
note the situation of trees marked thus (H H), and the spot where
peach-stones and clover-seed were planted."</p>
<p>The coast appears to have been first struck a little to the
S.E. of some hills called "Three Brothers", which may be taken
for the Anakies, but that there are no others in the place of
Station Peak, unless these most conspicuous of hills are intended
to be indicated, a little to the east, by two or three
faintly-marked and unnamed elevations. Between two of them
Arndell's River runs. Just to the west of one of these latter
hills, and shortly after the river is crossed, the words "Saw the
harbour" are written on the route; which then turns a little
north-east, when the stream called Arndell's River is crossed by
it, and a short distance further on the Exe. The former rather
corresponds with the position of the Werribee, and the latter of
the Saltwater River. To the north of the "Three Brothers",
"Brisbane's Range" is given, fronted by two peaks called
Arndell's Crown and Mount Moina. The Exe is described as having
"high rocky banks". Further inland, the outward route indicates
the entanglement of the explorers among the ranges of Mount
Disappointment, beyond which we find "Twisden River sixty yards
wide," then "King's River, very fine country," a little further,
"Ovens R., ten yards wide," and then the two branches of the Hume
are crossed by the expedition. On the north bank of the latter,
the line of route runs down some distance to a point where "100
yards wide" is marked. The red line of the outward track is
continued across the Medway, and the Murrumbidgee, which is
marked "forty or fifty yards wide". It then runs over Yass Plain
past Hume's station, on a branch of the Lachlan, and terminates
on the shores of Lake George.</p>
<p>"Brisbane's Range" is about due west of Mount Disappointment;
further north between the two is Mount Byron; to the N.W. are
Mounts Romulus and Remus, N.E. of which is Meehan's Peak. To the
east of the route is Mount Bon View, south of Mount
Disappointment, then Dampier's Range, between the Twisden and
King's Rivers, and in the distance the "Australian Alps, covered
with snow". Other ranges are marked, but without names.</p>
<p>Upon one corner of the chart the following is
written:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Mr. Hume's sketch of a tour performed by Mr. W.H.
Hovell and himself from Lake George to Port Phillip, Bass's
Straits (at their own expense), in the years 1824 and 1825,
through the request of Sir Thos. Brisbane.<br>
<br>
"The Hume was the largest river met with; it is from 80 to 100
yards wide, and generally deep; its waters run from two to three
miles an hour. The banks are low and subject to inundation for a
considerable distance, and the land is of the best quality. There
are numerous lagoons extending back from the river one or 2
miles. These, as also the river, abound with fish of 2 kinds, the
cod of the Lachlan and the fish resembling the tench. The black
swan and most kinds of water fowl are plentiful. It is difficult
to approach the river a little below the point at which the party
first made it, in consequence of the backwater. The timber in the
neighbourhood is in general eucalyptus, skirted with box and
stringy bark.<br>
<br>
"It is remarkable that no eels or perch were seen (and after
passing Goldburn Plains) in any of the waters until we reached
the River Exe south of Mount Disappointment. The country, the
whole of the way from Lake George to Bass's Straits, is well
covered with grass."</blockquote>
<p>In another part of the map is this observation:&mdash;"The
tourists found in their way back that most of the high lands east
of the Twisden, so far as the Hume, terminate abruptly in a flat
country. To the north and north-west the horizon is unbroken." On
an area of country east of the Exe is inscribed&mdash;"Extensive
and undulating downs of alternate wood and plain, called by the
natives Iramoo."</p>
<p>The longitude marked at Port Phillip Heads is 144&deg; 37' E.,
and the latitude 38&deg; 20' S.</p>
<p>We are not without valuable independent evidence that, for
some time after their return, both explorers believed they had
struck the coast at Western Port, and that it was only on the
account of their journey being compared with other descriptions
of the southern coast, either of them, or more probably some
critics at Sydney, first suggested, that it was Port Phillip at
which they had arrived. Had Hume been of that opinion at the time
referred to, the fact would have been too remarkable to have
escaped mention in the following letter written to Mr. Sec. Hay
by Lieut. Stirling, who seems to have recently arrived from New
South Wales. It bears date Pirbright Lodge, near Guildford,
December 30th, 1826:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"<small>MY DEAR SIR</small>,&mdash;I beg to
acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th inst. to-day,
and have now the honour to reply to it.<br>
<br>
"The circumstances of the expedition to which you therein allude
were, to the best of my recollection, as follows:&mdash;About the
month of June of last year, two respectable settlers (Mr. Hovell,
formerly the commander of a merchant ship, and Mr. Hume, lately
settled in the Colony) waited upon Sir Thomas Brisbane to
announce their intention of exploring their way from the county
of Argyle in a direction S.S.W., so as at 4-500 miles to
intersect the southern coast of New South Wales; and that they
were willing to take all expenses upon themselves. Having
received the Governor's sanction, they set out, taking with them
provisions for six weeks, pack-horses, and servants. In the
course of their march they appear to have met few adventures
except the difficulties they encountered in crossing some high
ridges of mountains and difficult streams of water, one of which
so much bore the appearance of a large river that they determined
to follow its course in a southerly direction. After some days'
journey this brought them to the coast, where the river debouched
into a small bay. Captain Ho veil, having kept an accurate
journal of each day's course and distance, connected by
occasional observations for the latitude, found this bay to agree
with the Western Port as marked on the chart.<br>
<br>
"On their return home another route was taken to verify their
preceding remarks on the nature of the soil and productions, the
general aspect of which resembled much the country to the
westward of the Blue Mountains in the neighbourhood of Bathurst,
being intersected with beautiful streams of water, and a soil
admirably adapted to the purposes of grazing, with occasional
patches rich enough for any cultivation. The mean temperature
appeared to them below the average of the latitude; this not only
on account of the general elevation of the country they
traversed, but seemed to be affected by a chain of mountains
which ran parallel to their course, which they describe as
covered with snow. This last fact is rather questioned, as quartz
mountains assume that white brilliant appearance when reflected
by the sun,&mdash;a matter that may seem trifling to those who
live in colder climates, but of great importance to those who are
likely to become residents there. Another doubt has arisen to
their statement, which is, that as Western Port was surveyed as
far back as Governor King's time, and reported to have no river
falling into it from the interior, that the part of the coast
they describe does not agree with the former accounts. Their
story, in all other respects, seems to be perfectly consistent
and satisfactory.<br>
<br>
"The benefits resulting from the discovery must be obvious in
holding out the prospect that many millions of acres extend in
that direction of New Holland, communicating with the sea by a
river supposed to be navigable and situated in a climate most
congenial to the European constitution.<br>
<br>
"Till lately it was always deemed conclusive that the whole of
the south coast of New South Wales could never be appropriated to
colonization, and every succeeding survey of that coast, since
the time of Captain Flinders, has tended to strengthen that
opinion, which supposition has been removed by the journeys of

<p>In 1855 Hume published in Sydney, "A Brief Statement of
Facts",*** in which are recorded the circumstances connected with
the inception of the expedition. The Governor wished Hume and
party to be landed near Cape Howe or Wilson's Promontory, and to
travel overland; but, on the explorer refusing to take this
route, it was arranged that the journey should be altogether
performed by land. Three of the men, Thomas Boyd, William
Bollard, and Thomas Smith, were Hovell's servants, and Claude
Bossawa, Henry Angel, and James Fitzpatrick, Hume's. Boyd was the
man who swam the Murrumbidgee with him, when they carried the
line across in their teeth. The pamphlet is, for the most part,
devoted to the unhappy differences between the leaders of the
expedition; but, as these affect the main facts of the journey
only in one particular, it is better that they should be allowed
to slumber.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** The full title is "A Brief Statement of
Facts in Connexion with an Overland Expedition from Lake George
to Port Phillip in 1824. By Hamilton Hume. Edited by the Rev. Wm.
Ross, Goulburn."]</p>
<p>On the question whether the explorers believed, at the time,
that they had reached Port Phillip or Western Port, Hume
says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"On the 16th December, at four o'clock in the
afternoon, we made Port Phillip, ten or twelve miles to the
eastward of Geelong. We camped that night near the beach without
water.<br>
<br>
"On 17th December we reached the spot where the flourishing town
of Geelong now stands, encamping on the left bank of Kennedy's
Creek."</blockquote>
<p>Further on Hume says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"On our making the coast, Mr. Hovell's decided
impression was that we had reached Western Port, while my
conviction was that we had made Port Phillip, for during our
journey out, on the 14th December, when we sighted Willaumanater,
bearing forty or fifty miles S.W., I then made direct for it,
believing it to be, as it afterwards proved, the 'Station Peak'
of Flinders.<br>
<br>
"This singular mountain, as also 'Arthur's Seat', at Western
Port, had often been described to me by Mr. Surveyor Meehan, who
had been along that coast with Surveyor-General Grimes many years
before. He also told me that there were islands in Western Port,
but none in Port Phillip. I drew my inferences from this
information, and it proved correct."</blockquote>
<p>Quoting Dr. Lang's "Phillip Land," where it is stated that the
explorers "reached the western arm of Port Phillip, which they
mistook for Western Port," Hume appends the note, "I did
not."</p>
<p>The author must confess his inability to reconcile these
statements with Hume's letter of January 24th, 1825, to Governor
Brisbane.</p>
<p>In the same year, 1855, Hovell published a "Reply to a Brief
Statement of Facts," &amp;c., in which he sets out a letter to
the Governor, dated July 28th, 1824, respecting the preparations
for the expedition. He urges the fact that to this document his
signature is appended first, and Hume's second, in support of the
contention that the latter had acquiesced in his precedence.</p>
<p>Hovell also says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The only authentic narrative of the expedition of
Mr. Hume and myself, was first published in January, 1831, and a
second edition, with alterations and amendments, was published in
1837. This narrative was compiled by Dr. Bland, almost
exclusively from my field-book, which was kept by me regularly
day by day, and in which is noted down every occurrence worthy of
mention which befell us in our expedition."</blockquote>
<p>He further contends that, the Government having given so
little aid to the expedition, it was really a private enterprise
to which he contributed equally with Hume, and was therefore
entitled to, and as a matter of fact occupied, a position of
equality in its leadership. Four of the men&mdash;Boyd, Bossawa,
Angel, and Fitzpatrick&mdash;are stated, however, to have been
Hume's, Ho veil only claiming Samuel Bollard and Benjamin Smith
as his own. He says, "Mr. Hume had two horses, cart, and one
bullock, while I had four bullocks, cart, and one horse. Each of
us supplied an equal stock of provisions, and the men had slop
suits allotted to them by the Government." He alleges that it was
he, not his comrade, who named the River Hume,</p>
<p>Hovell further states that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"On the 16th December we made the place, where Mr.
Hume says the town of Geelong now stands. This is not the case,
it was what is called the Bird Rock Point, some 10 or 12 miles
from Geelong."</blockquote>
<p>As to the bay reached, Hovell says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"When we made the sea coast we both believed we had
arrived at the district of Western Port. We had been travelling
for that purpose, and whether we were right or wrong in our
conception of the true geography of our location, is a matter of
no importance; in fact we neither of us could know whether it was
Western Port or Port Phillip, and that Mr. Hume ever intimated in
any way that we were in Port Phillip is a fiction of his own
fancy."</blockquote>
<p>Hovell, although he seems to have clung for some time longer
than Hume to the opinion that they had been to Western Port,
appears to have adopted the more correct conclusion on visiting
that place with the expedition sent to establish a settlement
there at the close of 1826. In a letter to Mr. Hay of July 9th,
1833, Governor Darling states that the object of attaching Hovell
to the party was "to ascertain whether on the expedition Mr. Hume
and himself had come on the coast at Port Phillip or at Western
Port"; and in a long report to Governor Darling, dated Western
Port, March 27th, 1827, Hovell says, having "kept along the shore
and crossed Snapper River . . . . I set forward with my party
N.W. by W. for Port Phillip, where we arrived on the second day.
Continued along the sea coast till near the head of the Bay, and
having ascertained the spot which terminated the journey of Mr.
Hume and myself, returned, keeping a course about the centre of
the ridge which separates Western Port from Port Phillip."</p>
<p>This is by no means clear; but it seems most improbable that
Hovell should have gone as far as the Yarra without mentioning
that stream in his report, in which he describes the principal
features of the country. He must, therefore, have either been in
error in supposing he had ascertained the point reached by Hume
and himself, or, what seems impossible, they must have crossed
the Yarra some distance above Melbourne, and struck the coast not
far from where Brighton now stands.</p>
<p>In a memorial for an additional grant of land, forwarded by
Governor Darling in a despatch of April 24th, 1829, Hovell speaks
of the expedition in 1824-5 as "a journey undertaken under the
sanction of his Excellency Sir Thomas Brisbane, across a tract of
country deemed impracticable, to Port Phillip," Governor Darling
says that Hume "was considered the principal in the expedition"
of 1825. In a subsequent memorial on the same subject, dated
January 31st, 1833, Hovell states that he and Hume "bent their
course to Western Port, in Bass's Straits, the place where the
late Governor Darling made a settlement since abandoned. That an
account of their journey to Port Phillip which adjoins Western
Port and back again. . . . is contained in a small printed
pamphlet," a copy of which he refers to as forwarded with the
memorial. The publication is not to be found among the documents
in the Record Office, nor at the British Museum.</p>
<p>In a later memorial of February 1st, 1837, Hovell pledges his
"reputation as an old settler and traveller, that the Port
Phillip country, when put up to sale by public competition, will
add to the Colonial revenue at least one million sterling."</p>
<p>The following extracts are taken from a second edition of a
pamphlet published in Sydney in 1837,* and kindly lent to the
author by Mr. Michie, Agent-General for Victoria. The description
of the coast reached is of course made as correct as possible,
and, like the map previously referred to, leaves no doubt that
the locality was Port Phillip, although the explorers may, on
arriving at it, have taken it for Western Port.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Entitled "Journey of Discovery to Port
Phillip, New South Wales, in 1824 and 25. By W. H, Hovell and H.
Hume, Esquires."]</p>
<p>The "Journey" is in the form of a diary of the explorers,
edited by Dr. Bland. The narrative is given in the third person.
It thus begins:&mdash;</p>
<p>"<i>Saturday, October</i> 2, 1824.&mdash;Messrs. Hovell and
Hume, having met, as it lay in their route, at Mr. Hume's,
commenced their journey from Appin, in the County of Cumberland,
accompanied by six men, a couple of carts, containing their
supplies, drawn by four bullocks&mdash;and two horses together,
with one spare horse and a spare bullock; each of the men, as
well as themselves, was provided either with a musket or
fowling-piece.** At seven they stop for the night, opposite to a
point of land called Bird's-eye Corner, on the Cowpasture, or
Nepean, river.</p>
<p class="foot">[** In the appendix an inventory of equipment is
given. "The supplies were as follows:&mdash;Seven pack-saddles,
one riding-saddle, eight stand of arms, six pounds of gunpowder,
sixty rounds of hall cartridge, six suits of slops and six
blankets for the men, two tarpaulins, one tent, made of coarse
Colonial woollen cloth, twelve hundred pounds of flour, three
hundred and fifty pounds of pork, one hundred and seventy pounds
of sugar, thirty-eight pounds of tea and coffee, eight pounds of
tobacco for the men, sixteen pounds of soap, twenty pounds of
salt, cooking utensils, one false horizon, one sextant, three
pocket compasses, and one perambulator; exclusive of Messrs. Hume
and Hovell's own personal clothes and bedding, the latter
consisting, like that of the men, of a blanket only. Six of the
pack-saddles, the slops and blankets for the men, with six of the
muskets and the ball cartridges, tent, and tarpaulin, were
liberally furnished by the Government; and of which the muskets
only, the other articles having become destroyed or worn out in
the course of the journey, were returned."]</p>
<p align="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>
<p>"<i>Wednesday, October</i> 13.&mdash;Arrive at Mr. Hume's
station. Distance from Bird's-eye Corner one hundred and
twenty-three miles and a half, W.S.W." On the 14th they visit
Lake George, "to ascertain the bearings and distance of the lake
from Mr. Hume's station: the latitude of which is, by account,
34&deg; 48' S., and by double altitude, 34&deg; 51'. The
Longitude by account 149&deg; 21' E." The lake was "distant from
Mr. Hume's station about twelve miles."</p>
<p>Their final start into the unknown regions is thus
recorded:&mdash;</p>
<p>"<i>Sunday, October</i> 17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Leave Mr. Hume's
station (the last which is occupied by the Colonists) without a
guide; travel twelve miles, S. 60' W."</p>
<p>On the 18th they proceed towards Yass, over a range, one of
the elevations of which they name Mount Lookout, and ford the
Gondorroo branch of the Murrumbidgee. Next day they pass ten
miles to the south of Mount Brisbane, which they named the day
before, and crossing "Yarrh, Yass, or M'Dougall's Plains," at
three, reach the Murrumbidgee, which "is so swollen by the late
rains, that it appears utterly impassable, and it is evidently
rising." It "is from thirty to forty yards in breadth, the water
in most places level with the top of the banks. The rate of the
current at the place where they are to cross, between five and
six miles an hour."</p>
<p>Having halted during the 20th and 21st, the journal
records:&mdash;</p>
<p>"<i>Friday, October</i> 22.&mdash;No reduction of the waters,
nor apparent probability of any for the present. It is
determined, therefore, to make the attempt without further
delay&mdash;and whatever the risk of crossing the river: an
operation which is literally no sooner determined on than
effected. The body of a cart being substituted for a punt or boat
and the end of the tow-rope having been conveyed across the
river, in the course of four or five hours the whole of the
supplies, including the second cart, is landed, without loss or
injury, on the left bank of the Murrumbidgee. The horses and
bullocks are now conducted separately across the stream, though
not without considerable risk, by means of the tow-rope, and by
five o'clock. The weather during the early part of the day,
showery; towards evening, squalls, with heavy rain, at
intervals."</p>
<p>In a note to the above entry the details of the crossing are
more fully described. The green timber not being sufficiently
buoyant, and it not being the season of the year at which bark
could be peeled off the trees, a raft or boat could not be made.
One was, however, improvised out of one of the carts which was
stripped of its axle, wheels and shafts and covered with a
tarpaulin. "The next step," to give the words of the graphic
description, "was to convey the end of a stout rope to the
opposite bank, for the purpose of plying their boat backwards and
forwards across the stream; to effect which object, Mr. Hume with
one of the men, undertook the dangerous enterprise of swimming
across the river, taking with them a small line, of about six
feet long, which they carried between their teeth; and to the
bite or middle of which was attached a line of a similar
description, but of sufficient length to reach across the stream.
This was not done without great difficulty and some danger, both
from the rapidity of the torrent, and the great pressure of the
water on a length of line so considerable; the weight of the
latter not only retarding the progress of the swimmers, but at
times dragging them almost under the water, so that they were
swept down the river a considerable distance ere they could reach
the opposite bank. One of the ends of their intended tow-rope was
now conveyed across the river by means of the line, and by ten
o'clock, everything being in readiness, and the boat, carrying
not less than six or seven cwt., made its first trip. The
bullocks and horses were then conducted across separately, some
of the bullocks being in a state of almost complete submersion
during the operation, and one of them becoming turned upon its
back and continuing in this position a considerable part of the
passage. These difficulties were attributable partly to the
cattle not being accustomed to swimming, and partly to the
dangerous rapidity of the stream; which, with the roughness of
the weather, and the unusual coldness of the water, contributed
to render this undertaking, to the swimmers at least, not less
unpleasant than it was evidently hazardous."</p>
<p>After crossing the river their route for some time lay through
very mountainous country, so much so that on the 26th they were
obliged to leave the carts behind, and experienced considerable
difficulty in getting their cattle along.</p>
<p>November 3rd they cross a river, which they call the Medway,
after searching for a suitable ford, which is found at a place
where the stream is 150 feet wide. The explorers highly commend
the superiority of bullocks over horses in travelling over this
mountainous country.</p>
<p>On November 8th "their progress on the banks" of the stream
they were following "is arrested by the mountainous range forming
the southern barrier of the valley, and which, on each side of
it, rises precipitously out of the stream. Messrs Hovell and
Hume, having ascended close to the stream with some difficulty,
about half the height of this range, in order to be the better
enabled to decide as to their future operations, were suddenly
surprised by a sight to the utmost degree magnificent Mountains,
of a conoidal form, and of an apparently immense height, and some
of them covered about one-fourth of their height, with snow, were
now seen extending semicircularly from the S.E. to S.S.W. at the
supposed distance of about twenty miles. The sun was bright (it
was about ten or eleven in the forenoon), and gave them an
appearance the most brilliant. The mountains which they had
hitherto seen, compared with these stupendous elevations, were no
more than hillocks, from which, also their form, as well as their
other general characters rendered them not dissimilar. The men
had no sooner heard of this unexpected and interesting scene
than, catching the enthusiasm, they ran to the spot where the
travellers were standing, and were not less than themselves
surprised and delighted at this pre-eminently grand and beautiful
spectacle." In a note it is said that these are evidently part of
the "mountains that were seen by Major Ovens and Captain Currie
R.N. in their expedition to Men&eacute;roo in 1823." They are
called the South Australian Alps, "in contradistinction", as a
note explains, "to the Australian Alps, some mountains discovered
about this period, in the vicinity of Moreton Bay." The character
of country between them and these mountains leads the explorers
to proceed fifty or sixty miles to the west.</p>
<p>November 13th "they come into sight of a mount, bearing S. by
W. half W. distant about four miles, which, from its very
peculiar appearance, they name Battery Mount."</p>
<p>"<i>Tuesday, November</i> 16<i>th</i>.&mdash;Soon after
sunrise they recommenced their journey, and having proceeded
three miles and a half S. (the land gradually sloping as they
advanced), arrive suddenly on the banks of a fine river. This was
named 'The Hume.'" A note says, "Mr. Hume having first discovered
it"; and the explorers "had anticipated the early appearance of a
river in this direction, from the opinion that the large bodies
of water of late continually met with, though all pursuing a
southerly, or even easterly course, would, from the apparently
impenetrable barrier presented towards the east by the South
Australian Alps, ere long revert to the westward, and thus become
distributed to the interior." "The beautiful stream", so proceeds
the description, "is found to be not less than eighty yards in
breadth, apparently of considerable depth; the current about
three miles an hour; the water for so considerable a current
clear.</p>
<p>"The river itself is serpentine, the banks clothed with
verdure to the water's edge; their general heights various, but
seldom either more or less than eight or nine feet; inclined or
precipitous as they happen, by the bendings of the stream, to be
more or less exposed to the action of the current. On each side
of the river is a perpetual succession of lagoons, extending
generally in length from one to two miles, and about a quarter of
a mile in breadth. These, which are situate alternately on each
side of the river, within those elbows and projections which are
formed by its windings, often for miles together, preclude any
approach to its banks." Thus was the Murray first seen and
described.</p>
<p>"Unable to devise any means of crossing the river, and in hope
of discovering some practicable ford, they now commence their
progress (west) down the stream"; but without success. Next day,
17th, Hovell and Hume with two men proceed seven miles further
down, but are only able twice to approach the river for the
lagoons. They return to their starting-point, and on the 18th
proceed seven miles up the stream, to the point where they first
discovered it, beyond which they go about three miles. On the
19th "they resume their route up the river (E.)", and proceed
through a very good country. "About six miles from the place of
their starting this morning, they observe a small ait or islet of
rock, lying nearly in the middle of the river; this is composed
of a coarse granite, and lies in perpendicular ridges, N.E. and
S.W. Four miles east from this spot, at the foot of a high forest
range, the stream suddenly narrows, and is in some places reduced
to the breadth of little more than forty yards. This was
attributed to their probable advance beyond the junction of some
important branch, that might have been passed unnoticed,
considering the distance from the river at which they were
frequently compelled to travel. Here, having determined on making
the attempt to cross at this spot, they halt for the night.</p>
<p>"<i>Saturday, November</i> 20.&mdash;Weather fine; this
morning they cross the river: this they effect by means of a
temporary boat, hastily constructed (of wicker, covered with
tarpauling) for the occasion, and by four in the afternoon,
everything, including the cattle, had been landed on the opposite
bank."</p>
<p>Thus was the Murray first crossed, and Victoria once more
trodden by the feet of white men.</p>
<p>On Sunday, November 21, they start at an unusually early hour,
"when, having travelled one mile and a half (four from the last
stream) among the usual series of lagoon and swamp and creek,
they arrive on the banks of a sixth river. The breadth of this,
at the water's edge, was one hundred and ten feet, and the
current as strong as that of the former stream, but not so
deep&mdash;the cattle, therefore, crossed with little difficulty,
though it was necessary to construct a boat for the supplies. By
noon, they had passed the river, when, after extricating
themselves from the usual series of creek, lagoon, and swamp,
they resume their route." Four or five miles further on they
arrive at the banks of another river "similar in size and other
respects to the former." On the 22nd they cross it, "availing
themselves of an immense tree that lay extended from bank to
bank, and which, with a rope stretched along it as a hand-rope,
formed a tolerably good bridge. . . . By half-past eight they had
completed the passage of the river."</p>
<p>On Wednesday, November 24th, "they arrive at the north or
right bank of another (the eighth) river "which they name "the
'Ovens', after the deceased Major Ovens, the late Governor, Sir
Thomas Brisbane's Private Secretary." It is crossed without
difficulty. On the same day, they observe one of the snow-capped
Alpine mountains about twenty miles S.E., and call a
singularly-formed mountain near to them, from its shape, Mount
Buffalo. On the 26th they cross Oxley's Creek. From a high hill,
which they name Mount Bellevue, they observe an extensive plain
bearing N. 10&deg; W., which they call "after Mr. Alexander Berry
of Sydney, one of the most zealous advisers of the journey,
'Berry's Plains.'"</p>
<p>On December 3rd they reach a river which they name "the
Hovell". A note explains, "Originally the Goulburn, after the
late Colonial Secretary. But as there was, though unknown at the
time to Messrs. Hume and Hovell, another stream named after that
gentleman, to prevent confusion this river was subsequently named
by Mr. Hume as above." Its banks were "at least twelve feet in
height, and perpendicular," and it "has appended to it the usual
series of creeks and lagoons." They complete the passage of the
Hovell on the 4th, having had to swim the cattle across. They
name two hills near the crossing-place Mount Thorsby and Mount
Meehan. Seven miles from the Hovell, they discover the "Muddy
Creek," and report that "a finer country for sheep cannot exist
than that in the vicinity of the Hovell."</p>
<p>The King-Parrot Creek is discovered December 7th, and they
soon get into the mountainous and wooded country, which compelled
them to alter their course after endeavouring to penetrate it. On
the 9th they ascend Mount Disappointment. The country from Muddy
Creek up to Mount Disappointment they name after the "late
Attorney-General, Bannister's Forest." They direct their course
on the 12th towards "a very remarkable forest hill", which they
call Mount Piper, and stop for the night on the banks of Sunday
Creek.</p>
<p>Next day they follow it up for seven miles, "when meeting a
practical ford they cross it." One range traversed they call the
Jullian; it appeared to divide the waters running north towards
the Hovell from those taking a southward direction towards the
sea. From Bland's Mount, "a high insulated hill, a view is
obtained of several extensive plains, reaching from west to
south-east, separated from each other by patches of forest land."
"Wherever the land in these plains rises a little above the
general level, it is stony," and "thinly scattered over with
honeysuckle". They ascend a hill which they call Mount Hodomoter,
because at it their perambulator was broken to pieces. Here
"alternate plains and forests are seen extending to the utmost
verge of the horizon, and from N.N.E. to S.E. part of the Alpine
Chain; while towards the South the land gradually dips. Nothing
could surpass the beauty of this view." They experience want of
water till halting in the evening at Relief Creek. On the 15th
they discover two or three creeks, one called Broughton Creek,
after which "they travel about twenty miles along a continued
plain (on which there was scarcely a tree) when they arrive on
the banks of another creek or river, considerably larger than
even the first."</p>
<p>Next morning, December 16th, Thursday, they cross the river or
creek without difficulty, Hume naming it "the Arndell, after the
late Dr. Arndell, the father of Mrs. Hovell. They now proceed
S.W. by S. through the plains about six miles, when they are
struck with an appearance, respecting which they cannot decide
whether it is that of burning grass or of distant water. They now
therefore having altered their course to south, at four o'clock,
have the gratification satisfactorily to determine, that the
appearance which has just created so much doubt, is that of the
latter object; and which, leaving the river a short distance, and
directing their march from S.W. to S.S.W., they soon ascertain to
be part of the sea&mdash;the so long and ardently desired bourn
of their labours. They now again alter their course to
south-west, and travel six miles in that direction along the
shore, over excellent land, but clear of timber." "Several flocks
of emus and wild turkeys" were seen, but seldom kangaroo; "the
water near the shore was covered with wild fowl", from which they
"procured an ample supply of black swans and ducks. They stopped
for the night at seven o'clock in a small wood about a mile from
the beach, but where there was no fresh water, having travelled
to-day, they supposed, upwards of twenty miles."</p>
<p>On the 17th, "they proceed this morning from the beach, in a
direction about N.N.W. three or four miles in quest of water,
when they arrive on the banks of a creek, where they had the good
fortune to find abundance, both of good water and of grass." A
note says of the creek, "Or at present a chain of ponds,
commencing at Mount Woolstonecroft; and terminating after a
course of seven or eight miles in the sea. This they name
'Kennedy's Creek.'"</p>
<p>The following note is given further on to illustrate native
names&mdash;Mount Woolstonecroft is identified with Vilaminarter
or Station Peak&mdash;"The name of the bay <i>Geelong</i>: Mount
Wollstoncroft, Woolloomanata; the Downs extending to the Beach
Iraumoo" &amp;c. During the day they met with some of the
natives, who, showing themselves disposed to be aggressive,
Messrs. Hume and Hovell abandoned their intention of leaving
their party to ride over the country to the westward.</p>
<p>"The harbour, or bay, consists of an immense sheet of water,
its greatest length extending east and west, with land which had
the appearance of an island, to the southward, lying across its
mouth, but which, in fact, is a peninsula with a very low isthmus
connecting it to the western shore."</p>
<p>As to the peculiar features of the country,&mdash;the
explorers make some remarks respecting the deficiency of timber
for building, and the ridges of stones on the plains.</p>
<p>"<i>Saturday, December</i> 18.&mdash;This morning they
commence their return, keeping between two and three miles to the
south-east of their outward route; at four, having travelled
about fifteen miles, they halt on the banks of a large creek
taking its rise in Mount Wollstonecroft."</p>
<p>A note informs us that, before starting, they "took down the
following bearings, from the extremity of a low neck of land
extending a considerable distance into the bay, on the left side
of the entrance into the creek, viz., a low isthmus south by
east, distant about fifteen miles. A bold bluff bank, part of the
peninsula, forming the southern border of Port Phillip, distant
about ten or twelve miles South East. High land, distant between
twenty and thirty miles S. 45' W., 'Mount M'Intosh', named after
our late barrack-master, N. 76' E.; and 'Mount Campbell', after
the late Mr. W, Campbell, of Harrington Park, N. 85' E., distant
between thirty and forty miles; 'Mount Wollstonecroft', named
after the late Mr. E. Wollstonecroft, of Sydney, N. 25' W. seven
miles; 'Mount Berry', named after Mr. Alexander Berry, north-west
fifteen miles; and finally, the Jullian Range, extending in the
form of a crescent, from north-east to north-west, distant at its
nearest point, about seventeen miles."</p>
<p>On the 19th "they re-cross the Arndell a short distance below
the spot at which they first met with it"; and on the 20th cross
Broughton's Creek, the banks of which "are in general, steep and
lofty, in some places from 50 to 150 feet high"; next day cross
Bland's Plains. On 22nd, "they re-cross the Jullian Range by the
same pass by which they had entered the downs on the 13th." A
note describes it as "Hume's Pass. This lies between two
remarkable hills Mount Disappointment to the eastward, and
another, named 'Mount Wentworth', after the late Mr. Wentworth,
of Sydney, to the westward, about equadistant (ten or twelve
miles) from each. The whole of their route, from Port Phillip
thus far, has been over fine land, consisting of plains and
downs, fit for every purpose of grazing and agriculture."</p>
<p>The 24th and Christmas Day are "spent on the banks of the
Hovell, in order that they might avail themselves of the fine
fish which abound in its waters, as well as refresh the cattle. .
. . They obtained from a hill a fine view of the river, flowing
from the north-east through a gap in a mountain range, distant
about eight or ten miles, when, after making a considerable curve
to the west, it eventually turned to the north-west."</p>
<p>On the last day of 1824, "just before sunset they cross the
Ovens," and January 2nd, 1825, "that branch of the Hume which
they had first passed on the 22nd of November"; on the 3rd "that
branch of this river which they first met with on the 21st
November. The Hume, as well as this tributary stream, was now so
low that they were both easily fordable&mdash;their waters not
exceeding, at their respective fords, three or four feet in
depth."</p>
<p>They now hastened forward as rapidly as the exhausted
condition of their beasts, and the reduced quantity of their
supplies would permit. On New Year's Day it is stated, in a note,
that "except a couple of kangaroos and a few chance fish, animal
food of any description they had not tasted since the 25th of
last month."</p>
<p>On the 16th January "Hume and Hovell with two men hurry
onwards to the carts which they had left with part of their
supplies on the 26th October," which they found precisely as they
had left them.</p>
<p>January 18th, 1825, "they arrive in safety at Mr. Hume's
station, near Lake George, from which they had taken their
departure on their outward journey, the 17th October," having
performed their journey "within the short period of sixteen
weeks.</p>
<p>"From this place they despatch the necessary supplies for the
men whom they left behind them on the 16th, and on the 24th each
of them arrives at his respective home."</p>

<h4>WRIGHT AND WETHERALL's ATTEMPTED SETTLEMENT AT WESTERN PORT
IN 1826-27.</h4>
<p class="negindent">Reason for making
settlement&mdash;Correspondence between Governor Darling and
Colonial Office&mdash;Designs of the French
apprehended&mdash;Letters of Captains Wetherall and
Wright&mdash;Their description of Western Port and the
settlement&mdash;Governor Darling's unfavourable opinion of
place&mdash;Hovell's explorations and report&mdash;Governor
Darling assigns latter as reason for recalling
expedition&mdash;Different view taken at Colonial
Office&mdash;Settlement abandoned notwithstanding.</p>
<p>I<small>N</small> December, 1826, a second attempt was made to
found a settlement on the soil of Victoria, at the same time that
the expedition was despatched from Sydney to establish one at
King George's Sound; and for the same reason. It was thought that
the French entertained designs of colonizing Western Port and the
West Coast of Australia; and the British Government, with a
vigilance which history will commend, determined if possible to
prevent Australia from being divided among different races, and
the security of the British communities planted in that country
from being impaired by the presence of neighbours who might prove
undesirable. Had such a wise policy been more recently followed,
some positions of importance to the Empire would not have been
allowed to slip out of our hands, and others would not now remain
open for foreign nations to occupy. It must for ever be
remembered to the credit of Lord John&mdash;now
Earl&mdash;Russell, that he was the minister who finally asserted
the British claim to the whole of Australia; for, on being asked
by the French Government what portions of the Island-Continent
Great Britain claimed, his answer was&mdash;the whole.</p>
<p>It was through the desire of the Colonial Office to adopt wise
precautions against foreign intrusion, that the short-lived
settlement of 1826-27 had its origin at Western Port.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* All the documents quoted in this Chapter exist
in the Record Office.]</p>
<p>In a letter to Lord Bathurst, of October 10th, 1826, Governor
Darling, referring to his lordship's despatches, "dated in March
last, with respect to establishing settlements at Western Port
and Shark's Bay, or King George's Sound," says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I shall not fail to carry into effect, with the
least possible delay, the instructions which your lordship has
been pleased to honour me with.<br>
<br>
"Conceiving Western Point as first claiming attention, I applied
to Mr. Oxley, the Surveyor-General, for any information, it might
be in his power to furnish with respect to it and your lordship
will perceive by the accompanying statement, that as far as he
can depend upon his recollection, Western Port does not hold out
any of those advantages which under ordinary circumstances would
induce a settlement at that place. I have also seen Messrs. Hume
and Hovell, the persons who explored the country from hence to
Western Port, alluded to in your lordship's despatch No. 16; and
I do myself the honour of enclosing for your lordship's
information, a copy of a letter which Mr. Hume addressed to Sir
Thomas Brisbane on his return. It does not however appear that
any information was afforded, respecting the Port or its
eligibility as a settlement. I shall notwithstanding, send a
small expedition under Captain Wright of the Buffs, an officer
who appears to be well qualified for a service of this nature;
and as Captain Wetherall, of His Majesty's Ship <i>Fly</i>, has
very readily offered to proceed with his ship and give every
assistance which he can afford in establishing the
settlement."</blockquote>
<p>After explaining why Mr. Oxley does not accompany the
expedition, the letter proceeds,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"But I have accepted the offer of Mr. Hovell's
services, who is sanguine in the realization of the expectations
which he has formed of Western Port.<br>
<br>
"I have only further to state to your lordship, that I propose
equipping the Government Brig <i>Amity</i>, to convey the stores
and persons to be employed, and that I calculate on the
Expedition being ready to proceed in the course of a fortnight or
three weeks at the utmost.<br>
<br>
"Unfavourable as the prospect is, as to Western Port being likely
to become of importance as a place of trade, an idea which is
very generally entertained, and which, as is extremely desirable,
the projected expedition will confirm or correct, I am very
apprehensive King George's Sound will be found totally unfit for
the purposes even of a Penal Settlement."</blockquote>
<p align="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>
<p>The copy of Oxley's statement, sent with the despatch of
October 10th, 1826, is called "Substance of a Report delivered to
the late Governor King in January 1805 on Western Port," and
corresponds with that referred to in a previous chapter. It
begins by mentioning that Western Port was discovered by Bass in
1798, examined and surveyed by Captain Grant and Mr. Barrallier
in 1801, and that the northern shore was examined by Captain
Tuckey in 1804. Oxley concludes by remarking that this imperfect
account was, to the best of his recollection, the substance of
the previous one given by him to Governor King. He observes that
he had not since "had any opportunity to correct or verify the
impressions made on my mind by the observation I was then enabled
to make, and which as respecting the eligibility of Western Port
for a settlement might in some slight degree be influenced by the
situation of the parent Colony at the period, which did not admit
of the establishment of distant settlements, unless the natural
advantages they presented more than counterbalanced any
consideration of the expense attendant on the first formation of
our uninterrupted intercourse with head-quarters.</p>
<p align="right">"(Signed)         J. Oxley, <i>S.
General.</i>   </p>
<p>"<i>Sydney, October</i> 9<i>th</i>, 1826."</p>
<p>On October 9th, 1826, Governor Darling wrote thus to Mr. R.W.
Hay:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"In acknowledging Earl Bathurst's private letter of
the 1st March, on the subject of the New Settlements to be
established, as connected with the expected arrival of the French
discovery ships, I beg yon will assure his lordship, that every
attention shall be paid to the suggestions contained in his
letter, in any communication which may take place with the
officers in command, respecting the supposed object of their
voyage. I take the liberty at the same time to observe, that so
long as my Commission limits the western boundary of this
government to the 129&deg; of East Longitude, it will not be easy
to satisfy the French, if they are desirous of establishing
themselves here, that there is any valid objection to their doing
so on the Western Coast; and I therefore beg to suggest, that
this difficulty would be removed by substituting a Commission for
that which I at present hold, describing the whole Territory, as
within the government. If this should be adopted, it will be
desirable that the Commission should be forwarded without loss of
time. . . ."</blockquote>
<p>A despatch of November 24th, 1826, from Governor Darling to
Earl Bathurst, states that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"His Majesty's Ship <i>Fly</i>, with the Colonial
Brigs <i>Amity</i> and <i>Dragon</i>, sailed on the 9th of last
month for Western Port and King George's Sound.<br>
<br>
"The expedition for each of these places, consisted of two
officers and 18 rank and file, with 20 convicts who have been
sent for the purpose of assisting in establishing the
settlements. Six months' provisions for the use of the troops and
prisoners, after their landing, were embarked, with a proportion
of other necessary stores and supplies."</blockquote>
<p>The letter is accompanied by copies of the instructions to
Major Lockyer, of the King George's Sound expedition, and Captain
Wright of that to Western Port. These are both dated November
4th; so that it would appear that the statement of the despatch,
that the parties had sailed "the 9th of last month," is an
obvious error, as will also be seen by the Governor's letter of
December 4th, in which he speaks to Mr. Hay of the departure
having taken place "on the 9th of last month&mdash;" clearly
November. The instructions are of the ordinary kind, as to the
selection of sites for settlements, taking formal possession,
provisions, natives, communication with head-quarters, &amp;c.
Other instructions of the same date were given to the chiefs of
both expeditions. Those to Captain Wright are as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"As the French discovery ships which are understood
to have been preparing for these seas, may possibly have in view
the establishing a settlement on some part of the Coast of this
Territory, which has not yet been colonized by us, I think it
necessary to apprize you confidentially of what may possibly be
their object; and I am to desire, in the event of their touching
at Western Point, that you will be careful to regulate your
language and communications with the officers, so as to avoid any
expression of doubt of the whole of New Holland, being considered
within this Government, any division of it, which may be supposed
to exist, under the designation of New South Wales, being merely
ideal, and intended only with a view of distinguishing the more
settled part of the country.<br>
<br>
"Should this explanation not prove satisfactory, it will be
proper in that case, to refer them to this Government, for any
further information they may require. But should it so happen,
that the French have already arrived, you will, notwithstanding,
land the troops, agreeably to your instructions, and signify,
that their continuance with any view to establishing themselves
or colonization would be considered an unjustifiable intrusion on
His Britannic Majesty's Possessions, and you will warn them
immediately to desist from any such attempt, as their
perseverance must be attended with unpleasant consequences and
might interrupt that harmony which it is so desirable should be
preserved inviolate between the two countries.<br>
<br>
"You will of course, in either of the events pointed out, inform
me immediately of the result of your
communications."</blockquote>
<p>In his despatch of November 24th, transmitting the above to
Earl Bathurst, the Governor says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Your lordship will observe the explanation which I
directed might be given, should any information be necessary with
respect to the Western Boundary of this Government; though, the
published maps are marked through the centre from the North to
the South, and my commission adopts that line as the Western
Boundary, it would be difficult to contend or to satisfy any
nation desirous of making a settlement on the Western Coast, that
we have an indisputable right to the sovereignty of the whole
Territory.<br>
<br>
"I therefore beg to repeat the suggestions contained in my
private letter to Mr. Hay, dated the 9th October, that I may
receive a Commission, describing the whole territory as within
this Government.<br>
<br>
"If generally known that we had actually assumed the sovereignty
and were proceeding to settle the Western Coast, it might
possibly tend to prevent the interference of any Foreign Power
and might set the matter at rest."</blockquote>
<p>In a despatch of December 4th, 1826, to Mr. Hay, Governor
Darling says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The expeditions for Western Port and King George's
Sound sailed hence the 9th last month, and the French Corvette,
<i>L'Astrolabe</i>, discovery ship, arrived here on the 2nd inst.
I find she touched on her way out, both at King George's Sound
and Western Port, having remained six days at the latter; but
Captain D'Urville would lead me to believe that the object of his
Expedition is solely for the purposes of science. He has applied
to me for Stores, which will be supplied, and for assistance in
refitting his ship. He has intimated his intention, as soon as
this is accomplished, of proceeding to New Zealand; and I should
not be surprised to find that the French have some intention of
establishing themselves there, from the wish he affected to
express, that we had, or surprise that we had not, made a
settlement at those Islands. It is perhaps a fortunate event,
that he has found His Majesty's ships <i>Warspite</i>,
<i>Success</i> and <i>Volage</i> lying here, knowing at the same
time that the <i>Fly</i> has sailed with the Expedition to the
Southward, as he may in consequence, be more circumspect in his
proceedings, than he otherwise would have been."</blockquote>
<p>In the "Sydney Monitor" of December 15th, 1826, is the
following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The description of Western Port and its localities,
given by some men who have been brought from thence by the
Corvette <i>L'Astrolabe</i>, is extremely interesting. These men
had been left there by a sealing vessel about ten months since,
for the purpose of prosecuting the ostensible object of their
voyage, but the master of the vessel never returned for
them,&mdash;destitute of provisions other than what Nature in her
wildest state afforded them, they were on terms of friendly
intimacy with the natives, whom they represent to have been
amiable in their dispositions, and their outward appearance
prepossessing; as are the natives of the interior generally and
for the most part much stouter than those about Sydney, Liverpool
&amp;c. In height they do not differ greatly, but are on the
whole a fine muscular and well proportioned race of men,
itinerant in their habits as usual, and dependant solely on
uncultivated nature. The soil is represented as good; the timber
was not so thick as in these parts, and a gentle undulation of
hill and dale extends for several miles from the coast. A fine
and capacious Harbour, with abundant springs, are the leading
features which it should appear characterize the site of the
intended Settlement."</blockquote>
<p>Governor Darling writes to Lord Bathurst, February 4th, 1827,
informing him of the return of H.M.'s ship <i>Fly</i>, and the
brig <i>Dragon</i> from Western Port, where a settlement was
established on the 12th December, two miles to the eastward of
Red Point, which is situated on the eastern shore of the port.
With the despatch the Governor transmits copies of the reports
"received from Captain Wetherall of the <i>Fly</i> and Captain
Wright of the Buffs, containing details of their respective
proceedings and observations with sketches of Western Port as
referred to in their respective reports."</p>
<p>The following copy of Captain Wetherall's despatch to Governor
Darling accompanies that of the latter to the Secretary of State.
It is headed "His Majesty's Ship <i>Fly</i> Western Port (Bass's
Straits) December 27th, 1826."</p>
<blockquote>"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;The <i>Dragon</i> being on
the point of sailing for Sydney, I do myself the honor of
reporting, for your Excellency's information, my arrival at this
Port, which, in consequence of adverse winds and tempestuous
weather, did not take place till the 24th of November.<br>
<br>
"We parted company with the <i>Amity</i> off Kent's Group on the
19th during a heavy gale of wind from the westward; and I fear
her passage to King George's Sound will be tedious as we have had
the wind from that quarter, with little variation, ever since our
arrival.<br>
<br>
"The <i>Dragon</i> in consequence of her bad sailing, parted
company two days after our leaving Sydney, and took shelter in
Twofold Bay, and under Wilson's Promontory, during the westerly
gales, by which means the horses and Government stock suffered
little and were landed here in good condition.<br>
<br>
"I found here a party of sealers from Port Dalrymple, whose names
with that of the Boat in their possession I have the honor to
enclose. They have been living on Phillip Island near the
entrance of the harbour and have two acres of wheat and some
maize growing and looking well. They state that Coal is found in
great abundance on the Southern Coast of the island, but from the
general information given by them proving incorrect, I have
doubts on this important point; but your Excellency may rest
assured that no exertion on my part shall be wanting to ascertain
the fact.<br>
<br>
"I have the satisfaction of stating that the harbour is easy of
access and has no hidden danger and no less than 7 fathoms of
water in mid-channel to the anchorage which is safe and
commodious with good holding ground, well sheltered from the wind
and capable of containing any number of ships in the most perfect
security. The tides are rapid and rise from 8 to 11 feet being
influenced by the prevailing winds in the straits.<br>
<br>
"It is my intention to erect a flagstaff on the flat topt rock
off Point Grant marked A in the accompanying Chart (which I have
sent that your Excellency may clearly understand the points
referred to) to mark the entrance.<br>
<br>
"Deeming the situation of the anchorage of great importance, I
have cleared about four acres of the most commanding spot marked
B, erected a flagstaff, landed two six-pounders from the ship,
and took formal possession on the 3rd instant, by hoisting the
Union Jack, and firing a Royal Salute from the Battery, which I
have named Fort Dumaresq.<br>
<br>
"Wood is in abundance, and water can be obtained from a tide-well
in its vicinity, but not in sufficient quantities for the supply
of shipping.<br>
<br>
"The soil surrounding the fort is of the best description. I am
cutting a road across the Island and digging wells as I proceed
in the hope of finding water, or arriving on that point of the
coast where the coal is said to be found.<br>
<br>
"The Eastern entrance is narrow and intricate&mdash;a reef of
rocks extending nearly half way across from Phillip Island and
the opposite shore lined with heavy breakers. It is well adapted
for a fishing station (should that part of commerce offer
inducements for settlers of that description) and with the
prevailing westerly winds, would afford egress to small vessels
bound to the Eastward; but under any other circumstances would
not be safe to attempt. There is abundance of fresh water on this
part of the Island.<br>
<br>
"The Mainland from hence to Bass's river is hilly, of moderate
elevation, thinly timbered, soil rich, and well clothed with
luxuriant grass, but from the broken nature of the ground fit
only for grazing.<br>
<br>
"Bass's River cannot be approached even by Boats at low water;
owing to the extensive mud banks, which surround its entrance. It
is extremely winding in its course, and salt for 5 or 6 miles up
where it is joined by a fresh water rivulet, taking its rise from
an adjoining swamp.<br>
<br>
"The land on the right hand appears to be a salt water swamp
interspersed with a few elevated patches of rich meadow and
occasional rows of Tea tree. Salt water ponds are also numerous
in this space which appears to extend to the foot of the range of
hills running from the point of the mainland forming the Eastern
entrance a distance of three or four miles. About three miles
from the entrance on the left the land rises gradually and
assumes the most beautiful appearance. The trees are dispersed in
clamps over an extensive plain of rich meadows and I have every
reason to think from the report of some of my officers who have
made excursions in the direction of the settlement, that this
fine tract of country extends to that point, occupying a space of
at least 10,000 acres.<br>
<br>
"The idea of forming the settlement here was abandoned in
consequence of our finding no secure anchorage nearer than that
marked B, the intervening space being occupied by extensive mud
flats many of which are dry at low water; and although deep
channels are found between them and the possibility of getting
ships within a mile and a half of the entrance, would be attended
with little danger, the situation would be insecure from being
exposed in a westerly direction to an open space of sea for 18
miles; from which quarter the heavy gales of wind are
experienced.<br>
<br>
"The anchorage marked E near the settlement, where the
<i>Dragon</i> remained during her stay here, is well sheltered
and has good holding ground, the guns sent in her are mounted on
the point C ** commanding its entrance, where a flagstaff is also
erected. Nothing can surpass the beauty of the situation or
fertility of the soil on which the settlement is formed. Water is
plentiful, and by the judicious arrangements of Captain Wright
the provisions and stores are all landed and housed. Tents and
temporary huts are erected for the men and the more permanent
ones in a state of forwardness. An excellent garden is made, and
the seeds sown are above ground and looking well but I have no
doubt Captain Wright will fully report to your Excellency on this
subject.</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[** Nearest projecting point to French
Island.]</p>
<blockquote>"As I shall do myself the honor on my return to
Sydney of submitting to your Excellency a more minute description
of this Port it is unnecessary at present to describe the Coast
from the point marked D to Sandy Point on the Western Shore,***
further than to state, that it has been most minutely examined
and offers no inducement for the formation of a Settlement, no
safe anchorage being found, and all the Northern Coast consisting
of a continued swamp from which four small rivers, with deep
channels running with considerable velocity empty themselves into
the harbour, but are rendered inaccessible except to Boats at
&frac12; flood by the extensive shoals at their entrance. The
situations I have marked in the Chart.</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[*** That is the centre coast-line of the
mainland round French Island.]</p>
<blockquote>"A range of very high mountains appear to terminate
in a northerly direction; these are what Messrs. Hume and Hovell
call the Australian Alps, but from a very careful examination of
the Northern Shores of this Harbour and the character of the
country differing so materially from the account given by these
gentlemen, I feel confident, that the expedition undertaken by
them never could have reached Western Port.<br>
<br>
"The Timber consists of the Gum, Apple, Mimosa, Tea tree and
Honeysuckle, and excepting the latter is generally of an inferior
quality, but Mr. Hovell states that at a short distance from the
sea it is remarkably fine. He also mentions having discovered
coal of the best description near Cape Paterson, which is
situated a few miles to the Eastward, but no doubt your
Excellency will receive a communication from that gentleman on
the subject.<br>
<br>
"Of the climate I have every reason to speak in terms of praise,
not having had a man on the sick list since my arrival. The range
of the Thermometer on board the ship has been from 64&deg; to
82&deg; attaining the latter height only during the hot northerly
winds which we have twice experienced, and have in both cases
been succeeded by strong Southerly squalls accompanied by severe
thunder, lightning and rain. When the Thermometer has fallen to
67&deg; the average height at Noon has been 75&deg; and the
Barometer 30.22 inches.<br>
<br>
"The natives appear numerous but we have not been able to obtain
an interview, as they desert their camp and run into the woods on
our approach and watch our movements until we depart.<br>
<br>
"As I am aware it is your Excellency's wish to conciliate them as
much as possible I have not allowed them to be pursued or
molested in any way.<br>
<br>
"Kangaroos are in great abundance, herding together like deer.
Black swans, ducks, and teal are also numerous. Fish are not
abundant owing to the number of sharks, Dog fish, and stingray.
The sorts generally caught are mullet, whiting, sword fish, and
in one instance a large snapper. Gulls, Pelicans, Cranes and the
other varieties of sea fowl frequent the shores and lagoons.<br>
<br>
"We have killed a few brown snakes which are numerous. One of the
soldiers was bitten by one, but from having the part immediately
removed, he felt no inconvenience from it and has quite
recovered.<br>
<br>
"As my provisions will be nearly exhausted by the 20th of
January, I hope to be at Sydney by that time bringing your
Excellency such further information as my limited stay here, will
enable me to obtain.</blockquote>

(Signed)         <small>"F.A. WETHERALL."</small>   </p>
<p>On January 24th, 1827, Captain Wetherall writes to the
Governor from the <i>Fly</i>, Port Jackson, enclosing a report
respecting Western Port, of which he says, "The information it
contains is collected from the reports of the officers employed
in that service and as I personally examined every part of its
extensive shores, your Excellency may rest assured that no
object, however trifling, has escaped observation."</p>
<p>The report is most minute; its extent, thirty-eight large,
closely-written pages, precludes its insertion at length. Western
Port has certainly had more investigations and reports bestowed
upon it than any other part of the Colony. The principal facts,
which this report treats more in detail, are, however, given in
the letters of Wetherall and Wright. Referring to the landmarks
of Western Port, it is observed that there "is a probability of
mistaking Port Phillip for Western Port, which Captain Flinders
actually did, and the consequences might be serious, as many
sunken rocks lie at the entrance to the former. Our observations
gave the latitude of the mid channel"&mdash;Eastern
passage&mdash;"nearer the French account than the English, but as
the altitude of the sun was too great for an artificial horizon
with the sextant, there may possibly be some error arising from
the estimation of the dip. We consider it as lying in 38&deg; 35'
South, and the Longitude to be 145&deg; 8' East according to our
Chronometer, which does not differ materially from the position
assigned to it by Captain Flinders especially in Longitude the
most essential."</p>
<p>The following extract from the report cannot, however, be
omitted:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Having now concluded the remarks on the country and
harbour, I shall advert to the primary object of the expedition,
and its probable result, together with the principles which
regulated my conduct, as far as the naval department was
concerned.<br>
<br>
"In locating a colony, there evidently requires some foresight
and attention, in selecting the first site, as this must be
considered the nucleus, from which improvement and civilization
spread, and will remain for a time the centre of its trade and
resources. Any subsequent removal, after the first difficulties
are overcome, will give a severe shock to the whole, whatever
prospective advantages it may hold forth, and press most heavily
on those, who endured the hardships inseparable from a new
settlement. Impressed with these ideas, every part of the harbour
was twice most accurately examined, before a place was pitched
upon for landing the settlers &amp;c., and every contingent
advantage weighed as far as it was left optional, which I regret
to say was less frequent, than we expected. Four essential
particulars appear to me required to coincide in an undertaking
of this kind, where commerce is not the sole object in view,
viz.&mdash;A soil capable of maintaining the inhabitants, on a
place having free and open communication&mdash;with such, a safe
and convenient anchorage,&mdash;water sufficient for the supply
of the settlers, and their stock&mdash;and lastly, though
subordinate to these in the present case, a position capable of
military defence, when succour is so remote, and the chance of
having sometime to contend with an enemy, by no means improbable.
Applying these data to Western Port, it will be seen, from the
foregoing description, that there is scarcely a part of it, to
which some of them may not be urged as objections. The Islands,
though the scarcity of water might be overcome, and their
situation in many respects is by no means bad, yet, from the
interruptions of land carriage between them and the surrounding
country, must be at once set aside. The land near the Eastern
passage is unavailable in a commercial point of view, from the
intricacy of the harbour, and from thence to Red Point, the beach
is not only shoal, but exposed to a heavy sea in gales from the
westward owing to the great distance between it and Sandy Point.
The west branch offers nothing like shelter for large vessels and
as to laying in the open stream, it is totally out of the
question; for the swell which rises there when the wind blows
stormy from the Northward or Southward, is such as few ships
could ride to, and no boat live in. The defect is more sensibly
felt here, because there seemed to be a prospect of rendering
Port Philip, in some degree tributary to the establishment, from
the narrowness of Peninsula and the difficulty of entering that
harbour. Notwithstanding this powerful inducement it was soon
evident that the idea of settling there, must be abandoned. Of
the North Coast above French Island it is almost unnecessary to
say anything. It is very evident, that it is not the country
described by Messrs. Hume and Hovell, and that they could never
have been there as their accounts, are not applicable to a single
point, either of it, or the anchorage.<br>
<br>
"Under these untoward circumstances, we had nowhere but the East
branch of the harbour left to choose upon, and accordingly the
stores and live stock were disembarked, on the South side of the
small bay, before mentioned, and operations commenced for
clearing the land, and hutting the people. It has already been
stated, that the coast here is skirted by mud banks, dry at low
tide. This is indeed the sole drawback, and one, which I hope the
hand of industry will in part overcome, by means of the two
inlets, which nearly reach the shore. In every other respect, the
situation is unexceptionable, as the soil is good, easily
cleared, and has sufficient water in the driest season. The
narrow entrance at Bed Point renders it difficult to attack by
sea, nor would it be an easy matter to effect a landing, in the
face of opposition, anywhere between Bass's River, and the head
of the harbour.<br>
<br>
"While Captain Wright was employed in getting his people, and the
stores &amp;c. under cover, I directed a part of our men to clear
a piece of ground on Philip Island, with a view of establishing a
post for the protection of the roadstead, which was named Port
Dumaresq. A path was also cleared for upwards of three miles
towards the sea, but we had not leisure to finish it, as I
thought it necessary to cut and erect a flagstaff on the fort,
another on the small islet lying off Point Grant and a third on
Red Point, where we had also to get up the guns sent by the
Colonial Government. I wish, much it had been in my power to
erect a beacon on the shoal between Thistle and French Island,
and would strongly recommend this to be carried into effect, as
soon as possible. The west end of it is best fitted for this
purpose, but one at each extremity would be preferable.<br>
<br>
"As to the ulterior prospects of the Colony, I do not look upon
them in so unfavourable light, as the description would seem to
imply. There is abundance of good land to the Eastward, if we may
credit Mr. Hovell's last report; and I have not the slightest
doubt, that if the ridge across the settlement, stretches across
the low ground, a valuable tract will be found by following it,
between the swamp on the north side, and the mountains. I would
therefore suggest the propriety of ascertaining this important
point, which seems to rest upon a very natural inference. Besides
these, however, there are some other resources within its sphere.
The port itself will be an inducement to vessels coming through
the straits to call there or take refuge in bad weather. The
Eastern passage seems convenient as a fishing station, if the
neighbouring seas afford sufficient encouragement for that branch
of industry, and there are many places on the west side of the
harbour, well calculated for sheep pasture, though they did not
answer the purpose for which we examined them. Even the morasses
produce abundance of hay, where the underwood has been burned,
and might perhaps be brought to raise flax or hemp; as these
plants thrive in a wet soil. The good land I would recommend to
be apportioned out in small farms, as it is capable of raising
grain, crops and vegetables, for the immediate supply of the
inhabitants.<br>
<br>
"The natural productions of Western Port are nearly the same as
those about Sydney. The forest trees are species of the
Eucalyptus, Casuarina, Banksea, and Mimosa tribes; at least we
met with none else deserving notice. No specimen of the Huora
pine was found, nor is it probable from their limited station on
the other side of the straits, that they extend here; neither did
we observe the Cedars of New South Wales, as the temperature is
perhaps too severe.<br>
<br>
"The geological structure of the country is very simple. Cape
Wollamai is composed of a close grained red granite, with very
little mica, which appears to be of a durable nature. A bed of
old red sandstone rests upon it, from which we had a specimen of
fibrous brown coal sent us, and were informed there was a
considerable quantity in a place on the sea coast, which we had
not an opportunity of seeing. Above the sandstone there is
generally a stratum of loose black flinty slatestone and upon it
rests another of brown clay iron ore, of different degrees of
metallic value, but seldom exceeding a foot in thickness. We next
come to a bed of clay, sometimes blue sometimes whitish or
variously tinctured with iron, and having seams of brown ore
often traversing N.<br>
<br>
"Above this is the alluvial soil, from one to two feet and a half
deep, partaking of course of a clay nature, but occasionally
mixed with a large proportion of sand.<br>
<br>
"Of the climate too much cannot be said in favour; it certainly
appeared to us equal, either in point of temperature or
salubrity, to the finest we ever met with. It is less variable
than at Sydney, less desiccating, and the difference between
night and day not usually so remarkable. A number of our officers
and men slept in tents, on the newly cleared ground, and often on
the banks of rivers during our excursions, yet not a single case
of sickness occurred, beyond the usual casualties of a ship. What
is rather singular we had not one instance of intermittent
fever;&mdash;a result which could not have been anticipated in
England, or any of the southern parts of Europe, as seamen are
peculiarly susceptible of an impure atmosphere. The extreme range
of the Thermometer was from 61&deg; to 82&deg; the average
temperature of the midday 76&deg; (at 2 p.m.) and at the night
68&deg; The finest weather came with a South East wind, and the
stormiest from the westward. The North and N.W brought us the
only two hot land winds we expe- rienced, and the South and S.W
were generally gloomy, accompanied with rain.<br>
<br>
"We had an opportunity of establishing a friendly intercourse
with the natives, whom we accidentally met with near the first
river. They seem to be a timid inoffensive people, strongly
impressed with a sense of the superiority of our weapons, which
they appeared to have only known by report before they saw us;
and by no means deficient in intellect, we parted on good terms
and obtained a promise from them to visit the Settlement.<br>

<blockquote>"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;Agreeably to the
instructions of His Excellency the Governor in Chief dated 4th
November, 1826, I beg to report for his information, that I
embarked on board the Brig <i>Dragon</i>, and sailed in company
with His Majesty's ship <i>Fly</i>, Captain Wetherall, from
Sydney Cove on the morning of the 9th for Western Port, where we
arrived on the 24th of that month.<br>
<br>
"A sketch of the shore of Western Port, with the immediate
surrounding country, I have the honor herewith to transmit for
the purpose of rendering more intelligible the following detail
of my proceedings&mdash;<br>
<br>
"The <i>Dragon</i> remaining at anchor for three days off the
north shore of Philip Island, I several times landed on it during
that period and as far as I could observe the whole island
appeared overrun with thick Brush and small Timber, the soil
rather barren and sandy with the exception of a few acres on the
top of a small hill, which commands the anchorage, and in which
Captain Wetherall has since established a Battery&mdash;Fort
Dumaresq.<br>
<br>
"On the 28th November the <i>Dragon</i> proceeded to a small well
sheltered bay on the Eastern side of French Island, and anchored
in five fathoms water.<br>
<br>
"From this date I commenced my examination of the shores of the
Port, for the purpose of selecting an eligible side for a
Settlement as pointed out in my instructions&mdash;the route I
pursued is traced on the map in red ink. *</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Not in copy annexed to the despatches.]</p>
<blockquote>"Commencing at the 'Eastern Passage', a chain of
hills runs in a North East direction nearly parallel with Bass
river, and at a distance of about three miles from it. This chain
for six miles from the coast is thinly wooded, and well clothed
with grass&mdash;it then assumes a rugged and broken character
with thick impenetrable scrub&mdash;The country between the foot
of this range and Bass's River, is low and marshy, with the
exception of a few small spots of meadow land.<br>
<br>
"The entrance to Bass River is obstructed by a mud flat, dry at
low water, it is therefore navigable for boats only at half tide,
when it may be ascended about four miles; at a short distance
beyond this point, the stream is fresh but very
inconsiderable.<br>
<br>
"The northern Bank of the river down to within one mile of its
mouth is fine open meadow land, with patches of Tea tree
swamps&mdash;it bears however evident marks of being subject to
inundation.<br>
<br>
"The coast from the entrance of Bass River north is low and
marshy for two miles&mdash;the land then becomes elevated, with a
gentle declination to the East&mdash;Good forest land stretches
along the shore for four miles to a large fresh water lagoon,
from hence to 'Red Point' the Coast is bold and the soil of
poorer quality.<br>
<br>
"At 'Red Point' the coast takes an easterly direction, the soil
is of a superior description to any yet seen, lightly wooded and
grass luxuriant Two miles from Red Point there is a small stream
of fresh water, passing through rich meadows. Forest land is
again found for a mile further to the western head of 'Shoal
Bay', in the South East angle of this branch of the port.<br>
<br>
"The country to the East and North is covered with thick
impenetrable Brush nearly to the water's edge&mdash;a range of
low scrubby hills runs a short distance inland. Mud flats and
sand banks dry at low water, extend along the South and East
Coast, varying in breadth from one to three miles.<br>
<br>
"In consequence of the high and close Brush on shore, I was
occasionally under the necessity of continuing my examination by
boat at high water with a much better view of the interior.<br>
<br>
"About six miles in a northerly direction along the coast there
are several small lagoons. A mile further the land gently rises
to 'Red Head,' the western front of this hill is bold to the
coast&mdash;on its eastern side there are about three hundred
acres, of good forest land. Round a small bay to 'Tea Tree Point'
the shore is low and the interior which could be seen to a great
distance, is level and apparently marshy.<br>
<br>
"As the great mud flat which lies between the north shore and
French Island commences here I was induced to postpone the
examination of the north coast, as no eligible spot for a
settlement could be expected to be found on it.<br>
<br>
"In the examination of the Coast from 'Eastern Passage' to 'Tea
Tree Point' I was engaged from the 28th November, to the 5th of
December.<br>
<br>
"On the 7th December I proceeded by the south shore of French
Island across the Bay and landed on Sandy Point. Mud flats which
are dry at low water stretch along the Coast from this point to
the great mud bank on the North shore of French Island, rendering
the whole of this extent inaccessible except at high water.<br>
<br>
"Proceeded to the Northward to a bay in which is a small island,
and landed on the main, a salt water creek penetrates about a
mile into the country through swamps and Brush land. We dug a pit
for water, but the small quantity obtained was so strongly
impregnated with alum as to be unfit for use.<br>
<br>
"On the 8th December continued my examination of the Coast to the
entrance of a large salt lagoon at the northern extremity of this
branch of the Port, where I landed. The shore here is barren and
swampy. At flood tide proceeded to the eastward and entered on
the great mud flat&mdash;the main land on the north shore is
perfectly level with a trifling elevation above high water mark
to the base of a range of high mountains about twenty miles
distant.<br>
<br>
"Entered a salt creek on the north shore which penetrates about
two miles into the interior&mdash;the whole country here presents
an appearance of impassable swampy Brush with the exception of a
few acres of marshy meadow on its western Bank.<br>
<br>
"On the 9th of December I continued my course Eastward along a
low marshy mangrove shore for six miles to a fresh water stream
supplied from the immediate swamps, and from thence to 'Tea Tree
Point' without observing any improved feature in the country.<br>
<br>
"Having completed the whole line of 'Eastern Passage' to 'Sandy
Point' and having also circumnavigated French Island (which at
all points of view presents a surface studded with irregular
hills covered with small Timber and thick Brush) I returned to
the Brig.<br>
<br>
"On the 11th I accompanied Captain Wetherall to the stream of
fresh water I had observed two miles to the east of Red Point,
which we decided upon as the site of the Settlement, being the
only spot in. Western Port possessing the natural advantages
requisite, I took possession with the usual formalities on the
12th and immediately after commenced landing the stores.<br>
<br>
"As Red Point commands the anchorage off this settlement two guns
were mounted on it.<br>
<br>
"The landing of the stores being completed on the 26th December,
I dispatched the Brig <i>Dragon</i> to the anchorage of His
Majesty's ship <i>Fly</i> to await the order of Captain Wetherall
for returning to Sydney.<br>
<br>
"Every necessary provision having been made at the settlement for
the comfort of the men, and the security of the stores, I was
prepared to proceed to explore the neighbouring country to
examine the nature and quality of the soil, its fertility and the
purposes to which it might appear more immediately applicable
with reference to the views of settlers as directed by my
instructions.<br>
<br>
"From the nature of the North and East shores and the view of the
country within, which I had obtained to a considerable distance,
they offered no point by which it was possible to penetrate, my
only hope therefore was by tracing up Bass's River, and thereby
gaining a higher level, endeavoured to find a passage to the
interior.<br>
<br>
"For this purpose I proceeded on the morning of the third of
January in conjunction with Mr. Hovell to Bass's River, through
low meadows with Tea tree swamps. About three miles from the
Settlement we crossed a tract of marshy open country, and from
thence to Bass's River through meadows similar to those we had
already passed.<br>
<br>
"At daybreak on the 4th, we proceeded up the Northern Bank of
Bass's River (the Southern side being thick Scrub and Brush) for
two miles through rich meadows. As we advanced the meadow land
became marshy with numerous reedy swamps for a mile, when the
open country abruptly terminated. We however succeeded with
extreme difficulty in forcing our way for nearly three miles
through an almost impenetrable scrub&mdash;barren and swampy
ground&mdash;and had not the season been particularly dry, at
which it was attempted, it could not have been effected.<br>
<br>
"On reaching a small clump of stunted trees, we climbed the
highest of them, which commanded an extensive view&mdash;the
whole country to the East of a line passing from Shoal Bay to the
chain of mountains, on the South of Bass's River is of a similar
description to that we had already passed through with so much
difficulty as is also that to the North East for about fifteen
miles&mdash;the point by which I had hoped to penetrate into the
interior. I was thus reluctantly obliged to abandon the
attempt.<br>
<br>
"The very small quantity of good land in the neighbourhood of the
settlement that I have been able to discover, and the sterile,
swampy and impenetrable nature of the country surrounding Western
Port, to a great extent, lead me to believe that it does not
possess sufficient capabilities for colonization on a large
scale.<br>
<br>
"Having thus fulfilled as far as was practicable, the intentions
of the government, I considered my continuance at the settlement
altogether unnecessary,&mdash;I therefore delivered up my charge
agreeably to my instructions to my successor.</blockquote>

"Captain Buffs."   </p>
<p>Governor Darling, in his despatch of February 4th, enclosing
copies of the preceding documents to Lord Bathurst, says, "It
will be seen by Captain Wright's report, who was more immediately
charged with ascertaining the nature and capability of the
country, with a view to its fitness for colonization, as also by
Captain Wetherall's, that the local circumstances of Western Port
do not hold out any inducements to settlers. Extensive mud flats
prevent an approach to the shore except at high water&mdash;and
an impervious swampy Brush, or Scrub as it is termed, appears to
preclude all access to the interior of the country."</p>
<p>The last paragraph of Captain Wright's letter, speaking of the
limited capabilities of the country for colonization, is embodied
in the despatch, which then proceeds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"It only remains for me to state, that Mr. Hovell
having been left at the Settlement, with the horses and
establishment attached to him for the purpose of exploring the
country should it be found practicable, it will not be in my
power to form any opinion as to the advantage of retaining it,
until I am informed of the result of his proceedings. I beg to be
honored with your Lordship's commands whether in the event of his
not being able to open a passage to the interior of the country,
it is your Lordship's wish that the Settlement at Western Port
should be continued? The situation is not favourable for a penal
settlement."</blockquote>
<p>The despatch, which was received June 22nd, 1827, concludes
with high testimony to Captain Wetherall, who appeared to have
lost an opportunity of promotion while on this service.</p>
<p>The statement that "the local circumstances of Western Port do
not hold out any inducements to settlers" is, certainly, not
borne out by a perusal of the accounts of Wetherall and Wright,
cited in support of it.</p>
<p>The following is Captain Hovell's report to Governor Darling,
upon which the maintenance of the settlement was said to have
been depending. It will be seen whether it justified its
abandonment. The report is marked "Received October 2,

"27<i>th March</i> 1827   </p>
<blockquote>"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;I beg to be permitted to
report to your Excellency that having ascertained by two short
journeys adjoining the settlement, that the nature of the country
was such as to render the horses useless in the purpose for which
they were sent&mdash;I commenced with a party of men appointed
for the purpose of protection to examine the country, by first
making a journey to Shallow Lagoon in the direction of Cape
Liptrap&mdash;this occupied 8 days, and a subsequent journey of 4
days commencing at the East entrance which connects the two
journeys. I am induced to believe that about 15 to 20,000 acres
of tolerable fair land could be chosen, but that the scarcity of
water is great at times (excepting that which is aluminous or
brackish) that it was with difficulty we could get as much as was
required for our use. It is true there is abundance of good water
but it lies (excepting in one place) between Wright's River and
Shallow Lagoon in a tract of very bad land, consequently can be
of very little use to settlers. At Cape Paterson I found great
quantities of very fine coal, a sample of which has been sent to
your Excellency&mdash;and on the S.E. side of McLeay's Range
there is abundance of very excellent timber fit for all purposes.
The second journey commenced at Snapper River, the Westmost of 5
on the north shore, for the purpose of visiting the country lying
between this river, the mountains 20 miles to the north and Port
Philip to the west; but bad weather having set in I was precluded
from carrying the latter part of my object into effect, and after
an absence of twelve days I returned to the Settlement but on my
way visited the other rivers alluded to. The country passed
through on this journey is evidently the best in the vicinity of
Western Port consisting of good open forest land and very large
plains both of which are well supplied with fine grass and good
water. The third journey commenced at the Red Bluff (7 miles
north of the Settlement) the principal object of beginning here,
was, as the nature of the country between the Settlement and Red
Bluff was such as to render the communication between them almost
impracticable, until a road is cleared for that purpose, I was
induced to believe from what I had observed on a previous
journey, that an easy route could be found between Bed Bluff and
Snapper River, in this I was, however, mistaken, for at the
distance of about ten miles North of the Bluff we were nearly
incircled in a close and I may say impenetrable brush. I was
therefore obliged to alter my plan of getting to the Mountains to
the North, and take a direction W.S.W. through a part of the
brush not quite so heavy as the other, where I have no doubt in
wet seasons it is quite swampy and at the distance of about four
miles, or five and a half hours, we got through and arrived at
Burchell River the same evening. About three miles east of the
river till it joins a brush of the same description are tracts of
rich meadow land, very thinly timbered, and covered with a fine
coat of grass. As I could not find a passage round this brush by
going north, I returned towards the shore in hopes of finding one
at the heads of Wetherall's three rivers, but here the ground was
so rotten and swampy that it would not bear the tread of a man,
and the close brush coming a short distance below the heads of
the streams, obliged us in preference to cross the rivers
themselves, rather than encounter the same difficulty we had done
in crossing the first; when this was done I kept along the shore
and crossed Snapper River the 4th day. Having sent the boat back
with directions to meet us at Sandy Point (West Shore) opposite
Tortoise Head Eight days, I set forward with my party N.W. by W.
for Port Philip, where we arrived on the second day. Continued
along the sea coast till near the head of the Bay, and having
ascertained the spot which terminated the journey of Mr. Hume and
myself, returned, keeping a course about the centre of the range
which separates Western Port from Port Phillip till we arrived at
the place appointed for the boat to meet us, and returned to the
Settlement on the evening of the 12th day. The land passed
through the first two days were very large plains (Dumaresq's)
heath about the centre or midway between the two bays, and a very
extensive fresh water marsh (from twelve to fifteen miles long
and one and a half to six broad) and only separated from the
latter place (Port Phillip) by a narrow ridge or bank of sand,
not more than from two hundred to three hundred yards wide. The
water in the marsh is excellent. The land lying north of the
marsh in the vicinity of the bay generally speaking is good
forest land well covered with grass, but a great scarcity of good
water. But the land between this and the route of my last journey
till within three miles or four miles of the marsh is heathy,
some parts quite clear of timber&mdash;others again have
abundance of stringy bark. There appears to be but little good
land excepting in one place after a few miles south of the marsh,
until we arrive at a Creek which comes out at Sandy Point,
Western Port, from that Southwardly in the direction of Cape
Schanck is good open forest land, grass thick, and a good
quality. I am not able to judge what quantity of land fit for
location Western Port contains, but I think unless the influx of
free settlers is much greater than it has been, that there is
sufficient for some years to come, without calculating upon the
inexhaustible tract of fine country lying north of this, and to
which there is an easy communication from Snapper River. I had
several interviews with the natives; they appear to be friendly
inclined but great thieves, their manners and customs are the
same as those near Sydney, but their language quite different
they look strong and healthy and live well by means of very fine
Kangaroo dogs, for which they have plenty of employment, which
not only provide them with food but raiment also. In many parts
of the Bay very fine fish are plentiful, principally snappers and
the greatest number of aquatic birds I ever saw in any part of
the Colony.<br>
<br>
"Excepting the difficulty of communicating between the settlement
and Snapper River, but which ere long by a better acquaintance
with the country, will be overcome&mdash;I think the site chosen
for the township is the most eligible of any I have seen, the
scarcity of good water which now exists in consequence of the
dryness of the season, will, I have every reason to believe by
the precautions which the Commandant is using, be obviated before
the commencement of another summer. The distance which it was at
first believed ships would have to lie from the settlement to
discharge or receive cargoes is now lessened to about a quarter
of a mile, two channels of sufficient depth of water having
lately been found where ships can lie in perfect safety. In one
of these the Brig <i>Phillip Dundas</i> discharged her cargo, and
by means of a jetty of 800 feet long boats could communicate with
the settlement at all times of the tide. On a reference to the
meteorological table it will be found that the climate is
agreeable and, if we may judge in so short a period (about five
months) of trial, it is healthy also. I was myself seriously
indisposed, and two of the men were taken very ill in my last
journey, but these three instances of indisposition were the
effects of extreme fatigue, and of an exposure to a burning sun
while, during a whole day, we were almost continually immersed in
water, sometimes up to the neck, and seldom lower than the waist
in crossing marshes and rivers.<br>
<br>
"The scope of country examined by me it will be found includes
the whole of the country in the circumference of Western Port of
which if I may be permitted to recapitulate I would say that the
space to the Southward of Western Port extending from Shallow
Lagoon to Wright's River (a distance of about fifteen miles),
consisting of poor land, covered with heath, undulating, bad to
travel, without water excepting on the Coast (at about 100 or 150
yards from the beach) at the back of the sand hill. At Cape
Paterson there is excellent coal. Shallow Lagoon is salt water.
In Wright's River the water is fresh and very fine within a mile
and a half of the sea. There was very little timber in this
extent of country. From Wright's River to Bass's River, (a
distance of fifteen miles) the land is all of it good, and in
some places excellent, hilly and divided in the direction N.E.
and S.W. by the Southern extremity of McLeay's Range. The country
well covered with fine timber on the S.E. side of this range; but
on the N.W. side of the same open and affording abundance of good
pasturage. In Bass's River the water is fine within about four
miles of its mouth. From this to the Settlement (in a space
containing about 7000 acres of land) the land is excellent
generally open, the timber in this fine tract of country is
neither plentiful nor good (but in the poorer land in the
vicinity of that fine spot there is abundance of excellent
timber) This land appears fit for every kind of cultivation.<br>
<br>
"From the settlement to Red Bluff a distance of about fifteen
miles by land, the land is hilly, swampy, covered alternately
with heath and tea tree bush, and in general utterly impassable
for horses. The land immediately about Red Bluff is fine but ill
supplied with water. From Red Bluff to within two or three miles
of Burchell River (for about four miles) the country is a dead
flat the land unsound and covered with an almost impenetrable
scrub or tea tree bush. From this line to Burchell River the
country is level and consists of fine rich meadow land scantily
wooded. In Burchell river the water was found to be fresh and
extremely good, at low water down to the very entrance. From
Burchell's river to the eastermost of Wetherall's rivers (in a
distance of four miles) the country is extremely fine and similar
in every respect to that just described. The three streams named
Wetherall's Rivers are generally not more than half a mile
distant from each other. They were traced to there source in a
level impenetrable tea tree swamp, about a mile and a half from
the beach. At high water they are brackish but at low ebb the
water is fresh though some what turbid. Between the westermost of
Wetherall's Rivers and Snapper River (in a distance of about five
miles) the country is also level, but covered with stunted trees
(seemingly a species of gum) and brush-wood&mdash;difficult to
travel, excepting very near shore, where the soil is hard and
covered with a coarse grass. The water in Snapper River, about
three miles from its mouth was salt. When met with about twenty
miles from the entrance it was a shallow but fine stream
proceeding apparently from the South Western extremity of the
Alpine Chain. From Snapper River to Hovell's Marsh Port Phillip
the country is fine, consisting of plains and hill and dale
alternately thinly timbered covered with excellent pasturage well
watered generally by means of chains of ponds, or creeks of good
water. From this line to the Southward the country is all of it
of the same description, and to the westward (and here is the
direct opening into the interior of the Country) the same. But in
the Peninsula to the Southward as far as I was enabled to
examine, the land is more hilly and is heathy, and sterile, but
badly supplied with water.<br>
<br>
"Captain Tuckey, however, speaks favorably of some of the country
which he examined situate between Port Phillip and Cape Schank
and a portion of this line of coast which I myself examined was
fully equal to what he has reported of it. McLeay's range which
is about thirty miles in length appears to be the South Western
termination of the South Australian Alps. This range, which in
some places particularly about the centre of its length is high
and forms the eastern barrier of the country about Western Port.
There is another range which is also connected with the Alpine
Chain, and which runs parallel with McLeay's range, distant from
it about three miles, but this is neither so lofty nor does it
extend so far to the southward as the former. Bass's River runs
between these two ranges.<br>
<br>
"I beg to be now permitted to express my hope that my humble
endeavours will meet with the indulgent attention of your
Excellency and more particularly so when the difficulties that
were to be encountered are considered especially the character of
the country in the immediate vicinity to the Northward of the
Settlement, and which precluded me entirely from availing myself
of the use of the horses for carrying of my supplies.<br>
<br>
"The few following general remarks I deem it proper to submit in
closing this report, and first that, as it will appear from the
above account, all the information which has been hitherto given
relative to Western Port, has been in a very extraordinary degree
either scanty, or erroneous. It was supposed that it had no good
anchorage anywhere but at a great distance from the shore;** it
is now found that vessels of 200 tons can approach the spot
selected for the settlement within &frac14; of a mile&mdash;and
the largest vessels can approach within the distance of a mile.
It was confidently reported that there were no rivers. We now
find that, exclusive of Bass's River, there are five rivers. It
was imagined that the land near the beach was a dry flat and that
any one might walk round Western Port dry-shod. It is found, on
the contrary, to consist of a series of country of a most
opposite description.</blockquote>

Mr. Secretary Hay's hand, is in margin:&mdash;"Qy. How far this

<blockquote>"Lieut. Grant in his published account mentions a
river flowing into Western Port, which consists of not less than
40 reaches, and up which he proceeded with a boat. No such stream
is found to exist. The late fugitive descriptions published by
various individuals in the newspapers relative to this place, are
all of them replete with error, and the French Charts are
scarcely less subject to this general remark.<br>
<br>
"Nor can I conclude without expressing my regret, poor as the
fruits of my endeavours may be, that similar excursions had not
been made on the occasion of the settling of Port Phillip, in
which event I do not doubt that the establishment of a settlement
at that place would never have been abandoned.<br>
<br>
"To the Commandants at the recently formed settlement, Captain
Wright and Lieut. Burchell, of the Buffs, I have been
successively much obliged for their kind attention and ready

<p>In a despatch of April 6th, 1827,*** forwarding to Lord
Bathurst the preceding copy of Hovell's report, Governor Darling
says,&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Marked "Recvd. Oct. 2, 1827."]</p>
<blockquote>"I have forwarded this report rather with a view of
patting your Lordship in possession of the whole of the
information I have collected respecting Western Port, than from
any idea of the importance of the information. The scarcity of
water throughout the country, renders the land unavailable to any
extent for the purposes either of grazing or agriculture; and the
difficulty of access to the shore from the mud flats which appear
to extend round the margin of the Port, must prevent its ever
becoming a place of trade, though if the interior of the country
were open, it might be used as a means of facilitating the
communication between this Colony and Van Diemen's Land. It would
in fact appear from the reports which have been received that the
statement of Mr. Oxley which accompanied my despatch No. 77, of
last year, though drawn up from recollection, after a lapse of
twenty years, was substantially correct, and that Western Port
does not possess the necessary requisites for a Settlement. I
have not found any disposition on the part of the inhabitants to
settle that part of the country, which, should your Lordship
consider that the object of taking formal possession of it, has
been answered, might be a sufficient reason for withdrawing the
persons sent to establish the settlement."</blockquote>
<p>The observations following this despatch are most probably by
Mr. Secretary Hay, though the initials of the Parliamentary
Secretary, Mr. Horton, happened to be the same.</p>
<blockquote>"In consequence of the French having equipped an
expedition for the purpose of surveying the Coast of New Holland,
it was deemed advisable to anticipate their proceedings (should
they have any idea of establishing settlements there) by prior
occupancy of all the places to which it was probable their
attention would be directed.<br>
<br>
"The enclosed two despatches and private letter contain the
reports &amp;c. of the officers who were detached on this service
to King George's Sound and Western Port&mdash;and it will now be
necessary to decide whether the settlements which have been
established at these places should be continued there or be
withdrawn. Possession having been formally taken of them, the
object so far as relates to keeping out the French will be
answered whether our establishments be continued there or
not.<br>
<br>
"Instructions have been sent out to abandon the settlement at
Western Port unless Mr. Hovell's report should be more favourable
than those which were made by Captain Wetherall and Captain
Wright who were sent in charge of the expedition by which the
settlement was established.<br>
<br>
"In my opinion (although I presume it is not that of General
Darling) Mr. Hovell's report is infinitely more favourable than
these of his predecessors, and I think that the situation of
Western Port is so important with reference to Van Diemen's Land
that I should be inclined to recommend that a further trial
should be made of the newly established settlement.<br>
<br>
"If it were surmised at Sydney that it was to be broken up no
settlers would be inclined to go there&mdash;but it does not
follow that under other circumstances this spot might not be a
popular place of resort.<br>

<blockquote>"Papers relating to the settlements at New South
Wales, with letter from the Admiralty reporting proceedings for
forming establishments at Croker's Inlet.<br>
<br>
"26 <i>Jan</i>.&mdash;It will be necessary to send out
instructions for the guidance of General Darling in regard to the
different settlements on the Coast of New Holland to which the
attention of the Government at home has been specially directed
and of these Swan Peel requires the earliest notice. It is clear
that this point is too distant from Sydney to be colonized from
thence and so the Governor should be informed. The East India
Company should be apprized of the circumstances attending the
discovery of that river, in case they should think it desirable
to make any settlement there.<br>
<br>
"Western Port ought not to be given up, and if the last
despatches have intimated to the Governor that a doubt was felt
at home as to the propriety of retaining an establishment there
General Darling should be directed not to withdraw from it.<br>
<br>
"The idea of establishing a penal settlement at King George's
Sound does not seem to be borne out by the experiment which has
been made, and it can scarcely be necessary to keep up a
settlement there, but upon this point I should recommend that the
circumstances of the soil &amp;c. should be fully examined before
any orders are sent out.</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="right"><small>"R.W.H."</small>   </p>
<blockquote>"Mr. Huskisson's minute which accompanies these
papers must not be lost sight of."</blockquote>
<p>In a letter from Mr. Barrow, of the Admiralty, to Mr.
Secretary Horton, of October 15th, 1827, the advantages of Swan
River, Melville Island, and Western Port, are considered, the
first-named being highly spoken of, except as to
accessibility:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"It must," says Mr. Barrow, "be looked at therefore
solely in the light of a new Colony, almost as much separated
from that of N. S. Wales as it would be from England; for so
difficult and uncertain is the passage through Bass's Strait that
in the most favorable season (of three months in the year) it
requires a passage of three months for a coasting vessel; and
they frequently cannot make it at all. . . . No other motive I
conceive than the political one of preventing other nations (as
the French or Americans) from possessing themselves of the S. Wn.
Corner of New Holland should induce us to anticipate them; and
even in the event of its falling into the hands of the one or the
other of these powers, would be a long series of years, before
they could give our other Colonies much annoyance.<br>
<br>
"Western Port, I conceive to be very differently situated in all
its circumstances. It overlooks and watches and would be in
immediate communication with one of the principal rivers and
establishments on Van Diemen's Land; it would also in a very few
years be in immediate communication and form a connecting link
with the territory south of Sydney and already occupied, and
though in the immediate neighbourhood of the Bay, the whole of
the surrounding country may not possess so rich a soil as might
be desired, yet it is evident that the further from the shore,
the richer it becomes; and indeed it is known that at the
distance of 30 or 40 miles, the country is as fine as any part
now occupied. I think therefore that, on every consideration
<i>Western Port ought not to be abandoned</i>." *</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* These words are underlined in pencil, and this
note written in the same:&mdash;"The Governor has been directed
to withdraw the Settlement if Mr. Hovell's report of the interior
of the country is not more favourable than Captain Wetherall's of
the coast."]</p>
<p>Writing to Mr. Hay, May 23rd, 1828, Mr. Barrow remarks, after
expressing approval of the transfer of the settlement from
Melville Island to Raffles' Bay,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I read the report of Captain Stirling on Swan River;
the distance is certainly great between it and Sydney; but it is
obviously a fine country, and if Western Port and King George's
Sound be retained they form two stepping-stones towards it; and
with these three settlements on the South and west and Raffles'
Bay on the North I think we may consider ourselves in unmolested
possession of the great Continent of N. S. Wales."</blockquote>
<p>In the following letter to the Secretary of State, Viscount
Goderich, dated Sydney, December 24th, 1827, Governor Darling
arrives at a conclusion the reverse of that borne out by the
facts detailed in the preceding documents. He had not then had
time to be informed of Mr. Hay's views.</p>
<blockquote>"<small>MY LORD</small>,&mdash;I have the honor to
acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship's despatch No 32 of the
19th of July last, authorising me to withdraw the troops and
persons employed to establish a Settlement at Western Port, in
the event of Mr. Hovell's report not proving more favorable than
that which Captain Wetherall had made.<br>
<br>
"Your Lordship will have perceived by my despatch of 6th April
last marked Separate, that nothing could have been less
satisfactory, than the information obtained from Mr. Hovell; and
as I am satisfied that no useful purpose would be answered, while
inconvenience and expense would be occasioned by continuing that
settlement, it is my intention, in pursuance of your Lordship's
instructions to take steps for immediately abandoning it.<br>
<br>
"It appears to me that Western Port, which, from its local
situation, appears to have been very incorrectly named, being on
the South Coast, and several degrees nearer the Eastern than the
Western boundary of New Holland (can only be useful when the
settlement of the Colony is so far extended to the Southward)
which cannot be the case for a very considerable period of time)
as to render it desirable to have a Port for the introduction of
supplies for the settlers in that neighbourhood and the
exportation of their produce, instead of being subjected to the
necessity of forwarding them overland to Sydney.<br>
<br>
"While on this subject, I avail myself of the opportunity of
stating, that King George's Sound, is still more inconveniently
situated, with reference to the seat of government, than Western
Port. The communication which is always tedious, is often
difficult and uncertain; and the place itself a barren waste,
totally unavailable for any purpose of
agriculture&mdash;retaining it, is therefore entirely a question
of policy and your Lordship can alone determine, whether the
object of preventing the occupation of it by any other Power, is
of sufficient importance to induce its being continued on such a
contingency. I have the honor to be &amp;c.</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="right"><small>"RA.
DARLING."</small>   </p>
<p>It will be seen that some people in England, intending to
proceed to Australia, had their attention at this time directed
to Western Port and its vicinity.</p>
<p>In a letter to Lord Bathurst, of January 4th, 1827, a Mr.
Michael Phillips, writing from London, states his intention of
proceeding to N. S. Wales, to be followed by his wife and six
children. He says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Hitherto the Southern parts of the Colony have not
been located, and for the furtherance of my object in the
cultivation of grain and grazing in general, I have fixed upon
that part of the Colony called Western Port as the most
desirable; the soil is congenial for the production of grain, to
which I shall most direct my attention and by having most
respectable connections in the Brazils, I look forward with a
prospect of ultimate success in establishing there the
consumption of N. S. Wales wheat as it has already a preference
to the American flour."</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to ask for a grant of four thousand acres at
Western Port, and the privilege of purchasing a similar quantity
at that place, and proposes to employ thirty convicts upon the
land. The memorandum of reply on the letter is, that the Governor
will be directed to give every encouragement to the project, but
that the grant of land must depend on the applicant's
capital.</p>
<p>In the same year, a Captain Roberts, of the 48th Regiment,
also applied to Mr. Secretary Hay for a grant of land at Port
Phillip.</p>
<p>Among the documents relating to Batman's expedition, in the
Van Diemen's Land Correspondence of 1885, is the following short
epitome of the circumstances connected with the formation and
abandonment of this Western Port settlement:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">"14<i>th Dec</i>. /35</p>
<p class="quote" align="center"><small>"WESTERN PORT.</small></p>
<blockquote>"In the year 1826, instructions were sent to
Lieutenant-General Darling to establish a settlement at Western
Port. (Lord Bathurst No. 16. 1st March /26). That measure appears
to have been suggested not so much by considerations of any
peculiar fitness which that spot might possess for colonization
(although that was made the ostensible ground of forming the
settlement) as by an apprehension which existed at the time, that
the French, who had some survey ships in those seas, might effect
a settlement on that part of the Coast. (Lord Bathurst, 1 Mar.
/26) Lieutenant-General Darling accordingly established a
settlement there on the 9th Oct. 1826.<br>
<br>
"The early reports which were received from Western Port
(Lieut.-Gen. Darling 4th Feb. 1827) were so unfavourable that Mr.
Huskisson (probably considering that the real object in view had
been accomplished) directed the withdrawal of the establishment,
unless the Governor should, in the meantime, have received a more
favorable report as to the capabilities; and General Darling
thereupon announced his intention of taking immediate measures
for breaking up the settlement (Lieut-General Darling 24th Oct.
1827).<br>
<br>
"It, however, happened, soon after Mr. Huskisson had sent out his
instructions for abandoning Western Port, a further report was
received, (Lieut-General Darling 6 April 1827.) which created a
very different impression as to the fitness of the place for
colonization, and Mr. Huskisson was induced to recal his former
instructions: (Mr. Huskisson 20th Jan. 1828) but that recal seems
to have reached N. S. Wales too late to be of any
avail."</blockquote>
<p>Instead of acting upon the more correct conclusions of the
Government in England, with regard to the maintenance of the
settlement at Western Port, Governor Darling withdrew it. He did
not give that effect to Captain Hovell's report which, before the
facts recorded in it were ascertained, he stated it should have,
in determining whether the settlement should be abandoned or
maintained. He declared that report to be unfavourable, although
there is no doubt that, to use Mr. Secretary Hay's words, it was
"infinitely more favorable than that of his" (Hovell's)
"predecessors". Governor Darling was clearly not a colonizing
Governor; at all events, like Collins in the case of Port
Phillip, he seems to have determined that the Western Port
settlement should not succeed. It is surprising how he could,
after reading Hovell's report, have treated it as a condemnation,
instead of a commendation of the country. In numerous places the
description of the land proclaimed it to be fit for colonization.
This was even so at the settlement itself, which Hovell intimates
was well chosen. But the one extract next given ought to have
been decisive, unless the Governor had determined to place no
reliance upon the report. "I am not able," says Hovell, "to judge
what quantity of land fit for location Western Port contains, but
I think unless the influx of settlers is much greater than it has
been, that there is sufficient for some years to come, without
calculating upon the inexhaustible tract of fine country lying
north of this, and to which there is an easy communication from
Snapper River."</p>
<p>In a despatch, however, of April 24th, 1829, in forwarding a
memorial from Hovell for an additional grant of land, Governor
Darling says that his services at Western Port were of very
little value.</p>
<p>The statements of Captains Wetherall and Wright, even if not
favourable enough to justify the formation of a new settlement,
certainly do not excuse the abandonment, after so short a trial,
of one which had already been established.</p>

<h4>STURT AND MACLEAY'S BOAT EXPEDITION DOWN THE MURRAY.</h4>
<p class="negindent">Sturt's preliminary
investigations&mdash;Despatch of Governor Darling recording
them&mdash;Sturt describes discovery of the Darling&mdash;Great
heat and drought&mdash;Governor Darling's despatch announcing
Sturt's departure on his famous expedition&mdash;His last letter

result of expedition&mdash;Description of boat being shot from

Office&mdash;Murder of Captain Barker.</p>
<p>P<small>ERHAPS</small> at first sight it might be thought that
the expeditions of Captain Sturt scarcely belong to the history
of Victoria, seeing that the most important of them only traced a
portion of the stream which forms part of the boundaries of the
Colony; still the discovery of that great river, which is the
chief outlet of the inland waters of Australia, is as much part
of the history of Victoria, and even of Queensland, as of New
South Wales and South Australia. The fact, also, that the stream,
followed down to the ocean by Sturt and Macleay, was the same
which Hume had discovered nearer its source, and called by his
own name, links the explorations of the later expeditions with
those which have been already recorded.</p>
<p>On January 14th, 1830, Sturt reached the Murray; the boat
bearing the gallant explorers being suddenly shot into it from
the Murrumbidgee, at two o'clock in the day. The great river did
not damp their ardour, and, far from satisfying, only stimulated
their thirst for further discovery; so they resolved to be borne
by the stream wherever it went. Accordingly, following its
course, they discovered the mouth of the Darling on the 23rd. On
February 8th, Lake Alexandrina was entered, and, on the afternoon
of the 10th, Captain Sturt and Mr. Macleay, whilst their men were
pitching the tents, walked to the sea shore at Encounter Bay. The
return journey&mdash;performed by rowing against the
stream&mdash;was most exhausting; but the party succeeded in
reaching their dep&ocirc;t on March 23rd, just as their
provisions and strength were completely spent.</p>
<p>The record of an expedition of so much interest and importance
must always occupy a prominent place in the history of Australian
discovery; but the previous investigations of Captain Sturt,
leading up to this great and successful effort, must also be
noticed in connexion with it. Although the famous explorer has
himself given to the world, in two volumes,* the narrative of
these expeditions, the following despatches, copied from those in
the Record Office, should be read with interest, as the very
first written accounts of the journeys. The author, acting upon
the principle of going back to the very first statements of
discovery, therefore offers them to his readers.</p>
<p class="foot">[* "Two Expeditions into the Interior of Southern
Australia," &amp;c., published 1833.]</p>
<p>In a despatch to Sir George Murray, from Governor Darling,
dated Parramatta, November 19th, 1828, are the following
particulars bearing upon Captain Sturt's exploration of the
Murray:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I have just despatched Captain Sturt of the 39th
Regiment on an expedition, the object of which is to ascertain
the coarse and fate of the River Macquarie. He is to commence at
the marsh where the expedition under the late Mr. Oxley
terminated in the year 1818, which was in lat 29.30 south and
long. 147.10 east. It has appeared to me as Mr. Oxley was unable
to proceed in consequence of the extensive swamp or marsh, in
which the Macquarie appeared to terminate and as the state of the
weather at that time, the rains having been incessant may have
occasioned the country being flooded, that the present season
owing to the unexampled draught which has been experienced,
scarcely any rain having fallen for the last two years presents
an opportunity peculiarly favorable for following up the object
of Mr. Oxley's expedition.<br>
<br>
"Should the waters which prevented Mr. Oxley's progress, not
impede Captain Sturt's, he will proceed as far as circumstances
will permit, in pursuit of the object pointed out and I have
taken care to have supplies in readiness to be placed in
dep&ocirc;t that his stock may be recruited without the necessity
of his returning to Wellington Valley, our extreme settlement on
the Macquarie. Should he find that the waters which opposed Mr.
Oxley still exist, they must at all events from their nature be
considerably diminished in consequence of the long drought; and
in this case I have instructed Captain Sturt to skirt them, with
a view of ascertaining their extent, and the description of the
surrounding country, so as to enable His Majesty's government to
judge of the means which the interior affords for more extensive
settlements.<br>
<br>
"Captain Sturt has been provided with a light boat constructed
for the occasion, and I have furnished the expedition in a
manner, though at a very trifling expense, which will be likely
to prevent its failure from the want of adequate means. Captain
Sturt from his scientific knowledge, appears to be fully
competent to the undertaking and being ardently devoted to it,
there is every chance of his success. Though now some time in the
country, he has had however but little opportunity of being
practically acquainted with its character. In order therefore to
afford him the assistance of an experienced traveller, J have
attached Mr. Hume to the expedition, who made an excursion to the
Southward in the neighbourhood of Western Port, during Sir Thomas
Brisbane's administration. He is an enterprising man whose
knowledge of the country generally and experience in conducting
an establishment of the nature now employed cannot fail to
promote the success of the expedition."</blockquote>
<p>With a despatch of January 10th, 1829, Governor Darling
encloses a copy of Captain Sturt's letter, dated Western Marshes,
December 25th, 1828, reporting the progress of the Macquarie
expedition, and also an extract of the explorer's journal, dated
Mount Foster, December 21st, 1828&mdash;from Monday, December
8th, to Saturday the 20th, inclusive. It is stated, among other
things, that the party suffered from intense heat, which produced
inflammation of the eyes. On the 13th the thermometer "stood
139&deg; in the sun and 122&deg; in the shade at 3 p.m., and at
98&deg; at half past seven."</p>
<p>In a despatch from the Governor, of April 24th, 1829, the
result of the expedition is given, accompanied by a copy of
Sturt's letter to the Colonial Secretary of N. S. Wales, dated
Mount Harris, March 4th. The journey revealed the fact that the
Macquarie terminated in marshes, and, more important still, the
existence of the Darling. This, we shall see, subsequently led on
to Sturt's explorations more immediately connected with Victoria.
He thus describes his first meeting with the Darling:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I have placed Oxley's Table Land in Lat. 29&deg; 57'
30"&mdash;Long. 15&deg;" (sic) "43' 30". Finding impracticable to
move westward from the hill I again descended on the Creek, whose
general course was to the North west, in which direction we at
length struck upon a river whose appearance raised our most
sanguine expectations. It flowed round an angle from the N.E. to
the N.W. and extended in longitude five reaches as far as we
could see. At that place it was about 60 yards broad with banks
of from 30 to 40 feet high, and it had numerous wild fowl and
many pelicans upon its bosom, and seemed to be full of fish,
while the paths of the natives on both sides like well trodden
roads, showed how numerous they were about it. On tasting its
waters, however, we found them perfectly salt and useless to us
and as our animals had been without water the night before, this
circumstance distressed us much; our first days journey led us
past 60 and 70 huts in one place, and on our second we fell in
with a numerous tribe of natives, having previously seen some
between two creeks before we made the New Year's Range. At some
places the water proving less salt than at others, our animals
drank of it sparingly. We found two fresh water boles, which
served us as we passed. After tracing the River for a
considerable distance, when we came on brine springs in the bed
of it, the banks having been encrusted with salt from the first
and as the difficulty of getting fresh water was so great, I here
foresaw an end to our wanderings, and as I was resolved not to
involve my party in greater distress, I halted it, on overtaking
the animals, and the next morning turned back to the nearest
fresh water at a distance of 18 miles from us. Unwilling however
to give up our pursuit, Mr. Hume and I started with two men on
horseback, to trace the river as far as we could and to ascertain
what course it took, in the hopes also that we should fall on
some creek, or get a more certain supply of drinkable water. We
went a distance to which the bullocks could not have been brought
and then got on a red sandy soil, which at once destroyed our
hopes and on tasting the river water, we found it salter than
ever, our supply being diminished to two pints. Our animals being
weak and purged and having proceeded at least 40 miles from the
Camp I thought it best to yield to circumstances and to return,
though I trust I shall be believed when I add it was with extreme
reluctance I did so, and had I followed the wishes of my party I
should still have continued onwards.<br>
<br>
"Making a part of the river where we had slept, we staid to
refresh and in consequence of the heat of the weather, were
obliged to drink the water in it which made us sick. While here a
tribe of blacks came to us and behaved remarkably well. At night
we slept on a plain without water, and the next day we regained
the camp, which had been visited by the natives during our
absence.<br>
<br>
"We found the river held a South west course, and appeared to be
making for the central space between a high land, which I called
Dunlop's Range at Mr. Hume's request, and a lofty range to the
westward. It still continued its important appearance, having
gained in breadth, and in the height of its banks, while there
were hundreds of pelicans and wild fowl on it. Flowing through a
level country with such a channel it may be presumed that this
river ultimately assumes either a greater character or that it
adds considerably to the importance of some other stream. It has
a clay bottom generally speaking semi-indurated and fast forming
into sandstone, while there was a kind of shale running in veins
through the soil which composed the bank. This river differs from
most in the Colony, in having a belt of narrow sand of from a
quarter of a mile to two miles in breadth in its immediate
neighbourhood, and which is subject to overflow. There is
magnificent blue gum on both sides the river, but the right bank
is evidently the most fertile, and I am mistaken greatly if there
is not a most beautiful country to the north of it."</blockquote>
<p>With the sagacity of a true explorer, Captain Sturt
remarks&mdash;and it would have been well if others who have
first seen new country under more favourable circumstances had
not been more hasty in condemning it,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Of the country over which we passed it is impossible
for me to have formed a correct opinion under its present
melancholy circumstances. It has shown appearance of barrenness,
where in even moderate rain, it might have shown very
differently; though no doubt we passed over much of both good and
bad land; our animals on the whole have thriven on the food they
have had, which would argue favorably for the
herbage&mdash;generally speaking, I fear the timber is
bad&mdash;the rough may gum be useful for fences and such
purposes and we may have seen wood for the wheelwright and
cabinet maker, specimens of which I have procured but none for
general or household purposes.<br>
<br>
"The creeks we have traced are different in character from those
in the settled districts; inasmuch that like the river they have
a belt of barren land near them and but little grass&mdash;they
have been all of them numerously frequented by the natives as
appeared from the number of muscle shells on their banks, but now
have scarcely any water in them, the fish have either been taken,
or are dead and the tribes gone elsewhere for food, while the
badness of the river water has introduced a cutaneous disease
among the natives of that district, which is fast carrying them
off. Our intercourse with these people was incessant from the
time we first met them, and on all occasions they behaved
remarkably well, nor could we have seen less than two hundred and
fifty of them. Our return is to be attributable to want of water
alone, and it is impossible for me to describe the effects of the
drought on animal as well as vegetable nature. The natives are
wandering in the desert and it is melancholy to reflect on the
necessity which obliges them to drink the stinking and loathsome
water they do&mdash;birds sit gasping in the trees and are quite
thin&mdash;the wild dog prowls about in the daytime unable to
avoid us, and is as lean as he can be in a living state, while
minor vegetation is dead, and the very trees are drooping. I have
noticed all these things in my journal, I shall have the honour
of submitting through you for the Governor's perusal and
information on my return. Finally, I fear our expedition will not
prove the way to any ultimate benefit, although it has been the
means by which two very doubtful questions, the course of the
Macquarie and the nature of our interior, have been solved; for
it is beyond doubt that the interior for 250 miles beyond its
former known limits to the W.N.W, so far from being a shoal sea,
has been ascertained not only to have considerable elevations
upon it, but is in itself a table land to all intents and
purposes and has scarcely water on its surface to support its
inhabitants."</blockquote>
<p>The letter concludes with the following high testimony to
Hume's services:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I beg you will inform His Excellency the Governor,
that I have on all occasions received the most ready and valuable
assistance from Mr. Hume. His intimate acquaintance with the
manners and customs of the natives, enabled him to enter into
intercourse with them, and chiefly contributed to the peaceable
manner in which we have journeyed, while his previous experience
put it in his power to be of real use to me. I cannot but say he
has done an essential service to future travellers, and to the
Colony at large, by his conduct on all occasions since he has
been with me, nor should I be doing him justice if I did not
avail myself of the first opportunity of laying my sentiments
before the Governor through you. I am happy to add that every
individual of the party deserves my warmest approbation, and that
they have one and all borne their distresses, trifling certainly,
but still unusual with cheerfulness and that they have at all
times been attentive to their duty and obedient to their orders.
The whole are in good health and eager again to
start."</blockquote>
<p>Governor Darling in his despatch, with which the above was
sent, speaks highly of Hume, whom, he says, he "selected to
accompany Captain Sturt". He also expresses warm appreciation of
that gallant officer's high qualities, which his subsequent
explorations so conspicuously brought out.</p>
<p>In a letter of March 5th, the day after that on which the
preceding one was written, Captain Sturt tells the Colonial
Secretary:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"It having appeared to me that after discovering such
a river as the one I have described in my letter of yesterday,
His Excellency the Governor would approve of my endeavouring to
regain it, there being a probability that it ultimately joins the
Southern waters, I thought of turning of my steps to the
Southward and westward, with a view to learn the nature of the
country. I despatched Mr. Hume in that direction on Saturday
last. He returned in three days after having gone about forty
miles from the river and states that he crossed two creeks, the
one about twenty five miles, the other about thirty two distance
evidently the heads of the creeks we passed westward of the
Marshes of the Macquarie. He adds, that, to the second creek the
land was excellent but that on crossing it, he got on a red soil
on which he travelled some miles further, until he saw a range of
land, bearing from him S.W. by W., when knowing from the nature
of the country around him and from the experience of our late
journey that he could not hope to find a regular supply of fresh
water in advance and that in the present dry state of the low
lands, a movement such as I had contemplated would be
impracticable, he returned."</blockquote>
<p>The letter goes on to state the explorer's intention to
proceed towards the Castlereagh. He also reports that the
Macquarie had ceased to flow, and that the water is fast
diminishing; also that the blacks had in one instance been
troublesome.</p>
<p>In a letter from Wellington Valley, dated April 6th, 1829, to
the Colonial Secretary at Sydney, Sturt says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I am to add that having made the 'Castlereagh' three
days after our departure from Mount Harris we traced that stream
to its junction with the 'Darling', about one hundred miles to
the Northward of the mount. It was however with extreme
difficulty that we proceeded so far, in consequence of the dry
state of the low lands. The Castlereagh was without water for a
distance of thirty miles at a stretch, and we were obliged to
search the country round for a supply. The creeks falling into
the river from the Northward and eastward were dry and deserted
by the native tribes, as far as we traced them up, and the
country in those directions, was an unbroken level of alluvial
soil, and stunted timber. On reaching the Darling we found the
waters to be salter than below."</blockquote>
<p>With Hume, Sturt crossed the river, and proceeded in a N.W.
direction for some distance, through a "perfectly-level" country,
which from the highest tree, which a man ascended, presented the
appearance of a "boundless flat".</p>
<p>The explorer relates, "It was impracticable for us in turning
homewards to retrace our steps up the Castlereagh. I therefore
determined on running up a Central Creek which appeared to be
directly below the Marshes of the Macquarie, as both Mr. Hume and
myself were anxious to determine from whence it originated. We
found in tracing it that it served to carry off the superfluous
waters of that river in high floods, and was formed by the union
of many channels from the reeds." It is further stated that "the
superfluous waters of the Macquarie fall into a creek,
(Morisset's Ponds of Mr. Oxley) striking nearly at right angles
about eight miles above where the latter falls into the
Castlereagh, which river forms a junction with the Darling about
12 miles below to the W.N.W. at which it was perfectly dry."</p>
<p>The letter terminates with a description of the great drought
of the period, and a commendation of Hume and all the party.</p>
<p>November 21st, 1829, Governor Darling writes to Sir George
Murray, informing him of Sturt's departure upon his great
journey, which threw so much light on the geography of Australia.
It is remarkable how some of the conjectures indicated by the
Governor were established as facts by the expedition. The
following is the despatch given in full:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"SIR,&mdash;I have the honour to acquaint yon, that
Captain Sturt, has proceeded on another expedition, directing his
course to the River Mirambidgee, which lays to the southward, in
order to ascertain whether that river joins the Darling, which he
discovered on his late expedition, as he is induced to believe,
or if it empties itself into the sea on the Southern Coast of the
Colony. As the Mirambidgee is a river of some magnitude it will
be satisfactory to be assured of its course and termination, as
well as of the nature of the country through which it runs.
Should it unite with the Darling and proceed to any part of the
Southern Coast, within a reasonable distance, it might, in the
event of the land being of a good quality, prove an inducement to
the settlement of that part of the country, as from the junction
of two such considerable Rivers, there can be little doubt that
the issue of these rivers would be navigable&mdash;a circumstance
which alone would be important to settlers and might be the means
of opening a direct and perhaps, an easy communication between
Sydney and that part of the Colony.<br>
<br>
"I received information some time since, that there is a large
lagoon in the neighbourhood of Gulf St. Vincent, and from the
direction of the Darling, when Captain Sturt was obliged to
discontinue tracing that river, it is not improbable that it
falls into the lagoon or some part of the Gulf, with which I
understand, the lagoon communicates. The result of the Expedition
may be important to the Colony and as the expense of the
equipment is trifling, I have not hesitated to avail myself of
Captain Sturt's services, which have been cheerfully tendered on
this occasion.<br>
<br>
"It may be proper to add, that the first object of the present
expedition is to trace the Mirambidgee&mdash;Should it not unite
with the Darling, but terminate in a marsh as the Lachlan, which
is not improbable, or as the Macquarie was supposed to do, until
Captain Sturt's former expedition proved the contrary, I have in
that case directed him to endeavour to regain the Darling and
pursue it as far as circumstances may render
desirable.</blockquote>

<p class="quote" align="right"><small>"RA.
DARLING."</small>   </p>
<p>We hear of Sturt's progress, in a letter from him to the
Colonial Secretary at Sydney, of January 4th, 1831,&mdash;the
date evidently wrongly copied for 1830,&mdash;from "Depot
Morambidge, Long. 143&deg; 45' 7" E., Lat. 34&deg; 15 S." The
explorer states,&mdash;"I arrived at this position on the 27th
ult., after a long and in some respects a fatiguing journey of
thirty-two days, since that on which I made the Morambidgee." Of
this river&mdash;at first spelt variously&mdash;he
says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"If it did not in the first instance meet my
expectations, its appearance has been such during the subsequent
stages as to encourage a hope that it will eventually be found to
discharge itself into some larger stream or basin, since I cannot
for a moment imagine that it meets the fate of the more northern
streams. At our depot it is from two to two hundred and fifty
feet broad with a depth that varies from twelve to twenty. Its
banks are about nine feet high, and its current is at about a
mile and a quarter per hour. Indeed, excepting under the firmest
impression on my mind that it carries an uninterrupted channel
below the marshes in front of us, which I previously examined, I
should not have ordered the large boat to be built. I am not
under any apprehension that our progress down the river will
speedily terminate.<br>
<br>
"I shall order the party with the drays to remain at the depot
for ten days after my departure, before the expiration of which
time it is probable, I shall have some fresh communication to
make in which case I shall detach the small boat with such
additional intelligence as I shall have it in my power to give.
Should you not however hear further from me, you will conclude
that I passed the line of communication without any check, and
that I am making the best of my way to the coast, or down such
other channel as I shall have found.<br>
<br>
"I cannot write in too high terms of the Upper Branches of the
Morambidgee. With beautiful scenery they combine richness of
soil, a sufficiency of water and excellent grazing tracts.
Alluvial flats continue for more than one hundred and forty miles
below Kudjiong&mdash;the station of Mr. O'Brien and to that
distance there is an abundance of pasture behind them. Below the
flats however, the plains take up the character of the more
northern Interior. Their depressed situation causes those
droughts under the effects of which vegetation has perished upon
them. The only favorable point in which that part of the country
can be viewed, is that the river gets a deeper bed, and becomes
more navigable in flowing through it. The soil of this remote
Interior is of the first description and is certainly preferable
to that which intervenes between it and the upper Districts, but
it is to the issue of this journey only that we must look for the
importance that is to be attached to any local advantages on the
Morambidge, which unfrequented and unimproved is still a noble
feature in the country.<br>
<br>
"I beg you will inform His Excellency that I passed on the best
terms with the natives and that I expect every facility will be
afforded by them to the party about to return. I observe that
they suffer extremely from cold and that the country does not
afford them means of procuring skins there being few animals in
it; if therefore it were possible to distribute a few Blankets
among them, I am sure they would be most welcome presents for
well meant services to me.<br>
<br>
"It is my intention to proceed down the river with a party of
eight collectively and I am happy to state that on the reduced
allowance, I shall have twelve weeks supply of flour and meat,
after giving the men about to return, provisions for six weeks. I
fear our sugar will soon be exhausted, but I do not think any
other part of our stock will fail.<br>
<br>
"Should we make the Coast, I have little doubt it will be in less
than a month, but should we take another course, it is probable
we shall not return to the Depot till our provisions are entirely
exhausted. Under existing circumstances therefore it may be as
well to forward such further supplies as it may be considered we
shall require, without loss of time from Sydney, and I should
think the small dray with the pack animals will be sufficient for
their conveyance. I shall leave instructions with Robert Harris
as to the place at which I may be expected, beyond which it will
not be necesary for him to advance.<br>
<br>
"I fear it will be too late to send a vessel round to Encounter
Bay our most probable place of exit in the event of our
succeeding in gaining the Coast, but I am led to think that His
Excellency's foresight has ensured that assistance to us, in the
event of our requiring it."</blockquote>
<p>Sturt, who had the art of getting on well with
everybody&mdash;blacks as well as whites&mdash;concludes by
speaking in the highest terms of all his men, asking for the
remission of the sentences of two of them who were prisoners. The
carpenter, he states, "put the large boat together, in the best
manner, in four days, she being 25 feet in length by 5&frac12;
across the beam, and built a second of 13 feet in length from the
forest within a week."</p>
<p>The following letter, to the Chief Secretary of N. S. Wales,
gives the very first report of the important discoveries of the
expedition:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">"<i>Banks of the
Murrumbidgee</i>   <br>
"20<i>th April</i> 1830.          <br></p>
<blockquote>"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;The departure of Mr.
M'Leay for Sydney who is anxious to proceed homewards as speedily
as possible affords me an earlier opportunity than would
otherwise have presented itself by which to make you acquainted
with the circumstance of my return under Divine protection, to
the located Districts; and I do myself the honor of annexing a
brief account of my proceedings, since the last communication for
the information of His Excellency the Governor, until such time
as I shall have it in my power to give in a more detailed
report.<br>
<br>
"On the 7th of January agreeably to the arrangements which had
been made I proceeded down the Murrumbidgee in the whaleboat,
with a complement of six hands independent of Mr. M'Leay and
myself, holding the skiff in tow. The river for several days kept
a general W.S.W. course; it altered little in appearance, nor did
any material change take place in the country upon its banks. The
alluvial flats had occasionally an increased breadth on either
side of it, but the line of reeds was nowhere so extensive, as
from previous appearances I had been led to expect. About twelve
miles from the Depot, we passed a large creek junction from the
N.E. which from its locality, and from the circumstance of my
having been upon it in the direction of them, I cannot but
conclude originates in the marshes of the Lachlan.<br>
<br>
"On the 11th the Murrumbidgee became much encumbered with fallen
timber, and its current was at times so rapid that I was under
considerable apprehension for the safety of the boats. The skiff
had been upset on the 8th, and although I could not anticipate
such an accident to the large boat, I feared she would receive
some more serious and irremediable injury. On the 14th these
difficulties increased upon us&mdash;The channel of the river
became more contracted, and its current more impetuous. We had no
sooner cleared one reach, than fresh and apparently
insurmountable dangers presented themselves to us in the next. I
really feared that every precaution would have proved unavailing
against such multiplied embarrassments and that ere night we
should have possessed only the wrecks of the expedition. From
this state of anxiety however we were unexpectedly relieved by
our arrival at 2 p.m. at the termination of the Murrumbidgee,
from which we were launched into a broad and noble river, flowing
from East to West at the rate of two knots and a half per hour,
over a clear sandy bed of a medium width of from three to four
hundred feet.<br>
<br>
"During the first stages of our journey upon this new river,
which evidently had its rise in the mountains of the S.E. we made
rapid progress to the W.N.W. through an unbroken and
uninteresting country of equal sameness of feature and
vegetation. On the 23rd, as the boats were proceeding down it,
several hundreds of natives made their appearance upon the right
bank, having assembled with premeditated purposes of violence. I
was more surprised at this show of hostility, because we had
passed on generally friendly terms not only with those on the
Murrumbidgee but of the new river. Now however emboldened by
numbers they seemed determined on making the first attack, and
soon worked themselves into a state of frenzy by loud and
vehement shouting, as I observed that the water was shoaling
fast, I kept in the middle of the stream and under the impression
that it would be impossible for me to avoid a conflict, prepared
for an obstinate resistance, but at the very moment when having
arrived opposite to a large sand bank, on which they had
collected, the foremost of the blacks had already advanced into
the water, and I only awaited their nearer approach to fire upon
them, their impetuosity was restrained by the most unlooked for
and unexpected interference. They held back of a sudden and
allowed us to pass unmolested&mdash;The boat however almost
immediately grounded on a shoal that stretched across the river,
over which she was with some difficulty hauled into deeper water,
when we found ourselves opposite to a large junction from the
eastward, little inferior to the river itself. Had I been aware
of this circumstance, I should have been more anxious with regard
to my rupture with the natives, and I was now happy to find that
most of them had laid aside their weapons and had crossed the
junction, it appearing that they had previously been on a tongue
of land by the junction of the two streams&mdash;I therefore
landed among them, to satisfy their curiosity, and to distribute
a few presents before I proceeded up it; we were obliged to use
the four oars to stem the current against us, but as soon as we
had passed the mouth, got into deeper water and found easier
pulling. The parallel in which we struck it and the direction
from which it came, combined to assure me that this could be no
other than the Darling. To the distance of two miles it retained
a breadth of one hundred yards and a depth of twelve feet. Its
banks were covered with verdure, and the trees overhanging them
were of finer and larger growth than those on the new river by
which we had approached it. The waters had a shade of green and
were more turbid than those of its neighbour but they were
perfectly sweet to taste.<br>
<br>
"Having satisfied myself on those points on which I was anxious,
we returned to the junction to examine it more closely.<br>
<br>
"The angle formed by the Darling with the new river is so acute
that neither can be said to be tributary to the other, but more
important circumstances upon which it is impossible for me to
dwell at the present moment, mark them as distinct Rivers which
have been formed by nature for the same purposes in remote and
opposite parts of the island. Not having as yet given a name to
the latter, I availed myself of the opportunity of complying with
the known wish of His Excellency the Governor, and at the same
time in accordance with my own feelings as a soldier and
distinguished it by that of '<i>Murray</i>'.<br>
<br>
"It had been my object to ascertain the decline of the vast plain
through which the Murray flows, that I might judge of the
probable fall of the waters of the interior but by the most
attentive observation I could not satisfy myself upon this point.
The course of the Darling now confirmed my previous impression
that it was to the South, which direction it was evident the
Murray also struggled to preserve in the subsequent stages of our
journey down it, from which it was thrown by a range of minor
elevations into a more westerly one. We were carried as far as
139&deg; 40' 00" of longitude without descending below 34&deg;
00' 00" in point of latitude in consequence of which I expected
that the river would ultimately discharge itself, either into St.
Vincent's Gulf or that of Spencer, more specially as lofty ranges
were visible in the direction of them, from the summit of the
hills behind our camp on the 2nd of February, which I laid down
as the Coast line bounding them.<br>
<br>
"A few days prior to the 2nd of February we had passed under some
cliffs of partial volcanic origin and had immediately afterwards
entered a limestone country of the most singular formation. The
river although we had passed occasional rapids of the most
dangerous kind had maintained a sandy character from our first
acquaintance with it to the limestone division. It now forced
itself through a glen of that rock of half a mile in width
frequently striking precipices of more than 20 feet perpendicular
elevation, in which coral and fossil remains were beautifully
embedded. On the 3rd of February it made away to the Eastward of
South in reaches from two to four miles in length. It gradually
lost its sandy bed and became deep, still and turbid; the glen
expanded into a valley, and the alluvial flats which had hitherto
been of inconsiderable size became proportionately extensive. The
Murray increased in breadth to more than four hundred yards, with
a depth of twenty feet of water close into the shore and in fact
formed itself into a safe and navigable stream for any vessels of
the minor class. On the 6th the cliffs partially ceased and on
the 7th they gave place to undulating and picturesque hills,
beneath which thousands of acres of the richest flats extended,
covered however with reeds and apparently subject to overflow at
any unusual rise of the river.<br>
<br>
"It is remarkable that the view from the hills was always
confined, we were apparently running parallel to a continuation
of the ranges we had seen on the 2nd but they were seldom
visible. The country generally seemed darkly wooded, and had
occasionally swells upon it, but it was one of no promise; the
timber chiefly box and pine, being of a poor growth and its
vegetation languid. On the 8th the hills upon the left wore a
black appearance, and the few trees upon them were cut down as if
by the prevailing winds. At noon we could not observe any land at
the extremity of a reach we had just entered; some gentle hills
still continued to form the left bank of the river, but the right
was hid from us by high reeds. I consequently landed to survey
the country from the nearest eminence and found that we were just
about to enter an extensive lake which stretched away to the S.W.
the line of water meeting the horizon in that direction. Some
tolerably lofty ranges were visible to the westward at the
distance of forty miles, beneath which that shore was lost in
haze, a hill which I prejudged to be Mount Lofty bearing by
compass S. 141 W. More to the Northward the country was low and
unbacked by any elevations. A bold promontory which projected
into the lake at the distance of seven leagues ended the view to
the South along the Eastern shore, between which and the river
the land also declined. The prospect altogether was extremely
gratifying and the lake appeared to be a fitting reservoir for
the noble stream which had led us to it.<br>
<br>
"In the evening we passed the entrance but a strong southerly
wind heading us, we did not gain more than nine miles. In the
morning it shifted to the N.E. when we stood out for the
promontory on a S.S.W. course. At noon we were abreast of it
where a line of sand hummocks was a head scarcely visible in
consequence of the great refraction about them, but an open sea
behind us from the N.N.W. to the N.N.E. points of the compass. A
meridian altitude observed here placed us in 35&deg; 25' 15" S.
latitude. At one I changed our course a little to the westward,
and at 4 p.m. entered an arm of the lake leading W.S.W. On the
point at the entrance some natives had assembled, but I could not
communicate with them. They were both painted and armed and
evidently intended to resist our landing. Wishing, however, to
gain some information from them I proceeded a short distance
below their haunt and landed for the night in hopes that being
peaceably disposed, they would have approached the tents, but as
they kept aloof, we continued our journey in the morning. The
water which had risen ten inches during the night had fallen
again in the same proportion and we were stopped by shoals
shortly after starting. In hopes that the return of the tide
would have enabled us to float over them we waited for it very
patiently but were ultimately obliged to drag the boat across the
mud flat of more than a quarter of a mile into deeper water; but
after a run of about twenty minutes were again checked by sand
banks. My endeavours to push beyond a certain point were
unsuccessful, and I was at length under the necessity of landing
upon the south shore for the night. Some small hummocks were
behind us on the other side of which I had seen the ocean from
our morning's position; and whilst the men were pitching the
tents walked over them with Mr. M'Leay to the sea-shore, having
struck the Coast at Encounter Bay, Cape Jervoise bearing by
compass S. 81 W. distant three and four leagues and Kangaroo
Island S.E. extremity S. 60&deg; W. distant from nine to ten.<br>
<br>
"Thirty-two days had elapsed since we had left the depot and I
regretted in this stage of our journey that I could not with
prudence remain an hour longer on the Coast than was necessary
for me to determine the exit of the lake. From the angle of the
channel in which we were a bright sand hill was visible at about
nine miles distant to the E.S.E. which it struck me was the
eastern side of the passage communicating with the ocean. Having
failed in our attempt to proceed further in the boat and the
appearance of the shoals at low water having convinced me of the
impracticability of it, I determined on an excursion along the
sea shore to the southward and eastward, in anxious hopes that it
would be a short one, for as we had had a series of winds from
S.W. which had now changed to the opposite quarter, I feared we
should have to pull across the lake in our way homewards. I left
the camp therefore at an early hour in company with Mr. M'Leay
and Fraser, and at daybreak arrived opposite the sand bank I have
mentioned. Between us and it the entrance into the back water
ran. The passage is at all periods of the tide rather more than a
quarter of a mile in width, and is of sufficient depth for a boat
to enter especially on the offside; but a line of dangerous
breakers in the bay will always prevent an approach to it from
the sea except in the calmest weather, whilst the bay itself will
always be a hazardous place for any vessel to enter under any
circumstances; so that it is to be regretted this discovery can
never be of practical utility.<br>
<br>
"Having however satisfactorily concluded our pursuit we retraced
our steps to the camp and again took the following bearings as we
left the beach, the strand trending E.S.E. &frac12;

<blockquote>"Before setting sail, a bottle was deposited between
four and five feet deep in a mound of soft earth and shells,
close to the spot on which the tent had stood, which contained a
paper of the names of the party, together with a simple detail of
our arrival and departure.<br>
<br>
"It appeared that the good fortune, which had hitherto attended
us was still to continue for the wind which had been contrary
chopped round to the S.W. and ere sun set we were again in the
mouth of the river, having run from fifty to sixty miles under as
much canvas as the boat would bear, and with a heavy swell daring
the greater part of the day.<br>
<br>
"The lake which has thus terminated our journey is from fifty to
sixty miles in length and from thirty to forty in width. With
such an expanse of water I am correct in stating its medium depth
at four feet. There is a large bite on it to the S.E. and a
beautiful and extensive bay to the N.W. At about seven miles from
the mouth of the river its waters are brackish and at twenty one
miles they are quite salt whilst seals frequent the lower parts.
Considering this lake to be of sufficient importance and in
anticipation that its shores will during her reign, if not at an
earlier period be peopled by some portion of her subjects, I have
called it in well meant loyalty '<i>The Lake
Alexandrina</i>'.<br>
<br>
"It is remarkable that the Murray has few tributaries below the
Darling. It receives one however of considerable importance from
the S.E. to which I have given the name of the '<i>Lindesay</i>'
as a mark of respect to my commanding officer and in remembrance
of the many acts of kindness I have received at his hands.<br>
<br>
"Having dwelt particularly on the nature of the country through
which the expedition has passed in the pages of my journal it may
be unnecessary for me to enter into any description of it in this
place further than to observe that we carried the lime stone down
to the very coast and that although the country in the
neighbourhood of the Lake Alexandrina must from local
circumstances be rich in point of soil, the timber upon it is of
stunted size and that it appears to have suffered from drought,
though not to the same extent with the eastern coast. It is
evident however that its vicinity to high lands does not
altogether exempt it from such periodical visitations; still I
have no doubt that my observations upon it will convince His
Excellency the Governor that it is well worthy of a closer and
more attentive examination than I had it in my power to make.<br>
<br>
"In a geographical point of view I am happy to believe that the
result of this expedition has been conclusive and that combined
with the late one it has thrown much light upon the nature of the
interior of the vast island; that the decline of waters as far as
the parallel of 139&deg; E. is to the South and that the Darling
is to the N.E. as the Murray is to the S.E. angle of the coast,
the main channel by which the waters of the central ranges are
thrown or discharged into one great reservoir.<br>
<br>
"Our journey homewards was only remarkable for its labour; in
conclusion therefore it remains for me to add that we reached the
depot on the 23rd of March.<br>
<br>
"Our sugar failed us on the 18th of February, and our salt
provisions in consequence of the accident which happened to the
skiff on the 8th March; so that from the above period we were
living on a reduced ration of flour, and as we took few fish and
were generally unsuccessful with our guns the men had seldom more
than their bread to eat. I regretted to observe that they were
daily falling off and that although unremitting in their
exertions, they were well nigh exhausted ere we reached the
Murrumbidgee.<br>
<br>
"We were from sunrise to five o'clock on the water, and from the
day that we left the depot to that of our return we never rested
upon our oars. We were thirty nine days gaining the dep&ocirc;t
from the coast against a strong current in both rivers, being
seven more than it took us to go down. From the depot to this
station we had seventeen days hard pull making a total of eighty
eight, during which time we could not have travelled over less
than two thousand miles. I was under the necessity of stopping
short on the 10th inst., and of detaching two men for the drays,
which happily arrived on the 17th, on which day our stock of
flour failed us. Had I not adopted this plan, the men would have
become too weak to have pulled up to Pondebodgerry, and we should
no doubt have suffered some privations.<br>
<br>
"This detail I am sure, will speak more in favour of the men
composing the party than anything I can say. I would most
respectfully recommend them all to His Excellency's notice, and I
beg to assure him that during the whole of this arduous journey,
they were cheerful zealous and obedient. They had many harassing
duties to perform, and their patience and temper were often put
to severe trials by the natives of whom we could not have seen

<br>
"I am to refer His Excellency the Governor to Mr. M'Leay for any
more immediate information he may require&mdash;to whom I stand
indebted on many points&mdash;and not less in the anxiety he
evinced for the success of the undertaking than in the

<p>Sturt, in his book,** graphically describes the discovery of
the Murray. After detailing the difficulties and dangers the
party had experienced in their course down the Murrumbidgee, he
says,&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[** "Two Expeditions into the Interior of
Southern Australia," vol. ii.]</p>
<blockquote>"The men looked anxiously out ahead; for the singular
change in the river had impressed on them an idea, that we were
approaching its termination, or near some adventure. On a sudden
the river took a general southern direction, but in its tortuous
course, swept round to every point of the compass with the
greatest irregularity. We were carried at a fearful rate down its
gloomy and contracted banks, and in such a moment of excitement,
had little time to pay attention to the country through which we
were passing. It was, however, observed, that calybeate-springs
were numerous close to the water's edge. At 3 p.m. Hopkinson
called out that we were approaching a junction, and in less than
a minute afterwards, we were hurried into a broad and noble
river.<br>
<br>
"It is impossible for me to describe the effect of so
instantaneous a change of circumstances upon us. The boats were
allowed to drift along at pleasure, and such was the force with
which we had been shot out of the Morumbidgee, that we were
carried nearly to the bank opposite its embouchure, whilst we
continued to gaze in silent astonishment on the capacious channel
we had entered; and when we looked for that by which we had been
led into it, we could hardly believe that the insignificant gap
that presented itself to us was, indeed, the termination of the
beautiful and noble stream, whose course we had thus successfully
followed. I can only compare the relief we experienced to that
which the seaman feels on weathering the rock upon which he
expected his vessel would be struck&mdash;to the calm which
succeeds moments of feverish anxiety, when the dread of danger is
succeeded by the certainty of escape."</blockquote>
<p>It is well that the rapids did not lead to a Niagara at the
junction of the rivers.</p>
<p>"With a despatch to Viscount Goderich, dated April 10th, 1831,
Governor Darling sends Sturt's letter&mdash;which had been
published as a Government Order in Sydney, on May 10th,
1830&mdash;explaining that the delay in sending it was occasioned
by the absence of Captain Sturt, in Norfolk Island, by whom he
had hoped it would have been revised and corrected. The Governor
speaks in high terms of the services of the gallant explorer, and
the importance of his discoveries, and recommends that the
payment of the expenses of the equipment should be
authorized:&mdash;" The value of stores supplied to the first
expedition, 204<i>l</i>. 15<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. Second ditto,
265<i>l</i> 19<i>s</i>. 4&frac34;<i>d</i>."</p>
<p>In writing to Sir George Murray, March 28th, 1831, Governor
Darling refers to the displeasure of the Surveyor-General, Major
Mitchell, at not having been sent out to explore, and intimates
that the other duties of his office must have been neglected had
he been employed on such a service. The despatch
proceeds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I thought at the time, that I had myself rendered
some service, in inducing Captain Sturt and Mr. Cunningham, to
undertake their first expeditions; they certainly, had performed
a most important one in making known two considerable tracts of
country hitherto unexplored and which, in Captain Sturt's case in
particular, was only accomplished by the most persevering
determination to effect his object; and in which he suffered the
severest privations to the great injury of his health. I do not
hesitate to say, that Major Mitchell could not have performed
these services in a more complete or advantageous manner, and I
shall leave you to judge of my disappointment by the despatch
acknowledging the receipt of Captain Sturt's and Mr. Cunningham's
reports, that I was not authorised to express on the part of His
Majesty's Government one word in commendation of the important
services they had rendered.<br>
<br>
"Previous to the receipt of your despatches above alluded to,
Captain Sturt again proceeded as soon as his health permitted, on
a second expedition to the Southward, where his discoveries were
of a very important nature. There still remains much to be done
in that quarter and feeling, as I do, a very warm interest in the
success of the Colony, I would earnestly recommend the subject to
your immediate attention, hoping that such arrangements may be
made for this service, as the importance of it appears to merit .
. . .<br>
<br>
"The last discovery of Captain Sturt is beyond all comparison,
the most important that has ever been made in this Colony, a
water communication having been discovered from the settled
districts to Encounter Bay on the South Coast . . .
."</blockquote>
<p>In a letter, written on his return to London, Sturt thanks
Lord Goderich for approbation of his services, which he had
received in an extract of a despatch sent him by Governor
Bourke.</p>
<p>In a letter to Mr. Hay, February 17th, 1831, Governor Darling
says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"You will excuse me for observing in reference to the
last paragraph of your letter, that you appear to have been
misinformed; precise boundaries being established, beyond which
settlers are not allowed to receive grants or to lease land; but
it is impossible to prevent their sending their cattle to graze
beyond those limits.<br>
<br>
"You will be satisfied of my disposition to encourage settlers to
establish themselves to the Southward, when you are informed,
that an expedition was sent more than twelve months ago, in order
to ascertain the possibility of opening a communication in that
direction&mdash;the result was most satisfactory, but Captain
Sturt, the officer charged with this service, having immediately
after his return been sent to Norfolk Island, I have not yet been
enabled to transmit a complete report of his proceedings. If
interested in this matter, you will find a sketch of his
operations in a Government Order, in the enclosed Gazette, and I
shall be glad to find that the result is satisfactory to
you."</blockquote>
<p>The next intelligence from Lake Alexandrina, after Sturt
visited it, is of a melancholy character&mdash;namely, the murder
by the natives of Captain Barker of the 39th Regiment, who had
been sent to complete the examination of the mouth of the Murray.
The occurrence is described in a printed Government Order of May
23rd, 1831, forwarded to Lord Goderich by Governor Darling, in a
despatch of June 4th, 1831. The Governor had intended sending the
unfortunate officer as Government Resident to New Zealand. The
Order, like the letter, speaks highly of his services, and, after
stating that Captain Barker had shown himself well qualified for
his duties by his conduct at Baffles Bay, goes on to say that the
settlement at King George's Sound, of which he had been in
command,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Having been lately placed under the government of
Western Australia, Captain Barker was requested, when returning
to Sydney, to ascertain whether there was any communication
between the Lake ('Alexandrina') lately discovered by Captain
Sturt, and Gulf St. Vincent . . . .<br>
<br>
"Having ascertained that there was no passage from the Lake into
the Gulf, Captain Barker became anxious to discover whether there
was not a more practicable communication with the sea on the
Southern Coast than the outlet to Encounter Bay, found by Captain
Sturt; and being desirous of examining the shore to the eastward
of the outlet for this purpose, he proposed to some of the party,
being himself unwell at the time, to swim to the opposite side,
which being declined, as they could not take any arms with them,
he secured his compass on his head and swam across. He was
observed after this until he gained the summit of a sand hill,
which he descended, and was not afterwards seen."</blockquote>
<p>The party did not cross over, but, after waiting for
twenty-four hours at a rendezvous appointed by Captain Barker,
returned to their vessel, and proceeded to Cape Jervis. Some of
them, on coming back to the outlet, were informed "by some
natives whom they met at that place that Captain Barker had been
watched on his landing, and followed, without being perceived, by
three natives, who treacherously put him to death, with their
spears, and then threw the body into the sea."</p>
<p>The Rev. Richard Greaves, Vicar of Deddington, Oxfordshire,
and a Mr. James Dixon, jun., write respectively on January 4th
and 7th, 1831, to the Secretary of State, recommending the
formation of a settlement at Lake Alexandrina, for the
transportation of the machine breakers.</p>
<p>When very unwell in London, Sturt writes, January 8th, 1833,
to the Colonial Office, saying,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Under the impression that I shall never be enabled
to complete it, and in hopes that it may some time or other be of
use I forward to yon an unfinished plan of the River Murray. It
is laid down as I accurately traced it by compass, without
reference to daily observations and was only intended as a guide
for a more perfect map. It is, however, a faithful copy of my
field sheets, nor is there a single bend of that tortuous river,
a rock or tributary a creek or a cliff omitted. It may serve as
an office record at least, and I have deeply to regret that I may
never perhaps assist in tracing another."</blockquote>
<p>For interest, adventure, peril, and difficulties manfully
overcome, the expedition down the Murray could not be easily
excelled. Among the number of explorations which have since taken
place, in Australia and other parts of the globe, it is, however,
comparatively forgotten; but the remaining survivor of the party,
now Sir George Macleay, is entitled to be regarded as one of the
most remarkable living heroes of exploration. Considering how
completely the vast regions which he and his comrades were the
first to traverse, have become colonized, it seems an age since
the great feat, in which he bore such a leading part, was
accomplished, and almost incredible that one who took part in it
should still be a hale, active man. His leader, Captain Sturt,
one of the finest of explorers, died on June 16th, 1869, at
Cheltenham, certainly without having received the full reward of
his merits.</p>

<p>C<small>ARRYING</small> out the design of giving the very
earliest particulars extant respecting the different explorations
of Victoria, the despatches, deposited in the Record Office, in
which Major, afterwards Sir Thomas Mitchell's discoveries were
first announced, must now be introduced to the reader. It is
desirable that this should first be done, although Mitchell, like
Sturt, has recorded his explorations in two interesting Volumes,
from which we shall afterwards extract some additional facts and
important descriptions.</p>
<p>Mitchell's investigations leading up to the great expedition,
in which he so completely traversed Victoria, are contained in
the few following extracts which precede his letter narrating its
chief incidents.</p>
<p>In a despatch to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the
Earl of Aberdeen, dated July 19th, 1835, Governor Sir Richard
Bourke states that, "in compliance with the suggestions contained
in Lord Goderich's despatch of 18th March, 1832, the
Surveyor-General (Major Mitchell) accompanied by the Colonial
Botanist, an assistant-surveyor, and twenty-one men, has
proceeded on an expedition into the interior of the Colony for
the purpose of ascertaining the course of the River Darling,"
that "the expense of the equipment may be taken at 944<i>l</i>.
1<i>s</i>. 5&frac12;<i>d</i>." and that "the party was last heard
of on the borders of the located part of Colony beyond Bathurst,
on the 8th May last."</p>
<p>A copy of Major Mitchell's letter of instructions accompanies
the despatch. From this it appears that Mr. James Larmer was
second in command, that the party was ordered to be provisioned
for five months, and to be supplied "with seven horses, fifty
oxen, four drays, two carts, three tents, and two boats." The
object of the expedition was to trace the Darling; and should it
turn out that the stream, the junction of which with the Murray
Sturt discovered, was not that river, Mitchell was also directed
to follow it up. These instructions being carried out, the party
was to return to Sydney by the most convenient route.</p>
<p>In a despatch of October 12th, 1835, Sir Richard Bourke
informs Lord Glenelg of the return of Major Mitchell's expedition
to trace the Darling. The Governor states that, "It seems
probable that the River Darling flows into the Murray at the
point indicated by Captain Sturt, but the fact has not been
determined when Major Mitchell found it necessary to retrace his
steps towards the Colony. It is my intention therefore to employ
another exploring Party to complete what has been left undone."
In a reply of March, 1836, the Secretary of State expresses
approval of this intention, and regret at the loss of Mr. Richard
Cunningham, the Government Botanist, who had wandered from
Mitchell's party and been murdered by the blacks. Enclosed with
the despatch of October 12th, Governor Bourke sent the Supplement
to the "Government Gazette" of September 19th, 1835, containing a
printed copy of Mitchell's report, dated September 4th. The
explorer endeavoured to proceed down the river in boats, but
found it too shallow. He surveyed the river in the vicinity of
Fort Bourke; and Mr. Larmer, the second in command, discovered
the outlet of the waters of the Macquarie into the Darling.</p>
<p>On March 15th, 1836, Sir R. Bourke informs Lord Glenelg that
he has carried out his intention, declared in the despatch of
October 12th, of sending another party to complete the
exploration which had been commenced, and that,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The Surveyor-General has accordingly just left
Sydney for the interior. He is instructed to finish the tracing
of the Darling and upon reaching the Murray into which there is
little doubt the Darling falls, to return by the Murray to the
located parts of the Colony. Sturt, it will be remembered entered
the Murray from the Morrumbidge, and no part of the former river
above that junction has been traced, unless it should have
happened that Messrs. Hume and Hovell crossed upon it in 1824. If
the instructions with which the Surveyor-General is furnished (a
copy is transmitted) be successfully executed, a considerable
addition will be made to the geography of the Colony in the
direction which it is most useful to explore. There is reason to
believe that the country on both banks of the Murray and
generally between the Australian Alps and the Morrumbidgee
contains fine pastoral tracts well watered by streams issuing
from those mountains whose summits in one part are usually
covered with snow. The Eastern side of these mountains is already
celebrated as an admirable grazing country. The downs near Port
Phillip have lately become well known for the excellent pasture
they afford to sheep. The course pursued by Hovell and Hume in
1824 discovered a great extent of rich land. The general feature
and character of the vast extent of country contained within the
course of the Morrumbidgee and the sea from Lake Alexandrina by
Wilson's Promontory and Cape Howe to the 35th parallel of
latitude on the Eastern Coast of New Holland may be in a great
measure finally determined by this expedition. In like manner the
geographical knowledge of a large portion of the country to the
northward of the Morrumbidgee will have been completed by tracing
the Bogan into the Darling and the Darling into the Murray.<br>
<br>
"In the despatch before referred to I stated that a map and copy
of the Surveyor-General's Journal would be immediately forwarded
to your Lordship according to Instructions. I regret to say that
I have not been able to procure a copy from that officer, who has
pleaded other business as the cause of his Journal not being
copied or made out from the notes he took whilst in the
field."</blockquote>
<p>In a despatch of November 15th, 1836, Governor Bourke encloses
the "New South Wales Government Gazette", published at Sydney
November 5th, which contains the following letter to the Colonial
Secretary from Major Mitchell. Sir Richard says, "Major Mitchell
has established the correctness of the surmise of Captain Sturt
that the River Darling ran into the Murray, and he has traced
upwards some part of the latter river from where it is joined by
the Murrumbidgee. He has also gone over and will be able to lay
down and describe a very rich and well watered country, deserving
as he thinks the name of 'Australia Felix'."</p>

<blockquote>"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;Having proceeded into the
interior for the purpose of exploring the further course of the
River Darling to its supposed junction with the River Murray, and
the course of the Murray upwards, according to the instructions I
received in March last; I have now the honor to report the result
of the expedition for the information of His Excellency the
Governor, having this day reached this River with a portion of my
party after a successful and highly interesting journey.<br>
<br>
"When I arrived at Buree (the point whence the last expedition
also left the settled districts) the channels of streams in which
we had then found water, in a season of unusual drought, were
quite dry, and I was informed that below a certain point there
were no ponds, even in the bed of the River Lachlan. My intended
route was the same as that which I wished to have followed last
year, namely:&mdash;to pursue the River as far as Mount Granard
and then travel westward, as the nature of the country permitted,
towards the River Darling.<br>
<br>
"When I reached Mount Granard I found less of a mountain range
extending westward than I had expected, and although we procured
abundance of water on its summit (where I passed a night), and
that numerous hills as promising as it was, in this respect,
appeared to the westward, the season was so extremely dry, that I
considered it safer, with such a party in charge, to rely on the
ponds in the Lachlan, at least some way further; especially as I
had observed from the hills, a branch of that River, as it
seemed, leading in a very favorable direction over the lower
country.<br>
<br>
"After we had descended along the bank of the Lachlan about sixty
miles further, water became very scarce; the natives having a
name for each hole or '<i>quawy</i>'. I was then induced to quit
its banks, on the assurance of an old native that he could find
me water in the direction in which I wished to proceed to the
Darling.<br>
<br>
"At the end of the first day's journey on quitting the Lachlan,
we reached the Northern Channel, but found it dry; and although
the old man procured a few quarts, some miles beyond, we passed
the night without finding any for the cattle; and next morning
the chiefs of a Tribe, then among the hills beyond, came forward
to assure me that all there was dried up. My guide, however
persisted, and was desirous we should go on; but although I was
satisfied that in common seasons I might have found water there,
I thought it might be in too parched a state then after two
seasons of drought.<br>
<br>
"In so precarious an enterprise, as our further progress thus
appeared to be, merely on account of water, I adopted what I
considered the alternative by which we should incur least risk,
namely:&mdash;that of pursuing the course of the Lachlan to the
Murrumbidgee, and that of this River to the Murray, and thence to
survey the Darling upwards with a light party.<br>
<br>
"I must here mention that before I determined on this plan, I had
ascertained from the natives the identity of the River explored
by me last year, with that which joins the Murray from the
Northward. I was consequently desirous to get through the survey
of that barren and unpromising country as soon as possible, in
hopes that in proceeding up the Murray, we might make discoveries
more equal to the expectations raised by such an expedition.<br>
<br>
"On descending the Lachlan, we frequently travelled along its
banks all day without seeing any water in its bed, passing the
night without any; and, near the place where Mr. Oxley buried a
bottle, I travelled three days, and passed two nights, without
finding any, during a ride of one hundred and twenty miles with a
party on horseback. There the Lachlan spreads into several
branches, but these unite a short way below, where we found the
channel as deep and well defined as it was above; and near the
junction of this river with the Murrumbidgee, the water-holes in
its bed were deep and numerous.<br>
<br>
"Relying on Arrowsmith's map (to which I am referred by the
instructions), I passed the junction of the Murrumbidgee with the
Murray without being aware of it. But a branch of the former
River presented so favorable a position for a depot Camp, in
which I wished to leave Mr. Stapylton with the heavy part of our
equipment, that I immediately took it up, leaving there the
drays, boats, and most of the cattle and provisions in that
officer's charge, with eight men, while I proceeded forward with
a lighter party in order to complete the survey of the
Darling.<br>
<br>
"By this arrangement, my party was in better trim to deal with
the savage natives whom we were likely to meet; while the cattle
left at the dep&ocirc;t, and which were already exhausted by a
long journey, were refreshed for continuing it into the Southern
country on my return from the Darling.<br>
<br>
"During my first day's journey from the depot, I made the bank of
the Murray, below the junction of the branch of the Murrumbidgee,
and we subsequently encamped, where the breadth of this river was
165 yards. On the following day we were compelled to make a
detour by an ana-branch of this River, and thus came upon a fine
Lake full sixteen miles in circumference."</blockquote>
<p>A portion of the letter at this point, relating to an
Encounter with the blacks, which was subsequently the subject of
an inquiry before the Executive Council at Sydney, is omitted
from the copy first published. The extract as well as the
proceedings, which have no bearing upon our history, appear in
the "New South Wales Government Gazette" of January 21st,
1837.</p>
<blockquote>"I found the River Darling of considerable width, at,
and for six miles above its junction with the Murray, from which
the backwater extended fifteen miles up. But, above that point,
the channel seemed scarcely so wide as it was where I had
explored it above. It contained so little water, that at my last
camp I stepped across its bed dry shod; a little water only
dropping over the smooth bottom, seemed the effect of the rain
fallen just before. This River exactly resembled the Lachlan in
its woods, course, and in the character of its banks&mdash;the
latter being peculiar to these two Rivers only. The sole
difference is, that the Darling is on a rather larger scale. The
Country, on both banks was of the same barren description as that
I have seen above, or if possible, worse, for the arid red sands
and thick scrubs approached the Banks of the River leaving little
room for grass. As soon, therefore, as I recognized the points of
a range previously intersected, and thus ascertained the identity
of the Upper and Lower Darling, I hastened to rejoin Mr.
Stapylton at the dep&ocirc;t. From the natives we learnt that
other Lakes similar to Lake Benanee existed in the country
northward from the Murray, especially a large one named
'Coniowra';&mdash;and that the Darling tribe came across the
country from that River to the Benanee Lake, without passing
along the Bank of the Darling.<br>
<br>
"As I made the junction of the Rivers Darling and Murray, in
longitude 142&deg; 3' 36" east, or upwards of a degree more to
the eastward, than it appears to be in Arrowsmith's map published
in 1832, my movement from the dep&ocirc;t point will appear less
of a detour on my map, than by that map might be supposed. And
the longitude of the junction of the Murrumbidgee near my
dep&ocirc;t being also more to the eastward than it is in that
map; (being 143&deg; 20' 36" east) I had less reason to regret
the season of drought, which had compelled me to pursue a route
which a previous knowledge of the localities was alone wanting,
to have proved the most eligible for the accomplishment of both
objects of the expedition.<br>
<br>
"I found that Mr. Stapylton and party had remained during the
whole period of my absence unmolested. The waters of the
Murrumbidgee had risen, and the branch on which I had fixed the
dep&ocirc;t was full and flowing&mdash;so that it was necessary,
in order to rejoin that party, to swim our horses across.<br>
<br>
"From the Dep&ocirc;t Camp to the junction of the Murrumbidgee
and Murray, the distance was eight miles over firm ground; and at
two miles below the junction (by the River) I moved the whole
party across the Murray, with a view to proceed up that River,
according to the second part of my instructions.<br>
<br>
"We had not proceeded far up this River before the country on its
banks appeared much better than any we had seen lower down.
Grassy plains extended some way from the river, but were limited
by sand hills, covered with cypress trees and scrub. We crossed
various broad Lagoons apparently the beds of ana-branches of the
River in seasons of high flood. After several days' travelling
(nearly southward) reeds appeared in extensive flats along the
River; and in longitude 143&deg; 40 E., the course of the River
being from the S.E., the reeds extended eastward to the horizon.
The mean distance of the bergs of sand hills covered with pine
which limited the reedy flat, was there about eight miles
across.<br>
<br>
"We soon passed the region of reeds, which gradually disappearing
as we ascended, were replaced by grassy plains.<br>
<br>
"We reached the junction of a River which I took to be that of
the Twisden (or Goulburn) of Mr. Hume, in latitude 35&deg; 19'
43" south, longitude 143&deg; 41' 15" east. A clear grassy hill
which I named Swan Hill, marks this junction, which takes place
close under it. The banks of this River were so soft and steep,
and wood was so scarce there, that the cattle could not be
watered without danger, nor could firewood be procured; on one
frosty night in particular when the river unexpectedly brought us
to a stop, when we had nearly reached the larger one beyond,
whose whole course was distinguished by lines of lofty trees, as
on most Rivers. These, so distinctly different, flowed for many
miles very near each other, each River preserving the same
character throughout.<br>
<br>
"In this vicinity, we came upon a very singular formation,
consisting of numerous Lakes of salt or brackish water, and which
were enclosed by semi-circular ridges on their eastern shores.
The largest of these Lakes was named 'Boga', and was six miles in
circumference. The River floods having reached this by a small
channel, the water in it was sweet, and it was peopled by a very
savage tribe, who refused to give us any information, throwing
spears at Piper, who shot one of them.<br>
<br>
"Beyond 'Boga' Lake we crossed some very fine plains, but the
main channel of the River we were endeavouring to explore, was no
longer accessible nor even visible, from the numerous branches,
and still reaches which intersected the alluvial margin which
appeared to be very broad.<br>
<br>
"Following the general course of the River, we next entered on a
tract remarkable for extensive forests of box, with occasional
intervals of open grassey plain. It was watered by chains of
ponds in deep channels, whose meandering course, through a
perfectly level country, seemed to pursue no particular
direction. From what I afterwards observed on higher plains, I
conclude that these waters are derived from the floods of the
river, and that these, spreading into branches of minor depth,
thus water the level country.<br>
<br>
"Turning more towards the river, we passed alternately over
grassy plains, through belts of lofty Gum trees&mdash;the beds of
broad lagoons. Nearer the river deep reaches of still water cut
off all access to it, so that we could only trace its general
course. The highest point at which we found it accessible before
turning south, being in latitude 35&deg; 55' 35", longitude
144&deg; 35' 38" east.<br>
<br>
"The extreme western point of a range then appearing in the
Southern horizon, I proceeded towards it anxious to know more of
the country back from the River. The view I obtained from that
summit induced me to direct our course southward, with the
intention of returning across the heads of the Murray further to
the Eastward where I hoped the hills might afford me the means of
extending the survey across the adjacent country; I perceived
from the height a distant line of lofty trees, which seemed to
mark the course of another River; beyond were the summits of very
distant hills, verdant plains variegated with clumps, and lines
of trees extending westward to the horizon; the whole seeming
good pasture land.<br>
<br>
"At about thirty miles from the hill, and on the 144th degree of
longitude, we reached a deep but narrow stream, flowing between
high and grassy banks, to the westward, at the rate of one mile
and a half per hour. The aboriginal name of this River is the
'Yarrayne'; the plains beyond it were five miles in breadth and
of the best description. Forests of Black-butted Gum, and
Casuarina, then extended back to the mountains and forest hills;
in these forests, instead of novelty, we found the Blue Mountain
Parrot, and other birds common near Sydney, many of the plants
also which grow in Cumberland.<br>
<br>
"'Barrabungale', a lofty mountain of granite, was the chief point
of the range, but on ascending it, the weather was unfavorable
for my observations; a group of open forest hills were connected
with Barrabungale, they enclosed vallies richly covered with
grass and all well watered. We passed over many fine tracts
sheltered by open forest hills, and crossed various fine streams,
all flowing westward. At length, on the 11th of July, I
discovered the summit of a noble mountain range of broken and
picturesque outline, and by subsequent survey I found that this
was the predominant feature of that vast territory lying between
the River Murray and the Southern Coast, giving birth to numerous
streams of convenient width and constant current, by which the
surrounding country is watered abundantly. These Grampians of the
South are situated between 36&deg; 52' and 37&deg; 38' of south
latitude, and between 142&deg; 25' and 142&deg; 47' of east
longitude the latter being the longitude of Mount William, the
highest and most eastern summit, and on which I passed a night,
vainly hoping that the clouds would rise above it.<br>
<br>
"Situated thus centrically, this lofty mass, so essential to
water the lower country, presents no impediment like the coast
ranges of the settled district to the formation of roads, and the
progress of colonization.<br>
<br>
"The principal river flowing under the north side of these
mountains is the 'Wimmera', which has no steep banks, and appears
to be a very constant stream. I explored its course to the
142&deg; of longitude, when it turned to the north-west, leaving
me in a country covered with circular lakes, in all of which the
water was salt or brackish. These had semicircular ridges on the
eastern side, as in those of Boga, on the Murray, and the land
about them was in general very good and grassy, its mean
elevation above the sea being about 580 feet.<br>
<br>
"From the continued rainy weather the earth was in a very soft
state, and this at length became a most serious impediment to the
progress of the expedition, the party being unable, even with the
greatest exertion, to proceed through the mud, above three miles
a day. But for this, I might have returned at least two months
ago.<br>
<br>
"When we gained the head of a small ravine falling towards the
principal river rising in the Grampians, we found firmer ground,
and our progress was much better, although still occasionally
impeded by the soft and boggy state of the earth.<br>
<br>
"The river, which I named the 'Glenelg', flows first westward,
and then southward, entering the sea at the deepest part of the
bay between Cape Northumberland and Cape Bridgewater. I explored
the last fifty miles of its course in the boats, having left Mr.
Stapylton with a dep&ocirc;t, for I had good reason to hope that
it led to some important estuary; the average width was 100
yards, the mean depth 4 fathoms. In this hope I was, however,
disappointed, for the river terminated in a shallow basin within
the sand hummocks of the coast, the outlet being between two low
rocky heads, but choked up with the sands of the beach.<br>
<br>
"In the higher part of the Glenelg the rock over which it flows
is granite, but after it passes through a ridge of primitive
sandstone covered with forests of iron-bark (and which forms
there a kind of coast range) the banks consist wholly of a
secondary limestone. The soft state of the earth had rendered our
progress by land almost hopeless when I launched the boats on the
Glenelg, but on quitting that river with the party, I succeeded
in recrossing the Iron-bark range with the drays, by following up
a tributary flowing to the Glenelg from the eastward. The
difficulty of this movement was much increased, by numerous
swampy creeks and swamps which we had to cross. The eastern part
of the range is highest, and on the higher parts, where the basis
of the soil is trap-rock, the enormous growth and thickness of
the trees presented a new impediment to the progress of our
drays, the fallen timber covering so much of the surface. The
trees, consisting of Stringy-bark and Blue-gum, were many of them
six feet, and some as much as eight feet in diameter.<br>
<br>
"Beyond this range, which terminates in Cape Bridgewater, I
expected to have found some considerable river entering the sea
at Portland Bay: I found only, however, three small rivers, which
I named the 'Surry', the 'Fitzroy', and the 'Shaw', entering the
bay at different points east of the anchorage.<br>
<br>
"On approaching this hay, situated on what I considered an
unexplored coast, the unwonted sight of houses drew my attention,
and a vessel at anchor. I soon ascertained that Messrs. Henty,
from Swan River, had formed a whaling and farming establishment
there. These gentlemen accommodated me with a small supply of
flour, although the supply for their own establishment was nearly
exhausted.<br>
<br>
"Portland Bay appears to be a good anchorage in all winds, save
those from the S.S.E. It is much better sheltered from the
prevailing winds by the lofty promontory of Capes Bridgewater and
Nelson, than any part of Port Phillip is (which harbour I
reconnoitred from Mount Macedon on the 1st instant), and the
position of two reefs seem favourable for the formation of a
small harbour.<br>
<br>
"I still entertained hopes of finding a good port on that coast,
and should have thoroughly examined it, for an object so
desirable to the valuable and extensive territory I had explored,
but the almost impassable state of the ground, and our very
limited stock of provisions, confined me to the direct line
homewards from Portland Bay, by which I travelled completely
round the Grampians, crossed all the rivers, and determined the
position of the principal heights. I wished much to have examined
'Cadong', which, according to the natives, is a large piece of
water on the coast, westward of Cape Otway. This receives, as
they said, several small rivers which I saw flowing southward,
over the plains from the Australian Pyrenees, a group of very
fine forest hills of considerable height, eastward of the
Grampians. From one of these I observed the eastern shore of a
piece of water, in the direction indicated by the natives.<br>
<br>
"The country on that coast generally, is low, and almost swampy,
but the soil is rich, and the climate being sufficiently moist
and water abundant, it appears better adapted for agriculture on
an extensive scale than any other part of New South Wales. The
soil consists chiefly of decomposed trap or limestone, these
being the rocks immediately below. The whole of the coast country
eastward of Cape Nelson is of volcanic formation, as many
interesting geological phenomena attest; amongst others an
extinct volcano (which I named 'Mount Napier') is not the least
remarkable, having an open crater, and being surrounded with
ashes and scoriae to a distance of two miles around its base.
From the fresh appearance of the lava at the summit, I thought it
might have been in activity within the memory of man, but I could
not find any allusion to fire in the aboriginal name
(Murr&ograve;wan).<br>
<br>
"We encountered much soft ground near Mount Napier, and by the
time the party attained the southern extremity of the Grampians
most of the cattle were exhausted, and one poor animal died in
the shafts. Some weeks of repose were absolutely necessary, and
this, our stock of provisions did not admit of; on the contrary,
I could only hope that they would last to the end of the journey,
by allowing the men a very reduced ration.<br>
<br>
"Having some spare cattle, I decided on proceeding in advance
with a light party, and a month's provisions, leaving the rest to
refresh for two weeks, with a part under Mr. Stapylton, whom I
provided with two months' provisions, that he might at the end of
two weeks follow my track at leisure, through Australia Felix. I
hoped thus, by proceeding faster, to survey and reconnoitre the
country with more freedom; and also to reach the Colony in time
to send back a supply of provisions to meet Mr. Stapylton on the
banks of the Hume.<br>
<br>
"My route homeward from the vicinity of the Australian Pyrenees
passed through a country of the most varied and fascinating
description. At intervals of fifty or sixty miles, we crossed
ranges of granite, through all of which I found passes for the
carts across the very lowest parts, by reconnoitring the ranges
as far as possible in advance. The districts between the
different ranges consisted of excellent land, thickly covered
with the Danthonia grass, and well watered.<br>
<br>
"I hoped to have met with some advanced station before we reached
the Murrumbidgee, but although we did not, we were fortunate in
finding a way for the carts to this point, unobstructed by
mountains or swamps. It is near the station of Mr. Tompson, a
gentleman who has accommodated me with a supply of provisions, to
be sent back to the other party to-morrow. We reached this
station on the third day after our supply had been exhausted.<br>
<br>
"I have succeeded in working a continual chain of triangles along
the heights between Cape Nelson and the banks of this river,
thereby connecting my work on that coast with the survey of the
Colony.<br>
<br>
"I trust that the results of this expedition will prove
satisfactory to his Majesty's Government, considering the various
difficulties surmounted, and the elements with which I have had
to contend. Besides establishing the fact of the identity of the
Upper and Lower Darling, it has been in my power, under the
protection of Providence, to explore the vast natural resources
of a region more extensive than Great Britain, equally rich in
point of soil, and which now lies ready for the plough in many
parts, as if specially prepared by the Creator for the
industrious hands of Englishmen.<br>
<br>
"I have much pleasure in stating that I have had reason to be
well satisfied with the zeal and perseverance of Mr. Stapylton on
all occasions. It will be seen by this report, and more fully by
my journal, how well I could rely upon both.<br>
<br>
"All the men of the party have behaved well, and are returning in
safety, with one exception, James Taylor, who was unfortunately
drowned in endeavouring to swim a horse across a swampy river on
the 13th instant.<br>
<br>
"I beg leave to bring also under his Excellency the Governor's
notice, 'Piper', an aboriginal native of Bathurst, who has
accompanied me throughout this eventful journey, and has proved a
valuable auxiliary, as will appear in almost every page of my
journal.</blockquote>

<p>We shall now give some of the leading particulars from the
explorer's work,* in which are mentioned the names of places on
the route and the dates when they were reached, which, for the
most part, are omitted from the first letter describing the
results of the expedition.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mitchell's Eastern Australia, vol. ii.
Published in London in 1838.]</p>
<p>It was on June 13th, 1836, that the Murray was crossed just
below its junction with the Murrumbidgee, the position of which
had been ascertained the day before by Mr. Stapylton. The course
of the expedition was next directed up the Victorian banks of the
Murray, the camp on the evening of the 20th being pitched at Swan
Hall,&mdash;so named on account of the party having been
disturbed at night by the noise of these wild fowl in a lagoon
half a mile distant. Next day Lake Boga was discovered. The party
felt the cold of some frosty winter nights, when they could get
no fuel, the thermometer being on one occasion as low as 29&deg;.
Mitchell ascended Mount Hope on the 28th, and next day passed it
on the left, taking a new route towards the inviting region he
had seen from the summit of the mount. On the 30th he ascended
Pyramid Hill, which he thus graphically describes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Its apex consisted of a single block of granite, and
from this the view over the surrounding plains was exceedingly
beautiful as they shone fresh and green in the light of a fine
morning. The scene was different from anything I had ever before
witnessed, either in New South Wales or elsewhere, a land so
inviting and still without inhabitants! As I stood, the first
intruder on the sublime solitude of these verdant plains as yet
untouched by flocks or herds, I felt conscious of being the
harbinger of mighty changes there; for our steps would soon be
followed by the men and animals for which it seemed to have been
prepared."</blockquote>
<p>The Yarrayne, named from the Yarra trees which grew by its
brink, was discovered July 1st, and a temporary bridge
constructed over it, which on the morning of the 3rd, was covered
with four feet of water by an unexpected flood, erroneously
supposed by the explorers to have been caused by snow melting at
the sources of the stream. On the 5th Mitchell's Diary
records:&mdash;"I proceeded with several of the men mounted,
towards the lofty hill to the eastward of our route, the highest
of those I had intersected from Mount Hope and the Pyramid Hill,
its aboriginal name (as I afterwards learnt) being Barrabungale,"
but clouds obstructed the view before the summit was reached. On
the 8th the party encamped on the banks of a stream which
Mitchell named the Loddon, "in latitude 36&deg; 36' 49" S.,
longitude 143&deg; 35' 30" E."</p>
<p>Next day he speaks of the country a little further on in the
following glowing language, "we descended on one of the most
beautiful spots I ever saw,&mdash;The turf, the woods, and the
banks of the little stream which murmured through the vale, had
so much the appearance of a well-kept park, that I felt loth to
break it by the passage of our cart wheels." Having crossed and
named the Avoca, he camped on the 12th on a stream which he
called the Doscasas, and begins the entry in his journal of next
day with another high commendation of the country:&mdash;</p>
<p>"We had at length," says he, "discovered a country ready for
the immediate reception of civilized man, and fit to become
eventually one of the great nations of the earth. Unencumbered
with too much wood, yet possessing enough for all purposes; with
an exuberant soil under a temperate climate; bounded by the
sea-coast and mighty rivers, and watered abundantly by streams
from lofty mountains: this highly interesting region lay before
me with all its features new and untouched as they fell from the
hand of the Creator! Of this Eden it seemed that I was only the
Adam; and it was indeed a sort of paradise to me, permitted thus
to be the first to explore its mountains and streams&mdash;to
behold its scenery&mdash;to investigate its geological
character&mdash;and, finally, by my survey, to develope those
natural advantages all still unknown to the civilized world, but
yet certain to become, at no distant date, of vast importance to
a new people."</p>
<p>Having thus written, Mitchell proceeds to describe an
excursion he made from his camp with six of his men on horseback,
to the mountains which he first sighted on the 11th, and named
the Grampians. Soon after starting the Richardson Creek was
crossed. It derived its name from the involuntary bath which one
of the party had in its waters, shortly after setting out on the
cold frosty morning of the 13th. Of the country it is said, "We
entered . . . . upon one of the finest tracts of grassy
forest-land we had ever seen. The whole country recently crossed
was good, but this was very fine"; and next morning, 14th, he
speaks in equally high terms. "The scenery . . . . the excellent
quality of the soil, the abundance of water, &amp;c., contrasted
strangely with the circumstances of their lying waste and
unoccupied. It was evident that the reign of solitude in these
beautiful vales was near a close; a reflection which in my mind
often sweetened the toils and inconvenience of travelling through
such houseless regions."</p>
<p>The summit of Mount William, named after the King, was reached
after some difficult climbing, and a severe night was passed upon
it. The party had taken only a small supply of food, and were
unable to keep themselves warm around their fire, some of the
sticks of which were frozen at the outer ends. The hardships of
the night were not repaid with the view of the country which the
explorers waited in hope of obtaining in the morning, the weather
proving cloudy. The thermometer stood as low as 27&deg;. The
discoverer of this mountain only makes its greatest height 4500
feet, but it has since been ascertained to be about 1000 feet
higher.</p>
<p>Early on the 16th, they returned to the camp, and next day the
expedition directed its course towards Mount Zero, on the 18th,
discovering the Wimmera, five branches of which were crossed on
the 19th. Next day the leader of the expedition made some
observations with his theodolite from the top of Mount Zero. On
the 22nd Mount Arapiles was reached, and on the 23rd its highest
summit was ascended, from which Mitchell counted twenty-seven
lakes.</p>
<p>A river, called by the natives Nangeela, was discovered July
31st, and named after the Secretary of State for the Colonies,
Lord Glenelg. It was crossed in the boats; and Mitchell, taking a
fortnight's provisions, proceeded next morning with the two boats
down the stream. The first night the party camped on its banks,
and on the following day pursued their course along the Glenelg
by land,&mdash;the country being "the finest imaginable, either
for sheep and cattle or for cultivation." August 11th, the
junction of the Wannon was reached. Mr. Stapylton having been
left in charge of a camp at Fort O'Hare,&mdash;called after
Mitchell's commanding officer, who was killed at the storming of
Badajoz,&mdash;the boats were again launched on the Glenelg,
August 18th, and being provided with supplies for ten days for
seventeen men, proceeded without obstruction down the stream
which was now sixty yards wide. After a row of sixteen miles, the
party camped for the night on the left bank, as they did also on
the following evening, at a point where the river was 101 yards
wide. On the 20th, the boats reached its mouth, with which
Mitchell, who expected to discover a good harbour, was much
disappointed,&mdash;two shallow basins and a sandy bar rendering
it impossible for any but small craft to enter. The return
journey up the Glenelg was begun at two o'clock on the same day,
and the dep&ocirc;t camp at Fort O'Hare reached about that hour
on the 22nd.</p>
<p>August 23rd was spent reconnoitring for a favourable route to
the east for the carts,&mdash;the wet and soft condition of the
soil proving at this, as in earlier and subsequent stages of the
journey, a great obstacle to the progress of the expedition.
Timber was found of "an enormous size on the ranges." "Some of
the trees . . . . were 13 feet, and one as much as 14&frac12;
feet in circumference, and 80 feet no uncommon height. The fallen
timber was of such magnitude as to present a new impediment to
our progress, for we had not previously met with such an
obstruction on any journey."</p>
<p>The expedition moved east from Fort O'Hare on the 24th, taking
the line of the Crawford. On the 26th Piper, Mitchell's faithful
black-fellow, climbing to the top of one of the large trees, by
which progress across the ranges was impeded, perceived near at
hand 'some fine green hills to the south-east', as well as the
sea beyond them. The explorer states that he now with reluctance
altered his course, which had been "until then to the eastward",
but it soon turned out that it was very fortunate he had been
induced to make a detour to the coast. Mount Eckersley was
ascended and named on the 28th; and within the extensive view
commanded from it was "recognized a very conspicuous flat-topped
hill to the northward, which had been previously included in a
series of angles observed on the 12th instant from the valley of
the Wannon, and which" Mitchell "now named Mount Napier. Portland
Bay was distant about fifteen miles."</p>
<p>In its direction the explorer and some of his party now
pursued their course on horseback, leaving, during their absence,
the heavy carts to be extricated from the mud, and the cattle to
enjoy a rest.</p>
<p>The country travelled over became firmer, and a stream named
the Fitzroy was crossed. The explorers were, however, not
fortunate in the locality where they were obliged to halt for the
night.</p>
<p>We shall leave Mitchell himself to describe the events of the
following day, August 29th.&mdash;"Proceeding along the skirts of
the woody ridge on the left in order to avoid swamps, we at
length saw through the trees the blue waters of the sea, and
heard the roar of the waves. My intended way towards the deepest
part of the bay and the hills beyond it, did not lead directly to
the shore, and I continued to pursue a course through the woods,
leaving the shore on our left." A "deep and rapid little river"
was then met, a short distance up which was found placed "a sort
of trellis-work of bushes by the natives for the purpose, no
doubt, of catching fish." The party "continuing through a thick
wood, came out at length on the shore of Portland Bay, at about
four miles beyond the little river. Straight before lay
Laurence's Island, or rather islands," and to the eastward "one
of 'Lady Julia Percy's Isles.'"</p>
<p>And now comes the chief incident of the day, and perhaps the
most interesting of the expedition:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"On reaching the sea shore at this beach, I turned to
observe the face of 'Tommy-Came-last', one of my party, who being
a native from the interior had never before seen the sea. I could
not discover in the face of this young savage, even on his first
view of the ocean, any expression of surprise; on the contrary,
the placid and comprehensive gaze he cast over it seemed fully to
embrace the grand expanse then tor the first time opened to him.
I was much more astonished, when he soon after came to tell me of
the fresh tracks of cattle that he had found on the shore, and
the shoe marks of a white man. He also brought me portions of
tobacco-pipes, and a glass bottle without a neck. That whaling
vessels occasionally touched there, I was aware, as was indeed
obvious from the carcasses and bones of whales on the beach, but
how cattle could have been brought there, I did not understand.
Proceeding round the bay with the intention of examining the head
of an inlet and continuing along the shore as far as Cape
Bridgewater, I was struck with the resemblance to houses that
some supposed grey rocks under the grassy cliffs presented; and
while I directed my glass toward them, my servant Brown said he
saw a brig at anchor; a fact of which I was soon convinced, and
also that the grey rocks were in reality wooden houses. The most
northern part of the shore of this bay was comparatively low, but
the western shore consisted of bold cliffs rising to the height
of 180 feet.<br>
<br>
"We ascended these cliffs near the wooden houses which proved to
be some deserted sheds of the whalers. One shot was heard as we
drew near these sheds, and another on oar ascending the rocks. I
then became somewhat apprehensive that the parties might either
be or suppose us to be, bushrangers, and to prevent if possible
some such awkward mistake, I ordered the men to fire a gun and
sound the bugle; but on reaching the higher ground we discovered
not only a beaten path, but the track of two carts, and while we
were following the latter, a man came towards us from the face of
the cliffs. He informed me in answer to my questions that the
vessel at anchor was the 'Elizabeth of Launceston'; and that just
round the point there was a considerable farming establishment
belonging to Messrs. Henty, who were then at the house. It now
occurred to me that I might there procure a small additional
supply of provisions, especially of flour, as my men were then on
very reduced rations. I therefore approached the house and was
kindly received and entertained by the Messrs. Henty, who as I
then learnt had been established there during upwards of two
years. It was very obvious indeed from the magnitude and extent
of the buildings, and the substantial fencing erected, that both
time and labour had been expended in their construction. A good
garden stocked with abundance of vegetables already smiled on
Portland Bay: the soil was very rich on the overhanging cliffs,
and the potatoes and turnips produced here, surpassed in
magnitude and quality any I had ever seen elsewhere. I learnt
that the bay was much resorted to by vessels engaged in the whale
fishery, and that upwards of 700 tons of oil had been shipped
there that season. I was likewise informed that only a few days
before my arrival five vessels lay at anchor together there and
that the communication was regularly kept up with Van Diemen's
Land by means of vessels from Launceston. Messrs. Henty were
importing sheep and cattle as fast as vessels could bring them
over, and the numerous whalers touching at or fishing there were
found to be good customers for farm produce and whatever else
could be spared from the establishment."</blockquote>
<p>Next day, August 30th, Mitchell proceeded with the theodolite
to a height near Cape Nelson, where he made some observations,
and recognized the high hill previously seen from the westward,
forming the most elevated part of the Rifle range. He now named
this hill Mount Kincaid, after his "old and esteemed friend of
Peninsular recollections." The explorer thus goes on:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Returning to the party at Portland Bay . . . . I was
here accommodated with a small supply of flour by Messrs. Henty,
who having been themselves on short allowance, were awaiting the
arrival of a vessel then due two weeks. They also supplied us
with as many vegetables as the men could carry away on their
horses. Just as I was about to leave the place 'a whale' was
announced, and instantly three boats well manned were seen
cutting through the water, a harpooneer standing up at the stern
of each with oar in hand, and assisting the rowers by a forward
movement at each stroke. It was not the least interesting scene
in these my Australian travels, thus to witness from a verandah
on a beautiful afternoon at Portland Bay the humours of the whale
fishery, and all those wondrous perils of harpooneers and whale
boats of which I had delighted to read as scenes of 'the stormy
north'. The object of the present pursuit was 'a hunchback', and
being likely to occupy the boats for some time I proceeded
homewards."</blockquote>
<p>Mitchell understood that whales sometimes escaped from their
pursuers and ran ashore, when it was too tedious to procure
anything but part of the head. The natives, however, had "taken
to eating the cast-away whales," though they never approached the
whalers, "nor had they ever shown themselves to the white people
of Portland Bay." It had, however, become "their custom to send
up a column of smoke when a whale appears in the bay, and the
whale-fishers happen to understand the signal. This affords an
instance of the sagacity of the natives, for they must have
reflected that by thus giving timely notice a greater number will
be competitors for the whale, and that consequently there will be
a better chance that the whale may run ashore, in which case a
considerable share must fall finally to them."</p>
<p>The explorer remarks that the whale fishers whom he saw were
"fine able fellows", and that "their boats set up on stanchions
on the beach, looked well with oars and in perfect readiness to
dash at a moment's notice into the 'angry surge'." He also says,
"I saw on the shore the wreck of a fine boat which had been cut
in two by a single stroke of the tail of a whale. The men were
about to cast their net into the sea to procure a supply of fish
for us when the whale suddenly engaged all hands."</p>
<p>Different anecdotes have been told in the Colony respecting
the arrival of Major Mitchell at the settlement of the Messrs.
Henty. There is little doubt that the surprise to the explorers,
occasioned by the traces of white men on the shores of Portland
Bay, was similar to that attributed to Robinson Crusoe, when he
beheld human footprints on his desolate island, save that it
inspired no such terror as was experienced by the lonely
cast-away. One story is that the settlers, at first not knowing
what invasion the exploring expedition might be, made ready for
action an old ship's-cannon, of which the infant settlement was
able to boast.</p>
<p>However that may have been, the following is from one who,
though not at Portland when Major Mitchell arrived, doubtless
speaks from the best information. Mr. William Henty, in a speech
on the Progress of Victoria at the Royal Colonial Institute,
April 25th, 1876, said that Mitchell, "hearing from one of the
farming men the name of Henty," rode "up to the blacksmith's
shop, where my brother Edward happened to be engaged mending some
bullock chains; he addressed him, 'My man, can you tell me where
I can find Mr. Henty?' 'Yes', said my brother, 'I can; he is in
the blacksmith's shop mending bullock-chains.'"</p>
<p>Returning towards the rest of their party, on the afternoon of
August 30th, Mitchell and his attendants recrossed, at its mouth,
the little river which he now called the Surry, and encamped for
the night just beyond it. On the morning of the 31st, Mount Clay
was ascended and named, and the Fitzroy recrossed. The water
having risen, Mitchell says, "we were obliged to carry the flour
across on the heads of men wading up to the neck." Mount
Eckersley was also again ascended. The camp was reached about
sunset.</p>
<p>Mitchell found that Piper had killed abundance of
kangaroo&mdash;a fact, says the explorer, at "which I now
rejoiced . . . . on account of the aboriginal portion of our
party, for whose stomachs, being of a savage capacity, quantity
was a more important consideration than quality in the article of
food, and we were then living on very reduced scale of rations.
On my return from such excursions Piper was usually the first to
meet me and assure me of the safety of the party, as if he had
taken care of it during my absence, and I encouraged this sense
of responsibility by giving him credit for the security they had
enjoyed."</p>
<p>September 2nd, 1836, Mitchell's party camped sixteen miles
S.W. of Mount Napier. Two days later the larger of the two boats
was abandoned, as it prevented the boat-carriage from keeping up
with the carts, and besides had sustained considerable injury
during the overland journey of nearly 3000 miles. While the
boat-carriage was being altered, Mitchell ascended Mount Napier,
where he discovered the perfect crater of an extinct volcano.
Near the foot of the mountain a river was crossed and named the
Shaw. The party camped some distance further on without being
able to procure water, although their progress hitherto had been
much impeded by the damp condition of the country.</p>
<p>On the 7th, the whole expedition again moved forward, the
largest boat being left behind, "keel upwards, at the swamp which
had occasioned so much delay." The swamp is described as "the
channel and recipient of the Shaw."</p>
<p>On the 9th, the previous night and the morning having been
clear, Mitchell again ascended Mount Napier, but rain clouds
gathered before timber, which obstructed observations through the
theodolite, could be removed. A view was, however, obtained of
Mounts Abrupt and Rouse, and of Lake Linlithgow. A fourth ascent
of Mount Napier, made next day, was rewarded with "a clear and
extensive view in all directions." September 11th, a "lively
little stream" was reached, which Mitchell concluded was the
principal head of the Wannon, and called it the Grange. He also
named Mount Bainbrigge on the north of it, and Mount Pierrepoint
on the south. The night of the 13th was passed near the extreme
southern point of the Grampians, which was named Mount Sturgeon.
On 14th Mitchell ascended Mount Abrupt, and was delighted with
the view which he obtained.</p>
<p>Finding the cattle much fatigued by the heavy ground through
which they had passed, and that his supply of provisions would
not admit of the delay required to give the weak animals
sufficient rest, Mitchell resolved to go forward himself with a
light party provisioned only for one month, and to leave
sufficient supplies for two months with the remainder of
expedition, which he placed under the command of Mr. Stapylton.
It was, therefore, arranged that those of the cattle which were
unfit to travel should, before resuming their journey, have a
fortnight to recover their condition in the fine pastures of
Western Victoria&mdash;now for the first time grazed by any
stock, save kangaroo. Mitchell therefore, on September 19th, went
"forward with some of the freshest of the cattle drawing the
light carts and boat." Some miles eastward of where he fixed his
encampment for the first night of his journey, he rode to and
ascended a hill, which he called Mount Staveley. East of it ran a
river, to which he gave the classic name of Hopkins&mdash;after
which of the immortal family he does not mention.</p>
<p>September 21st the party travelled "over a country quite
open," in the direction of "the southern extremity of a distant
range named Mammala by the natives." The mountains proved to be
what Mitchell afterwards named the Pyrenees, and the particular
peak, Mount Cole. He speaks in the highest terms of the country.
"To the westward the noble outline of the Grampians terminated a
view extending over vast open plains fringed with forests and
embellished with lakes. . . . Certainly a land more favourable
for colonization could not be found. Flocks might be turned out
upon its hills, or the plough at once set a-going in the plains.
No primeval forests required to be first rooted out here,
although there was enough wood for all purposes of utility and
adorning the country just as much as even a painter could
wish."</p>
<p>On the 23rd, they "perceived the fresh tracts of several
bullocks, a very extraordinary circumstance in that situation."
This day the Pyrenees were reached and Mount Cole ascended by the
explorer. On the 26th Mount Greenock was named, Mitchell making
observations from its summit. He gave the name of the Mameloid
Hills to those with which it was connected, and describes their
formation as peculiar. From Mount Greenock he says, "I enjoyed
such a charming view eastward as can seldom fall to the lot of
the explorers of new countries."</p>
<p>On the 28th, Mitchell says, "We were fast approaching those
summits which had guided me in my route from Mount Cole, a height
then more than fifty miles behind us. . . . I could ride with
ease to the summit of the friendly hill that I had seen from
afar, and found it but thinly wooded on the summit, so that I
could take my angles round the horizon without difficulty. Again
reminded by the aspect of this region, of the Lower Pyrenees and
the pass of Orbaicetta, I named this summit Mount Byng." It is
one of the few places which have not retained the names given
them by Major Mitchell, having afterwards received that of
Alexander, in order that a list, containing a Philip and a
Macedon should not be incomplete. Next day as the party were
proceeding through Expedition Pass a bolt of the boat-carriage
broke. The accident having to be repaired, the explorer utilized
the delay by making, September 30th, "an excursion to the lofty
mountain mass, which appeared about thirty miles to the
southward, in order," he informs us, "to connect my survey with
Port Phillip."</p>
<p>During the ride some streams and a fine country were passed.
"Emus were very numerous on the open downs, and their curiosity
brought them to stare," says Mitchell, "at our horses, apparently
unconscious of the presence of the biped on their backs, whom
both birds and beasts seem instinctively to avoid. In one flock I
counted twenty-nine emus, and so near did these birds come to us
on that occasion, that having no rifle with me, I was tempted to
discharge even my pistol at one, although without effect.
Kangaroo were equally numerous." The singular effect of some
hurricane, which must have recently passed over the trees at the
foot of Mount Macedon, is described: "under every tree of this
forest the earth being covered with broken branches," but "no
whole trees had been blown down."</p>
<p>Mitchell thus describes Mount Macedon:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I ascended without having been obliged to quit my
horse's back, and I found that the summit was very spacious,
being covered towards the south with the tree-fern, and the musk
plant growing in great luxuriance. I saw also besides these many
other plants found at the Illawara on the eastern coast of the
Colony of New South Wales. The summit was full of wambat holes,
and, unlike the side of the mountain by which I had ascended, was
covered with the dead trunks of enormous trees in all stages of
decay. I had two important objects in view in ascending this
hill; one being to determine its position trigonometrically, as a
point likely to be seen from the country to which I was going,
where it might be useful to me in fixing other points; the other
being to obtain a view of Port Phillip, and thus to connect my
survey with that harbour. But the tree-fern, musk-plant brush,
and lofty timber, together shut us up for a long time from any
prospect of the low country to the southward, and it was not
until I had nearly exhausted a fine sunny afternoon in wandering
round the broad summit, that I could distinguish and recognize
some of the hills to the westward; and when I at length obtained
a glimpse of the country towards the coast, the features of the
earth could scarcely be distinguished from the sky or sea,
although one dark point looked more like a cape than a cloud, and
seemed to remain steady. With my glass I perceived that water lay
inside of that cape, and that low plains extended northward from
the water. I next discovered a hilly point of land outside of the
cape or towards the sea; and on descending the hill to where the
trees grew less thickly, I obtained an uninterrupted view of the
whole piece of water. As the sun went down, the distant horizon
became clearer towards the coast, and I intersected at length two
capes; also one at the head of the bay, and several detached
hills. I perceived distinctly the course of the Exe and Arundell
rivers, and a line of mangrove-trees along the low shore. In
short, I at length recognized Port Phillip and the intervening
country around it, at a distance afterwards ascertained to be
upwards of fifty miles from Indented Head, which proved to be the
first cape I had seen; that outside being Point Nepean, on the
east of the entrance to this bay. At that vast distance I could
trace no signs of life about this harbour. No stockyards, cattle,
nor even smoke, although at the highest northern point of the
bay, I saw a mass of white objects which might have been either
tents or vessels."</blockquote>
<p>It is strange that Mitchell does not mention, and still more
so if he were not aware of, the existence of the settlements at
Port Phillip. That of Batman had been established fifteen months
before the Major's ascent of Mount Macedon; and if he knew
nothing about it on leaving Sydney, in March, 1836, it is
extraordinary that he should not have heard from the Messrs.
Henty, who were in constant communication with Launceston, of the
proceedings of Batman and Fawkner, and of vessels being employed
importing sheep to Port Phillip. Mr. William Henty suggests to
the author that this was because no one then looked on the
parties at Port Phillip "as permanent settlers", but "at the most
as prospectors merely; and the impression would still remain, in
people's minds that it was a barren place . . . . which had been
abandoned by the Government party" in Collins' time.</p>
<p>But to proceed with the passage from which we have
digressed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I perceived a white speck which I took for breakers
or white sand on the projecting point of the north-eastern shore.
On that day nine years exactly, I first beheld the heads of Port
Jackson, a rather singular coincidence. Thus the mountain on
which I stood became an important point in my survey, and I gave
it the name of Mount Macedon, with reference to Port Phillip.**
It had been long dark before I reached the base of this mountain
and picked out a dry bit of turf on which to lie down for the
night."</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[** In a note is the following:&mdash;"Geboor is
the native name of this hill, as since ascertained by my friend
Captain King, and is a much better one."]</p>
<p>The morning of October 1st being cloudy, Mitchell was
prevented from reascending, to extend his observations. On
returning to the camp, he found the boat-carriage repaired. Next
day, Sunday, being wet, the party did not move; but on the 3rd
continued their homeward journey. A stream running northward was
passed, named the Barnard, which Mitchell had no doubt was one he
had crossed on his excursion to Mount Macedon. A fine fall of
upwards of sixty feet was discovered in it and named the Cobaw.
On the 5th the Campaspe was with some difficulty crossed. Next
day they reached the summit of the range near Mount Campbell,
which had partly bounded the view eastward from Mount Byng. The
entire journey of October 7th was along a valley watered by a
creek named D&eacute;egay by the natives. Mitchell describes the
amusing method he adopted that night of getting rid of some of
these people, who were evidently lingering near his camp with
murderous intent. He says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I really was not sorry then to find that they still
continued, for I had made arrangements for having a little
amusement in that case, although their object in lingering there
was nothing less than to kill us when asleep. Accordingly, at a
given signal Burnett suddenly sallied forth, wearing a gilt mask,
and holding in his hand a blue light with which he fired a
rocket. Two men concealed behind the boat-carriage bellowed
hideously through speaking trumpets at the same time, while all
the others shouted and discharged their carbines in the air.
Burnett marched solemnly towards the astonished natives who were
seen through the gloom but for an instant, as they made their
escape and disappeared for ever, but leaving behind them
rough-shaped heavy clubs, which they had made there in the dark
with the new tomahawks we had given them, and which clubs were
doubtless made for the sole purpose of beating out our brains as
soon as we fell asleep. Thus their savage thirst for our blood
only afforded us some hearty laughing. . . ."</blockquote>
<p>October 8th, the explorer saw what he thought might be Mount
Disappointment, and the same day "made the bank of the Goulburn
or Hovell, a fine river, somewhat larger than the Murrumbidgee.
Its banks and bed were firm; the breadth sixty yards." Mitchell
remarks:&mdash;"This river has been unfortunate in obtaining a
variety of names, and therefore less objection can be made to my
preference of the aboriginal, which I ascertained through Piper
to be 'Bay&ugrave;nga'. We already have a river Goulburn in New
South Wales." The cattle were made to swim the stream, the party
and its baggage being conveyed across in the boat. The following
incident illustrates the tameness of indigenous creatures on
first coming in contact with white men, and the unpleasant
necessities sometimes imposed upon the latter by failing
provisions. On October 11th, Mitchell records:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"On our way an emu ran boldly up to us, apparently
desirous of becoming acquainted with our horses; when close to us
it stood still and began quietly to feed like a domestic fowl, so
that I was at first unwilling to take a shot at the social and
friendly bird. The state of our flour, however, and the
recollection of our one remaining sheep already doomed to die, at
length overcame my scruples, and I fired my carbine but missed.
The bird ran only a little distance however, and soon returned at
a rapid rate again to feed beside us when, fortunately perhaps
for the emu, I had no more time to spare for such sport then and
we proceeded."</blockquote>
<p>It is evident that the explorer had not the heart to take
correct aim, or to fire a second shot at this confiding bird.</p>
<p>On the 13th one of the men, James Taylor, was drowned in
trying to cross a swampy stream on horseback. Piper dived and
brought up the body, but life could not be restored and the
remains were interred amidst the sincere grief of the party.</p>
<p>On the 14th they camped about a mile and a half beyond a pass
in what the explorer named Futter's Range.</p>
<p>The Ovens were reached on the 15th, "just below the junction
of a rather smaller stream", which Mitchell took to be King's
River. Wangaratta now stands in this locality. Conveying the
party over in the boat and swimming the cattle and horses across,
the camp was established that night on the east bank of the
Ovens. That river was forty-seven yards wide, the King, at the
junction, being nearly as much.</p>
<p>Whilst the camp was being formed on the 16th the leader rode
forward to a hill from which he had a commanding view, observing
that the W. and N.W. "horizon was broken by one remarkable hill,
which, as he afterwards learnt, was named Ding&eacute;e." He
recognized in the S. and S.E. some of the snowy peaks, naming
"the most lofty mass Mount Aberdeen." He says that, "in the two
rivers we had recently passed," the map of Hovell and Hume
"seemed wonderfully correct."</p>
<p>The Murray was reached October 17th; but the same difficulty
which Hume and Hovell had experienced in approaching the main
stream, in consequence of the number of lagoons which surrounded
it, impeded the crossing of Mitchell's expedition. The explorer
ascended "a low but remarkable hill", near where he struck the
river; it was "probably the lowest hill of granite on the
Murray." He named it Mount Ochtertyre.</p>
<p>The 18th was spent in discovering a favourable crossing-place,
and swimming the cattle over the stream. The process was tedious,
but was effected with the loss of only one beast. Mitchell and
most of his party spent the night on the Sydney side of the
river; and the remainder, with the horses and carts, crossed on
the following morning, the landing-place being at the base of a
red cliff. The Murray was here eighty yards wide. On the Sydney
side, "the wheels of a gig, drawn by one horse, and accompanied
by others, were found by Piper, but they were some months old."
Mitchell was "convinced that no station existed then in the
immediate neighbourhood."</p>
<p>On the 19th, it is recorded, "We left the boat-carriage on the
left bank, and sunk the boat in a deep lagoon on the right bank,
to remain there until this party should return to the spot with a
stock of provisions for that under Mr. Stapylton." After the
whole party had crossed Archibald McKane, a carpenter,
volunteered to return with any two white men and Tommy Came-last,
to meet Mr. Stapylton on the Goulburn, and to construct rafts of
casks to enable his party to cross that river and the Ovens.
Mitchell gladly accepted the offer, and despatched McKane, Tommy,
and two others fully rationed. The explorer himself and the rest
of his party pushed on towards the Murrumbidgee; the want of
provisions becoming daily more severely felt. At length, on the
23rd, he says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The welcome sight of cattle themselves delighted our
longing eyes, not to mention our stomachs, which were then in the
best possible state to assist our perceptions of the beauty of a
foreground of fat cattle. We were soon surrounded by a staring
herd consisting of at least 800 head of wild animals, and I took
a shot at one; but my ball only made him jump, upon which the
whole body, apparently very wild, made off to the mountains.
Symptoms of famine now began to show themselves in the sullenness
of some of the men, and I most reluctantly consented to kill one
of our poor working animals."</blockquote>
<p>Next day, however, October 24th, they reached a habitation on
the banks of the Murrumbidgee, from which "an old man came to the
door beating the ashes from a loaf nearly two feet in
diameter"&mdash;a goodly damper. He at once supplied the party
with two days' provisions, till they could send across the river,
where several drays had just arrived "from which Mr. Tompson, the
owner, accommodated" Mitchell "with enough to send back to meet
Mr. Stapylton on the banks of the Murray." Having pitched his
tent for two days' rest, the explorer then says, "I wrote a brief
account of our proceedings to the Government," doubtless that in
the letter of October 24th, 1836, given at the beginning of this
chapter.</p>
<p>November 11th, Mr. Stapylton addressed a letter to Major
Mitchell, announcing the arrival of his party on the
Murrumbidgee. He had quitted Lake Repose October 3rd, and reached
the Goulburn on the 17th; McKane, and the men sent back to him,
arrived at his camp on the left bank of that river on the 23rd.
The Murray was reached November 4th, and crossed on the 5th.
Burnett and the party sent back with the provisions, arrived "at
the moment the first boat-load . . . reached the opposite bank of
the Murray."</p>
<p>The whole expedition in due time came to Sydney. Piper's
portrait was taken in the Major's red coat and in a cocked hat
and feather. He afterwards returned to "his own country" near
Bathurst, decorated with that which Australian blackfellows
regard as the grandest badge of distinction&mdash;"a brass plate,
on which he was styled, not as usual, 'king', for he said there
were 'too many kings already', but '<i>Conqueror of the
Interior</i>.'" Tommy Came-first, and Tommy Came-last both wanted
to accompany Mitchell to England, but after intending to take one
of them, he found himself unable to do so, so at length the two
youths departed to their own country; and "both", says Mitchell,
"shed tears when they left my house."</p>
