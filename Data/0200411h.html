<h4><a name="dedication">DEDICATION</a></h4>

<p>To John Oxley Parker, ESQ., of Chelmsford, Essex.<br>
 London, February 10, 1823.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;Feelings of gratitude for your kind attention to me in
the early part of life, have induced me to dedicate to you the
following short Journal of my passage over the Blue Mountains, in the
colony of New South Wales, under the persuasion that it will afford you
pleasure at all times to hear that any of your family have been
instrumental in promoting the prosperity of any country in which they
may reside, however distant that country may be from the immediate seat
of our Government.</p>

<p>Since my return to England many of my friends have expressed a wish
to peruse my Journal. To meet their request in the only practicable or
satisfactory manner, I have consented to its being printed. Devoid as
it is of any higher pretensions than belong to it as a plain
unvarnished statement, it may not be deemed wholly uninteresting, when
it is is considered what important alterations the result of the
expedition has produced in the immediate interests and prosperity of
the colony. This appears in nothing more decidedly than the unlimited
pasturage already afforded to the very fine flocks of merino sheep, as
well as the extensive field opened for the exertions of the present, as
well as future generations. It has changed the aspect of the colony,
from a confined insulated tract of land, to a rich and extensive
continent. [Note 1]</p>

<p>[Note 1: Blaxland did not exaggerate when he referred to the
"important alterations" resulting from his expedition, and he cleverly
sums up the matter in his reference to the "changing of the aspect of
the colony" into a "rich and extensive continent."]</p>

<p>This expedition, which has proved so completely successful, resulted
from two previous attempts. One of these was made by water, by His
Excellency the Governor, in person, whom I accompanied. We ascended the
River Hawkesbury, or Nepean, from above Emu Island, to the mouth of the
Warragomby [Note 2], or Great Western River, where it emerges from the
mountains, and joins itself to that river, from its mouth. We proceeded
as far as it was navigable by a small boat, which is only a few miles
further. It was found to lose itself at different places, almost
entirely underneath and between immense blocks of stones, being
confined on each side by perpendicular cliffs of the same kind of
stone, which sometimes rose as high as the tops of the mountains,
through which it appears to have forced, or worn its way, with the
assistance, probably, of an earthquake, or some other great convulsion
of nature.</p>

<p>[Note 2: This river is now known as the Warragamba]</p>

<h5><a name="blax4"></a></h5>

<p align="center"><img src="0200411h-images/0200411h-04.jpg" alt="A view of the steep and rugged Blue Mountains near Katoomba" width="453" height=

<h5>A view of the steep and rugged Blue Mountains near Katoomba
(photograph)</h5>

<p>The other expedition was undertaken by myself, attended by three
European servants and two natives, with a horse to carry provisions and
other necessaries. We travelled on the left, or south bank of the
western river, and found no impediment, by keeping in the cow pastures,
and crossing the different streams of water before they enter the rocks
and precipices close to the river. We were unable, however, to
penetrate westward, finding ourselves turned eastward towards the
coast. We returned sooner than I intended, owing to one man being taken
ill. The natives proved but of little use, which determined me not to
take them again on my more distant expedition, Very little information
can be obtained from any tribe out of their own district, which is
seldom more than about thirty miles square. This journey confirmed me
in the opinion, that it was practicable to find a passage over the
mountains, and I resolved at some future period to attempt it, by
endeavouring to cross the river, and reach the high land on its
northern bank by the ridge which appeared to run westward, between the
Warragomby and the River Grose. I concluded, that if no more
difficulties were found in travelling than had been experienced on the
other side, we must be able to advance westward towards the interior of
the country, and have a fair chance of passing the mountains. On
inquiry, I found a person who had been accustomed to hunt the kangaroo
in the mountains, in the direction I wished to go; who undertook to
take the horses to the top of the first ridge. Soon after I mentioned
the circumstance to His Excellency the Governor, who thought it
reasonable, and expressed a wish that I should make the attempt. [Note
3] Having made every requisite preparation, I applied to the two
gentlemen who accompanied me, to join in the expedition, and was
fortunate in obtaining their consent. Before we set out, we laid down
the plan to be pursued, and the course to be attempted, namely, to
ascend the ridge before-mentioned, taking the streams of water on the
left, which appeared to empty themselves into the Warragomby, as our
guide; being careful not to cross any of them, but to go round their
sources, so as to be certain of keeping between them and the streams
that emptied themselves into the River Grose.</p>

<p>[Note 3: This is proof positive that Blaxland originated the
expedition, and became the leader, Wentworth and Lawson being
associated with him. The ages of the explorers at this time were:
Blaxland 35, Wentworth 19, Lawson 38. The plan devised was destined to
prove successful, and originated with Blaxland. He had evidently
pondered the matter, after his two previous abortive attempts, and had
taken careful notes of the general appearance of this portion of the
country.]</p>

<p>To these gentlemen I have to express my thanks for their company,
and to acknowledge that without their assistance I should have had but
little chance of success.</p>

<p>The road which has since been made deviates but a few rods in some
places from the line cleared of the small trees and bushes and marked
by us. [Note 4] Nor does it appear likely that any other line of road
will ever be discovered than at the difficult and narrow passes that we
were fortunate to discover; by improving which, a good carriage road
has now been made across the mountains. Mount York is the western
summit of the mountains; the Vale Clwyd the first valley at their foot;
from which a mountain (afterwards named Mount Blaxland by His
Excellency Governor Macquarie) is about eight miles, which terminated
our journey.</p>

<p>[Note 4: This is interesting, as it shows that Cox's road followed
very closely on Blaxland's tracks, with the single exception of the
ascent of the first range. (This in reference to the road made by
William Cox under Governor Macquarie's direction.) "Mount
Blaxland"&mdash;This has been identified as that isolated sugar-loaf on the
right bank of the Cox River, distant about 7 miles S.W. from Mount
York. The mountain is very little changed at the present day (1913),
and no doubt presented much the same appearance to Blaxland. Blaxland
is hardly correct in ascribing the naming of this mountain to Governor
Macquarie. The name was bestowed upon it by G. W. Evans, subsequently
confirmed by Governor Macquarie, on arrival at the terminal point of
Blaxland's expedition, which was at Mount Blaxland. Two other smaller
conical shaped hills on the opposite sides of the stream were named
Wentworth and Lawson's Sugar-Loaves respectively, by Evans.]</p>

<p>I remain, dear Sir, most respectfully, Your affectionate Nephew,
GREGORY BLAXLAND.</p>

<h4><a name="journal">BLAXLAND'S JOURNAL</a></h4>

<p>On Tuesday, May 11, 1813, Mr. Gregory Blaxland, Mr. William Went
worth, and Lieutenant Lawson, attended by four servants, with five
dogs, and four horses laden with provisions, ammunition, and other
necessaries, left Mr. Blaxland's farm at the South Creek [Note 5], for
the purpose of endeavouring to effect a passage over the Blue
Mountains, between the Western River, and the River Grose. They crossed
the Nepean, or Hawkesbury River, at the ford, on to Emu Island [Note
6], at four o'clock p.m., and having proceeded, according to their
calculation, two miles in a south-west direction, through forest land
and good pasture, encamped at five o'clock at the foot of the first
ridge. The distance travelled on this and on the subsequent days was
computed by time, the rate being estimated at about two miles per hour.
Thus far they were accompanied by two other gentlemen. [Note 7]</p>

<p>[Note 5: "Blaxland's Farm" was situated on the left bank of South
Creek, about 3 miles (in 1913) from the present township of St. Marys.
The allotment is shown on an early map of the district published in
1808.]</p>

<p>[Note 6: "Emu Island" does not exist at the present day (1913), but
originally it occupied that semi-circular bend of the river about 1
mile north from the railway bridge. Here the stream was shallow enough
to permit of an easy crossing. Approaching the river form a northerly
direction (their track from the farm would lie in a north-westerly
direction), they continued on a diagonal course S.W., and so approached
the first range.]</p>

<p>[Note 7: Names not recorded]</p>

<h5>Blaxland's route across the mountains in 1813 (sketch map)</h5>

<p>On the following morning (May 12), as soon as the heavy dew was off,
which was about nine a.m., they proceeded to ascend the ridge at the
foot of which they had camped the preceding evening. Here they found a
large lagoon of good water, full of very coarse rushes. [Note 8] The
high land of Grose Head [Note 9] appeared before them at about seven
miles distance, bearing north by east. They proceeded this day about
three miles and a quarter, in a direction varying from south-west to
west-north-west; but, for a third of the way, due west. The land was
covered with scrubby brush-wood, very thick in places, with some trees
of ordinary timber, which much incommoded the horses. The greater part
of the way they had deep rocky gullies on each side of their track, and
the ridge they followed was very crooked and intricate. [Note 10] In
the evening they encamped at the head of a deep gully, which they had
to descend for water; they found but just enough for the night,
contained in a hole in the rock, near which they met with a kangaroo,
who had just been killed by an eagle. A small patch of grass supplied
the horses for the night.</p>

<p>[Note 8: The "lagoon" mentioned is (in 1913) a body of fresh water
lying between Glenbrook station and the preset road.]</p>

<p>[Note 9: The bearing given of Grose Head (viz. about 7 miles N. by
E.), evidently from a position near the lagoon, can be checked at the
present day (1913), and a portion of Blaxland's track thus
identified.]</p>

<p>[Note 10: These are the general characteristics of the country in
this locality at the present day (1913).]</p>

<p>They found it impossible to travel through the brush before the dew
was off, and could not, therefore, proceed at an earlier hour in the
morning than nine. After travelling about a mile on the third day, in a
west and north-west direction, they arrived at a large tract of forest
land, rather hilly, the grass and timber tolerably good, extending, as
they imagine, nearly to Grose Head, in the same direction nearly as the
river. They computed it at two thousand acres. Here they found a track
marked by a European, [Note 11] by cutting the bark of the trees.
Several native huts presented themselves at different places. They had
not proceeded above two miles, when they found themselves stopped by a
brushwood much thicker than they had hitherto met with. This induced
them to alter their course, and to endeavour to find another passage to
the westward; but every ridge which they explored proved to terminate
in a deep rocky precipice; and they had no alternative but to return to
the thick brushwood, which appeared to be the main ridge, with the
determination to cut a way through for the horses next day. This day
some of the horses, while standing, fell several times under their
loads. The dogs killed a large kangaroo. The party encamped in the
forest tract, with plenty of good grass and water.</p>

<p>[Note 11: Who was this "European?" Possibly Dawes, Hacking, or
Wilson, although it is mere supposition, as there is no definite record
to go upon.]</p>

<p>On the next morning, leaving two men to take care of the horses and
provisions, they proceeded to cut a path through the thick brushwood,
on what they considered as the main ridge of the mountain, between the
Western River and the River Grose; keeping the heads of the gullies,
which were supposed to empty themselves into the Western River on their
left hand, and into the River Grose on their right. As they ascended
the mountain these gullies became much deeper and more rocky on each
side. They now began to mark their track by cutting the bark of the
trees on two sides. [Note 12] Having cut their way for about five
miles, they returned in the evening to the spot on which they had
encamped the night before. The fifth day was spent in prosecuting the
same tedious operation; [Note 13] but, as much time was necessarily
lost in walking twice over the track cleared the day before, they were
unable to cut away more than two miles further. They found no food for
the horses the whole way. An emu was heard on the other side of the
gully, calling continually in the night.</p>

<p>[Note 12: This was the commencement of the "blazed track", which
method was continued to the termination of their tour at Mount
Blaxland. From this point on the return journey great difficulty was
experienced in finding their way back to the river.]</p>

<p>[Note 13: This additional fatigue told severely on the party.]</p>

<h5><a name="blax6"></a></h5>

<p align="center"><img src="0200411h-images/0200411h-06.jpg" alt="Blue Mountain Scenery--Rodriguez Pass, near Blackheath"></p>

<h5>Blue Mountain Scenery&mdash;Rodriguez Pass, near Blackheath</h5>

<p>On Sunday they rested, and arranged their future plan. They had
reason, however, to regret this suspension of their proceedings, as it
gave the men leisure to ruminate on their danger; and it was for some
time doubtful whether, on the next day, they could be persuaded to
venture farther. [Note 14] The dogs this day killed two small
kangaroos. They barked and ran off continually during the whole night;
and at day-light, a most tremendous howling of native dogs was heard,
who appeared to have been watching them during the night.</p>

<p>[Note 14: This would imply that mutiny was abroad, but evidently the
counsels of the leader were listened to, and the trouble was
overcome.]</p>

<p>On Monday, the 17th, having laden the horses with as much grass as
could be put on them, in addition to their other burdens, they moved
forward along the path which they had cleared and marked, about six
miles and a half. The bearing of the route they had been obliged to
keep along the ridge, varied exceedingly; it ran sometimes in a
north-north-western direction&mdash;sometimes south-east, or due south, but
generally south-west, or south-south-west. [Note 15] They encamped in
the afternoon between two very deep gulleys, on a narrow bridge, Grose
Head bearing north-east by north; and Mount Banks north-west by west.
They had to fetch water up the side of the precipice, about six hundred
feet high, and could get scarcely enough for the party. [Note 16] The
horses had none this night; they performed their journey well, not
having to stand under their loads.</p>

<p>[Note 15: This is where the difficulty of endeavouring to plot the
route of the explorers correctly is encountered. The varied directions
as given, imply that some insurmountable obstacles presented themselves
all through the journey on this day.]</p>

<p>[Note 16: This description tallies with the nature of the country
between Faulconbridge and Linden. The bearings of Grose Head and Mount
Banks (now King George&mdash;1913) would be about correct from this
neighbourhood.]</p>

<p>The following day was spent in cutting a passage through the
brushwood, for a mile and a half further. They returned to their camp
at five o'clock, very much tired and dispirited. The ridge, which was
not more than fifteen or twenty yards over, with deep precipices on
each side, was rendered almost impassable by a perpendicular mass of
rock, nearly thirty feet high, extending across the whole breadth, with
the exception of a small broken rugged track in the centre. By removing
a few large stones, they were enabled to pass. [Note 17]</p>

<p>[Note 17: This ridge may be easily identified as that near Linden
station, now (1913) carrying the present road. Its width tallies with
that described by Blaxland, and there are deep precipices on either
side. The mass of rock still (1913) exists to the east of Linden
station. The old Bathurst road will be found on the top. The northern
end of the ridge has been cut away to allow of the passage of the
present road and railway.]</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the 19th, the party moved forward along this path;
bearing chiefly west, and west-south-east. They now began to ascend the
second ridge [Note 18] of the mountains, and from this elevation they
obtained for the first time an extensive view of the settlements below.
Mount Banks bore north-west; Grose Head, north-east; Prospect Hill,
east by south; the Seven Hills, east-north-east; Windsor, northeast by
east. At a little distance from the spot at which they began the
ascent, they found a pyramidical heap of stones [Note 19], the work,
evidently, of some European, one side of which the natives had opened,
probably in the expectation of finding some treasure deposited in it.
This pile they concluded to be the one erected by Mr. Bass, to mark the
end of his journey. [Note 20] That gentleman attempted, some time ago,
to pass the mountains, and to penetrate into the interior; but having
got thus far, he gave up the undertaking as impracticable; reporting,
on his return, that it was impossible to find a passage even for a
person on foot. Here, therefore, the party had the satisfaction of
believing that they had penetrated as far as any European had been
before them.</p>

<p>[Note 18: This ridge is the one beyond Linden station running N. and
S. From a rocky eminence, the bearings given in the text, will be found
to agree exactly.]</p>

<p>[Note 19: Long known (but erroneously called) as "Cayley's Repulse."
This memorial, or what remains of it (1913) was located on Sept. 6,
1912, by a party of members of the Aust. Historical Society.]</p>

<p>[Note 20: A mistaken impression, as Bass never reached this portion
of the Mountains, judging by his route map and description of the
country. The cairn was more probably erected by Hacking or Wilson.]</p>

<h5>The Obelisk, Mt. York</h5>

<p>They encamped this day to refresh their horses, at the head of a
swamp covered with a coarse rushy grass, with a small run of good water
through the middle of it. [Note 21] In the afternoon, they left their
camp to mark and cut a road for the next day.</p>

<p>[Note 21: This swamp is situated (1913) at the foot of the ridge
beyond Linden station, referred to in Note 18.]</p>

<p>They proceeded with the horses on the 20th nearly five miles, and
encamped at noon at the head of a swamp about three acres in extent,
covered with the same coarse rushy grass as the last station, with a
stream of water running through it. [Note 22] The horses were obliged
to feed on the swamp grass, as nothing better could be found for them.
The travellers left the camp as before, in the afternoon, to cut a road
for the morrow's journey. The ridge along which their course lay now
became wider and more rocky, but was still covered with brush and small
crooked timber, except at the heads of the different streams of water
which ran down the side of the mountain, where the land was swampy and
clear of trees. The track of scarcely any animal was to be seen, and
very few birds. One man was here taken dangerously ill with a cold.
Bearing of the route at first, south-westerly; afterwards
north-north-west, and west-north-west.</p>

<p>[Note 22: Situated about midway between Hazelbrook and Lawson,
probably the source of Hazelbrook Creek.]</p>

<p>Their progress the next day was nearly four miles, in a direction
still varying from north-west-by-north to south-west. They encamped in
the middle of the day at the head of a well-watered swamp, about five
acres in extent; pursuing, as before, their operations in the
afternoon. [Note 23] In the beginning of the night the dogs ran off and
barked violently. At the same time something was distinctly heard to
run through the brushwood, which they supposed to be one of the horses
got loose; but they had reason to believe afterwards that they had been
in great danger&mdash;that the natives had followed their track, and
advanced on them in the night, intending to have speared them by the
light of their fire, but that the dogs drove them off. [Note 24]</p>

<p>[Note 23: Situated in the neighbourhood of Wentworth Falls.]</p>

<p>[Note 24: This was the narrowest escape of annihilation the party
experienced, being the only time they were really exposed to danger
from the attacks of natives.]</p>

<p>On Saturday, the 22nd instant, they proceeded in the track marked
the preceding day rather more than three miles, in a south-westerly
direction, when they reached the summit of the third and highest ridge
of the mountains southward of Mount Banks. [Note 25] From the bearing
of Prospect Hill and Grose Head, they computed this spot to be eighteen
miles in a straight line from the River Nepean [Note 26], at the point
at which they crossed it. On the top of this ridge they found about two
thousand acres of land clear of trees, covered with loose stones and
short coarse grass, such as grows on some of the commons in England.
Over this heath they proceeded for about a mile and a half, in a
south-westerly direction, and encamped by the side of a fine stream of
water, with just wood enough on the banks to serve for firewood. From
the summit they had a fine view of all the settlements and country
eastward, and of a great extent of country to the westward and
south-west. But their progress in both the latter directions was
stopped by an impassable barrier of rock, which appeared to divide the
interior from the coast as with a stone wall, rising perpendicularly
out of the side of the mountain. [Note 27]</p>

<p>[Note 25: The high ridge beyond Wentworth Falls. As a proof that
this is the locality indicated, the spot is due south from Mt. King
George (originally named Mt. Banks).]</p>

<p>[Note 26: A straight line drawn due west from the Nepean would
measure exactly 18 miles, showing how remarkably accurate Blaxland was
on his computation.]</p>

<p>[Note 27: They were by now evidently on the edge of some part of the
precipice overlooking the Kanimbla Valley, between Leura and
Katoomba.]</p>

<p>In the afternoon they left their little camp in the charge of three
of the men, and made an attempt to descend the precipice by following
some of the streams of water, or by getting down at some of the
projecting points where the rocks had fallen in; but they were baffled
in every instance. In some places the perpendicular height of the rocks
above the earth below could not be less than four hundred feet. Could
they have accomplished a descent, they hoped to procure mineral
specimens which might throw light on the geological character of the
country, as the strata appeared to be exposed for many hundred feet,
from the top of the rock to the beds of the several rivers beneath. The
broken rocky country on the western side of the cow pasture has the
appearance of having acquired its present form from an earthquake, or
some other dreadful convulsion of nature, at a much later period than
the mountains northward, of which Mount Banks forms the southern
extremity. The aspect of the country which lay beneath them much
disappointed the travellers: it appeared to consist of sand and small
scrubby brushwood, intersected with broken rocky mountains, with
streams of water running between them to the eastward, towards one
point, where they probably form the Western River, and enter the
mountains.</p>

<p>They now flattered themselves that they had surmounted half the
difficulties of their undertaking, expecting to find a passage down the
mountain more to the northward. [Note 28]</p>

<p>[Note 28: The fact that the party resolved to bear more to the
north, in their endeavours to find a passage down to the lower lands,
is responsible for the accidental arrival on the high tongue of land,
now known as Mt. York. It would have been quite probable, otherwise,
that they would have attempted the descent of the range in the vicinity
of Mt. Victoria pass, where the lay of the country would have presented
less difficulty, as regards the descent, than Mt. York. This discovery,
however, came afterwards, when a more practicable route was discovered,
and the opening of the Victoria Pass in 1832 sealed the fate of the old
Bathurst road in its descent of Mt. York.]</p>

<p>On the next day they proceeded about three miles and a half; but the
trouble occasioned by the horses when they got off the open land
induced them to recur to their former plan of devoting the afternoon to
marking and clearing a tract for the ensuing day, as the most
expeditious method of proceeding, notwithstanding that they had to go
twice over the same ground. The bearing of their course this day was,
at first, north-east and north, and then changed to north-west and
north-north-west. They encamped on the side of a swamp, with a
beautiful stream of water running through it.</p>

<p>Their progress on the next day was four miles and a-half, in a
direction varying from north-north-west to south-south-west: they
encamped, as before, at the head of a swamp. [Note 29] This day,
between ten and eleven a.m., they obtained a sight of the country
below, when the clouds ascended. [Note 30] As they were marking a road
for the morrow, they heard a native chopping wood very near them, who
fled at the approach of the dogs.</p>

<p>[Note 29: Between Medlow Bath and Blackheath. The swamp is still in
existence (1913).]</p>

<p>[Note 30: By "clouds" Blaxland evidently meant to imply the rising
mists from the valley, as they were still coasting along the edge of
the precipice.]</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the 25th, they could proceed only three miles and a-half
in a varying direction, encamping at two o'clock at the side of a
swamp. The underwood being very prickly and full of small thorns,
annoyed them very much. This day they saw the track of the wombat (an
animal which burrows in the ground as a badger, and lives on grass) for
the first time. On the 26th they proceeded two miles and
three-quarters. The brush still continued to be very thorny. The land
to the westward appeared sandy and barren. This day they saw the fires
of some natives below; the number they computed at about thirty&mdash;men,
women, and children. They noticed also more tracks of the wombat. On
the 27th they proceeded five miles and a quarter&mdash;part of the way over
another piece of clear land, without trees [Note 31]; they saw more
native fires, and about the same number as before, but more in their
direct course. From the top of the rocks they saw a large piece of land
below, clear of trees, but apparently a poor reedy swamp. They met with
some good timber in this day's route. [Note 32]</p>

<p>[Note 31: This would answer to the description of the country around
Blackheath (in 1913), as they would now be in this locality.]</p>

<p>[Note 32: This view of the lower lying country would be obtained
from a spot in the neighbourhood of Mt. Victoria.]</p>

<p>The bearing of the route for the last three days has been chiefly
north and north-west.</p>

<h5><a name="blax8"></a></h5>

<h5>The lookout, Mt. York. Known as the "Eddy Rock"</h5>

<p>On the 28th they proceeded about five miles and three-quarters. Not
being able to find water, they did not halt till five o'clock, when
they took up their station on the edge of the precipice. [Note 33] To
their great satisfaction, they discovered that what they had supposed
to be sandy barren land below the mountain, was forest land, covered
with good grass and with timber of an inferior quality. In the evening
they contrived to get their horses down the mountain by cutting a small
trench with a hoe, which kept them from slipping, where they again
tasted fresh grass for the first time since they left the forest land
on the other side of the mountain. They were getting into miserable
condition. Water was found about two miles below the foot of the
mountain. [Note 34] The second camp of natives moved before them about
three miles. In this day's route little timber was observed fit for
building.</p>

<p>[Note 33: The termination of this day's journey brought them out to
the edge of Mt. York. It is quite possible that on observing the
low-lying lands beneath him, Blaxland conceived that he had at length
reached the termination of the main range, and then decided to push on
some distance further, where from one or other of the elevations beyond
he would be able to obtain some idea of the country to the
westward.]</p>

<p>[Note 34: "The Lett River", which was crossed next day. (Named by
Evans, and recorded in his journal as the "Riverlett", meaning the
Rivulet. Hence the present name of this stream.)]</p>

<p>On the 29th, having got up the horses and laden them, they began to
descend the mountain (Mt. York) [Note 35] at seven o'clock through a
pass in the rock, about thirty feet wide, which they had discovered the
day before, when the want of water put them on the alert. [Note 36]
Part of the descent was so steep that the horses could but just keep
their footing without a load, so that, for some way, the party were
obliged to carry the packages themselves. A cart road might, however,
easily be made by cutting a slanting trench along the side of the
mountain, which is here covered with earth. This pass is, according to
their computation, about twenty miles north-west, in a straight line
from the point at which they ascended the summit of the mountains.
[Note 37] They reached the foot at nine o'clock a.m., and proceeded two
miles north-north-west, mostly through open meadow land, clear of
trees, the grass from two to three feet high. They encamped on the bank
of a fine stream of water. [Note 38] The natives, as observed by the
smoke of their fires, moved before them as yesterday. The dogs killed a
kangaroo, which was very acceptable, as the party had lived on salt
meat since they caught the last. The timber seen this day appeared
rotten and unfit for building.</p>

<p>[Note 35: The party evidently returned to the summit of the
mountain, where the camp of the evening of May 28 was formed.]</p>

<p>[Note 36: The first Bathurst road, which passed over Mt. York, was
formed along this pass, and traces of the work are still (1912)
distinctly visible.]</p>

<p>[Note 37: Blaxland is somewhat out in his calculation, as a straight
line drawn from the summit of the first range, above the Nepean,
running N.W., would measure nearer 30 miles&mdash;not 20&mdash;as stated.]</p>

<p>[Note 38: This would bring them to the Lett River at a spot about
1/2 mile south-east of the Hartley Vale road (in 1912)]</p>

<p>Sunday, the 30th, they rested in their encampment. One of the party
shot a kangaroo with his rifle, at a great distance across a wide
valley. The climate here was found very much colder than that of the
mountain or of the settlements on the east side, where no signs of
frost had made its appearance when the party set out. During the night
the ground was covered with a thick frost, and a leg of the kangaroo
was quite frozen. From the dead and brown appearance of the grass it
was evident that the weather had been severe for some time past. We
were all much surprised at this degree of cold and frost in the
latitude of about 34 degrees. The track of the emu was noticed at
several places near the camp.</p>

<h5>Blue Mountain Scenery&mdash;Near Echo point Katoomba</h5>

<p>On the Monday they proceeded about six miles, south-west and west,
through forest land, remarkably well watered, and several open meadows,
clear of trees, and covered with high good grass. They crossed two fine
streams of water. [Note 39] Traces of the natives presented themselves
in the fires they had left the day before, and in the flowers of the
honeysuckle tree scattered around, which had supplied them with food.
These flowers, which are shaped like a bottle-brush, are very full of
honey. The natives on this side of the mountains appear to have no huts
like those on the eastern side, nor do they strip the bark or climb the
trees. From the shavings and pieces of sharp stones which they had
left, it was evident that they had been busily employed in sharpening
their spears.</p>

<p>[Note 39: First, the Lett River, lower down its course, and then the
Cox River, probably near the junction of the two streams, as the old
Bathurst road crossed the latter stream near the junction.]</p>

<p>The party encamped by the side of a fine stream of water, at a short
distance from a high hill, in the shape of a sugar-loaf. [Note 40] In
the afternoon they ascended its summit, from whence they descried all
around, forest or grass land, sufficient in extent in their opinion, to
support the stock of the colony for the next thirty years. This was the
extreme point of their journey. The distance they had travelled they
computed at about fifty-eight miles nearly north-west; that is, fifty
miles through the mountain, (the greater part of which they had walked
over three times,) and eight miles through the forest land beyond it,
reckoning the descent of the mountain to be half-a mile to the
foot.</p>

<p>[Note 40: Probably Lowther Creek, a tributary of the Cox River. The
"sugar-loaf" hill is Mt. Blaxland (named by Evans), and rises above the
stream. Two other conical-shaped hills in the near vicinity were also
named by Evans, Wentworth and Lawson's Sugar-loaves. (The write climbed
this hill Nov., 1912, and probably stood on the very spot where
Blaxland and his party took up their positions, and from where a
magnificent prospect, embracing all points of the compass, is
obtainable.)]</p>

<p>The timber observed this day still appeared unfit for building. The
stones at the bottom of the rivers appeared very fine, large-grained,
dark coloured granite, of a kind quite different from the mountain
rocks, or from any stones which they had ever seen in the colony. [Note
41] Mr. Blaxland and one of the men nearly lost the party to-day by
going too far in the pursuit of a kangaroo.</p>

<p>[Note 41: This is exactly the appearance the river bed presents
today (1913), strewn with large water-worn boulders of dark-coloured
granite.]</p>

<h5>"Caley's Repulse"</h5>

<p>They now conceived [Note 42] that they had sufficiently accomplished
the design of their undertaking, having surmounted all the difficulties
which had hitherto prevented the interior of the country from being
explored, and the colony from being extended. They had partly cleared,
or, at least, marked out, a road by which the passage of the mountain
might easily be effected. Their provisions were nearly expended, their
clothes and shoes were in very bad condition, and the whole party were
ill with bowel complaints. These considerations determined them
therefore, to return home by the track they came. On Tuesday, the 1st
of June, they arrived at the foot of the mountain which they had
descended, where they encamped for the night. The following day they
began to ascend the mountain at seven o'clock, and reached the summit
at ten; they were obliged to carry the packages themselves part of the
ascent. They encamped in the evening at one of their old stations. One
of the men had left his great coat on the top of the rock, where they
reloaded the horses, which was found by the next party who traversed
the mountain [Mt. York]. On the 3rd they reached another of their old
stations. Here, during the night, they heard a confused noise arising
from the eastern settlements below [Note 43], which, after having been
so long accustomed to the death-like stillness of the interior, had a
very striking effect. On the 4th they arrived at the end of their
marked track, and encamped in the forest land where they had cut the
grass for their horses. One of the horses fell this day with his load,
quite exhausted, and was with difficulty got on, after having his load
put on the other horses. The next day, the 5th, was the most unpleasant
and fatiguing they had experienced. The track not being marked, they
had great difficulty in finding their way back to the river, which they
did not reach till four o'clock p.m. [Note 44] They then once more
encamped for the night to refresh themselves and the horses. They had
no provisions now left except a little flour, but procured some from
the settlement on the other side of the river. [Note 45] On Sunday, the
6th of June, they crossed the river after breakfast, and reached their
homes, all in good health. The winter had not set in on this side of
the mountain, nor had there been any frost.</p>

<p>[Note 42: On viewing the wide extent of mountainous country to the
west, which still had to be passed over, Blaxland in view of the
physical condition of the party, and recognising the value of the work
already accomplished, decided to return to the settlement, as it was
hopeless to proceed further. No doubt his disappointment was keen, when
the prospect from the summit of Mt. Blaxland was revealed to him. He
possibly anticipated finding a level stretch of country behind the
range which shut them in after leaving Mt. York, but was soon
undeceived. Under the circumstances Blaxland's decision was a wise one,
and even if he and his party did not complete the entire passage of the
Mountains, they, and they alone, are deserving of the honour which will
ever be theirs of finding a practical passage across the main portion
of this hitherto insurmountable barrier.]</p>

<p>[Note 43: It is difficult to say what this noise was really
occasioned by. It could not have come from the settlements below the
Mountains, as surmised by Blaxland, as was more probably some
underground disturbance. A curious coincidence is afforded in Bass's
journal, where at one period of his journey he recorded the fact that
at a particular spot "he heard the surges roll," as he expressed it.
This was, of course, an utter impossibility, and the origin of the
noise was probably the same as that heard by Blaxland.]</p>

<p>[Note 44: From this point homewards there were no marks on the trees
to guide them.]</p>

<p>[Note 45: In view of the statement concerning the provisions, it
appears that the river was crossed twice by at least one member of the
party, probably by swimming.]</p>

<h4><a name="app2">Appendix 2. GOVERNMENT ORDER</a></h4>

<p>GOVERNMENT HOUSE, SYDNEY, FEB. 12, 1814.</p>

<p>It having been long deemed an object of great importance, by His
Excellency the Governor, to ascertain what resources this colony might
possess in the interior, beyond its present known and circumscribed
limits, with a view to meet the necessary demands of its rapidly
increasing population; and the great importance of the discovery of new
tracks of good soil, being much enhanced by the consideration of the
long-continued droughts of the present season, so injurious in their
effects to every class of the community in the colony: His Excellency
was pleased, some time since, to equip a party of men, under the
direction of Mr. George W. Evans, one of the Assistant Land Surveyors,
(in whose zeal and abilities for such an undertaking he had
well-founded reason to confide,) and to furnish him with written
instructions for his guidance, in endeavouring to discover a passage
over the Blue Mountains, and ascertaining the qualities and general
properties of the soil he should meet with to the westward of them.</p>

<p>This object having been happily effected, and Mr. Evans returned
with his entire party, all in good health: the Governor is pleased to
direct that the following summary of his tour of discovery, extracted
from his own journal, shall be published for general information:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Evans, attended by five men, selected for their general
knowledge of the country, and habituated to such difficulties as might
be expected to occur, was supplied with horses, arms, and ammunition,
and a plentiful store of provisions for a two months' tour. His
instructions were, that he should commence the ascent of the Blue
Mountains, from the extremity of the present known country at Emu
Island, distant about thirty-six miles from Sydney, and thence proceed
in as nearly a west direction as the nature of the country he had to
explore would admit, and to continue his journey as far as his means
would enable him."</p>

<p>On Saturday, the 20th of November last, the party proceeded from Emu
Island; and on the fifth day, having then effected their passage over
the Blue Mountains, arrived at the commencement of a valley on the
western side of them, having passed over several tracks of tolerably
good soil, but also over much rugged and very difficult mountain:
proceeding through this valley, which Mr. Evans describes as beautiful
and fertile, with a rapid stream running through it, he arrived at the
termination of the tour lately made by Messrs. G. Blaxland, W. C.
Wentworth, and Lieutenant Lawson. Continuing in the Western direction,
prescribed in his instructions, for the course of twenty-one days from
this station, Mr. Evans then found it necessary to return; and on the
8th of January he arrived back at Emu Island, after an excursion of
seven complete weeks. During the course of this tour Mr. Evans passed
over several plains of great extent, interspersed with hills and
valleys, abounding in the richest soil, and with various streams of
water and chains of ponds. The country he traversed measured
ninety-eight miles and a half beyond the termination of Messrs.
Blaxland, Wentworth, and Lawson's tour, and not less than one hundred
and fifty miles from Emu Island. The greater part of these plains are
described as being nearly free of timber and brushwood, and in capacity
equal (in Mr. Evans's opinion) to every demand which this colony may
have for an extension of tillage and pasture lands for a century to
come. The stream already mentioned continues its course in a westerly
direction, and for several miles, passing through the valleys, with
many and great accessions of other streams becomes a capacious and
beautiful river, abounding in fish of very large size and fine flavour,
many of which weighed not less than fifteen pounds. This river is
supposed to empty itself into the ocean, on the western side of New
South Wales, at a distance of from two to three hundred miles from the
termination of the tour. From the summits of some very high hills, Mr.
Evans saw a vast extent of flat country, lying in a westerly direction,
which appeared to be bounded at a distance of about forty miles by
other hills. The general description of these hitherto unexplored
regions, given by Mr. Evans, is, that they very far surpass, in beauty
and fertility of soil, any he has seen in New South Wales or Van
Diemen's Land.</p>

<p>In consideration of the importance of these discoveries, and
calculating upon the effect they may have on the future prosperity of
this colony, His Excellency the Governor is pleased to announce his
intention of presenting Mr. Evans with a grant of one thousand acres of
land in Van Diemen's Land, where he is to be stationed as Deputy
Surveyor; and, further, to make him a pecuniary reward from the
Colonial Funds, in acknowledgment of his diligent and active services
on this occasion.</p>

<p>His Excellency also means to make a pecuniary reward to the two free
men who accompanied Mr. Evans, and a grant of land to each of them. To
the three convicts who also assisted in this excursion the Governor
means to grant conditional pardons, and a small portion of land to each
of them, these men having performed the services required of them
entirely to the satisfaction of Mr. Evans.</p>

<p>The Governor is happy to embrace this opportunity of conveying his
acknowledgments to Gregory Blaxland and William Charles Wentworth,
Esqs., and Lieutenant William Lawson, of the Royal Veteran Company, for
their enterprising and arduous exertions on the the tour of discovery
which they voluntarily performed in the month of May last, when they
effected a passage over the Blue Mountains, and proceeded to the
extremity of the first valley, particularly alluded to in Mr. Evans's
Tour, and being the first Europeans who had accomplished the passage
over the Blue Mountains. The Governor, desirous to confer on these
gentlemen substantial marks of his sense of their meritorious exertions
on this occasion, means to present each of them with a grant of one
thousand acres of land in this newly discovered country.</p>

<p>By command of His Excellency the Governor. J. T. CAMPBELL,<br>
 SECRETARY</p>

<h4><a name="app3">Appendix 3. Extract from a letter written by the
late G. B. Barton, 25/7/1889, to Mr. Charles R. Blaxland, of Wollun, a
grandson of the explorer</a></h4>

<p>I am well aware of the facts to which you allude; and so far as I am
concerned I was never under the impression that Wentworth was entitled
to the credit of having led the party over the Blue Mountains. He never
claimed it himself.</p>

<p>I have read his MS. account of the journey, and also Lieut.
Lawson's, but I have not seen Blaxland's. If you can spare me the
printed copy you refer to I will take care of it.</p>

<h4><a name="app4">Appendix 4. Copy of letter written by Frank M.
Bladen, Editor "Historical Records of N.S.W.," 3/3/1904, to Mr. Charles
R. Blaxland, of Wollun, a grandson of the explorer</a></h4>

<p>I have read your letter printed in the "Lithgow Mercury" of the 11th
September, 1903, and bearing on the discovery of a pass over the Blue
Mountains in May, 1813.</p>

<p>I have before me the journals of each of the three men (Gregory
Blaxland, William Lawson, and William Charles Wentworth), who, with
four servants, formed the expedition; so far as these records go, they
serve to prove that Gregory Blaxland was the leader of the party; and I
do not know of any evidence written or traditional which disputes his
claim. There is certainly no reliable evidence which points to
Wentworth as being the leader, nor did he ever claim to have been
so.</p>

<h4><a name="app5">Appendix 5. Copy of letter written by Dr. Houison,
late President, Australian Historical Society, 29/3/1904, to Mr.
Charles R. Blaxland, of Wollun, a grandson of the explorer</a></h4>

<p>I have perused with much interest the papers you left with me, but
more especially the diary of Gregory Blaxland. Before all these,
however, I would place the evidence of William Charles Wentworth
himself as to the question of the leadership of the expedition of 1813.
In his "Statistical Account of the Settlement in Australia," 3rd
edition (1824), page 171, he states: "Of the latter route into the
Transalpine country, Governor Macquarie has left happily on record a
more accurate as well as authentic description in a general order
published by him upon his return from his first visit to that country,
than any I could give from mere memory at this lapse of time. . . . It
strikes me that I cannot do better than insert it verbatim." Then
follows the General Order, dated Government House, Sydney, June 10th,
1815 from which i make the following extracts.</p>

<p>Page 177. "Three miles westward of the Vale of Clwyd, Messrs.
Blaxland, Wentworth, and Lawson had formerly terminated their
excursion," and again on the same page, "In commemoration of their
merits, three beautiful high hills, joining each other at the end of
their tour at this place, have received their names in the following
order, viz., Mount Blaxland, Wentworth's sugar-loaf, and Lawson's
sugar-loaf."</p>

<p>I think this speaks so conclusively that further comment appears to
be unnecessary.</p>
