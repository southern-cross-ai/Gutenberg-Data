<h2>I. &mdash; THE EMPTY STRATOCAR</h2>

<p class="first">AGAINST a sky glorious with flung streamers of
scarlet and purple, New York's leaping towers and arching aerial
streetways traced a prismatic arabesque epitomizing the wonder and
the beauty of the Twenty-first Century. But Don Atkins, his lithe,
compact body poised on big-thewed legs widespread and firmly
planted, was as oblivious to that far-off glory as to the bustle of
the Federal Skyport all about him.</p>

<p>He stood beneath the high loom of the landing trap, squinting
into the west out of slitted eyes from whose corners weather
wrinkles rayed threadlike, and he was conscious of only two
things.</p>

<p>Under the yellow silk of his airman's tunic a small, hard lump
was cold against his breast. It was the talisman of the Silver
Eagle, the throbbing pulse in his temples reminded him, symbol of
the gallant fellowship into whose fold he had been inducted at
last. The secret that for months had lain prickling between him and
his one close friend, Bart Thomas, was a secret no longer. Bart
himself, darting from the distant Pacific, would be here in minutes
now to receive from him the twisting handgrip of the order. In
minutes&mdash;in seconds&mdash;<i>now</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>A siren howled across the field. A black speck notched the low
sun's upper rim. "On time to the dot!" Atkins exclaimed. A white
blur in the air was suddenly a silver, tear-drop shape caught in
the high-reaching fingers of the landing trap's gaunt girders, a
thousand feet above him. The gigantic beam surged down, pivoting on
its huge hinge, perilously fast at first, then more and more slowly
as its hydraulic shock-absorbers sapped the stratocar's incredible
momentum.</p>

<p>Atkins dashed for the spot where the duraluminum-skinned,
man-carrying projectile would ground to end Thomas' half-hour
flight from 'Frisco Skyport.</p>

<p>A knot of brown-garbed mechanics clotted around the tiny car.
Their wrenches clanged against the bolt-heads that had clamped
tight the hatch cover against the airlessness of upper space.
Twirling metal rasped against metal. The shining oval door swung
back. With eager impatience Atkins shoved past the mechanics,
thrust head and shoulders into the aperture.</p>

<p>"Happy landing, old sock," he shouted. "Welcome to&mdash;"</p>

<p>The greeting froze on his lips. The tiny cubicle was unoccupied;
was starkly, staringly vacant. In the heatless light of the ceiling
tube the teleview screen mirrored the Skyport tarmac, glimmered
from the glossy leather of the cushion on which Thomas should have
lain outstretched. But Thomas wasn't there&mdash;</p>

<p>Atkins' skin was a tight, prickling sheath for his body. The
thing was grotesquely, weirdly impossible! Impossible for his chum
to have got out of the stratocar unless someone had unbolted the
hatch from outside. Impossible for it to have landed somewhere so
that that might have been done. To have arrived on the dot of its
schedule the stratocar must never have relented from the uttermost
limit of its speed. Time lost in any halt could not have been made
up.</p>

<p>Impossible for there to have been any halt; the device was
propelled by the blast of an electrostatic catapult at its starting
point and had no power of its own. Once stopped it could not have
taken up its flight again. And it had come straight as an arrow to
the landing-trap's hooks at which 'Frisco had aimed it.</p>

<p>A fleck of white on the cushion caught Atkins' eye. He reached
in, snatched it up. It was a bit of paper, and on it&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Atkins," a peremptory voice battered at his giddy brain,
"Conceal that and bring it to me at once."</p>

<p>The airman thrust the scrap into his pocket, whirled. The
groundmen were crowding in around him, their swarthy countenances
curious, but it was evident that none of them had spoken. Then he
recalled the tiny receiver clamped against the bone behind his ear,
and he knew whence the summons had come.</p>

<p>"This device hasn't been perfected yet," the grey man in the
hidden room had said, "but within the limits of the field I can
speak to you through it secretly and at will." There had been a
view-screen before him, too, whose cosmic-ray eye could scan
anything within fifty miles.</p>

<p>"Close it up," Don Atkins snapped, "and say nothing to anybody."
Then he was running across the long, level tarmac, was dashing up
the broad steps of Flight Headquarters Building, was hurrying
through the interminable maze of corridors within.</p>

<p>The chaos within his skull took on a pattern as the amazing
revelations of his initiation came back to him. The nation dreamed
itself at peace with all the world. The Asafrican Alliance,
Americans fatuously thought, having driven out the white races from
the continents they had so long dominated, wanted nothing but to be
left alone.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THEY reckoned without the driving ambition of
Hung-Chen, the new Genghis Khan, who had forged an irresistible war
machine behind the inscrutable mask of the East and awaited the
auspicious moment to launch it against the Occident and the
Americas. If he could not be stopped, war, rapine, slaughter, must
inevitably destroy the Golden Age to which civilization had at last
attained.</p>

<p>But here was the wall-panel, in a guarded corridor, whose
curious quality he had been taught less than an hour before. Atkins
halted, glanced cautiously left and right. He was unobserved. He
bent to get his lips close against a certain whorl in the blue
tracings with which the marble was figured, whispered a password. A
whirring sound, seeming to come from the very stone itself, told
him that the impact of his voice had set in motion the sound-lock
within. The apparently solid marble slid open and the airman went
through.</p>

<p>The wall thudded shut behind him. In the windowless room he
entered a short, grave-faced man, mouse-like in grey silk, looked
up from his desk.</p>

<p>"Let me see what you found," he said without preamble.</p>

<p>Atkins fumbled in his pocket with shaking fingers, pushed the
paper across the desk to the chief of the Silver Eagle. The red
lines on it leered at him again, the ominous design that had
pronged him with knowledge of the catastrophe that had overtaken
Thomas. A deftly drawn dragon was coiled around the orb of Earth,
one taloned claw sprawling triumphantly to obliterate the double
triangles of the Americas.</p>

<p>The chief's grey face was almost expressionless as he touched
the thing with a fingertip, but under his pale, inscrutable eyes
little muscles twitched uncontrollably.</p>

<p>"The token of Hung-Chen," he said. "Like him to let us know that
he's defeated our last device against his spies."</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" Atkins groaned, mental agony making him
forget rank for the moment. "What does it mean?"</p>

<p>The other's tones were very calm&mdash;only the vaguest flatting
betrayed the despair that must be closing in on him like a
pall.</p>

<p>"It means that the key to the gaps in the West Coast
electro-barrage is in his hands, the only thing he needed to enable
him to strike. Thomas was bringing the plan to Army Headquarters,
and he's got Thomas."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but you said that the Silver Eagle memorizes all its
messages. You said that Hung-Chen's spies had tapped every means of
secret communication we've had and that's why the Sliver Eagle was
organized&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Correct. We thought that a band of glorified couriers, shot
across the continent at a speed greater than any yet known, would
circumvent him. But we've failed. This lets us know that we have
failed. They will get it out of Thomas&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" Atkins' fist pounded down on the desk. "Bart will never
tell. He'll die before he tells."</p>

<p>"He won't die until they know. They'll strip his brain&mdash;"
The chief broke off. "But that may take time. If we can find him
before&mdash;" He ripped a long tape from a machine on his desk. A
straight purple line traced on it wavered at a single point. "Look
here. This deflection in the flight-graph shows that an extra
amount of power was being absorbed between three minutes, twelve
seconds out of 'Frisco and seven minutes, forty-six seconds after
the start. I noticed it and thought that the projectile had swerved
slightly from its course, was taking additional energy to
straighten it out. But it occurs to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, sir?" Atkins demanded, excitedly. "What?"</p>

<p>"That something may have come into the field, there between
three hundred and twenty and seven hundred and seventy miles from
the Pacific, on the great circle course. We might look that region
over."</p>

<p>"I'm going, sir!"</p>

<p>Grey eyes stabbed keenly at the trembling airman.</p>

<p>"You're new, Atkins. I don't know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bart Thomas is my friend, Chief. More than a
brother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very well," the grey man made his decision. "You may go. And
God help you if you are caught. Listen&mdash;"</p>

<hr>

<h2>II. &mdash; THE KAPPA-RAY</h2>

<p class="first">A GREEN light from Traffic Control flashed the
"all clear" signal and Atkins thrust his throttle home. His
gyrocopter leaped straight up from the fields, shot up through the
night past the successive glows of the level markers. The red of
the lumbering freighter-lane, the yellow of the local-flight zone,
the cerulean blue of the five-thousand-foot level in which the
great transoceanic liners plied cometlike; they surged past in his
view-screen, dropped below.</p>

<p>Sunburst came to him from over the bulge of the rounding terrain
as his 'coptor staggered logily. Its roaring vanes could no longer
find any support in the near vacuum of the stratosphere. Atkins
twisted the controls.</p>

<p>The lifting-vanes collapsed into their slotted grooves. The
flyer was a sleek silver fish from whose tail the crimson flame of
rocket gases fanned out. It darted westward, silent and swift as a
bat out of hell.</p>

<p>Atkins throttled down, reluctant but obedient to the chief's
instructions. He must not overtake the sun; darkness would be his
best aid. Two red spots burned bright on his cheeks and secret
fires flickered in his glowing eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm coming, old man," he muttered between his teeth. "I'm
coming, Bart. Stick to it. Don't give in. Don't tell
them&mdash;"</p>

<p>Endlessly blurred Earth streaked underneath him, endlessly the
red position dot drifted with nerve-shredding slowness across the
map framed at the flyer's elbow. He shut off the feed, unfolded
once more the gyrovanes. He drifted down through the darkness,
silent as a cloud in a foggy night and as invisible. A rugged
mountainside, forest-cloaked, swam up into dim view.</p>

<p>Atkins checked the descent, hovered. A twist of his wrist, and
the beam of his kappa-ray projector was searching the serried
carpet of the trees. To the unaided eye that beam was utterly
imperceptible, but on the specially treated screen at which the
airman peered avidly a flickering disc cut through imaged foliage,
through dark underbrush. To the kappa-ray all organic matter is
transparent; only earth, stone, or metal can reflect it and become
visible.</p>

<p>Minutes dragged. Bare ground, only bare ground, netted by
branching streamlets. Then&mdash;what was that?</p>

<p>Atkins held the ray steady, quivering with bowstring tenseness.
An irregular cube of stone showed mistily. A house! A human
habitation in the wilderness! His heart bumped crazily against his
ribs. But&mdash;wait a minute&mdash;it might be a Ranger station, a
depot of the men who patrolled this primeval forest that was
preserved as a national park. Beyond the house a metal
<i>something</i>, huge, curiously formed, bulked vaguely.</p>

<p>Atkins' pulse leaped. He had found that which he sought. Thomas'
captors thought themselves well hidden beneath the leafy screen.
Evidently the kappa-ray was one secret that had been successfully
kept from them.</p>

<p>Lower still Don Atkins dropped, until he was a bare hundred feet
above the treetops. Too bad his search beam could not reveal human
forms. He dared not send the map co-ordinates of this place by
radio. He would be overheard, the gang would be warned and escape.
But at full power it would take him seven minutes to reach 'Frisco
Skyport. Then a hundred pursuit rockets would leap into the air. In
minutes the mountain could be surrounded by well-armed men. He
reached for the throttle.</p>

<p>The sea of foliage, almost black in the long evening shadows,
glowed suddenly into green flame. Just above the strange building
an orange pin-point leaped into existence. An inverted cone of
radiance soared lightning-swift from that focal point. Instantly
the 'copter was bathed in the flare. Intolerable heat struck at
Atkins. The steel walls about him flamed cherry-red. He was frying
in the torrid blast.</p>

<p>Already his senses were leaving him&mdash;with despairing
instinct he thrust at the release lever of the emergency hatch
beneath his seat&mdash;no time to snatch at the parachute cone. He
was falling, falling&mdash;</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">ATKINS lifted slowly back to consciousness. His
body was seared with pain. An iron band constricted his chest and
his blood was salty warm on his lips. A black silence enveloped
him, broken by vague rustlings and the sound of trickling water.
His dazed eyes adjusted themselves to the dimness, and he saw
twisted tree branches, moonlight sifting through leaves all about
him. He was lying across a sturdy, gnarled bough. Above him he
could make out broken branches, a funneled path torn through thick
interlacing foliage.</p>

<p>Slowly it dawned on him what occurred. Plunging down, he had
struck the lofty crown of some forest giant. The smaller branches,
the massed verdure at the top of the tree, had absorbed the force
of his fall. This larger branch had caught and held him, had kept
him from crashing through to the ground.</p>

<p>He had failed miserably. The realization wrenched a groan from
him. Suddenly he tensed, clinging tightly to his bough, listening
acutely. A voice sounded. Heavy bodies threshed through the
underbrush. A yellow glow flickered among the trees below, and was
gone. It came again, held steady as it grew brighter. Two bulking
shadows appeared, forcing through the thick growth. The dim
back-throw of a lantern beat against the dull green of a Ranger's
uniform, familiar to Atkins from hunting and fishing expeditions in
these very woods.</p>

<p>This was luck! Their post could not be far off, with its
radio-phone. He'd chance a coded message to the chief. His throat
tightened to a cautious call&mdash;</p>

<p>The lantern-bearer stumbled, ripped out an oath. It was not in
English! His light found his face. High cheekbones, thick lips,
narrow, slanted eyes. They were Orientals! They were searching for
something!</p>

<p>Of course&mdash;it was him for whom they were looking&mdash;his
body. They wanted to make sure of his death, make sure that his
crumpled form, lying perhaps near a trail, would not betray their
hiding place.</p>

<p>The lantern glow flashed dartingly along the ground, into the
treetops. Atkins tried to make himself a part of the limb. Rough
bark rasped a deep wound in his palm. He flinched uncontrollably,
lost his grip. He was slipping, was falling ... A desperate
tightening of his gripping knees, a flexing of his aching arm
muscles, stopped the disastrous fall. But the leaves still rustled
with his movements.</p>

<p>A sharp challenge ripped the forest silence. A tube in the
yellow hand of one of the searchers spurted blue flame. It shot
through the leaves and its heat, the acrid smoke of seared
greenery, stung Atkins' nostrils. A second bolt came still nearer.
Even if they missed him the light of those ray-tube flashes must
reveal him to the hunters.</p>

<p>"Cut it out, Mingai," the other Asiatic's voice rasped in
English. "It's nothing but a wildcat, or some other animal."</p>

<p>"I do not think so. I do not like that we have not found the
body of the flyer."</p>

<p>"Forget it. He was burned up in the ray."</p>

<p>"The orange ray does not slay. It merely accelerates the
electronic vibration of metallic atoms until the melting point is
reached. But I forget, you would not understand. You are as stupid
about scientific matters as the Americans among whom you have been
raised. You even speak their barbarous tongue better than the
language of your ancestors."</p>

<p>"You give me a pain. Come on, let's get back. We'll tell Fu-Kong
to do his own dirty work."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">"VERY brave, you are, when he cannot hear you,"
Mingai sneered. "But in his presence you cringe and are meek like
the rest of us. No, friend Li-San, we do not return as yet."</p>

<p>"All right, if you're going to be that way. Let's look
further."</p>

<p>"Not till I discover what there is in this tree." Hope died in
Atkins' brain.</p>

<p>"Going to keep on raying till we're spotted by some snooping
Ranger?"</p>

<p>"No, there is a better way." Mingai turned back to the tree. His
cylinder again jetted its blue flame. It was continuous
now&mdash;was boring across the trunk. Back and forth the steady
yellow hand drew the disintegrating beam. The great bole quivered,
started to sway. Atkins got his feet beneath him on the perch,
leaped down.</p>

<p>His aim was true. His heavy boots struck square on Mingai's
shoulder. He felt bone crack beneath the impact of his weight. Even
as the man dropped the American jumped sideward, catlike, his lithe
form twisting in mid-air so that he faced the other Oriental. He
caught a fleeting glimpse of a startled countenance&mdash;then the
saffron face was obliterated by the crashing thud of his fist. He
whirled away, hurtled into the shadowed brush.</p>

<p>Thorned tendrils caught and tore at Atkins. A root tripped him,
and he crashed headlong into a tree trunk. He thudded to the
ground&mdash;lay there&mdash;his tortured lungs laboring&mdash;his
outstretched hands plucking at the earthy loam.</p>

<p>From behind, Atkins heard a thin whistle, shrill almost above
the range of human hearing. From far to his right another,
responding. Evidently the men from whom he had escaped were
signalling for aid. He struggled erect. He was unarmed, alone,
bruised and battered, terribly fatigued. But he knew now that he
could escape by working down the hill, to his left. In the other
direction were desperate men, weapons at their ruthless command
that could whiff him into eternity at will. He turned to the
right.</p>

<hr>

<h2>III. &mdash; THE PURSUIT SQUADRON</h2>

<p class="first">DON ATKINS crouched in the shelter of a bush.
Before him the stone structure he had seen from the air loomed
blackly. Over the clearing a rope network carried a camouflage of
tree branches that his kappa-ray had pierced. He could hear a
murmur of voices, but the sounds came from beyond or within the
squat building.</p>

<p>On the side toward him there was silence, and nothing moved. The
darkness of the wall he faced was relieved by a horizontal line, a
thread of light, almost imperceptible. The American's eyes clung to
it. Then he was crawling across the bare ground that lay between.
Twenty feet of shelterless surface, flecked with the revealing
light of the moon. Could he make it, unobserved?</p>

<p>Inch by crawling inch, every muscle, every nerve, taut with
expectation of a sudden hail, of a blue flash that would sear him
into nothingness, Atkins slid toward the beckoning line of light.
After an eternity, he was in the solid shadow of the wall. He
raised himself cautiously and found the place where the light shone
through. It was the lower edge of a steel-shuttered window, just at
the level of his eyes.</p>

<p>He could not see much of the room within, the aperture was a
mere slit. But what he saw was enough! Just within range of his
vision was a table-top, black, and glistening like glass. Fastened
to its surface, leather straps cutting deep into the flesh of his
arms and legs, was Thomas! His friend's stocky body was stark
naked. In a cold lurid light that beat down, Atkins could see his
knotted muscles writhe snakelike, the sweat of agony gleaming on
his skin.</p>

<p>Thomas' face was deathly white, his clenched teeth were revealed
by lips that curved away, his eyes were closed and his cheek
muscles were quivering. His forehead, his hair, were covered by a
metal helmet, from which wires curled away out of sight.</p>

<p>A low, mechanical hum rose steadily in pitch. Bart Thomas' form
arched slowly up from the table, straining against its creaking
bonds. Suddenly the hum stopped, and the twisted body slumped
flaccidly, inertly, down. A yellow hand, slim, its long fingers
ending in pointed nails, came into view, holding a small sponge to
Thomas' nostrils. The prisoner quivered, his eyes opened, and
Atkins' fists clenched as he read the despair that stared from
them.</p>

<p>He heard a voice, suavely cruel.</p>

<p>"It is very painful, this searching of your brain. If you chose
to talk you would save yourself much anguish."</p>

<p>Atkins' scalp was a tight cap for his skull as the bound man's
eyelids dropped, and lifted again. Even speech seemed too great an
effort for him, but his lips moved. A hand was clamped over Atkins'
mouth, a powerful arm wound around him from behind, pinning his own
arms to his sides. He was lifted from the ground. He drove a
desperate heel backward into a hard shin. Something crashed against
the back of his head and he hung, dazed and barely conscious, in
huge arms that carried his hundred and fifty pounds as though he
were a child.</p>

<p>The room whirled dizzily about Don Atkins. He saw men, a
television screen, a black tube that rose through the ceiling from
some unknown device. He was carried through another door and a
saffron-hued face, lengthened by a wisp of grey beard and drooping
mustachios under a hawk nose, drifted hazily before him. Only the
eyes were clear; black eyes, piercing behind their slanted
lids.</p>

<p>Atkins was set down in a chair. Hands fumbled at him, passed a
rope around him, binding him to his seat. He scarcely noted it,
spellbound by those glittering eyes. His fogged brain cleared a bit
and he saw a tall Oriental, imperturbable. There were banked tubes
glowing behind him, and bright copper coils. To one side, a table,
its black top glistening like glass. Thomas, strapped down, was
looking at him with eyes in which incredulity and horror
flared.</p>

<p>The tall Oriental spoke.</p>

<p>"Who is this, Na-Garri?"</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">FROM behind Don a huge black came in view.
Dressed, like the others of the gang, in the olive-green of the
Rangers, he was still redolent of the jungle. His skin was a deep,
dull black that swallowed light. His bullet head sat queerly on
wide shoulders from which arms thick as saplings hung loosely
almost to his knees. His voice was a throaty rumble.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Lord Fu-Kong. But the electric-eye alarm he
flash, and I find this one peeking in. So I bring him to you. Maybe
he the one who we bring down from the plane, the one who jump on
Mingai and Li-San."</p>

<p>The other nodded.</p>

<p>"Probably. He seems very persistent." To Atkins: "You display a
great deal of interest in our proceedings. I hope you are satisfied
with your present opportunity to observe them."</p>

<p>He reached out a clawlike hand and ripped away the front of the
airman's shirt. He snatched at the token hanging there. The fine
gold chain snapped, and he had it in his hand. A faint smile
crossed the jaundiced mask of his face and he held the tiny bird
out to the black. Not a half inch long it was, but exquisitely
wrought. An eagle, poised as if in flight, it seemed almost
alive.</p>

<p>"See, Na-Garri, this is another of the brood. They wear talismen
about their necks, like your own tribesmen, to bring them good
luck. But I fear the Dragon of Hung-Chen is too strong for their
puny godlet." He turned back to the American. "I shall deal with
you in a moment, when I have finished with your comrade. Watch
closely, American, and I wish you joy of what you see."</p>

<p>Now he was talking to Thomas, and his voice was a crawling
threat.</p>

<p>"Have you decided to answer my questions?"</p>

<p>"No!" Thomas' voice was a tortured whisper, but his lips closed
tight and firm. Fear and despair drew haggard lines across his
face.</p>

<p>Fu-Kong shrugged, stepped to the wall where a tall slate panel
glittered with switch-points, gages, gleaming ebony wheels.</p>

<p>"Still stubborn. You will not believe me, then, that this
searcher will delve deeper and deeper into the core of your brain
till it wrenches the uttermost secrets of your ego from you. Yet it
was an American who first proved that thought is an electric
process, who first measured the tiny currents that flow along the
nerves. Well, if you must have it&mdash;" His fingers closed on a
lever just above binding posts to which the wires trailing from the
helmet on Thomas' head trailed. "Now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fu-Kong. Fu-Kong," a shrill cry from the outer room stopped
him. "Another plane has appeared above." Atkins forced his head
around. Mingai was in the doorway, his shoulder bandaged, his right
arm in a sling.</p>

<p>"Well, why burst in on me like this?" Fu-Kong was imperturbable.
"Send someone to dispose of the remains."</p>

<p>The other's face was a sickly green. "But it got away," he
gasped.</p>

<p>"It got away?" The phrase was like the purr of an enraged
cat.</p>

<p>"Yes. My broken arm&mdash;I had to use my left&mdash;I missed
with the orange ray, and before I could aim again he was out of
range." Mingai's voice trailed away in an apologetic murmur.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;" the other began, fury breaking through the stony
mask of his face. But again there was an interruption. A sallow
Hindu appeared.</p>

<p>"Master, the plane that escaped is signalling to 'Frisco
Skyport, and their rocket squadron is taking off."</p>

<p>The chief had not failed them! He had sent a following plane
that by great good luck had escaped the Asiatics' lethal ray.
Atkins calculated hastily. In ten minutes now this nest would be
surrounded, the spies captured, Thomas freed and his secret
safe.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">BUT Fu-Kong was snapping peremptory orders. Mingai
and the Hindu had disappeared, Na-Garri was unstrapping Thomas, was
carrying him out. The Oriental leader himself, ray-tube in hand,
was unfastening the rope that bound Atkins.</p>

<p>"Get up and precede me." The spy gestured with his weapon. The
American obeyed, staggering on limbs that were needling with
returning blood. He was through the outer room, his captor close
behind him; was in the open. Straight ahead loomed a monstrous
metal shape. Egg-shaped it was, save for one end that was sliced
off sharply, and there was an opening, man-high, in its side.
Na-Garri was just vanishing within, with his burden. Atkins
followed. Fu-Kong clanged shut the slide behind him.</p>

<p>A steel ladder mounted through a dim green light, curving over
an inner shell. Atkins' head came through a trapdoor above, and he
was in a low, long chamber. Then he was once more tightly bound. A
rough shove from the black sent him sliding across the floor to
thud against Thomas' trussed and naked form.</p>

<p>Li-San was just closing the trapdoor. Mingai, fear in his eyes,
was thrusting up on a valve-handle that projected from a large
vertical pipe in the wall. At the far end, before a large
view-screen, the Hindu was seated, black discs of phone receivers
clamped to his ears. Beside him Fu-Kong bent over a serried row of
gages and levers atop a metal console. A large view-screen before
him showed the forest-bordered clearing and the stone building that
had been vacated in such haste.</p>

<p>Fu-Kong pushed at a lever, and the view-screen was a flare of
flame. It cleared. Where the house had been was a gaping hole in
the ground. The Oriental's hand moved again. The screen was a
down-rushing blur. It cleared once more. Velvet-black, star-strewn,
the night sky was about them, and the far-below forest was a dark,
mysterious sea.</p>

<p>"Don, old man," the whispering voice in his ear was Thomas',
"how on earth did you ever get into this mess?"</p>

<p>"I came to find you," Atkins said grimly. "And I did. How are
you?"</p>

<p>"Pretty rocky. But I'll keep until Fu-Kong gets a chance to work
on me again."</p>

<p>"I can't understand how he ever got hold of you. Your carrier
came in right to the dot. What happened?"</p>

<p>"I was zipping along, watching the U. S. shoot past in the
screen, when suddenly something flashed over me and dropped down in
front."</p>

<p>"Shot over you! I thought the rocket-stratocars were the fastest
things ever produced."</p>

<p>"So did I, until I saw this craft. I'll bet it can make three
hundred miles a minute. It passed me as if I were standing still.
At any rate, there it was, right ahead of me, and slowing. The
blunt end was toward me, and I thought sure I was going to crash
into it. No way to swerve those carriers, you know. But just as I
reached it, a hole opened and I sailed right inside."</p>

<p>"Good Lord! Then it's a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A sort of flying trap. Damned ingenious, eh? I can figure out
the rest of it now. You say the stratocar reached New York on time?
That means they closed the stern and speeded up again till they
were making just the rate I was. Afterward they went faster once
more, got clear of my boat and dropped away. They had just picked
me out of it on the fly.</p>

<p>"All I knew at the time was that my hatch opened, and the big
black was pointing a ray-gun at me. He told me to get out, and I
got. We were in an air-lock, and there was a rope ladder hanging
down. I climbed it and found myself in this room. Fu-Kong was here,
and the Hindu. Then in a little while we were down in the clearing,
where the others were waiting. After that my troubles really
began&mdash;Look at the screen!" he said sharply.</p>

<p>Atkins twisted himself back to his original position. In the
distance a score of scarlet lights made a dancing crescent on the
view-screen. They rose and fell, but came on steadily. He thrilled
at the sight. These were the army flyers from 'Frisco Skyport. No
mistaking that formation.</p>

<p>Those far-spreading wings would sweep around as the center
checked, and the Asafrican craft would be caught in an enfilading
fire. Fu-Kong and his gang were doomed! Peculiar how calmly they
were taking it. Eastern fatalism, he supposed.</p>

<p>Eastern fatalism, hell! Memory fanged him! Thomas had just told
of the incredible speed at Fu-Kong's command. The spy master was
not trapped, far from it. He could get away at will. Why was he
hanging here motionless, watching those oncoming flyers, a sardonic
smile tingeing his yellow face?</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer the lights came. The dim shapes of the army
rocket-planes showed, phantomlike. The central ship dipped,
minutely, and the long line began to expand. The motley crew of the
spy ship clustered behind their leader in the bow.</p>

<p>"Near enough." Fu-Kong's voice rang like a sentence of doom. A
long pencil of orange light shot out from his vessel, wavered,
impinged on the nearest plane. The flyer flared red, then dazzling
white, at the tip of the beam. Then&mdash;there was nothing there.
The death ray moved on to the next in line.</p>

<p>All along that far-flung line a coruscation of green swept, as
the indomitable fighters shot out their futile answer. Lethal
enough, those rays, but their range was far short. Another plane
was caught in the orange beam and vanished! Another! But the
squadron came on, their mile-long fire-tails lashing them through
the night.</p>

<p>If one, only one, could get near enough to spear the Asafrican
craft with its beam! Taking that one desperate chance the birdmen
rushed into the face of destruction, never faltering, never
wavering, as ship by ship the orange scythe reaped its deadly
harvest. Only ten ships were left of the score that had first
appeared, only nine&mdash;and still the green rays were miles short
of their mark.</p>

<p>Minutes passed that were long as eternity. Eight of the intrepid
attackers remained, then seven. But now the stabbing darts of
emerald death were almost reaching their mark. A little
more&mdash;only a little more. Suddenly the floor vibrated and
Atkins heard the muted thunder of the craft's rocket blasts. The
spy ship was moving at last.</p>

<p>Fu-Kong would escape&mdash;that was unavoidable. The terrific
speed of his strange vessel could never be matched by the
combination plane-and-rocket-craft of the Americans. But at least
the pitiful handful remaining would escape the holocaust. Seeing
the futility of their courageous attempt they would return to their
base, perhaps effectuate plans for a countrywide encircling
movement that might in the long run bring the yellow ship down.
No&mdash;Atkins' mouth twisted in a soundless oath&mdash;the
Oriental had no intention of permitting that.</p>

<p>The distance between the spy-craft and the nearest attacker did
not increase. The Asiatic was keeping just beyond the range of the
green rays&mdash;was taking toll on the American aviators with
false hope while the merciless orange beam flared out, mowing the
velvet night with destruction.</p>

<hr>

<h2>IV. &mdash; THE DRAGON OF HUNG-CHEN</h2>

<p class="first">OUT of the twenty flyers who had soared to the
attack a bare six still charged on. They were insane! They couldn't
win&mdash;</p>

<p>But couldn't they? Atkins stifled a gasp, was taut with sudden
hope. Five of the squadron's remnant had startlingly changed their
tactics. They were zigzagging, were darting left and right, up and
down, in what seemed a last panicky attempt to evade the Asiatic's
ray.</p>

<p>Senseless, it seemed&mdash;but there was one ship that had left
the group. Its green ray was doused, only the pin-point red of its
tail-flame betrayed its course to Atkins. He flung out his soul in
a wordless prayer that neither Fu-Kong nor his aides would notice
that stealthy climb.</p>

<p>Steadily the squadron leader mounted till the scarlet dot that
marked him out was touching the upper margin of the view-screen.
Ten thousand feet below, his comrades flitted about in their
macabre dance, cheating the orange death again and again by
breathless inches. The attention of the enemy crew was concentrated
on those darting shapes, on their darting, ineffective rays.</p>

<p>Atkins' eyes flicked back to the lone flyer. He saw the sudden
crimson burst, saw the downward curve of its flaring wake as a
terrific swoop began, saw the green ray dart out ahead, spearhead
of the diving hawk. Down and down and down, adding the pull of
Earth to his own driving blasts, the avenger plunged in one last,
magnificent effort to catch the destroyer unaware; zipping faster
and faster until even in that tenuous air the steel plane-body
glowed dull red with the friction of its unleashed speed.</p>

<p>A minute's grace&mdash;sixty unobserved seconds of that
lightning slant&mdash;and it would snip the yellow menace from the
skies.</p>

<p>"Look&mdash;Fu-Kong&mdash;look!" It was Mingai who yelped the
alarm. The orange ray swept up. <i>Jammed.</i> By luck&mdash;by the
luck with which the gods award the greatly daring&mdash;the
down-darting American had found the one vulnerable angle of the spy
ship. Green flame licked out hungrily, but Fu-Kong's hand was
light-quick in its flash to the throttle lever. His ship
lurched&mdash;jerked aside in the last possible moment of
safety.</p>

<p>The American was under, now, right under the spy-craft. But the
dragon ship was driving ahead. In an eye-blink Fu-Kong would be
able to bring his death ray to bear on the daring flyer! Don Atkins
flung heavily across the floor by the sudden jerk, saw, not quite
three feet above him, a gleaming copper handle&mdash;the valve at
which Mingai had twisted just before the take-off.</p>

<p>Legs lashed, arms bound, sweat pouring from his lined brow, eyes
bulging from their sockets, by sheer power of stomach and trunk
muscles alone he swung his torso from the floor. His head came
level with that handle. His teeth clamped around it. Corded sinews
stood out on his neck as he drove the valve lever down. Suddenly he
was snatched loose by a lurch of the craft, and his preposterously
twisted body crashed down.</p>

<p>But that very lurch told him of success! It <i>was</i> the main
fuel-valve! He had cut off the rocket-tube's supply! In an instant,
now, the vessel would be caught in the ray-beam of the pilot below.
Atkins tensed to meet the green flash that would mean oblivion for
Fu-Kong and his myrmidons&mdash;and for Bart Thomas and
himself.</p>

<p>It never came! A shrill, high-pitched oath, footsteps running
toward him, pulled open his eyes. Fu-Kong was bending over him,
face livid with wrath, ray-gun rising for the <i>coup de grâce</i>.
Behind him Li-San came up, a strange glow between his slant lids.
Atkins' eyes flicked past the couple. In this final moment of life
he must know what had happened, why his intended sacrifice had
failed.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">A BLUE electric veil, shimmering and sparking in a
cerulean network of tiny lightnings, curved all across the
view-screen. Beyond it the misty shapes of the attacking aircraft
spat their green beams. The emerald death rays spattered harmlessly
on the ionic curtain, and were quenched. From within, the orange
ray thrust futilely against the hollow, defensive sphere of
force.</p>

<p>This Atkins saw in a single, flashing glance. Then he was
staring up at the enraged Oriental, was waiting in a timeless void
for the blue spurt that would sear thought and consciousness and
life itself from his despairing brain.</p>

<p>"Wait, Master!" Li-San snatched at Fu-Kong's hand, swerved it
aside from its aim. "Wait! That way is too easy for the
pale-skinned dog. Let me and Mingai take care of him. We have a
debt to pay for what he did to us in the wood!"</p>

<p>In the other's slitted eyes a glint of satisfaction showed.</p>

<p>"I had my doubts of you, Li-San. Twice you have shown deplorable
softness in your tasks. This I like much better. You may have your
wish. But take him below&mdash;I have much to do and do not wish to
be disturbed."</p>

<p>Atkins' skin crawled. Death he could face calmly&mdash;but that
which the fanatic gleam in Li-San's saffron mask promised made him
a coward.</p>

<p>"Fu-Kong," he croaked, barely able to force the words through
his constricted throat. "Don't give me to him! Kill me yourself.
That would be clean and honest." But the Oriental was walking
away.</p>

<p>They took him down through the trapdoor, carried him down, flung
him heavily on the plates in the narrow space between the entrance
hatch and the curving inner shell.</p>

<p>"Untie him, Mingai." There was an undercurrent of eager
excitement in Li-San's tones. Even in the face of what was to come,
Atkins wondered at the gratuitous cruelty of the Oriental mind.
Mingai stooped to him, fumbled at his lashings. As they fell away,
the American leaped up to make a fight of it. Hopeless, of course,
Li-San had his ray-gun poised for action. Better to go out that way
than to suffer the planned revenge of the sadistic duo.
Now&mdash;</p>
<img src="1305551h-images/FlightOfTheSilverEagle-02.jpg" style=
"float:right" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
<p>"Hands up, Mingai! Quick!" The virulent threat in Li-San's voice
made the low command seem a crashing shout. Mingai straightened.
His arms flew above a saffron face from which amazement and horror
had stripped its habitual mask. Li-San was braced on spread feet,
his ray-gun thrust before him. His countenance was alight with a
strange flame, and his eyes snapped menace. "One whimper from you
and I flash!"</p>

<p>There was an instant of stunned silence. Then Li-San spoke
again.</p>

<p>"Here, you American! Grab those ropes. Tie him up and gag him.
Quick, man!"</p>

<p>Dazed by the sudden turn, Atkins obeyed. What lay behind this
sudden act on the Asiatic's part? Had he suffered a sudden change
of heart&mdash;He recalled, in the wood, Li-San trying to argue
Mingai out of his determination to search the tree in which he was
hiding. He recalled Li-San's intervention with Fu-Kong a moment ago
that had certainly saved his life&mdash;</p>

<p>His task was finished&mdash;Mingai tightly bound, and a strip
from his own tunic jammed none too gently into his mouth. Before
Atkins could voice his questions there was a sudden dull roar which
shook the vessel.</p>

<p>"He's getting under way again," Li-San barked. "We've no time to
lose." He plucked Mingai's ray-gun from his belt, thrust it into
the American's hand. "Come on!" He was flitting silently up the
ladder, Atkins, perforce, after him.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THEY were just beneath the rivet-studded trap.
Li-San lifted the lid, slowly, till a narrow crack of brighter
light showed along its edge. Atkins managed to crush in alongside
of him on the narrow step, and together they peered through the
slit.</p>

<p>The blue defensive sphere was gone and the attacking ships had
vanished. But something else showed in the sky; a long, slim,
torpedolike object that sped straight for the spy ship. From its
nose a white light flickered in a rapid series of dots and dashes.
Atkins felt an electric quiver of tenseness run through the yellow
man against whose body his own was crushed.</p>

<p>A strange pattern formed itself in the American's mind as he
crouched there, waiting for he knew not what. That oncoming shape
had the very form of the rocket-stratocars used by the Silver
Eagle. Yet this was no messenger, waylaid as Thomas had been. He
had signalled to Fu-Kong. Why had the spy-craft waited here,
chancing the fight with the American planes, when it might have
been away and gone with only the slightest effort? What was it that
glowed from Li-San's eyes, that shook him with an ague of
eagerness?</p>

<p>Nearer came the speeding rocket, and nearer still, until it
passed out of sight at the lower edge of the view-screen. The
larger craft lurched, and lurched again. Fu-Kong thrust at his
levers, there was a hiss of rushing air. Then a buzzer
shrilled.</p>

<p>"He's picking up the stratocar," Li-San whispered. "Get
ready."</p>

<p>"All right, Na-Garri," Fu-Kong called. "The air in the entrance
lock is at normal pressure. Open up."</p>

<p>The black bent to a ring in the center of the floor, and pulled
on it. A round manhole lid came away. A head appeared, and a squat,
broad body followed it.</p>

<p>Straight black hair, tiny black eyes almost hidden by high
cheekbones, broad flat nose over thick, red lips&mdash;this was a
Tatar face, a throwback to the Mongol hordes that in the Thirteenth
Century ruled half the then-known world by force of arms. From that
stocky figure emanated an aura of power, of dominance. Unbounded
ambition, lust for power, savage cruelty, were stamped on the
round, flaccid countenance.</p>

<p>Li-San clutched Atkins' arm, his fingers sinking into the
flesh.</p>

<p>"It's Hung-Chen! Come himself to receive Fu-Kong's reports.
Tomorrow the attack." Atkins understood why the spymaster had been
unable to flee. He had had to wait here for his chief&mdash;no way
to change the course of the stratocar once it had started.</p>

<p>The huge black bowed low. The Hindu joined him in humble
obeisance. The haughty Fu-Kong came away from his controls, abject
servility in every line of his tall body. The Mongol spoke sharply,
and there was a rapid exchange in a shrill, high-piping tongue.</p>

<p>"<i>Now!</i>" The snapped word from Li-San galvanized Atkins
into action. He thrust upon the hatch, leaped. <i>Clang!</i> The
yellow men swung to the sound of the falling trapdoor, saw two
apparitions spring into view, ray-guns at the ready.</p>

<p>"Throw up your hands! Up with them!" Atkins' shout drove through
the chamber. "Up, or we wipe you out!" Li-San's eyes were blazing
pits of wrath. Na-Garri's simian arms went ceilingward, the
Hindu's, Hung-Chen's. Fu-Kong ripped out a virulent, "Traitor!" at
Li-San and snatched at the cylinder in his belt.</p>

<p>"<i>S-s-s-s-s!</i>" Blue lightning hissed from Atkins' weapon. A
blackened corpse crumpled slowly to the floor. "Any more?" His
voice was thick with fury. But the remaining three stood
statuelike. "We surrender," came the voice of the captured
overlord. "Don't flash."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THEIR captives tightly bound, the two&mdash;Don
Atkins, the American, and Li-San, the Chinese, turned to one
another. Atkins' hand went out to the other, then
hesitated&mdash;drew back. Li-San straightened.</p>

<p>"No," he answered the question in the American's eyes, "I am not
a traitor to my own people. Here," his hand tapped his own breast,
"there are two loyalties&mdash;one to the race among whom I was
born, among whom I have lived my life and have my friends, the
other to the race of my ancestors. War between them was unthinkable
to me." He glanced down at Hung-Chen, bound and glowering, looked
up again, a wistful smile hovering on his saffron face. "Now there
will be no war. I'm sorry I couldn't save the squadron of planes. I
had to wait until <i>he</i> arrived, you see. And it was too
dangerous before to attempt to capture the ship."</p>

<p>"You joined their rotten gang, risked death and worse, to defeat
their plans&mdash;to save your own people, and mine, from the
horrors of war!" Atkins exclaimed. "By God, Li-San, you are a
man!"</p>

<p>Yellow hand and white met and clasped.</p>

<p>"Hey, you fellows," came Bart Thomas' weak voice from the floor.
"When you get time you might take three or four of these ropes off
me and get me something to wear. You'll get all the handshaking you
want when we get back to New York."</p>
