  <h3>First published in <i>The People</i>, May 4, 1924<br>
  Reprinted in <i>The Edgar Wallace Mystery Magazine</i>, Apr 1967,<br>
  as &ldquo;The Wimbledon Vampire.&rdquo;</h3>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">THE gentle Tressa was remarkable in one respect: she never
  found bad people interesting.</p>

  <p>When Lady Mary Midston told her about the burglar, Tressa was politely
  interested but not enthusiastic.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Daddy was in Paris, otherwise I should have called him when I heard
  the noise in the hall. He&rsquo;s simply furious with me for not calling
  Thomas. When I got downstairs there was a light in the drawing-room and a
  little man was tying up the silver in a tablecloth. I must say, Tressa, that
  he was awfully decent, and when he told me about his sick wife and his poor
  little children I hadn&rsquo;t the heart to call any of the staff.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you let him go?&rdquo; said Tressa, coldly for her. &ldquo;My
  child, you have a certain duty to society&mdash;I suppose you realise that? I
  know you acted as your own kind little heart dictated, but a burglar is a
  burglar, no matter what the state of his wife&rsquo;s
  health&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what daddy said,&rdquo; remarked Mary
  complacently.</p>

  <p>She was a slim, pretty girl, with flawless colouring and anybody but Mike
  Long would have spent sleepless nights in the fear of losing her. Mike, for
  the moment being in the grip of the Wembley Vampire, spent his evenings
  composing letters breaking off the engagement and his mornings in tearing
  them up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Tressa, you are most original! Of course I let him go! And
  he was an honest man, apart from his burglaries, for he gave me his address,
  and when I went&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You went to his house?&rdquo; gasped Tressa.</p>

  <p>Mary nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course I went I wanted to know whether his story was true. And,
  darling, it was! He&rsquo;s got two of the sweetest children, and a wretched,
  washed- out kind of wife without an &lsquo;h&rsquo; to her name. And
  I&rsquo;ve asked my cousin Arkwright, who&rsquo;s in the City, to find him a
  job, so that he will never have to go out burgling any more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tressa sighed; and then, after a pause:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I am wrong.
  But I must confess that I do not like the most picturesque of burglars, and
  he doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been particularly attractive. Bad people do not
  appeal to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mary said nothing, but thought a great deal, and Tressa, who was something
  of a thought-reader, smiled and went on:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Meeting bad people in one&rsquo;s own circle is unavoidable; and
  besides, there&rsquo;s just a chance that one may be able to switch them on
  to the right track.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mary sniffed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you can switch Lila Morestel on to the right track, I shall be
  both surprised and pleased,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>The taunt was not without justification, for Lila had been a constant
  visitor at the Piccadilly flat in the past few weeks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is one of the things I cannot understand about you, Tressa.
  Everybody knows about Mrs. Morestel. Why, they took her name off the books of
  the Jacara Club and <i>they</i> are pretty broad-minded.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lila is in trouble and wanted my help,&rdquo; said Tressa
  shortly.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">LILA MORESTEL was frequently in trouble: and as frequently,
  in her helpless, agonised way, appealed for the assistance of her friends.
  Sometimes the assistance was such that it could not be rendered without
  damage to the reputation of the helper.</p>

  <p>Her history was a curious one. She had been a shop assistant in an Oxford
  Street establishment, and her beauty attracted the attention of Vivian
  Morestel. Nobody knew how Vivy earned his living. It was supposed that he
  sold cars on commission, and that he acted as agent for a firm of bookmakers
  in various members&rsquo; enclosures. He had other sources of income, which
  only the unfortunate young men who accepted invitations to play cards in his
  flat knew anything about, and they were naturally reticent.</p>

  <p>For some inexplicable reason his hectic courtship of Lila culminated
  within a few weeks of his meeting her in a visit to the Marylebone Registry
  Office, where they were joined together in the business-like bonds of
  matrimony.</p>

  <p>Lila&rsquo;s social progress was amazing. There were vague stories in
  circulation of tremendous adventures with wealthy members of the British
  aristocracy, and the officials of the Royal Courts of Justice could tell of
  divorce suits begun by Vivy and &lsquo;settled out of court&rsquo; for a
  consideration. Generally the sum was about £20,000, and Mr. and Mrs. Vivy
  Morestel grew opulent, bought Flynn Hall at Wembley, and lived there
  alternately.</p>

  <p>Vivy had discovered a method of earning a livelihood more effective than
  the most cleverly manipulated pack of cards could give him. There were minor
  scandals within scandals. Big, bluff Scherzo, the <i>maître d'hôtel</i> at
  the Fourways Club, complained bitterly that he had introduced Lila to a rich
  Brazilian and that, no sooner had Lila got her landing hooks into his banking
  account, than she persuaded him to patronise another establishment&mdash;a
  dead loss to Scherzo of £100 a week, for the Brazilian was a liberal
  spender.</p>

  <p>By mutual consent the two young people lived apart, and only met either in
  consultation, to decide for how much they could bleed Lila&rsquo;s latest
  friend, or else to cut up the profits over a pleasant dinner. This sounds
  incredible, but it is true, and the partnership might have continued for a
  very long time, with profit to both but Vivy made the mistake of falling in
  love with somebody, and decided on a real divorce.</p>

  <p>That is the story of Lila, known to every clubman in London. It is the
  story behind the dazzling picture of her published in the daily and weekly
  press. Into the web of Flynn Hall many bloated flies had flown and struggled
  helplessly, and had been duly blooded. And now the king fly was buzzing
  nearer and nearer to the viscid threads.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can only tell you, Tressa, that if she gets Mike
  I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll murder her!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tressa laughed softly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mike&rsquo;s much too sensible,&rdquo; she said, conscious of her
  own hypocrisy, for she had told other women that other men were &lsquo;much
  too sensible,&rsquo; and had had to watch the ruin of hopes and ambitions
  that littered the trail where the triumphant Lila had passed.</p>

  <p>She decided in this particular case that it would be wise to see Mike
  himself; but days passed before she met him, and then the
  opportunity&mdash;it was at the opening match at Hurlingham&mdash;was not a
  particularly good one.</p>

  <p>Mike listened, obviously ill at ease, whilst Tressa expatiated on the
  virtues and sweetness of his fiancée.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said awkwardly at
  last. &ldquo;Mary is a dear&mdash;much too good for me, and all that sort of
  thing. I wouldn&rsquo;t hurt her for the world. But I&rsquo;m not so sure
  that our marriage would be the best thing for her in the long run. Honestly,
  Tressa, I&rsquo;d give a million pounds if she&rsquo;d get fed up with me and
  break it off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Tressa.</p>

  <p>Mike fumbled with his tie, ran his hand through his fair hair, pulled at
  his aristocratic nose, and stammered something about incompatability.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The point is, Tressa,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;Mary&rsquo;s
  much too sweet a girl to marry a rough-and-tumble fellow like me. She&rsquo;s
  unsophisticated, and it would simply hurt me most damnably to upset her.
  She&rsquo;s a child. I feel that I ought to marry a girl who has&mdash;well,
  suffered&mdash;give her a sort of safe harbour after the storm.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In fact, Lila Morestel,&rdquo; said Tressa brutally, and Mike went
  very red.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes; I&rsquo;m awfully fond of Lila, and she&rsquo;s had a
  perfect hell of a time with that awful husband of hers. You&rsquo;ve no idea,
  Tressa, what that girl has suffered.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have a pretty shrewd idea, I think,&rdquo; said Tressa drily, and
  Mike grew a little peevish.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course, if you are one of the people who believe all these awful
  stories that are told about her, there&rsquo;s no use in continuing the
  argument,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;&lsquo;Malice loves a shining mark&rsquo;,
  Tressa, and naturally these beastly women who invent all kinds of stories
  about the poor girl....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tressa realised that this was not the moment to give her views on Lila
  Morestel and her sufferings. More especially she was embarrassed by the
  knowledge that she had been the unwilling recipient of that lady&rsquo;s
  confidence.</p>

  <p>When she got home she wrote a little note asking Lila to come and see her,
  and the next morning came a telephone call from Flynn Hall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is it very important, darling? I&rsquo;m simply rushed off my feet.
  I have to see my solicitors today or tomorrow&mdash;or perhaps it&rsquo;s
  next Monday: I&rsquo;m not quite certain. But anyway, I&rsquo;m fearfully
  rushed! You know just how terrible I&rsquo;m feeling about the whole
  business.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can you come tomorrow?&rdquo; insisted Tressa, and there came from
  the other end of the wire a reluctant agreement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m selling Flynn Hall?&rdquo; she added, just as
  Tressa thought the conversation was ended and was about to replace the
  receiver.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was perfectly true that Lila contemplated the sale of
  Flynn Hall. She discussed the matter with Vivy, who came to lunch that day,
  and he completely agreed with her plans. They sat together in the beautiful,
  panelled library that looked out on a stretch of lawn and a well tended
  garden. Lila was at her desk, and had before her a neat array of title deeds
  and accounts; for she was a business woman of extraordinary ability,
  methodical to a painful degree&mdash;it pained Vivy at any rate&mdash;even
  going so far as to keep the records of many strange but thrilling incidents
  in a steel filing cabinet. Because, as Lila told her husband:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You never know when these things may be useful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A cigarette drooped from Vivy&rsquo;s thin lips, his pale blue eyes
  surveyed the pleasant vista in a melancholy stare, his hands were thrust deep
  into his pockets, and his shoulders humped&mdash;a favourite attitude of his
  when he found himself in hopeless conflict with his businesslike partner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, have it your own way, Lila,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;only tell
  me when you&rsquo;ve made the decision. I&rsquo;ve never known you to be so
  undecided before. It seems a perfectly easy thing to do: you can bring a
  petition: I&rsquo;ll not defend it; and that will be the end of
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that is the best way,&rdquo; she meditated.
  &ldquo;Mike and I went to the El Moro last night and had a long talk.
  He&rsquo;s worth three millions, Vivy, but the money is so tied up that I
  can&rsquo;t see myself handling a great deal of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here, what do you mean?&rdquo; asked Vivian, galvanised to activity
  in his alarm. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to cry off? I&rsquo;ve promised
  that dear girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind what you&rsquo;ve promised that dear girl,&rdquo;
  snapped Lila. &ldquo;And how you can bring yourself to fall in love with her
  is beyond me. I&rsquo;m not going to cry off&mdash;I want to marry
  Mike.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he engaged or something?&rdquo; asked Vivy, with a
  flicker of interest. &ldquo;I thought he was tied up with Lady Mary
  Midston&mdash; rather a pretty girl, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s tied up with nobody,&rdquo; said Lila decisively.
  &ldquo;He likes her, and I suppose he is sort of engaged to her. I know
  he&rsquo;s rather worried about breaking it off, but that&rsquo;s nothing.
  The point is this&rdquo;&mdash;she folded her hands on the desk and looked
  him straight in the eyes&mdash;&ldquo;will it be the best for me to divorce
  you or for you to divorce me? If I bring the action, there&rsquo;s nothing in
  it for either of us, and there&rsquo;s always a chance that he might back
  out. On the other hand, if you bring the action, Mike&rsquo;s got such a
  strange sense of honour that he&rsquo;s certain to marry me and, what is
  more, there would be a settlement.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Now settlements had been the foundation of Lila&rsquo;s fortune and,
  incidentally, of Vivy&rsquo;s and they were now on ground familiar to
  both.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only this time, of course,&rdquo; Lila went on, &ldquo;there would
  be no cut. Whatever I got would be mine, and I think, with a bit of luck, we
  could induce Mike to pay a hundred thousand pounds out of court. The only
  thing is that is mustn&rsquo;t be settled on me, otherwise it might affect my
  marriage settlement.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vivian was now thoroughly alert, and for an hour they discussed ways and
  measures. At the end of that time Lila made a neat little memorandum of the
  arrangement, cursed her husband for his rapacity&mdash;he had ultimately
  accepted an eight per cent commission&mdash;and there, so far as the vampires
  were concerned, the matter was satisfactorily ended.</p>

  <p>To Tressa, the next afternoon, she gave her own version of the
  agreement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear, the most terrible thing has happened! Vivy is filing a
  suit for divorce.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tressa was staggered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> is divorcing <i>you?</i>&rdquo; she said incredulously.
  &ldquo;I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; said Lila, wringing her hands. She was a
  tall, svelte woman, with a willowy figure, an over-large chin and eyes of
  melting blue. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it too dreadful, Tressa! And after all I
  have done for him, the sacrifices I have made, after all my subterfuges to
  keep his name clean!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course, Mike will defend the action, and you will
  counterpetition?&rdquo; said Tressa.</p>

  <p>Lila shook her head sadly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I could do that, of course,&rdquo; she said mournfully, &ldquo;but
  my dear, think of the publicity&mdash;I would make any sacrifice for
  Mike&rsquo;s sake. In fact, I&rsquo;ve just seen him and told him so. You
  can&rsquo;t realise what this means to me, Tressa.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the incredulous Tressa, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not
  allowing Vivian to bring this action and offering no defence, are
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; wailed Lila. &ldquo;I have to consider Mike.
  It&rsquo;s the awful publicity of a defended action that I&rsquo;m thinking
  about.&rdquo; Tressa frowned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is your husband asking for damages?&rdquo; she demanded
  suspiciously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s doing. My head is in a perfect
  whirl, and I&rsquo;m positively sick with worry and anxiety,&rdquo; said
  Lila. &ldquo;Mike has been awfully good about the whole thing. Of course,
  it&rsquo;s come as a great blow to the poor darling, especially as he is, in
  a manner of speaking, innocent; and he&rsquo;s threatened to kill Vivy. But
  he realises that he&rsquo;s been seen about with me so much, and under the
  circumstances he feels, as I do, that the thing to avoid is
  publicity&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How much is Vivy asking?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lila threw out tragic and despairing hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea, darling,&rdquo; she whimpered.
  &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t ask me! The thing is so sordid and horrible that it
  doesn&rsquo;t bear speaking of.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mike Long, a very dazed and serious young man, sat down that night and
  sent a letter which took him two hours to compose; and Mary Midston read it
  in bed and did not shed a tear. She read it twice, read it again, and then,
  reaching out of bed, lifted the telephone and called Tressa.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you heard the news?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>Tressa, who had come in to breakfast early in the expectation of this
  call, replied cautiously:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What news is this, Mary?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a letter from Mike,&rdquo; said Mary, and her voice
  was singularly even for one whose engagement had been so unceremoniously
  broken off. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t read it to you, but it&rsquo;s all about my
  youth and innocence, and the horrible unworthiness of Mike. In fact, Tressa,
  he&rsquo;s ditched me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tressa winced: she had never taken to the <i>argot</i> of the streets.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s going to marry the Vampire. In fact, Mr. Vampire is
  bringing an action for divorce, and Mike is the Foolish Third.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a long pause.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; asked Tressa.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do all that I&rsquo;m not expected to do,&rdquo;
  said the cool voice at the other end of the line. &ldquo;I should be sobbing
  into my pillow, or writing a tear-stained letter. But, Tressa, I&rsquo;m not
  going to allow that poor child&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which poor child?&rdquo; asked the startled Tressa.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mike,&rdquo; was the calm reply. &ldquo;Do you know anybody who
  better fills the description? I&rsquo;m not going to allow <i>him</i> to be
  ruined by that unspeakable reptile. I&rsquo;m supposed to be unsophisticated
  but, Tressa, though I neither dope nor drink, nor indulge in the peculiar
  pleasures of our mutual friends, I know just enough of the wicked world and
  its ways to stop this divorce.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Tressa.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha ha!&rdquo; said the voice, so sardonic that for the second time
  within twenty- four hours Tressa was staggered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know something about Lila,&rdquo; Mary went on, &ldquo;and
  I&rsquo;m going to learn a little more. Do you remember how she once settled
  a dispute we had at dinner, as to who won the money when we all went to Ascot
  with the Gladdings, by producing a four-year-old race-card with all the
  accounts neatly pencilled on the back?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But what on earth has that to do with the divorce?&rdquo; asked
  Tressa in amazement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; said Mary, and rang off.</p>

  <p>Mike Long was on the point of going out that night when the visitor was
  announced, and he almost collapsed at the sight of the girl in shimmering
  blue and white who confronted him in the drawing-room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mary!&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;My dear, I&rsquo;m sorry you
  came. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s wise of you to distress
  yourself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not distressing myself at all,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;I
  thought I would come along and make <i>your</i> mind easy. I&rsquo;m
  consoling myself with <i>Social Snaps</i>&rdquo;.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With <i>what?</i>&rdquo; gasped Mike.</p>

  <p>Had his brutal conduct turned this unfortunate girl&rsquo;s brain?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You may not have heard of <i>Social Snaps,</i> she said
  apologetically. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a very high-class paper&mdash;in fact,
  daddy says that it is a very low- class paper. It has been advertised for
  sale in the Press for months&mdash;you must have read the announcements. I
  bought it&mdash;daddy lent me the money.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But why in the name of fate do you want to go in for that sort of
  thing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was so astonished that he forgot the painfulness of the interview.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a journalist&mdash;you can&rsquo;t
  write&mdash;"</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t 1?&rdquo; she said darkly. &ldquo;Oh, can&rsquo;t
  I!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked at her uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad&mdash;I mean, I&rsquo;m glad that you have taken
  things so well. The whole business is rather awful, isn&rsquo;t it? Vivy is a
  so-and-so, but I&rsquo;ve got to go through with it. You don&rsquo;t know how
  terrible I&rsquo;m feeling....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He babbled further inanities, and she heard him through. Then she made a
  statement, and he went red and then white.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t say that sort of thing about Lila: she&rsquo;s as
  innocent as a child, and all these stories about her are lies. It is infamous
  to suggest that she has lived on blackmail&mdash;wicked!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must subscribe to my paper, Mike,&rdquo; she said at parting.
  &ldquo;Can you drop me at the comer of Russett Street, Lambeth? I saw your
  car at the door.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Where!</i>&rdquo; he squeaked. &ldquo;Russett Street&mdash;why
  that&rsquo;s one of the lowest neighbourhoods in London!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We journalists have to go to strange places,&rdquo; said Mary.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was on the fourth day of the second week after this
  interview that Lila stalked tragically into Tressa&rsquo;s room and dropped
  onto a chair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I could only find the man I&rsquo;d give him five thousand
  pounds,&rdquo; she groaned. &ldquo;The fool didn&rsquo;t trouble to take my
  jewel case.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But why should a burglar trouble to rob your library?&rdquo; asked
  Tressa, who had read the account of the burglary in the morning
  newspaper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; snapped the Vampire.
  &ldquo;Oh my God, <i>why</i> did he? Every paper taken from my safe, every
  letter stolen from my file! He must have spent hours. And there were two of
  them. The fool of a policeman said that he saw a little man and a woman
  coming down the drive and got into a car that was waiting on the
  road.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who was the woman?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lila could only wave despairing hands.</p>

  <p>Tressa was genuinely puzzled for a day or two, and then one morning there
  came to her breakfast table a small weekly journal. She tore off the wrapper
  to examine Mary&rsquo;s initial effort as a journalist, and the first thing
  that caught her eye was a black letter announcement.</p><br>

  <p class="headline">In our next issue we shall tell the story of:</p>

  <p class="headline"><big>The Vampire of Wembley</big></p>

  <p class="headline">and publish extracts from correspondence between<br>
  this sinister woman, her wretched victims, and her horrible husband.</p>

  <p class="headline">We shall also give the confessions of a converted burglar
  who,<br>
  owing to the influence exercised by a young and charming society woman,<br>
  was induced to return to the paths of virtue.</p>

  <p class="headline"><big>Order Your Copies Now</big></p><br>

  <p>And then Tressa understood.</p>

  <p>Lila read the marked paragraph sent to her by registered post and also
  understood.</p>

  <p>She got on the telephone to Vivy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That Midston girl has got the letters, Vivy. I don&rsquo;t know
  what you&rsquo;ll do, but I&rsquo;m going to California till things look
  brighter. I think that is the only way to stop publication. Oh, yes, Mike has
  a copy of the worst letters. I called him up a few minutes ago, and his valet
  told me that he was not at home to me.&rdquo;</p>
