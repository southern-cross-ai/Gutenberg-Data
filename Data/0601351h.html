<h2><a name="ch01" id="ch01"></a>I. &mdash; IN WHICH OUR SPECIAL
COMMISSIONERS MAKE A START</h2>

<p class="first">THE great Professor Challenger has been
&mdash;very improperly and imperfectly&mdash;used in fiction. A
daring author placed him in impossible and romantic situations in
order to see how he would react to them. He reacted to the extent
of a libel action, an abortive appeal for suppression, a riot in
Sloane Street, two personal assaults, and the loss of his
position as lecturer upon Physiology at the London School of Sub-
Tropical Hygiene. Otherwise, the matter passed more peaceably
than might have been expected.</p>

<p>But he was losing something of his fire. Those huge shoulders
were a little bowed. The spade-shaped Assyrian beard showed
tangles of grey amid the black, his eyes were a trifle less
aggressive, his smile less self-complacent, his voice as
monstrous as ever but less ready to roar down all opposition. Yet
he was dangerous, as all around him were painfully aware. The
volcano was not extinct, and constant rumblings threatened some
new explosion. Life had much yet to teach him, but he was a
little less intolerant in learning.</p>

<p>There was a definite date for the change which had been
wrought in him. It was the death of his wife. That little bird of
a woman had made her nest in the big man's heart. He had all the
tenderness and chivalry which the strong can have for the weak.
By yielding everything she had won everything, as a sweet-
natured, tactful woman can. And when she died suddenly from
virulent pneumonia following influenza, the man staggered and
went down. He came up again, smiling ruefully like the stricken
boxer, and ready to carry on for many a round with Fate. But he
was not the same man, and if it had not been for the help and
comradeship of his daughter Enid, he might have never rallied
from the blow. She it was who, with clever craft, lured him into
every subject which would excite his combative nature and
infuriate his mind, until he lived once more in the present and
not the past. It was only when she saw him turbulent in
controversy, violent to pressmen, and generally offensive to
those around him, that she felt he was really in a fair way to
recovery.</p>

<p>Enid Challenger was a remarkable girl and should have a
paragraph to herself. With the raven-black hair of her father,
and the blue eyes and fresh colour of her mother, she was
striking, if not beautiful, in appearance. She was quiet, but she
was very strong. From her infancy she had either to take her own
part against her father, or else to consent to be crushed and to
become a mere automaton worked by his strong fingers. She was
strong enough to hold her own in a gentle, elastic fashion, which
bent to his moods and reasserted itself when they were past.
Lately she had felt the constant pressure too oppressive and she
had relieved it by feeling out for a career of her own. She did
occasional odd jobs for the London press, and did them in such
fashion that her name was beginning to be known in Fleet Street.
In finding this opening she had been greatly helped by an old
friend of her father&mdash;and possibly of the reader&mdash;Mr.
Edward Malone of the <em>Daily Gazette</em>.</p>

<p>Malone was still the same athletic Irishman who had once won
his international cap at Rugby, but life had toned him down also,
and made him a more subdued and thoughtful man. He had put away a
good deal when last his football-boots had been packed away for
good. His muscles may have wilted and his joints stiffened, but
his mind was deeper and more active. The boy was dead and the man
was born. In person he had altered little, but his moustache was
heavier, his back a little rounded, and some lines of thought
were tracing themselves upon his brow. Post-war conditions and
new world problems had left their mark. For the rest he had made
his name in journalism and even to a small degree in literature.
He was still a bachelor, though there were some who thought that
his hold on that condition was precarious and that Miss Enid
Challenger's little white fingers could disengage it. Certainly
they were very good chums.</p>

<p>It was a Sunday evening in October, and the lights were just
beginning to twinkle out through the fog which had shrouded
London from early morning. Professor Challenger's flat at
Victoria West Gardens was upon the third floor, and the mist lay
thick upon the windows, while the low hum of the attenuated
Sunday traffic rose up from an invisible highway beneath, which
was outlined only by scattered patches of dull radiance.
Professor Challenger sat with his thick, bandy legs outstretched
to the fire, and his hands thrust deeply into trouser pockets.
His dress had a little of the eccentricity of genius, for he wore
a loose-collared shirt, a large knotted maroon-coloured silk tie,
and a black velvet smoking-jacket, which, with his flowing beard,
gave him the appearance of an elderly and Bohemian artist. On one
side of him ready for an excursion, with bowl hat, short-skirted
dress of black, and all the other fashionable devices with which
women contrive to deform the beauties of nature, there sat his
daughter, while Malone, hat in hand, waited by the window.</p>

<p>"I think we should get off, Enid. It is nearly seven," said
he.</p>

<p>They were writing joint articles upon the religious
denominations of London, and on each Sunday evening they sallied
out together to sample some new one and get copy for the next
week's issue of the <em>Gazette</em>.</p>

<p>"It's not till eight, Ted. We have lots of time."</p>

<p>"Sit down, sir! Sit down!" boomed Challenger, tugging at his
beard as was his habit if his temper was rising, "there is
nothing annoys me more than having anyone standing behind me. A
relic of atavism and the fear of a dagger, but still persistent.
That's right. For heaven's sake put your hat down! You have a
perpetual air of catching a train."</p>

<p>"That's the journalistic life," said Malone. "If we don't
catch the perpetual train we get left. Even Enid is beginning to
understand that. But still, as you say, there is time
enough."</p>

<p>"How far have you got?" asked Challenger.</p>

<p>Enid consulted a business-like little reporter's notebook. "We
have done seven. There was Westminster Abbey for the Church in
its most picturesque form, and Saint Agatha for the High Church,
and Tudor Place for the Low. Then there was the Westminster
Cathedral for Catholics, Endell Street for Presbyterians, and
Gloucester Square for Unitarians. But to-night we are trying to
introduce some variety. We are doing the Spiritualists."</p>

<p>Challenger snorted like an angry buffalo.</p>

<p>"Next week the lunatic asylums, I presume," said he. "You
don't mean to tell me, Malone, that these ghost people have got
churches of their own."</p>

<p>"I've been looking into that," said Malone. "I always look up
cold facts and figures before I tackle a job. They have over four
hundred registered churches in Great Britain."</p>

<p>Challenger's snorts now sounded like a whole herd of
buffaloes.</p>

<p>"There seems to me to be absolutely no limit to the inanity
and credulity of the human race. <em>Homo Sapiens! Homo
idioticus!</em> Who do they pray to&mdash; the ghosts?"</p>

<p>"Well, that's what we want to find out. We should get some
copy out of them. I need not say that I share your view entirely,
but I've seen something of Atkinson of St. Mary's Hospital
lately. He is a rising surgeon, you know."</p>

<p>"I've heard of him&mdash;cerebro-spinal."</p>

<p>"That's the man. He is level-headed and is looked on as an
authority on psychic research, as they call the new science which
deals with these matters."</p>

<p>"Science, indeed!"</p>

<p>"Well, that is what they call it. He seems to take these
people seriously. I consult him when I want a reference, for he
has the literature at his fingers' end. 'Pioneers of the Human
Race'&mdash;that was his description."</p>

<p>"Pioneering them to Bedlam," growled Challenger. "And
literature! What literature have they?"</p>

<p>"Well, that was another surprise. Atkinson has five hundred
volumes, but complains that his psychic library is very
imperfect. You see, there is French, German, Italian, as well as
our own."</p>

<p>"Well, thank God all the folly is not confined to poor old
England. Pestilential nonsense!"</p>

<p>"Have you read it up at all, Father?" asked Enid.</p>

<p>"Read it up! I, with all my interests and no time for one-half
of them! Enid, you are too absurd."</p>

<p>"Sorry, Father. You spoke with such assurance, I thought you
knew something about it."</p>

<p>Challenger's huge head swung round and his lion's glare rested
upon his daughter.</p>

<p>"Do you conceive that a logical brain, a brain of the first
order, needs to read and to study before it can detect a manifest
absurdity? Am I to study mathematics in order to confute the man
who tells me that two and two are five? Must I study physics once
more and take down my Principia because some rogue or fool
insists that a table can rise in the air against the law of
gravity? Does it take five hundred volume to inform us of a thing
which is proved in every police-court when an impostor is
exposed? Enid, I am ashamed of you!"</p>

<p>His daughter laughed merrily.</p>

<p>"Well, Dad, you need not roar at me any more. I give in. In
fact, I have the same feeling that you have."</p>

<p>"None the less," said Malone, "some good men support them. I
don't see that you can laugh at Lodge and Crookes and the
others."</p>

<p>"Don't be absurd, Malone. Every great mind has its weaker
side. It is a sort of reaction against all the good sense. You
come suddenly upon a vein of positive nonsense. That is what is
the matter with these fellows. No, Enid, I haven't read their
reasons, and I don't mean to, either; some things are beyond the
pale. If we re-open all the old questions, how can we ever get
ahead with the new ones? This matter is settled by common sense,
the law of England, and by the universal assent of every sane
European."</p>

<p>"So that's that!" said Enid.</p>

<p>"However," he continued, "I can admit that there are
occasional excuses for misunderstandings upon the point." He sank
his voice, and his great grey eyes looked sadly up into vacancy.
"I have known cases where the coldest intellect&mdash;even my own
intellect&mdash;might, for a moment have been shaken."</p>

<p>Malone scented copy.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>Challenger hesitated. He seemed to be struggling with himself.
He wished to speak, and yet speech was painful. Then, with an
abrupt, impatient gesture, he plunged into his story:</p>

<p>"I never told you, Enid. It was too&mdash;too intimate.
Perhaps too absurd. I was ashamed to have been so shaken. But it
shows how even the best balanced may be caught unawares."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>"It was after my wife's death. You knew her, Malone You can
guess what it meant to me. It was the night after the
cremation&mdash;horrible, Malone, horrible! I saw the dear little
body slide down, down... and then the glare of flame and the door
clanged to." His great body shook and he passed his big, hairy
hand over his eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't know why I tell you this; the talk seemed to lead up
to it. It may be a warning to you. That night&mdash;the night
after the cremation&mdash;I sat up in the hall. She was there,"
he nodded at Enid. "She had fallen asleep in a chair, poor girl.
You know the house at Rotherfield, Malone. It was in the big
hall. I sat by the fireplace, the room all draped in shadow, and
my mind draped In shadow also. I should have sent her to bed, but
she was lying back in her chair and I did not wish to wake her.
It may have been one in the morning&mdash;I remember the moon
shining through the stained-glass window. I sat and I brooded.
Then suddenly there came a noise."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>"It was low at first just a ticking. Then it grew louder and
more distinct&mdash;it was a clear <em>rat-tat-tat</em>. Now
comes the queer coincidence, the sort of thing out of which
legends grow when credulous folk have the shaping of them. You
must know that my wife had a peculiar way of knocking at a door.
It was really a little tune which she played with her fingers. I
got into the some way so that we could each know when the other
knocked. Well, it seemed to me&mdash;of course my mind was
strained and abnormal&mdash;that the taps shaped themselves into
the well-known rhythm of her knock. I couldn't localize it. You
can think how eagerly I tried. It was above me, somewhere on the
woodwork. I lost sense of time. I daresay it was repeated a dozen
times at least."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dad, you never told me!"</p>

<p>"No, but I woke you up. I asked you to sit quiet with me for a
little."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember that!"</p>

<p>"Well, we sat, but nothing happened. Not a sound more. Of
course it was a delusion. Some insect in the wood; the ivy on the
outer wall. My own brain furnished the rhythm. Thus do we make
fools and children of ourselves. But it gave me an insight. I saw
how even a clever man could be deceived by his own emotions."</p>

<p>"But how do you know, sir, that it was not your wife."</p>

<p>"Absurd, Malone! Absurd, I say! I tell you I saw her in the
flames. What was there left?"</p>

<p>"Her soul, her spirit."</p>

<p>Challenger shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>"When that dear body dissolved into its elements&mdash;when
its gases went into the air and its residue of solids sank into a
grey dust&mdash;it was the end. There was no more. She had played
her part, played it beautifully, nobly. It was done. Death ends
all, Malone. This soul talk is the Animism of savages. It is a
superstition, a myth. As a physiologist I will undertake to
produce crime or virtue by vascular control or cerebral
stimulation. I will turn a Jekyll into a Hyde by a surgical
operation. Another can do it by a psychological suggestion.
Alcohol will do it. Drugs will do it. Absurd, Malone, absurd! As
the tree falls, so does it lie. There is no next
morning&mdash;night&mdash;eternal night&mdash;and long rest for
the weary worker."</p>

<p>"Well, it's a sad philosophy."</p>

<p>"Better a sad than a false one."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so. There is something virile and manly in facing the
worst. I would not contradict. My reason is with you."</p>

<p>"But my instincts are against!" cried Enid. "No, no, never can
I believe it." She threw her arms round the great bull neck.
"Don't tell me, Daddy, that you with all your complex brain and
wonderful self are a thing with no more life hereafter than a
broken clock!"</p>

<p>"Four buckets of water and a bagful of salts," said Challenger
as he smilingly detached his daughter's grip. "That's your daddy,
my lass, and you may as well reconcile your mind to it. Well,
it's twenty to eight.&mdash; Come back, if you can, Malone, and
let me hear your adventures among the insane."</p>

<h2><a name="ch02" id="ch02"></a>II.&mdash; WHICH DESCRIBES AN
EVENING IN STRANGE COMPANY</h2>

<p class="first">THE love-affair of Enid Challenger and Edward
Malone is not of the slightest interest to the reader, for the
simple reason that it is not of the slightest interest to the
writer. The unseen, unnoticed lure of the unborn babe is common
to all youthful humanity. We deal in this chronicle with matters
which are less common and of higher interest. It is only
mentioned in order to explain those terms of frank and intimate
comradeship which the narrative discloses. If the human race has
obviously improved in anything&mdash;in Anglo-Celtic countries,
at least&mdash;it is that the prim affectations and sly deceits
of the past are lessened, and that young men and women can meet
in an equality of clean and honest comradeship.</p>

<p>A taxi took the adventurers down Edgware Road and into the
side-street called "Helbeck Terrace." Halfway down, the dull line
of brick houses was broken by one glowing gap, where an open arch
threw a flood of light into the street. The cab pulled up and the
man opened the door.</p>

<p>"This is the Spiritualist Church, sir," said he. Then, as he
saluted to acknowledge his tip, he added in the wheezy voice of
the man of all weathers: "Tommy-rot, I call it, sir." Having
eased his conscience thus, he climbed into his seat and a moment
later his red rear-lamp was a waning circle in the gloom. Malone
laughed.</p>

<p>"<em>Vox populi</em>, Enid. That is as far as the public has
got at present."</p>

<p>"Well, it is as far as we have got, for that matter."</p>

<p>"Yes, but we are prepared to give them a show. I don't suppose
Cabby is. By Jove, it will be hard luck if we can't get in!"</p>

<p>There was a crowd at the door and a man was facing them from
the top of the step, waving his arms to keep them back.</p>

<p>"It's no good, friends. I am very sorry, but we can't help it.
We've been threatened twice with prosecution for over-crowding."
He turned facetious. "Never heard of an Orthodox Church getting
into trouble for that. No, sir, no."</p>

<p>"I've come all the way from 'Ammersmith," wailed a voice. The
light beat upon the eager, anxious face of the speaker, a little
woman in black with a baby in her arms.</p>

<p>"You've come for clairvoyance, Mam," said the usher, with
intelligence. "See here, give me the name and address and I will
write you, and Mrs. Debbs will give you a sitting gratis. That's
better than taking your chance in the crowd when, with all the
will in the world, you can't all get a turn. You'll have her to
yourself. No, sir, there's no use shovin'. What's that?
Press?"</p>

<p>He had caught Malone by the elbow.</p>

<p>"Did you say Press? The Press boycott us, sir. Look at the
weekly list of services in a Saturday's <em>Times</em> if you
doubt it. You wouldn't know there was such a thing as
Spiritualism...What paper, sir?...'<em>The Daily Gazette</em>.'
Well, well, we are getting on. And the lady, too?...Special
article&mdash;my word! Stick to me, sir, and I'll see what I can
do. Shut the doors, Joe. No use, friends. When the building fund
gets on a bit we'll have more room for you. Now, Miss, this way,
if you please."</p>

<p>This way proved to be down the street and round a side-alley
which brought them to a small door with a red lamp shining above
it.</p>

<p>"I'll have to put you on the platform&mdash;there's no
standing room in the body of the hall."</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" cried Enid.</p>

<p>"You'll have a fine view, Miss, and maybe get a readin' for
yourself if your lucky. It often happens that those nearest the
medium get the best chance. Now, sir, in here!"</p>

<p>Here was a frowsy little room with some hats and top-coats
draping the dirty, white-washed walls. A thin, austere woman,
with eyes which gleamed from behind her glasses, was warming her
gaunt hands over a small fire. With his back to the fire in the
traditional British attitude was a large, fat man with a
bloodless face, a ginger moustache and curious, light-blue eyes
&mdash;the eyes of a deep-sea mariner. A little bald-headed man
with huge horn-rimmed spectacles, and a very handsome and
athletic youth in a blue lounge-suit completed the group.</p>

<p>"The others have gone on the platform, Mr. Peeble. There's
only five seats left for ourselves." It was the fat man
talking.</p>

<p>"I know, I know," said the man who had been addressed as
Peeble, a nervous, stringy, dried-up person as he now appeared in
the light. "But this is the Press, Mr. Bolsover. <em>Daily
Gazette</em> special article... Malone, the name, and Challenger.
This is Mr. Bolsover, our President. This is Mrs. Debbs of
Liverpool, the famous clairvoyante. Here is Mr. James, and this
tall young gentleman is Mr. Hardy Williams, our energetic
secretary. Mr. Williams is a nailer for the buildin' fund. Keep
your eye on your pockets if Mr. Williams is around."</p>

<p>They all laughed.</p>

<p>"Collection comes later," said Mr. Williams, smiling.</p>

<p>"A good, rousing article is our best collection," said the
stout president. "Ever been to a meeting before, sir?"</p>

<p>"No," said Malone.</p>

<p>"Don't know much about it, I expect."</p>

<p>"No, I don't."</p>

<p>"Well, well, we must expect a slating. They get it from the
humorous angle at first. We'll have you writing a very comic
account. I never could see anything very funny in the spirit of
one's dead wife, but it's a matter of taste and of knowledge
also. If they don't know, how can they take it seriously? I don't
blame them. We were mostly like that ourselves once. I was one of
Bradlaugh's men, and sat under Joseph MacCabe until my old Dad
came and pulled me out."</p>

<p>"Good for him!" said the Liverpool medium.</p>

<p>"It was the first time I found I had powers of my own. I saw
him like I see you now."</p>

<p>"Was he one of us in the body?"</p>

<p>"Knew no more than I did. But they come on amazin' at the
other side if the right folk get hold of them."</p>

<p>"Time's up!" said Mr. Peeble, snapping his watch. "You are on
the right of the chair, Mrs. Debbs. Will you go first? Then you,
Mr. Chairman. Then you two and myself. Get on the left, Mr. Hardy
Williams, and lead the singin'. They want warmin' up and you can
do it. Now then, if you please!"</p>

<p>The platform was already crowded, but the newcomers threaded
their way to the front amid a decorous murmur of welcome. Mr.
Peeble shoved and exhorted and two end seats emerged upon which
Enid and Malone perched themselves. The arrangement suited them
well, for they could use their notebooks freely behind the
shelter of the folk in front.</p>

<p>"What is your reaction?" whispered Enid.</p>

<p>"Not impressed as yet."</p>

<p>"No, nor I," said Enid, "but it's very interesting all the
same."</p>

<p>People who are in earnest are always interesting, whether you
agree with them or not, and it was impossible to doubt that these
people were extremely earnest. The hall was crammed, and as one
looked down one saw line after line of upturned faces, curiously
alike in type, women predominating, but men running them close.
That type was not distinguished nor intellectual, but it was
undeniably healthy, honest and sane. Small trades-folk, male and
female shopwalkers, better class artisans, lower middle-class
women worn with household cares, occasional young folk in search
of a sensation&mdash;these were the impressions which the
audience conveyed to the trained observation of Malone.</p>

<p>The fat president rose and raised his hand.</p>

<p>"My friends," said he, "we have had once more to exclude a
great number of people who desired to be with us to-night. It's
all a question of the building fund, and Mr. Williams on my left
will be glad to hear from any of you I was in a hotel last week
and they had a notice hung up in the reception bureau: 'No
cheques accepted'. That's not the way Brother Williams talks. You
just try him."</p>

<p>The audience laughed. The atmosphere was clearly that of the
lecture-hall rather than of the Church.</p>

<p>"There's just one more thing I want to say before I sit down.
I'm not here to talk. I'm here to hold this chair down and I mean
to do it. It's a hard thing I ask. I want Spiritualists to keep
away on Sunday nights. They take up the room that inquirers
should have. You can have the morning service. But its better for
the cause that there should be room for the stranger. You've had
it. Thank God for it. Give the other man a chance." The president
plumped back into his chair.</p>

<p>Mr. Peeble sprang to his feet. He was clearly the general
utility man who emerges in every society and probably becomes its
autocrat. With his thin, eager face and darting hands he was more
than a live wire&mdash;he was a whole bundle of live wires.
Electricity seemed to crackle from his fingertips.</p>

<p>"Hymn One!" he shrieked.</p>

<p>A harmonium droned and the audience rose. It was a fine hymn
and lustily sung:</p>

<p>"The world hath felt a quickening breath From Heaven's eternal
shore, And souls triumphant over death Return to earth once
more."</p>

<p>There was a ring of exultation in the voices as the refrain
rolled out:</p>

<p>"For this we hold our Jubilee For this with joy we sing, Oh
Grave, where is thy victory Oh Death, where is thy sting?"</p>

<p>Yes, they were in earnest, these people. And they did not
appear to be mentally weaker than their fellows. And yet both
Enid and Malone felt a sensation of great pity as they looked at
them. How sad to be deceived upon so intimate a matter as this,
to be duped by impostors who used their most sacred feelings and
their beloved dead as counters with which to cheat them. What did
they know of the laws of evidence, of the cold, immutable decrees
of scientific law? Poor earnest, honest, deluded people!</p>

<p>"Now!" screamed Mr. Peeble. "We shall ask Mr. Munro from
Australia to give us the invocation."</p>

<p>A wild-looking old man with a shaggy beard and slumbering fire
in his eyes rose up and stood for a few seconds with his gaze
cast down. Then he began a prayer, very simple, very
unpremeditated. Malone jotted down the first sentence: "Oh,
Father, we are very ignorant folk and do not well know how to
approach you, but we will pray to you the best we know how." It
was all cast in that humble key. Enid and Malone exchanged a
swift glance of appreciation.</p>

<p>There was another hymn, less successful than the first, and
the chairman then announced that Mr. James Jones of North Wales
would now deliver a trance address which would embody the views
of his well-known control, Alasha the Atlantean.</p>

<p>Mr. James Jones, a brisk and decided little man in a faded
check suit, came to the front and, after standing a minute or so
as if in deep thought, gave a violent shudder and began to talk.
It must be admitted that save for a certain fixed stare and
vacuous glazing of the eye there was nothing to show that
anything save Mr. James Jones of North Wales was the orator. It
has also to be stated that if Mr. Jones shuddered at the
beginning it was the turn of his audience to shudder afterwards.
Granting his own claim, he had proved clearly that an Atlantean
spirit might be a portentous bore. He droned on with platitudes
and ineptitudes while Malone whispered to Enid that if Alasha was
a fair specimen of the population it was just as well that his
native land was safely engulfed in the Atlantic Ocean. When, with
another rather melodramatic shudder, he emerged from his trance,
the chairman sprang to his feet with an alacrity which showed
that he was taking no risks lest the Atlantean should return.</p>

<p>"We have present with us to-night," he cried, "Mrs. Debbs, the
well-known clairvoyante of Liverpool. Mrs. Debbs is, as many of
you know, richly endowed with several of those gifts of the
spirit of which Saint Paul speaks, and the discerning of spirits
is among them. These things depend upon laws which are beyond our
control, but a sympathetic atmosphere is essential, and Mrs.
Debbs will ask for your good wishes and your prayers while she
endeavours to get into touch with some of those shining ones on
the other side who may honour us with their presence to-
night."</p>

<p>The president sat down and Mrs. Debbs rose amid discreet
applause. Very tall, very pale, very thin, with an aquiline face
and eyes shining brightly from behind her gold-rimmed glasses,
she stood facing her expectant audience. Her head was bent. She
seemed to be listening.</p>

<p>"Vibrations!" she cried at last. "I want helpful vibrations.
Give me a verse on the harmonium, please."</p>

<p>The instrument droned out <em>"Jesu, Lover of my
soul."</em></p>

<p>The audience sat in silence, expectant and a little awed.</p>

<p>The hall was not too well lit and dark shadows lurked in the
corners. The medium still bent her head as if her ears were
straining. Then she raised her hand and the music stopped.</p>

<p>"Presently! Presently! All in good time," said the woman,
addressing some invisible companion. Then to the audience, "I
don't feel that the conditions are very good to-night. I will do
my best and so will they. But I must talk to you first."</p>

<p>And she talked. What she said seemed to the two strangers to
be absolute gabble. There was no consecutive sense in it, though
now and again a phrase or sentence caught the attention. Malone
put his stylo in his pocket. There was no use reporting a
lunatic. A Spiritualist next him saw his bewildered disgust and
leaned towards him.</p>

<p>"She's tuning in. She's getting her wave length," he
whispered. "It's all a matter of vibration. Ah, there you
are!"</p>

<p>She had stopped in the very middle of a sentence. Her long arm
and quivering forefinger shot out. She was pointing at an elderly
woman in the second row.</p>

<p>"You! Yes, you, with the red feather. No, not you. The stout
lady in front. Yes, you! There is a spirit building up behind
you. It is a man. He is a tall man&mdash;six foot maybe. High
forehead, eyes grey or blue, a long chin brown moustache, lines
on his face. Do you recognize him, friend?"</p>

<p>The stout woman looked alarmed, but shook her head.</p>

<p>"Well, see if I can help you. He is holding up a book
&mdash;brown book with a clasp. It's a ledger same as they have
in offices. I get the words 'Caledonian Insurance'. Is that any
help?"</p>

<p>The stout woman pursed her lips and shook her head.</p>

<p>"Well, I can give you a little more. He died after a long
illness. I get chest trouble&mdash;asthma."</p>

<p>The stout woman was still obdurate, but a small, angry, red-
faced person, two places away from her, sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>"It's my 'usband, ma'm. Tell 'im I don't want to 'ave any more
dealin's with him." She sat down with decision.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's right. He moves to you now. He was nearer the
other. He wants to say he's sorry. It doesn't do, you know, to
have hard feelings to the dead. Forgive and forget. It's all
over. I get a message for you. It is: 'Do it and my blessing go
with you'! Does that mean anything to you?"</p>

<p>The angry woman looked pleased and nodded.</p>

<p>"Very good." The clairvoyante suddenly darted out her finger
towards the crowd at the door "It's for the soldier."</p>

<p>A soldier in khaki, looking very much amazed, was in the front
of the knot of people.</p>

<p>"Wot's for me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It's a soldier. He has a corporal's stripes. He is a big man
with grizzled hair. He has a yellow tab on his shoulders. I get
the initials J. H. Do you know him?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but he's dead," said the soldier.</p>

<p>He had not understood that it was a Spiritualistic Church, and
the whole proceedings had been a mystery to him. They were
rapidly explained by his neighbours. "My Gawd!" cried the
soldier, and vanished amid a general titter. In the pause Malone
could hear the constant mutter of the medium as she spoke to
someone unseen.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, wait your turn! Speak up, woman! Well, take your
place near him. How should I know? Well, I will if I can." She
was like a janitor at the theatre marshalling a queue.</p>

<p>Her next attempt was a total failure. A solid man with bushy
side-whiskers absolutely refused to have anything to do with an
elderly gentleman who claimed kinship. The medium worked with
admirable patience, coming back again and again with some fresh
detail, but no progress could be made.</p>

<p>"Are you a Spiritualist, friend?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for ten years."</p>

<p>"Well, you know there are difficulties."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that."</p>

<p>"Think it over. It may come to you later. We must just leave
it at that. I am only sorry for your friend."</p>

<p>There was a pause during which Enid and Malone exchanged
whispered confidences.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it, Enid?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. It confuses me."</p>

<p>"I believe it is half guess-work and the other half a case of
confederates. These people are all of the same church, and
naturally they know each other's affairs. If they don't know they
can inquire."</p>

<p>"Someone said it was Mrs. Debbs' first visit."</p>

<p>"Yes but they could easily coach her up. It is all clever
quackery and bluff. It must be, for just think what is implied if
it is not."</p>

<p>"Telepathy, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Yes, some element of that also. Listen! She is off
again."</p>

<p>Her next attempt was more fortunate. A lugubrious man at the
back of the hall readily recognized the description and claims of
his deceased wife.</p>

<p>"I get the name Walter."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's me."</p>

<p>"She called you Wat?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, she calls you Wat now. 'Tell Wat to give my love to the
children'. That's how I get it. She is worrying about the
children."</p>

<p>"She always did."</p>

<p>"Well, they don't change. Furniture. Something about
furniture. She says you gave it away. Is that right?"</p>

<p>"Well, I might as well."</p>

<p>The audience tittered. It was strange how the most solemn and
comic were eternally blended&mdash;strange and yet very natural
and human.</p>

<p>"She has a message: 'The man will pay up and all will be well.
Be a good man, Wat, and we will be happier here then ever we were
on earth'."</p>

<p>The man put his hand over his eyes. As the seeress stood
irresolute the tall young secretary half rose and whispered
something in her ear. The woman shot a swift glance over her left
shoulder in the direction of the visitors.</p>

<p>"I'll come back to it," said she.</p>

<p>She gave two more descriptions to the audience, both of them
rather vague, and both recognized with some reservations. It was
a curious fact that her details were such as she could not
possibly see at the distance. Thus, dealing with a form which she
claimed had built up at the far end of the hall, she could none
the less give the colour of the eyes and small points of the
face. Malone noted the point as one which he could use for
destructive criticism. He was just jotting it down when the
woman's voice sounded louder and, looking up, he found that she
had turned her head and her spectacles were flashing in his
direction.</p>

<p>"It is not often I give a reading from the platform," said
she, her face rotating between him and the audience, "but we have
friends here to-night, and it may interest them to come in
contact with the spirit people. There is a presence building up
behind the gentleman with a moustache&mdash;the gentleman who
sits next to the young lady. Yes, sir, behind you. He is a man of
middle size, rather inclined to shortness. He is old, over sixty,
with white hair, curved nose and a white, small beard of the
variety that is called goatee. He is no relation, I gather, but a
friend. Does that suggest anyone to you, sir?"</p>

<p>Malone shook his head with some contempt. "It would nearly fit
any old man," he whispered to Enid.</p>

<p>"We will try to get a little closer. He has deep lines on his
face. I should say he was an irritable man in his lifetime. He
was quick and nervous in his ways. Does that help you?"</p>

<p>Again Malone shook his head.</p>

<p>"Rot! Perfect rot," he muttered.</p>

<p>"Well, he seems very anxious, so we must do what we can for
him. He holds up a book. It is a learned book. He opens it and I
see diagrams in it. Perhaps he wrote it&mdash;or perhaps he
taught from it. Yes, he nods. He taught from it. He was a
teacher."</p>

<p>Malone remained unresponsive.</p>

<p>"I don't know that I can help him any more. Ah! there is one
thing. He has a mole over his right eyebrow."</p>

<p>Malone started as if he had been stung.</p>

<p>"One mole?" he cried.</p>

<p>The spectacles flashed round again.</p>

<p>"Two moles&mdash;one large, one small."</p>

<p>"My God!" gasped Malone. "It's Professor Summerlee!"</p>

<p>"Ah, you've got it. There's a message: 'Greetings to old
&mdash;' It's a long name and begins with a C. I can't get it.
Does it mean anything?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>In an instant she had turned and was describing something or
someone else. But she had left a badly-shaken man upon the
platform behind her.</p>

<p>It was at this point that the orderly service had a remarkable
interruption which surprised the audience as much as it did the
two visitors. This was the sudden appearance beside the chairman
of a tall, pale-faced bearded man dressed like a superior
artisan, who held up his hand with a quietly impressive gesture
as one who was accustomed to exert authority. He then half-turned
and said a word to Mr. Bolsover.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Miromar of Dalston," said the chairman. "Mr.
Miromar has a message to deliver. We are always glad to hear from
Mr. Miromar."</p>

<p>The reporters could only get a half-view of the newcomer's
face, but both of them were struck by his noble bearing and by
the massive outline of his head which promised very unusual
intellectual power. His voice when he spoke rang clearly and
pleasantly through the hall.</p>

<p>"I have been ordered to give the message wherever I think that
there are ears to hear it. There are some here who are ready for
it, and that is why I have come. They wish that the human race
should gradually understand the situation so that there shall be
the less shock or panic. I am one of several who are chosen to
carry the news."</p>

<p>"A lunatic, I'm afraid!" whispered Malone, scribbling hard
upon his knee. There was a general inclination to smile among the
audience. And yet there was something in the man's manner and
voice which made them hang on every word.</p>

<p>"Things have now reached a climax. The very idea of progress
has been made material. It is progress to go swiftly, to send
swift messages, to build new machinery. All this is a diversion
of real ambition. There is only one real progress
&mdash;spiritual progress. Mankind gives it a lip tribute but
presses on upon its false road of material science.</p>

<p>"The Central Intelligence recognized that amid all the apathy
there was also much honest doubt which had out-grown old creeds
and had a right to fresh evidence. Therefore fresh evidence was
sent&mdash;evidence which made the life after death as clear as
the sun in the heavens. It was laughed at by scientists,
condemned by the churches, became the butt of the newspapers, and
was discarded with contempt. That was the last and greatest
blunder of humanity."</p>

<p>The audience had their chins up now. General speculations were
beyond their mental horizon. But this was very clear to their
comprehension. There was a murmur of sympathy and applause.</p>

<p>"The thing was now hopeless. It had got beyond all control.
Therefore something sterner was needed since Heaven's gift had
been disregarded. The blow fell. Ten million young men were laid
dead upon the ground. Twice as many were mutilated. That was
God's first warning to mankind. But it was vain. The same dull
materialism prevailed as before. Years of grace were given, and
save the stirrings of the spirit seen in such churches as these,
no change was anywhere to be seen. The nations heaped up fresh
loads of sin, and sin must ever be atoned for. Russia became a
cesspool. Germany was unrepentant of her terrible materialism
which had been the prime cause of the war. Spain and Italy were
sunk in alternate atheism and superstition. France had no
religious ideal. Britain was confused and distracted, full of
wooden sects which had nothing of life in them. America had
abused her glorious opportunities and, instead of being the
loving younger brother to a stricken Europe, she held up all
economic reconstruction by her money claims; she dishonoured the
signature of her own president, and she refused to join that
League of Peace which was the one hope of the future. All have
sinned, but some more than others, and their punishment will be
in exact proportion.</p>

<p>"And that punishment soon comes. These are the exact words I
have been asked to give you. I read them lest I should in any way
garble them."</p>

<p>He took a slip of paper from his pocket and read:</p>

<p>"'What we want is, not that folk should be frightened, but
that they should begin to change themselves&mdash;to develop
themselves on more spiritual lines. We are not trying to make
people nervous, but to prepare while there is yet time. The world
cannot go on as it has done. It would destroy itself if it did.
Above all we must sweep away the dark cloud of theology which has
come between mankind and God'."</p>

<p>He folded up the paper and replaced it in his pocket. "That is
what I have been asked to tell you. Spread the news where there
seems to be a window in the soul. Say to them, 'Repent! Reform!
the Time is at hand'."</p>

<p>He had paused and seemed about to turn. The spell was broken.
The audience rustled and leaned back in its seats. Then a voice
from the back:</p>

<p>"Is this the end of the world, mister?"</p>

<p>"No," said the stranger, curtly.</p>

<p>"Is it the Second Coming?" asked another voice.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>With quick light steps he threaded his way among the chairs on
the platform and stood near the door. When Malone next looked
round he was gone.</p>

<p>"He is one of these Second-coming fanatics," he whispered to
Enid. "There are a lot of them&mdash;Christadelphians,
Russellites, Bible Students and what-not. But he was
impressive."</p>

<p>"Very," said Enid.</p>

<p>"We have, I am sure, been very interested in what our friend
has told us," said the chairman. "Mr. Miromar is in hearty
sympathy with our movement even though he cannot be said actually
to belong to it. I am sure he is always welcome upon our
platforms. As to his prophecy, it seems to me the world has had
enough trouble without our anticipating any more. If it is as our
friend says, we can't do much to mend the matter. We can only go
about our daily jobs, do them as well as we can, and await the
event in full confidence of help from above. If it's the Day of
Judgment to-morrow," he added, smiling, "I mean to look after my
provision store at Hammersmith to-day. We shall now continue with
the service."</p>

<p>There was a vigorous appeal for money and a great deal about
the building-fund from the young secretary. "It's a shame to
think that there are more left in the street than in the building
on a Sunday night. We all give our services. No one takes a
penny. Mrs. Debbs is here for her bare expenses. But we want
another thousand pounds before we can start. There is one brother
here who mortgaged his house to help us. That's the spirit that
wins. Now let us see what you can do for us to-night."</p>

<p>A dozen soup-plates circulated, and a hymn was sung to the
accompaniment of much chinking of coin. Enid and Malone conversed
in undertones.</p>

<p>"Professor Summerlee died, you know, at Naples last year."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember him well."</p>

<p>"And 'old C' was, of course, your father."</p>

<p>"It was really remarkable."</p>

<p>"Poor old Summerlee. He thought survival was an absurdity. And
here he is&mdash;or here he seems to be."</p>

<p>The soup-plates returned&mdash;it was mostly brown soup,
unhappily, and they were deposited on the table where the eager
eye of the secretary appraised their value. Then the little
shaggy man from Australia gave a benediction in the same simple
fashion as the opening prayer. It needed no Apostolic succession
or laying-on of hands to make one feel that his words were from a
human heart and might well go straight to a Divine one. Then the
audience rose and sang their final farewell hymn&mdash;a hymn
with a haunting tune and a sad, sweet refrain of "God keep you
safely till we meet once more." Enid was surprised to feel the
tears running down her cheeks. These earnest, simple folks with
their direct methods had wrought upon her more than all the
gorgeous service and rolling music of the cathedral.</p>

<p>Mr. Bolsover, the stout president, was in the waiting-room and
so was Mrs. Debbs.</p>

<p>"Well, I expect you are going to let us have it," he laughed.
"We are used to it Mr. Malone. We don't mind. But you will see
the turn some day. These articles may rise up in judgement."</p>

<p>"I will treat it fairly, I assure you."</p>

<p>"Well, we ask no more." The medium was leaning with her elbow
on the mantel piece, austere and aloof.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are tired," said Enid.</p>

<p>"No, young lady, I am never tired in doing the work of the
spirit people. They see to that."</p>

<p>"May I ask," Malone ventured, "whether you ever knew Professor
Summerlee?"</p>

<p>The medium shook her head. "No, sir, no. They always think I
know them. I know none of them. They come and I describe
them."</p>

<p>"How do you get the message?"</p>

<p>"Clairaudient. I hear it. I hear them all the time. The poor
things all want to come through and they pluck at me and pull me
and pester me on the platform. 'Me next&mdash;me&mdash;me'!
That's what I hear. I do my best, but I can't handle them
all."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me anything of that prophetic person?" asked
Malone of the chairman. Mr. Bolsover shrugged his shoulders with
a deprecating smile.</p>

<p>"He is an Independent. We see him now and again as a sort of
comet passing across us. By the way, it comes back to me that he
prophesied the war. I'm a practical man myself. Sufficient for
the day is the evil thereof. We get plenty in ready cash without
any bills for the future. Well, good night! Treat us as well as
you can."</p>

<p>"Good night," said Enid.</p>

<p>"Good night," said Mrs. Debbs. "By the way, young lady, you
are a medium yourself. Good night!"</p>

<p>And so they found themselves in the street once more inhaling
long draughts of the night air. It was sweet after that crowded
hall. A minute later they were in the rush of the Edgware Road
and Malone had hailed a cab to carry them back to Victoria
Gardens.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch03" id="ch03"></a>III. &mdash; IN WHICH PROFESSOR
CHALLENGER GIVES HIS OPINION</h2>

<p class="first">ENID had stepped into the cab and Malone was
following when his name was called and a man came running down
the street. He was tall, middle-aged, handsome and well-dressed,
with the clean-shaven, self-confident face of the successful
surgeon.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Malone! Stop!"</p>

<p>"Why, it's Atkinson! Enid, let me introduce you. This is Mr.
Atkinson of St. Mary's about whom I spoke to your father. Can we
give you a lift? We are going towards Victoria."</p>

<p>"Capital!" The surgeon followed them into the cab. "I was
amazed to see you at a Spiritualist meeting."</p>

<p>"We were only there professionally. Miss Challenger and I are
both on the Press."</p>

<p>"Oh, really! The <em>Daily Gazette</em>, I suppose, as before.
Well, you will have one more subscriber, for I shall want to see
what you made of to-night's show."</p>

<p>"You'll have to wait till next Sunday. It is one of a
series."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, I can't wait as long as that. What did you make of
it?"</p>

<p>"I really don't know. I shall have to read my notes carefully
to-morrow and think it over, and compare impressions with my
colleague here. She has the intuition, you see, which goes for so
much in religious matters."</p>

<p>"And what is your intuition, Miss Challenger?"</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;oh yes, good! But, dear me, what an extraordinary
mixture!"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. I have been several times and it always leaves
the same mixed impression upon my own mind. Some of it is
ludicrous, and some of it might be dishonest, and yet again some
of it is clearly wonderful."</p>

<p>"But you are not on the Press. Why were you there?"</p>

<p>"Because I am deeply interested. You see, I am a student of
psychic matters and have been for some years am not a convinced
one but I am sympathetic, and I have sufficient sense of
proportion to realize that while I seem to be sitting in judgment
upon the subject it may in truth be the subject which is sitting
in judgment upon me."</p>

<p>Malone nodded appreciation.</p>

<p>"It is enormous. You will realize that as you get to close
grips with it. It is half a dozen great subjects in one. And it
is all in the hands of these good humble folk who, in the face of
every discouragement and personal loss, have carried it on for
more than seventy years. It is really very like the rise of
Christianity. It was run by slaves and underlings until it
gradually extended upwards. There were three hundred years
between Caesar's slave and Caesar getting the light."</p>

<p>"But the preacher!" cried Enid in protest.</p>

<p>Mr. Atkinson laughed.</p>

<p>"You mean our friend from Atlantis. What a terrible bore the
fellow was! I confess I don't know what to make of performances
like that. Self-deception, I think, and the temporary emergence
of some fresh strand of personality which dramatizes itself in
this way. The only thing I am quite sure of is that it is not
really an inhabitant of Atlantis who arrives from his long voyage
with this awful cargo of platitudes. Well, here we are!"</p>

<p>"I have to deliver this young lady safe and sound to her
father," said Malone. "Look here, Atkinson, don't leave us. The
Professor would really like to see you."</p>

<p>"What at this hour! Why, he would throw me down the
stairs."</p>

<p>"You've been hearing stories," said Enid. "Really it is not so
bad as that. Some people annoy him, but I am sure you are not one
of them. Won't you chance it?"</p>

<p>"With that encouragement, certainly." And the three walked
down the bright outer corridor to the lift. Challenger, clad now
in a brilliant blue dressing-gown, was eagerly awaiting them. He
eyed Atkinson as a fighting bulldog eyes some canine stranger.
The inspection seemed to satisfy him, however, for he growled
that he was glad to meet him.</p>

<p>"I've heard of your name, sir, and of your rising reputation.
Your resection of the cord last year made some stir, I
understand. But have you been down among the lunatics also?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you call them so," said Atkinson with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens, what else could I call them? I remember now
that my young friend here" (Challenger had a way of alluding to
Malone as if he were a promising boy of ten) "told me you were
studying the subject." He roared with offensive laughter. "'The
proper study of mankind is spooks', eh, Mr. Atkinson?"</p>

<p>"Dad really knows nothing about it, so don't be offended with
him," said Enid. "But I assure you, Dad, you would have been
interested." She proceeded to give a sketch of their adventures,
though interrupted by a running commentary of groans, grunts and
derisive jeers. It was only when the Summerlee episode was
reached that Challenger's indignation and contempt could no
longer be restrained. The old volcano blew his head off and a
torrent of red-hot invective descended upon his listeners.</p>

<p>"The blasphemous rascals!" he shouted. "To think that they
can't let poor old Summerlee rest in his grave. We had our
differences in his time and I will admit that I was compelled to
take a moderate view of his intelligence" but if he came back
from the grave he would certainly have something worth hearing to
say to us. It is an absurdity&mdash;a wicked, indecent absurdity
upon the face of it. I object to any friend of mine being made a
puppet for the laughter of an audience of fools. They didn't
laugh! They must have laughed when they heard an educated man, a
man whom I have met upon equal terms, talking such nonsense. I
say it was nonsense. Don't contradict me, Malone. I won't have
it! His message might have been the postscript of a schoolgirl's
letter. Isn't that nonsense, coming from such a source? Are you
not in agreement, Mr. Atkinson? No! I had hoped better things
from you."</p>

<p>"But the description?"</p>

<p>"Good Heavens, where are your brains? Have not the names of
Summerlee and Malone been associated with my own in some
peculiarly feeble fiction which attained some notoriety? Is it
not also known that you two innocents were doing the Churches
week by week? Was it not patent that sooner or later you would
come to a Spiritualist gathering? Here was a chance for a
convert! They set a bait and poor old gudgeon Malone came along
and swallowed it. Here he is with the hook still stuck in his
silly mouth. Oh, yes, Malone, plain speaking is needed and you
shall have it." The Professor's black mane was bristling and his
eyes glaring from one member of the company to another.</p>

<p>"Well, we want every view expressed," said Atkinson.</p>

<p>"You seem very qualified, sir, to express the negative one. At
the same time I would repeat in my own person the words of
Thackeray. He said to some objector: 'What you say is natural,
but if you had seen what I have seen you might alter your
opinion'. Perhaps sometime you will be able to look into the
matter, for your high position in the scientific world would give
your opinion great weight."</p>

<p>"If I have a high place in the scientific world as you say, it
is because I have concentrated upon what is useful and discarded
what is nebulous or absurd. My brain, sir, does not pare the
edges. It cuts right through. It has cut right through this and
has found fraud and folly."</p>

<p>"Both are there at times," said Atkinson, "and yet&mdash;and
yet! Ah, well, Malone, I'm some way from home and it is late. You
will excuse me, Professor. I am honoured to have met you."</p>

<p>Malone was leaving also and the two friends had a few minutes'
chat before they went their separate ways, Atkinson to Wimpole
Street and Malone to South Norwood, where he was now living.</p>

<p>"Grand old fellow!" said Malone, chuckling. "You must never
get offended with him. He means no harm. He is splendid."</p>

<p>"Of course he is. But if anything could make me a real out-
and-out Spiritualist it is that sort of intolerance. It is very
common, though it is generally cast rather in the tone of the
quiet sneer than of the noisy roar. I like the latter best. By
the way, Malone, if you care to go deeper into this subject I may
be able to help you. You've heard of Linden?"</p>

<p>"Linden, the professional medium. Yes, I've been told he is
the greatest blackguard unhung."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, they usually talk of them like that. You must judge
for yourself. He put his knee-cap out last winter and I put it in
again, and that has made a friendly bond between us. It's not
always easy to get him, and of course a small fee, a guinea I
think, is usual, but if you wanted a sitting I could work
it."</p>

<p>"You think him genuine?"</p>

<p>Atkinson shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I daresay they all take the line of least resistance. I can
only say that I have never detected him in fraud. You must judge
for yourself."</p>

<p>"I will," said Malone. "I am getting hot on this trail. And
there is copy in it, too. When things are more easy I'll write to
you, Atkinson, and we can go more deeply into the matter."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch04" id="ch04"></a>IV. &mdash; WHICH DESCRIBES SOME
STRANGE DOINGS IN HAMMERSMITH</h2>

<p class="first">THE article by the Joint Commissioners (such was
their glorious title) aroused interest and contention. It had
been accompanied by a depreciating leaderette from the sub-editor
which was meant to calm the susceptibilities of his orthodox
readers, as who should say: "These things have to be noticed and
seem to be true, but of course you and I recognize how
pestilential it all is." Malone found himself at once plunged
into a huge correspondence, for and against, which in itself was
enough to show how vitally the question was in the minds of men.
All the previous articles had only elicited a growl here or there
from a hide-bound Catholic or from an iron-clad Evangelical, but
now his post-bag was full. Most of them were ridiculing the idea
that psychic forces existed and many were from writers who,
whatever they might know of psychic forces, had obviously not yet
learned to spell. The Spiritualists were in many cases not more
pleased than the others, for Malone had&mdash; even while his
account was true&mdash;exercised a journalist's privilege of
laying an accent on the more humorous sides of it.</p>

<p>One morning in the succeeding week Mr. Malone was aware of a
large presence in the small room wherein he did his work at the
office. A page-boy, who preceded the stout visitor, had laid a
card on the corner of the table which bore the legend 'James
Bolsover, Provision Merchant, High Street, Hammersmith.' It was
none other than the genial president of last Sunday's
congregation. He wagged a paper accusingly at Malone, but his
good-humoured face was wreathed in smiles.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said he. "I told you that the funny side would
get you."</p>

<p>"Don't you think it a fair account?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, Mr. Malone, I think you and the young woman have
done your best for us. But, of course, you know nothing and it
all seems queer to you. Come to think of it, it would be a deal
queerer if all the clever men who leave this earth could not
among them find some way of getting a word back to us."</p>

<p>"But it's such a stupid word sometimes."</p>

<p>"Well, there are a lot of stupid people leave the world. They
don't change. And then, you know, one never knows what sort of
message is needed. We had a clergyman in to see Mrs. Debbs
yesterday. He was broken-hearted because he had lost his
daughter. Mrs. Debbs got several messages through that she was
happy and that only his grief hurt her. 'That's no use', said he.
'Anyone could say that. That's not my girl'. And then suddenly
she said: 'But I wish to goodness you would not wear a Roman
collar with a coloured shirt'. That sounded a trivial message,
but the man began to cry. 'That's her', he sobbed. 'She was
always chipping me about my collars'. It's the little things that
count in this life&mdash;just the homely, intimate things, Mr.
Malone."</p>

<p>Malone shook his head.</p>

<p>"Anyone would remark on a coloured shirt and a clerical
collar."</p>

<p>Mr. Bolsover laughed. "You're a hard proposition. So was I
once, so I can't blame you. But I called here with a purpose. I
expect you are a busy man and I know that I am, so I'll get down
to the brass tacks. First, I wanted to say that all our people
that have any sense are pleased with the article. Mr. Algernon
Mailey wrote me that it would do good, and if he is pleased we
are all pleased."</p>

<p>"Mailey the barrister?"</p>

<p>"Mailey, the religious reformer. That's how he will be
known."</p>

<p>"Well, what else?"</p>

<p>"Only that we would help you if you and the young lady wanted
to go further in the matter. Not for publicity, mind you, but
just for your own good&mdash;though we don't shrink from
publicity, either. I have psychical phenomena seances at my own
home without a professional medium, and if you would like..."</p>

<p>"There's nothing I would like so much."</p>

<p>"Then you shall come&mdash;both of you. I don't have many
outsiders. I wouldn't have one of those psychic research people
inside my doors. Why should I go out of my way to be insulted by
all their suspicions and their traps? They seem to think that
folk have no feelings. But you have some ordinary common sense.
That's all we ask."</p>

<p>"But I don't believe. Would that not stand in the way?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least. So long as you are fair-minded and don't
disturb the conditions, all is well. Spirits out of the body
don't like disagreeable people any more than spirits in the body
do. Be gentle and civil, same as you would to any other
company."</p>

<p>"Well, I can promise that."</p>

<p>"They are funny sometimes," said Mr. Bolsover, in reminiscent
vein. "It is as well to keep on the right side of them. They are
not allowed to hurt humans, but we all do things we're not
allowed to do, and they are very human themselves. You remember
how the <em>Times</em> correspondent got his head cut open with
the tambourine in one of the Davenport Brothers' seances. Very
wrong, of course, but it happened. No friend ever got his head
cut open. There was another case down Stepney way. A money lender
went to a seance. Some victim that he had driven to suicide got
into the medium. He got the moneylender by the throat and it was
a close thing for his life. But I'm off, Mr. Malone. We sit once
a week and have done for four years without a break. Eight
o'clock Thursdays. Give us a day's notice and I'll get Mr. Mailey
to meet you. He can answer questions better than I. Next
Thursday! Very good." And Mr. Bolsover lurched out of the
room.</p>

<p>Both Malone and Enid Challenger had, perhaps, been more shaken
by their short experience than they had admitted, but both were
sensible people who agreed that every possible natural cause
should be exhausted&mdash;and very thoroughly exhausted
&mdash;before the bounds of what is possible should be enlarged.
Both of them had the utmost respect for the ponderous intellect
of Challenger and were affected by his strong views, though
Malone was compelled to admit in the frequent arguments in which
he was plunged that the opinion of a clever man who has had no
experience is really of less value than that of the man in the
street who has actually been there.</p>

<p>These arguments, as often as not, were with Mervin, editor of
the psychic paper Dawn, which dealt with every phase of the
occult, from the lore of the Rosicrucians to the strange regions
of the students of the Great Pyramid, or of those who uphold the
Jewish origin of our blonde Anglo-Saxons. Mervin was a small,
eager man with a brain of a high order, which might have carried
him to the most lucrative heights of his profession had he not
determined to sacrifice worldly prospects in order to help what
seemed to him to be a great truth. As Malone was eager for
knowledge and Mervin was equally keen to impart it, the waiters
at the Literary Club found it no easy matter to get them away
from the corner-table in the window at which they were wont to
lunch. Looking down at the long, grey curve of the Embankment and
the noble river with its vista of bridges, the pair would linger
over their coffee, smoking cigarettes and discussing various
sides of this most gigantic and absorbing subject, which seemed
already to have disclosed new horizons to the mind of Malone.</p>

<p>There was one warning given by Mervin which aroused impatience
amounting almost to anger in Malone's mind. He had the hereditary
Irish objection to coercion and it seemed to him to be appearing
once more in an insidious and particularly objectionable
form.</p>

<p>"You are going to one of Bolsover's family seances," said
Mervin. "They are, of course, well known among our people, though
few have been actually admitted, so you may consider yourself
privileged. He has clearly taken a fancy to you."</p>

<p>"He thought I wrote fairly about them."</p>

<p>"Well, it wasn't much of an article, but still among the
dreary, purblind nonsense that assails us it did show some traces
of dignity and balance and sense of proportion."</p>

<p>Malone waved a deprecating cigarette.</p>

<p>"Bolsover's seances and others like them are, or course,
things of no moment to the real psychic. They are like the rude
foundations of a building which certainly help to sustain the
edifice, but are forgotten when once you come to inhabit it. It
is the higher superstructure with which we have to do. You would
think that the physical phenomena were the whole subject&mdash;
those and a fringe of ghosts and haunted houses&mdash;if you were
to believe the cheap papers who cater for the sensationalist. Of
course, these physical phenomena have a use of their own. They
rivet the attention of the inquirer and encourage him to go
further. Personally, having seen them all, I would not go across
the road to see them again. But I would go across many roads to
get high messages from the beyond."</p>

<p>"Yes, I quite appreciate the distinction, looking at it from
your point of view. Personally, of course, I am equally agnostic
as to the messages and the phenomena."</p>

<p>"Quite so. St. Paul was a good psychic. He makes the point so
neatly that even his ignorant translators were unable to disguise
the real occult meanings as they have succeeded in doing in so
many cases."</p>

<p>"Can you quote it?"</p>

<p>"I know my New Testament pretty well, but I am not letter-
perfect. It is the passage where he says that the gift of
tongues, which was an obvious sensational thing, was for the
uninstructed, but that prophecies, that is real spiritual
messages, were for the elect. In other words that an experienced
Spiritualist has no need of phenomena."</p>

<p>"I'll look that passage up."</p>

<p>"You will find it in Corinthians, I think. By the way, there
must have been a pretty high average of intelligence among those
old congregations if Paul's letters could have been read aloud to
them and thoroughly comprehended."</p>

<p>"That is generally admitted, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Well, it is a concrete example of it. However, I am down a
side-track. What I wanted to say to you is that you must not take
Bolsover's little spirit circus too seriously. It is honest as
far as it goes, but it goes a mighty short way. It's a disease,
this phenomena hunting. I know some of our people, women mostly,
who buzz around seance rooms continually, seeing the same thing
over and over, sometimes real, sometimes, I fear, imitation. What
better are they for that as souls or as citizens or in any other
way? No, when your foot is firm on the bottom rung don't mark
time on it, but step up to the next rung and get firm upon
that."</p>

<p>"I quite get your point. But I'm still on the solid
ground."</p>

<p>"Solid!" cried Mervin. "Good Lord! But the paper goes to press
to-day and I must get down to the printer. With a circulation of
ten thousand or so we do things modestly, you know&mdash;not like
you plutocrats of the daily press. I am practically the
staff."</p>

<p>"You said you had a warning."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I wanted to give you a warning." Mervin's thin,
eager face became intensely serious. "If you have any ingrained
religious or other prejudices which may cause you to turn down
this subject after you have investigated it, then don't
investigate at all&mdash;for it is dangerous."</p>

<p>"What do you mean&mdash;dangerous?"</p>

<p>"They don't mind honest doubt, or honest criticism, but if
they are badly treated they are dangerous."</p>

<p>"Who are 'they'?"</p>

<p>"Ah, who are they? I wonder. Guides, controls, psychic
entities of some kind. Who the agents of vengeance&mdash;or I
should say justice&mdash; are, is really not essential. The point
is that they exist."</p>

<p>"Oh, rot, Mervin!"</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure of that."</p>

<p>"Pernicious rot! These are the old theological bogies of the
Middle Ages coming up again. I am surprised at a sensible man
like you!"</p>

<p>Mervin smiled&mdash;he had a whimsical smile&mdash;but his
eyes, looking out from under bushy yellow brows, were as serious
as ever.</p>

<p>"You may come to change your opinion. There are some queer
sides to this question. As a friend I put you wise to this
one."</p>

<p>"Well, put me wise, then."</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, Mervin went into the matter. He rapidly
sketched the career and fate of a number of men who had, in his
opinion, played an unfair game with these forces, become an
obstruction, and suffered for it. He spoke of judges who had
given prejudiced decisions against the cause, of journalists who
had worked up stunt cases for sensational purposes and to throw
discredit on the movement; of others who had interviewed mediums
to make game of them, or who, having started to investigate, had
drawn back alarmed, and given a negative decision when their
inner soul knew that the facts were true. It was a formidable
list, for it was long and precise, but Malone was not to be
driven.</p>

<p>"If you pick your cases I have no doubt one could make such a
list about any subject. Mr. Jones said that Raphael was a
bungler, and Mr. Jones died of angina pectoris. Therefore it is
dangerous to criticize Raphael. That seems to be the
argument."</p>

<p>"Well, if you like to think so."</p>

<p>"Take the other side. Look at Morgate. He has always been an
enemy, for he is a convinced materialist. But he prospers
&mdash;look at his professorship."</p>

<p>"Ah, an honest doubter. Certainly. Why not?"</p>

<p>"And Morgan who at one time exposed mediums."</p>

<p>"If they were really false he did good service."</p>

<p>"And Falconer who has written so bitterly about you?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Falconer! Do you know anything of Falconer's private
life? No. Well, take it from me he has got his dues. He doesn't
know why. Some day these gentlemen will begin to compare notes
and then it may dawn on them. But they get it."</p>

<p>He went on to tell a horrible story of one who had devoted his
considerable talents to picking Spiritualism to pieces, though
really convinced of its truth, because his worldly ends were
served thereby. The end was ghastly&mdash;too ghastly for
Malone.</p>

<p>"Oh, cut it out, Mervin!" he cried impatiently. "I'll say what
I think, no more and no less, and I won't be cared by you or your
spooks into altering my opinions."</p>

<p>"I never asked you to."</p>

<p>"You got a bit near it. What you have said strikes me as pure
superstition. If what you say is true you should have the police
after you."</p>

<p>"Yes, if we did it. But it is out of our hands. However,
Malone, for what it's worth I have given you the warning and you
can now go your way. Bye-bye! You can always ring me up at the
office of Dawn."</p>

<p>If you want to know if a man is of the true Irish blood there
is one infallible test. Put him in front of a swing-door with
"Push" or "Pull" printed upon it. The Englishman will obey like a
sensible man. The Irishman, with less sense but more
individuality, will at once and with vehemence do the opposite.
So it was with Malone. Mervin's well-meant warning simply raised
a rebellious spirit within him, and when he called for Enid to
take her to the Bolsover seance he had gone back several degrees
in his dawning sympathy for the subject. Challenger bade them
farewell with many gibes, his beard projecting forward and his
eyes closed with upraised eyebrows, as was his wont when inclined
to be facetious.</p>

<p>"You have your powder-bag, my dear Enid. If you see a
particularly good specimen of ectoplasm in the course of the
evening don't forget your father. I have a microscope, chemical
reagents and everything ready. Perhaps even a small poltergeist
might come your way. Any trifle would be welcome."</p>

<p>His bull's bellow of laughter followed them into the lift.</p>

<p>The provision merchant's establishment of Mr. Bolsover proved
to be a euphemism for an old-fashioned grocer's shop in the most
crowded part of Hammersmith. The neighbouring church was chiming
out the three-quarters as the taxi drove up, and the shop was
full of people. So Enid and Malone walked up and down outside. As
they were so engaged another taxi drove up and a large, untidy-
looking, ungainly bearded man in a suit of Harris tweed stepped
out of it. He glanced at his watch and then began to pace the
pavement. Presently he noted the others and came up to them.</p>

<p>"May I ask if you are the journalists who are going to attend
the seance? I thought so. Old Bolsover is terribly busy so you
were wise to wait. Bless him, he is one of God's saints in his
way."</p>

<p>"You are Mr. Algernon Mailey, I presume?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I am the gentleman whose credulity is giving rise to
considerable anxiety upon the part of my friends, as one of the
rags remarked the other day." His laugh was so infectious that
the others were-bound to laugh also. Certainly, with his athletic
proportions, which had run a little to seed but were still
notable, and with his virile voice and strong if homely face, he
gave no impression of instability.</p>

<p>"We are all labelled with some stigma by our opponents" said
he. "I wonder what yours will be."</p>

<p>"We must not sail under false colours, Mr. Mailey," said Enid.
"We are not yet among the believers."</p>

<p>"Quite right. You should take your time over it. It is
infinitely the most important thing in the world, so it is worth
taking time over. I took many years myself. Folk can be blamed
for neglecting it, but no one can be blamed for being cautious in
examination. Now I am all out for it, as you are aware, because I
know it is true. There is such a difference between believing and
knowing. I lecture a good deal. But I never want to convert my
audience. I don't believe in sudden conversions. They are
shallow, superficial things. All I want is to put the thing
before the people as clearly as I can. I just tell them the truth
and why we know it is the truth. Then my job is done. They can
take it or leave it. If they are wise they will explore along the
paths that I indicate. If they are unwise they miss their chance.
I don't want to press them or to proselytize. It's their affair,
not mine."</p>

<p>"Well, that seems a reasonable view," said Enid, who was
attracted by the frank manner of their new acquaintance. They
were standing now in the full flood of light cast by Bolsover's
big plate-glass window. She had a good look at him, his broad
forehead, his curious grey eyes, thoughtful and yet eager, his
straw-coloured beard which indicated the outline of an aggressive
chin. He was solidity personified&mdash;the very opposite of the
fanatic whom she had imagined. His name had been a good deal in
the papers lately as a protagonist in the long battle, and she
remembered that it had never been mentioned without an answering
snort from her father.</p>

<p>"I wonder," she said to Malone, "what would happen if Mr.
Mailey were locked up in a room with Dad!"</p>

<p>Malone laughed. "There used to be a schoolboy question as to
what would occur if an irresistible force were to strike an
invincible obstacle."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are the daughter of Professor Challenger," said
Mailey with interest. "He is a big figure in the scientific
world. What a grand world it would be if it would only realize
its own limitations."</p>

<p>"I don't quite follow you."</p>

<p>"It is this scientific world which is at the bottom of much of
our materialism. It has helped us in comfort&mdash;if comfort is
any use to us. Otherwise it has usually been a curse to us, for
it has called itself progress and given us a false impression
that we are making progress, whereas we are really drifting very
steadily backwards."</p>

<p>"Really, I can't quite agree with you there, Mr. Mailey," said
Malone, who was getting restive under what seemed to him dogmatic
assertion. "Look at wireless. Look at the S.O.S. call at sea. Is
that not a benefit to mankind?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it works out all right sometimes. I value my electric
reading-lamp, and that is a product of science. It gives us, as I
said before, comfort and occasionally safety."</p>

<p>"Why, then, do you depreciate it?"</p>

<p>"Because it obscures the vital thing&mdash;the object of life.
We were not put into this planet in order that we should go fifty
miles an hour in a motor-car, or cross the Atlantic in an
airship, or send messages either with or without wires. These are
the mere trimmings and fringes of life. But these men of science
have so riveted our attention on these fringes that we forget the
central object."</p>

<p>"I don't follow you."</p>

<p>"It is not how fast you go that matters, it is the object of
your journey. It is not how you send a message, it is what the
value of the message may be. At every stage this so-called
progress may be a curse, and yet as long as we use the word we
confuse it with real progress and imagine that we are doing that
for which God sent us into the world."</p>

<p>"Which is?"</p>

<p>"To prepare ourselves for the next phase of life. There is
mental preparation and spiritual preparation, and we are
neglecting both. To be in an old age better men and women, more
unselfish, more broadminded, more genial and tolerant, that is
what we are for. It is a soul factory, and it is turning out a
bad article. But Hullo!" he burst into his infectious laugh.
"Here I am delivering my lecture in the street. Force of habit,
you see. My son says that if you press the third button of my
waistcoat I automatically deliver a lecture. But here is the good
Bolsover to your rescue."</p>

<p>The worthy grocer had caught sight of them through the window
and came bustling out, untying his white apron.</p>

<p>"Good evening, all! I won't have you waiting in the cold.
Besides, there's the clock, and time's up. It does not do to keep
them waiting. Punctuality for all that's my motto and theirs. My
lads will shut up the shop. This way, and mind the sugar-
barrel."</p>

<p>They threaded their way amid boxes of dried fruits and piles
of cheese, finally passing between two great casks which hardly
left room for the grocer's portly form. A narrow door beyond
opened into the residential part of the establishment. Ascending
the narrow stair, Bolsover threw open a door and the visitors
found themselves in a considerable room in which a number of
people were seated round a large table. There was Mrs. Bolsover
herself, large, cheerful and buxom like her husband. Three
daughters were all of the same pleasing type. There was an
elderly woman who seemed to be some relation, and two other
colourless females who were described as neighbours and
Spiritualists. The only other man was a little grey-headed fellow
with a pleasant face and quick, twinkling eyes, who sat at a
harmonium in the corner.</p>

<p>"Mr. Smiley, our musician," said Bolsover. "I don't know what
we could do without Mr. Smiley. It's vibrations, you know. Mr.
Mailey could tell you about that. Ladies, you know Mr. Mailey,
our very good friend. And these are the two inquirers&mdash;Miss
Challenger and Mr. Malone." The Bolsover family all smiled
genially, but the nondescript elderly person rose to her feet and
surveyed them with an austere face.</p>

<p>"You're very welcome here, you two strangers," she said. "But
we would say to you that we want outward reverence. We respect
the shining ones and we will not have them insulted."</p>

<p>"I assure you we are very earnest and fairminded," said
Malone.</p>

<p>"We've had our lesson. We haven't forgotten the Meadows'
affair, Mr. Bolsover."</p>

<p>"No, no, Mrs. Seldon. That won't happen again. We were rather
upset over that," Bolsover added, turning to the visitors. "That
man came here as our guest, and when the lights were out he poked
the other sitters with his finger so as to make them think it was
a spirit hand. Then he wrote the whole thing up as an exposure in
the public Press, when the only fraudulent thing present had been
himself."</p>

<p>Malone was honestly shocked. "I can assure you we are
incapable of such conduct."</p>

<p>The old lady sat down, but still regarded them with a
suspicious eye. Bolsover bustled about and got things ready.</p>

<p>"You sit here Mr. Mailey. Mr. Malone, will you sit between my
wife and my daughter? Where would the young lady like to
sit?"</p>

<p>Enid was feeling rather nervous. "I think," said she, "that I
would like to sit next to Mr. Malone."</p>

<p>Bolsover chuckled and winked at his wife.</p>

<p>"Quite so. Most natural, I am sure." They all settled into
their places. Mr. Bolsover had switched off the electric light,
but a candle burned in the middle of the table. Malone thought
what a picture it would have made for a Rembrandt. Deep shadows
draped it in, but the yellow light flickered upon the circle of
faces&mdash;the strong, homely, heavy features of Bolsover, the
solid line of his family circle, the sharp, austere countenance
of Mrs. Seldon, the earnest eyes and yellow beard of Mailey, the
worn, tired faces of the two Spiritualist women, and finally the
firm, noble profile of the girl who sat beside him. The whole
world had suddenly narrowed down to that one little group, so
intensely concentrated upon its own purpose.</p>

<p>On the table there was scattered a curious collection of
objects, which had all the same appearance of tools which had
long been used. There was a battered brass speaking-trumpet, very
discoloured, a tambourine, a musical-box, and a number of smaller
objects. "We never know what they may want," said Bolsover,
waving his hand over them. "If Wee One calls for a thing and it
isn't there she lets us know all about it&mdash;oh, yes,
something shocking!"</p>

<p>"She has a temper of her own has Wee One," remarked Mrs.
Bolsover.</p>

<p>"Why not, the pretty dear?" said the austere lady. "I expect
she has enough to try it with researchers and what-not. I often
wonder she troubles to come at all."</p>

<p>"Wee One is our little girl guide," said Bolsover. "You'll
hear her presently."</p>

<p>"I do hope she will come," said Enid.</p>

<p>"Well, she never failed us yet, except when that man Meadows
clawed hold of the trumpet and put it outside the circle."</p>

<p>"Who is the medium?" asked Malone.</p>

<p>"Well, we don't know ourselves. We all help, I think. Maybe, I
give as much as anyone. And mother, she is a help."</p>

<p>"Our family is a co-operative store," said his wife, and
everyone laughed.</p>

<p>"I thought one medium was necessary."</p>

<p>"It is usual but not necessary," said Mailey in his deep,
authoritative voice. "Crawford showed that pretty clearly in the
Gallagher seances when he proved, by weighing chairs, that
everyone in the circle lost from half to two pounds at a sitting,
though the medium, Miss Kathleen, lost as many as ten or twelve.
Here the long series of sittings&mdash;How long, Mr.
Bolsover?"</p>

<p>"Four years unbroken."</p>

<p>"The long series has developed everyone to some extent, so
that there is a high average output from each, instead of an
extraordinary amount from one."</p>

<p>"Output of what?"</p>

<p>"Animal magnetism, ectoplasm&mdash;in fact, power. That is the
most comprehensive word. The Christ used that word. 'Much power
has gone out of me'. It is <em>'dunamis'</em> in the Greek, but
the translators missed the point and translated it 'virtue'. If a
good Greek scholar who was also a profound occult student was to
re-translate the New Testament we should get some eye-openers.
Dear old Ellis Powell did a little in that direction. His death
was a loss to the world."</p>

<p>"Aye, indeed," said Bolsover in a reverent voice. "But now,
before we get to work, Mr. Malone, I want you just to note one or
two things. You see the white spots on the trumpet and the
tambourine? Those are luminous points so that we can see where
they are. The table is just our dining-table, good British oak.
You can examine it if you like. But you'll see things that won't
depend upon the table. Now, Mr. Smiley, out goes the light and
we'll ask you for 'The Rock of Ages'."</p>

<p>The harmonium droned in the darkness and the circle sang. They
sang very tunefully, too, for the girls had fresh voices and true
ears. Low and vibrant, the solemn rhythm became most impressive
when no sense but that of hearing was free to act. Their hands,
according to instructions, were laid lightly upon the table, and
they were warned not to cross their legs. Malone, with his hand
touching Enid's, could feel the little quiverings which showed
that her nerves were highly strung. The homely, jovial voice of
Bolsover relieved the tension.</p>

<p>"That should do it," he said. "I feel as if the conditions
were good to-night. Just a touch of frost in the air, too. I'll
ask you now to join with me in prayer."</p>

<p>It was effective, that simple, earnest prayer in the darkness
&mdash;an inky darkness which was only broken by the last red
glow of a dying fire.</p>

<p>"Oh, great Father of us all," said the voice. "You who are
beyond our thoughts and who yet pervade our lives, grant that all
evil may be kept from us this night and that we may be privileged
to get in touch, if only for an hour, with those who dwell upon a
higher plane than ours. You are our Father as well as theirs.
Permit us, for a short space, to meet in brotherhood, that we may
have an added knowledge of that eternal life which awaits us, and
so be helped during our years of waiting in this lower world." He
ended with the "Our Father", in which we all joined. Then they
all sat in expectant silence Outside was the dull roar of traffic
and the occasional ill-tempered squawk of a passing car. Inside
there was absolute stillness. Enid and Malone felt every sense
upon the alert and every nerve on edge as they gazed out into the
gloom.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing, mother," said Bolsover at last. "It's the
strange company. New vibrations. They have to tune them in to get
harmony. Give us another tune, Mr. Smiley." Again the harmonium
droned. It was still playing when a woman's voice cried: "Stop!
Stop! They are here!"</p>

<p>Again they waited without result.</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes! I heard Wee One. She is here, right enough. I'm
sure of it."</p>

<p>Silence again, and then it came&mdash;such a marvel to the
visitors, such a matter of course to the circle.</p>

<p>"Gooda evenin'!" cried a voice.</p>

<p>There was a burst of greeting and of welcoming laughter from
the circle. They were all speaking at once. "Good evening, Wee
One!" "There you are, dear!" "I knew you would come!" "Well done,
little girl guide!"</p>

<p>"Gooda evenin', all!" replied the voice. "Wee One so glad see
Daddy and Mummy and the rest. Oh, what big man with beard!
Mailey, Mister Mailey, I meet him before. He big Mailey, I little
femaley. Glad to see you, Mr. Big Man."</p>

<p>Enid and Malone listened with amazement, but it was impossible
to be nervous in face of the perfectly natural way in which the
company accepted it. The voice was very thin and high&mdash;more
so than any artificial falsetto could produce. It was the voice
of a female child. That was certain. Also that there was no
female child in the room unless one had been smuggled in after
the light went out. That was possible. But the voice seemed to be
in the middle of the table. How could a child get there?</p>

<p>"Easy get there, Mr. Gentleman," said the voice, answering his
unspoken thought. "Daddy strong man. Daddy lift Wee One on to
table. Now I show what Daddy not able to do."</p>

<p>"The trumpet's up!" cried Bolsover.</p>

<p>The little circle of luminous paint rose noiselessly into the
air. Now it was swaying above their heads.</p>

<p>"Go up and hit the ceiling!" cried Bolsover. Up it went and
they heard the metallic tapping above them. Then the high voice
came from above:</p>

<p>"Clever Daddy! Daddy got fishing-rod and put trumpet up to
ceiling. But how Daddy make the voice, eh? What you say, pretty
English Missy? Here is a present from Wee One."</p>

<p>Something soft dropped on Enid's lap. She put her hand down
and felt it.</p>

<p>"It's a flower&mdash;a chrysanthemum. Thank you, Wee One!"</p>

<p>"An apport?" asked Mailey.</p>

<p>"No, no, Mr. Mailey," said Bolsover. "They were in the vase on
the harmonium. Speak to her, Miss Challenger. Keep the vibrations
going."</p>

<p>"Who are you, Wee One?" asked Enid, looking up at the moving
spot above her.</p>

<p>"I am little black girl. Eight-year-old little black
girl."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, dear," said mother in her rich, coaxing voice. "You
were eight when you came to us first, and that was years
ago."</p>

<p>"Years ago to you. All one time to me. I to do my job as
eight-year child. When job done then Wee One become Big One all
in one day. No time here, same as you have. I always eight-year-
old."</p>

<p>"In the ordinary way they grow up exactly as we do here," said
Mailey. "But if they have a special bit of work for which a child
is needed, then as a child they remain It's a sort of arrested
development."</p>

<p>"That's me. 'Rested envelopment'," said the voice proudly. "I
learn good England when big man here."</p>

<p>They all laughed. It was the most genial, free-and-easy
association possible. Malone heard Enid's voice whispering in his
ear.</p>

<p>"Pinch me from time to time, Edward&mdash;just to make me sure
that I am not in a dream."</p>

<p>"I have to pinch myself, too."</p>

<p>"What about your song, Wee One?" asked Bolsover.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeeda! Wee One sing to you." She began some simple
song, but faded away in a squeak, while the trumpet clattered on
to the table.</p>

<p>"Ah, power run down!" said Mailey. "I think a little more
music will set us right. 'Lead, Kindly Light'"</p>

<p>They sang the beautiful hymn together. As the verse closed an
amazing thing happened&mdash;amazing, at least, to the novices,
though it called for no remark from the circle. The trumpet still
shone upon the table, but two voices, those apparently of a man
and a woman, broke out in the air above them and joined very
tunefully in the singing. The hymn died away and all was silence
and tense expectancy once more.</p>

<p>It was broken by a deep male voice from the darkness. It was
an educated English voice, well modulated, a voice which spoke in
a fashion to which the good Bolsover could never attain.</p>

<p>"Good evening, friends. The power seems good tonight."</p>

<p>"Good evening, Luke. Good evening!" cried everyone.</p>

<p>"It is our teaching guide," Bolsover explained. "He is a high
spirit from the sixth sphere who gives us instruction."</p>

<p>"I may seem high to you," said the voice. "But what am I to
those in turn who instruct me! It is not my wisdom. Give me no
credit. I do but pass it on."</p>

<p>"Always like that," said Bolsover. "No swank. It's a sign of
his height."</p>

<p>"I see you have two inquirers present. Good evening, young
lady! You know nothing of your own powers or destiny. You will
find them out. Good evening, sir, you are on the threshold of
great knowledge. Is there any subject upon which you would wish
me to say a few words? I see that you are making notes."</p>

<p>Malone had, as a fact, disengaged his hand in the darkness and
was jotting down in shorthand the sequence of events.</p>

<p>"What shall I speak of?"</p>

<p>"Of love and marriage," suggested Mrs. Bolsover, nudging her
husband.</p>

<p>"Well, I will say a few words on that. I will not take long,
for others are waiting. The room is crowded with spirit people. I
wish you to understand that there is one man, and only one, for
each woman, and one woman only for each man. When those two meet
they fly together and are one through all the endless chain of
existence. Until they meet all unions are mere accidents which
have no meaning. Sooner or later each couple becomes complete. It
may not be here. It may be in the next sphere where the sexes
meet as they do on earth. Or it may be further delayed. But every
man and every woman has his or her affinity, and will find it. Of
earthly marriages perhaps one in five is permanent. The others
are accidental. Real marriage is of the soul and spirit. Sex
actions are a mere external symbol which mean nothing and are
foolish, or even pernicious, when the thing which they should
symbolize is wanting. Am I clear?"</p>

<p>"Very clear," said Mailey.</p>

<p>"Some have the wrong mate here. Some have no mate, which is
more fortunate. But all will sooner or later get the right mate.
That is certain. Do not think that you will not necessarily have
your present husband when you pass over."</p>

<p>"Gawd be praised! Gawd be thanked!" cried a voice.</p>

<p>"No. Mrs. Melder, it is love&mdash;real love&mdash;which
unites us here. He goes his way. You go yours. You are on
separate planes, perhaps. Some day you will each find your own,
when your youth has come back as it will over here."</p>

<p>"You speak of love. Do you mean sexual love?" asked
Mailey.</p>

<p>"Where are we gettin' to?" murmured Mrs. Bolsover.</p>

<p>"Children are not born here. That is only on the earth plane.
It was this aspect of marriage to which the great Teacher
referred when he said: 'There will be neither marriage nor giving
in marriage'. No! It is purer, deeper, more wonderful, a unity of
souls, a complete merging of interests and knowledge without a
loss of individuality. The nearest you ever get to it is the
first high passion, too beautiful for physical expression when
two high-souled lovers meet upon your plane. They find lower
expression afterwards, but they will always in their hearts know
that the first delicate, exquisite soul-union was the more
lovely. So it is with us. Any question?"</p>

<p>"If a woman loves two men equally, what then?" asked
Malone.</p>

<p>"It seldom happens. She nearly always knows which is really
nearest to her. If she really did so, then it would be a proof
that neither was the real affinity, for he is bound to stand high
above all. Of course, if she..."</p>

<p>The voice trailed off and the trumpet fell.</p>

<p>"Sing 'Angels are hoverin' around'!" cried Bolsover. "Smiley,
hit that old harmonium. The vibrations are at zero."</p>

<p>Another bout of music, another silence, and then a most dismal
voice. Never had Enid heard so sad a voice. It was like clods on
a coffin. At first it was a deep mutter. Then it was a prayer
&mdash;a Latin prayer apparently&mdash;for twice the word
<em>Domine</em> sounded and once the word <em>peccavimus</em>.
There was an indescribable air of depression and desolation in
the room. "For God's sake what is it?" cried Malone.</p>

<p>The circle was equally puzzled.</p>

<p>"Some poor chap out of the lower spheres, I think," said
Bolsover. "Orthodox folk say we should avoid them. I say we
should hurry up and help them."</p>

<p>"Right, Bolsover!" said Mailey, with hearty approval. "Get on
with it, quick!"</p>

<p>"Can we do anything for you, friend?"</p>

<p>There was silence.</p>

<p>"He doesn't know. He doesn't understand the conditions. Where
is Luke? He'll know what to do."</p>

<p>"What is it, friend?" asked the pleasant voice of the
guide.</p>

<p>"There is some poor fellow here. We want to help him."</p>

<p>"Ah! yes, yes, he has come from the outer darkness," said Luke
in a sympathetic voice. "He doesn't know. He doesn't understand.
They come over here with a fixed idea, and when they find the
real thing is quite different from anything they have been taught
by the Churches, they are helpless. Some adapt themselves and
they go on. Others don't, and they just wander on unchanging,
like this man. He was a cleric, and a very narrow, bigoted one.
This is the growth of his own mental seed sown upon earth
&mdash;sown in ignorance and reaped in misery."</p>

<p>"What is amiss with him?"</p>

<p>"He does not know he is dead. He walks in the mist. It is all
an evil dream to him. He has been years so. To him it seems an
eternity."</p>

<p>"Why do you not tell him&mdash;instruct him?"</p>

<p>"We cannot. We&mdash;"</p>

<p>The trumpet crashed.</p>

<p>"Music, Smiley, music! Now the vibrations should be
better."</p>

<p>"The higher spirits cannot reach earth-bound folk," said
Mailey. "They are in very different zones of vibration. It is we
who are near them and can help them."</p>

<p>"Yes, you! you!" cried the voice of Luke.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mailey, speak to him. You know him!" The low mutter had
broken out again in the same weary monotone.</p>

<p>"Friend, I would have a word with you," said Mailey in a firm,
loud voice. The mutter ceased and one felt that the invisible
presence was straining its attention. "Friend, we are sorry at
your condition. You have passed on. You see us and you wonder why
we do not see you. You are in the other world. But you do not
know it, because it is not as you expected. You have not been
received as you imagined. It is because you imagined wrong.
Understand that all is well, and that God is good, and that all
happiness is awaiting you if you will but raise your mind and
pray for help, and above all think less of your own condition and
more of those other poor souls who are round you."</p>

<p>There was a silence and Luke spoke again.</p>

<p>"He has heard you. He wants to thank you. He has some glimmer
now of his condition. It will grow within him. He wants to know
if he may come again."</p>

<p>"Yes! yes!" cried Bolsover. "We have quite a number who report
progress from time to time. God bless you, friend. Come as often
as you can." The mutter had ceased and there seemed to be a new
feeling of peace in the air. The high voice of Wee One was
heard.</p>

<p>"Plenty power still left. Red Cloud here. Show what he can do,
if Daddy likes."</p>

<p>"Red Cloud is our Indian control. He is usually busy when any
purely physical phenomena have to be done. You there, Red
Cloud?"</p>

<p>Three loud thuds, like a hammer on wood, sounded from the
darkness.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Red Cloud!"</p>

<p>A new voice, slow, staccato, laboured, sounded above them.</p>

<p>"Good day, Chief! How the squaw? How the papooses? Strange
faces in wigwam to-night."</p>

<p>"Seeking knowledge, Red Cloud. Can you show what you can
do?"</p>

<p>"I try. Wait a little. Do all I can."</p>

<p>Again there was a long hush of expectancy. Then the novices
were faced once more with the miraculous.</p>

<p>There came a dull glow in the darkness. It was apparently a
wisp of luminous vapour. It whisked across from one side to the
other and then circled in the air. By degrees it condensed into a
circular disc of radiance about the size of a bull's-eye lantern.
It cast no reflection round it and was simply a clean-cut circle
in the gloom. Once it approached Enid's face and Malone saw it
clearly from the side.</p>

<p>"Why, there is a hand holding it!" he cried, with sudden
suspicion.</p>

<p>"Yes, there is a materialized hand," said Mailey. "I can see
it clearly."</p>

<p>"Would you like it to touch you" Mr. Malone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if it will."</p>

<p>The light vanished and an instant afterwards Malone felt
pressure upon his own hand. He turned it palm upwards and clearly
felt three fingers laid across it, smooth, warm fingers of adult
size. He closed his own fingers and the hand seemed to melt away
in his grasp.</p>

<p>"It has gone!" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Yes! Red Cloud is not very good at materializations. Perhaps
we don't give him the proper sort of power. But his lights are
excellent."</p>

<p>Several more had broken out. They were of different types,
slow-moving clouds and little dancing sparks like glow-worms. At
the same time both visitors were conscious of a cold wind which
blew upon their faces. It was no delusion, for Enid felt her hair
stream across her forehead.</p>

<p>"You fed the rushing wind," said Mailey. "Some of these lights
would pass for tongues of fire, would they not? Pentecost does
not seem such a very remote or impossible thing, does it?"</p>

<p>The tambourine had risen in the air, and the dot of luminous
paint showed that it was circling round. Presently it descended
and touched their heads each in turn. Then with a jingle it
quivered down upon the table.</p>

<p>"Why a tambourine? It seems always to be a tambourine,"
remarked Malone.</p>

<p>"It is a convenient little instrument," Mailey explained.</p>

<p>"The only one which shows automatically by its noise where it
is flying. I don't know what other I could suggest except a
musical-box."</p>

<p>"Our box here flies round somethin' amazin'," said Mrs.
Bolsover. "It thinks nothing of winding itself up in the air as
it flies. It's a heavy box too."</p>

<p>"Nine pounds," said Bolsover. "Well, we seem to have got to
the end of things. I don't think we shall get much more to-night.
It has not been a bad sitting&mdash;what I should call a fair
average sitting. We must wait a little before we turn on the
light. Well, Mr. Malone, what do you think of it? Let's have any
objections now before we part. That's the worst of you inquirers,
you know. You often bottle things up in your own minds and let
them loose afterwards, when it would have been easy to settle it
at the time. Very nice and polite to our faces, and then we are a
gang of swindlers in the report."</p>

<p>Malone's head was throbbing and he passed his hand over his
heated brow.</p>

<p>"I am confused," he said, "but impressed. Oh, yes, certainly
impressed. I've read of these things, but it is very different
when you see them. What weighs most with me is the obvious
sincerity and sanity of all you people. No one could doubt
that."</p>

<p>"Come. We're gettin' on." said Bolsover.</p>

<p>"I try to think the objections which would be raised by others
who were not present. I'll have to answer them. First, there is
the oddity of it all. It is so different to our preconceptions of
spirit people."</p>

<p>"We must fit our theories to the facts," said Mailey. "Up to
now we have fitted the facts to our theories. You must remember
that we have been dealing to-night&mdash;with all respect to our
dear good hosts&mdash;with a simple, primitive, earthly type of
spirit, who has his very definite uses, but is not to be taken as
an average type. You might as well take the stevedore whom you
see on the quay as being a representative Englishman."</p>

<p>"There's Luke" said Bolsover.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, he is, of course, very much higher. You heard him
and could judge. What else, Mr. Malone?"</p>

<p>"Well, the darkness! Everything done in darkness. Why should
all mediumship be associated with gloom?"</p>

<p>"You mean all physical mediumship. That is the only branch of
the subject which needs darkness. It is purely chemical, like the
darkness of the photographic room. It preserves the delicate
physical substance which, drawn from the human body, is the basis
of these phenomena. A cabinet is used for the purpose of
condensing this same vaporous substance and helping it to
solidify. Am I clear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but it is a pity all the same. It gives a horrible air
of deceit to the whole business."</p>

<p>"We get it now and again in the light, Mr. Malone," said
Bolsover. "I don't know if Wee One is gone yet. Wait a bit! Where
are the matches?" He lit the candle, which set them all blinking
after their long darkness, "Now let us see what we can do."</p>

<p>There was a round wood platter or circle of wood lying among
the miscellaneous objects littered over the table to serve as
playthings for the strange forces. Bolsover stared at it. They
all stared at it. They had risen but no one was within three feet
of it.</p>

<p>"Please, Wee One, please!" cried Mrs. Bolsover. Malone could
hardly believe his eyes. The disc began to move. It quivered and
then rattled upon the table, exactly as the lid of a boiling pot
might do.</p>

<p>"Up with it, Wee One!" They were all clapping their hands.</p>

<p>The circle of wood, in the full light of the candle, rose upon
edge and stood there shaking, as if trying to keep its
balance.</p>

<p>"Give three tilts, Wee One."</p>

<p>The disc inclined forward three times. Then it fell flat and
remained so.</p>

<p>"I am so glad you have seen that," said Mailey. "There is
Telekenesis in its simplest and most decisive form."</p>

<p>"I could not have believed it!" cried Enid.</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Malone. "I have extended my knowledge of what is
possible. Mr. Bolsover, you have enlarged my views."</p>

<p>"Good, Mr. Malone!"</p>

<p>"As to the power at the back of these things I am still
ignorant. As to the thing themselves I have now and henceforward
not the slightest doubt in the world. I know that they are true.
I wish you all good night. It is not likely that Miss Challenger
or I will ever forget the evening that we have spent under your
roof"</p>

<p>It was like another world when they came out into the frosty
air, and saw the taxis bearing back the pleasure-seekers from the
theatre or cinema palace. Mailey stood beside them while they
waited for a cab.</p>

<p>"I know exactly how you feel," he said, smiling. "You look at
all these bustling, complacent people, and you marvel to think
how little they know of the possibilities of life. Don't you want
to stop them? Don't you want to tell them? And yet they would
only think you a liar or a lunatic. Funny situation, is it
not?"</p>

<p>"I've lost all my bearings for the moment."</p>

<p>"They will come back to-morrow morning. It is curious how
fleeting these impressions are. You will persuade yourselves that
you have been dreaming. Well, good-bye&mdash;and let me know if I
can help your studies in the future." The friends&mdash;one could
hardly yet call them lovers&mdash; were absorbed in thought
during their drive home. When he reached Victoria Gardens Malone
escorted Enid to the door of the flat, but he did not go in with
her. Somehow the jeers of Challenger which usually rather woke
sympathy within him would now get upon his nerves. As it was he
heard his greeting in the hall.</p>

<p>"Well, Enid. Where's your spook? Spill him out of the bag on
the floor and let us have a look at him." His evening's adventure
ended as it had begun, with a bellow of laughter which pursued
him down the lift.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch05" id="ch05"></a>V. &mdash; WHERE OUR
COMMISSIONERS HAVE A REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE</h2>

<p class="first">MALONE sat at the side table of the smoking-room
of the Literary Club. He had Enid's impressions of the seance
before him&mdash;very subtle and observant they were&mdash;and he
was endeavouring to merge them in his own experience. A group of
men were smoking and chatting round the fire. This did not
disturb the journalist, who found, as many do, that his brain and
his pen worked best sometimes when they were stimulated by the
knowledge that he was part of a busy world. Presently, however,
somebody who observed his presence brought the talk round to
psychic subjects, and then it was more difficult for him to
remain aloof. He leaned back in his chair and listened.</p>

<p>Polter, the famous novelist, was there, a brilliant man with a
subtle mind, which he used too often to avoid obvious truth and
to defend some impossible position for the sake of the empty
dialectic exercise. He was holding forth now to an admiring, but
not entirely a subservient audience.</p>

<p>"Science," said he, "is gradually sweeping the world clear of
all these old cobwebs of superstition. The world was like some
old, dusty attic, and the sun of science is bursting in, flooding
it with light, while the dust settles gradually to the
floor."</p>

<p>"By science," said someone maliciously, "you mean, of course,
men like Sir William Crookes, Sir Oliver Lodge, Sir William
Barrett, Lombroso, Richet, and so forth."</p>

<p>Polter was not accustomed to be countered, and usually became
rude.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I mean nothing so preposterous," he answered, with a
glare. "No name, however eminent, can claim to stand for science
so long as he is a member of an insignificant minority of
scientific men."</p>

<p>"He is, then, a crank," said Pollifex, the artist, who usually
played jackal to Polter.</p>

<p>The objector, one Millworthy, a free-lance of journalism, was
not to be so easily silenced.</p>

<p>"Then Galileo was a crank in his day," said he. "And Harvey
was a crank when he was laughed at over the circulation of the
blood."</p>

<p>"It's the circulation of the <em>Daily Gazette</em> which is
at stake," said Marrible, the humorist of the club. "If they get
off their stunt I don't suppose they care a tinker's curse what
is truth or what is not."</p>

<p>"Why such things should be examined at all, except in a police
court, I can't imagine," said Polter. "It is a dispersal of
energy, a misdirection of human thought into channels which lead
nowhere. We have plenty of obvious, material things to examine.
Let us get on with our job."</p>

<p>Atkinson, the surgeon, was one of the circle, and had sat
silently listening. Now he spoke.</p>

<p>"I think the learned bodies should find more time for the
consideration of psychic matters."</p>

<p>"Less," said Polter.</p>

<p>"You can't have less than nothing. They ignore them
altogether. Some time ago I had a series of cases of telepathic
rapport which I wished to lay before the Royal Society. My
colleague Wilson, the zoologist, also had a paper which he
proposed to read. They went in together. His was accepted and
mine rejected. The title of his paper was 'The Reproductive
System of the Dung-Beetle'."</p>

<p>There was a general laugh.</p>

<p>"Quite right, too," said Polter. "The humble dung-beetle was
at least a fact. All this psychic stuff is not."</p>

<p>"No doubt you have good grounds for your views," chirped the
mischievous Millworthy, a mild youth with a velvety manner. "I
have little time for solid reading, so I should like to ask you
which of Dr. Crawford's three books you consider the best?"</p>

<p>"I never heard of the fellow."</p>

<p>Millworthy simulated intense surprise.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens, man! Why, he is the authority. If you want pure
laboratory experiments those are the books. You might as well lay
down the law about zoology and confess that you had never heard
of Darwin."</p>

<p>"This is not science," said Polter, emphatically.</p>

<p>"What is really not science," said Atkinson, with some heat,
"is the laying down of the law on matters which you have not
studied. It is talk of that sort which has brought me to the edge
of Spiritualism, when I compare this dogmatic ignorance with the
earnest search for truth conducted by the great Spiritualists.
Many of them took twenty years of work before they formed their
conclusions."</p>

<p>"But their conclusions are worthless because they are
upholding a formed opinion."</p>

<p>"But each of them fought a long fight before he formed that
opinion. I know a few of them, and there is not one who did not
take a lot of convincing." Polter shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Well, they can have their spooks if it makes them happier so
long as they let me keep my feet firm on the ground."</p>

<p>"Or stuck in the mud," said Atkinson.</p>

<p>"I would rather be in the mud with sane people thin in the air
with lunatics," said Polter. "I know some of these Spiritualists
people and I believe that you can divide them equally into fools
and rogues."</p>

<p>Malone had listened with interest and then with a growing
indignation. Now he suddenly took fire.</p>

<p>"Look here, Polter," he said, turning his chair towards the
company, "it is fools and dolts like you which are holding back
the world's progress. You admit that you have read nothing of
this, and I'll swear you have seen nothing. Yet you use the
position and the name which you have won in other matters in
order to discredit a number of people who, whatever they may be,
are certainly very earnest and very thoughtful."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Polter, "I had no idea you had got so far. You
don't dare to say so in your articles. You are a Spiritualist
then. That rather discounts your views, does it not?"</p>

<p>"I am not a Spiritualist, but I am an honest inquirer, and
that is more than you have ever been. You call them rogues and
fools, but, little as I know, I am sure that some of them are men
and women whose boots you are not worthy to clean."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, Malone!" cried one or two voices, but the insulted
Polter was on his feet. "It's men like you who empty this club,"
he cried, as he swept out. "I shall certainly never come here
again to be insulted."</p>

<p>"I say, you've done it, Malone!"</p>

<p>"I felt inclined to help him out with a kick. Why should he
ride roughshod over other people's feelings and beliefs? He has
got on and most of us haven't, so he thinks it's a condescension
to come among us."</p>

<p>"Dear old Irishman!" said Atkinson, patting his shoulder.
"Rest, perturbed spirit, rest! But I wanted to have a word with
you. Indeed, I was waiting here because I did not want to
interrupt you."</p>

<p>"I've had interruptions enough!" cried Malone. "How could I
work with that damned donkey braying in my ear?"</p>

<p>"Well, I've only a word to say. I've got a sitting with
Linden, the famous medium of whom I spoke to you, at the Psychic
College to-night. I have an extra ticket. Would you care to
come?"</p>

<p>"Come? I should think so!"</p>

<p>"I have another ticket. I should have asked Polter if he had
not been so offensive. Linden does not mind sceptics, but objects
to scoffers. Who should I ask?"</p>

<p>"Let Miss Enid Challenger come. We work together, you
know."</p>

<p>"Why, of course I will. Will you let her know?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"It's at seven o'clock to-night. The Psychic College. You know
the place down at Holland Park."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have the address. Very well, Miss Challenger and I
will certainly be there."</p>

<p>Behold the pair, then, upon a fresh psychic adventure. They
picked Atkinson up at Wimpole Street, and then traversed that
long, roaring rushing, driving belt of the great city which
extends through Oxford Street and Bayswater to Notting Hill and
the stately Victorian houses of Holland Park. It was at one of
these that the taxi drew up, a large, imposing building, standing
back a little from the road. A smart maid admitted them, and the
subdued light of the tinted hall-lamp fell upon shining linoleum
and polished woodwork with the gleam of white marble statuary in
the corner. Enid's female perceptions told her of a well-run,
well-appointed establishment, with a capable direction at the
head. This direction took the shape of a kindly Scottish lady who
met them in the hall and greeted Mr. Atkinson as an old friend.
She was, in turn, introduced to the journalists as Mrs. Ogilvy.
Malone had already heard how her husband and she had founded and
run this remarkable institute, which is the centre of psychic
experiment in London, at a very great cost, both in labour and in
money, to themselves.</p>

<p>"Linden and his wife have gone up," said Mrs. Ogilvy. "He
seems to think that the conditions are favourable. The rest are
in the drawing-room. Won't you join them for a few minutes?"</p>

<p>Quite a number of people had gathered for the seance, some of
them old psychic students who were mildly interested, others,
beginners who looked about them with rather startled eyes,
wondering what was going to happen next. A tall man was standing
near the door who turned and disclosed the tawny beard and open
face of Algernon Mailey. He shook hands with the newcomers.</p>

<p>"Another experience, Mr. Malone? Well, I thought you gave a
very fair account of the last. You are still a neophyte, but you
are well within the gates of the temple. Are you alarmed, Miss
Challenger?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I could be while you were around," she
answered.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"Of course, a materialization seance is a little different to
any other&mdash;more impressive, in a way. You'll find it very
instructive, Malone, as bearing upon psychic photography and
other matters. By the way, you should try for a psychic picture.
The famous Hope works upstairs."</p>

<p>"I always thought that that at least was fraud."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I should say it was the best established of
all phenomena, the one which leaves the most permanent proof.
I've been a dozen times under every possible test conditions. The
real trouble is, not that it lends itself to fraud, but that it
lends itself to exploitation by that villainous journalism which
cares only for a sensation. Do you know anyone here?"</p>

<p>"No, we don't."</p>

<p>"The tall, handsome lady is the Duchess of Rossland. Then,
there are Lord and Lady Montnoir, the middle-aged couple near the
fire. Real, good folk and among the very few of the aristocracy
who have shown earnestness and moral courage in this matter. The
talkative lady is Miss Badley, who lives for seances, a jaded
Society woman in search of new sensations&mdash;always visible,
always audible, and always empty. I don't know the two men. I
heard someone say they were researchers from the university. The
stout man with the lady in black is Sir James Smith&mdash;they
lost two boys in the war. The tall, dark person, is a weird man
named Barclay, who lives, I understand, in one room and seldom
comes out save for a seance."</p>

<p>"And the man with the horn glasses?"</p>

<p>"That is a pompous ass named Weatherby. He is one of those who
wander about on the obscure edges of Masonry, talking with
whispers and reverence of mysteries where no mystery is.
Spiritualism, with its very real and awful mysteries, is, to him,
a vulgar thing because it brought consolation to common folk, but
he loves to read papers on the Palladian Cultus, ancient and
accepted Scottish rites, and Baphometic figures. Eliphas Levi is
his prophet."</p>

<p>"It sounds very learned." said Enid.</p>

<p>"Or very absurd. But, hullo! Here are mutual friends." The two
Bolsovers had arrived, very hot and frowsy and genial. There is
no such leveller of classes as Spiritualism, and the charwoman
with psychic force is the superior of the millionaire who lacks
it. The Bolsovers and the aristocrats fraternized instantly. The
Duchess was just asking for admission to the grocer's circle,
when Mrs. Ogilvy bustled in.</p>

<p>"I think everyone is here now," she said. "It is time to go
upstairs."</p>

<p>The seance room was a large, comfortable chamber on the first
floor, with a circle of easy chairs, and a curtain-hung divan
which served as a cabinet. The medium and his wife were waiting
there. Mr. Linden was a gentle, large-featured man, stoutish in
build, deep-chested, clean-shaven, with dreamy, blue eyes and
flaxen, curly hair which rose in a pyramid at the apex of his
head. He was of middle age. His wife was rather younger, with the
sharp, querulous expression of the tired housekeeper, and quick,
critical eyes, which softened into something like adoration when
she looked at her husband. Her role was to explain matters, and
to guard his interests while he was unconscious.</p>

<p>"The sitters had better just take their own places," said the
medium. "If you can alternate the sexes it is as well. Don't
cross your knees, it breaks the current. If we have a
materialization, don't grab at it. If you do, you are liable to
injure me."</p>

<p>The two sleuths of the Research Society looked at each other
knowingly. Mailey observed it.</p>

<p>"Quite right," he said. "I have seen two cases of dangerous
haemorrhage in the medium brought on by that very cause."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Malone.</p>

<p>"Because the ectoplasm used is drawn from the medium. It
recoils upon him like a snapped elastic band. Where it comes
through the skin you get a bruise. Where it comes from mucous
membrane you get bleeding."</p>

<p>"And when it comes from nothing, you get nothing," said the
researcher with a grin.</p>

<p>"I will explain the procedure in a few words," said Mrs.
Ogilvy, when everyone was seated. "Mr. Linden does not enter the
cabinet at all. He sits outside it, and as he tolerates red light
you will be able to satisfy yourselves that he does not leave his
seat. Mrs. Linden sits on the other side. She is there to
regulate and explain. In the first place we would wish you to
examine the cabinet. One of you will also please lock the door on
the inside and be responsible for the key."</p>

<p>The cabinet proved to be a mere tent of hangings, detached
from the wall and standing on a solid platform. The researchers
ferreted about inside it and stamped on the boards. All seemed
solid.</p>

<p>"What is the use of it?" Malone whispered to Mailey.</p>

<p>"It serves as a reservoir and condensing place for the
ectoplasmic vapour from the medium, which would otherwise diffuse
over the room."</p>

<p>"It has been known to serve other purposes also," remarked one
of the researchers, who overheard the conversation.</p>

<p>"That's true enough," said Mailey philosophically. "I am all
in favour of caution and supervision."</p>

<p>"Well, it seems fraud-proof on this occasion, if the medium
sits outside." The two researchers were agreed on this.</p>

<p>The medium was seated on one side of the little tent, his wife
on the other. The light was out, and a small red lamp near the
ceiling was just sufficient to enable outlines to be clearly
seen. As the eyes became accustomed to it some detail could also
be observed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Linden will begin by some clairvoyant readings" said Mrs.
Linden. Her whole attitude, seated beside the cabinet with her
hands on her lap and the air of a proprietor, made Enid smile,
for she thought of Mrs. Jarley and her waxworks.</p>

<p>Linden, who was not in a trance, began to give clairvoyance.
It was not very good. Possibly the mixed influence of so many
sitters of various types at close quarters was too disturbing.
That was the excuse which he gave himself when several of his
descriptions were unrecognized. But Malone was more shocked by
those which were recognized, since it was so clear that the word
was put into the medium's mouth. It was the folly of the sitter
rather than the fault of the medium, but it was disconcerting all
the same.</p>

<p>"I see a young man with brown eyes and a rather drooping
moustache."</p>

<p>"Oh, darling, darling, have you then come back!" cried Miss
Badley. "Oh, has he a message?"</p>

<p>"He sends his love and does not forget."</p>

<p>"Oh, how evidential! It is so exactly what the dear boy would
have said! My first lover, you know," she added, in a simpering
voice to the company. "He never fails to come. Mr. Linden has
brought him again and again."</p>

<p>"There is a young fellow in khaki building up on the left. I
see a symbol over his head. It might be a Greek cross."</p>

<p>"Jim&mdash;it is surely Jim!" cried Lady Smith.</p>

<p>"Yes. He nods his head."</p>

<p>"And the Greek cross is probably a propeller," said Sir James.
"He was in the Air Service, you know." Malone and Enid were both
rather shocked. Mailey was also uneasy.</p>

<p>"This is not good," he whispered to Enid. "Wait a bit! You
will get something better."</p>

<p>There were several good recognitions, and then someone
resembling Summerlee was described for Malone. This was wisely
discounted by him, since Linden might have been in the audience
on the former occasion. Mrs. Debbs' exhibition seemed to him far
more convincing than that of Linden.</p>

<p>"Wait a bit!" Mailey repeated.</p>

<p>"The medium will now try for materializations," said Mrs.
Linden. "If the figures appear I would ask you not to touch them,
save by request. Victor will tell you if you may do so. Victor is
the medium's control."</p>

<p>The medium had settled down in his chair and he now began to
draw long, whistling breaths with deep intakes, puffing the air
out between his lips. Finally he steadied down and seemed to sink
into a deep coma, his chin upon his breast. Suddenly he spoke,
but it seemed that his voice was better modulated and more
cultivated than before.</p>

<p>"Good evening, all!" said the voice.</p>

<p>There was a general murmur of "Good evening, Victor."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that the vibrations are not very harmonious. The
sceptical element is present, but not, I think, predominant, so
that we may hope for results. Martin Lightfoot is doing what he
can."</p>

<p>"That is the Indian control" Mailey whispered.</p>

<p>"I think that if you would start the gramophone it would be
helpful. A hymn is always best, though there is no real objection
to secular music. Give us what you think best, Mrs. Ogilvy."</p>

<p>There was the rasping of a needle which had not yet found its
grooves. Then "Lead, Kindly Light" was churned out. The audience
joined in in a subdued fashion. Mrs. Ogilvy then changed it to
"O, God, our help in ages past".</p>

<p>"They often change the records themselves," said Mrs. Ogilvy,
"but to-night there is not enough power."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said the voice. "There is enough power, Mrs.
Ogilvy, but we are anxious to conserve it all for the
materializations. Martin says they are building up very
well."</p>

<p>At this moment the curtain in front of the cabinet began to
sway. It bellied out as if a strong wind were behind it. At the
same time a breeze was felt by all who were in the circle,
together with a sensation of cold.</p>

<p>"It is quite chilly," whispered Enid, with a shiver.</p>

<p>"It is not a subjective feeling," Mailey answered. "Mr. Harry
Price has tested it with thermometric readings. So did Professor
Crawford."</p>

<p>"My God!" cried a startled voice. It belonged to the pompous
dabbler in mysteries, who was suddenly faced with a real mystery.
The curtains of the cabinet had parted and a human figure had
stolen noiselessly out. There was the medium clearly outlined on
one side. There was Mrs. Linden, who had sprung to her feet, on
the other. And, between them, the little black, hesitating
figure, which seemed to be terrified at its own position. Mrs.
Linden soothed and encouraged it.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, dear. It is all quite right. No one will
hurt you."</p>

<p>"It is someone who has never been through before," she
explained to the company. "Naturally it seems very strange to
her. Just as strange as if we broke into their world. That's
right, dear. You are gaining strength, I can see. Well done!"</p>

<p>The figure was moving forward. Everyone sat spellbound, with
staring eyes. Miss Badley began to giggle hysterically. Weatherby
lay back in his chair, gasping with horror. Neither Malone nor
Enid felt any fear, but were consumed with curiosity. How
marvellous to hear the humdrum flow of life in the street outside
and to be face to face with such a sight as that.</p>

<p>Slowly the figure moved round. Now it was close to Enid and
between her and the red light. Stooping, she could get the
silhouette sharply outlined. It was that of a little, elderly
woman, with sharp, clear-cut features.</p>

<p>"It's Susan!" cried Mrs. Bolsover. "Oh, Susan, don't you know
me?"</p>

<p>The figure turned and nodded her head.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, dear, it is your sister Susie," cried her husband.
"I never saw her in anything but black. Susan, speak to us!"</p>

<p>The head was shaken.</p>

<p>"They seldom speak the first time they come," said Mrs.
Linden, whose rather blase, business-like air was in contrast to
the intense emotion of the company. "I'm afraid she can't hold
together long. Ah, there! She has gone!"</p>

<p>The figure had disappeared. There had been some backward
movement towards the cabinet, but it seemed to the observers that
she sank into the ground before she reached it. At any rate, she
was gone.</p>

<p>"Gramophone, please!" said Mrs. Linden. Everyone relaxed and
sat back with a sigh. The gramophone struck up a lively air.
Suddenly the curtains parted, and a second figure appeared.</p>

<p>It was a young girl, with flowing hair down her back. She came
forward swiftly and with perfect assurance to the centre of the
circle.</p>

<p>Mrs. Linden laughed in a satisfied way.</p>

<p>"Now you will get something good," she said. "Here is
Lucille."</p>

<p>"Good evening, Lucille!" cried the Duchess. "I met you last
month, you will remember, when your medium came to Maltraver
Towers."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, lady, I remember you. You have a little boy, Tommy,
on our side of life. No, no, not dead, lady! We are far more
alive than you are. All the fun and frolic are with us!" She
spoke in a high clear voice and perfect English.</p>

<p>"Shall I show you what we do over here?" She began a graceful,
gliding dance, while she whistled as melodiously as a bird. "Poor
Susan could not do that. Susan has had no practice. Lucille knows
how to use a built-up body."</p>

<p>"Do you remember me, Lucille?" asked Mailey.</p>

<p>"I remember you, Mr. Mailey. Big man with yellow beard."</p>

<p>For the second time in her life Enid had to pinch herself hard
to satisfy herself that she was not dreaming. Was this graceful
creature, who had now sat down in the centre of the circle, a
real materialization of ectoplasm, used for the moment as a
machine for expression by a soul that had passed, or was it an
illusion of the senses, or was it a fraud? There were the three
possibilities. An illusion was absurd when all had the same
impression. Was it a fraud? But this was certainly not the little
old woman. She was inches taller and fair, not dark. And the
cabinet was fraud-proof. It had been meticulously examined. Then
it was true. But if it were true, what a vista of possibilities
opened out. Was it not far the greatest matter which could claim
the attention of the world!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lucille had been so natural and the situation was
so normal that even the most nervous had relaxed. The girl
answered most cheerfully to every question, and they rained upon
her from every side.</p>

<p>"Where did you live, Lucille?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I had better answer that," interposed Mrs. Linden.
"It will save the power. Lucille was bred in South Dakota in the
United States, and passed over at the age of fourteen. We have
verified some of her statements."</p>

<p>"Are you glad you died, Lucille?"</p>

<p>"Glad for my own sake. Sorry for mother."</p>

<p>"Has your mother seen you since?"</p>

<p>"Poor mother is a shut box. Lucille cannot open the lid."</p>

<p>"Are you happy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, so gloriously happy."</p>

<p>"Is it right that you can come back?"</p>

<p>"Would God allow it if it were not right? What a wicked man
you must be to ask!"</p>

<p>"What religion were you?"</p>

<p>"We were Roman Catholics."</p>

<p>"Is that the right religion?"</p>

<p>"All religions are right if they make you better."</p>

<p>"Then it does not matter."</p>

<p>"It is what people do in daily life, not what they
believe."</p>

<p>"Tell us more, Lucille."</p>

<p>"Lucille has little time. There are others who wish to come.
If Lucille uses too much power, the others have less. Oh, God is
very good and kind! You poor people on earth do not know how good
and kind He is because it is grey down there. But it is grey for
your own good. It is to give you your chance to earn all the
lovely things which wait for you. But you can only tell how
wonderful He is when you get over here."</p>

<p>"Have you seen him?"</p>

<p>"Seen Him! How could you see God? No, no, He is all round us
and in us and in everything, but we do not see Him. But I have
seen the Christ. Oh, He was glorious, glorious! Now, good-bye
&mdash;good-bye!" She backed towards the cabinet and sank into
the shadows.</p>

<p>Now came a tremendous experience for Malone. A small, dark,
rather broad figure of a woman appeared slowly from the cabinet.
Mrs. Linden encouraged her, and then came across to the
journalist.</p>

<p>"It is for you. You can break the circle. Come up to her."</p>

<p>Malone advanced and peered, awestruck, into the face of the
apparition. There was not a foot between them. Surely that large
head, that solid, square outline was familiar! He put his face
still nearer&mdash;it was almost touching. He strained his eyes.
It seemed to him that the features were semi-fluid, moulding
themselves into a shape, as if some unseen hand was modelling
them in putty. "Mother!" he cried. "Mother!"</p>

<br>

<a id="pic1"></a>

<div align="center"> <img src="0601351h-images/TLOM-A.jpg"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> <p
class="caption">Malone advanced and peered, awestruck, into the
face of the apparition.</p> </div> <br>

<p>Instantly the figure threw up both her hands in a wild gesture
of joy. The motion seemed to destroy her equilibrium and she
vanished.</p>

<p>"She had not been through before. She could not speak," said
Mrs. Linden, in her business-like way. "It was your mother."</p>

<p>Malone went back half-stunned to his seat. It is only when
these things come to one's own address that one understands their
full force. His mother! Ten years in her grave and yet standing
before him. Could he swear it was his mother? No, he could not.
Was he morally certain that it was his mother? Yes, he was
morally certain. He was shaken to the core.</p>

<p>But other wonders diverted his thoughts. A young man had
emerged briskly from the cabinet and had advanced to the front of
Mailey, where he had halted.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Jock! Dear old Jock!" said Mailey. "My nephew," he
explained to the company. "He always comes when I am with
Linden."</p>

<p>"The power is sinking," said the lad, in a clear voice. "I
can't stay very long. I am so glad to see you, Uncle. You know,
we can see quite clearly in this light, even if you can't."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you can. I say, Jock. I wanted to tell you that I
told your mother I had seen you. She said her Church taught her
it was wrong."</p>

<p>"I know. And that I was a demon. Oh, it is rotten, rotten,
rotten, and rotten things will fall!" His voice broke in a
sob.</p>

<p>"Don't blame her Jock, she believes this."</p>

<p>"No, no, I don't blame her! She will know better some day. The
day is coming soon when all truth will be manifest and all these
corrupt Churches will be swept off the earth with their cruel
doctrines and their caricatures of God."</p>

<p>"Why, Jock, you are becoming quite a heretic!"</p>

<p>"Love, Uncle! Love! That is all that counts. What matter what
you believe if you are sweet and kind and unselfish as the Christ
was of old?"</p>

<p>"Have you seen Christ?" asked someone.</p>

<p>"Not yet. Perhaps the time may come."</p>

<p>"Is he not in Heaven, then?"</p>

<p>"There are many heavens. I am in a very humble one. But it is
glorious all the same."</p>

<p>Enid had thrust her head forward during this dialogue. Her
eyes had got used to the light and she could see more clearly
than before. The man who stood within a few feet of her was not
human. Of that she had no doubt whatever, and yet the points were
very subtle. Something in his strange, yellow-white colouring as
contrasted with the faces of her neighbours. Something, also, in
the curious stiffness of his carriage, as of a man in very rigid
stays.</p>

<p>"Now, Jock," said Mailey, "give an address to the company.
Tell them a few words about your life."</p>

<p>The figure hung his head, exactly as a shy youth would do in
life.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle, I can't."</p>

<p>"Come, Jock, we love to listen to you."</p>

<p>"Teach the folk what death is," the figure began. "God wants
them to know. That is why He lets us come back. It is nothing.
You are no more changed than if you went into the next room. You
can't believe you are dead. I didn't. It was only when I saw old
Sam that I knew, for I was certain that he was dead, anyhow. Then
I came back to mother. And"&mdash;his voice broke&mdash;"she
would not receive me."</p>

<p>"Never mind, dear old Jock," said Mailey. "She will learn
wisdom."</p>

<p>"Teach them the truth! Teach it to them! Oh, it u so much more
important than all the things men talk about. If papers for one
week gave as much attention to psychic things as they do to
football, it would be known to all. It is ignorance which
stands&mdash;"</p>

<p>The observers were conscious of a sort of flash towards the
cabinet, but the youth had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Power run down," said Mailey. "Poor lad, he held on to the
last. He always did. That was how he died."</p>

<p>There was a long pause. The gramophone started again. Then
there was a movement of the curtains. Something was emerging.
Mrs. Linden sprang up and waved the figure back. The medium for
the first time stirred in his chair and groaned.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Mrs. Linden?"</p>

<p>"Only half-formed," she answered. "The lower face had not
materialized. Some of you would have been alarmed. I think that
we shall have no more to-night The power has sunk very low."</p>

<p>So it proved. The lights were gradually turned on. The medium
lay with a white face and a clammy brow in his chair, while his
wife sedulously watched over him, unbuttoning his collar and
bathing his face from a water-glass. The company broke into
little groups, discussing what they had seen.</p>

<p>"Oh, wasn't it thrilling?" cried Miss Badley. "It really was
most exciting. But what a pity we could not see the one with the
semi-materialized face."</p>

<p>"Thanks, I have seen quite enough," said the pompous mystic,
all the pomposity shaken out of him. "I confess that it has been
rather too much for my nerves."</p>

<p>Mr. Atkinson found himself near the psychic researchers.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you make of it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I have seen it better done at Maskelyne's Hall," said
one.</p>

<p>"Oh, come, Scott!" said the other. "You've no right to say
that. You admitted that the cabinet was fraud-proof."</p>

<p>"Well, so do the committees who go on the stage at
Maskelyne's."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it is Maskelyne's own stage. This is not Linden's
own stage. He has no machinery."</p>

<p><em>"Populus vult decepi,"</em> the other answered, shrugging
his shoulders. "I should certainly reserve judgment." He moved
away with the dignity of one who cannot be deceived, while his
more rational companion still argued with him as they went.</p>

<p>"Did you hear that?" said Atkinson. "There is a certain class
of psychic researcher who is absolutely incapable of receiving
evidence. They misuse their brains by straining them to find a
way round when the road is quite clear before them. When the
human race advances into its new kingdom, these intellectual men
will form the absolute rear."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Mailey, laughing. "The bishops are predestined
to be the rearguard. I see them all marching in step, a solid
body, with their gaiters and cassocks&mdash;the last in the whole
world to reach spiritual truth."</p>

<p>"Oh, come," said Enid, "that is too severe. They are all good
men."</p>

<p>"Of course they are. It's quite physiological. They are a body
of elderly men, and the elderly brain is sclerosed and cannot
record new impressions. It's not their fault, but the fact
remains. You are very silent, Malone." But Malone was thinking of
a little, squat, dark figure which waved its hands in joy when he
spoke to it. It was with that image in his mind that he turned
from this room of wonders and passed down into the street.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch06" id="ch06"></a>VI. &mdash; IN WHICH THE READER
IS SHOWN THE HABITS OF A NOTORIOUS CRIMINAL</h2>

<p class="first">WE will now leave that little group with whom we
have made our first exploration of these grey and ill-defined,
but immensely important, regions of human thought and
experiences. From the researchers we will turn to the researched.
Come with me and we will visit Mr. Linden at home, and will
examine the lights and shades which make up the life of a
professional medium.</p>

<p>To reach him we will pass down the crowded thoroughfare of
Tottenham Court Road, where the huge furniture emporia flank the
way, and we will turn into a small street of drab houses which
leads eastwards towards the British Museum. Tullis Street is the
name and 40 the number. Here it is, one of a row, flat-faced,
dull-coloured and commonplace, with railed steps leading up to a
discoloured door, and one front-room window, in which a huge
gilt-edged Bible upon a small round table reassures the timid
visitor. With the universal pass-key of imagination we open the
dingy door, pass down a dark passage and up a narrow stair. It is
nearly ten o'clock in the morning and yet it is in his bedroom
that we must seek the famous worker of miracles. The fact us that
he has had, as we have seen, an exhausting sitting the night
before, and that he has to conserve his strength in the
mornings.</p>

<p>At the moment of our inopportune, but invisible, visit he was
sitting up, propped by the pillows, with a breakfast-tray upon
his knees. The vision he presented would have amused those who
have prayed with him in the bumble Spiritualist temples, or had
sat with awe at the seances where he had exhibited the modern
equivalents of the gifts of the Spirit. He looked unhealthily
pallid in the dim morning light, and his curly hair rose up in a
tangled pyramid above his broad, intellectual brow. The open
collar of his nightshirt displayed a broad, bull's neck, and the
depth of his chest and spread of his shoulders showed that he was
a man of considerable personal strength. He was eating his
breakfast with avidity while he conversed with the little, eager,
dark-eyed wife who was seated on the side of the bed.</p>

<p>"And you reckon it a good meeting, Mary?"</p>

<p>"Fair to middling, Tom. There was two of them researchers
raking round with their feet and upsetting everybody. D'ye think
those folk in the Bible would have got their phenomena if they
had chaps of that sort on the premises? 'Of one accord', that's
what they say in the book."</p>

<p>"Of course!" cried Linden heartily. "Was the Duchess
pleased?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think she was very pleased. So was Mr. Atkinson, the
surgeon. There was a new man there called Malone of the Press.
Then Lord and Lady Montnoir got evidence, and so did Sir James
Smith and Mr. Mailey."</p>

<p>"I wasn't satisfied with the clairvoyance," said the medium.
"The silly idiots kept on putting things into my mind. 'That's
surely my Uncle Sam', and so forth. It blurs me so that I can see
nothing clear."</p>

<p>"Yes, and they think they are helping! Helping to muddle you
and deceive themselves. I know the kind."</p>

<p>"But I went under nicely and I am glad there were some fine
materializations. It took it out of me, though. I'm a rag this
morning."</p>

<p>"They work you too hard, dear. I'll take you to Margate and
build you up."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe at Easter we could do a week. It would be fine. I
don't mind readings and clairvoyance, but the physicals do try
you. I'm not as bad as Hallows. They say he just lies white and
gasping on the floor after them."</p>

<p>"Yes," cried the woman bitterly. "And then they run to him
with whisky, and so they teach him to rely on the bottle and you
get another case of a drunken medium. I know them. You keep off
it, Tom!"</p>

<p>"Yes, one of our trade should stick to soft drinks. If he can
stick to vegetables, too, he's all the better, but I can't preach
that while I am wolfin' up ham and eggs. By Gosh, Mary! it's past
ten and I have a string of them comin' this morning. I'm going to
make a bit to-day."</p>

<p>"You give it away as quick as you make it, Tom."</p>

<p>"Well, some hard cases come my way. So long as we can make
both ends meet what more do we want? I expect they will look
after us all right."</p>

<p>"They have let down a lot of other poor mediums who did good
work in their day."</p>

<p>"It's the rich folk that are to blame not the Spirit-people,"
said Tom Linden hotly. "It makes me see red when I remember these
folk, Lady This and Countess That, declaring all the comfort they
have had, and then leaving those who gave it to die in the gutter
or rot in the workhouse. Poor old Tweedy and Soames and the rest
all living on old-age pensions and the papers talking of the
money that mediums make, while some damned conjuror makes more
than all of us put together by a rotten imitation with two tons
of machinery to help him."</p>

<p>"Don't worry, dear," cried the medium's wife, putting her thin
hand caressingly upon the tangled mane of her man. "It all comes
level in time and everybody pays the price for what they have
done."</p>

<p>Linden laughed loudly. "It's my Welsh half that comes out when
I flare up. Let the conjurors take their dirty money and let the
rich folk keep their purses shut. I wonder what they think money
is for. Paying death duties is about the only fun some of them
seem to get out of it. If I had their money..."</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door.</p>

<p>"Please, sir, your brother Silas is below." The two looked at
each other with some dismay.</p>

<p>"More trouble," said Mrs. Linden sadly.</p>

<p>Linden shrugged his shoulders. "All right, Susan!" he cried.
"Tell him I'll be down. Now, dear, you keep him going and I'll be
with you in a quarter of an hour."</p>

<p>In less time than he named he was down in the front room
&mdash;his consulting room&mdash;where his wife was evidently
having some difficulty in making agreeable conversation with
their visitor. He was a big, heavy man, not unlike his elder
brother, but with all the genial chubbiness of the medium
coarsened into pure brutality. He had the same pile of curly
hair, but he was clean-shaven with a heavy, obstinate jowl. He
sat by the window with his huge freckled hands upon his knees. A
very important part of Mr. Silas Linden lay in those hands, for
he had been a professional boxer, and at one time was fancied for
the welter-weight honours of England. Now, as his stained tweed
suit and frayed boots made clear, he had fallen on evil days,
which he endeavoured to mitigate by cadging on his brother.</p>

<p>"Mornin', Tom," he said in a husky voice. Then as the wife
left the room: "Got a drop of Scotch about? I've a head on me
this morning. I met some of the old set last night down at 'The
Admiral Vernon'. Quite a reunion it was&mdash;chaps I hadn't seen
since my best ring days."</p>

<p>"Sorry, Silas," said the medium, seating himself behind his
desk. "I keep nothing in the house."</p>

<p>"Spirits enough, but not the right sort," said Silas.</p>

<p>"Well, the price of a drink will do as well. If you've got a
Bradbury about you I could do with it, for there's nothing coming
my way."</p>

<p>Torn Linden took a pound note from his desk.</p>

<p>"Here you are, Silas. So long as I have any you have your
share. But you had two pounds last week. Is it gone?"</p>

<p>"Gone! I should say so!" He put the note in his pocket. "Now,
look here, Tom, I want to speak to you very serious as between
man and man."</p>

<p>"Yes, Silas, what is it?"</p>

<p>"You see that!" He pointed to a lump on the back of his hand.
"That's a bone! See? It will never be right. It was when I hit
Curly Jenkins third round and outed him at the N.S.C. I outed
myself for life that night. I can put up a show fight and
exhibition bout, but I'm done for the real thing. My right has
gone west."</p>

<p>"It's a hard case, Silas."</p>

<p>"Damned hard! But that's neither here nor there. What matters
is that I've got to pick up a living and I want to know how to do
it. An old scrapper don't find many openings. Chucker-out at a
pub with free drinks. Nothing doing there. What I want to know'
Tom, is what's the matter with my becoming a medium?"</p>

<p>"A medium?"</p>

<p>"Why the devil should you stare at me! If it's good enough for
you it's good enough for me."</p>

<p>"But you are not a medium."</p>

<p>"Oh, come! Keep that for the newspapers. It's all in the
family, and between you an' me, how d'ye do it?"</p>

<p>"I don't do it. I do nothing."</p>

<p>"And get four or five quid a week for it. That's a good yarn.
Now you can't fool me. Tom, I'm not one o' those duds that pay
you a thick 'un for an hour in the dark. We're on the square, you
an' me. How d'ye do it?"</p>

<p>"Do what?"</p>

<p>"Well, them raps, for example. I've seen you sit there at your
desk, as it might be, and raps come answerin' questions over
yonder on the bookshelf. It's damned clever&mdash;fair puzzles
'em every time. How d'ye get them?"</p>

<p>"I tell you I don't. It's outside myself."</p>

<p>"Rats! You can tell me, Tom. I'm Griffiths, the safe man. It
would set me up for life if I could do it."</p>

<p>For the second time in one morning the medium's Welsh strain
took control.</p>

<p>"You're an impudent, blasphemous rascal, Silas Linden. It's
men like you who come into our movement and give it a bad name.
You should know me better than to think that I am a cheat. Get
out of my house, you ungrateful rascal!"</p>

<p>"Not too much of your lip," growled the ruffian.</p>

<p>"Out you go, or I'll put you out, brother or no brother."
Silas doubled his great fists and looked ugly for a moment. Then
the anticipation of favours to come softened his mood.</p>

<p>"Well, well, no harm meant," he growled, as he made for the
door. "I expect I can make a shot at it without your help." His
grievance suddenly overcame his prudence as he stood in the
doorway. "You damned, canting, hypocritical box-of-tricks. I'll
be even with you yet."</p>

<p>The heavy door slammed behind him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Linden had rushed in to her husband.</p>

<p>"The hulking blackguard!" she cried. "I 'eard 'im. What did 'e
want?"</p>

<p>"Wanted me to put him wise to mediumship. Thinks it's a trick
of some sort that I could teach him."</p>

<p>"The foolish lump! Well, it's a good thing, for he won't dare
show his face here again."</p>

<p>"Oh, won't he?"</p>

<p>"If he does I'll slap it for him. To think of his upsettin'
you like this. Why, you're shakin' all over!"</p>

<p>"I suppose I wouldn't be a medium if I wasn't high strung.
Someone said we were poets, only more so. But it's bad just when
work is beginning."</p>

<p>"I'll give you healing."</p>

<p>She put her little work-worn hands over his high forehead and
held them there in silence.</p>

<p>"That's better!" said he. "Well done, Mary. I'll have a
cigarette in the kitchen. That will finish it."</p>

<p>"No, there's someone here." She had looked out of the window.
"Are you fit to see her? It's a woman."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. I am all right now. Show her in."</p>

<p>An instant later a woman entered, a pale, tragic figure in
black, whose appearance told its own tale. Linden motioned her to
a chair away from the light. Then he looked through his
papers.</p>

<p>"You are Mrs. Blount, are you not? You had an
appointment?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I wanted to ask&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please ask me nothing. It confuses me."</p>

<p>He was looking at her with the medium's gaze in his light grey
eyes&mdash;that gaze which looks round and through a thing rather
than at it.</p>

<p>"You have been wise to come, very wise. There is someone
beside you who has an urgent message which could not be delayed.
I get a name...Francis&mdash;yes, Francis." The woman clasped her
hands.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, it is the name."</p>

<p>"A dark man, very sad, very earnest&mdash;oh, so earnest. He
will speak. He must speak! It is urgent. He says, 'Tink-a-bell'.
Who is Tink-a-bell?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, he called me so. Oh, Frank, Frank, speak to me!
Speak!"</p>

<p>"He is speaking. His hand is on your head. 'Tink-a-bell', he
says, 'If you do what you purpose doing it will make a gap that
it will take many years to cross'. Does that mean anything?"</p>

<p>She sprang from her chair. "It means everything. Oh, Mr.
Linden, this was my last chance. If this had failed&mdash;if I
found that I had really lost him I meant to go and seek him. I
would have taken poison this night."</p>

<p>"Thank God that I have saved you. It is a terrible thing,
madame, to take one's life. It breaks the law of Nature, and
Nature's laws cannot be broken without punishment. I rejoice that
he has been able to save you. He has more to say to you. His
message is, 'If you will live and do your duty I will for ever be
by your side, far closer to you than ever I was in life. My
presence will surround you and guard both you and our three
babes.'"</p>

<p>It was marvellous the change! The pale, worn woman who had
entered the room was now standing with flushed cheeks and smiling
lips. It is true that tears were pouring down her face' but they
were tears of joy. She clapped her hands. She made little
convulsive movements as if she would dance.</p>

<p>"He's not dead! He's not dead! How can he be dead if he can
speak to me and be closer to me than ever? Oh, it's glorious! Oh,
Mr. Linden, what can I do for you? You have saved me from
shameful death! You have restored my husband to me! Oh, what a
God-like power you have!"</p>

<p>The medium was an emotional man and his own tears were moist
upon his cheeks.</p>

<p>"My dear lady, say no more. It is not I. I do nothing. You can
thank God Who in His mercy permits some of His mortals to discern
a spirit or to carry a message. Well, well, a guinea is my fee,
if you can afford it. Come back to me if ever you are in
trouble."</p>

<p>"I am content now," she cried, drying her eyes, "to await
God's will and to do my duty in the world until such time as it
shall be ordained that we unite once more."</p>

<p>The widow left the house walking on air. Tom Linden also felt
that the clouds left by his brother's visit had been blown away
by this joyful incident, for there is no happiness like giving
happiness and seeing the beneficient workings of one's own power.
He had hardly settled down in his chair, however, before another
client was ushered in. This time it was a smartly-dressed, white-
spatted, frock-coated man of the world, with a bustling air as of
one to whom minutes are precious.</p>

<p>"Mr. Linden, I believe? I have heard, sir, of your powers. I
am told that by handling an object you can often get some clue as
to the person who owned it?"</p>

<p>"It happens sometimes. I cannot command it."</p>

<p>"I should like to test you. I have a letter here which I
received this morning. Would you try your powers upon that?"</p>

<p>The medium took the folded letter, and, leaning back in his
chair, he pressed it upon his forehead. He sat with his eyes
closed for a minute or more. Then he returned the paper.</p>

<p>"I don't like it" he said. "I get a feeling of evil. I see a
man dressed all in white. He has a dark face. He writes at a
bamboo table. I get a sensation of heat. The letter is from the
tropics."</p>

<p>"Yes, from Central America."</p>

<p>"I can tell you no more."</p>

<p>"Are the spirits so limited? I thought they knew
everything."</p>

<p>"They do not know everything. Their power and knowledge are as
closely limited as ours. But this is not a matter for the spirit
people. What I did then was psychometry, which, so far as we
know, is a power of the human soul."</p>

<p>"Well, you are right as far as you have gone. This man, my
correspondent, wants me to put up the money for the half-share in
an oil boring. Shall I do it?"</p>

<p>Tom Linden shook his head.</p>

<p>"These powers are given to some of us, sir, for the
consolation of humanity and for a proof of immortality. They were
never meant for worldly use. Trouble always comes of such use,
trouble to the medium and trouble to the client. I will not go
into the matter."</p>

<p>"Money's no object," said the man, drawing a wallet from his
inner pocket.</p>

<p>"No, sir, nor to me. I am poor, but I have never ill-used my
gift."</p>

<p>"A fat lot of use the gift is, then!" said the visitor, rising
from his chair. "I can get all the rest from the parsons who are
licensed, and you are not. There is your guinea, but I have not
had the worth of it."</p>

<p>"I am sorry, sir, but I cannot break a rule. There is a lady
beside you&mdash;near your left shoulder&mdash;an elderly
lady..."</p>

<p>"Tut! tut!" said the financier, turning towards the door.</p>

<p>"She wears a large gold locket with an emerald cross upon her
breast."</p>

<p>The man stopped, turned and stared.</p>

<p>"Where did you pick that up?"</p>

<p>"I see it before me, now."</p>

<p>"Why, dash it, man, that is what my mother always wore! D'you
tell me you can see her?"</p>

<p>"No, she is gone."</p>

<p>"What was she like? What was she doing?"</p>

<p>"She was your mother. She said so. She was weeping."</p>

<p>"Weeping! My mother! Why, she is in heaven if ever a woman
was. They don't weep in heaven!"</p>

<p>"Not in the imaginary heaven. They do in the real heaven. It
is only we who ever make them weep. She left a message."</p>

<p>"Give it to me!"</p>

<p>"The message was: 'Oh, Jack! Jack! you are drifting ever
further from my reach'"</p>

<p>The man made a contemptuous gesture.</p>

<p>"I was a damned fool to let you have my name when I made the
appointment. You have been making inquiries. You don't take me in
with your tricks. I've had enough of it&mdash;more than
enough!"</p>

<p>For the second time that morning the door was slammed by an
angry visitor.</p>

<p>"He didn't like his message." Linden explained to his wife.
"It was his poor mother. She is fretting over him. Lord! If folk
only knew these things it would do them more good than all the
forms and ceremonies."</p>

<p>"Well, Tom, it's not your fault if they don't," his wife
answered. "There are two women waiting to see you. They have not
an introduction but they seem in great trouble."</p>

<p>"I've a bit of a headache. I haven't got over last night.
Silas and I are the same in that. Our night's work finds us out
next morning. I'll just take these and no more, for it is bad to
send anyone sorrowin' away if one can help it."</p>

<p>The two women were shown in, both of them austere figures
dressed in black, one a stern-looking person of fifty, the other
about half that age.</p>

<p>"I believe your fee is a guinea," said the elder, putting that
sum upon the table.</p>

<p>"To those who can afford it," Linden answered. As a matter of
fact, the guinea often went the other way.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I can afford it," said the woman. "I am in sad
trouble and they told me maybe you could help me."</p>

<p>"Well, I will if I can. That's what I am for."</p>

<p>"I lost my poor husband in the war&mdash;killed at Ypres he
was. Could I get in touch with him?"</p>

<p>"You don't seem to bring any influence with you. I get no
impression. I am sorry but we can't command these things. I get
the name Edmund. Was that his name?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Or Albert?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I am sorry, but it seems confused&mdash;cross vibrations,
perhaps, and a mix-up of messages like crossed telegraph
wires."</p>

<p>"Does the name Pedro help you?"</p>

<p>"Pedro! Pedro! No, I get nothing. Was Pedro an elderly
man?"</p>

<p>"No, not elderly."</p>

<p>"I can get no impression."</p>

<p>"It was about this girl of mine that I really wanted advice.
My husband would have told me what to do. She has got engaged to
a young man, a fitter by trade, but there are one or two things
against it and I want to know what to do."</p>

<p>"Do give us some advice," said the young woman, looking at the
medium with a hard eye.</p>

<p>"I would if I could, my dear. Do you love this man?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, he's all right."</p>

<p>"Well, if you don't feel more than that about him, I should
leave him alone. Nothing but unhappiness comes of such a
marriage."</p>

<p>"Then you see unhappiness waiting for her?"</p>

<p>"I see a good chance of it. I think she should be
careful."</p>

<p>"Do you see anyone else coming along?"</p>

<p>"Everyone, man or woman, meets their mate sometime
somewhere."</p>

<p>"Then she will get a mate?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly she will."</p>

<p>"I wonder if I should have any family?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Nay, that's more than I can say."</p>

<p>"And money&mdash;will she have money? We are down hearted, Mr.
Linden, and we want a little."</p>

<p>At this moment there came a most surprising interruption. The
door flew open and little Mrs. Linden rushed into the room with
pale face and blazing eyes.</p>

<p>"They are policewomen, Tom. I've had a warning about them.
It's only just come. Get out of this house, you pair of
snivelling hypocrites. Oh, what a fool! What a fool I was not to
recognize what you were." The two women had risen.</p>

<p>"Yes, you are rather late, Mrs. Linden," said the senior. "The
money has passed."</p>

<p>"Take it back! Take it back! It's on the table."</p>

<p>"No, no, the money has passed. We have had our fortune told.
You will hear more of this, Mr. Linden."</p>

<p>"You brace of frauds! You talk of frauds when it is you who
are the frauds all the time! He would not have seen you if it had
not been for compassion."</p>

<p>"It is no use scolding us," the woman answered. "We do our
duty and we did not make the law. So long as it is on the Statute
Book we have to enforce it. We must report the case at
headquarters."</p>

<p>Tom Linden seemed stunned by the blow, but, when the
policewomen had disappeared, he put his arm round his weeping
wife and consoled her as best he might.</p>

<p>"The typist at the police office sent down the warning," she
said. "Oh, Tom, it is the second time!" she cried. "It means gaol
and hard labour for you."</p>

<p>"Well, dear, so long as we are conscious of having done no
wrong and of having done God's work to the best of our power, we
must take what comes with a good heart."</p>

<p>"But where were they? How could they let you down so? Where
was your guide?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Victor," said Tom Linden, shaking his head at the air
above him, "where were you? I've got a crow to pick with you. You
know, dear," he added, "just as a doctor can never treat his own
case, a medium is very helpless when things come to his own
address. That's the law. And yet I should have known. I was
feeling in the dark. I had no inspiration of any sort. It was
just a foolish pity and sympathy that led me on when I had no
sort of a real message. Well, dear Mary, we will take what's
coming to us with a brave heart. Maybe they have not enough to
make a case, and maybe the beak is not as ignorant as most of
them. We'll hope for the best."</p>

<p>In spite of his brave words the medium was shaking and
quivering at the shock. His wife had put her hands upon him and
was endeavouring to steady him, when Susan, the maid, who knew
nothing of the trouble, admitted a fresh visitor into the room.
It was none other than Edward Malone.</p>

<p>"He can't see you," said Mrs. Linden, "the medium is ill. He
will see no one this morning."</p>

<p>But Linden had recognized his visitor.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Malone, my dear, of the <em>Daily Gazette</em>.
He was with us last night. We had a good sitting, had we not,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Marvellous!" said Malone. "But what is amiss?"</p>

<p>Both husband and wife poured out their sorrows.</p>

<p>"What a dirty business!" cried Malone, with disgust.</p>

<p>"I am sure the public does not realize how this law is
enforced, or there would be a row. This agent-provocateur
business is quite foreign to British justice. But in any case,
Linden, you are a real medium. The law was made to suppress false
ones."</p>

<p>"There are no real mediums in British law," said Linden,
ruefully. "I expect the more real you are the greater the
offence. If you are a medium at all and take money you are
liable. But how can a medium live if he does not take money? It's
a man's whole work and needs all his strength. You can't be a
carpenter all day and a first-class medium in the evening."</p>

<p>"What a wicked law! It seems to be deliberately stifling all
physical proofs of spiritual power."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is just what it is. If the Devil passed a law it
would be just that. It is supposed to be for the protection of
the public and yet no member of the public has ever been known to
complain. Every case is a police trap. And yet the police know as
well as you or I that every Church charity garden-party has got
its clairvoyante or its fortune-teller."</p>

<p>"It does seem monstrous. What will happen now?"</p>

<p>"Well, I expect a summons will come along. Then a police court
case. Then fine or imprisonment. It's the second time, you
see."</p>

<p>"Well, your friends will give evidence for you and we will
have a good man to defend you."</p>

<p>Linden shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"You never know who are your friends. They slip away like
water when it comes to the pinch."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't, for one," said Malone, heartily. "Keep me in
touch with what is going on. But I called because I had something
to ask you."</p>

<p>"I am sorry, but I am really not fit." Linden held out a
quivering hand.</p>

<p>"No, no, nothing psychic. I simply wanted to ask you whether
the presence of a strong sceptic would stop all your
phenomena?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. But, of course, it makes everything more
difficult. If they will be quiet and reasonable we can get
results. But they know nothing, break every law, and ruin their
own sittings. There was old Sherbank, the doctor, the other day.
When the raps came on the table he jumped up, put his hand on the
wall, and cried, 'Now then, put a rap on the palm of my hand
within five seconds'. Because he did not get it he declared it
was all humbug and stamped out of the room. They will not admit
that there are fixed laws in this as in everything else."</p>

<p>"Well, I must confess that the man I am thinking of might be
quite as unreasonable. It is the great Professor Challenger."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I've heard he is a hard case."</p>

<p>"Would you give him a sitting?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you desired it."</p>

<p>"He won't come to you or to any place you name. He imagines
all sorts of wires and contrivances. You might have to come down
to his country house."</p>

<p>"I would not refuse if it might convert him."</p>

<p>"And when?"</p>

<p>"I can do nothing until this horrible affair is over. It will
take a month or two."</p>

<p>"Well, I will keep in touch with you till then. When all is
well again we shall make our plans and see if we can bring these
facts before him, as they have been brought before me. Meanwhile,
let me say how much I sympathize. We will form a committee of
your friends and all that can will surely be done."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch07" id="ch07"></a>VII. &mdash; IN WHICH THE
NOTORIOUS CRIMINAL GETS WHAT THE BRITISH LAW CONSIDERS TO BE HIS
DESERTS.</h2>

<p class="first">BEFORE we pursue further the psychic adventures
of our hero and heroine, it would be well to see how the British
law dealt with that wicked man, Mr. Tom Linden.</p>

<p>The two policewomen returned in triumph to Bardley Square
Station where Inspector Murphy, who had sent them, was waiting
for their report. Murphy was a jolly-looking, red-faced, black-
moustached man who had a cheerful, fatherly way with women which
was by no means justified by his age or virility. He sat behind
his official table, his papers strewn in front of him.</p>

<p>"Well, girls," he said as the two women entered, "what
luck?"</p>

<p>"I think it's a go, Mr. Murphy," said the elder policewoman.
"We have the evidence you want."</p>

<p>The Inspector took up a written list of questions from his
desk.</p>

<p>"You ran it on the general lines that I suggested?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. I said my husband was killed at Ypres."</p>

<p>"What did he do?"</p>

<p>"Well, he seemed sorry for me."</p>

<p>"That, of course, is part of the game. He'll be sorry for
himself before he is through with it. He didn't say, 'You are a
single woman and never had a husband?'"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, that's one up against his spirits, is it not? That
should impress the Court. What more?"</p>

<p>"He felt round for names. They were all wrong."</p>

<p>"Good!"</p>

<p>"He believed me when I said that Miss Bellinger here was my
daughter."</p>

<p>"Good again! Did you try the Pedro stunt?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he considered the name, but I got nothing."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's a pity. But, anyhow, he did not know that Pedro
was your Alsatian dog. He considered the name. That's good
enough. Make the jury laugh and you have your verdict. Now about
fortune-telling? Did you do what I suggested?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I asked about Amy's young man. He did not give much that
was definite."</p>

<p>"Cunning devil! He knows his business."</p>

<p>"But he did say that she would be unhappy if she married
him."</p>

<p>"Oh, he did, did he? Well, if we spread that a little we have
got all we want. Now sit down and dictate your report while you
have it fresh. Then we can go over it together and see how we can
put it best. Amy must write one, also."</p>

<p>"Very good, Mr. Murphy."</p>

<p>"Then we shall apply for the warrant. You see, it all depends
upon which magistrate it comes before. There was Mr. Dalleret who
let a medium off last month. He is no we to us. And Mr. Lancing
has been mixed up with these people. Mr. Melrose is a stiff
materialist. We could depend on him, and have timed the arrest
accordingly. It would never do to fail to get our
conviction."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you get some of the public to corroborate?" The
inspector laughed.</p>

<p>"We are supposed to be protecting the public, but between you
and me none of the public have ever yet asked to be protected.
There are no complaints. Therefore it is left to us to uphold the
law as best we can. As long as it is there we have got to enforce
it. Well, good-bye, girls! Let me have the report by four
o'clock."</p>

<p>"Nothing for it, I suppose?" said the elder woman, with a
smile.</p>

<p>"You wait, my dear. If we get twenty-five pounds fine it has
got to go somewhere&mdash;Police Fund, of course, but there may
be something over. Anyhow, you go and cough it up and then we
shall see."</p>

<p>Next morning a scared maid broke into Linden's modest study.
"Please sir, it's an officer."</p>

<p>The man in blue followed hard at her heels.</p>

<p>"Name of Linden?" said he, and handing a folded sheet of
foolscap he departed.</p>

<p>The stricken couple who spent their lives in bringing comfort
to others were sadly in need of comfort themselves. She put her
arm round his neck while they read the cheerless document:</p>
<br>

<p class="typewriter">To THOMAS LINDEN of 40, Tullis Street,
N.W.</p>

<p class="typewriter">Information has been laid this day by
Patrick Murphy, Inspector Of Police, that you the said Thomas
Linden on the 10th day of November at the above dwelling did
profess to Henrietta Dresser and to Amy Bellinger to tell
fortunes to deceive and impose on certain of His Majesty's
subjects, to wit those above mentioned. You are therefore
summoned to appear before the Magistrate of the Police Court in
Bardsley Square on Wednesday next, the 17th, at the hour of 11 in
the forenoon to answer to the said information.</p>

<p class="typewriter">Dated the 10th day of November.</p>

<p class="typewriter">(signed) B.J.WITHERS.</p>

<p><br> On the same afternoon Mailey called upon Malone and they
sat in consultation over this document. Then they went together
to see Summerway Jones, an acute solicitor and an earnest student
of psychic affairs. Incidentally, he was a hard rider to hounds,
a good boxer, and a man who carried a fresh-air flavour into the
mustiest law chambers. He arched his eyebrows over the
summons.</p>

<p>"The poor devil has not an earthly!" said he. "He's lucky to
have a summons. Usually they act on a warrant. Then the man is
carted right off, kept in the cells all night, and tried next
morning with no one to defend him. The police are cute enough, of
course, to choose either a Roman Catholic or a materialist as the
magistrate. Then, by the beautiful judgment of Chief Justice
Lawrence&mdash;the first judgment, I believe, that he delivered
in that high capacity&mdash;the profession of mediumship or
wonder-working is in itself a legal crime, whether it be genuine
or no, so that no defence founded upon good results has a look
in. It's a mixture of religious persecution and police blackmail.
As to the public, they don't care a damn! Why should they? If
they don't want their fortune told, they don't go. The whole
thing is the most absolute bilge and a disgrace to our
legislature."</p>

<p>"I'll write it up," said Malone, glowing with Celtic fire.</p>

<p>"What do you call the Act?"</p>

<p>"Well, there are two Acts, each more putrid than the other,
and both passed long before Spiritualism was ever heard of. There
is the Witchcraft Act dating from George the Second. That has
become too absurd, so they only use it as a second string. Then
there is the Vagrancy Act of 1824. It was passed to control the
wandering gipsy folk on the roadside, and was never intended, of
course, to be used like this." He hunted among his papers. "Here
is the beastly thing. 'Every person professing to tell fortunes
or using any subtle craft, means or device to deceive and impose
on any of His Majesty's subjects shall be deemed a rogue and a
vagabond', and so on and so forth. The two Acts together would
have roped in the whole Early Christian movement just as surely
as the Roman persecution did."</p>

<p>"Lucky there are no lions now," said Malone.</p>

<p>"Jackasses!" said Mailey. "That's the modern substitute. But
what are we to do?"</p>

<p>"I'm damned if I know!" said the solicitor, scratching his
head. "It's perfectly hopeless!"</p>

<p>"Oh, dash it all!" cried Malone, "we can't give it up so
easily. We know the man is an honest man."</p>

<p>Mailey turned and grasped Malone's hand.</p>

<p>"I don't know if you call yourself a Spiritualist yet," he
said, "but you are the kind of chap we want. There are too many
white-livered folk in our movement who fawn on a medium when all
is well, and desert him at the first breath of an accusation But,
thank God! there are a few stalwarts. There is Brookes and Rodwin
and Sir James Smith. We can put up a hundred or two among
us."</p>

<p>"Right-o!" said the solicitor, cheerily. "If you feel like
that we will give you a run for your money."</p>

<p>"How about a K.C.?"</p>

<p>"Well, they don't plead in police courts. If you'll leave it
in my hands I fancy I can do as well as anyone, for I've had a
lot of these cases. It will keep the costs down, too."</p>

<p>"Well, we are with you. And we will have a few good men at our
back."</p>

<p>"If we do nothing else we shall ventilate it," said
Malone.</p>

<p>"I believe in the good old British public. Slow and stupid,
but sound at the core. They will not stand for injustice if you
can get the truth into their heads."</p>

<p>"They damned well need trepanning before you can get it
there," said the solicitor. "Well, you do your bit and I'll do
mine and we will see what comes of it."</p>

<p>The fateful morning arrived and Linden found himself in the
dock facing a spruce, middle-aged man with rat-trap jaws, Mr.
Melrose, the redoubtable police magistrate. Mr. Melrose had a
reputation for severity with fortune-tellers and all who foretold
the future, though he spent the intervals in his court by reading
up the sporting prophets, for he was an ardent follower of the
Turf, and his trim, fawn-coloured coat and rakish hat were
familiar objects at every race meeting which was within his
reach. He was in no particularly good humour this morning as he
glanced at the charge-sheet and then surveyed the prisoner. Mrs.
Linden had secured a position below the dock, and occasionally
extended her hand to pat that of the prisoner which rested on the
edge. The court was crowded and many of the prisoner's clients
had attended to show their sympathy.</p>

<p>"Is this case defended?" asked Mr. Melrose.</p>

<p>"Yes, your worship," said Summerway Jones. "May I, before it
opens, make an objection?"</p>

<p>"If you think it worth while, Mr. Jones."</p>

<p>"I beg to respectfully request your ruling before the case is
proceeded with. My client is not a vagrant, but a respectable
member of the community, living in his own house, paying rates
and taxes, and on the same footing as every other citizen. He is
now prosecuted under the fourth section of the Vagrancy Act of
1824, which is styled, 'An Act for punishing idle and disorderly
persons, and rogues and vagabonds'. The Act was intended, as the
words imply, to restrain lawless gipsies and others, who at that
time infested the country. I ask your worship to rule that my
client is clearly not a person within the purview of this Act or
liable to its penalties."</p>

<p>The magistrate shook his head.</p>

<p>"I fear, Mr. Jones, that there have been too many precedents
for the Act to be now interpreted in this limited fashion. I will
ask the solicitor prosecuting on behalf of the Commissioner of
Police to put forward his evidence." A little bull of a man with
side-whiskers and a raucous voice sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"I call Henrietta Dresser."</p>

<p>The elder policewoman popped up in the box with the alacrity
of one who is used to it. She held an open notebook in her
hand.</p>

<p>"You are a policewoman, are you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I understand that you watched the prisoner's home the day
before you called on him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"How many people went in?"</p>

<p>"Fourteen, sir."</p>

<p>"Fourteen people. And I believe the prisoner's average fee is
ten and sixpence."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Seven pounds in one day! Pretty good wages when many an
honest man is content with five shillings."</p>

<p>"These were the tradespeople!" cried Linden.</p>

<p>"I must ask you not to interrupt. You are already very
efficiently represented" said the magistrate severely.</p>

<p>"Now, Henrietta Dresser," continued the prosecutor, wagging
his pince-nez. "Let's hear what occurred when you and Amy
Bellinger visited the prisoner."</p>

<p>The policewoman gave an account which was in the main true,
reading it from her book. She was not a married woman, but the
medium had accepted her statement that she was. He had fumbled
with several names and had seemed greatly confused. The name of a
dog&mdash;Pedro had been submitted to him, but he had not
recognized it as such. Finally, he had answered questions as to
the future of her alleged daughter, who was, in fact, no relation
to her, and had foretold that she would be unhappy in her
marriage.</p>

<p>"Any questions, Mr. Jones?" asked the magistrate.</p>

<p>"Did you come to this man as one who needed consolation? And
did he attempt to give it?"</p>

<p>"I suppose you might put it so."</p>

<p>"You professed deep grief, I understand."</p>

<p>"I tried to give that impression."</p>

<p>"You do not consider that to be hypocrisy?"</p>

<p>"I did what was my duty."</p>

<p>"You saw no signs of psychic power, or anything abnormal?"
asked the prosecutor.</p>

<p>"No, he seemed a very nice, ordinary sort of man."</p>

<p>Amy Bellinger was the next witness. She appeared with her
notebook in her hand.</p>

<p>"May I ask, your worship, whether it is in order that these
witnesses should read their evidence?" asked Mr. Jones.</p>

<p>"Why not?" queried the magistrate. "We desire the exact facts"
do we not?"</p>

<p>"We do. Possibly Mr. Jones does not," said the prosecuting
solicitor.</p>

<p>"It is clearly a method of securing that the evidence of these
two witnesses shall be in accord," said Jones. "I submit that
these accounts are carefully prepared and collated."</p>

<p>"Naturally, the police prepare their case," said the
magistrate. "I do not see that you have any grievance, Mr. Jones.
Now, witness, let us hear your evidence."</p>

<p>It followed on the exact lines of the other.</p>

<p>"You asked questions about your fiance? You had no fiance,"
said Mr. Jones.</p>

<p>"That is so."</p>

<p>"In fact, you both told a long sequence of lies?"</p>

<p>"With a good object in view."</p>

<p>"You thought the end justified the means?"</p>

<p>"I carried out my instructions."</p>

<p>"Which were given you beforehand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we were told what to ask."</p>

<p>"I think," said the magistrate, "that the policewomen have
given their evidence very fairly and well. Have you any witnesses
for the defence, Mr. Jones?"</p>

<p>"There are a number of people in court, your worship, who have
received great benefit from the mediumship of the prisoner. I
have subpoenaed one woman who was, by her own account, saved from
suicide that very morning by what he told her. I have another man
who was an atheist, and had lost all belief in future life. He
was completely converted by his experience of psychic phenomena.
I can produce men of the highest eminence in science and
literature who will testify to the real nature of Mr. Linden's
powers."</p>

<p>The magistrate shook his head.</p>

<p>"You must know, Mr. Jones, that such evidence would be quite
beside the question. It has been clearly laid down by the ruling
of the Lord Chief Justice and others that the law of this country
does not recognize supernatural powers of any sort whatever, and
that a pretence of such powers where payment is involved
constitutes a crime in itself. Therefore your suggestion that you
should call witnesses could not possibly lead to anything save a
wasting of the time of the court. At the same time, I am, of
course, ready to listen to any observations which you may care to
make after the solicitor for the prosecution has spoken."</p>

<p>"Might I venture to point out, your worship," said Jones,
"that such a ruling would mean the condemnation of any sacred or
holy person of whom we have any record, since even holy persons
have to live, and have therefore to receive money."</p>

<p>"If you refer to Apostolic times, Mr. Jones," said the
magistrate sharply, "I can only remind you that the Apostolic age
is past and also that Queen Anne is dead. Such an argument is
hardly worthy of your intelligence. Now, sir, if you have
anything to add..."</p>

<p>Thus encouraged the prosecutor made a short address, stabbing
the air at intervals with his pince-nez as if every stab
punctured afresh all claims of the spirit. He pictured the
destitution among the working-classes, and yet charlatans, by
advancing wicked and blasphemous claims, were able to earn a rich
living. That they had real powers was, as had been observed,
beside the question, but even that excuse was shattered by the
fact that these policewomen, who had discharged an unpleasant
duty in a most exemplary way, had received nothing but nonsense
in return for their money. Was it likely that other clients fared
an better? These parasites were increasing in number, trading
upon the finer feelings of bereaved parents, and it was high time
that some exemplary punishment should warn them that they would
be wise to turn their hands to some more honest trade.</p>

<p>Mr. Summerway Jones replied as best he might. He began by
pointing out that the Acts were being used for a purpose for
which they were never intended. ("That point has already been
considered!" snapped the magistrate.) The whole position was open
to criticism. The convictions were secured by evidence from
<em>agents-provocateurs</em>, who, if any crime had been
committed, were obviously inciters to it and also participants.
The fines obtained were often deflected for purposes in which the
police had a direct interest.</p>

<p>"Surely, Mr. Jones, you do not mean to cast a reflection upon
the honesty of the police!"</p>

<p>The police were human, and were naturally inclined to stretch
a point where there own interests were affected. All these cases
were artificial. There was no record at any time of any real
complaint from the public or any demand for protection. There
were frauds in every profession, and if a man deliberately
invested and lost a guinea in a false medium he had no more right
to protection than the man who invested his money in a bad
company on the stock market. Whilst the police were wasting time
upon such cases, and their agents were weeping crocodile tears in
the character of forlorn mourners, many of her branches of real
crime received far less attention than they deserved. The law was
quite arbitrary in its action. Every big garden-party, even, as
he had been informed, every police <em>fte</em> was incomplete
without its fortune-teller or palmist.</p>

<p>Some years ago the <em>Daily Mail</em> had raised an outcry
against fortune-tellers. That great man, the late Lord
Northcliffe, had been put in the box by the defence, and it had
been shown that one of his other papers was running a palmistry
column, and that the fees received were divided equally between
the palmist and the proprietors. He mentioned this in no spirit
which was derogatory to the memory of this great mall, but merely
as an example of the absurdity of the law as it was now
administered. Whatever might be the individual opinion of members
of that court, it was incontrovertible that a large number of
intelligent and useful citizens regarded this power of mediumship
as a remarkable manifestation of the power of spirit, making for
the great improvement of the race. Was it not a most fatal policy
in these days of materialism to crush down by law that which in
its higher manifestation might work for the regeneration of
mankind? As to the undoubted fact that information received by
the policewomen was incorrect and that their lying statements
were not detected by the medium, it was a psychic law that
harmonious conditions were essential for true results, and that
deceit on one side produced confusion on the other. If the court
would for a moment adopt the Spiritualistic hypothesis, they
would realize how absurd it would be to expect that angelic hosts
would descend in order to answer the questions of two mercenary
and hypocritical inquirers.</p>

<p>Such, in a short synopsis, was the general line of Mr.
Summerway Jones's defence which reduced Mrs. Linden to tears and
threw the magistrate's clerk into a deep slumber. The magistrate
himself rapidly brought the matter to a conclusion.</p>

<p>"Your quarrel, Mr. Jones, seems to be with the law, and that
is outside my competence. I administer it as I find it, though I
may remark that I am entirely in agreement with it. Such men as
the defendant are the noxious fungi which collect on a corrupt
society, and the attempt to compare their vulgarities with the
holy men of old, or to claim similar gifts, must be reprobated by
all right-thinking men.</p>

<p>"As to you, Linden," he added, fixing his stern eyes upon the
prisoner, "I fear that you are a hardened offender since a
previous conviction has not altered your ways. I sentence you,
therefore, to two months' hard labour without the option of a
fine."</p>

<p>There was a scream from Mrs. Linden.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, dear, don't fret," said the medium, glancing over
the side of the dock. An instant later he had been hurried down
to the cell.</p>

<p>Summerway Jones, Mailey and Malone met in the hall, and Mailey
volunteered to escort the poor stricken woman home.</p>

<p>"What had he ever done but bring comfort to all?" she moaned.
"Is there a better man living in the whole great City of
London?"</p>

<p>"I don't think there is a more useful one," said Mailey. "I'll
venture to say that the whole of Crockford's Directory with the
Archbishops at their head could not prove the things of religion
as I have seen Tom Linden prove them, or convert an atheist as I
have seen Linden convert him."</p>

<p>"It's a shame! A damned shame!" said Malone, hotly.</p>

<p>"The touch about vulgarity was funny," said Jones. "I wonder
if he thinks the Apostles were very cultivated people. Well, I
did my best. I had no hopes, and it has worked out as I thought.
It is a pure waste of time."</p>

<p>"Not at all," Malone answered. "It has ventilated an evil.
There were reporters in court. Surely some of them have some
sense. They will note the injustice."</p>

<p>"Not they," said Mailey. "The Press is hopeless. My God, what
a responsibility these people take on themselves, and how little
they guess the price that each will pay! I know. I have spoken
with them while they were paying it."</p>

<p>"Well, I for one will speak out," said Malone, "and I believe
others will also. The Press is more independent and intelligent
than you seem to think."</p>

<p>But Mailey was right, after all. When he had left Mrs. Linden
in her lonely home and had reached Fleet Street once more, Malone
bought a <em>Planet</em>. As he opened it a scare headline met
his eye:</p> <br>

<p class="headline">

IMPOSTOR IN THE POLICE COURT.<br>

DOG MISTAKEN FOR MAN.<br>

WHO WAS PEDRO?<br>

EXEMPLARY SENTENCE.</p>

<p><br> He crumpled the paper up in his hand.</p>

<p>"No wonder these Spiritualists feel bitterly," he thought
"They have good cause."</p>

<p>Yes, poor Tom Linden had a bad Press. He went down into his
miserable cell amid universal objurgation. The <em>Planet</em>,
an evening paper which depended for its circulation upon the
sporting forecasts of Captain Touch-and-go, remarked upon the
absurdity of forecasting the future. Honest John, a weekly
journal which had been mixed up with some of the greatest frauds
of the century, was of the opinion that the dishonesty of Linden
was a public scandal. A rich country rector wrote to <em>The
Times</em> to express his indignation that anyone should profess
to sell the gifts of the spirit. The Churchman remarked that such
incidents arose from the growing infidelity, while the
Freethinker saw in them a reversion to superstition. Finally Mr.
Maskelyne showed the public, to the great advantage of his box
office, exactly how the swindle was perpetrated. So for a few
days Tom Linden was what the French call a <em>"succs
d'excration."</em> Then the world moved on and he was left to
his fate.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch08" id="ch08"></a>VIII. &mdash; IN WHICH THREE
INVESTIGATORS COME UPON A DARK SOUL</h2>

<p class="first">LORD ROXTON had returned from a Central American
heavy game shooting, and had at once carried out a series of
Alpine ascents which had satisfied and surprised everyone except
himself.</p>

<p>"Top of the Alps is becomin' a perfect bear-garden," said he.
"Short of Everest there don't seem to be any decent privacy
left."</p>

<p>His advent into London was acclaimed by a dinner given in his
honour at the 'Travellers' by the Heavy Game Society. The
occasion was private and there were no reporters, but Lord
Roxton's speech was fixed verbatim in the minds of all his
audience and has been imperishably preserved. He writhed for
twenty minutes under the flowery and eulogistic periods of the
president, and rose himself in the state of confused indignation
which the Briton feels when he is publicly approved. "Oh, I say!
By Jove! What!" was his oration, after which he resumed his seat
and perspired profusely.</p>

<p>Malone was first aware of Lord Roxton's return through
McArdle, the crabbed old red-headed news editor, whose bald dome
projected further and further from its ruddy fringe as the years
still found him slaving at the most grinding of tasks. He
retained his keen scent of what was good copy, and it was this
sense of his which caused him one winter morning to summon Malone
to his presence. He removed the long glass tube which he used as
a cigarette-holder from his lips, and he blinked through his big
round glasses at his subordinate.</p>

<p>"You know that Lord Roxton is back in London?"</p>

<p>"I had not heard."</p>

<p>"Aye, he's back. Dootless you've heard that he was wounded in
the war. He led a small column in East Africa and made a wee war
of his own till he got an elephant bullet through his chest. Oh,
he's done fine since then, or he couldn't be climbin' these
mountains. He's a deevil of a man and aye stirring up something
new."</p>

<p>"What is the latest?" asked Malone, eyeing a slip of paper
which McArdle was waving between his finger and thumb.</p>

<p>"Well, that's where he impinges on you. I was thinking maybe
you could hunt in couples and, there would be copy in it. There's
a leaderette in the Evening Standard" He handed it over. It ran
thus:</p>

<p>"A quaint advertisement in the columns of a contemporary shows
that the famous Lord John Roxton, third son of the Duke of
Pomfret, is seeking fresh worlds to conquer. Having exhausted the
sporting adventures of this terrestrial globe, he is now turning
to those of the dim, dark and dubious regions of psychic
research. He is in the market apparently for any genuine specimen
of a haunted house, and is open to receive information as to any
violent or dangerous manifestation which called for
investigation. As Lord John Roxton is a man of resolute character
and one of the best revolver shots in England, we would warn any
practical joker that he would be well-advised to stand aside and
leave this matter to those who are said to be as impervious to
bullets as their supporters are to common sense."</p>

<p>McArdle gave his dry chuckle at the concluding words.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking they are getting pairsonal there, friend Malone,
for if you are no a supporter, you're well on the way. But are
you no of the opeenion that this chiel and you between you might
put up a spook and get two racy columns off him?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can see Lord Roxton," said Malone. "He's still, I
suppose, in his old rooms in the Albany. I would wish to call in
any case, so I can open this up as well."</p>

<p>Thus it was that in the late afternoon just as the murk of
London broke into dim circles of silver, the pressman found
himself once more walking down Vigo Street and accosting the
porter at the dark entrance of the old-fashioned chambers. Yes,
Lord John Roxton was in, but a gentleman was with him. He would
take a card. Presently he returned with word that in spite of the
previous visitor, Lord Roxton would see Malone at once. An
instant later, he had been ushered into the old luxurious rooms
with their trophies of war and of the chase. The owner of them
with outstretched hand was standing at the door, long, thin,
austere, with the same gaunt, whimsical, Don Quixote face as of
old. There was no change save that he was more aquiline, and his
eyebrows jutted more thickly over his reckless, restless
eyes.</p>

<p>"Hullo, young fellah!" he cried. "I was hopin' you'd draw this
old covert once more. I was comin' down to the office to look you
up. Come in! Come in! Let me introduce you to the Reverend
Charles Mason."</p>

<p>A very tall, thin clergyman, who was coiled up in a large
basket chair, gradually unwound himself and held out a bony hand
to the newcomer. Malone was aware of two very earnest and human
grey eyes looking searchingly into his, and of a broad, welcoming
smile which disclosed a double row of excellent teeth. It was a
worn and weary face, the tired face of the spiritual fighter, but
it was very kindly and companionable, none the less. Malone had
heard of the man, a Church of England vicar, who had left his
model parish and the church which he had built himself in order
to preach freely the doctrines of Christianity, with the new
psychic knowledge super-added.</p>

<p>"Why, I never seem to get away from the Spiritualists!" he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You never will, Mr. Malone," said the lean clergyman,
chuckling. "The world never will until it has absorbed this new
knowledge which God has sent. You can't get away from it. It is
too big. At the present moment, in this great city there is not a
place where men or women meet that it does not come up. And yet
you would not know it from the Press."</p>

<p>"Well, you can't level that reproach at the <em>Daily
Gazette</em>," said Malone. "Possibly you may have read my own
descriptive articles."</p>

<p>"Yes, I read them. They are at least better than the awful
sensational nonsense which the London Press usually serves up,
save when they ignore it altogether. To read a paper like <em>The
Times</em> you would never know that this vital movement existed
at all. The only editorial allusion to it that I can ever
remember was in a leading article when the great paper announced
that it would believe in it when it found it could, by means of
it, pick out more winners on a race-card than by other
means."</p>

<p>"Doosed useful, too," said Lord Roxton. "It's just what I
should have said myself. What!"</p>

<p>The clergyman's face was grave and he shook his head.</p>

<p>"That brings me back to the object of my visit," he said. He
turned to Malone. "I took the liberty of calling upon Lord Roxton
in connection with his advertisement to say that if he went on
such a quest with a good intention, no better work could be found
in the world, but if he did it out of a love of sport, following
some poor earth-bound soul in the same spirit as he followed the
white rhinoceros of the Lido, he might be playing with fire."</p>

<p>"Well, padre, I've been playin' with fire all my life and
that's nothin' new. What I mean&mdash;if you want me to look at
this ghost business from the religious angle, there's nothin'
doin', for the Church of England that I was brought up in fills
my very modest need. But if it's got a spice of danger, as you
say, then it's worth while. What!"</p>

<p>The Rev. Charles Mason smiled his kindly, toothsome grin.</p>

<p>"Incorrigible, is he not?" he said to Malone. "Well, I can
only wish you a fuller comprehension of the subject." He rose as
if to depart.</p>

<p>"Wait a bit, padre!" cried Lord Roxton, hurriedly. "When I'm
explorin', I begin by ropin' in a friendly native. I expect
you're just the man. Won't you come with me?"</p>

<p>"Where to?"</p>

<p>"Well, sit down and I'll tell you." He rummaged among a pile
of letters on his desk. "Fine selection of spooks!" he said. "I
got on the track of over twenty by the first post. This is an
easy winner, though. Read it for yourself. Lonely house, man
driven mad, tenants boltin' in the night, horrible spectre.
Sounds all right&mdash;what!"</p>

<p>The clergyman read the letter with puckered brows.</p>

<p>"It seems a bad case," said he.</p>

<p>"Well, suppose you come along. What! Maybe you can help clear
it up."</p>

<p>The Rev. Mason pulled out a pocket-almanac. "I have a service
for ex-Service men on Wednesday, and a lecture the same
evening."</p>

<p>"But we could start to-day."</p>

<p>"It's a long way."</p>

<p>"Only Dorsetshire. Three hours."</p>

<p>"What is your plan?"</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose a night in the house should do it."</p>

<p>"If there is any poor soul in trouble it becomes a duty. Very
well, I will come."</p>

<p>"And surely there is room for me," pleaded Malone.</p>

<p>"Of course there is, young fellah! What I mean&mdash;I expect
that old, red-headed bird at the office sent you round with no
other purpose. Ah, I thought so. Well, you can write an adventure
that is not perfect bilge for a change&mdash;what! There's a
train from Victoria at eight o'clock. We can meet there, and I'll
have a look in at old man Challenger as I pass."</p>

<p>They dined together in the train and after dinner reassembled
in their first-class carriage, which is the snuggest mode of
travel which the world can show. Roxton, behind a big black
cigar, was full of his visit to Challenger.</p>

<p>"The old dear is the same as ever. Bit my head off once or
twice in his own familiar way. Talked unadulterated tripe. Says
I've got brain-softenin', if I could think there was such a thing
as a real spook. 'When you're dead you're dead'". That's the old
man's cheery slogan. Surveyin' his contemporaries' he said,
extinction was a doosed good thing! 'It's the only hope of the
world', said he. 'Fancy the awful prospect if they survived'.
Wanted to give me a bottle of chlorine to chuck at the ghost. I
told him that if my automatic was not a spook-stopper, nothin'
else would serve. Tell me, padre, is this the first time you've
been on safari after this kind of game?"</p>

<p>"You treat the matter too lightly, Lord John," said the
clergyman gravely. "You have clearly had no experience of it. In
answer to your question I may say that I have several times tried
to help in similar cases."</p>

<p>"And you take it seriously?" asked Malone, making notes for
his article.</p>

<p>"Very, very seriously."</p>

<p>"What do you think these influences are?"</p>

<p>"I am no authority upon the general question. You know
Algernon Mailey, the barrister, do you not? He could give you
facts and figures. I approach the subject rather perhaps from the
point of view of instinct and emotion. I remember Mailey
lecturing on Professor Bozzano's book on ghosts where over five
hundred well-authenticated instances were given, every one of
them sufficient to establish an a priori case. There is
Flammarion, too. You can't laugh away evidence of that kind."</p>

<p>"I've read Bozzano and Flammarion, too," said Malone, "but it
is your own experience and conclusions that I want."</p>

<p>"Well, if you quote me, remember that I do not look on myself
as a great authority on psychic research. Wiser brains than mine
may come along and give some other explanation. Still, what I
have seen has led me to certain conclusions. One of them is to
think that there is some truth in the theosophical idea of
shells."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"They imagined that all spirit bodies near the earth were
empty shells or husks from which the real entity had departed.
Now, of course, we know that a general statement of that sort is
nonsense, for we could not get the glorious communications which
we do get from anything but high intelligences. But we also must
beware of generalizations. They are not all high intelligences.
Some are so low that I think the creature is purely external and
is an appearance rather than a reality."</p>

<p>"But why should it be there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is the question. It is usually allowed that there
is the natural body, as St. Paul called it, which is dissolved at
death, and the etheric or spiritual body which survives and
functions upon an etheric plane. Those are the essential things.
But we may really have as many coats as an onion and there may be
a mental body which may shed itself at any spot where great
mental or emotional strain has been experienced. It may be a dull
automatic simulacrum and yet carry something of our appearance
and thoughts."</p>

<p>"Well" said Malone, "that would to some extent get over the
difficulty, for I could never imagine that a murderer or his
victim could spend whole centuries re-acting the old crime. What
would be the sense of it?"</p>

<p>"Quite right, young fellah," said Lord Roxton. "There was a
pal of mine, Archie Soames, the gentleman Jock, who had an old
place in Berkshire. Well, Nell Gwynne had lived there once, and
he was ready to swear he met her a dozen times in the passage.
Archie never flinched at the big jump at the Grand National, but,
by Jove! he flinched at those passages after dark. Doosed fine
woman she was and all that, but dash it all! What I mean&mdash;
one has to draw the line&mdash;what!"</p>

<p>"Quite so!" the clergyman answered. "You can't imagine that
the real soul of a vivid personality like Nell could spend
centuries walking those passages. But if by chance she had ate
her heart out in that house, brooding and fretting, one could
think that she might have cast a shell and left some thought-
image of herself behind her."</p>

<p>"You said you had experiences of your own."</p>

<p>"I had one before ever I knew anything of Spiritualism. I
hardly expect that you will believe me, but I assure you it is
true. I was a very young curate up in the north. There was a
house in the village which had a poltergeist, one of those very
mischievous influences which cause so much trouble. I volunteered
to exorcize it. We have an official form of exorcism in the
Church, you know, so I thought that I was well-armed. I stood in
the drawing-room which was the centre of the disturbances, with
all the family on their knees beside me, and I read the service.
What do you think happened?"</p>

<p>Mason's gaunt face broke into a sweetly humorous laugh. "Just
as I reached Amen, when the creature should have been slinking
away abashed, the big bearskin hearthrug stood up on end and
simply enveloped me. I am ashamed to say that I was out of that
house in two jumps. It was then that I learned that no formal
religious proceeding has any effect at all."</p>

<p>"Then what has?"</p>

<p>"Well, kindness and reason may do something. You see, they
vary greatly. Some of these earthbound or earth-interested
creatures are neutral, like these simulacra or shells that I
speak of. Others are essentially good like these monks of
Glastonbury, who have manifested so wonderfully of late years and
are recorded by Bligh Bond. They are held to earth by a pious
memory. Some are mischievous children like the poltergeists. And
some&mdash;only a few, I hope&mdash;are deadly beyond words,
strong, malevolent creatures too heavy with matter to rise above
our earth plane&mdash;so heavy with matter that their vibrations
may be low enough to affect the human retina and to become
visible. If they have been cruel, cunning brutes in life, they
are cruel and cunning still with more power to hurt. It is evil
monsters of this kind who are let loose by our system of capital
punishment, for they die with unused vitality which may be
expended upon revenge."</p>

<p>"This Dryfont spook has a doosed bad record," said Lord
Roxton.</p>

<p>"Exactly. That is why I disapprove of levity. He seems to me
to be the very type of the creature I speak of. Just as an
octopus may have his den in some ocean cave, and come floating
out a silent image of horror to attack a swimmer, so I picture
such a spirit lurking in the dark of the house which he curses by
his presence, and ready to float out upon all whom he can
injure."</p>

<p>Malone's jaw began to drop.</p>

<p>"I say!" he exclaimed, "have we no protection?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think we have. If we had not, such a creature could
devastate the earth. Our protection is that there are white
forces as well as dark ones. We may call them 'guardian angels'
as the Catholics do, or 'guides' or 'controls', but whatever you
call them, they really do exist and they guard us from evil on
the spiritual plane."</p>

<p>"What about the chap who was driven mad, padre? Where was your
guide when the spook put the rug round you? What!"</p>

<p>"The power of our guides may depend upon our own worthiness.
Evil may always win for a time. Good wins in the end. That's my
experience in life."</p>

<p>Lord Roxton shook his head.</p>

<p>"If good wins, then it runs a doosed long waitin' race, and
most of us never live to see the finish. Look at those rubber
devils that I had a scrap with up the Putomayo River. Where are
they? What! Mostly in Paris havin' a good time. And the poor
niggers they murdered. What about them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we need faith sometimes. We have to remember that we
don't see the end. 'To be continued in our next' is the
conclusion of every life-story. That's where the enormous value
of the other world accounts come in. They give us at least one
chapter more."</p>

<p>"Where can I get that chapter?" asked Malone.</p>

<p>"There are many wonderful books, though the world has not yet
learned to appreciate them&mdash;records of the life beyond. I
remember one incident&mdash;you may take it as a parable, if you
like&mdash;but it is really more than that. The dead rich man
pauses before the lovely dwelling. His sad guide draws him away.
'It is not for you. It is for your gardener'. He shows him a
wretched shack. 'You gave us nothing to build with. It was the
best that we could do'. That may be the next chapter in the story
of our rubber millionaires."</p>

<p>Roxton laughed grimly.</p>

<p>"I gave some of them a shack that was six foot long and two
foot deep," said he. "No good shakin' your head, padre. What I
mean&mdash;I don't love my neighbour as myself, and never shall.
I hate some of 'em like poison."</p>

<p>"Well, we should hate sin, and, for my own part, I have never
been strong enough to separate sin from the sinner. How can I
preach when I am as human and weak as anyone?"</p>

<p>"Why, that's the only preachin' I could listen to," said Lord
Roxton. "The chap in the pulpit is over my head. If he comes down
to my level I have some use for him. Well, it strikes me we won't
get much sleep to-night. We've just an hour before we reach
Dryfont. Maybe we had better use it."</p>

<p>It was past eleven o'clock of a cold, frosty night when the
party reached their destination. The station of the little
watering-place was almost deserted, but a small, fat man in a fur
overcoat ran forward to meet them, and greeted them warmly.</p>

<p>"I am Mr. Belchamber, owner of the house. How do you do,
gentlemen? I got your wire, Lord Roxton, and everything is in
order. It is indeed kind of you to come down. If you can do
anything to ease my burden I shall indeed be grateful."</p>

<p>Mr. Belchamber led them across to the little Station Hotel
where they partook of sandwiches and coffee, which he had
thoughtfully ordered. As they ate he told them something of his
troubles. "It isn't as if I was a rich man, gentlemen. I am a
retired grazier and all my savings are in three houses. That is
one of them, the Villa Maggiore. Yes, I got it cheap, that's
true. But how could I think there was anything in this story of
the mad doctor?"</p>

<p>"Let's have the yarn," said Lord Roxton, munching at a
sandwich.</p>

<p>"He was there away back in Queen Victoria's time. I've seen
him myself. A long, stringy, dark-faced kind of man, with a round
back and a queer, shuffling way of walking. They say he had been
in India all his life, and some thought he was hiding from some
crime, for he would never show his face in the village and seldom
came out till after dark. He broke a dog's leg with a stone, and
there was some talk of having him up for it, but the people were
afraid of him, and no one would prosecute. The little boys would
run past, for he would sit glowering and glooming in the front
window. Then one day he didn't take the milk in, and the same the
next day, and so they broke the door open, and he was dead in his
bath&mdash;but it was a bath of blood, for he opened the veins of
his arm. Tremayne was his name. No one here forgets it."</p>

<p>"And you bought the house?"</p>

<p>"Well, it was re-papered and painted and fumigated, and done
up outside. You'd have said it was a new house. Then, I let it to
Mr. Jenkins of the Brewery. Three days he was in it. I lowered
the rent, and Mr. Beale, the retired grocer, took it. It was he
who went mad&mdash;clean mad&mdash; after a week of it. And I've
had it on my hands ever since&mdash;sixty pounds out of my
income, and taxes to pay on it, into the bargain. If you
gentlemen can do anything, for God's sake do it! If not, it would
pay me to burn it down."</p>

<p>The Villa Maggiore stood about half a mile from the town on
the slope of a low hill. Mr. Belchamber conducted them so far,
and even up to the hall door. It was certainly a depressing
place, with a huge, gambrel roof which came down over the upper
windows and nearly obscured them. There was a half-moon, and by
its light they could see that the garden was a tangle of scraggy,
winter vegetation, which had, in some places, almost overgrown
the path. It was all very still, very gloomy and very
ominous.</p>

<p>"The door is not locked," said the owner. "You will find some
chairs and a table in the sitting-room on the left of the hall. I
had a fire lit there, and there is a bucketful of coals. You will
be pretty comfortable, I hope. You won't blame me for not coming
in, but my nerves are not so good as they were." With a few
apologetic words, the owner slipped away, and they were alone
with their task.</p>

<p>Lord Roxton had brought a strong electric torch. On opening
the mildewed door, he flashed a tunnel of light down the passage,
uncarpeted and dreary, which ended in a broad, straight, wooden
staircase leading to the upper floor. There were doors on either
side of the passage. That on the right led into a large,
cheerless, empty room, with a derelict lawn-mower in one corner
and a pile of old books and journals. There was a corresponding
room upon the left which was a much more cheery apartment. A
brisk fire burned in the grate, there were three comfortable
chairs, and a deal table with a water carafe, a bucket of coals,
and a few other amenities. It was lit by a large oil-lamp. The
clergyman and Malone drew up to the fire, for it was very cold,
but Lord Roxton completed his preparations. From a little hand-
bag he extracted his automatic pistol, which he put upon the
mantelpiece. Then he produced a packet of candles, placing two of
them in the hall. Finally he took a ball of worsted and tied
strings of it across the back passage and across the opposite
door.</p>

<p>"We will have one look round," said he, when his preparations
were complete. "Then we can wait down here and take what
comes."</p>

<p>The upper passage led at right angles to left and right from
the top of the straight staircase. On the right were two large,
bare, dusty rooms, with the wallpaper hanging in strips and the
floor littered with scattered plaster. On the left was a single
large room in the same derelict condition. Out of it was the
bathroom of tragic memory, with the high, zinc bath still in
position. Great blotches of red lay within it, and though they
were only rust stains, they seemed to be terrible reminders from
the past. Malone was surprised to see the clergyman stagger and
support himself against the door. His face was ghastly white and
there was moisture on his brow. His two comrades supported him
down the stairs, and he sat for a little, as one exhausted,
before he spoke.</p>

<p>"Did you two really feel nothing?" he asked. "The fact is that
I am mediumistic myself and very open to psychic impressions.
This particular one was horrible beyond description."</p>

<p>"What did you get, padre?"</p>

<p>"It is difficult to describe these things. It was a sinking of
my heart, a feeling of utter desolation. All my senses were
affected. My eyes went dim. I smelt a terrible odour of
putrescence. The strength seemed to be sapped out of me. Believe
me, Lord Roxton, it is no light thing which we are facing to-
night."</p>

<p>The sportsman was unusually grave. "So I begin to think," said
he. "Do you think you are fit for the job?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry to have been so weak," Mr. Mason answered. "I
shall certainly see the thing through. The worse the case, the
more need for my help. I am all right now," he added, with his
cheery laugh, drawing an old charred briar from his pocket. "This
is the best doctor for shaken nerves. I'll sit here and smoke
till I'm wanted."</p>

<p>"What shape do you expect it to take?" asked Malone of Lord
Roxton.</p>

<p>"Well, it is something you can see. That's certain."</p>

<p>"That's what I cannot understand, in spite of all my reading,"
said Malone. "These authorities are all agreed that there is a
material basis, and that this material basis is drawn from the
human body. Call it ectoplasm, or what you like, it is human in
origin, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," Mason answered.</p>

<p>"Well, then, are we to suppose that this Dr. Tremayne builds
up his own appearance by drawing stuff from me and you?"</p>

<p>"I think, so far as I understand it, that in most cases a
spirit does so. I believe that when the spectator feels that he
goes cold, that his hair rises and the rest of it, he is really
conscious of this draft upon his own vitality which may be enough
to make him faint or even to kill him. Perhaps he was drawing on
me then."</p>

<p>"Suppose we are not mediumistic? Suppose we give out
nothing?"</p>

<p>"There is a very full case that I read lately," Mr. Mason
answered. "It was closely observed&mdash;reported by Professor
Neillson of Iceland. In that case the evil spirit used to go down
to an unfortunate photographer in the town, draw his supplies
from him, and then come back and use them. He would openly say,
'Give me time to get down to So-and-so. Then I will show you what
I can do'. He was a most formidable creature and they had great
difficulty in mastering him."</p>

<p>"Strikes me, young fellah, we have taken on a larger contract
than we knew," said Lord Roxton. "Well, we've done what we could.
The passage is well lit. No one can come at us except down the
stair without breaking the worsted. There is nothing more we can
do except just to wait."</p>

<p>So they waited. It was a weary time. A carriage clock had been
placed on the discoloured wooden mantelpiece, and slowly its
hands crept on from one to two and from two to three. Outside an
owl was hooting most dismally in the darkness. The villa was on a
by-road, and there was no human sound to link them up with life.
The padre lay dozing in his chair. Malone smoked incessantly.
Lord Roxton turned over the pages of a magazine. There were the
occasional strange tappings and creakings which come in the
silence of the night. Nothing else until...</p>

<p>Someone came down the stair.</p>

<p>There could not be a doubt of it. It was a furtive, and yet a
clear footstep. <em>Creak! Creak! Creak!</em> Then it had reached
the level. Then it had reached their door. They were all sitting
erect in their chairs, Roxton grasping his automatic. Had it come
in? The door was ajar, but had not further opened. Yet all were
aware of a sense that they were not alone, that they were being
observed. It seemed suddenly colder, and Malone was shivering. An
instant later the steps were retreating. They were low and swift
&mdash;much swifter than before. One could imagine that a
messenger was speeding back with intelligence to some great
master who lurked in the shadows above.</p>

<p>The three sat in silence, looking at each other.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said Lord Roxton at last. His face was pale but
firm. Malone scribbled some notes and the hour. The clergyman was
praying.</p>

<p>"Well, we are up against it," said Roxton after a pause. "We
can't leave it at that. We have to go through with it. I don't
mind tellin' you, padre, that I've followed a wounded tiger in
thick jungle and never had quite the feelin' I've got now. If I'm
out for sensations, I've got them. But I'm going upstairs."</p>

<p>"We will go, too," cried his comrades, rising from their
chairs.</p>

<p>"Stay here, young fellah! And you, too, padre. Three of us
make too much noise. I'll call you if I want you. My idea is just
to steal out and wait quiet on the stair. If that thing, whatever
it was, comes again, it will have to pass me."</p>

<p>All three went into the passage. The two candles were throwing
out little circles of light, and the stair was deeply
illuminated, with heavy shadows at the top. Roxton sat down half-
way up the stair, pistol in hand. He put his finger to his lips
and impatiently waved his companions back to the room. Then they
sat by the fire, waiting, waiting.</p>

<p>Half an hour, three-quarters&mdash;and then, suddenly it came.
There was a sound as of rushing feet, the reverberation of a
shot, a scuffle and a heavy fall, with a loud cry for help.
Shaking with horror, they rushed into the hall. Lord Roxton was
lying on his face amid a litter of plaster and rubbish. He seemed
half dazed as they raised him, and was bleeding where the skin
had been grazed from his cheek and hands. Looking up the stair,
it seemed that the shadows were blacker and thicker at the
top.</p>

<p>"I'm all right," said Roxton, as they led him to his chair.
"Just give me a minute to get my wind and I'll have another round
with the devil&mdash; for if this is not the devil, then none
ever walked the earth."</p>

<p>"You shan't go alone this time," said Malone.</p>

<p>"You never should," added the clergyman. "But tell us what
happened."</p>

<p>"I hardly know myself. I sat, as you saw, with my back to the
top landing. Suddenly I heard a rush. I was aware of something
dark right on the top of me. I half-turned and fired. The next
instant I was chucked down as if I had been a baby. All that
plaster came showering down after me. That's as much as I can
tell you."</p>

<p>"Why should we go further in the matter?" said Malone. "You
are convinced that this is more than human, are you not?"</p>

<p>"There is no doubt of that."</p>

<p>"Well, then, you have had your experience. What more can you
want?"</p>

<p>"Well, I, at least, want something more," said Mr. Mason. "I
think our help is needed."</p>

<p>"Strikes me that we shall need the help," said Lord Roxton,
rubbing his knee. "We shall want a doctor before we get through.
But I'm with you, padre. I feel that we must see it through. If
you don't like it, young fellah&mdash;" The mere suggestion was
too much for Malone's Irish blood.</p>

<p>"I am going up alone!" he cried, making for the door.</p>

<p>"No, indeed. I am with you." The clergyman hurried after
him.</p>

<p>"And you don't go without me!" cried Lord Roxton, limping in
the rear.</p>

<p>They stood together in the candle-lit, shadow-draped passage.
Malone had his hand on the balustrade and his foot on the lower
step, when it happened.</p>

<p>What was it? They could not tell themselves. They only knew
that the black shadows at the top of the staircase had thickened,
had coalesced, had taken a definite, batlike shape. Great God!
They were moving! They were rushing swiftly and noiselessly
downwards! Black, black as night, huge, ill-defined, semi-human
and altogether evil and damnable. All three men screamed and
blundered for the door. Lord Roxton caught the handle and threw
it open. It was too late; the thing was upon them. They were
conscious of a warm, glutinous contact, of a purulent smell, of a
half-formed, dreadful face and of entwining limbs. An instant
later all three were lying half-dazed and horrified, hurled
outwards on to the gravel of the drive. The door had shut with a
crash.</p>

<p class="caption">The black shadows were rushing swiftly and
noiselessly downwards!</p> </div> <br>

<p>Malone whimpered and Roxton swore, but the clergyman was
silent as they gathered themselves together, each of them badly
shaken and bruised, but with an inward horror which made all
bodily ill seem insignificant. There they stood in a little group
in the light of the sinking moon, their eyes turned upon the
black square of the door.</p>

<p>"That's enough," said Roxton, at last.</p>

<p>"More than enough," said Malone. "I wouldn't enter that house
again for anything Fleet Street could offer."</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?"</p>

<p>"Defiled, degraded&mdash;oh, it was loathsome!"</p>

<p>"Foul!" said Roxton!"Did you get the reek of it? And the
purulent warmth?"</p>

<p>Malone gave a cry of disgust. "Featureless save for the
dreadful eyes! Semi-materialized! Horrible!"</p>

<p>"What about the lights?"</p>

<p>"Oh, damn the lights! Let them burn. I am not going in
again!"</p>

<p>"Well, Belchamber can come in the morning. Maybe he is waiting
for us now at the inn."</p>

<p>"Yes, let us go to the inn. Let us get back to humanity."
Malone and Roxton turned away, but the clergyman stood fast. He
had drawn a crucifix from his pocket.</p>

<p>"You can go," said he. "I am going back."</p>

<p>"What! Into the house?"</p>

<p>"Yes, into the house."</p>

<p>"Padre, this is madness! It will break your neck. We were all
like stuffed dolls in its clutch."</p>

<p>"Well, let it break my neck. I am going."</p>

<p>"You are not! Here, Malone, catch hold of him!"</p>

<p>But it was too late With a few quick steps, Mr. Mason had
reached the door, flung it open, passed in and closed it behind
him. As his comrades tried to follow, they heard a creaking clang
upon the further side. The padre had bolted them out. There was a
great slit where the letter-box had been. Through it Lord Roxton
entreated him to return.</p>

<p>"Stay there!" said the quick, stern voice of the clergyman. "I
have my work to do. I will come when it is done." A moment later
he began to speak. His sweet, homely, affectionate accents rang
through the hall. They could only hear snatches outside, bits of
prayer, bits of exhortation, bits of kindly greeting. Looking
through the narrow opening, Malone could see the straight, dark
figure in the candlelight, its back to the door, its face to the
shadows of the stair, the crucifix held aloft in its right
hand.</p>

<p>His voice sank into silence and then there came one more of
the miracles of this eventful night. A voice answered him. It was
such a sound as neither of the auditors had heard before&mdash;a
guttural, rasping, croaking utterance, indescribably menacing.
What it said was short, but it was instantly answered by the
clergyman, his tone sharpened to a fine edge by emotion. His
utterance seemed to be exhortation and was at once answered by
the ominous voice from beyond. Again and again, and yet again
came the speech and the answer, sometimes shorter, sometimes
longer, varying in every key of pleading, arguing, praying,
soothing, and everything save upbraiding. Chilled to the marrow,
Roxton and Malone crouched by the door, catching snatches of that
inconceivable dialogue. Then, after what seemed a weary time,
though it was less than an hour, Mr. Mason, in a loud, full,
exultant tone, repeated the "Our Father." Was it fancy, or echo,
or was there really some accompanying voice in the darkness
beyond him? A moment later the light went out in the left-hand
window, the bolt was drawn, and the clergyman emerged carrying
Lord Roxton's bag. His face looked ghastly in the moonlight, but
his manner was brisk and happy.</p>

<p>"I think you will find everything here," he said, handing over
the bag.</p>

<p>Roxton and Malone took him by either arm and hurried him down
to the road.</p>

<p>"By Jove! You don't give us the slip again!" cried the
nobleman. "Padre, you should have a row of Victoria Crosses."</p>

<p>"No, no, it was my duty. Poor fellow, he needed help so badly.
I am but a fellow-sinner and yet I was able to give it."</p>

<p>"You did him good?"</p>

<p>"I humbly hope so. I was but the instrument of the higher
forces. The house is haunted no longer. He promised. But I will
not speak of it now. It may be easier in days to come."</p>

<p>The landlord and the maids stared at the three adventurers in
amazement when, in the chill light of the winter dawn, they
presented themselves at the inn once more. Each of them seemed to
have aged five years in the night. Mr. Mason, with the reaction
upon him, threw himself down upon the horsehair sofa in the
humble coffee-room and was instantly asleep.</p>

<p>"Poor chap! He looks pretty bad!" said Malone. Indeed, his
white, haggard face and long, limp limbs might have been those of
a corpse.</p>

<p>"We will get a cup of hot tea into him," Lord Roxton answered,
warming his hands at the fire, which the maid had just lit. "By
Jove! We shall be none the worse for some ourselves. Well, young
fellah, we've got what we came for. I've had my sensation, and
you've had your copy.</p>

<p>"And he has had the saving of a soul. Well, we must admit that
our objects seem very humble compared to his."</p>

<p>They caught the early train to London, and had a carriage to
themselves. Mason had said little and seemed to be lost in
thought. Suddenly he turned to his companions. "I say, you two,
would you mind joining me in prayer?" Lord Roxton made a grimace.
"I warn you, padre, I am rather out of practice."</p>

<p>"Please kneel down with me. I want your aid."</p>

<p>They knelt down, side by side, the padre in the middle. Malone
made a mental note of the prayer.</p>

<p>"Father, we are all Your children, poor, weak, helpless
creatures, swayed by Fate and circumstance. I implore You that
You will turn eyes of compassion upon the man, Rupert Tremayne,
who wandered far from You, and is now in the dark. He has sunk
deep, very deep, for he had a proud heart which would not soften,
and a cruel mind, which was filled with hate. But now he would
turn to the light, and so I beg help for him and for the woman,
Emma, who, for the love of him, has gone down into the darkness.
May she raise him, as she had tried to do. May they both break
the bonds of evil memory which tie them to earth. May they, from
to-night, move up towards that glorious light which sooner or
later shines upon even the lowest."</p>

<p>They rose from their knees.</p>

<p>"That's better!" cried the padre, thumping his chest with his
bony hand, and breaking out into his expansive, toothsome grin.
"What a night! Good Lord, what a night!"*</p>

<h2><a name="ch09" id="ch09"></a>IX. &mdash; WHICH INTRODUCES
SOME VERY PHYSICAL PHENOMENA</h2>

<p class="first">MALONE seemed destined to be entangled in the
affairs of the Linden family, for he had hardly seen the last of
the unfortunate Tom before he became involved in a very much more
unpleasant fashion with his unsavoury brother.</p>

<p>The episode began by a telephone ring in the morning and the
voice of Algernon Mailey at the far end of the wire.</p>

<p>"Are you clear for this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"At your service."</p>

<p>"I say, Malone, you are a hefty man. You played Rugger for
Ireland, did you not? You don't mind a possible rough-and-tumble,
do you?"</p>

<p>Malone grinned over the receiver.</p>

<p>"You can count me in."</p>

<p>"It may be really rather formidable. We shall have possibly to
tackle a prize-fighter."</p>

<p>"Right-o!" said Malone, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"And we want another man for the job. Do you know any fellow
who would come along just for the sake of the adventure. If he
knows anything about psychic matters, all the better."</p>

<p>Malone puzzled for a moment. Then he had an inspiration.</p>

<p>"There is Roxton," said he. "He's not a chicken, but he is a
useful man in a row. I think I could get him. He has been keen on
your subject since his Dorsetshire experience."</p>

<p>"Right! Bring him along! If he can't come, we shall have to
tackle the job ourselves. Forty-one, Belshaw Gardens, S.W. Near
Earl's Court Station. Three p.m. Right!"</p>

<p>Malone at once rang up Lord Roxton, and soon heard the
familiar voice.</p>

<p>"What's that, young fellah? A scrap? Why, certainly. What... I
mean I had a golf match at Richmond Deer Park, but this sounds
more attractive...What? Very good. I'll meet you there."</p>

<p>And so it came about that at the hour of three, Mailey, Lord
Roxton and Malone found themselves seated round the fire in the
comfortable drawing-room of the barrister. His wife, a sweet and
beautiful woman, who was his helpmate in his spiritual as well as
in his material life, was there to welcome them.</p>

<p>"Now, dear, you are not on in this act," said Mailey. "You
will retire discreetly into the wings. Don't worry if you hear a
row."</p>

<p>"But I do worry, dear. You'll get hurt."</p>

<p>Mailey laughed.</p>

<p>"I think your furniture may possibly get hurt. You have
nothing else to fear, dear. And it's all for the good of the
Cause. That always settles it," he explained, as his wife
reluctantly left the room. "I really think she would go to the
stake for the Cause. Her great, loving, womanly heart knows what
it would mean for this grey earth if people could get away from
the shadow of death, and realize the great happiness that is to
come. By Jove! she is an inspiration to me...Well," he went on
with a laugh, "I must not get on to that subject. We have
something very different to think of&mdash; something as hideous
and vile as she is beautiful and good. It concerns Tom Linden's
brother."</p>

<p>"I've heard of the fellow," said Malone. "I used to box a bit
and I am still a member of the N.S.C. Silas Linden was very
nearly champion in the Welters."</p>

<p>"That's the man. He is out of a job and thought he would take
up mediumship. Naturally I and other Spiritualists took him
seriously, for we all love his brother, and these powers often
run in families, so that his claim seemed reasonable. So we gave
him a trial last night."</p>

<p>"Well, what happened?"</p>

<p>"I suspected the fellow from the first. You understand that it
is hardly possible for a medium to deceive an experienced
Spiritualist. When there is deception it is at the expense of
outsiders. I watched him carefully from the first, and I seated
myself near the cabinet. Presently he emerged clad in white. I
broke the contact by prearrangement with my wife who sat next me,
and I felt him as he passed me. He was, of course, in white. I
had a pair of scissors in my pocket and snipped off a bit from
the edge."</p>

<p>Mailey drew a triangular piece of linen from his pocket.</p>

<p>"There it is, you see. Very ordinary linen. I have no doubt
the fellow was wearing his night-gown."</p>

<p>"Why did you not have a show-up at once?" asked Lord
Roxton.</p>

<p>"There were several ladies there, and I was the only really
able-bodied man in the room."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you propose?"</p>

<p>"I have appointed that he come here at three-thirty. He is due
now. Unless he has noticed the small cut in his linen, I don't
think he has any suspicion why I want him."</p>

<p>"What will you do?"</p>

<p>"Well, that depends on him. We have to stop him at any cost.
That is the way our Cause gets bemired. Some villain who knows
nothing about it comes into it for money and so the labours of
the honest mediums get discounted. The public very naturally
brackets them all together. With your help I can talk to this
fellow on equal terms which I certainly could not do if I were
alone. By Jove, here he is!"</p>

<p>There was a heavy step outside. The door was opened and Silas
Linden, fake medium and ex-prize-fighter, walked in. His small,
piggy grey eyes under their shaggy brows looked round with
suspicion at the three men. Then he forced a smile and nodded to
Mailey.</p>

<p>"Good day, Mr. Mailey. We had a good evening last night, had
we not?"</p>

<p>"Sit down, Linden," said Mailey, indicating a chair. "It's
about last night that I want to talk to you. You cheated us."</p>

<p>Silas Linden's heavy face flushed red with anger.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he cried, sharply.</p>

<p>"You cheated us. You dressed up and pretended to be a
spirit."</p>

<p>"You are a damned liar!" cried Linden. "I did nothing of the
sort."</p>

<p>Mailey took the rag of linen from his pocket and spread it on
his knee.</p>

<p>"What about that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, what about it?"</p>

<p>"It was cut out of the white gown you wore. I cut it out
myself as you stood in front of me. If you examine the gown you
will find the place. It's no use, Linden. The game is up. You
can't deny it."</p>

<p>For a moment the man was completely taken aback. Then he burst
into a stream of horrible profanity.</p>

<p>"What's the game?" he cried, glaring round him. "Do you think
I am easy and that you can play me for a sucker? Is it a frame-
up, or what? You've chose the wrong man for a try-on of that
sort."</p>

<p>"There is no use being noisy or violent, Linden," said Mailey
quietly, "I could bring you up in the police court to-morrow. I
don't want any public scandal, for your brother's sake. But you
don't leave this room until you have signed a paper that I have
here on my desk."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't, don't I? Who will stop me?"</p>

<p>"We will."</p>

<p>The three men were between him and the door.</p>

<p>"You will! Well, try that!" He stood before them with rage in
his eyes and his great hands knotted. "Will you get out of the
way?"</p>

<p>They did not answer, but they all three gave the fighting
snarl which is perhaps the oldest of all human expressions. The
next instant Linden was upon them, his fists flashing out with
terrific force. Mailey, who had boxed in his youth, stopped one
blow, but the next beat in his guard and he fell with a crash
against the door. Lord Roxton was hurled to one side, but Malone,
with a footballer's instinct, ducked his head and caught the
prize-fighter round the knees. If a man is too good for you on
his feet, then put him on his back, for he cannot be scientific
there. Over went Linden, crashing through an armchair before he
reached the ground. He staggered to one knee and got in a short
jolt to the chin, but Malone had him down again and Roxton's bony
hand had closed upon his throat. Silas Linden had a yellow streak
in him and he was cowed.</p>

<p>"Let up!" he cried. "That's enough!"</p>

<p>He lay now spreadeagled upon his back. Malone and Roxton were
bending over him. Mailey had gathered himself together, pale and
shaken after his fall.</p>

<p>"I'm all right!" he cried, in answer to a feminine voice at
the other side of the door. "No, not yet, dear, but we shall soon
be ready for you. Now, Linden, there's no need for you to get up,
for you can talk very nicely where you are. You've got to sign
this paper before you leave the room."</p>

<p>"What is the paper?" croaked Linden, as Roxton's grip upon his
throat relaxed.</p>

<p>"I'll read it to you."</p>

<p>Mailey took it from the desk and read aloud.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">"I, Silas Linden, hereby admit that I have
acted as a rogue and a scoundrel by simulating to be a spirit,
and I swear that I will never again in my life pretend to be a
medium. Should I break this oath, then this signed confession may
be used for my conviction in the police court."</p>

<br>

<p>"Will you sign that?"</p>

<p>"No, I am damned if I will!"</p>

<p>"Shall I give him another squeeze?" asked Lord Roxton.
"Perhaps I could choke some sense into him&mdash;what!"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Mailey. "I think that his case now would do
good in the police court, for it would show the public that we
are determined to keep our house clean. I'll give you one minute
for consideration, Linden, and then I ring up the police."</p>

<p>But it did not take a minute for the impostor to make up his
mind.</p>

<p>"All right," said he in a sulky voice, "I'll sign." He was
allowed to rise with a warning that if he played any tricks he
would not get off so lightly the second time. But there was no
kick left in him and he scrawled a big, coarse "Silas Linden" at
the bottom of the paper without a word. The three men signed as
witnesses.</p>

<p>"Now, get out!" said Mailey, sharply. "Find some honest trade
in future and leave sacred things alone!"</p>

<p>"Keep your damned cant to yourself!" Linden answered, and so
departed, grumbling and swearing, into the outer darkness from
which he had come. He had hardly passed before Mrs. Mailey had
rushed into the room to reassure herself as to her husband. Once
satisfied as to this she mourned over her broken chair, for like
all good women she took a personal pride and joy in every detail
of her little menage.</p>

<p>"Never mind, dear. It's a cheap price to pay in order to get
that blackguard out of the movement. Don't go away, you fellows.
I want to talk to you."</p>

<p>"And tea is just coming in."</p>

<p>"Perhaps something stronger would be better," said Mailey, and
indeed, all three were rather exhausted, for it was sharp while
it lasted. Roxton, who had enjoyed the whole thing immensely, was
full of vitality, but Malone was shaken and Mailey had narrowly
escaped serious injury from that ponderous blow.</p>

<p>"I have heard," said Mailey, as they all settled down round
the fire, "that this blackguard has sweated money out of poor Tom
Linden for years. It was a form of blackmail, for he was quite
capable of denouncing him. By Jove!" he cried, with sudden
inspiration, "that would account for the police raid. Why should
they pick Linden out of all the mediums in London? I remember now
that Tom told me the fellow had asked to be taught to be a
medium, and that he had refused to teach him."</p>

<p>"Could he teach him?" asked Malone. Mailey was thoughtful over
this question. "Well, perhaps he could," he said at last. "But
Silas Linden as a false medium would be very much less dangerous
than Silas Linden as a true medium."</p>

<p>"I don't follow you."</p>

<p>"Mediumship can be developed" said Mrs. Mailey. "One might
almost say it was catching."</p>

<p>"That was what the laying-on of hands meant in the early
Church," Mailey explained. "It was the conferring of thaumaturgic
powers. We can't do it now as rapidly as that. But if a man or
woman sits with the desire of development, and especially if that
sitting is in the presence of a real medium, the chance is that
powers will come."</p>

<p>"But why do you say that would be worse than false
mediumship?"</p>

<p>"Because it could be used for evil. I assure you, Malone, that
the talk of black magic and of evil entities is not an invention
of the enemy. Such things do happen and centre round the wicked
medium. You can get down into a region which is akin to the
popular idea of witchcraft, It is dishonest to deny it."</p>

<p>"Like attracts like," explained Mrs. Mailey, who was quite as
capable an exponent as her husband. "You get what you deserve. If
you sit with wicked people you get wicked visitors."</p>

<p>"Then there is a dangerous side to it?"</p>

<p>"Do you know anything on earth which has not a dangerous side
if it is mishandled and exaggerated? This dangerous side exists
quite apart from orthodox Spiritualism, and our knowledge is the
surest way to counteract it. I believe that the witchcraft of the
Middle Ages was a very real thing, and that the best way to meet
such practices is to cultivate the higher powers of the spirit.
To leave the thing entirely alone is to abandon the field to the
forces of evil."</p>

<p>Lord Roxton interposed in an unexpected way.</p>

<p>"When I was in Paris last year," said he, "there was a fellah
called La Paix who dabbled in the black magic business. He held
circles and the like. What I mean, there was no great harm in the
thing, but it wasn't what you would call very spiritual,
either."</p>

<p>"It's a side that I as a journalist would like to see
something of, if I am to report impartially upon the subject"
said Malone.</p>

<p>"Quite right!" Mailey agreed. "We want all the cards on the
table."</p>

<p>"Well, young fellah, if you would give me a week of your time
and come to Paris, I'll introduce you to La Paix," said
Roxton.</p>

<p>"It is a curious thing, but I also had a Paris visit in my
mind for our friend here," said Mailey. "I have been asked over
by Dr. Maupuis of the Institut Mtapsychique to see some of the
experiments which he is conducting upon a Galician medium. It is
really the religious side of this matter which interests me, and
that is conspicuously wanting in the minds of these scientific
men of the Continent; but for accurate, careful examination of
the psychic facts they are ahead of anyone except poor Crawford
of Belfast, who stood in a class by himself. I promised Maupuis
to run across and he has certainly been having some wonderful
&mdash;in some respects, some rather alarming results."</p>

<p>"Why alarming?"</p>

<p>"Well, his materializations lately have not been human at all.
That is confirmed by photographs. I won't say more, for it is
best that, if you go, you should approach it with an open
mind."</p>

<p>"I shall certainly go," said Malone. "I am sure my chief would
wish it."</p>

<p>Tea had arrived to interrupt the conversation in the
irritating way that our bodily needs intrude upon our higher
pursuits. But Malone was too keen to be thrown off his scent.</p>

<p>"You speak of these evil forces. Have you ever come in contact
with them?"</p>

<p>Mailey looked at his wife and smiled.</p>

<p>"Continually," he said. "It is part of our job. We specialize
on it."</p>

<p>"I understood that when there was an intrusion of that kind
you drove it away."</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. If we can help any lower spirit we do so,
and we can only do it by encouraging it to tell us its troubles.
Most of them are not wicked. They are poor, ignorant, stunted
creatures who are suffering the effects of the narrow and false
views which they have learned in this world. We try to help them
&mdash;and we do."</p>

<p>"How do you know that you do?"</p>

<p>"Because they report to us afterwards and register their
progress. Such methods are often used by our people. They are
called 'rescue circles'."</p>

<p>"I have heard of rescue circles. Where could I attend one?
This thing attracts me more and more. Fresh gulfs seem always
opening. I would take it as a great favour if you would help me
to see this fresh side of it." Mailey became thoughtful.</p>

<p>"We don't want to make a spectacle of these poor creatures. On
the other hand, though we can hardly claim you yet as a
Spiritualist, you have treated the subject with some
understanding and sympathy." He looked enquiringly at his wife,
who smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>"Ah, you have permission. Well then, you must know that we run
our own little rescue circle, and that at five o'clock to-day we
have our weekly sitting. Mr. Terbane is our medium. We don't
usually have anyone else except Mr. Charles Mason, the clergyman.
But if you both care to have the experience, we shall be very
happy if you will stay. Terbane should be here immediately after
tea. He is a railway-porter, you know, so his time is not his
own. Yes, psychic power in its varied manifestations is found in
humble quarters, but surely that has been its main characteristic
from the beginning&mdash;fishermen, carpenters, tent-makers,
camel drivers, these were the prophets of old. At this moment
some of the highest psychic gifts in England lie in a miner, a
cotton operative, a railway-porter, a barge-man and a charwoman.
Thus does history repeat itself, and that foolish beak, with Tom
Linden before him, was but Felix judging Paul. The old wheel goes
round."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>X. &mdash;  DE PROFUNDIS</h2>

<p class="first">THEY were still having tea when Mr. Charles
Mason was ushered in. Nothing draws people together into such
intimate soul-to-soul relationship as psychic quest, and thus it
was that Roxton and Malone, who had only known him in the one
episode, felt more near to this man than to others with whom they
had associated for years. This close vital comradeship is one of
the outstanding features of such communion. When his loosely-
built, straggling, lean clerical figure appeared, with that
gaunt, worn face illuminated by its human grin and dignified by
its earnest eyes, through the doorway, they both felt as if an
old friend had entered. His own greeting was equally cordial.</p>

<p>"Still exploring!" he cried, as he shook them by the hand. "We
will hope your new experiences will not be so nerve-racking as
our last."</p>

<p>"By Jove, padre!" said Roxton. "I've worn out the brim of my
hat taking it off to you since then."</p>

<p>"Why, what did he do?" asked Mrs. Mailey.</p>

<p>"No, no!" cried Mason. "I tried in my poor way to guide a
darkened soul. Let us leave it at that. But that is exactly what
we are here for now, and what these dear people do every week of
their lives. It was from Mr. Mailey here that I learned how to
attempt it."</p>

<p>"Well, certainly we have plenty of practice," said Mailey.
"You have seen enough of it, Mason, to know that."</p>

<p>"But I can't get the focus of this at all!" cried Malone.
"Could you clear my mind a little on the point? I accept, for the
moment, your hypothesis that we are surrounded by material earth-
bound spirits who find themselves under strange conditions which
they don't understand, and who want counsel and guidance. That
more or less expresses it, does it not?"</p>

<p>The Maileys both nodded their agreement.</p>

<p>"Well, their dead friends and relatives are presumably on the
other side and cognizant of their benighted condition They know
the truth. Could they not minister to the wants of these
afflicted ones far better than we can?"</p>

<p>"It is a most natural question," Mailey answered. "Of course
we put that objection to them and we can only accept their
answer. They appear to be actually anchored to the surface of
this earth, too heavy and gross to rise. The others are,
presumably, on a spiritual level and far separated from them.
They explain that they are much nearer to us and that they are
cognizant of us, but not of anything higher. Therefore it is we
who can reach them best."</p>

<p>"There was one poor dear dark soul&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My wife loves everybody and everything," Mailey explained.
"She is capable of talking of the poor dear devil."</p>

<p>"Well, surely they are to be pitied and loved!" cried the
lady. "This poor fellow was nursed along by us, week by week. He
had really come from the depths. Then one day he cried in
rapture, 'My mother has come! My mother is here!' We naturally
said, 'But why did she not come before?' 'How could she', said
he, 'when I was in so dark a place that she could not see
me?'"</p>

<p>"That's very well," said Malone, "but so far as I can follow
your methods it is some guide or control or higher Spirit who
regulates the whole matter and brings the sufferer to you. If he
can be cognizant, one would think other higher spirits could also
be."</p>

<p>"No, for it is his particular mission." said Mailey. "To show
how marked the divisions are I can remember one occasion when we
had a dark soul here. Our own people came through and did not
know he was there until we called their attention to it. When we
said to the dark soul, 'Don't you see our friends beside you?' he
answered, 'I can see a light but nothing else'."</p>

<p>At this point the conversation was interrupted by the arrival
of Mr. John Terbane from Victoria Station, where his mundane
duties lay. He was dressed now in civil garb and appeared as a
pale, sad-faced, clean-shaven, plump-featured man with dreamy,
thoughtful eyes, but no other indication of the remarkable uses
to which he was put.</p>

<p>"Have you my record?" was his first question.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mailey, smiling, handed him an envelope. "We kept it all
ready for you but you can read it at home. You see," she
explained, "poor Mr. Terbane is in trance and knows nothing of
the wonderful work of which he is the instrument, so after each
sitting my husband and I draw up an account for him."</p>

<p>"Very much astonished I am when I read it," said Terbane.</p>

<p>"And very proud, I should think," added Mason.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know about that," Terbane answered humbly. "I
don't see that the tool need to be proud because the worker
happens to use it. Yet it is a privilege, of course."</p>

<p>"Good old Terbane!" said Mailey, laying his hand
affectionately on the railwayman's shoulder. "The better the
medium the more unselfish. That is my experience. The whole
conception of a medium is one who gives himself up for the use of
others, and that is incompatible with selfishness. Well, I
suppose we had better get to work or Mr. Chang will scold
us."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked Malone.</p>

<p>"Oh, you will soon make the acquaintance of Mr. Chang! We need
not sit round the table. A semi-circle round the fire does very
well. Lights half-down. That is all right. You'll make yourself
comfortable, Terbane. Snuggle among the cushions."</p>

<p>The medium was in the corner of a comfortable sofa, and had
fallen at once into a doze. Both Mailey and Malone at with
notebooks upon their knees awaiting developments.</p>

<p>They were not long in coming. Terbane suddenly sat up, his
dreamy self transformed into a very alert and masterful
individuality. A subtle change had passed over his ace. An
ambiguous smile fluttered upon his lips, his eye seemed more
oblique and less open, his face projected. The two hands were
thrust into the sleeves of his blue lounge jacket.</p>

<p>"Good evening," said he, speaking crisply and in short
staccato sentences. "New faces! Who these?"</p>

<p>"Good evening, Chang," said the master of the house.</p>

<p>"You know Mr. Mason. This is Mr. Malone who studies our
subject. This is Lord Roxton who has helped me to-day."</p>

<p>As each name was mentioned, Terbane made a sweeping Oriental
gesture of greeting, bringing his hand down from his forehead.
His whole bearing was superbly dignified and very different from
the humble little man who had sat down a few minutes before.</p>

<p>"Lord Roxton!" he repeated. "An English milord! I knew Lord
&mdash;Lord Macart&mdash;No&mdash;I&mdash;I cannot say it. Alas!
I called him 'foreign devil' then. Chang, too, had much to
learn."</p>

<p>"He is speaking of Lord Macartney. That would be over a
hundred years ago. Chang was a great living philosopher then,"
Mailey explained.</p>

<p>"Not lose time!" cried the control. "Much to do to-day. Crowd
waiting. Some new, some old. I gather strange folk in my net. Now
I go." He sank back among the cushions. A minute elapsed, then he
suddenly sat up.</p>

<p>"I want to thank you," he said, speaking perfect English. "I
came two weeks ago. I have thought over all you said. The path is
lighter."</p>

<p>"Were you the spirit who did not believe in God?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! I said so in my anger. I was so weary&mdash;so
weary. Oh, the time, the endless time, the grey mist, the heavy
weight of remorse! Hopeless! Hopeless! And you brought me
comfort, you and this great Chinese spirit. You gave me the first
kind words I have had since I died."</p>

<p>"When was it that you died?"</p>

<p>"Oh! It seems an eternity. We do not measure as you do. It is
a long, horrible dream without change or break."</p>

<p>"Who was king in England?"</p>

<p>"Victoria was queen. I had attuned my mind to matter and so it
clung to matter. I did not believe in a future life. Now I know
that I was all wrong, but I could not adapt my mind to new
conditions."</p>

<p>"Is it bad where you are?"</p>

<p>"It is all&mdash;all grey. That is the awful part of it. One's
surroundings are so horrible."</p>

<p>"But there are many more. You are not alone."</p>

<p>"No, but they know no more than I. They, too, scoff and doubt
and are miserable."</p>

<p>"You will soon get out."</p>

<p>"For God's sake, help me to do so!"</p>

<p>"Poor soul!" said Mrs. Mailey in her sweet, caressing voice, a
voice which could bring every animal to her side. "You have
suffered much. But do not think of yourself. Think of these
others. Try to bring one of them up and so you will best kelp
yourself."</p>

<p>"Thank you, lady, I will. There is one here whom I brought. He
has heard you. We will go on together. Perhaps some day we may
find the light."</p>

<p>"Do you like to be prayed for?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, indeed I do!"</p>

<p>"I will pray for you," said Mason. "Could you say the 'Our
Father' now?" He uttered the old universal prayer, but before he
had finished Terbane had collapsed again among the cushions. He
sat up again as Chang.</p>

<p>"He come on well," said the control. "He give up time for
others who wait. That is good. Now I have hard case. Ow!"</p>

<p>He gave a comical cry of disapprobation and sank back. Next
moment he was up, his face long and solemn, his hands palm to
palm.</p>

<p>"What is this?" he asked in a precise and affected voice. "I
am at a loss to know what right this Chinese person has to summon
me here. Perhaps you can enlighten me."</p>

<p>"It is that we may perhaps help you."</p>

<p>"When I desire help, sir, I ask for it. At present I do not
desire it. The whole proceeding seems to me to be a very great
liberty. So far as this Chinaman can explain it, I gather that I
am the involuntary spectator of some sort of religious
service."</p>

<p>"We are a spiritualistic circle."</p>

<p>"A most pernicious sect. A most blasphemous proceeding. As a
humble parish priest I protest against such desecrations."</p>

<p>"You are held back, friend, by those narrow views. It is you
who suffer. We want to relieve you."</p>

<p>"Suffer? What do you mean, sir?"</p>

<p>"You realize that you have passed over?"</p>

<p>"You are talking nonsense!"</p>

<p>"Do you realize that you are dead?"</p>

<p>"How can I be dead when I am talking to you?"</p>

<p>"Because you are using this man's body."</p>

<p>"I have certainly wandered into an asylum."</p>

<p>"Yes, an asylum for bad cases. I fear you are one of them. Are
you happy where you are?"</p>

<p>"Happy? No, sir. My present surroundings are perfectly
inexplicable to me."</p>

<p>"Have you any recollection of being ill?"</p>

<p>"I was very ill indeed."</p>

<p>"So ill that you died."</p>

<p>"You are certainly out of your senses."</p>

<p>"How do you know you are not dead?"</p>

<p>"Sir, I must give you some religious instruction. When one
dies and has led an honourable life, one assumes a glorified body
and one associates with the angels. I am now in exactly the same
body as in life, and I am in a very dull, drab place. Such
companions as I have are not such as I have been accustomed to
associate with in life, and certainly no one could describe them
as angels. Therefore your absurd conjecture may be
dismissed."</p>

<p>"Do not continue to deceive yourself. We wish to help you. You
can never progress until you realize your position."</p>

<p>"Really, you try my patience too far. Have I not said
&mdash;?"</p>

<p>The medium fell back among the cushions. An instant later the
Chinese control, with his whimsical smile and his hands tucked
away in his sleeves, was talking to the circle.</p>

<p>"He good man&mdash;fool man&mdash;learn sense soon. Bring him
again. Not waste more time. Oh, my God! My God! Help! Mercy!
Help!"</p>

<p>He had fallen full length upon the sofa, face upwards, and his
cries were so terrible that the little audience all sprang to
their feet. "A saw! A saw! Fetch a saw!" yelled the medium. His
voice sank into a moan.</p>

<p>Even Mailey was agitated. The rest were horrified.</p>

<p>"Someone has obsessed him. I can't understand it. It may be
some strong evil entity."</p>

<p>"Shall I speak to him?" asked Mason.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment! Let it develop. We shall soon see."</p>

<p>The medium writhed in agony. "Oh, my God! Why don't you fetch
a saw!" he cried. "It's here across my breast-bone. It is
cracking! I feel it! Hawkin! Hawkin! Pull me from under! Hawkin!
Push up the beam! No, no, that's worse! And it's on fire! Oh,
horrible! Horrible!"</p>

<p>His cries were blood-curdling. They were all chilled with
horror. Then in an instant the Chinaman was blinking at them with
his slanting eyes.</p>

<p>"What you think of that, Mister Mailey?"</p>

<p>"It was terrible, Chang. What was it?"</p>

<p>"It was for him," nodding towards Malone. "He want newspaper
story, I give him newspaper story. He will understand. No time
'splain now. Too many waiting. Sailor man come next. Here he
come!"</p>

<p>The Chinaman was gone, and a jovial, puzzled grin passed over
the face of the medium. He scratched his head.</p>

<p>"Well, damn me," said he. "I never thought I would take orders
from a Chink, but he says 'hist!' and by crums you've got to hist
and no back talk either. Well, here I am. What did you want?"</p>

<p>"We wanted nothing."</p>

<p>"Well, the Chink seemed to think you did, for he slung me in
here."</p>

<p>"It was you that wanted something. You wanted knowledge."</p>

<p>"Well, I've lost my bearings, that's true. I know I am dead
'cause I've seen the gunnery lootenant, and he was blown to bits
before my eyes. If he's dead I'm dead and all the rest of us, for
we are over to the last man. But we've got the laugh on our sky-
pilot, for he's as puzzled as the rest of us. Damned poor pilot,
I call him. We're all taking our own soundings now."</p>

<p>"What was your ship?"</p>

<p>"The Monmouth."</p>

<p>"She that went down in battle with the German?"</p>

<p>"That's right. South American waters. It was clean hell. Yes,
it was hell." There was a world of emotion in his voice. "Well,"
he added more cheerfully, "I've heard our mates got level with
them later. That is so, sir, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they all went to the bottom."</p>

<p>"We've seen nothing of them this side. Just as well, maybe. We
don't forget nothing."</p>

<p>"But you must," said Mailey. "That's what is the matter with
you. That is why the Chinese control brought you through. We are
here to teach you. Carry our message to your mates."</p>

<p>"Bless your heart, sir, they are all here behind me."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I tell you and them that the time for hard
thoughts and worldly strife is over. Your faces are to be turned
forward, not back. Leave this earth which still holds you by the
ties of thought and let all your desire be to make yourself
unselfish and worthy of a higher, more peaceful, more beautiful
life. Can you understand?"</p>

<p>"I hear you, sir. So do they. We want steering, sir, for,
indeed, we've had wrong instructions, and we never expected to
find ourselves cast away like this. We had heard of heaven and we
had heard of hell, but this don't seem to fit in with either. But
this Chinese gent says time is up, and we can report again next
week. I thank you, sir, for self and company. I'll come
again."</p>

<p>There was silence.</p>

<p>"What an incredible conversation!" gasped Malone.</p>

<p>"If I were to put down that man's sailor talk and slang as
emanating from a world of spirits, what would the public
say?"</p>

<p>Mailey shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Does it matter what the public says? I started as a fairly
sensitive person, and now a tank takes as much notice of small
shot as I do of newspaper attacks. They honestly don't even
interest me. Let us just stick fast to truth as near as we can
get it, and leave all else to find its own level."</p>

<p>"I don't pretend to know much of these things," said Roxton,
"but what strikes me most is that these folk are very decent
ordinary people. What? Why should they be wanderin' about in the
dark, and hauled up here by this Chinaman when they've done no
partic'lar harm in life?"</p>

<p>"It is the strong earth tie and the absence of any spiritual
nexus in each case," Mailey explained. "Here is a clergyman with
his mind entangled with formulas and ritual. Here is a
materialist who has deliberately attuned himself to matter. Here
is a seaman brooding over revengeful thoughts. They are there by
the million million."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Malone.</p>

<p>"Here," Mailey answered. "Actually on the surface of the
earth. Well, you saw it for yourself, I understand, when you went
down to Dorsetshire. That was on the surface, was it not? That
was a very gross case, and that made it more visible and obvious,
but it did not change the general law. I believe that the whole
globe is infested with the earth-bound, and that when a great
cleansing comes, as is prophesied, it will be for their benefit
as much as for that of the living."</p>

<p>Malone thought of the strange visionary Miromar and his speech
at the Spiritualistic Church on the first night of his quest.</p>

<p>"Do you, then, believe in some impending event?" he asked.</p>

<p>Mailey smiled. "That is rather a large subject to open up," he
said. "I believe&mdash;But here is Mr. Chang again!"</p>

<p>The control joined in the conversation.</p>

<p>"I heard you. I sit and listen," said he. "You speak now of
what is to come. Let it be! Let it be! The Time is not yet. You
will be told when it is good that you know. Remember this. All is
best. Whatever come all is best. God makes no mistakes. Now
others here who wish your help, I leave you."</p>

<p>Several spirits came through in quick succession. One was an
architect who said that he had lived at Bristol. He had not been
an evil man, but had simply banished all thoughts of the future.
Now he was in the dark and needed guidance. Another had lived in
Birmingham. He was an educated man but a materialist. He refused
to accept the assurances of Mailey, and was by no means convinced
that he was really dead. Then came a very noisy and violent man
of a crudely-religious and narrow, intolerant type, who spoke
repeatedly of "the blood ".</p>

<p>"What is this ribald nonsense?" he asked several times.</p>

<p>"It is not nonsense. We are here to help," said Mailey.</p>

<p>"Who wants to be helped by the devil?"</p>

<p>"Is it likely that the devil would wish to help souls in
trouble?"</p>

<p>"It is part of his deceit. I tell you it is of the devil! Be
warned! I will take no further part in it."</p>

<p>The placid, whimsical Chinaman was back like a flash.</p>

<p>"Good man. Foolish man," he repeated once more. "Plenty time.
He learn better some day. Now I bring bad case&mdash;very bad
case. Ow!"</p>

<p>He reclined his head in the cushion and did not raise it as
the voice, a feminine voice, broke out:</p>

<p>"Janet! Janet!"</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"Janet, I say! Where is the morning tea? Janet! This is
intolerable! I have called you again and again I Janet!" The
figure sat up, blinking and rubbing his eyes.</p>

<p>"What is this?" cried the voice. "Who are you? What right have
you here? Are you aware that this is my house?"</p>

<p>"No, friend, this is my house."</p>

<p>"Your house! How can it be your house when this is my bedroom?
Go away this moment!"</p>

<p>"No, friend. You do not understand your position."</p>

<p>"I will have you put out. What insolence! Janet! Janet! Will
no one look after me this morning?"</p>

<p>"Look round you, lady. Is this your bedroom?"</p>

<p>Terbane looked round with a wild stare.</p>

<p>"It is a room I never saw in my life. Where am I? What is the
meaning of it? You look like a kind lady. Tell me, for God's
sake, what is the meaning of it? Oh, I am so terrified, so
terrified! Where are John and Janet?"</p>

<p>"What do you last remember?"</p>

<p>"I remember speaking severely to Janet. She is my maid, you
know. She has become so very careless. Yes, I was very angry with
her. I was so angry that I was ill. I went to bed feeling very
ill. They told me that I should not get excited. How can one help
getting excited? Yes, I remember being breathless. That was after
the light was out. I tried to call Janet. But why should I be in
another room?"</p>

<p>"You passed over in the night."</p>

<p>"Passed over? Do you mean I died?"</p>

<p>"Yes, lady, you died."</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Then there came a shrill scream.
"No, no, no! It is a dream! A nightmare! Wake me! Wake me! How
can I be dead? I was not ready to die? I never thought of such a
thing. If I am dead, why am I not in heaven or hell? What is this
room? This room is real room."</p>

<p>"Yes, lady, you have been brought here and allowed to use this
man's body."</p>

<p>"A man?" She convulsively felt the coat and passed her hand
over the face. "Yes, it is a man. Oh, I am dead! I am dead! What
shall I do?"</p>

<p>"You are here that we may explain to you. You have been, I
judge, a worldly woman&mdash;a society woman. You have lived
always for material things."</p>

<p>"I went to church. I was at St. Saviour's every Sunday."</p>

<p>"That is nothing. It is the inner daily life that counts. You
were material. Now you are held down to the world. When you leave
this man's body you will be in your own body once more and in
your old surroundings. But no one will see you. You will remain
there unable to show yourself. Your body of flesh will be buried.
You will still persist, the same as ever."</p>

<p>"What am I to do? Oh, what can I do?"</p>

<p>"You will take what comes in a good spirit and understand that
it is for your cleansing. We only clear ourselves of matter by
suffering. All will be well. We will pray for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, do! I need it so! Oh my God!..." The voice trailed
away.</p>

<p>"Bad case," said the Chinaman, sitting up. "Selfish woman! Bad
woman! Live for pleasure. Hard on those around her. She have much
to suffer. But you put her feet on the path. Now my medium tired.
Plenty waiting, but no more to-day."</p>

<p>"Have we done good, Chang?"</p>

<p>"Plenty good. Plenty good."</p>

<p>"Where are all these people, Chang?"</p>

<p>"I tell you before."</p>

<p>"Yes but I want these gentlemen to hear."</p>

<p>"Seven spheres round the world, heaviest below, lightest
above. First sphere is on the earth. These people belong to that
sphere. Each sphere is separate from the other. Therefore it is
easier for you to speak with these people than for those in any
other sphere."</p>

<p>"And easier for them to speak to us?"</p>

<p>"Yes. That why you should be plenty careful when you do not
know to whom you talk. Try the spirits."</p>

<p>"What sphere do you belong to, Chang?"</p>

<p>"I come from Number Four sphere."</p>

<p>"Which is the first really happy sphere?"</p>

<p>"Number Three. Summerland. Bible book called it the third
heaven. Plenty sense in Bible book, but people do not
understand."</p>

<p>And the seventh heaven?"</p>

<p>"Ah! That is where the Christs are. All come there at
last&mdash;you, me, everybody."</p>

<p>"And after that?"</p>

<p>"Too much question, Mr. Mailey. Poor old Chang not know so
much as that. Now good-bye! God bless you! I go."</p>

<p>It was the end of the sitting of the rescue circle. A few
minutes later Terbane was sitting up smiling and alert, but with
no apparent recollection of anything which had occurred. He was
pressed for time and lived afar, so that he had to make his
departure, unpaid save by the blessing of those who he had
helped. Modest little unvenal man, where will he stand when we
all find our real places in the order of creation upon the
further side?</p>

<p>The circle did not break up at once. The visitors wanted to
talk, and the Maileys to listen.</p>

<p>"What I mean," said Roxton, "it's doosed interestin' and all
that, but there is a sort of variety-show element in it. What!
difficult to be sure it's really real, if you take what I
mean."</p>

<p>"That is what I feel also," said Malone. "Of course on its
face value it is simply unspeakable. It is a thing so great that
all ordinary happenings become commonplace. That I grant. But the
human mind is very strange. I've read that case Moreton Prince
examined, and Miss Beauchamp and the rest; also the results of
Charcot, the great Nancy hypnotic school. They could turn a man
into anything. The mind seems to be like a rope which can be
unravelled into its various threads. Then each thread is a
different personality which may take dramatic form, and act and
speak as such. That man is honest, and he could not normally
produce these effects. But how do we know that he is not self-
hypnotized, and that under those conditions one strand of him
becomes Mr. Chang and another becomes a sailor and another a
society lady, and so forth?"</p>

<p>Mailey laughed. "Every man his own Cinquevalli" said he, "but
it is a rational objection and has to be met."</p>

<p>"We have traced some of the cases," said Mrs. Mailey. "There
is not a doubt of it&mdash;names, addresses, everything."</p>

<p>"Well, then, we have to consider the question of Terbane's
normal knowledge. How can you possibly know what he has learned?
I should think a railway-porter is particularly able to pick up
such information."</p>

<p>"You have seen one sitting," Mailey answered. "If you had been
present at as many as we and noted the cumulative effect of the
evidence you would not be sceptical."</p>

<p>"That is very possible," Malone answered. "And I daresay my
doubts are very annoying to you. And yet one is bound to be
brutally honest in a case like this. Anyhow, whatever the
ultimate cause, I have seldom spent so thrilling an hour.
Heavens! If it only is true, and if you had a thousand circles
instead of one, what regeneration would result?"</p>

<p>"That will come," said Mailey in his patient, determined
fashion. "We shall live to see it. I am sorry the thing has not
forced conviction upon you. However, you must come again."</p>

<p>But it so chanced that a further experience became
unnecessary. Conviction came in a full flood and in a strange
fashion that very evening. Malone had hardly got back to the
office, and was seated at his desk drawing up some sort of
account from his notes of all that had happened in the afternoon,
when Mailey burst into the room, his yellow beard bristling with
excitement. He was waving an <em>Evening News</em> in his hand.
Without a word he seated himself beside Malone and turned the
paper over. Then he began to read:</p>
<br>

<p class="headline">ACCIDENT IN THE CITY.</p>

<p class="quote">This afternoon shortly after five o'clock, an
old house, said to date from the fifteenth century, suddenly
collapsed. It was situated between Lesser Colman Street and
Elliot Square, and next door to the Veterinary Society's
Headquarters. Some preliminary cracking warned the occupants and
most of them had time to escape. Three of them, however, James
Beale William Moorson, and a woman whose name has not been
ascertained, were caught by the falling rubbish. Two of these
seem to have perished at once, but the third, James Beale, was
pinned down by a large beam and loudly demanded help. A saw was
brought, and one of the occupants of the house, Samuel Hawkin,
showed great gallantry in an attempt to free the unfortunate man.
Whilst he was sawing the beam, however, a fire broke out among
the debris around him, and though he persevered most manfully,
and continued until he was himself badly scorched, it was
impossible for him to save Beale, who probably died from
suffocation. Hawkin was removed to the London Hospital, and it is
reported to-night that he is in no immediate danger.</p>

<p><br>
"That's that!" said Mailey, folding up the paper. "Now, Mr.
Thomas Didymus, I leave you to your conclusions," and the
enthusiast vanished out of the office as precipitately as he had
entered.</p>

<p class="footnote">[For the incidents recorded in this chapter <em>vide</em> Appendix.]</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a> XI.&mdash; WHERE SILAS LINDEN
COMES INTO HIS OWN</h2>

<p class="first">SILAS LINDEN, prize-fighter and fake-medium, had
had some good days in his life&mdash;days crowded with incidents
for good or evil. There was the time when he had backed Rosalind
at 100 to 1 in the Oaks and had spent twenty-four hours of brutal
debauchery on the strength of it. There was the day also when his
favourite right uppercut had connected in most accurate and
rhythmical fashion with the protruded chin of Bull Wardell of
Whitechapel, whereby Silas put himself in the way of a Lonsdale
Belt and a try for the championship. But never in all his varied
career had he such a day as this supreme one, so it is worth our
while to follow him to the end of it. Fanatical believers have
urged that it is dangerous to cross the path of spiritual things
when the heart is not clean. Silas Linden's name might be added
to their list of examples, but his cup of sin was full and
overflowing before the judgment fell.</p>

<p>He emerged from the room of Algernon Mailey with every reason
to know that Lord Roxton's grip was as muscular as ever. In the
excitement of the struggle he had hardly realized his injuries,
but now he stood outside the door with his hand to his bruised
throat and a hoarse stream of oaths pouring through it. His
breast was aching also where Malone had planted his knee, and
even the successful blow which had struck Mailey down had brought
retribution, or it had jarred that injured hand of which he had
complained to his brother. Altogether, if Silas Linden was in a
most cursed temper, there was a very good reason for his
mood.</p>

<p>"I'll get you one at a time," he growled, looking back with
his angry pigs' eyes at the outer door of the flats. "You wait my
lads, and see!" Then with sudden purpose he swung off down the
street.</p>

<p>It was to the Bardsley Square Police Station that he made his
way, and he found the jovial, rubicund, black-moustached
Inspector Murphy seated at his desk.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want?" asked the inspector in no very
friendly voice.</p>

<p>"I hear you got that medium right and proper."</p>

<p>"Yes, we did. I learn he was your brother."</p>

<p>"That's neither here not there. I don't hold with such things
in any man. But you got your conviction. What is there for me in
it?"</p>

<p>"Not a shilling."</p>

<p>"What? Wasn't it I that gave the information? Where would you
have been if I had not given you the office?"</p>

<p>"If there had been a fine we might have allowed you something
We would have got something, too. Mr. Melrose sent him to gaol.
There is nothing for anybody."</p>

<p>"So say you. I'm damned sure you and those two women got
something out of it. Why the hell should I give away my own
brother for the sake of the likes of you? You'll find your own
bird next time."</p>

<p>Murphy was a choleric man with a sense of his own importance.
He was not to be bearded thus in his own seat of office. He rose
with a very red face.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, Silas Linden, I could find my own bird
and never move out of this room. You had best get out of this
quick, or you may chance to stay here longer than you like. We've
had complaints of your treatment of those two children of yours,
and the children's protection folk are taking an interest. Look
out that we don't take an interest, too."</p>

<p>Silas Linden flung out of the room with his temper hotter than
ever, and a couple of rum-and-waters on his way home did not help
to appease him. On the contrary, he had always been a man who
grew more dangerous in his cups. There were many of his trade who
refused to drink with him.</p>

<p>Silas lived in one of a row of small brick houses named
Bolton's Court, lying at the back of Tottenham Court Road. His
was the end house of a cul-de-sac, with the side wall of a huge
brewery beyond. These dwellings were very small, which was
probably the reason why the inhabitants, both adults and
children, spent most of their time in the street. Several of the
elders were out now, and as Silas passed under the solitary lamp-
post, they scowled at his thick-set figure, for though the
morality of Bolton's Court was of no high order, it was none the
less graduated and Silas was at zero. A tall Jewish woman,
Rebecca Levi, thin, aquiline and fierce-eyed, lived next to the
prizefighter. She was standing at her door now, with a child
holding her apron.</p>

<p>"Mr. Linden," she said as he passed, "them children of yours
want more care than they get. Little Margery was in here to-day.
That child don't get enough to eat."</p>

<p>"You mind your own business, curse you!" growled Silas. "I've
told you before now not to push that long, sheeny beak of yours
into my affairs. If you was a man I'd know better how to speak to
you."</p>

<p>"If I was a man maybe you wouldn't dare to speak to me so. I
say it's a shame, Silas Linden, the way them children is treated.
If it's a police-court case, I'll know what to say."</p>

<p>"Oh, go to hell!" said Silas, and kicked open his own
unlatched door. A big, frowsy woman with a shock of dyed hair and
some remains of a florid beauty, now long over-ripe, looked out
from the sitting-room door.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, is it?" said she.</p>

<p>"Who did you think it was? The Dook of Wellington?"</p>

<p>"I thought it was a mad bullock maybe got strayin' down the
lane, and buttin' down our door."</p>

<p>"Funny, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"Maybe I am, but I hain't got much to be funny about. Not a
shilling in the 'ouse, nor so much as a pint o' beer, and these
damned children of yours for ever upsettin' me."</p>

<p>"What have they been a-doin' of?" asked Silas with a scowl.
When this worthy pair could get no change out of each other, they
usually united their forces against the children. He had entered
the sitting-room and flung himself down in the wooden
armchair.</p>

<p>"They've been seein' Number One again."</p>

<p>"How d'ye know that?"</p>

<p>"I 'eard 'im say somethin' to 'er about it. 'Mother was
there', 'e says. Then afterwards 'e 'ad one 'o them sleepy
fits."</p>

<p>"It's in the family."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," retorted the woman. "If you 'adn't sleepy fits
you'd get some work to do, like other men."</p>

<p>"Oh, shut it, woman! What I mean is, that my brother Tom gets
them fits, and this lad o' mine is said to be the livin' image of
his uncle. So he had a trance, had he? What did you do?"</p>

<p>The woman gave an evil grin.</p>

<p>"I did what you did."</p>

<p>"What, the sealin'-wax again?"</p>

<p>"Not much of it. Just enough to wake 'im. It's the only way to
break 'im of it."</p>

<p>Silas shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"'Ave a care, my lass! There is talk of the p'lice, and if
they see those burns, you and I may be in the dock together."</p>

<p>"Silas Linden, you are a fool! Can't a parent c'rect 'is own
child?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but it ain't your own child, and stepmothers has a bad
name, see? There's that Jew woman next door. She saw you when you
took the clothes' rope to little Margery last washin'-day. She
spoke to me about it and again to-day about the food."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with the food? The greedy little bastards!
They had a 'unch of bread each when I 'ad my dinner. A bit of
real starvin' would do them no 'arm, and I would 'ave less
sauce."</p>

<p>"What, has Willie sauced you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, when 'e woke up."</p>

<p>"After you'd dropped the hot sealin'-wax on him?"</p>

<p>"Well, I did it for 'is good, didn't I? It was to cure 'im of
a bad 'abit."</p>

<p>"Wot did he say?"</p>

<p>"Cursed me good and proper, 'e did. All about his mother
&mdash;wot 'is mother would do to me. I'm dam' well sick of 'is
mother!"</p>

<p>"Don't say too much about Amy. She was a good woman."</p>

<p>"So you say now, Silas Linden, but by all accounts you 'ad a
queer way of showin' it when she was alive."</p>

<p>"Hold your jaw, woman! I've had enough to vex me to-day
without you startin' your tantrums. You're jealous of the grave.
That's wot's the matter with you."</p>

<p>"And her brats can insult me as they like&mdash;me that 'as
cared for you these five years."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't say that. If he insulted you, it's up to me to
deal with him. Where's that strap? Go, fetch him in!"</p>

<p>The woman came across and kissed him.</p>

<p>"I've only you, Silas."</p>

<p>"Oh hell! don't muck me about. I'm not in the mood. Go and
fetch Willie in. You can bring Margery also. It takes the sauce
out of her also, for I think she feels it more than he does."</p>

<p>The woman left the room but was back, in a moment.</p>

<p>"'E's off again!" said she. "It fair gets on my nerves to see
him. Come 'ere, Silas! 'Ave a look!"</p>

<p>They went together into the back kitchen. A small fire was
smouldering in the grate. Beside it, huddled up in a chair, sat a
fair-haired boy of ten. His delicate face was upturned to the
ceiling. His eyes were half-closed, and only the whites visible.
There was a look of great peace upon his thin, spiritual
features. In the corner a poor little cowed mite of a girl, a
year or two younger, was gazing with sad, frightened eyes at her
brother.</p>

<p>"Looks awful, don't 'e?" said the woman. "Don't seem to belong
to this world. I wish to God 'e'd make a move for the other. 'E
don't do much good 'ere."</p>

<p>"Here, wake up!" cried Silas. "None of your foxin'! Wake up!
D'ye hear?" He shook him roughly by the shoulder, but the boy
still slumbered on. The backs of his hands, which lay upon his
lap, were covered with bright scarlet blotches.</p>

<p>"My word, you've dropped enough hot wax on him. D'you mean to
tell me, Sarah, it took all that to wake him?"</p>

<p>"Maybe I dropped one or two extra for luck. 'E does aggravate
me so that I can 'ardly 'old myself. But you wouldn't believe 'ow
little 'e can feel when 'e's like that. You can 'owl in 'is ear.
&mdash;It's all lost on 'im. See 'ere!"</p>

<p>She caught the lad by the hair and shook him violently. He
groaned and shivered. Then he sank back into his serene
trance.</p>

<p>"Say!" cried Silas, stroking his stubbled chin as he looked
thoughtfully at his son, "I think there is money in this if it is
handled to rights. Wot about a turn on the halls, eh? 'The Boy
Wonder or How is it Done?' There's a name for the bills. Then
folk know his uncle's name, so they will be able to take him on
trust."</p>

<p>"I thought you was going into the business yourself."</p>

<p>"That's a wash-out," snarled Silas. "Don't you talk of it.
It's finished."</p>

<p>"Been caught out already?"</p>

<p>"I tell you not to talk about it, Woman!" the man shouted.
"I'm just in the mood to give you the hidin' of your life, so
don't you get my goat' or you'll be sorry." He stepped across and
pinched the boy's arm with all his force. "By Cripes, he's a
wonder! Let us see how far it will go."</p>

<p>He turned to the sinking fire and with the tongs he picked out
a half-red ember. This he placed on the boy's head. There was a
smell of burning hair, then of roasting flesh, and suddenly, with
a scream of pain, the boy came back to his senses.</p>

<p>"Mother! Mother!" he cried. The girl in the corner took up the
cry. They were like two lambs bleating together.</p>

<p>"Damn your mother!" cried the woman, shaking Margery by the
collar of her frail black dress. "Stop squallin', you little
stinker!" She struck the child with her open hand across the
face. Little Willie ran at her and kicked her shins until a blow
from Silas knocked him into the corner. The brute picked up a
stick and lashed the two cowering children, while they screamed
for mercy, and tried to cover their little bodies from the cruel
blows.</p>

<p>"You stop that!" cried a voice in the passage.</p>

<p>"It's that blasted Jewess!" said the woman. She went to the
kitchen door. "What the 'ell are you doing in our 'ouse? 'Op it,
quick, or it will be the worse for you!"</p>

<p>"If I hear them children cry out once more, I'm off far the
police."</p>

<p>"Get out of it! 'Op it, I tell you!" The frowsy stepmother
bore down in full sail, but the lean, lank Jewess stood her
ground. Next instant they met. Mrs. Silas Linden screamed, and
staggered back with blood running down her face where four nails
had left as many red furrows. Silas' with an oath, pushed his
wife out of the way, seized the intruder round the waist, and
slung her bodily through the door. She lay in the roadway with
her long gaunt limbs sprawling about like some half-slain fowl.
Without rising, she shook her clenched hands in the air and
screamed curses at Silas, who slammed the door and left her,
while neighbours ran from all sides to hear particulars of the
fray. Mrs. Linden, staring through the front blind, saw with some
relief that her enemy was able to rise and to limp back to her
own door, whence she could be heard delivering a long shrill
harangue as to her wrongs. The wrongs of a Jew are not lightly
forgotten, for the race can both love and hate.</p>

<p>"She's all right, Silas. I thought maybe you 'ad killed
'er."</p>

<p>"It's what she wants, the damned canting sheeny. It's bad
enough to have her in the street without her daring to set foot
inside my door. I'll cut the hide off that young Willie. He's the
cause of it all. Where is he?"</p>

<p>"They ran up to their room. I heard them lock the door."</p>

<p>"A lot of good that will do them."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't touch 'em now, Silas. The neighbours is all up and
about and we needn't ask for trouble."</p>

<p>"You're right!" he grumbled. "It will keep till I come
back."</p>

<p>"Where are you goin'?"</p>

<p>"Down to the 'Admiral Vernon'. There's a chance of a job as
sparrin' partner to Long Davis. He goes into training on Monday
and needs a man of my weight."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll expect you when I see you. I get too much of that
pub of yours. I know what the 'Admiral Vernon' means."</p>

<p>"It means the only place in God's earth where I get any peace
or rest" said Silas.</p>

<p>"A fat lot I get&mdash;or ever 'ave 'ad since I married
you."</p>

<p>"That's right. Grouse away!" he growled. "If grousin' made a
man happy, you'd be the champion."</p>

<p>He picked up his hat and slouched off down the street, his
heavy tread resounding upon the great wooden flap which covered
the cellars of the brewery.</p>

<p>Up in a dingy attic two little figures were seated on the side
of a wretched straw-stuffed bed, their arms enlacing each other,
their cheeks touching, their tears mingling. They had to cry in
silence, for any sound might remind the ogre downstairs of their
existence. Now and again one would break into an uncontrollable
sob, and the other would whisper, "Hush! Hush! Oh hush!" Then
suddenly they heard the slam of the outer door and that heavy
tread booming over the wooden flap. They squeezed each other in
their joy. Perhaps when he came back he might kill them, but for
a few short hours at least they were safe from him. As to the
woman, she was spiteful and vicious, but she did not seem so
deadly as the man. In a dim way they felt that he had hunted
their mother into her grave and might do as much for them.</p>

<p>The room was dark save for the light which came through the
single dirty window. It cast a bar across the floor, but all
round was black shadow. Suddenly the little boy stiffened,
clasped his sister with a tighter grip, and stared rigidly into
the darkness.</p>

<p>"She's coming!" he muttered. "She's coming!" Little Margery
clung to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Willie, is it mother?"</p>

<p>"It is a light&mdash;a beautiful yellow light. Can you not see
it, Margery?"</p>

<p>But the little girl, like all the world, was without vision.
To her all was darkness.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Willie," she whispered, in a solemn voice. She was
not really frightened, for many times before had the dead mother
returned in the watches of the night to comfort her stricken
children.</p>

<p>"Yes. Yes, she is coming now. Oh, mother! Mother!"</p>

<p>"What does she say, Willie?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she is beautiful. She is not crying. She is smiling. It
is like the picture we saw of the angel. She looks so happy.
Dear, dear mother! Now she is speaking. 'It is over', she says.
'It is all over'. She says it again. Now she beckons with her
hand. We are to follow. She has moved to the door."</p>

<p>"Oh, Willie, I dare not."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, she nods her head. She bids us fear nothing Now she
has passed through the door. Come, Margery, come, or we shall
lose her."</p>

<p>The two little mites crept across the room and Willie unlocked
the door. The mother stood at the head of the stair beckoning
them onwards. Step by step they followed her down into an empty
kitchen. The woman seemed to have gone out. All was still in the
house. The phantom still beckoned them on."</p>

<p>"We are to go out."</p>

<p>"Oh, Willie, we have no hats."</p>

<p>"We must follow, Madge. She is smiling and waving."</p>

<p>"Father will kill us for this."</p>

<p>"She shakes her head. She says we are to fear nothing.
Come!"</p>

<p>They threw open the door and were in the street. Down the
deserted court they followed the gleaming gracious presence, and
through a tangle of low streets, and so out into the crowded rush
of Tottenham Court Road. Once or twice amid all that blind
torrent of humanity, some man or woman, blessed with the precious
gift of discernment, would start and stare as if they were aware
of an angel presence and of two little white-faced children who
followed behind, the boy with fixed, absorbed gaze, the girl
glancing ever in terror over her shoulder. Down the long street
they passed, then again amid humbler dwellings, and so at last to
a quiet drab line of brick houses. On the step of one the spirit
had halted.</p>

<p>"We are to knock," said Willie.</p>

<p>"Oh, Willie, what shall we say? We don't know them."</p>

<p>"We are to knock," he repeated, stoutly. Rat-tat!</p>

<p>"It's all right, Madge. She is clapping her hands and
laughing."</p>

<p>So it was that Mrs. Tom Linden, sitting lonely in her misery
and brooding over her martyr in gaol, was summoned suddenly to
the door, and found two little apologetic figures outside it. A
few words, a rush of woman's instinct, and her arms were round
the children. These battered little skiffs, who had started their
life's voyage so sadly, had found a harbour of peace where no
storm should vex them more.</p>

<p>There were some strange happenings in Bolton's Court that
night. Some folk thought they had no relation to each other. One
or two thought they had. The British Law saw nothing and had
nothing to say.</p>

<p>In the second last house, a keen, hawklike face peered from
behind a window-blind into the darkened street. A shaded candle
was behind that fearful face, dark as death, remorseless as the
tomb. Behind Rebecca Levi stood a young man whose features showed
that he sprang from the same Oriental race. For an hour
&mdash;for a second hour&mdash;the woman had sat without a word,
watching, watching. At the entrance to the court there was a
hanging lamp which cast a circle of yellow light. It was on this
pool of radiance that her brooding eyes were fixed.</p>

<p>Then suddenly she saw what she had waited for. She started and
hissed out a word. The young man rushed from the room and into
the street. He vanished through a side door into the brewery.</p>

<p>Drunken Silas Linden was coming home. He was in a gloomy,
sulken state of befuddlement. A sense of injury filled his mind.
He had not gained the billet he sought. His injured hand had been
against him. He had hung about the bar waiting for drinks and had
got some, but not enough. Now he was in a dangerous mood. Woe to
the man, woman or child, who crossed his path! He thought
savagely of the Jewess who lived in that darkened house. He
thought savagely of all his neighbours. They would stand between
him and his children, would they? He would show them. The very
next morning he would take them both out into the street and
strap them within an inch of their lives. That would show them
all what Silas Linden thought of their opinions. Why should he
not do it now? If he were to waken the neighbours up with the
shrieks of his children, it would show them once for all that
they could not defy him with impunity. The idea pleased him. He
stepped more briskly out. He was almost at his door when...</p>

<p>It was never quite clear how it was that the cellar-flap was
not securely fastened that night. The jury were inclined to blame
the brewery, but the coroner pointed out that Linden was a heavy
man, that he might have fallen on it if he were drunk, and that
all reasonable care had been taken. It was an eighteen-foot fall
upon jagged stones, and his back was broken. They did not find
him till next morning, for, curiously enough, his neighbour, the
Jewess, never heard the sound of the accident. The doctor seemed
to think that death had not come quickly. There were horrible
signs that he had lingered. Down in the darkness, vomiting blood
and beer, the man ended his filthy life with a filthy death.</p>

<p>One need not waste words or pity over the woman whom he had
left. Relieved from her terrible mate, she returned to that
music-hall stage from which he, by force of his virility and
bull-like strength, had lured her. She tried to regain her place
with:</p> <br>

<p class="verse">"Hi! Hi! Hi! I'm the dernier cri,<br>

The girl with the cart-wheel hat."</p>

<p><br> which was the ditty which had won her her name. But it
became too painfully evident that she was anything but the
<em>dernier cri</em>, and that she could never get back. Slowly
she sank from big halls to small halls, from small halls to pubs,
and so ever deeper and deeper, sucked into the awful silent
quicksands of life which drew her down and down until that
vacuous painted face and frowsy head were seen no more.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; THERE ARE HEIGHTS
AND THERE ARE DEPTHS</h2>

<p class="first">THE Institut Mtapsychique was an imposing stone
building in the Avenue Wagram with a door like a baronial castle.
Here it was that the three friends presented themselves late in
the evening. A footman showed them into a reception-room where
they were presently welcomed by Dr. Maupuis in person. The famous
authority on psychic science was a short, broad man with a large
head, a clean-shaven face, and an expression in which worldly
wisdom and kindly altruism were blended. His conversation was in
French with Mailey and Roxton, who both spoke the language well,
but he had to fall back upon broken English with Malone, who
could only utter still more broken French in reply. He expressed
his pleasure at their visit, as only a graceful Frenchman can,
said a few words as to the wonderful qualities of Panbek, the
Galician medium, and finally led the way downstairs to the room
in which the experiments were to be conducted. His air of vivid
intelligence and penetrating sagacity had already shown the
strangers how preposterous were those theories which tried to
explain away his wonderful results by the supposition that he was
a man who was the easy victim of impostors.</p>

<p>Descending a winding stair they found themselves in a large
chamber which looked at first glance like a chemical laboratory,
for shelves full of bottles, retorts, test-tubes, scales and
other apparatus lined the walls. It was more elegantly furnished,
however, than a mere workshop, and a large massive oak table
occupied the centre of the room with a fringe of comfortable
chairs. At one end of the room was a large portrait of Professor
Crookes, which was flanked by a second of Lombroso, while between
them was a remarkable picture of one of Eusapia Palladino's
seances. Round the table there was gathered a group of men who
were talking in low tones, too much absorbed in their own
conversation to take much notice of the newcomers.</p>

<p>"Three of these are distinguished visitors like yourselves,"
said Dr. Maupuis. "Two others are my laboratory assistants, Dr.
Sauvage and Dr. Buisson. The others are Parisians of note. The
Press is represented to-day by Mr. Forte, sub-editor of the
<em>Matin</em>. The tall, dark man who looks like a retired
general you probably know...Not? That is Professor Charles
Richet, our honoured doyen, who has shown great courage in this
matter, though he has not quite reached the same conclusions as
you, Monsieur Mailey. But that also may come. You must remember
that we have to show policy, and that the less we mix this with
religion, the less trouble we shall have with the Church, which
is still very powerful in this country. The distinguished-looking
man with the high forehead is the Count de Grammont. The
gentleman with the head of a Jupiter and the white beard is
Flammarion, the astronomer. Now, gentlemen," he added, in a
louder voice, "if you will take your places we shall get to
work."</p>

<p>They sat at random round the long table, the three Britons
keeping together. At one end a large photographic camera was
reared aloft. Two zinc buckets also occupied a prominent position
upon a side table. The door was locked and the key given to
Professor Richet. Dr. Maupuis sat at one end of the table with a
small middle-aged man, moustached, bald-headed and intelligent,
upon his right.</p>

<p>"Some of you have not met Monsieur Panbek," said the doctor.
"Permit me to present him to you. Monsieur Panbek, gentlemen, has
placed his remarkable powers at our disposal for scientific
investigation, and we all owe him a debt of gratitude. He is now
in his forty-seventh year, a man of normal health, of a neuro-
arthritic disposition. Some hyper-excitability of his nervous
system is indicated, and his reflexes arc exaggerated, but his
blood-pressure is normal. The pulse is now at seventy-two, but
rises to one hundred under trance conditions. There are zones of
marked hyper-aesthesia on his limbs. His visual field and
pupillary reaction is normal. I do not know that there is
anything to add."</p>

<p>"I might say," remarked Professor Richet, "that the hyper-
sensibility is moral as well as physical. Panbek is
impressionable and full of emotion, with the temperament of the
poet and all those little weaknesses, if we may call them so,
which the poet pays as a ransom for his gifts. A great medium is
a great artist and is to be judged by the same standards."</p>

<p>"He seems to me, gentlemen, to be preparing you for the
worst," said the medium with a charming smile, while the company
laughed in sympathy.</p>

<p>"We are sitting in the hopes that some remarkable
materializations which we have recently had may be renewed in
such a form that we may get a permanent record of them." Dr.
Maupuis was talking in his dry, unemotional voice. "These
materializations have taken very unexpected forms of late, and I
would beg the company to repress any feelings of fear, however
strange these forms may be, as a calm and judicial atmosphere is
most necessary. We shall now turn out the white light and begin
with the lowest degree of red light until the conditions will
admit of further illumination."</p>

<p>The lamps were controlled from Dr. Maupuis' seat at the table.
For a moment they were plunged in utter darkness. Then a dull red
glow came in the corner, enough to show the dim outlines of the
men round the table. There was no music and no religious
atmosphere of any sort. The company conversed in whispers.</p>

<p>"This is different to your English procedure," said
Malone.</p>

<p>"Very," Mailey answered. "It seems to me that we are wide open
to anything which may come. It's all wrong. They don't realize
the danger."</p>

<p>"What danger can there be?"</p>

<p>"Well, from my point of view, it is like sitting at the edge
of a pond which may have harmless frogs in it, or may have man-
eating crocodiles. You can't tell what may come."</p>

<p>Professor Richet, who spoke excellent English, overheard the
words.</p>

<p>"I know your views, Mr. Mailey," said he. "Don't think that I
treat them lightly. Some things which I have seen make me
appreciate your comparison of the frog and the crocodile. In this
very room I have been conscious of the presence of creatures
which could, if moved to anger, make our experiments seem rather
hazardous. I believe with you that evil people here might bring
an evil reflection into our circle."</p>

<p>"I am glad, sir, that you are moving in our direction," said
Mailey, for like everyone else he regarded Richet as one of the
world's great men.</p>

<p>"Moving, perhaps, and yet I cannot claim to be altogether with
you yet. The latent powers of the human incarnate spirit may be
so wonderful that they may extend to regions which seem at
present to be quite beyond their scope. As an old materialist, I
fight every inch of the ground, though I admit that I have lost
several lines of trenches. My illustrious friend Challenger still
holds his front intact, as I understand."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir" said Malone, "and yet I have some hopes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" cried Maupuis in an eager voice. There was dead
silence. Then there came a sound of uneasy movement with a
strange flapping vibration.</p>

<p>"The bird!" said an awestruck whisper.</p>

<p>There was silence and then once again came the sound of
movement and an impatient flap.</p>

<p>"Have you all ready, Rene?" asked the doctor.</p>

<p>"All is ready."</p>

<p>"Then shoot!"</p>

<p>The flash of the luminant mixture filled the room, while the
shutter of the camera fell. In that sudden glare of light the
visitors had a momentary glimpse of a marvellous sight. The
medium lay with his head upon his hands in apparent
insensibility. Upon his rounded shoulders there was perched a
huge bird of prey&mdash;a large falcon or an eagle. For one
instant the strange picture was stamped upon their retinas even
as it was upon the photographic plate. Then the darkness closed
down again, save for the two red lamps, like the eyes of some
baleful demon lurking in the corner.</p>

<p>"My word!" gasped Malone. "Did you see it?"</p>

<p>"A crocodile out of the pond," said Mailey.</p>

<p>"But harmless," added Professor Richet. "the bird has been
with us several times. He moves his wings, as you have heard, but
otherwise is inert. We may have another and a more dangerous
visitor."</p>

<p>The flash of the light had, of course, dispelled all
ectoplasm. It was necessary to begin again The company may have
sat for a quarter of an hour when Richet touched Mailey's
arm.</p>

<p>"Do you smell anything, Monsieur Mailey?"</p>

<p>Mailey sniffed the air.</p>

<p>"Yes, surely, it reminds me of our London Zoo."</p>

<p>"There is another more ordinary analogy. Have you been in a
warm room with a wet dog?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Mailey. "That is a perfect description. But
where is the dog?"</p>

<p>"It is not a dog. Wait a little! Wait!"</p>

<p>The animal smell became more pronounced. It was overpowering.
Then suddenly Malone became conscious of something moving round
the table. In the dim red light he was aware of a mis-shapen
figure, crouching, ill-formed, with some resemblance to man. He
silhouetted it against the dull radiance. It was bulky, broad,
with a bullet-head, a short neck, heavy, clumsy shoulders. It
slouched slowly round the circle. Then it stopped, and a cry of
surprise, not unmixed with fear, came from one of the
sitters.</p>

<p>"Do not be alarmed," said Dr. Maupuis' quiet voice. "It is the
Pithecanthropus. He is harmless." Had it been a cat which had
strayed into the room the scientist could not have discussed it
more calmly.</p>

<p>"It has long claws. It laid them on my neck," cried a
voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. He means it as a caress."</p>

<p>"You may have my share of his caresses!" cried the sitter in a
quavering voice.</p>

<p>"Do not repulse him. It might be serious. He is well disposed.
But he has his feelings, no doubt, like the rest of us."</p>

<p>The creature had resumed its stealthy progress. Now it turned
the end of the table and stood behind the three friends. Its
breath came in quick puffs at the back of their necks. Suddenly
Lord Roxton gave a loud exclamation of disgust.</p>

<p>"Quiet! Quiet!" said Maupuis.</p>

<p>"It's licking my hand!" cried Roxton.</p>

<p>An instant later Malone was aware of a shaggy head extended
between Lord Roxton and himself. With his left hand he could feel
long, coarse hair. It turned towards him, and it needed all his
self-control to hold his hand still when a long soft tongue
caressed it. Then it was gone.</p>

<p>"In heaven's name, what is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We have been asked not to photograph it. Possibly the light
would infuriate it. The command through the medium was definite.
We can only say that it is either an apelike man or a man-like
ape. We have seen it more clearly than to-night. The face is
Simian, but the brow is straight; the arms long, the hands huge,
the body covered with hair."</p>

<p>"Tom Linden gave us something better than that," whispered
Mailey. He spoke low but Richet caught the words.</p>

<p>"All Nature is the field of our study, Mr. Mailey. It is not
for us to choose. Shall we classify the flowers but neglect the
fungi?"</p>

<p>"But you admit it is dangerous."</p>

<p>"The X-rays were dangerous. How many martyrs lost their arms,
joint by joint, before those dangers were realized? And yet it
was necessary. So it is with us. We do not know yet what it is
that we are doing. But if we can indeed show the world that this
Pithecanthropus can come to us from the Invisible, and depart
again as it came, then the knowledge is so tremendous that even
if he tore us to pieces with those formidable claws it would none
the less be our duty to go forward with our experiments."</p>

<p>"Science can be heroic," said Mailey. "Who can deny it? And
yet I have heard these very scientific men tell us that we
imperil our reason when we try to get in touch with spiritual
forces. Gladly would we sacrifice our reason, or our lives, if we
could help mankind. Should we not do as much for spiritual
advance as they for material?"</p>

<p>The lights had been turned up and there was a pause for
relaxation before the great experiment of the evening was
attempted. The men broke into little groups, chatting in hushed
tones over their recent experience. Looking round at the
comfortable room with its up-to-date appliances, the strange bird
and the stealthy monster seemed like dreams. And yet they had
been very real as was shown presently by the photographer, who
had been allowed to leave and now rushed excitedly from the
adjacent dark room waving the plate which he had just developed
and fixed. He held it up against the light, and there, sure
enough, was the bald head of the medium sunk between his hands,
and crouching closely over his shoulders the outline of that
ominous figure. Dr. Maupuis rubbed his little fat hands with
glee. Like all pioneers he had endured much persecution from the
Parisian Press, and every fresh phenomenon was another weapon for
his own defence.</p>

<p><em>"Nous marchons! Hein! Nous marchons!"</em> he kept on
repeating, while Richet, lost in thought, answered
mechanically:</p>

<p><em>"Oui, mon ami, vous marchez!"</em></p>

<p>The little Galician was sitting nibbling a biscuit with a
glass of red wine before him. Malone went round to him and found
that he had been in America and could talk a little English.</p>

<p>"Are you tired? Does it exhaust you?"</p>

<p>"In moderation, no. Two sittings a week. Behold my allowance.
The doctor will allow no more."</p>

<p>"Do you remember anything?"</p>

<p>"It comes to me like dreams. A little here&mdash;a little
there."</p>

<p>"Has the power always been with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, ever since a child. And my father, and my uncle.
Their talk was of visions. For me, I would go and sit in the
woods and strange animals would come round me. It did me such a
surprise when I found that the other children could not see
them."</p>

<p><em>"Est ce que vous tes prtes?"</em> asked Dr. Maupuis.</p>

<p><em>"Parfaitment,"</em> answered the medium, brushing away the
crumbs. The doctor lit a spirit-lamp under one of the zinc
buckets.</p>

<p>"We are about to co-operate in an experiment, gentlemen, which
should, once and for all, convince the world as to the existence
of these ectoplasmic forms. Their nature may be disputed, but
their objectivity will be beyond doubt from now onwards unless my
plans miscarry. I would first explain these two buckets to you.
This one, which I am warming, contains paraffin, which is now in
process of liquefaction. This other contains water. Those who
have not been present before must understand that Panbek's
phenomena occur usually in the same order, and that at this stage
of the evening we may expect the apparition of the old man. To-
night we lie in wait for the old man, and we shall, I hope,
immortalize him in the history of psychic research. I resume my
seat, and I switch on the red light, Number Three, which allows
of greater visibility."</p>

<p>The circle was now quite visible. The medium's head had fallen
forward and his deep snoring showed that he was already in
trance. Every face was turned towards him, for the wonderful
process of materialization was going on before their very eyes.
At first it was a swirl of light, steam-like vapour which circled
round his head. Then there was a waving, as of white diaphanous
drapery, behind him. It thickened. It coalesced. It hardened in
outline and took definite shape. There was a head. There were
shoulders. Arms grew out from them. Yes, there could not be a
doubt of it&mdash;there was a man, an old man, standing behind
the chair. He moved his head slowly from side lo side. He seemed
to be peering in indecision towards the company. One could
imagine that he was asking himself, "Where am I, and what am I
here for?"</p>

<p>"He does not speak, but he hears and has intelligence," said
Dr. Maupuis, glancing over his shoulder at the apparition. "We
are here, sir, in the hope that you will aid us in a very
important experiment. May we count upon your co-operation?"</p>

<p>The figure bowed his head in assent.</p>

<p>"We thank you. When you have attained your full power you
will, no doubt, move away from the medium." The figure again
bowed, but remained motionless. It seemed to Malone that it was
growing denser every moment. He caught glimpses of the face. It
was certainly an old man, heavy-faced, long-nosed, with a
curiously projecting lower lip. Suddenly with a brusque movement
it stood clear from Panbeck and stepped out into the room.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," said Maupuis in his precise fashion. "You will
perceive the zinc bucket upon the left. I would beg you to have
the kindness to approach it and to plunge your right hand into
it."</p>

<p>The figure moved across. He seemed interested in the buckets,
for he examined them with some attention. Then he dipped one of
his hands into that which the doctor had indicated.</p>

<p>"Excellent!" cried Maupuis, his voice shrill with excitement.
"Now, sir, might I ask you to have the kindness to dip the same
hand into the cold water of the other bucket."</p>

<p>The form did so.</p>

<p>"Now, sir, you would bring our experiment to complete success
if you would lay your hand upon the table, and while it is
resting there you would yourself dematerialize and return into
the medium."</p>

<p>The figure bowed its comprehension and assent. Then it slowly
advanced towards the table, stooped over it, extended its hand
&mdash;and vanished. The heavy breathing of the medium ceased and
he moved uneasily as if about to wake. Maupuis turned on the
white light, and threw up his hands with a loud cry of wonder and
joy which was echoed by the company.</p>

<p>On the shining wooden surface of the table there lay a
delicate yellow-pink glove of paraffin, broad at the knuckles,
thin at the wrist, two of the fingers bent down to the palm.
Maupuis was beside himself with delight. He broke off a small bit
of the wax from the wrist and handed it to an assistant, who
hurried from the room.</p>

<p>"It is final!" he cried. "What can they say now? Gentlemen, I
appeal to you. You have seen what occurred. Clan any of you give
any rational explanation of that paraffin mould, save that it was
the result of dematerialization of the hand within it?"</p>

<p>"I can see no other solution," Richet answered. "But you have
to do with very obstinate and very prejudiced people. If they
cannot deny it, they will probably ignore it."</p>

<p>"The Press is here and the Press represents the public," said
Maupuis. "For the Press Engleesh, Monsieur Malone," he went on in
his broken way. "Is it that you can see any answer?"</p>

<p>"I can see none," Malone answered.</p>

<p>"And you, monsieur?" addressing the representative of the
<em>Matin</em>.</p>

<p>The Frenchman shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"For us who had the privilege of being present it was indeed
convincing," said he, "and yet you will certainly be met with
objections. They will not realize how fragile this thing is. They
will say that the medium brought it on his person and laid it
upon the table."</p>

<p>Maupuis clapped his hands triumphantly. His assistant had just
brought him a slip of paper from the next room.</p>

<p>"Your objection is already answered," he cried, waving the
paper in the air. "I had foreseen it and I had put some
cholesterine among the paraffin in the zinc pail. You may have
observed that I broke off a corner of the mould. It was for
purpose of chemical analysis. This has now been done. It is here
and cholesterine has been detected."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" said the French journalist. "You have closed the
last hole. But what next?"</p>

<p>"What we have done once we can do again," Maupuis answered. "I
will prepare a number of these moulds. In some cases I will have
fists and hands. Then I will have plaster casts made from them. I
will run the plaster inside the mould. It is delicate, but it can
be done. I will have dozens of them so treated, and I will send
them broadcast to every capital in the world that people may see
with their own eyes. Will that not at last convince them of the
reality of our conclusions?"</p>

<p>"Do not hope for too much, my poor friend," said Richet, with
his hand upon the shoulder of the enthusiast. "You have not yet
realized the enormous <em>vis inertiae</em> of the world. But as
you have said, <em>'Vous marchez&mdash;vous marchez
toujours'</em>."</p>

<p>"And our march is regulated," said Mailey. "There is a gradual
release to accommodate it to the receptivity of mankind."</p>

<p>Richet smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Always transcendental, Monsieur Mailey! Always seeing more
than meets the eye and changing science into philosophy! I fear
you are incorrigible. Is your position reasonable?"</p>

<p>"Professor Richet," said Mailey, very earnestly, "I would beg
you to answer the same question. I have a deep respect for your
talents and complete sympathy with your caution, but have you not
come to the dividing of the ways? You are now in the position
that you admit&mdash;you must admit&mdash;that an intelligent
apparition in human form, built up from the substance which you
have yourself named ectoplasm, can walk the room and carry out
instructions while the medium lay senseless under our eyes, and
yet you hesitate to assert that spirit has an independent
existence. Is that reasonable?"</p>

<p>Richet smiled and shook his head. Without answering he turned
and bid farewell to Dr. Maupuis, and to offer him his
congratulations. A few minutes later the company had broken up
and our friends were in a taxi speeding towards their hotel.</p>

<p>Malone was deeply impressed with what he had seen, and he sat
up half the night drawing up a full account of it for the
<em>Central News</em>, with the names of those who had endorsed
the result &mdash;honourable names which no one in the world
could associate with folly or deception.</p>

<p>"Surely, surely, this will be a turning point and an epoch."
So ran his dream. Two days later he opened the great London
dailies one after the other. Columns about football. Columns
about golf. A full page as to the value of shares. A long and
earnest correspondence in <em>The Times</em> about the habits of
the lapwing. Not one word in any of them as to the wonders which
he had seen and reported. Mailey laughed at his dejected
face.</p>

<p>"A mad world, my masters," said he. "A crazy world! But the
end is not yet!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; IN WHICH PROFESSOR
CHALLENGER GOES FORTH TO BATTLE</h2>

<p class="first">PROFESSOR CHALLENGER was in a bad humour, and
when that was so his household were made aware of it. Neither
were the effects of his wrath confined to those around him, for
most of those terrible letters which appeared from time to time
in the Press, flaying and scarifying some unhappy opponent, were
thunderbolt flashes from an offended Jove who sat in sombre
majesty in his study-throne on the heights of a Victoria flat.
Servants would hardly dare to enter the room where, glooming and
glowering, the maned and bearded head looked up from his papers
as a lion from a bone. Only Enid could dare him at such a time,
and even she felt occasionally that sinking of the heart which
the bravest of tamers may experience as he unbars the gate of the
cage. She was not safe from the acridity of his tongue but at
least she need not fear physical violence, which was well within
the possibilities for others.</p>

<p>Sometimes these berserk fits of the famous Professor arose
from material causes. "Hepatic, sir, hepatic!" he would explain
in extenuation after some aggravated assault. But on this
particular occasion he had a very definite cause for discontent.
It was Spiritualism!</p>

<p>He never seemed to get away from the accursed superstition
&mdash;a thing which ran counter to the whole work and philosophy
of his lifetime. He attempted to pooh-pooh it, to laugh at it, to
ignore it with contempt, but the confounded thing would insist
upon obtruding itself once more. On Monday he would write it
finally off his books, and before Saturday he would be up to his
neck in it again. And the thing was so absurd! It seemed to him
that his mind was being drawn from the great pressing material
problems of the Universe in order to waste itself upon Grimm's
fairy tales or the ghosts of a sensational novelist.</p>

<p>Then things grew worse. First Malone, who had in his simple
fashion been an index figure representing the normal clear-headed
human being, had in some way been bedevilled by these people and
had committed himself to their pernicious views. Then Enid, his
wee-lamb, his one real link with humanity, had also been
corrupted. She had agreed with Malone's conclusions. She had even
hunted up a good deal of evidence of her own. In vain he had
himself investigated a case and proved beyond a shadow of a doubt
that the medium was a designing villain who brought messages from
a widow's dead husband in order to get the woman into his power.
It was a clear case and Enid admitted it. But neither she nor
Malone would allow any general application. "There are rogues in
every line of life," they would say. "We must judge every
movement by the best and not by the worst."</p>

<p>All this was bad enough, but worse still was in store. He had
been publicly humiliated by the Spiritualists&mdash;and that by a
man who admitted that he had had no education and would in any
other subject in the world have been seated like a child at the
Professor's feet. And yet in public debate&mdash;but the story
must be told.</p>

<p>Be it known, then, that Challenger, greatly despising all
opposition and with no knowledge of the real strength of the case
to be answered, had, in a fatal moment, actually asserted that he
would descend from Olympus and would meet in debate any
representative whom the other party should select. "I am well
aware," he wrote, "that by such condescension I, like any other
man of science of equal standing, run the risk of giving a
dignity to these absurd and grotesque aberrations of the human
brain which they could otherwise not pretend to claim, but we
must do our duty to the public, and we must occasionally turn
from our serious work and spare a moment in order to sweep away
those ephemeral cobwebs which might collect and become offensive
if they were not dispersed by the broom of Science." Thus, in a
most self-confident fashion, did Goliath go forth to meet his
tiny antagonist, an ex-printer's assistant and now the editor of
what Challenger would describe as an obscure print devoted to
matters of the spirit.</p>

<p>The particulars of the debate are public property, and it is
not necessary to tell in any great detail that painful event. It
will be remembered that the great man of Science went down to the
Queen's Hall accompanied by many rationalist sympathizers who
desired to see the final destruction of the visionaries. A large
number of these poor deluded creatures also attended, hoping
against hope that their champion might not be entirely immolated
upon the altar of outraged Science. Between them the two factions
filled the hall, and glared at each other with as much enmity as
did the Blues and the Greens a thousand years before in the
Hippodrome of Constantinople. There on the left of the platform
were the solid ranks of those hard and unbending rationalists who
look upon the Victorian agnostics as credulous, and refresh their
faith by the periodical perusal of the <em>Literary Gazette</em>
and the <em>Freethinker</em>.</p>

<p>There, too, was Dr. Joseph Baumer, the famous lecturer upon
the absurdities of religion, together with Mr. Edward Mould, who
has insisted so eloquently upon man's claim to ultimate putridity
of the body and extinction of the soul. On the other side
Mailey's yellow beard flamed like an oriflamme. His wife sat on
one side of him and Mervin, the journalist, on the other, while
dense ranks of earnest men and women from the Queen Square
Spiritual Alliance, from the Psychic College, from the Stead
Bureau, and from the outlying churches, assembled in order to
encourage their champion in his hopeless task. The genial faces
of Bolsover, the grocer, with his Hammersmith friends, Terbane,
the railway medium, the Reverend Charles Mason, with his ascetic
features, Tom Linden, now happily released from bondage, Mrs.
Linden, the Crewe circle, Dr. Atkinson, Lord Roxton, Malone, and
many other familiar faces were to be picked out amid that dense
wall of humanity. Between the two parties, solemn and stolid and
fat, sat Judge Gaverson of the King's Bench, who had consented to
preside. It was an interesting and suggestive fact that in this
critical debate at which the very core or vital centre of real
religion was the issue, the organized churches were entirely
aloof and neutral. Drowsy and semi-conscious, they could not
discern that the live intellect of the nation was really holding
an inquisition upon their bodies to determine whether they were
doomed to the extinction towards which they were rapidly
drifting, or whether a resuscitation in other forms was among the
possibilities of the future.</p>

<p>In front, on one side, with his broad-browed disciples behind
him, sat Professor Challenger, portentous and threatening, his
Assyrian beard projected in his most aggressive fashion, a half-
smile upon his lips, and his eyelids drooping insolently over his
intolerant grey eyes. On the corresponding position on the other
side was perched a drab and unpretentious person over whose
humble head Challenger's hat would have descended to the
shoulders. He was pale and apprehensive, glancing across
occasionally in apologetic and deprecating fashion at his leonine
opponent. Yet those who knew James Smith best were the least
alarmed, for they were aware that behind his commonplace and
democratic appearance there lay a knowledge of his subject,
practical and theoretical, such as few living men possessed. The
wise men of the Psychical Research Society are but children in
psychic knowledge when compared with such practising
Spiritualists as James Smith&mdash;men whose whole lives are
spent in various forms of communion with the unseen. Such men
often lose touch with the world in which they dwell and are
useless for its everyday purposes, but the editorship of a live
paper and the administration of a wide-spread, scattered
community had kept Smith's feet solid upon earth, while his
excellent natural faculties, uncorrupted by useless education,
had enabled him to concentrate upon the one field of knowledge
which offers in itself a sufficient scope for the greatest human
intellect. Little as Challenger could appreciate it, the contest
was really one between a brilliant discursive amateur and a
concentrated highly-specialized professional.</p>

<p>It was admitted on all sides that Challenger's opening half-
hour was a magnificent display of oratory and argument. His deep
organ voice&mdash; such a voice as only a man with a fifty-inch
chest can produce&mdash;rose and fell in a perfect cadence which
enchanted his audience. He was born to sway an assembly&mdash;an
obvious leader of mankind. In turn he was descriptive, humorous
and convincing. He pictured the natural growth of animism among
savages cowering under the naked sky, unable to account for the
beat of the rain or the roar of the thunder, and seeing a
benevolent or malicious intelligence behind those operations of
Nature which Science had now classified and explained.</p>

<p>Hence on false premises was built up that belief in spirits or
invisible beings outside ourselves, which by some curious atavism
was re-emerging in modern days among the less educated strata of
mankind. It was the duty of Science to resist retrogressive
tendencies of the sort, and it was a sense of that duty which had
reluctantly drawn him from the privacy of his study to the
publicity of this platform. He rapidly sketched the movement as
depicted by its maligners. It was a most unsavoury story as he
told it, a story of cracking toe joints, of phosphorescent paint,
of muslin ghosts, of a nauseous sordid commission trade betwixt
dead men's bones on one side, and widow's tears upon the other.
These people were the hyenas of the human race who battened upon
the graves. (Cheers from the Rationalists and ironical laughter
from the Spiritualists.) They were not all rogues. ("Thank you,
Professor!" from a stentorian opponent) But the others were fools
(laughter) . Was it exaggeration to call man a fool who believed
that his grandmother could rap out absurd messages with the leg
of a dining-room table? Had any savages descended to so grotesque
a superstition? These people had taken dignity from death and had
brought their own vulgarity into the serene oblivion of the tomb.
It was a hateful business. He was sorry to have to speak so
strongly, but only the knife or the cautery could deal with so
cancerous a growth. Surely man need not trouble himself with
grotesque speculations as to the nature of life beyond the grave.
We had enough to do in this world. Life was a beautiful thing.
The man who appreciated its real duties and beauties would have
sufficient to employ him without dabbling in pseudo sciences
which had their roots in frauds, exposed already a hundred times
and yet finding fresh crowds of foolish devotees whose insane
credulity and irrational prejudice made them impervious to all
argument.</p>

<p>Such is a most bald and crude summary of this powerful opening
argument. The materialists roared their applause; the
Spiritualists looked angry and uneasy, while their spokesman
rose, pale but resolute, to answer the ponderous onslaught.</p>

<p>His voice and appearance had none of those qualities which
made Challenger magnetic, but he was clearly audible and made his
points in a precise fashion like a workman who is familiar with
his tools. He was so polite and so apologetic at first that he
gave the impression of having been cowed. He felt that it was
almost presumptuous upon one who had so little advantage of
education to measure mental swords for an instant with so
renowned an antagonist, one whom he had long revered. It seemed
to him, however, that in the long list of the Professor's
accomplishments&mdash;accomplishments which had made him a
household word throughout the world&mdash;there was one missing,
and unhappily it was just this one upon which he had been tempted
to speak. He had listened to that speech with admiration so far
as its eloquence was concerned, but with surprise, and he might
almost say with contempt, when he analysed the assertions which
were contained in it. It was clear that the Professor had
prepared his case by reading all the anti-Spiritualist literature
which he could lay his hands upon&mdash;a most tainted source of
information&mdash;while neglecting the works of those who spoke
from experience and conviction.</p>

<p>All this talk of cracking joints and other fraudulent tricks
was mid-Victorian in its ignorance, and as to the grandmother
talking through the leg of a table he, the speaker, could not
recognize it as a fair description of Spiritualistic phenomena.
Such comparisons reminded one of the jokes about the dancing
frogs which impeded the recognition of Volta's early electrical
experiments. They were unworthy of Professor Challenger. He must
surely be aware that the fraudulent medium was the worst enemy of
Spiritualism, that he was denounced by name in the psychic
journals whenever he was discovered, and that such exposures were
usually made by the Spiritualists themselves who had spoken of
"human hyenas" as indignantly as his opponent had done. One did
not condemn banks because forgers occasionally used them for
nefarious purposes. It was wasting the time of so chosen an
audience to descend to such a level of argument. Had Professor
Challenger denied the religious implications of Spiritualism
while admitting the phenomena, it might have been harder to
answer him, but in denying everything he had placed himself in an
absolutely impossible position. No doubt Professor Challenger had
read the recent work of Professor Richet, the famous
physiologist. That work had extended over thirty years. Richet
had verified all the phenomena.</p>

<p>Perhaps Professor Challenger would inform the audience what
personal experience he had himself had which gave him the right
to talk of Richet, or Lombroso, or Crookes, as if they were
superstitious savages. Possibly his opponent had conducted
experiments in private of which the world knew nothing. In that
case he should give them to the world. Until he did so it was
unscientific and really indecent to deride men, hardly inferior
in scientific reputation to himself, who actually had done such
experiments and laid them before the public.</p>

<p>As to the self-sufficiency of this world, a successful
Professor with a eupeptic body might take such a view, but if one
found oneself with cancer of the stomach in a London garret, one
might question the doctrine that there was no need to yearn for
any state of being save that in which we found ourselves.</p>

<p>It was a workmanlike effort illustrated with facts, dates and
figures. Though it rose to no height of eloquence it contained
much which needed an answer. And the sad fact emerged that
Challenger was not in a position to answer. He had read up his
own case but had neglected that of his adversary, accepting too
easily the facile and specious presumptions of incompetent
writers who handled a matter which they had not themselves
investigated. Instead of answering, Challenger lost his temper.
The lion began to roar. He tossed his dark mane and his eyes
glowed, while his deep voice reverberated through the hall. Who
were these people who took refuge behind a few honoured but
misguided names? What right had they to expect serious men of
science to suspend their labours in order to waste time in
examining their wild surmises? Some things were self-evident and
did not require proof. The onus of proof lay with those who made
the assertions. If this gentleman, whose name is unfamiliar,
claims that he can raise spirits, let him call one up now before
a sane and unprejudiced audience. If he says that he receives
messages, let him give us the news in advance of the general
agencies. ("It has often been done!" from the Spiritualists.) So
you say, but I deny it. I am too accustomed to your wild
assertions to take them seriously. (Uproar, and Judge Gaverson
upon his feet.) If he claims that he has higher inspiration, let
him solve the Peckham Rye murder. If he is in touch with angelic
beings, let him give us a philosophy which is higher than mortal
mind can evolve. This false show of science, this camouflage of
ignorance, this babble about ectoplasm and other mythical
products of the psychic imagination was mere obscurantism, the
bastard offspring of superstition and darkness. Wherever the
matter was probed one came upon corruption and mental
putrescence. Every medium was a deliberate impostor. ("You are a
liar!" in a woman's voice from the neighbourhood of the Lindens.)
The voices of the dead had uttered nothing but childish twaddle.
The asylums were full of the supporters of the cult and would be
fuller still if everyone had his due.</p>

<p>It was a violent but not an effective speech. Evidently the
great man was rattled. He realized that there was a case to be
met and that he had not provided himself with the material
wherewith to meet it. Therefore he had taken refuge in angry
words and sweeping assertions which can only be safely made when
there is no antagonist present to take advantage of them. The
Spiritualists seemed more amused than angry. The materialists
fidgeted uneasily in their seats. Then James Smith rose for his
last innings. He wore a mischievous smile. There was quiet menace
in his whole bearing.</p>

<p>He must ask, he said, for a more scientific attitude from his
illustrious opponent. It was an extraordinary fact that many
scientific men, when their passions and prejudices were excited,
showed a ludicrous disregard for all their own tenets. Of these
tenets there was none more rigid than that a subject should be
examined before it was condemned. We have seen of late years, in
such matters as wireless or heavier-than-air machines, that the
most unlikely things may come to pass. It is most dangerous to
say a priori that a thing is impossible. Yet this was the error
into which Professor Challenger had fallen. He had used the fame
which he had rightly won in subjects which he had mastered in
order to cast discredit upon a subject which he had not mastered.
The fact that a man was a great physiologist and physicist did
not in itself make him an authority upon psychic science.</p>

<p>It was perfectly clear that Professor Challenger had not read
the standard works upon the subject on which he posed as an
authority. Could he tell the audience what the name of Schrenck
Notzing's medium was? He paused for a reply. Could he then tell
the name of Dr. Crawford's medium? Not? Could he tell them who
had been the subject of Professor Zollner's experiments at
Leipzig? What, still silent? But these were the essential points
of the discussion. He had hesitated to be personal, but the
Professor's robust language called for corresponding frankness
upon his part. Was the Professor aware that this ectoplasm which
he derided had been examined lately by twenty German professors
&mdash;the names were here for reference&mdash;and that all had
testified to its existence? How could Professor Challenger deny
that which these gentlemen asserted? Would he contend that they
also were criminals or fools? The fact was that the Professor had
come to this hall entirely ignorant of the facts and was now
learning them for the first time. He clearly had no perception
that Psychic Science had any laws whatever, or he would not have
formulated such childish requests as that an ectoplasmic figure
should manifest in full light upon this platform when every
student was aware that ectoplasm was soluble in light. As to the
Peckham Rye murder it had never been claimed that the angel world
was an annexe to Scotland Yard. It was mere throwing of dust in
the eyes of the public for a man like Professor
Challenger&mdash;</p>

<p>It was at this moment that the explosion occurred. Challenger
had wriggled in his chair. Challenger had tugged at his beard.
Challenger had glared at the speaker. Now he suddenly sprang to
the side of the chairman's table with the bound of a wounded
lion. That gentleman had been lying back half asleep with his fat
hands clutched across his ample paunch, but at this sudden
apparition he gave a convulsive start which nearly carried him
into the orchestra.</p>

<p>"Sit down, sir! Sit down!" he cried</p>

<p>"I refuse to sit down," roared Challenger. "Sir, I appeal to
you as chairman! Am I here to be insulted? These proceedings are
intolerable. I will stand it no longer. If my private honour is
touched I am justified in taking the matter into my own
hands."</p>

<p>Like many men who override the opinions of others, Challenger
was exceedingly sensitive when anyone took a liberty with his
own. Each successive incisive sentence of his opponent had been
like a barbed <em>bandarillo</em> in the flanks of a foaming
bull. Now, in speechless fury, he was shaking his huge hairy fist
over the chairman's head in the direction of his adversary, whose
derisive smile stimulated him to more furious plunges with which
he butted the fat president along the platform. The assembly had
in an instant become a pandemonium. Half the rationalists were
scandalized, while the other half shouted "Shame! Shame!" as a
sign of sympathy with their champion. The Spiritualists had
broken into derisive shouts, while some rushed forward to protect
their champion from physical assault.</p>

<p>"We must get the old dear out," said Lord Roxton to Malone.
"He'll be had for manslaughter if we don't. What I mean, he's not
responsible&mdash;he'll sock someone and be lagged for it."</p>

<p>The platform had become a seething mob, while the auditorium
was little better. Through the crush Malone and Roxton elbowed
their way until they reached Challenger's side, and partly by
judicious propulsion, partly by artful persuasion, they got him,
still bellowing his grievances, out of the building. There was a
perfunctory vote to the chairman, and the meeting broke up in
riot and confusion. "The whole episode," remarked <em>The
Times</em> next morning, "was a deplorable one, and forcibly
illustrates the danger of public debates where the subjects are
such as to inflame the prejudices of either speakers or audience.
Such terms as 'Microcephalous idiot!' or 'Simian survival!' when
applied by a world-renowned Professor to an opponent, illustrate
the lengths to which such disputants may permit themselves to
go."</p>

<p>Thus by a long interpolation we have got back to the fact that
Professor Challenger was in the worst of humours as he sat with
the above-mentioned copy of <em>The Times</em> in his hand and a
heavy scowl upon his brow. And yet it was that very moment that
the injudicious Malone had chosen in order to ask him the most
intimate question which one man can address to another.</p>

<p>Yet perhaps it is hardly fair to our friend's diplomacy to say
that he had "chosen" the moment. He had really called in order to
see for himself that the man for whom, in spite of his
eccentricities, he had a deep reverence and affection, had not
suffered from the events of the night before. On that point he
was speedily reassured.</p>

<p>"Intolerable!" roared the Professor, in a tone so unchanged
that he might have been at it all night. "You were there
yourself, Malone. In spite of your inexplicable and misguided
sympathy for the fatuous views of these people, you must admit
that the whole conduct of the proceedings was intolerable, and
that my righteous protest was more than justified. It is possible
that when I threw the chairman's table at the President of the
Psychic College I passed the bounds of decorum, but the
provocation had been excessive. You will remember that this Smith
or Brown person&mdash;his name is most immaterial&mdash;dared to
accuse me of ignorance and of throwing dust in the eyes of the
audience."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said Malone, soothingly. "Never mind, Professor.
You got in one or two pretty hard knocks yourself."</p>

<p>Challenger's grim features unbent and he rubbed his hands with
glee.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I fancy that some of my thrusts went home. I
imagine that they will not be forgotten. When I said that the
asylums would be full if every man of them had his due I could
see them wince. They all yelped, I remember, like a kennelful of
puppies. It was their preposterous claim that I should read their
hare-brained literature which caused me to display some little
heat. But I hope, my boy, that you have called round this morning
in order to tell me that what I said last night has had some
effect upon your own mind, and that you have reconsidered these
views which are, I confess, a considerable tax upon our
friendship."</p>

<p>Malone took his plunge like a man.</p>

<p>"I had something else in my mind when I came here," said he.
"You must be aware that your daughter Enid and I have been thrown
together a good deal of late. To me, sir, she has become the one
woman in the world, and I shall never be happy until she is my
wife. I am not rich, but a good sub-editorship has been offered
to me and I could well afford to marry. You have known me for
some time and I hope you have nothing against me. I trust,
therefore, that I may count upon your approval in what I am about
to do."</p>

<p>Challenger stroked his beard and his eyelids drooped
dangerously over his eyes.</p>

<p>"My perceptions," said he, "are not so dull that I should have
failed to observe the relations which have been established
between my daughter and yourself. This question however, has
become entangled with the other which we were discussing. You
have both, I fear, imbibed this poisonous fallacy which I am more
and more inclined to devote my life to extirpating. If only on
the ground of eugenics, I could not give my sanction to a union
which was built up on such a foundation, I must ask you,
therefore, for a definite assurance that your views have become
more sane. I shall ask the same from her."</p>

<p>And so Malone suddenly found himself also enrolled among the
noble army of martyrs. It was a hard dilemma, but he faced it
like the man that he was.</p>

<p>"I am sure, sir, that you would not think the better of me if
I allowed my views as to truth, whether they be right or wrong,
to be swayed by material considerations. I cannot change my
opinions even to win Enid. I am sure that she would take the same
view."</p>

<p>"Did you not think I had the better last night?"</p>

<p>"I thought your address was very eloquent."</p>

<p>"Did I not convince you?"</p>

<p>"Not in the face of the evidence of my own senses."</p>

<p>"Any conjuror could deceive your senses."</p>

<p>"I fear, sir, that my mind is made up on this point."</p>

<p>"Then my mind is made up also," roared Challenger, with a
sudden glare. "You will leave this house, sir, and you will
return when you have regained your sanity."</p>

<p>"One moment!" said Malone. "I beg, sir, that you will not be
precipitate. I value your friendship too much to risk the loss of
it if it can, in any way, be avoided. Possibly if I had your
guidance I would better understand these things that puzzle me.
If I should be able to arrange it would you mind being present
personally at one of these demonstrations so that your own
trained powers of observation may throw a light upon the things
that have puzzled me."</p>

<p>Challenger was enormously open to flattery. He plumed and
preened himself now like some great bird.</p>

<p>"If, my dear Malone, I can help you to get this taint
&mdash;what shall we call it?&mdash;<em>microbus
spiritualensis</em> &mdash;out of your system, I am at your
service. I shall be happy to devote a little of my spare time to
exposing those specious fallacies to which you have fallen so
easy a victim. I would not say that you are entirely devoid of
brains, but that your good nature is liable to be imposed upon. I
warn you that I shall be an exacting inquirer and bring to the
investigation those laboratory methods of which it is generally
admitted that I am a master."</p>

<p>"That is what I desire."</p>

<p>"Then you will prepare the occasion and I shall be there. But
meanwhile you will clearly understand that I insist upon a
promise that this connection with my daughter shall go no
further."</p>

<p>Malone hesitated.</p>

<p>"I give my promise for six months," he said at last.</p>

<p>"And what will you do at the end of that time?"</p>

<p>"I will decide when the time comes," Malone answered
diplomatically, and so escaped from a dangerous situation with
more credit than at one time seemed probable.</p>

<p>It chanced that, as he emerged upon the landing, Enid who had
been engaged in her morning's shopping, appeared in the lift.
Malone's easy Irish conscience allowed him to think that the six
months need not start on the instant, so he persuaded Enid to
descend in the lift with him. It was one of those lifts which are
handled by whoever uses them, and on this occasion it so happened
that, in some way best known to Malone, it stuck between the
landing stages, and in spite of several impatient rings it
remained stuck for a good quarter of an hour. When the machinery
resumed its functions, and when Enid was able at last to reach
her home and Malone the street, the lovers had prepared
themselves to wait for six months with every hope of a successful
end to their experiment.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; IN WHICH CHALLENGER
MEETS A STRANGE COLLEAGUE</h2>

<p class="first">PROFESSOR CHALLENGER was not a man who made
friends easily. In order to be his friend you had also to be his
dependant. He did not admit of equals. But as a patron he was
superb. With his Jovian air, his colossal condescension, his
amused smile, his general suggestion of the god descending to the
mortal, he could be quite overpowering in his amiability. But he
needed certain qualities in return. Stupidity disgusted him.
Physical ugliness alienated him. Independence repulsed him. He
coveted the man whom all the world would admire, but who in turn
would admire the superman above him. Such a man was Dr. Ross
Scotton, and for this reason he hat been Challenger's favourite
pupil.</p>

<p>And now he was sick unto death. Dr. Atkinson of St. Mary's who
had already played some minor part in this record, was attending
him, and his reports were increasingly depressing. The illness
was that dread disease disseminated sclerosis, and Challenger was
aware that Atkinson was no alarmist when he said that a cure was
a most remote and unlikely possibility. It seemed a terrible
instance of the unreasonable nature of things that a young man of
science, capable before he reached his prime of two such works as
<em>The Embryology of the Symibathetic Nervous System</em> or
<em>The Fallacy of the Obsonic Index</em>, should be dissolved
into his chemical elements with no personal or spiritual residue
whatever. And yet the Professor shrugged his huge shoulders,
shook his massive head, and accepted the inevitable. Every fresh
message was worse than the last, and, finally, there was an
ominous silence. Challenger went down once to his young friend's
lodging in Gower Street. It was a racking experience, and he did
not repeat it. The muscular cramps which are characteristic of
the complaint were tying the sufferer into knots, and he was
biting his lips to shut down the screams which might have
relieved his agony at the expense of his manhood. He seized his
mentor by the hand as a drowning man seizes a plank.</p>

<p>"Is it really as you have said? Is there no hope beyond the
six months of torture which I see lying before me? Can you with
all your wisdom and knowledge see no spark of light or life in
the dark shadow of eternal dissolution?"</p>

<p>"Face it, my boy, face it!" said Challenger. "Better to look
fact in the face than to console oneself with fancies."</p>

<p>Then the lips parted and the long-pent scream burst forth.
Challenger rose and rushed from the room.</p>

<p>But now an amazing development occurred. It began by the
appearance of Miss Delicia Freeman.</p>

<p>One morning there came a knock at the door of the Victoria
flat. The austere and taciturn Austin looking out at the level of
his eyes perceived nothing at all. On glancing downwards,
however, he was aware of a small lady, whose delicate face and
bright bird-like eyes were turned upwards to his own.</p>

<p>"I want to see the Professor," said she, diving into her
handbag for a card.</p>

<p>"Can't see you," said Austin.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he can," the small lady answered serenely. There was
not a newspaper office, a statesman's sanctum, or a political
chancellory which had ever presented a barrier strong enough to
hold her back where she believed that there was good work to be
done.</p>

<p>"Can't see you," repeated Austin.</p>

<p>"Oh, but really I must, you know," said Miss Freeman, and made
a sudden dive past the butler. With unerring instinct she made
for the door of the sacred study, knocked, and forthwith
entered.</p>

<p>The lion head looked up from behind a desk littered with
papers. The lion eyes glared.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this intrusion?" the lion roared. The
small lady was, however, entirely unabashed. She smiled sweetly
at the glowering face.</p>

<p>"I am so glad to make your acquaintance," she said. "My name
is Delicia Freeman."</p>

<p>"Austin!" shouted the Professor. The butler's impassive face
appeared round the angle of the door. "What is this, Austin. How
did this person get here?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't keep her out," wailed Austin. "Come, miss, we've
had enough of it."</p>

<p>"No, no! You must not be angry&mdash;you really must not,"
said the lady sweetly. "I was told that you were a perfectly
terrible person, but really you are rather a dear."</p>

<p>"Who are you? What do you want? Are you aware that I am one of
the most busy men in London?"</p>

<p>Miss Freeman fished about in her bag once more. She was always
fishing in that bag, extracting sometimes a leaflet on Armenia,
sometimes a pamphlet on Greece, sometimes a note on Zenana
Missions, and sometimes a psychic manifesto. On this occasion it
was a folded bit of writing-paper which emerged.</p>

<p>"From Dr. Ross Scotton," she said. It was hastily folded and
roughly scribbled&mdash;so roughly as to be hardly legible.
Challenger bent his heavy brows over it.</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">Please, dear friend and guide, listen to what
this lady says. I know it is against all your views. And yet I
had to do it. You said yourself that I had no hope. I have tested
it and it works. I know it seems wild and crazy. But any hope is
better than no hope. If you were in my place you would have done
the same. Will you not cast out prejudice and see for yourself?
Dr. Felkin comes at three.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">J. Ross Scotton.</span></p>

<p><br>
Challenger read it twice over and sighed. The brain was
clearly involved in the lesion: "He says I am to listen to you.
What is it? Cut it as short as you can."</p>

<p>"It's a spirit doctor," said the lady.</p>

<p>Challenger bounded in his chair.</p>

<p>"Good God, am I never to get away from this nonsense!" he
cried. "Can they not let this poor devil lie quiet on his
deathbed but they must play their tricks upon him?"</p>

<p>Miss Delicia clapped her hands and her quick little eyes
twinkled with joy.</p>

<p>"It's not his deathbed. He is going to get well."</p>

<p>"Who said so?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Felkin. He never is wrong."</p>

<p>Challenger snorted.</p>

<p>"Have you seen him lately?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Not for some weeks."</p>

<p>"But you wouldn't recognise him. He is nearly cured."</p>

<p>"Cured! Cured of diffused sclerosis in a few weeks!"</p>

<p>"Come and see."</p>

<p>"You want me to aid and abet in some infernal quackery. The
next thing, I should see my name on this rascal's testimonials. I
know the breed. If I did come I should probably take him by the
collar and throw him down the stair."</p>

<p>The lady laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"He would say with Aristides: 'Strike, but hear me'. You will
hear him first, however, I am sure. Your pupil is a real chip of
yourself. He seems quite ashamed of getting well in such an
unorthodox way. It was I who called Dr. Felkin in against his
wish."</p>

<p>"Oh, you did, did you? You took a great deal upon
yourself."</p>

<p>"I am prepared to take any responsibility, so long as I know I
am right. I spoke to Dr. Atkinson. He knows a little of psychic
matters. He is far less prejudiced than most of you scientific
gentlemen. He took the view that when a man was dying, in any
case it could matter little what you did. So Dr. Felkin
came."</p>

<p>"And pray how did this quack doctor proceed to treat the
case?"</p>

<p>"That is what Dr. Ross Scotton wants you to see." She looked
at a watch which she dragged from the depths of the bag. "In an
hour he will be there. I'll tell your friend you are coming. I am
sure you would not disappoint him. Oh!" She dived into the bag
again. "Here is a recent note upon the Bessarabian question. It
is much more serious than people think. You will just have time
to read it before you come. So good-bye, dear Professor, and
<em>au revoir!</em>"</p>

<p>She beamed at the scowling lion and departed.</p>

<p>But she had succeeded in her mission, which was a way she had.
There w as something compelling in the absolutely unselfish
enthusiasm of this small person who would, at a moment's notice,
take on anyone from a Mormon Elder to an Albanian brigand, loving
the culprit and mourning the sin. Challenger came under the
spell, and shortly after three he stumped his way up the narrow
stair and blocked the door of the humble bedroom where his
favourite pupil lay stricken. Ross Scotton lay stretched upon the
bed in a red dressing-gown, and his teacher saw, with a start of
surprised joy, that his face had filled out and that the light of
life and hope had come back into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm beating it!" he cried. "Ever since Felkin held his
first consultation with Atkinson I have felt the life-force
stealing back into me. Oh, chief, it is a fearful thing to lie
awake at night and feel these cursed microbes nibbling away at
the very roots of your life! I could almost hear them at it. And
the cramps when my body&mdash;like a badly articulated skeleton
&mdash;would all get twisted into one rigid tangle! But now,
except some dyspepsia and urticaria of the palms, I am free from
pain. And all on account of this dear fellow here who has helped
me."</p>

<p>He motioned with his hand as if alluding to someone present.
Challenger looked round with a glare, expecting to find some smug
charlatan behind him. But no doctor was there. A frail young
woman, who seemed to be a nurse, quiet, unobtrusive, and with a
wealth of brown hair, was dozing in a corner. Miss Delicia,
smiling demurely, stood in the window.</p>

<p>"I am glad you are better, my dear boy," said Challenger. "But
do not tamper with your reason. Such a complaint has its natural
systole and diastole."</p>

<p>"Talk to him, Dr. Felkin. Clear his mind for him," said the
invalid.</p>

<p>Challenger looked up at the cornice and round at the skirting.
His pupil was clearly addressing some doctor in the room and yet
none was visible. Surely his aberration had not reached the point
when he thought that actual floating apparitions were directing
his cure.</p>

<p>"Indeed, it needs some clearing," said a deep and virile voice
at his elbow. He bounded round. It was the frail young woman who
was talking.</p>

<p>"Let me introduce you to Dr. Felkin," said Miss Delicia, with
a mischievous laugh.</p>

<p>"What tomfoolery is this?" cried Challenger.</p>

<p>The young woman rose and fumbled at the side of her dress.
Then she made an impatient gesture with her hand.</p>

<p>"Time was, my dear colleague, when a snuff-box was as much
part of my equipment as my phlebotomy case. I lived before the
days of Laennec, and we carried no stethoscope, but we had our
little chirurgical battery, none the less. But the snuff-box was
a peace-offering and I was about to offer it to you, but, alas!
it has had its day."</p>

<p>Challenger stood with staring eyes and dilated nostrils while
this speech was delivered. Then he turned to the bed.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that this is your doctor&mdash;that you
take the advice of this person?"</p>

<p>The young girl drew herself up very stiffly.</p>

<p>"Sir, I will not bandy words with you. I perceive very clearly
that you are one of those who have been so immersed in material
knowledge that you have had no time to devote to the
possibilities of the spirit."</p>

<p>"I certainly have no time for nonsense," said Challenger.</p>

<p>"My dear chief!" cried a voice from the bed. "I beg you to
bear in mind how much Dr. Felkin has already done for me. You saw
how I was a month ago, and you see how I am now. You would not
offend my best friend."</p>

<p>"I certainly think, Professor, that you owe dear Dr. Felkin an
apology," said Miss Delicia.</p>

<p>"A private lunatic asylum!" snorted Challenger. Then, playing
up to his part, he assumed the ponderous elephantine irony which
was one of his most effective weapons in dealing with
recalcitrant students.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, young lady&mdash;or shall I say elderly and most
venerable Professor?&mdash;you will permit a mere raw earthly
student, who has no more knowledge than this world can give, to
sit humbly in a corner and possibly to learn a little from your
methods and your teaching." This speech was delivered with his
shoulders up to his ears, his eyelids over his eyes, and his
palms extended in front&mdash;an alarming statue of sarcasm. Dr.
Felkin, however, was striding with heavy and impatient steps
about the room, and took little notice.</p>

<p>"Quite so! Quite so!" she said carelessly. "Get into the
corner and stay there. Above all, stop talking, as this case
calls for all my faculties." He turned with a masterful air
towards the patient. "Well, well, you are coming along. In two
months you will be in the class-room."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is impossible!" cried Ross Scotton, with a half
sob.</p>

<p>"Not so. I guarantee it. I do not make false promises."</p>

<p>"I'll answer for that," said Miss Delicia. "I say, dear
Doctor, do tell us who you were when you were alive."</p>

<p>"Tut I tut! The unchanging woman. They gossiped in my time and
they gossip still. No! no! We will have a look at our young
friend here. Pulse! The intermittent beat has gone. That is
something gained. Temperature&mdash; obviously normal. Blood
pressure&mdash;still higher than I like. Digestion&mdash;much to
be desired. What you moderns call a hunger-strike would not be
amiss. Well, the general conditions are tolerable. Let us see the
local centre of the mischief. Pull your shirt down, sir! Lie on
your face. Excellent!" She passed her fingers with great force
and precision down the upper part of the spine, and then dug in
her knuckles with a sudden force which made the sufferer yelp.
"That is better! There is&mdash;as I have explained&mdash;a
slight want of alignment in the cervical vertebrae which has, as
I perceive it, the effect of lessening the foramina through which
the nerve roots emerge. This has caused compression, and as these
nerves are really the conductors of vital force, it has upset the
whole equilibrium of the parts supplied. My eyes are the same as
your clumsy X-rays, and I clearly perceive that the position is
almost restored, and the fatal constriction removed. I hope,
sir," to Challenger, "that I make the pathology of this
interesting case intelligible to you."</p>

<p>Challenger grunted his general hostility and disagreement.</p>

<p>"I will clear up any little difficulties which may linger in
your mind. But, meantime, my dear lad, you are a credit to me,
and I rejoice in your progress. You will present my compliments
to my colleague of earth, Dr. Atkinson, and tell him that I can
suggest nothing more. The medium is a little weary, poor girl, so
I will not remain longer to-day."</p>

<p>"But you said you would tell us who you were."</p>

<p>"Indeed, there is little to say. I was a very undistinguished
practitioner. I sat under the great Abernethy in my youth, and
perhaps imbibed something of his methods. When I passed over in
early middle age I continued my studies, and was permitted, if I
could find some suitable means of expression, to do something to
help humanity. You understand, of course, that it is only by
serving and self-abnegation that we advance in the higher world.
This is my service, and I can only thank kind Fate that I was
able to find in this girl a being whose vibrations so correspond
with my own that I can easily assume control of her body."</p>

<p>"And where is she?" asked the patient.</p>

<p>"She is waiting beside me and will presently re-enter her own
frame. As to you, sir," turning to Challenger, "you are a man of
character and learning, but you are clearly embedded in that
materialism which is the special curse of your age. Let me assure
you that the medical profession, which is supreme upon earth for
the disinterested work of its members, has yielded too much to
the dogmatism of such men as you, and has unduly neglected that
spiritual element in man which is far more important than your
herbs and your minerals. There is a life-force, sir, and it is in
the control of this life force that the medicine of the future
lies. If you shut your mind to it, it can only mean that the
confidence of the public will turn to those who are ready to
adopt every means of cure, whether they have the approval of your
authorities or not."</p>

<p>Never could young Ross Scotton forget that scene. The
Professor, the master, the supreme chief, he who had to be
addressed with bated breath sat with half-opened mouth and
staring eyes, leaning forward in his chair, while in front of him
the slight young woman shaking her mop of brown hair and wagging
an admonitory forefinger, spoke to him as a father speaks to a
refractory child. So intense was her power that Challenger, for
the instant, was constrained to accept the situation. He gasped
and grunted, but no retort came to his lips. The girl turned away
and sat down on a chair.</p>

<p>"He is going," said Miss Delicia.</p>

<p>"But not yet gone," replied the girl with a smile. "Yes, I
must go, for I have much to do. This is not my only medium of
expression, and I am due in Edinburgh in a few minutes. But be of
good heart, young man. I will set my assistant with two extra
batteries to increase your vitality so far as your system will
permit. As to you, sir," to Challenger, "I would implore you to
beware of the egotism of brain and the self-concentration of
intellect. Store what is old, but be ever receptive to what is
new, and judge it not as you may wish it, but as God has designed
it."</p>

<p>She gave a deep sigh and sank back in her chair. There was a
minute of dead silence while she lay with her head upon her
breast. Then, with another sigh and a shiver, she opened a pair
of very bewildered blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, has he been?" she asked in a gentle feminine voice.</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes!" cried the patient. "He was great. He says I
shall be in the class-room in two months."</p>

<p>"Splendid! Any directions for me?"</p>

<p>"Just the special massage as before. But he is going to put on
two new spirit batteries if I can stand it."</p>

<p>"My word, he won't be long now!" Suddenly the girl's eyes lit
on Challenger and she stopped in confusion.</p>

<p>"This is Nurse Ursula," said Miss Delicia. "Nurse, let me
present you to the famous Professor Challenger." Challenger was
great in his manner towards women, especially if the particular
woman happened to be a young and pretty girl. He advanced now as
Solomon may have advanced to the Queen of Sheba, took her hand,
and patted her hair with patriarchal assurance.</p>

<p>"My dear, you are far too young and charming for such deceit.
Have done with it for ever. Be content to be a bewitching nurse
and resign all claim to the higher functions of doctor. Where,
may I ask, did you pick up all this jargon about cervical
vertebrae and posterior foramina?"</p>

<p>Nurse Ursula looked helplessly round as one who finds herself
suddenly in the clutches of a gorilla.</p>

<p>"She does not understand a word you say!" cried the man on the
bed. "Oh, chief, you must make an effort to face the real
situation! I know what a readjustment it means. In my small way I
have had to undergo it myself. But, believe me, you see
everything through a prism instead of through plate-glass until
you understand the spiritual factor."</p>

<p>Challenger continued his paternal attentions, though the
frightened lady had begun to shrink from him.</p>

<p>"Come now," said he, "who was the clever doctor with whom you
acted as nurse&mdash;the man who taught you all these fine words?
You must feel that it is hopeless to deceive me. You will be much
happier, dear child, when you have made a clean breast of it all,
and when we can laugh together over the lecture which you
inflicted upon me."</p>

<p>An unexpected interruption came to check Challenger's
exploration of the young woman's conscience or motives. The
invalid was sitting up, a vivid red patch against his white
pillows, and he was speaking with an energy which was in itself
an indication of his coming cure.</p>

<p>"Professor Challenger!" he cried, "you are insulting my best
friend. Under this roof at least she shall be safe from the
sneers of scientific prejudice. I beg you to leave the room if
you cannot address Nurse Ursula in a more respectful manner."</p>

<p>Challenger glared, but the peacemaking Delicia was at work in
a moment.</p>

<p>"You are far too hasty, dear Dr. Ross Scotton!" she cried.
"Professor Challenger has had no time to understand this. You
were just as sceptical yourself at first. How can you blame
him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, that is true," said the young doctor. "It seemed to
me to open the door to all the quackery in the Universe
&mdash;indeed it does, but the fact remains."</p>

<p>"' One thing I know that whereas I was blind now I see',"
quoted Miss Delicia. "Ah, Professor, you may raise your eyebrows
and shrug your shoulders, but we've dropped something into your
big mind this afternoon which will grow and grow until no man can
see the end of it." She dived into the bag. "There is a little
slip here 'Brain versus Soul'. I do hope, dear Professor, that
you will read it and then pass it on."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash;  IN WHICH TRAPS ARE
LAID FOR A GREAT QUARRY</h2>

<p class="first">MALONE was bound in honour not to speak of love
to Enid Challenger, but looks can speak, and so their
communications had not broken down completely. In all other ways
he adhered closely to the agreement, though the situation was a
difficult one. It was the more difficult since he was a constant
visitor to the Professor, and now that the irritation of the
debate was over, a very welcome one. The one object of Malone's
life w as to get the great man's sympathetic consideration of
those psychic subjects which had gained such a hold upon himself.
This he pursued with assiduity, but also with great caution, for
he knew that the lava was thin, and that a fiery explosion was
always possible. Once or twice it came and caused Malone to drop
the subject for a week or two, until the ground seemed a little
more firm.</p>

<p>Malone developed a remarkable cunning in his approaches. One
favourite device was to consult Challenger upon some scientific
point&mdash;on the zoological importance of the Straits of Banda,
for example, or the Insects of the Malay Archipelago, and lead
him on until Challenger in due course would explain that our
knowledge on the point was due to Alfred Russel Wallace. "Oh,
really! To Wallace the Spiritualist!" Malone would say in an
innocent voice, on which Challenger would glare and change the
topic.</p>

<p>Sometimes it was Lodge that Malone would use as a trap. "I
suppose you think highly of him."</p>

<p>"The first brain in Europe," said Challenger.</p>

<p>"He is the greatest authority on ether, is he not?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly."</p>

<p>"Of course, I only know him by his psychic works."</p>

<p>Challenger would shut up like a clam. Then Malone would wait a
few days and remark casually: "Have you ever met Lombroso!"</p>

<p>"Yes, at the Congress at Milan."</p>

<p>"I have been reading a book of his."</p>

<p>"Criminology, I presume?"</p>

<p>"No, it was called After Death&mdash;What?"</p>

<p>"I have not heard of it."</p>

<p>"It discusses the psychic question."</p>

<p>"Ah, a man of Lombroso's penetrating brain would make short
work of the fallacies of these charlatans."</p>

<p>"No, it is written to support them."</p>

<p>"Well, even the greatest mind has its inexplicable weakness."
Thus, with infinite patience and cunning did Malone drop his
little drops of reason in the hope of slowly wearing away the
casing of prejudice, but no very visible effects could be seen.
Some stronger measure must be adopted, and Malone determined upon
direct demonstration. But how, when, and where? Those were the
all-important points upon which he determined to consult Algernon
Mailey. One spring afternoon found him back in that drawing-room
where he had once rolled upon the carpet in the embrace of Silas
Linden. He found the Reverend Charles Mason, and Smith, the hero
of the Queen's Hall debate, in deep consultation with Mailey upon
a subject which may seem much more important to our descendants
than those topics which now bulk large in the eyes of the public.
It was no less than whether the psychic movement in Britain was
destined to take a Unitarian or a Trinitarian course. Smith had
always been in favour of the former, as had the old leaders of
the movement and the present organized Spiritualist Churches. On
the other hand, Charles Mason was a loyal son of the Anglican
Church, and was the spokesman of a host of others, including such
weighty names as Lodge and Barrett among the laymen, or
Wilberforce, Haweis and Chambers among the clergy, who clung fast
to the old teachings while admitting the fact of spirit
communication. Mailey stood between the two parties, and, like
the zealous referee in a boxing-match who separates the two
combatants, he always took a chance of getting a knock from each.
Malone was only too glad to listen, for now that he realized that
the future of the world might be bound up in this movement, every
phase of it was of intense interest to him. Mason was holding
forth in his earnest but good-humoured way as he entered.</p>

<p>"The people are not ready for a great change. It is not
necessary. We have only to add our living knowledge and direct
communion of the saints to the splendid liturgy and traditions of
the Church, and you will have a driving force which will
revitalize all religion. You can't pull a thing up from the roots
like that. Even the early Christians found that they could not,
and so they made all sorts of concessions to the religions around
them."</p>

<p>"Which was exactly what ruined them," said Smith.</p>

<p>"That was the real end of the Church in its original strength
and purity."</p>

<p>"It lasted, anyhow."</p>

<p>"But it was never the same from the time that villain
Constantine laid his hands on it."</p>

<p>"Oh, come!" said Mailey. "You must not write down the first
Christian emperor as a villain."</p>

<p>But Smith was a forthright, uncompromising, bull-doggy
antagonist. "What other name will you give to a man who murdered
half his own family?"</p>

<p>"Well, his personal character is not the question. We were
talking of the organization of the Christian Church."</p>

<p>"You don't mind my frankness, Mr. Mason?"</p>

<p>Mason smiled his jolly smile. "So long as you grant me the
existence of the New Testament I don't care what you do. If you
were to prove that our Lord was a myth, as that German Drews
tried to do, it would not in the least affect me so long as I
could point to that body of sublime teaching. It must have come
from somewhere, and I adopt it and say, 'That is my creed'."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, there is not so much between us on that point,"
said Smith. "If there is any better teaching I have not seen it.
It is good enough to go on with, anyhow. But we want to cut out
the frills and superfluities. Where did they all come from? They
were compromises with many religions, so that our friend C. could
get uniformity in his world-wide Empire. He made a patchwork
quilt of it. He took an Egyptian ritual&mdash;vestments, mitre,
crozier, tonsure, marriage ring&mdash;all Egyptian. The Easter
ceremonies are pagan and refer to the vernal equinox.
Confirmation is mithraism. So is baptism, only it was blood
instead of water. As to the sacrificial meal..."</p>

<p>Mason put his fingers in his ears. "This is some old lecture
of yours," he laughed. "Hire a hall, but don't obtrude it in a
private house. But, seriously, Smith, all this is beside the
question. If it is true it will not affect my position at all,
which is that we have a great body of doctrine which is working
well, and which is regarded with veneration by many people, your
humble servant included, and that it would be wrong and foolish
to scrap it. Surely you must agree."</p>

<p>"No, I don't," Smith answered, setting his obstinate jaw. "You
are thinking too much of the feelings of your blessed church-
goers. But you have also to think of the nine people out of ten
who never enter into a church. They have been choked off by what
they, including your humble servant, consider to be unreasonable
and fantastic. How will you gain them while you continue to offer
them the same things, even though you mix spirit-teaching with
it? If, however, you approach these agnostic or atheistic ones,
and say to them: 'I quite agree that all this is unreal and is
tainted by a long history of violence and reaction. But here we
have something pure and new. Come and examine it!' In that way I
could coax them back into a belief in God and in all the
fundamentals of religion without their having to do violence to
their reason by accepting your theology."</p>

<p>Mailey had been tugging at his tawny beard while he listened
to these conflicting counsels. Knowing the two men he was aware
that there was not really much between them, when one got past
mere words, for Smith revered the Christ as a God-like man, and
Mason as a man-like God, and the upshot was much the same. At the
same time he knew that their more extreme followers on either
side were in very truth widely separated, so that compromise
became impossible.</p>

<p>"What I can't understand," said Malone, "is why you don't ask
your spirit friends these questions and abide by their
decisions."</p>

<p>"It is not so simple as you think," Mailey answered. "We all
carry on our earthly prejudices after death, and we all find
ourselves in an atmosphere which more or less represents them.
Thus each would echo his old views at first. Then in time the
spirit broadens out and it ends in a universal creed which
includes only the brotherhood of man and the fatherhood of God.
But that takes time. I have heard most furious bigots talking
through the veil."</p>

<p>"So have I, for that matter," said Malone, "and in this very
room. But what about the materialists? They at least cannot
remain unchanged."</p>

<p>"I believe their mind influences their state and that they lie
inert for ages sometimes, under their own obsession that nothing
can occur. Then at last they wake, realize their own loss of
time, and finally, in many cases, get to the head of the
procession, since they are often men of fine character and
influenced by lofty motives however mistaken in their views."</p>

<p>"Yes, they are often among the salt of the earth," said the
clergyman heartily.</p>

<p>"And they offer the very best recruits for our movement," said
Smith. "There comes such a reaction when they find by the
evidence of their own senses that there really is intelligent
force outside themselves, that it gives them an enthusiasm that
makes them ideal missionaries. You fellows who have a religion
and then add to it cannot even imagine what it means to the man
who has a complete vacuum and suddenly; finds something to fill
it. When I meet some poor earnest chap feeling out into the
darkness I just yearn to put it into his hand."</p>

<p>At this stage, tea and Mrs. Mailey appeared together. But the
conversation did not flag. It is one of the characteristics of
those who explore psychic possibilities that the subject is so
many-sided and the interest so intense that when they meet
together they plunge into the most fascinating exchange of views
and experiences. It was with some difficulty that Malone got the
conversation round to that which had been the particular object
of his visit. He could have found no group of men more fit to
advise him, and all were equally keen that so great a man as
Challenger should have the best available.</p>

<p>Where should it be? On that they were unanimous. The large
seance room of the Psychic College was the most select, the most
comfortable, in every way the best appointed in London. When
should it be? The sooner the better. Every spiritualist and every
medium would surely put any engagement aside in order to help on
such an occasion.</p>

<p>"Who should the medium be? Ah! There was the rub. Of course,
the Bolsover circle would be ideal. It was private and unpaid,
but Bolsover was a man of quick temper and Challenger was sure to
be very insulting and annoying. The meeting might end in riot and
fiasco. Such a chance should not be taken. Was it worth while to
take him over to Paris? But who would take the responsibility of
letting loose such a bull in Dr. Maupuis' china-shop?</p>

<p>"He would probably seize pithecanthropus by the throat and
risk every life in the room," said Mailey. "No, no, it would
never do."</p>

<p>"There is no doubt that Banderby is the strongest physical
medium in England," said Smith. "But we all know what his
personal character is. You could not rely upon him."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Malone. "What's the matter with him?"</p>

<p>Smith raised his hand to his lips.</p>

<p>"He has gone the way that many a medium has gone before
him."</p>

<p>"But surely," said Malone, "that is a strong argument against
our cause. How can a thing be good if it leads to such a
result?"</p>

<p>"Do you consider poetry to be good?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course I do!"</p>

<p>"Yet Poe was a drunkard, and Coleridge an addict, and Byron a
rake, and Verlaine a degenerate. You have to separate the man
from the thing. The genius has to pay a ransom for his genius in
the instability of his temperament. A great medium is even more
sensitive than a genius. Many are beautiful in their lives. Some
are not. The excuse for them is great. They practise a most
exhausting profession and stimulants are needed. Then they lose
control. But their physical mediumship carries on all the
same."</p>

<p>"Which reminds me of a story about Banderby," said Mailey.
"Perhaps you have not seen him, Malone. He is a funny figure at
any time&mdash;a little, round, bouncing man who has not seen his
own toes for years. When drunk he is funnier still. A few weeks
ago I got an urgent message that he was in the bar of a certain
hotel, and too far gone to get home unassisted. A friend and I
set forth to rescue him. We got him home after some unsavoury
adventures, and what would the man do but insist upon holding a
seance. We tried to restrain him, but the trumpet was on a side-
table, and he suddenly switched off the light. In an instant the
phenomena began. Never were they more powerful. But they were
interrupted by Princeps, his control, who seized the trumpet and
began belabouring him with it. 'You rascal! You drunken rascal!
How dare you!' The trumpet was all dinted with the blows.
Banderby ran bellowing out of the room, and we took our
departure."</p>

<p>"Well, it wasn't the medium that time, at any rate," said
Mason. "But about Professor Challenger&mdash;it would never do to
risk the chance."</p>

<p>"What about Tom Linden?" asked Mrs. Mailey. Mailey shook his
head.</p>

<p>"Tom has never been quite the same since his imprisonment.
These fools not only persecute our precious mediums, but they
ruin their powers. It is like putting a razor into a damp place
and then expecting it to have a fine edge."</p>

<p>"What! Has he lost his powers?"</p>

<p>"Well, I would not go so far as that. But they are not so good
as they were. He sees a disguised policeman in every sitter and
it distracts him. Still, he is dependable so far as he goes. Yes,
on the whole we had better have Tom."</p>

<p>"And the sitters?"</p>

<p>"I expect Professor Challenger may wish to bring a friend or
two of his own."</p>

<p>"They will form a horrible block of vibrations! We must have
some of our own sympathetic people to counteract it. There is
Delicia Freeman. She would come. I could come myself. You would
come, Mason?"</p>

<p>"Of course I would."</p>

<p>"And you, Smith?"</p>

<p>"No, no! I have my paper to look after, three services, two
burials, one marriage, and five meetings all next week."</p>

<p>"Well, we can easily get one or two more. Eight is Linden's
favourite number. So now, Malone, you have only to get the great
man's consent and the date."</p>

<p>"And the spirit of confirmation," said Mason, seriously. "We
must take our partners into consultation."</p>

<p>"Of course we must, padre. That is the right note to strike.
Well, that's settled, Malone, and we can only await the
event."</p>

<p>As it chanced, a very different event was awaiting Malone that
evening, and he came upon one of those chasms which unexpectedly
open across the path of life. When, in his ordinary routine, he
reached the office of the <em>Gazette</em>, he was informed by
the <em>commissionaire</em> that Mr. Beaumont desired to see him.
Malone's immediate superior was the old Scotch sub-editor, Mr.
McArdle, and it was rare indeed for the supreme editor to cast a
glimpse down from that peak whence he surveyed the kingdoms of
the world, or to show any cognizance of his humble fellow-workers
upon the slopes beneath him. The great man, clean-shaven,
prosperous and capable, sat in his palatial sanctum amid a rich
assortment of old oak furniture and sealing-wax-red leather. He
continued his letter when Malone entered, and only raised his
shrewd, grey eyes after some minutes' interval.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Malone, good evening! I have wanted to see you for
some little time. Won't you sit down? It is in reference to these
articles on psychic matters which you have been writing. You
opened them in a tone of healthy scepticism, tempered by humour,
which was very acceptable both to me and to our public. I regret,
however, to observe that your view changed as you proceeded, and
that you have now assumed a position in which you really seem to
condone some of these practices. That, I need not say, is not the
policy of the <em>Gazette</em>, and we should have discontinued
the articles had it not been that we had announced a series by an
impartial investigator. We have to continue but the tone must
change."</p>

<p>"What do you wish me to do, sir?"</p>

<p>"You must get the funny side of it again. That is what our
public loves. Poke fun at it all. Call up the maiden aunt and
make her talk in an amusing fashion. You grasp my meaning?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid, sir, it has ceased to seem funny in my eyes. On
the contrary, I take it more and more seriously."</p>

<p>Beaumont shook his solemn head.</p>

<p>"So, unfortunately, do our subscribers." He had a small pile
of letters upon the desk beside him and he took one up. "Look at
this: 'I had always regarded your paper as a God-fearing
publication, and I would remind you that such practices as your
correspondent seems to condone are expressly forbidden both in
Leviticus and Deuteronomy. I should share your sin if I continued
to be a subscriber'."</p>

<p>"Bigoted ass!" muttered Malone.</p>

<p>"So he may be, but the penny of a bigoted ass is as good as
any other penny. Here is another letter: 'Surely in this age of
free-thought and enlightenment you are not helping a movement
which tries to lead us back to the exploded idea of angelic and
diabolic intelligences outside ourselves. If so, I must ask you
to cancel my subscription'."</p>

<p>"It would be amusing, sir, to shut these various objectors up
in a room and let them settle it among themselves."</p>

<p>"That may be, Mr. Malone, but what I have to consider is the
circulation of the <em>Gazette</em>."</p>

<p>"Don't you think, sir, that possibly you underrate the
intelligence of the public, and that behind these extremists of
various sorts there is a vast body of people who have been
impressed by the utterances of so many great and honourable
witnesses? Is it not our duty to keep these people abreast of the
real facts without making fun of them?"</p>

<p>Mr. Beaumont shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"The Spiritualists must fight their own battle. This is not a
propaganda newspaper, and we make no pretence to lead the public
on religious beliefs."</p>

<p>"No, no, I only meant as to the actual facts. Look how
systematically they are kept in the dark. When, for example, did
one ever read an intelligent article upon ectoplasm in any London
paper? Who would imagine that this all-important substance has
been examined and described and endorsed by men of science with
innumerable photographs to prove their words?"</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Beaumont, impatiently. "I am afraid I am
too busy to argue the question. The point of this interview is
that I have had a letter from Mr. Cornelius to say that we must
at once take another line."</p>

<p>Mr. Cornelius was the owner of the <em>Gazette</em>, having
become so, not from any personal merit, but because his father
left him some millions, part of which he expended upon this
purchase. He seldom was seen in the office himself, but
occasionally a paragraph in the paper recorded that his yacht had
touched at Mentone and that he had been seen at the Monte Carlo
tables, or that he was expected in Leicestershire for the season.
He was a man of no force of brain or character, though
occasionally he swayed public affairs by a manifesto printed in
larger type upon his own front page. Without being dissolute, he
was a free liver, living in a constant luxury which placed him
always on the edge of vice and occasionally over the border.
Malone's hot blood flushed to his head as he thought of this
trifler, this insect, coming between mankind and a message of
instruction and consolation descending from above. And yet those
clumsy, childish fingers could actually turn the tap and cut off
the divine stream, however much it might break through in other
quarters.</p>

<p>"So that is final, Mr. Malone," said Beaumont, with the manner
of one who ends an argument.</p>

<p>"Quite final!" said Malone. "So final that it marks the end of
my connection with your paper. I have a six months' contract.
When it ends, I go!"</p>

<p>"Please yourself, Mr. Malone." Mr. Beaumont went on with his
writing.</p>

<p>Malone, with the flush of battle still upon him, went into
McArdle's room and told him what had happened. The old Scotch
sub-editor was very perturbed.</p>

<p>"Eh, man, it's that Irish blood of yours. A drop o' Scotch is
a good thing, either in your veins or at the bottom o' a glass.
Go back, man, and say you have reconseedered!"</p>

<p>"Not I! The idea of this man Cornelius, with his pot-belly and
red face, and&mdash;well, you know all about his private life
&mdash;the idea of such a man dictating what folk are to believe,
and asking me to make fun of the holiest thing on this
earth!"</p>

<p>"Man, you'll be ruined!"</p>

<p>"Well, better men than I have been ruined over this cause. But
I'll get another job."</p>

<p>"Not if Cornelius can stop you. If you get the name of an
insubordinate dog there is no place for you in Fleet Street."</p>

<p>"It's a damned shame!" cried Malone. "The way this thing has
been treated is a disgrace to journalism. It's not Britain alone.
America is worse. We seem to have the lowest, most soulless folk
that ever lived on the Press&mdash;good-hearted fellows too, but
material to a man. And these are the leaders of the people! It's
awful!"</p>

<p>McArdle put a fatherly hand upon the young man's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Weel, weel, lad, we take the world as we find it. We didn't
make it and we're no reesponsible. Give it time! Give it time!
We're a' in such a hurry. Gang hame, now, think it over, remember
your career, that young leddy of yours, and then come back and
eat the old pie that all of us have to eat if we are to keep our
places in the world."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; IN WHICH CHALLENGER
HAS THE EXPERIENCE OF HIS LIFETIME</h2>

<p class="first">So now the nets were set and the pit was dug and
the hunters were all ready for the great quarry, but the question
was whether the creature would allow himself to be driven in the
right direction. Had Challenger been told that the meeting was
really held in the hope of putting convincing evidence before him
as to the truth of spirit intercourse with the aim of his
eventual conversion, it would have roused mingled anger and
derision in his breast. But the clever Malone, aided and abetted
by Enid, still put forward the idea that his presence would be a
protection against fraud, and that he would be able to point out
to them how and why they had been deceived. With this thought in
his mind, Challenger gave a contemptuous and condescending
consent to the proposal that he should grace with his presence a
proceeding which was, in his opinion, more fitted to the stone
cabin of a neolithic savage than to the serious attention of one
who represented the accumulated culture and wisdom of the human
race.</p>

<p>Enid accompanied her father, and he also brought with him a
curious companion who was strange both to Malone and to the rest
of the company. This was a large, raw-boned Scottish youth, with
a freckled face, a huge figure, and a taciturnity which nothing
could penetrate. No question could discover where his interests
in psychic research might lie, and the only positive thing
obtained from him was that his name was Nicholl. Malone and
Mailey went together to the rendezvous at Holland Park, where
they found awaiting them Delicia Freeman, the Rev. Charles Mason,
Mr. and Mrs. Ogilvy of the College, Mr. Bolsover of Hammersmith,
and Lord Roxton, who had become assiduous in his psychic studies,
and was rapidly progressing in knowledge. There were nine in all,
a mixed, inharmonious assembly, from which no experienced
investigator could expect great results. On entering the seance
room Linden was found seated in the armchair, his wife beside
him, and was introduced collectively to the company, most of whom
were already his friends. Challenger took up the matter at once
with the air of a man who will stand no nonsense.</p>

<p>"Is this the medium?" he asked, eyeing Linden with much
disfavour.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Has he been searched?"</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>"Who will search him?"</p>

<p>"Two men of the company have been selected."</p>

<p>Challenger sniffed his suspicions.</p>

<p>"Which men?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It is suggested that you and your friend, Mr. Nicholl shall
do so. There is a bedroom next door."</p>

<p>Poor Linden was marched off between them in a manner which
reminded him unpleasantly of his prison experiences. He had been
nervous before, but this ordeal and the overpowering presence of
Challenger made him still more. He shook his head mournfully at
Mailey when he reappeared.</p>

<p>"I doubt we will get nothing to-day. Maybe it would be wise to
postpone the sitting," said he.</p>

<p>Mailey came round and patted him on the shoulder, while Mrs.
Linden took his hand.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Tom," said Mailey. "Remember that you have a
bodyguard of friends round you who won't see you ill-used." Then
Mailey spoke to Challenger in a sterner way than was his wont. "I
beg you to remember, sir, that a medium is as delicate an
instrument as any to be found in your laboratories. Do not abuse
it. I presume that you found nothing compromising upon his
person?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I did not. And as a result he assures us that we
will get nothing to-day."</p>

<p>"He says so because your manner has disturbed him. You must
treat him more gently."</p>

<p>Challenger's expression did not promise any amendment. His
eyes fell upon Mrs. Linden.</p>

<p>"I understand that this person is the medium's wife. She
should also be searched."</p>

<p>"That is a matter of course," said the Scotsman Ogilvy. "My
wife and your daughter will take her out. But I beg you,
Professor Challenger, to be as harmonious as you can, and to
remember that we are all as interested in the results as you are,
so that the whole company will suffer if you should disturb the
conditions."</p>

<p>Mr. Bolsover, the grocer, rose with as much dignity as if he
were presiding at his favourite temple.</p>

<p>"I move," said he, "that Professor Challenger be
searched."</p>

<p>Challenger's beard bristled with anger.</p>

<p>"Search me! What do you mean, sir?"</p>

<p>Bolsover was not to be intimidated.</p>

<p>"You are here not as our friend but as our enemy. If you was
to prove fraud it would be a personal triumph for you&mdash;see?
Therefore I, for one, says as you should be searched."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to insinuate, sir, that I am capable of
cheating?" trumpeted Challenger.</p>

<p>"Well, Professor, we are all accused of it in turn," said
Mailey smiling. "We all feel as indignant as you are at first,
but after a time you get used to it. I've been called a liar, a
lunatic&mdash;goodness knows what. What does it matter?"</p>

<p>"It is a monstrous proposition," said Challenger, glaring all
round him.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said Ogilvy, who was a particularly pertinacious
Scot. "Of course, it is open to you to walk out of the room and
leave us. But if you sit, you must sit under what we consider to
be scientific conditions. It is not scientific that a man who is
known to be bitterly hostile to the movement should sit with us
in the dark with no check as to what he may have in his
pockets."</p>

<p>"Come, come!" cried Malone. "Surely we can trust to the honour
of Professor Challenger."</p>

<p>"That's all very well," said Bolsover. "I did not observe that
Professor Challenger trusted so very much to the honour of Mr.
and Mrs. Linden."</p>

<p>"We have cause to be careful," said Ogilvy. "I can assure you
that there are frauds practised on mediums just as there are
frauds practised by mediums. I could give you plenty of examples.
No, sir, you will have to be searched."</p>

<p>"It won't take a minute," said Lord Roxton. "What I mean,
young Malone here and I could give you a once over in no
time."</p>

<p>"Quite so, come on!" said Malone.</p>

<p>And so Challenger, like a red-eyed bull with dilating
nostrils, was led from the room. A few minutes later, all
preliminaries being completed, they were seated in the circle and
the seance had begun.</p>

<p>But already the conditions had been destroyed. Those
meticulous researchers who insist upon tying up a medium until
the poor creature resembles a fowl trussed for roasting, or who
glare their suspicions at him before the lights are lowered, do
not realize that they are like people who add moisture to
gunpowder and then expect to explode it. They ruin their own
results, and then when those results do not occur imagine that
their own astuteness, rather than their own lack of
understanding, has been the cause.</p>

<p>Hence it is that at humble gatherings all over the land, in an
atmosphere of sympathy and of reverence, there are such
happenings as the cold man of "Science" is never privileged to
see.</p>

<p>All the sitters felt churned up by the preliminary
altercation, but how much more did it mean to the sensitive
centre of it all! To him the room was filled with conflicting
rushes and eddies of psychic power, whirling this way or that,
and as difficult for him to navigate as the rapids below Niagara.
He groaned in his despair. Everything was mixed and confused. He
was beginning as usual with his clairvoyance, but names buzzed in
his etheric ears without sequence or order. The word "John"
seemed to predominate, so he said. Did "John" mean anything to
anyone? A cavernous laugh from Challenger was the only reply.
Then he had the surname of Chapman. Yes, Mailey had lost a friend
named Chapman. But, it was years ago and there seemed no reason
for his presence, nor could he furnish his Christian name.
"Budworth"&mdash;no; no one would own to a friend named Budworth.
Definite messages came across, but they seemed to have no
reference to the present company. Everything was going amiss, and
Malone's spirits sank to zero. Challenger sniffed so loudly that
Ogilvy remonstrated.</p>

<p>"You make matters worse, sir, when you show your feelings,"
said he. "I can assure you that in ten years of constant
experience I have never known the medium so far out, and I
attribute it entirely to your own conduct."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said Challenger with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I am afraid it is no use, Tom," said Mrs. Linden. "How are
you feeling now, dear? Would you wish to stop?" But Linden under
all his gentle exterior, was a fighter. He had in another form
those same qualities which had brought his brother within an ace
of the Lonsdale Belt.</p>

<p>"No, I think, maybe, it is only the mental part that is
confused. If I am in trance I'll get past that. The physicals may
be better. Anyhow I'll try."</p>

<p>The lights were turned lower until they were a mere crimson
glimmer. The curtain of the cabinet was drawn. Outside it on the
one side, dimly outlined to his audience, Tom Linden, breathing
stertorously in his trance, lay back in a wooden armchair. His
wife kept watch and ward at the other side of the cabinet.</p>

<p>But nothing happened.</p>

<p>Quarter of an hour passed. Then another quarter of an hour.
The company was patient, but Challenger had begun to fidget in
his seat. Everything seemed to have gone cold and dead. Not only
was nothing happening, but somehow all expectation of anything
happening seemed to have passed away.</p>

<p>"It's no use!" cried Mailey at last.</p>

<p>"I fear not," said Malone.</p>

<p>The medium stirred and groaned; he was waking up. Challenger
gave an ostentatious yawn.</p>

<p>"Is not this a waste of time?" he asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Linden was passing her hand over the medium's head and
brow. His eyes had opened.</p>

<p>"Any results?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It's no use, Tom. We shall have to postpone."</p>

<p>"I think so, too," said Mailey.</p>

<p>"It is a great strain upon him under these adverse
conditions," remarked Ogilvy, looking angrily at Challenger.</p>

<p>"I should think so," said the latter with a complacent
smile.</p>

<p>But Linden was not to be beaten.</p>

<p>"The conditions are bad," said he. "The vibrations are all
wrong. But I'll try inside the cabinet. It concentrates the
force."</p>

<p>"Well, it's the last chance," said Mailey. "We may as well try
it."</p>

<p>The armchair was lifted inside the cloth tent and the medium
followed, drawing the curtain behind him.</p>

<p>"It condenses the ectoplasmic emanations," Ogilvy
explained.</p>

<p>"No doubt," said Challenger. "At the same time in the
interests of truth, I must point out that the disappearance of
the medium is most regrettable."</p>

<p>"For goodness sake, don't start wrangling again," cried Mailey
with impatience. "Let us get some results, and then it will be
time enough to discuss their value."</p>

<p>Again there was a weary wait. Then came some hollow groanings
from inside the cabinet. The Spiritualists sat up
expectantly.</p>

<p>"That's ectoplasm," said Ogilvy. "It always causes pain on
emission."</p>

<p>The words were hardly out of his mouth when the curtains were
torn open with sudden violence and a rattling of all the rings.
In the dark aperture there was outlined a vague white figure. It
advanced slowly and with hesitation into the centre of the room.
In the red-tinted gloom all definite outline was lost, and it
appeared simply as a moving white patch in the darkness. With the
deliberation which suggested fear it came, step by step, until it
was opposite the professor.</p>

<p>"Now!" he bellowed in his stentorian voice.</p>

<p>There was a shout, a scream, a crash. "I've got him!" roared
someone. "Turn up the lights!" yelled another. "Be careful! You
may kill the medium!" cried a third. The circle was broken.
Challenger rushed to the switch and put on all the lights. The
place was so flooded with radiance that it was some seconds
before the bewildered and half-blinded spectators could see the
details.</p>

<p>When they had recovered their sight and their balance, the
spectacle was a deplorable one for the majority of the company.
Tom Linden, looking white, dazed, and ill, was seated upon the
ground. Over him stood the huge young Scotsman who had borne him
to earth; while Mrs. Linden, kneeling beside her husband, was
glaring up at his assailant. There was a silence as the company
surveyed the scene. It was broken by Professor Challenger.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen, I presume that there is no more to be said.
Your medium has been exposed as he deserved to be. You can see
now the nature of your ghosts. I must thank Mr Nicholl, who, I
may remark, is the famous football player of that name, for the
prompt way in which he has carried out his instructions."</p>

<p>"I collared him low," said the tall youth. "He was easy."</p>

<p>"You did it very effectively. You have done public service by
helping to expose a heartless cheat. I need not say that a
prosecution will follow."</p>

<p>But Mailey now intervened and with such authority that
Challenger was forced to listen.</p>

<p>"Your mistake is not unnatural, sir, though the course which
you adopted in your ignorance is one which might well have been
fatal to the medium."</p>

<p>"My ignorance indeed! If you speak like that I warn you that I
will look upon you not as dupes, but as accomplices."</p>

<p>"One moment, Professor Challenger. I would ask you one direct
question, and I ask for an equally direct reply. Was not the
figure which we all saw before this painful episode a white
figure?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was."</p>

<p>"You see now that the medium is entirely dressed in black.
Where is the white garment?"</p>

<p>"It is immaterial to me where it is. No doubt his wife and
himself are prepared for all eventualities. They have their own
means of secreting the sheet, or whatever ii may have been. These
details can be explained in the police court."</p>

<p>"Examine now. Search the room for anything white."</p>

<p>"I know nothing of the room. I can only use my common sense.
The man is exposed masquerading as a spirit. Into what corner or
crevice he has thrust his disguise is a matter of small
importance."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, it is a vital matter. What you have seen has
not been an imposture, but has been a very real phenomenon."</p>

<p>Challenger laughed.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, a very real phenomenon. You have seen a
transfiguration which is the half-way state of materialization.
You will kindly realize that spirit guides, who conduct such
affairs, care nothing for your doubts and suspicions. They set
themselves to get certain results, and if they are prevented by
the infirmities of the circle from getting them one way they get
them in another, without consulting your prejudice or
convenience. In this case being unable, owing to the evil
conditions which you have yourself created, to build up an
ectoplasmic form they wrapped the unconscious medium in an
ectoplasmic covering, and sent him forth from the cabinet. He is
as innocent of imposture as you are."</p>

<p>"I swear to God," said Linden, "that from the time I entered
the cabinet until I found myself upon the floor I knew nothing."
He had staggered to his feet and was shaking all over in his
agitation, so that he could not hold the glass of water which his
wife had brought him.</p>

<p>Challenger shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Your excuses," he said, "only open up fresh abysses of
credulity. My own duty is obvious, and it will be done to the
uttermost. Whatever you have to say will, no doubt, receive such
consideration as it deserves from the magistrate." Then Professor
Challenger turned to go as one who has triumphantly accomplished
that for which he came. "Come, Enid!" said he.</p>

<p>And now occurred a development so sudden, so unexpected, so
dramatic, that no one present will ever cease to have it in vivid
memory.</p>

<p>No answer was returned to Challenger's call. Everyone else had
risen to their feet. Only Enid remained in her chair. She sat
with her head on one shoulder, her eyes closed, her hair partly
loosened&mdash;a model for a sculptor.</p>

<p>"She is asleep," said Challenger. "Wake up, Enid. I am
going."</p>

<p>There was no response from the girl. Mailey was bending over
her.</p>

<p>"Hush! Don't disturb her! She is in trance."</p>

<p>Challenger rushed forward. "What have you done? Your infernal
hankey-pankey has frightened her. She has fainted."</p>

<p>Mailey had raised her eyelid.</p>

<p>"No, no, her eyes are turned up. She is in trance. Your
daughter, sir, is a powerful medium."</p>

<p>"A medium! You are raving. Wake up girl! wake up!"</p>

<p>"For God's sake leave her! You may regret it all your life if
you don't. It is not safe to break abruptly into the mediumistic
trance."</p>

<p>Challenger stood in bewilderment. For once his presence of
mind had deserted him. Was it possible that his child stood on
the edge of some mysterious precipice and that he might push her
over?</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" he asked helplessly.</p>

<p>"Have no fear. All will be well. Sit down! Sit down, all of
you. Ah! she is about to speak."</p>

<p>The girl had stirred. She had sat straight in her chair. Her
lips trembled. One hand was outstretched:</p>

<p>"For him!" she cried, pointing to Challenger. "He must not
hurt my Medi. It is a message. For him."</p>

<p>There was breathless silence among the persons who had
gathered round the girl.</p>

<p>"Who speaks?" asked Mailey.</p>

<p>"Victor speaks. Victor. He shall not hurt my Medi. I have a
message. For him!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. What is the message?"</p>

<p>"His wife is here."</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"She says that she has been once before. That she came through
this girl. It was after she was cremated. She knock and he hear
her knocking, but not understand."</p>

<p>"Does this mean anything to you, Professor Challenger?"</p>

<p>His great eyebrows were bunched over his suspicious,
questioning eyes, and he glared like a beast at bay from one to
the other of the faces round him. There was a trick&mdash;a vile
trick. They had suborned his own daughter. It was damnable. He
would expose them, every one. No, he had no questions to ask. He
could see through it all. She had been won over. He could not
have believed it of her, and yet it must be so. She was doing it
for Malone's sake. A woman would do anything for a man she loved.
Yes, it was damnable. Far from being softened he was more
vindictive than ever. His furious face, his broken words,
expressed his convictions.</p>

<p>Again the girl's arm shot out, pointing in front of her.</p>

<p>"Another message!"</p>

<p>"To whom?"</p>

<p>"To him. The man who wanted to hurt my Medi. He must not hurt
my Medi. A man here&mdash;two men&mdash;wish to give him a
message."</p>

<p>"Yes, Victor, let us have it."</p>

<p>"First man's name is..." The girl's head slanted and her ear
was upturned, as if listening. "Yes, yes, I have it! It is Al-Al-
Aldridge."</p>

<p>"Does that mean anything to you?"</p>

<p>Challenger staggered. A look of absolute wonder had come upon
his face.</p>

<p>"What is the second man?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Ware. Yes that is it. Ware."</p>

<p>Challenger sat down suddenly. He passed his hand over his
brow. He was deadly pale. His face was clammy with sweat.</p>

<p>"Do you know them?"</p>

<p>"I knew two men of those names."</p>

<p>"They have message for you," said the girl.</p>

<p>Challenger seemed to brace himself for a blow.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?"</p>

<p>"Too private. Not speak, all these people here."</p>

<p>"We shall wait outside," said Mailey. "Come, friends, let the
Professor have his message."</p>

<p>They moved towards the door leaving the man seated in front of
his daughter. An unwonted nervousness seemed suddenly to seize
him. "Malone, stay with me!"</p>

<p>The door closed and the three were left together.</p>

<p>"What is the message?"</p>

<p>"It is about a powder."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes."</p>

<p>"A grey powder?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The message that men want me to say is: 'You did not kill
us'."</p>

<p>"Ask them then&mdash;ask them&mdash;how did they die?" His
voice was broken and his great frame was quivering with his
emotion.</p>

<p>"They die disease."</p>

<p>"What disease?"</p>

<p>"New&mdash;new. What that? Pneumonia."</p>

<p>Challenger sank back in his chair with an immense sigh of
relief. "My God!" he cried, wiping his brow. Then:</p>

<p>"Call in the others, Malone."</p>

<p>They had waited on the landing and now streamed into the room.
Challenger had risen to meet them. His first words were to Tom
Linden. He spoke like a shaken man whose pride for the instant
was broken.</p>

<p>"As to you, sir, I do not presume to judge you. A thing has
occurred to me which is so strange, and also so certain, since my
own trained senses have attested it, that I am not prepared to
deny any explanation which has been offered of your previous
conduct. I beg to withdraw any injurious expressions I may have
used."</p>

<p>Tom Linden was a true Christian in his character. His
forgiveness was instant and sincere.</p>

<p>"I cannot doubt that my daughter has some strange power which
bears out much which you, Mr. Mailey, have told me. I was
justified in my scientific scepticism, but you have to-day
offered me some incontrovertible evidence."</p>

<p>"We all go through the same experience, Professor. We doubt,
and then in turn we are doubted."</p>

<p>"I can hardly conceive that my word will be doubted upon such
a point," said Challenger, with dignity. "I can truly say that I
have had information to-night which no living person upon this
earth was in a position to give. So much is beyond all
question."</p>

<p>"The young lady is better," said Mrs. Linden.</p>

<p>Enid was sitting up and staring round her with bewildered
eyes.</p>

<p>"What has happened, Father? I seem to have been asleep."</p>

<p>"All right, dear. We will talk of that later. Come home with
me now. I have much to think over. Perhaps you will come back
with us, Malone. I feel that I owe you some explanation."</p>

<p>When Professor Challenger reached his flat, he gave Austin
orders that he was on no account to be disturbed, and he led the
way into his library, where he sat in his big armchair with
Malone upon his left and his daughter upon his right. He had
stretched out his great paw and enclosed Enid's small hand.</p>

<p>"My dear," he said, after a long silence, "I cannot doubt that
you are possessed of a strange power, for it has been shown to me
to-night with a fullness and a clearness which is final. Since
you have it I cannot deny that others may have it also, and the
general idea of mediumship has entered within my conceptions of
what is possible. I will not discuss the question, for my
thoughts are still confused upon the subject, and I will need to
thrash the thing out with you, young Malone, and with your
friends, before I can get a more definite idea. I will only say
that my mind has received a shock, and that a new avenue of
knowledge seems to have opened up before me."</p>

<p>"We shall be proud indeed," said Malone, "if we can help
you."</p>

<p>Challenger gave a wry smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have no doubt that a headline in your paper,
'Conversion of Professor Challenger' would be a triumph. I warn
you that I have not got so far."</p>

<p>"We certainly would do nothing premature and your opinions may
remain entirely private."</p>

<p>"I have never lacked the moral courage to proclaim my opinions
when they are formed, but the time has not yet come. However, I
have received two messages to-night, and I can only ascribe to
them an extra-corporeal origin. I take it for granted, Enid, that
you were indeed insensible."</p>

<p>"I assure you, Father, that I knew nothing."</p>

<p>"Quite so. You have always been incapable of deceit. First
there came a message from your mother. She assured me that she
had indeed produced those sounds which I heard and of which I
have told you. It is clear now that you were the medium and that
you were not in sleep but in trance. It is incredible,
inconceivable, grotesquely wonderful&mdash;but it would seem to
be true."</p>

<p>"Crookes used almost those very words," said Malone. He wrote
that it was all 'perfectly impossible and absolutely true'."</p>

<p>"I owe him an apology. Perhaps I owe a good many people an
apology."</p>

<p>"None will ever be asked for," said Malone. "These people are
not made that way."</p>

<p>"It is the second case which I would explain." The Professor
fidgeted uneasily in his chair. "It is a matter of great privacy
&mdash;one to which I have never alluded, and which no one on
earth could have known. Since you heard so much you may as well
hear all.</p>

<p>"It happened when I was a young physician, and it is not too
much to say that it cast a cloud over my life&mdash;a cloud which
has only been raised to-night. Others may try to explain what has
occurred by telepathy, by subconscious mind action, by what they
will, but I cannot doubt&mdash;it is impossible to
doubt&mdash;that a message has come to me from the dead.</p>

<p>"There was a new drug under discussion at that time. It is
useless to enter into details which you would be incapable of
appreciating. Suffice it that it was of the <em>datura</em>
family which supplies deadly poisons as well as powerful
medicines. I had received one of the earliest specimens, and I
desired my name to be associated with the first exploration of
its properties. I gave it to two men, Ware and Aldridge. I gave
it in what I thought was a safe dose. They were patients, you
understand, in my ward in a public hospital. Both were found dead
in the morning.</p>

<p>"I had given it secretly. None knew of it. There was no
scandal for they were both very ill, and their death seemed
natural. But in my own heart I had fears. I believed that I had
killed them. It has always been a dark background to my life. You
heard yourselves to-night that it was from the disease, and not
from the drug that they died."</p>

<p>"Poor Dad!" whispered Enid patting the great hirsute hand.
"Poor Dad! What you must have suffered!"</p>

<p>Challenger was too proud a man to stand pity, even from his
own daughter. He pulled away his hand.</p>

<p>"I worked for science," he said. "Science must take risks. I
do not know that I am to blame. And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;my
heart is very light to-night."</p>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; WHERE THE MISTS
CLEAR AWAY</h2>

<p class="first">MALONE had lost his billet and had found his way
in Fleet Street blocked by the rumour of his independence. His
place upon the staff had been taken by a young and drunken Jew,
who had at once won his spurs by a series of highly humorous
articles upon psychic matters, peppered with assurances that he
approached the subject with a perfectly open and impartial mind.
His final device of offering five thousand pounds if the spirits
of the dead would place the three first horses in the coming
Derby, and his demonstration that ectoplasm was in truth the
froth of bottle porter artfully concealed by the medium, are
newspaper stunts, which are within the recollection of the
reader.</p>

<p>But the path which closed on one side had opened on the other.
Challenger, lost in his daring dreams and ingenious experiments,
had long needed an active, clear-headed man to manage his
business interests, and to control his world-wide patents. There
were many devices, the fruits of his life's work, which brought
in income, but had to be carefully watched and guarded. His
automatic alarm for ships in shallow waters, his device for
deflecting a torpedo, his new and economical method of separating
nitrogen from the air, his radical improvements in wireless
transmission and his novel treatment of pitch blend, were all
moneymakers. Enraged by the attitude of Cornelius, the Professor
placed the management of all these in the hands of his
prospective son-in-law, who diligently guarded his interests.</p>

<p>Challenger had himself altered. His colleagues, and those
about him, observed the change without clearly perceiving the
cause. He was gentler, humbler, and more spiritual man. Deep in
his soul was the conviction that he, the champion of scientific
method and of truth, had, in fact, for many years been
unscientific in his methods, and a formidable obstruction to the
advance of the human soul through the jungle of the unknown. It
was this self-condemnation which had wrought the change in his
character. Also, with characteristic energy, he had plunged into
the wonderful literature of the subject, and as, without the
prejudice which had formerly darkened his brain, he read the
illuminating testimony of Hare, de Morgan, Crookes, Lombroso,
Barrett, Lodge, and so many other great men, he marvelled that he
could ever for one instant have imagined that such a consensus of
opinion could be founded upon error. His violent and whole-
hearted nature made him take up the psychic cause with the same
vehemence, and even occasionally the same intolerance with which
he had once denounced it, and the old lion bared his teeth and
roared back at those who had once been his associates.</p>

<p>His remarkable article in the Spectator began, "The obtuse
incredulity and stubborn unreason of the prelates who refused to
look through the telescope of Galileo and to observe the moons of
Jupiter, has been far transcended in our own days by those noisy
controversialists, who rashly express extreme opinions upon those
psychic matters which they have never had either the time, or the
inclination to examine"; while in a final sentence he expressed
his conviction that his opponents "did not in truth represent the
thought of the twentieth century, but might rather be regarded as
mental fossils dug from some early Pliocene horizon ". Critics
raised their hands in horror, as is their wont, against the
robust language of the article, though violence of attack has for
so many years been condoned in the case of those who are in
opposition. So we may leave Challenger, his black mane slowly
turning to grey, but his great brain growing ever stronger and
more virile as it faces such problems as the future had in store
&mdash;a future which had ceased to be bounded by the narrow
horizon of death, and which now stretches away into the infinite
possibilities and developments of continued survival of
personality, character and work.</p>

<p>The marriage had taken place. It was a quiet function, but no
prophet could ever have foretold the guests whom Enid's father
had assembled in the Whitehall Rooms. They were a happy crowd,
all welded together by the opposition of the world, and united in
one common knowledge. There was the Rev. Charles Mason, who had
officiated at the ceremony, and if ever a saint's blessing
consecrated a union, so it had been that morning. Now in his
black garb with his cheery toothsome smile, he was moving about
among the crowd carrying peace and kindliness with him. The
yellow-bearded Mailey, the old warrior, scarred with many combats
and eager for more, stood beside his wife, the gentle squire who
bore his weapons and nerved his arm. There was Dr. Maupuis from
Paris, trying to make the waiter understand that he wanted
coffee, and being presented with tooth-picks, while the gaunt
Lord Roxton viewed his efforts with cynical amusement. There,
too, was the good Bolsover with several of the Hammersmith
circle, and Tom Linden with his wife, and Smith, the fighting
bulldog from the north, and Dr. Atkinson, and Marvin the psychic
editor with his kind wife, and the two Ogilvies, and little Miss
Delicia with her bag and her tracts, and Dr. Ross Scotton, now
successfully cured, and Dr. Felkin who had cured him so far as
his earthly representative, Nurse Ursula, could fill his place.
All these and many more were visible to our two-inch spectrum of
colour, and audible to our four octaves of sound. How many
others, outside those narrow limitations, may have added their
presence and their blessing&mdash;who shall say?</p>

<p>One last scene before we close the record. It was in a
sitting-room of the Imperial Hotel at Folkestone. At the window
sat Mr. and Mrs. Edward Malone gazing westwards down Channel at
an angry evening sky. Great purple tentacles, threatening
forerunners from what lay unseen and unknown beyond the horizon,
were writhing up towards the zenith. Below, the little Dieppe
boat was panting eagerly homewards. Far out the great ships were
keeping mid-channel as scenting danger to come. The vague threat
of that menacing sky acted subconsciously upon the minds of both
of them.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Enid," said Malone, "of all our wonderful psychic
experiences, which is now most vivid in your mind?"</p>

<p>"It is curious that you should ask, Ned, for I was thinking of
it at that moment. I suppose it was the association of ideas with
that terrible sky. It was of Miromar I was thinking, the strange
mystery man with his words of doom."</p>

<p>"And so was I."</p>

<p>"Have you heard of him since?"</p>

<p>"Once and once only. It was on a Sunday morning in Hyde Park.
He was speaking to a little group of men. I mixed with the crowd
and listened. It was the same warning."</p>

<p>"How did they take it? Did they laugh?"</p>

<p>"Well, you have seen and heard him. You could not laugh, could
you?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed. But you don't take it seriously, Ned, do you?
Look at the solid old earth of England. Look at our great hotel
and the people on the Lees, and the stodgy morning papers and all
the settled order of a civilized land. Do you really think that
anything could come to destroy it all?"</p>

<p>"Who knows? Miromar is not the only one who says so."</p>

<p>"Does he call it the end of the world?"</p>

<p>"No, no, it is the rebirth of the world&mdash;of the true
world, the world as God meant it to he."</p>

<p>"It is a tremendous message. But what is amiss? Why should so
dreadful a Judgment fall?"</p>

<p>"It is the materialism, the wooden formalities of the
churches, the alienation of all spiritual impulses, the denial of
the Unseen, the ridicule of this new revelation&mdash;these are
the causes according to him."</p>

<p>"Surely the world has been worse before now?"</p>

<p>"But never with the same advantages&mdash;never with the
education and knowledge and so-called civilization, which should
have led it to higher things. Look how everything has been turned
to evil. We got the knowledge of airships. We bomb cities with
them. We learn how to steam under the sea. We murder seamen with
our new knowledge. We gain command over chemicals. We turn them
into explosives or poison gases. It goes from worse to worse. At
the present moment every nation upon earth is plotting secretly
how it can best poison the others. Did God create the planet for
this end, and is it likely that He will allow it to go on from
bad to worse?"</p>

<p>"Is it you or Miromar who is talking now?"</p>

<p>"Well, I have myself been brooding over the matter, and all my
thoughts seem to justify his conclusions. I read a spirit message
which Charles Mason wrote. It was: 'The most dangerous condition
for a man or a nation is when his intellectual side is more
developed than his spiritual'. Is that not exactly the condition
of the world to-day?"</p>

<p>"And how will it come?"</p>

<p>"Ah, there I can only take Miromar's word for it. He speaks of
a breaking of all the phials. There is war, famine, pestilence,
earthquake, flood, tidal waves&mdash;all ending in peace and
glory unutterable."</p>

<p>The great purple streamers were right across the sky. A dull
crimson glare, a lurid angry glow, was spreading in the west.
Enid shuddered as she watched it.</p>

<p>"One thing we have learned," said he. "It is that two souls,
where real love exists, go on and on without a break through all
the spheres. Why, then, should you and I fear death, or anything
which life or death can bring?"</p>

<p>She smiled and put her hand in his.</p>

<p>"Why indeed?" said she.</p>

CLAIRVOYANCE IN SPIRITUALIST CHURCHES</h2>

<p class="first">THIS phenomenon, as exhibited in Spiritualistic
churches or temples, as the Spiritualists usually call them,
varies very much in quality. So uncertain is it that many
congregations have given it up entirely, as it has become rather
a source of scandal than of edification. On the other hand there
are occasions, the conditions being good, the audience
sympathetic and the medium in good form, when the results are
nothing short of amazing. I was present on one occasion when Mr.
Tom Tyrell, of Blackburn, speaking in a sudden call at Doncaster
&mdash;a town with which he was unfamiliar&mdash; got not only
the descriptions but even the names of a number of people which
were recognized by the different individuals to whom he pointed.
I have known Mr. Vout Peters also to give forty descriptions in a
foreign city (Liege) where he had never been before, with only
one failure, which was afterwards explained. Such results are far
above coincidence. What their true <em>raison d'tre</em> may be
has yet to be determined. It has seemed to me sometimes that the
vapour which becomes visible as a solid in ectoplasm, may in its
more volatile condition fill the hall, and that a spirit coming
within it may show up as an invisible shooting star comes into
view when it crosses the atmosphere of the earth. No doubt the
illustration is only an analogy but it may suggest a line of
thought.</p>

<p>I remember being present on two occasions in Boston,
Massachusetts, when clergymen gave clairvoyance from the steps of
the altar, and with complete success. It struck me as an
admirable reproduction of those apostolic conditions when they
taught "not only by words but also by power ". All this has to
come back into the Christian religion before it will be
revitalized and restored to its pristine power. It cannot,
however, be done in a day. We want less faith and more
knowledge.</p>

<h2><a name="note2" id="note2"></a>NOTE ON CHAPTER IX.<br>
EARTHBOUND SPIRITS</h2>

<p class="first">THIS chapter may be regarded as sensational, but
as a fact there is no incident in it for which chapter and verse
may not be given. The incident of Nell Gwynne, mentioned by Lord
Roxton, was told me by Colond Cornwallis West as having occurred
in a country house of his own. Visitors had met the wraith in the
passages and had afterwards, when they saw the portrait of Nell
Gwynne which hung in a sitting-room, exclaimed, "Why, there is
the woman I met ".</p>

<p>The adventure of the terrible occupant of the deserted house
is taken with very little change from the experience of Lord St.
Audries in a haunted house near Torquay. This gallant soldier
told the story himself in <em>The Weekly Dispatch</em> (Dec.,
1921) , and it is admirably retold in Mrs. Violet Tweedale's
<em>Phantoms of the Dawn</em>. As to the conversation carried on
between the clergyman and the earthbound spirit, the same
authoress has described a similar one when recording the
adventures of Lord and Lady Wynford in Glamis Castle (<em>Ghosts
I Have Seen</em>, p. 175) .</p>

<p>Whence such a spirit draws its stock of material energy is an
unsolved problem. It is probably from some mediumistic individual
in the neighbourhood. In the extremely interesting case quoted by
the Rev. Chas. Mason in the narrative and very carefully observed
by the Psychic Research Society of Reykjavik in Iceland, the
formidable earthbound creature proclaimed how it got its
vitality. The man was in life a fisherman of rough and violent
character who had committed suicide. He attached himself to the
medium, followed him to the seances of the Society, and caused
indescribable confusion and alarm, until he was exorcised by some
such means as described in the story. A long account appeared in
the Proceedings of the American Society of Psychic Research and
also in the organ of the Psychic College, Psychic Research for
January, 1925. Iceland, it may be remarked, is very advanced in
psychic science, and in proportion to its population or
opportunities is probably ahead of any other country. The Bishop
of Reykjavik is President of the psychic Society, which is surely
a lesson to our own prelates whose disassociation from the study
of such matters is little less than a scandal. The matter relates
to the nature of the soul and to its fate in the Beyond, yet
there are, I believe, fewer students of the matter among our
spiritual guides than among any other profession.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="note3" id="note3"></a>NOTE ON CHAPTER X.<br>
RESCUE CIRCLES</h2>

<p class="first">THE scenes in this chapter are drawn very
closely either from personal experience or from the reports of
careful and trustworthy experimenters. Among the latter are Mr.
Tozer of Melbourne, and Mr. McFarlane of Southsea, both of whom
have run methodical circles for the purpose of giving help to
earthbound spirits. Detailed accounts of experiences which I have
personally had in the former circles are to be found in Chapters
IV and VI of my <em>Wanderings of a Spiritualist</em>. I may add
that in my own domestic circle, under my wife's mediumship, we
have been privileged to bring hope and knowledge to some of these
unhappy beings.</p>

<p>Full reports of a number of these dramatic conversations are
to be found in the last hundred pages of the late Admiral Usborne
Moore's <em>Glimpses of the Next State</em>. It should be said
that the Admiral was not personally present at these sittings,
but that they were carried out by people in whom he had every
confidence, and that they were confirmed by sworn affidavits of
the sitters. "The high character of Mr. Leander Fisher ", says
the Admiral, "is sufficient voucher for their authenticity." The
same may be said of Mr. E.G. Randall, who has published many
such cases. He is one of the leading lawyers of Buffalo, while
Mr. Fisher is a Professor of Music in that city.</p>

<p>The natural objection is that, granting the honesty of the
investigators, the whole experience may be in some way subjective
and have no relation to real facts. Dealing with this the Admiral
says: "I made inquiries as to whether any of the spirits, thus
brought to understand that they had entered a new state of
consciousness, had been satisfactorily identified. The reply was
that many had been discovered, but after several had been
verified it was considered useless to go on searching for the
relatives and places of abode in earth life of the remainder.
Such inquiries involved much time and labour, and always ended
with the same result". In one of the cases cited (<em>op.
cit.</em>, p.524) there is the prototype of the fashionable woman
who died in her sleep, as depicted in the text. In all these
instances the returning spirit did not realize that its earth
life was over.</p>

<p>The case of the clergyman and of the sailor from the Monmouth
both occurred in my presence at the circle of Mr. Tozer.</p>

<p>The dramatic case where the spirit of a man (it was the case
of several men in the original) manifested at the very time of
the accident which caused their death, and where the names were
afterwards verified in the newspaper report, is given by Mr. E.
G. Randall. Another example given by that gentleman may be added
for the consideration of those who have not realized how cogent
is the evidence, and how necessary for us to reconsider our views
of death. It is in <em>The Dead Have Never Died</em> (p. 104).</p>

<p>"I recall an incident that will appeal to the purely
materialistic. I was one of my father's executors, and after his
dissolution and the settlement of his estate, speaking to me from
the next plane he told me one night that I had overlooked an item
that he wanted to mention to me.</p>

<p>"I replied: 'Your mind was ever centred on the accumulation of
money. Why take up the time that is so limited with the
discussion of your estate? It has already been divided'."</p>

<p>"'Yes,' he answered, 'I know that, but I worked too hard for
my money to have it lost, and there is an asset remaining that
you have not discovered'.</p>

<p>"'Well', I said 'if that be true, tell me about it'.</p>

<p>"He answered: 'Some years before I left I loaned a small sum
of money to Susan Stone, who resided in Pennsylvania, and I took
from her a promissory note upon which, under the laws of that
State, I was entitled to enter a judgment at once without suit. I
was somewhat anxious about the loan, so, before its maturity, I
took the note and filed it with the prothonotary at Erie,
Pennsylvania, and he entered judgment, which became a lien on her
property. In my books of account there was no reference to that
note or judgment. If you will go to the protonotary's office in
Erie, you will find the judgment on record, and I want you to
collect it. There are many things that you don't know about and
this is one of them'.</p>

<p>"I was much surprised at the information thus received, and
naturally sent for a transcript of that judgment. I found it
entered Oct. 21, 1896, and with that evidence of the indebtedness
I collected from the judgment debtor 70 dollars with interest. I
question if anyone knew of that transaction besides the makers of
the note and the prothonotary at Erie. Certainly I did not know
about it. I had no reason to suspect it. The psychic present at
that interview could not have known about the matter, and I
certainly collected the money. My father's voice was clearly
recognizable on that occasion, as it has been on hundreds of
others, and I cite this instance for the benefit of those who
measure everything from a monetary standpoint."</p>

<p>The most striking, however, of all these posthumous
communications are to be found in <em>Thirty Years Among the
Dead</em>, by Dr. Wickland of Los Angeles. This, like many other
valuable books of the sort, can only be obtained in Great Britain
at the Psychic Bookshop in Victoria Street, S.W.</p>

<p>Dr. Wickland and his heroic wife have done work which deserves
the very closest attention from the alienists of the world. If he
makes his point, and the case is a strong one, he not only
revolutionizes all our ideas about insanity, but he cuts deep
also into our views of criminology, and may well show that we
have been punishing as criminals people who were more deserving
of commiseration than of censure.</p>

<p>Having framed the view that many cases of mania were due to
obsession from undeveloped entities, and having found out by some
line of inquiry, which is not clear to me, that such entities are
exceedingly sensitive to static electricity when it is passed
through the body which they have invaded, he founded his
treatment with remarkable results upon this hypothesis. The third
factor in his system was the discovery that such entities were
more easily dislodged if a vacant body was provided for their
temporary reception. Therein lies the heroism of Mrs. Wickland, a
very charming and cultivated lady, who sits in hypnotic trance
beside the subject ready to receive the invader when he is driven
forth. It is through the lips of this lady that the identity and
character of the undeveloped spirit are determined.</p>

<p>The subject having been strapped to the electric chair
&mdash;the strapping is very necessary as many are violent
maniacs&mdash;the power is turned on. It does not affect the
patient, since it is static in its nature, but it causes acute
discomfort to the parasitical spirit, who rapidly takes refuge in
the unconscious form of Mrs. Wickland. Then follow the amazing
conversations which are chronicled in this volume. The spirit is
cross-questioned by the doctor, is admonished, instructed, and
finally dismissed either in the care of some ministering spirit
who superintends the proceedings, or relegated to the charge of
some sterner attendant who will hold him in check should he be
unrepentant.</p>

<p>To the scientist who is unfamiliar with psychic work such a
bald statement sounds wild, and I do not myself claim that Dr.
Wickland has finally made out his case, but I do say that our
experiences at rescue circles bear out the general idea, and that
he has admittedly cured many cases which others have found
intractable. Occasionally there is very cogent confirmation. Thus
in the case of one female spirit who bitterly bewailed that she
had not taken enough carbolic acid the week before, the name and
address being correctly given (<em>op. cit.</em>, p. 39) .</p>

<p>It is not apparently everyone who is open to this invasion,
but only those who are in some peculiar way psychic sensitives.
The discovery, when fully made out, will be one of the root facts
of the psychology and jurisprudence of the future.</p>

<h2><a name="note4" id="note4"></a>NOTE ON CHAPTER XII.<br>
DR. MAUPUIS'S EXPERIMENTS</h2>

<p class="first">The Dr. Maupuis of the narrative is, as every
student of psychic research will realize, the late Dr. Geley,
whose splendid work on this subject will ensure his permanent
fame. His was a brain of the first order, coupled with a moral
courage which enabled him to face with equanimity the cynicism
and levity of his critics. With rare judgment he never went
further than the facts carried him, and yet never flinched from
the furthest point which his reason and the evidence would
justify. By the munificence of Mr. Jean Meyer he had been placed
at the head of the Institut Mtapsychique, admirably equipped for
scientific work, and he got the full value out of that equipment.
When a British Jean Meyer makes his appearance he will get no
return for his money if he does not choose a progressive brain to
drive his machine. The great endowment left to the Stanford
University of California has been practically wasted, because
those in charge of it were not Geleys or Richets.</p>

<p>The account of Pithecanthropus is taken from the <em>Bulletin
de l'Institut Mtapsychique</em>. A well-known lady has described
to me how the creature pressed between her and her neighbour, and
how she placed her hand upon his shaggy skin. An account of this
seance is to be found in Geley's <em>L'&#8240;ctoplasmie et la
Clairvoyance</em> (Felix Alcau) , p.345. On page 296 is a
photograph of the strange bird of prey upon the medium's head. It
would take the credulity of a MacCabe to imagine that all this is
imposture.</p>

<p>These various animal types may assume very bizarre forms. In
an unpublished manuscript by Colonel Ochorowitz, which I have
been privileged to see, some new developments are described which
are not only formidable but also unlike any creature with which
we are acquainted.</p>

<p>Since animal forms of this nature have materialized under the
mediumship both of Kluski and of Guzik, their formation would
seem to depend rather upon one of the sitters than upon either of
the mediums unless we can disconnect them entirely from the
circle. It is usually an axiom among Spiritualists that the
spirit visitors to a circle represent in some way the mental and
spiritual tendency of the circle. Thus, in nearly forty years of
experience, I have never heard an obscene or blasphemous word at
a seance because such seances have been run in a reverent and
religious fashion. The question therefore may arise whether
sittings which are held for purely scientific and experimental
purposes, without the least recognition of their extreme
religious significance, may not evoke less desirable
manifestations of psychic force. The high character, however, of
men like Richet and Geley ensure that the general tendency shall
be good.</p>

<p>It might be argued that a subject with such possibilities had
better be left alone. The answer seems to be that these
manifestations are, fortunately, very rare, whereas the daily
comfort of spirit intercourse illumines thousands of lives. We do
not abandon exploration because the land explored contains some
noxious creatures. To abandon the subject would be to hand it
over to such forces of evil as chose to explore it while
depriving ourselves of that knowledge which would aid us in
understanding and counteracting their results.</p>
