  <h2><a name="7to12"></a>7 to 12 <br>
  A Detective Story </h2>
  <p><b>&ldquo;</b>Clarke?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another  entrance through a second-story window. A detective wanted right off. Better  hurry up there, &mdash; East Seventy-third Street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Clarke  turned to go; but the next moment I heard the Superintendent call him back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is Mr. Winchester&rsquo;s, you know; the banker.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Clarke  nodded and started again; but a suppressed exclamation from the Superintendent  made him stop for the second time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  changed my mind,&rdquo; said the latter, folding up the slip of paper he held in his  hand. &ldquo;You can see what Hailey has for you to do; I&rsquo;ll attend to this.&rdquo; And  giving me a look that was a summons, he whispered in my ear: &ldquo;This notification  was written by Mr. Winchester himself, and at the bottom I see hurriedly added,  &lsquo;Keep it quiet; send your discreetest man.&rsquo; That means something more than a  common burglary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  nodded, and the affair was put in my hands. As I was going out of the door, a  fellow detective came hurriedly in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nabbed  them,&rdquo; cried he.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;  asked more than one voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  fellows who have been climbing into second-story windows, and helping  themselves while the family is at dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  stopped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did you catch them?&rdquo; I asked,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  Twenty-second Street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  two hours ago,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  looked at the Superintendent. He gave a curious lift of his brows, which I  answered with a short smile. In another moment I was in the street.</p>
  <p>My  first ring at the bell of No. &mdash; East Seventy-third Street brought response in  the shape of Mr. Winchester himself. Seeing me, his countenance fell, but in  another instant brightened as I observed:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  sent for a detective, sir;&rdquo; and quietly showed him my badge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he murmured; &ldquo;but I did not expect&rdquo;&mdash;he paused. I was used to these pauses; I do  not suppose I look exactly like the ordinary detective. &ldquo;Your name?&rdquo; he asked,  ushering me into a small reception-room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Byrd,&rdquo;  I replied. And taking as a compliment the look of satisfaction which crossed  his face as he finished a hasty but keen scrutiny of my countenance and figure,  I in turn subjected him to a respectful but earnest glance of interrogation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  has been a robbery here,&rdquo; I ventured.</p>
  <p>He  nodded, and a look of care replaced the affable expression which a moment  before had so agreeably illumined his somewhat stern features.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twenty-five  thousand dollars&rsquo; worth,&rdquo; he whispered, shortly. &ldquo;Mrs. Winchester&rsquo;s diamonds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  started; not so much at the nature and value of the articles stolen, as at the  indefinable air with which this announcement was made by the wealthy and  potential broker and banker. If his all had been taken his eye could not have  darkened with a deeper shadow; if that all had been lost through means which  touched his personal pride and feelings, he could not have given a sharper edge  to his tones, business-like as he endeavored to make them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  heavy loss,&rdquo; I remarked. &ldquo;Will you give me the details of the affair as far as  you know them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  shook his head and waved his hand with a slight gesture towards the stairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  prefer that you learn them from such inquiries as you will make above,&rdquo; said  he. &ldquo;My wife will tell you what she knows about it, and there is a servant or  two who may have something to say. I would speak to no one else,&rdquo; he added,  with a deepening of the furrow in his brow; &ldquo;at least not at present.  Only,&rdquo;&mdash;and here his manner became markedly impressive,&mdash; &ldquo;understand this. Those  diamonds <i>must</i> be found in forty-eight  hours, no matter who suffers, or what consequences follow a firm and determined  pursuit of them. I will stop at nothing to have them back in the time  mentioned, and I do not expect you to. If they are here by Thursday night&mdash;&rdquo; and  the hand he held out with its fingers curved and grasping actually trembled  with his vehemence&mdash;&ldquo;I will give you five hundred dollars Friday afternoon. If  they are here without noise, scandal, or&mdash;&rdquo; his voice sank further&mdash;&ldquo;disquietude  to my wife, I will increase the sum to a thousand. Isn&rsquo;t that handsome?&rdquo; he  queried, with an attempt at a lighter tone, which was not altogether  successful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo;  was my short but deferential reply. And, interested enough by this time, I  turned towards the door, when he stopped me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have endeavored not to forestall your judgment by any  surmises or conclusions of my own. But, after you have investigated the matter  and come to some sort of theory in regard to it, I should like to hear what you  have to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will be happy to consult with you,&rdquo; was my reply; and, seeing that he had no  further remarks to offer, I prepared to accompany him up-stairs.</p>
  <p>The  house was a superb one, and not the least handsome portion of it was the  staircase. As we went up, the eye rested everywhere on the richest artistic  effects of carved wood-work and tapestry hangings. Nor was the glitter of brass  lacking, nor the sensuous glow which is cast by the light striking through  ruby-colored glass. At the top was a square hall fitted up with divans and  heavily bespread with rugs. At one end a half-drawn porti&egrave;re disclosed a suite  of apartments furnished with a splendor equal to that which marked the rest of  the house, while at the other was a closed door, towards which Mr. Winchester  advanced.</p>
  <p>I  was hastily following him, when a young man, coming from above, stepped between  us. Mr. Winchester at once turned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you going out?&rdquo; he asked this person, in a tone that lacked the cordiality of a  parent, while it yet suggested the authority of one.</p>
  <p>The  young gentleman, who was of fine height and carriage, paused with a curious,  hesitating air, </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you?&rdquo; he inquired, ignoring my presence, or possibly not noticing it, I being  several feet from him and somewhat in the shadow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  may show ourselves at the Smiths for a few minutes, by and by,&rdquo; Mr. Winchester  returned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I am not going out,&rdquo; the young man said, and, turning, he went again up-stairs.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Winchester&rsquo;s eye followed him. It was only for a moment; but to me, accustomed  as I am to note the smallest details in the manner and expression of a person,  there was a language in that look which opened a whole field of speculation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  son?&rdquo; I inquired, stepping nearer to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  wife&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; he replied; and, without giving me an opportunity to put another  query, he opened the door before him and ushered me in.</p>
  <p>A  tall, elegant woman of middle age was seated before the mirror, having the  final touches given to her rich toilette by a young woman who knelt on the  floor at her side. A marked picture, and this not from the accessories of  wealth and splendor everywhere observable, but from the character of the two  faces, which, while of an utterly dissimilar cast, and possibly belonging to  the two extremes of society, were both remarkable for their force and  individuality of expression, as well as for the look of trouble and suppressed  anxiety, which made them both like the shadows of one deep, dark thought.</p>
  <p>The  younger woman was the first to notice us and rise. Though occupying a humble  position and accustomed to defer to those around her, there was extreme grace  in her movement and a certain charm in her whole bearing which made it natural  for the eye to follow her. I did not long allow myself this pleasure, however,  for in another instant Mrs. Winchester had caught sight of our forms in the  mirror, and, rising with a certain cold majesty, in keeping with her imposing  figure and conspicuous if mature beauty, stepped towards us with a slow step,  full of repose and quiet determination, Whatever <i>her</i> feelings might be, they were without the fierceness and  acrimony which characterized those of her husband. But were they less keen? At  first glance I thought not, but at the second I doubted. Mrs. Winchester was  already a riddle to me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Millicent,&rdquo;&mdash;so  her husband addressed her,&mdash;&ldquo;allow me to introduce to you a young man from the  police force. If the diamonds are to be recovered before the week is out, he is  the man to do it. I pray you offer him every facility for learning the facts.  He may wish to speak to the servants and to&mdash;&rdquo; his eye roamed towards the young  girl, who, I thought, turned pale under his scrutiny&mdash;&ldquo;to Philippa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philippa  knows nothing,&rdquo; the lady&rsquo;s indifferent side-look seemed to say, but her lips  did not move, nor did she speak till he had left the room and closed the door  behind him. Then she turned to me and gave me first a careless look and then a  keener and more sustained one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have been told how I lost my diamonds,&rdquo;&rsquo; she remarked at length.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  said at the station that a man had entered by your second-story window while  you were at dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at dinner,&rdquo; she corrected gravely. &ldquo;I do not leave my jewel-box lying open,  while I go down to dinner. I was in the reception-room below&mdash;Mr. Winchester had  sent word that he wished to see me for an instant&mdash;and being on the point of  going to an evening party, my diamonds were in their case on the mantel-piece.  When I came back the case was there, but no diamonds. They had been carried off  in my absence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  glanced at the mantel-shelf. On it lay the open jewel-case. &ldquo;What made you  think a burglar took them?&rdquo; I asked, my eyes on the lady I was addressing, but  my ears open to the quick, involuntary drawing in of the breath which had  escaped the young girl at the last sentence of her mistress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  window was up&mdash;I had left it closed&mdash; and there was a sound of scurrying feet on  the pavement below. I had just time to see the forms of two men hurrying down  the street. You know there have been a series of burglaries of this nature  lately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  bowed, for her imperiousness seemed to demand it. Then I glanced at Philippa.  She was standing with her face half averted, trifling with some object on the  table, but her apparent unconcern was forced, and her hand trembled so that she  hastily dropped the article with which she was toying and turned in such a  manner that she hid it as well as her countenance from view.</p>
  <p>I  made a note of this and allowed my attention to return to Mrs. Winchester.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  what time was this?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seven  o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Late  for a burglary of this kind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  flush sudden and deep broke out on the lady&rsquo;s cheek.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was successful, however,&rdquo; she observed.</p>
  <p>Ignoring  her anger, which may have arisen from sheer haughtiness and a natural dislike  to having any statement she chose to make commented upon, I pursued my  inquiries.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  how long, madam, do you think you were down-stairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  five minutes or so; certainly not ten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the window was closed when you left the room and open when you returned?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  said so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  glanced at the windows. They were both closed now and the shades drawn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I ask you to show me which window, and also how wide it stood open?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was the window over the stoop, and it stood half-way open.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  passed at once to the window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the shade?&rdquo; I asked, turning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was&mdash;was  down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are sure, madam?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite;  it was by the noise it made as I opened the door that I noticed the window was  open.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  first glance, then, was not at the mantel-piece?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir, but my second was.&rdquo; Her self-possession was almost cold.</p>
  <p>This  great lady evidently did not enjoy her position of witness, notwithstanding the  heavy loss she had sustained, and the fact that the inquisition being made was  all in her own interests. I was not to be repelled by her manner, however, for  a suspicion had seized me which somewhat accounted for the words and method  pursued by Mr. Winchester, and a suspicion once formed, holds imperious sway  over the mind of a detective till it is either disproved by facts or confirmed  in the same manner into a settled belief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo;  I remarked, &ldquo;your loss is very great, and demands the most speedy and vigorous  effort on the part of the police, that it may not result in a permanent one.  Has it struck you&rdquo;&mdash;and I looked firmly at the young girl whom, by my change of  position, I had brought again into view&mdash;&ldquo;that it was in any way peculiar that  chance thieves working in this dangerous and conspicuous manner should know just  the moment to make the hazardous effort which resulted so favorably to  themselves? These burglaries which, as you say, have been so plentiful of late,  have hitherto all taken place at the hour the family are supposed to be at  dinner, while this occurred just when the family would reasonably be supposed  to be returning up-stairs. Besides, the gas was burning in this room, was it  not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the shades down?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  that, till the stoop had been climbed and the room entered, the thief had every  reason to believe it was occupied, unless he had notification to the contrary  from some one better situated than himself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  lady&rsquo;s eyes opened, and a slight, sarcastic smile parted her lips; but I was  not studying her at this moment, but the young Philippa. Humble as she  evidently was, and in a condition of mind that caused her to place a restraint  upon herself, she took a step forward as I said this, and her mouth opened, as  if she would fling some word into the conversation that would neither bear the stamp  of humility nor sustain her previous role of indifference. But a moment&rsquo;s  thought was sufficient to quell her passionate impulse, and in another instant  she was gliding quietly from the room, when I leaned toward Mrs. Winchester and  whispered:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Request  the young woman to wait in the hall outside, and suggest that she leave the  door open. I do not feel like letting out of my sight just yet any person, no  matter how reliable, who has listened to my last remark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Winchester looked surprised, and eyed me with something of the expression she  might have betrayed if I had begged her to stop a mouse from escaping the  conference we were holding. But she did what I asked her, and that with a cold,  commanding air which proved that, however useful she found the deft and  graceful Philippa, she had no real liking for her or any interest in her beyond  that which sprang from the value of her services. Was this state of things the  fault of Mrs. Winchester or of Philippa? I had not time to determine. The  docility of the latter was not, perhaps, to be trusted too far, especially if,  as I half suspected, there was some tie between her and the thieves who had  carried off Mrs. Winchester&rsquo;s jewels; and while she still lingered where I  could see her, I must put the question so evidently demanded by the gravity of  the situation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Winchester,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is there any one in your house whom you think capable of  being in league with the robbers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  question took her by surprise; she started, and the flush reappeared on her  cheek. &ldquo;I do not understand you,&rdquo; she began; but, speedily recovering her  self-possession, she exclaimed, in a low but emphatic tone, &ldquo;No; how could you  think of such a thing? It is the work of professional burglars and of them  alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  made a slight but unmistakable gesture towards the hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is that girl?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philippa?  My maid,&rdquo; she answered, without the slightest token of understanding, much less  of sharing, the suspicion which I feared I had, perhaps, too strongly suggested  by my rather pointed inquiry. &ldquo;Or, rather,&rdquo; she corrected, with some slight  show of sarcasm, &ldquo;she is what is commonly called a <i>companion;</i> being sufficiently well educated to read to me if I  happen to be in the mood for listening, or even to play on the piano, if music  is required in the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  chill indifference of this answer stamped Mrs. Winchester as a woman of more  elegance than feeling; but as that only made my rather disagreeable task  easier, it would be ungracious in me to criticise it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  long has she been with you?&rdquo; I pursued.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  a year; perhaps more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you know her well; her antecedents and associates?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I know her; all that there is to know. She is not a deep person, nor is she  worthy your questions. Let us drop Philippa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  one moment,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;In a case like this I must satisfy myself thoroughly  as to the character and past history of all who are in the house. I have seen  Philippa, and consequently push my inquiries in her regard first. With whom did  she live before she came to you, and where does she spend her time when she is  not with you in the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Winchester grew visibly impatient. &ldquo;Follies!&rdquo; she cried; then, hurriedly, as if  anxious to be done with my importunities, &ldquo;Philippa is the daughter of the  clergyman who married my husband and myself. I have always known her; she came  from her father&rsquo;s death-bed to my house. As for associates, she has none; and  the time she spends out of my rooms is so small that I think it is hardly worth  inquiring how or where it is employed. Have you any further inquiries to make?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  had, but I reserved them. &ldquo;Will you let me speak to Philippa?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>Her  gesture was one of the utmost disdain, but it contained an acquiescence of  which I was not slow in availing myself. Stepping rapidly into the hall, I  approached the slight figure I had managed to keep in view during this  conversation.</p>
  <p>But  at my first movement in her direction the young girl started, and before I  could address her she had passed through the doorway of the opposite room and  disappeared in the darkness beyond.</p>
  <p>I  immediately stepped back to the lady I had left.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  those rooms communicate with a back staircase?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she returned, with uncompromising coldness.</p>
  <p>I  was baffled; that is, as far as Philippa was concerned. Accepting the  situation, however, with what grace I could, I bowed my acknowledgments to Mrs.  Winchester, and excusing myself for the moment, went hurriedly below.</p>
  <p>I  found her husband awaiting me with ill-concealed anxiety.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  he asked, at my reappearance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have come to a conclusion,&rdquo; said I.</p>
  <p>He  drew me into a remote corner of the room, where, without our conversation being  overheard, he could still keep his eye on the staircase, visible through the  half-open door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me hear,&rsquo;&rsquo; said he.</p>
  <p>I  at once spoke my mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  thief was no chance one; he not only knew that your house contained diamonds,  but he knew where to find them and when. Either a signal was given him when to  enter or the diamonds were thrown into his hand out of the window. Does my  conviction coincide with yours?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  smiled a grim smile and waived the question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  who do you think gave the signal or threw the diamonds? Do not be afraid to  speak names; the case is too serious for paltering.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said I, &ldquo;I have been in the house but a few minutes and have seen but three  persons besides yourself. I had rather not mention any one as the possible  accomplice of so daring a crime till I have seen and conversed with every one  here. But there is a girl upstairs&mdash;you yourself called my attention to her  &mdash;about whom I should like to ask a question or two, I allude to Philippa, Mrs.  Winchester&rsquo;s companion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  turned an eye full of expectancy, towards me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you like her? Have you confidence in her? Is she a person to be trusted?&rdquo; I  inquired.</p>
  <p>His  glance grew quite bright, and he bowed with almost a gesture of respect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  could not have a better witness,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
  <p>The  answer was so unexpected, I hastily dropped my eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  will talk, then, if I interrogate her?&rdquo; said I.</p>
  <p>It  was now his turn to look disconcerted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you have not done so?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have not had the opportunity,&rdquo; I rejoined.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  he exclaimed, &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; And with a look and manner hard to describe, he added, &ldquo;Mrs.  Winchester naturally kept the girl quiet. I might have expected that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Astonished  at this new turn, I ventured to speak the thought suggested by an admission so  extraordinary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why should Mrs. Winchester wish to suppress any evidence calculated to lead to  the discovery of a thief who had so heavily robbed her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  gleam of satisfaction which for the last few moments had lighted up the  countenance of the gentleman before me, faded perceptibly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;that our opinions on this matter are less in accord than I  supposed. But,&rdquo; he continued more heartily, &ldquo;you have, as you very justly  remarked just now, been but a few minutes in the house, and have not had full  opportunity to learn the facts. I will wait till you have talked with Philippa.  Shall I call her here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo;  I urged; &ldquo;she is below, I think, though possibly she may still be in the rooms  above;&rdquo; and I explained how she had started away at my approach, hiding herself  in apartments to which I felt I had not the right of acces.</p>
  <p>He  frowned, and moved hastily toward the door, but paused half-way to ask me  another question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before  I go,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I should like to inquire what word of Mrs. Winchester led you  to the conclusion that the theft was committed by some one in the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo;  cried I, &ldquo;you are going too fast; I do not say the theft was committed by some  one in the house. I merely speak of an accomplice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  flung the diamonds out of the window&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  merely gave the signal that they were accessible, and for the moment  unguarded.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  waved his hand impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us not waste time,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I want to know what Mrs. Winchester said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  said nothing,&rdquo; I interrupted, for my haste was as great as his; &ldquo;that is,  nothing beyond the necessary relation of the facts&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  were&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  the jewels were lying open in their case on the bureau; that you called her  from below; and that she hastened to respond by her presence; was gone five  minutes or so, and, returning, found the window open and the diamonds gone. As  she had left the window shut, she naturally sprang to it and looked out, in  time to see two men hurrying down the street. Surely these facts you know as  well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was curious,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;So those are the facts you received, and it is from  them alone you gathered the conclusion you have stated?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said I, &ldquo;there was Philippa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  she said nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know, but she did not need to speak. I heard her heart beat, if I may so  express myself, and from its beatings came the conviction I have given you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Winchester bestowed upon me an approving smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are all I thought you,&rdquo; was his comment. &ldquo;Philippa&rsquo;s heart did beat, and with  most unwonted emotions, too. Philippa saw the person who relieved Mrs.  Winchester of her jewels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;  I cried, &ldquo;and you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  did not wait to hear the end of my remonstrance. &ldquo;I say so,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;because  while Mrs. Winchester was here, and before she ascended, I saw Philippa go up.  She had just time to reach the head of the stairs, when the person whose step I  had already detected crossing the floor above, gained the hall&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  hall?&rdquo; I cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Can it be you really allowed yourself to dream for a moment that the thief who  stole this small fortune came in by the window?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Winchester,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;when I left the police station it was with some doubt, I  confess, as to whether this theft had been committed in just the way the man  who brought your note said it had been. But after hearing what Mrs. Winchester  had to say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Winchester&rsquo;s account of this occurrence is not to be depended upon,&rdquo; he broke  in calmly, but determinedly. &ldquo;Shall I give you a fact or two? The window which  my wife declares she found open when she went up-stairs was not raised while  she was down here, but after her return, for <i>I heard it</i>. The step which crossed the floor above us while we were  talking together here, went out, not by any window, but by the door leading  into the hall; so that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Winchester,&rdquo; I interrupted, &ldquo;do you realize that if what you say is true, the  diamonds are probably still in your house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  where I think they are, Mr. Byrd; just where I think they are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  began to have a strong notion of his suspicion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Philippa,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Saw</i> what I <i>heard</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  made no further effort to detain him. &ldquo;Let us have her here,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;If what  you surmise is true, the mystery ought to be one of easy solution. So easy,&rdquo; I  could not forbear adding, &ldquo;that I wonder you felt the need of sending for a  detective.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  forget,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;that it is not so much the discovery of the thief I am  after, as the recovery of the jewels. The former I might have managed without  your assistance; but the latter requires an authority backed by the law.&rdquo; And  merely stopping to call my attention to the necessity of keeping a watch on the  front door that no one should escape from the house while he was gone, he  hastily left me and went up-stairs.</p>
  <p>He  was absent some twenty minutes, during which I heard him pass in and out of his  wife&rsquo;s room. But when he came down he was alone, and his countenance, which  before had looked merely anxious and determined, now bore the marks of anger  and impatience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know by what motive she is actuated,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;but I cannot induce  Philippa to speak. She insists she has nothing to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  saw her, then? I was afraid she had escaped by the back-stairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo;  was the dry retort. &ldquo;I caused the door leading to the rear hall to be locked  long ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  bowed in admiration of his caution.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one can pass from the upper to the lower portion of this house without going by  this door; how else could I be sure the diamonds had not already been smuggled  out of the building?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you are positively sure that, as it is, they are still here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Positively.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that Philippa, although she will not speak, knows who took the jewels, or at  least who it was that entered the room above while Mrs. Winchester was down  here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo;  I declared, &ldquo;our coast is clear. To find the diamonds it is only necessary to  search the house, and as for the culprit, Philippa will find it difficult to  keep silence when once the law has taken its course, and duty as well as honor  compels her to speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  nodded and stood a moment thinking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  would search the house?&rdquo; he repeated at last. &ldquo;It is a large house and its  places of concealment innumerable; I do not think we should recover them by  that means&mdash;not in the time I have specified. Listen to my plan. Mrs. Winchester  and myself expected to go to a certain reception to-night. It is a grand affair,  and it is desirable that we should be present. We will go there, but before  going I will make it known throughout the house that you are a detective, and  say that it is your intention to search the house for the missing jewels as  soon as you can get the necessary assistance from your office. This will alarm  the guilty, and if I am not very much mistaken, lead to the endeavor of some  one person in this house to leave it. If this should prove true, do not hinder  the attempt, for that person will have the diamonds in his possession, and if  followed, as you will take measures he shall be, their recovery must be a  matter of an hour or two; for a man is more easily searched than a house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  admirable scheme,&rdquo; I exclaimed, wondering at an acumen I certainly should not  have looked for in the wealthy broker. &ldquo;I see but one flaw in it. If Mrs.  Winchester heard that her house was to be ransacked in her absence, would she  consent to go to the reception?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Winchester will be in her carriage when I make the announcement. I shall  certainly see to that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well, then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it only remains for me to procure from the police-station  the man I want for the pursuit you mention.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will call there on my way to the reception with any note you may choose to  write.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  scribbled two names on a card.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Either  of those men will answer,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Let him take his station in the area next  to this, and when posted there give <i>the  call</i>. He will understand. Will the guilty person be likely to lead him a  long chase?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  it is as impossible for me to know as you. I have no conception where the thief  will go upon leaving this house. To some place favorable for the concealment of  his booty, of course, but where, time and the skill of his pursuer must  determine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will just add a line of caution to that pursuer,&rdquo; said I, and taking the card I  scribbled a few directions on its back, after which I gave it to Mr.  Winchester.</p>
  <p>In  exchange he handed me two keys.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  one unlocks the door leading to the back-stairs, and this the front door of the  basement.&rdquo; After which explanation he left me, and in another moment I heard  him go up-stairs and enter his wife&rsquo;s room.</p>
  <p>The  programme we had agreed upon was carried out to the letter. In less than a half  hour Mr. and Mrs. Winchester came down, he looking pale and stern, she haughty  and imperturbably calm. The carriage, which I had heard drive up a moment before,  stood at the door and they passed immediately out, but not before I had time to  observe that she wore the same dress I had seen her in above, a rich mauve-colored  velvet made high in the throat and heavily loaded with what I believe they call  a <i>passementerie</i> of pearl beads  enriched with lace; a species of garniture which in my eyes obviated the  necessity of any further adornment more pretentious than the simple cluster of  pearls she wore in her ears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  noble and a dignified presence,&rdquo; I thought as she passed, and wondered if the  heart under that violet robe beat any faster than her appearance betokened, or  whether she was indeed one of that class of women in whom the ills and  exigences of life stir but faint chords and produce but slight emotions.</p>
  <p>The  bang of the carriage door was followed by the almost immediate reappearance of  Mr. Winchester.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;to business!&rdquo; And looking up the stairs, he hailed, with a glance of  satisfaction, the descending figure of the young man whom we had before met on  the landing above, and whom he had designated to me as his wife&rsquo;s son.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  Lawrence,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;come down. I sent for you and Miss Irwin&mdash;by the by, where  is she? Oh, I see, looking over the banisters above&mdash;that I might introduce to  you Mr. Byrd, a detective from the police force, whose business here, as you  may judge, is to recover for us your mother&rsquo;s diamonds. It is necessary for you  to know him, for he, as well as myself, has come to the conclusion that your  mother is mistaken in believing that the jewels were stolen by some one  entering from without. Indeed, he is sure that not only is the thief a member  of this household, but that the diamonds are still on the premises, and can be  found by a thorough and systematic search. He is, therefore, going to take  advantage of your mother&rsquo;s absence to put his theory to the test, and as soon  as suitable assistance can be procured from the police station, will begin a  search that will stop at no receptacles, be balked by no place of concealment,  however personal or private. I say this, because I do not wish you or Miss  Irwin to feel irritated if he is obliged to enter your rooms, there being, as  you know, one or two old servants with us whose feelings might justly be  wounded if their persons or belongings were subjected to an examination that  was not shared in by every individual in the house. You will, therefore, be  ready with your keys, and, by setting an example to the servants, make the  efforts of this officer as light as possible. Am I understood, Lawrence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  answer was as nonchalant as the question, which was put with an easy and light  good-nature, calculated to deceive every ear but that of a detective. Indeed  Mr. Lawrence Sutton&mdash;I learned his name afterwards&mdash; seemed to be awakening from  a dream&mdash;and the moment his step-father was gone,&mdash;for Mr. Winchester did not  linger after saying the above,&mdash;he turned and went immediately upstairs just as  if I had not been standing there.</p>
  <p>His  conduct was so unexpected, I paused, irresolute. This was the man Mr.  Winchester suspected, I felt sure, and here he was going, for aught I knew,  straight to the spot where the valuable articles lay concealed whose recovery  and delivery into Mr. Winchester&rsquo;s hands would bring me what I was fain to  consider in these days of my poverty, a small fortune. Should I follow him, or  should I trust to Mr. Winchester&rsquo;s judgment and wait for him to re-descend? The  conviction that I would only defeat my own ends by surprising him too soon,  decided me at last to remain below, and, withdrawing into the reception-room, I  waited, with indescribable anxiety, first for the peculiar call which would  notify me that my colleague had arrived on the scene, and, secondly, for the  returning step of Mr. Sutton. But before either of these sounds assailed, my  ears there came another which aroused my keenest curiosity. This was a noise of  whispering on the floor above, followed by a short, sharp cry of joy in a voice  I felt sure belonged to the young gentleman I had seen. Then all was silence, during  which came the call without, then a rush above as of hurrying feet, after which  I heard no more till&mdash;yes, the eagerly  expected sound of a descending step awakened all my energies, and glancing  through the crack of the door near which I stood, I saw Mr. Sutton coming down  with his overcoat on.</p>
  <p>More  satisfied than I could say, not at this evidence of the truth of Mr.  Winchester&rsquo;s suspicions,&mdash;for Mr. Sutton had a fine air and a countenance which,  if it bore the unmistakable signs of a life of dissipation, had yet an  expression that was not without its attraction,&mdash;but at the result of an  experiment which was almost daring in its nature, I waited to hear the front  door open and close. But I had not calculated on Mr. Sutton being a gentleman  of great courtesy and many resources, and before I was fully aware of his  presence, he was at my side, bowing with extreme urbanity, and holding out a  chain from which I saw several keys hanging.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Winchester has requested me to give you these. By their aid you will be enabled  to open every box and drawer that I own. As for the others, you must find your  own way of entrance and examination. I have an important engagement out which  will keep me, perhaps, an hour. On my return I will lend you all the assistance  I can; for I am naturally as anxious as any one that so valuable a treasure as  my mother&rsquo;s diamonds should not be lost to the family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  bowed and he drew back, taking out a pair of new gloves, which, to my unbounded  astonishment, he stopped to fit on with great nicety and precision. Then he  moved towards the door, but even there he paused and looked up the stairs  before finally putting on his hat and going out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  consummate actor!&rdquo; thought I, and sprang to the window, through which I rather  incautiously peered. He was descending the steps, still slowly, but with more  of an air of determination than he had shown within. In another moment he was  on the side-walk, and in an instant later was walking rapidly down the street.  Hurrying from the window, I went to the front door and opened it. A man was  leaving the area next door, and, before I turned to come in, I had the  satisfaction of seeing Mr. Sutton&rsquo;s tall form closely shadowed by the most  knowing and discreet assistant we have on the force.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  for hours of dreary patience,&rdquo; mused I, sinking into a large easy chair near a  table of inviting-looking books.</p>
  <p>But  scarcely had I uttered this thought than I sprang to my feet in fresh  excitement. Another step was on the stair, another presence in the room.</p>
  <p>Turning  in the full expectation of seeing Miss Irwin, I encountered the gaze of an old  and feeble woman. Surprised, I bowed with respect; upon which she immediately  said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hear that Mr. Winchester has decided to have a search made through the house  for the diamonds that Mrs. Winchester has lost. Is it going to be done to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will have to be done to-night if at all,&rdquo; I returned with pardonable  prevarication, &ldquo;There would be but little satisfaction in undertaking it after  any communication had been established between its inmates and the world  without.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo;  said she, with little or no heed to the latter part of my sentence, &ldquo;may I ask  as a favor that you will make it convenient to go through my room first? I am  Mrs. Winchester&rsquo;s aunt; and I am sure she would not wish me to be kept out of  my bed any later than is necessary. My room is small and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Poor  old lady! it was really cruel. I made haste to relieve her mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  can be no necessity for searching your room&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>
  <p>But  she interrupted me with prompt decision. &ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;If  there is a room in this house which ought to be looked into, it is mine. For  the very reason that it is the last one a detective would examine, makes it  possibly the very one a thief would choose for the purpose of concealment. I  prefer you to go through my room, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  was astonished and not a little perplexed. The old lady looked so determined it  was evident she was not to be trifled with. But I was not ready to explain to  her that the threatened search was but a <i>ruse  de guerre</i>, which had already produced its desired result; and yet, if I did  not do so, how was I to account for a delay that would inconvenience her so  materially? I could see but one way out of the difficulty, and that was to make  a superficial examination of her room and her effects, after which I would  proclaim myself satisfied with my scrutiny, in the hope that she would be so  too. I accordingly answered her that I appreciated her position perfectly, and  that if she would consent to it, I would go to her apartment at once.</p>
  <p>She  signified that she would be only too happy; whereupon I immediately led the way  up-stairs. She followed me up the two flights, and earnestly pointed out the  door of her room. But as I approached it I heard a suspicious sound on the  floor below, and looking over the banisters, beheld the lithe and agile figure  of Philippa gliding down the stairs to the front door. She was dressed for the  street, and had evidently taken advantage of my position to escape from the  house.</p>
  <p>Instantly  a throng of doubts and suspicions passed through my mind. I was the victim of a  plot, and the old lady was neither so innocent nor so disinterested as she  appeared. When she persuaded me to go up-stairs it was with the direct  intention of giving Philippa the opportunity to reach the street unhindered. I  knew it even before I noticed how her feeble and panting form filled the narrow  passage at the head of the stairs, necessitating some slight rudeness on my  part to pass her. But rudeness, even to an aged and decrepit lady, was of small  account in an exigency like this. Twenty-five thousand dollars were in all  probability slipping from my grasp, to say nothing of my reputation as an  astute and not readily deceived detective. And yet, was it now and in this way  the diamonds were leaving the house, or had they already been carried away, as  I formerly believed, by Mr. Sutton? Either might be true, or, as I had time to  think before I was half-way down the first flight, neither might be true. His  departure, and now hers, might be equally a ruse to withdraw attention from the  house and the real concealer of these valuable gems; and, pausing just one  instant in my descent, I looked back at the place where I had left the old lady  tottering from the push I had been obliged to give her in my anxiety to pass.  She was standing there still, but the look with which she followed me was one  of ill-concealed satisfaction, and though she drew back at my first glance, I  had time to observe that a smile had crept into the corners of her mouth that  augured poorly for the success of any design that I might entertain.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  Philippa&rsquo;s hand was on the knob of the front door, and she would have been out  of the house in another instant if she had not stopped to glance at the hat  rack, with the deliberate purpose, as I believe, of hindering me in my pursuit  by appropriating my hat if it hung there. But fortunately for me I had carried  it with me into the reception-room, so her glance as well as her delay was but  momentary. Before I was well at the top of the first flight I heard the front  door close, and knew I had to decide in a breath, as it were, whether to follow  her and so forsake the building and it might be the very gems I was seeking to  recover, or to allow her to go her way unhindered, in face of the equal  possibility of her bearing them away to some place of safer concealment.</p>
  <p>The  thought of Mr. Winchester decided me instantly. If I failed in recovering the  gems by following Philippa, I would but lose my reward and possibly a little of  my prestige as a detective; but if I failed in the same undertaking by not  following her, Mr. Winchester would have the right to reproach me with a  manifest disregard of his orders. For had he not said, &ldquo;Watch who it is who  endeavors to leave this house after your threat to search it, and follow him,  for that person will have the diamonds.&rdquo; To be sure Mr. Sutton had already gone  and was being followed, but if a dozen left after him, especially after  resorting to subterfuge to elude pursuit, would it not be my duty to see that  they were also followed and that with the same care and circumspection I had  thought proper to have employed in his case? There could be no doubt on the  matter; so flinging all other consideration to the winds, I gave myself up to  the pursuit of this flying sprite, closing the front door after me without a  suspicion but that my first glance down the street would show me in what  direction she had started.</p>
  <p>But  neither my glances down the street nor up revealed to me Philippa, and agitated  by my first fear that I had possibly undertaken more than I could accomplish, I  dashed down to the corner, which was that of Madison Avenue, and looking  hastily this way and that, saw on the block below the supple and delicate form  of a female which I had barely decided was hers, when a car stopped and she  stepped aboard and was carried away before I could get breath to cry stop! to  the rather obtuse conductor who assisted her.</p>
  <p>Happily  the next car was not many blocks off, and when I boarded it and found the  driver a man I knew, I felt that the case was not so hopeless as first  appeared. With but little persuasion he consented to urge the horses on a  little faster than the schedule called for, so that in a few minutes we had  drawn up close enough to the car in front for me to see each figure as it  descended. In this way I was enabled to follow Miss Irwin with more  satisfaction than if I had got into the same car with her; and as her ride was  short, I soon was stepping lightly behind her down Forty-fifth Street. She did  not walk two blocks before she stopped, ran up a stoop, rang the bell and was  admitted.</p>
  <p>I  hastened quickly after her, looked at the number and paused confounded. Why,  this was a house I well knew; one which many people visited,&mdash;though not often  on the same errand as Miss Irwin, I must believe,&mdash;one which I had sometimes  visited myself; the home of the well-known minister, Mr. Randall.</p>
  <p>Nonplussed  for the moment, I stood hesitating, when to add to my astonishment a man  stepped up to me from behind, and tapping me familiarly on the back, said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what do <i>you</i> make of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was Hawkins.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  you here?&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certain!&rdquo;  he cried, &ldquo;and my man, too,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was inexplicable. Fortunately there was hope of solving the mystery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I will go in,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I know Mr. Randall quite well. If one or both of  them come out before I do, follow. I will not be gone any longer than is  necessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  nodded and fell back into his hiding-place. I rang the bell and asked for Mr.  Randall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is busy just now, sir,&rdquo; explained the neat servant girl who answered my  summons. &ldquo;But if you will step into his study, he will soon be ready to see  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  needed no second invitation. In a few moments I was ensconced in the cosy back  parlor, listening to the low murmur of voices that came from the room in front  through the heavy folding-doors that separated the two apartments. Of these  voices I could distinguish two; the heavy bass of Mr. Randall, and the lighter,  smoother tones of the young man who had brought me his keys in Seventy-third  Street. Suddenly both voices ceased, and there was a slight bustle, then a  solemn silence, then&mdash;could it be the sound of Mr. Randall&rsquo;s voice again, not in  the conversational tone he had previously used, but in the measured accent he  was accustomed to use in the pulpit. &ldquo;The enigma increases,&rdquo; thought I, and,  regardless of appearances, I crept to the folding-doors and glued my ear  against the narrow crack that marked their line of division. What I heard only  increased my curiosity to the fever point. At all risks, and in despite of all  ordinary proprieties, I must see whom the clergyman was addressing; so,  exerting all my skill and no little of the caution of a professional detective,  I pried the doors the least bit apart and saw,&mdash;what I certainly had not come  there to see, and yet a very pretty sight for all that&mdash;Mr. Sutton and Philippa  Irwin kneeling before Mr. Randall, and that gentleman pronouncing over them the  marriage benediction.</p>
  <p>There  was another lady and two gentlemen in a group about them, but beyond noting  that the lady was Mrs. Randall, and the gentlemen members of the same family, I  did not bestow a thought upon them, my whole attention being given to the man  and woman, whom I had been following under so sinister a suspicion, only to  find myself a witness of the most serious act of their lives.</p>
  <p>The  surprise of the occasion and the touching nature of the whole scene, made me  for the instant forget the diamonds and what my very presence in that spot  implied. But, when the final words had been said, and the few congratulations  offered, the young people faced about and I caught a glimpse of the bride&rsquo;s  countenance, I remembered with a shock the gloomy nature of the shadow which  surrounded them; and while I could not help but give my sympathy to a condition  of things at once so novel and so interesting, I also felt my determination as  a detective return. For Philippa&rsquo;s face wore not the look of a happy bride, but  that of a woman who has just dared everything that some cherished scheme might  be fulfilled or some dreadful ill averted. Indeed, there was terror in the eye  with which she regarded her husband; a terror so mixed with love and the light  of something like hope as she met his glance of triumphant satisfaction, that I  felt I must probe the matter of the diamonds to the bottom if only to solve the  mystery of her action, and the motives by which she had been governed in this  gift of herself at a moment so manifestly unpropitious to happiness and honor.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  Mr. Randall was saying some words of courtesy and farewell, and, seeing that in  another moment his steps might be turned in my direction, I pushed to the doors  at which I was standing, with even a greater caution than that with which I had  separated them, and falling back to my old station on the sofa, I awaited with  equal interest and impatience his entrance and the sound of the young couple&rsquo;s  departure.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Randall appeared and the front door closed at the same time. Resigning Mr.  Sutton and his bride to the care of the man without, I turned my attention to  the clergyman. I knew enough of his character and life to be certain he had not  married them without knowing something of their history and condition, and that  knowledge I meant to have.</p>
  <p>Some  of my readers may not need to be told that I, Horace Byrd, was not always on  the detective force; that I had had my bringing up in different circles, and  that I was by birth and education what is called a gentleman. I speak of this  here to account for the affability with which Mr. Randall greeted me, and his  readiness to satisfy what, under ordinary circumstances, might have been  considered a most impertinent and inexcusable curiosity. He was my father&rsquo;s  friend, and he listened with respect while I made my excuses, and opened at once  upon the subject that occupied my thoughts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Randall,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the errand with which I approach you is of a most singular  nature. The couple you have just married&mdash; pardon me, my ears are good and my  presence here is in connection with that same couple&mdash;lie under a suspicion of  wrong-doing that may or may not lead to consequences of the most serious  nature. What that wrong-doing is I had rather not state, since it is as yet  merely a suspicion from which they may be able to clear themselves. But what I  will say is, that you will be furthering their welfare and assisting at the  unravelment of a most mysterious occurrence if you will tell me what you know  about them, and the causes which led to this evidently hasty and clandestine  marriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am greatly astonished,&rdquo; were his first words; &ldquo;and feel strongly inclined to  ask you what these poor young folks could have done beyond loving each other  and marrying, in despite of the pride and ambitious projects of Mr. and Mrs.  Winchester. But curiosity pure and simple is unworthy of a clergyman, so I will  merely say if they are doing or have done anything that could be called really  wrong I was in complete ignorance of it, and that their marriage is but the  culmination of an intention long known to me if not to the world and that  society to which the groom if not the bride belongs,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;  returned I, &ldquo;you astonish me. They were engaged, then, and you knew it;  something which I can scarcely believe his own mother did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  likely,&rdquo; was the quiet retort. &ldquo;Mrs. Winchester is not one whom a proud man  would take into his confidence if he meant to make what is called a poor and  unequal match.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo;  I began&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo;  he interrupted, &ldquo;a son should show a certain consideration and respect to the  mother who bore him and who always has displayed, as he himself declares,  forbearance to his faults and sympathy for the weakness that caused them. I  know all this,&rdquo; Mr. Randall continued, &ldquo;and I agree with you in your opinion;  but there were certain peculiarities in this special case which offer at least  some excuse for his action and my sympathy with it. Lawrence Sutton was not  always a respectable member of society. He was a wild boy, an extravagant  youth, and a more than dissipated man. His mother loved him but could not control  him, powerful and determined spirit though she is. Nor had his step-father&rsquo;s  position and enormous wealth any influence in controlling passions that partook  almost of the recklessness of the foreign fast society amongst which he was  more or less unfortunately cast. He seemed to be without aspiration, and yet he  was not shallow, nor ungenerous, nor mean. His mother, whose thoughts few can  penetrate, looked on and was silent; his step-father, who had not nature to  help him to a consideration for his faults, showed his anger and threatened to  show him his door but never did. He lived an outcast from the best and showed  no prospect of amendment till suddenly&mdash;it was a year ago&mdash;the greatest and most  startling change took place in his habits and general style of living; and from  being a careless man about town, he became the courteous, careful gentleman,  alive to the place of honor he had lost in society and active in his endeavor  to regain it. His mother, always hopeful for her boy, naturally attributed to her  own quiet influence and unbroken faith this wonderful restoration to manhood  and honor; but I knew better; I to whom human nature has been an open book for  twenty-five years, knew that something fresher and more ideal than any influence  Mrs. Winchester was capable of exerting had led this young man to reject a  course which had become almost a second nature to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frequent  and prolonged visits at Mr. Winchester&rsquo;s house did not serve to explain the  mystery to me. I found Mr. Sutton sitting with the family,&mdash;something which I  had not seen him do for years,&mdash;but how was I to connect this fact with the  presence now and then of the quiet young woman, without any special attraction,  whom Mrs. Winchester once rather carelessly introduced to me as Miss Irwin; and  yet this girl with the subdued look and meek, almost humble aspect, was the  force which had acted on this man&rsquo;s nature and turned its impulses, as it were,  completely about. To him she was the manifestation of all that was ideal and  desirable in womanhood; and from the first moment he saw her, as he afterwards  told me, he made up his mind to win her for his wife if it cost him all and  every indulgence of his hitherto much to be reprobated life. That he cherished  this hope in his heart and did not make a confidant of either of his parents is  not to be wondered at. Mrs. Winchester looks upon Philippa as a dependent; a  being too insignificant to be regarded, much less admired or feared. Nothing,  not even the change in her son&rsquo;s moral life, would ever have convinced her that  this girl possessed influence; or if by any means that belief was forced upon  her, that it arose from any merit or powers she was bound to acknowledge or  respect. A handsome, elegant, worldly-wise woman herself, she sees no  excellence that is not linked to those qualities, and would rather, I verily  believe, have seen her son thrown back into his old course than owe his  redemption to a source so insignificant in appearance and out of all accord  with her own views of what was in keeping with her son&rsquo;s prospects and her own  social position.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  least, this is the judgment I have formed of her, and this the explanation  which young Sutton gave me of his conduct, in an interview he held with me some  six months ago. &lsquo;She&rsquo; &mdash;that is, his mother&mdash;&lsquo;shall know nothing of what Philippa  is to me till she sees her at my side as my wife,&rsquo; was his remark to me at that  time. &lsquo;And that I look to you to make her&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;when by perseverance  and a proper probation I have induced this pure and uncontaminated being to  trust me with her fate and make me what I now believe I am capable of becoming,  a man of purpose, ambition, and social standing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such  hopes, such resolution, and such spirit in a man of his type and with his  record could not but enlist my sympathy. A soul which I had long thought lost  had found its motive to better things, and though this motive was not the  highest, it was high enough to give hope for the continuance of the good work  to the end of all I could fondly wish for him. I therefore entered into his  plans with cordial interest, and though I deprecated his taking any serious  step without at least acquainting his mother with his intentions, I promised  and have kept my word, that when he came to me with Philippa I would marry  them, trusting to his own sense of propriety and her discretion, that the event  would be for the honor and happiness of the family as well as for their own  mutual joy and satisfaction. But what you tell me now disturbs me where I never  thought to be disturbed. They are under suspicion of some evil&mdash;what, I cannot  imagine&mdash;and you know it; which means that it is flagrant, and possibly makes  them amenable to the law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  did not answer this, for I was full of thoughts. Could it be that this pure and  touching story of seemingly true love was destined to be besmirched by the  shadow of crime? Had Lawrence Sutton taken the diamonds, and did Philippa Irwin  know it; or was Mrs. Winchester&rsquo;s story correct, and the deed one of the common  order of burglary?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  adds to my concern,&rdquo; the good clergyman went on, after waiting a suitable time  for me to speak, &ldquo;is that some folks think&mdash; some members of his own family in  fact&mdash;that the change in his nature, to which I allude, is not so thorough as I  have made you understand. They insist that he still carries on his old  practices, but more secretly. And they have a reason for this; for whereas, at  one time, that is, in the beginning of his acquaintance with Philippa, he used  to remain at home during the evening, he has for some months now confined his  attentions in that quarter to Sunday night merely, going out as regularly after  dinner as he used to do in his wildest days of dissipation. Only he does not  come home intoxicated any more, and his eyes, which once looked bleared and  heavy, are now clear and wide-awake. I&mdash;I wish we knew where he is accustomed to  spend his nights.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  we will find out,&rdquo; I assured him, getting up and moving towards the door; &ldquo;and  though I fear the result may not be all we could wish, I will remember your  anxiety and relieve as much of it as is possible to-morrow. I must say  good-night, now, for this matter is not one that will keep.&rdquo; And merely pausing  to thank him for his goodness, I left Mr. Randall and proceeded directly back  to the house of Mr. Winchester.</p>
  <p>My  reflections on the way there were not of a wholly satisfactory nature. If Mr.  Sutton and his bride were in possession of the diamonds, there was no telling  what they would do or where they would go; separate, possibly, and thus put  Hawkins at his wits&rsquo; end as to which of the two to follow. If they were not in  possession of the diamonds, I fully believed I should find them at the house  before me. But that was a contingency only satisfactory to my sympathy; for, if  the gems were not with them, where were they? Not in Mr. Winchester&rsquo;s house by  this time; of that I could be perfectly sure.</p>
  <p>So  it was with anything but a light heart that I rang the bell this time, and  greeting Mr. Winchester&rsquo;s countenance as before, entered again into this  dwelling of mystery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  have come back,&rdquo; were his hurried words, uttered with feverish intensity. &ldquo;And  you? Have you got the diamonds?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  shook my head and hastened after him into the reception-room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you followed him? You know where he is? And Philippa? What took her out, too?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!  I said, &ldquo;have they come back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who?  Lawrence and Philippa?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear they will not come, then.&rdquo; said I.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They?  Why do you associate Lawrence&rsquo;s name with Philippa&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  was spared the answer. At that instant I heard the well-known call of my  colleague without, and simultaneously with this encouraging sound, the click of  the night-key in the door proclaiming the return of Mr. Sutton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  cried I, &ldquo;here they are; and as I am sure they will have something to say to  you which it would embarrass them to utter before a stranger, I will just step  out of sight for the moment.&rdquo; And making a dash for the porti&egrave;re behind me, I  pulled it aside and stepped into the darkness beyond.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Winchester made no effort to stop me; he was too much astonished at the sight  of his step-son entering with Philippa on his arm. And I, who, without  calculation, had stumbled into the first refuge I espied, was equally  surprised, not at what I saw, but at the quarters in which I found myself; for  the porti&egrave;re, instead of shutting off a room, shielded a closet, and it was  amongst a litter of bric-a-brac and old pictures that I now drew myself up,  prepared to listen and to see, since this was all that was left to my  indiscretion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo;&mdash;it  was Mr. Sutton who spoke,&mdash;&ldquo;will you call mother down? There is some thing I  wish to say to her before I take another step in this house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but  no matter about your mother,&rdquo; came in Mr. Winchester&rsquo;s hasty and now deeply  agitated tones. &ldquo;If you have the diamonds, give them to me; give them to me  quickly, and nothing more shall ever be said about them. I am not hard on young  folks, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  diamonds? I know nothing about the diamonds,&rdquo; the other broke in, with an  impatience that was more startling than anger would have been. &ldquo;What I wish to  say is on a wholly different subject.&rdquo; And I judge that he turned with a look  towards Philippa, for the old man&rsquo;s voice became quite shrill as he cried:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you want to say? That you and Philippa are friends? That she did not see you  come out of your mother&rsquo;s room two minutes before the diamonds were missed?  That you are a saint and every one knows it, and she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was  that the voice of a man stained by the meanest of crimes? I pushed aside the  porti&egrave;re and looked out He was standing like a statue of wrath between Mr.  Winchester and the glowing, brilliant, almost transformed Philippa.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  you speak of her,&rdquo; cried he, letting his hand fall on her arm, with the pride  of triumphant possession, &ldquo;you are speaking of my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Winchester fell slowly back. It was the only surprise, perhaps, that could have  taken his mind off the diamonds.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  wife,&rdquo; he repeated, and his eyes slowly traveled to Philippa&rsquo;s face, as if he  found it difficult to take in a statement so unexpected.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutton took advantage of the moment to step to the foot of the stairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo;  he called, &ldquo;will you come here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was already in the hall as he, doubtless, perceived, for he hastened back and  took Philippa by the hand, and was standing thus when the stately woman crossed  the threshold in all the splendor of the rich garments I have hitherto  endeavored to describe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  son!&rdquo; was her first startled exclamation, quickly followed by an indescribable  murmur, as she saw whom he held by the hand, and noted the fervor of that  clasp, and the expression with which he regarded her. &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo;  she asked at length, her hauteur battling with an anger that was yet new, but  terrible in its promise of growth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Happiness,  I hope,&rdquo; was the steady reply. &ldquo;If not, it at least means a better life on my  part and a less humble and dependent one on hers. We are married, mother, and  it is my wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  did not finish; at that word <i>married</i>,  the haughty woman, struck in the full pride of her hopes and ambitious  projects, tottered, and before help could reach her, fell, laying her gray but  queenly head at the feet of her whom an hour back she would have scorned to  associate with herself in any higher connection than she did the inanimate  objects that surrounded her and ministered to her comfort.</p>
  <p>There  was a rush, a hurried murmur, a pause, then a sudden cry so fraught with wonder  and yet so surcharged with triumph, that I could scarcely believe it proceeded  from Mr. Winchester&rsquo;s lips, till a sudden swaying in the bended form of Philippa  revealed to me Mrs. Winchester lying with the neck of her dress thrown back,  and on the throat thus displayed, a glistening cordon of gems which by their  brilliancy and size could only be the famous and costly ones for which we had  been seeking.</p>
  <p>It was  the culmination of the evening&rsquo;s surprises.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  diamonds, the diamonds!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Winchester, and regardless of the still  insensible condition of his wife, he stooped and dragged them from her neck,  and stood holding them out and looking at them, as if he could hardly credit  his good fortune.</p>
  <p>As  for Mr. Sutton and Philippa, they gave one startled glance at the jewels,  another at each other, and then set about restoring their mother.</p>
  <p>I  was the most thoroughly overcome of them all.</p>
  <p>It  took some few minutes to bring Mrs. Winchester back to consciousness.  Meanwhile, I employed myself in looking at her husband. He had by this time  thrust the gems into his pocket, and was gazing at her with a half-sinister,  half-pitying glance. But at the first movement on her part he was all attention  to her, while, on the contrary, Mr. Sutton and Philippa drew back as if they  dreaded to meet her unclosing eye. They might well feel so; it was terrible,  and so was her gesture, as, rising from the sofa on which she had been laid,  she looked about on them all. But suddenly, and before she could speak, she  felt the wind on her throat, and, lifting her hand to it, a great change passed  over her,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who  has presumed&mdash;&rdquo; she began; but here she caught her husbands eye, and losing her  self-possession, felt around for a chair and fell into it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you are looking for your jewels,&rdquo; that husband remarked, &ldquo;I have them. It was a  curious freak to wear them under instead of over your dress, and then to forget  where you had put them and imagine them stolen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  lifted one thin, white hand as if in protest, but her regal spirit seemed  broken, and her eyes filled with something like tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lawrence!&rdquo;  she exclaimed brokenly, &ldquo;what have I not done for you! and this is how you  repay me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo;  said the young man, with a closer grip of Philippas hand, &ldquo;could you ask for  any better repayment than the regenerate life I offer you? A year ago I was the  shame and disgrace of this family; a man for whom the world had scorn and you  only a pitying forbearance. To-day I can walk the streets and drop my eyes  before no man&rsquo;s glance; I am a man again, and this&mdash;this dear woman is the  cause. Is it not enough to make you overlook the trifling disadvantages which  annoy your pride but cannot affect your heart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Mrs. Winchester&rsquo;s nature was not one to be touched by any such appeal as this.  Indeed, it seemed to restore some of her former hauteur.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  mothers love was then insufficient to recall you to a sense of what you owed  yourself and her? My sacrifices, my sympathy, my endeavors to uphold you in  face of the disapprobation of the whole world were as nothing to you. You had  to wait till a puny girl smiled upon you, a waiting-woman, a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo;  broke in the son, this time with severity in his tone, &ldquo;Philippa is a lady; she  is, moreover, my wife, and so of equal social station with yourself. Let us not  be bitter but thankful. For me, an angel has stepped into my life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was not wise, but when was love ever wise? Mrs. Winchester&rsquo;s face hardened, and  a reckless smile broke out on her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  angel that has brought ruin to me,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;What confidence do you suppose  there can henceforth be between my husband and myself since he has found I can  deceive him, and deceive him for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  you can play with my heart, trifle with my pride, marry my waiting-maid before  my eyes, never asking whence came the freedom which enables you to do all these  things, or what price your mother is paying for the sins her forbearance was  not sufficient to make you regret and forsake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother,  what do you mean? I do not understand you at all. What price have you been  paying for sins of mine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  smiled ironically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is time you showed some curiosity on the subject.&rdquo; Then, with a side glance at  her husband, full of bitterness and despair, she went on: &ldquo;Did you ever ask  yourself where the money came from with which I paid your debts two years ago,  in Paris?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;that  is, I supposed, of course, it came out of your own pocket. Mr. Winchester is a  rich man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I, his wife, must therefore be a rich woman. Well, I may be; but even rich  women do not always have a hundred thousand francs at their disposal; and that  sum I gave you, and you took from me. Where do you think I obtained it? Not  from him, as his face only too plainly testifies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where,  then, mother&mdash;where, then? Tell me, for I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Mr. Winchester had taken a step forward, and his face was very white.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  her answer my questions,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You gave your son, that scapegrace, a  hundred thousand francs, two years ago, in Paris?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  bowed her head, trembling with something more than wrath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was a great sum,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;a great sum! I do not wonder you hesitated to  ask me for it. He would never have got it, never. I wonder that you found any  friend willing to throw so much money to the dogs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was not a friend,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;O William!&rdquo; she went on, with almost a  pleading sound in her voice, &ldquo;we have never had any children, and you do not  know what it is to love a son. To see him in peril, disgrace, or necessity, and  not seek to relieve him, is impossible. You must make allowances for a mothers  heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  this money&mdash;these thousands&mdash;where did they come from, where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  flushed, and her head drooped, but her natural haughtiness soon lifted it again.  Rising, she asked, in her turn&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Winchester, why did you send for me to-night, as I was dressing for the  reception, and, after inquiring if I were going to wear my diamonds, say it was  your pleasure that I should do so, and then add, that you wished to borrow them  of me to-morrow as you desired to show them to a dealer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?  because&mdash;&rdquo; It was his turn to flush now&mdash;&ldquo; because I do wish to show them to a  dealer&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what has a dealer to do with my diamonds?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;a  freak of mine. I took a notion to find out just what they were worth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; Her voice was very low, her eyes burned on his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  approximately, madam, approximately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  glance she had fixed on him, fell. She took a step nearer, but did not speak at  once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Why do you hesitate to answer my questions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;William,&rdquo;  said she, &ldquo;were it not more to the point to ask why I, who have always been  considered an honorable woman, should resort to the subterfuge of stealing my  own jewels in order to escape the delivery of them up into other hands?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;  he muttered; &ldquo;but we will not go into that. No woman enjoys parting with such  gems as these even for a few days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  laughed. &ldquo;But a woman does not resort to crime, run the risk of police  investigation and submit to such indignities as are inflicted upon her by the  so-called detective agent, for the mere sake of retaining in her possession  jewels of any price. She must have another motive&mdash;a motive of terror lest an  evil greater than these should come upon her&mdash;the loss of her husband&rsquo;s love or  trust, the&mdash;the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madam, what have you been doing? What secret underlies all these words?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  little one; only a little one. William, do you intend showing that necklace to  a dealer to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  to ascertain its value.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  had better not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  he would laugh in your face. William, the gems are false&mdash;false; there is not a  diamond amongst them; only glass, worthless glass!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  stared at her incredulously; he tore the jewels from his pocket and held them  up to the light. Their flash and brilliance seemed to reassure him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are making sport of me, madam. See how they sparkle and throw back the light.  Only diamonds shine like that. You do not wish me to take them away from you.  Perhaps you fear you may lose them permanently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  tell you they are false,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;I had the exchange made in Paris. I  received a hundred thousand francs and these imitations for the necklace. Had  not the man who manufactured them been an expert, do you suppose I should have  dared the experiment of wearing them as I have done, for a whole year now, at  every large assemblage I have attended?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Millicent!  Millicent, is this true?&rdquo; He looked more than angry, more than dismayed. She  herself seemed astonished at the intensity of the emotions she had aroused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she returned, &ldquo;it is true.&rdquo; And her glance took in the face of her son standing  abashed and troubled beside his bride. &ldquo;This I was doing for you,&rdquo; she  declared. &ldquo;While you were seeking inspiration and delight from the smile of  Philippa Irwin, I was meeting the eyes of the world with a circle of false gems  about my throat, and in my heart the dread of such a scene as this, with its  worse to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  words now. I have done with you, Lawrence Sutton; let me see if I am to lose a  husband as well as a son.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Mr. Winchester was in no mood for sentiment. He had flung the glittering bauble  from him, and was standing with clenched hands and working brow near the  threshold of the door. As she spoke he flung the door open, and when she ceased  he gave her one look, and passing out into the hall, disappeared from view.</p>
  <p>She  stood still and made no effort to follow him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the deception,&rdquo; I heard her murmur. &ldquo;He could not care for a few thousands  so much as this.&rdquo; And then her haughty lip trembled, her imperious air gave  way, and tottering toward the door, she held her two hands out in seeming  forgetfulness of everything but her love for her husband. &ldquo;William!&rdquo; she cried,  &ldquo;William!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  her son was already between her and the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo;  he exclaimed, &ldquo;you shall hear me. Indifferent as you consider me to have been,  this debt I have owed you has weighed heavily upon me. Of course I knew nothing  of the sacrifice you had made in giving me the large sum you did. I supposed it  came, as you led me to suppose, from your husband; but, even so, it has  troubled me and caused me many an anxious thought as to how I was to repay you.  I did not find a way. But to prove to you that my remorse did not expend itself  entirely in thought, I will now reveal to you the secret of my absence night  after night. I am working, mother, working like a slave, for a position which,  if once obtained, will give me support for my wife, and a pretty sum over every  year for my mother. There is a likelihood that I shall get it, and if, in that  event, I allow myself one luxury or Philippa one gewgaw till those you parted  with for my sake are paid for, then say you are done with Lawrence Sutton, but  not now, not while there is any hope of his proving himself your son, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the barrier he had raised between them by his marriage was too formidable to be  overthrown in an instant; and with some parting words of scorn she left him,  and I heard her go up to her own room.</p>
  <p>I  hoped they would follow her, and so allow me to escape, but they had too much  to say to each other, too many explanations to make. I had to be present at  another confidential interview. Philippa, who, the moment they were left alone,  had assumed a totally different bearing from that which seemed natural to her  in Mrs. Winchester&rsquo;s presence, waited for her husband&rsquo;s first emotion of grief  to subside, then turned to him, and taking his two hands in hers, drew him down  beside her on the sofa.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lawrence,&rdquo;  said she, with a womanly sweetness inexpressibly winning after the scene of  stormy passions which had just passed, &ldquo;do you think you can ever forgive me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forgive <i>you</i>, my heart&rsquo;s idol! What have I to  forgive you for? The consolation that you give me for my past, the hope that  you bring me for my future?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no,&rdquo; she murmured; &ldquo;for having married you; for having&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philippa!&rdquo;  he cried, lifting her face with the tenderest touch, and gazing long and  earnestly into her eyes, &ldquo;you are my wife. The holy words that made us one have  hardly ceased to echo. Do not let us mar the moment, which can never come  again, by any expression of doubt as regards the wisdom or the happiness of  what we have done. Let us enjoy the delight of being all in all to each other,  leaving to future hours, perhaps, the grief of knowing that, in seeking our own  welfare, we have had to inflict disappointment upon others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;  she faltered, &ldquo;you do not understand. I allude to my marrying you tonight, in  this haste, contrary to all my declarations and every resolution I had formed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  do you think I blame you for that? That my heart gave anything but a leap of  joy when you stopped me in the hall and whispered in my ear, &lsquo;I am ready,  Lawrence, ready to do what you so often have urged me to do. I will marry you  to-night if you say so&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  she cried, and a flush of shame crept over her face, growing lovelier with  every moment that passed till I wondered I had not seen at first glance that  she was beautiful; &ldquo;you reproach me with every word; you make me feel that there  is no one less deserving of such faith and devotion than Philippa Irwin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philippa  Sutton, darling; there is a difference,&rdquo; he smiled.</p>
  <p>The  words seemed to strike her. She looked at him very earnestly for a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she assented. &ldquo;What were wisdom in Philippa Irwin may not be wisdom in Philippa  Sutton. But truth is always wisdom, and I cannot enter upon our married life  with the shadow of a falsehood on my heart. At the risk of losing your love, of  seeing you turn away from me never to come back, I must be frank with you and  open to the very hearts core. Lawrence, I would not have married you to-night  if&mdash;if it had not been for the disappearance of those diamonds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philippa!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know, I know I should have trusted you. That I should have seen and felt that  you were incapable of doing so mean and wicked a thing as&mdash;as my suspicions  suggested to me, but, coming up-stairs while your mother was below, I had seen  you pass into her room on tiptoe, stay but a moment, and then come creeping out  again, thrusting something that glittered into your breast. I had seen this;  and though I thought nothing of it at the moment I&mdash;I did fear and tremble when  from the back room, into which I had stepped, I beheld her come back, walk over  to the mantel-piece where she stood for a moment gazing at her jewel-case, and  then, rushing to the window and throwing it open, run out again into the hall  crying that her diamonds were gone, and that a thief must have crawled in from  the street and taken them while she was below. For&mdash;it is my only excuse,  Lawrence &mdash;I could not dream she had taken advantage of that moment&rsquo;s pause  before the mantel to snatch the jewels from their case and hide them in her own  bosom. That would imply a knowledge of facts and motives to which I was necessarily  a stranger. I could only think she was influenced in her action by a conviction  that one she loved had done this act, and this apparent conviction of hers  awakened mine; for she was a woman and a mother, and knew, as I believed, her  own son well, while I was but a simple girl who loved. Yet see, yet see, she  was the one who did the wrong, if wrong were done, while you&mdash;&rdquo; Philippas head  sank on her breast and the tears came.</p>
  <p>He  let her weep for a moment; then with a slow and mechanical motion he thrust his  hand into his breast and took out a simple bracelet made of silver coils and  held it towards her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is what I went for,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and this is what I brought out. I had seen it  lying on the sofa, Philippa, when I went in before dinner, and my heart coveted  it and my lips burned to kiss it, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O  Lawrence!&rdquo; was her cry, &ldquo;my bracelet!&rdquo; and then there was silence, during which  he sat with his eyes on her face in a mute reproach, evidently worse to her  than death. At last she could bear it no longer, and lifting her head she gave  him one look.</p>
  <p>It  seemed to recall him to himself. Grasping her hand, he uttered one short  sentence, but that was full of meaning. It was this: &ldquo;And yet you married me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  pallor of her cheek disappeared in a flush that made her absolutely dazzling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  loved you,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;and I knew, that is, I had heard, that a wife could  not be called upon to testify against her husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  gave a sudden cry, and his arms closed passionately round her. He did not tell  her that that was an old and antiquated law, no longer in force at this day; he  only whispered words of love and consolation, and when, ten minutes from that  time, they left the room and I at last succeeded in escaping from my  hiding-place and from the house, it was with the conviction that I had left two  noble hearts behind me, whose happiness, if not their worldly prosperity, was  assured.</p>
  <p>Early  the next morning I sent a line to Mr. Randall effectually relieving him from  all the doubts I had left in his mind as to Mr. Sutton&rsquo;s integrity and genuine  change of character. This duty done I thought the story ended, as far as  outsiders were concerned. But it was not so. Scarcely three days had elapsed  when New York society was startled and her business men confounded by the announcement  that Mr. Winchester had disappeared from town, leaving debts of an enormous  nature behind him and no assets wherewith to pay those debts. Then and not till  then did I understand his passionate anxiety about the diamonds. To a man on  the verge of ruin twenty-five thousand dollars may hold out the promise of  salvation. At all events it is a convenient sum with which to facilitate  flight, and its loss must have been a heavy blow to him.</p>
  <p>His  wife, whose pride was perhaps phenomenal in its way, never recovered from the  shock thus given her. When the last load was driven away from the house she was  obliged to abandon, her indomitable spirit broke, and it was a depressed and  humiliated woman that at last consented to take up her abode with the son she  had cast off and the woman she once looked upon with contempt.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="OneHourMoore"></a>One Hour  More</b></h2>
  <p>I  WAS walking along the Rue des Martins. I was thoughtful, for I had just been  witness to a sight that greatly moved me. My duties as a reporter for one of  the large Paris dailies had taken me to Havre just as the ship came in which  brought the Communists home from exile, and, hardened as I confess myself to be  to the more frequent aspects of human suffering, the sight of those men  crowding forward to catch the first glimpse of the friends who had come to meet  them, touched me with a feeling that was not unlike compassion. I was thinking  of them and wondering what sort of fate awaited the older men I saw there, when  a sudden cry from over my head startled me from my musings, and looking up, I  saw a woman peering out of the top window of a wretched apartment.</p>
  <p>She  showed such signs of distress in her countenance that I at once knew something  terrible had occurred within, and foreseeing matter for my next article, I  immediately entered the house.</p>
  <p>I  found myself confronted by frightened faces everywhere. All the inmates knew  that something was wrong on the top floor, but no one knew just what. They  followed me when they saw me determined to find out. The consequence was that a  small crowd pressed behind me as I mounted the last stair; a crowd that seemed  to awe if not alarm the trembling woman who awaited me at the top, for she  started back as she saw it, muttering to herself:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu!</i> Elise never had so many  visitors before!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  door swinging on its hinges at the right of this woman at once attracted my  attention. Advancing with small ceremony, I threw it open. I found my  expectations more than realized. On the bed before me lay the outstretched form  of a woman, the pallor and fixedness of whose face bespoke death. Not a natural  death either, for she was dressed as if she had just come in from the street,  with the exception of her bonnet, which lay on the floor beside her, where it  had evidently been flung by a careless hand. Otherwise the room was in perfect  order, I may even say in holiday order. From the work neatly folded on the  shelf to the small bunch of fresh flowers that adorned a table set out with an  untouched meal&mdash;a meal which even in the hurried glance I gave it I saw was  arranged for two&mdash;all bespoke one of those rare days of rest and relaxation  which now and then enter a French working-woman&rsquo;s life.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700631h-images/page081.png" width="734" height="750"></p>
  <p>But  the dead face on the pillow&mdash;what did it betoken? Had murder crept into this  humble dwelling or was it a suicide I beheld? Involuntarily drawing nearer the  bed, I looked at the face before me more closely. It was that of a young and  pretty woman, and while touchingly meagre and sad was touchingly delicate also.  It was almost a lady&rsquo;s face, and had it not been for the evidence of toil displayed  by the hands I should certainly have taken it for such. As it was I could not  doubt that a real working-woman lay there, though from the marks of refinement  observable in her dress and the presence of certain choice books on the shelf  over her head, she was evidently a woman of taste and education.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a suicide!&rdquo; I declared, seeing a bottle of well-known poison protruding from  under the pillow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course it is,&rdquo; murmured a voice over my shoulder. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see what she has  written on that paper near you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  glanced down at the table by which I was standing and saw a sheet of common  note paper, inscribed with these words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  husband was a Communist and was exiled. He was all I had in the world, and  since his departure I have only lived to see him again. But I have had no news,  no letter. I have been patient, however, for I have waited for this day. But it  has come, and it has not brought him. I went to the ship myself and looked at  every man who left it. He was not amongst them. So now I know he is dead. That  being so, there is no more reason why I should live.<br>
    Elise Picard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Involuntarily  I had read these words aloud. A murmur of almost ferocious sympathy greeted  them from the crowd that had gathered at my back. The sound disturbed me, for  my thoughts had flown at once to the ship and that throng of pale and eager men  I had myself seen in the morning. I felt a strange inclination to be alone, and  shouldering my way out past the humble table set so touchingly with a meal  never destined to be eaten, I made my way into the hall.</p>
  <p>But  before I could reach the stairs a woman advanced and laid her hand on my arm.  It was the same who had given the first alarm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  you mind stepping into my room a minute?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;There is something I  would like to show you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naturally  curious, I followed at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it?&rdquo; I inquired, when we were shut in an apartment of even scantier  proportions than the one we had just left.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  some letters which Elise put into my hands a little while ago&mdash;before&mdash;before she  showed herself so tired of life. You see we had been neighbors here, and Elise,  though she was far above me&mdash;she was born a lady, Monsieur&mdash;was kind to me, and  told me many of her griefs. I could not appreciate them all, for I never was  educated; but I do know what it is to love, for I had a good husband myself  once, and so when she spoke of him I could understand. And there was not a day  she did not speak of him. It was as if he always stood at her side. Her very  eyes had a faraway look, as if she was seeing something more than the rest of  us did. I used to have an awe of her, especially when she smiled to herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700631h-images/page085.png" width="669" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is very sad,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;And did she never hear from him after he was taken away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  She never doubted that he lived, though, and would come back. &lsquo;I feel it here,&rsquo;  she used to say, laying her hand on her heart. &lsquo;Why else do I live?&rsquo; she would  add. Only yesterday her face was like the sunlight. &lsquo;I am sure he will come  home with the rest,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;and then I shall know why he did not write.&rsquo;  Did you see how she had his dinner ready? I went with her to market, and it was  touching to hear her say, &lsquo;I must get this,&rsquo; or &lsquo;I must get that; he used to  like it so well.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you go with her to the wharf?&rdquo; I asked, willing to learn all I could.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Monsieur. She didn&rsquo;t seem to want me to. But I shall never forget the look she  gave me as she went out of the door. There wasn&rsquo;t any doubt in it. To my  foolish mind it seemed to say, &lsquo;I shall never be lonely in this room any more.&rsquo; <i>Mon Dieu!</i> when I think how that look  must have brightened when she saw the poor wanderers crowding forward out of  the ship, and then have faded away to what it was when she came back alone, my  heart is ready to break.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  saw her, then, after her return?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  moment. She came to my door with the letters you have there. As soon as I saw  her I knew what had happened, but I couldn&rsquo;t speak. My tongue seemed to cleave  to the roof of my mouth. You see, I had been as sure as she that he would be  there with the rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t  you say anything then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a word; she didn&rsquo;t give me a chance. &lsquo;My husband is dead,&rsquo; was her greeting as  she opened the door. &lsquo;I looked in the face of every one of the exiles as they  left the ship, and he was not there. I want to leave these letters with you; they  were meant for him.&rsquo; And without looking me in the face she laid the package  down with a slow stiff movement, as if she were already half dead herself, then  went out and closed the door. There was something in her look which told me not  to follow her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  weren&rsquo;t you afraid of what she would do? Didn&rsquo;t you fear she might commit  suicide?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir. Yet if I had I don&rsquo;t think I should have followed her.&rdquo; Then as I looked  up surprised the good woman hastened to say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a sadder story than you think. If you care to hear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  did not wait for her to finish.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me all you know about her,&rdquo; said I.</p>
  <p>The  woman eagerly complied. The facts which she gave me, together with a few others  afterwards gleaned by me from a different source, form the basis of the following  history, a history which I am sure you will pardon me for giving in my own  words rather than in those of my informants:</p>
  <p>Elise  Lepage was not a beauty, yet in her earlier youth, at least, she possessed a  charm which always insured her the admiration and very often the love of those  with whom she came in contact. Her father, who was a musician of somewhat  mediocre talent, recognized this charm, and in his simple way calculated upon  its winning her a suitable husband, notwithstanding his small means and her  consequent lack of a dowry. To him she was a paragon, and when, at the close of  a long day of unremitting labor at the piano, he saw her approaching him in a  dainty fresh robe ready for their usual walk on the boulevard, his face would  light up with such pride and joy that the loving girl who watched him felt the  tear gush to her eye at the same moment the smile rose to her lip.</p>
  <p>They  lived in a plain but sufficiently comfortable apartment, and had for neighbors  two young men by the name of Picard,&mdash;brothers. These two young men occupied the  apartment above them; and one of them, the youngest, having some taste for  music, a natural acquaintance had sprung up between him and M. Lepage, which  presently involved the older brother and Mile. Lepage. The consequence was that  Jean, the elder brother, fell in love with the fresh, charming young girl, and,  being himself a man of no conventional prejudices&mdash;the future Communist in  fact&mdash;he offered to marry her without any other fortune than that of her youth  and many virtues. The old father was delighted. First, because he felt himself  failing in health and was anxious to see his darling&rsquo;s future secured; and  secondly, because he liked this man better than any one else in the world save  and excepting always his dear and much admired daughter. Why he felt this  extraordinary affection for a man of whom he was forced to acknowledge to  himself he knew but little, he could not have told had he tried. Certainly it  was not because he understood him, for he did not; neither was it because the  other possessed attractions of a peculiar or marked nature. Jean Picard was not  handsome, nor was he even gifted in manner or conversation, yet old Mr. Lepage  loved him and hailed the prospect of his being his son-in-law with as much fervor  as if he were the owner of millions instead of being the physician of one of  the poorest and worst paying quarters in the whole city. He trusted him, and  that fact, perhaps, illustrates the character of the two men. For Jean Picard  was to be trusted in all matters of the heart and conscience; it was only his  head that was at fault, or, perhaps, I should say his temperament. He had  inherited traditions of the First Revolution, and believed absolutely in the  might of the people. But of this he had nothing to say in those days, his head  and his heart being joined in the one wish, the one hope, the one purpose, to  make Elise his wife.</p>
  <p>The  evening which he had chosen to speak to M. Lepage&mdash;he had never breathed a word  of his desires to Elise herself&mdash;was, as he afterwards remembered, an especially  beautiful one. The moon was shining, and as, filled with the joy of a  successful suit, he stepped from the apartment of M. Lepage, something in the  quiet beauty of this round and serene orb touched the poetry that exists with  all true love in the heart, and drew him, in spite of his usually active ways,  to a window opening from the corridor on to a small garden belonging to the <i>concierge</i>. He was looking from this  window and dreaming of Elise, when his glance, which had been mechanically  fixed upon a leafy retreat beneath him, became earnest, deep, and inquiring,  and with a startled gesture of surprise, he bent forward and listened as if his  life depended upon his hearing what went on in the garden below him. Had he  seen anything which threatened his happiness, and if so, what?</p>
  <p>His  firm and controlled countenance tells little, but his wandering look and the  unsteady step with which he leaves the window and betakes himself to his own  room bespeak strong agitation. If we follow him and watch him as a half hour  later he slowly rouses from the deep and troubled brooding into which he had  sunk immediately upon his entrance, and turning towards the door, waits with a  look not to be mistaken for the advance of the step just becoming audible upon  the stairs, we shall undoubtedly learn from his own lips what it is that has  disturbed him so deeply at a moment he esteemed himself so profoundly blessed.</p>
  <p>Yet  is he going to speak? His lips have opened, his face has assumed a terrible  expression, he has even advanced two paces toward the door to meet the expected  comer, when suddenly he pauses. The face he sees before him is not the one he  anticipated. It is that of his brother, to be sure, but it does not wear the  look he had schooled himself to meet, the triumphant look that goes with happy  love, however wrongfully it may be won. The surprise upsets him, and for a  moment the words falter on his tongue, then all his manhood reasserts itself,  and imperiously beckoning his brother to enter, he closes the door and stands  with the handle still in his grasp, looking at Camille.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are in trouble,&rdquo; said he shortly. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Then as he saw his brother  start and uneasily drop his eyes, added bitterly: &ldquo;Have you told her what you  are, and does she refuse to marry you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Camille,  who was of a fiery nature, but who for certain reasons stood somewhat in awe of  his brother, looked for a moment as if he could have leaped at his throat; but  he restrained himself, and while the veins swelled on his forehead and his face  grew fiery red, he stammered:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whom  do you mean by her? I do not understand you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is not true; you understand me perfectly,&rdquo; was the rude but brave Jean&rsquo;s  straightforward response. &ldquo;But if you must have names I allude to Elise, the pure,  innocent, high-minded girl whom by arts I do not profess to understand you have  succeeded in pleasing, till, for aught I know, she considers you a model of  virtue and goodness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  if she did?&rdquo; broke in the other impetuously.</p>
  <p>Jean  drew a deep breath and stepped slowly back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should undeceive her,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;if by the act I alienated her good-will  forever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Camille,  who for some cause did not resent the first clause of this sentence, started at  the second, and gave his brother a sharp look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed he, with as much wonder  as jealousy in his tone. &ldquo;Do you love her too?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  look which Jean turned upon his brother made that other&rsquo;s weak and selfish  heart stand still.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  love her,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will not say <i>too</i>,  for you do not love her. Had you loved her you would have fled from her instead  of using all your arts secretly to win her. A criminal&mdash; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;  exclaimed the other, with a terrified look around him that for some reason made  Jean quail with a sense of apprehension. &ldquo;Do you want to draw the police upon  me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a stride Jean advanced upon his brother, and, laying his strong hand on his  shoulders, uncompromisingly turned him towards the light</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  tremble,&rdquo; he muttered under his breath. &ldquo;You shrink, and your face is like  marble. <i>Mon Dieu! </i>Camille, is there  anything new?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a suppressed cry Camille tore himself from his brother&rsquo;s hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  has given you the right to question me?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I will not have it. I have  had enough of your spying.&rdquo; And flinging himself violently towards the door of  his own room, he was on the point of disappearing from Jean&rsquo;s presence, when  the latter, with another movement of his strong arm, drew him back and himself  entered the apartment.</p>
  <p>In  an instant he came back. His face was like stone, and he had in his hand a  valise fully packed, which he set heavily down on the table before Camille&rsquo;s  eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does this mean?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Where are you going and why have you kept your  departure a secret from me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  a moment the stricken Camille did not reply; then he broke down, and flinging  himself on his knees, burst forth with the cry:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am a ruined man, Jean; I&mdash;I tried it again, and this time it will be found out.  Tomorrow, to-night, possibly, my employer will look over his books, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  much is it?&rdquo; broke in Jean, in a low, strained voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten  thousand francs,&rdquo; murmured the other. &ldquo;All gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lost  at play?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Camille  nodded his head.</p>
  <p>Jean  drew back, covering his face for a moment with his hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have just that amount,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;saved up. Your employer shall have it  to-morrow. As for you,&rdquo; he added bitterly, &ldquo;I wash my hands of you. This is  twice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  voice broke, and he hurriedly withdrew to the window, as if the sight of his  brother&rsquo;s face maddened him.</p>
  <p>He  returned almost instantly, however, and walking straight up to Camille,  demanded:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  were you doing there?&rdquo; pointing sternly below. &ldquo;This bag shows you intended to  abscond to-night. Were you bidding her farewell or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  had not strength to finish, but his look filled up the hiatus left in his  speech.</p>
  <p>Camille  faltered beneath that glance. If he could have seen a way to escape, his  furtive, worried look showed he would have availed himself of it. But his  brother&rsquo;s eye held him and would have the truth. With a gasp he broke forth:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have bidden her farewell. She does not know why I go. She loves me and she  trusts me. I&mdash;I would have persuaded her to go with me if I could. I love her, I  say, whatever you may call it. I love her, do you hear, and if I could have  induced her to leave her father you would not have caught me in this box. It  was my despair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  stopped. There was something in Jean&rsquo;s face which told him that silence was  better than speech at this moment The first words of Jean convinced him of it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a villain,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and the punishment of your villainy shall be a  confession. I hope to marry Elise Lepage,&rdquo; he went on, raising his hand for  silence as he saw his brother about to protest, &ldquo;and I do not intend she shall  waste her life in useless regrets over the loss of one so unworthy as yourself.  Come, then, and in her presence, if not in that of her father, proclaim  yourself the criminal that you are or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  what?&rdquo; asked the other, with a wild gleam, half of defiance, half of fear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  I keep my ten thousand francs and leave you to the tender mercies of a man  whose justice, you have reason to know, is stronger than his mercy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  cold sweat broke out on Camille&rsquo;s face. He looked at his brother with great  staring eyes as if he could hardly believe in the alternative that was offered,  him. Seeing it, Jean continued:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is three years since the day I first awoke to the knowledge that I had for my  brother a man who had provoked the justice of the law, and only escaped by the  ignorance or blindness of those he had defrauded. In those three years I have  spared nothing, either in the way of money or effort, to give you what you  wanted and save you, if possible, from the repetition of your dastardly crime.  How have you repaid me? By stealing the fancy of the woman I loved, or,&rdquo; as  Camille faintly objected, &ldquo;the fancy of a girl whom you knew I respected, and  whom you also knew would never have given you her regard had she known your  real character or suspected the shadow that hung above you. She thinks you  true, you say, and trusts you. That means she will remember you lovingly in  your absence, possibly wait for your return, when return you never will. Elise  is too fine a girl to be thus sacrificed,&rdquo; asserted Jean, &ldquo;and if I did not  love her I should still say, &lsquo;Come below, and show yourself to her for what you  are.&rsquo; Better she should suffer this one shock, that in itself carries healing,  than linger on for years a prey to a pain of longing that will be none the less  keen because it will be so bravely hidden.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Camille had sunk before this prospect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;I would rather go to the galleys.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meantime,  in her own little room below, Elise was bitterly weeping. She had loved Camille  almost unconsciously. Not till she saw him about to leave her did she realize  how deeply he had entered into her dreams and hopes. Then the mystery of his  departure heightened its effect. Though the ready tale he told of the fine  position which had been offered him in a mercantile house in Peru was plausible  enough, there was something in his manner and the fact that he wished to carry  her away with him secretly that struck an icy doubt to her heart, and, devoted  as she was to him, she felt as if she would give all the world, were it hers,  to throw herself into her father&rsquo;s arms and ask him for his sympathy and  counsel. But that was expressly forbidden. Her father must know nothing of her  sorrow or her love; her wilful lover would not have it. And young as she was,  innocent as her thoughts were of wrong or deception, there was something in  this ban laid between her and the father she so idolized, that awakened strange  doubts and fears in her otherwise trusting bosom.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700631h-images/page101.png" width="617" height="750"></p>
  <p>Her  room adjoined that of M. Lepage, and more than once during her grief and tears  she had heard his restless foot approach the door of communication, as though  he were about to call her to him. But he did not; she was so quiet he evidently  thought she was asleep, and finally all became as still in his room as it was  deathlike in hers. And Elise wept on.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  there came a tap, not on the door she had been so fearful of seeing open, but  on the one which led into the hall. Astonished, frightened almost, she crept to  it and faintly asked who was there. A woman&rsquo;s voice answered. It was the  concierge, who handed her a small note. Hurriedly lighting her candle, Elise  unfolded it and read:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Mademoiselle&mdash;It  is indispensable that I should have a few minutes&rsquo; conversation with you  to-night. It is 10 o&rsquo;clock, therefore your father has retired and your little  sitting-room will be free. I shall not come alone.<br>
  Respectfully, Jean Picard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  whirl of thoughts swept through Elise&rsquo;s brain. She felt dizzy, almost sick, but  she did not hesitate. Opening the door into her father&rsquo;s room, she glided in.  All was quiet. The good man was evidently asleep. Hastily crossing the floor,  she gained the little sitting-room beyond, and, closing the door behind her,  struck a light. Then, stopping but a moment to regain breath and still the  nervous beatings of her heart, she approached the hall door and softly opened it.  A low cry escaped her as she did so, the two men standing on the threshold bore  in their countenances such signs of subdued agitation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it?&rdquo; she faintly breathed, falling back with a slow step as they entered. &ldquo;Why  are you here so late? And together?&rdquo; she could not help adding, as her eyes  roamed from the one face to the other, both so white, both so drawn, both so  filled with that strange look which a woman only sees on the countenance of the  man who loves her.</p>
  <p>As  Camille did not answer, Jean replied:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;I have come here on a very disagreeable duty. I have come to hear my  brother tell you the truth. Camille, speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Camille,  thus abjured, cast one glance of burning anguish at his brother, then in a  voice so unnatural Elise could scarcely believe it his own, exclaimed bitterly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  wishes me to tell you I am a villain. It is not a pleasant thing to say of  one&rsquo;s self, Mademoiselle, but it is true. I am a villain, and&mdash;and I advise you  to forget me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  deep misery expressed in his tones shook Jean a little, but he was inexorable.</p>
  <p>Giving  one glance at Elise, who, seemingly turned into stone by the terrible nature of  her lover&rsquo;s words, stood breathless and pale before them, he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not enough, Camille; tell her why you go away to-night Tell her it is a  flight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have said it,&rdquo; murmured the other, half savagely; then as Jean remained  unchanged in look and attitude, cried harshly: &ldquo;Mademoiselle, I am unworthy of  your attention. I&mdash;I am no longer an honest man. I&mdash; have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stolen,&rdquo;  added a deep, firm voice.</p>
  <p>The  silence that followed this word was such as could be felt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you wished to take me with you!&rdquo; were the words that first interrupted it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  love you,&rdquo; murmured Camille in a broken, miserable tone.</p>
  <p>Elise  turned slowly away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  father! my father!&rdquo; burst involuntarily from her lips, and she held out her  arms in dumb entreaty to the door that separated her from her beloved parent.</p>
  <p>Instantly  and as if in answer to her appeal, a strange murmur arose from that room, an  inarticulate, almost an agonized murmur that struck terror to the hearts of  those who heard it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  father!&rdquo; again cried Elise, and this time she rushed at the door and tore it  widely open. Her father lay stretched before her on the floor, having evidently  fallen in his efforts to answer her summons.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
  <p>It  was midnight, two hours after the fatal event recorded in the above lines.  Around the bedside of M. Lepage were grouped a physician, a priest, the  concierge, Jean Picard, and his daughter. Camille was already far away.</p>
  <p>The  physician had given them no hope. In an hour or less the poor musician&rsquo;s soul  would be far away. He was sensible of it himself. Upon his first return to  consciousness he had said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Elise,  overwhelmed as she was, could not weep. Her one thought seemed to be:  &ldquo;Supposing I had listened to Camille&rsquo;s entreaties, and had been flying from  Paris in this terrible hour!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jean  Picard, on the contrary, shed more than one tear. Perhaps the restraint he had  put upon himself in the tragic scene which had preceded this catastrophe was  having its revenge upon him now, or perhaps the look of peace with which the  old man surveyed him and his daughter, standing, as they were, side by side,  struck him by its contrast to the sad reality. It was midnight, as I have said,  and the clock was striking. As it ceased, the dying man spoke:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I not see your two hands joined?&rdquo; he asked, gazing tenderly at Jean and Elise.</p>
  <p>As  though a thunderbolt had fallen at her feet, Elise started and fell back. Jean  hastily cleared the room and then leading her gently up to the bedside, he said  solemnly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle,  you must pardon your father. Three hours ago I had the honor to ask of him your  hand in marriage, and he had the goodness to accord it to me. He does not know  that we have had no conversation on this matter since, and that therefore such  words must fall upon you with a shock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you&mdash;were you&mdash;&rdquo; she stammered, &ldquo;thinking of this when you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo;  interrupted Jean, &ldquo;whatever I have ever done or said has been more for your  sake than my own; believe that.&rdquo; And he threw a glance at M. Lepage which she  could not fail to understand.</p>
  <p>Hiding  her face in her hands, Elise knelt by the bedside. She could feel her father&rsquo;s  hand fall on her head, caressingly, lingeringly. In a minute more she heard him  say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is a good man; you will marry him, Elise?&rdquo; Then as she did not answer, he added  softly, &ldquo;I should die so happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a spring she stood upright. &ldquo;Jean Picard,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do you wish me for your  wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  great light which she could not help noticing in that solemn hour settled  slowly over all his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is nothing I wish so much,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;it has been my dream for  months.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  what you know of my heart?&rdquo; she murmured, but so low the dying man could not  hear her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elise,&rdquo;  was the equally low answer, &ldquo;I do not expect you to love me just yet, but you  need a protector; let me be that protector. You need some one to comfort you  and provide you with a home; let me be that friend, and I will trust my love to  make you satisfied in the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a good man,&rdquo; she murmured, in unconscious repetition of her father&rsquo;s words;  and, scarcely knowing what she did, she laid her hand in his, seeing more  clearly the smile that parted her poor father&rsquo;s lips at the action than the  solemn look above with which Jean Picard accepted the trust thus imparted to  him.</p>
  <p>And  so it was that Elise Lepage became the wife of Jean Picard, and a tragedy of  the heart was begun which ended, as we have seen, in her death. For Elise was a  conscientious woman, and once married set all her hopes on the prospect of some  day becoming as much a wife in heart as she was now in name. But that heart was  at first too sore with the violent wrench it had sustained to experience much  beyond gratitude, and months rolled by without Jean Picard discovering in his  young wife&rsquo;s studiously kind manner any token of that passion which informed  his own life. Yet the germ if not the flower of it was in her breast.  Unconsciously to herself her husband was becoming all in all to her, but the  feeling she experienced for him was so different from that she had given to his  unworthy brother that she did not recognize it for what it was, and called it  simply friendship.</p>
  <p>The  stirring events of the war and the opening days of the Commune did not alter  matters. A numbness seemed to settle upon Elise as she saw her husband  gradually identifying himself with a cause she both mistrusted and feared. That  her coldness drove him into the savage warfare of the barricades she did not  think. She knew him well enough to perceive that, however it was with others,  with him it was a matter of conscience to uphold what he called the rights of  the people And perceiving this, she did not lose her respect for him, though  her terrors accumulated and an element of dread came into her regard for him  which caused her less and less to suspect the true nature of the emotions he  inspired.</p>
  <p>Nor  did the culmination of his career and his subsequent downfall fully awaken her.  Like a dream the dreadful days passed in which he was tried, condemned, and  sentenced to exile; like a dream came the time of parting. And not till she  felt herself torn from his clasping arms did she realize that life was ending  for her, that the moment of death had come and she had never told him she loved  him. Making a vigorous effort, for her senses seemed to be leaving her, she  turned, all tremulous with passionate feeling, and holding out her arms to him,  was about to utter what would have illumined his exile, when doubt, that black  shadow of the soul, glided again across her spirit, and, saying to herself, &ldquo; &lsquo;Tis  but a boundless regret at the loss of his goodness,&rdquo; she permitted herself only  to cry:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-by,  Jean. I will be true to you in your absence, and work if need be with my own  hands, to sustain myself till you come back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  sad smile told her, when too late, what she had done, or rather had omitted to  do.</p>
  <p>The  memory of that smile never left her. It haunted her day and night. The struggle  into which she was forced for her daily bread only served to perpetuate her  remorse. From a somewhat practical woman she became a dreamer of dreams. All  her soul centred in the one wish, the one hope of seeing him again, if only to  whisper in his ear the truth that was every day becoming more and more apparent  in her own heart. She dared not write it to him. The first few dutiful letters  she had sent had never been answered, and she was of a temperament that made it  impossible for her to risk the chance of her heart&rsquo;s story falling into alien  or unsympathetic hands. But she could not entirely smother her desire for  utterance. So the letters came to be written, which, though never sent,  contained the beatings of her heart through that long and dreary separation,  letters which she evidently fully expected would meet his eyes, and tell him in  sweetest language what her own tongue had failed to do on that memorable day of  their parting.</p>
  <p>But  hope cherished to the last, went suddenly out like a candle extinguished. The  ship which was to bring the exiles home arrived in safety, and she saw it and  saw them, but did not see him. The blow was fatal. Without asking a question,  or doubting the doom which had fallen upon him and therefore upon her, she  returned home and put, as we have seen, a desperate end to her own life. Love  long repressed had had its full revenge. She could not live without its object.</p>
  <p>Such  was the story of Elise Picard, told me in substance by the good woman who had  befriended her and in detail by the letters she had left behind her in this  same woman&rsquo;s charge. I had scarcely reached the end, that is, had scarcely laid  the last letter down, when a sudden hubbub rose in the hall without, followed  by a pitiful low moan which somehow or other awoke in me a peculiar apprehension.  Springing to the door I flung it open. Never shall I forget the picture that  met my eyes. Frozen each in his place by some great emotion, the eager crowd  before me stood silent, aghast, gazing at a figure that, emaciated almost  beyond the semblance of a man, crouched against the wall which led towards the  room of death.</p>
  <p>The  hush, the intolerable anguish expressed by that form, bent almost double by the  sudden weight of woe which had fallen upon it, touched me to the quick.  Grasping the hand of the first person I could reach, I asked: &ldquo;Who is he? What  does this mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  I did not need an answer to my question; I knew without words that Jean Picard  stood before me.</p>
  <p>I  learned afterwards that he was among the men that passed before her eyes on the  wharf, but he was so changed by disease and grief she had not recognized him.  He had been spending the last two hours in a search for her.</p>
