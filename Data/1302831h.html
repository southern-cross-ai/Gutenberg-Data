<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; HORSE LIGHTNING</h2>

<p class="first">AT the table in the Winton ranch house sat three
men and a woman. All the men were more or less formidable outside
the house, but inside it they were all in fear of that one woman.
Ned Winton feared his wife a little more than did his twenty-year-old son, Everard. Ned's brother, Clay Winton, who had been a
paying guest of the ranch for four years, was so accustomed to
being the target of his sister-in-law's attacks that he had
developed a good deal of skill in making retreats from such
battles.</p>

<p>A charge was about to be made now, and all three men knew it.
They could tell by the fixed smile on Mrs. Winton's face that
trouble was in the air.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winton wore a mask of pleasantness which, she felt, was a
perfect disguise, but which flecked the blood of all the others
in the family with cold. She might have been carved in ice, and
the dim blue eyes of the three Winton men were fixed upon
her.</p>

<p>"How was your day, Everard?" she began.</p>

<p>He was working every day in town, in the blacksmith shop.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was a good day enough," said the son. "Plenty to do.
We had to weld a break in the coupling of Tom Walter's big iron
wagon. It was heavy to handle, but we managed it."</p>

<p>"Was that the job that made you so late coming home?" asked
the mother.</p>

<p>Uncle Clay Winton glided in swiftly and gently. He said:</p>

<p>"That was one of the biggest two-man jobs of welding that I
have ever seen. Reminds me of a time in Dodge City when a new
prairie schooner outfit was getting ready for the plains, and
along come some bohunks with wagons with iron frames. One of 'em
took and tumbled over the edge of the creek, where"</p>

<p>"Dodge City, again!" sighed Mrs. Winton.</p>

<p>Her glance was as bright as fire; it might have burned the
very soul of a person less callous than Clay Winton.</p>

<p>"Well, Dodge City was Dodge City, in the old days," said Clay
Winton. "Mighty few things that didn't happen there, one time or
another. The days when Wild Bill Hickok was town marshal"</p>

<p>"Seems to me," said Mrs. Winton, "that you talk as though you
were there yourself! You weren't even born when Wild Bill Hickok
was murdering his poor victims!"</p>

<p>"Now, Martha!" said Clay Winton. "You ought to be a little
kinder and milder, when you refer to a hero like Wild Bill. I've
known plenty of men who were friends of his. A finer gentleman
and a truer man there never was none!"</p>

<p>"He murdered a hundred men.Ain't that one of your boasts about
him?" demanded the mother.</p>

<p>Uncle Clay leaned back in his chair as though overcome by
despair. Then he rallied, shrugged his shoulders, and returned to
the defense, saying:</p>

<p>"He never murdered anybody, Martha. Nobody ever dared to say
that Wild Bill done murder. He was on the side of the law. That's
what he was!"</p>

<p>"I have it out of your own mouth&mdash;and if you know
anything you ought to know the history of Hickok; how he shot one
of his own best friends in the street!"</p>

<p>"Why, Martha," said Uncle Clay, "it happened this way"</p>

<p>"I don't want to hear how it happened! Murder is murder," said
she.</p>

<p>Uncle Clay looked to the ceiling and made a two-handed gesture
of surrender that was almost Oriental in its expressiveness.</p>

<p>The mother turned upon her son.</p>

<p>"Everard," she said, "what would you be callin' it?"</p>

<p>Said the boy, "Wild Bill was incapable of a dishonorable
act."</p>

<p>"Incapable, fiddlesticks!" said Mrs. Winton. "You got just a
lot of Clay's nonsense into your mind, is what you've got.Murder!
Red murder is what it was!"</p>

<p>"Mother," said the boy, "Bill Hickok never took an
advantage"</p>

<p>"What else did he take?" exclaimed Mrs. Winton. "The devil
that loved him taught him to be a dead shot. Ordinary men didn't
have a chance against him. It was murder&mdash;not duelling! He
wouldn't of had the nerve for a real stand-up fight with a man
that was his equal!"</p>

<p>"There was no fear in him," answered her son, his face
darkening, and a gleam coming in those misty eyes which were so
typical of his race.</p>

<p>He would have said more, but Clay Winton caught his eye and
made a warning gesture. Everard looked back to his plate.</p>

<p>"You don't need to shut up my boy at his own table, Clay,"
snapped Mrs. Winton. "He can speak his mind for himself, I
hope&mdash;unless the only mind he's got is what you've put into
his head!"</p>

<p>Clay looked to his brother and Ned Winton stirred uneasily and
put up a hand to stroke his long mustaches. Then he said:</p>

<p>"The fact is, Martha, you're bearin' down pretty hard, ain't
you?"</p>

<p>"It would make a saint bear down!" said Mrs. Winton, flushing
with anger.</p>

<p>Uncle Clay put in, genially, smoothly, "Speaking of the old
times, I saw a sight today that would have stirred the blood of
Dodge City&mdash;every man and woman in it. Harry Lawson has come
back from his horse hunt, and he has the horse with him!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Winton parted her lips to continue the flow of her
harangue, but the family was familiar with her fits of temper and
by long practice they had worked up perfect team-play; so now Ned
Winton hastily broke in.</p>

<p>"You mean that red stallion&mdash;the pacer?"</p>

<p>"I mean the Red Pacer," said Clay. "What a horse!"</p>

<p>"It's not one of those pretty things that the ladies love the
minute they clap eyes on it," he went on. "It's an inch over
sixteen hands, and you can see the whole machine. You can see the
frame of that horse and the muscles that pull on the bones, is
what you can see. He could take a standing jump and sail over the
moon, is what he looks like."</p>

<p>"Nacheral pacer, ain't he?" asked Ned Winton.</p>

<p>"He is," said Clay. "And a nacheral bunch of dynamite, too. I
seen Buck Sanders and a Mexican puncher by name of Miraflores,
and they both tried to ride him, today. There wasn't nothing to
it. He just exploded 'em into the air, and then he went sailing
off to the far end of the corral and looked through the bars and
cocked his ears at the mountains. They've built up the corral
fence to nine feet. He'll jump anything up to eight!"</p>

<p>"If he can't be rode how was he caught?" asked Ned Winton.</p>

<p>"They trapped him. A dozen of 'em snagged him," said Clay.
"Harry Lawson spent about every penny that he's got in the world
to land that stallion."</p>

<p>"A pile of use it'll be!" said Mrs. Winton. "A hoss that can't
be rode!"</p>

<p>"There's a worth in things that can't be used," said Clay. I
reckon that Harry'd give that hoss away to anybody that could
ride it, fair and square, without pullin' leather. But there's a
worth in things that can't be used."</p>

<p>"What worth?" snapped Mrs. Winton. "I'd like to know what
worth!"</p>

<p>"Why," said Clay, "you can't eat a diamond necklace, can you?
But it's good to look at, all the same. He had the fun and name
of hunting the red hoss down. I reckon a thousand punchers have
seen the Red Pacer on the edge of the sky, and wished their
hearts out to have him. But it was like chasing lightning to
chase him."</p>

<p>"I'd like to put a saddle on him. I'd like to try him," said
Everard Winton, slowly.</p>

<p>He spoke so quietly that his mother barely heard him.</p>

<p>"What's that you say?" she snapped.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "I'd like to try my luck with the
Red Pacer," he answered.</p>

<p>"And get your neck broke?" she inquired, angrily.</p>

<p>"I hope not," said the boy.</p>

<p>Again he looked to his uncle, and received the warning sign.
But Mrs. Winton also had seen the check of the shaken head, and
she was more furious than ever.</p>

<p>"You can waste your time ridin' wild horses&mdash;you can't
waste your time coming home and helping with the chores, like a
right-minded boy would do," she exclaimed. "D'you say that you
were kept late in the blacksmith shop, this afternoon?"</p>

<p>Before Everard could answer, and he was habitually slow in
speech, his uncle replied:</p>

<p>"Well, Martha, if you'd seen your boy wrestling with that iron
beam and treating it like a stove poker, you wouldn't be asking
questions. Tom said he never seen a finer piece of welding done
by nobody."</p>

<p>Mrs. Winton raised a forefinger.</p>

<p>"Everard!" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother?"</p>

<p>"If you was down there in the shop, weldin' iron beams
together, then was it the ghost of you that I seen fighting that
big hulk of a Berner boy behind the barn?And your precious uncle
standin' by and lookin' on&mdash;encouragin' you to a brutal
waste of your time?"</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; SUSPICIONS</h2>

<p class="first">THE silence of disaster settled coldly over the
four at the table. Mr. Ned Winton looked gloomily down at his
plate, and shook his head wearily. Only his wife was on fire with
cruel triumph.</p>

<p>Everard spoke first. "I didn't lie to you," he said. "I didn't
say that I was in the shop all the time."</p>

<p>"You'd of sat and let me think so, though," cried his mother.
"That's what you'd of done. Your precious uncle, there, could
talk about the welding work as though that had kept you. It
wasn't welding; it was breaking that you were doing. Trying to
break heads and bones with your fist&mdash;swasting your
time&mdash;fighting like a regular animal."</p>

<p>Her emotion and lack of breath stopped her.</p>

<p>"What in thunderation is all this about, anyway?" demanded the
father. "It ain't that big Rudie Berner that Ever was fighting,
was it? Why, Rudie's six three, and made like an ox."</p>

<p>"Fighting! Fist fighting!" stormed Mrs. Winton, the shrillness
of her voice sending the blood up to swell and redden in her
face. "Right out behind the barn&mdash;right when I needed help
in the milking and in getting in the wood&mdash;right out there
behind the barn I peeked around and seen Ever fighting Rudie
Berner with his fists."</p>

<p>"We were only boxing, mother," said Ever Winton, looking at
her with a strangely cold eye. "We had on six-ounce gloves."</p>

<p>"Fighting!" she insisted. "With your Uncle Clay Winton
standing by and encouraging both of you. D'you think you can
hoodwink me, Clay Winton? D'you think you can say it wasn't
fighting?"</p>

<p>Clay Winton, who had said nothing, canted his head to the side
and endured the assault.</p>

<p>"You can't bamboozle me!" exclaimed Mrs. Winton. "I got the
eyes that God gave me. Didn't I see Rudie Berner beat my boy to
his knees? Didn't I see Ever jump up and whang Rudie till Rudie
Berner lay against the side of the barn with his hands down?"</p>

<p>"It was a right hook," murmured Clay Winton, dreamily. "A
beauty, on the button! That turned the trick."</p>

<p>"Ever," demanded Ned Winton, with a grin, "did you lick that
big whale of a Rudie Berner?"</p>

<p>The grin maddened Mrs. Winton.</p>

<p>"And you're praising him for slacking his chores and fighting
and lying to me!" she cried.</p>

<p>Everard pushed back his chair from the table. Again his uncle
made the negative sign, and again Mrs. Winton saw it. This time
the slender remainder of her patience was entirely exhausted and
she cried out:</p>

<p>"Clay, don't you go to shutting up my boy in his own house!
Let him talk out!"</p>

<p>"I'll talk out," said Everard Winton, as deliberately as
before.</p>

<p>"Clay Winton!" shrilled Mrs. Winton. "I'll have you know"</p>

<p>Everard lifted his hand, and the pain in his face stopped her
at last.</p>

<p>"Maybe you're right, Uncle Clay," said he. "I won't say
anything. I'll just go out and take a walk."</p>

<p>"Go out and take a walk?You set down right this minute and
finish your supper!" commanded Mrs. Winton.</p>

<p>"I'll go take a walk, I think," said the son, insistently.</p>

<p>"Ned!" she cried out. "Are you gonna let that boy defy you
like this?"</p>

<p>Everard was already through the screen door and stepping onto
the back porch as his father answered:</p>

<p>"He's twenty, and growed up. I can't treat him like a baby no
more."</p>

<p>Mrs. Winton turned on her brother-in-law.</p>

<p>"It's you!" she exclaimed. "It's you that has done it all!
It's you that's taking him away from his own flesh and
blood!"</p>

<p>Clay Winton was a long-suffering man where women were
concerned, and particularly with his brother's wife. But now even
his patience gave way a little. He said:</p>

<p>"You gotta remember, Martha, that half his blood is Winton
blood, and that's what runs in me.</p>

<p>He stood up in turn.</p>

<p>"I'll be stepping out," he said.</p>

<p>"And go and walk with my boy? And raise up his heart agin me?"
cried Mrs. Winton. "Ned, are you just gonna set there and see
things like this happen under your own roof?"</p>

<p>Ned Winton sighed and leaned back in his chair with his eyes
closed.</p>

<p>"Oh, Martha, Martha!" he said. "Wouldn't you leave it be for a
while?Wouldn't you let it drop?"</p>

<p>Clay Winton passed through the door in his turn, and his
footfall went across the porch and down the steps, sounded
hollowly along the board walk, and then disappeared from
hearing.</p>

<p>A silence came over the dining room. Mrs. Winton was still
red-faced and panting, but there was alarm in her eyes.</p>

<p>"There had to be a time," she said. "There had to be a time.
It's just what I've suspected for a couple of years. Clay's
corruptin' our boy."</p>

<p>"Martha," said her husband, "a boy that can be corrupted ain't
worth the saving. That's all I've got to say. I'm gonna go and
cool off."</p>

<p>He stood up from the table, but she ran around it and stood
before him, gripping him by both sleeves.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ned!" she said. "Suppose that something would happen to
him. I'd die.I wouldn't live none, if anything happened to him;
an' neither would you. We're all wrapped up in him. And
now&mdash;it's shooting and fist-fightin'. And next thing you
know he'll go and take and ride that Red Pacer&mdash;and have his
neck broke!"</p>

<p>He put his hand on her head and waited until he was no longer
choked by the pain in his throat. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Well, Martha, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll forbid him
from riding the Red Pacer."</p>

<p>"That's something!" she said, eagerly. "It'd be something more
if Clay'd decide to take and live in another place."</p>

<p>"I'm goin' out on the front porch," said Winton. "I'll wait
there and speak to Ever when he comes back in."</p>

<p>He left the dining room as he spoke, and Mrs. Winton sat down
at her place, with the tears working down her face unheeded. At
last she sighed, gave her shoulders a short, quick shrug, and
settled down to finish her supper.</p>

<p>After she had washed the supper dishes and dried thema task
which Everard generally performed&mdash;she went out to the front
porch and sat for a moment beside her husband.</p>

<p>"Ned," she said, "I want to ask you something."</p>

<p>"Yes?" he said, wearily.</p>

<p>"I wanta ask you where Clay really got all his money."</p>

<p>"Mining."</p>

<p>"That's what he says."</p>

<p>"Are you going to doubt his word every time he speaks?" asked
Ned Winton.</p>

<p>"You know, Ned," she answered, "that lying comes dead easy and
nacheral to lots of folks. And I notice little things&mdash;I
notice a pile of little things."</p>

<p>"I know you do," he replied, sourly.</p>

<p>"Ten years ago," she said, "Clay went West, smooth-shaved.
Four years ago he came back, and started to grow a beard and a
mustache. Then a year ago he shaved off the mustache."</p>

<p>"Can't a man please himself, wearing his face rough or
smooth?" asked the husband.</p>

<p>"I'm not a fool, talking to hear myself talk. In the old days
Clay always was wild. He had to have girls, dancing, liquor. And
now he lives like an old man."</p>

<p>"He's sowed his wild oats," said her husband, sadly.</p>

<p>"Hot blood never grows cold," she answered. "But now Clay
lives like a rat in a whole&mdash;just like that! He don't leave
the ranch once a year, hardly."</p>

<p>"What about it?" demanded her husband, irritably. "He's lazy,
maybe. But he's made his pile and he can afford to be lazy, all
right. That's his business. What are you upset about?His sitting
around and his mustache?"</p>

<p>"You don't put things together," she objected.</p>

<p>"What do you make out of it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You remember when Clay came back the first time, full of
money? He'd made it prospecting and mining, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Done it for years, and finally hit it rich?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's true."</p>

<p>"Well, Ned, you ever look at the hands of a miner?"</p>

<p>"Sure I have."</p>

<p>"What about 'em?"</p>

<p>"Calloused like leather. Why?"</p>

<p>"You remember the hands of Clay when he came back?"</p>

<p>"Can't say I do."</p>

<p>"Well, I remember them, though," she said. "They were as white
and soft as the hands of a</p>

<p>"Humph!" muttered her husband.</p>

<p>"Can you put two and two together?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"I ain't a suspicious sort of a fellow, Martha," he answered,
uneasily.</p>

<p>"Maybe not," she replied, "but it's as plain as the nose on
your face.It's been plain to me all the while, Clay never dug a
penny out of the ground. Faster and easier pay was what he was
after. That's the kind of money he's got, and that's the kind of
money hell send our boy after!"</p>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; NOT HIS OWN
MASTER</h2>

<p class="first">NED WINTON considered this idea for a moment.
Then he replied:</p>

<p>"I dunno, Martha. It's hard to know what's on the inside of a
man like Clay, that don't talk nothing except what he wants to
talk. I've always noticed that.But leave him be. People like
Clay&mdash;you're always best off to leave 'em be. Even when he
was a kid, we all of us noticed that it was best to let him
alone. He'd set as quiet as a mouse till somebody came and riled
him. Then he'd raise trouble. Nobody ever raised as much trouble
as he could raise."</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Mrs. Winton. "I guess they're comin' back now.
There they are, beyond the oak tree. Now, Ned, I don't ask you to
do nothin' except about the tiding of that Red Pacer. That's all
I ask. You lay down the law there. You tell Everard that he don't
dare to try to ride that horse. There's gotta be a time when a
boy learns that what his parents say is law."</p>

<p>"The pacer is a murderin' beast," declared the father. "I know
that, all right. I'll tell Ever not to go and try to ride
him."</p>

<p>"Lay down the law!" whispered Mrs. Winton. "Go and tell him
that&mdash;that he's gotta obey&mdash;or get something that'll
bring him to his senses. Something that'll show him that his
Uncle Clay is leadin' him all wrong."</p>

<p>She hurried back into the house and left Ned Winton squirming
a little. He disliked the duty that had been laid upon him; on
the other hand, he was not one to shirk responsibilities. Like
most men, he felt that his wife knew more than he did about the
proper raising of youngsters.</p>

<p>Through the gate that opened on the road came the figures of
his brother&mdash;easily recognized, even in silhouette, by his
slouching walk&mdash;and the erect, light-stepping form of his
son. They moved down the path, and Ned hastily packed a pipe and
lighted it, as a means of letting them know he was there.</p>

<p>"Hello, father," said Everard, in the quiet voice of one who
has been thinking of important things.</p>

<p>"Hello, Ever," said he. "Come here a minute, will you?"</p>

<p>The boy came to the foot of the steps and paused there. It was
hard to see him by the dimness of the night light, for there was
no moon in the sky; but it seemed to the father that his features
stood out more clearly than if the sun had been beating all about
him. From his infancy, there had been something clean and fresh
and radiant about the lad. Sometimes Ned Winton thought it was
because he was their only child; that all their love and yearning
for a family had been poured into this one mold.</p>

<p>"It's about that Red Pacer," said the father. "You know, Ever,
that's a damn dangerous hoss."</p>

<p>"I've heard that," said the boy, his tone constrained. "But
you know the saying?"</p>

<p>"What saying?"</p>

<p>"'Every horse can be rode&mdash;every man can be
throwed.'"</p>

<p>"I've heard that," said the father, "and there's sense in it,
too&mdash;which is more than there is in a lot of things.
Speakin' about throwin', you know what the Pacer done to Indian
Murphy? He broke six or seven ribs and smashed a leg and a collar
bone.</p>

<p>"You know what kind of a collar bone Murphy's got now? Silver,
or something. That bone was busted so bad that it couldn't be
hitched together again. They had to splice up the pieces with a
silver tube, is what they had to do. Murphy, every time he has a
fall nowadays, he gets a dent in his chest&mdash;and the dent
don't go away. He's gonna die of consumption before long, I
hear."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for that," said Everard Winton.</p>

<p>"Well," remarked his father, I was just leading up to a point.
Don't you go and be a fool and try to ride that stallion."</p>

<p>"But you see, father," the boy replied, "I sent word to Harry
Lawson I'd be sure to come over and try my hand with the
Pacer."</p>

<p>"Then you send him word that you've changed your mind, said
Winton.</p>

<p>He noticed that his brother was saying nothing, his head
turning a little from side to side as he marked the
conversation.</p>

<p>Then the boy was saying, "It's hard to send him word I've
changed my mind. He'd think"</p>

<p>"It ain't no matter what he thinks," said the father. "What I
think and what your ma thinks is what you oughta do, just now.
There's no good in a wild-caught mustang stallion. Sometimes
they've been rode, but I dunno one that ever gave no satisfaction
to his master. Likely to turn any minute and put a hoof through
you. Likely to get you off and savage you. Ever seen a man
savaged?"</p>

<p>"No," said Everard.</p>

<p>"Well, you don't want to see it&mdash;and no more do you wanta
be it. Don't you go near that hoss and make a fool of yourself,
Ever."</p>

<p>He settled back in his chair and sighed. He drew out a
bandanna and mopped his wet brow. Later, he was sorry that he had
done this. It showed that he was too worked up over the matter.
He had wanted to make it a casual affair and not underline its
importance.</p>

<p>The boy answered, "It wouldn't matter, father, very much,
except that I've said I'd be there. And besides"</p>

<p>"Besides what?" snapped Ned Winton. "I'll drop by the Lawson
place, tomorrow. And I'll tell him that I wouldn't let you go. I
reckon I'm old enough to know what's right for you to do."</p>

<p>"But you haven't seen the Red Pacer," remarked the boy,
quietly.</p>

<p>"I've seen plenty of hosses," said the father. "One's as good
as another&mdash;pretty mean."</p>

<p>The boy did not answer at once. These pauses that he made were
somehow characteristic. They made all of his words seem to come
from his heart.</p>

<p>"A man on that horse," he said, "would be like a king on a
throne, father!"</p>

<p>Ned Winton struck his fist into his open palm.</p>

<p>"I tell you," he said, "that it's come to a point where you
got to know that you ain't your own master till you're of age.
Don't you go near that damn hoss! Understand? Don't you dare to
go near it!"</p>

<p>He waited. He could hear his heart thumping. The wind stirred
and the moist, warm breath from the fields of spring reached him
with the scents of growing grass and the kind, fruitful
earth.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Ever," murmured Clay Winton, as the boy turned
to leave.</p>

<p>"It's no good waiting," replied the boy. "I'm afraid I know
already that I have to ride the Red Pacer&mdash;or break my neck
trying!"</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; THOROUGHBREDS</h2>

<p class="first">WORDS broke out from the father in a rush.
"Everard, if you won't obey me, then I'm through with you! You
can go your own way, is what I mean. Either you're my boy or you
ain't my boy. You been four years followin' Clay like a dog at
the heel. You been his shadow. He's been more than teacher,
father, mother and friends to you. I don't like it, and I ain't
gonna have it. You hear me talk?"</p>

<p>"I hear you," said the boy, coldly.</p>

<p>He waited for more words, but his father had run out of them.
Those the older man had spoken echoed in his ears, and he could
hardly believe that the stern utterances had been his own.</p>

<p>"You go on to bed," he muttered in conclusion, and heard the
voice of his son coldly bid him good night. Everard passed from
view around the corner of the house.</p>

<p>With a sore heart, Ned Winton said to his brother, "This is
some of your doings, Clay."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the other. "What have I had to do with it,
Ned?"</p>

<p>"You know what you've had to do with it," insisted Ned. "He's
been around with you all the time. He's got your wild ideas."</p>

<p>"You figure," said Clay, "that the only way to live is to work
till your bones ache. You get the ache in the bones, all right,
but you don't get much life."</p>

<p>"I've got a farm and cows on it and plenty of saddle-stock.
Everything's fenced up and fixed right, and I started with
nothing," boasted Ned.</p>

<p>"You work like a dog every day of your life," said Clay. "But
what's the good of owning a thing that makes a slave of you? You
don't own the place; the place owns you! I have enough to live
on, as far as that goes."</p>

<p>"How'd you get it?" snapped Ned.</p>

<p>"Why, out of the mines."</p>

<p>"You never was a miner!" declared Ned.</p>

<p>"Hello!" murmured Clay Winton.</p>

<p>"You never had hands that were that hard."</p>

<p>"Martha's been talking to you, Ned," said Clay.</p>

<p>True accusations annoy us, always, far more than idle ones.
Ned Winton grew hot at the mention of his wife.</p>

<p>"Leave Martha out of it!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to leave her out," answered Clay.</p>

<p>"She ain't good enough to please you, maybe?" demanded
Ned.</p>

<p>"She's all right," said Clay. "I'm going on to bed."</p>

<p>"All right, go to bed," said Ned Winton. "Only&mdash;leave
your hands off of Ever, will you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Clay Winton, suddenly.</p>

<p>He turned and came quickly back to his brother, climbing the
steps of the veranda. They stood face to face, each watching the
glimmering eyes of the other.</p>

<p>"You won't, eh?" said Ned.</p>

<p>"As long as I stay here," said Clay, "I'm gonna keep on doin'
what I can for him."</p>

<p>"Teach him to make a fortune the way you did? You dug it out
of wallets. A six-shooter was the tool you used for breaking your
ground."</p>

<p>Clay paid no attention to the accusation. He said:</p>

<p>"What a fellow does with his money is just as important as how
he gets it. You've worked like a dog; you'll have to keep on
working. You'll go into the grave like a tired old hoss that
ain't ever known a thing but harness and blinders and the furrows
ahead of it. God, what a life for a human being! Wintons are
meant for better things than that. They're meant to fly higher
and freer. In the old days the Wintons were gentlemen."</p>

<p>"You think a man with callouses on his hands can't be a
gentleman, eh?" declared Ned Winton. "Because your own damn lazy
hands are soft, maybe you're a gentleman, are you?"</p>

<p>"I'm lazy and worthless," said Clay, with surprising
frankness. I never done anything worth while, and I know it. I
had a bit of fun, but I never knew enough to enjoy life the way
it oughta be enjoyed. I never studied or read enough; I never
worked hard enough with my brain. There's only one good thing
that I've started; but I'm gonna finish it&mdash;in spite of
you!"</p>

<p>"What have you started?" asked the other.</p>

<p>"I've started Ever. And I've worked on him for four
years."</p>

<p>"And what good have you done him, I'd like to know?"</p>

<p>"I came back and looked at him," said Clay, It and I seen that
he was a thoroughbred hitched to a plough. I walked him right out
of the ploughing field; I put him into training. I've got him
almost ready for the race track and the big stakes!"</p>

<p>"You want to make him like yourself!" said the father,
savagely. "A hell of a thoroughbred you ever were!"</p>

<p>"You're only calling me names," said Clay Winton, "and the
names you throw won't break my skin. I say that when I came back
here I found Ever a poor lump of a kid, a little bit dull and
sad, and not knowing what was the matter with him. I tell you
what I've done for him; I've started him working at
books&mdash;every evening he's been workin' in 'em. I couldn't
tell him where to start, but he went out and got the right
advice. I started him to watchin' his language, till now he
speaks a good clean English. I've made him watch out for his
clothes, too, and now he looks like something. I've taught him
that whisky is poison, but that it can be handled. I've taught
him not to boast or talk big or loud or to swear or to use
slang.</p>

<p>"I've used myself as a model of what not to be. I've worked on
his training, too. He can jump higher, run faster, box better,
ride cleaner, shoot quicker and straighter than anybody around
here. A man that he can't throw he can knock down. He's fit to
stand anywhere in the world and to be taken for a gentleman,
which is what his blood calls for him to be. For three
generations the Wintons have been rooting in the ground like
pigs. I've fitted Everard for something better."</p>

<p>It was a very considerable speech, and Ned Winton grew more
and more angry as he felt the justice and truth of some of Clay's
remarks. At last Ned said:</p>

<p>"I'll tell you how it is. You're satisfied with your own
ideas, you think they're fine.Well, I don't. I tell you just
this&mdash;keep your hands off of Ever from this minute on."</p>

<p>"I won't," said Clay.</p>

<p>"Then get out of my house and get out of my life," said Ned
Winton.</p>

<p>"You mean that?" said Clay.</p>

<p>"I ain't gonna have Ever dragged down and thrown away by
following your example," said Ned Winton. "Besides, you're
upsetting the whole family," he muttered.</p>

<p>"All right," said Clay. "I'll leave in the morning. And if
Ever leaves with me I'll be sorry for you."</p>

<p>He walked straight through the front door and disappeared in
the house, leaving the father frozen in his place in the darkness
of the outer night. Ned's hand was raised in expostulation. The
next word was still hanging on his lips as he was about to reply,
but it seemed that that final speech of his brother had robbed
him of all utterance.</p>

<p>For a moment he remained like this, staring blankly before him
until the distant stars seemed to dance together. Then he turned
and went into the house.</p>

<p>He opened the screen door with care and carefully shut it
behind him, like a guilty husband returning too late at night.
The warm, close air of the house closed about him and made the
perspiration start on his face. There was a smell of stale
cookery in the hall; it was always there.</p>

<p>He went to the bedroom and was about to light the lamp when he
remembered his wife's weary face as he had last seen her. He
wanted her advice now, but he decided it would be better to wait
until the morning. To rouse her now and tell her the recent
threat of Clay would be to send her into a fury, and he dreaded
those paroxysms of anger more than anything else in the
world.</p>

<p>He himself sat down by the window, knitting his fingers
together. It seemed to him that the world was a flat and
savorless plain, a limitless waste of labor and joyless
death.</p>

<p>A mosquito sang suddenly at his ear; another droned not far
away. A shudder ran through Ned Winton's body, but he remained
motionless in his chair, staring at the obscure night
outside.</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; A WRECKED SADDLE</h2>

<p class="first">IT was the very rose of the morning, when young
Everard Winton rode over the hill and down to the shack of Harry
Lawson.</p>

<p>Early at is was, Harry Lawson was already up. He was in front
of his house, with his face toward the sun, seated on a sagging
cracker box and whittling at thin sticks from which he was
constructing stretchers on which pelts could be dried. It was
said that Harry Lawson had spent his every penny on that long,
long hunt for the red horse. In that quest he had hired many a
man; many a horse had been ridden to death; many a month had been
consumed relentlessly. He had been almost rich. All was spent to
capture the red stallion which he could not ride!</p>

<p>To eke out a living, Harry Lawson was trapping wolves and
coyotes for the bounty and for the value of the pelts.</p>

<p>There was a time when Harry Lawson had bet five thousand
dollars on the single ruffle of a faro pack&mdash;and
lost&mdash;and shrugged his shoulders at the loss. Now he had
fewer dollars than he formerly had thousands. On the other hand,
in the old days he was merely "Half-breed Harry" or "That Lawson
Injun." And now he was a revered figure. Men rode scores of miles
to look at his splendid horse. The legend of the long pursuit of
the Red Pacer filled the range.</p>

<p>Lawson remained the same dusty-faced, sawed-off, bow-legged
specimen of an unpretentious cow-puncher that he had always been.
He looked very much what he was, a cross between a stubby
Comanche squaw and a hardy Highlander.</p>

<p>He looked up as the boy jogged the mustang nearer, but
continued his whittling, merely reducing the size of his shavings
as he stared at Everard Winton with fixed eyes.</p>

<p>The latter approached, dismounted, and waved to the half-breed.</p>

<p>"I'm Ned Winton's son, Lawson," he said.</p>

<p>He went over and held out his hand. The Indian took it without
rising. His curiously impersonal eyes wandered steadily over the
face of the boy, as though he looked at a picture rather than a
human being.</p>

<p>"I'll take a look at the Red Pacer, if I may," said
Everard.</p>

<p>The Indian shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>Winton stepped to the corral fence. He went with his eyes to
the ground. Only when he reached the bars did he look up,
suddenly; and then he blinked and gripped the nearest bar with
both hands. His eyes dimmed; he heard a singing in his ears, and
his heart rose like a bubble in his breast.</p>

<p>He blinked the moisture out of his eyes and looked again.
There was a glow, a light, about the stallion. It was not the
sheen of his eyes or the shimmer of the sunshine down his flanks;
that was not the light that the boy saw around the horse. Dark
red chestnut, the name was not hard to understand. There were
three white marks&mdash;a splash in the tail, a star between the
eyes, and one silken white stocking drawn up almost to the
knee.</p>

<p>The boy went back to Harry Lawson, who remained on the cracker
box, whittling.</p>

<p>"Suppose somebody could ride that horse, what price would you
put on him?" asked Everard.</p>

<p>The half-breed looked away toward the sky, considered for a
long moment with dim eyes, and then shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>The boy caught his breath with impatience.</p>

<p>"Suppose I put a saddle on him?May I try him?" he asked, at
last.</p>

<p>Harry Lawson nodded.</p>

<p>When the stallion saw young Winton enter the corral he came to
life and swung around the big corral with a flourish. He made the
place look small, as a circus seal makes its foolish tub look
small. It seemed to the boy that with every stride the monster
horse rode high enough to clear the fence, had he been of a mind
to do so. Winton snared the red hoRse around the neck at the
first cast. To his delighted amazement the stallion stood still
at once. One lesson he had learned perfectly&mdash;not to pull
against a rope. The saddle and bridle were worked on with equal
ease, and there was not even a protest when Winton swung himself
into the saddle. But when he hit home in it, the action
began.</p>

<p>It seemed to him, a minute later, that the great horse had
risen under him, turned into a fountain of fire, and dissolved as
it struck the earth, dropping its rider into a cloud of
darkness.</p>

<p>Then Everard Winton was sitting up in the depth of the corral
dust and spitting dust from his mouth. Blood came with the dust.
He put up a hand and found that red was trickling from both mouth
and nose. There was a rip in his trouser leg and a cut in the
skin beneath the rip. Blood trickled down that leg, also, and the
wound burned like fire. That was where he had grazed the
fence.</p>

<p>He dragged himself to his feet, but he was so dizzy that he
had to sit down again, at once. He felt as though a club had
struck him at the base of the brain.</p>

<p>When his wits cleared again, he saw that the saddle was lying
in the middle of the enclosure. The stallion had bucked it
cleanly off, and he was in a far corner now, nibbling at the
grass that extended a little distance under the fence, his ears
pricking. The very contented switching of his tail was like the
gesture of one who has done a task well.</p>

<p>The boy waited for a full half hour before the misery was out
of his brain and the sickness out of his heart. Then he stood up
and turned to see that the half-breed was moving away from him,
working busily to fit together the pieces of a stretcher. Harry
Lawson was not excited, it appeared, by the proceedings of this
new aspirant.</p>

<p>The Winton blood and the pride of the Wintons stood up in the
boy. Again he caught the horse by the trailing lariat, and
saddled it as easily as before. Mounted again, he was once more
hurled up into the sky. But this time he hit the saddle when he
came down. He stuck through that and half a dozen skyrocketings.
Then the big horse spun around in a sudden circle and Everard
went off, stretched flat out in the air and whirled as he shot
forward. He clicked his head against a corral post and lay face
down in the dust for half an hour.</p>

<p>When he awakened, he was almost suffocating, and the
increasing heat of the sun was burning the back of his neck.</p>

<p>He sat up in a world that rocked about him as if he had been
in a small boat in a heavy sea. He had to close his eyes, and it
was another half hour before he ventured to get to his feet. But
he could not stay on them; he had to sit down again. Only much
later did he manage to get to the watering trough, turn on the
tap, and drink deep. That refreshed him.</p>

<p>He looked toward the house and saw that the half-breed was
still whittling sticks. Again Harry Lawson's back was toward the
corral. For all he knew, a dead man lay in the corral&mdash;dead
with a broken neck or a cracked skull. But that did not trouble
the half-breed.</p>

<p>The saddle, too, was lying in the middle of the corral once
more, though it had been cinched up with redoubled care.</p>

<p>Winton went to pick it up, and found it a loose, pulpy wreck.
The stallion must have rubbed it against the fence posts when he
found that he could not simply shake it off. Winton's riding was
ended for that day, but he was glad of it. Nothing but the fact
that the Indian was there to look on would have induced him to
make even another trial.</p>

<p>So, with bowed head, he went toward the corral gate, trailing
the ruined saddle under his arm. He did not look up until he had
reached the gate itself; and then he saw that Harry Lawson was
facing toward him, at last, and regarding him and the horse. It
was with amusement that the half-breed looked upon him; it was
with a smile that turned into the heartiest, but the most silent
of laughter.</p>

<p>The boy ground his teeth together! If he had been a little
older, he would have controlled himself. But at the sight of that
mockery, a madness fired his brain. The nausea left him, all at
once, and he whirled about, fairly running to the stallion.
Saddle or not, he would try again, for the sake of manhood.</p>

<p>He sprang onto the bare back of the great horse and waited for
the explosion that would hurl him at the blue sky. But the Red
Pacer merely turned his head. Without alarm, with what seemed an
air of curious surprise, he regarded the first man ever to sit on
his naked back.</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; THE CONQUEST</h2>

<p class="first">HARRY LAWSON was seated on top of the corral
fence. He was like a stuffed bird; there was not a trace of
emotion on his face.</p>

<p>Ever dismounted and then tried the stallion on the lead. It
was as though the horse had learned, long, long ago, in the days
of its colthood, all the lessons that can be taught. For it now
responded quite readily to the pull on the reins and to the
pressure on the side of the neck.</p>

<p>Until noon the boy led the great horse up and down. Then he
went to the shack, hoping for lunch. But the half-breed remained
sitting on top of the corral fence, his arms folded on his knees,
studying the stallion with a blank face.</p>

<p>That made little difference. In the West, on the range, one
may take it for granted that there is a certain hospitality. And
young Everard Winton sliced up potatoes with bacon, put on a pot
of coffee, and banged on a tin pan when the meal was ready.</p>

<p>Harry Lawson had not moved from his perch all that while, but
now he climbed down to the ground and went to the house. He
pumped some water into a basin and took off his felt hat, time-altered from black to green. Above the hat rim his hair was
shining black, but below the line of the rim it was gray with
dust. In the cold water, without soap, the breed washed his hands
and face with a few brief gestures. Then he dried his face by
slicking off the water with the edge of the hand, and dried his
hands by flicking them together a few times and giving them a
final wipe on his greasy overalls. He removed his felt hat from
the nail on which he had hung it, replaced it on his head, and
sat down to lunch.</p>

<p>He ate slowly. Most of the time he spent in carefully loading
his knife. The fork, though he preferred his fingers, was used to
build up a high stack of food along the length of the knife
blade, and after the load was built the knife was slowly raised,
the mouth opened so wide that the eyes were reduced to glimmering
slits, and the knife-load disappeared. Once the whole load fell
off just as it reached his lips, but that was the only mishap;
and after that accident he built the heaps more recklessly high
than ever, and never made a mistake.</p>

<p>Ever's own appetite was good, but the half-breed fairly beat
him, consuming at least two-thirds of the amount of food Ever had
cooked. Still Harry Lawson had not spoken. But at the end of the
bacon and fried potatoes, he winked, grinned all on one side of
his leathery face, rose from the table, and from a hidden shelf
brought down two cans of blackberry jam. He cut off the tops of
both cans, put one in front of his guest and took the other for
himself. He used no bread with the conserve instead, he simply
raised the can above his face and shook clotted lumps of the
sweetness into his vast mouth.</p>

<p>Young Everard Winton finished his meal and his coffee with
haste, and went outside to take the air.</p>

<p>He could still feel the effects of the falls he had had that
morning, but no pain of body could match or master the joy that
was in his soul.</p>

<p>After a time, while he was smoking a cigarette, Harry Lawson
came out and sat beside him.</p>

<p>"How much you want for that Red Pacer?" asked Winton.</p>

<p>The other held up five grimy fingers. And a swift, fiery hope
rushed through the soul of the boy.</p>

<p>"Five hundred dollars?" he asked.</p>

<p>Harry Lawson shook his head, and a cold hopelessness filled
the boy.</p>

<p>"Five thousand?" he demanded.</p>

<p>The other nodded, and put down his hand again while Everard
Winton looked desperately ahead of him, his eyes straining as
though he were trying to make out obscure print. Five thousand
dollars! The sum rang and beat against his ear like a death
bell.</p>

<p>"That's a lot of money, Lawson," he argued. "You've got to
remember that the mustang's not a thoroughbred."</p>

<p>The Indian shrugged his shoulders, seemed to consider, and
held up three fingers.</p>

<p>The world, for Harry Lawson, had suddenly shrunk to the shape
of that silken monster; and the price of the horse was three
thousand dollars. Not a very great price for a man's entire
world, but an impossible price for young Winton.</p>

<p>Winton picked up the wreckage of the saddle and returned to
the corral. For hours he worked steadily, and at four o'clock
sharp he climbed tentatively, gently, into the saddle. This time
the stallion did not strike for the sky. Instead, he sank almost
to his knees, trembled, and gradually straightened. With loose
rein, Winton kept his place, talking constantly to the great
horse soothingly. And down from his hand, through the leather of
the reins to the steel bit and to the brain of the horse, he felt
an electric current running.</p>

<p>It was not a conquest.</p>

<p>Not as a fighter was Ever winning the Red Pacer, but as a
companion and a friend.</p>

<p>He dismounted, undid the cinches, and carried the saddle back
to his mustang. Harry Lawson was again at work on the stretchers,
making them with wonderful handicraft, binding the joints with
waxed twine. Hundreds of years before, perhaps, Comanches had
made stretchers just like these!</p>

<p>"Three thousand dollars, eh, Lawson?" Ever asked wearily.</p>

<p>The half-breed shook his head, and lifted two fingers.</p>

<p>"Two thousand?" exclaimed the boy.</p>

<p>The other nodded.</p>

<p>Two thousand dollars seemed to Ever so little, by contrast,
that it seemed for a burning instant that the red horse was
already in his hands. And then he remembered; he had not twenty
dollars in the world. His father had plenty in the bank, perhaps;
but his father had forbidden him to come near the horse.</p>

<p>Only Uncle Clay Winton might have ideas.</p>

<p>Everard went to his own horse. It was not necessary to waste
an adieu on that brutally silent animal of a man; so he mounted
and rode back over the trail toward home. And his heart was like
red-hot steel in his breast.</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7"></a>VII. NO SON OF HIS...</h2>

<p class="first">IT was after supper time when young Everard
Winton put up his mustang and came to the house.</p>

<p>He went into the kitchen and found his mother washing dishes.
She merely turned her head over her shoulder, offering him no
food, only the stern greeting:</p>

<p>"Your pa wants to see you on the front porch."</p>

<p>The son looked back at her curiously. Her head was bowed lower
over the dishpan, and she worked her elbows furiously, as though
she were over a washtub.</p>

<p>He went to her and laid a hand on her shoulder; her whole body
trembled.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Mother?" said he. "Are you going to take
it as hard as all this?"</p>

<p>She stiffened at that, and whirled around to face him.</p>

<p>"It ain't me that you're to wheedle! It's your pa that wants
to talk to you," she said.</p>

<p>He looked again into her angry face. Fear was in it, too, but
he saw that his advance was taken in the wrong spirit entirely.
She felt that he was trying to break ground with her before he
went out to see the head of the family.</p>

<p>But that was mere pretense, for she was the head of the
family, as he very well knew.</p>

<p>He was ravenously hungry, so he picked up a crust of bread,
spread it with butter from a dish on the kitchen table, and
paused at the door to munch.</p>

<p>"You didn't go to the blacksmith shop at all," she exclaimed,
without turning her head. "Don't lie and say you did. Pa went and
inquired, and you wasn't there!"</p>

<p>"I wasn't going to lie about it," he answered, simply. Anger
jumped up in his breast. "What sort of a fellow d'you think I am,
anyway?" he asked her.</p>

<p>"Go and talk to your pa!" she retorted.</p>

<p>He went out of the kitchen and through the dining room and
down the narrow darkness of the hall, very slowly. He was
finishing the heel of the loaf as he stepped onto the front
porch.</p>

<p>There were two spots of light in the dusk; one was from his
father's pipe, one from his uncle's cigarette.</p>

<p>"Hello, Clay. Hello, Father," said Ever.</p>

<p>"How are things?" asked Clay Winton.</p>

<p>The father merely grunted.</p>

<p>"Mother says you want to talk to me, Father," said the
boy.</p>

<p>"I do," said Ned Winton, gruffly.</p>

<p>Now that the time had come, the words came out with a
surprising ease. Ned Winton added:</p>

<p>"Were you at the blacksmith shop, today?"</p>

<p>"No," said the boy.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I was busy at something else."</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"I rode the Red Pacer," answered Everard, frankly.</p>

<p>"You rode him, eh?" exclaimed Clay Winton. "Good boy,
Ever!"</p>

<p>Ned leaned forward to face his brother. "Are you gonna keep
your mouth out of this?" he asked, with a dangerous softness.</p>

<p>"Yeah. I'll keep out of it," answered Clay.</p>

<p>"So you rode the hoss, eh?" said the father.</p>

<p>The boy was silent. It was a question he had already
answered.</p>

<p>"I told you not to and you went and did it?" questioned the
father.</p>

<p>"I said that I pretty near had to," replied Everard. "You know
how a thing gets into you&mdash;and burns."</p>

<p>"But I told you not to!" insisted the father.</p>

<p>"That's true," said the boy.</p>

<p>"And still you went and done it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What had I ought to do about a thing like that?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"I know," said the father, savagely. "I'd oughta throw you out
of this house and into the road! That's what I oughta
do&mdash;and I got a mind to do it."</p>

<p>The boy lifted his head.</p>

<p>"It's easily done," he said. "One word will turn the trick.
Just one word more is all you need to use.</p>

<p>Ned Winton leaped from his chair and stamped until the boards
creaked under him.</p>

<p>"Sassing me back, are you?" he shouted.</p>

<p>"I don't want to," said Everard. I don't want to make you
angry, either."</p>

<p>"All you want is to have your own way, eh?"</p>

<p>"Father," said the boy, "I know you're angry&mdash;and I don't
blame you, either. You told me there was something I mustn't do,
and I did it. That was wrong of me, but I just couldn't help
myself. I want to make a business deal with you. You've always
wanted me to stay and work more on the ranch. You never wanted me
to go into the blacksmith shop, for instance. It was only that I
thought that I couldn't be interested in the ranch, you see.
Well, I'll change my mind, if I can. I'll come back here and work
on the ranch; I'll be a hired hand. I'll show you how I can pitch
in and work for you."</p>

<p>"What makes you say all of this, so unexpectedly?" asked the
farmer. "What makes you so doggone eager to get to work on the
ranch?"</p>

<p>"I'm not eager to do that," answered Everard. "But I want to
please you and I want to please myself. I've got a chance to get
a thing that means more to me than anything else in the world.
You can help me get it. And if you'll do it, I'll work out what I
want you to give me. I'll work without any pay as common puncher,
plough-hand, anything you say."</p>

<p>"What is it that you want?" asked the father.</p>

<p>"Two thousand dollars!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>The boy was silent.</p>

<p>The father exclaimed again, "What you done that you need two
thousand dollars?"</p>

<p>"That's the price of the Red Pacer."</p>

<p>"My God!" cried Ned Winton. "I could buy twenty good
hosses&mdash;I could buy a whole herd of 'em&mdash;for that
price. Are you clean crazy, Ever?"</p>

<p>"Well, after seeing the Pacer twice, I'll about die unless I
have him; and Harry Lawson wants two thousand dollars for
him."</p>

<p>Said Ned Winton, "I ain't that kind of a fool!"</p>

<p>Said the boy, "Would I be worth five hundred dollars a year to
you, and keep, as a regular ranch hand&mdash;and to run things,
too, while you're away from the place, now and then?"</p>

<p>"Five hundred dollars!" said the father, scenting a bargain,
and beginning to cavil. "While you have boxing matches behind the
barn?"</p>

<p>"I'll stop that," said the boy. "I promise."</p>

<p>"And burn up ammunition with revolvers and rifles&mdash;and
never shoot no game&mdash;just practice?"</p>

<p>"I'll stop that, also," said Everard. "I'll stop it all. I'll
be what you want me to be. I'll throw myself into the job. I'll
study the cattle business day and night, when I'm not riding
range or doing other things. I'll work out of books and take
notes on everything that the old-timers say to me. I'll never
look at a gun or anything like that. It'll be work, work, work,
for me. I'll give you four years of work like that, if you'll
advance the two thousand dollars now."</p>

<p>The father sighed.</p>

<p>"To think of a son of mine actually wantin' to blow in two
thousand dollars on a hoss!"</p>

<p>"I'll work six years for you," said the boy, steadily and
quietly. "I'll spend no more time making things in the blacksmith
shop, or fiddling around with the locksmith, or shooting, or
hunting, or playing foolish games. I'll toe the line every minute
of those years. I'll do that for the two thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"You will?" muttered the father.</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Then the parent whispered, "Two
thousand dollars for a worthless hoss! You'd be the laughin'
stock of the range, and so would I. Folks would just laugh at us.
Two thousand dollars? You could get that hoss for five
hundred!"</p>

<p>"Harry Lawson spent fifteen or twenty thousand dollars to
catch that mustang," said the boy. "What with the hire of men and
the burning up of horse-flesh, he spent at least that much. And
his place went to pieces while he was away. He was pretty well
heeled a few years ago, and he's broke now. But he did that for
the horse. He asked five thousand at first; but afterwards he
came down to two thousand&mdash;after I'd ridden the Pacer.
That's his lowest price. I saw in his face that it was the
lowest."</p>

<p>"Harry Lawson is a half-breed fool!" said the father.</p>

<p>Clay Winton broke in. "Ned, do it. Ever offers you six years
of his life. By the end of that time he'll be a cattleman in
spite of himself, and that's what you want him to be. Let him
have the money. I'll advance it to you if you're short on hard
cash."</p>

<p>That word from his brother simply happened to strike Ned
Winton at the wrong moment and in the wrong place.</p>

<p>"I want none of your stolen money in my hands!" he
shouted.</p>

<p>His brother stood up and leaned a hand against a wooden
pillar. He felt the eyes of the boy on him, through the
darkness.</p>

<p>"You've said a hard thing to me," said Clay.</p>

<p>"I've said a true thing. Tell Ever if it's true or not. On
your word of honor, tell him true&mdash;if you dare!"</p>

<p>"It's true," said Clay Winton. I live on stolen money.</p>

<p>After a deadly pause Ned Winton muttered, "I didn't want to
kick you in the face like this&mdash;only&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice faded into an obscure mumbling that had little or no
meaning.</p>

<p>Clay said, "I might of guessed from last night that it would
pan out this way. Well, I'll be rolling my blankets."</p>

<p>He stepped through the doorway and into the house.</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better call him back?" asked Everard of his
father.</p>

<p>Ned Winton exploded again. He felt that he had done something
brutally wrong, for he loved Clay and always had. It had been a
stunning shock to him to learn that his wife's suspicions, after
all, were correct. Now he turned and poured his rage on the
boy.</p>

<p>"Are you gonna give me advice now?" he demanded. "You, that
has been the cause of it all?"</p>

<p>"No," said Everard. "I'll give you no more advice."</p> <hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch8" name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; SO-LONG!</h2>

<p class="first">MRS. WINTON was not the most tactful person in
the world, but never had she chosen a more tactless moment than
this for coming to the front porch. Her husband, badgered and
desperate and feeling that he wanted support from some one,
turned to her eagerly.</p>

<p>"Here's our Ever, that wants two thousand dollars for a
hoss!"</p>

<p>"Two-thousand dollars&mdash;for a hoss!" she cried, throwing
up her hands. "Where's your brain, Ever? Where's your brain?"</p>

<p>The boy stepped back to the door. His parents thought that the
argument was just beginning; they did not know that in reality it
was ending.</p>

<p>He expounded his proposal again.</p>

<p>"I've just been telling father that I'd work six years for
nothing&mdash;as hard as I can work, and I know that I can work
hard. I've been a fool of a kid, but I can be a man now. I'm not
boasting, but something's happened to me. I know I can be a man
now, and do a man's work. I've offered to work six years for the
two thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"For a hoss, eh?" said the mother. "The craziest idea that I
ever heard in all my born days!"</p>

<p>Her son pulled the door open.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, I know that you're the boss here, and that
what you say goes."</p>

<p>He stepped inside and closed the door after him. Even from his
childhood his ways had always been those of silence. The door
made no sound now, and they hardly realized that he was gone.</p>

<p>Then said the mother, "You been layin' down the law to
him?"</p>

<p>"Clay's leavin' the house," said her husband, abruptly.</p>

<p>She made half an exclamation of pleasure, but something told
her to cut it short. Her husband rarely overawed her, but this
was one of the occasions.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "sometime he was bound to go. I guess that's
the only way to look at it."</p>

<p>"I told him," said her husband, "right in front of Ever. I
told him that he was livin' on stolen money.</p>

<p>"What did he say?" breathed the wife.</p>

<p>"He said that he was," replied Ned Winton.</p>

<p>"He said it?" she echoed. "His own self, he said it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied. His voice was stifled as he added with
effort, "He's a man, Clay is. I always told you that&mdash;Clay's
a man. He up and said it, in front of me. That don't matter much.
But he said it in front of Ever, too&mdash;and he loves Ever. He
loves him better than God loves little apples. But he admitted in
front of Ever that he had been a thief."</p>

<p>"It's a terrible thing!" she whispered.</p>

<p>Then, with Everard's slowness, and with his voice, she heard
her husband saying, "You had to talk. I wish you hadn't talked
about it. You put the idea into my head."</p>

<p>A rush of anger flushed her face, brought a thousand words to
her lips; but she was silent. She realized, suddenly, that she
had put in motion wheels that she could not stop.</p>

<p>Everard, when he entered the house, paused at the door of his
uncle's room, where the light slid out across the faded pattern
of the matting that covered the hall floor. He tapped,
lightly.</p>

<p>"Hello!" said his uncle's clear, quiet voice.</p>

<p>Everard admired the purity of the sound, with no choke of
emotion in it.</p>

<p>"It's Ever," said he.</p>

<p>"Come in, Ever," said Clay Winton as he came to the door and
opened it. Clay Winton offered, now and again, little touches of
courtesy of which most people in that part of the world were
incapable. He held the door open now, and smiled at the boy. But
Everard did not fail to see that the face of the other was pale
as stone.</p>

<p>"May I come in?" the boy asked.</p>

<p>"Why, come in, Ever. Of course," said Clay.</p>

<p>He waved his nephew to a chair; then he closed the door softly
behind his guest.</p>

<p>Everard went to the chest of drawers an leaned his back
against it. He lifted his chin, and from an altitude looked down
on the work of the packing. He had been sixteen years old when
this man came to the house, but he felt as though the last four
years had composed nine-tenths of his life. He said nothing; he
merely watched. Everything had been taken from the drawers and
piled on the bed. On the floor beside the bed lay a tarpaulin;
and in it shirts, underwear and other odds and ends of apparel
were being laid with great rapidity. It was as though Clay Winton
had planned long before a quick departure such as this, and knew
exactly what he would want.</p>

<p>He said, bending to build the pack, "You can wear my things,
Ever. You Take what I leave behind, will you?"</p>

<p>Emotion, with a cold and terribly unexpected hand, gripped
Everard by the throat. He could not answer. He could only be
thankful that his uncle did not look up at that moment.</p>

<p>"I guess that's about all," said Clay, after a time, looking
carelessly about the room.</p>

<p>He folded the outer edges of the tarpaulin over, and with a
swift twisting of rope, made his bundle into one that would fit
behind a saddle. Then he crossed to the table, opened a drawer,
and took out a Colt revolver which he broke open, examining its
loaded cylinder, and held out to the boy.</p>

<p>"I want you to have the old gat," said Uncle Clay. "She's
never missed, for me. I guess she'll never miss for you,
either."</p>

<p>Everard took it, gripped it hard, and then put it away in his
clothes. He had used it before. He knew how Clay Winton trusted
that gun.</p>

<p>Again, swift emotion choked him, and he could say nothing.</p>

<p>His uncle sat down, rolled a cigarette and lighted it.</p>

<p>"Don't you make any mistake, Ever," he remarked. "Your
mother's right. I wouldn't be good for you&mdash;in the long
run."</p>

<p>He stopped speaking. Sitting in silence, he finished the
cigarette with long, slow inhalations. Then he walked to the
window and threw out the butt. It made a little arc of sparks
through the darkness of the night.</p>

<p>"I'll be saying so long, Ever," he said.</p>

<p>Everard paid no heed, but with lowered head began to pace
rapidly back and forth.</p>

<p>Clay Winton went on, "Four years and a half ago, I walked into
the Green River First National Bank and pulled a gun on the
cashier. It was just noon, and everybody was hurrying out. Nobody
but the cashier noticed me and the gun. I made him open the safe;
the others were mostly out for lunch, by that time. He brought me
the boxes. There was a lot of cash, and there was a lot more in
convertible securities. It was worth about half a million. No,
four hundred thousand would be nearer. I dropped the stuff in
three saddle bags and got away. They only shot me once. I still
have the bullet in the left leg. You know how I limp when the
first frosts come?"</p>

<p>"I know," said Everard, as he stopped his walking.</p>

<p>"So long, Ever," said his uncle, quietly.</p>

<p>"What horse are you riding?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"The only hoss I have," said the older man. "That roan
bronc."</p>

<p>"All right," said Everard. "When you get outside the corral
gate, will you wait for five minutes?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Clay Winton.</p>

<p>"All right. You wait for five minutes, that's all. Before you
ride on."</p>

<p>"I'll do that."</p>

<p>Clay Winton went to the door, picked his sombrero off a nail,
shouldered his pack, and left the room.</p>

<p>Then, on the front porch, Everard could hear the spoken good-byes, very brief and stilted. It was an amazing thing to the boy,
the ease with which the ties of blood could be broken all in a
moment.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards he heard his mother enter the
house.</p>

<p>Then, in his turn, he went out to the porch.</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch9" name="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; IF HE WERE IN
HELL</h2>

<p class="first">IT was his father's bedtime, but he was lighting
up a fresh pipe, and a shower of sparks blew down the lazy
wind.</p>

<p>Everard waited until the preliminary puffing had ended and the
red glow had died from his father's face. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Uncle Clay has gone?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," muttered Ned Winton. "Clay's gone."</p>

<p>"He couldn't stand it," insisted the boy. "That's why he's
gone."</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>"I'm going, too," said the boy.</p>

<p>He waited.</p>

<p>"Are you?" asked his father.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm going," he said.</p>

<p>He waited again.</p>

<p>"All right," said Ned Winton.</p>

<p>"About mother" began the boy.</p>

<p>"It's Clay that's making you go," said the father.</p>

<p>"No, that isn't so," insisted the boy. "Uncle Clay said that
you were right; and he said that mother was right. He doesn't
even know that I'm going."</p>

<p>"Well, it's all right," remarked Ned Winton. "You're going
because I wouldn't give you the two thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Because you wouldn't trust me for the two thousand dollars,"
Everard corrected him.</p>

<p>The boy smiled to himself.</p>

<p>"Your mother, she says it's the craziest idea that she ever
heard of&mdash;two thousand bucks for a twenty-year-old kid."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is a crazy idea. I don't know. But I've got to
have that horse."</p>

<p>"How you gonna get it? Steal it?"</p>

<p>"Maybe," said the boy.</p>

<p>"My God!" muttered Ned Winton.</p>

<p>He turned in his chair, suddenly, and started to speak. Then
he checked himself.</p>

<p>"My mother," said Everard, "is behind all this. But she's not
as swift and bitter as you think. She loves me, and I love her.
If I went to say good-bye to her now, she'd raise the roof. I
couldn't stand it, and she couldn't stand it. We understand each
other. That's why she's always been afraid that I'd go wrong.I'm
not going near her, but I want you to say two things to her, for
me."</p>

<p>"I'll say them," said the father.</p>

<p>His voice was a whisper. There was nothing in his heart; it
was an empty space. Pain would come later.</p>

<p>"Tell her that I love her, and tell her good-bye for me," said
the boy. "She'll raise the roof, mind you, but you can stand it.
For you could stand calling your own brother a thief."</p>

<p>His father puffed at his pipe, leisurely. He could not answer
for a minute, so terrible was the pain that was beginning to
creep inside his breast.</p>

<p>"Yeah," he said, "I called Clay a thief. He is. Clay's a
thief."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the boy. "Uncle Clay's a thief. But do you know
something?"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"He's the finest man I know," said the boy, pointedly.</p>

<p>The father continued to smoke, and made no comment.</p>

<p>"I'll be going along now," said Everard. "Are we shaking
hands, Father?"</p>

<p>He held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Why, sure," said Ned Winton. I guess we're shaking
hands."</p>

<p>He stood up and held out his hand. He said:</p>

<p>"Speaking of the six years work, that would be all right. The
six years contract and the two thousand dollars."</p>

<p>But his son answered, "If I were in hell and one penny would
get me out, I wouldn't take that penny from you now."</p>

<p>"That's pretty clear," said Ned Winton.</p>

<p>"I hope it is clear," said Everard. "Good-bye."</p>

<p>He went down the steps. His footfall crunched on the long,
straight, graveled path, and he passed out of the obscure shadows
of the trees and into the pale starlight beyond; he opened the
gate, closed it with his customary softness, and went up the road
toward the corral gate.</p>

<p>His father smoked out his pipe and then went into the
house.</p>

<p>At the door of the bedroom he waited for a moment, with his
hand upon the knob, but finally he went inside. All the Wintons
moved softly; so did Ned. Through the darkness he said:</p>

<p>"Martha!"</p>

<p>He had to repeat the call.</p>

<p>"Well?" she said, awakening.</p>

<p>"Clay's gone," he said.</p>

<p>"You needn't to wake me for that," she answered. I know he's
gone&mdash;and a good riddance."</p>

<p>He lighted the lamp and remained with his back turned toward
her, his hands resting on the edge of the dresser, with the lamp
before him, so that his shadow swallowed the white walls of the
room.</p>

<p>Suddenly she sat bolt upright.</p>

<p>"Ned, what's the matter?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Aw, nothing much," said he.</p>

<p>She was awed by his very silence.</p>

<p>"It ain't that I didn't know you love Clay," she said.</p>

<p>"Did you know that?" he asked, skeptically.</p>

<p>"Will you turn around and look at me?" she pleaded.</p>

<p>"Yeah. Pretty soon I will," said he.</p>

<p>A dreadful fear got hold of her; she could hear the thumping
of her heart, and in the silence it seemed to her that strange
little noises stole down the hall and paused at the door of the
room.</p>

<p>"Clay said he was a thief," said the father. "He said it
before Ever."</p>

<p>Still his wife made no answer, and a dim wonder stole over
him. He had never known her to lack words before.</p>

<p>After a time, while he still considered the lifting of the
yellow flame in the hot chimney of the lamp, he said:</p>

<p>"Ever's gone."</p>

<p>"Gone?" she asked, unable to comprehend.</p>

<p>Her voice had grown so thin and small that he stood up
straight, with a start; but he could not bring himself to face
her.</p>

<p>"You drove out Clay," he said.</p>

<p>"I drove out Clay," she answered. "God forgive me if I was
wrong about it. I was only thinkin' of poor Ever. He's only
twenty."</p>

<p>"But you went and drove out Ever, too," said he.</p>

<p>He heard a rustle of the bed clothes, and the fall of a bare
foot on the floor. He said, hastily:</p>

<p>"Don't come near me, Martha. Don't touch me!"</p>

<p>He shrank, at the thought of her.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't bother you none, Ned," she said, brokenly. "I'm
only standin' here and askin' you something."</p>

<p>"All right," he answered. "That's all right. Whatcha wanta
know?"</p>

<p>"Everard" she began. "What about Everard?What about my
boy?"</p>

<p>"You wanta know something?" he said.</p>

<p>"I wanta know anything you'll tell me, Ned." said she.</p>

<p>He wondered at her small and childlike voice now.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I was talkin' over about the two thousand
dollars and the six years' contract. You said that was the
craziest idea you ever heard of."</p>

<p>"Yes," said that new, small voice. "Maybe I said that." And,
in a whisper she added, "Oh, God!Oh, God!What's happened?"</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "Ever said that if he was in hell and only
wanted a penny to get out, he'd stay right there in hell rather
than take the penny from me now."</p>

<p>He felt her come nearer.</p>

<p>"Maybe you mean that Everard has left us for good?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"He didn't take nothin' with him," said the father. "He didn't
make up no pack; he didn't even take his new rifle. He just
walked down off the front path, and he opened the gate and turned
up the road. He wanted me to say two things to you&mdash;that he
loved you, and good-bye."</p>

<p>He added, hastily: "Don't touch me, Martha! I'm gonna go out
and have another pipe. I was just telling you. He didn't take
nothing. If he was in hell and a penny would buy him out, a penny
from us wouldn't do him no good now."</p>

<h2><a id="ch10" name="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; A PROMISE OF
ARREST</h2>

<p class="first">EARLY the next morning, Mrs. Ned Winton drove to
town in the buckboard with a cargo of fresh butter and eggs to be
delivered at the grocery store. There she received part payment
in trade and part in hard cash. She hurried through her business,
for she had something else on her mind that had to be executed,
and it was a thing which she did not wish her husband to know
about.</p>

<p>She went, in fact, straight to the office of the
sheriff&mdash;but not quite to it, for in fact she encountered
Sheriff Lewis Darrow walking down the sidewalk with a big stride
and she pulled up the buckboard beside him.</p>

<p>He took off his hat to her, lifting it so high that she saw
the gleam of the bald spot on his head.</p>

<p>He was not as trim about the waist as he had once been, and
his long face was more like that of a horse than ever&mdash;an
aging horse, but one with plenty of spirit still left to shine
out of the eyes. Deep furrows ran down his cheeks, slanting from
the temples toward the chin, and his eye was sunk under a sun-faded shrubbery of brows.</p>

<p>She had known him since her girlhood. That long acquaintance
and the fact that he represented the law throughout the huge
domain of that county made her feel and value highly the sense of
possession with which she looked upon him.</p>

<p>"I wanted to talk to you a couple minutes, Lew," she said.</p>

<p>He stepped out from the sidewalk, raised his right foot, and
rested the ball of it on the hub of the front wheel.</p>

<p>"All right, Martha," he said, with a smile. "You never let me
take up much of your time. I'll stand here all day, if you'll
keep on talkin'."</p>

<p>She smiled, and though the smile died quickly, a sense of
pleasure remained long after. She had been a very pretty girl, in
her time.</p>

<p>"It's about my boy," she said.</p>

<p>"Ever?" said he. "Oh, Ever's all right. Been cutting up a
little, has he?"</p>

<p>"He's got into bad company," said she, "with Clay Winton."</p>

<p>The sheriff did not so much as blink. He could face guns, also
news like this.</p>

<p>"I always liked Clay a lot," said he.</p>

<p>"He's taken my son away from home," she answered.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to hear that," answered the sheriff.</p>

<p>There was consideration and doubt in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I want him stopped!" she burst out.</p>

<p>A thousand times before, the sheriff had heard from women
requests just as unreasonable as this one.</p>

<p>He met her eye gently and answered, "I'd stop Clay in a
minute, but I ain't got the power. There's gotta be a cause for
arrest, and a warrant's gotta be swore out."</p>

<p>She stared at the sheriff, and felt her face turning cold and
her heart turning hot.</p>

<p>"I'm talkin' to you alone, Lew?" she said, finally.</p>

<p>"You are, Martha," he answered, with a start.</p>

<p>"If ever a whisper comes back to my husband that I've gone and
told you, my life's a plumb ruined life, Lew!"</p>

<p>There was a note of desperation in her voice.</p>

<p>The sheriff took his foot from the hub of the wheel, for the
mustangs had begun to stir uneasily, backing and then stepping
forward. The wheel kept making quarter-turns.</p>

<p>"No whisper ever comes out of me, when things are told to me
in private, Martha," he said. "But I'm a sworn-in officer of the
law. Y'understand? When you talk to me, you're talkin' right to
the law, in a manner of speakin'. Maybe you better not tell me
what's in your mind&mdash;till you've gone and talked it over
with Ned."</p>

<p>A moaning came suddenly from her throat.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lew," she said, "Ned blames me because both Clay and Ever
are gone. But I bore down on Clay. I knew he wasn't good for my
boy. I knew right well. And I knew that he never dug honest money
out of the ground with those soft hands of his. Yesterday, it was
put right up to him and he admitted that his money was stolen. Is
that good enough to arrest him? But God help me if you bring me
into it! Only, I want him stopped! He's gotta be stopped. I gotta
have poor Ever back home again, or I'll die!"</p>

<p>Tears brimmed her eyes, but she set her teeth and would not
surrender to the pain.</p>

<p>The sheriff let a moment pass. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Martha, I'll tell you what. If you wanta drive on home and
forget about what you've told me&mdash;why, I'll forget about it,
too!"</p>

<p>"And let Ever go with him?" she pleaded.</p>

<p>"You want me to arrest Clay, eh?"</p>

<p>"I do! Something's gotta be done. There's nothing left but
that!"</p>

<p>"All right," said the sheriff, slowly. "Where did he steal the
money?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that. All I know is that he stole it. It must of
been a whale of a lot, too, because he has everything that he
wants, and he never has to turn a tap with his hands. He's got it
all invested, somewheres. He's just livin' on the interest, all
this while. Is that enough to arrest him on?"</p>

<p>"I'm going back to the office and see," said the sheriff.
"I'll try to trace it. I guess I oughta say that I'm glad you
told me&mdash;but I ain't. I'm sorry. I always liked Clay a
lot!"</p>

<p>"You never knew him," said the woman, trembling. "You never
seen him workin' on a son of yours, an' stealin' the boy's heart
away from you."</p>

<p>"No, never saw that," admitted the sheriff.</p>

<p>"I'm gonna drive on," she said. "Mind you, Lew, my life's
murdered for me if ever Ned finds out that I've told you. He'd
never forgive me; he'll never forgive me anyway, unless Everard
comes back&mdash;and I&mdash;"</p>

<p>The tears suddenly overbrimmed her eyes. She slapped the
mustangs with the reins, and drove off without a word of
farewell.</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch11" name="ch11"></a>XI.&mdash; A YEAR'S WORK IN A
DAY</h2>

<p class="first">THE sheriff walked on into his office, full of
thought. There in the office, waiting for him, was Jim Butler,
his deputy. Jim was far too old to ride with a posse, and his
hands were far too slow and uncertain to wield a revolver.
Sometimes he took a week off and devoted the time to serious
drinking. Nevertheless, he was worth his weight in gold to the
sheriff.</p>

<p>"Lookit, Jim," said Lew Darrow, seating himself on the sill of
the open window. "How long's Clay Winton been around town,
lately?"</p>

<p>"He ain't been around town ever. He's always out to Ned
Winton's ranch."</p>

<p>"Mighty lively boy, Clay used to be," said the sheriff. "But
he's quieted down a lot. Never sees nobody, lately."</p>

<p>"No, he never does," said the other.</p>

<p>"That's a funny thing," remarked the sheriff. "Lookit here,
Jim&mdash;how long has Clay been back&mdash;back from his
mining?"</p>

<p>"Lemme see. Four years. Past four years," said the all-knowing
Butler.</p>

<p>He saw that other questions were about to be asked him, and
puckering his brows, he buried both fists in the length of his
white beard. He was like one submitting to torment. He hated to
disturb the vast accumulation of facts which had piled up in his
brain, with or without his will.</p>

<p>The sheriff pointed a brown forefinger at him and frowned,
demanding absolute concentration.</p>

<p>"Where was Clay Winton when he was away from home?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>The face of the other was stirred by the effort of
recollection.</p>

<p>"He said he was off in Old Mexico, most of the time," said the
other, relaxing with a faint sigh because of the ease of
answering this question.</p>

<p>"Think!" ordered the sheriff. "Away back there, four-five
years ago, did anything big happen in the line of robberies?"</p>

<p>"There was the Denver and Q. R. Express that was held up by
the Townley gang."</p>

<p>"Leave gangs out of it," said the sheriff. "No Winton is
likely to work with a gang. Gangs leave tracks that are too
broad, an' Wintons are all folks that move silent and
careful."</p>

<p>"Did Clay Winton rob something?" asked the other.</p>

<p>"Never mind that. You just keep on remembering. Pick out some
big job&mdash;most likely a one-or two-man job."</p>

<p>The other sighed. "Wait a minute, Lew, and I'll get it sure,"
said he.</p>

<p>He pulled open a drawer of the desk and produced a whisky
bottle and a glass.</p>

<p>"Leave that be!" commanded the sheriff. "You don't touch no
drop till you hit on something."</p>

<p>The old man groaned faintly. He pushed the bottle and the
glass reluctantly to the side, though his eyes dwelt on them
still.</p>

<p>"About five years back," he said, "there was a pair of gents
that stuck up the Cripple Gulch Stage."</p>

<p>"There was red-handed murder in that job. Wintons are not
murderous. Try again."</p>

<p>"Up in Lassiter Falls there was one day when the town woke up
and found that the safe of the biggest bank in the town was
blowed."</p>

<p>"That was another gang job," said the sheriff. "Try
again."</p>

<p>"There was the Green River First National job, too. That was a
beauty."</p>

<p>"How was that?"</p>

<p>"It was one noon, that a gent walks into the bank"</p>

<p>"Alone?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, alone."</p>

<p>The eye of the sheriff brightened. "Go on!" he ordered.</p>

<p>"He walks in alone, and there was still some people in the
bank. Well, this gent steps to the cashier's window and slides a
revolver under a stack of papers and just lets the muzzle shine
at the cashier. Somehow, it didn't look like news from home to
that cashier, neither. So the cashier forked the dough out of the
safe. He sees that the robber is cold and cool as ice.</p>

<p>"The guy who done it is pretty well toward six feet, kind of
lean, clean-shaved, and he's got a pair of blue eyes that look
different from most. So he passes over the loot, and the other
drops it into three saddle bags and backs toward the door. And as
he gets to the door the cashier gets his courage back and grabs
his gun. He shoots that gent through the leg; he even seen the
blood fly, he says. But the robber, he was right at the door. He
dragged through it, and pulled himself right onto a horse. Away
he goes, and he turns into one alley and up another, gettin'
clean away, though he must of bled a terrible pile."</p>

<p>The sheriff sat transfixed.</p>

<p>"Does Clay Winton ever limp?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah. I've heard sometimes in the winter he does."</p>

<p>The sheriff leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>"Jim," he cried, "you can take that drink now! You've done a
year's work in a day!"</p>

<p>And he fled from his office to the street.</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch12" name="ch12"></a>XII. THE MAIN IDEA</h2>

<p class="first">IT was midnight when Clay Winton and the boy
came over the top of the last hill and looked down at the faint
black spot which was the shack of Harry Lawson, the half-breed.</p>

<p>There Clay Winton pulled in his horse.</p>

<p>"I don't like it, Ever," said he.</p>

<p>"What?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Arrivin' anywhere&mdash;even at a shack like that&mdash;with
me on a hoss and you on foot."</p>

<p>"When I have a horse," said the boy, "I'll ride with you. And
while you have a horse and I'm on foot, I'll do the traveling on
foot, Indian style."</p>

<p>"What are you gonna say to old Harry?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to beg him to keep that horse for me as long as he
will&mdash;a month, maybe&mdash;until I have a chance somehow to
get hold of the right amount of money."</p>

<p>Clay Winton cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"You know, I've got more solid cash than that along with me,
Ever?"</p>

<p>Ever was silent for a moment.</p>

<p>"Have you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I'll pass out the price of that horse to you. You can
pay me back later on."</p>

<p>The boy hesitated.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said. "There's something in me against
doing that."</p>

<p>"You're worried because it's stolen money? Well, Ever, suppose
I hadn't told you what it is? You'd have taken it, then, wouldn't
you?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I would," he admitted.</p>

<p>"Then take it now. And as soon as you've paid it back, you're
free of trouble about it. Your hands are clean again."</p>

<p>The boy turned suddenly to him.</p>

<p>"Uncle Clay," said he, "we're partners, aren't we?"</p>

<p>"The best ever," said the other.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't touch your money, Uncle Clay. I'm sorry, but I
can't."</p>

<p>He bowed his head.</p>

<p>"All right," said Clay Winton. "That's that. And I won't
argue. In the long run, clean hands are the best hands, I
suppose."</p>

<p>They started down the hill together. It had been a long march,
but the step of Ever Winton was as easy and swaying as when he
had started.</p>

<p>"That Green River business, Uncle Clay," he remarked. "You
mind talking about it?"</p>

<p>"Not a whit&mdash;to you."</p>

<p>"Did they ever get after you?"</p>

<p>"I faded out of the picture, grew mustaches, and came home to
your father to get older. They never bothered me any."</p>

<p>"Another thing"</p>

<p>"Fire away, Ever."</p>

<p>"Anybody very badly damaged because of the money you
took?"</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know," said the older man. "The bank didn't
fail, if that's what you mean."</p>

<p>"That's the main part," muttered the boy.</p>

<p>"Make you feel pretty bad about me?" asked Clay.</p>

<p>His voice was solemn.</p>

<p>"No, not that," said Everard. "Only it makes me sorry, and
rather down. But it doesn't change my main idea."</p>

<p>"What's the main idea?"</p>

<p>"Well, of all the men I've seen, I'd rather be like you than
any of the rest."</p>

<p>There was a quick exclamation of protest.</p>

<p>"You think that now, Ever," said the other, "but you'll think
better, later on. I've had the luck to be with you when you were
learning things, and I had a few tricks to teach. That's
all!"</p>

<p>Everard was silent for a moment as they entered the chilly air
at the bottom of the hollow. The night was gloriously clear.
Taking a quick, deep breath of the pure air, he looked up to the
sheen of the stars.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you something," he said.</p>

<p>"Fire away, brother."</p>

<p>"You remember when I first started boxing?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember pretty well."</p>

<p>"And you had me box with that big red-headed Peg Wallace?"</p>

<p>"I was a fool to do that," said Clay Winton. "He was too big
and too old for you. His strength had hardened on him a lot; he
was a lot nigher to a man than a boy."</p>

<p>"That was all right," said the boy. "You remember how he kept
slamming me in the side and the stomach?"</p>

<p>"I remember. I thought his fist was going through you, a
coupla times."</p>

<p>"So did I," said Ever. "I could feel it jar right up against
my backbone, it seemed to me. It kept me bending over, the pain
of it."</p>

<p>"I remember," said Clay Winton.</p>

<p>"And then he would whang me in the body, and change to the
head, and knock me flat."</p>

<p>"I remember that, too."</p>

<p>"And every time he knocked me flat, you stood over me and
swung your arm up and down for the seconds. And every time, as I
got up to my knee, you said that I'd done enough, and asked me if
I wanted to give up."</p>

<p>"I did that. And I meant it."</p>

<p>"No," said the boy. "There's the point. You said it, but you
didn't mean it."</p>

<p>Clay Winton was silent.</p>

<p>"You'd rather have seen me killed than to hear me give up,"
said Ever.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;maybe," drawled the uncle.</p>

<p>"I thought I was going to die," said the boy. "And every time
I got up, I looked at your face, and you looked so white and sick
that I thought it would be a lot better to die than to shame you
and the rest of the Wintons. So I kept on, until I managed to
start left-handing him. Then I put a big red bump where one eye
used to be."</p>

<p>"Aye, that was the old sharp-shooting," cried out the older
man, joyously. "That was hitting the target. Doggone me! I ain't
gonna forget how he winced when you kept on whacking the spot.
Remember how he backed up, finally, and said it wasn't fair to
keep hitting on one spot?"</p>

<p>"That didn't matter," said the boy. "After he quit, I was
pretty sick."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember."</p>

<p>"I had to lie down on my back and you squatted beside me and
rubbed my sore stomach and my ribs. But I kept on groaning, and
groaning. I couldn't help groaning."</p>

<p>"It was enough to groan over," said Clay.</p>

<p>"I didn't care much about the groaning," answered the boy. "I
didn't care at all, because I knew after that fight that all the
rest of the life that lay ahead of me, I'd always rather die than
give up. That's no trick, and that's what you taught me. I owe it
to you."</p>

<p>"It's a lot, and no mistake," said his uncle. "But you don't
owe it to me. The Wintons are that way. They don't give up."</p>

<p>"Anyway," said the boy, "I had to get that out of my system. I
had to try to tell you what you've done for me. And at the same
time, I can't tell you that I'll take your money. I don't know
why; it just goes against the grain."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it any longer," replied Clay Winton.
"Between you and me, Ever, there can't be any dispute. You don't
want stolen money, and I don't blame you. And there it is."</p>

<p>"We'd better sing out to Harry Lawson," remarked Clay, as they
drew near to the house. "If we walk in on that old-timer when
he's in the middle of a bad dream, he's likely to wake up
shooting." So he called out: "Harry Lawson! Hello!"</p>

<p>They came up to the shack in time to see a shadowy form appear
in the black square of the doorway. A moment later a lantern was
lighted, and Harry Lawson came out to meet them, with a grunt and
a nod of welcome.</p>

<p>"I've come over to make you a proposition about the Red
Pacer," said Ever.</p>

<p>The other grunted, nodded, handed the lantern to Clay Winton,
took the pack from behind the saddle of the horse, and then led
the mustang off toward the barn.</p>

<p>"He's dumb, today," said the boy. "I was here for hours. He
made a few signs, but never spoke."</p>

<p>"He's an old-timer," answered Clay Winton. "They're likely to
be queer. He's taken the pack off the horse and gone to put it
up; he's given us the lantern so we can go inside and make
ourselves at home. A coupla gestures like that are better than a
flock of words."</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch13" name="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; ONE OF THE BATTY
ONES</h2>

<p class="first">BY the time they had brought the pack into the
shack and looked around them, at the few sticks of furniture and
the two bunks, only one of which had blankets or a pallet on the
boards, the half-breed was back again.</p>

<p>He pointed toward the stove with an inquiring air, as Winton
unstrapped his blankets.</p>

<p>"We're not hungry," said Clay Winton.</p>

<p>At that the half-breed picked one of the blankets from the
stack out of which he had just rolled, twisted it around his body
from head to foot, turning himself into a mummy with one arm
outside the wrappings, and lay down on the hard boards of the
floor. His greenish felt hat he pulled over his eyes to shut out
the lantern light, and in half a minute he was snoring
softly.</p>

<p>The boy had attempted to protest against this giving up of a
bed, but his uncle prevented him with a strong signal.</p>

<p>"No good," he remarked as the snoring began. "Harry can't
change his ways. He's making us comfortable, as well as he can.
That's all. Don't try to interrupt him. Let him be as he is!"</p>

<p>He bedded down his own blankets on the opposite bunk, leaving
Everard to stare with uncomfortable curiosity at the heap which
the half-breed had just left. However, it did not do to be too
particular. He rolled into the warmth and presently he was
asleep.</p>

<p>"The morning's a better time for you to talk hoss to old
Harry, anyway," his uncle advised him, in saying good-night.</p>

<p>The two were awake at the same moment in the morning as the
gray of the dawn began to turn golden. The sound of chopping
roused them, and as they turned out they saw Harry Lawson
swinging an ax beside a pile of tangled brush.</p>

<p>Clay Winton went out and took the ax from the half-breed.</p>

<p>"You know where the chuck is in the house," he said. "You
start up the fire with what you've chopped and I'll bring in an
armful."</p>

<p>Harry Lawson, instead of replying to this suggestion, turned
his broad expressionless face down the hill toward the hollow,
where the creek spread itself out in a considerable pool. Everard
was running down the slope, loosening his clothes as he went.
Now, on the bank, he flung the garments aside and flashed like a
bolt of bronze into the icy water.</p>

<p>Not a ripple formed over the spot where he had disappeared, it
seemed. Harry Lawson looked with a shudder of profound interest.
His red-stained eyes looked aside toward the face of Clay Winton,
and the latter, poising the ax above his shoulder for a stroke,
nodded.</p>

<p>"He's all leather," he remarked. "He'd break ice to get his
morning swim."</p>

<p>The head and shoulders of the diver broke water at a distance,
in the pool; with powerfully swaying arms and shoulders, he drove
himself across to the farther bank, climbed out, ran up the
slanting trunk of a tree, and dived off again.</p>

<p>This time, well after he had disappeared, the sound of the
plunge came dimly up to their ears, like a very faint and far-away explosion.</p>

<p>Halfway across the face of the water, the head and arms of
Everard Winton appeared again. He stood on the shore, whipping
the water off his body. Then, squatting on his heels, while the
wind blew him dry, he lathered his face and shaved.</p>

<p>The half-breed grunted.</p>

<p>"All that's not leather in him is iron," said Clay Winton,
proudly. "Anybody else would get rheumatism and double pneumonia.
But there's no let-up in him. You can't dent him&mdash;not with
bullets, you can't."</p>

<p>Harry Lawson went back to the shack, and presently smoke was
curling out of the top of the chimney. At the same time, the boy
was dressed and back, making himself useful, rolling up his
uncle's pack, laying out the tins and knives and forks on the
table, and finally jogging out to the horse shed where he saddled
Clay Winton's mustang and brought it back in front of the shack,
prepared for an early start.</p>

<p>While he was away on this errand, as the bacon crisped in the
pan, Clay Winton was saying to the veteran, "Look here, Harry.
That nephew of mine wants the Red Pacer, and wants him bad. You
got a high price stuck on the hoss. Two thousand, eh? Well,
that's a lot, but I ain't here to bargain with you. What he wants
to do is to make a bargain with you. If you'll guarantee not to
sell the Pacer for a month or so, he'll come back and bring you
the money&mdash;with interest, too. You understand?"</p>

<p>Harry Lawson nodded.</p>

<p>"Would you do that?" asked Clay Winton.</p>

<p>The half-breed shook his head.</p>

<p>"I thought you might not," said Winton, though he frowned a
little at the gesture. "But he's dead set on having that horse. I
don't mind telling you he's stepped out of his home and gone on
the road without a penny in his pocket or a hoss to ride on,
because he had trouble with his folks about the Red Pacer."</p>

<p>The coffee pot began to simmer. Harry Lawson, as though
totally uninterested in this tale, pulled the pot farther back on
the stove and paid no heed to Clay Winton. The latter went
on:</p>

<p>"But I'll tell what I'll do. I'll pay you the two thousand,
cash. I have it on me, Harry. I'll pay you the money, and when he
makes his talk to you, you tell him that you're willing to take
his word for paying, later on. Say you'll let him have the
stallion on trust. But don't tell him about my part in this. Does
that sound good to you?"</p>

<p>He counted out a sheaf of bills as he spoke, and held them
out.</p>

<p>But the other shook his head.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Winton, rather angrily. "That's
money&mdash;that's the two thousand you asked for the hoss. Why
won't you take it?"</p>

<p>Harry Lawson turned his back, took the pan of bacon off the
stove, and began to serve it out, with stale, warmed-over pone on
the plates. This, together with coffee, made up the
breakfast.</p>

<p>The boy had come back by now, and his uncle held his peace;
but there was a grim look in his eye. Terseness and bluntness may
be forgiven in old sourdoughs, up to a certain point, but there
are limits, always, which must not be passed.</p>

<p>They had finished eating and were on their second round of
coffee when young Everard began his proposal to the half-breed.</p>

<p>The latter sat back in his chair, expressionless as a carved
Buddha, holding a cigarette between thumb and forefinger. Whether
he listened or not could hardly be told, for his eyes were a
blank.</p>

<p>So, with increasing difficulty, Ever stumbled through to an
ending. Then he waited, intent, fairly crouched with
eagerness.</p>

<p>Still there was no answer.</p>

<p>Clay Winton broke in, "It's no good, Ever. He won't let you
have the hoss. I dunno why. I tell you what I did. I went behind
your back and offered him two thousand dollars hard cash on the
spot, if he'd turn that mustang over to you. But he won't do
it."</p>

<p>Everard Winton jumped up from his chair, his face hard and his
dim blue eyes utterly altered, as though a storm wind had blown
over them and cleared the mist away. Then he cried out:</p>

<p>"Yesterday afternoon you were going to sell the Pacer to me
for two thousand. What's come over you that's changed your mind?
That's what I want to know."</p>

<p>Harry Lawson looked straight before him, with red, unconscious
eyes. It was as though he had been facing for hours the very wind
which had merely sharpened the vision of the boy.</p>

<p>Clay sat back and watched. There was trouble coming,
perhaps&mdash;big trouble, it might be&mdash;unless Harry Lawson
decided to speak. Every second the suspense grew, and nerves were
tightened as the pressure increased. And always the fire glinted
more and more brightly in Everard's eyes as he waited.</p>

<p>At last the half-breed muttered, "You're like that damn Harry
Lawson. You want that damn hoss too much."</p>

<p>The other two stared at each other. Harry Lawson got up from
his chair and stalked out of the shack.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of it, Uncle Clay?" demanded the boy.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the other. "Maybe Harry's lived alone too
long. Sounds a bit batty, to me."</p>

<p>"That long hunt of the Red Pacer, and the way his place had
gone to wreck," suggested Ever. "That may have had something to
do with it."</p>

<p>The uncle nodded. Then, squinting his eyes, he repeated, "What
was he driving at? What did you do with that horse the other
day?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. He piled me a couple of times, that was all. Then I
took a chance at him bareback, and the chance worked. It was the
saddle that had been bothering him, and"</p>

<p>"You took a chance bareback!"</p>

<p>"Yes. He'd bucked the saddle off twice. The second time he
smashed it."</p>

<p>"So you took a chance on the Pacer bareback?" said Clay
again.</p>

<p>"Yes. I was pretty dizzy, and old Harry Lawson was laughing at
me. It made me a little mad."</p>

<p>"You tried him bareback, eh&mdash;and it worked? You tried the
Red Pacer bareback? Well, Ever, it ain't old Harry Lawson that's
batty; it's you! What were you thinkin' of?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking of riding the horse. That was all."</p>

<p>Everard got up from his chair and began to pace the floor.</p>

<p>"Don't be worrying about it," said his uncle. "You can't
figure it out. Something's got stuck in Old Harry's superstitious
mind, and you can't budge him away from his ideas. Here comes
somebody, riding up. Let's go and see who it is."</p>

<p>He went to the door and saw three riders swinging rapidly up
the slope from the hollow toward the house. One rode in the lead
and two others kept a little back.</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch14" name="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; TIMBERLINE</h2>

<p class="first">EVEN from a distance, it is easy to tell how a
man is riding, whether carelessly or grimly or in slowenly or
businesslike fashion.</p>

<p>There was a swing and rhythm to the galloping of this trio;
the very beat of the hoofs made a cadence that for a moment drew
the boy away from his half gloomy, half savage thoughts.</p>

<p>He joined his uncle outside the door of the cabin.</p>

<p>"They want something, those boys," declared Clay Winton.</p>

<p>The dust they raised was now blown away, and the riders
emerged clearly and drew up near the house; three cowpunchers
from the range, as it seemed, but&mdash;</p>

<p>"They've got some hossflesh under 'em&mdash;for plain
cowhands," said Clay.</p>

<p>So they had. In fact, they had plenty of daylight under them.
Their mounts had legs, and they had bone, too.</p>

<p>They were no better groomed than ordinary cow-ponies, but the
quality was there and it showed through the dust.</p>

<p>The riders dismounted. Two of them stayed with the horses; the
third rider strode forward, demanding:</p>

<p>"Where's Harry Lawson?"</p>

<p>"At the corral, there," said Clay Winton.</p>

<p>His eyes followed the stranger as he walked away. A curious
calm had come upon Clay's face, and his eyes, of the Winton blue,
were mistier than ever and more gentle. But the boy was not
deceived. He knew that his uncle had seen something that was of
the utmost interest.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the stranger was a man to be marked in a
thousand. He had the carriage and the voice of one accustomed to
command, and though he was only of average height, his bearing
made him seem taller. The sunken eyes, the deeply marked
features, made him seem one who had lived through many a busy
decade; but second thought declared him to be no more than in his
middle twenties. The two who followed him were older by years, in
fact, but it was plain that they were under his control. They
stood back, talking quietly to one another, until their leader
drew away.</p>

<p>Harry Lawson sat on the top rail of the corral fence, bunched
up like a buzzard on a perch. He was watching the stallion.
Nothing about him moved except his head, whenever the Red Pacer
stepped to another bunch of grass and tore at it or whirled, with
a flash of fire along his silken flanks to defy the half-breed
With his eye. So might an Indian worshipper in the old days have
squatted at the door of a temple and adored the golden god of the
sun.</p>

<p>Everard Winton saw and understood now why mere money could
hardly buy this treasure from Harry Lawson. It would be almost
miraculous if many, many thousands of dollars could induce the
half-breed to part with the great horse. Something more than
money would be needed.</p>

<p>Then one of the strangers asked, "That the Pacer, over
yonder?"</p>

<p>"That's the Pacer," nodded Everard Winton.</p>

<p>"He looks like a hoss," said the stranger.</p>

<p>"He is a horse," said Everard.</p>

<p>"He stands over some ground," said the second stranger,
shading his eyes and peering at the glistening form of the
stallion in the corral.</p>

<p>"He's got a middle-piece, too," declared the first speaker,
likewise shading his eyes.</p>

<p>"Think Lawson would sell him?" asked the first.</p>

<p>"Maybe. To a man that can ride him," said Clay Winton.</p>

<p>"The chief'll ride him if anybody can," said the second
stranger, with confidence.</p>

<p>"The chief'll ride him," said the first.</p>

<p>The "chief," in the meantime, with long, swift strides had
come to the half-breed. They spoke together for a moment, Harry
Lawson gestured briefly toward the horse, and the "chief" turned
and sang out briskly:</p>

<p>"Get a saddle on the Pacer, boys. Jump to it!"</p>

<p>In an instant, they had a saddle off one of their horses, and
on the run they went for the corral.</p>

<p>"You know that first man?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Got an idea," murmured Clay Winton. "Only an idea, that may
not be worth a rap. I'd put him down"</p>

<p>He paused, his voice trailing away, while he frowned. The boy
waited. He knew his uncle well enough to understand that he was
not to be pressed.</p>

<p>"Timberline, I guess" said Clay Winton. "Probably the one
called Timberline."</p>

<p>The boy started. He had heard that name many times. A thousand
wild exploits were connected with the name of Timberline, so-called because he was constantly crossing and re-crossing the
naked heights of the mountains; was constantly appearing where he
was least expected.</p>

<p>As to the man's character, he was believed to be one of those
who hover on the verge of the law, sometimes inside it and
sometimes outside. He had been town marshal half a dozen times,
in this or that little wild frontier camp which some gold rush
had filled for the moment with adventurous, lawless men. On such
occasions he enforced the law, not because he loved the law, but
because he was given such a free hand with his guns. Again, when
the Cavendish band had established themselves as the most
successful large-scale rustlers in the West, Timberline had taken
the job in hand and fairly run the band to the ground.</p>

<p>But he had not always been a supporter of law and order. Not
once but many times he had been tried on the ugly charge of
murder, and though in each instance he had been cleared for "self
defense," even the liberal Western interpretation of that term
which made a "hip motion" equivalent to the drawing of a gun
could not entirely cover up the stigma that began to&mdash;attach
to the name of Timberline. A man may be cornered once, twice, or
even three times, and have to fight for his life. But rarely on
more occasions than that. And though the law may clear him,
public opinion will not.</p>

<p>Besides, it was often wondered how Timberline got his income.
He was never without funds, it was said, and he was generally to
be seen riding with companions who were often of dubious
character. Once or twice, crimes other than gun fighting had been
laid to him, but he had freed himself from these with equal
ease.</p>

<p>Finally, the range split wide open on the question, one-half
taking Timberline's side, and the other half declaring that he
was no better than a sheer adventurer who lived by the keenness
of his wits and the accuracy of his talented six-shooters.</p>

<p>All of these things flowed through Everard Winton's mind as he
heard the man's name.</p>

<p>"Timberline will ride the Pacer," said Clay Winton. "If
anybody can, he will."</p>

<p>"Timberline will ride him," said the boy gloomily. "Timberline
was the fellow who rode that circus devil of a no-good pinto man-killer, down in Texas. Wasn't that Timberline?"</p>

<p>"He's the one who did it. He rode the famous Baldy," said Clay
Winton. "And if he could ride Baldy, he can ride about anything,
I suppose. I saw Baldy pile three of the best bronc busters in
the world&mdash;all in twenty minutes, and him taking it
easy."</p>

<p>The stallion was calmly submitting to rope and bridle and
saddle.</p>

<p>"He ought to be easy to-day," said Clay Winton. "My nephew,
here, took the edge off him yesterday, Timberline."</p>

<p>At the word, the other spun about.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"My name is Clay Winton."</p>

<p>"And you say your nephew rode the Pacer?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Timberline turned to the half-breed.</p>

<p>"What about it?" he asked.</p>

<p>Harry Lawson nodded, and at that Timberline looked squarely at
Ever. For the boy that glance was a colder plunge than that which
young Winton had taken in the icy water of the pool that morning.
He felt himself being measured and weighed.</p>

<p>"You could ride him but you couldn't ride him away, eh?" said
Timberline.</p>

<p>"Lawson wouldn't sell," said Ever.</p>

<p>He was surprised at the violence with which he spoke. He could
feel the outthrust of his chin, and the tightening of his brow in
a frown.</p>

<p>Timberline looked him up and down with some surprise, and then
turned away with a smile.</p>

<p>A haze of black anger swept across Ever's eyes. Then he
remembered, like the dinning of a bell in his ears, the voice of
his uncle saying, years ago: "Always see clear! Always see
clear."</p>

<p>It was a bad time, now, to allow his vision to be clouded.</p>

<p>He saw the glance of Harry Lawson fixed upon him. It was
almost impossible to guess at anything in the mind of the half-breed by trying to read his face, but it seemed to Everard Winton
that he could detect a sort of dim, savage curiosity in the
solitary's eyes. It made Ever want to fight for his rights, but
he was in such a position that there was nothing to fight
against.</p>

<p>The stallion was saddled at last, and Timberline went up to it
with a quick step, as though he was about to fling himself into
the saddle. He seemed accustomed to hurling himself at
difficulties and sweeping them quickly out of the way. The
greater the wall, Ever guessed, the more furiously he would
attack it.</p>

<p>However, he was not as headlong as all that. He first looked
to the fit of the bridle, had the check pieces let out, and then
the throat latch tightened. After that he carefully tested the
tautness of the girths, but found nothing wrong there.</p>

<p>Then he was suddenly in the saddle, and the horse was
loosed.</p>

<p>Up it bounded, and plunged away across the corral, bucking
like an inspired fiend.</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch15" name="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; A TRICK HOSS</h2>

<p class="first">WELL and nobly did Timberline then live up to
his great reputation as a rider. It seemed that he was reading
the mind of the stallion and forestalling its moves and plunges
whole seconds before they were made. He lost a stirrup in the
first mad circling of the corral, but he caught it again in a
moment.</p>

<p>"Look at him, Al!" cried the smaller and darker of
Timberline's two followers.</p>

<p>"Look at him, Garry!" cried the larger man, slapping his
thigh. "The horse ain't been born that can throw that gent. Not
even a sun-fishin' fence rowin' son of trouble like the Pacer!
He's gonna make that hoss eat out of his hand&mdash;hai!"</p>

<p>The last loud yell was an unexpected termination of his
speech. The Red Pacer spun in a sudden circle, checked in an
equally sudden reverse, and the rider shot sidelong through the
air and landed rolling.</p>

<p>The stallion whirled about and raced for the fallen man, with
a savagery that amazed Everard Winton. He had seen nothing of
this sort in the fight of the day before. On that occasion, the
Pacer had fought as though he understood the rules of the
game!</p>

<p>"He'll get the chief!" grunted big Al, and snatched out a
gun.</p>

<p>Everard reached swiftly out and struck up the hand of the
other. Al had not had time to fire. He saw his master roll and
scramble to safety underneath the rails of the fence;
nevertheless, he was maddened by Ever's intervention, and swung
about on him, savagely.</p>

<p>"What in hell d'you mean by that?" he demanded.</p>

<p>He was a big, powerfully built fellow, and constant riding had
made him lean and fit, so that the expanse of his shoulders
loomed out wide. Yet after enduring Timberline's glance, it was
easy to meet the gaze of this fellow called Al.</p>

<p>"This is a fair fight between a man and a horse," said the
boy. "It's not murder!"</p>

<p>"No?" said Al. "And this ain't murder, neither!"</p>

<p>He had dropped his gun back into the holster that hung
conveniently far down his thigh, ready for a quick draw. Now he
reached a pile-driving fist straight at young Everard Winton's
face.</p>

<p>It was a very great mistake to start the punch at all. It was
a still greater mistake to telegraph the punch by pulling his
hand far back of his shoulder. Ever simply stepped inside the
drive of the punch, and dropped his crooked elbow into the hollow
of his arm.</p>

<p>Al stepped back with a curse.</p>

<p>"You've broke my arm, you young rat!" he snarled.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Al?" demanded Garry, as though eager to
share the trouble with his companion.</p>

<p>"This here" began Al.</p>

<p>But Clay Winton cut in, gently, "Rats have teeth. Don't corner
'em, brothers!"</p>

<p>They looked suddenly aside at the speaker, and saw there what
rougher and tougher men than they had seen before&mdash;a faint
smile, as though Clay was enjoying a curious pleasure. Their own
temperatures diminished, instantly.</p>

<p>"What're you about?" shouted Timberline. "Out there and catch
that red piece of murder! Jump to it!"</p>

<p>They jumped to it, forgetful of their private grievances.</p>

<p>"Thanks, said Everard briefly, to his uncle.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Clay Winton. "You could handle the
two of 'em&mdash;unless they got to their guns. Only, it's bad
business, with Timberline on the lot."</p>

<p>"Timberline won't join 'em," answered the boy, with a sudden
decision.</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"No, he won't join 'em. Not after the Pacer's through with
him!"</p>

<p>"Why, Ever," said the other, "he nearly rode him the first
time. He'll have a good chance, the second."</p>

<p>They had caught the horse again, when Ever remarked, "Why,
it's true that Timberline may have learned something about the
horse, but the horse has learned a lot more about
Timberline."</p>

<p>"Who told you?" grinned Clay Winton.</p>

<p>"The Pacer did," said Everard, and grinned in return.</p>

<p>Timberline had joined his helpers. They muttered to him, and
he turned his stern head and looked back over his shoulder. Ever
heard him say, calmly:</p>

<p>"I'll attend to that later on."</p>

<p>Then he was in the saddle once more.</p>

<p>He sat that saddle for ten amazing seconds, while the stallion
tied himself in knots in the air and smote the ground to untangle
them. Then over the animal went, backwards, quick as a cat. True,
Timberline was out of the saddle and back into it, both feet in
the stirrups, as the horse lurched to all fours again. But the
next moment the stallion whirled like a spinning top, and at the
second turning of the red wheel, Timberline was hurled sidewise
again and landed sprawling and skidding, directly in front of the
spot where Everard Winton stood.</p>

<p>Flat on his face, and motionless, lay the fallen man, with the
stallion wheeling to rush for him. Then something put Everard
through the bars of the fence and made him stand over Timberline,
while the red streak of murder bore down at him with flattened
cars and mouth gaping terribly.</p>

<p>For hideous danger, nothing in the world can compare with the
charge of a savage horse. Yet all the while Everard Winton was
shouting loudly:</p>

<p>"Don't shoot him! Don't shoot!"</p>

<p>And holding up his hands, he awaited the charge.</p>

<p>Just over him, the stallion checked on planted hoofs, reared,
obscured the morning sun with his towering crest, and then
swerved away instead of beating his forehoofs through Ever's
body. Then off he went, at that flowing pace, and stood in a far
corner of the corral.</p>

<p>Everard leaned over and raised Timberline's limp body. The man
was quite senseless, and there was a streak of blood on one
temple. Yet he was not dead. His breast moved slowly as he
breathed.</p>

<p>Everard drew him back to the fence; the others pulled him
through to safety.</p>

<p>"What made you do that?" muttered Uncle Clay Winton, when his
nephew was beside him once more.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the other. "I can't tell you just how I
got inside the corral; I just found myself there."</p>

<p>His uncle nodded, with baffled, bewildered eyes. In the
background Everard saw old Harry Lawson, one eye cocked toward
the stallion, and a broad grin upon his face. Something had
happened that Harry, it seemed, could understand perfectly!</p>

<p>Timberline was sitting up now, and the others heard Al's
muttering voice say to the leader:</p>

<p>"The kid, there, jumped through and turned the rush of the
Pacer. I dunno how he done it. Looked easier to stop a landslide,
but he kept singin' out not to shoot. So I didn't shoot, though
it looked a sure thing that the hoss would get the two of you.
The Pacer means murder. It looks like the kid had him trained to
do tricks!"</p>

<p>Timberline sat back against a fence post, his eyes closed and
his jaw set hard.</p>

<p>"Well, he did it quicker than the first time," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"Yeah. It was a little quicker," said Al. "But he ain't a
hoss. He's a tangled-up streak of lightning, is what he is when
he starts to buck."</p>

<p>"He spins with me," said Timberline, faintly. "Nobody can
stand that, I don't suppose. Not the way he does it."</p>

<p>"He knows the one sure way," agreed Al.</p>

<p>"Call that boy over here."</p>

<p>"Hey, kid!" called Al, bruskly. "Come here!"</p>

<p>"Go on," urged Uncle Clay, softly.</p>

<p>So the boy stepped over to where Timberline lay.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked.</p>

<p>The closed eyes of the injured man did not open.</p>

<p>"The Pacer hit me in the bull's-eye, that time," said
Timberline. "I won't be riding so well the rest of today. But
I'll tell you what&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice stopped suddenly. There was no change in his
expression, but it was plain that a touch of pain had checked
him.</p>

<p>The boy waited, and presently the other went on, "I'd give
something to see you handle that brute of a red devil."</p>

<p>"I had luck yesterday," said young Winton. "Maybe not
today."</p>

<p>"I'll make a little bet with you."</p>

<p>"I have no money."</p>

<p>"A hundred dollars to the boots you stand in."</p>

<p>"What's your wager?"</p>

<p>"That you can't stick to him for a full minute."</p>

<p>"I'll take that," said Everard.</p>

<p>It was a little odd, perhaps, that Timberline had found no
words for gratitude. A little matter of the saving of his
life&mdash;that was all! And the boy smiled faintly; the smile
that had been on the lips of his uncle not many minutes
before.</p>

<p>He turned toward the corral, where the stallion had given up
trying to buck off the firmly cinched saddle.</p>

<p>"I use your saddle?" he asked, turning back to Timberline.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that'll be all right."</p>

<p>Everard Winton slid between the bars, walked straight out to
the horse, and saw the latter turn quickly around and face him,
ears back, nostrils dangerously spread.</p>

<p>But in a moment the great horse lifted his head somewhat, and
his ears pricked slowly forward.</p>

<p>"It's a trick hoss!" called the voice of Al, loudly. "Look at
that! It's a damn trick hoss!"</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch16" name="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; HELL IS RAW</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was no struggle. The same recognition
which the stallion had given to Ever the day before, it gave
again now. Everard Winton mounted, sat still and cautious in the
saddle, vainly awaiting the explosion of frantic bucking. With a
thrill, he realized that the Red Pacer was docile now. Then he
guided the great horse easily around the corral.</p>

<p>He saw Timberline, standing up and holding by an upper rail of
the fence, looking somberly forth upon this scene. Ever patted
the side of the Red Pacer, and the stallion struck out a flowing
stride. Swerving at the corners of the corral fence, he doubled
back and forth like a wolf before the bars of its cage, eager to
be away. Ever felt that the rider of such an animal would be as
much ruler of the range as the eagle is ruler of the air.</p>

<p>The boy's spirit leaped. Then he swung down to the ground.</p>

<p>"Is that riding him?" he asked Timberline.</p>

<p>"That's riding him," said the man, darkly. He added, "Al, give
the kid a hundred dollars."</p>

<p>Big Al drew out a wallet, carefully thumbed over several notes
and handed them to young Winton as the latter slid between the
bars of the fence again. Garry, Timberline's second follower, was
already stripping the saddle from the back of the stallion,
taking off the bridle.</p>

<p>"Here you are, boy," said Al, holding out the sheaf of
money.</p>

<p>A very odd and uncontrollable impulse came over Everard Winton
when he hard that word "boy." He looked down at the money and
back at Al's face.</p>

<p>I take money from friends, not from you," he said.</p>

<p>For him it was the only money in the world, just then, but he
could not avoid the remark.</p>

<p>"So I ain't good enough to put money in your hand?" said
Al.</p>

<p>In the distance, Ever saw the half-breed, the same yawning,
red-eyed, wolfish smile upon his face.</p>

<p>"Steady, Ever!" cautioned his uncle.</p>

<p>But the words came out in spite of Ever; he could not master
them or put them down.</p>

<p>"No," he was saying. "You're not good enough to put money in
my hand."</p>

<p>"Am I good enough to put my hand in your face, then?" demanded
Al, and a second time he struck, with all his might.</p>

<p>He did not make the mistake, on this occasion, of taking so
much deliberate ease in delivering the blow. Instead, he drove a
snapping jab from his hip toward Ever's chin.</p>

<p>It seemed to the onlookers&mdash;except to the practiced eye
of Clay Winton, perhaps&mdash;that the blow had landed and
knocked young Winton's head sidewise onto his shoulder. Only big
Al could realize that he was driving his clenched hand through
empty air; for the target had fallen away from him, and his
knuckles barely grazed the cheek. Then his arms were caught and
held; and he was tied up in secure fashion while Ever asked
calmly, over his shoulder:</p>

<p>"Shall I hit this clumsy fool, Uncle Clay?"</p>

<p>"No, don't hit him," said Clay Winton, with equal calm. "Throw
him over your hip, but don't hit him."</p>

<p>It was no sooner said than done. Al's fighting bulk struggled
vainly. For all his weight and tension, he was caught by hands
that seemed to have magic in their touch and was flung suddenly
and heavily to the ground. Even his own weight seemed to fight
against him.</p>

<p>Al stared up at the calm face above him. He rose to one elbow,
and then reached for a gun.</p>

<p>"Drop that!" snapped Timberline's voice.</p>

<p>Al allowed his fingers to slide from the handle of the Colt
revolver; then he rose slowly to his feet.</p>

<p>"You'll take your lickings, when they come the way this one
did," Timberline was saying. "Don't clutter up my trail with
murder, you lanky fool."</p>

<p>There was no answer, though Al's face was black.</p>

<p>Timberline turned to Harry Lawson. "What's the price on that
horse?" he demanded.</p>

<p>The other raised five fingers.</p>

<p>"Five thousand is four thousand too much," said
Timberline.</p>

<p>Lawson shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>There was only a moment of pause.</p>

<p>"I'll take him, though," said Timberline. "Garry, lead the
Pacer out. I'm buying him. Al, pay Lawson five thousand."</p>

<p>It was done in a dizzy trice, and the world suddenly began to
spin around before Ever's eyes. Then Timberline stood before him,
saying:</p>

<p>"Did you make that stallion a trick horse?"</p>

<p>"I never saw him before yesterday," answered Ever,
frankly.</p>

<p>Timberline stepped back and looked suddenly from Lawson and
Clay Winton to Ever. Then he was asking:</p>

<p>"Your name is Winton, eh?"</p>

<p>The boy stared at the great horse as Garry led it out of the
corral.</p>

<p>"I'm Everard Winton," said he, in a mechanical voice.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, Winton," said Timberline. "If you want to ride
with me, for a while, you can take that horse."</p>

<p>Everard was too amazed to make an answer.</p>

<p>"He would have mopped up the dust of the corral with me,
except for you," said Timberline. "So if you want to ride with
me, Winton, the Pacer is your horse&mdash;every inch of him!"</p>

<p>Lawson's voice broke in, surprisingly: "Then I don't sell him!
I don't sell you the hoss. Here&mdash;you take back your
money!"</p>

<p>He came hurrying forward, holding out the bills.</p>

<p>Timberline merely smiled. "I've paid the money. You've taken
it. I've got the horse," said he. "You can't go back on
that."</p>

<p>Harry Lawson hesitated. He halted, and his chin thrust out in
ugly fashion.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Winton?" asked Timberline. "Why don't
you want him to own the Pacer? He's the only man in the world who
can ride him!"</p>

<p>"Yeah. He can ride him. But where'll he take the Pacer, and
where'll the Pacer take him?"</p>

<p>"What the devil do you mean by that?" asked Timberline, and
then turned back to Everard. "Coming with me, Winton?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Ever, in bewilderment, stared at his uncle; and his heart fell
when he saw the latter make an almost undiscernible sign of
dissent.</p>

<p>"I'm staying with my uncle," said Everard, slowly. "I'm
thanking you&mdash;but I stay with him."</p>

<p>Timberline snapped his fingers. "I've given you your chance,"
he said, briskly. Then he added to his followers, "Saddle up.
We're starting. We've got a way to go before night. Put the Pacer
on the lead, Al. Put a double lead on him. The big devil looks
strong enough to break one line, or to run away with the horse
and man at the end of it."</p>

<p>Accordingly, the saddle was replaced on Timberline's own
horse. The red stallion was put on a double lead, and the three
men re-mounted. Al had not spoken during all this time, but now,
reining his horse a little to the side, he loomed huge above
Everard Winton.</p>

<p>"I don't forget, kid!" said he, sourly.</p>

<p>Timberline, an instant later, remarked, "I'm one down to you,
Winton. I'm sorry that you wouldn't take the horse and ride with
me. I stop at places you might like to see. But you know your own
business&mdash;or your uncle knows it for you. Still, the trick
I'm down I may have a chance to make up to you before the game's
over. Come on, boys. So long, everybody!"</p>

<p>He touched his long-legged sprinter with the spurs and
galloped away in a straight line, the others following more
slowly, leading the great red horse between them.</p>

<p>Clay Winton turned on Harry Lawson.</p>

<p>"You played a raw trick there, Harry," he said.</p>

<p>The half-breed stared grimly about the disappearing group,
paying no attention to the remark, except to say, eventually:</p>

<p>"Hell is raw, too. And Timberline&mdash;he's got it!"</p>

<p>And he grinned, red-eyed. He looked more like a wolf than
ever, thought young Everard Winton.</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch17" name="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; HAWK OR
BUZZARD</h2>

<p class="first">LAWSON went back to the rear pasture with no
more words, and Clay Winton returned with his nephew, slowly,
toward the shack. In front of it he saddled the mustang.</p>

<p>"You think I've let you down, Ever," he suggested. "But I
tried to back you up. I offered that crazy half-breed two
thousand on the side, if he'd let you have the hoss; but he
wouldn't do it. He's got something in his head. I dunno what it
is. He's batty, I guess. Plain batty!"</p>

<p>"There's something in Lawson's head," said Everard Winton.
"He'd sell that horse to me for two thousand, yet he made
Timberline pay five. You noticed another thing: that when he
thought I was going to join Timberline for the sake of the
stallion, Harry Lawson wanted to cancel the sale. Well, that
means something."</p>

<p>"What?" asked Clay.</p>

<p>"It looks," said Everard, "as though Harry really wanted me to
have the Pacer, but wanted me to ride him on a straight road, and
inside the law. I may be wrong, but that's the way it hits
me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're right," nodded Clay. "But nobody can
understand what goes on inside the head of old Harry Lawson."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you take the hundred that you'd won, fair and
square, from Timberline?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," muttered the boy. "I want the money now. I
need it. Yet I couldn't take it then."</p>

<p>"Tainted money, eh?" demanded his uncle, rather sarcastically.
"Same old story?"</p>

<p>Everard shook his head.</p>

<p>"I don't know why it was," said he. "I had the feeling I
wanted to put my hands on that fellow Al. I even wanted to put my
hands on him so badly that I couldn't take money from him."</p>

<p>His uncle suddenly laughed. "You remember what old Harry
Lawson said? That you're like him&mdash;you want the Pacer too
much. Well, Ever, all I can say is&mdash; about the
money&mdash;I've seen a bull terrier that wouldn't eat, just
because it saw a chance of a fight to windward. We'd better start
along, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we'd better start along," nodded the boy. "So you
offered Lawson the two thousand?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And still he wouldn't take it?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand why not," said Clay Winton.</p>

<p>"Nor I!" muttered Everard.</p>

<p>They reached the front of the house, and Clay Winton was about
to mount his horse when he said:</p>

<p>"Here's Harry, coming back from the pasture with a horse
towing behind him. We'd better wait to say so-long to him."</p>

<p>The boy made a gesture of indifference. His eyes were
continually turning to that point on the horizon at which the
Pacer and the three riders had disappeared.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Lawson came up with them.</p>

<p>"We're saying so-long," said Clay Winton, "and thanks for
putting us up."</p>

<p>"You wait," answered the half-breed.</p>

<p>He passed into the shack and came out again, carrying a saddle
and bridle which he put on the mustang he had brought up&mdash;a
roach-backed, lump-headed gray mare that looked like a caricature
of a horse, except that it had shoulders as beautifully made, and
as fine a set of legs, as ever a horse moved by. And it would
have been strange to find among the horses of the half-breed,
expert that he was, a single animal that did not have some
remarkable qualities.</p>

<p>Lawson stood back from his pony, remarking:</p>

<p>"A hawk, he flies pretty damn fast, but a buzzard, he goes
just as far in a day."</p>

<p>He indicated the mustang, to give point to his remark. Then he
turned to Ever and added:</p>

<p>"You take this one."</p>

<p>"I haven't a penny to pay for her," said Everard, puzzled.</p>

<p>"You take this one. You pay me pretty good, sometime," replied
the half-breed, enigmatically, and walked away from the house
with a gesture of farewell.</p>

<p>"Is he crazy, Uncle Clay?" asked Ever.</p>

<p>"I don't know," frowned the older man. "I don't think so. It's
just that his brain, it don't work like other brains. He's got
something inside his head, though. He didn't want you on the back
of the Pacer&mdash;and yet he likes you. That's plain, or he
wouldn't give you this hoss, and him down on his luck so far. A
hoss all rigged out, too! I dunno what to say about it, Ever.
Almost seems like he don't think you'd have good luck on the
Pacer."</p>

<p>I remember what he said about raw hell and Timberline having
it," agreed the boy. "He's a little crazy, all right. Hold on!
Here they come back, the three of 'em. And by thunder, Uncle
Clay, they've lost the Pacer!"</p>

<p>For three riders were coming at a round gait, through the gap
in the hills that had swallowed up Timberline and his companions,
with the led stallion. Clay Winton shielded his eyes, and stared
for a long moment.</p>

<p>"Not the same three," he said. "They ride different. There's
one of 'em slopes to the right in the saddle, and none of them
three that just left rides like that."</p>

<p>The riders came on rapidly.</p>

<p>"I'll tie up the gray mare and leave her here for Lawson,"
said Ever.</p>

<p>"Tie her up? Don't you do it," said his uncle. "You tie
yourself to her and take her along."</p>

<p>"But it's too much," said Ever.</p>

<p>"Nothin's too much to take, when an Indian gives it," answered
his companion. "They got reasons, always, behind their gifts.
They give because they wanta give or because they think they
oughta give."</p>

<p>"No, I can't take the mare," said Ever, flatly.</p>

<p>"You better had, Ever. If you wanta make that half-breed
happy, you take his hoss. He means it. Somehow, he's all wrapped
up in you, and you're the first person I ever seen that he give a
damn about. You take that mare of his and don't answer back about
it. You can pay him for her, one of these days."</p>

<p>Ever glanced toward the distant horizon, sighed, nodded. Vast
leagues separated him from the destination of the men who had
bought the Red Pacer, whatever that might be. As yet, it was
totally unknown to him.</p>

<p>"I'll take her, then," he said. "But I'm beginning to think
that it's a queer world, Uncle Clay."</p>

<p>"The older you get, the queerer you'll find it turnin' out,"
said the other. "There's only one thing to remember, all the
time: keep your head up and play your cards close to your chest.
That's all!"</p>

<p>His nephew looked up to him with a quick cant of the head;
then he smiled. "I'll remember," he murmured.</p>

<p>Then he turned to regard the three riders, for Clay Winton
exclaimed:</p>

<p>'Why, there's a man-hunt on! That's old Sheriff Darrow, or I'm
mistaken. Yeah, that's Lew Darrow, and he looks as if he meant
business."</p>

<p>He frowned as he said this; but presently he shrugged his
shoulders. The boy was already in the saddle, as the sheriff came
up with two companions.</p>

<p>Everard knew all three men. One member of the sheriff's posse
was Jud Waley, who rode for Rudie Berner's father. The other man
was Ray Collins, a drifter who made headquarters in town and who
knew how to waste time as well as any man in the world.</p>

<p>Both were such fellows as any sheriff would be glad to have
along on a trail that promised danger; they rode well and they
were well known as good shots. Their courage had been tested in
that fine, white heat which the West, and the West alone, can
furnish to temper the souls of men.</p>

<p>"Hello, Clay," said the sheriff. "Hello, Ever. Ain't you far
from home? And what's that I seen of Timberline, ridin' off with
the Red Pacer? He says he bought the hoss. Know anything about
that?"</p>

<p>"He bought the Pacer, all right," said Everard, sadly.</p>

<p>"And what's this about you ridin' the hoss?" asked the
sheriff.</p>

<p>Ever shrugged his shoulders, with a joyless face.</p>

<p>"Timberline may tame him," said the sheriff, "but doggone me,
it'll take time for even him to ride that red devil. Clay, can I
have a word with you?"</p>

<p>"What about?" asked Clay Winton.</p>

<p>"Something private, old son."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Clay, and reined his horse to a little distance,
so that he was beside the sheriff.</p>

<p>Whatever the conversation was to be about, it did not take
Everard more than a glance to understand that it was serious
business. For Darrow's companions edged their horses after their
leader, and unmistakably, they were ready for anything to
happen.</p>

<p>The sheriff's voice came out louder, no doubt, than he had
intended it. Fast riding had made him breathe hard, and his words
were audible to Ever's strained ear as he said:</p>

<p>"Clay, I'm arrestin' you in the name of the law!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Lew?" asked Clay.</p>

<p>"I'm arrestin' you," said the sheriff. "Anything that you say
from now on might be used agin you in the court. Understand?"</p>

<p>"I understand that," said Clay Winton. With a wonderful calm,
he looked into the sheriff's face. "What's it all about?" he
asked.</p>

<p>He was almost cheerful. Many a time, Ever had admired his
uncle's perfect poise in tight pinches, but never had he admired
him as now.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't mind tellin' you, Clay," said the sheriff,
suddenly producing a gun, "only, I'm gonna have to ask for your
weapons first!"</p>

<p>Revolvers appeared in the hands of Collins and Waley, also.
Waley leveled his at the boy.</p>

<p>"Got a gat, Ever?" he asked.</p>

<p>"What's that to you?" demanded Everard.</p>

<p>"It's whatever I say," said Waley. "I'm a sworn-in
deputy."</p>

<p>He grinned faintly as he said this.</p>

<p>Clay was unbuckling his gun belt and passing it over to the
sheriff, who received it with his left hand.</p>

<p>"Give 'em your gat, Ever," he called back over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Give me your gat. Your uncle says you got one," insisted
Waley.</p>

<p>Ever raised his voice.</p>

<p>"Sheriff Darrow!" he called.</p>

<p>"Aye?" said the sheriff.</p>

<p>"Are you arresting me, too?"</p>

<p>"No," said the sheriff.</p>

<p>"I'll have that gun," remarked Waley, thrusting out his
chin.</p>

<p>"I'll see you in hell first!" said Everard, firmly.</p>

<p>His voice, his words, surprised even himself. He found himself
staring into Waley's face; he felt a contraction of the muscles
in his cheeks. Perhaps it was a smile. Yet he was angry. He was
angry, in a sense, as he never had been before.</p>

<p>"Why, you runt of a sawed-off brat!" shouted Waley, angrily.
"Gimme your gun!"</p>

<p>"Hey, Ever," called the sheriff, "you gotta give up your gun
when it's asked for. Ain't Waley told you he's a deputy?"</p>

<p>"Well" said Everard hesitantly.</p>

<p>Suddenly he slipped a leg over the back of the saddle and
dropped to the ground, putting his mustang suddenly between him
and the others. Waley found a gun muzzle staring at him.</p>

<p>"If you fellows want my gun, come and get it!" said Everard
Winton.</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch18" name="ch18"></a>XVIII.&mdash; SO-LONG</h2>

<p class="first">HEY, there!" exclaimed Jud Waley. "Round him up
on that side, will you? I'm gonna teach that high-blooded kid
something about what it means to give growed-up men his lip."</p>

<p>"I've got a dead bead on you, Jud," said Ever, calmly. "And I
can shoot straighter with a rest than you can free hand. Call
Collins back!"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Ray!" exclaimed Waley. "By the jumpin'
thunder, he means it! He means murder! There's murder in the
blood of these Wintons, is what there is!"</p>

<p>The sheriff cried, "What's all that nonsense back there?"</p>

<p>"The kid won't give up his cannon," said Waley. "I aim to make
him!"</p>

<p>"Have you got a warrant for me?" the boy demanded.</p>

<p>"Son, don't you go and make a fool of yourself," urged the
sheriff.</p>

<p>"Ever, give up the Colt!" exclaimed his uncle. "Are you trying
to get yourself into hot water on account of me?"</p>

<p>"I'm playing my own game," said the boy. "Waley, you turn that
gun another way. You hear me? Drop the muzzle of that gun!"</p>

<p>He did not raise his voice. He did not need to. And the thrill
of liquid ice ran through the blood of Jud Waley as he heard the
command and lowered his weapon, saying as he did so, I don't like
the look of this, Darrow. You ain't gonna let him get away with a
bluff like this, are you?"</p>

<p>"The Wintons don't bluff," said the sheriff, calmly. "Bluffs
don't run in their blood. I dunno just what to do, here. I can't
call it resistin' arrest, because I ain't arrestin' him. I ain't
got a warrant for him."</p>

<p>"Let him alone," said Clay Winton. "I can handle him, mostly;
but when I can't, nobody else can&mdash;and take that from me!
Leave him be, Darrow, unless you want hell to break loose."</p>

<p>"I don't," answered the sheriff, hastily. "I don't want to
push any lad to the wall till I have to. You know me, Clay. I
never fought in my life till I had to; I never fought without
bein' scared to death&mdash;scared to death of a jackrabbit,
even. But I got to make a livin' sheriffing, in spite of the
devil and my bad nerves."</p>

<p>It was a characteristic speech; it was characteristic of the
sheriff that he was able to laugh as he spoke.</p>

<p>"You haven't told me the charge, Lew," said Clay.</p>

<p>"It's the Green River business," said the sheriff.</p>

<p>"Green River business?" repeated Clay Winton.</p>

<p>The boy, listening, found the world swimming in black and red
before his eyes as he heard the name, but his uncle was perfectly
cool and collected.</p>

<p>"You know&mdash;the bank robbery," said the sheriff.</p>

<p>"Can't say I do," said Clay Winton.</p>

<p>"Can't you?" grinned Lew Darrow. "Well, maybe you'll be able
to remember it a lot better, later on. I ain't here to try the
case. I'm only gonna make the arrest and take you in."</p>

<p>"Green River&mdash;Green River?" repeated Clay, with the same
admirable poise. "Lemme see&mdash;well, I remember a yarn about
the robbing of a bank, there, seven or eight years back. Is that
what you're talking about?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't wanta arrest you for a job that you didn't
remember, Clay," said the sheriff, still grinning. "Yeah, it's
the Green River bank job. Only it was just four or five years
ago. That's all. Remember it any better, now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right," declared Winton. "You have to pinch
somebody, now and then, I know. I don't mind standing the rap,
only why the devil should you have started in my direction? What
would make you think I'd rob banks, Lew? You know that's not my
business."</p>

<p>"Sitting on your rear and taking it easy is your business,
Clay," answered the sheriff. "But you know how it is&mdash;a lot
of jurymen might be pretty curious to know how you made enough
money to retire on."</p>

<p>"Why, everybody knows that I made it out of mining," said Clay
Winton.</p>

<p>"And kept your hands soft all the while?" asked the
sheriff.</p>

<p>With that Ever saw his uncle straighten. He had heard that
expression before. Red lightning struck across the brain of the
boy, too. It was his mother who had developed the theory of the
soft hands. It must be she who had put the sheriff on Clay's
trail. Who else would be apt to remember that his uncle's hands
had been soft, four or five years before?</p>

<p>He looked hard at Clay Winton, and one burning glance flashed
back at him from his uncle's eye. Their mutual understanding was
perfect; and the boy, out of the depths of his wretchedness, felt
that he could fathom all the workings of his mother's mind. To
strike his uncle from his side, to win her son back to his home
because of her own sheer loneliness&mdash;those had been her
motives, perhaps?</p>

<p>Bitterness and savage grief consumed him. All that had gone
before was as nothing now; and in one stroke he grew mature. His
father could not have had a hand in this thing&mdash;against his
own brother. Such a thing could be in the nature of no Winton,
not even Ned Winton. But his mother</p>

<p>He heard Clay Winton saying:</p>

<p>"That's all right, Lew. You're doing your job, and I don't
hold it agin you. Are we starting along?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, we're startin' along."</p>

<p>"We're startin', Ever," repeated the uncle.</p>

<p>"I'm not riding the same trail, then," said Ever.</p>

<p>"Where you bound to, brother?" asked Lew Darrow.</p>

<p>"Over the hills and far away," said Ever, evasively.</p>

<p>"Good luck to you, then!" said Lew Darrow. "But ain't you got
a home waitin' for you?"</p>

<p>"Not now," said Ever.</p>

<p>His teeth clicked as he made the answer.</p>

<p>"No? Not now?" repeated the sheriff.</p>

<p>"I've got a horse and a saddle and a gun. That's home
enough&mdash;and furniture, too."</p>

<p>He smiled at the sheriff and the sheriff frowned in
return.</p>

<p>I won't be paying rent for the roof over my head, either,"
remarked Everard.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you're cuttin' loose on your own," remarked the
sheriff. "I'm mighty sorry. So-long, Ever. Good luck to you
agin!"</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Ever.</p>

<p>He walked out from behind his horse and wrung his uncle's
hand.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Uncle Clay," said he. "I'm not seeing the last of
you."</p>

<p>His uncle lowered his voice, but he could not lower it enough
to keep it from the ears of the others. They followed too
closely.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Ever," he said to his nephew. "If you do what I
want you to, you'll go back home and stay there&mdash;make your
mother happy and your father happy. They're people as good as
you'll find anywhere. Maybe you have little differences with 'em
about some things, but in the long run they'd die for you, and
you oughta be ready to die for them. Understand me?"</p>

<p>"I'm trying to understand," said Ever.</p>

<p>"And no matter what you do, remember one thing."</p>

<p>"I'll try to remember," said Ever. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about me. Nothing is gonna come out of this
arrest. The sheriff, here, is doin' the best he knows how, but
I'm not worryin' about anything."</p>

<p>"Innocent men always win out&mdash;unless they're framed,"
suggested Ever.</p>

<p>"Of course they do, Ever. And that's what I bet on, d'you
see?"</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"So long, Ever," called Ray Collins, and the group moved
off.</p>

<p>"So long, Ray," he answered.</p>

<p>"So long, Ever," echoed Jud Waley, cheerfully, in his
turn.</p>

<p>But Ever made no answer this time.</p>

<p>Jud Waley turned, suddenly, and stared back at him.</p>

<p>"Wait here a while, Waley," said Ever, "and I'll say something
to you besides good-bye."</p>

<p>Waley, with an oath, swung his horse around.</p>

<p>"Here, you! Jud!" shouted the sheriff.</p>

<p>"He can't give me none of his back talk!" said Waley.</p>

<p>"Leave him be," ordered the sheriff.</p>

<p>"I got a mind to stay right here and dress him down," remarked
Waley.</p>

<p>"You come along," said the sheriff. "You're workin' for the
law now, and not for yourself."</p>

<p>"Oh, damn the law! That kid can't give me no lip," decided
Waley.</p>

<p>"Can't I?" said Ever, walking forward with the same smile that
had been on his face before. I can, though. I'm giving you lip
now. I'm telling you that you're a yellow rat. You hear me,
Waley?"</p>

<p>"Damn you!" shouted Waley, in a fury.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" cried the sheriff. "Ever, what're you up to, you
young fool?"</p>

<p>"I'm trying to work up a chance to defend myself," said
Everard, "but there doesn't seem to be much hope. You don't pick
the right kind of men, sheriff. Coyotes is all you go in
for&mdash;just coyotes, like Waley."</p>

<p>He expected an answer to that, but to his surprise, and then
to his sudden horror, he saw fear freeze Waley's face.</p>

<p>The deputy suddenly turned his horse, muttering, and rode on
after his companions.</p>

<p>Ever swung about. He saw that Harry Lawson was leaning against
the corner of the shack, with the same red-eyed wolfish grin upon
his battered face.</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch19" name="ch19"></a>XIX. ONE SOLUTION</h2>

<p class="first">AN overwhelming impatience forced Ever to
exclaim, "Lawson, what's the matter? What are you grinning
about?"</p>

<p>The half-breed looked him up and down, shrugged one shoulder,
and disappeared through the dimness of the doorway. Winton stood
for a moment gripping the reins of the gray mare, stunned by the
sudden realization of his predicament as if by a great flare of
light.</p>

<p>His duty was toward his uncle, he felt, but what he could do
to help Clay Winton was a puzzle to him. Perhaps when he defied
Waley it had been merely a futile gesture to prove to Clay Winton
that he was willing to fight. But how could he fight? Not only
was Clay Winton disarmed and helpless; he was now in the hands of
three practiced gunmen.</p>

<p>What remained to attempt? Ever turned toward the shack and
called out:</p>

<p>"Lawson! Oh, Lawson?"</p>

<p>The half-breed came to the door of the shack. His felt hat was
pushed to one side of his head, giving him a half rakish
appearance; he had a short-stemmed pipe gripped between his
broken, yellow teeth.</p>

<p>"Yeah?" he queried.</p>

<p>"You hear what they arrested my uncle for?"</p>

<p>The Indian nodded.</p>

<p>"What would the sentence for a bank robbery like that be?"
asked the boy.</p>

<p>Harry Lawson held up ten fingers, closed his hands, raised
five more.</p>

<p>"Fifteen years?" exclaimed Winton, in horror.</p>

<p>Lawson nodded and turned again, in his curt way, into the
interior shadows of the place. He could be heard rattling at the
stove.</p>

<p>Fifteen years! That length of time would be quite sufficient
to thin and whiten Clay's hair, bow his shoulders and bend his
head. He would be fifty years old or more when he came out; and
inevitably the prison mark would be upon him forever. That must
not be.</p>

<p>Ever could see only one possible solution. It was a very vague
and distant one, to be sure, but it made him spring onto the
mustang. Without a word of farewell to Harry Lawson, he spurred
toward the gap among the hills.</p>

<p>He was at a considerable distance when he turned in the
saddle. Looking back, he saw that the half-breed was standing in
the sun at a little distance from the house, swinging one arm to
beckon him back.</p>

<p>He checked the mare to a trot. But on second thought he
decided that there was nothing Lawson could say that would be of
help. So he put the mare to a canter again, and loped on through
the rolling lands on the trail of Timberline.</p>

<p>Two hot and dusty hours Ever put behind him before he overtook
his quarry. The mare was red with dust, save where sweat
blackened her. Then he saw the three riders. Garry was mounted on
the Red Pacer; the other two were leading the great horse on long
ropes. The stallion submitted to that leading, though his ears
were flattened. He was awaiting his chance.</p>

<p>As Ever came up, the group halted. He rode straight up to
Timberline.</p>

<p>"Changed your mind?" asked Timberline, with his usual
terseness.</p>

<p>Ever pointed into the distance behind him.</p>

<p>"Lew Darrow and a couple more," he said, "picked up my uncle
and packed him off to jail. If you'll help him out, I'll be your
man, Timberline."</p>

<p>Timberline grinned. "They'll have your uncle in jail before we
could reach him," said he.</p>

<p>"Yes, they will," said Ever, and waited.</p>

<p>Timberline lifted his head higher.</p>

<p>"You want me to break him out of jail, eh?" he asked.</p>

<p>Winton nodded.</p>

<p>"And that buys you?" asked Timberline. "That and the Pacer
buys you, eh?"</p>

<p>"It does," said Everard Winton, solemnly.</p>

<p>"What's he in for?" asked Timberline.</p>

<p>"Bank robbery."</p>

<p>"What job?"</p>

<p>"The Green River Bank&mdash;five years ago."</p>

<p>Timberline whistled. So did Garry.</p>

<p>"That was a beauty!" said Garry, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Well, if he's got the loot," remarked Al, "he can buy himself
out."</p>

<p>"Did he really rob that bank?" asked Timberline.</p>

<p>"That's not my business," said Ever. "My job's to help him out
of jail."</p>

<p>"Not admitting anything, eh?" said Timberline.</p>

<p>He looked at Ever again and nodded, as though confirming his
previous estimate of the boy. Then he added:</p>

<p>"When they pick up a fellow for a big job like that they watch
him, you know. They watch him the way a cat watches a mouse."</p>

<p>"I suppose they do," said Ever.</p>

<p>"What does he mean to you aside from blood?"</p>

<p>"We've been pretty close," answered Everard.</p>

<p>"If it came to shooting, would you join in gunplay for
him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How are you with a gun?"</p>

<p>"I'm good with a gun."</p>

<p>"He teach you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He's a cool one," agreed Timberline. "He seems to know what
he's about. But this is a pretty big job that you're asking out
of me, Winton."</p>

<p>I know it is."</p>

<p>"How do I know that I'll get back from you as much as I put
out?"</p>

<p>"You take a chance on that."</p>

<p>Timberline shook his head. "You ride with me, you're useful a
couple of times, and then you slide out from under. I've had that
happen before. Besides, you don't mix with my other men. You
started trouble with Al in the beginning."</p>

<p>"He talked down to me," said Ever. "That's all. He'll admit
that."</p>

<p>"I'll admit nothin'," answered Al. "I'll take and break"</p>

<p>"Aw, shut up, Al!" said Garry, his companion.</p>

<p>Al was silent, glaring.</p>

<p>"Make your case," urged Timberline to Ever.</p>

<p>And Everard answered, "Making trouble is your business. I can
help you make it. I can ride, I can shoot, and I'm not a
quitter."</p>

<p>"How do you know you're not?" asked Timberline, sharply.</p>

<p>"Because I've taken my beatings," said Everard.</p>

<p>"Well," murmured Timberline, "you're too young. I'd be a fool
to take such a chance for you. A long chance! How long would you
stick by me if I managed to do this job for you?"</p>

<p>"Until you said that you had enough of me."</p>

<p>The eye of Timberline glinted.</p>

<p>"It's a long chance&mdash;a fool's chance," he muttered, still
eying the prospective recruit.</p>

<p>Then he snapped his fingers.</p>

<p>"Garry!" he called.</p>

<p>"Yeah?" drawled Garry.</p>

<p>"Climb down off that horse and let the kid take the Pacer. He
seems to need that horse, and the horse seems to need him. We're
going to try to crack open the jail and get Clay Winton out for
him&mdash;and after that, we'll see what lies in the cards."</p>
<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch20" name="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; THE ROBBER
HIMSELF</h2>

<p class="first">IT was several nights later that a voice,
quietly calling, brought Mrs. Winton with a gasp and a cry from
her kitchen and out onto the back porch. The screen door slammed
behind her with a loud and jingling crash, and she saw the
glimmering form of a lofty horse in the starlight. A man was
standing at its head.</p>

<p>"Ever? Ever?" she stammered.</p>

<p>He came to her to the end of the reins that were hooked over
his arm.</p>

<p>"Steady, mother," he said. "Don't make a fast move or this
horse will be off like a hawk. It's the Pacer."</p>

<p>She caught Everard in her arms and drew him to her with all
her might. She tried to speak. She could only weep with a stifled
sobbing against his breast.</p>

<p>With his hand he caressed her.</p>

<p>"Is father likely to have heard?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He ain't here, Ever," she answered. "He's down talkin' to the
lawyer. It ain't much time that he spends in the house, now,
since&mdash;since&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off, then added, "He'll spend his money and his soul
to get Clay free. He thinks that it was me that set the sheriff
on Clay. Your father sort of hates me now, Ever. He hates
me&mdash;you're gone from me&mdash;and I dunno why I keep on
living."</p>

<p>"Did you talk to the sheriff?" he asked.</p>

<p>"If you thought that I had, you'd despise the ground that I
walked on, like your father despises it now," said she.</p>

<p>"Mother," he said, "I know that you talked to Lew Darrow. But
in spite of that I've come to see you&mdash;to tell you that no
matter what you do, you're as close to me as my blood."</p>

<p>"Are you meaning it, Ever?" she asked, suddenly lifting her
head and a cold sense of awe came over her.</p>

<p>"I mean it with my whole heart," said he. "The other night I
sneaked away. I'm sorry for that. I've had a chance to think it
over, since then, and I know that no matter what you've done, you
weren't thinking of yourself&mdash;you were thinking of the rest
of the family."</p>

<p>"I was, Ever," she told him. "And God bless you for
understanding!"</p>

<p>"If you had it to do over again," said he, "you'd act
differently, I imagine."</p>

<p>"Differently? I'd crawl on my hands and knees to the sea and
back, if that would set Clay free!" she cried. "But now you're
here, ain't you come to stay? Ain't you here for good, Ever?"</p>

<p>She caught the lapels of his coat and held him, straining up
on tiptoes the better to study his face through the darkness. To
him she seemed thinner and older. He was now a man, and she was
suddenly afraid.</p>

<p>"I'm tied up with other things," he answered her, carefully.
"The moment I can come, I'll be here. You can be sure of that.
But I have some other things to do in the meantime. You can
remember the rest though. The moment that I'm free, I'll come
back, and as nearly as I can, I'll try to be what you and father
want me to be."</p>

<p>"We've changed!" she protested, quickly. "Ah, we've changed a
lot, Ever. We were pretty hard and sure, before; but that's all
changed. What we want is you. That's all we want. We ain't young
any more, and it's an empty house and an empty life, without no
child in it. We want you back, and then you can do what you
please. You can go where you please; you can be what you
please.</p>

<p>"If it's more schoolin' you want, you can have it. If it's
life far away from us you can have that&mdash;if only you'll be
with us a part of the year. But there's been dreadful times for
me, Ever, settin' at the table and seein' your father as cold and
hard and silent as a stone. He'll never forgive me for what I've
done. He'll never forgive me!"</p>

<p>She began to weep again.</p>

<p>"If he doesn't," said Everard Winton, "he's wrong, and you
tell him that I say he's wrong. He may understand. He and you and
I, no matter where we are, are all tied together. Blood holds us,
mother&mdash;and God forgive the first of us to forget it!"</p>

<p>"What you're sayin' breaks my heart, Ever," she told him,
"because it makes me think of Clay, down there in the jail."</p>

<p>"Have you seen him?" asked Ever.</p>

<p>"I went and seen him. He&mdash;he forgave me as free and kind
and gentle and simple as anything you ever heard. I've been a bad
woman, Ever. I never knew how bad till I took and looked into
your uncle's face and seen his blue Winton eyes, with no meanness
in 'em."</p>

<p>"It's the best thing he's ever done," Ever said, "and he's
done good things before this. Mother, I've got to go."</p>

<p>"Not yet, Ever!" she moaned, clinging to him harder than
ever.</p>

<p>"Some one's waiting for me," said he. "I'm going away for a
long time, perhaps. You may not hear from me. And what you do
hear may not sound the best. But I want you to think, in spite of
anything, that I'm trying my best to do what's right."</p>

<p>"Whatever you try you'll do," she said.</p>

<p>"May I go now, mother?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I made a vow," she answered, "while you were away. I made a
vow that I'd never say no to you in the rest of my days. If you
have to go, it's all right, Ever. Somehow, I feel that there were
mountains raised up between us, black as night and high as the
stars, and that now they're down&mdash;good-bye, Ever. We'll
never have the mountains between us again. And with them out of
the way, what difference does distance make?"</p>

<p>He took her in his arms and kissed her; then he swung into the
saddle. She saw the sheen of the horse slide away through the
darkness, tilt up over the fence and disappear.</p>

<p>It was not long afterward that he stood with Timberline, under
the shaggy darkness of the pine trees that filled all the rest of
the village block that had been reserved for the jail and the
other county buildings. Of those structures, only the jail had
been erected; it was the only building for which there was a
pressing need!</p>

<p>"Al and Garry will stay back there with the horses,"
Timberline was explaining. "You and I do the inside work. Is that
right?"</p>

<p>"That's right," said Ever. "Whatever you say is
right&mdash;for me."</p>

<p>"Good!" said the other. "As soon as the bright light goes out
inside the cell room, we start."</p>

<p>"What's the news in the town today?" asked Ever.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you find out?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't show my face."</p>

<p>"They've got a case against your uncle. They turned up the
cashier of that Green River Bank, and after those five years he
still remembered your uncle."</p>

<p>"Was he sure?"</p>

<p>"Pretty sure&mdash;at first. And then he asked to have Clay's
mustaches shaved. They did that, and after the mustaches were
gone he took his oath that Clay Winton was the robber, all
right!"</p>

<p>Ever sighed.</p>

<p>"That makes it pretty final, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"It's so final that it's finished," said Timberline. "Didn't
you even see the newspapers?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"The newspapers have him as good as in stripes, already.
That's the way with newspapers. They tell the juries what to
think even before the juries are picked out and put
together."</p>

<p>"There's nothing left, then, but breaking the jail," said
Ever.</p>

<p>"Nothing left," agreed Timberline.</p>

<p>He was extraordinarily cheerful about it. He went on:</p>

<p>"The folks in this place seem to have a good deal of sympathy
for Clay Winton. They say that anybody who can keep his face shut
and live quietly for five years, after a job like that, deserves
to go free, almost. And I agree with 'em."</p>

<p>"There's the light!" exclaimed Ever.</p>

<p>The stronger illumination that shone through the one window on
that side of the jail had now gone out; in its place was what at
first seemed to be solid darkness; but afterward it turned into a
faint glimmering.</p>

<p>"We start now," said Timberline.</p>

<p>He stepped forward as he spoke, and Ever accompanied him
closely.</p>

<p>Ever was wonderfully aware of every nerve in his anatomy. It
was as though a search light was playing upon him, with the
danger of bullets striking through the light. He remembered one
other thing; the Colt revolver which he had received from his
uncle. It had the sights filed away, so that they might not
interfere with a fast draw; the trigger was gone; the spring was
set so the weapon could be fanned. If the pinch came, he wondered
if he could use it at a human target.</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch21" name="ch21"></a>XXI. &mdash; BREAKING
IN&mdash;AND OUT</h2>

<p class="first">BENEATH the barred window of the jail Timberline
stopped.</p>

<p>"A tree's no stronger than its roots, Winton," said he. "I'll
take a pry at the bars up there and see what happens."</p>

<p>He was up to the ledge at once, active as a cat, and working
the end of a small crowbar into place beneath one of the rods. A
little shower of loosened mortar and cement fell down. Ever heard
a small grating sound.</p>

<p>Something was held down to him; he took it, and found it to be
one of the curved window bars.</p>

<p>Timberline leaned above him.</p>

<p>"Could almost do it with my bare hands," the man murmured.
"This is going to be a joke, Winton!"</p>

<p>A joke to get through the window, perhaps&mdash;but what about
the inside of the jail?</p>

<p>Bar after bar was handed down to Ever. He laid them cautiously
to the side so that they would not jangle one against the other;
would not present another and even greater danger if it proved
necessary to return through that same window and leap down in
haste.</p>

<p>Then Timberline slid feet first through the naked gap of the
window.</p>

<p>Every muscle, every nerve of Everard Winton grew as hard as
ice, brittle with extreme cold. But in another moment he was at
the same opening. Shame gave him warmth. It was for his own flesh
and blood that this thing was being ventured, and yet Timberline
had laid out the plan of attack and was working alone!</p>

<p>At the window, Everard looked through into an obscure interior
that was lighted from one dim source that he could not see, as
yet. He put his head inside and saw Timberline standing back
against the wall, just beside the window. It was a good eight
foot drop, from the sill of the window to the floor inside. A
hard business, too, to climb up that smooth inner wall and out,
once a man was inside.</p>

<p>However, Timberline had already committed himself. Ever went
through as the other had done, feet first, and dropped to the
floor. Then he stepped to the side of his companion.</p>

<p>"A hard job to get back through that window&mdash;for the one
who's last," whispered Winton. "How can we do it?"</p>

<p>"Well know how to do it when we have to," said the other. "One
thing at a time. But let's try to spot that cell where your uncle
is stored away."</p>

<p>They had no chance to begin their search at once. A brighter
light moved toward them, and voices. Timberline glided instantly
through the open door of a cell. Ever followed.</p>

<p>"Damned bad luck!" murmured Timberline.</p>

<p>He slid to the floor and lay flat upon it, face downward, his
head pillowed on one arm. In his free band gleamed a bit of
steel. It might be time for shooting, before ten seconds had
passed. Ever implicitly followed his companion's lead.</p>

<p>Lying there in darkness broken only by that vague shimmer of
light overhead, he regretted intensely that they were shut within
the narrow limits of the cell. A push against the door would snap
the latch and make them prisoners.</p>

<p>A mad idea came into his head that his companion was betraying
him into captivity&mdash;that it was an arrangement between
Timberline and the sheriff to catch up another of the Winton
clan.</p>

<p>The idea grew like a fire in him; he was on the verge of
leaping to his feet as he heard the sound of voices,
approaching.</p>

<p>Then, "Close up those doors, Pete," said one, with an air of
authority.</p>

<p>It was the sheriff's voice, like a confirmation of Ever's
suspicion. He drew in his breath hard, gathered himself to
leap&mdash;and found the door flung shut with a loud clanging
before his face.</p>

<p>It was all he could do to keep himself from springing up and
shouting at the top of his lungs. He controlled himself; a
shudder shook him from head to foot. Other doors were slammed in
rapid succession, steel clanging against steel.</p>

<p>"That's the luck of the devil!" murmured Timberline, with a
wonderful calm. "Now they'll find the bars off the window, and
they'll trap us like rats. Rotten luck&mdash;rotten luck. We
can't play this off as a practical joke, either!"</p>

<p>They heard the sheriff saying, "Now, Jerry, keep a brain in
your head, will you?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Jerry. "We always been leavin' the doors of the
empties open, till just lately. I forgot about' em, tonight."</p>

<p>"It ain't a time to do any forgetting," said the sheriff. "You
be on your toes, Jerry."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Jerry. "Sure, I'll be on my toes."</p>

<p>"How's that fellow Richards?" asked the sheriff.</p>

<p>"He'll be all right. He's just got a hangover and the shakes.
But he's all right."</p>

<p>"The poor devil's an old-timer," said the sheriff. "I reckon
he's got a long record behind him."</p>

<p>"Gonna lock him up?" answered the guard.</p>

<p>"Nope, not me," answered Lew Darrow. "He's only a poor bum
now, no matter what he used to be. I'm going to let him go, when
he's sobered up. I'll throw a scare into him&mdash;and turn him
loose. I'm sorry for the old-timers, Jerry. The heart's been cut
out of most of 'em."</p>

<p>"Aye!" said Jerry. "The heart's been cut out of most of 'em.
Richards, he just lies and shakes whenever anybody comes near
him."</p>

<p>"He's like a dog that's been kicked too often," said the
sheriff. "There ain't many that can stand a few stretches without
losin' their nerve."</p>

<p>"Him in number nineteen ain't gonna lose his nerve," suggested
Jerry.</p>

<p>"No," agreed the sheriff. "He won't lose his nerve. But look
what he is&mdash;look at the blood that's in him. No, he ain't
gonna lose his nerve. How's he been this evening?"</p>

<p>"Aw, he's all right. He never asks for anything. Never
complains. Most of the poor soggy bums we get are always
yammerin' about the chuck. The food ain't good enough for 'em.But
it don't bother Winton. He takes everything, all right. He's a
man."</p>

<p>"He's a man," said the sheriff.</p>

<p>"They got it pinned on him now, I guess," said the jailer.</p>

<p>"They got it nailed into his heart," answered the sheriff.</p>

<p>"What'll he get?,"</p>

<p>"Anything. You can't tell. Likely something big. Enough to
spoil his life for him." He added, "Now, you keep your eyes open.
Make a round every half-hour, or so."</p>

<p>"Look here," said Jerry. "You think that they're gonna try to
cut Winton loose from the jail?"</p>

<p>"He's got a kid nephew," declared the sheriff, "that looked
like business, to me. If he sets down on his haunches and don't
try his hand to get his uncle loose, I'm a fool and don't know a
man when I see him. No, that boy's gonna try something, and no
mistake. That's the way I read his hand."</p>

<p>They receded, their voices growing dimmer, and Timberline
nudged his companion.</p>

<p>"They got an idea about you, Winton," said he. "But it's a
good thing to have a reputation with the county sheriff."</p>

<p>He even chuckled a little as he said this.</p>

<p>Then he rose to his feet and went to the door; and reaching
his supple hands through the bars, he began to fumble at the lock
from the outside. Winton heard light scratching sounds. He held
his breath.</p>

<p>Presently Timberline straightened and stepped back from his
examination.</p>

<p>"Can you do it? Can you pick the lock?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Shut up," advised Timberline, savagely, but in a whisper.
"It's working backward, damn it&mdash;it's working backward that
kills the business!"</p>

<p>He cursed in the same whisper, and set to his task again.</p>

<p>Hours went by.</p>

<p>Ever thought himself caught like a rat, dragged into court,
charged, condemned, and sent to the penitentiary. He felt the
cold steel belly of the barber's clippers run over his scalp. He
looked down and saw his limbs clad in stripes. He served weary
years in prison. He came out bowed, bent and gray before his
time. He was a marked man. Old companions despised him. His
father's ranch had passed into other hands. Father and mother
both were dead. He had only their stilted, scrawled letters to
remind him of them.</p>

<p>This life flowed through the mind of Everard Winton in that
slow passage of the time. It was no more than a dream, say, but
it was a dream that seemed real.</p>

<p>And then there was a light click; a soft, sliding sound. The
door had opened under Timberline's hand and his picklock!</p>

<p>Winton leaped to him.</p>

<p>"Steady me!" gasped Timberline.</p>

<p>Winton gripped him by the shoulders and found that he was
shaking and shuddering from head to foot. His head fell weakly
over on one shoulder. He drew in his breath.</p>

<p>"I couldn't have stood it for another ten minutes," muttered
Timberline. I tried to read the mind of that damned lock until I
thought that there was no mind in it!"</p>

<p>Rapidly, he grew better. He pulled out a handkerchief and
wiped his face.</p>

<p>"My God, I need a drink!" he whispered to himself, not to
Ever.</p>

<p>"We'll get out of here and come back to-morrow night," said
Winton.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't come back into this hellhole again for ten
thousand uncles of yours&mdash;and be damned to 'em!" muttered
Timberline. "We'll do our job now or we'll never do it."</p>

<p>"It's all you, Timberline," said Ever in a burst of admiration
and of gratitude. "I'm nothing&mdash;I'm only in the way."</p>

<p>"Let me tell you," whispered the other. "Back there in the
cell, except for you, I'd have lost my mind. Come on. We'll find
Number Nineteen.That's his cell number, I guess."</p>

<p>They went on down the corridor, beneath the window, where the
missing bars had evidently not been detected by either the
sheriff or the guard. They turned the corner and saw before them
the light which illuminated the interior; a lantern was bracketed
against the wall, lighting irregularly both short corridors of
the jail. They saw the glimmering steel faces of the cell doors.
It was a good jail; it was worthy of the pride which the town had
invested in it&mdash;the pride and the hard cash.</p>

<p>Just to the left of the first corner they found the number
they wanted. Ever stepped to the door and whispered:</p>

<p>"Uncle Clay!"</p>

<p>Something stirred inside the cell. Then, almost in Ever's
face, came the answering whisper:</p>

<p>"Ever, you young fool! Get out of this place! Do you want to
go to prison along with me? Get out of here&mdash;and get
fast!"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" warned Timberline. "Stop talking and let me
work."</p>

<p>He dropped to his knees.</p>

<p>Would it take longer than the first door? If so, the dawn
would be on them&mdash;the broad daylight! Already it seemed to
Ever that when he stepped back and looked down the first corridor
toward the unbarred window, he could see the sheen of gray dawn
beginning.No, that was only his imagination, now drawn to the
breaking point.</p>

<p>He stepped back and leaned over the form that kneeled on the
floor.</p>

<p>"Easy&mdash;easy&mdash;so easy!" he heard Timberline whisper,
and the intent worker looked up, his face shining with
sweat&mdash;and with silent, triumphant laughter.</p>

<p>Then the bolt gave, with an audible click, and the door opened
under his hand.</p>

<p>Inside, Ever saw his uncle's shadowy outline standing ready.
At the same time, from the front corner of the room, another door
opened and Jerry's voice said: "Scrub up the floors and then come
back here and I'll give you a shot of coffee.Then"</p>

<p>His voice broke off in the midst of this command; then it rose
again in a high-pitched, almost feminine scream:</p>

<p>"Help! Help! Help!"</p>

<p>The three cries burned through Everard Winton's brain. They
froze him in his place so that he could not move.</p>

<p>Already, his uncle and Timberline had turned the corner,
running at full speed, bent far forward. He had even time to note
that each of them carried a gun. Timberline had armed the
prisoner.</p>

<p>But he himself could not stir.</p>

<p>"Shoot, Bud, shoot!" cried Jerry.</p>

<p>And he opened fire himself.</p>

<p>In his hand, Ever found his revolver. It had come
automatically to his fingers; automatically, too, it was levelled
at the two jailers. And yet he could not fire. It was as though
his thumb was struggling to lift the weight of a ton!</p> <hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch22" name="ch22"></a>XXII. &mdash; GETAWAY</h2>

<p class="first">ALL of his senses were so speeded up, at this
moment, that it was as though the motions of the two jail guards
were frozen forever in snapshots, presented in a slow, gradual
series to his mind. He could see the guns drawn, and then raised.
He could see the bending of the bodies, as the jailers took aim.
Still he could not fire!</p>

<p>Swift bullets brushed the air about his face; leaving penciled
strokes of red danger, as it were, across his mind. And suddenly
he was able to use his own gun.</p>

<p>How many seconds had elapsed since the two guards entered the
cell chamber?Four or five, perhaps; but they were strung out like
a whole day in his mind. Everything about his nerves and his wits
and his senses had been raised to a hysterical degree of speed.
Motion that seemed slow to him, at that moment, would have been
lightning fast to almost any other man. But he could always take
the swiftest and most fluid movements apart and remember
them.</p>

<p>His eye became a slow-motion picture camera. He could tell,
for instance, how Jerry's gun had stuck a little as it was being
drawn from its holster. He could see the blond fellow stumble, as
he jerked out his Colt&mdash;stumble and stagger a bit to the
side, with the violence of the gesture.</p>

<p>To Ever, the few swift seconds were a large and thoroughly
mapped country.</p>

<p>Other men were awake in the cells now, and were raising a
clamor which rang from one thin steel wall to another and made
the whole place reverberate like a boiler factory. Some of the
prisoners were howling simply from excitement or with fear.
Others were aimlessly beating at their walls or at their
doors.</p>

<p>In the midst of this turmoil, Ever was able to fire for the
first time. He took deliberate aim&mdash;perhaps the hundredth
part of a second&mdash;to tell himself that he would select
Jerry, instead of the other target.</p>

<p>He took another fraction of an instant to decide that he would
fire low. He had no doubt about striking his target. He was not
even excited about that. He had flicked a squirrel out of the
lofty branch of a tree more than once, with a quick revolver
shot.</p>

<p>He was perfectly cool. There was nothing strange to him about
this situation; it was as if he had been through it a thousand
times before.</p>

<p>So he fired.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that as Jerry howled out and dropped his gun
and fell forward on his face, grasping at his injured leg with
both hands&mdash;it seemed to him then that he had seen Jerry
fall like this before.</p>

<p>The fat fellow, when he saw this catastrophe, turned with a
shriek of fear and fled for his life.</p>

<p>Ever walked around the corner of the block of cells and stood
below the unbarred window.</p>

<p>Timberline's face looked back inside, and Timberline
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Jump for my hands!You've been taking all night. What's the
matter with you?"</p>

<p>Ever looked up and measured the jump. There was a fan-shaped
cornice, a foot above the top of the windows, made by letting the
stones of the arch project a little beyond the surface of the
wall.</p>

<p>"Back up, Timberline," he said, "and I'll manage it, all
right."</p>

<p>"You are a fool!" exclaimed Timberline. "Well, have it on your
own head. I tried to help you!"</p>

<p>The head was withdrawn.</p>

<p>Ever backed up a step, then bounded high, caught the sill of
the window, swept himself up from this by a strong arm-haul,
gripped the narrowly projecting rise above the top of the window,
curled up his legs, and shoved them through the window hole. An
instant later he had dropped through to the safety of the outer
night.</p>

<p>It was the deadest hour, that which precedes the dawn, but
already men were awakening about the town. From the houses he
could hear excited voices. Doors and windows began to slam open.
Such a town as this would rouse quickly, and when it aroused, it
was capable of terrible action. Not a man in the village would be
unfamiliar with guns.</p>

<p>He was thoroughly possessed by an odd sense of joy. It had
been rising in him from the moment when Jerry and the second
guard entered the cell room. He could not name the feeling. It
was not like the effect of liquor; it was something more. It was
a direct, unearthly intoxication of the brain.</p>

<p>Timberline grasped him by the arm.</p>

<p>"Why the devil are you standing here? Start!" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right," said Ever.</p>

<p>They were fleeing before him to show him the way, his uncle
and Timberline, and he followed them.</p>

<p>Gunshots barked behind them; voices began to bawl across the
open night. One man was screeching:</p>

<p>"They're gone!The jail's been cracked. Winton's gone!Turn out,
everybody! Hosses! Hosses!"</p>

<p>Well, they would have horsemen out, of course; and all those
horsemen would ride like mad. But Ever would be on the Red
Pacer's back!</p>

<p>Had he been recognized?</p>

<p>He could remember, now, that Timberline had cautioned him to
pull the brim of his hat down over his face. He had pointed out
that a man who wore his hat in this fashion, at night, was as
secure from recognition as though he had a black mask strapped
across his eyes.</p>

<p>But Ever had not followed that injunction. He had worn his hat
normally. Perhaps the brim had even blown a little upward from
his face, as he ran down the corridor. And it well might be that
Jerry had seen him clearly. But he could not worry about that
now&mdash;he could not worry about anything. It was with Ever as
with the young wolf that for the first time runs with the pack
and strikes down the kill.</p>

<p>They pressed through trees, struck across the street, and
turned sharply down an alley.</p>

<p>They came to the rear of the town. The center of it was a
volcano of sound; and here and there were sudden volleys, as
though excited townsmen were firing at every shadow.</p>

<p>A little shack stood at the edge of the town, and as the three
shot past, the door opened and a broad beam of yellow lamplight
swept out to clutch the Pacer like a great, pale hand.
Instinctively, Ever ducked his head. But what good was that? Even
if he had not been recognized, the Red Pacer had been seen and
was not likely to be mistaken. By the Pacer's own light, he
seemed to shine out among other horses.</p>

<p>Ever jerked about in the saddle, a revolver in his hand, and
saw the tall figure of a man standing in the doorway, staring
after him.</p>

<p>Well, chance would have to handle that danger as it might. He
put up the gun and rode on. For he felt withdrawn from the rest
of the world, raised above the common level of its people.</p>

<p>They came to the popular thicket where Al and Garry were
waiting with their horses.</p>

<p>Al, his face drawn as if with pain&mdash;perhaps it was the
strain of waiting and the excitement&mdash;leaped into his
saddle. Garry followed suit.</p>

<p>The others were already bolting away. Only his uncle remained
behind, waiting. Clay's restless horse&mdash;the same gray mare
mustang that Harry Lawson had given to Ever&mdash;was turning in
uneasy circles, anxious to be away with the rest.</p>

<p>"Come on, Ever!" Clay Winton shouted.</p>

<p>He turned the mare and gave her her head, so that she bolted
after the others. But the red stallion, without even breaking the
flowing current of his pacing, held his own and overtook her,
going past with a lordly stride!</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch23" name="ch23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; A CHAMPION</h2>

<p class="first">ON the shoulder of Banner Mountain a fire
burned, of wood so carefully selected that hardly a wisp of smoke
rose in the air of the late afternoon or blew away down the wind.
It was hardly more than a wisp of that mist which the warmth of
the sun was drawing up from the earth, and it was as readily
dissipated in the wind. Under the embers potatoes were roasting
slowly, coming to mealy perfection. Beside the first sat
Timberline and Clay Winton.</p>

<p>The latter stood up, walked to the edge of the mountain
shoulder and looked down upon a small natural meadow which he
could see through a clearing in the woods. There was the great
red stallion striding, with Clay's nephew in the saddle.</p>

<p>"He's still at it," said Winton. "Still workin' the
Pacer&mdash;still teachin' him tricks."</p>

<p>"The Pacer comes to his whistle now," observed Timberline.</p>

<p>"Not to any other whistle, though," remarked Winton.</p>

<p>Unconsciously he raised his hand toward the place where those
long, drooping, yellow mustaches had once been. The law had
removed them, in the course of its investigations. Clay frowned
when he found that there was nothing for his hand to stroke. He
felt that his face was naked, after having found security for so
long.</p>

<p>"That horse won't come to any other man," agreed Timberline.
"He never will, now. Ever's spoiled him for good."</p>

<p>"Or made him," differed Winton.</p>

<p>"Put it any way you want," said Timberline. "He won't last
long to ride the Pacer, anyway."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"No," said Timberline, "he won't."</p>

<p>"You mean hell get tangled up so deep that the law'll go after
his scalp?"</p>

<p>Clay frowned.</p>

<p>"Partly that," said Timberline.</p>

<p>He settled his shoulders more comfortably against the stump
that supported his back, like a chair. Then, staring through the
clear mountain air, he looked down the ragged, tree-covered side
of the mountain and to the valley beneath, where an irregular
silver stream was running. It was for moments like these that
Timberline lived, almost more than for moments of high
action.</p>

<p>Winton argued, "You got Ever wrong. He's all right."</p>

<p>"Of course he's all right," said Timberline. "Hell, he's
better than all right! He's a champion&mdash;a champion gunman,
is what I mean."</p>

<p>"He's sowing his wild oats, that's all," said the uncle,
frowning again.</p>

<p>"Sowing 'em? Yes&mdash;and watch 'em grow, too. There'll be a
harvest that'll fill a lot of barns with worse than wild
fire."</p>

<p>"He's got the bit in his teeth and he's running a little wild,
that's all," argued the uncle.</p>

<p>"You can put it that way if you like," said Timberline.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Winton. "Ever never would have kicked over
the traces, but for me. He wanted to help me, the same as any
good boy would. He wanted to help me&mdash;and he did. And now
he'll go back and settle down to a steady life." He added,
"That's what I wanta talk to you about."</p>

<p>"Go ahead and talk," said Timberline. "I'll listen, all
right."</p>

<p>"He's to work out the Red Pacer and what you did for me, until
you tell him that you're through with him," said Clay. "Well,
when will that time come?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Timberline, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>He turned his clear, coldly dark eye upon his companion, and
waited.</p>

<p>Said Clay Winton: "You've got him. I'll offer you a
substitute."</p>

<p>"What?."</p>

<p>"Myself."</p>

<p>"Go on and explain that."</p>

<p>"You want somebody you can rely on. You want somebody who'll
be at your back in any sort of a pinch. Ain't that your
idea?"</p>

<p>"You've named it. But go on."</p>

<p>"Well, it's like this. You've made your bargain, and Ever
means to stick to it. There's no doubt about that."</p>

<p>"I don't think there is."</p>

<p>"All right. But you'll find me a lot more useful than Ever. I
can shoot about as straight. I can ride about as far. Besides,
I've been through a lot more than he has. I've got an experienced
head; one that would be useful to you in some of your
schemes."</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, you'd have too many ideas," said
Timberline. "I want somebody who's straight. The kid's straight.
I want somebody who's afraid of nothing. The kid's not afraid of
the devil on wheels. I want somebody who's tied to me; and the
kid's tied to me because I gave him the Pacer and because I
helped you out of jail. That makes him perfect, as far as I'm
concerned."</p>

<p>Winton was lost in thought. "You gotta think of another
thing," he said.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"You've gotta remember that he's chucking his life away. I
ain't gonna talk about the breakin' of his mother's heart, and
his father's. That won't matter. But I say that he'll be throwin'
himself away. He's meant for something better."</p>

<p>"He'll never go back; he'll never go straight," answered
Timberline.</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"Because he's too much like me."</p>

<p>"He's not so much like you, Timberline."</p>

<p>"It's in his eye," answered Timberline. "A tame life is no
life for him, after this. He's got the juice of the wild in him.
Trouble is what he'll hunt, from now on. I see it in him every
day. You wouldn't be the same. You're a cool fellow, and you're
older. You're a grand fighter, it's true. You've got a head on
your shoulders, too. But did you see Ever when he came out of the
jail?"</p>

<p>"I saw him," said the uncle, gloomily.</p>

<p>"He was laughing, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Sort of hysterical, I'd call it."</p>

<p>"Then you'd call it wrong. He was just happy&mdash;and that's
the sort of a man I want."</p>

<p>"You won't let go of him, then?" asked Winton, facing full at
his companion.</p>

<p>"No, I'll never let up on him. I need him. Maybe the days will
come when he'll need me, too."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;stand up!" commanded Winton, in a changed
voice.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Timberline, leaning forward a
little, his face suddenly both formidable and studious, like that
of a wolf when it scents prey down the wind.</p>

<p>"Stand up," repeated Winton, quietly.</p>

<p>Timberline rose without touching his hands to the ground.</p>

<p>"If you won't take me in his place, then you'll take neither
of us," said Winton.</p>

<p>"Guns, Clay? Is that what you mean?" asked Timberline.</p>

<p>"That's what I mean. I won't let him go to hell because of
me&mdash;and you."</p>

<p>"You've thought it over?" asked Timberline, curiously and
without fear.</p>

<p>"I've thought it all over," said Clay Winton, with an equal
calm. "Anyway it turns out, I win."</p>

<p>"How do you make that out?"</p>

<p>"If I kill you, he can't follow you no more. If you kill me,
you'll have to try to kill him afterwards."</p>

<p>Timberline frowned as he saw the full beauty of the
scheme.</p>

<p>"I hate to think you're such a low hound, Clay," said he.</p>

<p>"I've been a low hound before, maybe," said Clay Winton. "But
I'm not bein' a low hound, now."</p>

<p>He added: "You go for your gun and fill your hand. You can
make the first move."</p>

<p>Timberline studied his opponent.</p>

<p>"I'm a bit better with a gun than you are, Clay," said he,
"and you know it. You really want to die?"</p>

<p>Winton extended an arm and pointed down the slope of the
mountain.</p>

<p>"I want him set loose," he answered, sternly.</p>

<p>A new idea came to Timberline.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said. "Al and Garry will be back by the
evening, and they'll bring all the news there is to get. Suppose
that the kid was recognized, the other evening in the jail. He
lingered around long enough for 'em to see him. What if he was
recognized?"</p>

<p>Clay Winton drew back a little.</p>

<p>"Luck couldn't be that much agin him!" he declared.</p>

<p>"Wait and see," said Timberline. "If they spotted him, it's no
good to send him back to his ranch. You'd simply be sending him
to a life in jail."</p>

<p>Clay considered, his face very dark.</p>

<p>"Breakin' into a jail," he muttered, "and then helpin' a
prisoner loose. That's two counts, and two long ones. Worse'n
burglary by a whole heap. Then&mdash;shootin' down an officer of
the law. That's worse still."</p>

<p>He jerked up his head.</p>

<p>"We'll wait till we get news," he said.</p>

<p>"We're friends till then?" asked Timberline, cautiously.</p>

<p>"Aye, I suppose so." And Winton stalked off among the
trees.</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch24" name="ch24"></a>XXIV. &mdash; IN THE SOUP</h2>

<p class="first">THE camp fire glowed like a great eye with
multiple red pupils, sending out dull rays through the darkness,
gilding the rocks, and dimly touching the foliage of the trees.
It fell on Clay Winton's ominous face.</p>

<p>Clays nephew, and Timberline, sat farther back, finishing
their coffee. And now, as Timberline rolled a cigarette, Everard
Winton lifted his head and whistled softly. A whinny hardly
louder than the whistle made answer.</p>

<p>"Ah-ha!" murmured Ever, triumphantly. "Hear him,
Timberline?"</p>

<p>"Hell be singing scales for you in another day or two,"
suggested Timberline, with a smile.</p>

<p>Ever laughed, happily. He lay back on the pine needles, his
head pillowed in his hands and his eyes drifting past the dark
tops of the pines and toward the chilly, bright multitudes of the
stars.</p>

<p>"Think of the rest of 'em!" he murmured, finally.</p>

<p>The two older men were watching him, one openly, one
covertly.</p>

<p>"The rest?" asked his uncle, finally.</p>

<p>"All the others who are down there. Everybody who's not up
here. Think of 'em!"</p>

<p>"They're getting on pretty well, I guess," said Clay. "They've
got their families around 'em, those men. They've finished their
days work. They've had their supper. They've got a snug night
before 'em."</p>

<p>"The men are sitting out on the verandas," said Ever. "They've
got on slippers, to rest their feet, perhaps. Now and then a
mosquito comes along with a song and dance, and spears 'em. But
they're too tired even to fight back. And tomorrow'll be a dead
ringer for this day.</p>

<p>"Out in the dust of the streets the brats are either tumbling
about or chasing each other. Somebody bangs a tin piano and
hammers out a thousand-year-old tune, with a lot of halts and
pauses in it. Somebody's baby begins to squall. And back in the
kitchens the women are sloshing the dishes or the tins around in
a lot of gray, greasy water, and wondering why God put 'em on
this sort of earth."</p>

<p>He paused, waited for an answer, got none, and continued.</p>

<p>"No, they're not even wondering. They're submitting to
everything that comes to 'em. If they started wondering, they'd
get up and break away. They'd leave the whole thing cold behind
'em. They'd pack and start off with fishing rods and rifles, and
they'd make a living in the hills. That's what they'd do!"</p>

<p>"Even the women?" asked Clay.</p>

<p>"Yes, even the women. They can be human beings, too. Look at
mother. She's worked hard, but she's still straight as a string.
She still has a young step. She can ride a horse like a wild
Indian. She can shoot a deer at four hundred yards. She's a hand
with a shotgun, too. And by one look at a stream she can tell the
pools and the white water that the fish will like. She can tell
better than you or I can, Uncle Clay. She ought to be up here
like we are, free. It's living down there in the dust&mdash;down
in the lowlands, hitched to the ranch and to milking cows and to
dishwater and to mending clothes&mdash;that's what kills women
like her."</p>

<p>He was silent again. He began to breathe deeply, his eyes
closed.</p>

<p>"He's dropped off," muttered Timberline, presently. "He's got
some ideas, that kid."</p>

<p>"I'm not asleep," said Ever. "I was just inhaling this air.
I've been so long on the ranch that I'd forgotten that air could
taste like this&mdash;right down to the bottom of the lungs. Feel
it?"</p>

<p>"I feel it," said Timberline, quietly.</p>

<p>There was a short, low whinny from the brush.</p>

<p>"That's the Pacer!" exclaimed Ever, and he bounded to his
feet.</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?" asked Clay Winton. "Gonna go and tuck the
baby in with a blanket, maybe? Afraid he'll catch cold?"</p>

<p>Ever paid no attention to this mockery.</p>

<p>"That's his danger signal," said he. "There's something near
us."</p>

<p>Timberline stood up in turn.</p>

<p>Ever stepped out into the darkness; and they heard him speak
softly to the horse. Then, after another moment, another horse
snorted in the distance, down the mountainside.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Ever," said Timberline. "Probably just Al and
Garry coming in."</p>

<p>"I'll make sure," said Ever, in a guarded voice.</p>

<p>Clay Winton was tense, with an excitement that grew greater
and greater as human voices presently sounded from below.</p>

<p>"We'll know, in a minute or two," he muttered.</p>

<p>"Aye, we'll know," said Timberline.</p>

<p>Then Garry and Al came in. They brought with them a cargo of
food&mdash;chiefly flour and bacon and coffee, with a few
luxuries such as tinned jams, and a final can or two of
tomatoes.</p>

<p>As the packs were undone and the contents arranged in five
parcels to match the five men, Ever, who had met and escorted the
pair up the slope, stirred the fire and put bacon in the pan. The
coffee began to murmur in the pot.</p>

<p>Clay Winton, in the meantime, had found the newspapers that
were brought up; and fumbling among them, he found news that kept
him silent for a long moment.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it, Clay?" asked Timberline, at last.</p>

<p>"Bad!" said the uncle.</p>

<p>He read aloud, giving the contents partly in his own words,
partly in direct quotation.</p>

<p>"They rode all over the face of the hills. We went and
mysteriously disappeared, it looks like... Got a reward offered
for me now, boys. That'll warm things up a little. Yeah, it'll
warm 'em up a pile. You'll be glad to have me along with you yet,
Timberline."</p>

<p>"We can stand that, Clay," said Timberline.</p>

<p>Clay Winton continued, "This is for you, Ever."</p>

<p>"All right," said the boy, turning sharply.</p>

<p>"Well, listen.'The jailer, Jeremiah P. Huntington, declares
that he recognized the man who fired the shot that struck him on
the right leg, halfway between the hip and the knee. He was
unwilling to give testimony' Hello, think of that!"</p>

<p>"Why wouldn't he wanta give testimony?" demanded Garry.</p>

<p>"He says he could of been shot through the heart, as easy as
through the leg. Wait a minute, here's some more. They got him to
talk, finally. The damn lawyers, they could make a saint talk!
Here's some more of Jerry, the jailer."</p>

<p>Again he read aloud:</p>

<p>"'Finally the jailer swore that he had recognized the face and
the figure of young Everard Winton, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Edward Winton of Savage Creek Road, respected members of this
community. This startling information causes great disturbance to
the many friends of the Wintons, and it is hoped that Mr.
Huntington may have made a mistake.</p>

<p>"'Young Winton, however, is missing from his home. It appears
that he had left it to go to the ranch of Harry Lawson. He was
seen there, in fact, with his uncle, Clay Winton, the escaped
prisoner, at the moment when Sheriff Darrow made the arrest.
Harry Lawson, when questioned, declared that after the arrest had
been made, and the sheriff had returned toward town with the
prisoner, young Everard Winton told him that he was going to go
into the hills for a short hunting trip.</p>

<p>"'Mr. Lawson pointed out the direction in which young Winton
had ridden. This trail has been followed, and it may lead to
something.</p>

<p>"'Mr. Huntington was perfectly convinced and positive in his
testimony, and he says he had a good look at the face of young
Winton. An air of probability is given to this testimony by the
fact that it is well known that Everard Winton was his uncle's
constant companion. It is a sad thing to reflect that'"</p>

<p>Clay Winton broke off his reading and allowed the paper to
flutter from his hand to the ground.</p>

<p>"Well, you're in the soup, brother!" said Al to Ever.</p>

<p>"Shut your face, you fat-headed fool!" snarled little Garry to
his bigger companion.</p>

<p>A dead silence held the group, all at once. The fumes of
burning bacon wafted unnoticed from the frying pan.</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch25" name="ch25"></a>XXV. &mdash; A REAL JOB</h2>

<p class="first">THEY stood side by side in the gray of the next
morning&mdash;Timberline and Ever. The day was gray above and
gray below. High clouds sheeted away the sun and most of its
light; low-driven masses swallowed up the bottoms of the ravines,
the rivers, and the plain beyond. They lived in a world that was
bounded by two seas of mist, and films of the grayness curled up
among the pine trees near at hand.</p>

<p>The leader was pointing.</p>

<p>"You know where Bentonville is, Ever?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Heard of it?"</p>

<p>"Just that it's a gold rush town."</p>

<p>"That's what it is. Could you get to the Benton River from
here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I might wander a little, but I could get there."</p>

<p>"You get there, then," said Timberline. "I've heard there's a
fellow there I want to get in touch with. He's Carson
Jimmy&mdash;some people call him Jimmy Carson. Ever hear of
him?"</p>

<p>"I have. Some sort of a big crook?"</p>

<p>"He's all sorts," said Timberline. "I'm some sort of a crook
myself; but he's all sorts. Understand?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do. That is&mdash;he's an all-round bad one,
eh?"</p>

<p>"That depends on what you mean by 'bad.' Whatever he is, he's
a good crook. That is, he's successful."</p>

<p>Ever nodded, frowning a little at this definition.</p>

<p>"And now that you're with me," said Timberline, crisply, "I
expect some good crooked work out of you, too. Understand?"</p>

<p>"I understand," said Ever.</p>

<p>"Go hard against the grain?" asked Timberline, watching him
with brilliant eyes.</p>

<p>"It's all right," said Ever. "I'm your man, for anything you
mention."</p>

<p>"Well then, you ride down to Bentonville. When you're in the
town you'll be in a little danger, but not much. Men aren't
likely to recognize the Red Pacer. They've heard of him, and some
of them have seen him, but they haven't seen him bridlewise, and
under a saddle."</p>

<p>"He'd look different now, I suppose."</p>

<p>"He looks different&mdash;and he is different. And if you make
him do a few tricks, nobody'll dream that he's the man-eating
Pacer."</p>

<p>"I follow you."</p>

<p>"When you get to the town, you'll follow your nose down the
main street to the Sentinel Hotel. Get a room there, and ask for
Dolly Gray."</p>

<p>"I'll write it down."</p>

<p>"Don't write down anything! Never write down anything while
you're working with me. Writing things down is what hangs
men."</p>

<p>"Jimmy Carson&mdash;Bentonville&mdash;the Sentinel
Hotel&mdash;Dolly Gray.</p>

<p>"I have the names."</p>

<p>"That's the way, Ever. Lodge 'em in your head. If you forget,
it means tiding all the way back here to see me, and you wouldn't
want to do that."</p>

<p>"No," agreed Everard Winton.</p>

<p>"Dolly Gray isn't her real name&mdash;it's Dorothy Gray
Siddenham, or something long like that. But the boys call her
Dolly Gray for the short of it, and because it fits her. I'll
give you an idea of what she is, and tell you why afterward.</p>

<p>"Before the boom hit Bentonville, the Sentinel Hotel was just
a crossroads place, and it was run by Dolly's father. The boom
came, the business got big, and Dolly's father ran into a chunk
of lead, one evening in his barroom.</p>

<p>"Dolly nursed her father through, but he got tuberculosis
lying on his back. She hired a nurse and sent him off to the
mountains to a resort, while she stays at home and runs the hotel
to clear her old man's expenses. Makes you think that she's one
of these meek and mild martyrs, eh? But you'll see you're wrong
when you meet her. Dolly's only eighteen, but she grew up young.
When she's a year older&mdash;because wiser she'll never
be&mdash;I'm going to marry her. That's what you're to tell
her."</p>

<p>"I'm to tell Dolly Gray that you intend to marry her in
another year."</p>

<p>"That's it. She'll laugh, but she'll give you a good room on
account of it, and she'll keep you out of trouble. Nobody in
Bentonville can do that as well as she can."</p>

<p>Ever nodded and Timberline continued:</p>

<p>"Then you go to call on Carson Jimmy&mdash;or Jimmy Carson,
any way you choose to put it. The point is that Jimmy always does
things on a big scale&mdash;and so do I. I think it's about time
for us to work in double harness together, Jimmy and me. He may
have heard of me, but he's not likely to know me well; and he's
likely to pretend that he doesn't know me at all. That's where
you come in. You show him that no matter what he thinks, I'm
worth knowing."</p>

<p>He laughed as he said this, and a flare of light came into his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Worth knowing?" repeated Ever.</p>

<p>"Yes, worth knowing. So worth knowing that he can't get along
without me. When you've convinced him of that, you can tell him
I'm willing to make a deal with him, and that we'll work the town
of Bentonville together. While the rush is on, it's worth
running!"</p>

<p>"I'm to make him put a high value on you. But how am I to do
that?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me," snapped Timberline. "If you're worth your salt
to me you're up to harder jobs than this. You go down there to
Bentonville and just try your hand."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Ever. "I'll go down there and teach Jimmy
Carson that you're on the map."</p>

<p>"That's exactly what you're to teach him. Like the idea?"</p>

<p>"I'll do my best," said Ever, evasively.</p>

<p>"If anything goes wrong and Carson Jimmy doesn't want to play
ball with me, you can tell him that I'm on the other side of the
fence. Bentonville is always in need of a bang-up good new deputy
sheriff or a town marshal or something like that. Since Carson
showed up, there are likely to be more vacancies than officers.
And I might slip into an empty spot, with you at my side and some
of the other boys along."</p>

<p>He laughed again and snapped his fingers.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact," he continued, "I don't give a damn.
Wherever Carson is, the game is sure to be fast and the stakes
high. And that's what I want. With him or against him makes very
little difference. So long as I'm sitting at the same table or
fighting in the same ring."</p>

<p>"To enforce the law? That would be a joke&mdash;the law wants
me and wants me badly," said Ever.</p>

<p>But there was a grin on his face.</p>

<p>"Of course it would be a joke," said Timberline. "A good joke,
too. Nobody is apt to spot you, though. A mining town makes its
own horizon. Wall Street could burn and smash, and a gold rush
town would never hear of it for a year. Now, I've told you
everything I want you to know. It's a big job, but I hope to give
you still bigger ones before I'm through with you. Get on your
way, Ever. My idea in sending you is to play up the size of my
hand. If Jimmy Carson doesn't know me, he has to figure me pretty
high, when he realizes you're one of my men."</p>

<p>Instinctively, Everard unbuckled his belt, drew it tighter by
a notch, and slipped the loose end back through the guard.</p>

<p>"I'll try to play up," said he.</p>

<p>"Are you ready to ride?"</p>

<p>"I'll say so long to Uncle Clay and start now."</p>

<p>"Clay's gone up to the creek to try to catch some trout for
breakfast. Never mind saying good-by to him."</p>

<p>"I'd better say good-by to him."</p>

<p>"No, you'd better not. I'll tell him that I sent you away on
an errand. If you stop to talk to him, he'll get bluer than ever.
He's almost blue enough for suicide right now."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're right. I'll start, then."</p>

<p>"Start fast, and go easy till you get to Bentonville. Then
burn up the town." He added, "Got any money?"</p>

<p>"I'll manage."</p>

<p>"No, you won't," said Timberline. "If you represent me, you
can't be a piker. You need money&mdash;and here's some! So long!
Now get the Pacer and start!"</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch26" name="ch26"></a>XXVI. &mdash; CARSON JIMMY</h2>

<p class="first">EVERYTHING seemed almost easy to Ever except the
money that lay in his pocket. Stolen money. The Wintons were not
the people to deal with that stuff. Or had it been stolen in
fact? Perhaps it was only the proceeds of one of Timberline's
more honest exploits.</p>

<p>He conned the matter over as he passed down into the level of
the lower mist and reached the brilliance of sunshine among the
foothills.</p>

<p>He hit Benton River in the early afternoon and came into
Bentonville in the heat of the day. He had had a glimpse of boom
towns before this, and Bentonville was like many of the others.
It was simply a scattering of tents, lean-tos, shacks made of
box-wood or flattened tin cans, with rude thatchings of grass and
pine branches for roofs, as likely as not. In the streets were a
thousand people, each a different type. From the four quarters of
the land they had come, some to hunt fortunes in the ground,
others to hunt their luck in the pockets of those who had dug
wealth out of the rock.</p>

<p>Ever's heart began to rise as the stallion took him at that
flowing stride along the street. The Red Pacer was not a red
stallion any longer; he was gray from head to foot, except where
the sweat had worked through in little rivulets. But dusty or
not, he was enough to make men stop short and look once and then
look again. Once the horse was recognized, might not recognition
of his rider follow? What did the law know? And even if the Pacer
were not known, how long would it be before pictures of Ever, as
a criminal wanted by the law, were in the hands of the officers
here?</p>

<p>Ever felt like a gambler who sits in at a game where the
stakes are as high as life or death, but he was glad to be
there.</p>

<p>The Sentinel Hotel was a fairly large building, rising out of
the half-story level of the rest of the town. The original
structure had been a two-story affair, and wings had been added
to it to accommodate part of the rush population. Sheds further
extended its possibilities for receiving guests. Behind stood a
great barn with shelving roofs to take in the livestock.
Altogether it looked like a flourishing concern, the Sentinel
Hotel, and as Ever put his horse in the stable he wondered how an
eighteen-year-old girl could possibly manage it.</p>

<p>He went into the lobby, which had been enlarged to meet the
prosperous times by knocking down the partitions of several
adjoining rooms. At one time or another during the day all the
population of Bentonville flowed through this lobby.</p>

<p>To the little one-armed man who acted as clerk Ever said, "I
want to see Dolly Gray."</p>

<p>"Everybody else does, too," answered the other, with the
insolent impertinence of a cripple. "What you want to see her
for?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell her that," said Ever.</p>

<p>The clerk frowned, hesitated, finally rose and led the
way.</p>

<p>"Aw&mdash;all right," said he. "Come along. But she's
busy."</p>

<p>He went to a door at the side of the lobby, knocked on it, and
then pushed it open.</p>

<p>A red-headed girl with a face as tanned as leather looked up
from behind a table loaded with stacks of papers&mdash;hotel
bills and accounts, perhaps.</p>

<p>"This fellow wants to see you," said the clerk.</p>

<p>He closed the door behind Ever, and left him looking into a
pair of sea-green eyes. Dolly Gray had folded her hands behind
her head and was pressing back against them, like one whose neck
aches from too much book-work.</p>

<p>"I don't know you, do I?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"No," said he.</p>

<p>The matter of a new name for him, strangely enough, had not
entered his mind before.</p>

<p>"I'm Bill Smith," he added.</p>

<p>"I place you right away," said the girl. "Bill Smithborn way
up the Mississippi&mdash;age between fifteen and
thirty&mdash;height, average&mdash;eyes, average&mdash; no marks
of identification. Are you a brother of Bill Jones, by any
chance?"</p>

<p>He smiled. "Timberline asked me to call on you," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, did he?" said the girl. "Haul up a chair. How's old
Timber, anyway?"</p>

<p>"He's all right," said Ever, bringing a chair nearer to the
table, though he did not sit down.</p>

<p>"He wasn't all right the last time I knew him," she said, with
meaning. "You know him, Bill?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes. I know him a little."</p>

<p>"Nobody knows all about him," she said. "He's spread his
history over too much ground for that. What's the news from
Timber?"</p>

<p>"He's sending word to you that he'll be marrying you in about
a year."</p>

<p>"Did he sent that word?" said she, without smiling. "That's
all right, too."</p>

<p>"After I had told you that, Timberline said," went on Winton,
"you'd take care of me and keep me out of trouble."</p>

<p>She leaned forward and rested her elbows on the edge of the
table. It was characteristic of her that over her face came those
rapid changes of expression that are usually seen only in a man's
face. Beauty is a thing that is kept undistorted. We see no more
of it than the mirror has taught the owner to reveal. But Dolly
Gray was different. She had a boy's careless freedom.</p>

<p>"So you want to be taken care of?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'm only repeating what Timberline said," he remarked. "In a
town like this, I suppose everybody wants to be taken care
of."</p>

<p>"Are you one of Timber's men?" she said.</p>

<p>"I'm one of his friends," said he.</p>

<p>"You're new in the business, said she, shrewdly. "What's the
game this time? Crooked or straight?"</p>

<p>"I'm to see Jimmy Carson," said he.</p>

<p>"Carson Jimmy&mdash;Jimmy Carson, eh?" she answered. "Crooked
business, then. Aren't you pretty young to be calling on
Carson?"</p>

<p>"I have a calling card with me," he said, moved by a strange
impulse.</p>

<p>"Have you? What is it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Five fingers, all on one hand," said he.</p>

<p>She was not amused; she was not even very interested. She
merely looked him up and down, gravely.</p>

<p>"Going to present 'em to Jimmy Carson? Well, I'll tell you
where he lives."</p>

<p>"That's what I'd like to know."</p>

<p>"Second floor, Number Twenty-one. Just step up and knock.
You'll find he has some friends with him. Make yourself at home
in the Sentinel. Anything I can do, let me know."</p>

<p>She stood up. He walked to the door.</p>

<p>"Look here, Bill," she said suddenly.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Aren't you pretty young to be mixing around with all these
big, rough men? These Timberlines and Carsons, and what-nots?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said he. "Do I look young?"</p>

<p>"Just out of the cradle," said she. "Second floor, Number
Twenty-one. You'll find him there."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said he.</p>

<p>He opened the door. She called over her shoulder to the
clerk:</p>

<p>"Fix up Bill Smith, Shorty, will you?" And then her voice
sounded softly behind him: "Think it over, Bill&mdash;or Joe or
Harry or whatever your name is&mdash; and don't be a fool!"</p>

<p>The door closed in his face as he half turned. He went back to
the desk and found that one-armed Shorty was waiting for him with
a key in his hand.</p>

<p>"Here's Number Twenty-nine," said he. "Best thing we got
vacant. Go up and let yourself in, and if there's anything you
want come down and say so."</p>

<p>Ever climbed the steps to the upper hall, found his room, and
let himself in. It was a perfectly plain room, and small, but it
was on a corner of the building, and it had two windows. The
southern one looked over the street. He leaned on the windowsill
for a moment, with the heat pouring upon his head, and stared at
the constant procession of riders, pedestrians, wagons of all
sorts. There were no sidewalks in Bentonville. A huge freight
wagon went by, lurching from side to side, putting down its tires
into chuckholes and making the dust spurt out like water. Little
dust clouds followed it and blew away down the street. It was a
new town; it was a place where anything could happen; and he was
glad that he was in it.</p>

<p>Something was in his mind; he hardly knew what. An emotion, he
discovered, rather than an idea. He decided that it was the girl.
Her direct, green eyes, her husky voice, remained with him. There
was something behind both her eyes and her voice. For instance,
she had neither simpered nor blushed when he had told her that
Timberline intended to marry her within a year. He might have
been speaking to a post.</p>

<p>He felt a little ineffectual, remembering her; he felt weak
and useless and ill at ease. He had a great desire to do
something that would bring him vividly to her attention.</p>

<p>He went to the washstand, poured some water into the granite
basin, washed his face, scrubbed the grease of the reins off his
hands, dusted his clothes, rubbed up his riding boots, and retied
his bandanna. When he felt that he was fit once more, he settled
his sombrero on his head again and went down the hall to Number
Twenty-one, which was at the farther corner of the building.</p>

<p>Voices came through the door and he paused for a moment, his
hand raised to knock.</p>

<p>A little man only a few inches over five feet suddenly came up
beside him with a rapid step.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked, with an air of authority.</p>

<p>He had a pale, peaked face. He wore a cap with a deep visor,
and his eyes glimmered and twinkled through the shadow which this
headgear cast.</p>

<p>"I've come down here from Timberline," said Ever.</p>

<p>"Don't know him!" said the little man, curtly.</p>

<p>"He knows you. Isn't that enough?" asked Ever, angrily.</p>

<p>"Not enough for me," said the other.</p>

<p>He pulled the door open, stepped inside and slammed it in
Ever's face. The latter, stunned and enraged, heard the same
voice continue inside the room. All the other voices were now
quiet.</p>

<p>"There's a chestnut stallion down in the stable. I just seen
it. Real red chestnut with a white stocking. Get that horse for
me, Buck."</p>

<p>Said an answering voice, "Who owns that plug, chief?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me? I told you to get me that horse. He's something
I could ride." Everard Winton turned and went hastily, almost
guiltily, back to his room. There he sat down, lighted a
cigarette, and waited. He felt both stimulated and at ease. In
all probability something was about to happen.</p>

<p>He took out the revolver which Clay Winton had given to him,
spun the cylinder, tried the action, and replaced it with one
swift, sure gesture beneath the pit of his left arm. He felt
cooler and more than ever content with life, as he leaned back in
his chair again. He did not need news print to occupy his mind
during the interim.</p>

<p>Before many minutes, a hand rapped on his door.</p>

<p>"Come in," he called.</p>

<p>The door opened and a big fellow with a sun-reddened face came
in.</p>

<p>It was the voice of "Buck," who inquired, "Are you Bill
Smith?"</p>

<p>"I'm Smith," said Winton, rising and coming politely
forward.</p>

<p>Army name is Buck Waters," said the other, holding out a great
paw.</p>

<p>"Glad to know you, Mr. Waters," said Everard.</p>

<p>"Glad to know you&mdash;and glad to know your horse, too. You
own that chestnut son of a streak of sunlight, don't you? Out
there in the stable?"</p>

<p>"I own him," said Ever.</p>

<p>"I'd like to," said Buck. "That's why I'm takin' up your time.
Wanta sell?"</p>

<p>Ever shook his head.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said he. "Here are the makings. Glad to talk horse
to you, but I won't sell."</p>

<p>"I know what you mean," said the other. "You wouldn't want to
take two or three hundred for him, eh? What did you pay for him,
might I ask?"</p>

<p>"You might," said Ever. "I didn't pay for him."</p>

<p>"Raised him, eh?"</p>

<p>"In a way." And young Winton smiled a little as he thought of
the wild skies and the north winds that had fathered the Red
Pacer on the open range.</p>

<p>"Well," said Buck Waters, "I ain't a piker, brother. I won't
sit down, but I'll offer you a flat five hundred bucks for that
horse. He fills my eye."</p>

<p>"Does he? He fills mine, too. And five hundred doesn't fill my
hand."</p>

<p>Buck frowned a little.</p>

<p>"What price would you make?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'm not putting a price on him at all," said Ever.</p>

<p>"Come along, come along!" said Buck. "Everybody's willing to
sell a horse&mdash;for a price. I'll pay you the right price. You
name it?"</p>

<p>Winton shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you like him. But I'm not selling. I'm not naming a
price."</p>

<p>Buck grew beet-red with impatient anger.</p>

<p>"I guess I see how it is," he explained to himself, though in
a loud voice. "You raised that hoss from a colt, and you think
he's the only one in the world. But I'll tell you&mdash;I'll give
you a thousand dollars."</p>

<p>A new idea came to Ever.</p>

<p>"You're one of Carson's friends, aren't you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Sure I am," said Buck.</p>

<p>"Does he want the horse for himself?"</p>

<p>"Why, maybe he does, at that," agreed Buck, greatly
surprised.</p>

<p>"Well," said Ever, "I don't mind talking the thing over with
him in person."</p>

<p>"Don't you?" said the other, doubtfully. "Well, come along
down the hall with me."</p>

<p>They went down to Number Twenty-one, where Buck pushed the
door open without knocking.</p>

<p>"You red-faced lump of beef!" snarled a voice. "Whacha mean by
openin' that door without giving it a rap, eh?"</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch27" name="ch27"></a>XXVII. &mdash; HORSE OR MAN</h2>

<p class="first">BUCK drew back half a stride.</p>

<p>"Why, I was gonna tell you about the horse," said he.</p>

<p>"Aw, well, come in then. Whatcha pay for it?"</p>

<p>Buck pushed the door wider and stepped inside. Ever followed
him. Little Jimmy Carson, his cap still on his head, stood up
suddenly from his chair and pointed.</p>

<p>"Where'd you get that?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Why, he's the guy that has the horse," complained Buck.</p>

<p>"Take him out," said Carson. "I won't talk to him."</p>

<p>He sat down again and turned his back on Buck and Winton. He
was giving his attention to a stalwart with a dark, foreign face.
The man's head was almost without a back to it, and it was lodged
on top of an immense column of a neck. This man favored the two
who had been checked at the door with a sour grin and looked back
at Carson again.</p>

<p>"The chief's on the rampage. Something's gone wrong," declared
Buck, turning to leave the room.</p>

<p>But Winton stepped on past him.</p>

<p>"That's all right, Buck," said he. "I've a few things to say
to your chief."</p>

<p>Slowly, controlling his rage, Carson Jimmy turned his head.
The fingers of his left hand, which hung over the back of his
chair, sprang in and out from the palm like the legs of a
struggling spider.</p>

<p>"Back out of here, Smith, you fool!" said Buck, in a murmur.
"The chief's mad!"</p>

<p>"Why, that's all right," said Winton, his voice cheerfully
raised. "If he's mad that doesn't matter to me. I'm just a
messenger."</p>

<p>Carson rose to his feet again and turned, very slowly. He
said, with a world of dangerous gentleness:</p>

<p>"Oh, you're a messenger, are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Winton. "I came down from Timberline to see
you."</p>

<p>"Oh, you came down from Timberline, did you?" said Carson, his
voice still gentle, and his left hand working.</p>

<p>"A left-handed shot," thought Ever to himself. He continued:
"Timberline gave me a message for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, he gave you a message, did he?" said Carson.</p>

<p>Madness flashed from his eyes, which jerked their glance back
and forth across the room like lightning before they settled
again on Ever's face.</p>

<p>"You see, chief," whined big Buck, "I offered him a thousand
flat. But he said he wanted to talk to you"</p>

<p>"You hulk of a half-witted jackass!" said Carson, drawing his
lips back from his teeth as he spoke the words.</p>

<p>He stopped, gasping for breath, his lips working rapidly over
things which he was unable to get out. Then:</p>

<p>"Get out!" he yelled.</p>

<p>He pointed an arm like a gun at Ever.</p>

<p>"Get out!" he repeated. "Fargo&mdash;Buck&mdash;throw him out.
Break the fool's back. I don't care!"</p>

<p>"You'd better move," said Buck, laying a hand on the shoulder
of Winton.</p>

<p>Fargo, the man with the foreign face and the wrestler's
shoulders, loomed suddenly on the scene.</p>

<p>"Out!" he growled, barking the word, and reached suddenly in
with a wrestler's hold.</p>

<p>Ever planted a jolting left on the root of Fargo's nose, slid
from under Buck's hand and met that gentleman's charge with a
right hook. It was a neat blow, a prized invention of Clay
Winton, and a very deft variation of the classic punch. It
started low and looked like an uppercut flying wide, until it
turned in a high loop and dropped toward the face. Upon Buck
Waters' outthrust jaw, as he charged in, it was a stunning blow.
His own charge gave an added weight to the punch. He kept right
on charging with his legs and falling with the rest of his body
until he had rammed himself into a corner of the room. There he
lay still.</p>

<p>But Fargo had not been seriously hurt by the blow he had
received. It had merely caused him to change his mind. Shifting
from his idea of a wrestling hold, he swung for Ever's head, with
a slungshot in the tips of his fingers.</p>

<p>It was a well-aimed blow, but it hissed over Ever's ducked
head. Straightening, the boy pumped a brace of uppercuts into
Fargo's chin, and found the effect as ungrateful as pounding a
stone wall.</p>

<p>Again he dodged the fateful slungshot, and gave a right hook,
with all his weight behind it.</p>

<p>Fargo grunted. He stood still and brought into his left hand a
revolver that looked to Ever as big as a cannon. So Ever struck
again, sliding his left foot forward, rising on his toes with the
beginning of the punch, and dropping on his heels as it landed.
Exquisite timing put all his one hundred and seventy pounds into
the whiplash finish of that blow.</p>

<p>Fargo's face withered and wrinkled into ten thousand lines.
The gun fell from his hand and slithered down his leg to the
floor. He began to sit down, with buckling knees. He tried to
right himself, and began to stagger back with little rapid steps.
Then his legs gave way completely and he sat down heavily against
the wall.</p>

<p>Winton picked up the fallen gun, but found himself covered by
Carson. There was a grin on the face of the little man now,
however.</p>

<p>"The pair of big bums!" said he. "The pair of big hams! They
couldn't handle a kid like you, eh? Put that gat away before it
hurts you, kid!"</p>

<p>Winton obediently laid the gun on the table.</p>

<p>"I came to talk. I didn't come to fight," said he.
"Timberline"</p>

<p>"Oh, damn Timberline!" said the other. "What about that
stallion? What's your price?"</p>

<p>Winton frowned.</p>

<p>"I'm the same price as the horse," said he.</p>

<p>The other lifted his eyebrows. Then he grinned again.</p>

<p>"Well, that's pretty good, too," said he.</p>

<p>Fargo got to his feet, swaying.</p>

<p>"Hey, Fargo," said the chief, "leave go of that knife, will
you, and take hold of Buck and drag him out into the fresh air?
The kid went and poisoned him!"</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch28" name="ch28"></a>XXVIII. &mdash; NEWS FROM
TIMBERLINE</h2>

<p class="first">BUCK, if not poisoned, seemed at least overcome
with drowsiness. Fargo half jerked and half helped him to his
feet, and then out of the room. As the door closed on them, Jimmy
Carson said:</p>

<p>"That was all right&mdash;and right is what I mean! A mean
wallop you pack in that hand. Who taught you to slam that hook
across the shoulder?"</p>

<p>"An uncle of mine taught me."</p>

<p>"What's all this about Timberline?"</p>

<p>"You never heard of him?"</p>

<p>"Maybe I did, somewhere. He's one of these birds that's maybe
inside or outside the fence, or else roosting right on top of
it."</p>

<p>Ever shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"He plays the game for the sake of the game," said he,
honestly. "He doesn't much care what the game may be."</p>

<p>"That sounds like something, maybe," said Carson Jimmy, "but
it don't mean anything to me. What game you talking about?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm talking about anything that happens to get his eye.
Anything that amuses him is his game. That's why he sent me down
to talk to you."</p>

<p>"About what I still don't understand?"</p>

<p>"He says the layout you have here in Bentonville ought to be
the sort of show that he would like. He wants to take part in
it."</p>

<p>"Oh, he does, does he?" said Jimmy Carson. His eyes squinted
to points of light. Then he demanded, "I'm to ask him in, am
I?"</p>

<p>"That's the idea," said Ever.</p>

<p>"Well, it's a bright idea," said Carson Jimmy.</p>

<p>"It's one of the brightest that I ever heard. This bird hooks
in from the outside and prongs into my business. I just ask him
in, out of a clear sky. That's all there is to it, eh?"</p>

<p>"Then he puts his shoulder to the wheel and makes things hum
for you," suggested young Winton.</p>

<p>"Oh, he makes things hum, does he?" snarled Carson.</p>

<p>"He does. He's the sort of a fellow who can, too." "And
suppose I tell him I don't want him with me?"</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter much to him," answered Winton. "It's just
that he wants a hand in the game. Hell go with you, if he
can&mdash;and if he can't, he'll go against you. Understand?"</p>

<p>Jimmy Carson rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"I'm trying to understand," said he. "This bohunk of a Pole of
a Scandinavian dishwasher of a Timberline&mdash;he says that if
he can't be for me, he'll be against me, eh?"</p>

<p>"That's the main idea," said Ever.</p>

<p>"Blackmail, or I'm damned!" exclaimed Carson, with virtuous
indignation. "I never heard of anything like it in my whole
life."</p>

<p>"Neither have I," answered Ever frankly.</p>

<p>"He'll be down here with his whole gang, will he?"</p>

<p>"Either on your side or to enforce law and order," said
Winton.</p>

<p>"He'll enforce law and order, will he?" said the little man,
fairly grinding his teeth.</p>

<p>"That's the idea."</p>

<p>"Tell him he can be damned&mdash;and all of his men along with
him, the blackmailing, double-crossing hound!"</p>

<p>"He never double-crosses," said Winton. "He's just telling you
before-hand what he'll do and which side he'll be on. That's
square."</p>

<p>"He wants a flat lump for pulling out, eh?" snarled Carson.
"Well, just for curiosity, you tell me how much he wants on the
nail to buy him off."</p>

<p>Winton said, with real conviction, "You couldn't buy him off
with a million. It's not the money that he's after&mdash;not so
much that, anyway. It's the game that he likes."</p>

<p>"Tell that to Sweeney!" said Carson Jimmy. I ain't that much
of a fool to believe that kind of rot."</p>

<p>"All right," said Winton.</p>

<p>"He'll be down here with his gang, then. And you're one of his
men?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. I'm just the roustabout," said Winton.</p>

<p>Carson Jimmy grinned.</p>

<p>"I like 'em young, and I like 'em modest. Tell me, kid, can
you sling a gun half as good as you can make your hands
talk?"</p>

<p>"You mean, can I use a Colt?"</p>

<p>"That's all I mean to say."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Ever. "I've only shot at a man once."</p>

<p>"Oh, only once, eh? Just beginnin' to pick up seeds, are you?
Well, the point is, did you hit him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"So he stayed down?"</p>

<p>"So that he stopped shooting back, anyway."</p>

<p>Carson Jimmy laughed and twisted himself first to one side of
the chair and then to the other.</p>

<p>"Something about you that I sort of take to, kid," said
he.</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>"The fact is," went on Jimmy, I could always use a good man
with my crowd&mdash;and I could take you in, maybe."</p>

<p>"You couldn't," answered Ever. "I stay where I am."</p>

<p>"Roustabouting, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, roustabouting."</p>

<p>The good nature faded out of the small, narrow face of Carson
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do," said he. "I'll make a deal with
you for that stallion you ride around. I'll make you a deal for
fifteen hundred flat. Don't tell me you'd be fool enough to turn
me down on that. I'm a complete fool to make the bid. But I kind
of like to think of a little runt like me sittin' up there on the
back of that big whale&mdash;that big red whale! Fifteen hundred
right on the nail, boy. You'll never get another offer like
that!"</p>

<p>"It's too late," said Winton. "I've made my deal already. I
can't give up that horse. I may need him, one of these days, to
run away from you and your crowd."</p>

<p>Jimmy Carson stared&mdash;then broke into a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>"That's all right, too!" said he. "But get out of here, lad,
before I change my mind about you. I'm good-natured now, but I
can feel something comin' up inside me. Get along&mdash;and watch
your step. Fargo and Buck may wanta talk to you before you get
clear of town."</p>

<p>He crossed the floor with Winton.</p>

<p>"I'll watch my step, and thanks," said Ever.</p>

<p>"About Timberline&mdash;I'd welcome him down," said Carson
Jimmy. "There ain't been any town marshals in Bentonville that
have held down the job more'n a coupla days at a time. And
besides, me and the boys need exercise."</p>

<p>"Timberline will be glad to hear that," said Ever.</p>

<p>He stepped out into the hall, waved his hand, and walked
rapidly into its gloom.</p>

<p>At the next corner he almost ran into Dolly Gray, running up
the steps. She paused and nodded to him.</p>

<p>"Did you put that lump on Fargo's jaw?" she asked. "Did you
skin up big Buck Waters's face for him?"</p>

<p>"What's happened to them?" he asked, vaguely.</p>

<p>"Well," said the girl, half smiling, I don't suppose you
know." She hurried past him and started down the hall, calling
over her shoulder, "Getting any more uncles out of
jail&mdash;Bill?"</p>

<p>He had headed toward the stairs, but now he stopped short and
whirled around, to find that she had hardly taken three steps and
was standing there poised, to look back at him.</p>

<p>"What's the idea of saying that?" he asked her.</p>

<p>"I went out to the stable to see that red horse," she said.
"And I've seen the Red Pacer before, on the open range. Nobody
ever forgets him&mdash;Bill."</p>

<p>She smiled faintly as she used the false name.</p>

<p>"You spotted me through the horse?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Of course. We get the newspapers even in Bentonville, though
most people never read 'em. But one of the three men, after the
jail-break, got away on the Red Pacer. Other people will be
recognizing you before long, if that's what you're asking."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about a jail-break, no matter what
horse I'm riding now."</p>

<p>"As far as I'm concerned," she said, "don't worry. I have a
couple of uncles of my own that won't stand without tying.
Besides, this place keeps me too busy to let me do much
talking."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said he, and as he said it he looked deep into his
future&mdash;for he thought he was seeing it in the green of her
eyes. "Can you tell me where I'll find the town marshal?" he
asked at last.</p>

<p>"In bed," she answered. "Down the street to the second corner
on your left, second house on the left. If you want to call it a
house. That's where he's trying to get well."</p>

<p>"Did Carson do that to him?"</p>

<p>"Nobody in Bentonville knows anything about it," she
answered.</p>

<p>In the phrase that Carson Jimmy loved, he replied, "That's all
right, too!"</p>

<p>And he went down the stairs and through the lobby to the
street. Hardly ten steps were needed as he crossed that room, but
he used his eyes enough to realize that he had become a marked
man in town.</p>

<p>People turned their heads suddenly and stared at him; he felt
their eyes. Stepping out onto the street, he remembered that,
after all, the partitions in the Sentinel Hotel were not of the
thickest.</p>

<p>He was a marked man. Being already marked, how long would it
take Bentonville to learn about him all that the girl, for
instance, knew? Perhaps it was simply that she had put things
together more deftly than most. The red stallion had helped her,
no doubt, to identify its rider. Perhaps that fellow who had seen
him pass through the shaft of lamp-light, the other night, had
been able to identify both horse and rider.</p>

<p>With long strides, he went down the street in the direction
the girl had indicated. The future would have to take care of
itself. In the meantime, he must keep his wits about him. Two
such men as Buck and Fargo represented a world of enmity. As he
walked, he turned his head now a little to this side, now a
little to that. Wonderful how wide a range the eye can cover,
when a man cares to use the very corners for purposes of
observation. It was almost like having eyes in the back of his
head. And still, as he stepped along, he felt that the murmur
from the lobby of the hotel was following him. He knew that two
or three men had stopped and turned to look at him with great
curiosity.</p>

<p>He turned the corner to the left, and stopped at the second
house. It was a make-shift of tent-cloth, tin cans, boxes, and
logs, with a brush thatching for a roof. There was at least a
sort of door. He rapped at it and a woman's voice called out:</p>

<p>"Who's there?"</p>

<p>"Friend," said Ever.</p>

<p>The door was pulled open a few inches, and he saw the broad
outlines of a woman's face in the shadow.</p>

<p>"Know this gent, Danny?" she remarked.</p>

<p>"Never seen him," said a weary voice.</p>

<p>"Came down to see you from Timberline," said Ever.</p>

<p>"Aw, let him in, ma, will you?" said the man's voice.</p>

<p>The door was pulled wide open and, together with a shaft of
sunshine, he stepped into an irregularly shaped room with a dirt
floor. There was a cot in one corner, upon which the wounded man
was stretched. His face was lost behind a cloud of unshaven red
hair, so that it appeared swollen and nebulous. One had to search
for his features, except the eyes and the forehead.</p>

<p>"Who are you, and what's the crooked news from Timberline?"
asked the man on the cot.</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch29" name="ch29"></a>XXIX. &mdash; HAVING IT OUT</h2>

<p class="first">"MY name is Bill Smith," said Ever.</p>

<p>"Well, well, well!" murmured the deputy marshal. "And all the
time I was taking you to be John Jones! Shows the way that a
man's memory'll go back on him. I'm Dan West. What you want with
me, brother?"</p>

<p>"I'm from Timberline," said Winton. "He told me to come here
and look up the town marshal."</p>

<p>"I'm all that's left of him," said Dan West.</p>

<p>"Don't be wastin' your strength makin' jokes, Danny," advised
his wife, curtly. "They ain't funny, either."</p>

<p>"Timberline," went on Ever, "thought that there might be quite
a crowd in the town, and that Carson Jimmy was likely to be the
larger half of the crowd."</p>

<p>"Timberline is a bright feller," said the marshal. "What else
does he think?"</p>

<p>"He wonders if you need a few deputies to quiet down the town?
He'd like to be the first deputy himself."</p>

<p>The other shook his head.</p>

<p>"It's a mighty fine idea&mdash;mostly," he said, "but not
here. Timberline's got a big name for himself by quietin' down
some little circuses along the range, but he never ran into any
circus like this here one. Never in his life. They'd get
Timberline by the nape of the neck and pull him apart in no
time."</p>

<p>"That would be his gamble," said Ever. "Do you want him
in?"</p>

<p>"Want him in?" exclaimed Mrs. West. "Who would we better want
in, I'd like to know? Guns are all that can talk to
guns&mdash;and the cowardly, man-killin' hounds that fill up this
town, beginnin' with Fargo and Jimmy Carson and"</p>

<p>"You've said enough, ma!" suggested her husband, gently.</p>

<p>She was instantly silent. She began to stare with some
apprehension toward the visitor.</p>

<p>"That's all," said Ever. "If you'll have Timberline with you,
he'll come."</p>

<p>"Mind you," said Town Marshal West, heaving himself suddenly
up on one elbow, "I'll have him if the game goes straight. They
tell some stories about him that ain't any fairy tales for the
young, the way I remember 'em. Understand? I'll have him if he'll
play straight with me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, hell play straight as a string. The mopping up of Mr.
Carson Jimmy is what he's most interested in. So long,
marshal!"</p>

<p>"So long&mdash;Bill Smith," said the marshal, grinning
faintly.</p>

<p>Ever left the hovel and returned to the hotel stable.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon and there was not much of the
daylight left to him.</p>

<p>But he judged that he could ride the stallion back to the
mountain camp by midnight.</p>

<p>In the hotel stable he saddled the horse, led him out to water
at the trough, bridled him, and mounted. A stable boy leaned on
the edge of the trough and looked down at the reflection of the
drinking horse and then up to the dusty reality.</p>

<p>"Say, chief," he remarked, "that ain't the Red Pacer, is it?"
He spoke in a confidential murmur.</p>

<p>A little chill of apprehension ran up Everard Winton's spine.
Two people in the town had spotted the horse already; how much
was known about the rider? He merely answered:</p>

<p>"The Pacer's a man-killer, isn't he, son? And this is a pet
horse. So long!"</p>

<p>He waved and then sent the Pacer off, not at that smooth,
ground-devouring gait which might be a tell-tale, but at a
gallop.</p>

<p>Earlier on the morning of that same day, and a scant hour
after Ever had started downward through the mountain mists, Clay
Winton had come striding back into Timberline's camp with a long
and weighty line of fish.</p>

<p>"Ever!" he sang out. "Oh, Ever! Give me a hand cleaning
these"</p>

<p>"Ever's out on a job for me," said Timberline.</p>

<p>"He's what?" snapped Winton, jerking back his head.</p>

<p>"He out riding for me," repeated Timberline.</p>

<p>The fish slithered into a shining heap upon the pine-needles,
with a motion like that of life.</p>

<p>"Where'd you send him, Timber?" demanded the uncle.</p>

<p>"Why," said Timberline, "you know how it is, Clay. We can't
have two bosses in any one camp. I mostly run this outfit to suit
myself."</p>

<p>Big Al looked up with a satisfied but faint grin on his
face&mdash;satisfied because he enjoyed any prospect of trouble
between others, and faint because he did not wish to call to
himself the attention of either of these formidable men.</p>

<p>"You run any outfit okay&mdash;any outfit that'll have you for
its boss" suggested Winton, "but you don't run that boy down hill
where you and me and the rest have gone, Timberline!"</p>

<p>"What I do with him is my own business," declared
Timberline.</p>

<p>He was perfectly calm, and while he talked he continued to
break up small brushwood, preparing it for the fire. It was dry,
and fed in small bits it would make little or no smoke when they
wished to cook.</p>

<p>"I guess the time's come," said Clay Winton, finally.</p>

<p>"For what?" asked Timberline.</p>

<p>"It's you to run him to hell&mdash;or me to stop you," said
Clay Winton.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>

<p>Timberline dropped the brushwood from his hands and turned
fairly about.</p>

<p>"You done me a good turn, Timber," said Clay Winton. "You
helped me out of jail&mdash;and that was a part of the price that
bought in Ever."</p>

<p>"The kid?" said Timberline, a sudden sneer crossing and
distorting his face. "Why, I picked him up for the price of a
horse. He was cheap enough to come by."</p>

<p>He had been speaking gently before this, but now the devil
jumped from his brain into his face and left him glaring, hunting
the mischief that he would otherwise have avoided.</p>

<p>"He was cheap, was he?" said the uncle.</p>

<p>I said it&mdash;cheap," said Timberline. "I say it
again&mdash;cheap! Like all the
Wintons&mdash;cheap&mdash;cheap&mdash;cheap! What about it?"</p>

<p>"What about it? Why, nothing much, except that one of us has
to die right now, Timber." Quietly.</p>

<p>"Maybe. I'm ready, Clay. I'm sick of your damned mooning
around about that kid. What is he, anyway? What about him? To
hell with him&mdash;and with the rest of the Wintons! I'm sorry I
put myself out to get him, but now that I have him I'll keep him.
I'll use him for the dirtiest jobs I know. Understand?"</p>

<p>"Why," said Clay Winton, "I understand perfectly. Are you
ready to shoot, Timber?"</p>

<p>"I'm ready&mdash;and past ready."</p>

<p>"Just stand up and let a handkerchief drop for us, will you,
Al?" said Clay, softly.</p>

<p>"How about it, chief?" asked Al.</p>

<p>"Sure. Do what he says," said Timberline. "If he gets me
you'll be kissing his foot, the same way you've been kissing
mine. So you might as well do what he tells you to do."</p>

<p>Al, without protest against these insults, stood up and drew
out a bandanna from his trousers pocket.</p>

<p>"Ready?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Ready!" the two answered.</p>

<p>"Wait just a minute. Here's Garry," said Al. "He'd die if he
didn't have a chance to see it. Hey, Garry&mdash;they're gonna
have it out about the kid."</p>

<p>"Hai!" shouted Garry, and stood at the edge of the trees,
frozen with excitement and joy.</p>

<p>"I count to three, and a little later I drop the bandanna,"
said Al, and a grin now convulsed his face. His eyes shone; his
nostrils were dilated.</p>

<p>"All right," agreed the two.</p>

<p>They stood on the balls of their feet as though about to jump
at one another; their arms hung loosely at their sides, though
their hands were empty.</p>

<p>"One&mdash;two&mdash;three," counted Al.</p>

<p>The handkerchief fluttered down.</p>

<p>Before it had struck the ground, two guns exploded.
Timberline's hat jumped from his head. Clay Winton spun around
and dropped on his face.</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch30" name="ch30"></a>XXX. &mdash; NO WINTON DIES
ALONE</h2>

<p class="first">WITH his left hand, Timberline brushed the hair
of his head.</p>

<p>"Take a look at him, Al," said he.</p>

<p>"Better give him another slug, chief," suggested Al. "He
nearly brained you with that one."</p>

<p>"He might have got me, if he'd tried for the body. But the
Wintons always play the long chances," said Timberline. "Do what
I tell you. Pick him up!"</p>

<p>But Clay was already turning and lifting himself on one elbow.
He sat up and faced Timberline.</p>

<p>"You'd better finish the job, Timber," said he. "If you don't
I'll do you in one of these days."</p>

<p>"That's a right&mdash;when the time comes," said Timberline.
"Are you badly smashed?"</p>

<p>"Glanced off the ribs and up the left shoulder, that's all,"
said Clay.</p>

<p>"Look here, Winton, you're as good as dead, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. I'm dead," said Clay, fearlessly regarding the gun in
Timberline's hand.</p>

<p>"Then play dead when Ever comes back to camp, will you?" asked
Timberline. "Keep your hands off him. I could tag you out and
make sure of you now, but I don't like that sort of a game. Will
you keep your hands off the boy when he comes here to camp?"</p>

<p>Clay hesitated. "Well, I'm as good as dead," he said, "and
dead men don't talk. Only&mdash;Timberline, what's the line that
you're wanting him to follow?"</p>

<p>"Nothing that I wouldn't do myself."</p>

<p>Clay made a wry face, but nodded.</p>

<p>"Beggars can't be choosers," said he. "I'll keep my hands
off."</p>

<p>"You had a gun accident," remarked Timberline. "That'll be the
story."</p>

<p>"That's it," agreed Winton. I was cleaning a gun and forgot
one chamber. I'm always warning him about that."</p>

<p>"You fan your gun. Does the kid do the same?" asked
Timberline.</p>

<p>"He does the same&mdash;but he's a lot faster," said Clay
Winton.</p>

<p>"And straighter?" asked Timberline, almost anxiously.</p>

<p>"No, not straighter," admitted Winton, honestly. "But straight
enough. Not every fool plays for the head."</p>

<p>"You're right," said Timberline. "Now let's have a look at
that wound and try to patch it up."</p>

<p>All of this had happened before Ever returned to the camp that
night. He rolled into his blankets, awakening in the morning
without a hint that anything had gone wrong. His uncle he found
propped up in blankets near the fire, looking haggard, and with a
bandage wrapped around his left shoulder and arm.</p>

<p>"Hello, Uncle Clay!" he said, quietly, for the others were not
yet up. "What's happened?"</p>

<p>"Made a fool of myself cleaning a gun, that's all," said his
uncle. "Remember what I've told you about bein' careful? Here's a
lesson for mean old fool. Don't you ever be a young fool,
Ever."</p>

<p>"How did it happen?"</p>

<p>"Cleaning the gun, I tell you. Forgot one chamber. Don't ask
me any more about it. I'm tired of thinking about it. The bullet
scraped my ribs, and I'm lucky to be here talkin' to you. Give me
a drink of water, Ever."</p>

<p>The others in the camp, at breakfast time, worked perfectly
together in backing up the story of the cleaning accident. Al
told a complicated yarn about a cousin of his and a tragedy he'd
had with a shotgun while climbing through a fence. One leg was so
damaged that it had to be cut off, on that occasion.</p>

<p>It was not till after breakfast that Timberline asked for
Ever's report from Bentonville. Ever gave it to him briefly.</p>

<p>"I took a room in the hotel. It's still mine. I saw the girl.
She's hard-boiled, but she's all right. She spotted the Pacer and
me. It may have been guesswork. I tried to see Carson Jimmy, and
he slammed the door in my face. But he'd seen the horse in the
stable and he tried to get it out of me. That brought me back
into his room. I had a fracas with a couple of his
friends&mdash;Fargo and Buck Waters&mdash;and after they went out
he was willing to talk. He wanted to buy the horse, but he
couldn't have that. And then he said for you to go to the devil
with your ideas. I went to see the town marshal next. He's in
bed, laid up with a gunshot wound. He'll be glad to have you come
in and talk business with him."</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>"That all?" asked Timberline.</p>

<p>"That's all."</p>

<p>"It's a good deal, for half a day's work or less. When did you
get back here to camp?"</p>

<p>"Midnight."</p>

<p>Timberline's pleasure shone for an instant in his eyes.</p>

<p>"What happened with Fargo and Buck Waters?" he asked. "I know
those fellows. They're among Jimmy's best."</p>

<p>"We had a fracas," said Ever. "Carson told them to throw me
out. I had the luck and stayed. He had Fargo carry Buck out of
the room."</p>

<p>"Did he need to be carried?"</p>

<p>"He stumbled after I hit him, and the floor bumped his head
and finished the job."</p>

<p>Timberline smiled again.</p>

<p>"What did you think of the day?"</p>

<p>Ever looked swiftly up to the sky and narrowed his eyes.</p>

<p>"The best day I've ever had in my life," he decided.</p>

<p>"You told Dolly Gray what I told you to tell her?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What did she say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Not a word?"</p>

<p>"No. It was just as though I had read something out of a
newspaper."</p>

<p>Timberline no longer smiled.</p>

<p>"How did she look?" he inquired, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Busy."</p>

<p>"Loosen up, Ever," said the leader. "Tell me some more about
her."</p>

<p>Ever hesitated.</p>

<p>"There's nothing much to tell you," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, there is. Dolly Gray is always worth a little
conversation."</p>

<p>Said Ever, "I'll tell you one thing&mdash;if you don't
mind."</p>

<p>"Tell me anything you've got on your mind."</p>

<p>"The next time you've got a message for her, send somebody
else."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather talk to her about myself than about you."</p>

<p>Timberline started. Then, looking Ever up and down, he
chuckled.</p>

<p>"You like her pretty well, eh?" said he.</p>

<p>"I like her too well," said Ever.</p>

<p>"It's all right," said Timberline. "We don't have to start
shooting for her until she says the word. I haven't a label on
her. She's not mine&mdash;just yet."</p>

<p>"She's a long way from that, it seemed to me," agreed Everard
Winton.</p>

<p>"It seemed to you, did it?" asked Timberline, rather
sharply.</p>

<p>"That's what I thought."</p>

<p>"All right. Saddle the Pacer. We're starting for town right
away&mdash;you and Al and I. Garry will stay up here with your
uncle."</p>

<p>Timberline went over to Clay Winton as the others made their
preparations.</p>

<p>"You heard him talk?" said he.</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard."</p>

<p>"Well, what did you think?"</p>

<p>"I thought he'd put ten years on his back in one day."</p>

<p>"He's grown up overnight," said the leader. "And he'll grow up
a lot more before I've had him much longer. Whatever I make of
him, he'll be a man."</p>

<p>"What sort of a man?" said his uncle. He sighed, and stirred
in his blankets uneasily. He went on, "Now&mdash;when I'm needed
as he never needed me before&mdash;I have to lie here like a
fool! Listen to me, Timberline. Do your best by him. No Winton
ever dies alone; he pulls down others with him!"</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch31" name="ch31"></a>XXXI. &mdash; TO UPHOLD THE
LAW</h2>

<p class="first">IT was late afternoon when they got to
Bentonville and moved down the main street abreast. It was the
sleepiest time of the day, and few people were in the street. But
after they had passed along several blocks, Timberline said
calmly to the men with him:</p>

<p>"That was Buck Waters' face in the second-story window, back
there. He had one good look at us and faded. You don't need to be
surprised, boys, if things start moving around here before long.
We'll get to the town marshal as fast as we can.</p>

<p>Straight to the house of Marshal Danny West they went. Mrs.
West actually grinned with pleasure when she saw Timberline.</p>

<p>"We kind of didn't believe the young feller, yesterday," said
she. "But here you are as big as life, Timberline&mdash;and
bigger, too. I never was gladder to see anybody in all my born
days!"</p>

<p>She ushered the three into the room of the wounded man, and
West looked them over with a somber eye of pleasure.</p>

<p>"It's straight, then, Timber, is it?" West demanded. "You
gonna take a hand now in cleanin' up this place?"</p>

<p>"We're going to take a hand," agreed Timberline. "If you want
us, that is."</p>

<p>"Am I a fool?" countered the other. "Of course I want
you&mdash;and want you bad. Gonna be deputies? All three?"</p>

<p>"That's the idea, Danny."</p>

<p>"Good!" said the town marshal. "I'm glad to have you all. I
hope you've got some more men, too, up your sleeve?"</p>

<p>"Why, Danny," said Timberline, "this isn't a war. It's only a
town fight. Isn't that the idea?"</p>

<p>"You'll think it's a war before you're through with Carson
Jimmy," said the marshal. "He's more poison than ever, and he's
got all the thugs of Bentonville in the palm of his hand, I mean
to say."</p>

<p>"They all follow him, eh?"</p>

<p>"They love his shadow on the ground, you'd think," said Danny
West. "The little devil is faster and straighter with a gun than
he ever was before, too."</p>

<p>"Is that what they say?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm in bed, ain't I?"</p>

<p>"Did he do that to you?"</p>

<p>"Nobody but little Carson Jim himself! Oh, he's a beauty, he
is. He could of killed me, but he didn't want to. As I lay there
on the ground he says to me: 'I don't want to be killing any more
fools like you, brother,' says he. 'You keep just enough alive to
hold down the job and don't swear in any more deputies. I'm tired
of killin' deputies.' That's what he says to me, damn him!"</p>

<p>"Have you sworn in any more lately?"</p>

<p>"There were four town marshals in three weeks," said West,
dolefully. I was the last. Nobody wants to be sworn in as acting
marshal, with me laid up. They seem to be against it,
somehow."</p>

<p>He made a wry face.</p>

<p>"Where's the book?" asked Timberline. "Swear us in, brother.
And hand out the badges."</p>

<p>"There's only one thing," said the town marshal.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"There's a sort of a whisper and a rumor goin' around the town
that Smith there, ain't Bill Smith at all. That he's young
Everard Winton that the law wants so bad!"</p>

<p>"Why, Danny," said Timberline, "don't you believe that he's
Bill Smith?"</p>

<p>"He's anything that you call him, Timber," said the other,
chuckling. "Far as I'm concerned, he can be the devil&mdash;so
long as he takes a whack at Carson Jimmy for me. Only&mdash;they
say that the county sheriff has heard about him callin' in
Bentonville, and that the sheriff may be headin' over this way. I
dunno what it all means, and I don't care. I'm just tellin'
you."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Timberline. "We'll take care of ourselves. Now
we want those badges, Danny."</p>

<p>It was a brief ceremony, and perhaps the words hardly lodged
in the ears of any of the others as they did in Ever's mind as he
found himself promising to uphold the law at the risk of his
life, to enforce the commands of his superiors, and to be
fearless in the performance of his duty.</p>

<p>Then the badges were distributed, and in each instance they
were pinned inside the lapel of the coats.</p>

<p>When that was done, Timberline drew himself up with a sigh of
relief. "Is that all, Danny?" said he.</p>

<p>"That's all," said the town marshal. "Timber, you know you're
steppin' in as deep as your neck?"</p>

<p>"I've heard of Jimmy Carson for years," said Timberline.
"Always heard good things about him&mdash;straight with a gun and
crooked with his tongue. He's lied his way out of more tight
places than any other man in the country. And where lying
wouldn't do, he's shot his way through. Isn't that right?"</p>

<p>"That's right," said the marshal, shaking his head with a
sigh.</p>

<p>"Very well, then. I wouldn't be anywhere in the world except
right here in Bentonville, playing the game with him. So long,
Danny. Wish us luck!"</p>

<p>They went out in the blaze of the sunshine.</p>

<p>"Now, boys," said Timberline, "we've been spotted. There's no
doubt about that. Jimmy Carson is ready. Buck has told him we're
here. We've probably been shadowed to the marshal's shack, and
Carson will know perfectly well what that means. We have our work
cut out for us. We're three men, and he has thirty, probably. The
town is afraid to stand out against him.</p>

<p>"That all means that you boys will have to watch yourselves.
Carson is a spider that has sucked the blood out of bigger wasps
than we are, and thrown the empty hulls out of his trap. Now,
then, mind yourselves&mdash;and step lively!</p>

<p>"Al, you look into the Second Chance saloon, over there. See
what you see and listen to what you can hear. I'm going down
there to the Bill Laforge saloon and do the same. Ever, you've
got the worst job of the three. They may be gunning for us, back
there at the hotel; but you go and try the trap and see what it's
like. There's trouble in the air, so watch yourself. Guns will be
gossiping before night, or I'm a liar. If you have to shoot
straight shoot to kill. You're an officer of the law just
now."</p>

<p>He chuckled a little as he said this, and then turned and
hurried off down the street, accompanied by Al, stepping large
and long beside him.</p>

<p>Everard Winton went back to the hotel. He did not need the
warning of his leader that every step he made in the town was
highly dangerous now. And as he rode along he kept turning his
eyes a little from side to side, as he had learned to do the day
before. If danger came at him undetected, it would have to spring
from the very ground at his feet, he felt.</p>

<p>One block was protected from the sun by what appeared like a
semi-arcade; that is, the roofs of the buildings extended over
the sidewalk like an awning, and made a dim tunnel of shade. The
very brilliance of the day made that shadow all the deeper.</p>

<p>To sharpen his nerves the more Ever was aware of many eyes
resting keenly upon him. From every side, men were walking more
rapidly to keep up with him, or were slowing down to see him
pass. It was the beginning of the gathering of a crowd.</p>

<p>Only in one place was there quiet. That was in front of Dick
Borrow's saloon and gambling house. Only a day or so before a
brake had been discovered on Borrow's roulette wheel. And though
the people of the West, and particularly those of a mining camp,
are of a forgiving and a forgetting nature, it was too soon for
them to forget that brake. They could surmise that the other
gambling institutions were as crooked as this one of Borrow's;
nevertheless they were keeping away from his place for the time
being. As a result, Borrow had been forced to throw all the blame
on his best dealer, fire the man publicly&mdash;and bribe him
privately&mdash;and lower the price of his drinks. Business would
return, but this was an interim. Hence, in place of the usual
roaring crowd at this time of the day, there was only a group of
a dozen or so in Borrow's when one of the lot, clad in a short
cotton dust-coat, disengaged himself from the others and looked
for an instant thoughtfully toward the back door of the
place.</p>

<p>At that back door another man had appeared for an instant,
waved an arm, and disappeared.</p>

<p>He of the dust-coat set his teeth, after the single look
backward, and then he glanced toward the rather lofty tent roof,
as though for further confirmation. That roof was one of Borrow's
main attractions, for the height of the ceiling promised a
superior coolness.</p>

<p>Shrugging his shoulders, the man in the dust-coat walked
straight to the swinging doors, thrust them open. He stepped out
and quickly to the side. Straight before him was the Red
Pacer.</p>

<p>Tossing his coat open, the fellow whipped a sawed-off shotgun
to his shoulder and leveled it to fire.</p>

<p>It was quickly done, but from the instant he stepped through
the saloon door, he had been spotted by Ever, and no shotgun can
be maneuvered with the speed of a revolver.</p>

<p>As the dust-coat was thrown open, revealing the shotgun
hanging by an ample leather noose from the stranger's neck, Ever
went for his Colt, jerked it from the spring slip beneath his
left arm, and fired, hip high.</p>

<p>Both barrels of the shotgun roared in reply. The double charge
sang in the air, high about Ever's head, and the gunman turned
with a yelp of pain and sprinted back through the swinging door,
peeling off the dust-coat as he ran through the doors. His
frightened cry rang behind him.</p>

<p>To have gone after him on foot would have been the natural
thing&mdash;if one cared to chase a poisonous rat such as he into
his underground den&mdash;but Ever did not dismount. Instead, he
turned the stallion and sent him plunging in pursuit. Under the
awning they shot, and lying out along the side of the horse, his
arm stretched well to the front, beyond the head of the stallion,
Ever dashed open the swinging doors. The Pacer lowered his crest,
and into the saloon itself they ran!</p>

<p>He of the shotgun had dodged through the group of men inside
and started at a reasonable pace for the back entrance. The yell
of the others told him that something extraordinary had
happened.</p>

<p>Turning his head, he saw the monstrous apparition of the Pacer
and its rider, heard the wooden floor giving up thunder as the
armed hoofs struck it, and whirling again, with a screech, he
flew for his life.</p>

<p>But he was far too slow to escape that red thunderbolt. The
shadow of the danger fell upon him. He turned with a wild cry, a
knife in his hand and his face contorted with desperation. Ever
laid the barrel of his Colt along the other's head, shot past
him, and dropped to the floor as he checked his stallion. Then he
returned to his quarry.</p>

<p>The whole business had taken perhaps four seconds, and the
staring men in the saloon merely had a glimpse of a very scared
man being lifted in strong arms and flung rudely over the saddle,
after which the Pacer, carrying that senseless burden, was led
out to the street.</p>

<p>The crowd was gathering fast. Strange things had happened in
Bentonville before this, but none quite so strange as a horseman
pursuing a criminal into a saloon.</p>

<p>Half the crowd rushed into Borrows place to make sure of what
had happened inside, and they were shown by the delighted Borrow
the marks of the hoofs on the floor, and the long, black grooves
and splintered places where the stallion had checked his
rush.</p>

<p>The other half closely surrounded Ever on his way to the jail
with his victim.</p>

<p>The bullet from the revolver had creased the latter's shoulder
muscles, that was all; and the blood ran slowly down, drop by
drop, into the dust of the road.</p>

<p>Not until they reached the little, squat faade of the jail
did the wounded man recover his senses; and then only to be
walked into captivity.</p>

<p>The jailer opened the door an inch, with a gun in his free
hand.</p>

<p>"What's this?" he growled.</p>

<p>For three times that jail had been rushed, before this day,
and various had been the schemes for getting the front door
open.</p>

<p>"This," said Ever, in a voice that some of the crowd would
remember all the rest of their days, "this is a snake that bites
in the dark. It's a poison snake. Got a place for it in
here?"</p>

<p>"Who are you, anyway?" asked the jailer.</p>

<p>"I? Oh. I'm Deputy Town Marshal Bill Smith," said Ever, "and
here's my badge."</p>

<p>The jailer gazed, blinked, and thrust the door wide. The
prisoner entered. And a loud cheer roared upward from the throats
of those in the street. Perhaps a full half of them were rascals
as black as one could meet in a year's hunt, but no matter what
their profession, they had to applaud law and order when it
arrived in Bentonville in such a form as this.</p>

<p>They scattered, slowly, talking in small groups as they went
off. It seemed, in fact, that a new day might be dawning for the
town.</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch32" name="ch32"></a>XXXII. &mdash; A WORD TO THE
WISE</h2>

<p class="first">EVER remained at the jail long enough to hear
the name of the prisoner he had brought in. It was Sidney
Williams. The jailer already knew him and said to him,
grimly:</p>

<p>"You been due for a tumble for a long time, brother, and now
you gone and collected it. Maybe you'll stay put for a
while."</p>

<p>Sid Williams was a pale-eyed blond whose lack of color made
him seem quite featureless, but there was plenty of expression in
the sneering smile with which he heard this.</p>

<p>"Lemme tell you something, guy," said he to the jailer. "I got
people behind me. I'll be out of here in a coupla days. And when
I am out" here he turned savagely on Winton&mdash;I'm gonna have
your scalp. You hear me talk?"</p>

<p>"When you get out," said Ever, slowly, "you tell your friend
Carson that I'm after him with both hands and no gloves."</p>

<p>He left the jail and went to the stable behind the hotel.</p>

<p>The little freckle-faced stable boy came running out at the
sight of the horse and the rider.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Mr. Winton!" he called.</p>

<p>Ever tapped him on the shoulder as he dismounted. "My name's
Bill Smith," he insisted.</p>

<p>The boy grinned.</p>

<p>"Sure it is," said he. "Your name is anything that you want to
make it, around here. That sneak of a no-good Sid
Williams&mdash;jimminy but I'm glad that you slammed him!"</p>

<p>He went into the hotel. Twenty or thirty loud voices were
instantly stilled, and twenty or thirty pairs of eyes focused
upon him. A tremor of self-consciousness came over him and then
departed. He went to the desk, got the key for his room,
disregarding the broad and welcoming smile of Shorty.</p>

<p>"Where's Dolly Gray?" he asked.</p>

<p>"She's back in her office," said Shorty. "Go and rap."</p>

<p>Ever did as he was told.</p>

<p>"Come in," called the girl.</p>

<p>He entered and shut the door swiftly behind him, stepping away
from it. Bullets can be fired through the thin panel of a wooden
door almost as effectively as through the open air.</p>

<p>"Hello," said he. "Shorty told me to come and give the door a
rap."</p>

<p>She tilted back in her chair and folded her hands behind her
head, as she had done once before.</p>

<p>"Hello, Everard Winton," she said.</p>

<p>"My name's Bill Smith," he insisted.</p>

<p>"Is it?" said she without smiling.</p>

<p>Her glance wandered slowly over him.</p>

<p>"Your name is going to be Dead Man in a few hours, if you want
to know what I think."</p>

<p>"They're after me," said he. "I know that. They nearly tagged
me a few minutes ago."</p>

<p>"Then what brought you here, where they can lay hands on you?"
she asked. "Got another message from Timber?"</p>

<p>"When I give you another message," said he, "it will be from
myself, not from Timberline."</p>

<p>Her green eyes remained entirely grave.</p>

<p>"I won't ask you what you mean by that," she said.</p>

<p>"I wish you would," said he.</p>

<p>"How old are you, Everard?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'm old enough to know the color of your eyes," said he.</p>

<p>"That doesn't mean anything," she answered. "How old are you
in years?"</p>

<p>"I'm on the bright side of thirty, still," said he.</p>

<p>"You're on the bright side of twenty," she suggested.</p>

<p>"You're a mile wrong," said he. "I'm a ton older than you
think. What about yourself?"</p>

<p>"A girl is always ten years older than a man," said she.</p>

<p>"You think you're gray-headed, because you're running this
little hotel," said he.</p>

<p>"You think you're grown up," she answered, "because you tagged
that sneak of a Sid Williams and batted Fargo on the chin. Is
that it?"</p>

<p>"I'm old enough for you, Dolly," said he.</p>

<p>"You're only a baby!" she told him. "But I like children," she
added. "Sit down and rest your mind for a while. You look as
though you'd been thinking quite a lot."</p>

<p>He did not take a chair. He went over to her and sat down on
the edge of the table, watching her face closely.</p>

<p>"Does everybody in town think that I'm Winton?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Everybody knows it," said she.</p>

<p>"And the horse?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Everybody knows that it's the Red Pacer."</p>

<p>"The devil!" said he.</p>

<p>"It used to be a devil&mdash;they say you've tamed it."</p>

<p>"How thick is the air in town&mdash;for me?" he asked her.</p>

<p>"So thick that you'll choke in it if you stay here long."</p>

<p>"I'm a deputy town marshal."</p>

<p>"I've heard about that, too," she said.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" murmured Ever. "Is every bit of news posted in
this place the minute anything happens?"</p>

<p>"We have underground wires," replied the girl. "And it's not
far from here to the jail.You showed your badge to a couple of
hundred men."</p>

<p>He sighed and then frowned.</p>

<p>"I'm going up to my room," said he.</p>

<p>"Remember one thing," remarked the girl.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Outside of the town police, there's a county sheriff in this
part of the world."</p>

<p>"Is there?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Has he been around?"</p>

<p>"You never can tell where he'll be. He generally comes where
he's most wanted."</p>

<p>"I don't want him," said Winton.</p>

<p>"Sure you don't," she smiled. "But you've made yourself an
outstanding case."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"Well, fellows don't pry their uncles out of jail every day in
the year."</p>

<p>"I wasn't alone there," said he. "All I did"</p>

<p>He paused, with a deprecatory gesture.</p>

<p>Said the girl, "All you did was to shoot the jailer and then
jump out through a hole in the wall. I know all that you
did."</p>

<p>"Who's the popular boy you call the sheriff?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Rance McDonald is all he's called," said she.</p>

<p>She waited, as if sure of getting a strong reaction.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"I never heard of him, Dolly," said he.</p>

<p>I knew you were young," said she, "but I didn't think you were
that young. Around this part of the world the kids learn about
Rance McDonald before they know their A.B.C.'s."</p>

<p>"Study was always hard for me," he answered. "Well, I'm going
upstairs. So long, Dolly."</p>

<p>"You'd better say good-by," she replied, tartly. "I don't
expect to see you again."</p>

<p>"Is Carson in?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You'd like to call on him, I suppose?" said she, staring.</p>

<p>"I might leave a card," said he.</p>

<p>"Don't be foolish," Dolly Gray pleaded. "You're a good hand,
Everard, but you're not good enough to handle that glass of
poison."</p>

<p>"Thanks." He went to the door.</p>

<p>"Leave Carson alone, will you?"</p>

<p>"Say, 'please,'" said he, grinning.</p>

<p>"Oh, run along!" she replied. "You ought to be in
kindergarten!"</p>

<p>He went out into the hall, looked swiftly and carefully about
him&mdash;for guns might appear in the shadows of any
corner&mdash;and then went up the stairs to his room.</p>

<p>He opened the door with care equal to that which he had used
in climbing the stairs; and as he burst the door wide, he saw the
form of a man seated in a chair.</p>

<p>A gun was in Ever's hand, instantly, as he sprang back. But
then he saw that this was old Harry Lawson, his arms folded, his
head lying over on one shoulder, sound asleep.</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch33" name="ch33"></a>XXXIII. &mdash; INDIAN
BRAINS</h2>

<p class="first">HE closed the door and touched the shoulder of
the half-breed. Harry Lawson awakened.</p>

<p>"Hello, Harry," said Ever.</p>

<p>The half-breed grunted, inclined his head forward on his
chest, and went to sleep again.</p>

<p>Ever stepped to the window and looked out and down the street.
He was spotted almost instantly by a dozen people. Hands were
pointed towards him; a little crowd gathered.</p>

<p>Already he had become the object of so much interest to the
people of the town! He smiled a little grimly as he turned back
into the room.</p>

<p>"Hey, Harry!" he called, loudly.</p>

<p>Harry Lawson started up from his chair with a revolver in his
hand. His red-stained eyes blinked at Ever, then he caused the
gun to disappear in his clothes, again. He nodded at Ever.</p>

<p>"Pretty hungry," he declared.</p>

<p>"All right," said Ever, "and you'll have something to eat,
too. What brought you into this part of the world, Harry?"</p>

<p>"I come take the Red Pacer," said the half-breed.</p>

<p>"Oh, do you?" murmured Ever.</p>

<p>He stared at the strange, square face of Harry Lawson.</p>

<p>The latter nodded. He was not smiling.</p>

<p>"You see, Harry," said Ever, "I still want the Pacer."</p>

<p>"Pretty soon you die," said Lawson. "I take the Pacer."</p>

<p>He was quite unmoved in saying this.</p>

<p>"What makes you think I'm going to die, Harry?" asked Ever.
"I've no intention of dying."</p>

<p>Lawson shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Pretty soon you die," said he. "I take the Pacer," Then he
added, "Now we eat?"</p>

<p>Ever had his back toward the door. As he turned toward it, it
swung soundlessly open, and in the dimness, against the hall
twilight, he saw a man standing, covering him with a firmly held
revolver. After the speeches of the half-breed, it was too
pat&mdash;like a sudden effect in a melodrama. He was about to
die, said Lawson, and instantly the man with the gun appeared, as
though to explain the manner in which death would come.</p>

<p>"Just hoist your hands, kid," said the newcomer. "You, too,
Lawson."</p>

<p>Lawson did not "hoist" his hands. Instead, he drew back
against the wall, his face unperturbed, as though to signify by
his withdrawal that he was outside this case and not involved in
the fate of Everard Winton in any way. The stranger paid no more
attention to him; he merely watched the gradual rise of Winton's
hands. Breast-high&mdash;shoulder-high. There they paused and
fluttered and seemed to fight against being lifted further. But
finally they were up to the top of his head. And all the while
his grim eyes kept drilling into the face of the gunman. The
latter said:</p>

<p>"I'm McDonald, the sheriff. I'm arresting you in the name of
the law. I reckon you know what for."</p>

<p>He stepped inside the room, hooked the door shut with a
backward swing of his heel, and then gradually advanced on
Winton.</p>

<p>Slowly Ever said, "You'd better stand where you are, McDonald,
till you tell me what you want me for."</p>

<p>"Don't make a fool of yourself, kid," said the sheriff,
hastily. "I've got you covered. Don't make no funny move. I don't
wanta tag you with no lead, but if you make me shoot, I'll blow
you in two."</p>

<p>"Stop where you are," said Ever. "Or you can have your chance
to start shooting right now!"</p>

<p>The sheriff paused, both amazed and angry.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" he snarled.</p>

<p>He was a true son of the desert&mdash;lean, leather-skinned,
the outer fringes of his hair sun-faded to white. Like the birds
and the animals of the desert, there was nothing to him but skin,
sinew, and bone.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" he repeated, with irritation.
"You don't think you can burglarize a jail and let loose a crook
and shoot up the jailers and get by with it, do you? Turn your
back to me, kid, and then shell out a coupla guns and drop 'em on
the floor. I'm gonna give you a chance to be decent&mdash;but if
you won't take things easy, then take 'em hard. And be damned to
you!"</p>

<p>He stepped forward again.</p>

<p>"One more step and the music starts!" said Ever.</p>

<p>The sheriff halted in the middle of the small, hard-woven
grass mat that covered the center of the floor.</p>

<p>"You think you're gonna get away with anything?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'm not trying to get away with anything," Ever said. "I'm
just trying to make up my mind."</p>

<p>"About what?"</p>

<p>"Whether I want to spend twenty years in jail&mdash;or finish
things off right now."</p>

<p>The sheriff obviously tightened his grip on the handle of his
gun.</p>

<p>"Kid," he said, "I'd sure hate to drill you, but I've got an
idea that you're gonna make me!"</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Ever, his lips barely parting to speak, so hard
set was his jaw. "Twenty years of shade doesn't appeal to me. I
think I'd rather take it now."</p>

<p>"Who said twenty years?" demanded the sheriff, his voice
suddenly changing. "Look here, kid, I'm gonna be rated a skunk if
I come in here and shoot you up. The boys'll say that I done it
out of meanness. They won't believe that anybody'd prefer being
planted in the ground to being planted in prison for a while. But
who said twenty years? It ain't gonna be that long. They'll let
you off with the smallest they can give. You never done anything
wrong before. And what you done wrong was for the sake of your
uncle. Why, the whole range votes for you, son. Maybe a couple
years&mdash;maybe only six months in the can, and the governor'll
pardon you out&mdash;if he wants to get elected for another term
in this here state!"</p>

<p>He spoke gently, rapidly, persuasively, as he put forward
these arguments. Ever's hands had lowered until they were resting
lightly, now, on the lapels of his coat.</p>

<p>"Get those hands up!" commanded the sheriff, in quite a
different voice.</p>

<p>Ever shook his head, slightly, but decisively.</p>

<p>"I won't wear irons!" he said.</p>

<p>Fine, bright sweat stood out all over the sheriff's face.</p>

<p>"Who said anything about irons, kid?" he demanded. "Gimme your
word to do what I say and go where I say, and I'll trust you.
I'll trust you as free as the air. I know that you're a Winton.
Only, for God's sake don't murder yourself by makin' me pull the
trigger of this gun! Don't make no mistake. I ain't the kind that
misses a mark&mdash;not at this here distance."</p>

<p>"So you're going to let me be arrested&mdash;without wearing
the irons?" Ever asked. "That's what I said, and that's what I
mean."</p>

<p>Ever sighed.</p>

<p>"I'd like to give in," said he, "only&mdash;there's something
inside of me that won't let me!"</p>

<p>"Kid, you talk like a fool!" snapped the sheriff.</p>

<p>"Maybe I do. Maybe I am a fool! I'm not acting this way
because I want to. It's only because I have to. Pull that
trigger, McDonald, or take a step forward, and I'll go for my own
gun. I can't give up like a cur before I'm beaten!"</p>

<p>The sheriff looked at him with real agony in his face.</p>

<p>"Why," he muttered, "God A'mighty, settin' right on His
throne, wouldn't know what to do in a pinch like this. You fool
of a half-witted worthless brat, you!" he finished by crying at
Winton. "I'm gonna"</p>

<p>His speech was cut off at this point.</p>

<p>Behind those red-stained eyes, Harry Lawson had slowly been
evolving a thought. He looked down at the rug and up again at the
sheriff. Now he leaned over, rolled the edge of the rug until it
made a comfortable handhold, and jerked back and up with his
whole weight. The rug shot to the side and the sheriff sat down
with jarring force on the naked floor. The gun spun out of his
grasp and slithered away until it came to rest before Winton's
feet.</p>

<p>Ever's own revolver was already out. And the sheriff, giving
his head a shake to clear it, scowled at Harry Lawson.</p>

<p>"You'll get twenty years for this, you damned half-breed!" he
said.</p>

<p>"Maybe so," said Lawson, unimpressed.</p>

<p>The sheriff rose to his feet. He dusted his hands, and his
face was pale.</p>

<p>"You've won this here trick, kid," said he. I was a fool that
I didn't drill you the minute you started actin' up."</p>

<p>Winton nodded. He was as grave and as pale as the sheriff.</p>

<p>"Sit down," the boy invited, "and we'd better talk it
over."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he put away his own weapon and picked up that of
the sheriff, passing it to him, handle first.</p>

<p>The sheriff, a wild gleam in his eye, gripped the recovered
weapon as if he were receiving back his damaged honor, made as
bright and famous as ever before. Then his face went scarlet.</p>

<p>"I'll sit down," he said. "Doggone me if I don't need to sit
down. You got me beat, kid!"</p>

<p>Harry Lawson stepped up and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Gimme money, Ever," said he. "I wanta eat."</p>

<p>A ten-dollar bill was placed in his hand. He left the room at
once, with McDonald's eyes rolling rather wildly after him.</p>

<p>"That fool of a breed has his nerve, ain't he?" asked the
Sheriff.</p>

<p>"He saved my skin for me," answered Everard Winton. "I thought
he was a bad luck prophet, a regular buzzard. But he's turned
into a friend in the pinch. Sheriff, let's see if we can't make a
deal."</p>

<p>"What's in his head?" asked the sheriff.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;not exactly," said Ever. "He doesn't know,
himself, I suppose. But he owned the Red Pacer and now he seems
to think that he owns me. He seems to take it that the Red Pacer
is going to carry me to hell; and it appears that he wants to get
the horse back before I land in the middle of the big fire.
Something like that must be in his head. You can't figure out
exactly what Indian brains are thinking about."</p>

<p class="first">THE sheriff took out tobacco and brown wheat-straw papers. He tore out one of the papers, scowled at Ever,
snapped the little case shut with violence, rolled his cigarette
with a liberal strewing of the thin, golden flakes over the
floor, licked the paper to secure it, and lighted his smoke.</p>

<p>He had not spoken during the whole of this operation.</p>

<p>"You've been and made a fool out of me, Winton," said he. "You
and that breed, damn him!"</p>

<p>He sent up vast volumes of smoke; the coal at the end of the
cigarette was red hot and half an inch long.</p>

<p>"I didn't make a fool out of you," said Ever. "I hadn't
planned anything. I was getting ready to eat lead when Harry
Lawson turned the trick for me. I don't know that you're really
so sorry about it."</p>

<p>"You don't know?" said Rance McDonald, his staring eyes filled
with fury. "When I come into this hotel, I still got the name of
being a man. I walk out again and I got the name of bein' a half-faced bluff that can't take a trick from a twenty-year-old
kid!"</p>

<p>"Does anybody know that you came here to arrest me?" asked
Ever.</p>

<p>"Why, I come in the back way, not advertisin' myself. Maybe I
wasn't seen comin' in. But I'll be seen comin' out."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Ever, "you haven't seen me. That's all.
You've been hunting around in the hotel all this time, trying to
spot my room."</p>

<p>"How d'you mean that?" asked the sheriff.</p>

<p>"I mean what I say. You step out of here with me in front of
you. I run down the stairs like mad. I flash through the lobby as
though wolves were at my heels. I get my horse and ride."</p>

<p>"What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"It means that I've seen you and run for it as fast as I could
go."</p>

<p>The sheriff frowned, then smiled.</p>

<p>"That'd save my face," said he.</p>

<p>"There's no reason why it shouldn't be saved," said Ever. "Any
other man, in your boots, would have dropped me with a slug of
lead long before Harry made his little play."</p>

<p>"The half-breed has probably started telling the world about
what happened, long before this," said the sheriff, darkening
once more.</p>

<p>"Lawson never talks," said Ever. "He never says a word,
particularly about what he's done with his own hands."</p>

<p>"I'd like to believe that," murmured Rance McDonald, more and
more soothed by what he heard.</p>

<p>"You can believe it like the Bible."</p>

<p>"Then I'd better step out," said the sheriff, rising. "Winton,
I'm thanking you for this decent break; and I'm sorry that I'll
have to keep on your trail."</p>

<p>"That's the fortune of war," said the boy. "But I wonder,
McDonald, why you don't go out after fellows like Carson Jimmy,
instead of taking after game like me first."</p>

<p>"Carson Jimmy?" echoed the sheriff, with a start. "Jimmy
Carson? Lord love you! There's nothing in the world that I want
so much as to take a fair crack at him. But it's hard to get
anything against him. He's on the watch. He's a fox&mdash;always.
I know that he's got his hand in every dirty game in Bentonville,
don't I? But I can't get at him. I can't bring it home. He's
surrounded by a ring of thugs a mile deep. You can't wade through
'em."</p>

<p>"He's trying for my scalp now," said Ever.</p>

<p>"Is he?"</p>

<p>"Yes. A fellow named Sid Williams took a shot at me with a
riot gun, a minute ago. I got hold of him and he's in the jail
now. If you put pressure on him, he might talk a little about his
boss, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"No," said the sheriff. I don't think so. There ain't much of
a chance of that. He knows that if he talks, he'll be loaded full
of lead, later on, by some of Jimmy's men. Even if we catch Jimmy
in the meantime. It ain't any use trying to pump the men in
Carson's dirty crew. They stick by their chief. They have to! If
they let go of him they'll be drowned in lead!"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"It's no go!" he declared. "Did Carson send that fellow after
you?"</p>

<p>"He did. There's no doubt of that. Nobody else in town had a
grudge against me."</p>

<p>"The cur!" said the sheriff, in disgust and in anger. "I'd
give ten years off my life&mdash;the best ten&mdash;if I could
lay hands on Carson!"</p>

<p>"Timberline's in town," said Ever, quietly. "He's a deputy
marshal, now."</p>

<p>"I've heard that. Timberline's another I'd like to snag."</p>

<p>"Well, he doesn't shoot from behind," said Ever.</p>

<p>"Aye&mdash;and that's true. He keeps his hands pretty
clean."</p>

<p>"He's here to get Carson, and Carson knows it. It's open war.
Why not work on the side, then, and see what you can do? I'm in
the game with Timberline."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to hear it."</p>

<p>"So am I&mdash;in a way. But that's how I stand. I'm for
Timberline&mdash;and I'm for the law and for you. That may sound
strange, but I mean it."</p>

<p>"Where's your uncle?" asked the sheriff, suddenly.</p>

<p>"You don't want me to answer that," said Ever.</p>

<p>The sheriff flushed. "I wasn't pumpin' you," said he. "I
wouldn't of used the news even if you'd told it to me. I was just
wonderin'. Listen to me!"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps we can play this game together. And if you can hang
anything on Carson I'm the man to go after him. I'll get him or
die tryin'&mdash;if there's anything to get him for."</p>

<p>Ever nodded.</p>

<p>"That sounds good to me," said he. "I'll try to work up
something on Carson, then you and Timberline can try to bag him.
And after that?"</p>

<p>"After that," said the sheriff, "if you help put that poison
Jimmy Carson in the bag for us we'll see what's what. But I'll
still be sheriff, and I'll still have to hunt a wanted man."</p>

<p>Everard Winton stood up.</p>

<p>"I'll go down the hall," he said, "on tip-toe. Then down
stairs as fast as I can get through 'em and across the lobby so
that people can see me and around the hotel to the stable. I'll
jump my horse without a saddle."</p>

<p>"I understand," said the sheriff. "I'm to start right after
you?"</p>

<p>"You're only three steps behind me. But crossing the lobby,
you stumble into something. Give me ten seconds' head start, and
I'll ride out the back door of the barn and slide away. You can
ride after me as hard as you want&mdash;I'll be on the Red
Pacer."</p>

<p>His head went back with a smile.</p>

<p>The sheriff nodded.</p>

<p>"I run you out of town and shoot some lead into the air," said
he. "That makes a good show for me. And you running like a rabbit
instead of fighting like a wolf&mdash;that's not so easy for
you!"</p>

<p>"I can stand that. After I'm gone, suppose that you see
Timberline and have a chat with him. He'll be at the hotel before
long."</p>

<p>"This here Timberline," frowned the sheriff, "is a tough
hombre, but he's a straight shooter. You think I could talk to
him on the up and up?"</p>

<p>"I think you could," said Ever. "All he wants is trouble with
Carson Jimmy."</p>

<p>He settled his hat on his head, held out his hand, and gripped
that of the sheriff.</p>

<p>"Thanks, kid!" said the sheriff.</p>

<p>"Thanks, sheriff!" said Ever, and straightway left the
room.</p>

<p>The sheriff, standing at the door, watched him to the head of
the stairs. Then he lurched in pursuit, with a sudden shout. He
fired a bullet straight before him. It shattered the window at
the other end of the hall.</p>

<p>Down the hall, down the stairs, he rushed and into the lobby,
which was already filled with a swirl of men, all crying out in
great excitement.</p>

<p>He gave his shoulder to the first fellow in his way, stumbled,
sprawled, and was in his feet again, shouting, "Stop that
man&mdash;in the name of the law!"</p>

<p>But not a single soul moved from the lobby to join the
pursuit, a fact of which Bentonville, in days to come, was
exceedingly proud!</p>

<p>Out from the hotel the sheriff darted, crying, "Where'd he go?
Where'd that jackrabbit jump to?"</p>

<p>A staring youngster pointed toward the barn. Off to the stable
sprinted the sheriff as hard as he could go, the naked revolver
still ready in his hand.</p>

<p>He had gained the front door of the barn when the rear sliding
door slammed open and through it went a red flash into the
sunlight. A rider sloped well forward, sitting without a saddle
on the shining stallion.</p>

<p>Right onward through the barn, past the heels of stalled
horses, ran the sheriff, and out into the open, firing as he
went. But he saw the Red Pacer already well out of gunshot,
pouring over the ground with that wonderfully fluid gait which
set him apart from other horses.</p>

<p>Great was the pretended rage and disappointment of the
sheriff; and half a minute later, mounted on his horse, he dashed
off in pursuit.</p>

<p>All of Bentonville was not standing still, however. Half a
dozen well-mounted men had suddenly appeared, as though drawn by
the noise of guns. They joined in that pursuit, making the
situation far more serious than the sheriff had intended. One of
them was the dark-faced Fargo, now pale with a savage eagerness.
And all the rest, as the sheriff could very well guess, were
Jimmy Carson's men. It was not for the sake of the law that they
would be riding on this dangerous quest!</p>

<p>Twice the posse saw the fugitive in the upper valley. Again,
nearly a mile away, the sun gave a red blink on the form of a
horse that was scaling a slope to the right.</p>

<p>Then the posse gave up and returned slowly, disappointed,
toward the town. Said Fargo, on the way: "Sheriff, he's worth
your while catchin', that kid. I know a gent has put up five
thousand reward on him!"</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch35" name="ch35"></a>XXXV. &mdash; GOOD-BYES</h2>

<p class="first">EVER had been driven so high into the mountains
that it was hardly a step to pass on to Timberline's old camp. He
left the Pacer near it, and before leaving the big horse,
squeezed the animal's nostrils firmly together. That warning
would keep him from whinnying for a long time.</p>

<p>Then Ever went on quietly through the thick gloom of the trees
until he came out into the clearing, reddened by the sunset
light. There was no fire burning now, but that was not altogether
strange. It was odd, however, that the lean-to that had been put
up for shelter from the weather should have disappeared. No,
yonder were the ruins of it.</p>

<p>He stepped out into the clearing with a frown.</p>

<p>Something was wrong. The sense of it came more and more
heavily upon him, and he felt that hidden eyes were watching
him.</p>

<p>He was right. Turning quickly, he saw to the left a hideous
face that glared at him with eyes that had little seeing in them.
It was Garry, lashed with his back to a tree, swaddled like a
mummy in long wrappings of rope.</p>

<p>Ever had him free with two touches of a knife; he had to catch
Garry in his arms as the body fell nervelessly forward.</p>

<p>On the ground Garry lay, gasping slowly, staring with swollen
eyes in a swollen face at the sky above him. His mouth was open.
His breath came in a little, ragged fluttering sound that
gradually grew stronger and more prolonged.</p>

<p>"Where's my uncle?" demanded Ever.</p>

<p>Garry, finally, was able to answer, but he only choked out,
"Don't&mdash;leave me&mdash;kid!"</p>

<p>The other sat down cross-legged beside him and gripped his
hand reassuringly.</p>

<p>"I won't leave you, Garry," he said. "I'll stick by you."</p>

<p>"My God! My God!" breathed Garry. "They tied me so's I could
just barely get wind into my lungs. They tied me so's I was
slowly chokin' here&mdash;hours and hours"</p>

<p>He held up a hand to shut away the horror of that
experience.</p>

<p>"Who did it?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Carson Jimmy. Nobody else would have that much devil in
him."</p>

<p>"Was Jimmy here, himself?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Jimmy was here," said Garry. I seen him. Why, he was the
one that wound the rope around me. He wanted me to tell where he
could find Timberline. He wanted me to bait a trap for Timber. I
wouldn't do that. So he said that he'd leave me here to ripen
till I fell. He knew I'd choke before very long. I been there,
inside the rope, tryin' to make my breathin' small&mdash;and
small I kept it&mdash;and then a craziness would come over me and
I'd try to haul in a breath. I'd try so hard that the ropes
bruised all the flesh above my ribs. But I never could drag in a
big breath. My chest was all squashed in by the pull of the rope.
There was no give in it.</p>

<p>"I seen that I was dyin' the worst death in the world. Then
you come, kid, an' I blessed God. But when you come out from the
trees you wouldn't look at me. I thought you sure would pass on
without seein' me. I put my eyes onto you. I willed you to look
at me&mdash;and thank God, you done it!"</p>

<p>He recovered so much, suddenly, that he was able to sit up,
propped on his elbows. His body shook; his voice quavered, also;
but he was rapidly regaining control of himself. His eyes no
longer thrust out from his face so horribly.</p>

<p>"Now, what about Uncle Clay?" asked Ever.</p>

<p>"Him?" said Garry. "They put him on a hoss and took him
off."</p>

<p>Ever leaped up.</p>

<p>"Took him where?" he asked.</p>

<p>"God knows! I don't," said Garry. "They started off that way.
It's too dark for trailin' under the trees, now. They took
him."</p>

<p>Back toward Bentonville went Ever like a homing pigeon, taking
every short cut. Through the gloom of the long evening and
through the darkness that followed, the Red Pacer went on with a
wonderful surety of foot and an instinct for the way that no man-raised horse ever could have had. In just such a manner he had
made marches by night in those days when men were hunting him
hard. So he had gone over a range of mountains, leaving their
snow peaks glimmering behind him under the stars while he dropped
into an unknown valley.</p>

<p>Tirelessly he went, and brought his rider once more behind the
town and to the rear of the hotel.</p>

<p>With the night, Bentonville had opened its throat and was
celebrating, as usual. The jigging rhythm of dance music kept a
tremble in the air and now and then some one yelled or a chorus
of shouts burst out as joy overflowed the throats of a group of
celebrants. There was an underlying hum of humanity that was like
the noise of bees or wasps.</p>

<p>Ever found the lighted window of Dolly Gray's office, and
looked in over the low sill. She was sitting at her desk with her
head pillowed in her folded arms.</p>

<p>He took off his boots, tied them together, hung them about his
neck, and climbed inside. From somewhere in the darkness that
window might be watched, but he would have to take far greater
risks than this, no doubt, before the night was over.</p>

<p>He drew down the window shade, stepped to the girl, and saw
that she was sleeping. A half-written letter to her father was
partially covered by one hand, to mark the point where weariness
had overcome her.</p>

<p>"Dolly!" he whispered.</p>

<p>She lifted her head, frowned, shrugged her shoulders, and then
seemed to be in perfect mastery of herself, once more.</p>

<p>"You want 'em to get hold of you, don't you?" said she,
sarcastically. "You can't keep away from the net, can you, you
poor fish?"</p>

<p>"Where's Timberline?" he asked. "Where is his room?"</p>

<p>"Walk right out to the lobby and ask Shorty to show you up,"
said she.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"You know that I can't do that&mdash;now," said he.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked the girl. "A little thing like a reward on
your head doesn't matter, does it? That makes the game all the
sweeter, eh?"</p>

<p>"You're talking like a wife before we're even married, Dolly,"
said he, with a little chuckle. "But that doesn't matter."</p>

<p>"You get out of Bentonville and stay out!" said the girl,
almost sharply. "They're after you like starved wolves, and
they'll never leave the trail till they get you&mdash;the sheriff
and Carson Jimmy. Either one of 'em would be enough, by
himself!"</p>

<p>"What room is Timberline in?" he repeated.</p>

<p>She started to renew her protest. Then she made a gesture as
of one casting away all concern about a subject. "He's in the
same room that Carson used to have."</p>

<p>"Not sharing it with Carson Jimmy, though?"</p>

<p>"I asked Jimmy Carson to leave the hotel," she said.</p>

<p>"Sorry to spoil your business like that, Dolly," said he. "Is
there any way I can get up to that room without being seen?"</p>

<p>"No. Not unless you climb up to the room from the back yard
and climb down from the front eaves to the window!"</p>

<p>He narrowed his eyes at her.</p>

<p>"Is that the only way?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"That's the only way," said she.</p>

<p>"Well," answered Ever, "that way will have to do, then. So
long, Dolly."</p>

<p>He stepped to the window.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute! You're not crazy enough to try it, are you?"
She stood between him and the window. "Go on," she urged, "and
tell me that you won't try to kill yourself in a fool way like
that."</p>

<p>His face turned suddenly gray and long, grim lines were cut
into it by his emotion.</p>

<p>"Carson's picked up my uncle&mdash;Clay Winton," he said.
"He's grabbed him and run him off. He left another man strangling
in ropes. You understand?"</p>

<p>She stepped back from the window.</p>

<p>"I understand," she said. "I underst&mdash;and&mdash;and I'd
give my boots to help!"</p>

<p>Her face was as stern as his own now.</p>

<p>"You can't help just now," he told her. "But later on, when
I've got time, I want to talk to you about something."</p>

<p>"You'll be in your grave before you'll have any spare time,"
she assured him.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you now, then," said he. "You're grand, Dolly!
You're the pick of the lot. If ever I'm out of the shadow of the
law, I'm going to try to marry you."</p>

<p>"You haven't a chance," said the girl. "They're going to
murder you. You're asking them for it, every day. So I don't mind
telling you that you're the only man in the world that I give a
rap about. I'm burned up about you&mdash;a silly, romantic
kid!"</p>

<p>"That's all right, too," said he. "But I'll get older. So
long, Dolly."</p>

<p>"You might kiss me good-bye, at least," said she.</p>

<p>"I won't touch you," said he. "Not while I'm in the shadow of
the law. If ever I'm free of that&mdash;my God, we'll be
happy!"</p>

<p>He raised the shade, dropped through the window to the ground,
and turned down the side of the building. She did not watch him
go. He saw the shade drawn suddenly down again.</p>

<p>He found that all of his nerves were trembling and jumping.
They had always been steady enough before, but now they were
terribly uneasy. He was sorry now that he had spoken to the girl.
Better to have stolen room by room through the hotel to find
Timberline.</p>

<p>He found a drain pipe running up at the farther corner of the
building. A man climbing up that would make an ideal target, even
against the dim rays of light that struggled back here from the
windows of the street. But he put his hands and knees and feet to
work. It was a tough job, but he could climb a rope, and a rope
was a far harder business than a pipe, after all.</p>

<p>He got to the upper eaves, gripped them, and then used the
trick that Clay Winton had taught him, long before, of swinging
his body once to the side, violently, and in the still more
violent backward swing, of throwing himself up and over the edge
of the eaves.</p>

<p>He lay on his side, looking down into the murky well of the
night and taking his breath deeply. He remained like this until
he was breathing easily, then he resumed his work.</p>

<p>The whole top of the roof was unsafe, the shakes which covered
it having been carelessly put on. Many of them slipped
dangerously under his weight. He had to sprawl his body out
almost flat and move like a wriggling seal. But at length he came
to the front eaves, and lay there, prone.</p>

<p>A pair of riders galloped up the street, whooping. A golden,
dim shaft of light struck across them. They passed on, the acrid
scent of the dust they had raised rising gradually up to Ever's
nostrils.</p>

<p>He thrust his head over the eaves. Below him and just to the
right was a lighted window which must be Timberline's room, now
that the great Carson Jimmy had been expelled from it. But more
than the light that glowed from it, he saw just outside it the
crouched figure of a man, between the sill and the drainage pipe
that ran down from the roof!</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch36" name="ch36"></a>XXXVI. &mdash; ON THE ROOF</h2>

<p class="first">IT was as if his eye were a ray of light,
disturbing the eavesdropper. For instantly the man stood up,
grasped the pipe, and swarmed rapidly but noiselessly up it. Ever
drew back a little, crouching, tense with readiness. It would be
a dreadfully uncertain battleground, this slanting roof of the
hotel, covered with loose shakes; but it might be that this man
climbing up through the darkness was the man he wanted most of
all!</p>

<p>So Ever strained his eyes as the climber came over the edge of
the roof with catlike sureness. He could make out no features,
but something about the shape of the head and the smallness and
agility of the body made him certain that this was the very
man&mdash;Carson Jimmy!</p>

<p>The next instant that slender body was hurled with a sidewise
spin at him; the feet struck him heavily in the breast and
knocked him clean over the edge of the roof. Only his left hand
hooked over the lip of the gutter, and the shock was greeted with
an ominous tearing sound, as though nails were pulling loose.</p>

<p>His right hand joined the left. He swung himself strongly to
the side, in the pendulous motion that would bring him to the top
of the roof. Then a grinding weight stamped down on the fingers
of his left hand. That was Carson Jimmy's heel, striving to make
him loose his hold.</p>

<p>But already he was on the backward swing, and now he rolled
over the edge of the gutter and reached for the smaller man's
legs. They evaded him, and he lurched to his feet and saw that
Carson was sprinting fearlessly across the rattling shakes of the
roof&mdash;already almost at the farther side of it. Now he
dipped over the edge so suddenly that it seemed he must have
jumped down into the thin air.</p>

<p>Carson was gone from his very finger, as it were! And that
left him a slight margin to work on; every second would have to
be used.</p>

<p>He dropped over the eaves again, gripped the drain pipe, and a
moment later was on the sill of the window below, a dizzy
position, with the street still so far beneath him that a fall to
it certainly would mean broken bones.</p>

<p>But inside the open window, he saw Timberline, in the act of
shaking hands and saying goodbye to the sheriff.</p>

<p>Ever stepped into the room, and saw the eyes of the sheriff,
who was at the door facing toward him, open widely, like the eyes
of an amazed child.</p>

<p>"Look!" gasped Rance McDonald. Away from the lighted square of
the window and whatever prying eyes might be watching from the
street, Ever moved down the wall saying:</p>

<p>"I'm the second visitor you've had this evening, Timber."</p>

<p>Timberline had spun on one heel, bringing a gun instinctively
into his hand. Now he remained with the weapon poised,
gaping.</p>

<p>"Where the devil did you come from?" asked Timberline.</p>

<p>"From the roof. Give me a rag to tie up this hand."</p>

<p>He showed his hand, the blood dripping from it. Three of the
fingers were torn and bruised.</p>

<p>Not Timberline but the sheriff stepped forward, drawing out a
clean bandanna; and with expert speed he made the bandage,
muttering softly to himself as he did it.</p>

<p>"How did you get that?" asked Timberline.</p>

<p>"Carson Jimmy's heel was on it, a minute ago," said Ever.</p>

<p>"The devil you say! Jimmy Carson?"</p>

<p>"Yes, on the roof. He was down here at the window, listening
in. What scheme were you and McDonald cooking up? It's no good,
whatever it was, because he heard the whole yarn. I tried to nab
him when he came up to the roof again, but it was like trying to
handle a snake. Something kept him from using a gun, or I'd be a
dead one, now, down in the dust of the street."</p>

<p>"A busy little bee, this fellow Winton," said Timberline to
the sheriff, as the latter completed the bandaging. "What have
you been up to since McDonald gave you the run?"</p>

<p>"I dropped in at your camp. Carson had been there before me.
He got my uncle and took him away, and he left Garry tied so hard
with a rope that he was choking to death. Garry's done up for a
day or two. I couldn't trail my uncle at night. So I came back
down here and found that Carson was already on the job again
ahead of me. That's all."</p>

<p>"'That's all!' " quoted Timberline. "Thank the Lord there's no
more! What did Carson do to your uncle?"</p>

<p>"He'll murder him," said Ever, his face white. "Uncle Clay's a
dead man now&mdash;or as good as dead.
Timber&mdash;McDonald&mdash;have you any ideas?"</p>

<p>"Carson's out of the hotel," said the sheriff. "Dolly Gray
asked him to move, after the play that was made at you from the
door of the Borrow saloon. I tried to drag some information out
of Sid Williams. I scared the rat, but not as much as Carson has
him scared. I knew that I couldn't make him talk, and I was
right. But Carson's moved headquarters out of town."</p>

<p>"Al's on the trail," said Timberline. "Al can follow a trail
like a wolf through the dark&mdash;by the scent, you'd say. He'll
be reporting any minute, I hope. When we know the hangout, we go
for it&mdash;that's all&mdash;and try to round up the bunch of
'em."</p>

<p>"We've got one gain," said the sheriff. "We've something on
Carson. He attacked Garry, your man. He grabbed your uncle, too,
though that don't count."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Winton, grimly.</p>

<p>"Your uncle's wanted by the law. Jimmy Carson, he just up and
grabs the man that's wanted for the fun of it, and starts takin'
him to jail. But your uncle tries to make a break for it, and,
sorry to say, they have to shoot him full of lead, understand?
Your uncle don't count&mdash;but Garry is evidence. I wish you'd
brought him in with you!"</p>

<p>"I've got to get out of here, now," said Ever, desperately.
"Already they're laying for me around the hotel. But I'll take
the stairs down."</p>

<p>"You can't do that!" said the sheriff. "Carson likely has some
of his thugs planted in the lobby."</p>

<p>"The only way I see, outside of the stairs, is climbing down
from a window; and by this time the crooks are watching the
windows. I'm starting, Timber, what' d'you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"If you can get out, you wild-cat chunk of lightning," said
Timberline, his eyes glimmering as he looked at Ever, "wait
around the hotel. You know my signal whistle, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

<p>"When you hear that, come in. Al will be along before a great
while, and he ought to know something. It's hard to throw him off
a scent."</p>

<p>"So long!" said Ever and, disappearing through the door, he
walked hastily down the hall toward the head of the stairs. He
had spent many invaluable seconds in the room with the sheriff
and Timberline and Carson Jimmy's preparations would be electric
in their speed, now that he knew his enemy was in the
building.</p>

<p>Down the stairs Ever ran lightly, and stepped into the lobby,
gun in hand. The shock of that sudden appearance brought a deep,
quick grunt from a dozen throats.</p>

<p>"It's all right, boys," said he. "This gun is only a safe
conduct for me, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>He saw the big form of Buck Waters draw back into a corner, as
he went across the room.</p>

<p>"I see you, Buck," said he. "Don't try to tag me, or you'll be
it for keeps."</p>

<p>A short, thick-shouldered form came out of a chair and went
towards the door in front of him. That was Harry Lawson, the
half-breed. He whirled, half way across the room, and went on
toward the door, backing up rapidly, moving his head a little
from side to side as he scanned every face.</p>

<p>Buck Waters, in the far corner had a face made ugly by a
fighting expression that was frozen on it; the other men looked
more bewildered than hostile.</p>

<p>Ever gained the door, leaped sidewise into the dark of the
veranda, and saw Harry Lawson running before him around the
corner of the building. They paused beside the faintly gleaming
form of the red stallion. Behind them the hotel was in an uproar,
but no one ran into the backyard in pursuit. Harry Lawson
said:</p>

<p>"You still alive, Ever? Pretty lucky boy! But I get the Red
Pacer before long."</p>

<p>He chuckled, as Ever swung into the saddle. Then Harry Lawson
caught his stirrup.</p>

<p>"You wait here," he said, and trotted off toward the door of
the barn.</p>

<p>Wait there? It was almost as safe as to wait under a tree when
a wasps' nest has fallen from the branch to the ground. And yet
something made Ever linger where he was, merely reining back the
stallion so that they were more than half buried in the clump of
shrubbery.</p>

<p>In the meantime, doors were slamming inside the hotel. Feet
beat heavily on the front veranda. The hoofs of horses pounded in
the main street, muffled by the thick layers of dust.</p>

<p>Harry Lawson returned, riding a small mustang.</p>

<p>"You come along," said he.</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Ever.</p>

<p>But he received no answer. At a dog trot, the half-breed faded
his mustang into the dark of the night, and an uncontrollable
instinct made Ever follow. To be sure, he had promised to remain
near the hotel, but he was drawn irresistibly after the strange
little man of the desert.</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch37" name="ch37"></a>XXXVII. &mdash; MAYBE ONE LESS
WINTON</h2>

<p class="first">THEY took the road down the valley, and twice,
on the way, Ever strove to pump the half-breed. But he received
only grunts in answer.</p>

<p>He was much troubled, not only because he had promised
Timberline and the sheriff to remain near the hotel, but also
because he could not be sure of the friendship of that oddity
among men, white or red, Harry Lawson. It was true that the man
had twice acted with most unexpected kindness and loyalty. It was
also true that he might be willing to go to almost any degree of
desperation to get the Red Pacer back into his own
possession.</p>

<p>Finally, reining back the stallion beside the dim silhouette
of Lawson on the trail, Ever said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You know, Harry, this horse is almost part of my flesh and
blood, I'm so fond of him. But if you can help me to get my uncle
out of trouble&mdash;why, man, the Pacer goes back to you as sure
as fate. Understand?"</p>

<p>"You shake hands?" asked the voice of Lawson.</p>

<p>Fumbling, Winton found the man's rough hand in the darkness,
and gripped it.</p>

<p>"All right," said Harry Lawson, as their fingers parted.</p>

<p>The bargain was made and sealed, and Ever suddenly felt that
he might be riding the great horse for the last time.</p>

<p>They traveled two or three miles from Bentonville&mdash;a
distance hard to estimate because of the darkness and the winding
of the trail. Then, turning to the side from the main trail, they
worked through dense brush, and from this came out among lofty
trees. These again gave place to what had once been a handsome
clearing, but was now a growth of shrubbery, ten or a dozen years
old. It filled up the space which the giants of the forest
bordered. In the center of this space stood a house which, even
by starlight, appeared to be bowed and broken by time. But from
two windows gleamed light, as from two unevenly placed eyes.</p>

<p>"Is my uncle there?" he asked Lawson.</p>

<p>"I hold the hosses," said Lawson. "You go look."</p>

<p>He dismounted as he spoke, and took the reins when Ever sprang
down to the ground.</p>

<p>"If you hear guns, Harry," said Ever, "and I don't come out to
you again right away, you'll know that you're free to take the
horses back to Bentonville. The Pacer will belong to you then. In
that case, you'd better find the sheriff and tell him exactly
what has happened. Tell him I gave you the horse, and he'll
believe you. If I don't see you again, good-bye, Harry. You've
backed me up when I needed backing."</p>

<p>He held out his hand. The half-breed said, calmly:</p>

<p>"You go along. Look what you see."</p>

<p>Ever patted the wet neck of the stallion, turned, and began to
work his way carefully through the brush towards the lights.</p>

<p>Two figures strode suddenly toward him through the darkness.
He sank to the ground.</p>

<p>"What's that?" muttered a voice.</p>

<p>And another answered, "Nothing. I didn't see nothing."</p>

<p>"I thought something moved out here."</p>

<p>"The wind in the brush, I guess."</p>

<p>"Yeah. I guess. Where d'you think you heard the voices?"</p>

<p>"Over yonder."</p>

<p>"It might be the chief comin' back."</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;and it mightn't. Rance McDonald is a smart man.
So's Timberline. I guess they're both agin us, now."</p>

<p>"They might as well be agin the devil as agin Carson
Jimmy."</p>

<p>"Yeah, and they'll find that out, too. Come on&mdash;and look
sharp."</p>

<p>They moved ahead, at right angles to the spot where Ever had
just left Harry Lawson.</p>

<p>He could breathe freely, now, but not too freely. For he had
just had a sufficient testimony of the care with which this house
in the woods was guarded. He began to wonder how many men were
working under the leadership of Carson Jimmy. The man's
organization, it was said, was very flexible; but once a man had
been employed by him he was subject to call again at any time.
So, at need, a crowd could be made to spring out of the ground by
the will of Carson Jimmy. And every one was a tried man.</p>

<p>Ever went carefully, feeling his way, making sure that no twig
crackled under his footfall as he came close to the first window.
The shutters had been closed, but many of the slats had been
broken out, and the whole affair sagged clumsily from the
crumbling hinges.</p>

<p>He was about to look in through one of the gaps when an
outbreak of gunshots came from the valley. But the noise died out
in a second or two, and again silence covered the valley. It was
cut by the whispering of the wind.</p>

<p>Inside the house voices began to rumble. Ever stepped closer
to the broken shutters and saw a lantern standing on a table. By
that light, moreover, he made out two men sitting up from their
blankets, one blinking and one rubbing sleepy eyes. They were
mere youngsters, though they were older in appearance because of
a wealth of unshaven beard.</p>

<p>"What was that up the valley?" asked one.</p>

<p>"It wasn't up the valley. It was down," said the other.</p>

<p>"You're crazy! I heard it."</p>

<p>"I heard it too. You're a crazy loon."</p>

<p>"I gotta mind to sock you for that."</p>

<p>"You better bust your hand on a brick wall than on me," said
the other.</p>

<p>"Aw, go back to sleep and shut up!"</p>

<p>They both settled down in their blankets again, one of them
groaning at the hardness of the boards.</p>

<p>Ever passed on to the next window, and found this one
unshuttered.</p>

<p>Inside a different scene met his eyes. On the hearth of a
fireplace wood was burning with a cheerful crackling. Another
lantern was pegged against a wall, and under it, a rifle lying
across his knees, sat Fargo. At the center table a man in a blue
flannel shirt, his sleeves rolled up to his elbows, was playing
solitaire. His back was to the window, and therefore his face
remained unseen.</p>

<p>But neither of these figures was of the first importance to
Ever. What counted was the tall figure seated beside the fire,
thoroughly secured, foot and hand, with strong ropes. For that
man was Clay Winton! Once more the half-breed had been
mysteriously right.</p>

<p>Said the man in the blue shirt, "Lookit, Fargo."</p>

<p>"Look at what?" growled Fargo.</p>

<p>He lifted a hand, as he spoke, and softly massaged the purple
bruise on the side of his chin.</p>

<p>"Look at what's the use of settin' over there when we might be
havin' a game of seven-up."</p>

<p>"The chief told one of us to keep on guard."</p>

<p>"The chief ain't here."</p>

<p>"Somebody would tell him, though, if things wasn't done to his
likin'."</p>

<p>"Yeah. A lot of lip is shot off around this camp," said the
man' wearing the flannel shirt.</p>

<p>"Get Jerry or Mike to play with you," suggested Fargo.</p>

<p>"Jerry and Mike is corked."</p>

<p>"Go on, Bud, and get Mike. Mike'll always wake up for
cards&mdash;if they's any money in the game."</p>

<p>"Mike's dead to the world, too," said Bud. "He wouldn't play.
They rode a long way to get here. What would the chief want so
many men for? He's got a regular army."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Fargo. "Ain't Rance McDonald on the job, and
Timberline?"</p>

<p>"Timberline is a mean card to play, all right," said Bud.</p>

<p>"He's a mean card to handle," agreed Fargo.</p>

<p>"Then there's the kid&mdash;young Winton&mdash;that they all
talk about so much."</p>

<p>"Him? I'll handle him when the time comes," said Fargo
angrily.</p>

<p>"Last time you met up, he done all the handling, didn't he?"
asked Bud.</p>

<p>He turned. The watcher from the window could see the big jowl
of the man, wrinkled by a grin as he stared at Fargo's bruised
jaw.</p>

<p>"He got in a lucky sock at me, that was all," said Fargo.</p>

<p>"Oh, was that all?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'm tellin' you!"</p>

<p>"All right," said Bud. "Leave it that way. He ain't any
brother of mine. But how about it, Winton? Could your kid nephew
handle Fargo in a level go?"</p>

<p>Clay Winton turned. "Ever could eat a couple dozen like
Fargo," he said.</p>

<p>"You lie!" exclaimed Fargo, jumping to his feet. "There never
was a Winton born that I couldn't lick!"</p>

<p>The prisoner regarded him with lack-luster, in-different eyes,
and made no answer.</p>

<p>"A lot of fat heads is what the Wintons are," declared Fargo,
his heat increasing. "But there'll be one less Winton before many
hours, I reckon."</p>

<p>"Maybe you're right," said Clay.</p>

<p>"Unless you got sense and write the letter that he wants,"
went on Fargo.</p>

<p>Clay shook his head.</p>

<p>"Ever's life is about spoiled because of me, anyway," said he.
I ain't gonna be bait to any trap for him."</p>

<p>"Well, it don't make any difference," said Fargo. "The chief's
got a specimen of your writin', and he'll forge the letter!"</p>

<p>"He can't fool Ever," said the uncle.</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch38" name="ch38"></a>XXXVIII. &mdash; OUTSIDE LOOKING
IN</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was one way for Ever to deliver his uncle.
With the muzzle of his revolver resting on the sill of the
window, the boy meditated upon it. He could shoot down Fargo and
Bud, leap through the window, cut his uncle's bonds and attempt
to hold off the rush of Mike and Jerry from the next room. Even
if they were disposed of, which might not be so easy, there would
still be the two men outside the house to consider&mdash;perhaps
more than two. He could not tell how completely the place was
guarded.</p>

<p>But the primary obstacle that confronted him at once was the
important fact that he could not shoot down a human being in cold
blood. Hardened rascals they both might be. But murder he could
not do.</p>

<p>He turned and faded rapidly back into the brush until he stood
beside the half-breed and the two horses again.</p>

<p>"D'you hear me, Harry?" he murmured.</p>

<p>"Hush up&mdash;they're mighty near!" whispered Lawson.</p>

<p>Ever put his lips to the ear of the breed.</p>

<p>"Ride back to town&mdash;take both the horses with you. Find
the sheriff. If you can't find him, find Timberline. Tell them
they may need a dozen men. Bring 'em out here on the run, and
make them soft-foot it into the house, yonder. They'll find
plenty to do. Tell them my uncle's there. Tell them that six
other men, at least, are on hand. Hurry, Harry! Ride like the
devil, as soon as you're out of earshot!"</p>

<p>The Indian tapped him once on the shoulder, as though to give
silent notice that he understood, then he faded back into the
trees, with the two horses. Ever stared after him until his eyes
ached.</p>

<p>A moment later, the clatter of hoofs stopped on the trail; and
presently there was the noise of a considerable body of horsemen
breaking in through the underbrush toward the old abandoned
clearing. Ever wondered if these new arrivals were connected with
the outbreak of gunfire that he had heard not long before, and he
hurried back with all the speed and the silence that he could
manage, to the window he had just left.</p>

<p>He was in time to see a strange procession enter the room.
There was Mike and Jerry, in the first place, coming blinking
from their sleep, and then Timberline, held on the one side by
Al, and on the other side by the great Jimmy Carson in person.
Behind them hurried two more rough-looking fellows.</p>

<p>"Here's your friend Winton," said Carson to Timberline.
"Winton, here's your friend Timberline."</p>

<p>He stood by, rubbing his hands together with great pleasure
and surveying the two captives, while Timberline was forced into
a chair and lashed to it firmly.</p>

<p>"Sorry to see you here, Timber," said Clay Winton.</p>

<p>"The luck's against me," said Timberline. "The luck&mdash;and
one cur."</p>

<p>He nodded toward big Al. The latter, his face convulsed with
anger, strode forward and leaned over the prisoner.</p>

<p>"You call me a cur, eh?" he said.</p>

<p>With the flat of his hand he struck Timberline heavily in the
face.</p>

<p>The blow knocked Timberline's long hair awry, but he steadied
himself instantly, and looked calmly on at the traitor.</p>

<p>"I wasn't good enough for you, eh?" sneered Al. "You wanted
that kid, that Winton. That was what you wanted. Well, you got
him, now, and you've got hell, too! He brung it on you. Lay to
that&mdash;and remember it."</p>

<p>"I'll remember it," said Timberline.</p>

<p>"Back up, Al," said Carson Jimmy.</p>

<p>He advanced with his wonderfully quick, light step, and tapped
the big man on the chest. His eyes were afire, though he kept his
voice soft.</p>

<p>"You're new," said Jimmy Carson, "and you ain't used to the
rules of my crowd yet or you'd know that you'd better jump off a
cliff than to lift your hand on anybody around me, till I give
the word. But that's all right&mdash;that's all right. You'll
learn, Al."</p>

<p>"He sold you, eh?" asked Clay Winton.</p>

<p>"He sold me," agreed Timberline, looking with unutterable
contempt at Al.</p>

<p>The latter bawled out, "I was tired of your damn high-falutin'
ways. And the kid pleased you a lot more than gents that had
worked for you for years and done your dirty work and got nothing
but kicks all year round."</p>

<p>Timberline still fixed Al with his glance of disgust. He
said:</p>

<p>"Clay, that fellow was about to be lynched by a crowd because
he was accused of stealing a horse. I got him away from 'em. I've
saved his neck since then, too; but I never expected that any
human being could pay back such things with this sort of play.
Still, he's not a man. He's a cur."</p>

<p>"I fooled you and you're sore," sneered Al, though his color
had changed under this steady flow of contempt. "I was too smart
for you."</p>

<p>"When he got to the right place on the road," said Timberline
to Clay Winton, "he grabbed my arms from behind and Carson came
at me. I got a gun out, but I was shooting blind. That was the
clever trick that Al played. What did you pay him for it,
Carson?"</p>

<p>"I paid him five hundred bucks and a chance to work for me
afterwards," said Jimmy Carson. "You didn't cost me much,"
Timberline."</p>

<p>"You're not through with me yet," said Timberline, with
amazing calm.</p>

<p>"No?" said Carson. Then he laughed and pulled out a gun. I
pull the trigger twice," said he, "and I beckon the souls of both
of you down to hell. That's how I've got you, Timberline."</p>

<p>He added, to one of the men, "Bring in the sack of stuff. I
want to show this rummy that the whole game is in my hands."</p>

<p>Out went a quick-stepping little fellow and came back with a
tarpaulin sack under his arm, the sort of a bag that might be
used for soft dunnage of any kind. He flopped it on the
table.</p>

<p>"Your partner, Winton&mdash;he could tell you about what's in
the sack and who it belongs to," said Carson Jimmy, grinning with
delight.</p>

<p>Timberline stared at Winton, and Clay Winton nodded. He kept
his voice calm, but his face was white and his haunted eyes were
fixed on the tarpaulin bag.</p>

<p>"You know about the bank I stuck up in the old days?" he said.
"The sheriff knows about it, anyway. Well, Timber, when I was up
there in the camp with you, I was pretty worried about Ever. It
seemed to me that I was the chief cause of dragging him to
outlawry. It kept weighing on my mind."</p>

<p>He was silent, shaking his head a little.</p>

<p>Timberline said, "So you packed yourself across country from
the camp, one day. You decided that you'd get what was left of
the loot and turn it in to the law, and that when the bank found
part of the stolen money back, it might not bear down on you very
hard. And if you were back in the law-abiding ranks&mdash;well,
then Ever would follow you down from the hills. Is that it?"</p>

<p>Clay Winton nodded.</p>

<p>"I hadn't spent very much of the stuff," he said. I don't
think I had much pleasure out of the loot I grabbed, anyway. How
could I, when I was wondering most of the time what my brother
and Ever would think of me if they ever found out that the cash I
was spending was stolen money? It didn't cost me much to live at
the ranch. I lay low. I kept to the family. If the bank president
cracked open that bag, he wouldn't find very much missing from
it. I only spent a few hundreds out of the whole wad."</p>

<p>"He'd give up the whole steal for the sake of his cracked
nephew," sneered Carson Jimmy. "It shows the kind of a fool he is
the kind of foolishness that runs in the Winton blood. But when
we grabbed Clay, we grabbed his money, too; and now the bank'll
never see a penny of it. We've got better things to do with it.
We got better ways of putting it back into circulation."</p>

<p>Such an exultation came over him that he literally raised
himself to his toes with his laughter; and the sound was like
that of a crowing rooster.</p>

<p>"Now, Timberline," he exclaimed, finally, "you see I've got
you in my hand? You see that the whole game is mine? Your game,
and Clay Winton's game?"</p>

<p>"Far as you know," said the amazing Timberline, "a friend of
mine may be standing outside that window, at this moment,
covering you!"</p>

<p>Carson spun about on his heel, stared at the shuttered window
through which Ever was at that moment looking, and cursed.</p>

<p>"Kind of gave me a start, Timber," he admitted. "You're a cool
devil, Timber, but you ain't cool enough to work on Jimmy Carson.
You stood up in the world long enough to make a name for
yourself, but you didn't stand high enough. That's the trouble
with you. I only needed to reach once, and I got you! I got you
for keeps!"</p>

<p>He laughed again, as he spoke.</p>

<p>Then, stepping back and rubbing his skinny hands together, he
added:</p>

<p>"Look 'em over, boys. There's two that stood up to me. You've
seen what happens to 'em, every time? Here's two more to go the
same way. If I only had Rance McDonald and the kid here, the
picture would be pretty, wouldn't it? But they'll come next. I'll
teach that damn sheriff to reach his hand into my pie!"</p>

<p>"Why, Jimmy," said Winton, speaking gently, you ain't ever
gonna get Rance McDonald. Don't you know that?"</p>

<p>"Why should I know that?" demanded the leader sharply.</p>

<p>"You wanta know why?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. I'd like to know why."</p>

<p>"Because he's a better man than you are, Jimmy. And because
Ever is working with him. Oh, they'll have you in the bag before
long!"</p>

<p>"Will they? Will they? Will they?" snarled the little man.
"Why, I've made fools of 'em already."</p>

<p>"The way you did when the boy ran you off'n the roof of the
hotel?" put in Timberline.</p>

<p>Carson Jimmy jumped inches clear of the floor.</p>

<p>"You lie!" he shouted.</p>

<p>"I don't lie," answered Timberline. "He ran you off the hotel
roof and you know it."</p>

<p>"I kicked him over the edge of the gutter," screamed the great
Carson, in a fury of mortified vanity. "I could of knocked him
down into the street to break all the fool bones in his
body."</p>

<p>Clay Winton lifted his head a little and laughed.</p>

<p>"You fools!" shouted Carson Jimmy. "I could of"</p>

<p>"You didn't do it," broke in Timberline. "And that shows that
you couldn't. There never was a dirty, cowardly murder that you
could do, that you didn't do. You know that. Why not out with the
truth?"</p>

<p>Carson Jimmy's rage made his entire body shake.</p>

<p>"I'm a coward, am I?" he whispered through his teeth.</p>

<p>"Why, you know you are, Carson," said Clay Winton, who had
begun this badgering.</p>

<p>What it could lead to except the sudden death of those who
were conducting the torment, Ever could not guess.</p>

<p>In the meantime, with an anxious mind, he was measuring the
distance from this place to town.</p>

<p>How long would it take the half-breed to ride in; how long
would it take the sheriff to gather the necessary men, and bring
them out again?</p>

<p>I know what I am, do I?" said Carson, grinding his teeth as he
faced Clay Winton. "You tell me what I am, then!"</p>

<p>"Leave him be, chief," suggested Fargo. "He's just trying to
rile you."</p>

<p>"Shut your damn mouth!" yelled Carson to Fargo.</p>

<p>He wheeled back upon Clay Winton.</p>

<p>"Go on and tell me, you. I wanta know what I am. You go on and
tell me!"</p>

<p>Said Winton, "Why, you're just a dirty little crook&mdash;the
whole world knows that. You buy your murders. You never killed a
man in a fair, stand-up fight in your life. You prefer to bag 'em
the way you bagged me and Timberline, yonder!"</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch39" name="ch39"></a>XXXIX. &mdash; BAITED</h2>

<p class="first">A BUBBLING sound came out of Carson Jimmy's
throat.</p>

<p>"You mean that?" he gasped, at last.</p>

<p>"Mean it?" said Clay Winton, as though in surprise. "Why, all
your men know that."</p>

<p>"You know that, Fargo?" snapped Carson.</p>

<p>Injured vanity had him more than half hysterical.</p>

<p>"He's pullin' your leg, chief," said Fargo. "He's pulling your
leg, is all he's doin'."</p>

<p>"You're their pocketbook, that's all," said Clay Winton to the
leader. "But the whole world, it knows what kind of a little rat
you are. You never faced a real man in your life."</p>

<p>Carson almost choked with the extent of his fury.</p>

<p>"It's a sort of a joke," said Winton, "to be settin'
here&mdash;people like me and Timberline, yonder. You know damned
well, man, that you'd never dare to stand up to us in a fair
fight&mdash;either one of us."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't I?" said Carson, his eyes turning green with insane
fury. "I'll tell you what&mdash;I'll tell you what"</p>

<p>He turned away from his prisoners and began to take rapid
paces through the room, at the same time, it appeared,
considering what he would do&mdash;how he would prove his
manhood.</p>

<p>He paused, turned on his heel. And then, pointing his arm at
Clay Winton, he shouted:</p>

<p>"Who met up with Budge Cracken and Lew Halliwell and blew 'em
both to hell?"</p>

<p>"Why, man," said Winton, "do you claim that you done
that?"</p>

<p>"Who else did? Who else did?" yelled Carson Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Why, everybody knows what happened to them," said Clay
Winton.</p>

<p>He lolled his head back and laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"What're you laughin' at?" demanded the leader, stepping
close, his terrible left hand working convulsively, as the
watcher at the window had seen it work before.</p>

<p>For Carson seemed to be prolonging his own torment, almost as
if he was enjoying the exquisite perfection of his rage.</p>

<p>"Laughin'?" said Clay Winton. "Why, I'm laughin' at you, you
puffed up little fool of a skinny toad. I'm laughin' at you
because that's all you're worth, is laughin' at. Everybody knows
what happened to Cracken and Lew Halliwell."</p>

<p>"Does everybody know? Then you tell me what!"</p>

<p>"They got into a scrap with each other and Halliwell knifed
Cracken and Cracken dropped, and shot Halliwell while he was
lyin' on the ground."</p>

<p>"Damn you!" said Carson, through his grinding teeth. "That's a
lie and you know it's a lie. I killed 'em both. I run the knife
into Cracken, and when Halliwell turned, hearin' the body fall,
he was just in time to get a bullet between the eyes."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't have the nerve," said Clay Winton, "even to stab
one man in the back and murder his pal as he turned around. You
wouldn't have the nerve, Carson. You ain't a man. You're just a
sneakin' poison snake. Poison is all you work with. There ain't
the heart of a house cat in you. Why, the whole world knows that,
Jimmy. Don't be a fool and try to bluff any more. Look around at
your own men. They're all laughin' at you!"</p>

<p>Jimmy Carson flashed a glance around the room, and it was true
that a smile was being hastily swallowed by all of his men. Not
that they really doubted his fighting courage. Most of them had
seen it demonstrated too many times. It was simply that they
could not help enjoying the purple fury into which their famous
leader was thrown by the taunting words of Winton.</p>

<p>So, as a matter of fact, Carson saw the disappearing smiles,
and if he had been half insane with anger before, he was entirely
mad now. He began to laugh in a way that curdled the blood.</p>

<p>"Say it to me once more," he entreated. "Say I ain't got the
nerve to stand up to a fightin' man."</p>

<p>"No. Everybody knows that," said Clay Winton.</p>

<p>"Would you call yourself a fightin' man?" snarled Carson.</p>

<p>"I'm a half-way fightin' man," declared Clay Winton.</p>

<p>"Would I stand up to you?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. Nobody would expect you to."</p>

<p>"Why, damn your yellow heart and lungs and liver!" gasped
Carson Jimmy. "I'll stand up to you right now."</p>

<p>"Sure you will," agreed Winton, nodding his head amiably.
"Sure you'll stand up to me, now. It's just your style&mdash;a
fellow tied to a chair is just the way you want him. That's the
way you've killed a good many before this day!"</p>

<p>"Set him loose!" commanded the strangled voice of Carson
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Hey, chief! You don't mean that!" exclaimed Fargo.</p>

<p>"Don't I?"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't want to turn his hands loose, would you?" said
Fargo.</p>

<p>"You see, Jim," persisted Clay Winton, "all of your men know
that you're a yellow cur. Even Fargo knows it. They only work for
you because the pay is high. They'd work for a Chinaman, just the
same."</p>

<p>"Fargo!" screamed Carson.</p>

<p>Fargo leaped to his feet as though a bullet had torn through
his flesh.</p>

<p>"Yeah, chief?" he stammered.</p>

<p>"You hear me?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I hear you."</p>

<p>"Then jump when I speak to you, you dog! Will you?"</p>

<p>Fargo stood half sullen and half frightened.</p>

<p>"Whatcha want?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I told you before!" yelled Carson Jimmy. "But it's true.
Winton's right. I ain't observed around here, no more. I'm
treated like a half-wit boy. I ain't got any rights and no
command. You all know better than I do. You damn block-head! Cut
Winton loose from that chair, you hear?"</p>

<p>All protest was checked by this savage outbreak. And the
nephew, at the window, at last understood the tactics of his
uncle, deep and dangerous as they were.</p>

<p>If it came to a fair fight, might he not win? Was there not a
chance? And if he won, the instant that the leader fell would his
gangsters really care to continue the fight for that fallen
bloodhound, their master? It was very dubious, to say the
least.</p>

<p>Even now their eyes were lighting hungrily and with sheer joy
at the prospect of the fight that was opening before them.</p>

<p>Fargo, in the meantime, was untying the ropes.</p>

<p>"Cut them, damn you! Cut the ropes and turn him loose!"
shouted Carson. "Because I wanta get at him!"</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch40" name="ch40"></a>XL. &mdash; SHOOTING
CONTEST</h2>

<p class="first">"WAIT a minute," called Timberline. "I ought to
have the first call in this."</p>

<p>"You want some of the same medicine, do you?" snarled Carson
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"I want as much as I can get of it," said Timberline. "But you
won't take me, Carson. You'd rather pick on a poor devil who's
been shot already, and who's only half himself."</p>

<p>"Leave Winton be," said Carson Jimmy. "Let him go. Here's the
best game of all; here's the great Timberline! Ain't the world
heard plenty about him lately? Ain't we all been told about what
a great man he is? Well, now we're gonna see! Look here,
Timberline!"</p>

<p>"Well?" said Timberline.</p>

<p>"You ain't been wounded, have you?" asked Carson.</p>

<p>"Not a scratch."</p>

<p>"You ain't out of condition in any way?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;as soon as I work out the cramps that these ropes
are putting in my arms."</p>

<p>"You'll have a chance to work 'em out," answered Carson.
"You're gonna have every chance, the same as me. It's gonna be a
square fight. I'll teach you who's your master, Timber."</p>

<p>In the meantime, urged by the angry command of their master,
the men had liberated Timberline from the chair. Both he and Clay
Winton were now free, hand and foot. But to Winton little
attention was given. It had been his prolonged series of insults
that had worked up Carson Jimmy to the point of frenzy, but it
was Timberline who would do the fighting for them both.</p>

<p>What depended upon this contest Carson made clear. Timberline
rubbed arms and wrists to restore the circulation which the grip
of the ropes had checked. Carson said:</p>

<p>"Fargo, Al&mdash;all the rest of you boys&mdash;this is gonna
be a fair, free, stand-up fight, understand?"</p>

<p>Fargo took it upon himself to answer that he understood
perfectly.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Carson, "if I drop, what d'you do?"</p>

<p>"Plaster the devil with lead!" said Fargo.</p>

<p>"That's what you call a fair fight, is it?" sneered Carson
Jimmy. "Lemme tell you what you'll do, then, if I drop. You keep
your hands off this gent, and you let him go. Is that straight?
You understand that?"</p>

<p>Fargo exchanged glances with the others; they shrugged their
shoulders.</p>

<p>"All right," said Fargo. "Anyway that you put it is the right
way for all of us."</p>

<p>"Because," said Carson, "if I ain't the fastest and the
straightest shot this side of hell, I ain't the man to lead you
boys. You oughta foller Timberline&mdash;if he'll have you. I
don't ask any favors. All I want is a fair crack at him. And if I
drop, he's the king, as far as you're concerned."</p>

<p>Fargo nodded and grunted a few words which Ever could hardly
understand.</p>

<p>Now he saw Carson actually place a Colt's revolver in
Timberline's hand, saying: "Is that your medicine, Timber?"</p>

<p>"That's the gun you took from me," nodded Timberline.</p>

<p>He sat down on the edge of the table and broke the gun open;
examined it carefully, spun the cylinders. It had no sights. The
trigger had been filed away.</p>

<p>Carson produced a gun of exactly similar appearance and looked
it over in the same way, although taking less time to the
examination. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Fargo!"</p>

<p>"Yeah, chief?" answered Fargo.</p>

<p>"If I put Timberline down, whether I'm killed or not, it's up
to you boys to finish him off. Take him easy and steady. Don't
hurry him none. Let him die gradual, and taste it all the way
down his throat. Understand?"</p>

<p>A sudden light flashed across Fargo's brutal face.</p>

<p>"I understand," said he. "Eh, Al?"</p>

<p>The latter was grinning also, and his eyes became fixed like
the detestable eyes of a hungry wolf upon the face of the master
he has betrayed.</p>

<p>"Ready?" snapped Carson.</p>

<p>"I'm ready," said Timberline.</p>

<p>"One minute," said Carson. "What about Winton, after this
little scrap?"</p>

<p>"He goes the way with Timberline," said Fargo. "If Timber
wins, Winton goes free with him. If Timber loses, Winton steps
right along into the same hell with him. That suit you,
Winton?"</p>

<p>Timberline broke in. "I'd rather do my fighting for myself.
Let Winton handle himself."</p>

<p>"Any play that he makes is good enough to suit me," answered
Winton.</p>

<p>"Then," said Carson, "it's all fixed. I'm gonna walk the pair
of you into the hottest part of hell, Timberline. I'm gonna show
you how much bluff there is in me. Clear away, there, all of you.
Back up agin the wall. Timberline, any special way that you want
this little song and dance run off?"</p>

<p>There was no doubt that Carson Jimmy's good humor was
returning as he approached the moment of battle. Certainly the
little man had no possible doubt concerning his skill or the
outcome of the battle.</p>

<p>A grin began to flash on his face, appearing and disappearing
suddenly. He was like one who knows a grim and soul-filling
secret which involves the fates of many other men, but is a
secret unknown to them.</p>

<p>The attitude of Timberline, on the other hand, was grave and
sober. For once, the delight of battle seemed to have disappeared
from him.</p>

<p>It was not shining in his eyes when he answered the last
question by saying, "There's only one proper way to fight: stand
back to back; some one counts five; at every count we take a step
forward. At ten we turn and shoot; and&mdash;we pack the guns out
of sight, and not in our hands."</p>

<p>"That'll be hard on me," sneered Carson. "Me, I'm so slow on
the draw that it'll be mighty hard on me. You're a regular
lightning flash, when it comes to getting a Colt out into action,
ain't you?"</p>

<p>"I'm fast enough to beat you to the draw, Carson," said the
larger and younger man. "And I'm going to kill you today, with a
lot more pleasure than I ever had in any killing before
this!"</p>

<p>Carson Jimmy laughed. He was fairly quivering with a savage
eagerness.</p>

<p>"You're gonna put me out of the way, are you?"</p>

<p>"I am," said Timberline.</p>

<p>They were pictures of perfect self-confidence, and suddenly
the explanation came home to Ever with awe, and a cold tightening
around his heart. Here were two men who never had been matched,
one because of his union of strength and dexterity, the other
because of his uncanny craft of hand, which multiplied the force
of a small body.</p>

<p>If ever a swift and silent prayer went up from a human heart,
such a prayer rose now from Ever for the victory of Timberline.
It was not only that his uncle's life and death depended upon the
battle, but because Timberline himself had treated him with an
odd degree of kindness and consideration. He had been exploited
by the gunman, to be sure, but in a way that was bound to appeal
to his pride. Was it not for his sake, for instance, that
Timberline was now a prisoner in the hands of this deadly little
reptile of a man?</p>

<p>He could not tell which appeared to him the more
formidable&mdash;the tall dignity of Timberline, or the smaller,
feline deadliness of Carson. But on the whole, since his hope was
for Timberline, his fear was for him also. He made a larger
target for a bullet, for one thing!</p>

<p>They stood back to back, in the center of the room.
Timberline's face was beginning to shine; Carson's features were
rapidly contorting and relaxing and contorting again, like those
of a child engaged in the torture of some helpless creature.</p>

<p>"Ready?" snapped Carson.</p>

<p>Their hands were empty. They stood straight, as though
measuring, and Timberline was almost a head taller than the
other.</p>

<p>"Fargo!" exclaimed Carson Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Yeah, chief?" said Fargo, standing near.</p>

<p>"Got a gun?"</p>

<p>"Here it is."</p>

<p>"You stand there and count to five&mdash;while you count, you
watch."</p>

<p>I hear," said Fargo, gravely.</p>

<p>"If either one of us tries to turn and shoot before the five
is counted out, you plaster him with lead. Got that?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I understand," said Fargo, thrusting out his jaw.</p>

<p>He smirked a little in his turn. It was perfectly plain that
he would enjoy pumping lead into either of the great men, without
favor.</p>

<p>The whole gang was enjoying the party. One man was leering
with pleasure; a smile half brutal and half idiotic spread over
the mouth of another; the features of Big Al were puckered up as
though he himself were about to make the desperate effort; and
yonder was Mike, looking down at the floor with a bowed head, as
though the excitement had overmastered him and he dared not watch
what was about to happen.</p>

<p>"Start countin'!" commanded Carson Jimmy.</p>

<p>"One!" shouted Fargo, some pent-up force in him making the
word come with a roar.</p>

<p>The two took one step forward and paused, wavering a little to
keep in perfect balance, as though the next instant they were to
whirl and fire.</p>

<p>Then, steadily, rapidly, regularly, the count proceeded: "Two,
three, four&mdash;five!"</p>

<p>They turned as though a single force had jerked at them. The
guns in their hands flashed in low arcs. Timberline stood
straight. Carson Jimmy had doubled over as he wheeled, and with
one thunderclap the two guns exploded.</p>

<p>Timberline fell prone on the floor on his back, his arms cast
wide, his gun rattling to a distance. Carson Jimmy remained in
his crouch, his face tensed with brutal will to destroy. Slowly
he relaxed with a horrible smile.</p>

<p>A carnival of yelling began among the gangsters.</p>

<p>"Take 'em both!" shouted Carson. "I've showed em who's the
master. I've given 'em a fair chance for their lives, and now
they're gonna get the hell that I promised 'em! Is he dead? Is
Timber dead? I wish to heaven I had the sheriff and the kid here,
too. I'd pass 'em through the same route! I'd trim 'em, one by
one."</p>

<p>Fargo, on his knee beside the fallen man, suddenly looked up
and exclaimed, "He ain't dead. He's alive! Your slug just ran
astreak down the side of his head, that's all!"</p>

<p>And Timberline at that moment sat up, with blood streaming
down one side of his face.</p>

<p>"That's the way I wanted it," said Jimmy Carson. I knew that's
the way it'd turn out. He's down, but he ain't dead. He's gonna
die a lot slower than that. He's gonna die so's you boys can
remember him and the way he passed out."</p>

<p>He added, shouting the words: "He's gonna die lookin' at me
and knowing who his master is! Fargo!"</p>

<p>"Yeah?" said Fargo, pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Grab him, will you? Grab him and tie him and we'll start the
music on the pair of 'em, pronto!"</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch41" name="ch41"></a>XLI. &mdash; THE PURSUED</h2>

<p class="first">EVER came out of the trance which had held him
so long. He had to do something, and he knew what. Shooting
through the window would accomplish little good. Even if he
succeeded in potting both Al and Carson Jimmy, there would be
others remaining, and they would make short work of the two
captives. What he had to do was to disrupt the meeting of the
thugs and sweep them out of that cabin as a whirlwind swoops a
mass of dry leaves. He knew how to do the thing, and felt that he
had perhaps one chance in ten of succeeding.</p>

<p>He went around to the front of the shack. Half a dozen horses
stood there at the racks. And as he glanced them over, he thought
of the way the commanding head of the Red Pacer would have risen
above the rest of those silhouettes. But the Red Pacer was not
there. Half-breed Harry had taken him back toward the town. Half-breed Harry had received the horse as payment for services which
still were in part unrendered. If only his way through the night
were swift&mdash;if only he were pounding back on the return road
with the sheriff beside him and a few picked men!</p>

<p>But Ever could not wait. He tried the front door and it
yielded at once to his hand. As it opened a crack, he put his eye
close and scanned the interior. There was a flood of lantern
light which, to Ever, seemed brighter than the full light of the
sun. But no one else was in the room, so he pushed the door open
the rest of the way and closed it again behind him.</p>

<p>In the next room, he could hear Carson Jimmy saying, "Get
those two ramrods and heat 'em up in the fire. I'm gonna show you
gents that a ramrod can be used for cleanin' out something
besides gun-barrels! I'm gonna show you a whole lot of brand new
ideas. I learned some of 'em while I was in China!"</p>

<p>As he talked, he let bursts of laughter spring from his
lips.</p>

<p>Quick, snarling murmurs came from the other men. They were
ready to be beasts, every one of them, it appeared.</p>

<p>Then as Ever was turning from the door, he saw a rapid shadow
sweep toward the threshold of the other room, and he knew that
one of Jimmy's pack was about to come in on him.</p>

<p>He whirled about and went back toward the wall.</p>

<p>"Hey! Hello!" said the voice of a man, entering. "Who the
devil are"</p>

<p>"Hello, bo," said Ever, his back still turned.</p>

<p>And he took off his hat and hung it on a peg on the wall.</p>

<p>I thought" murmured the other.</p>

<p>But without completing what he had thought, he picked up
something from a corner and hurried out again, the thing he
carried clanking like an iron chain.</p>

<p>Ever took his hat off the wall again and paused a moment,
drawing in deep breaths. For, while his back was turned to the
stranger, he had literally felt the bullets tearing through his
ribs, through his heart.</p>

<p>Now he crossed the room, so that he could look through the
open door and into the adjoining chamber. Timberline was to be
the first to endure the music. They were trying him into a chair,
half throttling him with a rope that ran around his throat. The
full flare of the red firelight played in his face. But
Timberline's eyes were wide and composed. He had thought of death
often enough to confront it now unperturbably. Perhaps his calm
would be shaken later on. Every devilishness that Carson could
devise would be used to break him and make him howl for
mercy.</p>

<p>Clay Winton was out of sight. The back of big Al was seen as
he bent by the fire, adjusting something in it. One of the other
men was on his knees, fanning the fire. And the light washed out
from the hearth and receded as the fan passed rapidly back and
forth.</p>

<p>On the table lay the bag of the stolen treasure. On the table
stood two lanterns&mdash;and they were not in line! Even when
Ever moved as far over as the room permitted, the lanterns were
still out of line. A thin crack remained visible between them.
Did that mean that he would have to fire two shots to plunge the
room into darkness? Or if he placed one bullet with infinite
exactness, might it not shatter both chimneys and extinguish both
flames at the same time?</p>

<p>If so, there would remain only the crazy flicker and dance of
the firelight. With that, however, he would have to take his
chance.</p>

<p>He pulled a gun, leveled it with the nicest of aims, and
fired. At the same time, with his left hand he snatched the
lantern from the wall beside him and dashed it out. As he fired,
he was leaning forward to run, and already he was springing
forward when the bullet from his revolver smashed both the
lantern chimneys to bits. The farther room was left vaguely awash
with the jumping firelight, across which swayed the confused
shadows of men running blindly here and there in a wild
excitement.</p>

<p>Ever had spotted a big slicker lying across a chair near the
door. He caught it up as he ran, and bolting through the doorway,
he cast the slicker straight into the fireplace. In its fall, it
spread out its folds like the wings of a bird, so that the entire
light of the fire was muffled. The whole room was lost in
darkness.</p>

<p>Then Ever, springing to the table, caught the corner of the
treasure bag at the first grasp of his hand.</p>

<p>But the sharp, ringing voice of Carson Jimmy was cutting
through the air like bullets, "Ever! It's the Winton kid! Block
the windows. Block the door! Get the money sack"</p>

<p>Ever, wrenching on the sack, found that another grasp was
already on it. He struck out with the barrel of his gun, and
heard it ring on something hard. He heard a gasp, and the bag
came away in his hand.</p>

<p>Then a lunging form struck him and knocked him to the floor.
It had been but an accidental collision. The other, rolling
headlong, was cursing as he scrambled to his feet again. Some one
reached for the slicker that momentarily muffled the fire, and
snatched his burned hand away again with a yell of pain.</p>

<p>There had been one dim flicker of light, however, and it was
enough to show Ever that three men were swarming together in the
doorway. But that was his only way out of the room, if he wished
to make a quick exit, and so he went for it. He ran low, and then
made a long, skimming dive.</p>

<p>There was an excellent chance that he might ram his head or
shoulder against the jamb of the door. In fact, he struck his
head against some one's shin bone with such force that he thought
his skull was cracked.</p>

<p>Floundering bodies tumbled down on him. He crawled forward on
hands and knees, dragging the bag with a corner of it gripped in
his teeth. Then he was through that doorway and regaining his
feet.</p>

<p>A hand gripped his shoulder.</p>

<p>"I've got him!" yelled a voice at his ear.</p>

<p>He dropped to his knees again with such suddenness that the
blow which had been aimed at his head glanced harmlessly off the
side of his skull, and his pursuers tumbled headlong over
him.</p>

<p>Then he was on his feet again, running, reaching for the door.
Luck aided him there, for his hand found the latch. He snatched
the door open.</p>

<p>The star-spotted sky seemed to Ever to be brighter than a
bonfire as he leaped across the threshold into the night. A gun
cracked; two more roared behind him. He heard a double load of
buck-shot crash through the wall above his head. A bullet nipped
the lobe of his ear.</p>

<p>Then he crashed the door shut behind him and made for the
horses. The first horse would have to be the best horse and the
right horse, in a pinch like this.</p>

<p>He put away his revolver and snatched out his knife as he ran.
One sweep of the blade severed the lead rope by which the mustang
was tied, and the wild little beast was already spinning away
when Ever leaped for it.</p>

<p>His right hand caught in the mane. The mustang, beginning to
sprint away, took Ever vaulting forward with immense bounds. But
he managed to swing the treasure bag over the saddle-seat. The
next instant he was in the air and had hooked one foot in front
of the cantle.</p>

<p>So, like a springing panther, he clawed that fleeing beast in
the darkness and managed to clamber onto its back.</p>

<p>The branches of trees were sweeping perilously close to his
head, by this time. But he got hold of the reins, and with a
mighty pull bent the chin of the little horse back toward its
chest. Not even a mustang can pitch or bolt when his neck is
cramped in.</p>

<p>He was able, then, to guide the horse off to the right, until
he came out of the trees onto the blessed hardness of the open
road.</p>

<p>But two disasters faced him at once. The first was a pyramid
of fire that was trembling in the east, sure sign that the moon
was about to rise. The second was a dark rush of horsemen down
the road toward him.</p>

<p>He straightened out the mustang on the road toward town. Half-breed Harry and the sheriff with his posse should be on the way,
now, riding hard to get at the shack in the woods. Unless,
perhaps, Harry had simply taken the Red Pacer and gone his way,
content. That doubt sank the heart of Ever like a stone in
water.</p>

<p>He had something else to think about, a moment later. Fast and
true his mustang was legging it down the way toward town, but the
beat of hoofs behind was momentarily drawing nearer, and now the
voice of Carson Jimmy was screaming through the air like the
whistle of a hawk:</p>

<p>"We've got him! He's gone! He's gone!"</p>

<p>Ever looked back.</p>

<p>It was not easy to make out the forms of the riders, obscured
as they were against the darkness of the trees on both sides of
the road, but he saw fire flying under the hoofs of the leader,
and then he was able to see a small figure on a lofty mount.
Carson Jimmy. No one else would be so small, and no one else
would ride so like a bunched-up ape. Carson Jimmy was already in
the lead.</p>

<p>The road swept around a turn, and the long way opened straight
toward the pale, distant glimmering of the lights of the town.
But Ever knew that he could not reach them, now. Faster horses
were behind him. Oh, for the Red Pacer, to pick up and snatch him
away from fear on wings! Compared with the immense river of the
stallion's strength, this little mustang was a bobbing, jumping,
foolish rivulet.</p>

<p>But if the horse could not save him, how could his wits
serve?</p>

<p>Off to the left, the mountains rose jaggedly. Already their
heads were illumined like clouds by the rising moon. The tops of
the trees were glimmering with the pale light, also. Soon the
whole countryside would be awash with that bright silver flood,
and the pack could run him then by sight rather than by sound or
chance.</p>

<p>He twisted to the left, nevertheless. That was his best
chance. To get into the rough country and then to dodge away
through the crooked, sharpcut ravines.</p>

<p>He leaned over the mustang and called for the animal's best
speed. But that speed was not enough. When he looked back, it
seemed as though Carson Jimmy's horse was riderless, driving on
ahead as though an invisible devil were on it. Only by a second
glance could Ever see the small body of the man perched in the
saddle, twisting a little to the side.</p>

<p>He turned and fired&mdash;once, twice, again.</p>

<p>Yelling, mocking laughter answered him. Of course, riding at a
full gallop, he could not fire with any accuracy, through such
light as this.</p>

<p>A dense grove of trees opened before him. He drove his mustang
at the fence of closely growing tree trunks as though they were a
thin mist. He swung down low in the saddle, hooked his right foot
behind the saddle, took a strong grasp on the mane with his right
hand. The treasure bag he had already tied to some saddle
strings. Now he could swing down from the back of the mustang,
and be carried along like an Indian. He might be brushed off
against a tree trunk, but he would not be brained by the sweep of
branches close over the back of the horse.</p>

<p>That was how he entered the forest. And the tree trunks went
past him with rapid, rushing sounds, like the strokes of fans in
his face.</p>

<p>The trees thinned out. He pulled himself back into the saddle
and struck off at a sharp angle to the left, again. Behind him he
heard the distinct impact of some man who had come to
grief&mdash;the horrible sound of flesh and breaking bones struck
against some solid target&mdash;and a yell was choked and gone
before it was half uttered.</p>

<p>Then he came out on the farther side of the trees, and saw no
rider whatever near him.</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch42" name="ch42"></a>XLII. &mdash; THROUGH
MOONLIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">THE canyon opened before Ever like a dark flume
through which flowed the shadowy gold of safety. He rushed the
tiring mustang down the little ravine, knowing that every instant
gained now would be worth an hour hereafter.</p>

<p>But when he was deep in the throat of the gap he heard the
iron ring of hoofs down the passage, and turning, he saw by the
increasing gleam of the moonlight the running of a great horse in
pursuit, and the little, ape-like figure on the back of the
monster. Jimmy Carson again&mdash;and well behind Jimmy came the
horde with a sweep. As they entered the shadows of the pass, they
brightened it with a wild yell that pierced the brain and the
soul of Ever.</p>

<p>He could not shake them off with a headlong flight. That was
clear. And so he rode like mad, now, taking the last strength of
the mustang with spur and quirt. He took the first turn to the
left again, right toward the face of the mountain. It was a sharp
turn. The walls of the ravine shoaled away. He saw before him how
the valley pinched out to nothing&mdash;there was only a jagged
watercourse marked out on the side of the mountain above him. It
came down like a fantastic ladder.</p>

<p>Ever untied the treasure sack as he rode, gripped it in one
hand, swung free from the mustang, and hit the ground running. A
vigorous slash from his quirt sent the weary little horse
scampering down the first ravine that opened on the right. Ever
flung himself into the shrubbery at the base of the cliff,
waiting, drawing his breath hard.</p>

<p>The rout of the pursuit came into view instantly, the little
monkey form crouched on the big racer, and then others speeding
frantically to catch up with their master. Al, riding with a bold
confidence, Ever particularly marked. And the sight of him
brought back into his mind the thought of the two prisoners in
the distant shack. Surely Carson had left in such haste that he
had not ordered their execution. He would not cheat himself of
seeing their slow suffering until they were dead. He must,
surely, have appointed one or two guards as he went off to
chastise Ever.</p>

<p>So hope grew stronger in the heart of Ever as he saw the last
of the riders swing out of view. They had come so close to him
that the reek of sweating horseflesh was now in the air.</p>

<p>He started to climb, in haste. The way was easy enough for him
now. In a number of places the water had gouged away the rock
very deeply. In others, the groove was more shallow, and he was
in constant danger of slipping from his hold. From a safe coign,
he looked down and saw the pursuit scattered through the ravines
below him, half in shadow, half gleaming in the moonlight. They
went rapidly here and there, searching. They had his abandoned
horse, now. And how long would it be before they stopped hunting
among the crevices and the holes in the ground and looked up
toward the ragged face of the cliff?</p>

<p>When he started to climb again, he gained height rapidly. The
work was more and more difficult, but as he gained a position
near the brink of the cliff, pausing with both hands occupied and
the treasure sack hanging from his teeth, he looked down again
and saw a whole body of riders sweeping past the base of the
cliff to the left. In a moment they were out of sight.</p>

<p>At that distance, they seemed far too small to be worthy of
his attention. Then, as he hauled himself up on the brow of the
cliff, he saw that he was on the great shoulder of the mountain,
with scattering trees standing here and there, and an outcropping
of big boulders that must have rolled down from the summit high
above. He could see, on that upper slope, how timber ceased
growing, and how the great snowcap glittered in the moonlight,
like the pyramidal head of an iceberg afloat in the midnight sky.
To his left the rocky ground rose rapidly. To his right it
descended toward a narrow ravine that split the mountainside in
two. Beyond the ravine, a bare sweep of rock and scattered stones
went upward again.</p>

<p>He was safe. And in his safety, he groaned aloud with relief.
It seemed right that he should be standing up here on the crown
of the world, looking down on the small sections of the badlands
beneath him.</p>

<p>Then he heard a strange sound rolling toward him. At first he
thought it must be the thunder of an unseen storm approaching
among the mountain heights. Then his ear told him it was the
distant beating of horses' hoofs. The animals were being ridden
up on his left.</p>

<p>He could understand at once. They had seen him from beneath,
and one among them had known a horse trail they could follow up
the height. Should he turn and try to climb down again as he had
come?</p>

<p>No, they would soon be at the verge of the cliff, and then
they could shoot him off the face of the rock at their leisure.
Neither was there any safety for him among the scattering trees
that extended above him toward the snow-line. There was only one
hope, and that was a small one.</p>

<p>He turned and fled toward the ravine on his right, the
sharpness of the slope giving gigantic length to his strides. As
he ran, he saw the slender trunk of a dead tree lying beside the
gap. The branches were broken away from it. It looked as though
it must have been uprooted far up the slope, having been trimmed
off by the force of its fall as it rolled down the rocks. Toward
that tree he went.</p>

<p>The ravine's mouth was a good thirty feet across. The tree
might measure ten feet more. If only he could throw it across the
gap, it would serve him, rotten as the wood was, as some sort of
bridge.</p>

<p>He grasped the base of the trunk and lifted. But his hands
slid away from their hold, and the mass was not stirred. Then he
sprang to the slender tip of the trunk, lifted this easily, and
walked down toward the root, shoving up the weight with both
hands. The burden grew monstrous as he proceeded. Finally, he
could no longer endure the pressure on his arms. He had to get
his shoulder under the trunk and inch along, bit by bit,
thrusting the wavering tip of the tree higher and higher against
the moonlit sky. And so, at last, the weight eased, suddenly.</p>

<p>He looked up and saw the top of the tree swing through a rapid
arc. It was upright, then it whipped forward, while he guided the
fall with all the straining power in his body.</p>

<p>Right across the ravine fell the trunk, with a crash of
splintering wood. Somewhere in its length it was fractured; but
he could not mark the exact spot of the break.</p>

<p>A yell, far behind him, struck cold terror through his heart,
and as he turned, he saw the big, familiar silhouette of Al ride
over the edge of the slope and come racing toward him with a wild
Indian yell.</p>

<p>There was the possibility of missing. To miss his target now,
meant to die horribly, a little later, in the hands of Jimmy
Carson and his men. So Ever stood up straight, measured the
distance with one glance, then whipped up his revolver and
fired.</p>

<p>The horse ran straight on toward him, with Al leaning sidewise
from the saddle&mdash;sidewise and toppling.</p>

<p>He struck the ground not ten yards from Ever, and rolled the
rest of the way, his arms and legs flung loosely about, until he
skidded to a halt at Ever's very feet. The mustang, managing to
turn at the last instant, galloped furiously back up the
slope.</p>

<p>Ever gave one glance at Al's torn, shattered, red-blurred
face. Then he picked up the tarpaulin bag and hurled it far
before him, across the gaping ravine.</p>

<p>He mounted the heavy trunk of the tree, changed his mind, and
used a priceless second to jerk off his boots. Far away, sounds
of yelling broke over the rim of the hill in a sudden shout that
told him what he must do. There was no time to balance himself
and creep forward step by step. He had to take that bridge on the
run.</p>

<p>So he sprang forward as the bullets began to sing through the
air. Under him some seventh sense showed him the white of the
flying water, a hundred yards sheer down; the voice of the stream
came up to him on a dolorous and mournful note.</p>

<p>He fairly flew over the narrow, rocking bridge.</p>

<p>And it was well that he went at full speed, for suddenly the
trunk of the tree gave under him with a sharp snapping sound.
Only the speed of his going carried him over the breaking place
in safety. Beneath him, now, there was the narrowing trunk as it
approached the other brink. It seemed to him that he dared not
look down; that his flying feet were finding their hold by
instinct which would fail the next step and send him hurtling
down into the abyss.</p>

<p>And then he made the last long leap and gained the safety of
the ground beyond. Only as he leaned to snatch up the bag of
money did he give a glance behind that showed him the tree,
breaking now under its own weight, less than halfway across, and
sagging down rapidly. He saw, in the same glance, the monkey-like
form of little Carson Jimmy, rushing down the slope on his huge
horse, firing as he came. All the rest of the riders were
sweeping down the way.</p>

<p>The width of that ravine was only a stop-gap of a moment. The
guns of the pursuit, once they were steadied, would soon pick off
Ever as he ran, unless luck were with him.</p>

<p>He ran up that slope like a snipe, dodging this way and that
to spoil the aim of the enemy. He ran with his head down and his
feet flying furiously. And then it seemed as though a club were
raised and that he heard the swish above his head. A violent blow
struck the base of his skull; the face of the mountain slope
rushed up against him, and the moonlit world twinkled once and
went out.</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch43" name="ch43"></a>XLIII. &mdash; THE END OF
CARSON</h2>

<p class="first">THE very force with which he fell shocked Ever
back to his senses. And the yells of Jimmy Carson's men helped
him suddenly to his feet, with the tarpaulin bag slung across his
shoulder. He had been flattened by the impact of a glancing
bullet, that was all. But before he had taken three steps, a
second shot smashed through the ribs on his right side.</p>

<p>As he toppled, he managed to throw himself behind the shelter
of a projecting rock, where he lay curled up, his head down, such
agony burning and trembling in him, like flame, that he was sure
that this was death.</p>

<p>Blood soaked through his clothes. It began to trickle into the
hollow of the rock, a sickening pool.</p>

<p>He pulled off his coat and his shirt, and every move filled
his body with perfect anguish. He wanted to call out to the enemy
that he surrendered, and that they could have the money bag, so
that he might die in peace. But he knew that that was folly. He
had made too much trouble for Carson Jimmy; and on the opposite
slope lay the dead and battered body of big Al. They would
contrive in some way to make him pay for this night's work, if he
ventured to give up.</p>

<p>He could hear their voices as they called to one another,
busily at work.</p>

<p>Ever struggled to make a bandage for himself. He had to use
his left hand almost entirely, for his whole right side was
almost paralyzed by the effects of the wound. He managed to cut
up his shirt and his undershirt. The bandage was big and clumsy,
but strong. And he had to use its strength, for the flow of the
blood must be stopped.</p>

<p>He got hold of a shard of loose stone, a long and narrow
splinter, and twisted this into the bandage to draw it tight. The
pain that he had felt before was nothing, compared with this
torment. He felt the broken ribs crush in under the pressure. His
eyes bulged outward from his head as though the constriction had
been about his forehead. But he had to keep twisting until the
flow of the blood had been stopped. As for the fierce fire of
pain, that would have to be endured. He might laugh at the memory
of that, another day. But this was a different matter, this
dribbling away of his blood. It was the loss of life itself, bit
by bit.</p>

<p>Finally that leakage was stopped completely, though the grip
of the bandage was so powerful that he could barely breathe; and
with each breath that he drew, red swords of torment were thrust
through and through his body.</p>

<p>When he had finished, he lay gasping. Every time he drew in
his breath or expelled it, a sound formed in his throat and
shuddered against his teeth. Nausea darkened his eyes.</p>

<p>But he looked out around the corner of the rock and saw the
preparations that were going forward. The wits of the great
Carson Jimmy had found the easy way to re-bridge the gaping mouth
of the ravine. Already, his men had felled a pair of tall,
slender saplings, and with their horses they had dragged the
trees down to the verge of the caon. Now they walked one of the
trunks into the air and let it fall. And turning, they laid hands
on the second to complete the bridge.</p>

<p>And Ever? Well, he had three bullets left in his revolver, and
by shooting from a rest, even with his left hand, he ought to be
able to hit a target at such point-blank range. Carson
Jimmy&mdash;he was to be the mark for the gun.</p>

<p>In the meantime, surely Half-breed Harry had brought the men
of the law out to the shack. If, by the grace of good fortune,
they were able to overcome the guards which had been left there
by Carson before the latter butchered the prisoners, then both
Timberline and Clay Winton would certainly urge the posse to hunt
for Ever.</p>

<p>But how would they know the trail? What could possibly bring
them over the twists and the changes of the route that Ever had
followed? When he considered these difficulties, he accepted his
fate. He might be able to kill Carson Jimmy. But he had better
save his last shot to end his own life before he fell into the
hands of the savages.</p>

<p>When he had made that calculation, he had two bullets to use.
Carson Jimmy, the instant the second tree had fallen beside the
first, making a narrow but perfectly safe bridge, stepped out
upon it, his arms stretched out to the sides to help him
balance.</p>

<p>And Ever, twisting himself to the side, steadied his revolver
with his left hand. It seemed no hand at all, the weapon was so
unfamiliar in the grasp of it. And with every pulse of his heart
the agony shook the nerves of arm and hand.</p>

<p>But he drew a bead as well as he could, and then fired
twice.</p>

<p>Carson Jimmy leaped backward from his bridge, and raced for
cover. His whole party disappeared almost instantly, behind rocks
and brush, and with a storm of lead they searched the rock which
was Ever Winton's fort.</p>

<p>After a time, the firing ended. But still not one of the crew
showed himself. What would they do? They could not guess, of
course, that his ammunition had been reduced to a single bullet.
They must have considered him as a helpless fugitive, lying
behind the rock weltering in his blood, and rapidly dying. They
had driven two bullets into him. They had seen him knocked down
twice by their lead, and therefore they had reason to expect that
the fight was smacked out of him.</p>

<p>So Ever managed to smile as he peered cautiously around the
rock.</p>

<p>If only one of those two bullets had clipped through the body
of Jimmy Carson! But the man had darted away as though there was
nothing at all the matter with him.</p>

<p>The silence continued. Then voices rose in a sudden dispute.
The cry of Jimmy Carson came piercingly above the wrangling:</p>

<p>"I'll shoot off the head of the dirty cur that tries to stop
me. I'm going across and finish him&mdash;or he's gonna finish
me!"</p>

<p>And Jimmy Carson appeared from behind a big boulder, vain
hands reaching after him.</p>

<p>He stood up straight and walked straight down toward the
narrow bridge that had been felled across the ravine. He held a
Colt in his right hand. In his thin face the evil lips bared his
teeth. And Ever knew, suddenly, that his aim had not been so
wrong, after all. Death was already dealing with Carson Jimmy,
but with the last of his life he was determined to close with the
man who would soon be responsible for his death.</p>

<p>So he stepped out onto the frail little bridge and moved
straight on until he came to the center of it. It seemed as
though a strong wind struck him there, for his body swayed,
suddenly. He put out his hands to save his balance; then his
knees crumpled under his weight, and he lurched out to the
side.</p>

<p>Even as he fell, the savage fighting instinct was uppermost in
the little tiger. He fired one last shot that smashed right
against the forehead of the rock that shielded Ever Winton. Then
he dropped out of view.</p>

<p>One deep, hoarse shout came from his men. After that, they
began to spread out. Ever could see them dodge from rock to rock,
from tree to tree, extending themselves far out to the sides. He
could understand the reason for this. The moon, climbing into the
zenith, gave fairly good light for shooting, and the rifles of
the men on the wings should be able to prevent Ever from showing
himself at either side or above the rock that protected him.
Under cover of that rifle fire, other men could cross the bridge
and come hand to hand with the enemy.</p>

<p>It was a good plan. It was so good a plan, in fact, that Ever
at that instant surrendered his last hope. That was when he heard
a louder trumpet than was ever blown in brass or iron&mdash;the
neigh of the Red Pacer echoing from the top of the slope behind
Carson Jimmy's men. Ever, venturing a single glance over his
rock, had a fleeting glimpse of the great stallion on the brow of
the hill, against the moonlit sky, and of a short, squat rider
who held the Pacer on a lead and rode a smaller mustang.</p>

<p>The half-breed? It could be no other person. And who else
could have followed, by moonlight, such a trail? Was he the
first, with others behind him? If there were more, they would be
excellently situated on the brow of the slope for blowing
Carson's men down into the ravine. But suppose it was the half-breed alone?</p>

<p>One glance had been all that Ever dared to venture, and even
that brought three rifle bullets whining through the air close
about his rock. He lay back, trembling with excited hope.</p>

<p>Only his sense of hearing could tell him what was going on.
That was enough. He heard the crackling of rifles. He heard out
of the distance a single weapon answering. As though Half-breed
Harry had taken shelter among the rocks and was fighting the gang
single-handed.</p>

<p>Well, there could be only one ending to a battle where the
odds were so vastly against Harry. Perhaps the Indian was keeping
up the fight with the knowledge that more friends were constantly
moving toward him from the rear, ready to take up the battle? No,
out of the past Ever could remember all the dogged, bulldog
determination of Harry, and from the first that strange desire of
his to accomplish something for Ever and to save him from harm.
Now he was alone on the brow of the hill, and he would stay there
until he was shot down or until some miracle saved his protg.
Ever knew all this as certainly as if he had been able to look
into the breed's inmost mind.</p>

<p>And the Red Pacer was up there, too&mdash;perhaps with the
scent of his master blowing dimly to his nostrils? There was the
engine that might pick up Ever and sweep him away from the
danger, and thereby release Harry from his self-imposed task.</p>

<p>Ever, stretched out upon his back behind the boulders, sent
the piercing signal whistle through the air, again and again.
Then he waited.</p>

<p>There was an instant of pause, when all the guns were still,
and then a yell of surprise from many throats, and the ringing of
ironshod hoofs on the rocks.</p>

<p>Right up from behind his rock, forgetful of the danger, Ever
rose to his knees and saw a sight worth dying for. It was the Red
Pacer, shooting down the farther slope, swaying with speed,
gathering momentum. Right at the ravine he aimed himself, then
lifted from the farther side and hurtled through the air, with
the reins tossing above his head, his mane flying, looking hunger
than life against the sky.</p>

<p>Half-breed Harry was firing rapidly from the opposite slope,
no doubt to hold the attention of the enemy and to interfere with
their aim as they opened on Ever and the horse.</p>

<p>But here was the Pacer beside the rock, all at once, halting
himself on skidding hoofs, snorting and shaking his magnificent
head as Ever grasped the stirrup leather and drew himself up the
animal's side. He flung his leg with a last effort over the
saddle. And like a great, smooth-flowing stream, the Red Pacer
swept away, with the angry bullets beginning to hum about
him.</p>

<p>Ever lay stretched on the back of the horse, with the treasure
sack dragging heavily down from his left hand. He gave one look
to the rear as the Pacer carried him over the ridge to safety,
and that look showed him a glimpse of Harry, scuttling away as
fast as his little mustang would carry him.</p>

<p>There was life enough in Ever to tie the sack to the saddle
strings and then to cut off the reins and bind himself to the
stallion. For a touch of the hand or a spoken word would be
guidance enough as he headed the horse for the town. Then he
entered into an eternity composed of waves of cold, bright
moonshine and of incredible agony, contrasted with other waves of
thickest darkness, as he fainted and returned to life again and
again.</p>

<p>Twice he awakened to find the horse standing still, the way
lost. Twice, desperation came over him as he shouted wildly to
the stallion and roused himself long enough to discover the right
way once more.</p>

<p>Then, after those ages of agony, he heard the hoofs of the
horse slumping through the softness of deep dust, and the smell
of dust was in his nostrils. He roused, and found that he was
surrounded by spinning lights. He told himself that the lights
could not be sweeping around the horizon in this wild manner.
They must be fixed in place; he was simply dizzy.</p>

<p>Voices came out to him. He saw faces that wavered up and down
and began to spin like the lights. Then he closed his eyes. Hands
fell on him and lifted him from the horse. Men were speaking his
name.</p>

<p>"Take me to Dolly Gray," he begged them. "Take that saddle bag
along with me. Dolly Gray has all the brains in the world. She'll
know what to do."</p>

<p>They carried him, and their hands seemed to grip nothing but
his wounds.</p>

<p>"He's talking, but he's a dead man," he heard a man saying.
"He's gotta be dead. Ten men would be dead, from the dose he's
had."</p>

<p>"Take me to Dolly Gray," he kept saying.</p>

<p>A small, faint voice was dinning at his ears, making one sound
over and over again. He rallied his failing senses and made out
that the voice was saying:</p>

<p>"I'm here, Ever. You're going to be all right. You're here
with me."</p>

<p>That was Dolly, speaking, and when he heard that he began to
relax. He opened his eyes. He said:</p>

<p>"Stop dancing around, and stand still. Stop swinging the
lights, somebody. I want to see Dolly."</p>

<p>Everything stopped, for an instant, and in that instant he saw
her face, close to his. Her eyes were wild and her mouth was
pinched. She looked older by years.</p>

<p>Then everything began to spin again, and he had to close his
eyes.</p>

<p>"I want the sheriff," he said.</p>

<p>"The sheriff's here," said Dolly.</p>

<p>A man's voice rumbled, at that, but Ever could not understand
the words. Only the voice of the girl cut faintly into his
consciousness.</p>

<p>"There's the saddle bag," said Ever. "Uncle Clay was returning
the money to that damned bank. I hope the coin chokes 'em! It
isn't my job. I'm just finishing the errand for Uncle Clay. You
understand?"</p>

<p>"I understand," said the girl. "Everybody understands
everything. You don't have to talk, Ever."</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Ever. "Somewhere out in the hills the crooks are
chasing Harry, the half-breed. He brought up the Pacer for me,
and he fought the whole gang till I got away. You've got to send
out men&mdash;send out everybody."</p>

<p>Her voice was saying something, over and over again.</p>

<p>"Harry is here. Everybody's here. Everything is all right,
Ever. Save your strength. I'm going to take care of you. We're
all going to take care of you."</p>

<p>"Uncle Clay and Timberline&mdash;what happened to them? Tell
me what happened to them?"</p>

<p>"They're here. Open your eyes, Ever. You'll see your uncle.
Don't you hear his voice? Can't you see him?"</p>

<p>He opened his eyes and stared, but everything was spinning
worse than before. "I can't see anything," he said. "Give me your
hand, Dolly, will you? Keep a good, tight hold&mdash;and&mdash;I
won't be able to&mdash;to get away."</p>

<hr>


<h2><a id="ch44" name="ch44"></a>XLIV. &mdash; ALL THE LUCK IN
ONE ROOM</h2>

<p class="first">IN fact, Dolly Gray kept hold of Ever night and
day until the fever had burned itself out of his infected wounds
and he lay white as a bone and thin as a mummy, looking weakly
out at the world, but with perfect content. For the girl was
always sitting between him and the window, and through the window
itself he could see the Red Pacer grazing, with the forested and
snow-topped mountains as a fitting background. And sometimes the
great horse came and thrust his fine head in over the window
sill. In such moments, sometimes, Ever and the girl and the horse
were a silent trio of happiness.</p>

<p>Clay Winton came in and out every day. He would sit whittling,
during the short intervals when Dolly Gray was off duty. He told
Ever the story of the Green River Bank, and of how the bank
officials would not put up a case against Clay, since the money
had been returned almost intact. Neither had the sheriff any
desire to make the arrest, and the district attorney felt that he
would be a fool if he opened a case against a man whom no jury in
the country would convict, no matter what the evidence might
be.</p>

<p>For the money was safely back in the bank, and, as for
anything that the Wintons ever had done to bring the law on them,
they had more than made up for it by wiping out of existence
Carson Jimmy.</p>

<p>Ever would never forget how his father and mother came to him.
Harry Lawson was in the room at the time, sitting as usual with
his hat on his head and silence in his throat.</p>

<p>Ever's father stood in the doorway, hesitant, but his mother
brushed past, and came quickly to the bedside. She knelt by it
and took her son's face between her hands.</p>

<p>I was wrong&mdash;always. I was wrong clean from the start,
Ever," she said.</p>

<p>She began to weep.</p>

<p>He put out his hand and gathered both of hers at the
wrists.</p>

<p>"You weren't wrong," he said. "You were dead right. Only, I've
found enough luck to last me the rest of my days, I think."</p>

<p>"What luck, Ever?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"Dolly," he said, "come over here, will you? Mother, here's my
luck."</p>

<p>At that, Mrs. Winton broke into more violent weeping than
ever.</p>

<p>"Hell! I better get out of here," said Harry Lawson.</p>

<p>He rose, tugged his old felt hat tighter on his head, and went
to the door, where he collided with a tall man who wore a strip
of bandage around his head.</p>

<p>"What's all the noise in here, Ever?" called the tall
fellow.</p>

<p>"Hey, Timber," said Ever. "Come in here, will you?"</p>

<p>"What's it all about?" asked Timberline.</p>

<p>"It's just this. I'm collecting all my luck together in one
room, and you're one of the best parts of it, so I want you in
here along with the rest."</p>

<p>Timberline's teeth flashed as he laughed in answer:</p>

<p>"It takes six people to give you luck, partner. But you've
been enough luck all by yourself to do for the whole six."</p>

<p>Afterwards, Clay Winton got out of the room and sat on top of
the pasture fence, talking with Harry Lawson while the half-breed
stared at the stallion and Clay whittled at a white stick of soft
pine.</p>

<p>"Ever gave you the stallion back, I hear," said Clay.</p>

<p>"That Pacer?" answered Harry. "I won't have him. He'd rather
eat me than hay. So I've given him back to Ever."</p>

<p>Clay Winton looked sharply aside.</p>

<p>"Harry," he said, "what the devil has been in you? At first, I
thought you hated Ever. Then you give him your horse and you
saved his neck for him."</p>

<p>"There was no devil in Harry," said the breed. "But he saw the
devil in the horse and he saw the devil in Ever. He liked both
those devils, but two devils together make a pretty hot trail,
Harry thinks. He wanted to keep them apart; then he saw they
belonged together. A long time ago," concluded the breed, "Harry
looked at Ever and saw something that made him feel young again.
After that, he didn't want Ever to go to hell on a horse."</p>
