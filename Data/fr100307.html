  <p class="poem"
     style="margin-left:10%">Green, ah greener than emeralds are, tree-tops
     beckon the dhows to land,<br>
  White, oh whiter than diamonds are, blue waves burst on the amber sand,<br>
  And nothing is fairer than Zanzibar from the Isles o' the West to the
  Marquesand.<br>
  <br>
  I was old when the world was wild with youth.<br>
  (All love was lawless then!)<br>
  Since 'Venture's birth from ends of earth<br>
  I ha' called the sons of men,<br>
  And their women have wept the ages out<br>
  In travail sore to know<br>
  What lure of opiate art can leach<br>
  Along bare seas from reef to beach<br>
  Until from port and river reach<br>
  The fever'd captains go.<br>
  <br>
  Red, oh redder than red lips are my flowers that nod in the blazing noon,<br>
  Blue, oh bluer than maidens' eyes are the breasts o' my waves in the young
  monsoon,<br>
  And there are cloves to smell, and musk, and lemon trees, and cinnamon.<br>
  <br>
  &mdash;from <i>The Njo Hapa* Song</i></p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The words <i>njo hapa!</i> in the Kiswahili tongue are
  the equivalent of "come hither!" Author's footnote. ]</p><br>

  <p class="first">ESTIMATES of ease and affluence vary with the point of view.
  While his older brother lived, Monty had continued in his element, a cavalry
  officer, his combined income and pay ample for all that the Bombay side of
  India might require of an English gentleman. They say that a finer polo
  player, a steadier shot on foot at a tiger, or a bolder squadron leader never
  lived.</p>

  <p>But to Monty's infinite disgust his brother died childless. It is
  divulging no secret that the income that passed with the title varied between
  five and seven thousand pounds a year, according as coal was high, and
  tenants prosperous or not&mdash;a mere miserable pittance, of course, for the
  Earl of Montdidier and Kirkudbrightshire; so that all his ventures, and
  therefore ours, had one avowed end&mdash;shekels enough to lift the mortgages
  from his estates.</p>

  <p>Five generations of soldiers had blazed the Montdidier fame on battle-
  grounds, to a nation's (and why not the whole earth's) benefit, without
  replenishing the family funds, and Monty (himself a confirmed and convinced
  bachelor) was minded when his own time should come to pass the title along to
  the next in line together with sufficient funds to support its dignity.</p>

  <p>To us&mdash;even to Yerkes, familiar with United States merchant kings
  &mdash;he seemed with his thirty thousand dollars a year already a gilded
  Croesus. He had ample to travel on, and finance prospecting trips. We never
  lacked for working capital, but the quest (and, including Yerkes, we were as
  keen as he) led us into strange places.</p>

  <p>So behold him&mdash;a privy councilor* of England if you please&mdash;
  lounging in the lazaretto&dagger; of Zanzibar, clothed only in slippers,
  underwear and a long blue dressing-gown. We three others were dressed the
  same, and because it smacked of official restraint we objected noisily; but
  Monty did not seem to mind much. He was rather bored, but unresentful.</p>

  <p>[* <i>privy councilor</i>&mdash;a member of the Privy Council of the
  British sovereign that until the 17th century was the supreme legislative
  body, that now consists of cabinet ministers ex officio and others appointed
  for life, and that has no important function except through its Judicial
  Committee, which in certain cases acts as a supreme appellate court in the
  Commonwealth. <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/10/P0571000.html"><i>The
  American Heritage Dictionary</i></a>. ]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[&dagger; <i>lazaretto</i>&mdash;hospital treating
  contagious diseases; also: a building or ship used as a quarantine station;
  also a storage space between the decks of a ship. <i><a href=
  "http://www.bartleby.com/61/1/L0080100.html">The American Heritage
  Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>A French steamer had put us ashore in quarantine, with the grim word
  cholera against us, and although our tale of suffering and Monty's rank,
  insured us a friendly reception, the port health authorities elected to be
  strict and we were given a nice long lazy time in which to cool our heels and
  order new clothes. (Guns, kit, tents, and all but what we stood in had gone
  to the bottom with the German cholera ship from whose life-boat the French
  had rescued us.)</p>

  <p>"Keeping us all this time in this place, is sheer tyranny!" grumbled
  Yerkes. "If any one wants my opinion, they're afraid we'd talk if they let us
  out&mdash;more afraid of offending Germans than they are of cholera!
  Besides&mdash;any fool could know by now we're not sick!"</p>

  <p>"There might be something in that," admitted Monty.</p>

  <p>"I'd send for the U.S. Consul and sing the song out loud, but for you!"
  Yerkes added.</p>

  <p>Monty nodded sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"Dashed good of you, Will, and all that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>"You English are so everlastingly afraid of seeming to start trouble,
  you'll swallow anything rather than talk!"</p>

  <p>"As a government, perhaps yes," admitted Monty. "As a people, I fancy not.
  As a people we vary."</p>

  <p>"You vary in that respect as much as sardines in a can! I traveled once
  all the way from London to Glasgow alone in one compartment with an
  Englishman. Talk? My, we were garrulous! I offered him a newspaper,
  cigarettes, matches, remarks on the weather suited to his brand of
  intelligence&mdash;(that's your sole national topic of talk between
  strangers!)&mdash;and all he ever said to me was 'Haw-ah!' I'll bet he was
  afraid of seeming to start trouble!"</p>

  <p>"He didn't start any, did he?" asked Monty.</p>

  <p>"Pretty nearly he did! I all but bashed him over the bean with the
  newspaper the third time he said 'haw-ah!'"</p>

  <p>Monty laughed. Fred Oakes was busy across the room with his most amazing
  gift of tongues, splicing together half-a-dozen of them in order to talk with
  the old lazaretto attendant, so he heard nothing; otherwise there would have
  been argument.</p>

  <p>"Then it would have been you, not he who started trouble," said I, and
  Yerkes threw both hands up in a gesture of despair.</p>

  <p>"Even you're afraid of starting something!" He stared at both of us with
  an almost startled expression, as if he could not believe his own verdict,
  yet could not get away from it. "Else you'd give the <i>Bundesrath</i> story
  to the papers! That German skipper's conduct ought to be bruited round the
  world! You said you'd do it. You promised us! You told the man to his face
  you would!"</p>

  <p>"Now," said Monty, "you've touched on another national habit."</p>

  <p>"Which one?" Yerkes demanded.</p>

  <p>"Dislike of telling tales out of school. The man's dead. His ship's at the
  bottom. The tale's ended. What's the use? Besides&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Ah! You've another reason! Spill it!"</p>

  <p>"As a privy councilor, y'know, and all that sort of thing&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Same story! Afraid of starting something!"</p>

  <p>"The Germans&mdash;'specially their navy men&mdash;drink to what they call
  <i>Der Tag</i> y'know&mdash;the day when they shall dare try to tackle
  England. We all know that. They're planning war, twenty years from now
  perhaps, that shall give them all our colonies as well as India and Egypt.
  They're so keen on it they can't keep from bragging. Great Britain, on the
  other hand, hasn't the slightest intention of fighting if war can be avoided;
  so why do anything meanwhile to increase the tension? Why send broadcast a
  story that would only arouse international hatred? That's their method. Ours
  &mdash;I mean our government's&mdash;is to give hatred a chance to die down.
  If our papers got hold of the <i>Bundesrath</i> story they'd make a deuce of
  a noise, of course."</p>

  <p>"If your government's so sure Germany is planning war," objected Yerkes,
  "why on earth not force war, and feed them full of it before they're
  ready"</p>

  <p>"Counsel of perfection," laughed Monty. "Government's responsible to the
  Common&mdash;Commons to the people&mdash;people want peace and plenty. No.
  Your guess was good. We are in here while the government at home squares the
  newspaper men."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to tell me your British government controls the
  press?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly. Seeing 'em&mdash;putting it up to 'em straight&mdash;asking 'em
  politely. They're public-spirited, y'know. Hitting 'em with a club would be
  another thing. It's an easy-going nation, but kings have been sorry they
  tried force. Did you never hear of a king who used force against American
  colonies?"</p>

  <p>"Good God! So they keep you&mdash;an earl&mdash;a privy councilor &mdash;a
  retired colonel of regulars in good standing&mdash;under lock and key in this
  pest-house while they bribe the press not to tell the truth about some
  Germans and start trouble?"</p>

  <p>"Not exactly" said Monty.</p>

  <p>"But here you are!"</p>

  <p>"I preferred to remain with my party."</p>

  <p>"You moan they'd have let you out and kept us in?"</p>

  <p>"They'd have phrased it differently, but that's about what it would have
  amounted to. I have privileges."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm jiggered!"</p>

  <p>"I rather suspect it's not so bad as that," said Monty. "You're with
  friends in quarantine, Will!"</p>

  <p>For a quarantine station in the tropics it was after all not such a bad
  place. We could hear the crooning of lazy rollers on the beach, and what
  little sea-breeze moved at all came in to us through iron-barred windows. The
  walls were of coral, three feet thick. So was the roof. The wet red-tiled
  floor made at least an impression of coolness, and the fresh green foliage of
  an enormous mango tree, while it obstructed most of the view, suggested
  anything but durance vile. From not very far away the aromatic smell of a
  clove warehouse located us, not disagreeably, at the farther end of one of
  Sinbad's journeys, and the birds in the mango branches cried and were
  colorful with hues and notes of merry extravagance. Zanzibar is no parson's
  paradise&mdash;nor the center of much high society. It reeks of unsavory
  history as well as of spices. But it has its charms, and the Arabs love
  it.</p>

  <p>It had Fred Oakes so interested that he had forgotten his concertina
  &mdash;his one possession saved from shipwreck, for which he had offered to
  fight the whole of Zanzibar one-handed rather than have it burned.</p>

  <p>("Damnation! it has silver reeds&mdash;it's an English top-hole one
  &mdash;a wonder!")</p>

  <p>So the doctors who are kind men in the main disinfected it twice, once on
  the French liner that picked us out of the <i>Bundesrath's</i> boat, and
  again in Zanzibar; and with the stench of lord-knew-what zealous chemical
  upon it he had let it lie unused while he picked up Kiswahili and talked by
  the hour to a toothless, wrinkled very black man with a touch of Arab in his
  breeding, and a deal of it in his brimstone vocabulary.</p>

  <p>Presently Fred came over and joined us, dancing across the wide red floor
  with the skirts of his gown outspread like a ballet dancer's&mdash;
  ridiculous and perfectly aware of it.</p>

  <p>"Monty, you're rich! We're all made men! We're all rich! Let's spend
  money! Let's send for catalogues and order things!"</p>

  <p>Monty declined to take fire. It was I, latest to join the partnership and
  much the least affluent, who bit.</p>

  <p>"If you love the Lord, explain!" said I.</p>

  <p>"This old one-eyed lazaretto attendant is an ex-slave, ex-accomplice of
  Tippoo Tib!"*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Tippoo Tib</i>&mdash;Tippu Tib (1837-1905), real
  name Hamed bin Mohammed el Marjebi, was a Swahili-Zanzibari trader,
  plantation owner and governor. Working for a succession of sultans of
  Zanzibar, he led many trading expeditions into east-central Africa, sometimes
  involving slave trade. Tippu Tip met and helped several famous western
  explorers of the African continent, including Henry Morton Stanley. Between
  1884 and 1887 Tip claimed the Eastern Congo. In 1887, he was named governor
  of Stanley Falls District in the Congo Free State. He died in 1905 in his
  home in Stone Town, the main town on the island of Zanzibar. <i><a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tippu_Tib">Wikipedia</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>"And Tippoo Tib?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Ignorant fo'c's'le outcast!" (All that because I had made one voyage as
  foremast hand, and deserted rather than submit to more of it.) "Tippoo Tib is
  the Arab&mdash;is, mind you, my son, not was&mdash;the Arab who was made
  governor of half the Congo by H. M. Stanley and the rest of 'em. Tippoo Tib
  is the expert who used to bring the slave caravans to Zanzibar&mdash;bring
  'em, send 'em, send for 'em&mdash;he owned 'em anyway. Tippoo Tib was the
  biggest ivory hunter and trader lived since old King Solomon! Tippoo Tib is
  here&mdash;in Zanzibar&mdash;to all intents and purposes a prisoner on
  parole&mdash;old as the hills&mdash;getting ready to die&mdash;and proud as
  the very ace of hell. So says One-eye!"</p>

  <p>"So we're all rich?" suggested Monty.</p>

  <p>"Of course we are! Listen! The British government took Tippoo's slaves
  away and busted his business. Made him come and live in this place, go to
  church on Sundays, and be good. Then they asked him what he'd done with his
  ivory. Asked him politely after putting him through that mill! One-eye here
  says Tippoo had a million tusks&mdash;a million!&mdash;safely buried!
  Government offered him ten per cent. of their cash value if he'd tell 'em
  where, and the old sport spat in their faces! Swears he'll die with the
  secret! One-eye vows Tippoo is the only one who knows. There were others, but
  Tippoo shot or poisoned 'em."</p>

  <p>"So we're rich," smiled Yerkes.</p>

  <p>"Of course we are! Consider this, America, and tell me if Standard Oil can
  beat it! One million tusks I'm told&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"By whom?"</p>

  <p>"One-eye says&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'll say 'Oh!' at me to a different tune, before I've done! One-eye
  says it never paid to carry a tusk weighing less than sixty pounds. Some
  tusks weigh two hundred&mdash;some even more&mdash;took four men to carry
  some of 'em! Call it an average weight of one hundred pounds and be on the
  safe side."</p>

  <p>"Yes, let's play safe," agreed Monty seriously.</p>

  <p>"One hundred million pounds of ivory!" said Fred, with a smack of his lips
  and the air of a man who could see the whole of it. "The present market price
  of new ivory is over ten shillings a pound on the spot. That'll all be very
  old stuff, worth at least double. But let's say ten shillings a pound and be
  on the safe side."</p>

  <p>"Yes, let's!" laughed Yerkes.</p>

  <p>"One thousand million&mdash;a billion shillings!" Fred announced. "Fifty
  million pounds!"</p>

  <p>"Two hundred and fifty million dollars!" Yerkes calculated, beginning to
  take serious notice.</p>

  <p>"But how are we to find it?" I objected.</p>

  <p>"That's the point. Government 'ud hog the lot, but has hunted high and low
  and can't find it. So the offer stands ten per cent. to any one who does
  &mdash;ten per cent. of fifty million&mdash;lowest reckoning, mind you!
  &mdash;five million pounds! Half for Monty&mdash;two and a half million. A
  million for Yerkes, a million for me, and a half a million for you all
  according to contract! How d'you like it?"</p>

  <p>"Well enough," I answered. "If its only the hundredth part true, I'm
  enthusiastic!"</p>

  <p>"So now suit yourselves!" said Fred, collapsing with a sweep of his skirts
  into the nearest chair. "I've told you what One-eye says. These dusky gents
  sometimes exaggerate of course&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now and then," admitted Monty.</p>

  <p>"But where there's smoke you mean there's prob'ly some one smoking hams?"
  suggested Yerkes.</p>

  <p>"I mean, let's find that ivory!" said Fred.</p>

  <p>"We might do worse than make an inquiry or two," Monty assented
  cautiously.</p>

  <p>"Didums, you damned fool, you're growing old! You're wasting time! You're
  trying to damp enthusiasm! You're&mdash;you're&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Interested, Fred. I'm interested. Let's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let's find that ivory and to hell with caution! Why, man alive, it's the
  chance of a million lifetimes!"</p>

  <p>"Well, then," said Monty, "admitting the story's true for the sake of
  argument, how do you propose to get on the track of the secret?"</p>

  <p>"Get on it? I am on it! Didn't One-eye say Tippoo Tib is alive and in
  Zanzibar? The old rascal! Many a slave he's done to death! Many a man be's
  tortured! I propose we catch Tippoo Tib, hide him, and pull out his toe-nails
  one by one until be blows the gaff!"</p>

  <p>(To hear Fred talk when there is nothing to do but talk a stranger might
  arrive at many false conclusions.)</p>

  <p>"If there's any truth in the story at all," said Monty, "government will
  have done everything within the bounds of decency to coax the facts from
  Tippoo Tib. I suspect we'd have to take our chance and simply hunt. But let's
  hear Juma's story."</p>

  <p>So the old attendant left off sprinkling water from a yellow jar, and came
  and stood before us. Fred's proposal of tweaking toe-nails would not have
  been practical in his case, for he had none left. His black legs, visible
  because he had tucked his one long garment up about his waist, were a mass of
  scars. He was lean, angular, yet peculiarly straight considering his years.
  As he stood before us he let his shirt-like garment drop, and the change from
  scarecrow to deferential servant was instantaneous. He was so wrinkled, and
  the wrinkles were so deep, that one scarcely noticed his sightless eye,
  almost hidden among a nest of creases; and in spite of the wrinkles, his
  polished, shaven head made him look ridiculously youthful because one
  expected gray hair and there was none.</p>

  <p>"Ask him how he lost his toe-nails, Fred," said I.</p>

  <p>But the old man knew enough English to answer for himself. He made a wry
  grimace and showed his hands. The finger-nails were gone too.</p>

  <p>"Tell us your story, Juma," said Monty.</p>

  <p>"Tell 'em about the pembe&mdash;the ivory&mdash;the much ivory&mdash; the
  meengi pembe," echoed Fred.</p>

  <p>"Let's hear about those nails of his first," said I.</p>

  <p>"One thing'll prob'ly lead to another," Yerkes agreed. "Start him on the
  toe-nail story."</p>

  <p>But it did not lead very far. Fred, who had picked up Kiswahili enough to
  piece out the old man's broken English, drew him out and clarified the tale.
  But it only went to prove that others besides ourselves had beard of Tippoo
  Tib's hoard. Some white man&mdash;we could not make bead or tail of the name,
  but it sounded rather like Somebody belonging to a man named Carpets
  &mdash;had trapped him a few years before and put him to torture in the
  belief that be knew the secret.</p>

  <p>"But me not knowing nothing!" he assured us solemnly, shaking his head
  again and again.</p>

  <p>But he was not in the least squeamish about telling us that Tippoo Tib had
  surely buried huge quantities of ivory, and had caused to be slain afterward
  every one who shared the secret.</p>

  <p>"How long ago?" asked Monty. But natives of that part of the earth are
  poor hands at reckoning time.</p>

  <p>"Long time," he assured us. He might have meant six years, or sixty. It
  would have been all the same to him.</p>

  <p>"No. Me not liking Tippoo Tib. One time his slave. That bad. By-um-by set
  free. That good. Now working here. This very good."</p>

  <p>"Where do you think the ivory is?" (This from Yerkes.)</p>

  <p>But the old man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"As I understand it," said Monty, "slaves came mostly from the Congo side
  of Lake Victoria Nyanza. Slave and elephant country were approximately the
  same as regards general direction, and there were two routes from the Congo
  &mdash;the southern by way of Ujiji on Tanganyika to Bagamoyo on what is now
  the German coast, and the other to the north of Victoria Nyanza ending at
  Mombasa. Ask him, Fred, which way the ivory used to come."</p>

  <p>"Both ways," announced Juma without waiting for Fred to interpret. He had
  an uncanny trick of following conversation, his intelligence seeming to work
  by fits and starts.</p>

  <p>"That gives us about half Africa for hunting-ground, and a job for life!"
  laughed Yerkes.</p>

  <p>"Might have a worse!" Fred answered, resentful of cold water thrown on his
  discovery.</p>

  <p>"Were you Tippoo Tib's slave when he buried the ivory?" demanded Monty,
  and the old man nodded.</p>

  <p>"Where were you at the time?"</p>

  <p>Juma made a gesture intended to suggest immeasurable distances toward the
  West, and the name of the place he mentioned was one we had never heard
  of.</p>

  <p>"Can you take us to Tippoo Tib when we leave this place?" I asked, and be
  nodded again.</p>

  <p>"How much ivory do you suppose there was?" asked Yerkes.</p>

  <p>"Teli, teli!" he answered, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Too much!" Fred translated.</p>

  <p>"Pretty fair to middling vague," said Yerkes, "but"&mdash;judicially
  &mdash;"almost worth investigating!"</p>

  <p>"Investigating?" Fred sprang from his chair. "It's better than all King
  Solomon's mines, El Dorado, Golconda, and Sinbad the Sailor's treasure lands
  &mdash;rolled in one! It's an obviously good thing! All we need is a bit of
  luck and the ivory's ours!"</p>

  <p>"I'll sell you my share now for a thousand dollars&mdash;come&mdash; come
  across!" grinned Yerkes.</p>

  <p>There was a rough-house after that. He and Fred nearly pulled the old
  attendant in two, each claiming the right to torture him first and learn the
  secret. They ended up without a whole rag between them, and had to send Juma
  to head-quarters for new blue dressing-gowns. The doctor came himself&mdash;
  a fat good-natured party with an eye-glass and a cocktail appetite, acting
  locum-tenens for the real official who was home on leave. He brought the
  ingredients for cocktails with him.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, shaking the mixer with a sort of deft solicitude. "There's
  more than something in the tale. I've had a try myself to get details. Tippoo
  Tib believes in up-to-date physic, and when the old rascal's sick he sends
  for me. I offered to mix him an elixir of life that would make him out-live
  Methuselah if he'd give me as much as a hint of the general direction of his
  cache."</p>

  <p>"He ought to have fallen for that," said Yerkes, but the doctor shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"He's an Arab. They're Shiah* Mohammedans. Their Paradise is a pleasant
  place from all accounts. He advised me to drink my own elixir, and have lots
  and lots of years in which to find the ivory, without being beholden to him
  for help. Wily old scaramouche! But I had a better card up my sleeve. He has
  taken to discarding ancient prejudices&mdash;doesn't drink or anything like
  that, but treats his harem almost humanly. Lets 'em have anything that costs
  him nothing. Even sends for a medico when they're sick! Getting lax in his
  old age! Sent for me a while ago to attend his favorite wife&mdash;sixty
  years old if she's a day, and as proud of him as if he were the king of
  Jerusalem. Well&mdash;I looked her over, judged she was likely to keep her
  bed, and did some thinking."</p>

  <p>"You know their religious law? A woman can't go to Paradise without
  special intercession, mainly vicarious. I found a mullah&mdash;that's a
  Mohammedan priest&mdash;who'd do anything for half of nothing. They most of
  them will. I gave him fifty dibs, and promised him more if the trick worked.
  Then I told the old woman she was going to die, but that if she'd tell me the
  secret of Tippoo Tib's ivory I had a mullah handy who would pass her into
  Paradise ahead of her old man. What did she do? She called Tippoo Tib, and he
  turned me out of the house. So I'm fifty out of pocket, and what's worse, the
  old girl didn't die&mdash;got right up out of bed and stayed up! My rep's all
  smashed to pieces among the Arabs!"</p>

  <p>"D'you suppose the old woman knew the secret?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Not she! If she'd known it she'd have split! The one ambition she has
  left is to be with Tippoo Tib in Paradise. But he can intercede for her and
  get her in&mdash;provided he feels that way; so she rounded on me in the hope
  of winning his special favor! But the old ruffian knows better! He'll no more
  pray for her than tell me where the ivory is! The Koran tells him there are
  much better houris* in Paradise, so why trouble to take along a toothless
  favorite from this world?"</p>

  <p>"Has the government any official information?" asked Monty.</p>

  <p>"Quite a bit, I'm told. Official records of vain searches. Between you and
  me and these four walls, about the only reason why they didn't hang the old
  slave-driving murderer was that they've always hoped he'd divulge the secret
  some day. But be hates the men who broke him far too bitterly to enrich them
  on any terms! If any man wins the secret from him it'll be a foreigner. They
  tell me a German had a hard try once. One of Karl Peters' men."</p>

  <p>"That'll be Carpets!" said Monty. "Somebody belonging to Carpets&mdash;
  Karl Peters."</p>

  <p>"The man's serving a life sentence in the jail for torturing our friend
  Juma here."</p>

  <p>"Then Juma knows the secret?"</p>

  <p>"So they say. But Juma, too, hopes to go to Paradise and wait on Tippoo
  Tib."</p>

  <p>"He told us just now that he dislikes Tippoo Tib," I objected.</p>

  <p>"So he does, but that makes no difference. Tippoo Tib is a big chief
  &mdash;sultani kubwa&mdash;take any one he fancies to Heaven with him!"</p>

  <p>We all looked at Juma with a new respect.</p>

  <p>"I got Juma his job in here," said the doctor. "I've rather the notion of
  getting my ten per cent. on the value of that ivory some day!"</p>

  <p>"Are there any people after it just now?" asked Monty.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, I'm sure. There was a German named Schillingschen, who
  spent a month in Zanzibar and talked a lot with Tippoo Tib. The old rascal
  might tell his secret to any one he thought was England's really dangerous
  enemy. Schillingschen crossed over to British East if I remember rightly. He
  might be on the track of it."</p>

  <p>"Tell us more about Schillingschen," said Monty.</p>

  <p>"He's one of those orientalists, who profess to know more about Islam than
  Christianity&mdash;more about Africa and Arabia than Europe&mdash;more about
  the occult than what's in the open. A man with a shovel beard&mdash;
  stout&mdash;thick-set&mdash;talks Kiswahili and Arabic and half a dozen other
  languages better than the natives do themselves. Has money&mdash; outfit like
  a prince's&mdash;everything imaginable&mdash;Rifles&mdash;
  microscopes&mdash;cigars&mdash;wine. He didn't make himself agreeable
  here&mdash;except to the Arabs. Didn't call at the Residency. Some of us
  asked him to dinner one evening, but he pleaded a headache. We were glad,
  because afterward we saw him eat at the hotel&mdash;has ways of using his
  fingers at table, picked up I suppose from the people he has lived
  among."</p>

  <p>"Are you nearly ready to let us out of here?" asked Monty.</p>

  <p>"Your quarantine's up," said the doctor. "I'm only waiting for word from
  the office."</p>

  <p>We drank three rounds of cocktails with him, after which he grew darkly
  friendly and proposed we should all set out together in search of the
  hoard.</p>

  <p>"I've no money," he assured us. "Nothing but a knowledge of the natives
  and a priceless thirst. I'd have to throw up my practise here. Of course I'd
  need some sort of guarantee from you chaps."</p>

  <p>The proposal falling flat, be gathered the nearly empty bottles into one
  place and shouted for his boy to come and carry them away.</p>

  <p>"Think it over!" he urged as he got up to leave us. "You might take a
  bigger fool than me with you. You'd need a doctor on a trip like that. I'm an
  expert on some of these tropical diseases. Think it over!"</p>

  <p>"Fred!" said Monty, as soon as the doctor had left the room, "I'm tempted
  by this ivory of yours."</p>

  <p>But Fred, in the new blue dressing-gown the doctor had brought, was in
  another world&mdash;a land of trope and key and metaphor. For the last ten
  minutes he had kept a stub of pencil and a scrap of paper working, and now
  the strident tones of his too long neglected concertina stirred the heavy air
  and shocked the birds outside to silence. The instrument was wheezy, for in
  addition to the sacrilege the port authorities had done by way of
  disinfection, the bellows had been wetted when Fred plunged from the sinking
  <i>Bundesrath</i> and swam. But he is not what you could call particular, as
  long as a good loud noise comes forth that can be jerked and broken into
  anything resembling tune.</p>

  <p>"Tempted, are you?" he laughed. He looked like a drunken troubadour en
  deshabillé, with those up-brushed mustaches and his usually neat brown beard
  all spread awry. "Temptation's more fun than plunder!"</p>

  <p>Yerkes threw an orange at him, more by way of recognition than
  remonstrance. We had not heard Fred sing since he tried to charm cholera
  victims in the <i>Bundesrath</i>'s fo'c's'le, and, like the rest of us, he
  had his rights. He sang with legs spread wide in front of him, and head
  thrown back, and, each time be came to the chorus, kept on repeating it until
  we joined in.</p>

  <p class="poem"
     style="margin-left:10%">There's a prize that's full familiar from Zanzibar
     to France;<br>
  From Tokyo to Boston; we are paid it in advance.<br>
  It's the wages of adventure, and the wide world knows the feel<br>
  Of the stuff that stirs good huntsmen all and brings the hounds to heel!<br>
  It's the one reward that's gratis and precedes the toilsome task&mdash;<br>
  It's the one thing always better than an optimist can ask!<br>
  It's amusing, it's amazing, and it's never twice the same;<br>
  It's the salt of true adventure and the glamour of the game!<br>
  <br>
  CHORUS<br>
  It is tem-tem-pitation!<br>
  The one sublime sensation!<br>
  You may doubt it, but without it<br>
  There would be no derring-do!<br>
  The reward the temptee cashes<br>
  Is too often dust and ashes,<br>
  But you'll need no spurs or lashes<br>
  When temptation beckons you!<br>
  <br>
  Oh, it drew the Roman legions to old Britain's distant isle,<br>
  And it beckoned H. M. Stanley to the sources of the Nile;<br>
  It's the one and only reason for the bristling guns at Gib,<br>
  For the skeletons at Khartoum, and the crimes of Tippoo Tib.<br>
  The gentlemen adventurers braved torture for its sake,<br>
  It beckoned out the galleons, and filled the hulls of Drake!<br>
  Oh, it sets the sails of commerce, and it whets the edge of war.<br>
  It's the sole excuse for churches, and the only cause of law!<br>
  <br>
  CHORUS<br>
  It is tem-tem-pitation! etc., etc.<br>
  <br>
  No note is there of failure (that's a tune the croakers sing!)<br>
  This song's of youth, and strength, and health, and time that's on the
  wing!<br>
  Of wealth beyond the hazy blue of far horizons flung&mdash;<br>
  But never of the folk returning, disillusioned, stung!<br>
  It's a tale of gold and ivory, of plunder out of reach,<br>
  Of luck that fell to other men, of treasure on the beach&mdash;<br>
  A compound, cross-reciprocating two-way double spell,<br>
  The low, sweet lure to Heaven, and the tallyho to hell!<br>
  <br>
  CHORUS<br>
  It is tem-tem-pitation!<br>
  The one sublime sensation!<br>
  You may doubt it, but without it<br>
  There would be no derring-do!<br>
  It's the siren of to-morrow<br>
  That knows naught of lack or sorrow,<br>
  So you'll sell your bonds and borrow,<br>
  When temptation beckons you!</p>

  <p>Once Fred starts there is no stopping him, short of personal violence, and
  he ran through his ever lengthening list of songs, not all quite printable,
  until the very coral walls ached with the concertina's wailing, and our
  throats were hoarse from ridiculous choruses. As Yerkes put it:</p>

  <p>"When pa says sing, the rest of us sing too or go crazy!"</p>

  <p>I went to the window and tried to get a view of shipping through the mango
  branches. Masts and sails&mdash;lateen spars particularly&mdash;always get me
  by the throat and make me happy for a while. But all I could see was a low
  wall beyond the little compound, and over the top of it headgear of nearly
  all the kinds there are. (Zanzibar is a wonderful market for second-hand
  clothes. There was even a tall silk hat of not very ancient pattern.)</p>

  <p>"Come and look, Monty!" said !, and he and Yerkes came and stood beside
  me. Seeing his troubadour charm was broken, Fred snapped the catch on the
  concertina and came too.</p>

  <p>"Arabian Nights!" he exclaimed, thumping Monty on the back.</p>

  <p>"Didums, you drunkard, we're dead and in another world! Juma is the one-
  eyed Calender! Look&mdash;fishermen&mdash;houris&mdash;how many houris?
  &mdash;seen 'em grin!&mdash;soldiers of fortune&mdash;merchants&mdash;
  sailors&mdash;by gad, there's Sinbad himself!&mdash;and say! If that isn't
  the Sultan Haroun-al-Raschid in disguise I'm willing to eat beans and pie for
  breakfast to oblige Yerkes! Look&mdash;look at the fat ruffian's stomach and
  swagger, will you?"</p>

  <p>Yerkes sized up the situation quickest.</p>

  <p>"Sing him another song, Fred. If we want to strike up acquaintance with
  half Zanzibar, here's our chance!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Richard, oh, my king!" hummed Monty. "It's Coeur de Lion and Blondell
  over again with the harp reversed."</p>

  <p>If Zanzibar may be said to possess main thoroughfares, that window of ours
  commanded as much of one as the tree and wall permitted; and music&mdash;
  even of a concertina&mdash;is the key to the heart of all people whose hair
  is crisp and kinky. Perhaps rather owing to the generosity of their slave
  law, and Koran teachings, more than to racial depravity, there are not very
  many Arabs left in that part of the world with true Semitic features and
  straight hair, nor many wooly-headed folk who are quite all-Bantu. There is
  enough Arab blood in all of them to make them bold; Bantu enough for
  syncopated, rag-time music to take them by the toes and stir them. The crowd
  in the street grew, and gathered until a policeman in red fez and khaki
  knickerbockers came and started trouble. He had a three-cornered fight on his
  hands, and no sympathy from any one, within two minutes. Then the man with
  the stomach and swagger&mdash;he whom Fred called Haroun-al-Raschid&mdash;
  took a hand in masterly style. He seized the police-man from behind, flung
  him out of the crowd, and nobody was troubled any more by that official.</p>

  <p>"That him Tippoo Tib's nephew!" said a voice, and we all jumped. We had
  not noticed Juma come and stand beside us.</p>

  <p>"I suspect nephew is a vague relationship in these parts," said Monty. "Do
  you mean Tippoo's brother was that man's father, Juma?"</p>

  <p>"No, bwana*. Tippoo Tib bringing slave long ago f'm Bagamoyo. Him she-
  slave having chile. She becoming concubine Tippoo Tib his wife's brother.
  That chile Tippoo Tib's nephew. Tea ready, bwana."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>bwana</i> (Swahili from Arabic 'abuna, our father)

  <p>"What does that man do for a living?"</p>

  <p>"Do for a living?" Juma was bewildered.</p>

  <p>"What does he work at?"</p>

  <p>"Not working."</p>

  <p>"Never?"</p>

  <p>"No.</p>

  <p>"Has he private means, then?"</p>

  <p>"I not understand. Tea ready, bwana!"</p>

  <p>"Has he got mali?"* Fred demanded.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>mali</i> (Swahili)&mdash;possession, property.

  <p>"Mali? No. Him poor man."</p>

  <p>"Then how does he exist, if he has no mali and doesn't work?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, one wife here, one there, one other place, an' Tippoo Tib By-um-by
  him giving food."</p>

  <p>"How many wives has he?"</p>

  <p>"Tea ready, bwana!"</p>

  <p>"How do they come to be spread all over the place?" (We were shooting
  questions at him one after the other, and Juma began to look as if be would
  have preferred a repetition of the toe-nail incident.)</p>

  <p>"Oh, he travel much, an' By-um-by lose all money, then stay here. Tea, him
  growing cold."</p>

  <p>There is no persuading the native servant who has lived under the Union
  Jack that an Englishman does not need hot tea at frequent intervals, even
  after three cocktails in an afternoon. So we trooped to the table to oblige
  him, and went through the form of being much refreshed.</p>

  <p>"What is that man's name?" demanded Monty.</p>

  <p>"Hassan."</p>

  <p>"Do you know him?"</p>

  <p>"Everybody know him!"</p>

  <p>"Can you get a message to him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, bwana."</p>

  <p>"Tell him to come and talk with us at the hotel as soon as he hears we are
  out of this."</p>

  <p>We did not know it at the time (for I don't think that Monty guessed it
  either) that we had taken the surest way of setting all Zanzibar by the ears.
  In that last lingering stronghold of legal slavery,* where the only stories
  judged worth listening to are the very sources of the Thousand Nights and a
  Night, intrigue is not perhaps the breath of life, but it is the salt and
  savory. There is a wooly-headed sultan who draws a guaranteed, fixed income
  and has nothing better to do than regale himself and a harem with western
  alleged amusement. There are police, and lights, and municipal regulations.
  In fact, Zanzibar has come on miserable times from certain points of view.
  But there remains the fun of listening to all the rumors borne by sea. "Play
  on the flute in Zanzibar and Africa as far as the lakes will dance!" the
  Arabs say, and the gentry who once drove slaves or traded ivory refuse to
  believe that the day of lawlessness is gone forever. One rumor then is worth
  ten facts. Four white men singing behind the bars of the lazaretto, desiring
  to speak with Hassan, "'nephew" of Tippoo Tib, and offering money for the
  introduction, were enough to send whispers sizzling up and down all the mazy
  streets.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Slavery was not absolutely and finally abolished in
  Zanzibar until 1906, during which year even the old slaves, hitherto
  unwilling to be set free, had to be pensioned off. Author's footnote. ]</p>

  <p>Our release from quarantine took place next day, and we went to the hotel,
  where we were besieged at once by tradesmen, each proclaiming himself the
  only honest outfitter and "agent for all good export firms." Monty departed
  to call on British officialdom (one advantage of traveling with a nobleman
  being that he has to do the stilted social stuff). Yerkes went to call on the
  United States Consul, the same being presumably a part of his religion, for
  he always does it, and almost always abuses his government afterward. So Fred
  and I were left to repel boarders, and it came about that we two received
  Hassan.</p>

  <p>He entered our room with a great shout of "Hodi!"* (and Fred knew enough
  to say "Karibu!"&dagger;)&mdash;a smart red fez set at an angle on his shaven
  head, his henna-stained beard all newly-combed&mdash;a garment like a
  night-shirt reaching nearly to his heels, a sort of vest of silk embroidery
  restraining his stomach's tendency to wobble at will, and a fat smile
  decorating the least ashamed, most obviously opportunist face I ever saw,
  even on a black man.</p>

  <p>"Jambo, jambo,"* he announced, striding in and observing our lack of
  worldly goods with one sweep of the eye. (We had not stocked up yet with new
  things, and probably he did not know our old ones were at the bottom of the
  sea.) He was a lion-hearted rascal though, at all events at the first rush,

  <p>"You send for me? You want a good guide?"</p>

  <p>The Haroun-al-Raschid look had disappeared. Now he was the jack-of-all-
  trades, wondering which end of the jack to push in first.</p>

  <p>"When I need a guide I'll get a licensed one," said Fred, sitting down and
  turning partly away from him. (It never pays to let those gentry think they
  have impressed you.) "What is your business, Johnson?"</p>

  <p>"My name Hassan, sah. You send for me? You want a headman. I'm formerly

  <p>"Any papers to prove it?" asked Fred.</p>

  <p>"No, sir. Reference to Tippoo Tib himself sufficient! He my part-
  uncle."</p>

  <p>"Ready to tell any kind of a lie for you, eh?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, always telling truth! You got a cook yet?"</p>

  <p>"Can you cook?" Fred answered guardedly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sah. Was cook formerly for Master Stanley, go with him on
  expedition. Later his boy. Later his headman. You want to go on expedition, I
  getting you good cook. Where you want to go?"</p>

  <p>"What you after? Ivory?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe."</p>

  <p>"I know all about ivory&mdash;I shoot, trade ivory along o' Tippoo Tib an'
  Stanley. You engage my services, all very well."</p>

  <p>"Go and tell Tippoo Tib we want to see him. If he confirms what you say,
  perhaps we'll take you on," said Fred.</p>

  <p>"Tell Tippoo Tib? Ha-ha! You want to find his buried ivory&mdash;that it?
  All white men wanting that! All right, I go tell him! I come again!"</p>

  <p>"Come back here, you fat rascal!" ordered Fred. "What do you mean about
  buried ivory? What buried ivory?"</p>

  <p>Hassan's face lost some of its transcendent cheek. Even the dyed beard
  seemed to wilt.</p>

  <p>"What you wanting?" he asked. "Hunt, trade, travel&mdash;what your
  business?"</p>

  <p>"Fish!" Fred answered genially.</p>

  <p>"Samaki?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;samaki&mdash;fish!"</p>

  <p>Having no experience of Arabs, and part-Arabs, I wondered what on earth
  Fred could be driving at. But Hassan wondered still more, and that was the
  whole point. He stood agape, looking from one to the other of us, his fat
  good-natured face an interrogation mark.</p>

  <p>"I go an' tell bwana Tippoo Tib!" he announced, and departed swiftly.</p>

  <p>"What's the idea of fish, Fred?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, just curiosity. The way of getting information out of colored folk is
  to get them so frantically curious they've no time to think up lies. Tobacco
  would have done as well&mdash;anything unexpected. A bird flying, and a black
  man lying,&mdash;are both of 'em easy to catch or confuse unless they know
  which way they're heading. Let's go and look at the bazaar."</p>

  <p>But in order to look one had to reach. We left the great heavy-beamed
  hotel that had once been Tippoo Tib's residence, but were stopped in the
  outer doorway by a crowd of native boys, each with a brass plate on his
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Guide, sah!&mdash;Guide, sah!&mdash;My name McPhairson, sah!&mdash; My
  name Jones, sah!&mdash;My name Johnson, sah! Guide to all the sights,
  sah!"</p>

  <p>They were as persistent and evilly intentioned as a swarm of flies, and
  bold enough to strike back when anybody kicked them. While we wrestled and
  swore, but made no headway, we were accosted by a Greek, who seemed from long
  experience able to pass through them without striking or being struck. We
  were not left in doubt another second as to whether our friend Hassan had
  dallied on the way, and held his tongue or not.</p>

  <p>"Good day, gentlemen! I hear you are after fish! Hah! That is a good story
  to tell to Arabs! You mean fishing for information, eh? Ha-hah!"</p>

  <p>He turned on the swarm of boys, who still yelled and struggled about our
  legs.</p>

  <p><i>"Imshi! Voetsak! Enenda zako! Kuma nina, wewe!"</i>* In a minute he had
  them all scattering, for only innocence and inexperience attract the preying
  youth of Zanzibar. "Now, gentlemen, my name is Coutlass&mdash;Georges
  Coutlass. Have a drink with me, and let me tell you something."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Imshi</i> (Arabic)&mdash;Get to hell out of here!

  <p>He was tall, dark skinned, athletic, and roguish-looking even for the
  brand of Greek one meets with south of the Levant&mdash;dressed in khaki,
  with an American cowboy hat&mdash;his fingers nearly black with cigarette
  juice&mdash;his hands unusually horny for that climate&mdash;and his hair
  clipped so short that it showed the bumps of avarice and other things, said
  to reside below the hat-band to the rear. Yet a plausible,
  companionable-seeming man. And Zanzibar confers democratic privilege, as well
  as fevers; impartiality hovers in the atmosphere as well as smells, and we
  neither of us dreamed of hesitating, but followed him back into the bar
  &mdash;a wide, low-ceilinged room whose beams were two feet thick of
  blackened, polished hard wood. There we sat one each side of him in cane
  armchairs. He ordered the drinks, and paid for them.</p>

  <p>"First I will tell you who I am," he said, when be had swallowed a foot-
  long whisky peg and wiped his lips with his coat sleeve. "I never boast. I
  don't need to! I am Georges Coutlass! I learned that you have an English lord
  among your party, and said I to myself 'Aha! There is a man who will
  appreciate me, who am a citizen of three lands!' Which of you gentlemen is
  the lord?"</p>

  <p>"How can you be a citizen of three countries?" Fred countered.</p>

  <p>"Of Greece, for I was born in Greece. I have fought Turks. Ah! I have bled
  for Greece. I have spilt my blood in many lands, but the best was for my
  motherland!&mdash;Of England, for I became naturalized. By bloody-hell-and-
  Waterloo, but I admire the English! They have guts, those English, and I am
  one of them! By the great horn spoon, yes, I became an Englishman at Bow
  Street one Monday morning, price five pounds. I was lined up with the drunks
  and pick-pockets, and by Jumbo the magistrate mistook me for a thief! He
  would have given me six months without the option in another minute, but I
  had the good luck to remember how much money I had paid my witnesses. The
  thought of paying that for nothing&mdash;worse than nothing, for six months
  in jail!&mdash;in an English jail!&mdash;pick oakum!*&mdash;eat
  skilly!&dagger;&mdash;that thought brought me to my senses. 'By
  Gassharamminy,' I said, 'I may be mad, but I'm sober! If it's a crime to
  desire to be English, then punish me, but let me first commit the offense!'
  So he laughed, and didn't question my witnesses very carefully&mdash;one was
  a Jew, the other an ex-German, and either of them would swear to anything at
  half price for a quantity&mdash;and they kissed the Book and committed
  perjury&mdash;and lo and behold, I was English as you are&mdash;English
  without troubling a midwife or the parson! Five pounds for the 'beak' at Bow
  Street&mdash;fifty for the witnesses&mdash;fifty-five all told&mdash; and
  cheap at the price! I had money in those days. It was after our short war
  with Turkey. We Greeks got beaten, but the Turks did not get all the loot! By
  prison and gallows, no! When our men ran before a battle, I did not run
  &mdash;not I! I remained, and by Croesus I grew richer in an hour than I have
  ever been since!"</p>

  <p>"That's two countries," said I. "Which is the third that has the honor to
  claim your allegiance?"</p>

  <p>"Honor is right!" he answered with a proud smile. I, Georges Coutlass,
  have honored three flags! I am a credit to all three countries! The third is
  America&mdash;the U.S.A. You might say that is the corollary of being
  English&mdash;the natural, logical, correct sequence! The U.S. laws are
  strict, but their politics were devised for&mdash;what is it the preachers
  call it&mdash;ah, yes, for straining out gnats and swallowing camels. By
  George Washington they would swallow a house on fire! There was a federal
  election shortly due. One of the parties&mdash;Democratic&mdash;
  Republican&mdash;I forget which&mdash;maybe both!&mdash;needed new voters.
  The law says it takes five years to become a citizen. Politics said fifteen
  minutes! The politicians paid the fees too! I was a citizen&mdash;a
  voter&mdash;an elector of presidents before I had been ashore three months,
  and I had sold my vote three times over within a month of that! They had me
  registered under three names in three separate wards! I didn't need the money
  &mdash;I had plenty in those days&mdash;I gave the six dollars I received for
  my votes to the Holy Church, and voted the other way to save my conscience;
  but the fun of the thing appealed! By Gassharamminy! I can't take life the
  way the copy-books lay down! I have to break laws or else break heads! But I
  love America! I fought and bled for America! By Abraham Lincoln, I fought
  those Spaniards until I don't doubt they wished I had stayed in Greece! Yes,
  I left that middle finger in Cuba&mdash;shot through the left hand by a Don,
  think of it, a Don! When I came out of hospital&mdash;and I never saw
  anything worse than that hot hell!&mdash;I got myself attached to the
  commissariat, and the pickings were none so bad. Had to hand over too much,
  though. That is the worst of America, there is no genuine liberty. You have
  to steal for the man higher up. If you keep more than ten per cent., he
  squeals. He has to pass most of it on again to some one else, and so on, and
  they all land in jail in course of time! Give me a country where a man can
  keep what he finds! There was talk about congressional inquiries. Then a
  friend of mine&mdash;a Greek&mdash;who had been out here told me of Tippoo
  Tib's ivory, and it looked all right to me to change scenes for a while. I
  had citizenship papers&mdash;U. S., and English, and a Greek passport in case
  of accident. Traveling looked good to me."</p>

  <p>"If you traveled on a Greek passport you couldn't use citizenship papers
  of any other country," Fred objected.</p>

  <p>"Who said I traveled on a Greek passport? Do you take me for such a fool?
  Who listens to a Greek consul? He may protest, and accept fees, but Greece is
  a little country and no one listens to her consuls. I carry a Greek passport
  in case I should find somewhere someday a Greek consul with influence or a
  Greek whom I wish to convince. I traveled to South Africa as an American. I
  went to Cape Town with the idea of going to Salisbury, and working my way up
  from there as a trader into the Congo. I reached Johannesburg, and there I
  did a little I. D. B. and one thing and another until the Boer War came. Then
  I fought for the Boers. Yes, I have bled for the Boer cause. It was a damned
  bad cause! They robbed me of nearly all my money! They left me to die when I
  was wounded! It was only by the grace of God, and the intrigues of a woman
  that I made my way to Lourenço Marquez. No, the war was not over, but what
  did I care? I, Georges Coutlass, had had enough of it! I recompensed myself
  en route. I do not fight for a bunch of thieves for nothing! I sailed from
  Lourenço Marquez to Mombasa. I hunted elephant in British East Africa until
  they posted a reward for me on the telegraph poles. The law says not more
  than two elephants in one year. I shot two hundred! I sold the ivory to an
  Indian, bought cattle, and went down into German East Africa. The Masai
  attacked me, stole some of the cattle, and killed others. The Germans, damn
  and blast them, took the rest! They accused me of crimes&mdash;me, Georges
  Coutlass!&mdash;and imposed fines calculated carefully to skin me of all I
  had! Roup* and rotten livers! but I will knock them head-over-hallelujah one
  fine day! Not for nothing shall they flim-flam Georges Coutlass! Which of you
  gentlemen is the lord?"</p>

  <p>We bought him another drink, and watched it disappear with one
  uninterrupted gurgle down its appointed course.</p>

  <p>"What did you do next?" Fred asked him before be had recovered breath
  enough to question us. "I suppose the Germans had you at a loose end?"</p>

  <p>"Do you think that? Sacred history of hell! It takes more than a lousy
  military German to get Georges Coutlass at a loose end! They must get me dead
  before that can happen! And then, by Blitzen, as those devils say, a dead
  Georges Coutlass will be better than a thousand dead Germans! In hell I will
  use them to clean my boots on! At a loose end, was I? I met this bloody rogue
  Hassan&mdash;the fat blackguard who told me you have come to Zanzibar for
  fish&mdash;and made an agreement with him to look for Tippoo Tib's buried
  ivory. Yes, sir! I showed him papers. He thought they were money drafts. He
  thought me a man of means whom he could bleed. I had guns and ammunition, he
  none. He pretended to know where some of Tippoo Tib's ivory is buried."</p>

  <p>"Some of it, eh?" said Fred.</p>

  <p>"Some of it, d'you say?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Some of it, yes. A million tusks. Some say two million! Some say three!
  Thunder!&mdash;you take a hundred good tusks and bury them; you'll see the
  hill you've made from five miles off! A hundred thousand tusks would make a
  mountain! If any one buried a million tusks in one spot they'd mark the place
  on maps as a watershed! They must be buried here, there, everywhere along the
  trail of Tippoo Tib&mdash;perhaps a thousand in one place at the most. Which
  of you two gentlemen is the lord?"</p>

  <p>"Did Hassan lead you to any of it?" Fred inquired.</p>

  <p>"Not he! The jelly-belly! The Arab pig! He led me to Ujiji&mdash;that's on
  Lake Tanganyika&mdash;the old slave market where he himself was once sold for
  ten cents. I don't doubt a piece of betel nut and a pair of worn-out shoes
  had to be thrown in with him at the price! There he tried to make me pay the
  expenses in advance of a trip to Usumbura at the head of the lake. God knows
  what it would have cost, the way he wanted me to do it! Are you the lord,
  sir?"</p>

  <p>"What did you do?" asked Fred.</p>

  <p>"Do? I parted company! I had made him drunk once. (The Arabs aren't
  supposed to drink, so when they do they get talkative and lively!) And I knew
  Arabic before ever I crossed the Atlantic&mdash;learned it in Egypt&mdash;
  ran away from a sponge-fishing boat when I was a boy. No, they don't fish
  sponges off the Nile Delta, but you can smuggle in a sponge boat better than
  in most ships. Anyhow, I learned Arabic. So I understood what that pig Hassan
  said when he talked in the dark with his brother swine. He knew no more than
  I where the ivory was! He suspected most of it was in a country called Rwanda
  that runs pretty much parallel with the Congo border to the west of Victoria
  Nyanza in German East Africa, and he was counting on finding natives who
  could tell him this and that that might put him on the trail of it! I could
  beat that game! I could cross-examine fool natives twice as well as any fat
  rascal of an ex-slave! Seeing he had paid all expenses so far, however, I was
  not much to the bad, so I picked a quarrel with him and we parted company.
  Wouldn't you have done the same, my lord?"</p>

  <p>But Fred did not walk into the trap. "What did you do next?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Next? I got a job with the agent of an Italian firm to go north and buy
  skins. He made me a good advance of trade goods&mdash;melikani,* beads, iron
  and brass wire, kangas,&dagger; and all that sort of thing, and I did well.
  Made money on that trip. Traveled north until I reached Rwanda&mdash; went on
  until I could see the Fire Mountains in the distance, and the country all
  smothered in lava. Reached a cannibal country, where the devils had eaten all
  the surrounding tribes until they had to take to vegetarianism at last."</p>

bin/swahili/lookup.cgi?Word=kanga&amp;EngP=0">The
  Internet Living Swahili Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>"But did you find the ivory?" Fred insisted.</p>

  <p>"No, or by Jiminy, I wouldn't be here! If I'd found it I'd have settled
  down with a wife in Greece long ago. I'd be keeping an inn, and growing wine,
  and living like a gentleman! But I found out enough to know there's a system
  that goes with the ivory Tippoo Tib buried. If you found one lot, that would
  lead you to the next, and so on. I got a suspicion where one lot is, although
  I couldn't prove it. And I made up my mind that the German government knows
  darned well where a lot of it is!"</p>

  <p>"Then why don't the Germans dig it up?" demanded Fred.</p>

  <p>"Aha!" laughed Coutlass. "If I know, why should I tell! If they know, why
  should they tell? Suppose that some of it were in Congo territory, and some
  in British East Africa? Suppose they should want to get the lot? What then?
  If they uncovered their bit in German East Africa mightn't that put the Congo
  and the British on the trail?"</p>

  <p>"If they know where it is," said I, "they'll certainly guard it."</p>

  <p>"Which of you is the lord?" demanded Coutlass earnestly.</p>

  <p>"What do you suppose Hassan is doing, then, here in Zanzibar?" asked
  Fred.</p>

  <p>"Rum and eggs! I know what he is doing! When I snapped my thumb under his
  fat nose and told him about the habits of his female ancestors be went to the
  Germans and informed against me! The sneak-thief! The turn-coat! The maggot!
  I shall not forget! I, Georges Coutlass, forget nothing! He informed against
  me, and they set askaris* on my trail who prevented me from making further
  search. I had to sit idle in Usumbura or Ujiji, or else come away; and
  idleness ill suits my blood! I came here, and Hassan followed me. The Germans
  made a regular, salaried spy of him&mdash;the semi-Arab rat! The one-tenth
  Arab, nine-tenths mud-rat! Here he stays in Zanzibar and spies on Tippoo Tib,
  on me, on the British government, and on every stranger who comes here. His
  information goes to the Germans. I know, for I intercepted some of it! He
  writes it out in Arabic, and provided no woman goes through the folds of his
  clothes or feels under that silken belly-piece be wears, the Germans get it.
  But if a woman does, and she's a friend of mine, that's different! Are you
  the lord, sir?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>askari</i> (Swahili)&mdash;native soldier. See the
  <i>Wikipedia</i> article <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Askaris">Askari</a> for more information. ]</p>

  <p>"What do you propose?" asked Fred.</p>

  <p>"Help me find that ivory!" said Coutlass. "I have very little money left,
  but I have guns, and courage! I know where to look, and I am not afraid! No
  German can scare me! I am English-American-Greek!&mdash;better than any
  hundred Germans! Let us find the ivory, and share it! Let us get it out
  through British territory, or the Congo, so that no German sausage can
  interfere with us or take away one tusk! Gee-rusalem, how I hate the swine.
  Let us put one over on them! Let us get the ivory to Europe, and then flaunt
  the deed under their noses! Let us send one little tip of a female tusk to
  the Kaiser for a souvenir&mdash;female in proof it is all illegitimate,
  illegal, outlawed! Let us send him a piece of ivory and a letter telling him
  all about it, and what we think of him and his swine-officials! His
  lieutenants and his captains! Let us smuggle the ivory out through the Congo
  &mdash;it can be done! It can be done! I, Georges Coutlass, will find the
  ivory, and find the way!"</p>

  <p>"No need to smuggle it out," said Fred. "The British government will give
  us ten per cent., or so I understand, of the value of all of it we find in
  British East."</p>

  <p>Georges Coutlass threw back his head and roared with laughter, slapped his
  thighs, held his sides&mdash;then coughed for two or three minutes, and spat
  blood.</p>

  <p>"You are the lord, all right!" he gasped as soon as he could get breath.
  "No need to smuggle it! Ha-ha! May I be damned! Ten per cent. they'll give
  us! Ha-ha! Generous! By whip and wheel! they're lucky if we give them five
  per cent.! I'd like to see any government take away from Georges Coutlass
  ninety per cent. of anything without a fight! No, gentlemen! No, my Lord! The
  Belgian Congo government is corrupt. Let us spend twenty-five per cent.
  &mdash;even thirty-forty-fifty per cent. of the value of it to bribe the
  Congo officials. Hand over ninety per cent. to the Germans or the British
  without a fight?&mdash;Never! Never while my name is Georges Coutlass! I have
  fought too often! I have been robbed by governments too often! This last time
  I will put it over all the governments, and be rich at last, and go home to
  Greece to live like a gentleman! Believe me!"</p>

  <p>He patted himself on the breast, and if flashing eye and frothing lip went
  for anything, then all the governments were as good as defeated already.</p>

  <p>"You are the lord, are you not?" he demanded, looking straight at
  Fred.</p>

  <p>"My name is Oakes," Fred answered.</p>

  <p>"Oh, then you? I beg pardon!" He looked at me with surprise that he made
  no attempt to conceal. Fred could pass for a king with that pointed beard of
  his (provided he were behaving himself seemly at the time) but for all my
  staid demeanor I have never been mistaken for any kind of personage. I
  disillusioned Coutlass promptly.</p>

  <p>"Then you are neither of you lords?"</p>

  <p>"Pish! We're obviously ladies!" answered Fred.</p>

  <p>"Then you have fooled me?" The Greek rose to his feet. "You have deceived
  me? You have accepted my hospitality and confidence under false
  pretense?"</p>

  <p>I think there would have been a fight, for Fred was never the man to
  accept brow-beating from chance-met strangers, and the Greek's fiery eye was
  rolling in fine frenzy; but just at that moment Yerkes strolled in, cheerful
  and brisk.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, fellers! This is some thirsty burg. Do they sell soft drinks in
  this joint?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"By Brooklyn Bridge!" exclaimed Coutlass. "An American! I, too, am an
  American! Fellow-citizen, these men have treated me badly! They have tricked
  me!"</p>

  <p>"You must be dead easy!" said Yerkes genially. "If those two wanted to
  live at the con game, they'd have to practise on the junior kindergarten
  grades. They're the mildest men I know. I let that one with the beard hold my
  shirt and pants when I go swimming! Tricked you, have they? Say&mdash;have
  you got any money left?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, have a drink!" laughed the Greek. "Have one on me! It's good to hear
  you talk!"</p>

  <p>"What have my friends done to you?" asked Yerkes.</p>

  <p>"I was looking for a lord. They pretended to be lords."</p>

  <p>"What? Both of 'em?"</p>

  <p>"No, it is one lord I am looking for."</p>

  <p>"One lord, one faith, one baptism!" said Yerkes profanely. "And you found
  two? What's your worry? I'll pretend to be a third if that'll help you
  any!"</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," said the Greek, rising to his full height and letting his
  rage begin to gather again, "you play with me. That is not well! You waste my
  time. That is not wise! I come in all innocence, looking for a certain lord
  &mdash;a real genuine lord&mdash;the Earl of Montdidier and
  Kirscrubbrightshaw&mdash;my God, what a name!"</p>

  <p>"I'm Mundidier," said a level voice, and the Greek faced about like a man
  attacked. Monty had entered the barroom and stood listening with calm
  amusement, that for some strange reason exasperated the Greek less than our
  attitude had done, at least for the moment. When the first flush of surprise
  had died he grinned and grew gallant.</p>

  <p>"My own name is Georges Coutlass, my Lord!" He made a sweeping bow, almost
  touching the floor with the brim of his cowboy hat, and then crossing his
  breast with it.</p>

  <p>"What can I do for you?" asked Monty.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me!"</p>

  <p>"Very well. I can spare fifteen minutes."</p>

  <p>We all took seats together in a far corner of the dingy room, where the
  Syrian barkeeper could not overhear us.</p>

  <p>"My Lord, I am an Englishman!" Coutlass began. "I am a God-fearing, law-
  abiding gentleman! I know where to look for the ivory that the Arab villain
  Tippoo Tib has buried! I know how to smuggle it out of Africa without paying
  a penny of duty&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did you say law-abiding?" Monty asked.</p>

  <p>"Surely! Always! I never break the law! As for instance&mdash;in Greece,
  where I had the honor to be born, the law says no man shall carry a knife or
  wear one in his belt. So, since I was a little boy I carry none! I have none
  in my hand&mdash;none at my belt. I keep it here!"</p>

  <p>He stooped, raised his right trousers leg, and drew from his Wellington
  boot a two-edged, pointed thing almost long enough to merit the name of
  rapier. He tossed it in the air, let it spin six or seven times end over end,
  caught it deftly by the point, and returned it to its hiding-place.</p>

  <p>"I am a law-abiding man," he said, "but where the law leaves off, I know
  where to begin! I am no fool!"</p>

  <p>Monty made up his mind there and then that this man's game would not be
  worth the candle.</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Coutlass, I can't oblige you," he said.</p>

  <p>The Greek half-arose and then sat down again.</p>

  <p>"You can not find it without my assistance!" he said, wrinkling his face
  for emphasis.</p>

  <p>"I'm not looking for assistance," said Monty.</p>

  <p>"Aha! You play with words! You are not&mdash;but you will! I am no fool,
  my Lord! I understand! Not for nothing did I make a friend again of that pig
  Hassan! Not for nothing have I waited all these months in this stinking
  Zanzibar until a man should come in search of that ivory whom I could trust!
  Not for nothing did Juma, the lazaretto attendant tell Hassan you desired to
  see him! You seek the ivory, but you wish to keep it all! To share none of it
  with me!" He stood up, and made another bow, much curter than his former one.
  "I am Georges Coutlass! My courage is known! No man can rob me and get away
  with it!"</p>

  <p>"My good man," drawled Monty, raising his eyebrows in the comfortless way
  he has when there seems need of facing an inferior antagonist. (He hates to
  "lord it" as thoroughly as he loves to risk his neck.) "I would not rob you
  if you owned the earth! If you have valuable information I'll pay for it
  cheerfully after it's tested."</p>

  <p>"Ah! Now you talk!"</p>

  <p>"Observe&mdash;I said after it's tested!"</p>

  <p>"I don't think he knows anything," said Fred. "I think he guessed a lot,
  and wants to look, and can't afford to pay his own expenses. Isn't that
  it?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" demanded Coutlass.</p>

  <p>"I can't talk Greek," said Fred. "Shall I say it again in English?"</p>

  <p>"You may name any reasonable price," said Monty, "for real information.
  Put it in writing. When we're agreed on the price, put that in writing too.
  Then, if we find the information is even approximately right, why, we'll pay
  for it."</p>

  <p>"Ah-h-h! You intend to play a trick on me! You use my information! You
  find the ivory! You go out by the Congo River and the other coast, and I kiss
  myself good-bye to you and ivory and money! I am to be what d'you call it?
  &mdash;a milk-pigeon!"</p>

  <p>"Being that must be some sensation!" nodded Yerkes.</p>

  <p>"I warn you I can not be tampered with!" snarled the Greek, putting on his
  hat with a flourish. "I leave you, for you to think it over! But I tell you
  this&mdash;I promise you&mdash;I swear! Any expedition in search of that
  ivory that does not include Georges Coutlass on his own terms is a delusion
  &mdash;a busted flush&mdash;smashed&mdash;exploded&mdash;pfff!&mdash;
  so&mdash;evanesced before the start! My address is Zanzibar! Every street
  child knows me! When you wish to know my terms, tell the first man or child
  you meet to lead you to the house where Georges Coutlass lives! Good morning,
  Lord Skirtsshubrish! We will no doubt meet again!"</p>

  <p>He turned his back on us and strode from the room&mdash;a man out of the
  middle ages, soldierly of bearing, unquestionably bold, and not one bit more
  venial or lawless than ninety per cent. of history's gallants, if the truth
  were told.</p>

  <p>"Let's hope that's the last of him!" said Monty. "Can't say I like him,
  but I'd hate to have to spoil his chances."</p>

  <p>"Last of him be sugared!" said Yerkes. "That's only the first of him!
  He'll find seven devils worse than himself and camp on our trail, if I know
  anything of Greeks&mdash;that's to say, if our trail leads after that ivory.
  Does it?"</p>

  <p>"Depends," said Monty. "Let's talk upstairs. That Syrian has long
  ears."</p>

  <p>So we trooped to Monty's room, where the very cobwebs reeked of Arab
  history and lawless plans. He sat on the black iron bed, and we grouped
  ourselves about on chairs that had very likely covered the known world
  between them. One was obviously jetsam from a steamship; one was a Chinese
  thing, carved with staggering dragons; the other was made of iron-hard wood
  that Yerkes swore came from South America.</p>

  <p>"Shoot when you're ready!" grinned Yerkes.</p>

  <p>I was too excited to sit still. So was Fred.</p>

  <p>"Get a move on, Didums, for God's sake!" he growled.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Monty, "there seems something in this ivory business. Our
  chance ought to be as good as anybody's. But there are one or two stiff
  hurdles. In the first place, the story is common property. Every one knows it
  &mdash;Arabs&mdash;Swahili&mdash;Greeks&mdash;Germans&mdash;English. To be
  suspected of looking for it would spell failure, for the simple reason that
  every adventurer on the coast would trail us, and if we did find it we
  shouldn't be able to keep the secret for five minutes. If we found it
  anywhere except on British territory it 'ud be taken away from us before we'd
  time to turn round. And it isn't buried on British territory! I've found out
  that much."</p>

  <p>"Good God, Didums! D'you mean you know where the stuff is?"</p>

  <p>Fred sat forward like a man at a play.</p>

  <p>"I know where it isn't," said Monty. "They told me at the Residency that
  in all human probability it's buried part in German East, and by far the
  greater part in the Congo."</p>

  <p>"Then that ten per cent. offer by the British is a bluff?" asked
  Yerkes.</p>

  <p>"Out of date," said Monty. "The other governments offer nothing. The
  German government might make terms with a German or a Greek&mdash;not with an
  Englishman. The Congo government is an unknown quantity, but would probably
  see reason if approached the proper way."</p>

  <p>"The U.S. Consul tells me," said Yerkes, "that the Congo government is the
  rottenest aggregate of cutthroats, horse-thieves, thugs, yeggs, common-or-
  ordinary hold-ups, and sleight-of-hand professors that the world ever saw in
  one God-forsaken country. He says they're of every nationality, but without
  squeam of any kind&mdash;hang or shoot you as soon as look at you! He says if
  there's any ivory buried in those parts they've either got it and sold it, or
  else they buried it themselves and spread the story for a trap to fetch
  greenhorns over the border!"</p>

  <p>"That man's after the stuff himself!" said Fred. "All he wanted to do was
  stall you off!"</p>

  <p>"That man Schillingschen the doctor told us about," said Monty, "is
  suspected of knowing where to look for some of the Congo hoard. He'll bear
  watching. He's in British East Africa at present&mdash;said to be combing
  Nairobi and other places for a certain native. He is known to stand high in
  the favor of the German government, but poses as a professor of
  ethnology."</p>

  <p>"He shall study deathnology," said Fred, "if he gets in my way!"</p>

  <p>"The Congo people," said Monty, "would have dug up the stuff, of course,
  if they'd known where to look for it. Our people believe that the Germans do
  know whereabouts to look for it, but dread putting the Congo crowd on the
  scent. If we're after it we've got to do two things besides agreeing between
  ourselves."</p>

  <p>"Deal me in, Monty!" said Yerkes.</p>

  <p>"Nil desperandum, Didums duce, then!" said Fred. "I propose Monty for
  leader. Those against the motion take their shirts off, and see if they can
  lick me! Nobody pugnacious? The ayes have it! Talk along, Didums!"</p>

  <p>For all Fred's playfulness, Yerkes and I came in of our free and
  considered will, and Monty understood that.</p>

  <p>"We've got to separate," he said, "and I've got to interview the King of
  Belgium."</p>

  <p>"If that were my job," grinned Yerkes, "I'd prob'ly tell him things!"</p>

  <p>"I don't pretend to like him," said Monty. "But it seems to me I can serve
  our best interests by going to Brussels. He can't very well refuse me a
  private audience. I should get a contract with the Congo government
  satisfactory to all concerned. He's rapacious&mdash;but I think not ninety
  per cent. rapacious."</p>

  <p>"Good," said I, "but why separate?"</p>

  <p>"If we traveled toward the Congo from this place in a bunch," said Monty,
  "we should give the game away completely and have all the rag-tag and
  bob-tail on our heels. As it is, our only chance of shaking all of them would
  be to go round by sea and enter the Congo from the other side; but that would
  destroy our chance of picking up the trail in German East Africa. So I'll go
  to Brussels, and get back to British East as fast as possible. Fred must go
  to British East and watch Schillingschen. You two fellows may as well go by
  way of British East Africa to Muanza on Victoria Nyanza, and on from there to
  the Congo border by way of Ujiji. Yerkes is an American, and they'll suspect
  him less than any of us (they'd nail me, of course, in a minute!) So let
  Yerkes make a great show of looking for land to settle on. We'll all four
  meet on the Congo border, at some other place to be decided later. We'll have
  to agree on a code, and keep in touch by telegraph as often as possible. Now,
  is all that clear?"</p>

  <p>"We two'll have all the Greeks of Zanzibar trailing us all the way!"
  objected Yerkes.</p>

  <p>"That'll be better than having them trail the lot of us," said Monty.
  "You'll be able to shake them somewhere on the way. We'll count on your
  ingenuity, Will."</p>

  <p>"But what am I to do to Schillingschen?" asked Fred.</p>

  <p>"Keep an eye on him."</p>

  <p>"Do you see me Sherlock-Holmesing him across the high veldt? Piffle! Give
  America that job! I'll go through German East and keep ahead of the
  Greeks!"</p>

  <p>But Monty was firm. "Yerkes has a plausible excuse, Fred. They may wonder
  why an American should look for land in German East Africa, but they'll let
  him do it, and perhaps not spy on him to any extent. It's me they've their
  eye on. I'll try to keep 'em dazzled. You go to British East and dazzle
  Schillingschen! Now, are we agreed?"</p>

  <p>We were. But we talked, nevertheless, long into the afternoon, and in the
  end there was not one of us really satisfied. Over and over we tried to
  persuade Monty to omit the Brussels part of the plan. We wanted him with us.
  But he stuck to his point, and had his way, as he always did when we were
  quite sure he really wanted it.</p>

  Mirrored along wi' the fire-fly dance of 'longshore light and off-shore

  The roof-lamps and the riding lights,and phosphor wake of ship and shark.<br>
  <br>
  I was old when the fires of Arab ships<br>

  I sighed when the first o' the slaves were brought,<br>
  And laughed when the last were freed.<br>
  <br>
  Deep, oh deeper than anchors drop, the bones o' the outbound sailors lie,

  'venturers yearn from the ends of earth, for none o' the isles is as fair as
  I!<br>
  <br>
  &mdash;from <i>The Njo Hapa Song</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">THE enormous map of Africa loses no lure or mystery from the
  fact of nearness to the continent itself. Rather it increases. In the hot
  upper room that night, between the wreathing smoke of oil lamps, we pored
  over the large scale map Monty had saved from the wreck along with our money
  drafts and papers.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere was one of bygone piracy. The great black ceiling beams,
  heavy-legged table of two-inch planks, floor laid like a dhow's deck&mdash;
  making utmost use of odd lengths of timber, but strong enough to stand up
  under hurricanes and overloads of plunder, or to batten down rebellious
  slaves&mdash;murmurings from rooms below, where men of every race that haunts
  those shark-infested seas were drinking and telling tales that would make
  Münchhausen's reputation&mdash;steaminess, outer darkness, spicy equatorial
  smells and, above all, knowledge of the nature of the coming quest united to
  veil the map in fascination.</p>

  <p>No man gifted with imagination better than a hot-cross bun's could be in
  Zanzibar and not be conscious of the lure that made adventurers of men before
  the first tales were written. Old King Solomon's traders must have made it
  their headquarters, just as it was Sinbad the Sailor's rendezvous and that of
  pirates before he or Solomon were born or thought of. Vasco da Gama, stout
  Portuguese gentleman adventurer, conquered it, and no doubt looted the
  godowns* to a lively tune. Wave after wave of Arabs sailed to it (as they do
  today) from that other land of mystery, Arabia; and there isn't a yard of
  coral beach, coconut-fringed shore, clove orchard, or vanilla patch&mdash;
  not a lemon tree nor a thousand-year-old baobab but could tell of battle and
  intrigue; not a creek where the dhows lie peacefully today but could whisper
  of cargoes run by night&mdash;black cargoes, groaning fretfully and smelling
  of the 'tween-deck lawlessness.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>godown</i> (Malay)&mdash;In India and East Asia, a
  warehouse, especially one at a dockside. <i><a href=
  "http://www.bartleby.com/61/44/G0174450.html">The American Heritage
  Dictionary</a></i>.]</p>

  <p>"There are two things that have stuck in my memory that Lord Salisbury
  used to say when I was an Eton boy, spending a holiday at Hatfield House,"
  said Monty. "One was, Never talk fight unless you mean fight; then fight,
  don't talk. The other was, Always study the largest maps."</p>

  <p>"Who's talking fight?" demanded Fred.</p>

  <p>Monty ignored him. "Even this map isn't big enough to give a real idea of
  distances, but it helps. You see, there's no railway beyond Victoria Nyanza.
  Anything at all might happen in those great spaces beyond Uganda. Borderlands
  are quarrel-grounds. I should say the junction of British, Belgian, and
  German territory where Arab loot lies buried is the last place to dally in
  unarmed. You fellows 'ud better scour Zanzibar in the morning for the best
  guns to be had here."</p>

  <p>So I went to bed at midnight with that added stuff for building dreams. He
  who has bought guns remembers with a thrill; he who has not, has in store for
  him the most delightful hours of life. May he fall, as our lot was, on a
  gunsmith who has mended hammerlocks for Arabs, and who loves rifles as some
  greater rascals love a woman or a horse.</p>

  <p>We all four strolled next morning, clad in the khaki reachmedowns that a
  Goanese "universal provider" told us were the "latest thing," into a den
  between a camel stable and an even mustier-smelling home of gloom, where oxen
  tied nose-to-tail went round and round, grinding out semsem* everlastingly
  while a lean Swahili sang to them. When he ceased, they stopped. When he
  sang, they all began again.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>semsem</i> (Arabic, Swahili)&mdash;sesame; sesame

  Internet Living Swahili Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>In a bottle-shaped room at the end of a passage squeezed between those two
  centers of commerce sat the owner of the gun-store, part Arab, part Italian,
  part Englishman, apparently older than sin itself, toothless, except for one
  yellow fang that lay like an ornament over his lower lip, and able to smile
  more winningly than any siren of the sidewalk. Evidently he shaved at
  intervals, for white stubble stood out a third of an inch all over his
  wrinkled face. The upper part of his head was utterly bald, slippery, shiny,
  smooth, and adorned by an absurd, round Indian cap, too small, that would not
  stay in place and had to be hitched at intervals.</p>

  <p>He said his name was Captain Thomas Cook, and the license to sell firearms
  framed on the mud-brick wall bore him witness. (May he live forever under any
  name he chooses!)</p>

  <p>"Goons?" he said. "Goons? You gentlemen want goons? I have the goon what
  settled the hash of Sayed bin Mohammed&mdash;here it be. This other one's the
  rifle&mdash;see the nicks on her butt!&mdash;that Kamarajes the Greek used.
  See 'em&mdash;Arab goons&mdash;slaver goons&mdash;smooth-bore elephant
  goons&mdash;fours, eights, twelves&mdash;Martinis&mdash;them's the lot that
  was reekin' red-hot, days on end, in the last Arab war on the Congo,
  considerable used up but goin' cheap;&mdash;then here's Mausers (he
  pronounced it "Morsers")&mdash;old-style, same as used in 1870&mdash;good
  goons they be, long o' barrel and strong, but too high trajectory for some
  folks;&mdash;some's new style, magazines an' all&mdash;fine till a grain o'
  sand jams 'em oop;&mdash;an' Lee-Enfields, souvenirs o' the Boer War, some o'
  them bought from folks what plundered a battle-field or two&mdash; mostly all
  in good condition. Look at this one&mdash;see it&mdash;hold it &mdash;take a
  squint along it! Nineteen elephants shot wi' that Lee-Enfleld, an' the man's
  in jail for shootin' of 'em! Sold at auction by the gov'ment, that one was.
  See, here's an Express&mdash;a beauty&mdash;owned by an officer fr'm
  Indy&mdash;took by a shark 'e was, in swimmin' against all advice, him what
  had hunted tigers! There's no goon store a quarter as good as mine 'tween
  Cairo an' the Cape or Bombay an' Boma! Captain Cook's the boy to sell ye
  goons all right! Sit down. Look 'em over. Ask anything ye want to know. I'll
  tell ye. No obligation to buy."</p>

  <p>There is no need to fit out with guns and tents in London. Until both good
  and bad, both cowardly and brave give up the habit of dying in bed, or
  getting killed, or going broke, or ending up in jail for one cause and the
  other, there will surely always be fine pickings for men on the spot with a
  little money and a lot of patience&mdash;guns, tents, cooking pots, and all
  the other things.</p>

  <p>We spent a morning with Captain Thomas Cook, and left the store&mdash;
  Fred, Yerkes and I&mdash;with a battery of weapons, including a pistol
  apiece&mdash;that any expedition might be proud of. (Monty, since he had to
  go home in any case, preferred to look over the family gun-room before
  committing himself.)</p>

  <p>Then, since the first leg of the journey would be the same for all of us
  we bought other kit, packed it, and booked passages for British East Africa.
  Between then and the next afternoon when the British India steamboat sailed
  we were fairly bombarded by inquisitiveness, but contrived not to tell much.
  And with patience beyond belief Monty restrained us from paying court to
  Tippoo Tib.</p>

  <p>"The U.S. Consul says he's better worth a visit than most of the world's
  museums," Yerkes assured us two or three times. "He says Tippoo Tib's a fine
  old sport&mdash;damned rogue&mdash;slave-hunter, but white somewhere near the
  middle. What's the harm in our having a chin with him?"</p>

  <p>But Monty was adamant.</p>

  <p>"A call on him would prove nothing, but he and his friends would suspect.
  Spies would inform the German government. No. Let's act as if Tippoo Tib were
  out of mind."</p>

  <p>We grumbled, but we yielded. Hassan came again, shiny with sweat and
  voluble with offers of information and assistance.</p>

  <p>"Where you gentlemen going?" he kept asking.</p>

  <p>"England," said Monty, and showed his own steamer ticket in proof of it.
  That settled Hassan for the time but Georges Coutlass was not so easy. He
  came swaggering upstairs and thumped on Monty's door with the air of a bearer
  of king's messages.</p>

  <p>"What do you intend to do?" he asked. (We were all sitting on Monty's bed,
  and it was Yerkes who opened the door.)</p>

  <p>"Do you an injury," said Yerkes, "unless you take your foot away!" The
  Greek had placed it deftly to keep the door open pending his convenience.</p>

  <p>"Let him have his say" advised Monty from the bed.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going? Hassan told me England. Are you all going to
  England? If so, why have you bought guns? What will you do with six rifles,
  three shot-guns, and three pistols on the London streets? What will you do
  with tents in London? Will you make campfires in Regent Circus, that you take
  with you all those cooking pots? And all that rice, is that for the English
  to eat? Bah! No tenderfoot can fool me! You go to find my ivory, d'you hear!
  You think to get away with it unknown to me! I tell you I have sharp ears! By
  Jingo; there is nothing I can not find out that goes on in Africa! You think
  to cheat me? Then you are as good as dead men! You shall die like dogs! I
  will smithereen the whole damned lot of you before you touch a tusk!"</p>

  <p>"Get out of here!" growled Yerkes.</p>

  <p>"Give him a chance to go quietly, Will," urged Monty, and Coutlass heard
  him. Peaceful advice seemed the last spark needed to explode his crowded
  magazines of fury. He clenched his fists&mdash;spat because the words would
  not flow fast enough&mdash;and screamed.</p>

  <p>"Give me a chance, eh? A chance, eh?" Other doors began opening, and the
  appearance of an audience stimulated him to further peaks of rage. "The only
  chance I need is a sight of your carcasses within range, and a long range
  will do for Georges Coutlass!" He glared past Yerkes at Monty who had risen
  leisurely. "You call yourself a lord? I call you a thief! A jackal!"</p>

  <p>"Here, get out!" growled Yerkes, self-constituted Cerberus.</p>

  <p>"I will go when I damned please, you Yankee jackanapes!" the Greek
  retorted through set teeth. Yerkes is a free man, able and willing to
  shoulder his own end of any argument. He closed, and the Greek's ribs cracked
  under a vastly stronger hug than he had dreamed of expecting. But Coutlass
  was no weakling either, and though he gasped he gathered himself for a
  terrific effort.</p>

  <p>"Come on!" said Monty, and went past me through the door like a bolt from
  a catapult. Fred followed me, and when he saw us both out on the landing
  Monty started down the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Come on!" he called again.</p>

  <p>We followed, for there is no use in choosing a leader if you don't intend
  to obey him, even on occasions when you fail at once to understand. There was
  one turn on the wide stairs, and Monty stood there, back to the wall.</p>

  <p>"Go below, you fellows, and catch!" he laughed. "We don't want Will jailed
  for homicide!"</p>

  <p>The struggle was fierce and swift. Coutlass searched with a thumb for
  Will's eye, and stamped on his instep with an iron-shod heel. But he was a
  dissolute brute, and for all his strength Yerkes' cleaner living very soon
  told. Presently Will spared a hand to wrench at the ambitious thumb, and
  Coutlass screamed with agony. Then he began to sway this way and that without
  volition of his own, yielding his balance, and losing it again and again. In
  another minute Yerkes had him off his feet, cursing and kicking.</p>

  <p>"Steady, Will!" called Monty from below; but it was altogether too late
  for advice. Will gathered himself like a spring, and hurled the Greek
  downstairs backward.</p>

  <p>Then the point of Monty's strategy appeared. He caught him, saved him from
  being stunned against the wall, and, before the Greek could recover
  sufficiently to use heels and teeth or whisk out the knife he kept groping
  for, hurled him a stage farther on his journey&mdash;face forward this time
  down to where Fred and I were waiting. We kicked him out into the street too
  dazed to do anything but wander home.</p>

  <p>"Are you hurt, Will?" laughed Monty. "This isn't the States, you know; by
  gad, they'll jail you here if you do your own police work! Instead of
  Brussels I'd have had to stay and hire lawyers to defend you!"</p>

  <p>"Aw&mdash;quit preaching!" Yerkes answered. "If I hadn't seen you there on
  the stairs with your mouth open I'd have been satisfied to put him down and
  spank him!"</p>

  <p>It was then that the much more unexpected struck us speechless&mdash; even
  Monty for the moment, who is not much given to social indecision. We had not
  known there was a woman guest in that hotel. One does not look in Zanzibar
  for ladies with a Mayfair accent unaccompanied by menfolk able to protect
  them. Yet an indubitable Englishwoman, expensively if carelessly dressed,
  came to the head of the stairs and stood beside Yerkes looking down at the
  rest of us with a sort of well bred, rather tolerant scorn.</p>

  <p>"Am I right in believing this is Lord Montdidier?" she asked, pronouncing
  the word as it should be&mdash;Mundidger.</p>

  <p>She had been very beautiful. She still was handsome in a hard-lipped, bold
  way, with abundant raven hair and a complexion that would have been no worse
  for a touch of rouge. She seemed to scorn all the conventional refinements,
  though. Her lacy white dress, open at the neck, was creased and not too
  clean, but she wore in her bosom one great jewel like a ruby, set in
  brilliants, that gave the lie to poverty provided the gems were real. And the
  amber tube through which she smoked a cigarette was seven or eight inches
  long and had diamonds set in a gold band round its middle. She wore no
  wedding ring that I could see; and she took no more notice of Will Yerkes
  beside her than if he had been a part of the furniture.</p>

  <p>"Why do you ask?" asked Monty, starting upstairs. She had to make way for
  him, for Will Yerkes stood his ground.</p>

  <p>"A fair question!" she laughed. Her voice had a hard ring, but was very
  well trained and under absolute control. I received the impression that she
  had been a singer at some time. "I am Lady Saffren Waldon&mdash;Isobel
  Saffren Waldon."</p>

  <p>Fred and I had followed Monty up and were close behind him. I heard him
  mutter, "Oh, lord!" under his breath.</p>

  <p>"I knew your brother," she added.</p>

  <p>"I know you did."</p>

  <p>"You think that gives me no claim on your acquaintance? Perhaps it
  doesn't. But as an unprotected woman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is the Residency," objected Monty, "and the law."</p>

  <p>She laughed bitterly. "Thank you, I am in need of no passage home! I
  overheard that ruffian say, and I think I heard you say too that you are
  going to England. I want you to take a message for me."</p>

  <p>There is a post-office here" said Monty without turning a hair. He looked
  straight into her iron eyes. "There is a cable station. I will lend you money
  to cable with."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, my Lord!" she sneered. "I have money. I am so used to being
  snubbed that my skin would not feel a whip! I want you to take a verbal
  message!"</p>

  <p>It was perfectly evident that Monty would rather have met the devil in
  person than this untidy dame; yet he was only afraid apparently of conceding
  her too much claim on his attention. (If she had asked favors of me I don't
  doubt I would have scrambled to be useful. I began mentally taking her part,
  wondering why Monty should treat her so cavalierly; and I fancy Yerkes did
  the same.)</p>

  <p>"Tell me the message, and I'll tell you whether I'll take it," said
  Monty.</p>

  <p>She laughed again, even more bitterly.</p>

  <p>"If I could tell it on these stairs," she answered, "I could cable it.
  They censor cablegrams, and open letters in this place."</p>

  <p>"I suspect that isn't true," said Monty. "But if you object to witnesses,
  how do you propose to deliver your message to me?" he asked pointedly.</p>

  <p>"You mean you refuse to speak with me alone?"</p>

  <p>"My friends would draw out of earshot," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Your friends? Your gang, you mean!" She drew herself up very finely
  &mdash;very stately. Very lovely she was to look at in that half-light, with
  the shadows of Tippoo Tib's* old stairway hiding her tale of years. But I
  felt my regard for her slipping downhill (and so, I rather think did Yerkes).
  "You look well, Lord Montdidier, traipsing about the earth with a leash of
  mongrels at your heel! Falstaff never picked up a more sordid-looking pack!
  What do you feed them&mdash;bones? Are there no young bloods left of your own
  class, that you need travel with tradesmen?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The principal hotel In Zanzibar was formerly Tippoo
  Tib's residence, quite a magnificent mansion for that period and place.
  Author's footnote. ]</p>

  <p>Monty stood with both hands behind him and never turned a hair. Fred Oakes
  brushed up the ends of that troubadour mustache of his and struck more or
  less of an attitude. Will reddened to the ears, and I never felt more
  uncomfortable in all my life.</p>

  <p>"So this is your gang, is it?" she went on. "It looks sober at present! I
  suppose I must trust you to control them! I dare say even tavern brawlers
  respect you sufficiently to keep a lady's secret if you order them. I will
  hope they have manhood enough to hold their tongues!"</p>

  <p>Of course, dressed in the best that Zanzibar stores had to offer we
  scarcely looked like fashion plates. My shirt was torn where Coutlass had
  seized it to resist being thrown out, but I failed to see what she hoped to
  gain by that tongue lashing, even supposing we had been the lackeys she
  pretended to believe we were.</p>

  <p>"The message is to my brother," she went on.</p>

  <p>"I don't know him!" put in Monty promptly.</p>

  <p>"You mean you don't like him! Your brother had him expelled from two or
  three clubs, and you prefer not to meet him! Nevertheless, I give you this
  message to take to him! Please tell him&mdash;you will find him at his old
  address&mdash;that I, his sister, Lady Saffren Waldon, know now the secret of
  Tippoo Tib's ivory. He is to join me here at once, and we will get it, and
  sell it, and have money, and revenge! Will you tell him that!"</p>

  <p>"No!" answered Monty.</p>

  <p>I looked at Yerkes, Yerkes looked at Fred, and Fred at me.</p>

  <p>There was nothing to do but feel astonished.</p>

  <p>"Why not, if you please?"</p>

  <p>"I prefer not to meet Captain McCauley," said Monty.</p>

  <p>"Then you will give the message to somebody else?" she insisted.</p>

  <p>"No" said Monty. "I will carry no message for you."</p>

  <p>"Why do you say that? How dare you say that? In front of your following
  &mdash;your gang!"</p>

  <p>I should have been inclined to continue the argument myself&mdash;to try
  to find out what she did know, and to uncover her game. It was obvious she
  must have some reason for her extraordinary request, and her more
  extraordinary way of making it. But Monty saw fit to stride past her through
  his open bedroom door, and shut it behind him firmly. We stood looking at her
  and at one another stupidly until she turned her back and went to her own
  room on the floor above. Then we followed Monty.</p>

  <p>"Did she say anything else?" he asked as soon as we were inside. I noticed
  he was sweating pretty freely now.</p>

  <p>"Didums, you're too polite!" Fred answered. "You ought to have told her to
  keep her tongue housed or be civil!"</p>

  <p>"I don't hold with hitting back at a lone woman," said Yerkes, "but what
  was she driving at? What did she mean by calling us a pack of mongrels?"</p>

  <p>"Merely her way," said Monty offhandedly. "Those particular McCauleys
  never amounted to much. She married a baronet, and he divorced her. Bad
  scandal. Saffren Waldon was at the War Office. She stole papers, or something
  of that sort&mdash;delivered them to a German paramour&mdash;von Duvitz was
  his name, I think. She and her brother were lucky to keep out of jail. Ever
  since then she has been&mdash;some say a spy, some say one thing, some
  another. My brother fell foul of her, and lived to regret it. She's on her
  last legs I don't doubt, or she wouldn't be in Zanzibar."</p>

  <p>"Then why the obvious nervous sweat you're in?" demanded Fred.</p>

  <p>"And that doesn't account for the abuse she handed out to us," said
  Yerkes.</p>

  <p>"Why not tip off the authorities that she's a notorious spy?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I suspect they know all about her," he answered.</p>

  <p>"But why your alarm?" insisted Fred.</p>

  <p>"I'm scarcely alarmed, old thing. But it's pretty obvious, isn't it, that
  she wants us to believe she knows what we're after. She's vindictive. She
  imagines she owes me a grudge on my brother's account. It might soothe her to
  think she had made me nervous. And by gad&mdash;it sounds like lunacy, and
  mind you I'm not propounding it for fact!&mdash;there's just one chance that
  she really does know where the ivory is!"</p>

  <p>"But where's the sense of abusing us?" repeated Yerkes.</p>

  <p>"That's the poor thing's way of claiming class superiority," said Monty.
  "She was born into one class, married into another, and divorced into a
  third. She'd likely to forget she said an unkind word the next time she meets
  you. Give her one chance and she'll pretend she believes you were born to the
  purple&mdash;flatter you until you half believe it yourself. Later on, when
  it suits her at the moment, she'll denounce you as a social imposter! It's
  just habit&mdash;bad habit, I admit&mdash;comes of the life she leads. Lots
  of 'em like her. Few of 'em quite so well informed, though, and dangerous if
  you give 'em a chance."</p>

  <p>"I still don't see why you're sweating," said Fred.</p>

  <p>"It's hot. There's a chance she knows where the ivory is! She has money,
  but how? She'd have begged if she were short of cash! It's my impression she
  has been in German government employ for a number of years. Possibly they
  have paid her to do some spy-work&mdash;in the Zanzibar court, perhaps
  &mdash;the Sultan's a mere boy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Isn't he wooly-headed?" objected Yerkes.</p>

  <p>"Mainly Arab. It's a French game to send a white woman to intrigue at
  colored courts, but the Germans are good imitators."</p>

  <p>"Isn't she English?" asked Yerkes.</p>

  <p>"Her trade's international," said Monty dryly. "My guess is that Coutlass
  or Hassan told her what we're supposed to be doing here, and she pretends to
  know where the ivory is in order to trap us all in some way. The net's spread
  for me, but there's no objection to catching you fellows as well."</p>

  <p>"She'll need to use sweeter bait than I've seen yet!" laughed Yerkes.</p>

  <p>"She'll probably be sweetness itself next time she sees you. She'll argue
  she's created an impression and can afford to be gracious."</p>

  <p>"Impression is good!" said Yerkes. "I mean it's bad! She has created one,
  all right! What's the likelihood of her having double-crossed the Germans?
  Mightn't she have got a clue to where the stuff is, and be holding for a
  better market than they offer?"</p>

  <p>"I was coming to that," said Monty. "Yes, it's possible. But whatever her
  game is, don't let us play it for her. Let her do the leading. If she gets
  hold of you fellows, one at a time or all together, for the love of heaven
  tell her nothing! Let her tell all she likes, but admit nothing&mdash;tell
  nothing&mdash;ask no questions! That's an old rule in diplomacy (and
  remember, she's a diplomat, whatever else she may be!) Old-stagers can divine
  the Young ones' secrets from the nature of the questions they ask! So if you
  got the chance, ask her nothing! Don't lie, either! It would take a very old
  hand to lie to her in such way that she couldn't see through it!"</p>

  <p>"Why not be simply rude and turn our backs?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Best of all&mdash;provided you can do it! Remember, she's a old
  hand!"</p>

  <p>"D'you mean," said Yerkes, "that if she were to offer proof that she knows
  where that ivory is, and proposed terms, you wouldn't talk it over?"</p>

  <p>"I mean let her alone!" said Monty.</p>

  <p>But it turned out she would not be let alone. We dine in the public room,
  but she had her meals sent up to her and we flattered ourselves (or I did)
  that her net had been laid in vain. Folk dine late in the tropics, and we
  dallied over coffee and cigars, so that it was going on for ten o'clock when
  Yerkes and I started upstairs again. Monty and Fred went out to see the
  waterfront by moonlight.</p>

  <p>We had reached our door (he and I shared one great room) when we heard
  terrific screams from the floor above&mdash;a woman's&mdash;one after
  another, piercing, fearful, hair-raising, and so suggestive in that gloomy,
  grim building that a man's very blood stood still.</p>

  <p>Yerkes was the first upstairs. He went like an arrow from a bow, and I
  after him. The screams had stopped before we reached the stairhead, but there
  was no doubting which her room was; the door was partly open, permitting a
  view of armchairs and feminine garments in some disorder. We heard a man
  talking loud quick Arabic, and a woman&mdash;pleading, I thought. Yerkes
  rapped on the door.</p>

  <p>"Come in!" said a voice, and I followed Yerkes in.</p>

  <p>We were met by her Syrian maid, a creature with gazelle eyes and timid
  manner, who came through the doorway leading to an inner room.</p>

  <p>"What's the trouble?" demanded Yerkes, and the woman signed to us to go on
  in. Yerkes led the way again impulsively as any knight-errant rescuing
  beleaguered dames, but I looked back and saw that the Syrian woman had locked
  the outer door. Before I could tell Will that, he was in the next room, so I
  followed, and, like him, stood rather bewildered.</p>

  <p>Lady Saffren Waldon sat facing us, rather triumphant, in no apparent
  trouble, not alone. There were four very well-dressed Arabs standing to one
  side. She sat in a basket chair by a door that pretty obviously led into her
  bedroom; and kept one foot on a pillow, although I suspected there was not
  much the matter with it.</p>

  <p>"We heard screams. Thought you were being murdered!" said Yerkes, out of
  breath.</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed, no! Nothing of the kind! I fell and twisted my ankle&mdash;
  very painful, but not serious. Since you are here, sit down, won't you?"</p>

  <p>"No, thanks," said he, turning to go.</p>

  <p>"The maid locked the door on us!" said I, and before the words were out of
  my mouth three of the Arabs slipped into the outer room. There was no hint or
  display of weapons of any kind, but they were big men, and the folds of their
  garments were sufficiently voluminous to have hidden a dozen guns apiece.</p>

  <p>"She'll open it!" said Will, with inflection that a fool could
  understand.</p>

  <p>"One minute, please!" said Lady Saffren Waldon. (It was no poor imitation
  of Queen Elizabeth ordering courtiers about.)</p>

  <p>"We didn't come to talk," said Will. "Heard screams. Made a mistake.
  Sorry. We're off!"</p>

  <p>"No mistake!" she said; and the sweetness Monty prophesied began to show
  itself. The change in her voice was too swift and pronounced to be
  convincing. "I did scream. I was, in pain. It was kind of you to come. Since
  you are here I would like you to talk to this gentleman."</p>

  <p>She glanced at the Arab, an able-looking man, with nose and eyes
  expressive of keen thought, and the groomed gray beard that makes an Arab
  always dignified.</p>

  <p>"Some other time," said Will. "I've an engagement!" And he turned to go
  again.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;now!" she said. "It's no use&mdash;you can't get out! You may as
  well be sensible and listen!"</p>

  <p>We glanced at each other and both remembered Monty's warning. Will
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"Take seats," she said, with a very regal gesture. She was not carelessly
  dressed, as she had been earlier in the day. From hair to silken hose and
  white kid shoes she was immaculate, and she wore rouge and powder now. In
  that yellow lamplight (carefully placed, no doubt) she was certainly
  good-looking. In fact, she was good-looking at any time, and only no longer
  able to face daylight with the tale of youth. Her eyes were weapons, nothing
  less. We remained standing.</p>

  <p>"This gentleman will speak to you," she said, motioning to the Arab to
  commence, and he bowed&mdash;from the shoulders upward.</p>

  <p>"I am from His Highness the Sultan of Zanzibar" he announced, a little
  pompously. "A minister from His Highness." (In announcing their own
  importance Arabs very seldom err in the direction of under-estimate.) "I
  speak about the ivory, which I am informed you propose to set out on a
  journey to discover."</p>

  <p>"Where did you get your information?" Yerkes countered.</p>

  <p>"Don't be absurd!" ordered Lady Saffren Waldon. "I gave it to him! Where
  else need he go to get it?"</p>

  <p>"Where did you get it, then?" he retorted.</p>

  <p>"Never mind! Listen to what Hamed Ibrahim has to say!"</p>

  <p>The Arab bowed his bead slightly a second time.</p>

  <p>"The ivory you seek," he said, "is said to be Tippoo Tib's own, and he
  will not tell the hiding-places. It does not belong to him. Such little part
  of it as ever was his was long ago swallowed by the interest on claims
  against him. The whole is now in truth the property of His Highness the
  Sultan of Zanzibar, and whoever discovers it shall receive reward from the
  owner. His Highness is willing, through me his minister, to make treaty in
  advance in writing with suitable parties intending to make search."</p>

  <p>"You mean the Sultan wants to hire me to hunt for ivory for him?" Will
  asked, and the Arab made a gesture of impatience. At that Lady Saffren Waldon
  cut in, very vinegary once more.</p>

  <p>"You two men are prisoners! Show much more sense! Come to terms or take
  the consequences! Listen! Tippoo Tib buried the ivory. The Sultan of Zanzibar
  claims it. The German government, for reasons of its own, backs the Sultan's
  claim; ivory found in German East Africa will be handed over to him in
  support of his claim to all the rest of it. If you&mdash;Lord Montdidier and
  the rest of you&mdash;care to sign an agreement with the Sultan of Zanzibar
  you can have facilities. You shall be supplied with guides who can lead you
  to the right place to start your search from&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Thought you wanted Lord Montdidier to say in London that you know where
  it all is," Will objected.</p>

  <p>She colored slightly, and glared.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I am one of the guides," she said darkly. "I know more than I
  need tell for the sake of this argument! The point is, you can have
  facilities if you sign an agreement with the Sultan. Otherwise, you will be
  dogged wherever you go! Whatever you should find would be claimed! Every
  difficulty will be made for you&mdash;every treachery conceivable practiced
  on you. Lord Montdidier can get influential backing, but not influence among
  the natives! He can not get good men and true information by pulling wires in
  London. The British government once offered ten per cent. of the value of the
  ivory found. The Sultan of Zanzibar offers twenty per cent&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Twenty-five per cent," corrected Hamed Ibrahim.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I should want five per cent. for my commission!"</p>

  <p>"This sounds like a different yarn to the one you told on the stairs this
  afternoon," said Will. "See Monty and tell it to him."</p>

  <p>"It is for you to tell Lord Montdidier. He runs away from me!"</p>

  <p>"I refuse to tell him a word!" said Will, with a laugh like that of a boy
  about to plunge into a swimming pool&mdash;sort of "Here goes!"</p>

  <p>"You are extremely ill advised!"</p>

  <p>"Do your worst! Monty'll be hunting for us two in about a minute. We're
  prisoners, are we? Suit yourself!"</p>

  <p>"You are prisoners while I choose! You could be killed in this room,
  removed in sacks, thrown to the sharks in the roadstead, and nobody the
  wiser! But I have no intention of killing you. As it happens, that would not
  suit my purpose!"</p>

  <p>We both glanced behind us involuntarily. It may be that we both heard a
  footstep, but it is always difficult to say certainly after the event. At any
  rate, while in the act of turning our heads, two of the three Arabs, who had
  previously left the room, threw nooses over them and bound our arms to our
  sides with the jiffy-swiftness only sailors know. The third man put the
  finishing touches, and presently adjusted gags with a neatness and solicitude
  worthy of the Inquisition.</p>

  <p>"Throw them!" she ordered, and in a second our heels were struck from
  under us and I was half stunned by the impact of my head against the solid
  floor (for all the floors of that great place were built to resist
  eternity).</p>

  <p>"Now!" she said. "Show them knives!"</p>

  <p>We were shown forthwith the ugliest, most suggestive weapons I have ever
  seen&mdash;long sliver-thin blades sharper than razors. The Arabs knelt on
  our chests (their knees were harder and more merciless than wooden clubs) and
  laid the blades, edge-upward, on the skin of our throats.</p>

  <p>"Let them feel!" she ordered.</p>

  <p>I felt a sharp cut, and the warm blood trickled down over my jugular to
  the floor. I knew it was only a skin-cut, but did not pretend to myself I was
  enjoying the ordeal.</p>

  <p>"Now!" she said.</p>

  <p>The Arabs stepped away and she came and stood between us, looking down at
  one and then the other.</p>

  <p>"There isn't a place in Africa," she said, "that you can hide in where the
  Sultan's men can't find you! There isn't a British officer in Africa who
  would believe you if you told what has happened in this room tonight! Yet
  Lord Montdidier will believe you&mdash;he knows you presumably, and certainly
  he knows me! So tell Lord Montdidier exactly what has happened! Assure him
  with my compliments that his throat and yours shall be cut as surely as you
  dare set out after that ivory without signing my agreement first. Tell Lord
  Montdidier he may be friends with me if he cares to. As his friend I will
  help make him rich for life! As his enemy, I will make Africa too hot and
  dangerous to hold him! Let him choose!"</p>

  <p>She stepped back and, without troubling to turn away, put powder on her
  nose and chin.</p>

  <p>"Now let them up!" she said.</p>

  <p>The Arabs lifted us to our feet.</p>

  <p>"Loose them!"</p>

  <p>The expert of the three slipped the knots like a wizard doing parlor
  tricks; but I noticed that the other two held their knives extremely
  cautiously. We should have been dead men if we had made a pugnacious
  motion.</p>

  <p>"Now you may go! Unless Lord Montdidier agrees with me, the only safety
  for any of you is away from Africa! Go and tell him! Go!"</p>

  <p>"I'll give you your answer now!" said Will.</p>

  <p>"No, you don't!" said I, remembering Monty's urgent admonition to tell her
  nothing and ask no questions. "Come away, Will! There's nothing to be gained
  by talking back!"</p>

  <p>"Right you are!" he said, laughing like a boy again&mdash;this time like a
  boy whose fight has been broken off without his seeking or consent. Like me,
  he pulled out a handkerchief and wiped blood from his neck. The sight of his
  own blood&mdash;even such a little trickle as that&mdash;has peculiar effect
  an a man.</p>

  <p>"By Jiminy, she has scratched the wrong dog's ear!" he growled to me as we
  went to the door together.</p>

  <p>"They're all in there!" I said excitedly, when the door slammed shut
  behind us. "Hurry down and get me a gun! I'll hold the door while you run for
  police and have 'em l arrested!"</p>

  <p>"Piffle!" he said. "Come on! Three Sultan's witnesses and two lone white
  women against us two&mdash;come away! Come away!"</p>

  <p>Monty and Fred were still out, so we went to our own room.</p>

  <p>"I'm wondering," I said, "what Monty will say."</p>

  <p>"I'm not!" said Will. "I'm not troubling, either! I'm not going to tell
  Monty a blessed word! See here&mdash;she thinks she knows where some o' that
  ivory is. Maybe the government of German East Africa is in on the deal, and
  maybe not; that makes no present difference. She thinks she's wise. And she
  has fixed up with the Sultan to have him claim it when found, so's she'll get
  a fat slice of the melon. There's a scheme on to get the stuff, when who
  should come on the scene but our little party, and that makes 'em all
  nervous, 'cause Monty's a bad man to be up against. Remember: she claimed
  that she knows Monty and he knows her. She means by that that he knows she's
  a desperado, and she thinks he'll draw the line at a trip that promises
  murder and blackmail and such like dirty work. So she puts a scare into us
  with a view to our throwing a scare into him. If I scare any one, it's going
  to be that dame herself. I'll not tell Monty a thing!"</p>

  <p>"How about Coutlass the Greek?" said I. "D'you suppose he's her
  accomplice?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe! One of her dupes perhaps! I suspect she'll suck him dry of
  information and cast him off like a lemon rind. I dare bet she's using him.
  She can't use me! Shall you tell Monty?"</p>

  <p>"No," I said. "Not unless we both agreed."</p>

  <p>He nodded. "You and I weren't born to what they call the purple. We're no
  diplomatists; but we get each other's meaning."</p>

  <p>"Here come Monty and Fred," said I. "Is my neck still bloody? No, yours
  doesn't show."</p>

  <p>We met them at the stairhead, and Monty did not seem to notice
  anything.</p>

  <p>"Fred has composed a song to the moonlight on Zanzibar roadstead while you
  fellows were merely after-dinner mundane. D'you suppose the landlord 'ud make
  trouble if we let him sing it?"</p>

  <p>"Let's hope so!" said Will. "I'm itching for a row like they say drovers
  in Monty's country itch for mile-stones! Let Fred warble. I'll fight whoever
  comes!"</p>

  <p>Monty eyed him and me swiftly, but made no comment.</p>

  <p>"Bill's homesick!" said Fred. "The U.S. eagle wants its Bowery! We'll
  soothe the fowl with thoughts of other things&mdash;where's the
  concertina?"</p>

  <p>"No, no, Fred, that'll be too much din!"</p>

  <p>Monty made a grab for the instrument, but Fred raised it above his head
  and brought it down between his knees with chords that crashed like wedding
  bells. Then he changed to softer, languorous music, and when he had picked
  out an air to suit his mood, sat down and turned art loose to do her
  worst.</p>

  <p>He has a good voice. If he would only not pull such faces, or make so sure
  that folk within a dozen blocks can hear him, he might pass for a
  professional.</p>

  <p>"Music suggestive of moonlight!" he said, and began:</p>

  <p class="poem">"The sentry palms stand motionless.<br>
  Masts move against the sky.<br>
  With measured creak of curving spars<br>
  Dhows gently to the jeweled stars<br>
  Rock out a lullaby.<br>
  <br>
  "Silver and black sleeps Zanzibar.<br>
  The moonlit ripples croon<br>
  Soft songs of loves that perfect are,<br>
  Long tales of red-lipped spoils of war,<br>
  And you&mdash;you smile, you moon!<br>
  <br>
  "For I think that beam on the placid sea<br>
  That splashes, and spreads, and dips, and gleams,<br>
  That dances and glides till it comes to me<br>
  Out of infinite sky, is the path of dreams,<br>
  And down that lane the memories run<br>
  Of all that's wild beneath the sun!"</p>

  <p>"You fellows like that one? Anybody coming? Nobody for Will to fight yet?
  Too bad! Well&mdash;we'll try a-gain! There's no chorus. It's all poetic
  stuff, too gentle to be yowled by three such cannibals as you! Listen!</p>

  <p>"Old as the moonlit silences, to-night's loves are the same As when for
  ivory from far, and cloves and gems of Zanzibar King Solomon's men came.</p>

  <p>"Sinful and still the same roofs lie that knew da Gama's heel, Those beams
  that light these sleepy waves looked on when men threw murdered slaves To
  make the sharks a meal. And I think that beam on the silvered swell That
  spreads, and splashes, and gleams, and dips, That has shone on the cruel and
  brave as well, On the trail o' the slaves and the ivory ships, Is the lane
  down which the memories run Of all that's wild beneath the sun."</p>

  <p>The concertina wailed into a sort of minor dirge and ceased. Fred fastened
  the catch, and put the instrument away.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you applaud?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, bravo, bravo!" said Will and I together.</p>

  <p>Monty looked hard at both of us.</p>

  <p>"Strange!" he remarked. "You're both distracted, and you've each got a
  slight cut over the jugular!"</p>

  <p>"Been trying out razors," said Yerkes.</p>

  <p>"Um-m-m!" remarked Monty. "Well&mdash;I'm glad it's no worse. How about
  bed, eh? Better lock your door&mdash;that lady upstairs is what the Germans
  call <i>gefährlich</i> !* Goo'night!"</p>

  <br>
  &mdash;from <i>The Njo Hapa Song</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">THERE is no public landing wharf at Zanzibar. Passengers
  have to submit their persons into the arms of loud-lunged Swahili
  longshoremen, who recognize one sole and only point of honor: neither
  passenger nor luggage shall be dropped into the surf.</p>

  <p>Their invariable habit, the instant the view-halloo is raised, is to
  scamper headlong, pounce on the victim and pull him apart (or so it feels)
  until fortune, superior strength, or some such element decides the point; and
  then more often than not it is the victim's fate to be carried between two
  men, each hold of a thigh, each determined to get ashore or to the boat
  first, and each grimly resolved not to let go until three times the proper
  fee shall have been paid. Of only these two things let the passenger assure
  himself&mdash;fight how he may, he will neither escape their clutches nor get
  wet. Rather they will hold him upside-down until the contents of his pockets
  fall into the surf. Dry on the beach or into the boat they will dump him. And
  whatever he shall pay them will surely be insufficient.</p>

  <p>But we had a privy councilor of England of our party, and favors were
  shown us that never fall to the lot of ordinary travelers. Opposite the
  Sultan's palace is the Sultan's private wharf, so royal and private that it
  is a prison offense to trespass on it without written permission. Because of
  his official call at the Residency, and of his card left on the Sultan, wires
  had been pulled, and a pompous individual whose black face sweated greasily,
  and whose palm itched for unearned increment, called on Monty very shortly
  after breakfast with intimation that the wharf had been placed at our
  disposal, since His Highness the Sultan desired to do us honor.</p>

  <p>So when the B. I. steamer dropped anchor in the great roadstead shortly
  after noon we were taken to the wharf by one of the Sultan's household
  &mdash;a very civil-spoken Arab gentleman&mdash;and three English officers
  met us there who made a fuss over Monty and were at pains to be agreeable to
  the rest of us. While we stood chatting and waiting for the boat that should
  row us and belongings the mile-and-a-half or so to the steamer, I saw
  something that made me start. Fred gazed presently in the same direction.</p>

  <p>"Johnson is number one!" he said, as if checking off my mental processes.
  He meant Hassan. "Number two is Georges Coutlass, our friend the Greek.
  Number three is&mdash;am I drunk this early in the day?&mdash;what do you
  see?&mdash;doesn't she look to you like?&mdash;by the big blind god of men's
  mistakes it's&mdash;Monty! Didums, you deaf idiot, look! See!"</p>

  <p>At that everybody naturally looked the same way. Everybody nodded.
  Coutlass the Greek, and Hassan, reputed nephew of Tippoo Tib, were headed in
  one boat toward the steamer, the worse for the handling, but right side up
  and no angrier than the usual passenger. Following them was another boat
  containing a motley assortment of Arabs and part-Arabs, who might, or might
  not be associated with them.</p>

  <p>On the beach still, surrounded yet by a swarm of longshoremen who yelled
  and fought, Lady Isobel Saffren Waldon and her Syrian maid stood at bay. Her
  two Swahili men-servants were overwhelmed and already being carried to a
  boat. Her luggage was being borne helter-skelter after them, and another boat
  waited for her just beyond the belt of surf, the rowers standing up to yell
  encouragement at the sweating pack that dared not close in on its victims.
  Lady Isobel Saffren Waldon appeared to have no other weapon than a parasol,
  but she had plainly the upper hand.</p>

  <p>"She has a way with her with natives," said the senior officer
  present.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity," said Monty. "I mean, one scarcely likes to use this wharf
  and watch that."</p>

  <p>"Quite so. Yet we daren't accord her official recognition. She'd be
  certain to make capital out of it. We're awfully glad she's going. The
  Residency atmosphere is one huge sigh of relief. We would like to speed the
  parting guest, but it mayn't be done. However, you'll know there are others
  not so particular. I imagine her friends are late for the appointment."</p>

  <p>"Where's she going?" asked Monty.</p>

  <p>"British East Africa."</p>

  <p>"Mombasa?"</p>

  <p>"And then on. She has drafts on a German merchant in Nairobi."</p>

  <p>From that moment until we were safely in our quarters on the steamer
  Monty's attitude became one of rigid indifference toward her or anything to
  do with her. The British officers went out to the steamer with us, but all
  the way Monty only talked of the climate, trade conditions, and the other
  subjects to which polite conversation of Africa's east coast is limited. Fred
  kept nudging him, but Monty took no notice. Yerkes whispered to Fred. Then I
  heard Fred whisper to Monty in one of those raucous asides that he perfectly
  well knows can be heard by everybody.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you ask 'em about her, you ass?"</p>

  <p>But Monty refused to rise. He talked of the bowed and ancient slaves of
  Zanzibar, who refused in those days to be set free and afforded prolific
  ground for attack on British public morals by people whose business it is to
  abuse England for her peccadillos and forget her virtues.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* In 1914 there were still thousands of slaves in German
  East, although the German press and public were ever loudest in their
  condemnation of British conditions. Author's footnote. ]</p>

  <p>We reached the ship, and were watching our piles of luggage arrive up the
  accommodation ladder when the solution of Lady Isobel Saffren Waldon's
  problem appeared. She arrived alongside in the official boat of the German
  consulate, a German officer in white uniform on either hand, and the German
  ensign at the stern.</p>

  <p>"Pretty fair impudence, paying official honors to our undesirables, yet I
  don't see what we can do," said the senior from the Residency.</p>

  <p>Yerkes drew me aside.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever see anything more stupidly British?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"It's as obvious as the nose on your face that she's up to some game. It's
  as plain as twice two that the Germans are backing her whether the British
  like it or not. Look at those two Heinies now!"</p>

  <p>We faced about and watched them. After bowing Lady Waldon to her cabin,
  they approached our party with brazen claim to recognition&mdash;and received
  it. They were met, and spoken to apparently as cordially as if their
  friendship had been indisputable.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever see anything to beat it? Why not kick 'em into the sea?
  Either that woman's a crook or she isn't. If she isn't, then the British have
  treated her shamefully, turning their backs on her. But we know she is a
  crook! And so do they. The Germans know it, too, and they're flaunting her
  under official British noses! They're using her to start something the
  British won't like, and the British know it! Yet she's going to be allowed to
  travel to British territory on a British ship, and the Heinies are shaken
  hands with! If you complained to Monty I bet he'd say, 'Don't talk fight
  unless you mean fight!'"</p>

  <p>"Monty might also add, 'Don't talk-fight!"' said I.</p>

  <p>"Oh, rot!" Will answered. "British individuals may bridle a bit, but their
  government'll shut its eyes until too late, whatever happens! You mark my
  words!"</p>

  <p>We strolled back toward our party in great discontent, I as much as he,
  never supposing there was another country in the world that could so
  deliberately shut its eyes to dog's work until absolutely forced to
  interfere, by a hair not quite too late.</p>

  <p>Coutlass and Hassan traveled second-class&mdash;the Arab and half-Arab
  contingent third&mdash;and none of them troubled us, at present, except that
  Will swore at sight of Coutlass swaggering as if the ship and her contents
  were all his.</p>

  <p>"To bear him brag you'd believe the British government afraid of him!" he
  grumbled.</p>

  <p>But an immediate problem drove Coutlass out of mind. Lady Isobel Saffren
  Waldon had been given a cabin in line-with ours, at the end of our corridor.
  Her maid, and her two Swahili servants were obliged to pass our doors to get
  to her cabin at all. As nearly all ships' cabins on those hot routes do, ours
  intercommunicated by a metal grill for ventilating purposes, and a word
  spoken in one cabin above a whisper could be heard in the next.</p>

  <p>Fred was the first to realize conditions. He opened his door in his usual
  abrupt way to visit Monty's cabin and almost fell over the Syrian maid, her
  eye at Monty's key-hole&mdash;a little too early in the game to pass for
  sound judgment, as Fred was at pains to assure her.</p>

  <p>The alarm being given, we locked our cabin doors, repaired to the smoking-
  room, and ordered drinks at a center table where no eavesdropper could
  overhear.</p>

  <p>"It's one of two things," said Monty. He had his folding board out, and we
  did not doubt he would play chess from there to London. "Either they know
  exactly where that ivory is, or they haven't the slightest idea."</p>

  <p>"My, but you're wise!" said Will.</p>

  <p>Monty ignored him. "They suspect us of knowing. They mean to prevent our
  getting any of it. If they do know, they've some reason of their own for not
  getting it themselves at present. If they don't know, they suspect we know
  and intend to claim what we find."</p>

  <p>"How should they think we know?" objected Will. "The first we ever heard
  of the stuff was in the lazaretto in Zanzibar."</p>

  <p>"True. Juma told us. Juma probably told them that we told him. Natives
  often put the cart before the horse without the slightest intention of
  lying."</p>

  <p>"All the same, why should they believe him?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? Zanzibar's agog with the story&mdash;after all these years. The
  ivory must have been buried more than a quarter of a century ago. Some one's
  been stirring the mud. We arrive, unexpectedly from nowhere, ask questions
  about the ivory, make plans for British East Africa&mdash;and there you are!
  The people who were merely determined to get the stuff jump to the false
  conclusion that we really know where it is."</p>

  <p>"Q. E. D.!" said Fred, finishing his drink.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," said Monty. "There are two things yet to be demonstrated.
  They're true, but not proven. The German government is after the staff. And
  the German government has very special reasons for secrecy and tricks."</p>

  <p>"We four against the German government looks like longish odds," said
  I.</p>

  <p>"Remains to be seen," said Monty. "If the German government's very special
  reasons were legal or righteous they'd be announced with a fanfare of
  trumpets."</p>

  <p>"Where's all this leading us?" demanded Fred.</p>

  <p>"To a slight change of plan," said Monty.</p>

  <p>"Thank the lord! That means you don't go to Brussels&mdash;stay with
  us!"</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the sort, Fred. But you three keep together. They're going to
  watch you. You watch them. Watch Schillingschen particularly closely, if you
  find him. The closer they watch you, the more likely they are to lose sight
  of me. I'll take care to have several red herrings drawn across my trail
  after I reach London. Perhaps I'll return down the west coast and travel up
  the Congo River. At any rate, when I do come, and whichever way I come, I'll
  have everything legal, in writing. Let your game be to seem mysterious. Seem
  to know more than you do, but don't tell anybody anything. Above all,
  listen!"</p>

  <p>Fred leaned back in his chair and laughed.</p>

  <p>"Didums!" he said. "This is the idioticest wild goose chase we ever
  started on! I admit I nosed it. I gave tongue first. But think of it&mdash;
  here we are&mdash;four sensible men&mdash;hitherto sensible&mdash;off after
  ivory that nobody can really prove exists, said to be buried somewhere in a
  tract of half-explored country more than a thousand miles each way &mdash;and
  the German government, and half the criminals in Africa already on our
  idiotic heels!"</p>

  <p>"Yet the German government and the crooks seem convinced, too, that
  there's something worth looking for!" laughed Monty. And none of us could
  answer that.</p>

  <p>For that matter, none of us would have been willing to withdraw from the
  search, however dim the prospect of success might seem in the intervals when
  cold reason shed its comfortless rays on us. Intuition, or whatever it is
  that has proved superior so often to worldly wisdom (temptation, Fred calls
  it!) outweighed reason, and Fred himself would have been last to agree to
  forego the search.</p>

  <p>The voyage is short between Zanzibar and Mombasa, but there was incident.
  We were spied on after very thorough fashion, Lady Saffren Waldon's title and
  gracious bearing (when that suited her) being practical weapons. The purser
  was Goanese&mdash;beside himself with the fumes of flattery. He had a
  pass-key, so the Syrian maid went through our cabins and searched thoroughly
  everything except the wallet of important papers that Monty kept under his
  shirt. The first and second officers were rather young, unmarried men
  possessed of limitless ignorance of the wiles of such as Lady Waldon. It was
  they who signed a paper recommending Coutlass to the B. I. agents and a lot
  of other reputable people in Mombasa and elsewhere, thus offsetting the
  possibility that the authorities might not let him land. (Had we known all
  that at the time, Monty's word against him might have caused him to be
  shipped back whence he came, but we did not find it out until afterward; nor
  did we know the law.)</p>

  <p>And at Mombasa we made our first united, serious mistake. It was put to
  the vote. We all agreed.</p>

  <p>"I can come ashore," said Monty, "introduce you to officialdom, get you
  put up for the club, and be useful generally. That, though, 'll lend color to
  the theory that you're in league with me&mdash;whereas, if I leave you to
  your own resources, that may help lose my scent. When they pick it up again
  we'll be knowing better where we stand."</p>

  <p>"If you came ashore for a few hours we'd have the benefit of your
  prestige," said I.</p>

  <p>"I admit it."</p>

  <p>"I suspect a title's mighty near as useful on British territory as in
  N'York or Boston," said Will. "We'd bask in smiles."</p>

  <p>"Not wholly," said Monty. "There's another side to that. There's an
  English official element that would rather be rude to some poor devil with a
  title than draw pay (and it loves its pay, you may believe me!). You'd have
  friends in high places, but make enemies, too, if I go ashore with you."</p>

  <p>"What's your own proposal?" Fred demanded.</p>

  <p>"I've stated it. I want you fellows to choose. There's no need of me
  ashore&mdash;that's to say, I've a draft to bearer for the amount you three
  have in the common fund&mdash;here, take it. If you think you'll need more
  than that, then I'll have to go to the bank with you and cash some of my own
  draft. I think you'll have enough."</p>

  <p>"Plenty," said Will.</p>

  <p>"Let's send him home!" proposed Fred.</p>

  <p>"How about communications?" We had contrived a code already with the aid
  of a pocket Portuguese-English dictionary, of which Fred and Monty each
  possessed a similar edition.</p>

  <p>"The Mombasa Bank, Will. You keep them posted as to your whereabouts. When
  I write the bank manager I'll ask him to keep my address a secret."</p>

  <p>So we said good-bye to Monty and left him on board, and wished we hadn't a
  dozen times before noon next day, and a hundred times within the week. The
  last sight we had of him was as the shore boat came alongside the wharf and
  the half-breed customs officials pounced smiling on us. My eyes were keenest.
  I could see Monty pacing the upper deck, too rapidly for evidence of peace of
  mind&mdash;a straight-standing, handsome figure of a man. I pointed him out
  to the others, and we joked about him. Then the gloom of the customs shed
  swallowed us, and there was a new earth and, for the present, no more
  sea.</p>

  <p>The island of Mombasa is so close to the coconut-fringed mainland that a
  railway bridge connects them. Like Zanzibar, it is a place of strange
  delights, and bridled lawlessness controlled by the veriest handful of
  Englishmen. There are strange hotels&mdash;strange dwellings&mdash;
  streets&mdash;stores&mdash;tongues and faces. The great grim fort that brave
  da Gama built, and held against all comers, dominates the sea front and the
  lower town. The brass-lunged boys who pounce on baggage, fight for it, and
  tout for the grandly named hotels are of as many tribes as sizes, as many
  tongues as tribes.</p>

  <p>Everything is different&mdash;everything strange&mdash;everything, except
  the heat, delightful. And as Fred said, "some folk would grumble in hell!"
  Trees, flowers, birds, costumes of the women, sheen of the sea, glint of sun
  on bare skins of every shade from ivory to ebony, dazzling coral roadway and
  colored coral walls, babel of tongues, sack-saddled donkeys sleepily bearing
  loads of coral for new buildings, and&mdash;winding in and out among it
  all&mdash;the narrow-gauge tramway on which trolleys pushed by stocky little
  black men carry officialdom gratis, and the rest of the world and his wife
  according to tariff; all those things are the alphabet of Mombasa's charm.
  Arranged, and rearranged&mdash;by chance, by individual perspective, and by
  point of view&mdash;they spell fascination, attractiveness, glamour, mystery.
  And no acquaintance with Mombasa, however intimate or old, dispels the charm
  to the man not guilty of cynicism. To the cynic (and for him) there are
  sin&mdash;as Africa alone knows how to sin &mdash;disease, of the dread
  zymotic types&mdash;and death; death peering through the doors of godowns,
  where the ivory tusks are piled; death in the dark back-streets of the
  bazaar, where tired policemen wage lop-sided warfare against insanitary
  habits and a quite impracticable legal code; death on the beach, where
  cannibal crabs parade in thousands and devour all helpless things; death in
  the scrub (all green and beautiful) where the tiny streets leave off and
  snakes claim heritage; death in the grim red desert beyond the coast-line,
  where lean, hopeless jackals crack today men's dry bones left fifty years ago
  by the slave caravans&mdash;marrowless bones long since stripped clean by the
  ants. But we are not all cynics.</p>

  <p>Last to be cynic or pessimist was Louis McGregor Abraham, proprietor of
  the Imperial Hotel&mdash;Syrian by birth, Jew by creed, Englishman by
  nationality, and admirer first, last and all the time of all things
  prosperous and promising, except his rival, the Hotel Royal.</p>

  <p>"You came to the right place," he assured us when the last hot porter had
  dumped the last of our belongings on the porch, had ceased from chattering to
  watch Fred's financial methods, had been paid double the customary price, and
  had gone away grumbling (to laugh at us behind our backs). "They'd have
  rooked you at the other hole&mdash;underfed you, overcharged you, and filled
  you full of lies. I tell the truth to folk who come to my hotel."</p>

  <p>And he did, some of it. He was inexhaustible, unconquerable, tireless, an
  optimist always. He had a store that was part of the hotel, in which he
  claimed to sell "everything the mind of man could wish for in East Africa;"
  and the boast was true. He even sold American dime novels.</p>

  <p>"East Africa's a great country!" he kept assuring us. "Some day we'll all
  be rich! Have to get ready for it! Have to be prepared! Have to stock
  everything the mind of man can want, to encourage new arrivals and make the
  old ones feel at home. Lose a little money, but why grumble? Get it back when
  the boom comes. As it will, mind you. As it will. Can't help it. Richest
  country in the world&mdash;grow anything&mdash;find anything&mdash;game
  &mdash;climate&mdash;elevation&mdash;scenery&mdash;natives by the million to
  do the work&mdash;all good! Only waiting for white men with energy, and
  capital to start things really moving!"</p>

  <p>But there were other points of view. We went to the bank, and found its
  manager conservative. The amount of the draft we placed to our credit insured
  politeness.</p>

  <p>"Be cautious," he advised us. "Take a good look round before you commit
  yourselves!"</p>

  <p>He agreed to manage the interchange of messages between us and Monty, and
  invited us all to dinner that evening at the club; so we left the bank
  feeling friendly and more confident. Later, a chance-met English official
  showed us over the old fort (now jail) where men of more breeds and sorts
  than Noah knew, better clothed and fed than ever in their lives, drew endless
  supplies of water in buckets from da Gama's well.</p>

  <p>"Some of them have to be kicked out when their sentences expire!" he told
  us. "See you at the club tonight. Glad to help welcome you."</p>

  <p>But there was a shock in store, and as time passed the shocks increased in
  number and intensity. Our guns had not been surrendered to us by the customs
  people. We had paid duty on them second-hand at the rate for new ones, and
  had then been told to apply for them at the collector's office, where our
  names and the guns' numbers would be entered on the register&mdash;for a
  fee.</p>

  <p>We now went to claim them, and on the way down inquired at a store about
  ammunition. We were told that before we could buy cartridges we would need a
  permit from the collector specifying how many, and of what bore we might buy.
  There was an Arab in the store ahead of us. He was buying Martini Henry
  cartridges. I asked whether he had a permit, and was told he did not need
  one.</p>

  <p>"Being an Arab?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Being well known to the government," was the answer.</p>

  <p>We left the store feeling neither quite so confident nor friendly. And the
  collector's Goanese assistant did the rest of the disillusioning.</p>

  <p>No, we could not have our guns. No, we could have no permit for
  ammunition. No, the collector was not in the office. No, he would not be
  there that afternoon. It was provided in regulations that we could have
  neither guns, sporting licenses, nor permits for ammunition. The guns were
  perfectly safe in the government godown&mdash;would not be tampered with
  &mdash;would be returned to us when we chose to leave the country.</p>

  <p>"But, good God, we've paid duty on them!" Oakes protested.</p>

  <p>"You should not have brought the guns with you unless you desired to pay
  duty," said the Goanese.</p>

  <p>"But where's the collector?" Yerkes demanded.</p>

  <p>"I am only assistant," was the answer. "How should I know?"</p>

  <p>The man's insolence, of demeanor and words, was unveiled, and the more we
  argued with him the more sullen and evasive he grew, until at last he ordered
  us out of the office. At that we took chairs and announced our intention of
  staying until the collector should come or be fetched. We were informed that
  the collector was the most important government official in Mombasa&mdash;
  information that so delighted Fred that he grew almost good tempered
  again.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather twist a big tail than a little one!" he announced. "Shall we
  sing to pass the time?"</p>

  <p>The Goanese called for the askari, half-soldier, half-police-man, who
  drowsed in meek solitude outside the office door.</p>

  <p>"Remove these people, please!" he said in English, and then repeated it in
  Kiswahili.</p>

  <p>The askari eyed us, shifted his bare feet uncomfortably, screwed up his
  courage, tried to look stern, and said something in his own tongue.</p>

  <p>"Put them out, I said!" said the Goanese.</p>

  <p>"He orders you to put us out!" grinned Fred.</p>

  <p>"The office closes at three," said the Goanese, glancing at the clock in a
  half-hearted effort to moderate his own daring.</p>

  <p>"Not unless the collector comes and closes it himself, it doesn't!" Fred
  announced with folded arms.</p>

  <p>Will pulled out two rupees and offered them to the sentry.</p>

  <p>"Go and bring us some food," he said. "We intend to stay in here until
  your bwana makubwa* comes."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Bwana makubwa</i> (Swahili)&mdash;literally, big
  master; a senior government officer. See entries for <a href=

  <p>The sentry refused the money, waving it aside with the air of a Caesar
  declining a crown.</p>

  <p>"Gee!" exclaimed Will. "You've got to hand it to the British if they train
  colored police to refuse money."</p>

  <p>The askari, it seemed, was a man of more than one kind of discretion.
  Without another word to the Goanese he saluted the lot of us with a sweep of
  his arm, turned on his heel and vanished&mdash;not stopping in his hurry to
  put on the sandals that lay on the door-step. We amused ourselves while he
  was gone by flying questions at the Goanese, calculated to disturb what might
  be left of his equanimity without giving him ground for lawsuits.</p>

  <p>"How old are you?"&mdash;"How much pay do you get?"&mdash;"How long have
  you held your job?"&mdash;"Do you ever get drunk?"&mdash;"Are you
  married?"&mdash;"Does your wife love you?"&mdash;"Do you keep white
  mice?"&mdash;"Is your life insured?"&mdash;"How often have you been in
  jail?"&mdash;"Are you honest?"&mdash;"Are you vaccinated against the
  jim-jams?"&mdash;"Why is your name Fernandez and not Braganza?"</p>

  <p>The man was about distracted, for he had been unwise enough to try to
  answer, when suddenly the collector came in great haste and stalked through
  the office into the inner room.</p>

  <p>"Fernandez!" he called as he passed, and the Goanese hurried after him,
  hugely relieved. There was five minute's consultation behind the partition in
  tones too low for us to catch more than a word or two, and then Fernandez
  came out again with a "Now wait and see, my hearties!" smile on his face. He
  was actually rubbing his palms together, sure of a swift revenge.</p>

  <p>"He says you are to go in there," he announced.</p>

  <p>So we filed in, Fred Oakes first, and it seemed to me the moment I saw the
  collector's face that the outlook was not so depressing. He looked neither
  young nor incompetent. His jaw was neither receding nor too prominent. His
  neck sat on his shoulders with the air of full responsibility, unsought but
  not refused. And his eyes looked straight into those of each of us in turn
  with a frank challenge no honest fellow could resent.</p>

  <p>"Take seats, won't you," he said. "Your names, please?"</p>

  <p>We told him, and he wrote them down.</p>

  <p>"My clerk tells me you tried to bribe the askari. You shouldn't do that.
  We are at great pains to keep the police dependable. It's too bad to put
  temptation in their way."</p>

  <p>Will, with cold precision, told him the exact facts. He listened to the
  end, and then laughed.</p>

  <p>"One more Goanese mistake!" he said. "We have to employ them. They mean
  well. The country has no money to spend on European office assistants. Well
  &mdash;what can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>At that Fred cut loose.</p>

  <p>"We want our guns before dark!" he said. "It's the first time my character
  has been questioned by any government, and I say the same for my
  friends!"</p>

  <p>"Oh?" said the collector, eying us strangely.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" said Fred.</p>

  <p>"That is so," said I.</p>

  <p>"Entirely so," said Will.</p>

  <p>"I have information," said the collector, tapping with a pencil on his
  blotter, "that you men are ivory hunters. That you left Portuguese territory
  because the German consul there had to request the Portuguese government to
  expel you."</p>

  <p>"All easily disproved," said Fred. "Confront us, please, with our
  accusers."</p>

  <p>"And that Lord Montdidier, with whom you have been traveling, became so
  disgusted with your conduct that he refused to land with you at this port as
  he at first intended!"</p>

  <p>We all three gasped. The first thing that occurred to me, and I suppose to
  all of us, was to send for Monty. His steamer was not supposed to sail for an
  hour yet. But the thought had hardly flashed in mind when we heard the roar
  of steam and clanking as the anchor chain came home. The sound traveled over
  water and across roofs like the knell of good luck&mdash;the clanking of the
  fetters of ill fate.</p>

  <p>"Where's her next stop?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Suez," Fred answered.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously then to all three the thought came too that this
  interpretation of Monty's remaining on board was exactly what we wanted. The
  more people suspected us of acting independently of him the better.</p>

  <p>"Confront us with our accusers!" Fred insisted.</p>

  <p>"You are not accused&mdash;at least not legally," said the collector. "You
  are refused rifle and ammunition permits, that is all."</p>

  <p>"On the ground of being ivory hunters?"</p>

  <p>"Suspected persons&mdash;not known to the government&mdash;something
  rather stronger than rumor to your discredit, and nothing known in your
  favor."</p>

  <p>"What recourse have we?" Fred demanded.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;what proof can you offer that you are bona fide travelers or
  intending settlers? Are you ivory hunters or not?"</p>

  <p>"I'll answer that," said Fred&mdash;dexterously I thought, "when I've seen
  a copy of the game laws. We're law-abiding men."</p>

  <p>The collector handed us a well thumbed copy of the Red Book.</p>

  <p>"They're all in that," he said. "I'll lend it to you, or you can buy one
  almost anywhere in town. If you decide after reading that to go farther up
  country I'm willing to issue provisional game licenses, subject to
  confirmation after I've looked into any evidence you care to submit on your
  own behalf. You can have your guns against a cash deposit&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How big?"</p>

  <p>"Two hundred rupees for each gun!"</p>

  <p>Fred laughed. The demand was intended to be away over our heads. The
  collector bridled.</p>

  <p>"But no ammunition," he went on, "until your claim to respectability has
  been confirmed. By the way, the only claim you've made to me is for the guns.
  You've told me nothing about yourselves."</p>

  <p>"Two hundred a gun?" said Fred. "Counting a pistol or revolver as one?"
  Three guns apiece&mdash;nine guns&mdash;eighteen hundred rupees'
  deposit?"</p>

  <p>The collector nodded with a sort of grim pleasure in his own
  unreasonableness. Fred drew out our new check book.</p>

  <p>"You fellows agreeable?" he asked, and we nodded.</p>

  <p>"Here's a check on the Mombasa Bank for ten thousand, and your government
  can have as much more again if it wants it," he said. "Make me out a receipt
  please, and write on it what it's for."</p>

  <p>The collector wrote. He was confused, for he had to tear up more than one
  blank.</p>

  <p>"I suppose we get interest on the money at the legal local rate?" asked
  Fred maliciously.</p>

  <p>"I'll inquire about that," said the collector.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me," said Fred, "but I'm going to give you some advice. While
  you're inquiring, look into the antecedents of Lady Isobel Saffren Waldon!
  It's she who gave out the tip against us. Her tip's a bad one. So is
  she."</p>

  <p>"She hasn't applied for guns or a license," the collector answered tartly.
  "It's people who want to carry firearms&mdash;people able and likely to make
  trouble whom we keep an eye on."</p>

  <p>"She's more likely to make trouble for you than a burning house!" put in
  Will Yerkes. "If my partner hadn't paid you that check I'd be all for having
  this business out! I'm going to let them know in the States what sort of
  welcome people receive at this port!"</p>

  <p>"You came of your own accord. You weren't invited," the collector
  answered.</p>

  <p>"That's a straight-out lie!" snapped Will. "You know it's a lie! Why,
  there isn't a newspaper in South Africa that hasn't been carrying ads of this
  country for months past. Even papers I've had sent me from the States have
  carried press-agent dope about it. Why, you've been yelling for settlers like
  a kid squalling for milk&mdash;and you say we're not invited now we've come
  here! I'm going to write and tell the U.S. papers what that dope is
  worth!"</p>

  <p>"Ivory hunters are not settlers," the collector interjected.</p>

  <p>"Who said we're ivory hunters?" Will was in a fine rage, and Fred and I
  leaned back to enjoy the official's discomfort. "Besides, your ads bragged
  about the big game as one of the chief attractions! All the information you
  can possibly have against us must have come from a female crook in the pay of
  the German government! You're not behaving the way gentlemen do where I was
  raised!"</p>

  <p>"There is no intention to offend," said the collector.</p>

  <p>"Intention is good!" said Will, laughing in spite of himself. "There's
  another thing I want to know. What about ammunition? We're to have our guns.
  They're useless without cartridges. What about it?"</p>

  <p>"The guns shall be sent to your hotel tonight. The provisional sporting
  licenses&mdash;if you want them&mdash;will be ready tomorrow morning
  &mdash;seven hundred and fifty rupees apiece&mdash;I'll charge them against
  your deposit. If the licenses should be confirmed after inquiry, I will send
  you permits through the post for fifty rounds of ammunition each."</p>

  <p>Will snorted. Fred Oakes yelled with laughter, and I gaped with
  indignation.</p>

  <p>"I'm going into this to the hilt!" spluttered Fred. "I wouldn't have
  missed it for a fortune! We three are going to constitute ourselves a
  committee of inspection. We're going to wander the country over and report
  home to the newspapers&mdash;South African&mdash;British&mdash;U.S.A.
  &mdash;and any other part of the world that's interested! We won't worry
  about ammunition. Send us permits for whatever quantity seems to you proper,
  and we'll note it all down in our diaries!"</p>

  <p>We all stood up, the collector obviously uncomfortable and we, if not at
  ease, at least happier than we had been.</p>

  <p>Fred nodded to the collector genially, and we all walked out.</p>

  <p>Mombasa is a fairly large island, but the built-over part of it is small,
  so it was not surprising that we should emerge from the office face to face
  with Lady Saffren Waldon. She was the one surprised, not we. She probably
  thought she had spiked our guns in that part of the world forever, and the
  sight of us coming laughing from the very office where we should have been
  made glum must have been disconcerting.</p>

  <p>She was riding on one of the little trolley-cars, pushed by two boys in
  white official uniform, dressed in her flimsiest best, a lace parasol across
  her knee, and beside her an obvious member of the government&mdash;young, and
  so recently from home as not to have lost his pink cheeks yet.</p>

  <p>Had there not been an awning over the trolley-car she might have used the
  parasol to make believe she had not seen us. But the awning precluded that,
  and we were not more than two or three yards away.</p>

  <p>"Laugh!" whispered Fred.</p>

  <p>So we crossed the track laughing and the trolley had to pause to let us
  by. We laughed as we raised our helmets to her&mdash;laughed both at her and
  at the pink and white puppy she had taken in leash. And then the sort of
  thing happened that nearly always does when men with a reasonable faith in
  their own integrity make up their minds to see opprobrium through. Fate
  stepped hard on our arm of the balance.</p>

  <p>If built-over Mombasa is a small place, so is Africa. So is the world.
  Striding down the hill from the other hotel, the rival one, the Royal, came a
  man so well known in so many lands that they talk of naming a tenth of a
  continent after him&mdash;the mightiest hunter since Nimrod, and very likely
  mightier than he; surely more looked-up to and respected&mdash;a little,
  wiry-looking, freckled, wizened man whose beard had once been red, who walked
  with a decided limp and blinked genially from under the brim of a very neat
  khaki helmet.</p>

  <p>"Why, bless my soul if it isn't Fred Oakes!" he exclaimed, in a squeaky,
  worn-out voice that is as well known as his face, and quickened his pace
  down-hill.</p>

  <p>"Courtney!" said Fred. "There's only one man I'd rather meet!"</p>

  <p>The little man laughed. "Oh, you and your Montdidier are still
  inseparable, I suppose! How are you, Fred? I'm glad to see you. Who are your
  friends?"</p>

  <p>At that minute out came the collector from his office&mdash;stood on the
  step, and stared. Fred introduced us to Courtney, and I experienced the
  thrill of shaking hands with the man accounts of whose exploits had fired my
  schoolboy imagination and made stay-at-home life forever after an
  impossibility.</p>

  <p>"I missed the steamer, Fred. Not another for a week. Going down now to see
  about a passage to Somaliland. I suppose you'll be at the club after
  dinner?"</p>

  <p>"No" said Fred. "We've an invitation, but I think we'll send a note and
  say we can't come. We'll dine at our hotel and sit on the veranda
  afterward."</p>

  <p>I wondered what Fred was driving at, and so did the collector who was
  headed across the street and listening with all ears.</p>

  <p>"That so? Not a bad idea. They've very kindly made me an honorary member
  of the club, but I rather expect there's a string to that&mdash;eh, Fred,
  don't you? They'll expect stories,&mdash;stories. I get tired of telling the
  same tales so many times over. Suppose I join you fellows, eh? I'm at the
  Royal. You at the other place? Suppose I join you after dinner, and we have a
  pipe together on the veranda?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing I'd like better," said Fred, and I felt too pleased with the
  prospect to say anything at all. Growing old is a foolish and unnecessary
  business, but there is no need to forego while young the thrills of unashamed
  hero-worship; in fact, that is one of the ways of continuing young. It is
  only the disillusioned (poor deceived ones) and the cynics, who grow old
  ungracefully.</p>

  <p>We went upstreet, through the shadow of the great grim fort. The trolley-
  car trundled down among the din, smells and colors of the business-end of
  town. Looking over my shoulder I saw Courtney talking to the collector.</p>

  <p>"We're getting absolution, Fred!" said I.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure we need it," Fred answered. "I hope Courtney won't tell too
  much!" So quickly does a man jump from praying for friends at court to
  fearing them!</p>

  <p>"Courtney looked to me," said Will, "like a man who would give no games
  away."</p>

  <p>Glad you think that of him" said Fred.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Tell you later, maybe."</p>

  <p>But he did not tell until after dinner. (It was a good dinner for East
  Africa. Shark steak figured in it, under a more respectable name; and there
  was zebu hump, guinea-fowl, and more different kinds of fruit than a man
  could well remember.) When it was over we sat in deep armchairs on the long
  wide veranda that fronts the whole hotel. The evening sea-breeze came and
  wafted in on us the very scents of Araby; the night sounds that whisper of
  wilderness gave the lie to a tinkling guitar that somewhere in the distance
  spoke of civilized delights. The surf crooned on coral half a mile away, and
  very good cigar smoke (from a box that Monty had sent ashore with our
  belongings) supplemented coffee and the other aids to physical contentment.
  Then, limping between the armchairs, and ashamed that we should rise to greet
  him&mdash;motioning us down again with a little nervous laugh&mdash; Courtney
  came to us. Within five minutes of his coming the world, and the clock, and
  the laws of men might have all reversed themselves for aught we cared.
  Without really being conscious he was doing it Courtney plunged into our
  problem, grasped it, sized it up, advised us, flooded us with priceless,
  wonderful advice, and did it with such almost feminine sympathy that I
  believe we would have been telling him our love-affairs at last, if a glance
  at the watch he wore in a case at his belt had not told him it was three A.
  M.</p>

  <p>"There's trouble" he began when he had filled his pipe. "You boys are in
  trouble. What is it?" he asked, shifting and twitching in his seat&mdash;
  refusing an armchair&mdash;refusing a drink.</p>

  <p>"Tell us first what's the matter with you," said Fred.</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing. An old wound. A lion once dragged me by this shoulder half a
  mile or so. At this time of year I get pains. They last a day or two, then
  pass&mdash;Go on, tell me!"</p>

  <p>He never sat really still once that whole evening, yet never once
  complained or made a gesture of impatience.</p>

  <p>"I propose," said Fred, with a glance at Yerkes and me, "to tell Courtney
  everything without reserve."</p>

  <p>The little old hunter nodded, watching us with bright blue eyes. I
  received the impression that he knew more secrets than he could tell should
  he talk down all the years that might be left him. He was the sort of man in
  whom nearly every one confides.</p>

  <p>"We're after Tippoo Tib's ivory!" said Fred, plunging into the middle of
  things. "Monty has gone to drive a bargain with the King of Belgium. Do you
  think it's a wild goose chase?"</p>

  <p>Courtney chuckled. "No," he said. "I wouldn't call it that. They've been
  killing elephants in Africa ever since the flood. Ivory must have
  accumulated. It's somewhere. Some of it must be so old and well seasoned as
  to be practically priceless, unless rats have spoiled it. Rats play old Harry
  with ivory, you know."</p>

  <p>"Have you a notion where it is?" demanded Fred.</p>

  <p>Courtney laughed. "Behold me leaving the country!" he said. "If I knew I'd
  look. If I saw I'd take!"</p>

  <p>"Can you give us a hint?"</p>

  <p>"There are caves near the summit of Mount Elgon that would hold the
  world's revenues. None of them have ever been thoroughly explored. Cannibals
  live in some of them. Cannibals and caverns is a combination that might
  appeal to Tippoo Tib, but there's no likelihood that he buried all that ivory
  in one place, you know. I suspect the greater part is in the Congo, and that
  the Germans know its whereabouts within a mile or two."</p>

  <p>"How did they discover it?"</p>

  <p>"Why don't they dig it out?"</p>

  <p>"What keeps 'em from turning their knowledge into money?"</p>

  <p>We had forgotten our own troubles. Courtney, too, seemed to forget for the
  moment that he had began by asking us a question.</p>

  <p>"Remember Emin Pasha?* When was it&mdash;'87&mdash;'88&mdash;'89 that
  Stanley went and rescued him? Perhaps you recall what was then described as
  Emin's ingratitude after the event? British government offered him a billet.
  Khedive of Egypt cabled him the promise of a job, all on Stanley's
  recommendation. Emin turned 'em all down and accepted a job from the Germans.
  Nobody understood it at the time. My own idea is that Emin thought he knew
  more or less where that hoard is. He didn't really want to come away with
  Stanley, you know. Being a German, I suppose he preferred to share his secret
  with his own crowd. I dare say he thought of telling Stanley but judged that
  the 'Rock breaker' might demand a too large share. The value of the stuff
  must be so enormous that it's almost worth going to war about, from the point
  of view of a nation hungry for new colonies. Emin is dead, and it's likely he
  left no exact particulars behind him. To my personal knowledge the Germans
  have had a swarm of spies for a long time operating beyond the Congo
  border."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Emin Pasha</i> (1840-1892)&mdash;a German explorer,
  whose original name was Eduard Schnitzer. A physician, he served (1876-1878)
  under Gen. Charles Gordon in Sudan as a district medical officer. In 1878 he
  succeeded Gordon as governor of Equatoria, the southernmost province of the
  Egyptian Sudan. In 1885 he was cut off from the outside world by the Mahdist
  uprising, and several European explorers&mdash;including Sir H. M.
  Stanley&mdash;were sent to rescue him. Although his position was not
  desperate, he agreed (1889) at length to accompany Stanley to Mombasa. He was
  murdered while engaged in exploration for Germany in the region of Lake
  Tanganyika. <i><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/65/em/EminPash.html">The
  Columbia Encyclopedia</a></i>, 6th edition. For more information, see the
  <i>Wikipedia</i> article <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emin_Pasha">Emin Pasha</a>. ]</p>

  <p>"Were you looking for the stuff yourself?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," he laughed. "But when I'm hunting I look about me. I'll tell you
  where the stuff may possibly be. There's a section of country called the Bahr
  el Gazal that the Congo people claim, but that I believe will eventually
  prove to lie on the British side of the boundary. It was good elephant
  country&mdash;which is to say bad living and traveling for man&mdash; since
  the earth took shape out of ooze. Awful swampy, malarious, densely wooded,
  dangerous country, sparsely inhabited by savages not averse to cannibalism
  when they've opportunity. The ivory may be there. If the Germans know it's
  there they're naturally afraid the British government would claim the whole
  district the minute the secret was out. Their plan may possibly be to wait
  until a boundary dispute arises in the ordinary course of time (keeping a
  cautious eye on the cache meanwhile, of course) and then take the Congo
  government side. If they can contrive to have it acknowledged as Congo
  territory, they might then pick a quarrel with the Congo government&mdash; or
  come to some sort of terms with them."</p>

  <p>"They've patience," I said, "if they're playing that game!"</p>

  <p>Courtney raised his eyebrows until his forehead was a mass of deep
  wrinkles. Then he blew a dozen smoke rings.</p>

  <p>"Patient&mdash;perhaps. It's my impression they're as remorseless and
  persistent as white ants&mdash;undermining, digging, devouring everywhere
  while the rest of the world sleeps. Do you remember there was a mutiny of
  native troops in Uganda not many years ago? Some said that was because the
  troops were being paid in truck instead of money, and like most current
  excuses that one had some truth in it. But the men themselves vowed they were
  going to set up an African Mohammedan empire."</p>

  <p>"What had that to do with Germans?" asked Fred.</p>

  <p>"Nothing that I can personally prove" said Courtney. "But I've a broad
  acquaintance among natives, and considerable knowledge of their tongues.
  Mohammedanism is spreading among them very rapidly. Over and over again,
  beside camp-fires, and in the dark when they thought I was not listening, I
  have heard them talk of missionaries from German territory who spread a
  doctrine of what you might call pan-Islam for lack of a better name. I said
  at the time of the Uganda mutiny that I believed Germans were behind it. I've
  seen no reason to change my opinion since. It's obvious that if the mutiny
  had by some ill chance succeeded Uganda would have been an easy prey for Karl
  Peters and his Germans. If that ivory of Tippoo Tib's is really in the Bahr
  el Gazal at the back of Uganda, then the German motive for stirring up the
  Uganda mutiny would be obvious."</p>

  <p>"But doesn't our government know all this?" demanded Fred.</p>

  <p>"That depends on what you mean by the word know," answered Courtney. "I've
  made no secret of my own opinion!"</p>

  <p>"But they wouldn't listen?"</p>

  <p>"Some did, some didn't. The Home government&mdash;which was the India
  Office in those days&mdash;took no notice whatever. One or two men out here
  believed, but I think they're dead. When the Foreign Office took the country
  over I don't suppose they overhauled old reports very carefully. I dare say
  my letters on the subject lie inches deep in dust."</p>

  <p>"England doesn't deserve to keep her colonies!" vowed Fred, caught in a
  sudden flood of indignation.</p>

  <p>Courtney laughed.</p>

  <p>"When you've seen as many of the other nations' colonies as I have you'll
  qualify that verdict! We do our best. God gave us our work to do, and the
  devil came and made us stupid! Take this country, for instance."</p>

  <p>"Yes!" agreed Fred. "Take this country! We came ashore today&mdash;left
  Monty on board ship on his way to Europe. Nobody knew a thing about us. A
  female woman, known to the police in Zanzibar and so notorious in Europe that
  she's in no hurry to go home&mdash;said, too, on every hand to be in the pay
  of the German government&mdash;chose to tell lies about us to the
  chuckle-headed puppies in charge of Mombasa. Net result&mdash;what do you
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I know," said Courtney. "I've been told this evening." His eyes changed,
  and his voice took on the almost feminine note of appeal that came strangely
  from a big game hunter. "You boys must overlook things. These boys you're
  angry with are younger than you, Fred. That collector you've contrived to
  pick a quarrel with has fought Arabs and cannibal troops&mdash;odds against
  him of fifty or a hundred to one, mind you&mdash;all across the Congo and
  back again. He fought in the Uganda mutiny. He's a man. He's a merchant,
  though, with a merchant's education. He was taken over with the rest of the
  clerks when the British government superseded the British East Africa Trading
  Company. He has never had the advantage of legal training. Went to a common
  school. No advantages of any kind. Poorly paid and overworked. There's no
  money in the country yet. Nobody to tax. Salaries&mdash;expenses and so on
  come from home, voted by Parliament. As long as that condition lasts they're
  all going to feel nervous. They know they'll get the blame for everything
  that goes wrong, and precious little credit in any case. Parliament
  advertised the country in answer to their complaints of no revenue.
  Parliament called for settlers. But they're not ready for settlers. They
  don't know how to handle them. They've no troops&mdash;nothing but a handful
  of black police. How shall they keep in order colonials armed with repeating
  rifles? They're not ready. The Uganda Railway isn't finished yet; trains get
  through to Victoria Nyanza once a week, but there's endless work to be done
  yet on the line, and Parliament grudges them every penny they spend on it.
  Yet the railway was rushed through by order of Parliament to prevent Doctor
  Karl Peters and the Germans from claiming occupation of the head-waters of
  the Nile and so dominating Upper Egypt. You boys must be considerate."</p>

  <p>"All right," said Fred. "I'll grant all that."</p>

  <p>"But what gets me" Will interrupted, "is that they should condemn us out-
  of-hand&mdash;on sight&mdash;untried&mdash;on the say-so of this Lady Saffren
  Waldon. She carries German letters of credit. She's so notoriously in league
  with Germans that you'd think even these little Napoleons 'ud know it. I'm
  American myself, thank God, but these two men are their own kith and kin. Why
  should they judge their own countrymen unheard on the say-so of a woman like
  that? That's what rattles me!"</p>

  <p>Courtney blew six smoke rings.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to forgive them, lad. Too many of the Englishmen who have
  come here were bad bats from the South, so hot-footed that they burned the
  grass. Then&mdash;don't forget that the Germans have a military government to
  the south of us&mdash;all experienced men&mdash;a great many of them
  unmitigated rascals, but nearly all of them clever&mdash;students of strategy
  and psychology and tactics&mdash;some of them brilliant men who have had to
  apply for colonial service because of debt or scandal. They're overmanned
  where we are under-manned&mdash;backed up from home where our boys are only
  blamed and neglected&mdash;well supplied with troops and ammunition, where
  our police are kept down to the danger point and now and then even without
  cartridges. The Germans have no railway yet, but they've a policy and they
  keep it secret. We have a railway, and no policy except retrenchment and
  economy. I'm convinced the German government has no scruples. We have. So you
  must sympathize with our young men, not quarrel with them."</p>

  <p>"Believe me," I said, "we didn't start out to quarrel with anybody. That
  woman lied about us. There's no excuse for believing her without giving us a
  hearing."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes there is. I spoke with her myself this evening," said Courtney.
  "She's staying at my hotel, you know. She's a match for much more experienced
  men than our young officials. They've been fighting Arabs, not flirting. She
  had the impudence to try to flatter me. I don't doubt she's telling a crowd
  of men tonight that I'm in love with her&mdash;perhaps not exactly telling
  them that, but giving them to understand it. Why don't I stroll down to the
  club and deny it? For the same reason that you don't openly denounce her!
  It's semi- or wholly-sentimental chivalry&mdash;rank stupidity, if you like
  to call it that, but it's national, I'm glad to say, and I'm as proud of it
  as any one."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't it look to you," said Fred, "that if she and the German
  government are so infernally anxious to spoil our chances&mdash;and they
  suspect what we're after, you know&mdash;doesn't it look to you as if there
  may really be something in this quest of ours?"</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," said Courtney. "There's ivory in it, tons and tons and tons
  of ivory. Somebody will find it some day."</p>

  <p>"Join us then!" said Fred. "Cancel your trip to Somaliland and come with
  us! I can speak for Monty. I know he'll welcome you into the
  partnership!"</p>

  <p>"I believe I could almost speak for Monty, too," laughed Courtney. "He and
  I were at Eton together, and we've never ceased being friends. But I can't
  come with you. No. I'm making a sort of semi-official trip. I shall hunt, of
  course, but there are observations to be made. The pan-Islamic theory is said
  to be making headway also in Somaliland."</p>

  <p>"Do you feel you have any lien on the Elgon Caves and Bahr el Gazal
  clues?" Fred asked.</p>

  <p>"No. I make you a present of those ideas. I'm sure I hope you find the
  stuff. I'm wondering, though&mdash;I'm wondering."</p>

  <p>"I'll bet you a dollar I'm thinking of the same thing," said Will.</p>

  <p>"Out with it, then."</p>

  <p>"What's to prevent the Germans from making their own dicker with the King
  of the Belgians or with the Congo government, and rifling the hoard on a
  fifty-fifty or some such basis?"</p>

  <p>"Correct," said Courtney. "I confess myself puzzled about that. But I know
  no European politics. There may be a thousand reasons. And then, you know,
  the King of the Belgians has the name of being a grasping dealer. The
  management of his private zone on the Congo is unspeakable. It's possible the
  Germans may prefer not to risk putting His Majesty on the scent."</p>

  <p>"Well, we've our work cut out," said Fred, laughing and yawning. "That
  woman has started us off with a bad name."</p>

  <p>"That is one thing I can really do for you," Courtney answered. "I've no
  official standing, but the boys all listen to me. I'll tell them&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For the love of God don't tell them too much!" Fred exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell them you're friends of mine," he went on. "I believe that will
  solve the sporting license and ammunition problem. As for the woman&mdash; if
  I were in your shoes I would steal a march on her. I wouldn't be surprised if
  your licenses and ammunition permits were here at the hotel by ten tomorrow
  morning. I see they've sent your guns already. Well, there's a train for
  Nairobi tomorrow noon, and not another for three days. I'd take tomorrow's
  train if I were you. I always find in going anywhere the start's the
  principal thing. You'll go?"</p>

  <p>"We will," we answered, one after the other.</p>

  <p>"Good night, then, boys; I'll be going."</p>

  <p>But we walked with him down to his hotel&mdash;I, and I think the others,
  full to the teeth with the pleasure of knowing him, as well as of envy of his
  scars, his five or six South African campaigns, his adventures, and (by no
  means least) his unblemished record as a gentleman. Merely a little bit of a
  man with a limp, but better than a thousand men who lacked his
  gentleness.</p>

  <p class="first">COURTNEY proved better than his word. Our Big Game Licenses
  arrived after breakfast, and permits for five hundred rounds of rifle
  ammunition each. In an envelope in addition was Fred's check with the
  collector's compliments and the request that we kindly call and pay for the
  licenses. In other words we now had absolution.</p>

  <p>We called, and were received as fellow men, such was the genius of
  Courtney's friendship. A railway man looked in. The collector's dim office
  became awake with jokes and laughter.</p>

  <p>"Going up today?" he asked. "I'll see you get berths on the train."</p>

  <p>We little realized at the moment the extent of that consideration; but
  understanding dawned fifteen minutes before high noon when we strolled to the
  station behind a string of porters carrying our luggage. Courtney was there
  to see us off, and he looked worried.</p>

  <p>"I'm wondering whether you'll ever get your luggage through," he said with
  a sort of feminine solicitude. It was strange to hear the hero of one's
  school-days, mighty hunter and fearless leader of forlorn campaigns, actually
  troubled about whether we could catch our train. But so the man was, gentle
  always and considerate of everybody but himself.</p>

  <p>There was law in this new land, at all events along the railway line. Not
  even handbags or rifles could pass by the barrier until weighed and paid for.
  Crammed in the vestibule in front of us were fifty people fretfully
  marshaling in line their strings of porters lest any later comer get by ahead
  of them; foremost, with his breast against the ticket window, was Georges
  Coutlass. Things seemed not to be proceeding as he wished.</p>

  <p>There was one babu* behind the window&mdash;a mild, unhappy-looking
  Punjabi, or Dekkani Moslem. There was another at the scales, who knew almost
  no English: his duty was to weigh&mdash;do sums&mdash;write the result on a
  slip, and then justify his arithmetic to office babu and passenger, before
  any sort of progress could be made. The fact that all passengers shouted at
  him to hurry or be reported to big superiors complicated the process
  enormously; and the equally discordant fact that no passenger&mdash;and
  especially not Georges Coutlass&mdash;desired or intended to pay one
  anna&dagger; more than he could avoid by hook, crook, or argument, made the
  game amusing to the casual looker-on, but hastened nothing (except tempers).
  The temperature within the vestibule was 112° by the official
  thermometer.</p>

  <p>"You pair of black murderers!" yelled Coutlass as we took our place in
  line. "You bloody robbers! You pickpockets! You train-thieves! Go out and dig
  your graves! I will make an end of you!"</p>

  <p>"You should not use abusive language" the babu retorted mildly, stopping
  to speak, and then again to wipe his spectacles, and his forehead, and his
  hands, and to glance at the clock, and to mutter what may or may not have
  been a prayer.</p>

  <p>Coutlass exploded.</p>

  <p>"Shouldn't, eh? Who the hell are you to tell me what I shouldn't do? Sell
  me a ticket, you black plunderer, d'you hear! Look! Listen!"</p>

  <p>He snatched a piece of paper from the babu's hand and turned to face the
  impatient crowd.</p>

  <p>"This hell-cat&mdash;" (the unhappy babu looked less like a hell-cat than
  any vision of the animal I ever imagined) "wants to make out that seventy-
  one times seven annas and three pice* is forty-nine rupees, eleven annas! Oh,
  you charlatan! You mountebank! You black-blooded robber! You miscreant! Cut
  your throat, I order you!"</p>

  British rule). Until the 1950s in India and Pakistan (and before that in
  British India), the Paisa was equivalent to 3 Pies, 1/4th of an Anna, or 1/64
  of a Rupee. After the transition from a non-decimal currency to a decimal
  currency, the Paisa was known as a Naya Paisa ("New Paisa") for a few years.

  <p>The babu expostulated, stammered, quailed. Coutlass drew in his breath for
  the gods of Greece alone knew what heights of fury next. But interruption
  entered.</p>

  <p>"There, that's enough of you! Get to the back of the line!"</p>

  <p>The man who had promised us berths came abruptly through the barrier, and
  unlike the babu did not appear afraid of any one. The Greek let out his
  gathered breath with a bark of fury, like a seal coming up to breathe. Taking
  that for a symptom of opposition the newcomer, very cool in snow-white
  uniform and helmet, seized Coutlass by the neck and hustled him, arguing like
  a boiler under pressure, through the crowd. The Greek was three inches
  taller, and six or eight inches bigger round the chest, but too astonished to
  fight back, and perhaps, too, aware of the neighborhood of old da Gama's
  fort, where more than one Greek was pining for the grape and olive fields of
  Hellas. With a final shove the railway official thrust him well out into the
  road.</p>

  <p>"If you miss the train, serve you right!" he said. "Babus are willing
  servants, to be treated gently!"</p>

  <p>Then he saw us.</p>

  <p>"You're late! Where's your luggage? These your porters? All right&mdash;
  put you on your honor. Go on through. Save time. Have your stuff weighed, and
  settle the bill at Nairobi. All of it, mind! Babu, let these people
  through!"</p>

  <p>Followed by Courtney, who seemed to have right of way wherever it suited
  him to wander, we filed through the gate, crossed the blazing hot platform,
  and boarded a compartment labeled "Reserved." The railway man nodded and left
  us, to hurry and help sell tickets.</p>

  <p>It was an Indian type railway carriage be left us in, a contraption not
  ill-suited to Africa&mdash;nor yet so comfortable as to diminish the
  sensation of travel toward new frontiers.</p>

  <p>Each car was divided into two compartments, entirely separate and entered
  from opposite ends; facing ours was the rear end of a second-class car, into
  which we could look if the doors were open and we lay feet-foremost on the
  berths. The berths were arranged lengthwise, two each side, and one above the
  other.</p>

  <p>It was what they called a mixed train, mixed that is of freight and
  passengers&mdash;third-class in front, second next, then first, and a dozen
  little iron freight cars of two kinds in front. In those days there were
  neither tunnels nor bridges on that railway, and there was a single seat on
  the roof at each end of first- and second-class compartments reached by a
  ladder, for any passenger enamored of the view. Even the third-class
  compartments (and they were otherwise as deliberately bare and comfortless as
  wood and iron could make them) had lattice-work shades over the upper half of
  the windows.</p>

  <p>For the babu's encouragement, and to increase the panic of the ticketless,
  the engineer was blowing the whistle at short intervals. Passengers, released
  in quicker order now that a white official was lending the two babus a hand,
  began coming through the barrier in sudden spurts, baggage in either hand and
  followed hot-foot by natives with their heavier stuff. They took headers into
  the train, and the porters generally came back grinning.</p>

  <p>"I see through the whistling stunt," Will announced. "My, but that fellow
  on the engine has faith; or else the system's down real fine in these parts!
  He won't be back for a week. Those wooly-headed porters are going to save up
  his commission and hand it to him when he brings the down-train in! The
  game's good: he whistles&mdash;passenger runs&mdash;can't make change
  &mdash;pays two, three, four, ten times what the job's worth&mdash;and the
  porters divvy up with the engineer. But good lord, the porters must be
  honest!"</p>

  <p>Presently a pale white man in khaki with a red beard entered our
  compartment, and Courtney had to make room for him on the seat. He apologized
  with less conviction of real regret than I ever remember noticing, although
  the pouches under his eyes gave him a rather world-weary look.</p>

  <p>"Not another first-class berth on the train&mdash;every last one engaged.
  Might be worse. Might have had to ride with Indians. Curse of this country,
  Indians are. I'd rid the land of 'em double-quick if government 'ud pay me a
  rupee a head&mdash;an' I'd provide cartridges! But government likes 'em! Ugh!
  Ever travel in one compartment with a dozen of 'em? Sleep in a tent with a
  score of 'em? Share blankets with a couple of 'em on a cold night? No? You be
  glad I'm not an Indian. One's enough!"</p>

  <p>We made room for his belongings, and leaned from the window all on one
  seat together. The time to start arrived and passed; hot passengers continued
  spurting for the train at intervals&mdash;all sorts of passengers&mdash;
  English, Mauritius&mdash;French, Arab, Goanese, German, Swahili, Indian,
  Baluchi, one Japanese, two Chinamen, half-breeds, quarter-breeds of all the
  hues from ivory to dull red, guinea-yellow, and bleached out black; but the
  second-class compartment facing our door remained empty. There was a name on
  the card in the little metal reservation frame, and every passenger who could
  read English glanced at it, but nobody came to claim it even when the
  engine's extra shrill screaming and at last the ringing of a bell warned
  Courtney that time was really up, and he got out on the platform.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye," he said through the window. "I've done what I could to bring
  you luck. Don't be tempted to engage the first servants who apply to you at
  Nairobi. If you wait there a week I'll send my Kazimoto to you; he's a very
  good gun-bearer. He'll be out of a job when I'm gone. I shall give him his
  fare to Nairobi. Engage him if you want a dependable boy, but remember the
  rule about dogs: a good one has one master! I don't mean Kazimoto is a dog
  &mdash;far from it. I mean, treat him as reasonably as you would a dog, and
  he'll serve you well. He's a first-class Nyamwezi, from German East. Oh, and
  one more scrap of advice&mdash;":</p>

  <p>He came close to the window, but at that moment the engine gave a final
  scream and really started. Passengers yelled farewells. The engine's
  apoplectic coughs divided the din into spasms, and there came a great
  bellowing from the ticket office. He could not speak softly and be heard at
  all. Louder he had to speak, and then louder, ending almost with a shout.</p>

  <p>"The best way to Elgon is by way of Kisumu and Mumias, whatever anybody
  else may tell you. And if you find the stuff, or any of it," (he was running
  beside the train now)&mdash;"be in no hurry to advertise the fact! Go and
  make terms first with government&mdash;then&mdash;after you've made terms
  &mdash;tell 'em you've found it! Find the stuff&mdash;make terms&mdash; then
  produce what you've found! Get my meaning? Good-bye, all. Good luck!"</p>

  <p>We left him behind then, wiping the sweat from his wrinkled, freckled
  forehead, gazing after us as if we had all been lifelong friends of his. He
  made no distinction between us and Fred, but was equally anxious to serve us
  all.</p>

  <p>"If that man isn't white, who is?" demanded Will, and then there was new
  interest.</p>

  <p>We had left the ticket office far behind, but the train was moving slowly
  and there was still a good length of platform before our car would be clear
  of the station altogether. We heard a roar like a bull's from behind, and a
  dozen men&mdash;white, black and yellow&mdash;came careering down the
  platform carrying guns, baggage, bedding, and all the paraphernalia that
  travelers in Africa affect.</p>

  <p>First in the van was Georges Coutlass, showing a fine turn of speed but
  tripping on a bed-sheet at every other step, with his uncased rifle in one
  hand, his hat in the other, an empty bandolier over one shoulder and a bag
  slung by a strap swinging out behind him. He made a leap for the second-class
  compartment in front of us, and landed on all fours on the platform. We
  opened the door of our compartment to watch him better.</p>

  <p>Once on the platform he threw his rifle into the compartment and braced
  himself to catch the things his stampeding followers hurled after him&mdash;
  caught them deftly and tossed them in, yelling instructions in Greek,
  Kiswahili, Arabic, English, and two or three other languages. It may be that
  the engineer looked back and saw what was happening (or perhaps the guard
  signaled with the cord that passed through eyeholes the whole length of the
  train) for though we did not slow down we gained no speed until all his
  belongings had been hurled, and caught, and flung inside. Then came his
  traveling companions&mdash;caught by one hand and dragged on their knees up
  the steps. They were heavy men, but he snatched all three in like a boy
  pulling chestnuts from the fire.</p>

  <p>The first was a Greek&mdash;evil-looking, and without the spirit that in
  the case of Coutlass made a stranger prone to over-look shortcomings&mdash;
  dressed in khaki, with rifle and empty bandolier. Next, chin, elbow, hand and
  knee up the steps came a fat, tough-looking Goanese, dressed anyhow at all in
  pink-colored dirty shirt, dark pants, and a helmet, also with rifle and empty
  bandolier. I judged he weighed about two hundred and eighty pounds, but
  Coutlass yanked him in like a fish coming overside. Last came a man who might
  be Arab, or part-Arab, part-Swahili, whom I did not recognize at first, fat,
  black, dressed in the white cotton garments and red fez of the more or less
  well-to-do native, and voluble with rare profanity.</p>

  <p>"Johnson!" shouted Fred with almost the joy of greeting an old
  acquaintance.</p>

  <p>It was Hassan, sure enough, short-winded and afraid, but more afraid of
  being left behind than of the manhandling. Coutlass took hold of his
  outstretched arm, hoisted him, cracked his shins for him against the top
  step, and hurled him rump-over-shoulders into the compartment, where the
  other Greek and the Goanese grabbed him by the arms and legs and hove him to
  an upper berth, on which he lay gasping like a fish out of water and moaning
  miserably. Their compartment was a mess of luggage, blankets, odds-and-ends,
  and angry men. Coutlass found a whisky bottle out of the confusion, and
  swallowed the stuff neat while the other Greek and the Goanese waited their
  turn greedily. There was nothing much in that compartment to make a man like
  Hassan feel at home.</p>

  <p>"Those Greeks," said our red-bearded traveling companion as we shut the
  door again, "are only one degree better than Indians&mdash;a shade less
  depraved perhaps&mdash;a sight more dangerous. I sure do hate a Punjabi, but
  I don't love Greeks! The natives call 'em bwana masikini to their faces
  &mdash;that means Mister Mean White y'know. They're a lawless lot, the Greeks
  you'll run across in these parts. My advice is, shoot first! Walk behind 'em!
  If they ain't armed, hoof 'em till they cut an' run! Greeks are no good!"</p>

  <p>We introduced ourselves. He told us his name was Brown.</p>

  <p>"There's three Browns in this country: Hell-fire Brown of Elementaita,
  Joseph Henry Brown of Gilgil, and Brown of Lumbwa. Brown of Lumbwa's me.
  Don't believe a word either of the other two Browns tell you! Yes, we're all
  settlers. Country good to settle in? Depends what you call good. If you like
  lots of room, an' hunting, natives to wait an' your own house on your own
  square mile&mdash;comfortable climate&mdash;no conventions&mdash;nor no ten
  commandments, why, it's pretty hard to beat. But if you want to wear a white
  shirt, and be moral, and get rich, it's rotten! You've a chance to make money
  if you're not over law-abiding, for there's elephants. But if you're moral,
  and obey the laws, you haven't but one chance, an' she's a slim one."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Fred, genially, "tell us about the only one. We're men to
  whom the ten commandments are&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You look it!" Brown interrupted. "Well, what's the odds? You'll never
  find it, and anyhow, everybody knows it's Tippoo Tib's ivory. I mean to have
  a crack at spotting it myself, soon as I get my farm fenced an' one or two
  other matters attended to. Gov'ment offers ten per cent. to whoever leads 'em
  to it, but they can't believe any one's as soft as that surely! They'll be
  lucky if they get ten per cent. of it themselves! Man alive, but they say
  there's a whale of a hoard of it! Hundreds o' tons of ivory, all waiting to
  be found, and fossicked out, an' took! Say&mdash;if I was some o' those
  Greeks for instance, tell you what I'd do: I'd off to Zanzibar, an' kidnap
  Tippoo Tib. The old card's still living. I'd apply a red-hot poker to his
  silver-side an' the under-parts o' his tripe-casings. He'd tell me where the
  stuff is quicker'n winking! Supposin' I was a Greek without morals or no
  compunctions or nothin', that's what I'd do! I don't hold with allowin' any
  man to play dog in the manger with all that plunder!"</p>

  <p>"Have you a notion where the stuff might be?" Fred wondered
  guilelessly.</p>

  <p>"Ah! That 'ud be tellin'!"</p>

  <p>We had crossed the water that divides Mombasa from the mainland. Behind us
  lay the prettiest and safest harbor on all that thousand-league-long coast;
  before us was the narrow territory that still paid revenue and owed nominal
  allegiance to the Sultan of Zanzibar, although really like the rest of those
  parts under British rule. We were bowling along beside plantations of
  coconut, peanut, plantain and pineapple, with here and there a thicket of
  strange trees to show what the aboriginal jungle had once looked like. When
  we stopped at wayside stations the heat increased insufferably, until we
  entered the great red desert that divides the coast-land from the hills, and
  after that all seemed death and dust, and haziness, and hell.</p>

  <p>At first we passed occasional baobabs, with trunks fifteen or twenty feet
  thick and offshoots covering a quarter of an acre. Then the trees thinned out
  to the sparse and shriveled all-but-dead things that struggle for existence
  on the border-lines between man's land and desolation. At last we drew down
  the smoked panes over the window to escape the glare and sight of the
  depressing desolation.</p>

  <p>The sun beat down on the iron roof. The heat beat up from the tracks. Red
  dust polluted the drinking water in the little upright tank. Dust filled
  eyes, nostrils, hair. Dust caked and grew stiff in the sweat that streamed
  down us. Yet we stopped once at a station, and humans lived there and a man
  got off the train. A lone lean babu and his leaner, more miserable native
  crew came out and eyed the train like vultures waiting for a beast to die.
  But we did not die, and the train passed on into illimitable dusty redness,
  leaving them to watch the hot rails ribbon out behind our grumbling
  caboose.</p>

  <p>There began to be carousing in the second-class compartment next ahead of
  us. Our own Brown of Lumbwa produced a stone crock of Irish whisky from a
  basket, imbibed copiously, offered us in turn the glistening neck, looked
  relieved at our refusal, and grew voluble.</p>

  <p>"Hear them Greeks an' that Goa. You'd think they were gentlemen o'
  breeding to hear 'em carryin' on! Truth is we've no government worth a
  moment's consid'ration, an' everybody knows it, Greeks included! You men
  lookin' for farms? Take your time! Once you get a farm, an' get your house
  built, an' stock bought, an' stuff planted&mdash;once you've got your capital
  invested so to speak, they've got you! Till then you're free! Till then
  they'll maybe treat you with consideration! Till then you leave the country
  when you like an' kiss yourselves good-bye to them an' Africa. Till then
  they've got no hold! The courts can fine you, maybe, but can they make you
  pay? It's none so easy if you're half awake! But take me: Suppose I break a
  reggylation. What happens? They know where to find me&mdash;how much I've
  got&mdash;where it is&mdash;an' if I don't pay the fine, they come an' collar
  my cattle an' sticks! D'you notice any Greeks applyin' for farms? Not no
  crowds of 'em you don't! I don't know one single Greek who has a farm in all
  East Africa! Any Goas? Not a bit of it! Any Indians? Not one! So when a few
  extry elephants get shot, I get the blame&mdash;down at Lumbwa, where there
  ain't no elephants; an' the Greeks, Goas, Arabs an' Indians get fat on the
  swag! It's easy to keep track of a white man; the natives all know him, an'
  his name, an' where he lives, an' report everything he does to the nearest
  gov'ment officer. But Greeks an' Goas an' Indians an' Arabs ain't white, so
  the natives make no mention of 'em. They do the lootin'; we settlers get the
  blame; an' the whole perishing country's going to blazes as fast as a lump of
  ice melting in hell&mdash;but not so fast as I'd like to see it go. Have some
  o' this whisky, won't you?"</p>

  <p>I was scarcely listening to him, but he seemed to get drunk just "so far
  and no further," and Fred found him worth attention. It happened that Fred,
  Will and I were all thinking of the same thing. Will put a hand to his neck
  and stroked the little scar the Arab knife had made in Zanzibar.</p>

  <p>"What sort of a country's this for women?" Fred demanded.</p>

  <p>"Which women?" Brown asked in sort of mild amazement.</p>

  <p>"White women?"</p>

  <p>"Rotten! Leastwise, there aren't any. Yes, there's three. Two officials'
  wives, an' Pioneer Jane French. Heard o' her? Walked from South Africa, Jane
  did&mdash;hoofed it along o' French, bossed his boys, drove the cattle, shot
  the meat, ran the whole shootin' match, an' runs him, too, when he's sober
  an' she's drunk. When they're both drunk everybody ducks. She's scarcely a
  woman, she's sort of three-men-rolled-into-one. Give her a horsewhip an'
  she'll manage the unruliest crowd o' savages ever you or she set eyes on!
  Countin' her as one, an' the two officials wives, an' her on this train,
  there's four!"</p>

  <p>Our eyes met. I awoke to sudden interest that startled our informant and
  made him curious in turn.</p>

  <p>"On this train?"</p>

  <p>"On this train. Didn't you see her? She was watching you chaps through the
  window slits like the Queen o' Sheba keepin' tabs on Solomon. Say, what's she
  doing in this country anyhow? I made a try to get a seat in her carriage, but
  she ordered me out like Aunt Jemima puttin' out the cat the last thing. She's
  got a maid in with her, but the maid ain't white&mdash;Jew&mdash;Syrian
  &mdash;Levantine&mdash;Dago&mdash;some such breed. She's in this compartment
  next behind."</p>

  <p>Our eyes met again. Fred laughed, and Will leaned forward to whisper to
  me: "She heard what Courtney said to us about the way to Mount Elgon!"</p>

  <p>"D'you know her name?" asked Brown.</p>

  <p>"No!" we all three lied together with one voice.</p>

  <p>"I do! I seen it on the reservation card. Lady Isobel Saffren Waldon!
  Pretty high-soundin' patronymic, what? Lady Isobel Saffren Waldon!" He
  repeated the name over and over, crescendo, with growing fervor. "What's a
  woman with a title doin' d'you suppose? The title's no fake. She's got the
  blood all right, all right! You ought to ha' heard her shoo me out! Lummy! A
  nestin' hen giving the office to a snake weren't in it to her an' me! Good
  looker, too! What's she doin' in East Africa?"</p>

  <p>We made no shift to answer.</p>

  <p>"The officials' wives," he went on, "are keen after Tippoo's ivory, but,
  bein' obliged to stay in the station except when their husbands go on safari,
  an' then only go where their husbands go, they've no show to speak of.
  Pioneer Jane's nuts on it, an' she's dangerous. Jane's as likely to find the
  stuff as any one. She's independent&mdash;go where she blooming well
  pleases&mdash;game as a lioness&mdash;looks like one, too, only a lioness is
  kind o' softer an' not so quick in the uptake. My money's on Jane for a
  place. But d'you suppose this Lady Saffren Whatshername's another one? Them
  Greeks ahead of us I'm sure of; all the Greeks in Africa are huntin' for
  nothin' else. But what about the dame?"</p>

  <p>"Going to join her husband, perhaps," suggested Fred to put him off.</p>

  <p>"There's no man o' that name in British East or Uganda. I know 'em all
  &mdash;every one."</p>

  <p>"Father&mdash;brother&mdash;uncle&mdash;nephew&mdash;oh, perhaps she's
  just traveling," said Fred.</p>

  <p>"Just traveling my eye! Titled ladies don't come 'just traveling' in these
  parts&mdash;not by a sight, they don't&mdash;not alone!"</p>

  <p>He helped himself to more whisky, but had reached the stage where it had
  no further visible effect on him.</p>

  <p>"Anyhow," he said, wiping the neck of the jar with his hand, "if she kids
  herself she'll be let go where she pleases&mdash;why, she kids herself! It
  takes Pioneer Jane to trespass where writs don't run! Jane goes where her
  husband don't dare follow. The officials don't say a word. Y'see there's no
  jail where they could stow a white woman and observe the decencies. So she
  goes over the borderline whenever she sees fit. The king's writ runs maybe
  for thirty miles north o' this railway. Once over that they can't catch you.
  But unless you're a black man, or Pioneer Jane, the natives tip the gov'ment
  off an' gov'ment rounds you up afore you get two-thirds the way. They'll take
  less than half a chance with her ladyship or I'm a Dutchman. Why! How would
  it look to have to bring her back between two native policemen? She'll not be
  allowed five miles outside Nairobi township!"</p>

  <p>He up-ended his whisky again, consumed about a pint of it, and settled
  down to sleep. We took him by the legs and arms and threw him on the upper
  berth to stew in the cabined heat under the roof.</p>

  <p>"It's good Monty's not with us," said Fred. He sat down and laughed at our
  surprise that he should state such heresy. "Monty mustn't break laws, but who
  cares if we do?"</p>

  <p>"Laws?" said Will disgustedly. "I don't care who makes, or breaks the laws
  of this land! Let's beat it! Let's join Monty in London and make plans for
  some other trip. Everybody's after this ivory. We haven't a look-in. Even if
  we knew where to look for it we'd be followed. Let's take the next train back
  from Nairobi, and the next boat for Europe!"</p>

  <p>Fred rubbed his hands delightedly, and stroked his beard into the neat
  point it refuses to keep for long at a time in very hot weather.</p>

  <p>"Let's stay in Nairobi" he said, "at least until Courtney sends that boy
  he promised us. We can put in the time asking questions, and then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What then?" grumbled Will.</p>

  <p>"There may be truth in what Brown of Lumbwa says about a dead-line."</p>

  <p>"Dead-line?"</p>

  <p>"Beyond which the king's writ doesn't run."</p>

  <p>"Betcherlife there's truth in it!" Brown mumbled from the upper berth.</p>

  <p>Will exploded silently, going through the motions of reeling off all the
  bad language he knew&mdash;not an insignificant performance.</p>

  <p>"He's really asleep now," I said, standing on the lower berth and lifting
  the man's eyelid to make sure.</p>

  <p>"Who cares?" said Will. "He's heard. We've given the game away. The woman
  heard Courtney shout about how to reach Mount Elgon. So did this sharp. Now
  he hears Fred talk about dead-lines and the king's writ and breaking laws!
  The game's up! Me for the down-train and a steamer!"</p>

  <p>We smoked in silence, rendered more depressing by the deepening gloom
  outside. With the evening it grew no cooler. What little wind there was
  followed the train, so that we traveled in stagnation. Utter darkness brought
  no respite, but the fascination of flitting shadows and the ever-new mystery
  of African night. The train drew up at last in a station in the shadow of
  great overleaning mountains, and the heat shut down on us like hairy
  coverings. We seemed to breathe through thicknesses of cloth, and the very
  trees that cast black shadow on the platform ends were stifling for lack of
  air.</p>

  <p>"One hour for diner!" called the guard, walking limply along the train.
  "Just an hour for dinner! Dinner waiting!"</p>

  <p>He was not at all a usual-looking guard. He was dressed in riding breeches
  and puttee leggings, and wore a worn-out horsey air as if in protest against
  the obligation to work in a black man's land. In countries where the
  half-breed and the black man live for and almost monopolize government
  employment few white men take kindly to braid and brass buttons. That
  fellow's contempt for his job was equaled only by the babu station master's
  scorn of him and his own for the station master. Yet both men did their jobs
  efficiently.</p>

  <p>"Only an hour for dinner, gents&mdash;train starts on time!"</p>

  <p>"Guard!" called a female voice we all three recognized&mdash;"Guard! Come
  here at once, I want you!"</p>

  <p>We left Brown of Lumbwa snoring a good imitation of the Battle of Waterloo
  on the upper berth, and filed out to the dimly-lighted platform. A space in
  the center was roofed with corrugated iron and under that the yellow
  lamplight cast a maze of moving shadows as the passengers swarmed toward the
  dining-room. The smell of greasy cooking blended with the reek of axle and
  lamp oil. At the platform's forward end shadowy figures were throwing
  cord-wood into the tender, and the thump-thump-thump of that sounded like
  impatience; everything else suggested lethargy.</p>

  <p>"Guard!" called the voice again. "Come here, guard!"</p>

  <p>He stopped in passing to close our windows and lock our compartment door
  against railway thieves.</p>

  <p>"There's a man asleep in there," I said.</p>

  <p>"The 'eat 'll sober 'im!" he grinned, slamming the last window down.
  "What'll you bet 'er 'ighness don't want me to fetch dinner to 'er? She was
  in the train in Mombasa two hours afore startin' time, an' the things she
  ordered me to do 'ud have made a 'alf-breed think 'e was demeaning of
  'imself! I 'aven't seen the color of 'er money yet. If she wants dinner she
  gets out and walks or 'er maid fetches it&mdash;you watch!"</p>

  <p>Coutlass, the other Greek and the Goanese staggered out beside us on to
  the platform, drunk enough not to know whether Hassan was with them or not.
  He came out and stood beside them in a sort of alert defensive attitude.</p>

  <p>"Guard!" called the voice again. "Where is the man?"</p>

  <p>We followed the last of the crowd through the screened doors, and took
  seats at a table marked "First Class Only!" There were four men there ahead
  of us, two government officials disinclined to talk; a missionary in a gray
  flannel shirt, suffering from fever and too suspicious to say good evening;
  and a man in charge of that section of the line, who checked the station
  master's accounts and counted money in a tray between mouthfuls. Between us
  and the second-class tables was a wooden screen on short legs, and beyond
  that arose babel. Second-class is democratic always, and talks with its mouth
  full. In addition to our privilege of paying more for exactly the same food,
  we enjoyed exclusiveness, a dirty table-cloth, and the extra smell from the
  kitchen door. (The table-cloth was dirty because the barefoot Goanese waiters
  invariably stubbed their feet against a break in the floor and spilt soup
  exactly in the same place.)</p>

  <p>We had scarcely taken our seats when Coutlass swaggered in, closely
  followed by his gang. Inside the door he turned on Hassan.</p>

  <p>"Black men eat outside!" he snarled, and shoved him out again backward.
  Then he came over to us and stood leering at the framed sign, "First Class
  Only," avoiding our eyes, but plainly at war with us.</p>

  <p>"Gassharamminy!" he growled. "You think you're popes or something! You
  three would want a special private piece of earth to spit on!" He raised his
  voice to a sort of scream. "I proclaim one class only!"</p>

  <p>At that he lifted his foot about level with his chest and kicked the
  screen over. The crash brought everybody to his feet except the two officials
  and the railway man. They continued eating, and the railway man continued
  counting copper coins as if life depended on that alone.</p>

  <p>"Sit down all!" yelled Coutlass. "You will eat with better appetite now
  that you can behold the blushes of these virgins!" Then he swaggered over to
  the long table, thrust the other Greek and the Goanese into chairs on either
  side of him, and yelled for food. It was the first time we had been referred
  to publicly as virgins, and I think we all three felt the strain.</p>

  <p>The Goanese manager&mdash;a wizened old black man with perfectly white
  hair&mdash;came running from the kitchen in a state of near-collapse, the
  sweat streaming off him and his hands trembling.</p>

  <p>"What shall I do?" he asked, almost upsetting the railway man's tray of
  money. "That man is crazy! He came in once before and broke the dishes! Twice
  he has come in here and eaten and refused to pay! What shall I do?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said the railway man. "Go on serving dinner. Serve him
  too."</p>

  <p>The manager hurried out again and the running to and fro resumed. Then in
  came the guard.</p>

  <p>"First-class for two on trays!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>The railway man beckoned to him and he winked as he passed by us.</p>

  <p>"When you've seen to that, and had your own meal, I want you," said the
  railway man.</p>

  <p>"Thought you said the lady's maid would have to come and fetch the food?"
  I said maliciously as the guard passed my chair a second time.</p>

  <p>"So I did. But if you know how to refuse her, just teach me! I told her
  flat to have the maid fetch it. She let on they're both too frightened to
  cross the platform in the dark! Never saw anything like 'em! Tears! An'
  dignified! When I climbed down they was too afraid next to be left alone.
  Swore train-thieves 'ud murder 'em! I had to leave 'em my key to lock
  'emselves in with until I come back with the grub! What d'you think of
  that?"</p>

  <p>But our soup came, and one could not think and eat that stuff
  simultaneously. The railway man looked up for a moment, saw my face, and
  explained in a moment of expansiveness that meat would not keep in that
  climate but was "perfectly good" when cooked.</p>

  <p>"Besides," he added, "you'll get nothing more until you reach Nairobi
  tomorrow noon!"</p>

  <p>That turned out to be not quite true, but as an argument it worked. We
  swallowed, like the lined-up merchant seamen taking lime-juice under the
  skipper's eye.</p>

  <p>The guard grew impatient and went into the kitchen, but had scarcely got
  through the door when a scream came from the direction of the train that
  brought him back on the run. No black woman ever screams in just that way,
  and in a land of black and worse-than-black men imagination leaps at a white
  woman's call for help.</p>

  <p>There was a stampede for the door by every one except the Greeks and
  Goanese and the railway man. (He had to guard the money.) We poured through
  the screen doors, the guard fighting to burst between us, and, because with a
  self-preserving instinct that I have never thought quite creditable to the
  human race, everybody ran toward his own compartment, it happened that we
  three and the two officials and the guard came first on the scene of
  trouble.</p>

  <p>Brown of Lumbwa was still drunk-affectionate, it seemed, by that time.</p>

  <p>"You've no call to be 'fraid of me, li'l sweetheart!" The door was open.
  Within the compartment all was dark, but every sound emerged. There came a
  stifled scream.</p>

  <p>"Li'l stoopid! What d'you come in for, if you're 'fraid o' poor ole Brown?
  I won't hurt you."</p>

  <p>The guard passed between us and went up the step. He listened, looked,
  disappeared through the open door, and there came a sound of struggling.</p>

  <p>"Whassis?" shouted Brown. "An interloper? No you don't! This is my li'l
  sweetheart! She came in to see me&mdash;didn't you, Matilda Ann?"</p>

  <p>The woman apparently broke free. The guard yelled for help. Fred and one
  of the government officials were nearest and as they entered they passed the
  woman coming out. I recognized Lady Saffren Waldon's Syrian maid, with the
  big railway key in her fist that the guard had left with her. By that time
  there was a considerable crowd about our car, unable to see much because it
  stood in the way of the station lamp-light. She slipped through&mdash;to the
  right&mdash;not toward Lady Isobel's compartment, and I lost sight of her
  behind some men. I ran after her, but she was gone among the shadows, and
  although I hunted up and down and in and out I could find her nowhere.</p>

  <p>When I returned to our car Brown of Lumbwa was out on the platform with
  his hair all tousled and a wild eye. The guard was wiping a bloody nose and
  everybody was inventing an account of what nobody had seen.</p>

  <p>"Scrag him!" advised some expert on etiquette.</p>

  <p>"What the hell right has anybody got," demanded Brown with querulous
  ferocity, "to interfere between me and a lady? Eh? Whose compartment was she
  in? Me in hers or her in mine? Eh? Me. I'm sleeping. Hasn't a gent a right to
  sleep? Next thing I know she's fingerin' my whiskers. How should I know she's
  not balmy on red beards an' makin' love to me? What right's she got in my
  compartment anyhow? Who let her in? Who asked her? What if I did frighten
  her? What then?"</p>

  <p>"Who was she?" demanded the official. "Had anybody seen her before?"</p>

  <p>"The maid attending the lady in the next compartment," said I.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"Positive."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Guard! See who is in there!"</p>

  <p>The guard wiped blood from his nose and obeyed orders. We clustered round
  the steps to hear.</p>

  <p>"'Ow many's in here?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>There was no answer. He tried the door and it opened 'readily.</p>

  <p>"'Scuse me, but is there two of you? I can't see in the dark."</p>

  <p>"Oh, is that our dinner?" said Lady Saffren Waldon's Voice.</p>

  <p>"No ma'am, not the dinner yet."</p>

  <p>"Why not, pray?"</p>

  <p>"There's folks accusin' your maid o' enterin' the next compartment an'
  &mdash;an'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! My maid is here! You kept us so long waiting for dinner we were
  both asleep! Ah! There's light at last, thank heaven!"</p>

  <p>Two native porters running along the roofs were dropping lamps into the
  holes appointed for them, and the train that had been a block of darkness
  hewn out of the night was now a monster, many-eyed.</p>

  <p>"They're both in there, so 'elp me!" the guard reported, retreating
  backward through the door and leering at us.</p>

  <p>There remained nobody, except the still indignant Brown of Lumbwa to levy
  charges, and the crowd remembered its dinner (not that anything could be
  expected to grow cold in that temperature).</p>

  <p>"The train will start on time!" announced the babu station master, and
  everybody hurried to the dining-room. Brown came with us, bewildered.</p>

  <p>"How did it happen?" he demanded. "When did we get here? Why wasn't I
  called for dinner? How did she get in? Where did she go to?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, come and eat curried cow, it's lovely!" answered Will.</p>

  <p>Fred overtook us at the door, and whispered:</p>

  <p>"Our things have been gone through, but I can't find that anything's
  missing."</p>

  <p>Within the dining-room was new ground for discontent. The British race and
  its offshoots wash, but disbelieve with almost unanimity in water as a drink.
  Every guest at either table had left at his place a partly emptied glass of
  beer, or brandy and soda, or whisky. Each looked for the glass on his return,
  and found it empty.</p>

  <p>"Those Greeks!" exclaimed the Goanese manager, with a fearful air, and
  shoulders shrugged to disclaim his own responsibility.</p>

  <p>Coutlass and the other Greek were sitting at a table with a gorged look,
  glancing neither to the right nor left, yet not eating. I looked at the
  railway official, who had not left his seat. It struck me he was laughing
  silently, but he did not look up. The crowd, after the manner of all crowds,
  stormed at the Goanese manager.</p>

  <p>"What can I do? What shall I do?" wailed the unhappy little man. "They are
  bigger than I! They were greedy! They took!"</p>

  <p>All those charges were evidently true, and stated mildly. Coutlass rose to
  his feet.</p>

  <p>"Gassharamminy!" he thundered, and his stomach stuck out over the table it
  was so full of various drinks. "Why should we not take? Who isn't thirsty in
  this hell of a place? Who leaves good drink deserves to lose it!"</p>

  <p>"What shall I do?" wailed the Goanese manager.</p>

  <p>"Take the orders for drinks again," said the railway man, glancing up from
  his figures. "Bring the account to me."</p>

  <p>The waiters ran to fill orders, and a babel of abuse at the second table
  was hurled at Coutlass and his friends; but they lid not leave the table
  because there was another course to come, and, as the manager had said, they
  were greedy. Then in came the guard, his face a blood-and-smudgy picture of
  discontent.</p>

  <p>"Say!" he yelled. "Ain't I goin' to get those two first-classes on trays?"
  He came and stood by us. "Did you ever 'ear the likes of it? They swear
  neither of 'em was out of the compartment. They call me a liar for askin' for
  my key back! They swear I never gave it to 'em, 'an they never asked for it,
  an' their door was never locked, nor nothin'!"</p>

  <p>He passed on to the railway man.</p>

  <p>"I'll have to borry your key, sir. Mine's lost. Can't open doors until I
  get one from somewhere."</p>

  <p>The railway man passed him his key with a bored expression and no
  remark.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget that I want you presently," be ordered. "Be quick and get
  your own dinner."</p>

  <p>"I'm in love with this ivory hunt!" Fred whispered to us across the table.
  "If she's sure our pockets are worth going through, I'm sure there's
  something to look for!"</p>

  <p>"Are you sure the maid went through our things?" asked Will.</p>

  <p>"Quite. I left my shooting jacket hanging on a hook. Everything was
  emptied out of the pockets on to the berth."</p>

  <p>"I think I'll make you a confession presently," said I, with a look at
  Will that just then he did not understand.</p>

  <p>"Never confess before dessert and coffee!" advised Fred. "It spoils the
  appetite."</p>

  <p class="first">THE guard procured his trays at last, delivered them at a
  run, returned in a hurry and swallowed his own meal at a side-table. Then,
  with his mouth full, he reported for orders to the railway official, who was
  still checking figures. The room was beginning to grow empty. Coutlass and
  his Greek friend and the Goanese sat almost alone at the far end of the other
  table, finishing their pudding. I had not noticed until then that the guard
  was a singularly little man. He stood very few inches taller than the seated
  official. I suppose that hitherto in some way his energy had seemed to
  increase his inches.</p>

  <p>"Are there handcuffs in the caboose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Fetch them."</p>

  <p>In spite of Brown of Lumbwa's protests, who wept at the notion of having
  to eat alone, we were in the act of settling our bills and going. But mention
  of handcuffs suggesting entertainment, we lit cigars and, imagining we stayed
  for love of him, Brown cooed at us.</p>

  <p>"I've the darbies* in my pocket, sir!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>darbies</i>&mdash;manacles; handcuffs. <i><a href=
  "http://machaut.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/WEBSTER.sh?WORD=darbies">Webster's 1913
  Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>I thought the guard looked more undersized than ever. He would have made a
  fair-sized middle-weight jockey.</p>

  <p>"Tell that Greek&mdash;Coutlass his name is&mdash;to come here."</p>

  <p>With his tongue stuck into his cheek and a wink at us the guard
  obeyed.</p>

  <p>"He says for you to go to 'ell, sir!" he reported after a moment's
  interview.</p>

  <p>"Very well. Arrest him!"</p>

  <p>"He'll need help," I interrupted. "My two friends and I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear no," said the official. "He is fully up to his work."</p>

  <p>So we moved our chairs into position for a better view.</p>

  <p>The guard advanced fox-terrierwise to within about six paces of
  Coutlass.</p>

  <p>"Up with both your 'ands, Thermopylae!" he snapped. "Your bloomin'
  reckonin's come!"</p>

  <p>Coutlass showed tobacco-stained teeth for answer, and his friends rutched*
  their chairs clear of the table, ready for action. Yet they were taken
  unawares. With a terrier's speed the guard pounced on Coutlass, seized him by
  the hair and collar, hurled him, chair and all, under a side-table, and was
  on the far side of the table kicking his prostrate victim in the ribs before
  either Greek or Goanese&mdash;likewise upset in the sudden onslaught
  &mdash;could gather themselves and interfere.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>rutch</i>&mdash;to slide; to push back (e.g. a
  chair); from German "rutschen." For other meanings, see <i><a href=
  "http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=rutch&amp;r=f">The Urban
  Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>The Goanese was first on his feet. He hurled a soda-water bottle. The
  guard ducked and the bottle smashed into splinters on the wall. Before the
  sound of smashing glass had died the Goanese was down again, laid out by
  blows on the nose and jugular. Then again the guard kicked Coutlass, driving
  him back under the table from which he was trying to emerge on all fours.</p>

  <p>The second Greek looked more dangerous. His face grew dark with rage as
  the lips receded from his yellow teeth. He reached toward his boot, but
  judged there were too many witnesses for knife work and rushed in suddenly,
  yelling something in Greek to Coutlass as he picked up a chair to brain the
  guard with. He swung the chair, but the guard met it with another one, dodged
  him, and tripped him as he passed. In another second it was his turn to be
  kicked in the ribs until he yelled for mercy. (An extra large dinner and all
  those assorted drinks in addition to what they had had in the train made
  neither man's wind good.)</p>

  <p>No mercy was forthcoming. He was kicked, more and more violently, until
  the need of crawling through the door to safety dawned on his muddled wits
  and he made his exit from the room snake fashion. By that time Coutlass was
  on his feet, and he too elected to force the issue with a chair. The guard
  sprang at the chair as Coutlass raised it, bore it down, and drove his fist
  hard home into the Greek's right eye three times running.</p>

  <p>"'Ave you 'ad enough?" he demanded, making ready for another assault. The
  Goanese had recovered and staggered to his feet to interfere, but Coutlass
  yielded.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said, "why should I fight a little man? I surrender to
  save bloodshed!"</p>

  <p>"Put your 'ands out, then!"</p>

  <p>Coutlass obeyed, and was handcuffed ignominiously.</p>

  <p>"Outside, you!"</p>

  <p>A savage kick landed in exactly the place where the Goanese least expected
  and most resented it. He flew through the door as if the train had started,
  and then another kick jolted Coutlass.</p>

  <p>"Forward, march! Left-right-left-right!"</p>

  <p>With hands manacled in front and the inexorable bantam guard behind,
  Coutlass came and stood before the railway official, who at last condescended
  not to seem engrossed in his accounts.</p>

  <p>"'Ere he is, sir!"</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know, my man, that I have magisterial powers on this
  railway?" said the official.</p>

  <p>Coutlass glowered but said nothing.</p>

  <p>"This is not the first time you have made yourself a nuisance. You broke
  dishes the last time you were here."</p>

  <p>"That is long ago," Coutlass objected. "That was on the day the place was
  first opened to the public. There was a celebration. Every one was
  drunk."</p>

  <p>"You broke plates and refused to pay the damage!"</p>

  <p>"Officials were drunk. I saw them!"</p>

  <p>"The damage amounted to seventeen rupees, eight annas."</p>

  <p>"Gassharamminy! All the crockery from Mombasa to Nairobi isn't worth that
  amount! I shall not pay!"</p>

  <p>"Now there's another bill for those drinks you and your friends stole when
  passengers' backs were turned. I saw you do it!"</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you object at the time?" sneered Coutlass.</p>

  <p>"Here is the bill: twenty-seven rupees, twelve annas. Total, forty-five
  rupees, four annas. You may make the manager a present of the odd sum for his
  injured feelings, and call it an even fifty. Settle now, or wait here for the
  down-train and go to jail in Mombasa!"</p>

  <p>"Wait in this place?" asked Coutlass, aghast.</p>

  <p>"Where else? There'll be a down passenger train in a week."</p>

  <p>"I pay!" said the Greek, with a hideous grimace.</p>

  <p>"Take the irons off him, then."</p>

  <p>The guard unlocked the handcuffs and Coutlass began to fumble for a money-
  bag.</p>

  <p>"Give me a receipt!" he demanded, thumbing out the money.</p>

  <p>"You are the receipt!" said the official. "An Englishman would have been
  sent to jail with a fine, and have paid the bill into the bargain. You're
  treated leniently because you can't be expected to understand decent
  behavior. You're expected to learn, however. Next time you will catch it
  hot!"</p>

  <p>"All aboard!" called the guard cheerfully. "All aboard!"</p>

  <p>"Tears, idle tears!" said Brown of Lumbwa, taking my arm and Fred's.</p>

  <p>"Thass too true&mdash;too true! They'd have jailed an Englishman&mdash;
  me, f'rinstance. One little spree, an' they'd put me in the Fort! One li'l
  indishcresshion an' they'd jug me for shix months! Him they let go wi' a
  admonisshion! It's 'nother case o' Barabbas, an' a great shame, but you can't
  change the English. They're ingcorridgible! Brown o' Lumbwa's my name," he
  added by way of afterthought.</p>

  <p>"Take advice and get under blankets afore you go to sleep, gents!" warned
  the guard. All windows were once more opened wide, and every one was
  panting.</p>

  <p>"A job on this 'ere line's a circus!" he grinned. "I'm lucky if there's
  only one fight before Nairobi! 'Ave your blankets ready, gents! Cover
  yourselves afore you sleep!"</p>

  <p>That sounded like a joke. The sweat poured from every one in streams. The
  hot hair cushions were intolerable. The dust gathered from the desert stirred
  and hung, and there was neither air to breathe nor coolness under all those
  overhanging mountains.</p>

  <p>"Get under your blankets, gents!" advised the guard, passing down the
  train; and then the train started.</p>

  <p>I had the upper berth opposite Brown's, where it was hottest of all
  because of the iron roof. Drunk though he was, I noticed that the first thing
  Brown did after we had hoisted him aloft was to dig among the blankets like a
  dog and make the best shift he could of crawling under them. With one blanket
  twisted about his neck and shoulders and the other tangled about his knees he
  remarked to the roof that his name was Brown of Lumbwa, and proceeded to sob
  himself to sleep. He had made the journey a dozen times, so knew what he was
  doing. I drew on my own blankets, and stifling, blowing out red dust,
  remembered a promise.</p>

  <p>"Will!" I said. "Tell Fred what happened to us in Zanzibar while he and
  Monty viewed the moon!"</p>

  <p>"We agreed not to," he answered, but it seemed to me he might arouse his
  own enthusiasm if he did tell.</p>

  <p>"Who's afraid of Fred?" said I.</p>

  <p>That settled it.</p>

  <p>"One of you shall tell before you sleep!" Fred announced, sitting up. "Who
  feareth not God nor regardeth me will blench before the prospect of a
  sleepless night! Speak, America!"</p>

  <p>He took out a cleaning rod from his gun-case, and proceeded to stir Will's
  ribs and whack his feet. In a minute there was a rough-house&mdash;panting,
  and bursts of laughter&mdash;cracks of the cleaning rod on Will's bare legs
  &mdash;the sound of hands slipping on sweaty arms&mdash;and</p>

  <p>"Murder!" yelled Brown of Lumbwa, waking up. "Murder! Oh, mur-durrr!"</p>

  <p>"Shut up, you fool!" I shouted at him. But he only yelled the louder.</p>

  <p>"I knew these tears were not for nothing!" he wailed. "It was premonition!
  Pass me the whisky! Pass it up here! Oh, look! They're at each other's
  throats! Murder! Oh, mur-durrr! Pass the whisky or I'll come down and kill
  everybody in self-defense! Murrrrr-durrr!"</p>

  <p>They stopped fooling because his idiotic screams could be heard all down
  the train.</p>

  <p>"There," said Brown, "you see, I've saved two worthless lives! Very
  foolish of me! Pass the whisky! See that I save a little for the
  morning!"</p>

  <p>At that he fell asleep again; and because Fred threatened to start new
  commotion and wake him unless Will or I confessed at once, Will took up the
  tale, I leaning over the edge of my berth to prompt him. Fred laughed all
  through the story, and finally crawled under his blanket again to lie
  chuckling at the underside of Brown of Lumbwa's berth.</p>

  <p>"I don't see what we've scored by telling him," said Will to me. "We've
  merely given him a peg to hang jokes on!"</p>

  <p>But I knew that now Will had told the story he would not, for very shame,
  withdraw from the venture until we should have demonstrated that no Lady
  Saffren Waldon, nor Sultan of Zanzibar, nor Germans, nor Arabs could make us
  afraid. And it seemed to me that was sufficient accomplishment for one
  night.</p>

  <p>The train's progress slowed and grew slower. The panting of the engine
  came back to us in savage blasts. We were climbing by curves and zigzags up
  the grim dark wall of mountains. And as we mounted inch by inch, foot by
  foot, the air freshened and grew cooler&mdash;not really cool yet by a very
  Jacob's ladder of degrees, but delectable by comparison.</p>

  <p>There was something peacefully exhilarating in the thought of rising from
  the red dead level of that awful plain, littered with the bones of camels and
  the slaves whom men pinned into the yokes to perish or survive in twos.* As
  we mounted foot by foot we fell asleep. Later, as we mounted higher, we
  shivered under blankets. There is a spirit and a spell of Africa that grip
  men even in sleep. The curt engine blasts became in my dreams the panting of
  enormous beasts that fought. A dream-continent waged war on itself, and bled.
  I saw the caravans go, thousands long, the horsed and white-robed Arab in the
  lead&mdash;the paid, fat, insolent askaris, flattering and flogging&mdash;
  slaves burdened with ivory and other, naked, new ones, two in a yoke,
  shivering under the askari's lash, the very last dogged by vultures and
  hyenas, lean as they, ill-nourished on such poor picking.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* It was the cheerful Arab rule never to release one
  slave from the yoke if the other failed on the journey, on the principle that
  then the stronger would be more likely to care for, encourage, and drive the
  weaker. Author's footnote. ]</p>

  <p>Then I saw elephants in herds five thousand strong that screamed and
  stormed and crashed, flattening out villages in rage that man should
  interfere with them&mdash;in fear of the ruthless few armed men with rifles
  in their rear. Whole herds crashed pell-mell through artfully staged
  undergrowth into thirty-foot-deep pits, where they lingered and died of
  thirst, that Arabs (who sat smoking within hail until they died) might have
  the ivory.</p>

  <p>And all I saw in my dream was nothing to the things I really was to see.
  None of the cruelty of man, none of the rage and fear of animal have vanished
  yet from Africa. Some of the cruelty is more refined; some of the herds are
  smaller; some good is making headway but Africa is unchanged on the whole. It
  is a land of nightmares, with lovely oases and rare knights errant; a land
  whose past is gloom, whose present is twilight and uncertainty, but whose
  future under the rule of humane men is immeasurable, unimaginable.</p>

  <p>In my dream din followed crash and confusion until the engine's screaming
  at last awoke me. My blanket had fallen to the floor and I was shivering from
  cold. I jumped down to recover it and realized it was dawn already. We were
  bowling along at a fine pace past green trees and undulating veldt, and I
  wondered why the engine should keep on screaming like a thing demented. I
  knelt on Fred's berth to lean from the window and look ahead. We were going
  round a slight curve and I could see the track ahead for miles.</p>

  <p>Three hundred yards away a full-grown rhinoceros stood planted on the
  track, his flank toward us and his interest fixed on anything but trains. He
  was sniffing the cool morning, looking the other way.</p>

  <p>"Wake up, you fellows!" I yelled, and Fred and Will put their heads
  through the window beside me just in time to see the rhino take notice of the
  train at last. When the engine was fifty yards from him he wheeled, took a
  short-sighted squint at it, sniffed, decided on war, and charged. The
  engineer crowded on steam.</p>

  <p>"He's a game enough sport!" chuckled Fred.</p>

  <p>"He's a fool!" grinned Will.</p>

  <p>He was both, but he never flinched. He struck the cow-catcher head-on and
  tried to lift it sky-high. The speed and weight of the engine sent him
  rolling over and over off the track, and the shock of the blow came backward
  along the train in thunderclaps as each car felt the check. The engineer
  whistled him a requiem and a cheer went up from fifty heads thrust out of
  windows. But he was not nearly done for.</p>

  <p>He got up, spun around like a polo pony to face the train, deliberately
  picked out level going, and charged again. This time he hit the car we were
  in, and screams from the compartment behind us gave notice that Lady Saffren
  Waldon's maid was awake and looking through a window too. He hit the running-
  board beside the car, crumpled it to matchwood, lifted the car an inch off
  the track, but failed to disrail us. The car fell back on the metal with a
  clang, and the rhino recoiled sidewise, to roll over and over again. This
  time the impetus sent him over the edge of a gully and we did not doubt he
  was dead at the bottom of it.</p>

  <p>The guard stopped the train and came running to see what the damage
  amounted to.</p>

  <p>"Any gent got his rifle handy?" he shouted. "The train's ahead o' time.
  There's twenty minutes for sport!"</p>

  <p>We dived for our rifles, but Coutlass had his and was on the track ahead
  of us, his eye a ghastly sight from the guard's overnight attentions, his
  face the gruesome color of the man who has eaten and drunk too much, but his
  undamaged eye ablaze, and nothing whatever the matter with his
  enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"Give me a cartridge&mdash;a cartridge, somebody!" he yelled.
  Gassharamminy! He's not dead! I saw him kick as he went over the edge legs
  upwards! Give me one cartridge and I'll finish him!"</p>

  <p>By that time every male passenger was out on the track, some in night-
  shirts, some in shirts and pants, some with next-to-nothing at all on, but
  nearly all with guns. Somebody gave Coutlass a handful of cartridges that
  fitted his Mauser rifle and he was off in the lead like a hero leading a
  forlorn hope, we after him. We searched high and low but lost all trace of
  the rhino, and at the end of half an hour the engine's whistle called us
  back. There were blood and hair all over the engine&mdash;blood and hair on
  our car, but the rhino had been as determined in defeat as in attack, and if
  he died of his wounds he contrived to do it alone and in dignity.</p>

  <p>"That leaves Coutlass with six cartridges," said I, overtaking Fred.
  "Let's hope their owner asks for them back."</p>

  <p>The owner did ask for them. He stood with his hand out by the door of the
  Greek's compartment.</p>

  <p>"You didn't use those cartridges," he said.</p>

  <p>"But I will!" sneered Coutlass. "Out of my way!"</p>

  <p>He sprang for his door and slammed it in the man's face, and the other
  Greek and the Goanese jeered through the window. I caught sight of Hassan
  beside them looking gray, as unhappy black men usually do. Will saw him
  too.</p>

  <p>"The cannibal's ours," he said, "supposing we want him and play our cards
  kind o' careful."</p>

  <p>The next thing to delay the train was an elephant, who walked the track
  ahead of us and when the engine whistled only put on speed. Hypnotized by the
  tracks that reached in parallel lines to the horizon, with trunk
  outstretched, ears up, and silly tail held horizontally he set himself the
  impossible task of leaving us behind. The more we cheered, the more the
  engine screamed, the fiercer and less dignified became his efforts; he
  reached a speed at times of fourteen or fifteen miles an hour, and it was not
  until, after many miles, he reached a culvert he dared not cross that he
  switched off at right angles. Realizing then at last that the train could not
  follow him to one side he stood and watched us pass, red-eyed, blown and
  angry. He had only one tusk, but that a big one, and the weight of it caused
  him to hold his head at a drunken-looking angle.</p>

  <p>"Stop the train!" yelled Coutlass, brandishing his rifle as he climbed to
  the seat on the roof. But the guard, likewise on the roof at his end of the
  train, gave no signal and we speeded on. We were already in the world's
  greatest game reserve, where no man might shoot elephant or any other living
  thing.</p>

  <p>We began to pass herds of zebra, gnu, and lesser antelope&mdash;more than
  a thousand zebra in one herd&mdash;ostriches in ones and twos&mdash; giraffes
  in scared half-dozens&mdash;rhinoceros&mdash;and here and there lone lions.
  Scarcely an animal troubled to look up at us, and only the giraffes ran.</p>

  <p>Watching them, counting them, distinguishing the various breeds we three
  grew enormously contented, even Will Yerkes banishing depression. Obviously
  we were in a land of good hunting, for the strictly policed reserve had its
  limits beyond which undoubtedly the game would roam. The climate seemed
  perfect. There was a steady wind, not too cold or hot, and the rains were
  recent enough to make all the world look green and bounteous.</p>

  <p>To right and left of us&mdash;to north and south that is&mdash;was wild
  mountain country, lonely and savage enough to arouse that unaccountable
  desire to go and see that lurks in the breast of younger sons and all
  true-blue adventurers. We got out a map and were presently tracing on it with
  fingers that trembled from excitement routes marked with tiny vague dots
  leading toward lands marked "unexplored." There were vast plateaus on which
  not more than two or three white men had trodden, and mountain ranges almost
  utterly unknown&mdash;some of them within sight of the line we traveled on.
  If the map was anything to go by we could reach Mount Elgon from Nairobi by
  any of three wild roads. Fred and I underscored the names of several places
  with a fountain pen.</p>

  <p>"And say!" said Will. "Look out of the window! If we once got away into
  country like that, who could follow us!"</p>

  <p>"But you can't get away!" said a. weary voice from the upper berth. "I'm
  Brown of Lumbwa. That's my name, gents, and I know, because I tried! Thought
  I was sound asleep, didn't you! Well, I weren't! Listen to me, what happens.
  You start off. They get wind of it. They send the police helter-skelter
  hot-foot after you&mdash;native police&mdash;no officer&mdash;Masai they are,
  an' I tell you those Masai can make their sixty miles a day when they're
  minded an' no bones about it either! Maybe the Masai catches you and maybe
  not. S'posing they do they can't do much. They've merely a letter with 'em
  commanding you to return at once and report at the gov'ment office. And o'
  course&mdash;bein' ignorant, same as me, an' hot-headed, an' eager &mdash;you
  treat that contumelious an' tip the Masai the office to go to hell. Which
  they do forthwith. They're so used to bein' told to go to hell by wishful
  wanderers that they scarcely trouble to wait for the words. Presently they
  draw a long breath an' go away again like smoke being blowed downwind. An'
  you proceed onward, dreamin' dreams o' gold an' frankincense an'
  freedom."</p>

  <p>"Well, what next?" said I, for he made a long pause, either for
  reminiscence or because of headache.</p>

  <p>"Whisky next!" he answered. "I left a little for the morning, didn't I? I
  almost always do. Hold the bottle up to the light&mdash;no, no, you'll spill
  it!&mdash;pass it here! Ah-h-h&mdash;gug-gug!"</p>

  <p>He finished what was left and tried to hurl the empty bottle through the
  window, but missed and smashed it against the woodwork.</p>

  <p>"'Sapity!" he murmured. "Means bad luck, that does! Poor ole Brown o'
  Lumbwa&mdash;poor ole fella'. Pick up the pieces, boys! Pick 'em up quick
  &mdash;might get some o' poor ole Brown's bad luck&mdash;cut yourselves or
  what not. Pick 'em up careful now!"</p>

  <p>We did, and it took ten minutes, for the splinters were scattered
  everywhere.</p>

  <p>"Next time you do a thing like that you shall get out an' walk!" announced
  Fred.</p>

  <p>"That 'ud be only my usual luck!" he answered mournfully. "But I was
  tellin' how you notify the Masai police to go to hell, an' they oblige. It's
  the last obligin' anybody does for you. Every native's a bush telegraph
  &mdash;every sleepy-seemin' one of 'em! They know tracks in an' out through
  the scrub that ain't on maps, an' they get past you day or night wi'out you
  knowin' it, an' word goes on ahead o' you&mdash;procedes you as the sayin'
  is. You come to a village. You need milk, food, Porters maybe, an' certainly
  inf'mation about the trail ahead. You ask. Nobody answers. They let on not to
  sling your kind o' lingo. Milk&mdash;never heard o' such stuff&mdash;cows in
  them parts don't give milk! Food? They're starving. It isn't overeating makes
  their bellies big, it's wind. Porters? All the young men are lame, an' old
  'uns too old, an' the middle 'uns too middle-aged&mdash;an' who ever heard of
  a native woman workin' anyhow. Who tills the mtama* patch, then? It don't get
  tilled, or else the women only 'tend to it at tillin' time. Nobody works at
  anythin' about the time you come on the scene, for work ain't moral, pleasin'
  nor profitable, an' there you are! As for the trail ahead, lions an'
  cannibals are the two mildest kind of calamities they guarantee you'll
  meet."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>mtama</i> (Swahili)&mdash;a kind of millet.

  <p>"You don't have to believe them," I argued. "No man in his senses would
  start without porters of his own&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who never run away, an' never, oh never go lame o' course!" said
  Brown.</p>

  <p>"Porters enough and to spare," I continued. "And food for a month or
  two&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How are you going to get away right under their noses with food for a
  month or two?" demanded Brown. "You've got to live off the country after a
  certain distance. The further you go, the worse for you, for they'll sell you
  nothing and give you less. By and by your porters get tipped off by the
  natives of some village you spend a night at. You look for 'em next mornin'
  and where are they? Gone! There are their loads, an' no one to carry 'em!
  You've got to leave your loads an' return, an' the police you told so
  stric'ly to go to hell meet you with broad grins and lead you to the gov'ment
  office. There the collector, or, what's worse, the 'sistant collector, gives
  you a lecture on infamy an' the law of doin' as you'd be done by. You ask for
  your loads back, an' he laughs at you. An' that's all about it, excep' that
  next time you happen to want a favor done you by gov'ment you get a lecture
  instead! No, you can't get away, an' it's no use tryin'! If you was Greeks
  maybe, or Arabs, yes. Bein' English, the Indian Penal Code, which is white
  man's law in these parts, 'll get you sure!"</p>

  <p>Brown of Lumbwa sighed at recollection of his wrongs, turned over, and
  went to sleep again. The train bowled along over high veldt, cutting in half
  magnificent distances and stopping now and then at stations whose excuse for
  existence was unimaginable. We stopped at a station at last where the Hindu
  clerk sold tea and biscuits. The train disgorged its passengers and there was
  a scramble in the tiny ticket office like the rush to get through turnstiles
  at a football game at home, only that the crowd was more polyglot and less
  good-natured.</p>

  <p>Coutlass, his Greek friend and the Goanese being old travelers on that
  route were out of the train first, first into the room, and first supplied
  with breakfast. Fred and I were nearly last. Brown of Lumbwa refused to leave
  his berth but lay moaning of his wrongs, and the iniquity of drink not based
  on whisky. I missed Will in the scramble, and although it was nearly half an
  hour before I got served I did not catch sight of him in all that time.</p>

  <p>I counted eleven nations taking tea in that tiny room and there were
  members of yet other tribes strolling the platform, holding themselves aloof
  with the strange pride of the pariah the wide world over.</p>

  <p>When Will came in he was grinning, and his ears seemed to stick out more
  than usual, as they do when he is pleased with himself.</p>

  <p>"Didn't I say fat Johnson was ours if we'd play our cards right?" he
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"You mean Hassan?"</p>

  <p>"He'd had no breakfast. He'd had no supper. He had no money. The Greeks
  took away what little money he did have on the pretext that he might buy a
  return ticket and desert them. They seem to think that a day or two's
  starvation might make him good and amenable. I found him trying to beg a bite
  from a full-blooded Arab, and say! they're a loving lot. The Arab spat in his
  eye! I offered to buy him eats but he didn't dare come in here for fear the
  Greeks 'ud thrash him, so I slipped him ten rupees for himself and he's the
  gratefulest fat black man you ever set eyes on. You bet it takes food and
  lots of it to keep that belly of his in shape. There's a back door to this
  joint. He slipped round behind and bribed the babu to feed him on the rear
  step, me standing guard at the corner to keep Greeks at bay. He's back in the
  car now, playing possum."</p>

  <p>"Let's trade him for Brown of Lumbwa," suggested Fred genially. "Call him
  into our car and kick Brown out!"</p>

  <p>"Trade nothing! I tell you the man is ours! Call him, and he'll bargain.
  Let him be, and the next time the Greeks ill-treat him he'll come straight to
  us in hope we'll show him kindness."</p>

  <p>"Swallow your tea quickly, Solomon!" Fred advised him. "There goes the
  whistle!"</p>

  <p>It was fresh tea, just that minute made for him. Will gulped down the
  scalding stuff and had to be thumped on the back according to Fred. With eyes
  filled with water he did not see what I did, and Fred was too busy guarding
  against counter-blows. The most public place and the very last minute always
  suited those two best for playing horse.</p>

  <p>"Thought you said Johnson was asleep," said I.</p>

  <p>"Possuming," coughed Will. "Shamming sleep to fool the Greeks."</p>

  <p>"Possuming, no doubt," I answered, "but the Greeks are on. He has just
  come scurrying out of Lady Saffren Waldon's compartment. The Greeks watched
  him and made no comment!"</p>

  <p>We piled into our own appointed place and sat for a while in silence.</p>

  <p>"All right said Will at last, lighting his pipe. "I own I felt like
  quitting once. I'll see it through now if there's no ivory and nothing but
  trouble! That dame can't thimblerig me!"</p>

  <p>"We're supposed to know where the ivory is," grinned Fred. "Keep it up!
  They'll hunt us so carefully that they'll save us the trouble of watching
  them!"</p>

  <p>"I'm beginning to think we do know where the ivory is," said I. "I believe
  it's on Mount Elgon and they mean to prevent our getting it."</p>

  <p>"If that turns out true, we'll have to give them the slip, that's all,"
  said Fred, and got out his concertina just as Monty always played chess when
  his brain was busy, Fred likes to think to the strains of his infernal
  instrument. One could not guess what he was thinking about, but the wide
  world knew he was perplexed, and Lady Saffren Waldon in the next compartment
  must have suffered.</p>

  <p>After a while he commenced picking out the tunes of comic songs, and
  before long chanced on one that somebody in the front part of the train
  recognized and began to sing. In ten minutes after that he was playing
  accompaniments for a full train chorus and the seared zebra and impala bolted
  to right and left, pursued by Tarara-boom-de-ay, Ting-a-ling-a-ling, and
  other non-Homeric dirges that in those days were dying an all-too-lingering
  death.</p>

  <p>It was to the tune of After the Ball that the engine dipped head-foremost
  into a dry watercourse, and brought the train to a jaw-jarring halt. The tune
  went on, and the song grew louder, for nobody was killed and the English-
  speaking races have a code, containing rules of conduct much more stringent
  than the Law of the Medes and Persians. Somebody&mdash;probably natives from
  a long way off, who needed fuel to cook a meal&mdash;had chopped out the
  hard-wood plate on which the beams of a temporary culvert rested. Time, white
  ants, gravity and luck had done the rest. It was a case thereafter of walk or
  wait.</p>

  <p>"Didn't I tell you?" moaned Brown of Lumbwa. "Didn't I say walkin' 'ud be
  only just my luck?"</p>

  <p>So we walked, and reached Nairobi a long way ahead of Coutlass and his
  gang, whose shoes, among other matters, pinched them; and we were comfortably
  quartered in the one hotel several hours before the arrival of Lady Saffren
  Waldon and those folk who elected to wait for the breakdown gang and the
  relief train.</p>

  <p>It was a tired hotel, conducted by a tired once-missionary person, just as
  Nairobi itself was a tired-looking township of small parallel roofs of
  unpainted corrugated iron, with one main street more than a mile long and
  perhaps a dozen side-streets varying in length from fifty feet to half a
  mile.</p>

  <p>He must have been a very tired surveyor who pitched on that site and
  marked it as railway headquarters on his map. He could have gone on and found
  within five miles two or three sightlier, healthier spots. But doubtless the
  day's march had been a long one, and perhaps he had fever, and was cross. At
  any rate, there stood Nairobi, with its "tin-town" for the railway
  underlings, its "tin" sheds for the repair shops, its big "tin" station
  buildings, and its string of pleasant-looking bungalows on the only high
  ground, where the government nabobs lived.</p>

  <p>The hotel was in the middle of the main street, a square frame building
  with a veranda in front and its laundry hanging out behind. Nairobi being a
  young place, with all Africa in which to spread, town plots were large, and
  as a matter of fact the sensation in our corner room was of being in a
  wilderness&mdash;until we considered the board partition. Having marched
  fastest we obtained the best room and the only bath, but next-door neighbors
  could hear our conversation as easily as if there had been no division at
  all. However, as it happened, neither Coutlass and his gang nor Lady Saffren
  Waldon and her maid were put next to us on either side. To our right were
  three Poles, to our left a Jew and a German, and we carried on a whispered
  conversation without much risk.</p>

  <p>She and her maid arrived last, as it was growing dusk. We had already seen
  what there was to see of the town. We had been to the post-office on the
  white man's habitual hunt, for mail that we knew was non-existent. And I had
  had the first adventure.</p>

  <p>I walked away from The post-office alone, trying to puzzle out by myself
  the meaning of Lady Saffren Waldon's pursuit of us, and of her friendship
  with the Germans, and her probable connection with Georges Coutlass and his
  riff-raff. I had not gone far either on my stroll or with the problem
  &mdash;perhaps two hundred yards down a grassy track that they had told me
  led toward a settlement&mdash;when something, not a sound, not a smell, and
  certainly not sight, for I was staring at the ground, caused me to look up.
  My foot was raised for a forward step, but what I saw then made me set it
  down again.</p>

  <p>To my right front, less than ten yards away, was a hillock about twice my
  own height. To my left front, about twelve yards away was another, slightly
  higher; and the track passed between them. On the right-hand hillock stood a
  male lion, full maned, his forelegs well apart and the dark tuft on the end
  of his tail appearing every instant to one side or the other as be switched
  it cat-fashion. He was staring down at me with a sort of scandalized
  interest; and there was nothing whatever for me to do but stare at him. I had
  no weapon. One spring and a jump and I was his meat. To run was cowardice as
  well as foolishness, the one because the other. And without pretending to be
  able to read a lion's thoughts I dare risk the assertion that he was puzzled
  what to do with me. I could very plainly see his claws coming in and out of
  their sheaths, and what with that, and the switching tail, and the sense of
  impotence I could not take my eyes off him. So I did not look at the other
  hillock at first.</p>

  <p>But a sound like that a cat makes calling to her kittens, only greatly
  magnified, made me glance to the left in a hurry. I think that up to that
  moment I had not had time to be afraid, but now the goose-flesh broke out all
  over me, and the sensation up and down my spine was of melting
  helplessness.</p>

  <p>On the left-hand hillock a lioness stood looking down with much intenser
  and more curious interest. She looked from me to her mate, and from her mate
  to me again with indecision that was no more reassuring than her low
  questioning growl.</p>

  <p>I do not know why they did not spring on me. Surely no two lions ever
  contemplated easier quarry. No victim in the arena ever watched the weapons
  of death more helplessly. I suppose my hour had not come. Perhaps the lions,
  well used to white men who attacked on sight with long-range weapons, doubted
  the wisdom of experiments on something new.</p>

  <p>The lioness growled again. Her mate purred to her with an uprising
  reassuring note that satisfied her and sent my heart into my boots. Then he
  turned, sprang down behind the hillock, and she followed. The next I saw of
  them they were running away like dogs, jumping low bushes and heading for
  jungle on the near horizon faster than I had imagined lions could travel.</p>

  <p>That ended my desire for further exercise and solitude. I made for the
  hotel as fast as fear of seeming afraid would let me, and spent fifteen
  aggravating minutes on the veranda trying to persuade Fred Oakes that I had
  truly seen lions.</p>

  <p>"Hyenas!" he said with the air of an old hunter, to which he was quite
  entitled, but that soothed me all the less for that.</p>

  <p>"More likely jackals," said Will; and he was just as much as Fred entitled
  to an opinion.</p>

  <p>While I was asserting the facts with increasing anger, and they were
  amusing themselves with a hundred-and-one ridiculous reasons for disbelieving
  me, Lady Saffren Waldon came. She had, as usual, attracted to herself able
  assistance; a settler's ox-cart brought her belongings, and she and her maid
  rode in hammocks borne by porters impressed from heaven knew where. It was
  not far from the station, but she was the type of human that can not be
  satisfied with meek beginnings. That type is not by any means always female,
  but the women, are the most determined on their course, and come the biggest
  croppers on occasion.</p>

  <p>She was determined now, mistress of the situation and of her plans. She
  left to her maid the business of quarreling about accommodations; (there was
  little left to choose from, and all was bare and bad); dismissed the
  obsequious settler and his porters with perfunctory thanks that left him no
  excuse for lingering, and came along the veranda straight toward us with the
  smile of old acquaintance, and such an air of being perfectly at ease that
  surprise was disarmed, and the rudeness we all three intended died
  stillborn.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of the country?" she asked. "Men like it as a rule.
  Women detest it, and who can blame them? No, comfort&mdash;no manners
  &mdash;no companionship&mdash;no meals fit to eat&mdash;no amusement! Have
  you killed anything or anybody yet? That always amuses a man!"</p>

  <p>We rose to make room for her and I brought her a chair. There was nothing
  else one could do. There is almost no twilight in that part of East Africa;
  until dark there is scarcely a hint that the day is waning. She sat with us
  for twenty or thirty minutes making small talk, her maid watching us from a
  window above, until the sun went down with almost the suddenness of gas
  turned off, and in a moment we could scarcely see one another's faces.</p>

  <p>Then came the proprietor to the door, with his best ex-missionary air of
  knowledge of all earth's ways, their reason and their trend.</p>

  <p>"All in!" he called. "All inside at once! No guest is allowed after dark
  on the veranda! All inside! Supper presently!"</p>

  <p>"Pah!" remarked Lady Saffren Waldon, rising. "What is it about some men
  that makes one's blood boil? I suppose we must go in."</p>

  <p>She came nearer until she stood between the three of us, so close that I
  could see her diamond-hard eyes and hear the suppressed breathing that I
  suspected betrayed excitement.</p>

  <p>"I must speak with you three men! Listen! I know this place. The rooms are
  unspeakable&mdash;not a bedroom that isn't a megaphone, magnifying every
  whisper! There is only one suitable place&mdash;the main dining-room. The
  proprietor leaves the oil-lamp burning in there all night. People go to bed
  early; they prefer to drink in their bedrooms because it costs less than
  treating a crowd! I shall provide a light supper, and my maid shall lay the
  table after everybody else is gone up-stairs. Then come down and talk with
  me. Its important! Be sure and come!"</p>

  <p>She did not wait for an answer but led the way into the hotel. There was
  no hall. The door led straight into the dining-room, and the noisy crowd
  within, dragging chairs and choosing places at the two long tables, made
  further word with her impossible, even if she had not hurried up-stairs to
  her room. "What do you make of it&mdash;of her? Isn't she the limit?"</p>

  <p>The words were scarcely out of Will's mouth when a roar that made the
  dishes rattle broke and echoed and rumbled in the street outside. The instant
  it died down another followed it&mdash;then three or four&mdash;then a dozen
  all at once. There came the pattering of heavy feet, like the sound of cattle
  coming homeward. Yet no cattle&mdash;no buffaloes ever roared that way.</p>

  <p>"Now you know why I ordered you all inside," grinned the ex-missionary
  owner of the place. I divined on the instant that this was his habit, to
  stand by the door before supper and say just those words to the last
  arrivals. I had a vision of him standing by his mission door aforetime,
  repeating one jest, or more likely one stale euphuism night after night.</p>

  <p>"Lions?" I asked, hating to take the bait, yet curious beyond power to
  resist.</p>

  <p>"Certainly they're lions! Did you think you were dreaming? Are you glad
  you came in when I called you? Would you rather go out again now? Make a
  noise like a herd of cattle, don't they! That's because they're bold. They
  don't care who hears them! The day is ours. It used to be theirs, but the
  white man has come and broken up their empire. The night is still theirs.
  They're reveling in it! They're boasting of it! Every single night they come
  swaggering through like this just after sunset. They'll come again just
  before dawn, roaring the same way. You'll hear them. They'll wake you all
  right. No trouble in this hotel about getting guests down-stairs for early
  breakfast!"</p>

  <p>"I'll get my rifle and settle the hash of one or two of them before I eat
  supper!" announced Will, turning away to make good his words. But the
  proprietor seized him by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Don't be foolish! It has been tried too often! I never allowed such
  foolishness at my place. A party up-street fired from the windows. Couldn't
  see very well in the dark, but wounded two or three lions. What happened, eh?
  Why the whole pack of lions laid siege to the house! They broke into the
  stable and killed three horses, a donkey, and all the cows and sheep. There
  weren't any shutters on the house windows&mdash;nothing but glass. It wasn't
  long before a young lion broke a window, and in no time there were three
  full-grown ones into the house after him. They injured one man so severely
  that he died next day. They only shot two of the lions that got inside. The
  other two got safely away, and since that time people here have known enough
  not to interfere with them except by daylight! They'll do no harm to speak of
  unless you fire and enrage them. They'll kill the stray dogs, or any other
  animal they find loose; and heaven help the man they meet! But the place to
  be after six P.M. in Nairobi is indoors. And it's the place to stay until
  after sunrise! Hear them roar! Aren't they magnificent? Listen!"</p>

  <p>The noise that twenty or thirty lions can make, deliberately bent on
  making it and roaring all at once, is unbelievable. They throw their heads up
  and glory in strength of lungs until thunders take second place and the
  listener knows why not the bravest, not the most dangerous of beasts has man
  aged to impose the fable of his grandeur on men's imagination.</p>

  <p>We were summoned to the table by the din of Georges Coutlass rising to new
  heights of gallantry.</p>

  <p>"Gassharamminy!" he shouted, thumping with a scarred fist. With a poultice
  on his eye he looked like a swashbuckler home from the wars; and as he had
  not troubled to shave himself, the effect was heightened. "What sort of
  company sits when a titled lady enters!" He seized a big spoon and rapped on
  the board with it. "Blood of an onion! Rise, every one!"</p>

  <p>Everybody rose, although there were men in the room in no mind to be told
  their duty by a Greek. Lady Saffren Waldon walked to a place near the head of
  the table with a chilling bow. As usual when night and the yellow lamplight
  modified merciless outlines, she looked lovely enough. But she lacked the
  royal gift of seeming at home with the vulgar herd. She could make men notice
  her&mdash;serve her, up to a certain point&mdash;and feel that she was the
  center of interest wherever she might choose to be; but because she was
  everlastingly on guard, she lacked the power to put mixed company at
  ease.</p>

  <p>Only the ex-missionary at the head of the table seemed to consider himself
  socially qualified to entertain her. She was at no pains to conceal contempt
  for him.</p>

  <p>"You honor my poor hotel!" he assured her.</p>

  <p>"It is certainly a very poor hotel," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Do you expect to remain long, may I ask?"</p>

  <p>"What right have you to ask me questions? Tell that native to go away from
  behind my chair. My own maid will wait on me!"</p>

  <p>Whether purposely or not, she cast such a chill upon the company that even
  Georges Coutlass subsided within himself, and, though he ate like a ravening
  animal, did not talk. Almost the only conversation was between the owner and
  the native servants, who waited at table abominably and were noisily
  reprimanded, and argued back. Each reprimand increased their inefficiency and
  insolence. Natives detest a fussy, noisy white man.</p>

  <p>Bad food, indifferent cooking, and no conversation worthy of the name
  produced gloom that drove every one from table as soon as possible. Even the
  proprietor, with insatiable curiosity exuding from him, but no spirit for
  forcing issues, departed to a sanctum of his own up somewhere under the roof.
  The boys cleared the tables. The smell of food spread itself and settled
  slowly. A half-breed butler served countless orders of drinks on trays, and
  sent them upstairs to bedrooms. Presently we three sat alone in the long bare
  room.</p>

  <p>"Shall we wait for her?" I asked. "Haven't we had enough of her?"</p>

  <p>Fred laughed. "She can scarcely cut the throats of all three of us!"</p>

  <p>"I said we'd never hear the last of it!" said Will, with a scowl at
  me.</p>

  <p>"Shall we wait for her?" I repeated.</p>

  <p>My own vote would have been in favor of going upstairs and leaving her to
  her own devices. I could see that Fred was afire with curiosity, but guessed
  that Will would agree with me. However, the point was settled for us by the
  arrival of her maid, who smiled with unusual condescension and produced from
  a basket an assortment of drinks, nuts, cigarettes and sandwiches. She spread
  them on the table and went away again.</p>

  <p>We sat and smoked for an hour after that, imagining every moment that Lady
  Saffren Waldon would be coming. Whenever we yawned in chorus and rose to go
  upstairs, a footstep seemed to herald her arrival. To have passed her on the
  stairs would have been too awkward to be amusing.</p>

  <p>At last we really made up our minds to go to bed; and then she really
  came, appearing at the bend in the stairs just as I set my foot on the lower
  step, so we trooped back to our chairs by the window. She was dressed in a
  lacy silk negligee, and took pains this time to appear gracious.</p>

  <p>"I waited until I felt sure we should not be disturbed," she said,
  smiling. "Won't you come and sit down?"</p>

  <p>We brought our chairs to the table, she sitting at one end and we together
  at one side, Fred nearest her and I farthest away. She made a sign toward the
  wine and sandwiches, and offered us cigarettes of a sort I had never seen.
  Without feeling exactly like flies in a spider's web, we were nervous as
  schoolboys.</p>

  <p>"What do you want with us?" asked Will at last.</p>

  <p>She laughed and took a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Don't let us talk too loud. You three men are after the Tippoo Tib ivory.
  So is the Sultan of Zanzibar. So is the German government. So am I"</p>

  <p>She gave the statement time to do its own work, and smoked a while in
  silence. The strength of her position, and our weakness, lay in there being
  three of us. Any one of us might let drop an ill-considered word that would
  commit the others. I think we all felt that, for we sat and said nothing.</p>

  <p>"You answer her, Fred," I said at last, and Will nodded agreement.</p>

  <p>So Fred got up and sat on the other side of the table, where we could see
  his face and he ours.</p>

  <p>"You haven't answered Mr. Yerkes' question," he said. "What do you want
  with us, Lady Saffren Waldon?"</p>

  <p>"I want an understanding with you. I will be plain to begin with. We all
  know you know where the ivory is. Lord Montdidier is not the man to connect
  himself with any wild goose chase. We don't pretend to know how you came by
  the secret or why he has gone to London, but we are sure you know it,
  perfectly sure, and for five or six reasons. We are willing to buy the secret
  from you at your own price."</p>

  <p>"Who are 'we'?" asked Fred pointedly, helping himself to nuts.</p>

  <p>"The German government, the Sultan of Zanzibar, and myself."</p>

  <p>Fred smiled. "Between you you probably could pay," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you a few hard facts," she said, "now that the ice is broken.
  You will never be allowed to make full use of your own secret. You have
  arrived at an inopportune moment, for you and for us. Our plans have been on
  foot a long time. Our search has been systematic, and it is a mathematical
  certainty we shall find what we look for in time. We do not propose to let
  new arrivals on the scene spoil all our plans and disappoint us just because
  they happen to have information. If you go ahead you will be watched like
  mice whom cats are after. If you find the ivory, you will be killed before
  you can make the discovery known!"</p>

  <p>"We seem up against it, don't we!" smiled Fred.</p>

  <p>"You are! But you can save us trouble, if you will. Name your price. Tell
  me your secret. Go your way. If your story proves true you shall be paid by
  draft on London."</p>

  <p>"Are you overlooking the idea," asked Fred, "that we might tell the secret
  to the British government, and be contented with our ten per cent.
  commission?"</p>

  <p>"I am not. You are expressly warned against any such foolishness. In the
  first place, you will be killed, at once if you dare. In the second place,
  how do you know the British government would pay you ten per cent.?"</p>

  <p>"I've had dealings with the English!" laughed Fred.</p>

  <p>"Bah! Do you think this is Whitehall? Do you think the officials here are
  proof against temptation? When I tell you that in Whitehall itself I can
  bribe two officials out of three, perhaps you'll understand me when I say
  that all these people have their price! And the price is low! Tell them where
  the ivory is&mdash;lead them to it&mdash;and they'll swear they found it
  themselves, so as to keep the commission themselves! And as for you&mdash;
  you three"&mdash;she sneered with the most sardonic, thin-lipped smile I ever
  saw&mdash;"there are lions out here, and buffalo, snakes, fevers, native
  uprisings&mdash;more ways of being rid of you than by choking you to death
  with butter!"</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose" asked Fred, "that Lord Montdidier has no influence in
  London, that he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know he had influence. I should have told you first, perhaps. Lord
  Montdidier was murdered on board ship. A telegram reached Mombasa yesterday
  at ten A.M. from up-coast saying that the body of an unknown, Englishman had
  been picked up at sea by an Arab dhow, with the face too badly eaten by fish
  to be recognizable. You may take it from me, that is Lord Montdidier's
  corpse."</p>

  <p>The calm announcement was intended to surprise us, and it did, but the
  result surprised her.</p>

  <p>"You she-devil!" said Will. "If you and your gang have murdered that fine
  fellow I'll turn the tables on you! You go up-stairs, and pray he isn't dead!
  Pray that corpse may prove to be some one's else! If he's dead I'll guarantee
  you it's the worst day's work you ever had a hand in! Go up-stairs!"</p>

  <p>He flung away the cigarette she had given him and knocked his chair
  away.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, you young fool!" she said. "Don't make all that noise!"</p>

  <p>But Will had none of the respect for titles acquired by marriage that made
  most men an easy mark for her.</p>

  <p>"Leave the room!" he ordered. "Go away from us! Just you hope that's a lie
  about Monty, that's all!"</p>

  <p>"Sit down!" she repeated. "I admit I am a little previous. The story is
  unconfirmed yet. Sit down and be sensible! Something of the sort will happen
  to all of you unless you three men get religion!"</p>

  <p>But Will began to pace the floor noisily, stopping to glare at her each
  time he turned.</p>

  <p>"Is there any sense in protracting the scene?" asked Fred.</p>

  <p>"No," she admitted. "I see you are too hot-headed to be reasoned with. But
  it makes little difference! Fever&mdash;animals&mdash;climate&mdash;sun
  &mdash;flood&mdash;accident&mdash;natives&mdash;there are excuses in
  plenty&mdash;explanations by the dozen! I will say good night, then&mdash;
  and good-bye!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, good-bye!" growled Will, facing her with his back to the stairs.
  "You take us for men with a price, do you?"</p>

  <p>"All men have a price," she smiled bitterly. "Only it is no use offering
  flowers to pigs! We must treat pigs another way&mdash;pigs, and young fools!
  And fools old enough to know better!" she added with a nod toward Fred, who
  bowed to her in mock abasement&mdash;too politely, I thought.</p>

  <p>Will got out of her way and she went up-stairs with the manner of an
  empress taking leave of subjects. Fred swept her food and wine from the table
  and stowed it in a corner, and we sat down at the table again.</p>

  <p>"The whole thing's getting ridiculous." he said.</p>

  <p>"Why don't we hunt up some official in the morning," I proposed, "and
  simply expose her?"</p>

  <p>"No use," said Will. "She never followed us up here and tried that game
  without being sure of her pull. Besides&mdash;what kind of a tale could we
  tell without letting on we're after the ivory? I vote we see the game through
  to a finish."</p>

  <p>"Good!" said Fred. "I agree!"</p>

  <p>"The only clue we've got," said I, "is Courtney's advice about Mount
  Elgon."</p>

  <p>"And what Coutlass said in Zanzibar about German East," added Will.</p>

  <p>"Tell you what," said Fred, rapping the table excitedly. "Instead of
  falling foul of this government by slipping over the dead-line, why not run
  down to German East&mdash;pretend to search for the stuff down there
  &mdash;and go from German East direct to Mount Elgon, giving 'em all the
  slip. Who's got the map?"</p>

  <p>"It's up-stairs," I said. "I'll fetch it."</p>

  <p>There was nothing like silence in the rooms above. Men were smoking and
  drinking in one another's rooms. Some doors were open to make conversation
  easier across the landing, and nobody was asleep. But I was surprised to see
  Georges Coutlass leaning against the door-post of the room he shared with the
  other Greek and the Goanese, obviously on guard, but against whom and on
  whose behalf it was difficult to guess.</p>

  <p>"Are you off to bed?" he asked, piercing me with his unbandaged eye. "Why
  don't the others go, too?"</p>

  <p>It dawned on me what he was after.</p>

  <p>"Take the wine if you want it," I said. "None of us will prevent you."</p>

  <p>He went down-stairs in his stocking feet, leaving his own door wide. I
  glanced in. The other Greek and the Goanese were asleep. Hassan lay on the
  floor on a mat between their cots. He looked up at me. I did not dare speak,
  but I smiled at him as friendly as I knew how and made a gesture I hoped he
  would interpret as an invitation to come and attach himself to our party.
  Then I hurried on, for Coutlass was coming back with a bottle of wine in each
  hand.</p>

  <p>I was five minutes in our bedroom. In a minute I knew what had happened.
  We had left the door locked, but the lock was a common one; probably the keys
  of other doors fitted it, and there was not one thing in the room placed
  exactly where we had left it. Everything was more or less in place, but
  nothing quite.</p>

  <p>I returned empty-handed down-stairs, locking the bedroom door behind
  me.</p>

  <p>"Listen, you chaps!" I said. "While we waited for that woman she and her
  maid went through our things again!"</p>

  <p>"How d'you know it was she?" asked Fred.</p>

  <p>"No mistaking the scent she uses. Where's our money?"</p>

  <p>"Here in my pocket."</p>

  <p>"Good. The map's gone, though!"</p>

  <p>Will showed big teeth in the first really happy smile for several
  days.</p>

  <p>"Good enough!" he said. "Let's go to bed now. I'll bet you my share of the
  ivory they're poring over the map with a magnifying-glass! D'you remember the
  various places we underscored? They'll think it's a cryptogram and fret ever
  it all night! Come on&mdash;come to bed!"</p>

  With stable-room for two of each and fodder for the trip,<br>

  A million hoofs once drummed the dust (Kongoni* led the way!)<br>
  From river-pool to desert-lick we thundered in array<br>
  Until the dark-skin people came with tube and smoke and shot,<br>
  Hunting and driving and killing, and leaving the meat to rot.<br>
  And we didn't know who the hunters were, but we saw the herds grow thin<br>
  That used to drum the dust-clouds up with thousand-footed din.<br>

  We were few when the paleface people came&mdash;scattered and few and

  <p class="first">THE lions awoke us a little before dawn as the proprietor
  had promised. They seemed to have had bad hunting, for their boastfulness was
  gone. They came in twos and threes, snarling, only roaring
  intermittently&mdash;in a hurry because the hated daylight would presently
  reverse conditions and put them at disadvantage.</p>

  <p>I grew restless and got up. The air being chilly, I put my clothes on and
  sat for a while by the window. So it happened I caught sight of Hassan, very
  much afraid of lions, but obviously more afraid of being seen from the hotel
  windows. He was sneaking along as close to the house as he could squeeze, his
  head just visible above the veranda rail.</p>

  <p>For no better reason than that I was curious and unoccupied, I slipped out
  of the house and followed him.</p>

  <p>Once clear of the hotel he seemed to imagine himself safe, for without
  another glance backward he ran up-street in the direction of the bazaar. I
  followed him down the bazaar&mdash;a short street of corrugated iron
  buildings&mdash;and out the other end. Being fat, he could not run fast,
  although his wind held out surprisingly. If he saw me at all he must have
  mistaken me for a settler or one of the Nairobi officials, for he seemed
  perfectly sure of himself and took no pains whatever now to throw pursuers
  off the track.</p>

  <p>It soon became evident that he was making for an imposing group of tents
  on the outskirts of the town. As he drew nearer he approached more
  slowly.</p>

  <p>It now became my turn to take precautions. There was no chance of
  concealment where I was&mdash;nothing but open level ground between me and
  the tents. But now that I knew Hassan's destination, I could afford to let
  him out of sight for a minute; so I turned my back on him, walked to where a
  sort of fold in the ground enabled me to get down unseen into a shallow
  nullah,* and went along that at right angles to Hassan's course until I
  reached the edge of some open jungle, about half a mile from the tents. I
  noticed that it came to an end at a spot about three hundred yards to the
  rear of the tents, so I worked my way along its outer edge, and so approached
  the encampment from behind.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>nullah</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a ravine or gully,
  especially in southern Asia. <i><a href=
  "http://www.bartleby.com/61/1/N0190100.html">The American Heritage
  Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>I had brought a rifle with me, not that I expected to shoot anything, but
  because the lion incident of the previous afternoon had taught me caution. It
  had not entered my head that in that country a strange white man without a
  rifle might have been regarded as a member of the mean white class; nor that
  anybody would question my right to carry a rifle, for that matter.</p>

  <p>The camp was awake now. There were ten tents, all facing one way. Two of
  them contained stores. The central round tent with an awning in front was
  obviously a white man's. One tent housed a mule, and the rest were for native
  servants and porters. The camp was tidy and clean&mdash;obviously belonging
  to some one of importance. Fires were alight. Breakfast was being cooked, and
  smelled most uncommonly appetizing in that chill morning air. Boys were
  already cleaning boots, and a saddle, and other things. There was an air of
  discipline and trained activity, and from the central tent came the sound of
  voices.</p>

  <p>I don't know why, but I certainly did not expect to hear English. So the
  sound of English spoken with a foreign accent brought me to a standstill. I
  listened to a few words, and made no further bones about eavesdropping.
  Circumstances favored me. The boys had seen I was carrying a rifle and was
  therefore a white man of importance, so they did not question my right to
  approach. The tent with the mule in it and the two store tents were on the
  right, pitched in a triangle. I passed between them up to the very pegs of
  the central tent from which the voices came, and discovered I was invisible,
  unless some one should happen to come around a corner. I decided to take my
  chance of that.</p>

  <p>The first thing that puzzled me was why a German (for it was a perfectly
  unmistakable German accent) should need to talk English to a native who was
  certainly familiar with both Arabic and Kiswahili. When I heard the German
  addressed as bwana Schillingschen I wondered still more, for from all
  accounts that individual could speak more native tongues than most people
  knew existed. It did not occur to me at the time that if he wished not to be
  understood by his own crowd of boys he must either speak German or English,
  and that Hassan would almost certainly know no German.</p>

  <p>"A good thing you came to me!" I heard. The accent was clumsy for a man so
  well versed in tongues. "Yes, I will give you money at the right time. Tell
  me no lies now! There will be letters coming from people you never saw, and I
  shall know whether or not you lie to me! You say there are three of the
  fools?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, bwana. There were four, but one going home&mdash;big lord gentleman,
  him having black m'stache, gone home."</p>

  <p>There was no mistaking Hassan's voice. No doubt he could speak his mother
  tongue softly enough, but in common with a host of other people he seemed to
  imagine that to make himself understood in English he must shout.</p>

  <p>"Why did he go home?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, bwana."</p>

  <p>"Did they quarrel?"</p>

  <p>"Sijui."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>sijui</i> (Swahili)&mdash;I don't know: the most

  <p>"Don't you dare say 'sijui' to me!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe they quarrel, maybe not. They all quarreling with Lady Saffunwardo
  &mdash;staying in same hotel, Tippoo Tib one time his house&mdash;she wanting
  maybe go with him to London. He saying no. Others saying no. All very angry
  each with other an' throwing bwana masikini, Greek man, down hotel
  stairs."</p>

  <p>"What had he to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"Two Greek man an' one Goa all after ivory, too. She&mdash;Lady
  Saffunwardo afterwards promising pay them three if they come along an' do
  what she tell 'em. They agreeing quick! By-um-by Tippoo Tib hearing bazaar
  talk an' sending me along too. She refuse to take me, all because German
  consul man knowing me formerly and not making good report, but Greek bwana he
  not caring and say to me to come along. Greek people very bad! No food
  &mdash;no money&mdash;nothing but swear an' kick an' call bad names
  &mdash;an' drunk nearly all the time!"</p>

  <p>"What makes you think these three men know where the ivory is?" said the
  German voice. It was the voice of a man very used to questioning natives
  &mdash;self-assertive but calm&mdash;going straight each time to the
  point.</p>

  <p>"They having map. Map having marks on it."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"She&mdash;Lady Saffunwardo go in their bedroom, stealing it last
  night."</p>

  <p>"Did you see her take it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, bwana."</p>

  <p>"Did you see the marks on it?"</p>

  <p>"No, bwana."</p>

  <p>"Then how do you know the marks were on it? Now, remember, don't lie to
  me!"</p>

  <p>"Coutlass, him Greek man, standing on stairs keeping watch. Them three men
  you call fools all sitting in dining-room waiting because they thinking she
  come presently. She send maid to their room. Maid, fool woman, upset
  everything, finding nothing. 'No,' she say, 'no map&mdash;no money&mdash; no
  anything in here.' An' Lady Saffunwardo she very angry an' say, 'Come out o'
  there! Let me look!' And Lady Saffunwardo going in, but maid not coming out,
  an' they both search. Then Lady Saffunwardo saying all at once, 'Here it is.
  Didn't you see this?' An' the maid answering, 'Oh, that! That nothing but
  just ordinary pocket map! That not it!' But Lady Saffunwardo she opening the
  map, an' make little scream, an' say, 'Idiot! This is it! Look! See! See the
  marks!' So, bwana, I then knowing must be marks on map!"</p>

  <p>"Good. What did she do with it?"</p>

  <p>"Sijui."</p>

  <p>"I told you not to dare say 'sijui' to me!"</p>

  <p>"How should I know, bwana,, what she doing with it?"</p>

  <p>"Could you steal it?"</p>

  <p>"No, bwana!"</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"You not knowing that woman! No man daring steal from her! She very
  terrible!"</p>

  <p>"If I offered you a hundred rupees could you steal it?"</p>

  <p>"Sijui, bwana."</p>

  <p>"I told you not to use that word!"</p>

  <p>"bwana, I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Could you steal it?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe."</p>

  <p>"That is no answer!"</p>

  <p>"Say that again about hundred rupees!"</p>

  <p>"I will give you a hundred rupees if you bring me that map and it proves
  to be what you say."</p>

  <p>"I go. I see. I try. Hundred rupees very little money!"</p>

  <p>"It's all you'll get, you black rascal! And you know what you'll get if
  you fail! You know me, don't you? You understand my way? Steal that map and
  bring it here, and I shall give you a hundred rupees. Fail, and you shall
  have a hundred lashes, and what Ahmed and Abdullah and Seydi got in addition!
  The hundred lashes first, and the ant-hill afterward! You're not fool enough
  to think you can escape me, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"No. bwana."</p>

  <p>"Then go and get the map!"</p>

  <p>"But afterward, what then? She very gali* woman."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>gali, kali</i> (Swahili, same as Hindustani
  <i>kali</i>)&mdash;cruel, hard, fierce, terrible. <i><a href=

  <p>"Nonsense! Steal the map and bring it here to me. Then I've other work for
  you. Are you a renegade Mohammedan?"</p>

  <p>"No, bwana! No, no! Never! I'm good Moslem."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Back to your old business with you! Preach Islam up and down
  the country. Go and tell all the tribes in British territory that the Germans
  are coming soon to establish an empire of Islam in Africa! Good pay and easy
  living! Does that suit you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, bwana. How much pay?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you when you bring the map. Now be going!"</p>

  <p>Hassan went, after a deal of polite salaaming. Then boys began bringing
  the German's breakfast, and unless I chose to confess myself an eavesdropper
  it became my business to be in the tent ahead of them. So I strode forward as
  if just arrived and purposely tripped over a tent-rope, stumbling under the
  awning with a laugh and an apology.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" demanded the German without rising. He had the splay shovel
  beard described to us in Zanzibar&mdash;big dark man, sitting in the doorway
  of a tent all hung with guns, skins and antlers. He was in night-shirt and
  trousers&mdash;bare feet&mdash;but with a helmet on the back of his head.</p>

  <p>"A visitor," I answered, "staying at the hotel&mdash;out for a morning
  shot at something&mdash;had no luck&mdash;got nothing&mdash;saw your tents in
  the distance, and came out of curiosity to find out who you are."</p>

  <p>"My name is Professor Schillingschen," he answered, still without getting
  up. There was no other chair near the awning, so I had to remain standing. I
  told him my name, hoping that Hassan had either not done so already, or else
  that he might have so bungled the pronunciation as to make it unrecognizable.
  I detected no sign of recognition on Schillingschen's face.</p>

  <p>The boys reached the tent with his breakfast, and one of them dragged a
  chair from inside the tent for me. I sat down on it without waiting for the
  professor to invite me.</p>

  <p>"I'm tired," I said, untruthfully, minded to refuse an invitation to eat,
  but interested to see whether he would invite me or not.</p>

  <p>"Have you any friends at the hotel?" he asked, looking up at me darkly
  under the bushiest eyebrows I ever saw.</p>

  <p>"I've got friends wherever I go," I answered. "I make friends."</p>

  <p>"Are you going far?" he demanded, holding out a foot for his boy to pull a
  stocking on.</p>

  <p>"That depends," I said.</p>

  <p>"On what?"</p>

  <p>"On whether I get employment."</p>

  <p>I said that at random, without pausing to think what impression I might
  create. He pulled the night-shirt off over his head, throwing the helmet to
  the ground, and sat like a great hairy gorilla for the boy to hang
  day-clothes on him. He had the hairiest breast and arms I ever saw, hung with
  lumpy muscles that heightened his resemblance to an ape.</p>

  <p>"I might give you work," he said presently, beginning to eat before the
  boy had finished dressing him.</p>

  <p>"I want to travel" I said. "If I could find a job that would take me up
  and down the length and breadth of this land, that would suit me finely."</p>

  <p>"That is the kind of a man I want," he said, eying me keenly. "I have a
  German, but I need an Englishman. Do you speak native languages?"</p>

  <p>"Scarcely a word."</p>

  <p>To my surprise he nodded approval at that answer.</p>

  <p>"I have parties of natives traveling all over the country gathering folk
  lore, and ethnographical particulars, but they get into a village and sit
  down for whole weeks at a time, drawing pay for doing nothing. I need an
  Englishman to go with them and keep them moving."</p>

  <p>"All well and good," I said, "but I understand the government is not in
  favor of white men traveling about at random."</p>

  <p>"But I am known to the government," he answered. "I have been accorded
  facilities because of my professional standing. Have you references you can
  give me?"</p>

  <p>"No," I said. "No references."</p>

  <p>I thought that would stump him, but on the contrary he looked rather
  pleased.</p>

  <p>"That is good. References are too frequently evidence of back-stairs
  influence."</p>

  <p>All this while he kept eying me between mouthfuls. Whenever I seemed to
  look away his eyes fairly burned holes in me. Whenever food got in his beard
  (which was frequently) be used the napkin more as a shield behind which to
  take stock of me than as a means of getting clean again. By the time his
  breakfast was finished his beard was a beastly mess, but he probably had my
  features from every angle fixed indelibly in his memory. The sensation was
  that I had been analyzed and card indexed.</p>

  <p>"I pay good wages," he remarked, and then stuck his face, beard and all,
  into the basin of warm water his boy had brought. "Where did you get that
  rifle?" he demanded, spluttering, and combing the beard out with his
  fingers.</p>

  <p>It was on the tip of my tongue to say "At Zanzibar," but, as that might
  have started him on a string of questions as to how I came to that place and
  whom I knew there, I temporized.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I bought it from a man."</p>

  <p>"That is no answer!" he retorted.</p>

  <p>If I had been possessed of much inclination to play deep games and match
  wits with big rascals I suppose I would have answered him civilly and there
  and then learned more of his purpose. But I was not prepossessed by his
  charms or respectful of his claim to superiority. The German type
  super-education never did impress me as compatible with good breeding or good
  sense, and it annoyed me to have to lie to him.</p>

  <p>"It's all the answer you'll get!" I said.</p>

  <p>"Where is your license for it?" he growled.</p>

  <p>The game began to amuse me.</p>

  <p>"None of your business!" I answered.</p>

  <p>"How long have you been in the country!"</p>

  <p>"Since I came," I said.</p>

  <p>"And you have no license! You have been out shooting. A lucky thing you
  came to my camp and not to some other man's! The game laws are very
  strict!"</p>

  <p>He spoke then to a boy who was standing behind me, giving him very careful
  directions in a language of which I did not know one word. The boy went
  away.</p>

  <p>"The last man who went shooting near Nairobi without a license," he said,
  "tried to excuse himself before the magistrate by claiming ignorance of the
  law. He was fined a thousand rupees and sentenced to six months in jail!"</p>

  <p>"Very severe!" I said.</p>

  <p>"They are altogether too severe," he answered. "I hope you have killed
  nothing. It is good you came first to me. You would better stand that rifle
  over here in the corner of my tent. To walk back to the hotel with it over
  your shoulder would be dangerous."</p>

  <p>"I've taken bigger chances than that," said I.</p>

  <p>"If you have shot nothing, then it is not so serious," he said,
  disappearing behind a curtain into the recesses of his tent.</p>

  <p>He stayed in there for about ten minutes. I had about made up my mind to
  walk away when four of his boys approached the tent from behind, and one of
  them cried "Hodi!" The boy to whom he had given directions across my shoulder
  was not among them.</p>

  <p>They threw the buck down near my feet, and he came out from the gloomy
  interior and stared at it. He asked them questions rapidly in the native
  tongue, and they answered, pointing at me.</p>

  <p>"They say you shot it," he told me, stroking his great beard alternately
  with either hand.</p>

  <p>"Then they lie!" I answered.</p>

  <p>"Let me see that rifle!" he said, reaching out an enormous freckled fist
  to take it.</p>

  <p>I saw through his game at last. It would have been the easiest thing in
  the world to extract a cartridge from the clip in the magazine and claim
  afterward that I had fired it away. Evidently he proposed to get me in his
  power, though for just what reason he was so determined to make use of me
  rather than any one else was not so clear.</p>

  <p>"So I shot the buck, did I?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Those four natives say they saw you shoot it."</p>

  <p>"Then it's mine?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"It's heavy," I said, "but I expect I can carry it."</p>

  <p>I took the buck by the hind legs and swung myself under it. It weighed
  more than a hundred pounds, but the African climate had not had time enough
  to sap my strength or destroy sheer pleasure in muscular effort.</p>

  <p>"What's mine's my own I" I laughed. "You gave me something to eat after
  all! Good day, and good riddance!"</p>

  <p>The boys tried to prevent my carrying the buck away.</p>

  <p>"Come back!" growled the professor. "I will take responsibility for that
  buck and save you from punishment. Bring it back! Lay it down!"</p>

  <p>But I continued to walk away, so he ordered his boys to take the carcass
  from me. I laid it down and threatened them with my butt end. He brought his
  own rifle out and threatened me with that. I laughed at him, bade him shoot
  if he dared, offered him three shots for a penny, and ended by shouldering
  the buck again and walking off.</p>

  <p>Meat was cheap in Nairobi in those days, so the owner of the hotel was not
  so delighted as I expected. He reprimanded me for being late for breakfast,
  and told me I was lucky to get any. Fred and Will had waited for me, and
  while we ate alone and I told them the story of my morning's adventure a
  police officer in khaki uniform tied up his mule outside and clattered
  in.</p>

  <p>"Whose buck is that hanging outside the kitchen?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"There's some doubt about it," I said. "I've been accused of being the
  owner."</p>

  <p>"Then you're the man I want. The court sits at nine. You'd better be
  there, or you'll be fetched!"</p>

  <p>He placed in my hand what proved to be a summons to appear before the
  district court that morning on the charge of carrying an unregistered rifle
  and shooting game without a license. Two native policemen he had with him
  took down the buck from the hook outside the kitchen door and carried it off
  as evidence.</p>

  <p>We finished our breakfast in great contentment, and strode off arm-in-arm
  to find the court-house, feeling as if we were going to a play&mdash; perhaps
  a mite indignant, as if the subject of the play were one we did not quite
  approve, but perfectly certain of a good time.</p>

  <p>The court was crowded. The bearded professor, his four boys, and two other
  natives were there, as well as several English officials, all apparently on
  very good terms indeed with Schillingschen.</p>

  <p>As we entered the court under the eyes of a hostile crowd I heard one
  official say to the man standing next him:</p>

  <p>"I hope he'll make an example of this case. If he doesn't every new
  arrival in this country will try to take the law in his own hands. I hope he
  fines him the limit!"</p>

  <p>"Give me your hunting-knife, Fred!" said I, and Fred laughed as he passed
  it to me. For the moment I think he thought I meant to plunge it into the too
  talkative official's breast.</p>

  <p>First they called a few township cases. A drunken Mohammedan was fined
  five rupees, and a Hindu was ordered to remove his garbage heap before noon.
  Three natives were ordered to the chain-gang for a week for fighting, and a
  Masai charged with stealing cattle was remanded. Then my case was called,
  very solemnly, by a magistrate scarcely any older than myself.</p>

  <p>The police officer acted as prosecutor. He stated that "acting on
  information received" he had proceeded to the hotel. Outside of which he saw
  a buck hanging (buck produced in evidence); that he had entered the hotel,
  found me at breakfast, and that I had not denied having shot the buck. He
  called his two colored askaris to prove that, and they reeled off what they
  had to say with the speed of men who had been thoroughly rehearsed. Then he
  put the German on the stand, and Schillingschen, with a savage glare at me,
  turned on his verbal artillery. He certainly did his worst.</p>

  <p>"This morning," be announced, after having been duly sworn on the Book,
  "that young man whose name I do not know approached my tent while I was
  dressing. The sound of a rifle being fired had awakened me earlier than
  usual. He carried a rifle, and I put two and two together and concluded he
  had shot something. Not having seen him ever before, and he standing before
  my tent, I asked him his name. He refused to tell me, and that made me
  suspicious. Then came my four boys carrying a buck, which they assured me
  they had seen him shoot. I asked him whether he had a license to shoot game,
  and he at once threatened to shoot me if I did not mind my own business.
  Therefore, I sent a note to the police at once."</p>

  <p>His four boys were then put on the stand in turn, and told their story
  through an interpreter. Their words identical. If the interpreter spoke truth
  one account did not vary from the next in the slightest degree, and that fact
  alone should have aroused the suspicion of any unprejudiced judge.</p>

  <p>Having the right to cross-examine, I asked each in turn whether the rifle
  I had brought with me to court was the same they had seen me using. They
  asserted it was. Then I recalled the German and asked him the same question.
  He also replied in the affirmative. I asked him how he knew. He said he
  recognized the mark on the butt where the varnish had been chafed away. Then
  I handed the hunting knife I had borrowed from to the police officer and
  demanded that he have the bullet cut out of the buck's carcass. The court
  could not object to that, so under the eyes of at least fifty witnesses a
  flattened Mauser bullet was produced. I called attention to the fact that my
  rifle was a Lee-Enfield that could not possibly have fired a Mauser bullet.
  The court was young and very dignified&mdash;examined the bullet and my
  rifle&mdash;and had to be convinced.</p>

  <p>"Very well," was the verdict on that count, "it is proved that you did not
  shoot this particular buck, unless the police have evidence that you used a
  different rifle."</p>

  <p>The policeman confessed that he had no evidence along that line, so the
  first charge was dismissed.</p>

  <p>"But you are charged," said the magistrate, "with carrying an unregistered
  rifle, and shooting without a license."</p>

  <p>For answer I produced my certificate of registration and the big game
  license we had paid for in Mombasa.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you say so before?" demanded the magistrate.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't asked," said I.</p>

  <p>"Case dismissed!" snapped his honor, and the court began to empty.</p>

  <p>"Don't let it stop there!" urged Will excitedly. "That Heinie and his boys
  have all committed perjury; charge them with it!"</p>

  <p>I turned to the police officer.</p>

  <p>"I charge all those witnesses with perjury!" I said.</p>

  <p>"Oh," he laughed, "you can't charge natives with that. If the law against
  perjury was strictly enforced the jails wouldn't hold a fiftieth of them!
  They don't understand."</p>

  <p>"But that blackguard with a beard&mdash;that rascal Schillingschen
  understands!" said I. "Arrest him! Charge him with it!"</p>

  <p>"That's for the court to do," he answered. "I've no authority."</p>

  <p>The magistrate had gone.</p>

  <p>"Who is the senior official in this town?" I demanded.</p>

  <p>"There he goes," he answered. "That man in the white suit with the round
  white topee is the collector."</p>

  <p>So we three followed the collector to his office, arriving about two
  minutes after the man himself. The Goanese clerk had been in the court, and
  recognized me. He had not stayed to hear the end.</p>

  <p>"Fines should be paid in the court, not here!" he intimated rudely.</p>

  <p>We wasted no time with him but walked on through, and the collector
  greeted us without obvious cordiality. He did not ask us to sit down.</p>

  <p>"My friend here has come to tell you about that man Schillingschen," said
  Fred.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you mean Professor Schillingschen!"</p>

  <p>The collector was a clean-shaven man with a blue jowl that suffered from
  blunt razors, and a temper rendered raw by native cooking. But he had photos
  of feminine relations and a little house in a dreary Midland street on his
  desk, and was no doubt loyal to the light he saw. I wished we had Monty with
  us. One glimpse of the owner of a title that stands written in the Doomsday
  Book would have outshone the halo of Schillingschen's culture.</p>

  <p>I rattled off what I had to say, telling the story from th moment I
  started to follow Hassan from the hotel down to the end, omitting
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"Schillingschen is worse than a spy. He's a black-hearted, schemer. He's
  planning to upset British rule in this Protectorate and make it easy for the
  Germans to usurp!"</p>

  <p>"This is nonsense!" the collector interrupted. "Professor Schillingschen
  is the honored friend of the British government. He came to us here with the
  most influential backing&mdash;letter of introduction from very exalted
  personages, I assure you! Professor Schillingschen is one of the most, if not
  the most, learned ethnologists in the world to-day. How dare you traduce
  him!"</p>

  <p>"But you heard him tell lies in court!" I gasped. "You were there. You
  heard his evidence absolutely disproved. How do you explain that away?"</p>

  <p>"I don't attempt to! The explanation is for you to make!" he answered.
  "The fact that he did not succeed in proving his case against you is nothing
  in itself! Many a case in court is lost from lack of proper evidence! And one
  more matter! Lady Isobel Saffren Waldon is staying&mdash;or rather, I should
  say, was staying at the hotel. She is now staying at my house. She complains
  to me of very rude treatment at the hands of you three men&mdash; insolent
  treatment I should call it! I can assure you that the way to get on in this
  Protectorate is not to behave like cads toward ladies of title! I understand
  that her maid is afraid to be caught alone by any one of you, and that Lady
  Saffren Waldon herself feels scarcely any safer!"</p>

  <p>Fred and I saw the humor of the thing, and that enabled us to save Will
  from disaster. There never was a man more respectful of women than Will. He
  would even get off the sidewalk for a black woman, and would neither tell nor
  laugh at the sort of stories that pass current about women in some smoking-
  rooms. His hair bristled. His ears stuck out on either side of his head. He
  leaned forward&mdash;laid one strong brown hand on the desk&mdash;and shook
  his left fist under the collector's nose.</p>

  <p>"You poor boob!" he exploded. Then he calmed himself. "I'm sorry for your
  government if you're the brightest jewel it has for this job! That Jane will
  use everything you've got except the squeal! Great suffering Jemima! Your
  title is collector, is it? Do you collect bugs by any chance? You act like
  it! So help you two men and a boy, a bughouse is where I believe you belong!
  Come along, fellows, he'll bite us if we stay!"</p>

  <p>"Be advised" said the collector, leaning back in his chair and sneering.
  "Behave yourselves! This is no country for taking chances with the law!"</p>

  <p>"Remember Courtney's advice," said Fred when we got outside. "Suppose we
  give him a few days to learn the facts about Lady Isobel, and then go back
  and try him again?"</p>

  <p>"Say!" answered Will, stopping and turning to face us. "What d'you take me
  for? I like my meals. I like three squares a day, and tobacco, and now and
  then a drink. But if this was the Sahara, and that man had the only eats and
  drinks, I'd starve."</p>

  <p>"Telling him the truth wouldn't be accepting favors from him," counseled
  Fred.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't tell him the time!"</p>

  <p>That attitude&mdash;and Will insisted that all the officials in the land
  would prove alike&mdash;limited our choice, for unless we were to allay
  official suspicion it would be hopeless to get away northward. Southward into
  German East seemed the only way to go; there was apparently no law against
  travel in that direction. On our way to the hotel we passed Coutlass,
  striding along smirking to himself, headed toward the office from which we
  had just come.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet you," said Will, "he's off to get an ammunition permit, and
  permission to go where he damned well pleases! I'll bet he gets both! This
  government's the limit!"</p>

  <p>We laughed, but Will proved more than half right. Coutlass did get
  ammunition. Lady Saffren Waldon's influence was already strong enough for
  that. He did not ask for leave to go anywhere for the simple reason that his
  movements depended wholly on ours&mdash;a fact that developed later.</p>

  <p>At the hotel there was a pleasant surprise for us. A squarely built, snub-
  nosed native, not very dark skinned but very ugly&mdash;his right ear slit,
  and almost all of his left ear missing&mdash;without any of the brass or iron
  wire ornaments that most of the natives of the land affect, but possessed of
  a Harris tweed shooting jacket and, of all unexpected things, boots that he
  carried slung by the laces from his neck-waited for us, squatting with a note
  addressed to Fred tied in a cleft stick.</p>

  <p>It does not pay to wax enthusiastic over natives, even when one suspects
  they bring good news. We took the letter from him, told him to wait, and went
  on in. Once out of the man's hearing Fred tore the letter open and read it
  aloud to us.</p>

  <p>"Herewith my Kazimoto," it ran. "Be good to him. It occurred to me that
  you might not care after all to linger in Nairobi, and it seemed hardly fair
  to keep the boy from getting a good job simply because be could make me
  comfortable for the remainder of a week. So, as there happened to be a
  special train going up I begged leave for him to ride in the caboose. He is a
  splendid gun-bearer. He never funks, but reloads coolly under the most
  nerve-trying conditions. He has his limitations, of course, but I have found
  him brave and faithful, and I pass him along to you with confidence.</p>

  <p>"And by the way: he has been to Mount Elgon with me. I was not looking for
  buried ivory, but he knows where the caves are in which anything might be!
  "Wishing you all good luck, Yours truly, "F. Courtney"</p>

  <p>For the moment we felt like men possessed of a new horse apiece. We were
  for dashing out to look the acquisition over. But Will checked us.</p>

  <p>"Recall what Courtney said about a dog?" he asked. "We can't all own
  him!"</p>

  <p>Fred sat down. "Ex-missionaries own dice," he announced. "That's how they
  come to be ex! You'll find them in the little box on the shelf, Will. We'll
  throw a main for Kazimoto!"</p>

  <p>"I know a better gamble than that!"</p>

  <p>"Name it, America."</p>

  <p>"Bring the coon in and have him choose."</p>

  <p>So I went out and felt tempted to speak cordially to the homeless ugly
  black man&mdash;to give him a hint that he was welcome. But it is a fatal
  mistake to make a "soft" impression on even the best natives at the
  start.</p>

  <p>"Karibu!" I said gruffly when I had looked him over, using one of the six
  dozen Swahili words I knew as yet.</p>

  <p>He arose with the unlabored ease that I have since learned to look for in
  all natives worth employing; and followed me indoors. Will and Fred were
  seated in judicial attitudes, and I took a chair beside them.</p>

  <p>"What is your name?" demanded Fred.</p>

  <p>"Kazimoto."</p>

  <p>"Um-m! That means 'Work-like-the-devil.' Let us hope you live up to it.
  Your former master gives you a good character."</p>

  <p>"Why not, bwana? My spirit is good."</p>

  <p>"Do you want work?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"How much money do you expect to get?"</p>

  <p>"Sijui!"</p>

  <p>"Don't say 'sijui'!" I cut in, remembering Schillingschen's method.</p>

  <p>"Six rupees a month and posho," he said promptly. Posho means rations, or
  money in lieu of rations.</p>

  <p>"Don't you rather fancy yourself?" suggested Fred with a perfectly
  straight face.</p>

  <p>"Say two dollars a month all told!" Will whispered to me behind his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"I am a good gun-bearer!" the native answered. "My spirit is good. I am
  strong. There is nobody better than me as a gun-bearer!"</p>

  <p>"We happen to want a headman," answered Fred. "Have you ever been
  headman?"</p>

  <p>"Would you like to be?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Are you able?"</p>

  <p>"Surely."</p>

  <p>"Choose, then. Which of us would you like to work for?"</p>

  <p>"You!" he answered promptly, pointing at Fred.</p>

  <p>It was on the tip of the tongue of every one of us to ask him instantly
  why, but that would have been too rank indiscretion. It never pays to seem
  curious about a native's personal reasons, and it was many weeks before we
  knew why he had made up his mind in advance to choose Fred and not either of
  us for his master.</p>

  <p>His choice made, and the offer of his services accepted, he took over Fred
  forthwith&mdash;demanded his keys&mdash;found out which our room was
  &mdash;went over our belongings and transferred the best of our things into
  Fred's bag and the worst of his into ours&mdash;remade Fred's bed after a
  mysterious fashion of his own, taking one of my new blankets and one of
  Will's in exchange for Fred's old ones&mdash;cleaned Fred's guns thoroughly
  after carefully abstracting the oil and waste from our gun-cases and
  transferring them to Fred's&mdash;removed the laces from my shooting boots
  and replaced them with Fred's knotted ones&mdash;sharpened Fred's razors and
  shaved himself with mine (to the enduring destruction of its once artistic
  edge)&mdash;and departed in the direction of the bazaar.</p>

  <p>He returned at the end of an hour and a half with a motley following of
  about twenty, arrayed in blankets of every imaginable faded hue and in every
  stage of dirtiness.</p>

  <p>"You wanting cook," he announced. "These three making cook."</p>

  <p>He waved three nondescripts to the front, and we chose a tall Swahili
  because he grinned better than the others. "Although," as Fred remarked,
  "what the devil grinning has to do with cooking is more than anybody knows."
  The man, whose name was Juma, turned out to be an execrable cook, but as he
  never left off grinning under any circumstances (and it would have been
  impossible to imagine circumstances worse than those we warred with later on)
  we never had the heart to dismiss him.</p>

  <p>After that, Will and I selected a servant apiece who were destined forever
  to wage war on Kazimoto in hopeless efforts to prevent his giving Fred the
  best end of everything. Mine was a Baganda who called himself Matches,
  presumably because his real name was unpronounceable. Will chose a Malindi
  boy named Tengeneza (and that means arrange in order, fix, make over, manage,
  mend&mdash;no end of an ominous name!). They were both outclassed from the
  start by Kazimoto, but to add to the handicap he insisted that since he was a
  headman he would need some one to help look after Fred at times when other
  duties would monopolize his attention. He himself picked out an imp of
  mischief whose tribe I never ascertained, but who called himself Simba
  (lion), and there and then Simba departed up-stairs to steal for Fred
  whatever was left of value among Will's effects and mine.</p>

  <p>We had scarcely got used to the idea of once more having a savage apiece
  to wait on us when Kazimoto turned up at the door with a string of porters
  and a Goanese railway clerk. We had left our tents and heavy baggage checked
  at the station, but had said nothing about them to our new headman; however,
  he had made inquiries and worked out a plan on his own account. The railway
  clerk asked to know whether he should let Kazimoto have our things.</p>

  <p>"Why?" demanded Fred.</p>

  <p>"This hotel no good!" announced Kazimoto. "No place for boys. Heap too
  many plenty people. Pitching camp, that good!"</p>

  <p>"All right," said Fred, and then and there paid our baggage charges.</p>

  <p>Presently Brown of Lumbwa, who had spent most of the daylight hours in The
  little corrugated iron bar run by a Goanese in the bazaar, came lurching past
  the township camping ground, and viewed Kazimoto with his gang pitching our
  tents. He asked questions, but could get no information, so came along to
  us.</p>

  <p>"Where you chaps going?" he demanded, leaning against the wall. Fred took
  advantage of the opportunity and examined him narrowly as to his knowledge of
  German East and ways of getting there. He was in an aggravating mood that
  made at one moment a very well of information of him, and at the next a mere
  garrulous ass.</p>

  <p>"Come along o' me t' Lumbwa," was his final word on the matter. "I'll put
  you on a road nobody knows an' nobody, uses!"</p>

  <p>We spent that night under canvas and talked the matter out. The usual way
  to reach Lumbwa was to wait for a freight, or construction train and beg
  leave to ride on that, for as yet, no passenger trains were running regularly
  on the western section of the line. But there was no rule against traveling
  anywhere south of the equator, and it was our purpose to march down into
  German East without any one being the wiser.</p>

  <p>The next morning we imagined Brown was sober and sorry enough to hold his
  tongue, so, without going into details with him, we agreed to go with him
  "some of the way," and Fred spent the whole of that morning in the bazaar
  buying loads of food and general supplies. Will and I engaged porters, and
  with Kazimoto's aid as interpreter, had fifty ready to march that
  afternoon.</p>

  <p>The whole trick of starting on a journey is to start. If you only make a
  mile or two the first day you have at least done better than stand still;
  loads have been apportioned and porters broken in to some extent; you have
  broken the spell of inertia, and hereafter there is less likely to be
  trouble. We made up our minds to get away that afternoon, and I was sent back
  to the hotel to find Brown, who had gone for his belongings.</p>

  <p>If Brown had stayed sober all might have been well, but his headache and
  feeling of unworthiness had been too much for him and I found him with a
  straw in the neck of a bottle of whisky alternately laying down law to
  Georges Coutlass and drinking himself into a state of temporary bliss.</p>

  <p>"You Greeks dunno nothin'!" he asserted as I came in. "You never did know
  nothin', an' you're never goin' to know nothin'! 'Cause why? 'I'll tell you.
  Simply because I am goin' to tell! I'm mum, I am! When s'mother gents an' me
  'ave business, that's our business&mdash;see! None o' your business&mdash;
  'ss our business, an' I'm not goin' to tell you Greeks nothin' about where
  we're off to, nor why, nor when. An' you put that in your pipe an' smoke
  it!"</p>

  <p>I sat in the dining-room for a while, hoping that the Greek would go away;
  but as Brown was fast drinking himself into a condition when he could not
  have been moved except on stretcher, and was momentarily edging closer to an
  admission of all he knew or guessed about our intention, I took the bull by
  the horns at last&mdash;snatched away his whisky bottle, and walked off with
  it.</p>

  <p>He came after me swearing like a trooper, and his own porters, who had
  been waiting for more than an hour beside his loads, trailed along after him.
  Once in our camp we made a hammock for him out of a blanket tied to a pole,
  and made him over to two porters with the promise that they would get no
  supper if they lost him. Then we started&mdash;uphill, toward the red Kikuyu
  heights, where settlers were already trying to grow potatoes for which there
  was no market, and onions that would only run to seed.</p>

  <p>To our left rear and right front were the highest mountain ranges in
  Africa. Before us was the pass through which the railway threaded over the
  wide high table-land before dipping downward to Victoria Nyanza. On our left
  front was all Kikuyu country, and after that Lumbwa, and native reserves, and
  forest, and swamp, and desert, and the German boundary.</p>

  <p>We made a long march of it that first day, and camped after dark within
  two miles of Kikuyu station. Most of the scrub thereabouts was castor oil
  plant, that makes very poor fuel; yet there were lions in plenty that roared
  and scouted around us even before the tents were pitched.</p>

  <p>Nobody got much sleep that night, although the porters were perfectly
  indifferent to the risk of snoozing on the watch. Kazimoto produced a thing
  called a kiboko&mdash;a whip of hippopotamus-hide a yard and a half long, and
  with the aid of that and Will's good humor we constituted a yelling brigade,
  whose business was to make the welkin ring with godless noises whenever a
  lion came close enough to be dangerous.</p>

  <p>I made up a signal party of all our personal boys with our lanterns,
  swinging them in frantic patterns in the darkness in a way to terrify the
  very night itself. Fred played concertina nearly all night long, and when
  dawn came, though there were tracks of lions all about the camp we were only
  tired and sleepy. Nobody was missing; nobody killed.</p>

  <p>We never again took lions so seriously, although we always built fires
  about the camp in lion country when that was possible. Partly by dint of
  carelessness that brought no ill results, and partly from observation we
  learned that where game is plentiful lions are more curious than dangerous,
  and that unless something should happen to enrage them, or the game has gone
  away and they are hungry, they are likely to let well alone.</p>

  <p>If there are dogs in camp&mdash;and we bought three terrier pups that
  morning from a settler at Kikuyu&mdash;leopards are likely to be more
  troublesome than lions. The leopards seemed to yearn for dog-meat much as
  Brown of Lumbwa yearned for whisky.</p>

  <p>The journey to Lumbwa is one of the pleasantest I remember. We took
  Brown's supply of whisky from him, locked up with our own, sent him ahead in
  the hammock, and let him as work as guide by promises of whisky for supper if
  he did his duty, and threats of mere cold water if he failed.</p>

  <p>"But water rots my stomach!" he objected.</p>

  <p>"Lead on, then!" was the invariable, remorseless answer. So Brown led
  until we reached Naivasha with its strange lake full of hippo at an elevation
  so great that the mornings are frosty (and that within sight of the line)
  there was never a day that we were once out of sight of game from dawn to
  dark. When we awoke the morning mist would scatter slowly and betray sleepy
  herds of antelope, that would rise leisurely, stand staring at us, suddenly
  become suspicious, and then gallop off until the whole plain was a panorama
  of wheeling herds, reminding one of the cavalry maneuvers at Aldershot when
  the Guards regiments were pitted against the regular cavalry&mdash;all riding
  and no wits.</p>

  <p>Although we had to shoot enough meat for ourselves and men, we never once
  took advantage of those surprise parties in the early morning, preferring to
  stalk warier game at the end of a long march. The rains were a thing of the
  past, and we seldom troubled to pitch tents but slept under the stars with a
  sensation that the universe was one vast place of peace.</p>

  <p>Occasionally we reached an elevation from which we could look down and see
  men toiling to build the railway, that already reached Nyanza after the
  unfinished fashion of work whose chief aim is making a showing. Profits,
  performances were secondary matters; that railway's one purpose was to
  establish occupation of the head waters of the Nile and refute the German
  claim to prior rights there. At irregular intervals trains already went down
  to the lake, and passengers might ride on sufferance; but we deluded
  ourselves with the belief that by marching we threw enemies off the scent. It
  was pure delusion, but extremely pleasant while it lasted. Where Africa is
  green and high she is a lovely land to march across.</p>

  <p>Brown grew sober on the trip, as if approaching his chosen home gave him a
  sense of responsibility. His own reason for preferring the march to a ride in
  a construction train was simple:</p>

  <p>"Every favor you ask o' gov'ment, boys, leaves one less to fall back on in
  a pinch! Ask not, and they'll forget some o' your peccadillos. Ask too often,
  and one day when you really need a kindness you'll find the Bank o' Good Hope
  bu'sted! And, believe me, boys, that 'ud be a hell of a predicament for a
  poor sufferin' settler to find himself in!"</p>

  <p>The approach to Lumbwa was over steep hilly grass land, between forests of
  cedar&mdash;perfect country, kept clean by a wind that smelt of fern and
  clover.</p>

  <p>"You can tell we're gettin' near my place," said Brown, "by the number o'
  leopards that's about."</p>

  <p>We had to keep our three pups close at heel all the time, and even at that
  we lost two of them. One was taken from between Will's feet as he sat in camp
  cleaning his rifle. All he heard was the dog's yelp, and all he saw was a
  flash of yellow as the leopard made for the boulders close at hand. The other
  was taken out of my tent. I had tied it to the tent pole, but the stout cord
  snapped like a hair and the darkness swallowed both leopard and its prey
  before I could as much as reach my rifle to get a shot.</p>

  <p>"Splendid country for farmin" Brown remarked, "Splendid. Only you can't
  keep sheep because the leopards take 'em. You can't keep hens for the same
  reason. Nor yet cows, because the leopards get the calves&mdash;leastways,
  that's to say unless you watch out awful cautious. Nor yet you can't keep
  pigeons, 'cause the leopards take them too. I sent to England for fancy
  pigeons&mdash;a dozen of em. Leopards got all but one, so I put him in the
  loft above my own house, where it seemed to me 'tweren't possible for a
  leopard to get, supposin' he'd dared. Went away the next day for some
  shootin', an' lo and behold!&mdash;came back that evenin' to discover my cook
  an' three others carryin' on as if Kingdom Come had took place at last. Never
  heard or saw such a jamboree. The blamed leopard was up in the loft; and had
  eaten the pigeon, feathers and all, but couldn't get out again!"</p>

  <p>"What happened? Nothin'! I was that riled I didn't stop to think&mdash;
  fixed a bayonet on the old Martini the gov'ment supplies to settlers out of
  the depths of its wisdom an' generosity&mdash;climbed up by the same route
  the leopard took&mdash;invaded him&mdash;an' skewered him wi' the bayonet in
  the dark! I wouldn't do it again for a kingdom&mdash;but I won't buy more
  pigeons either!"</p>

  <p>"What do you raise on your farm, then&mdash;pigs?" we asked.</p>

  <p>"No, the leopards take pigs."</p>

  <p>"What then?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;as I was explainin' to that Greek Georges Coutlass at
  Nairobi&mdash;there's a way of farmin' out your cattle among the natives that
  beats keepin' 'em yourself. The natives put 'em in the village pen o' nights;
  an' besides, they know about the business.</p>

  <p>"All you need do is give 'em a heifer calf once in a while, and they're
  contented. I keep a herd o' two hundred cows in a native village not far from
  my place. The natural increase o' them will make me well-to-do some day."</p>

  <p>The day before we reached Brown's tiny homestead we heard a lot of
  shooting over the hill behind us.</p>

  <p>"That'll be railway men takin' a day off after leopards," announced Brown
  with the air of a man who can not be mistaken.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Fred and I went back to see, but could make out nothing. We
  lay on the top of the hill and watched for two or three hours, but although
  we heard rifle firing repeatedly we did not once catch sight of smoke or men.
  We marched into camp late that night with a feeling of foreboding that we
  could not explain but that troubled us both equally.</p>

  <p>Once or twice in the night we heard firing again, as if somebody's camp
  not very far away was invaded by leopards, or perhaps lions. Yet at dawn
  there were no signs of tents. And when that night we arrived at Brown's
  homestead we seemed to have the whole world to ourselves.</p>

  <p>Brown's house was a tiny wooden affair with a thick grass roof. It boasted
  a big fireplace at one end of the living-room, and a chimney that Brown had
  built himself so cunningly that smoke could go up and out but no leopards
  could come down.</p>

  <p>He got very drunk that night to celebrate the home-coming, and stayed
  completely drunk for three days, we making use of his barn to give our
  porters a good rest. By day we shot enough meat for the camp, and at night we
  sat over the log fire, praying that Brown might sober up, Fred singing songs
  to his infernal concertina, and all the natives who could crowd in the
  doorway listening to him with all their ears. Fred made vast headway in
  native favor, and learned a lot of two languages at once.</p>

  <p>Every day we sent Kazimoto and another boy exploring among the Lumbwa
  tribe, gathering information as to routes and villages, and it was Kazimoto
  who came running in breathless one night just as Brown was at last sobering
  up, with the news that some Greeks had swooped down on Brown's cattle, had
  wounded two or three of the villagers who herded them, and had driven the
  whole herd away southward.</p>

  <p>That news sobered Brown completely. He took the bottle of whisky he had
  just brought up from the cellar and replaced it unopened.</p>

  <p>"There's on'y one Greek in the world knew where my cattle were!" he
  announced grimly. "There's on'y one Greek I ever talked to about cattle.
  Coutlass, by the great horn spoon! The blackguard swore he was after you
  chaps&mdash;swore he didn't care nothing about me! What he did to you was
  none o' my business, o' course&mdash;an' I figured anyway as you could look
  out for yourselves! Not that I told the swine any o' your business, mind! Not
  me! I was so sure he was gunnin' for you that I told him my own business to
  throw him off your track! And now the devil goes an' turns on me!"</p>

  <p>He got down his rifle and began overhauling it, feverishly, yet with a
  deliberate care that was curious in a man so recently drunk. While he cleaned
  and oiled be gave orders to his own boys; and what with having servants of
  our own and having to talk to them mostly in the native tongue, we were able
  to understand pretty well the whole of what he said.</p>

  <p>"You're not going to start after them to-night?" Fred objected. But he and
  Will were also already overhauling weapons, for the second time that evening.
  (It is religion with the true hunter never to eat supper until his rifle is
  cleaned and oiled.) I got my own rifle down from the shelf over Brown's stone
  mantelpiece.</p>

  <p>"What d'you take me for?" demanded Brown. "There's one pace they'll go at,
  an' that's the fastest possible. There's one place they'll head for, an'
  that's German East. They can't march faster than the cattle, an' the
  cattle'll have to eat. Maybe they'll drive 'em all through the first night,
  and on into the next day; but after that they'll have to rest 'em an' graze
  'em a while. That's when we'll begin to gain. The tireder the cattle get, the
  faster we'll overhaul 'em, for we can eat while we're marchin', which the
  cattle can't! You chaps just stay here an' look after my farm till I come
  back!"</p>

  <p>"You mean you propose to go alone after them?" asked Fred.</p>

  <p>"Why not? Whose cattle are they?"</p>

  <p>He was actually disposed to argue the point.</p>

  <p>"Man alive, there'll be shootin'!" he insisted. "If they once get over the
  border with all those cattle, the Germans'll never hand 'em over until every
  head o' cattle's gone. They'll fine 'em, an' arrest 'em, an' trick 'em, an'
  fine 'em again until the Germans own the herd all legal an' proper&mdash; an'
  then they'll chase the Greeks back to British East for punishment same as
  they always do. What good 'ud that be to me? No, no! Me&mdash;I'm going to
  catch 'em this side o' the line, or else bu'st&mdash;an' I won't be too
  partic'lar where the line's drawn either! There's maybe a hundred miles to
  the south o' their line that the Germans don't patrol more often than once in
  a leap-year. If I catch them Greeks in any o' that country, I'm going to kid
  myself deliberate that it's British East, and act accordin'!"</p>

  <p>At last we convinced him, although I don't remember how, for he was
  obstinate from the aftermath of whisky, that we would no more permit him to
  go alone than he would consider abandoning his cattle. Then we had to decide
  who should follow with our string of porters, for if forced marching was in
  order it was obvious that we should far outdistance our train.</p>

  <p>We invited Brown to follow with all the men while we three skirmished
  ahead, but he waxed so apoplectically blasphemous at the very thought of it
  that Fred assured him the proposal was intended for a joke. Then we argued
  among ourselves, coaxed, blarneyed, persuaded, and tried to bribe one
  another. Finally, all else failing, we tossed a coin for it, odd man out, and
  Fred lost.</p>

  <p>So Brown, Will Yerkes and I, with Kazimoto, our two personal servants, and
  six boys to carry one tent for the lot of us and food and cooking pots,
  started off just as the moon rose over the nearest cedars, and laughed at
  Fred marshaling the sleepy porters by lamplight in the open space between the
  house and barn. He was to follow as fast as the loaded porters could be made
  to travel, and with that concertina of his to spur them on there was little
  likelihood of losing touch. But the rear-guard, when it comes to pursuing a
  retreating enemy, is ever the least alluring place.</p>

  <p>"You've got all the luck," he shouted. "Make the most of it or I'll never
  gamble on the fall of a coin again!"</p>

  <p>That pursuit was a journey of accidents, chapter after chapter of them in
  such close sequence that the whole was a nightmare without let-up or reason.
  I began the book by falling into an elephant pit.</p>

  <p>Before we had gone a mile in the dark we stood in doubt as to whether the
  most practicable trail went right or left. Brown set his own indecision down
  frankly to the whisky that had muddled him. Even Kazimoto, who had passed
  that way three times, did not know for certain. So I went forward to scout
  &mdash;stepped into the deep shadow of some jungle&mdash;trod on nothing
  &mdash;threw the other foot forward to save myself&mdash;and fell downward
  into blackness for an eternity.</p>

  <p>I brought up at last unhurt in the trash and decaying vegetation at the
  bottom of a pit, and looked up to see the stars in a rough parallelogram
  above me, whose edge I guessed was more than thirty feet above my head. I
  started to dig my way out, but the crumbling sides fell in and threatened to
  bury me alive unless I kept still. So I shouted until my lungs ached, but
  without result. I suppose the noise went trumpeting upward out of the hole
  and away to the clouds and the stars. At any rate, Will and Brown swore
  afterward they never heard it.</p>

  <p>I was fifteen minutes in the hole that very likely had held many an
  elephant with his legs wedged together under him until the poor brute
  perished of thirst, before it occurred to me to fire my rifle. I fired
  several shots when I did think of it; but we had agreed on no system of
  signals, and instead of coming to find me at once, the other two cursed me
  for wasting time shooting at leopards in the dark instead of scouting for the
  track. I used twenty cartridges before they came to see what sort of battle I
  was waging, and with the last shot I nearly blew Brown's helmet off as he
  stooped over the hole to look down in.</p>

  <p>Then there were more precious minutes wasted while someone cut a long pole
  for me to swarm up, and at the end of that time, when I stood on firm ground
  at last and wiped the blood from hands and knees, we were no wiser about the
  proper direction to take.</p>

  <p>The next accident was a little before midnight. Will Yerkes was leading, I
  following, next the boys, and Brown bringing up the rear (for in those wild
  hills there is never a good track wide enough for two men to march abreast.
  Even the cattle proceed in single file unless driven furiously.) Will came on
  a leopard devouring its kill, a fat buck, in the midst of the track in the
  moonlight, and the brute resented the interruption of his meal. It slunk into
  the shadows before Will could get a shot at it, and for the next two hours
  followed us, slinking from shadow to shadow, snarling and growling. It
  plainly intended murder, but which of us was to be the victim, and when,
  there was no means of guessing, so that the nerves of all of us were tortured
  every time the brute approached.</p>

  <p>We wasted at least thirty cartridges on futile efforts to guess his
  whereabouts in velvet black shadows, and Brown went through all the stages
  from simple nervousness to fear, and then to frenzy, until we feared he would
  shoot one of us in frantic determination to ring the leopard's knell.</p>

  <p>At last the brute did rush in, and of course where least expected. He
  seized one of our porters by the shoulder, his claws doing more damage than
  his teeth. I shot him by thrusting my rifle into his ear, and although that
  dropped him instantly his claws, in the dying spasm and by the weight of his
  fall, tore wounds in the man's arm eighteen or twenty inches long.</p>

  <p>One of the things we did have with us was bandages. But it took time to
  attend to the man's wounds properly by lamp and moonlight, and after that he
  could neither march fast, nor was there anywhere to leave him.</p>

  <p>So just before dawn Fred came up with us, and was more pleased at our
  discomfiture than sympathetic. He told off two men to carry the injured
  porter to a mission station more than a day's march away, and redistributed
  the loads. Then we went on again, once more placing rock, hill, and cedar
  forest between us and our supply column, this time with Fred's counsel
  ringing in our ears.</p>

  <p>"Better send for nursemaids and perambulators, and have yourselves
  pushed!"</p>

  <p>At noon that day we found the track of the driven cattle, and soon after
  that came on the half-devoured carcass of a heifer that the Greeks had shot,
  presumably because it could not march, and perhaps with the added reason that
  freshly-killed meat would draw off leopards and hyenas and provide peace for
  a few miles.</p>

  <p>Once on the trail it would not have been easy to lose it, except in the
  dark, for the Greek marauders were bent on speed and the driven cattle had
  smashed down the undergrowth in addition to leaving deep hoof-prints at every
  water-course.</p>

  <p>The first suspicion that dawned on me of something more than mere
  freebooting on the part of Coutlass, was due to the discovery of hoof-prints
  of either mules or horses. I was marching alone in advance, and came on them
  beside a stream that was only apparently fordable in that one place. After
  making sure of what they were I halted to let Will and Brown catch up.</p>

  <p>"Did Coutlass have money enough to buy mules for himself and gang?"
  wondered Will.</p>

  <p>"That robber?" snorted Brown. "When Lady Saffren Waldon refused him
  tobacco money in the hotel he tried to borrow from me!"</p>

  <p>"Where could be steal mules?" Will asked.</p>

  <p>"Nowhere. Aren't any!"</p>

  <p>"Horses' then?"</p>

  <p>"He'd never take horses. They'd die."</p>

  <p>"What are they riding, then?"</p>

  <p>"Unless he stole trained zebras from the gov'ment farm at Naivasha," said
  Brown, "an' they're difficulter to ride 'an a greasy pole up-ended on a
  earthquake, he must ha' bought mules from the one man who has any to sell.
  And he lives t'other side o' Nairobi. There are none between there and here
  &mdash;none whatever. Zachariah Korn&mdash;him who owns mules&mdash;is too
  wide awake to be stolen from. He bought 'em, you take it from me, and paid
  twice what they were worth into the bargain."</p>

  <p>"Then he bought them with her money!" said Will.</p>

  <p>"If not Schillingschen's," said I.</p>

  <p>"Or the Sultan of Zanzibar's" said Will, "or the German government's."</p>

  <p>"But why? Why should she, or they, conspire at great expense and risk to
  steal Brown's cattle?"</p>

  <p>"They'll figure," said Will, "that Brown is helping us, and therefore,
  Brown is an enemy. Prob'ly they surmise Brown is in league with us to show us
  a short cut to what we're after. If that's how they work it out, then they
  wouldn't need think much to conclude that putting Brown on the blink would
  hoodoo us. Maybe they allow that that much bad luck to begin with would
  unsettle Brown's friendly feelings for us. Anyway&mdash;somebody bought the
  mules&mdash;somebody stole the cattle&mdash;cattle are somewhere ahead. Let's
  hurry forward and see!"</p>

  <p>We did hurry, but made disgustingly poor time. Once a dozen buffalo
  stampeded our tiny column. Our five porters dropped their loads, and the
  biggest old bull mistook our only tent for our captain's dead body and
  proceeded to play ball with it, tossing it and tearing it to pieces until at
  last Will got a chance for a shoulder shot and drilled him neatly. Two other
  bulls took to fighting in the midst of the excitement and we got both of
  them. Then the rest trotted off; so we packed the horns of the dead ones on
  the head of our free porter (for the tent he had carried was now utterly no
  use) and hastened on.</p>

  <p>Once, in trying to make a cut that should have saved us ten or fifteen
  miles between two rivers, we fell shoulder-deep into a bog and only escaped
  after an hour's struggle during which we all but lost two porters. We had to
  retrace our steps and follow the Greek's route, only to have the
  mortification of seeing Fred and our column of supplies coming over the top
  of a rise not eight miles behind us.</p>

  <p>Determined not to be overtaken by him a second time and treated to advice
  about nursemaids, we dispensed with sleep altogether for that night, and
  nearly got drowned at the second river.</p>

  <p>We found a native who owned a thing he called a mtungi&mdash;a near-
  canoe, burned out of a tree-trunk. He assured us the ford was very winding
  (he drew a wiggly finger-mark in the mud by way of illustration) but that his
  boat would hold twice our number, and that be could take us over easily in
  the dark. In fact he swore he had ferried twice our number over on darker
  nights more than twenty or thirty times. He also said that he had taken the
  cattle over by the ford early that morning, and then had crossed over in the
  boat with two Greeks and a bwana Goa. He showed us the brass wire and beads
  they gave him in proof of that statement, and we began to put some faith in
  his tale.</p>

  <p>So we all piled into his crazy boat with our belongings, and be promptly
  lost the way amid the twelve-foot grass-papyrus mostly&mdash;that divided the
  river into narrow streams and afforded protection to the most savagely hungry
  mosquitoes in the world. Our faces and hands were wet with blood in less than
  two minutes.</p>

  <p>Presently, instead of finding bottom for his pole, he pushed us into deep
  water. The grass disappeared, and a ripple on the water lipping dangerously
  within three inches of our uneven gunwale proved that we were more or less in
  the main stream. We had enjoyed that sensation for about a minute, and were
  headed toward where we supposed the opposite bank must be, when a hippo in a
  hurry to breathe blew just beside us&mdash;saw, smelt, or heard us (it was
  all one to him)&mdash;and dived again.</p>

  <p>I suppose in order to get his head down fast enough he shoved his rump up,
  and his great fat back made a wave that ended that voyage abruptly. Our three
  inches of broadside vanished. The canoe rocked violently, filled, turned
  over, and floated wrong side up.</p>

  <p>"All the same," laughed Will, spluttering and spitting dirty water,
  "here's where the crocks get fooled! They don't eat me for supper!"</p>

  <p>He was first on top of the overturned boat, and dragged me up after him.
  Together we hauled up Brown, who could not swim but was bombastically furious
  and unafraid; and the three of us pulled out the porters and the fatuous
  boat's owner. The pole was floating near by, and I swam down-stream and
  fetched it. When they had dragged me back on to the wreck the moon came out,
  and we saw the far bank hazily through mist and papyrus.</p>

  <p>The boat floated far more steadily wrong side up, perhaps because we had
  lashed all our loads in place and they acted as ballast. Will took the pole
  and acted the part of Charon, our proper pilot contenting himself with
  perching on the rear end lamenting the ill-fortune noisily until Kazimoto
  struck him and threatened to throw him back into the water.,</p>

  <p>"They don't want a fool like you in the other world," he assured him. "You
  will die of old age!"</p>

  <p>The papyrus inshore was high enough to screen the moon from us, and we had
  to hunt a passage through it in pitch darkness. Then, having found the muddy
  bank at last (and more trillions of mosquitoes) we had to drag the overturned
  boat out high and dry to rescue our belongings. And that was ticklish work,
  because most of the crocodiles, and practically all the largest ones, spend
  the night alongshore.</p>

  <p>Matches were wet. We had no means of making a flare to frighten the
  monsters away. We simply had to "chance it" as cheerfully and swiftly as we
  could, and at the end of a half-hour's slimy toil we carried our muddied
  loads to the nearest high ground and settled down there for the night.</p>

  <p>It would be mad exaggeration to say we camped. Wet to the skin&mdash;
  dirty to the verge of feeling suicidal&mdash;bitten by insects until the
  blood ran down from us&mdash;lost (for we bad no notion where the end of the
  ford might be)&mdash;at the mercy of any prowling beasts that might discover
  us (for our rifle locks were fouled with mud)&mdash;we sat with chattering
  teeth and waited for the morning.</p>

  <p>When the sun rose we found a village less than four hundred yards away and
  sent the boys down to it to unpack the loads and spread everything in the sun
  to dry, while we went down to the river again and washed our rifles. Then we
  dried and oiled them, and without a word of bargain or explanation, invaded
  the cleanest looking hut, lay down on the stamped clay floor, and slept. It
  was only clean-looking, that hut. It housed more myriads of fleas than the
  air outside supported "skeeters;" but we slept, unconscious of them all.</p>

  <p>At four that afternoon we had the mortification of being roused by Fred's
  voice, and the dumping of loads as his sixty porters dropped their burdens
  inside the village stockade. He had scorned the ferry and crossed the ford on
  foot, making a prodigious splash to keep crocodiles away, and was as full of
  life and fun as a schoolboy on vacation.</p>

  <p>"Wake up, you vorloepers!"* he shouted. "Wake up! Shake off the fleas and
  come, and I'll show you something."</p>

  <p>[* <i>vorloeper, voorloper, forelooper</i> (Dutch and Afrikaans)&mdash;a
  scout; a member of an advance party. See <i><a href=

  <p>He had already had the tale of our night's misfortune in detail from the
  owner of the only canoe (who claimed double pay on the ground that we had
  lost no loads in spite of over-turning. "The last really white man who
  crossed lost all his loads!" he explained.) .</p>

  <p>"Come and I'll show you something you never saw before, you scouts!
  &mdash;you advance guard!&mdash;you line of skirmishers!"</p>

  <p>Will hurled a lump of earth at him, and chased him to the river, where
  they wrestled, trying to throw each other in, until both were breathless.
  Then, when neither could make another effort:</p>

  <p>"Look!" gasped Fred.</p>

  <p>There was an island in mid-stream below where we must have crossed. The
  stream was straight, and from where we stood we could see more than half a
  mile of alluvial mud with an arm of the river on either side. The mud was
  white, not black&mdash;so white that it dazzled the eyes to look at it.</p>

  <p>"Know what it is?" Fred panted.</p>

  <p>We did not know, and it was no use guessing. It looked like burned lime,
  or else the secretions of about a billion birds; and there were no birds to
  speak of.</p>

  <p>"Crocodile eggs!" said Fred.</p>

  <p>We did not believe that. Even Brown did not believe it. There was no time
  to spare, but Brown out of curiosity agreed, so we took the absurd canoe and
  poled down to investigate. As we came nearer the solid white broke up into a
  myriad dots, and Fred's tale stood confirmed.</p>

  <p>They were as long as two hens' eggs laid end to end, or longer. They lay
  in the sun in batches in every stage of incubation, and from almost every
  batch there were little crocodiles emerging, that made straight for the
  water. What worse monster preyed on them to keep their numbers down, or what
  disease took care of their prolixity we could not guess. Perhaps they ate one
  another, or just died of hunger. The owner of the boat vowed there were no
  fish left in the river, and that the crocodiles did not eat hippo unless it
  were first dead.</p>

  <p>We took another tent from among Fred's loads, changed two of our porters
  for stronger ones, and went forward that evening; for it began to be obvious
  that the speed had been telling on the cattle. We passed two more dead
  heifers within a few miles of the river bank, and there were other signs that
  for all our long sleep we were gaining on them.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the Greeks thought they had shaken off pursuit. Judging by the
  compass they were headed for the shore of Victoria Nyanza, where the grazing
  would be better, food for men would be purchasable, and the number of
  villages closely spaced would make the task of night-herding vastly easier.
  There isn't a village in that part of Africa that is not proud to be a host
  to anybody's cattle, if only because the ownership of so much living wealth
  casts glory on all who come in contact with it.</p>

  <p>There was no means of telling whether or not we were over the German
  border. The boundary line had not been surveyed yet, and on the map the part
  where we were was set down as "unexplored," although that was scarcely
  accurate; the route was well enough known to Greeks and Arabs, and other had
  characters bent on smuggling or in some other way defeating the ends of
  justice.</p>

  <p>We marched that night until midnight, slept until dawn, and were off
  again. At noon we reached rising ground, and Kazimoto ran ahead of us to the
  summit. We saw him standing at gaze for three or four minutes with one hand
  shading his eyes before he came scampering back, as excited as if his own
  fortune were in the balance.</p>

  <p>"Huko-chini!" he shouted. "Huko-chini&mdash;mba-a-a-li sana!"*</p>

  <p>We hurried up-hill, but for many minutes could see nothing except a plain
  of waving grass higher than a man's head and almost as impenetrable as
  bamboo-country that carried small hope in it for man or beast, that would be
  a holocaust in the dry season when the heat set fire to the grass, and was an
  insect-haunted marsh at most other times. However, path across it there must
  be, for the Greeks had driven Brown's cattle that way that very morning, and
  Kazimoto swore he could see them in the distance, although Brown, and Will,
  and I&mdash;all three keen-sighted&mdash;could see nothing whatever but
  immeasurable, worthless waving grass.</p>

  <p>At last I detected a movement near the horizon that did not synchronize
  with the wind-blown motion of the rest. I pointed it out to the others, and
  after a few minutes we agreed that it moved against the wind.</p>

  <p>"They're hurrying again," said Brown, peering under both hands. "There's
  no feed for cattle on all this plain. They're racing to get to short grass
  before the cattle all die. Come on&mdash;let's hurry after 'em!"</p>

  <p>For the second time on that trip we essayed a short cut, making as
  straight as a bee would fly for the point on the horizon where we knew the
  Greeks to be. And for the second time we fell into a bog, nearly losing our
  lives in it. We had to pull one another out, using even our precious rifles
  as supports in the yielding mud, and then spending equally precious time in
  cleaning locks and sights again.</p>

  <p>After that we hunted for the cattle trail and followed that closely; and
  that was not so easy as it reads, because the trampled grass had risen again,
  and cattle and mounted men can cross easily ground that delays men on
  foot.</p>

  <p>The heat was that of an oven. The water&mdash;what there was of it in the
  holes and swampy places&mdash;stank, and tasted acrid. The flies seemed to
  greet us as their only prospect of food that year. The monotony of hurrying
  through grass-stems that cut off all view and only showed the sky through a
  waving curtain overhead was more nerve-trying than the physical weariness and
  thirst.</p>

  <p>We slept a night in that grass, burning some of it for a smudge to keep
  mosquitoes at bay, and an hour after dawn, reaching rising ground again,
  realized that we had our quarry within reach at last.</p>

  <p>They were out in the open on short good grazing. The Greeks' tent was
  pitched. We could see their mules, like brown insects, tied under a tree, and
  the cattle dotted here and there, some lying down, some feeding.</p>

  <p>"At last!" said Brown. "Boys, they're our meat! There's a tree to hang the
  Greeks and the Goa to! When we've done that, if you'll all come back with me
  I'll send to Nairobi for an extra jar of Irish whisky, and we'll have a spree
  at Lumbwa that'll make the fall of Rome sound like a Sunday-school picnic!
  We're in German territory now, all right. There's not a white man for a
  hundred miles in any direction&mdash;except your friend that's coming along
  behind. There's nobody to carry tales or prevent! I'm no savage. I'm no
  degenerate. I don't hold with too much of anything, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There'll be no dirty work, if that's what you mean," said Will
  quietly.</p>

  <p>Brown stared hard at him.</p>

  <p>"D'you mean you'll object to hanging 'em?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least. We hang or shoot cattle thieves in the States. I said
  there'll be no dirty work, that's all."</p>

  <p>"Shall we rest a while, and come on them fresh in the morning?" I
  proposed.</p>

  <p>"Forward!" snorted Brown. "Why d'you want to wait?"</p>

  <p>"Forward it is!" agreed Will. "When we get a bit closer we'll stop and
  hold council of war."</p>

  <p>"One minute!" said I. "Tell me what that is?"</p>

  <p>I had been searching the whole countryside, looking for some means of
  stealing on the marauders unawares and finding none. They had chosen their
  camping place very wisely from the point of view of men unwilling to be taken
  by surprise. Far away over to our right, appearing and disappearing as I
  watched them, were a number of tiny black dots in sort of wide half-moon
  formation, and a larger number of rather larger dots contained within the
  semicircle.</p>

  <p>"Cattle!" exploded Brown.</p>

  <p>"And men!" added Will.</p>

  <p>"Black men!" said I. "Black men with spears!"</p>

  <p>"Masai!" said Kazimoto excitedly. He had far the keenest eyes of all of
  us.</p>

  <p>We were silent for several minutes. The veriest stranger in that land
  knows about the feats and bravery of the Masai, who alone of all tribes did
  not fear the Arabs, and who terrorized a quarter of a continent before the
  British came and broke their power.</p>

  <p>"Mbaia cabisa!" muttered Kazimoto, meaning that the development was very
  bad indeed. And he had right to know</p>

  <p>He explained it was a raid. The Masai, in accordance with time-honored
  custom, had come from British East to raid the lake-shore villages of German
  territory, and were driving back the plundered cattle. None can drive cattle
  as Masai can. They can take leg-weary beasts by the tail and make them
  gallop, one beast encouraging the next until they all go like the wind. For
  food they drink hot blood, opening a vein in a beast's neck and closing it
  again when they have had their fill. Their only luggage is a spear. Their
  only speed-limit the maximum the cattle can be stung to. On a raid three
  hundred and sixty miles in six days is an ordinary rate of traveling.</p>

  <p>Just now they did not seem in much hurry. They had probably butchered the
  fighting men of all the villages in their rear, and were well informed as to
  the disposition of the nearest German forces. There were probably no Germans
  within a hundred miles. There was no telegraph in all those parts. To notify
  Muanza by runner and Bagamoyo on the coast from there by wire would take
  several days. Then Bagamoyo would have to wire the station at Kilimanjaro,
  and there was no earthly chance of Germans intercepting them before they
  could reach British East.</p>

  <p>Nor was there any treaty provision between British and German colonial
  governments for handing over raiders. The Germans had refused to make any
  such agreement for reasons best known to themselves. The fact that they were
  far the heaviest losers by the lack of reciprocal police arrangements was due
  to the fact that most of the Masai lived in British East. The Masai would
  have raided across either border with supreme indifference.</p>

  <p>"Masai not talking. Masai using spear and kill!" remarked Kazimoto.</p>

  <p>"One good thing our gov'ment's done," said Brown. "Just one. It has kept
  those rascals from owning rifles! But lordy! They've got spears that give a
  man the creeps to see!"</p>

  <p>He began looking to his rifle. So did Will and I.</p>

  <p>"Now this here is my fight," he explained. "Them's my cattle. They're all
  the wealth I own in the world. If I lose 'em I'm minded to die anyhow.
  There's nothing in life for a drunkard like me with all his money gone and
  nothing to do but take a mean white's job. You chaps just wait here and watch
  while I 'tend to my own affairs."</p>

  <p>"Exactly!" Will answered dryly. "I've a hundred rounds in my pockets. That
  ought to be enough."</p>

  <p>While we made ready, leaving our loads and porters in a safe place and
  giving the boys orders, I saw two things happen. First, the Masai became
  aware of the little Greek encampment and the two hundred head of cattle
  waiting at their mercy; and second, the Greeks grew aware of the Masai.</p>

  <p>The Greeks had boys with them; I saw at least half a dozen go scattering
  to round up the cattle. The tents began to come down, and I saw three figures
  that might be the Greeks and the Goanese holding a consultation near the
  tree.</p>

  <p>"And now," remarked Will, "I begin to see the humor in this comedy. Which
  are we&mdash;allies of the Greeks or of the Masai? Are we to help the Greeks
  get away with Brown's cattle, or help the Masai steal 'em from the Greeks?
  Are your cattle all branded, Brown?"</p>

  <p>"You blooming well bet they are!"</p>

  <p>"Masai know enough to alter a brand?"</p>

  <p>"Never heard o' their doing it."</p>

  <p>"Then if the Masai get away with them to British East, if you can find 'em
  you can claim 'em, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Claim 'em in court wi' the whole blooming tribe o' Masai&mdash;more'n a
  quarter of a million of 'em&mdash;all on hand to swear they bought 'em from
  me; an' the British gov'ment takin' sides with the black men, as it always
  does? Oh, yes! It sounds easy, that does!"</p>

  <p>"But if the Greeks get away with 'em," argued Will, "you've no chance of
  recovering at all."</p>

  <p>"I'll not take sides with Masai&mdash;even against Greeks!" Brown answered
  grimly, and Will laughed.</p>

  <p>"If we attack the Greeks first," I said, "perhaps they'll run. We're
  nearer to them than the Masai are. The Masai, will have to corral their own
  cattle before they can leave them to raid a new lot. We can open fire at long
  range begin with. If that scares the Greeks away, then we can, round up
  Brown's cattle and drive them back northward. We may possibly escape with
  them too quickly for the Masai to think it worth while to follow."</p>

  <p>Brown laughed cynically.</p>

  <p>"We can try it," he said. "An' if the Greeks don't run pretty quick
  they'll never run again&mdash;I'll warrant that!"</p>

  <p>Nobody had a better plan to propose, so we emptied our pockets of all but
  fifty rounds of ammunition each, and gave the rest to Kazimoto to carry, with
  orders to keep in hiding and watch, and run with cartridges to whoever should
  first need them.</p>

  <p>Then, because instead of corralling their cattle the Masai were already
  dividing themselves into two parties, one of which drove the cattle forward
  and the other diverged to study the attack, we ducked down under a ridge and
  ran toward the Greeks. The sooner we could get the first stage of the
  fighting off our hands the better.</p>

  <p>It proved a long way&mdash;far longer than I expected, and the going was
  rougher. Moreover, the Greeks' boys were losing no time about rounding up the
  cattle. By the time they were ready to make a move we were still more than a
  mile away, and out of breath.</p>

  <p>"If they go south," panted Brown, throwing himself down by a clump of
  grass to gasp for his third or fourth wind, "the Masai'll catch 'em sure, an'
  we'll be out o' the running! Lord send they head 'em back toward British
  East!"</p>

  <p>He was in much the worst physical condition because of the whisky, but his
  wits were working well enough. The Greeks on the other hand seemed undecided
  and appeared to be arguing. Then Brown's prayer was answered. The Greeks'
  boys decided the matter for them by stampeding the herd northward toward us.
  They did not come fast. They were lame, and bone-weary from hard driving, but
  they knew the way home again and made a bee line. Within a minute they were
  spread fan-wise between us and the Greeks, making a screen we could not shoot
  through.</p>

  <p>"Scatter to right and left!" Brown shouted. "Get round the wings!"</p>

  <p>But what was the use? He was in the center, and short-winded. I climbed on
  an ant-hill.</p>

  <p>"The Greeks are on the run!" I said. "They are headed southward! They've
  got their boys together, and have abandoned the cattle! They're off with
  their tent and belongings due south!"</p>

  <p>"The cowards!" swore Brown, with such disappointment that Will and I
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"Laugh all you like!" he said. "I've a long job on my hands! I'll have
  revenge on 'em if it takes the rest o' my life! I'll follow 'em to hell-and-
  gone!"</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile," I said, still standing on the ant-hill, "the Masai are
  following the cattle! They're smoking this way in two single columns of about
  twenty spears in each. The remainder are driving their own cattle about due
  eastward so as to be out of the way of trouble."</p>

  <p>"All right," said Brown, growing suddenly cheerful again. "Then it'll be a
  rear-guard action. Let the cattle through, and open fire behind 'em! Send
  that Kazimoto o' yours to warn our boys to round 'em up and drive 'em slow
  and steady northward!"</p>

  <p>Kazimoto ran back and gave the necessary orders. He lost no time about it,
  but returned panting, and lay down in a hollow behind us with cartridges in
  either fist and a grin on his face that would have done credit to a circus
  clown. I never, anywhere, saw any one more pleased than Kazimoto at the
  prospect of a fight.</p>

  <p>We let the cattle through and lay hidden, waiting for the raiders. They
  were in full war dress, which is to say as nearly naked as possible except
  for their spears, a leg ornament made from the hair of the colobus monkey, a
  leather apron hung on just as suited the individual wearer's fancy, a great
  shield, and an enormous ostrich-feather head-dress. They seemed in no hurry,
  for they probably guessed that the cattle would stop to graze again when the
  first scare was over; yet they came along as smoke comes, swiftly and easily,
  making no noise.</p>

  <p>Suddenly those in the lead caught sight of our boys getting behind the
  cattle to herd them northward. They halted to hold consultation&mdash;
  apparently decided that they had only unarmed natives to deal with&mdash; and
  came on again, faster than before.</p>

  <p>"Better open fire now!" said Brown, when they were still a quarter of a
  mile away.</p>

  <p>"Wait till you can see their eyes!" Will advised. "An unexpected volley at
  close quarters will do more havoc than hours of long-range shooting.</p>

  <p>"This ain't a long range!" Brown objected. "As for unexpected&mdash;just
  watch me startle 'em! My sight's fixed at four hundred. Watch!"</p>

  <p>He fired&mdash;we wished he had not. The leading Masai of the right- hand
  column jerked his head sidewise as the whistling bullet passed, and then
  there was nothing for it but to follow his lead and blaze away for all we
  were worth. If Brown had been willing to accept Will's advice there is
  nothing more likely than that the close-quarter surprise would have won the
  day for us. We would have done much more execution with three volleys at
  ten-yard range. As it was, we all missed with our finest shots, and the Masai
  took heart and charged in open order.</p>

  <p>The worst of it was that, although we dropped several of them, now the
  others had a chance to discover there were only three of us. Their leader
  shouted. The right-hand column continued to attack, but changed its tactics.
  The left-hand party made a circuit at top speed, outflanked us, and pursued
  the cattle.</p>

  <p>Supposing my count was right, we had laid out, either wounded or dead,
  seven of the crowd attacking us. This left perhaps fourteen against us, to be
  dealt with before the others could come back with the cattle and take us in
  the rear.</p>

  <p>Will brought another man down; I saw the blood splash on his forehead as
  the bullet drilled the skull cleanly. Then one man shouted and they all lay
  prone, beginning to crawl toward us with their shields held before, not as
  protection against bullets (for as that they were utterly worthless) but as
  cover that made their exact position merest guesswork.</p>

  <p>I fell back and took position on the ant-hill from which I had first seen
  them, thus making our position triangular and giving myself a chance to
  protect the other two should they feel forced to retire. The extra height
  also gave me a distinct advantage, for I could see the legs of the Masai over
  the tops of their shields, and was able to wound more than one of them so
  severely that they crawled to the rear.</p>

  <p>But the rest came on. Kazimoto began to be busy supplying cartridges. In
  that first real pinch we were in he certainly lived up to all Courtney had
  said of him, for without the stimulus of his proper master's eye he neither
  flinched nor faltered, but crawled from one to the other, dividing the spare
  rounds equally.</p>

  <p>The Masai began to attempt to outflank us, but my position on the ant-
  hill to the rear made that impossible; they found themselves faced by a side
  of the triangle from whichever side they attacked. But in turning to keep an
  eye on the flank I became aware of a greater danger. The cattle were coming
  back. That meant that the other Masai were coming, too, and that in a few
  moments we were likely to be overwhelmed. I shouted to Will and Brown, but
  either they did not hear me, or did not have time to answer.</p>

  <p>I fired half a dozen shots, and then distinctly heard the crack of a rifle
  from beyond the cattle. That gave matters the worst turn yet. If one of the
  raiders had a rifle, then unless I could spot him at once and put him out of
  action our cause was likely lost. I stood up to look for him and heard a wild
  cheer, followed by three more shots in quick succession. Then at last I saw
  Fred Oakes running along a depression in the ground, followed at a
  considerable distance by the advance-guard of his porters. He was running,
  and then kneeling to fire&mdash;running, and kneeling again. And he was not
  wasting ammunition. He was much the best shot of us all, now that Monty was
  absent.</p>

  <p>The terrified cattle stampeded past us, too wild to be checked by any
  noise. Seeing them, and sure now of their booty, the party attacking us
  hauled off and took to their heels. Will and Brown were for speeding them
  with bullets in the rear, but I yelled again, and this time made myself
  heard. Those who had got behind the cattle and were driving them were coming
  on with spears and shields raised to slay us in passing. The other two joined
  me, and we stood on the ant-hill three abreast. They charged us&mdash;seven
  or eight of them. Three bit the dust, but the rest came on, and if it had not
  been for two swift shots from Fred's rifle in the very nick of time we should
  have all been dead men.</p>

  <p>As it was, one seized me by the knees and we went over together, rolling
  down the ant-hill, he slashing at me with his great broad-bladed spear, I
  hold of his wrist with one hand, and with the other fist belaboring him in
  the face. He was stronger than I&mdash;greasier&mdash;sweatier&mdash; harder
  to hold. He slipped from under me, rolled on top, wrenched his wrist free,
  and in another second grinned in my face as, with both knees in my stomach,
  be raised the spear to kill. I shut my eyes. I had not another breath left,
  nor an effort in me, I thought I would deny him the pleasure of watching my
  death agony. But I could not keep my eyes shut. Opening them to see why he
  did not strike, I saw Kazimoto with my rifle in both hands swing for his
  skull with the full weight of the butt and all his strength. Kazimoto
  grunted. The Masai half turned his head at the sound. The butt hit home
  &mdash;broke off&mdash;and my face and breast were deluged with blood and
  brains.</p>

  <p>When I had wiped off that mess with Kazimoto's help I saw Fred and Will
  and Brown pursuing the retreating Masai, kneeling to shoot every few yards,
  at every other shot or so bringing down a victim, but being rapidly
  out-distanced. Cattle are all the Masai care about. They had the cattle. They
  had hold of tails and were making the whole herd scamper due east, where they
  no doubt knew of a trail not in maps. They made no attempt to defend
  themselves&mdash;left their dead lying&mdash;and ran. I saw two or three
  wounded ones riding on cows, and no doubt some of those who ran holding to
  the cows' tails were wounded, too.</p>

  <p>I was useless now, as far as fighting was concerned, for the butt of my
  rifle was broken clean off at the grip, but I ran on, and heard Brown shout:
  "Shoot cattle! Don't let the brutes get away with them all!"</p>

  <p>He was shooting cows himself when I came up, but it was Fred who stopped
  him.</p>

  <p>"Never mind that, old man. We'll follow 'em up! Our time's our own. We'll
  get your cattle back, never fear. Dead ones are no use."</p>

  <p>Brown stopped shooting and began to blubber. Whisky had not left him
  manhood enough to see his whole available resources carried away before his
  eyes, and he broke down as utterly as any child. It was neither agreeable nor
  decent to watch, and I turned away. I was feeling sick myself from the
  pressure of the Masai's knees in my stomach. That, and the sun, and the long
  march, and hunger (for we had not stopped to eat a meal that day) combined in
  argument, and I hunted about for a soft place and a little shade. It happened
  that Fred Oakes was watching me, although I did not know it. He suspected
  sunstroke.</p>

  <p>I saw a clump of rushes that gave shade enough. I could crush down some,
  and lie on those. I hurried, for I was feeling deathly sick now. As I reached
  the grass my knees began giving under me. I staggered, but did not quite
  fall.</p>

  <p>That, and Fred's watchfulness, saved my life; for at the moment that my
  head and shoulders gave the sudden forward lurch, a wounded Masai jumped out
  of the rushes and drove with his spear at my breast. The blade passed down my
  back and split my jacket.</p>

  <p>He sprang back, and made another lunge at me, but Fred's rifle barked at
  the same second and he fell over sidewise, driving the spear into my leg in
  his death spasm.</p>

  <p>The twenty minutes following that are the worst in memory. Kazimoto broke
  the gruesome news that the spear-blade was almost surely poisoned&mdash;
  dipped in gangrene. The Masai are no believers in wounded enemies, or mercy
  on the battlefield.</p>

  <p>We doubted the assertion for a while&mdash;I especially, for none but a
  hypochondriac would care to admit without proof that gangrene had been forced
  into his system. Kazimoto grew indignant, and offered to prove the truth of
  his claim on some animal. But there was no living animal in sight on which to
  prove it. We asked him how long gangrene, injected in that way, took to kill
  a man.</p>

  <p>"Very few minutes!" he answered.</p>

  <p>Then it occurred that none of us knew what to do. Kazimoto announced that
  he knew, and offered to make good at once if given permission. He demanded
  permission again and again from each one of us, making me especially repeat
  my words. Then be gathered stems of grass a third of an inch thick from the
  bed of the tiny watercourse, and proceeded to make a tiny fire, talking in a
  hurry as he did it to several of Fred's string of porters, who were now
  arriving on the scene.</p>

  <p>While I watched with a sort of tortured interest what he was doing at the
  fire, five of the largest boys with whom be had been speaking rushed me from
  behind, and before I could struggle, or even swear, had me pinned out on my
  back on the ground. One sat on my head; one on my poor bruised stomach; the
  others held wrists and ankles in such way that I could not break free, nor
  even kick much, however hard I tried.</p>

  <p>Then Kazimoto came with glowing ends of grass from the fire, blowing on
  them to keep them cherry-red, and inserted one after another into the open
  spear-wound. I could not cry out, because of the man sitting on my face, but
  I could bite. And to the everlasting glory of the man&mdash;Ali bin Yema, his
  name was&mdash;be it written that he neither spoke nor moved a muscle,
  although my front teeth met in his flesh.</p>

  <p>I do not know how long the process lasted, or how many times Kazimoto
  returned to the fire for more of his sizzling sticks, for I fainted; and when
  I came round the agony was still too intense to permit interest in anything
  but agony. They had my leg bandaged, how and with what I neither knew nor
  cared. And it was evident that unless they chose to leave me in camp where I
  was they would have to abandon all thought of pursuing Masai for the present.
  Even Brown saw the force of that, and he was the first to refuse flatly to
  leave me there.</p>

  <p>For a while they hunted through the grass for more wounded men, but found
  none. There must have been several, but they probably feared the sort of
  mercy from us that they habitually gave to their own enemies, and crawled
  away&mdash;in all likelihood to die of thirst and hunger, unless some beast
  of prey should smell them out and make an earlier end.</p>

  <p>Then there was consultation. It was decided a doctor for me was the most
  urgent need; that Muanza, the largest German station on Victoria Nyanza, was
  probably as near as anywhere, and that German East being our immediate
  destination anyway, the best course to take was forward, roughly south by
  west. So I was slung in a blanket on a tent-pole, and we started, I swearing
  like a pirate every time a boy stumbled and jolted me. (There is something in
  the nature of a burn that makes bad language feel like singing hymns.)</p>

  <p>Our troubles were not all over, for we passed through a country where buck
  were fairly plentiful, and that meant lions. They did no damage, but they
  kept us awake; and one night near the first village we came to, where our
  porters all quartered themselves with the villagers for sake of the change
  from their crowded tents, the fires that we made went out, and five lions (we
  counted their foot-prints afterward) came and sniffed around the pegs of the
  tent in which Fred and I lay, we lying still and shamming dead. To have
  lifted a rifle in the darkness and tried to shoot would have been
  suicide.</p>

  <p>Then there were trees we passed among&mdash;baobabs, whose youngest
  tendrils swung to and fro in the evening breeze like snakes head-downward.
  And taking advantage of that natural provision, twenty-foot pythons swung
  among them, in coloring and marking aping the habit of the tree. One of them
  knocked Fred's helmet off as he marched beside me. They are easy to kill. He
  shot it, and it dropped like a stone, three hundred pounds or more, but the
  sweat ran down Fred's face for half an hour afterward.</p>

  <p>(Since then I have seen pythons kill their prey a score of times. I never
  once saw one kill by crushing. The end of their nose is as hard as iron, and
  they strike a terrific blow with that, so swift that the eye can not follow
  it. Then, having killed by striking, they crawl around their prey and crush
  it into shape for swallowing.)</p>

  <p>But the worst of the journey was the wayside villages&mdash;dirty beyond
  belief, governed in a crude way by a headman whom the Germans honored with
  the title of sultani. These wayside beggars (for they were no better)&mdash;
  destitute paupers, taxed until their wits failed them in the effort to scrape
  together surplus enough out of which to pay&mdash;were supplied with a
  mockery of a crown apiece, a thing of brass and imitation plush that they
  wore in the presence of strangers. To add to the irony of that, the law of
  the land permitted any white man passing through to beat them, with as many
  as twenty-five lashes, if they failed to do his bidding.</p>

  <p>On arriving at such a village, the first thing we did was to ask for milk.
  If they had any they brought it, not daring to refuse for fear lest a German
  sergeant-major should be sent along to wreak vengeance later. But it was
  always too dirty to drink.</p>

  <p>That ceremony over, the headman retired and the village sick were brought
  for our inspection. Gruesome sores, running ulcers, wounds and crippled limbs
  were stripped and exposed to our most reluctant gaze. There was little we
  could do for them. Our own supply of medicines and bandages was almost too
  small for our own needs to begin with. By the time we passed three villages
  we scarcely had enough lint and liniment left to take care of my wound; but
  even that scant supply we cut in half for a particularly bad case.</p>

  <p>"Don't the Germans do anything for you?" we demanded, over and over
  again.</p>

  <p>The answer was always the same.</p>

  <p>"Germani mbaya!"*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Germani mbaya!</i> (Swahili)&mdash;The Germans are
  bad! <i><a href=
  "http://research.yale.edu/cgi-
bin/swahili/lookup.cgi?Word=mbaya&amp;EngP=0">The
  Internet Living Swahili Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>They were lifeless&mdash;listless&mdash;tamed until neither ambition nor
  courage was left. When their cattle had brought forth young and it looked as
  if there might be some profit at last, the Masai came and raided them, taking
  away all but the very old ones and the youngest calves. The Germans, they
  said, taxed them and took their weapons away, but gave them no
  protection.</p>

  <p>At one place we passed a rifle, lying all rusted by the track. At the next
  village we asked about it. They told us that a German native soldier had
  deserted six months before and had thrown his rifle away. Since that day no
  one had dared touch it, and they begged us to send back and lay it where we
  found it, lest the Germans come and punish them for touching it. So we did
  that, to oblige them, and they were grateful to the extent of offering us one
  of their only two male sheep.</p>

  <p>I forget now for how many days we traveled across that sad and saddening
  land, Fred always cheerful in spite of everything, Will more angry at each
  village with its dirt and sores, Brown moaning always about his lovely herd
  of cows, and I groaning oftener than not.</p>

  <p>My leg grew no better, what with jolting and our ignorance of how to treat
  it. Sometimes, in efforts to obtain relief, I borrowed a cow at one village
  and rode it to the next; but a cow is a poor mount and takes as a rule
  unkindly to the business. Now and then I tried to walk for a while, on
  crutches that Fred made for me; but most of the time I was carried in a
  blanket that grew hotter and more comfortless as day dragged after day.</p>

  <p>At last, however, we topped a low rise and saw Muanza lying on the lake-
  shore, with the great island of Ukereweto the northward in the distance. From
  where we first glimpsed it it was a tidy, tree-shaded, pleasant-looking
  place, with a square fort, and a big house for the commandant on a rise
  overlooking the town.</p>

  <p>"Now we'll wire Monty at last!" said Fred.</p>

  <p>"Now we'll shave and wash and write letters!" said Will.</p>

  <p>"Now at last for a doctor!" said I.</p>

  <p>But Brown said nothing, and Kazimoto wore a look of anxious
  discontent.</p>

  <br>
  &mdash;<i>The Darkness Comprehended It Not</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">WHAT first looked like a pleasant place dwindled into
  charmlessness and insignificance as we approached. There was
  neatness&mdash;of a kind. The round huts were confined to certain streets,
  and all inhabited by natives. Arabs, Swahili, Indians, Goanese, Syrians,
  Greeks and so on had to live in rectangular huts and keep to other streets.
  On one street, chiefly of stores, all the roofs were of corrugated iron. And
  all the streets were straight, with shade trees planted down both sides at
  exactly equal intervals.</p>

  <p>But the German blight was there, instantly recognizable by any one not
  mentally perverted by German teaching. The place was governed&mdash;existed
  for and by leave of government. The inhabitants were there on sufferance, and
  aware of it&mdash;not in the very least degree enthusiastic over German rule,
  but awfully appreciative.</p>

  <p>The first thing we met of interest on entering the township was a chain-
  gang, fifty long, marching at top speed in step, led by a Nubian soldier with
  a loaded rifle, flanked by two others, and pursued by a fourth armed only
  with the hippo-hide whip, called kiboko by the natives, that can cut and
  bruise at one stroke. He plied it liberally whenever the gang betrayed
  symptoms of intending to slow down.</p>

  <p>Those Nubians, we learned later, were deserters from British Sudanese
  regiments, and runaways from British jails, afraid to take the thousand-mile
  journey northward home again, scornful of all foreign black men, fanatic
  Mohammedans, and therefore fine tools in the German hand. They worked harder
  than the chain-gang, for they had to march with it step for step and into the
  bargain force it to do its appointed labor. The chain-gang kept the township
  clean&mdash;very clean indeed, as far as outward appearance went.</p>

  <p>The boma, or fort, was down by the water-front and its high eastern wall,
  pierced by only one gate, formed one boundary of the drill-ground that was
  also township square. Facing the wall on the eastern side of the square was a
  row of Indian and Arab stores. At the north end was the market building
  &mdash;an enormous structure of round stucco pillars supporting a great grass
  roof; and facing that at the southern end were the court-house, the hospital,
  and a store owned by the Deutsch-Ost-Afrika-Gesellschaft, known far and wide
  by its initials&mdash;a concern that owned the practical monopoly of
  wholesale import and export trade, and did a retail business, too.</p>

  <p>We went first to the hospital. Fred and Will lifted me out of the hammock,
  for my wound had grown much worse during the last few days, and the door
  being shut they set me down on the step. Then we sent Kazimoto into the fort
  with a note to the senior officer informing him that a European waited at the
  hospital in need of prompt medical treatment.</p>

  <p>The sentry admitted Kazimoto readily enough, but he did not come out again
  for half-an-hour, and then looked glum.</p>

  <p>"Habanah!" he said simply, using the all-embracing native negative.</p>

  <p>"Isn't any one in there?" we demanded all together.</p>

  <p>"Surely."</p>

  <p>"How many?"</p>

  <p>"Very many."</p>

  <p>"Officers?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Is a doctor there?"</p>

  <p>He told us he had asked for the doctor. A soldier had pointed him out. He
  had placed the note in the doctor's hand.</p>

  <p>"Did he read it?" we asked.</p>

  <p>"Surely. He read it, and then showed it to the other officers."</p>

  <p>"What did they say?"</p>

  <p>"They laughed and said nothing."</p>

  <p>It seemed pretty obvious that Kazimoto had made a mistake in some way.
  Perhaps he had visited the non-commissioned officers' mess.</p>

  <p>I'll go myself," announced Will. "I can sling the German language like a
  barkeep. Bet you I'm back here with a doctor inside of three minutes!"</p>

  <p>He strode off like Sir Galahad in football shorts, and was passed through
  the gate by the sentry almost unchallenged. But he was gone more than fifteen
  minutes, and came back at last with his ears crimson. Nor would he answer our
  questions.</p>

  <p>"Shall I go?" suggested Fred.</p>

  <p>"Not unless you like insolence! We passed the camping-ground, it seems, on
  our way in. We've leave to pitch tents there. We'd better be moving."</p>

  <p>So we trailed back the way we had come to a triangular sandy space
  enclosed by a cactus hedge at the junction of three roads. There were several
  small grass-roofed shelters with open sides in there, and two tents already
  pitched, but we were not sufficiently interested just then to see who owned
  the other tents. We pitched our own&mdash;stowed the loads in one of the
  shelters&mdash;gave our porters money for board and rations&mdash;and sent
  them to find quarters in the town. Another of the shelters we took over for a
  kitchen, and while our servants were cooking a meal we four gathered in
  Fred's tent and began to question Will again.</p>

  <p>"They've got a fine place in there," he said. "Neat as a new pin.
  Officers' mess. Non-commissioned officers' quarters. Stores. Vegetable
  garden. Jail&mdash;looks like a fine jail&mdash;hold a couple of hundred.
  Government offices. Two-story buildings. Everything fine. The officers were
  all sitting smoking on a veranda.</p>

  <p>"'Is one of you the doctor?' I asked in German, and a tall lean one with a
  mighty mean face turned his head to squint at me: but he didn't take his feet
  off the rail. He looked inquisitive, that's all.</p>

  <p>"'Are you the doctor?' I asked him.</p>

  <p>"'I am staff surgeon,' he answered. 'What do you want?'</p>

  <p>"I told him about your wound, and how we'd marched about two hundred miles
  on purpose to get medical assistance. He listened without asking a question,
  and when I'd done he said curtly that the hospital opens for out-patients at
  eight in the morning.</p>

  <p>"Well, I piled it on then. I told him your leg was so rotten that you
  might not be alive to-morrow morning. He didn't even look interested. I piled
  it on thicker and told him about the poisoned spear. He didn't bat an eyelid
  or make a move. So I started in to coax him.</p>

  <p>"I did some coaxing. Believe me, I swallowed more pride in five minutes
  than I guessed I owned! A ward-heeler cadging votes for a Milwaukee alderman
  never wheedled more gingerly. I called him 'Herr Staff Surgeon' and mentioned
  the well-known skill of German medicos, and the keen sense of duty of the
  German army, and a whole lot of other stuff.</p>

  <p>"'Tomorrow morning at eight!' was all the answer I got from him.</p>

  <p>"I reckon it was somewhere about that time I began to get rattled. I
  pulled out money and showed it. He looked the other way, and when I went on
  talking he turned his back. I suspect he didn't dare keep on lookin' at money
  almost within reach. Anyhow, then I opened on him, firin' both bow guns. I
  dared him to sit there, with a patient in need of prompt attention less than
  two hundred yards away. I called him names. I guaranteed to write to the
  German government and the United States papers about him. I told him I'd have
  his job if it cost me all my money and a lifetime's trouble. He was just
  about ready to shoot&mdash;I'd just about got the red blood rising on his
  neck and ears&mdash;when along came the commandant&mdash;<i>der Herr
  Kapitän</i>&mdash;the officer commanding Muanza&mdash;a swag-bellied ruffian
  with a beard and a beery look in his eye, but a voice like a man falling down
  three stories with all the fire-irons.</p>

  <p>"'What do you want?' he demanded in English, and I thanked him first for
  not having mistaken me for one of his own countrymen. Then I told him what
  I'd come for.</p>

  <p>"'To-morrow at eight o'clock!' he snapped, after he'd had a word with the
  medico. 'Meanwhile, make yourself scarce out of here! There is a
  camping-ground for the use of foreigners. You and your party go to it! If you
  do any damage there you will hear from me later!'</p>

  <p>"I didn't come as easy as all that. I stood there telling him things about
  Germany and Germans, and what I'd do to help his personal reputation with the
  home folks, until I guessed he had his craw as near full as he could stand it
  without having me arrested. Then I did come&mdash;whistling Yankee-doodle.
  And say&mdash;Fred! Where's that concertina of yours?"</p>

  <p>Fred patted it. His beloved instrument was never far from hand.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you play all the American and English tunes you know to-night?
  Play and sing 'em, 'Britannia Rules the Waves'&mdash;'Marching Through
  Georgia'&mdash;'My Country 'Tis of Thee'&mdash;'The Marseillaise'&mdash; 'The
  Battle Hymn of the Republic'&mdash;and anything and everything you know that
  Squareheads won't like. Let's make this camp a reg'lar&mdash; hello&mdash;see
  who's here!"</p>

  <p>Fred had begun fingering the keys already and the first strains of
  Marching Through Georgia began to awake the neighborhood to recognition of
  the fact that foreigners were present who held no especial brief for German
  rule. The tent-door darkened. Brown leapt to his feet and swore.</p>

  <p>"Gassharamminy!" said a voice we all recognized instantly. "That tune
  sounds good! I've lived in the States! I'm a United States citizen! A man
  can't forget his own country's tunes so easily!"</p>

  <p>Cool and impudent, Georges Coutlass entered and, without waiting for an
  invitation, took a seat on a load of canned food. Brown grabbed the nearest
  rifle (it happened to be Fred's)&mdash;snapped open the breach&mdash;
  discovered it was loaded&mdash;and took aim. Coutlass did not even blink. He
  was either sure Fred and Will would interfere, or else at the end of his
  tether and indifferent to death.</p>

  <p>"Don't be an ass, Brown!"</p>

  <p>Fred knocked the rifle up. Will took it away and returned it to the
  corner.</p>

  <p>"All very easy for you men to take high moral ground and all that sort of
  rot," Brown grumbled. "It's my cattle he took! It's me be's ruined! What do I
  care if the Germans hang me? Let me have a crack at him&mdash;just one!"</p>

  <p>"Use your fists all you care to!" grinned Will.</p>

  <p>But Brown was no match for the Greek without weapons&mdash;very likely no
  match for him with them. Coutlass sat still and grinned, while Brown remained
  in the back of the tent, glaring.</p>

  <p>"Bah!" sneered Coutlass. "Of what use is being sulky? I found cattle in a
  village. How should I know whose cattle they were? Why blame me? The Masai
  got the cattle, not I! They took them from me, and they'd have taken them
  from you just the same! You lost nothing by my lifting them first!
  Gassharamminy! By blazes! We're all in the same boat! Let's be friendly, and
  treat one another like gentlemen! We're all in the power of the Germans,
  unless we can think of a way to escape! I and my party are under arrest. So
  will you be by to-morrow! I shall tell a tale to-morrow that will keep you by
  the heels for a month at least while they investigate! Wait and see!"</p>

  <p>"Get out of this tent!" growled Fred in the dead-level voice he uses when
  he means to brook no refusal.</p>

  <p>"Presently!"</p>

  <p>Fred made a spring at him, but Coutlass was on his feet with the speed of
  a cat, and just outside the tent in time to avoid the swing of Fred's fist.
  He withdrew about two yards and stood there grinning maliciously.</p>

  <p>"You'll be glad to make terms with me by this time to-morrow!" he boasted.
  "By James, you'll be glad to have me for a friend! Listen, you fools! Make
  terms with me now; let us all go together and unearth that Tippoo Tib ivory,
  and I can arrange with these Germans to let us go away! Otherwise, you shall
  see how long you stop here! By the Twelve Apostles! You shall rot in a German
  jail until your joints creak!"</p>

  <p>His Greek friend and the Goanese, supposing him in trouble perhaps, came
  and stood in line with him. Very comfortless they looked, and of the three
  only Coutlass had courage of a kind.</p>

  <p>"They stole the cattle on the British side of the border," Will said sotto
  voice. "No earthly use threatening them with German law."</p>

  <p>"Keep away from our camp," Fred Ordered them, "or take the consequences!
  Mr. Brown here is in no mood for pleasantries!"</p>

  <p>"That drunkard Brown?" roared Coutlass. "He is in no mood for&mdash;oh,
  haw-hah-hee-ho-ha-ha-ha-ha! Drunkard Brown of Lumbwa wants to avenge himself,
  and his friends won't let him! Oh, isn't that a joke! Oh,
  ha-ha-ha-hee-hee-ha-ho-ho!"</p>

  <p>His two companions made a trio of it, yelling with stage laughter like
  disgusting animals. Fred took a short quick step forward. Will followed, and
  Brown reached for the rifle again. But I stopped all three of them.</p>

  <p>"Come back! Don't let's be fools!" I insisted. "I never saw a more obvious
  effort to start trouble in my life! It's a trap! Keep out of it!"</p>

  <p>"Sure enough," Will admitted. "You're right!"</p>

  <p>He returned into the tent and the Greeks, perhaps supposing he went for
  weapons, retreated, continuing to shout abuse at Brown who, between a
  yearning to get drunk and sorrow for his stolen cattle, was growing
  tearful.</p>

  <p>"They got here first," I argued. "They've had time to tell their own
  story. That may account for our cold reception by the Germans. He says
  they're under arrest. That may be true, or it may be a trick. It's perfectly
  obvious Coutlass wanted to start a fight, and I'm dead sure he wasn't taking
  such a chance as it seemed. Who wants to look behind the cactus hedge and see
  whether he has friends in ambush?"</p>

  <p>"Drunkard Brown is on the town&mdash;on the town&mdash;on the town!"
  roared Coutlass and his friends from not very far away.</p>

  <p>"Oh, let me go and have a crack at 'em!" begged Brown. "I tell you I don't
  care about jail! I don't care if I do get killed!"</p>

  <p>Fred kept a restraining hand on him. Will left the tent and walked
  straight for the gap in the cactus hedge by which we had entered the
  enclosure. It was only twenty yards away.</p>

  <p>Once through the gap he glanced swiftly to right and left&mdash;laughed
  &mdash;and came back again.</p>

  <p>"Only six of 'em!" he grinned. "Six full-sized Nubians in uniform, with
  army boots on, no bayonets or rifles, but good big sticks and handcuffs! If
  we'd touched those Greeks they'd have jumped the fence and stretched us out!
  What the devil d'you suppose they want us in jail for?"</p>

  <p>"D'you suppose they think," I said, "that if they had us in jail in this
  God-forsaken place we'd divulge the secret of Tippoo's ivory?"</p>

  <p>"Why don't we tell 'em the secret!" suggested Will, and that seemed such a
  good idea that we laughed ourselves back into good temper&mdash;even Brown,
  who had no notion whether we knew the secret, being perfectly sure we would
  not be such fools as to tell the true whereabouts of the hoard in any
  case.</p>

  <p>"I want to get even with all Africa!" he grumbled. "I want to make trouble
  that'll last! I'd start a war this minute if I knew how! If it weren't for
  those bloody Greeks laughing at me I'd get more drunk to-night than any ten
  men in the world ever were before in history! Yes, sir! And my name's Brown
  of Lumbwa to prove I mean what I say!"</p>

  <p>After a while, seeing that no trouble was likely, the Nubian soldiers came
  out of ambush and marched away. We ate supper. The Greeks and the Goanese
  subsided into temporary quiet, and our own boys, squatting by a fire they had
  placed so that they could watch the Greeks' encampment, began bumming a
  native song. Their song reminded Fred of Will's earlier suggestion, and he
  unclasped the concertina.</p>

  <p>Then for three-quarters of an hour he played, and we sang all the tunes we
  knew least likely to make Germans happy, repeating "The Marseillaise" and
  "Rule Britannia" again and again in pious hope that at least a few bars might
  reach to the commandant's house on the hill.</p>

  <p>Whether they did or not&mdash;whether the commandant writhed as we hoped
  in the torture of supreme insult, or slept as was likely from the after-
  effect of too much bottled beer with dinner&mdash;there were others who
  certainly did hear, and made no secret of it.</p>

  <p>To begin with, the part of the township nearest us was the quarter of
  round grass roofs, where the aborigines lived; and the Bantu heart responds
  to tuneful noise, as readily as powder to the match. All that section of
  Muanza, man, woman and child, came and squatted outside the cactus hedge. (It
  was <i>streng polizeilich verboten</i>* for natives to enter the European
  camping-ground, so that except when they wanted to steal they absolutely
  never trespassed past the hedge.)</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>streng polizeilich verboten</i> (German) strictly
  forbidden by order of the police. ]</p>

  <p>Enraptured by the unaccustomed strains they sat quite still until some
  Swahili and Arabs came and beat them to make room. When the struggle and hot
  argument that followed that had died down, Indians began coming, and other
  Greeks, until most of the inhabitants of the eastern side of town were either
  squatting or standing or pacing to and fro outside the camping-ground.</p>

  <p>At last rumor of what was happening reached the D.O.A.G.&mdash;the store
  at the corner of the drill-ground, where it seemed the non-commissioned
  officers took their pleasure of an evening. Pleasure, except as laid down in
  regulations, is not permitted in German colonies to any except white folk. No
  less than eight German sergeants and a sergeant-major, all the worse for
  liquor, turned out as if to a fire and came down street at a double.</p>

  <p>They had kibokos in their hands. The first we heard of their approach was
  the crack-crack-crack of the black whips falling on naked or thin-cotton-clad
  backs and shoulders. There was no yelling (it was not allowed after dark on
  German soil, at least by natives) but a sudden pattering in the dust as a
  thousand feet hurried away. Then, in the glow of our lamplight, came the
  sergeant-major standing spraddle-legged in front of us.</p>

  <p>He was a man of medium height, in clean white uniform. The first thing I
  noticed about him was the high cheek-bones and murderous blue eyes, like a
  pig's. His general build was heavy. The fair mustache made no attempt to
  conceal fat lips that curled cruelly. His general air was that most offensive
  one to decent folk, of the bully who would ingratiate by seeming a good
  fellow.</p>

  <p><i>"'n Abend, meine Herren!"</i> he said aggressively, with a smile more
  than half made up of contempt for courtesy. <i>"Ich heisse Schubert&mdash;
  Feldwebel Hans Schubert."</i>*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Good evening, gentlemen. My name is Schubert&mdash;
  Sergeant Hans Schubert.]</p>

  <p><i>"Was wollen Sie?"*</i> Will asked. He was the only one of us who knew
  German well.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* What do you want?]</p>

  <p>But Schubert, it seemed, knew English and was glad to show it off.</p>

  <p>"You make fine music! Ach! Up at the D.O.A.G. very near here we
  <i>Unteroffiziere</i>* spend the evening, all very fond of singing, yet
  without music at all. Will you not come and play with us?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[*<i>Unteroffiziere</i> (German)&mdash;non- commissioned
  officers.]</p>

  <p>"I only know French and English tunes!" lied Fred.</p>

  <p>"Ach! I do not believe it! Kommen Sie! There is beer at the D.O.A.G.
  &mdash;champagne&mdash;brandy&mdash;whisky&mdash;rum&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going, then, for one!" announced Brown, getting up immediately.</p>

  <p>"Cigars&mdash;cigarettes&mdash;tobacco," the sergeant-major continued.
  "There is no closing time." He saw that the line of argument was not
  tempting, and changed his tactics. "Listen! You gentlemen have not too many
  friends in Muanza! I speak in friendship. I invite you on behalf of myself
  and other <i>Unteroffiziere</i> to spend <i>gemütlich</i> evening with us.
  That can do you no harm! In the course of friendly conversation much can be
  learned that official lips would not tell!</p>

  <p><i>"Kommen Sie nun!"*</i></p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Come on then!]</p>

  <p>"Let's go!" I said. "My leg hurts like hell. If I stay here I can't sleep.
  Anything to keep from thinking about it! Besides, some one must go and look
  after Brown!"</p>

  <p>"Who'll watch those Greeks?" Fred demanded. "They'd as soon steal as
  eat!"</p>

  <p>"We'd better all stay here together," said Will, "and take turns keeping
  watch till morning." He said it with a straight face, but I did not think he
  was in earnest.</p>

  <p>"Ach!" exclaimed Schubert. "That is all <i>ganz einfach!</i>* You shall
  have askaris!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* really easy]</p>

  <p>He turned and shouted an order. A non-commissioned officer went running
  back up-street.</p>

  <p>"You shall have three askaris to guard your camp. So nothing whatever
  shall be stolen! Then come along and make music&mdash;<i>seien Sie gemütlich!
  Ja?</i>"*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Take it easy! Okay?]</p>

  <p>Brown had already gone, jingling money in his pocket. We waited until the
  Nubian soldiers came&mdash;saw them posted&mdash;and then walked up-street
  behind the sergeants, Schubert leading us all, and I limping between Fred and
  Will. They as good as carried me the last half of the way.</p>

  <p>The sergeants marched with the air peculiar to military Germans, of men
  who are going to be amused. They said nothing&mdash;did not smile&mdash; but
  strode straight forward, three abreast, swinging their kibokos with a sort of
  elephantine sporty air. They were men of all heights and thicknesses, but
  each alike impressed me with the Prussian military mold that leaves a man no
  imagination of his own, and no virtue, but only an animal respect for
  whatever can make to suffer, or appease an appetite.</p>

  <p>The D.O.A.G. proved a mournful enough lounging place in which to spend
  convivial evenings. However, it seemed that when the sergeant-major had
  decreed amusement the non-commissioned officers' mess overlooked all trifles
  in brave determination to obey. They marched in, humming tunes (each a
  different one, and nearly all high tenor) and took seats in a room at the
  rear of the building with their backs against a mud-brick wall that was shiny
  from much rubbing by drill tunics.</p>

  <p>Down the center was a narrow table, loaded with drinks of all sorts. A
  case of bottled beer occupied the place of pride at one end; as Schubert had
  boasted, nothing was lacking that East Africa could show in the way of
  imported alcohol. Under the table was an unopened case of sweet German
  champagne, and on a little table against one wall were such things as
  absinthe, chartreuse, peppermint, and benedictine. Soda-water was slung
  outside the window in a basket full of wet grass where the evening breeze
  would keep it cool.</p>

  <p>"Now for <i>Gesang</i>!" shouted Schubert, knocking the neck off a bottle
  of beer, and beginning to sing like a drunken pirate.</p>

  <p>A man whom he introduced as "a genuine Jew from Jerusalem" came out from a
  gloomy recess filled with tusks and sacks of dried red pepper, and watched
  everything from now on with an eye like a gimlet, writing down in a book
  against each sergeant's name whatever he took to drink. They appeared to have
  no check on him. Nobody signed anything. Nobody as much as glanced at his
  account.</p>

  <p>"What is the use?" said Schubert, noticing my glance and interpreting the
  unspoken question. "There is just so much drink in the whole place. We shall
  drink every drop of it! All that matters is, who is to pay for the champagne?
  That stuff is costly."</p>

  <p>They all took beer to begin with, knocking the necks from the bottles as
  if that act alone lent the necessary air of deviltry to the whole
  proceedings. A small, very black Nyamwesi came with brush and pan and groped
  on the floor all night for the splinters of glass, sleeping between times in
  a corner until a fresh volley of breaking bottle necks awoke him to work
  again.</p>

  <p><i>"Die Wacht am Rhein!"</i>* yelled Schubert. "Start it up! Sing that
  first!" He began to sing it himself, all out of tune.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Die Wacht am Rhein</i> (German)&mdash;The Watch on
  the Rhine. A German patriotic anthem which was particularly popular during
  the First World War. The poem was written in 1840 by the Swabian merchant Max
  Schneckenburger amid German fears that France was planning to annex the left
  bank of the Rhine River. The text calls for Germans to defend the Rhine
  against unspecified enemies. It was later set to music in 1854 by the musical
  director of the city of Krefeld, Karl Wilhelm. The repeated refrain is "Lieb'
  Vaterland, magst ruhig sein, Fest steht und treu die Wacht am Rhein!"
  (Beloved land of our fathers, have no fear, Fast and true stands the watch on
  the Rhine).</p>

  <p>Fred cut the noise short by standing up to play something nobody could
  sing to a jangling clamor of chords and runs on which he prides himself, that
  he swears is classical, but of which neither he nor anybody knows the name.
  Then he drank some beer and sang a comic song or two in English, we joining
  in the choruses.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Brown was soaking away steadily, taking whatever drink came
  first to hand, and having no interest whatever in anything but the task of
  assuaging the thirst he had accumulated in the course of all that long
  marching since he left home. He had forgotten his cattle already&mdash;the
  Greeks who stole them&mdash;the Masai who stole from the Greeks. He paid for
  all he took, to the Jew's extreme surprise and satisfaction, and grumbled at
  the price of everything, to the Jew's supremest unconcern.</p>

  <p>"An' my name's Brown o' Lumbwa, just in proof of all I say!" he informed
  the room at large at intervals.</p>

  <p>When Will had exhausted all the American songs he knew, and Fred had run
  through his own long list there was nothing left for it but to make up
  accompaniments to the songs the sergeants had been raised on. Fred made the
  happy discovery that none of them knew The Marseillaise, so he played that as
  an antidote each time after they had made the hard-wood rafters ring and the
  smoke-filled air vibrate with Teutonic jingoism. The Jew, who probably knew
  more than he cared to admit, grew more and more beady-eyed each time The
  Marseillaise was played.</p>

  <p>There was a pause in the proceedings at about ten o'clock, by which time
  all the sergeants except Schubert were sufficiently drunk to feel thoroughly
  at ease. Schubert was cold-eyed sober, although scarcely any longer
  thirsty.</p>

  <p>A native was brought in by two askaris and charged before Schubert with
  hanging about the boma gate after dark. He was asked the reason. The Jew,
  sitting beside me with his book of names and charges, poured cool water over
  my bandages and translated to me what they all said. He spoke English very
  well indeed, but in such low tones that I could scarcely catch the words,
  drawing in his breath and not moving his lips at all.</p>

  <p>The native explained that he had waited to see the bwana makubwa&mdash;
  the commandant. He had nowhere to go and no money with which to pay for
  lodging, so he proposed to wait outside the gate and watch for the coming of
  the commandant next morning. He would intercept him on his way down from the
  white house on the hill.</p>

  <p>He was asked why. To beg a favor. What favor? Satisfaction. For what? For
  his daughter. He was the father of the girl whom the commandant had favored
  with attentions. She had been a virgin. Now she was to have a child. It would
  be a half-black, half-white child. Who would now marry a woman with such a
  child as that? Yet nothing bad been given her. She had been simply sent back
  home to be a charge on her parents and an already poverty-stricken village.
  Therefore he had come to ask that justice be done, and the girl be given at
  least a present of money.</p>

  <p>The sergeants roared with laughter, all except Schubert, who seemed only
  appalled by the impudence of the request. He sat back and ordered the story
  repeated.</p>

  <p>"And you dare ask for money from the bwana makubwa!" he demanded. "You dog
  of a Nyamwesi! Is the honor not sufficient that your black brute of a
  daughter should have a baby by such a great person? You cattle have no sense
  of honor! You must learn! Put him down! Beat him till I say stop!"</p>

  <p>There was no need to put him down, however. The motion of the hand, voice
  inflection, order were all too well understood. The man lay face-downward on
  the floor without so much as a murmur of objection, and buried his face in
  both hands. The askaris promptly stripped him of the thin cotton loin-cloth
  that constituted his only garment, tearing it in pieces as they dragged it
  from him.</p>

  <p>"Go on!" ordered Schubert. "Beat him!"</p>

  <p>Both the askaris had kibokos. The longest of the two was split at the
  nether end into four fingers. The shortest was more than a yard long,
  tapering from an inch and a half where the man's fist gripped it to half an
  inch thick at the tip. They stood one each side of their victim and brought
  the whips down on his naked skin alternately.</p>

  <p>"Slowly!" ordered Schubert. "Slowly, and with all your strength! The brute
  doesn't feel it when you beat so fast! Let him wait for the blow! Don't let
  him know when it's coming! So&mdash;so is better!"</p>

  <p>Not every blow drew blood, for a native's skin is thick and tough,
  especially where he sits. But the blows that fell on the back and thighs all
  cut the skin, and within two minutes the native's back was a bloody mass, and
  there was blood running on the floor, and splashes of blood on the
  whitewashed wall cast by the whips as they ascended.</p>

  <p>I made up my mind the man was going to be killed, for Schubert gave no
  order and the askaris did not dare stop without one. The victim writhed, but
  did not cry out, and the writhing grew less. Even Brown sobered up for a time
  at the sight of it. He came and sat between me and the Jew.</p>

  <p>"It's a shame!" he grumbled. "Up in our country twenty-five lashes is the
  masshimum, an' only to be laid on in the presence of a massishtrate. You beat
  a black man an' they'll fine you first offense, jail you second offense, an'
  third offense God knows what they'll do! Poor ole Brown o' Lumbwa! They fined
  me once a'ready. Nessht time they'll put me in jail! Better get quite drunk
  an' be blowed to it!"</p>

  <p>He staggered back to his chair by the farther wall, leering at Schubert as
  he passed.</p>

  <p>"You're no gentleman!" he asserted aggressively. "You're no better 'n a
  black man yourself! You ought-to-be-on-floor 'stead o' him! Dunno-how-behave-
  yourself! Take your coat off, an' come outside, an' fight like a man!"</p>

  <p>Schubert gave the order to stop at last. The askaris stood aside, panting
  from the effort.</p>

  <p>"Get up!" ordered Schubert.</p>

  <p>The miserable Nyamwesi struggled to his feet and stood limply before
  Schubert, his back running blood and his face drawn with torture.</p>

  <p>"Don't you know how to behave!" demanded Schubert.</p>

  <p>The native made no answer.</p>

  <p>"If you don't salute properly I'll order you thrown down and thrashed
  again!"</p>

  <p>The native saluted in a sort of imitation of the German military
  manner.</p>

  <p>"Now, will you lie in wait for the bwana makubwa to trouble him with your
  pig's affairs again?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Will you go back home?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You've learned a lesson, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes.</p>

  <p>"Then say thank you!"</p>

  <p>"Thank you!"</p>

  <p>"Rrruksa!"*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>ruksa</i>&mdash;You have leave to go. Author's

  <p>The poor wretch turned and went, staggering rather than walking, to the
  door and disappearing into outer darkness without a backward glance.</p>

  <p>"Now for some more songs and a round of drinks!" Schubert shouted.</p>

  <p>But Fred was no longer in mood to make music, or even to be civil. He shut
  the concertina up, and asked the Jew how much he owed. The sergeants went on
  singing without music, and while we waited for the Jew to reckon up Fred's
  score Schubert came over to us, sat down between me and Fred, and proceeded
  to deal with the new situation in proper German military manner, by direct
  assault.</p>

  <p>"Always you English criticize!" he began. "Can you never travel without
  applying your cursed standards to everything you behold? I tell you, we
  Germans know how to rule these black people! We understand! We employ no
  sickly sentiment! We give orders&mdash;they obey, or else suffer terribly and
  swiftly! In that manner we arrive at knowing where we are!"</p>

  <p>"Are you well loved by the people?" Fred asked him politely.</p>

  <p>"Bah! <i>Sie wollen wohl beliebt werden!</i>* Not I! Not we! Of what value
  is the love of such people? Their fear is what we cultivate! Having made them
  afraid of us, we successfully make them work our will! But why should I
  trouble to explain? In a few years there will only be one government of
  Africa! One, I tell you, and that German! You English are not fit to govern
  colonies! You are mawkishly sentimental! You think more of the feelings of a
  black man and of the rights of his women than of progress&mdash;advancement
  &mdash;<i>Kultur!</i> Bah! I tell you they have no feelings a real man need
  consider! They are only fit for furthering the aims of us Germans! And their
  women have no rights! None whatever! You know, I suppose, that it is the
  policy of the German government to encourage the spread of Mohammedanism in
  Africa? Well, under the Mohammedan law as given in the Koran women have no
  souls! That is good! That is as it should be! No women have souls!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Sie wollen wohl beliebt werden!</i> (German)
  &mdash;You want to be popular, don't you!]</p>

  <p>"How about your own mother?" Fred suggested.</p>

  <p>"She was a good Prussian! She was a super-woman! Not to be mentioned in
  the same breath with women of any other race! Yet even she&mdash;the good
  Prussian mother&mdash;could not hold a candle to a man! Her business was to
  raise sons for Prussia, and she did it! I have eight brothers, all in the
  army, and only one sister; she has four sons already!"</p>

  <p>"Strange that your nation should breed like that!" said Fred.</p>

  <p>"Not strange at all!" answered Schubert. "We are needed to conquer the
  world! Think, for instance, when we have conquered the Congo Free State, and
  taken away East and South Africa from England&mdash;to say nothing of Egypt
  and India!&mdash;how many Prussian sergeant-majors we shall want!
  <i>Donnerwetter!</i> Do you think we Germans will long be satisfied with this
  miserable section of East Africa that was all the English left to us on this
  coast? We use this for a foothold, that is all! We use this to gain time and
  get ready! You think perhaps I do not know, eh? I am only <i>Feldwebel</i>
  &mdash;non-commissioned officer, you call it. Well and good. I tell you our
  officers talk all the time of nothing else! And they don't care who hears
  them!"</p>

  <p>The Jew gave Fred his bill, scrawled on a piece of wrapping paper.
  Schubert snatched it away and crumpled it into a ball.</p>

  <p>"<i>Kreuzblitze</i>!* You are my guests to-night! I invited you!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Kreuzblitze!</i> (German)&mdash;an antiquated
  German expletive; literally "crossed" or "forked" lighting. See <i><a href=

  <p>"Thanks" Fred answered, "but we don't care to be your guests. Here," he
  said, turning to the Jew, "take your, money!"</p>

  <p>Schubert said nothing, but eyed the Jew with a perfectly blank face, as if
  he watched to see whether the man would damn himself or not.</p>

  <p>"Take your money!" repeated Fred. But the Jew turned his back and busied
  himself with bottles at the side-table.</p>

  <p>"He knows better!" Schubert laughed. "He understands by this time our
  German hospitality!"</p>

  <p>"All right," answered Fred. "We'll go out without paying!"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," retorted Schubert. "The mess shall pay bill in full! You
  stay here until I have said what I have to say to you! The rest of your party
  may go, but you stay! You can explain to the others afterward."</p>

  <p>He leaned forward, reached a bottle of beer off the table, knocked off the
  neck, and emptied the contents down his throat at a draught. Behind his back
  we exchanged glances.</p>

  <p>"I'll listen," said Fred.</p>

  <p>"You alone?"</p>

  <p>"No, we all stay. All or none!"</p>

  <p>Schubert made a contemptuous gesture with his thumb toward Brown, who had
  fallen dead drunk on the floor.</p>

  <p>"Will that one stay, too?"</p>

  <p>"He is not of our party really," Fred answered. "He knows nothing of our
  affairs."</p>

  <p>"You men are in trouble&mdash;worse trouble than you guess!"</p>

  <p>Schubert looked with his cruel blue eyes into each of ours in turn, then
  stared straight in front of him and waited.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it," Fred answered. "We have done nothing to merit
  trouble."</p>

  <p>"Merit in this world is another name for chance!" said Schubert.</p>

  <p>"What are we supposed to have done?" demanded Fred.</p>

  <p>Schubert at once assumed what was intended to be a sly look, of
  uncommunicable knowledge.</p>

  <p>"None of my business to tell what my officers know," he answered. "As for
  that, time will no doubt disclose much. The point is&mdash;trouble can be
  forestalled."</p>

  <p>"Aw&mdash;show your hand!" cut in Will, leaning in front of Fred. "I've
  seen you Heinies fishing for graft too often in the States not to recognize
  symptoms! Spill the bait can! There's no other way to tell if we'll bite!
  Tell us what you're driving at!"</p>

  <p>"Ivory!" said Schubert savagely and simply, shutting his jaws after the
  word like a snap with a steel spring. It would have broken the teeth of an
  ordinary human.</p>

  <p>"What ivory?"</p>

  <p>We all did our best to look blank.</p>

  <p>"You know! Tippoo Tib's ivory! It belongs to the German government! Emin
  Pasha, whom that adventurer Stanley rescued against his will, agreed to sell
  the secret to us, but we never agreed on a price and he died without telling.
  Gott! He would have told had I had the interviewing of him! It was known in
  Zanzibar that you and a certain English lord shared the secret. You have been
  watched. You are known to be in search of the stuff."</p>

  <p>"The deuce you say!" Fred murmured, with a glance to left and right at
  us.</p>

  <p>"If you were to go to the office to-morrow, and tell our commandant what
  you know," said Schubert, "you might be suitably compensated. You would
  certainly be given facilities for leaving the country in comfort at your
  leisure."</p>

  <p>"Who told you to promise us that?" Fred demanded, turning on him.</p>

  <p>The <i>Feldwebel</i> did not answer, but sat with his legs straight out in
  front of him, his heels together, and the palms of his hands touching between
  his knees. The sergeants were all singing, smoking and drinking. The Jew was
  back at his old post, watching every one with gimlet eyes.</p>

  <p>"Think it over!" said Schubert, getting up. "There is time until morning.
  There is time until you leave this building. After that&mdash;" He shrugged
  his square shoulders brutally.</p>

  <p>There was no sense in going out at once, as we had intended, with that
  combination of threat and promise hanging over us.</p>

  <p>"Why not do what we said&mdash;admit that we know what we don't know
  &mdash;and put 'em on the wrong scent?" Will whispered.</p>

  <p>"I wish to God Monty were here!" groaned Fred.</p>

  <p>"Rot!" Will answered. "Monty is all you ever said of him and then some;
  but we're able to handle this ourselves all right without him. Tell 'em a
  bull yarn, I say!"</p>

  <p>Fred relapsed into a sort of black gloom intended to attract the Muse of
  Strategy. He was always better at swift action in the open and optimism in
  the face of visible danger, than at matching wits against something he could
  not see beginning or end of.</p>

  <p>"Tell 'em it's in German East!" urged Will. "Offer to lead them to it on
  certain conditions. Think up controversial proposals! Play for timer!"</p>

  <p>Fred shook his head.</p>

  <p>"What if it turns out true? Monty's in Europe. Suppose he should learn
  while he's there that the stuff is really in German East&mdash;we'd have
  spoiled his game!"</p>

  <p>"If the stuff should really be in German East," Will argued, "we've no
  chance in the world of getting even a broker's share of it, Monty or no
  Monty! Take my advice and tell 'em what they want to know!"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile an argument of another kind had started across the room.
  Schubert had related with grim amusement to Sergeant Sachse, who was sitting
  next him, our disapproval of the flogging of the father of the commandant's
  abandoned woman.</p>

  <p>"At what were they shocked?" wondered Sachse. "At the flogging, or the
  intercourse, or because he sent the female packing when she proposed to have
  a child? Do they not know that to have children about the premises would be
  subversive of military excellence?"</p>

  <p>"They were shocked at all three things," grinned Schubert, "but chiefly, I
  think, at the flogging."</p>

  <p>"Bah! Such a tickling of a native's hide doesn't hurt him to speak of!
  Wait until they see our court in the morning!"</p>

  <p>It was that that raised the clamor. Even Schubert, who might be supposed
  to have won promotion because he could stay sober longer than the others, was
  beginning to grow noisy in his speech and to laugh without apparent reason.
  The rest were all already frankly drunk, and any excuse for dispute was a
  good one. They one and all, including Schubert, denied Sachse's contention
  that a flogging did not hurt enough to matter.</p>

  <p>"I bet I could take one without winking!" Sachse announced.</p>

  <p>Schubert's little bright pig-eyes gleamed through the smoke at that.</p>

  <p><i>"Kurz und gut!"</i>* he laughed. "There is a case of champagne
  unopened. I bet you that case of champagne that you lie! That you can not
  take a flogging!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Kurz und gut</i> (German&mdash;To keep a long story
  short.]</p>

  <p>There was an united yelp of delight. The sergeants rose and gathered round
  Sachse. Schubert cursed them and drove them to the chairs again.</p>

  <p>"Open that case of champagne!" he roared, and the Jew obeyed, setting the
  bottles on the table in two rows.</p>

  <p>"I bet you those twelve bottles you dare not take a regular flogging, and
  that you can not endure it if you dare try!"</p>

  <p>"I can stand as much as you!" hedged Sachse.</p>

  <p>"Good! We will see! We will both take a flogging&mdash;stroke for stroke!
  Whoever squeals first shall pay for the champagne!"</p>

  <p>Sachse could not back out. His cheeks grew whiter, but be staggered to his
  feet, swearing.</p>

  <p>"I will show you of what material a German sergeant is made!" he boasted.
  "It is not only Prussians who are men of metal! How shall it be
  arranged?"</p>

  <p>The arrangement was easy enough. Schubert shouted for an askari, and the
  corporal who was doing police duty outside in the street came running. He had
  a kiboko in his hand almost a yard and a half long, and Schubert examined it
  with approval.</p>

  <p>"How would you like to flog white men?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I would not dare!" grinned the corporal.</p>

  <p>"Not dare, eh? Would you not obey an order?"</p>

  <p>"Always I obey!" the man answered, saluting.</p>

  <p>"Good. I shall lie here. This other bwana shall lie there beside me. You
  shall stand between. First you shall strike one, then the other&mdash;turn
  and turn about until I give the order to cease! And listen! If you fail once
  &mdash;just one little time!&mdash;to flog with all your might, you shall
  have two hundred lashes yourself; and they shall be good ones, because I will
  lay them on! Is it understood?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the corporal, the whites of his eyes betraying doubt, fear and
  wonder. But he grinned with his lips, lest the Feldwebel should suspect him
  of unwillingness.</p>

  <p>"Are the terms understood?" demanded Schubert, and the sergeants yelped in
  the affirmative.</p>

  <p>"Then choose a referee!"</p>

  <p>One of the sergeants volunteered for the post. Schubert lay down on the
  floor, and Sachse beside him about four feet away. The corporal took his
  stand between. He was an enormous Nubian, broad of chest, with the big
  sloping shoulder muscles that betray double the strength that tailors try to
  suggest with jackets padded to look square.</p>

  <p><i>"Nun&mdash;recht feste schlagen!"</i>* ordered Schubert. Then he took
  the sleeve of his tunic between his teeth and hid his face.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Nun&mdash;recht feste schlagen!</i> (German)
  &mdash;Now, hit good and hard!]</p>

  <p>"One!" said the referee. Down came the heavy black whip with a crack like
  a gun going off. Schubert neither winced nor murmured, but the blood welled
  into the seat of his pants and spread like red ink on blotting-paper.</p>

  <p>"'One!" said the referee again. The corporal faced about, and raised his
  weapon, standing on tiptoe to get more swing. Sachse flinched at the sound of
  the whip going up, and the other sergeants roared delight. But he was still
  when it descended, and the crack of the blow drew neither murmur nor movement
  from him either. Like the <i>Feldwebel</i>, he had his sleeve between his
  teeth.</p>

  <p>"Two!" said the referee, and the black whip rose again. It descended with
  a crack and a splash on the very spot whence the blood flowed, this time
  cutting the pants open, but Schubert took no more notice of it than if a fly
  had settled on him. There was a chorus of applause.</p>

  <p>"Two!" said the referee. Again the corporal faced about and balanced
  himself on tiptoe. Sachse was much the more nervous of the two. He flinched
  again while waiting for the blow, but met it when it did come without a
  tremor of any kind. He was much the softer. Blood flowed from him more
  freely, but his pants seemed to be of sterner stuff, for they did not split
  until the eight-and-twentieth lash, or thereabouts.</p>

  <p>From first to last, although the raw flesh lay open to the lash, and the
  corporal, urged to it by the united threats and praise of all the other
  sergeants, wrought his utmost, Schubert lay like a man asleep. He might have
  been dead, except for the even rise and fall of his breathing, that never
  checked or quickened once. Nine-and-forty strokes he took without a sign of
  yielding. At the eight-and-fortieth Sachse moaned a little, and the referee
  gave the match against him. Schubert rose to his feet unaided, grinning, red
  in the face, but without any tortured look.</p>

  <p>"Now you can say forever that you have flogged two white men!" he told the
  askari.</p>

  <p>"Who will believe me?" the man answered.</p>

  <p>Sachse had to be helped to his feet. He was pale and demanded brandy.</p>

  <p>"What did I tell you?" laughed Schubert. "A Prussian is better than any
  man! Look at him, and then at me!"</p>

  <p>He shouted for his servant, who had to be fetched from the boma&mdash;a
  smug-faced little rascal, obviously in love with the glory reflected on the
  sergeant-major's servant. He was made to produce a basin and cold water
  &mdash;he discovered them somewhere in the dim recesses of the store&mdash;
  and sponge his master's raw posterior before us all. Then he was sent for
  clean white pants and presently Schubert, only refusing to sit down, was
  quite himself again.</p>

  <p>Sachse on the other hand refused the ministrations of the boy&mdash;was
  annoyed by the chaff of the other sergeants&mdash;refused to drink any of the
  sweet champagne he would now have to pay for&mdash;and went away in great
  dudgeon, murmuring about the madness that takes hold of men in Africa.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, while Schubert strutted and swaggered, making jokes more raw
  and beastly than his own flogged hide, the Jew came and poured more cool
  water on my hot bandages, touching them with deft fingers that looked like
  the hairy legs of a huge spider&mdash;his touch more gentle&mdash;more
  fugitive than any woman's.</p>

  <p>"You should not tell zat dam <i>Feldwebel</i> nozink!" he advised in nasal
  English. "Nefer mind vat you tell heem he is all ze same not your frien. He
  only obey hees officers. Zey say to cut your troat&mdash;he cut it! Zey say
  to tell you a lot o' lies&mdash;he tell! He iss not a t'inker, but a doer:
  and hees faforite spectacle iss ze blood of innocence! Do not effer say I did
  not fell you! On ze ozzer hand, tell no one zat I did tell! Zese are
  dangerous people!"</p>

  <p>He resumed business with his account book, and I whispered to Fred and
  Will what advice he had given. Seeing us with our heads together, Schubert
  crossed the room, beginning to get very drunk now that the shock of the
  flogging had had time to reinforce the alcohol. (The blows had sobered him at
  first.)</p>

  <p>"What have you decided?" he asked, standing before us with his legs apart
  and his hands behind him in his favorite attitude&mdash;swaying gently back
  and forward because of the drink, and showing all his teeth in a grin.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," Fred answered. "We'll think it over."</p>

  <p>"Too late in the morning!" he answered, continuing to sway. "I can do
  nothing for you in the morning."</p>

  <p>"What can you do to-night?" Fred asked.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders. "I can report. The report will go in at
  dawn."</p>

  <p>"You may tell your superiors," Fred answered, rising, "that if they care
  to make us a reasonable offer, I don~t say we won't do business!"</p>

  <p>Schubert leered.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow will be too late!" he repeated.</p>

  <p>It was Fred's turn to shrug shoulders, and he did it inimitably, turning
  his back on Schubert and helping Will support me to the door. The
  <i>Feldwebel</i> stood grinning while I held to the doorpost and they dragged
  Brown to his feet. He made no offer to help us in any way at all, nor did any
  of the sergeants.</p>

  <p>There was no getting action from Brown. He was as dead to the world as a
  piece of wood, and there being no other obvious solution of the problem, Will
  hoisted him upon his back and carried him, he snoring, all the way home to
  camp. Fred hoisted and carried me, for the pain of my wound when I tried to
  walk was unbearable.</p>

  <p>We reached camp abreast and were challenged by the sentries, who made a
  great show of standing guard. They took Brown and threw him on the bed in his
  own tent&mdash;accepted Fred's offer of silver money&mdash;and departed,
  marching up-street in their heavy, iron-bound military boots with the swing
  and swagger only the Nubian in all the world knows just how to get away
  with.</p>

  <p>I lay on the bed in Fred's tent, and then Kazimoto came to us, hugely
  troubled about something, stirring the embers of the fire before the tent and
  arranging the lantern so that its rays would betray any eavesdropper. He
  searched all the shadows thoroughly, prodding into them with a stick, before
  he unburdened his mind.</p>

  <p>"Those askaris were not put here to guard our tents," he told us. (The
  really good native servant when speaking of his master's property always says
  our, and never your.) "As soon as you were gone the Greeks and the Goa came.
  They and the askaris questioned me. It was a trick! You were drawn away on
  purpose! One by one&mdash;two by two&mdash;they questioned us all, but
  particularly me."</p>

  <p>"What about?" Fred demanded.</p>

  <p>"About our business. Why are we here. What will we do. What do we know.
  What do I know about you. What do you know about me. Why do I serve you. How
  did I come to take service with you. To what place will we travel next, and
  when. How much money have we with us. Have we friends or acquaintances in
  Muanza. Do you, bwana, carry any letters in your pockets. Of what do you
  speak when you suppose no man is listening. bwana, my heart is very sad in
  me! Those Greeks tell lies, and the Germans stir trouble in a big pot like
  the witches! I know the Germans! I am Nyamwezi. I was born not far from here,
  and ran away as soon as I was old enough because the Germans shot my father
  and let my mother and brothers starve to death. I did not starve, because one
  of them took me for a servant; but I ran away from him. My heart is very sad
  to be in this place! They ask what of a hoard of ivory. I tell them I do not
  know, and they threaten to beat me! This place is bad! Let us go away
  to-night!"</p>

  <p>There was no sleep that night for any of us. My wound hurt too much. The
  others were too worried. By the light of the lantern in Fred's tent we cooked
  up a story to tell that we hoped would induce the Germans to let us wander
  where we chose.</p>

  <p>"Sure, they'll watch us!" Will admitted. "But as our only real reason for
  coming down here&mdash;leaving Brown's cattle out of the reckoning&mdash; was
  to throw people off the scent, in what way are we worse off? The lake is big
  enough to lose ourselves in! What is it&mdash;two hundred and fifty miles
  long by as many broad? D'you mean we can't give their sleuths the slip? We
  can't beat that for a plan: let 'em keep on thinking we know where Tippoo hid
  the stuff. If we succeed in losing 'em they'll think we're at large in German
  East and keep on hunting for us&mdash;whereas we'll really be up in British
  East. Let's send a telegram in code to Monty!"</p>

  <p>Then Fred thought of an idea that in the end solved our biggest problem,
  although we did not think much of it at the time.</p>

  <p>"They may refuse to take a telegram in code," he said. "It's likely
  they'll open letters. (We can try the code, of course. They'll probably take
  our money, and put their experts on deciphering the message. They'll say it
  was lost if there are any inquiries afterward.) I propose we send a
  straight-out cablegram advising Monty of our whereabouts (they'll let that go
  through) and warning him to ask for letters at the Bank in Mombasa before he
  does anything else."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but&mdash;" Will objected.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" said Fred. "I haven't finished. Then write two letters: one full
  of any old nonsense, to be sent in the regular way by mail. They'll open
  that. The other to go by runner. Kazimoto can find us a runner. He knows
  these Wan-yamwezi. He can pick a man who'll get through without fail."</p>

  <p>We could think of nothing to say against the plan. The argument that the
  German government would scarcely stoop to opening private mail did not seem
  to hold water when we examined it, so we wrote as Fred suggested&mdash;one
  letter telling Monty that we hoped to make some arrangement with the Germans,
  and at all events to wait in German East until he could join us&mdash;and the
  other telling him the real facts at great length, laboriously set out in the
  code we had agreed upon.</p>

  <p>We sealed the second letter in several wrappers, and sewed it up finally
  in a piece of waterproof silk. Then we sent for Kazimoto and ordered him to
  find the sort of messenger we needed.</p>

  <p>"Send me!" he urged. "I will start now, before it is light! I will hide by
  day and travel by night until I reach the British border! Give me only enough
  cooked food and my pay and I will take the letter without fail!"</p>

  <p>We refused, for he was too useful to us. He begged again and again to be
  sent with the letter, promising faithfully to wait for us afterward on the
  British side of the border at any place we should name. But we upbraided him
  for cowardice, ordered him to find another messenger, and promised him he
  need have no fear of Germans as long as he remained our servant.</p>

  <p>Before high noon we would each have given many years of Kazimoto's pay if
  only we could have recalled that decision and have known that he was speeding
  away from Muanza toward a border where white men knew the use of mercy.</p>

  <p>Just as the first peep of dawn began to color the sky Schubert came
  swaggering down-street to us, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.</p>

  <p>"How have you slept?" he asked us, laughing.</p>

  <p>We answered something or other.</p>

  <p>"I did not trouble to sleep! I stayed and finished the drinks. I have just
  swallowed the last of the beer! Whoever wants a morning drink must wait for
  it now until the overland safari comes!"</p>

  <p>We displayed no interest. Brown, the only one likely to yearn for alcohol
  before breakfast, snored in his still.</p>

  <p>"What of it now? I go drill my troops. Parade is sharp! There remain
  twenty minutes. Come with me tell your secret at the boma now, before it is
  too late!"</p>

  <p>"Explain why it would be too late after breakfast!" demanded Fred.</p>

  <p>"All right," said Schubert. "I will tell you this much. There will come a
  launch this morning from Kisumu in British East. There will be people on that
  launch, one of whom has authority that overrides that of the commandant of
  this place. The commandant desires to know your information&mdash;and get the
  credit for it&mdash;before that individual, whose authority is higher, comes.
  Is that clear?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," Fred answered.</p>

  <p>"See if this is clear, too!" cut in Will. "You go and ask your commandant
  what price he offers for the secret! Nothing for nothing! Tell him we're not
  afraid of him!"</p>

  <p>"It is none of my business to tell him anything," sneered Schubert,
  spitting and turning on his heel. He swaggered out of the camping-ground and
  up-street again, leaving the clear impression behind him that he washed his
  hands of us for good and all.</p>

  <p>"Let's watch him drill his men," said I. "I'll wait on the hospital steps
  until they open the place."</p>

  <p>So we ate a scratch breakfast and Fred and Will helped me up-street, past
  where the Jew stood blinking in the morning sun on the steps of the D.O.A.G.
  He seemed to be saying prayers, but beckoned to us.</p>

  <p>"Trouble!" he said. "Trouble! If you have any frien's fetch them&mdash;
  send for them!"</p>

  <p>"Can yon send a letter for us to British East?" Fred asked him.</p>

  <p>"God forbid!" He jumped at the very thought, and shrugged himself like a
  man standing under a water-spout. "What would they do to me if I were found
  out?"</p>

  <p>"What is the nature of the trouble?" Fred asked him.</p>

  <p>"Ali, who should tell! Trouble, I tell you, trouble! Zat cursed Schubert
  sat here drinking until dawn. I heard heem say many t'ings! Send for your
  friens!"</p>

  <p>He turned his back on us and ran in. There was a lieutenant arrayed in
  spotless white with a saber in glittering scabbard watching us all from the
  boma gate. A little later that morning we knew better why the Jew fled
  indoors at sight of him.</p>

  <p>Schubert was standing in mid-square with a hundred askaris lined up two-
  deep in front of him. There were no other Germans on parade. The corporals
  were Nubians, and the rest of the rank and file either Nubian or some sort of
  Sudanese. He was haranguing them in a bastard mixture of Swahili, Arabic, and
  German, they standing rigidly at attention, their rifles at the present.</p>

  <p>Not content with the effect of his words, he strode up presently to a
  front-rank man and hit him in the face with clenched fist. In the effort to
  recover his balance the man let his rifle get out of alignment. Schubert
  wrenched it from him. It fell to the ground. He struck the man, and when he
  stooped to pick the rifle up kicked him in the face. Then he strode down the
  line and beat two other men for grinning. All this the lieutenant watched
  without a sign of disapproval, or even much interest.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the chain-gang emerged from the boma gate, going full-pelt,
  fastened neck to neck, the chain taut and each man carrying a water-jar. The
  minute they had crossed the square Schubert commenced with company drill, and
  for two hours after that, with but one interval of less than five minutes for
  rest, he kept them pounding the gravel in evolution after evolution&mdash;
  manual exercise at the double&mdash;skirmishing exercise&mdash;setting up
  drill&mdash;goose-step, and all the mechanical, merciless precision drill
  with which the Germans make machines of men.</p>

  <p>His debauch did not seem in the least to have affected him, unless to make
  his temper more violently critical. By seven o'clock the sun was beating down
  on him and dazzling his eyes from over the boma wall. The dust rose off the
  square. The words of command came bellowing in swift succession from a throat
  that ought to have been hard put to it to whisper. If anything, he grew more
  active and exacting as the askaris wearied, and by the time the two hours
  were up they were ready to a man to drop.</p>

  <p>But not so he. He dismissed them, and swaggered over to the marketplace to
  hector and bully the natives who were piling their wares in the shade of the
  great grass roof. Then he went into the boma to breakfast just as a sergeant
  in khaki came over and unlocked the hospital door. I followed the sergeant
  in, but he ordered me out again.</p>

  <p>"I have come to see the doctor," I said. "I need attention."</p>

  <p>He was not one of the sergeants who had been drunk in the D.O.A.G. the
  night before, but a man of a higher mental type, although no less surly.</p>

  <p>"It will be for the doctor to say what you need when he has seen you!" he
  answered, turning his back and busying himself about the room. Will
  translated, and I limped out again.</p>

  <p>By and by the doctor came, and passed me sitting on the steps amid a
  throng of natives who seemed to have all the imaginable kinds of sores. He
  took no notice of me, but sent out the sergeant to inquire why I had not
  stood up as he passed. I did not answer, and the sergeant went in again.</p>

  <p>Fred by that time was simply blasphemous, alternately threatening to go in
  and kick the doctor, and condemning Will's determination to do the same
  thing. Finally we decided to see the matter through patiently, and all sat
  together on the steps watching the activity of the square. There was a lot
  going on&mdash;bartering of skins and hides&mdash;counting of crocodile eggs,
  brought in by natives for sake of the bounty of a few copper coins the
  hundred&mdash;a cock-fight in one corner&mdash;the carrying to and fro of
  bunches of bananas, meat, and grain in baskets; and in and out among it all
  full pelt in the hot sun marched the chain-gang, doing the township dirty
  work.</p>

  <p>By and by Schubert emerged from the boma gate followed by natives carrying
  a table and a soap-box. He set these under a limb of the great baobab that
  faced the boma gate not far from the middle of the square. I noticed then for
  the first time that a short hempen rope hung suspended from the largest
  branch, with a noose in the end. The noose was not more than two feet below
  the branch.</p>

  <p>Schubert's consideration of the table's exact position, and the placing of
  the soap-box on the table, was interrupted by the arrival of Coutlass, his
  Greek companion and the Goanese arm in arm, followed closely by two askaris
  who shouted angrily and made a great show of trying to prevent them. One of
  the askaris aimed his rifle absurdly at Coutlass, both Greeks and the Goanese
  daring him gleefully to pull the trigger.</p>

  <p>They purposely came close to us, not that we showed signs of meaning to
  befriend them. They were simply unable to understand that there are degrees
  of disgrace. To Coutlass all victims of government outrage ought surely to be
  more than friendly with any one in conflict with the law. Personal quarrels
  should go for nothing in face of the common wrong.</p>

  <p>"There is going to be a hanging!" Coutlass shouted to us. "They thought we
  would remain quietly in camp with that going on! Give us chairs!" he called
  to Schubert. "Provide us a place in the front row where we may see!"</p>

  <p>Schubert grinned. He returned to the boma yard and presumably conferred
  with an officer, for presently he came out again and gave the Greeks leave to
  stand under the tree, provided they would return to camp afterward. Later
  yet, Brown came along and joined us on the steps, looking red-eyed and
  ridiculous.</p>

  <p>"Goin' to be a hangin," he announced. "I been askin' natives about it.
  Black man stole the condemned man's daughter an' refused to pay cows for her
  accordin' to custom or anythin'&mdash;said he could do what the white men did
  an' help himself. Father of the girl took a spear and settled the thief's
  hash with it&mdash;ran him through&mdash;did a clean job. Serve him right
  &mdash;eh&mdash;what? Germans went an' nabbed him, though&mdash;tried him in
  open court&mdash;goin' to hang him this mornin' for murder! How does it
  strike you?"</p>

  <p>We were not exactly in mood to talk to Brown&mdash;in fact, we wished him
  anywhere but with us, but he thought self perfectly welcome, and rambled
  on:</p>

  <p>"Up in British East we don't hang black men for murder unless it's what
  they call an aggravated case&mdash;murder an' robbery&mdash;murder an'
  arson&mdash;murder an' rape. Hang a white man for murderin' a black sure as
  you're sitting here, an' shoot a black man for murderin' a white; but the
  blacks don't understand, so when they kill one another in such a case this,
  why we give 'em a short jail sentence an' a good lo lecture, an' let 'em go
  again. These folks have it t'other way round. They never hang a German,
  whether he's guilty or not, but hang a poor black man, what doesn't
  understand, for half o' nothin'!"</p>

  <p>A great crowd began gathering about the tree, and was presently driven by
  askaris with whips into a mass on the far side of the tree from us. Whether
  purposely or not, they left a clear view from the hospital steps of all that
  should happen. Evidently warning had been sent out broadcast, for the
  inhabitants of village after village came trooping into town to watch, each
  lot led by its sultani in filthy rags and the foolish imitation crown his
  conquerors had supplied him at several times its proper price. The square was
  a dense sea of people before nine o'clock, and the askaris made the front few
  hundreds lie, and the next rows squat, in order that the men and women behind
  might see.</p>

  <p>Then at last out came the victim with his hands tied behind him and a
  bright red blanket on his loins. He was a proud-looking fellow. He halted a
  moment between his guard of German sergeants and eyed the crowd, and us, and
  the tree, and the noose. Then he looked down on the ground and appeared to
  take no further interest.</p>

  <p>The sergeants took him by the arms and led him along to the table between
  them. Out came the commandant then, in snow-white uniform, with his saber
  polished until it shone&mdash;all spruced up for the occasion, and followed
  by a guard of honor consisting of lieutenant, two sergeants, and six black
  askaris.</p>

  <p>There was a chair by the table. At sight of the commandant the sergeants
  made their victim use that as a step by which to mount the table and
  soap-box, and there he stood eying his oppressors as calmly as if he were
  witnessing a play. A murmur arose among the crowd. A number of natives called
  to him by name, but he took no notice after that one first steady gaze.</p>

  <p>"They're sayin' good-bye to him," said Brown, breathing in my ear.
  "They're telling him they won't forget him!"</p>

  <p>The crack of askaris' whips falling on head and naked shoulders swiftly
  reduced the crowd to silence. Then the commandant faced them all, and made a
  speech with that ash-can voice of his&mdash;first in German, then in the
  Nyamwezi tongue. Will translated to us sentence by sentence, the doctor
  standing on the top step behind us smiling approval. He seemed to think we
  would be benefited by the lecture just as much as the natives.</p>

  <p>It was awful humbug that the commandant reeled off to his silent audience
  &mdash;hypocrisy garbed in paternal phrases, and interlarded with bunkum
  about Germany's mission to bring happiness to subject peoples.</p>

  <p>"Above all," he repeated again and again, "the law must be enforced
  impartially&mdash;the good, sound, German law that knows no fear or favor,
  but governs all alike!"</p>

  <p>When he had finished he turned to the culprit.</p>

  <p>"Now," he demanded, "do you know why you are to be hanged?"</p>

  <p>There was a moment's utter silence. The crowd drew in its breath, seeming
  to know in advance that some brave answer was forthcoming. The man on the
  table with his hands behind him surveyed the crowd again with the gaze of
  simple dignity, looked down on the commandant, and raised his voice. It was
  an unexpected, high, almost falsetto note, that in the silence carried all
  across the square.</p>

  <p>"I am to die," he said, "because I did right! My enemy did what German
  officers do. He stole my young girl. I killed him, as I hope all you Germans
  may be killed! But hope no longer gathers fruit in this land!"</p>

  <p>"Ah-h-h-h!" the crowd sighed in unison.</p>

  <p>"Good man!" exploded Fred, and the doctor tried to kick him from behind
  &mdash;not hard, but enough to call his attention to the proprieties. His toe
  struck me instead, and when I looked up angrily he tried to pretend he was
  not aware of what he had done.</p>

  <p>Under the trees the commandant flew into a rage such I have seldom seen.
  Each land has a temper of its own, an the white man's anger varies in inverse
  ratio with his nearness to the equator. But <i>furor teutonicus</i>*
  transplanted is the least controllable, least dignified, least admirable that
  there is. And that man's passion was the apex of its kind.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>furor teutonicus</i>&mdash;Teutonic frenzy;
  ruthless German aggressivity. The phrase is usually atributed to the Roman
  poet Lucan (39-65 C.E.), who used it to describe the merciless, bloodthirsty
  frenzy displayed by Teutonic tribesmen in battle. <i><a href=
  "http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furor_Teutonicus">Wikipedia</a></i> (German
  edition).]</p>

  <p>His beard spread, as a peacock spreads its tail. His eyes blazed. His
  eyebrows disappeared under the brim of his white helmet, and his clenched
  fists burst the white cotton gloves. He half-drew his saber&mdash;thought
  better of that, and returned it. There was an askari standing near with
  kiboko in hand to drive back the crowd should any press too closely. He
  snatched the whip and struck the condemned man with it, as high up as he
  could reach, making a great welt across his bare stomach. The man neither
  winced nor complained.</p>

  <p>"For those words," the commandant screamed at him in German, "you shall
  not die in comfort! For that insolence, mere hanging is too good!"</p>

  <p>Then he calmed himself a little, and repeated the words in the native
  tongue, explaining to the crowd that German dignity should be upheld at all
  costs.</p>

  <p>"Fetch him down from there," he ordered.</p>

  <p>Schubert sprang on the table and knocked the condemned man off it with a
  blow of his fist. With hands bound behind him the poor fellow had no power of
  balance, and though he jumped clear he fell face-downward, skinning his cheek
  on the gravel. The commandant promptly put a foot on his neck and pinned him
  down.</p>

  <p>"Flog him!" he ordered. "Two hundred lashes!"</p>

  <p>It was done in silence, except for the corporal's labored breathing and
  the commandant's incessant sharp commands to "beat harder&mdash;harder
  &mdash;harder. A sergeant stood by counting. The crack of the whip divided up
  the silence into periods of agony.</p>

  <p>When the count was done the victim was still conscious. Schubert and a
  sergeant dragged him to his feet, and hauled him to the table. Four other men
  &mdash;two sergeants and two natives&mdash;passed a rope round the table
  legs. Schubert lifted the victim by the elbows so that his head could pass
  through the noose, and when that was accomplished the man had to stand on
  tiptoe on the soap-box in order to breathe at all.</p>

  <p>"All ready!" announced Schubert, and jumped off with a laugh, his white
  tunic bloody from contact with the victim's tortured back.</p>

  <p>"Los!" roared the commandant</p>

  <p>The men hauled on the rope. Table and soap-box came tumbling away, and the
  victim spun in the air on nothing, spinning round, and round, and round
  &mdash;slower and slower and slower&mdash;then back the other way round
  faster and faster. They say hanging is a merciful death&mdash;that the
  pressure of rope on two arteries produces anesthesia, but few are reported to
  have come back to tell of the experience. At any rate, as is not the case
  with shooting, it is easy to know when the victim is really dead.</p>

  <p>For seconds that seemed minutes&mdash;for minutes that seemed hours the
  poor wretch spun, his elbows out, his knees up, his tongue out, his face
  wrinkled into tortured shapes, and his toes pointed upward so sharply that
  they almost touched his shins. Then suddenly the toes turned downward and the
  knees relapsed. The corpse hung limp, and the Crowd sighed miserably, to the
  last man, woman and child, turning its back on what to them must have
  symbolized German rule.</p>

  <p>They left the corpse hanging there. It was to be there until evening, some
  one said, for an example to frequenters of the market-place. The crowd
  trailed away, none glancing back. The pattering of feet ceased. The market-
  place across the square resumed its hum and activity. Then a native orderly
  came down the steps and touched me on the elbow. I struggled to my feet and
  limped after him up the steps.</p>

  <p>Practically at the mercy of the doctor, I made up my mind to be civil to
  him whether that suited me or not. I rather expected he would come to meet
  me, perhaps help me to chair, and I wondered how, in my ignorance of German,
  I should contrive to answer his questions.</p>

  <p>But I need not have worried. I did not even see him. He had left by the
  back door, and the orderly washed the wound and changed my bandages. That was
  all. There was no charge for the bandages, and the orderly was gentle now
  that his master's back was turned.</p>

  <p>"Didn't he leave word when he would see me?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Habanah!" he answered&mdash;meaning, "He did not&mdash;there is not
  &mdash;there is nothing doing!"</p>

  <p class="poem"
     style="margin-left:10%">We were an ignorant people. Out of a gloom we
     came<br>
  Hungering, striving, feasting&mdash;vanishing into the same.<br>
  Came to us your foreloopers, told us the gloom was bad,<br>
  Spoke of the Light that might be&mdash;simply it could be had&mdash;<br>
  Knowledge and wealth and freedom, plenty and peace and play,<br>
  And at all the price of obedience. "Listen and learn and obey,"<br>
  We were told, "and the gloom shall be lifted. Ignorance surely is shame."<br>
  We listened to your foreloopers till presently Cadis* came.<br>
  <br>
  [* <i>Cadi</i>&mdash;judge.]<br>
  <br>
  We were an ignorant people. Our law was "an eye for an eye,"<br>
  And he who wronged should right the wrong, and he who stole should die
  &mdash;<br>
  Bad law the Cadis told us, based on the fall of man;<br>
  And they set us to building law-courts on the pan-Germanic plan&mdash;<br>
  Courts where the gloom of ages should be pierced, said they, with Light<br>
  And scientific theory displace wrong views of Right.<br>
  The Cadis' law was writ in books that only they could read,<br>
  But what should we know of the strings to that? 'Twas gloom when we
  agreed.<br>
  <br>
  We were an ignorant people. The <i>Offiziere</i> came<br>
  To lend to law eye, tooth, and claw and so enforce the same.<br>
  Now naught are the tribal customs; free speech is under ban;<br>
  Displaced are misconceptions that were based on fallen man,<br>
  And our gloom has gone in darkness of the risen German's night,<br>
  Nor is there salt of mercy lest it sap the hold of Might.<br>
  They strike&mdash;we may not answer, nor dare we ask them why.<br>
  We sold ourselves to supermen. If we rebel, we die.<br>

  &mdash;<i>Ipsos Custodes</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">I SAT down once more on the hospital steps, and listened
  while Fred and Will relieved themselves of their opinions about German
  manners. Nothing seemed likely to relieve me. I had marched a hundred miles,
  endured the sickening pain, and waited an extra night at the end of it all
  simply on the strength of anticipation. Now that the surgeon would not see
  me, hope seemed gone. I could think of nothing but to go and hide somewhere,
  like a wounded animal.</p>

  <p>But there were two more swift shocks in store, and no hiding-place. The
  path to the water-front led past us directly along the southern boma wall.
  Before Fred and Will had come to an end of swearing they saw something that
  struck them silent so suddenly that I looked up and saw, too. Not that I
  cared very much. To me it seemed merely one last super-added piece of
  evidence that life was not worth while.</p>

  <p>Plainly the launch had come from British East, of which Schubert had
  spoken. Hand in hand from the water-front, followed by the obsequious
  Schubert, all smiles and long black whip (for the chain-gang trailed after
  with the luggage, and needed to be overawed), walked Professor Schillingschen
  and Lady Isobel Saffren Waldon. They seemed in love&mdash;or at any rate the
  professor did, for he ogled and smirked like a bearded gargoyle; and she made
  such play of being charmed by his grimaces that the Syrian maid fell behind
  to hide her face.</p>

  <p>None of us spoke. We watched them. Personally I did not mind the feeling
  that the worst had happened at last. I was incapable of sounding further
  depths of gloom&mdash;too full of pain bodily to suffer mentally from threats
  of what might yet be. But the other two looked miserable&mdash;more so
  because Fred's bearded chin perked up so bravely, and Will set his jaw like a
  rock.</p>

  <p>Not one of us had said a word when the biggest askari we had seen yet
  strode up to us&mdash;saluted&mdash;and gave Fred a sealed envelope. It was
  written in English, addressed to us three by name (although our names were
  wrongly spelled). We were required to present ourselves at the court-house at
  once, reason not given. The letter was signed "Liebenkrantz,
  &mdash;Lieutenant."</p>

  <p>The askari waited for us. I suppose it would not be correct to say we were
  under arrest, but the enormous black man made it sufficiently obvious that he
  did not intend returning to the court without us. The court-house was not
  more than two hundred yards away. As we turned toward it we saw Lady Saffren
  Waldon being helped into the commandant's litter, borne by four men, the
  commandant himself superintending the ceremony with a vast deal of bowing and
  chatter, and Professor Schillingschen looking on with an air of owning
  litter, porters, township, boma, and all. As we turned our backs on them they
  started off toward the neat white dwelling on the hill.</p>

  <p>The court was a round, grass-roofed affair, with white-washed walls of
  sun-dried brick. For about four-fifths of the circumference the wall was
  barely breast-high, the roof being supported on wooden pillars bricked into
  the wall, as well as by the huge pole that propped it up umbrella-wise in the
  center.</p>

  <p>The remaining fifth of the wall continued up as high as the roof, forming
  a back to the platform. Facing the platform was the entrance, and on either
  side benches arranged in rows followed the curve of the wall. There was a
  long table on the platform, at which sat the lieutenant who had summoned us,
  with a sergeant seated on either hand. The sergeants were acting as court
  clerks, scribbling busily on sheets of blue paper, and in books.</p>

  <p>Behind the lieutenant, in a great gilt frame on the white-washed wall, was
  a full-length portrait of the Kaiser in general's uniform. The Kaiser was
  depicted scowling, his gloved hands resting on a saber almost as ferocious-
  looking as the one the lieutenant kept winding his leg around.</p>

  <p>All the benches were crowded with spectators, prisoners, witnesses, and
  litigants. Outside, at least two hundred Arabs, Indians, and natives leaned
  with elbows on the wall and gazed at the scene within. The lieutenant glared,
  but otherwise took no notice of our entry; he gave no order, but one of the
  two sergeants came down from the platform and kicked half a dozen natives off
  the front bench to make room for us.</p>

  <p>We were mistaken in supposing our case would be called first, or even
  among the first. The floor in the midst of the court was clear except for a
  long single line of natives and six askari corporals, each with a whip in his
  hand. It was evident at once that these natives were all ahead of us, even if
  those on the benches were not to be heard and dealt with before our turn
  came.</p>

  <p>"Look at the far end of the line!" whispered Fred.</p>

  <p>Lo and behold Kazimoto, looking rather drawn and gray, but standing
  bravely, looking neither to the right nor left. I judged he knew we were in
  court&mdash;he could hardly have failed to notice our coming in&mdash;but he
  sturdily refused to turn his head and see us.</p>

  <p>"What has he done?" I wondered.</p>

  <p>"Nothing more than told some Heinie to go to hell&mdash;you can bet your
  boots!" said Will.</p>

  <p>The lieutenant was in no hurry to enlighten us. Our boy stood at the wrong
  end of the line to be taken first. The lieutenant called a name, and two
  great askaris pounced on the trembling native at the other end and dragged
  him forward, leaving him standing alone before the desk.</p>

  <p>"Silence!" the lieutenant shouted, and the court became still as
  death.</p>

  <p>He had a voice as mean as a hyena's&mdash;a voice that matched his face.
  The insolent, upturned twist of his fair mustache showed both corners of a
  thin-lipped mouth. He had the Prussian head, shaped square whichever way you
  viewed it. There was strength in the jaw-bones&mdash;strength in the deep-set
  bright eyes&mdash;strength in the shoulders that were square as box-corners
  without any padding&mdash;strength in the lean lithe figure; but it was
  always brute strength. There was no moral strength whatever in the restless
  fidgeting&mdash;the savage winding and unwinding of his left foot around the
  saber scabbard, or the attitude, leaning forward over the table, of petulant
  pugnacity. And the cruel voice was as weak as the hand was strong with which
  he rapped on the table.</p>

  <p>He questioned the boy in front of him sharply&mdash;told him he stood
  charged with theft&mdash;and demanded an answer.</p>

  <p>"With theft of what thing, and whose thing?"</p>

  <p>The answer was bold. The trembling had ceased. Now that he faced nemesis
  the strength of native fatalism came to his rescue, bolstering up the pride
  that every uncontaminated Nyamwezi owns. He was not more than seventeen years
  old, but he stood there at last like a veteran at bay.</p>

  <p>"Put him down and beat him!" ordered the lieutenant.</p>

  <p>"Impudent answers to this court shall always be soundly punished! Call the
  next case while that one is being taught good manners.</p>

  <p>A woman was stood in front of the line, fidgety with fear, in doubt
  whether to lay her suckling baby on the bench before she faced military
  justice. She laid it on the floor at her feet, hesitated, and then picked it
  up again and wrapped it in a corner of the red blanket that constituted her
  only dress.</p>

  <p>"Take that brat away from her!" the lieutenant ordered. "She must pay
  attention to me. With that in her arms she will only think of mothering!"</p>

  <p>An askari seized the baby by the arm and leg and gave it with a laugh to
  another woman to hold, its mother whimpering with fright until she saw it
  safely nestled.</p>

  <p>"Quick, now! What about this one?"</p>

  <p>It seemed there was no charge against her. The two sergeants searched
  through the piles of blue sheets in vain.</p>

  <p>"Then what the devil is she here for? What do you want, you?"</p>

  <p>The trembling woman pointed to her baby, but was dumb. It needed courage
  to answer that lieutenant, and the crack&mdash;crack&mdash;crack of a thick
  kiboko descending at measured intervals on the naked back of the boy who had
  answered boldly was no help toward reassurance.</p>

  <p>"Speak!" the lieutenant ordered, "or I shall have you compelled to
  speak!"</p>

  <p>She burst into sudden volubility. The dam once down, she poured forth a
  catalogue of wrongs that seemed endless, switching off from one dialect to
  another and at intervals inserting, apropos apparently of nothing, the few
  words of German she had picked up. The lieutenant yelled for an interpreter,
  and a Nyamwezi who knew German rose from the front bench and came and stood
  beside her.</p>

  <p>"That baby is a white man's," he explained.</p>

  <p>"What does she want?"</p>

  <p>"She says the white man is the bwana daktari."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>daktari</i> (Swahili)&mdash;doctor. <i><a href=
  "http://research.yale.edu/cgi-bin/swahili/lookup.cgi?Word=daktari&amp;EngP=0">
  The Internet Living Swahili Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>"Oh! Then I am glad she came here. It is time these loose women were
  taught a lesson! They tell the same tale. They say a white man passed through
  the village, gave their father a present, and carried them off. Is that her
  tale, too?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;what of it? The father agreed at the time when he accepted the
  present, didn't he? The consequence is a baby&mdash;not for the first time!
  Instead of going back to her village, she comes here and tries to blackmail
  the officer! She is young. It's the first time she has been in this court.
  This time I will be lenient. One hundred lashes!"</p>

  <p>The interpreter translated, and the woman screamed. An askari seized her
  by the shoulders. She clung to him, but he threw her to the ground, and
  another one tore off the blanket that would have deadened the blows to some
  extent. She begged, and clung to their feet, but the blows began to rain on
  her, and presently she lay still, her breasts flattened against the earth
  floor, her mouth full of dust, and her naked body paralyzed by fear of the
  descending lash.</p>

  <p>"Now bring up number one again!" the lieutenant ordered.</p>

  <p>The askaris ceased from flogging him. One of them kicked him to his feet,
  and he resumed his stand in front of the lieutenant, looking up at him as
  proudly as ever, for all that his back was bruised and bloody.</p>

  <p>"Did you steal or did you not?" asked the lieutenant.</p>

  <p>"Steal what from whom?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, go on beating him! Next case!"</p>

  <p>The next man escaped the whip, but his witnesses were less fortunate. He
  brought two men and a woman with him to prove an alibi on a charge of
  attempted theft, and the glibness of their answers convinced the lieutenant
  they were lying. In the absence of all evidence for the prosecution except
  the unsupported word of a police askari who admitted a personal grudge
  against the defendant, the lieutenant resorted to the whip to change the
  witnesses' convictions, but without avail.</p>

  <p>The woman yelled under the lash like a demented thing, but, far from
  withdrawing her statements, tried to spit in the lieutenant's face when
  jerked to her feet and stood again before him&mdash;an impossible feat
  because the platform on which he sat at the table was too high. He had her
  beaten a second time for spitting.</p>

  <p>The next man was a fat Baganda from British territory, charged with
  trading without a license. He pleaded ignorance of the law, and denied having
  traded. He was flogged for telling lies in court, and changed his testimony
  under the lash, whereat he was promptly sentenced to a hundred and fifty
  lashes and a month on the chain-gang. Under the lash a second time, he
  recanted&mdash;swore that his first statements had been true and that he had
  done no trading&mdash;a mistake in tactics that only caused the tale of
  lashes to be increased by fifty and the term on the chain-gang to be
  doubled.</p>

  <p>"You must learn that the methods taught you on British territory are of no
  use here!" remarked the lieutenant.</p>

  <p>By the time Kazimoto was called and stood out alone in front of him the
  lieutenant was in a boiling rage, and the floor of the court was actually
  crowded by prone natives being beaten. Extra askaris had been sent for in
  order that proceedings might not be delayed, and the audience could scarcely
  hear the evidence and sentences because of the crack of whips and the moans
  of victims. (Not that they all moaned by any means. By far the most of them
  submitted to the torture in grim proud silence: but the few who did make a
  noise&mdash;especially the women&mdash;made lots of it.)</p>

  <p>As Kazimoto faced the lieutenant he turned once and looked at us. His eyes
  sought Fred's.</p>

  <p>"Oh, bwana!" he said&mdash;and now for the first time we learned why he
  had chosen Fred to be his particular master. "I have been faithful! Stroke,
  then, that beard of yours as bwana Courtney, my former master, used to stroke
  his. Then we shall both know what to do!"</p>

  <p>Fred stroked his beard promptly, for the man needed comfort, not ridicule:
  but the concession to his superstition did none of us any good.</p>

  <p>"Face this way!" the lieutenant shouted at him. "You are charged with
  being a deserter from German service. Also with giving information to
  foreigners. Also with serving foreigners in their effort to exploit the
  country, and with refusing to give proper answers when questioned by those in
  authority. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Kazimoto in the most melancholy tone I ever heard from him.</p>

  <p>"Are you a Nyamwezi? Now don't dare to lie to me!"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You were born in this country?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then you belong in this country!"</p>

  <p>"I belong where my master takes me. My spirit is good. I am a true man,"
  Kazimoto answered.</p>

  <p>"Your spirit is rotten! You are a traitor! What do you mean by talking to
  me of your master, you reptile! Your master is the German government, of
  which His Majesty the Kaiser is supreme overlord! There is a picture of your
  master!" He pointed with a thumb over his shoulder to the full-length
  atrocity in oils behind him. "Salute it!"</p>

  <p>The boy obeyed.</p>

  <p>"Answer now! Who is your master?"</p>

  <p>Kazimoto hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Answer, I order you!"</p>

  <p>He turned and pointed a finger at Fred, who nodded.</p>

  <p>"That English bwana is my master," he said stoutly. It was a forlorn hope,
  though. He did not seem to believe that the statement of fact would do him
  any good.</p>

  <p>Fred jumped to his feet.</p>

  <p>"That is perfectly correct," he said in English. "The boy is my servant,
  engaged on British territory, under a contract for wages to be paid in
  English money. He is to be paid off in British East at the end of my
  journey."</p>

  <p>"Who asked you to speak?" demanded the lieutenant angrily, sitting up like
  a startled scorpion. "Do you not know this is a court?"</p>

  <p>"It looks like a shambles!" Fred answered, glancing to right and left and
  indicating the victims of the whip writhing in the name of German
  justice.</p>

  <p>"Shut up, you fool!" counseled Will in a stage whisper, but either Fred
  did not hear him, or was too worked up to care.</p>

  <p>"Silence! Sit down!"</p>

  <p>"I warn you!" Fred answered. "That boy has claimed British protection. I
  shall see he has it!"</p>

  <p>Then he sat down. The lieutenant glared at Kazimoto, the glare changing to
  a cold grin as he realized how fully we were all at his mercy for the
  moment.</p>

  <p>"You are sentenced," he said, "to two hundred lashes for making impudent
  answers to the court, and to six months on the chain-gang for deserting from
  this country and entering foreign service. Further evidence against you will
  be assembled in the meanwhile, and other charges against you will be tried on
  completion of the chain-gang sentence!"</p>

  <p>"I protest!" shouted Fred, jumping up again. "I give notice of appeal to
  whatever higher court there is. I am ready to give bonds!"</p>

  <p>"What does this delay mean?" snapped the lieutenant. "Put him down at once
  and lay the lashes on!"</p>

  <p>The unfortunate Kazimoto was pounced on by two askaris and thrown face-
  downward on the floor. One of them tore off his clothes, ripping up his good
  English jacket.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear my protest?" shouted Fred. "Did you hear my notice of
  appeal?"</p>

  <p>"I did," said the lieutenant. "Appeals are heard at the coast. You must
  give notice by mail, and receive an acknowledgment from the higher military
  court before I grant stay of execution. Lay on the lashes!"</p>

  <p>"I will hold you personally liable for this outrage," Fred told him, "if
  it costs me all my money and all the rest of my years! I defy you to
  continue!"</p>

  <p>"You have yourself to blame!" the lieutenant grinned. "But for your
  uninvited interruption the Nyamwezi would have had a better hearing! Lay
  those lashes on harder and more slowly!"</p>

  <p>Kazimoto was taking his gruel like a man. Two askaris were beating him.
  The blows fell at random anywhere below the neck and above the heels, raising
  a great welt where they did not actually cut the skin. He had buried his face
  in his forearms, and Will had gone to stand near him, stooping down to
  encourage him with any words at all that might seem to serve.</p>

  <p>"Stick it out, Kazi! We'll stand by! We won't leave you down here!
  Remember you've got friends who won't desert you!"</p>

  <p>Probably in his agony Kazimoto did not understand a word of it, but the
  lieutenant did,&mdash;and swiftly took steps to interfere.</p>

  <p>"Call the Europeans' cases next!" he shouted, and promptly the German
  sergeants stepped down from the platform to marshal us in line. The
  lieutenant went through the form of studying the blue papers, and called out
  our names. That of Brown was included, but Brown was not in court and we were
  kept standing there until he had been fetched from his tent. He had retired
  immediately after the hanging to sleep off the effects of his debauch, and
  being now deprived of that luxury arrived between two askaris in a volcanic
  temper. He insulted the lieutenant to begin with.</p>

  <p>"A diet o' beer an' sausage don't seem to have filled you full o' good
  manners, do it?"</p>

  <p>The lieutenant scowled, but for the moment chose to ignore the
  pleasantry.</p>

  <p>"You people are charged," he said, "with entering German territory
  otherwise than by a regular road and without reporting at a customs station.
  Further, with intending to defraud the customs&mdash;with carrying and
  possessing arms without a license&mdash;with being in possession of
  ammunition without a permit&mdash;with shooting game without a license
  &mdash;with filibustering&mdash;with intentional homicide, in that you shot
  and killed certain men of the Masai tribe within German territory &mdash;with
  wandering at large without permits and with felonious intent; and last, and
  this is the most serious charge, with being spies within the military meaning
  of that term. Do you plead guilty or not guilty?"</p>

  <p>We were dumb. Even the crack of the heavy whips on poor Kazimoto's skin
  ceased to make impression on us. Suffering already from my wound to the point
  of nausea, I actually reeled before this new deluge of trouble, and had to
  hold on to Fred and Will. They each put an arm under mine. It was Brown who
  spoke and stole from our sails what little wind there might have been.</p>

  <p>"Decline to plead!" he shouted boisterously. "You're no judge, you're a
  pirate! You're not fit to try natives, let alone white men! You're a
  disgrace, that's what you are! All you're fit for is to make a decent fellow
  glad he needn't know you!"</p>

  <p>"Silence!" roared the lieutenant, banging on the table with his open palm
  &mdash;then with his fist&mdash;then with a mallet.</p>

  <p>"Silence yourself!" retorted Brown as soon as the hammering ceased. "You
  ought to be ashamed o' yourself! Your court's a bally disgrace, an' you're
  the worst thing in it! You and your Kaiser can go to hell, and be damned to
  both of you!"</p>

  <p>"One month in jail for contempt of court and
  <i>Majestätsbeleidigung</i>!"* snapped the lieutenant. "Take him away!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Majestätsbeleidigung</i> (German)&mdash;
  lèse-majesté; lese-majesty.]</p>

  <p>Quite clearly that was not the first time that a white man had been
  imprisoned in Muanza. There was no hesitation about the way in which an
  askari seized Brown's wrists or a sergeant snapped the handcuffs. He was
  hustled out expostulating, kicked on the shins by the sergeant when he faced
  about to argue, and shoved into a run by both sergeant and askari.</p>

  <p>"You others would better be careful what you say!" said the
  lieutenant.</p>

  <p>"I've a mind to share Brown's cell!" said Will, but the lieutenant
  affected not to hear that.</p>

  <p>"Since you refuse to plead in this court, you shall be held until the
  arrival of Major Schunck from the coast. Your arms and ammunition are to be
  handed over to the askaris, who will be sent to the rest-camp to receive
  them. The askaris will search your belongings thoroughly to make sure they
  have all your weapons. You are ordered confined within the limits of this
  township, and if you are detected making any attempt to trespass outside
  township limits you will be confined as the Greeks are within the rest-camp
  under observation. The porters you brought into the country are all to be
  paid their full wages by you until Major Schunck shall have dealt with you;
  the porters are refused permission to leave Muanza, being needed as
  witnesses. Next case!"</p>

  <p>He scrawled his signature at the foot of each sheet of blue paper, and
  made a motion with his arm that we should leave court. But we sat down and
  waited until the two Nubian giants had finished flogging Kazimoto, and when
  they dragged him to his feet Will and Fred walked over to give him a few
  words of comfort. That act of ordinary kindness threw the lieutenant into
  another fury.</p>

  <p>"Bring the Nyamwezi here!" he ordered, and the askaris hustled him up in
  front of the table.</p>

  <p>"What do you do? Have you no manners? Return proper thanks for the lesson
  you have received!"</p>

  <p>Kazimoto stood silent.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake&mdash;" Will began.</p>

  <p>"Say 'Thank you' to him, Kazimoto!" Fred whispered.</p>

  <p>There is no native word for "Thank you"&mdash;only a bastard thing
  introduced by tyrants from Europe who never understood the African contention
  that the giver rewards himself if his gift is worth anything at all.</p>

  <p>"Asente," said Kazimoto meekly.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you salute? Don't you know where you are?"</p>

  <p>"For the love of God salute him!" Will almost shouted.</p>

  <p>Kazimoto obeyed.</p>

  <p>"Take him and put him on the chain-gang!" ordered the lieutenant. "You
  Europeans leave the court!"</p>

  <p>"I'm no European!" Will shouted back. "Thank the Lord I was born in a
  country you'll never set foot in!"</p>

  <p>"Take them away before I have to make an example of them!" the lieutenant
  ordered.</p>

  <p>Obediently the askaris gathered about us and hustled us out into the open,
  poking at my bandaged wound to get swifter action, and going as far as to
  threaten us with their hippo-hide whips. I trod on the naked toe of one of
  them with sufficient suddenness and weight to deprive him of the use of it
  for all time, and luckily for me he did not see who did it. The askari next
  to him had boots on, and got the blame.</p>

  <p>The black men who were to search our belongings tried to induce us to
  hurry, but we insisted on seeing the iron ring riveted to Kazimoto's neck.
  The ring had a shackle on it, and through that they passed the long chain
  that held him prisoner in the midst of a gang of forty men. Nobody washed the
  wounds on his back. We bought water from a woman who was passing with a great
  jar on her head, and did that much for him. He was naked. His clothes that
  the askaris had torn from him had been thrown outside the court, and some one
  had stolen them. Later they gave him a piece of cheap calico to bind round
  his waist, but during all that hot afternoon he had nothing to keep the sun
  from his tortured back; nor would they permit us to give him anything.</p>

  <p>The mortification of having one's private belongings gone through by black
  men in uniform was made more exasperating still by the fact that Coutlass and
  the other Greek and the Goanese were spectators, amusing themselves with
  comments that came nearer to causing murder than they guessed.</p>

  <p>The real motive of the search was evident within two minutes from the
  commencement. The askaris could not read, but they showed a most remarkable
  affinity for paper that had been written on. They took the guns and
  ammunition first, but after that they emptied everything from our bags and
  boxes on to the sand, and confiscated every scrap of paper, shaking our books
  to make sure nothing was left between the leaves.</p>

  <p>They even took away our writing material in their zeal to find information
  likely to prove useful to their masters. But they forgot to search our
  pockets, so that they overlooked the letter we had written in code to Monty
  and had not yet sent away by messenger.</p>

  <p>That letter became our most besetting problem. How to find a runner who
  would take it to British East and mail it for us up there without betraying
  us first to the Germans was something we could not guess. Even Fred grew
  gloomy when we realized there was probably not a native on the whole
  countryside with sufficient manhood left in him to dare make the attempt. The
  first overture we might make would almost certainly be reported to the
  commandant at once.</p>

  <p>"What fools we were not to send Kazimoto with it when he begged us
  to!"</p>

  <p>"What worse than fools!"</p>

  <p>"What brutes! Think what we might have saved him!"</p>

  <p>We were unanimous as to that, but unanimity brought no comfort, until we
  all together hit on a notion that did ease our feelings a trifle. Coutlass
  and his two friends were sitting on camp-stools in the open where they could
  have a full view of our doings. Assuming the camping-ground to be equally
  divided between their party and ours, they were well within our portion. We
  decided their curiosity was insolent, declared inexorable war, and there and
  then felt better.</p>

  <p>Fred went out with a tent-peg and scored in the sand a deep line to denote
  our boundary, the Greeks watching, all eyes and guesswork.</p>

  <p>"Over the other side with you!" Fred ordered when he had finished.</p>

  <p>They refused. He charged at them, and they ran.</p>

  <p>"Whichever of you, man or servant, sets foot on our side of that line
  shall be a dead-sure hospital case!" Fred announced. "We'll reciprocate by
  leaving your side of the camp to you!"</p>

  <p>"Who made you men rulers of this rest-camp?" Coutlass demanded.</p>

  <p>"We did," Fred answered. "We've lost our rifles just as you have. We'll
  fight you with bare hands and skin you alive if you trespass!"</p>

  <p>"Gassharamminy!" shouted Coutlass. "By hell and Waterloo, you mistake me
  for a weakling! Wait and see!"</p>

  <p>We had to wait a very long and weary time, but we did see. In the days
  that followed, when my wound festered and I grew too ill to drag myself
  about, Fred and Will were able to leave me alone in the camp without any fear
  of a visit from the Greeks. It was not that there was much left worth
  stealing, but a mere visit from them might have had consequences we could
  never have offset. Alone, unable to rise, I could not have forced them to
  leave, and their lingering would surely have been interpreted by the guard,
  who always watched them from the corner of the road, as evidence of collusion
  of some sort between them and us.</p>

  <p>Just at that time Coutlass, as it happened, would have liked nothing
  better in the world than the chance to persuade the Germans that he was in
  our councils. Fred's mere irritable determination to divide the camp in
  halves saved us in all human probability from a trap out of which there would
  have been no escape.</p>

  <p class="poem">Oh Thou, who gavest English speech<br>

  <br>
  &mdash;<i>"Speak Ye, And So Do"</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">THERE was method, of course, behind the difference in
  treatment extended to us and to the Greeks. The motive for making Coutlass
  sell his mules and stay within the miserable confines of the rest-camp was to
  make sure be had money enough to feed himself, and to cut off all opportunity
  for swift escape. Not for a second were the Germans sufficiently unwary to
  admit collusion with him.</p>

  <p>The real ownership of the three mules was left in little doubt when they
  were sold at public auction and bought in by Schillingschen. Fred and Will
  attended the auction the day following our scene in court, and extracted a
  lot of amusement from bidding against Schillingschen, compelling him finally
  to pay a good sum more than the mules were worth.</p>

  <p>Coutlass was in a strange predicament. The looting of Brown's cattle had
  been a bid for fortune on his own account. Yet by causing us to give chase he
  had brought us into the German net more handily than ever they had hoped. So
  it was reasonable on his part to suppose that if he could betray us more
  completely still, he might get rewarded instead of treated as a broken
  tool.</p>

  <p>Yet he did not dare to approach our camp, for fear lest Fred should carry
  out his threat and fight. The fight would certainly be reported by the askari
  on watch at the crossroads, and that would destroy his chance of making
  believe to be in our confidence. So he kept sending notes to me when the
  others were absent, even the native boy who brought them&mdash;not daring to
  enter our camp, but fastening the message to a stone and throwing it in
  through the tent door.</p>

  <p>They were strange, illiterate messages, childishly conceived, varying
  between straight-out offers to help us escape and dark insinuations that he
  knew of something it would pay us well to investigate.</p>

  <p>It was an English missionary spending three days in Muanza on his way to
  Lake Tanganyika, who came to see what he could do for my wound and cleared up
  the mystery quite a little by reporting what he had heard in the non-
  commissioned mess, where he had been invited to eat a meal.</p>

  <p>"The Greek," he said, "is trying to curry favor by pretending he knows
  your plans. If he succeeds in worming into your confidence and persuading you
  to make plans to escape with him, they will feel justified in putting you in
  jail&mdash;and that, I understand, is where they want you."</p>

  <p>"Will you do me a favor?" I asked.</p>

  <p>He hesitated. It was kindness that had sent him down to ease my pain, if
  possible, not anti-Germanism; it was part of German policy to pose as the
  friend of all missionaries, and if anything he was prejudiced against us
  &mdash;particularly against Brown, whom he had visited in jail, and who
  assured him the only hymn he ever sang was "Beer, glorious beer!"</p>

  <p>"That depends," he answered.</p>

  <p>"We are quite sure any letters we write will be opened," I said.</p>

  <p>He answered that he could hardly believe that.</p>

  <p>"If we could send a letter unopened to British East it would solve our
  worst problem," I told him. "If you know of a dependable messenger who would
  carry our letter, I would contribute fifty pounds out of my own pocket to the
  funds of your mission."</p>

  <p>I made a mistake there, and realized it the next moment.</p>

  <p>"What kind of letter is worth fifty pounds?" he asked me. "Isn't it
  something illegal that you fear might get you into worse trouble if opened
  and read?"</p>

  <p>I argued in vain, and only made my case worse by citing as an instance of
  German official turpitude the staff surgeon's neglect of me.</p>

  <p>"But be tells me you refuse to be treated by him!" he answered. "He says
  you enter his hospital and are insolent if he happens to be too busy to
  attend to you at once. He says you refuse to let a native orderly dress your
  wound!"</p>

  <p>He had been entertained to one meal at the commandant's house on the bill,
  and regaled by awful accounts of our ferocity. I did not succeed in inserting
  as much as the thin end of a different view until he asked me how a man's
  name could be professor Schillingschen and his wife's Lady Isobel Saffren
  Waldon.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand about titles," he said. "Shouldn't she take his name,
  or else he hers, or something?"</p>

  <p>I assured him that marriage had never as much as entered the head of
  either of them.</p>

  <p>"They're simply living together," I said. "He's a cynical brute. She's a
  designing female!"</p>

  <p>The missionary mind recoiled and refused to believe me. But after he had
  thought the matter over and seen the probability, he swung over to a sort of
  lame admission that a few more of my statements might perhaps be true.</p>

  <p>"I will take your letter and guarantee its delivery in British East,
  provided I may read it and do not disapprove of its contents." he
  volunteered.</p>

  <p>"That's not unreasonable," I said, "but the letter is in code."</p>

  <p>"I should have to see it decoded."</p>

  <p>I told him to find Fred and Will. He came on them sitting smoking under
  the great rock near the waterfront that bad been inset with a bronze
  medallion of Bismarck, and startled them almost into committing an assault on
  him, by saying that he wanted our secret code at once. They had been trying
  to get tobacco to Brown, and sweetmeats to Kazimoto, had failed in both
  efforts and were short-tempered. He explained after they had insulted him
  sufficiently, and they walked down to the camp one on either hand,
  apologizing all the way. I imagine they had criticized missions of all
  denominations pretty thoroughly.</p>

  <p>In the end he decided not to read the letter at all.</p>

  <p>"I have reached the conclusion you three men are gentlemen," he said, "and
  would not take advantage of me. I will take your letter to Ujiji, and send it
  to the south end of Lake Tanganyika, to be put in the British mail bag for
  Mombasa by way of Durban. It will take a long time to reach its destination
  &mdash;perhaps two months; but I will have it registered, and it will
  undoubtedly get there."</p>

  <p>That he kept his word and better we had ample proof later on, but I did
  not bless him particularly fervidly at the time, for he went straight to the
  doctor and repeated my complaints. He left for Ujiji the next day, and the
  net result of his friendly interference was that the doctor refused me any
  sort of attention at all&mdash;even a change of bandages.</p>

  <p>Fred and Will did their best for me, but it was little. I read in their
  faces, and in their studied cheerfulness when speaking in my presence, that
  they had made up their minds I was going to lose the number of my mess. They
  went to the commandant and the lieutenant besides the doctor in efforts to
  secure for me some sort of consideration, but without result; and they wrote
  at least six letters to the British East African Protectorate government that
  we ascertained afterward never reached their destination. They tried to
  register one letter, but registration was refused.</p>

  <p>"Why don't they jail us simply, and have done with it?"&mdash;Will kept
  wondering aloud.</p>

  <p>"They will when it suits their books," said I. "For the present they
  scarcely dare. Word might reach the British government. They're breaking no
  international law by holding us here and keeping tabs on us."</p>

  <p>Before many days I grew unable to leave the hard cork mattress on the
  camp-bed in Fred's tent. They went again to the commandant, this time
  determined to force the issue.</p>

  <p>"I will send some one," he told them, and they came away delighted that
  strong language should succeed where politeness formerly had failed.</p>

  <p>But all the commandant did send was an askari twice a day, to lean on his
  rifle in the tent door, leer at me, and march away again.</p>

  <p>"He comes to see if I'm dead," said I. "It would be inconvenient to have
  me die in jail; there might be inquiries afterward from British East. After
  I'm dead and buried they'll jail you two healthy ones, and keep you until you
  'blab'!"</p>

  <p>"Why don't we straight out tell 'em we don't know a thing about the
  ivory?" wondered Will.</p>

  <p>"Because they wouldn't believe us!" Fred answered.</p>

  <p>Seven days after the sentry's first call the doctor took to coming in
  person to look at me. He never except once stepped inside the tent, but was
  satisfied to give me a glance of contempt and go away again, once or twice
  taking pains to inspect the Greeks' camp before leaving. He usually had
  Schubert trailing in his wake, and gave him stern orders about sanitation
  which nobody ever carried out. The sanitary conditions of that rest-camp were
  simply non-existent until we came there, and we had gone to no pains on the
  Greeks' account.</p>

  <p>But the Greeks did us an unexpected good turn, though it looked like
  making more trouble for us at the time. They began to complain of lack of
  exercise, and to grow actually sick for want of it. Because of that, and
  jealousy, they raised a clamor about our freedom to go anywhere within
  township limits as against their strict confinement to the camp. The
  commandant came down to the camp in person to hear what they had to say, and
  being in a good humor saw fit to yield a point. Being a military German,
  though, he could not do it without attaching ignominious conditions.</p>

  <p>There was a band attached to the local company of Sudanese&mdash;an affair
  consisting of four native war-drums and two fifes. They knew eight bars of
  one tune, and were proud of it, the fifers blowing with beef and pluck and
  the drummers thundering native fashion, which means that the only difference
  between their noise and a thunder-storm was in the tempo.</p>

  <p>Day after day, twice a day, whether it rained or shone, it seemed to be
  the law that this "band" should patrol the whole township limits, playing its
  only tune, lifting the tops of men's heads with its infernal drumming, and
  delighting nobody except the players and the township urchins, who marched in
  its wake rejoicing.</p>

  <p>The Greeks and the Goanese were given leave to march with the band twice a
  day for the sake of exercise. They refused indignantly. The commandant flew
  into the rage that is the birthright of all German officials, but suddenly
  checked himself; he had a brilliant idea.</p>

  <p>He withdrew the permission and changed it to an order that Coutlass and
  his two friends should march with the band twice daily for the sake of their
  health, on pain of imprisonment should they refuse.</p>

  <p>"And I will prove to you," he said, "that the good German rule is
  impartial. All aliens awaiting trial and confined within the township limits
  shall march with the band if they are able!" As an afterthought he added
  magnanimously: "Those in the jail, too, provided they have not been sentenced
  for serious crimes!"</p>

  <p>So Coutlass, his Greek friend, the Goanese, Fred, Will, and Brown of
  Lumbwa marched about the town twice daily, at seven in the morning and three
  in the afternoon, a journey of five miles, Fred and Will making no objection
  because it gave them a chance to talk with Brown. There were strict orders
  against talking, and four askaris armed with rifles marched behind to enforce
  the rule as well as keep guard over Brown. But the drums were so thunderous
  and the shrill fifes so lusty that the askaris could not hear conversation
  pitched in low tones.</p>

  <p>"Brown says," said Fred, returning from the first march, "that he sleeps
  with only a sheet of corrugated iron between him and the ward where the
  chain-gang lies. He can talk with Kazimoto when be happens to be at that end
  of the chain. They've nothing but planks to lie on, any of them. He says
  Kazimoto seems determined to kill the lieutenant who sentenced him, and as
  soon as he's off the chain we'd better grab him and hurry him out of the
  country."</p>

  <p>"Six months!" said I. "Splendid advice! How many of us will be alive or at
  liberty six months from now? Not I, at any rate!"</p>

  <p>"How d'you suppose they discipline the chain-gang?" Fred asked, ignoring
  my growing hopelessness.</p>

  <p>"With the lash," said I. "I've seen!"</p>

  <p>"That's by day," said Fred. "They've better ways at night. One plan is no
  supper or breakfast; but the champion scheme is the doctor's. On complaint by
  the askaris that a man on the chain has shirked his work, or answered back,
  or been obstreperous, the doctor serves him out a handful of strong pills and
  sees him swallow them. They don't unchain them at night. D'you get the
  idea?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet."</p>

  <p>"Every time the man has to go outside he must wake the whole gang and take
  them with him! They're weary after working twelve hours at a stretch. After
  the second or third time up they begin to object pretty strenuously. After
  the third or fourth time he's so unpopular that he'd almost rather die than
  wake them. Imagine the result, and what he suffers!"</p>

  <p>Despondency began to have hold of me, and I no longer wished to live. The
  doctor's momentary daily visits increased my loathing for the crew who
  tyrannized there in the name of Progress, and I could see no way of
  retaliating. I became seized with a sort of delirious conviction that if only
  I could die and be out of the way my friends would be far better able to
  contrive without me. There is no convalescence in a mood of that sort, and
  each morning found me nearer death than the last. Then malaria developed, to
  give me the finishing touch, and although strangely enough I grew less
  instead of more delirious, Fred and Will at last made no secret of their
  belief that I was doomed.</p>

  <p>I myself was as sure of death as they were of dinner, and had better
  appetite for my fate than they for the meal, when one morning the doctor came
  earlier than usual. He had Schubert with him, and they both peered through
  the tent door. I was alone, for Fred and Will were in the other tent. The
  doctor stepped inside and examined me closely, drawing up the mosquito net to
  see my face. I did not trouble to speak to him, or even to open my eyes after
  the first glimpse. He spoke to Schubert in German, let the net fall again,
  and went away. Schubert spat and rubbed his hands, and swung along after
  him.</p>

  <p>Then I heard Will and Fred arguing.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool!" That was Fred's voice.</p>

  <p>"I tell you I'll tell him!"</p>

  <p>"Fine thing to tell a poor devil that's dying! Let him die in peace!"</p>

  <p>"No. He has guts, for I've seen him use 'em. I shall tell him. You wait
  here!"</p>

  <p>But they both came in, and sat one on either side of my bed.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear what that doctor person said to the sergeant-major?" asked
  Will.</p>

  <p>"I don't talk his beastly language," I answered.</p>

  <p>"He said you'll be dead by this evening! He told Schubert to go and get
  the chain-gang and have them dig your grave at noon instead of laying off for
  dinner. He added they'll have you buried and out of the way by four or five
  o'clock. Then Schubert asked him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No need to tell him that!" Fred objected. But Will was watching my face
  keenly, and went on.</p>

  <p>"Schubert asked him who was to say whether you are dead or not. What d'you
  suppose the answer was?"</p>

  <p>Fred objected again, but Will waved him aside.</p>

  <p>"The answer he gave Schubert was: 'Once he is covered with two meters of
  earth, I shall not hesitate to sign a certificate!'&mdash;So now you know
  what to expect!"</p>

  <p>Will smiled as he watched me. His face was as keen and calm as Fred's was
  troubled.</p>

  <p>"Take more than his guesswork to put you where he'd like to have you
  &mdash;eh?" he laughed. And I sat up.</p>

  <p>Fred began to grin too. "You were right, Will!" he admitted.</p>

  <p>It was not anger that swept over me and gave me new strength. Anger, I
  think, would have hastened the end. It was sudden recognition of my own
  superiority to the devils who knew so little mercy. It was simple inability
  in the last recourse to admit myself able to be their victim. Even my leg
  felt better. I demanded food; and by the time they returned from their
  morning march around the township I had made my boy dress me and was sitting
  up.</p>

  <p>We dated the turn of the tide of our fortunes from that hour. Certainly
  from that day we began to prosper&mdash;at first gradually, but after a while
  in the old swift way that had made all our ventures with Monty such amazingly
  amusing work</p>

  <p>We saw the chain-gang&mdash;Kazimoto last, with a shovel over his
  shoulder&mdash;march away at noon to dig me a grave in the sand close to
  where they burned the township refuse. Fred and Will went and watched them a
  while, contriving to slip a paper of snuff into Kazimoto's hand while he
  rested and let the pick-men labor. (Snuff to a Nyamwezi is as comforting as
  an old sweet pipe to nine white men out of ten.)</p>

  <p>When Schubert came that evening at five with an old sack to put my body
  in, and plenty of askaris to help decide disputes, I was standing up. He
  could not very well make even himself believe that a man who could speak and
  walk was dead, but he could be immensely enraged by what he was pleased to
  call my <i>Schweinespiel</i>.* He cursed me in every language he knew,
  including several native ones, and ended by threatening to make sure of me
  before going to so much trouble a second time.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Schweinespiel</i> (German)&mdash;"dirty game;"
  literally: pig-play.]</p>

  <p>We enraged him still further by laughing at him, and Fred got out his
  concertina that for many days past had lain idle. The first few notes of it
  made me realize more than any other thing could have done what depths of
  despondency we must have plumbed, for hitherto, for as long as I had known
  Fred, he had always been able with that weird instrument of his to rouse his
  own spirits and so stir the rest of us. He resumed old habits now, and gloom
  departed.</p>

  <p>That evening I went to bed like a new man, and for the first night for
  long weeks slept until dawn, awaking hungry. My leg began to mend. We all saw
  the absurdity, if nothing else, of the treatment meted out to us, based on no
  better grounds than our supposed possession of a secret. Laughter brought
  good hope. Hope gave us courage, and courage set Fred and Will hunting for a
  means of escape. We decided there and then that to wait for this Major
  Schunck to come from the coast and pass judgment on us was a ridiculous waste
  of time as well as highly dangerous.</p>

  <p>The first discovery Fred and Will made was that there were footholds cut
  in the great granite rock in which the Bismarck medallion was set. They
  climbed it, and discovered that from the summit they could see all Muanza
  harbor from the shore line to the island in the distance. Sitting up there,
  they presently spotted a native dhow drawn up with bow to the beach with the
  indefinable, yet unescapable air of rather long disuse.</p>

  <p>Resisting the first temptation to hurry along the shore and examine it,
  they returned to camp to tell me of the find, and sent Simba, Kazimoto's
  understudy, to find out whose the dhow was and why it lay there. They
  explained it was a fairly big dhow, and might be laid up there on account of
  leakiness.</p>

  <p>But Simba came back grinning with the news that the dhow belonged to an
  Indian from British East who had been jailed for smuggling. The dhow had been
  sold to pay his court fine, and was now owned by a Punjabi who had bought it
  as a speculation and repented already of his bargain, because the Germans
  would grant him no license to use it and nobody else would buy.</p>

  <p>They went off again to have another distant view of it and to try and
  invent some means of inspecting it closely without betraying their purpose. I
  was already able to walk with the aid of a stick, although not fast enough to
  keep up with them, and curiosity taking hold of me I called two of our
  servants to give me a supporting arm and limped off to see the grave the
  chain-gang had recently dug for me.</p>

  <p>It was a struggle to get there, but it seemed to me the trip was worth it.
  I found the grave about a foot too short, but otherwise commensurate, and sat
  down on a stone beside it to consider a number of things. A convalescent man
  sitting beside his own grave may be forgiven for amusing himself with a lot
  of near-philosophy, and if I trespassed over the borders of common sense on
  that occasion I claim it was not without excuse.</p>

  <p>My meditations were disturbed by the arrival on the scene of the very last
  man I expected. We had been told that Professor Schillingschen had gone out
  on a journey, leaving his "wife" in the care of the commandant; yet I looked
  up suddenly to see him standing on the other side of the grave with both
  hands in the pockets of his knickerbockers and a grin of malevolent amusement
  showing through the tangled mass of hair that hid his lower face.</p>

  <p>"Yours?" he asked.</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"A close call! I have seen closer! I have stood so close to the brink of
  death that the width of an eyelash would have damned me!"</p>

  <p>"Piffle!" I answered rudely. "How can the already damned be damned
  again?"</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"You are sick still. You are petulant. Never mind. I was coming to call on
  you. I watched you leave the camp from the top of that hill behind you, and
  followed. It is better. We can talk here without being overheard. Send those
  natives away!"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not!" I answered, but I reckoned without the professor and the
  fear his hairy presence instilled in them.</p>

  <p>"Go!" he said simply in the native tongue; and although I ordered them at
  once to stay by me they ran back to the camp as fast as their legs could
  carry them.</p>

  <p>"How do you feel now?" the professor asked.</p>

  <p>I stared at him, wondering just what he meant.</p>

  <p>"I mean, without a pistol!"</p>

  <p>I saw the point. The rest-camp was not far away, but as far as I could
  judge we were quite out of sight from it, and unless there should happen to
  be some one hiding among the rocks at the foot of the hill behind me we were
  quite alone, unless, as was probable, he had placed one or two of his own
  hangers-on in hiding within call.</p>

  <p>"This grave should be a lesson to you!" he grinned.</p>

  <p>"It has been," I answered.</p>

  <p>"An illustration," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"A period," said I.</p>

  <p>"To your youth?" he asked maliciously. "To the age of folly?"</p>

  <p>"To the time," I said, "when any man could blackmail me. I would go into
  that grave ten times rather than tell you what you want to know!"</p>

  <p>"There are worse places than the grave!" he said, beginning to leer
  savagely. His eyes glittered. He could scarcely find patience for argument.
  The thin veneer of his first mock-friendliness was gone utterly.</p>

  <p>"I imagine that German colonial life is far worse than death," said I.</p>

  <p>"German will be the only rule in Africa," he answered. "You fools of
  English have set your hopes on the Christian missionary. No weaker-backed
  camel could exist! The German Michael is wiser! Islam is the key to the
  native mind&mdash;Islam and the lash&mdash;they understand that! In a few
  years there will be nothing in Africa that is not German from core to
  epidermis! As to whether you shall live to see that day or not depends on
  yourself, my young friend!"</p>

  <p>Being quite sure that he had a plan in mind that nothing would prevent him
  from unfolding, I did not waste effort or words on prompting him, but sat
  still. My silence and apparent lack of curiosity disturbed him; there is
  nothing your bully likes better than to force his victim into a war of
  words.</p>

  <p>"I will be short and blunt with you!" he began again. "I know your
  history! You were in Portuguese Africa with Lord Montdidier. There he came in
  possession of the secret of Tippoo Tib's ivory; how, I do not yet know, but
  you shall tell me that presently! You and your friends came with him to
  Zanzibar, where you made certain inquiries&mdash;sufficient to set the Sultan
  of Zanzibar by the ears. You left Zanzibar for Mombasa, and for some reason
  that you shall also tell me presently, Lord Montdidier did not leave the ship
  at Mombasa but continued the voyage toward London. Certain individuals
  decided that it would be better not to permit Lord Montdidier to reach Europe
  alive. There were agents charged with the duty of attending to that. It was
  considered safest to throw him overboard into the Mediterranean; men were
  ordered by cable to board the ship at Suez. Yet when the ship reached Suez
  nobody knew anything about him! Tell me where he left the ship, and why!"</p>

  <p>He glared with eyes accustomed to extorting facts from savages, depending
  on physical weakness so to undermine my will that I would give my secret
  away, perhaps without knowing it.</p>

  <p>I lowered my eyes, not being minded to match the strength of my eye-
  muscles against his. The news that Monty had not reached Suez as a matter of
  fact made me feel physically sick. If it were true, it meant most likely that
  he had been the victim of foul play, for that steamer was not scheduled to
  stop anywhere before reaching the Suez Canal. As for the people on the ship
  knowing nothing about him they no doubt preferred not to talk to strangers.
  That sort of news is easily kept under cover for a while. Schillingschen grew
  angry at my silence, and changed his tactics.</p>

  <p>"Where did he leave the ship?" he shouted&mdash;suddenly&mdash;
  savagely.</p>

  <p>I did not answer. He came round to my side of the grave, and laid a heavy
  clenched fist on my shoulder. It seemed to weigh like lead in the weak
  condition I was in.</p>

  <p>"You shall tell me what Lord Montdidier is doing now, or that grave shall
  resemble in your imagination a bed of roses!"</p>

  <p>He seized my neck in a grasp like iron, and squeezed it. I rose suddenly
  and struck him in the stomach with my elbow. Strength had returned more
  swiftly than I had guessed, or perhaps it was indignation at the touch of his
  fingers. At any rate he staggered clear of me, and I thought he would assault
  me now in real earnest; but perhaps he suspected me of having weapons
  concealed somewhere. Instead of rushing at me like an angry bull he calmed
  himself and laughed.</p>

  <p>"You are strong for a man they thought of burying!" he said. "Never mind!
  You shall see reason presently! It is well understood that you and your
  friends know where Tippoo Tib's ivory is hidden. You imagine you can keep the
  secret. If you keep it, you shall never make use of it, my young friend! If
  you choose to tell, you shall be suitably rewarded! Come now&mdash;I thought
  you were going to look for it down in these parts. I admit you fooled me. You
  simply made a false move to draw attention off from Lord Montdidier. Tell me
  where he is and what he does&mdash;and&mdash;or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And what? Or what?" I demanded, as insolently as I knew how. I saw no
  sense in answering him gently.</p>

  <p>"I will show you!"</p>

  <p>I had begun to feel weak again, but he offered me an arm, and since he
  seemed in no hurry I was able to struggle along beside him. We took to the
  main road and when we reached the D.O.A.G. he called for a hammock and some
  porters. Being carried in that way was sheer luxury after the walk in my weak
  state, and I lay back feeling like a tripper on vacation. I saw Fred and Will
  climbing down from their observation post on top of the Bismarck monument,
  but he did not notice them.</p>

  <p>Every German sergeant, and every askari we passed saluted us with about
  twice as much respect as I had ever seen them show the commandant; and
  Schillingschen returned salutes much less carefully than he, merely by a curt
  nod, or one raised finger. Apparently the military feared him, for when we
  passed the commandant, who was personally superintending the flogging of two
  natives in the market-place for not saluting himself, he took several paces
  forward to make sure Schillingschen should see his act of homage. The
  professor merely nodded in return, and I began to I wonder whether there was
  a rift in the lute of Muanza's official good relations. Surely I hoped so.
  Anything calculated to set the Germans' garrison life at odds looked to me
  like the gift of heaven!</p>

  <p>Schillingschen, striding beside the hammock, directed our course along the
  shore-front under palm-trees, planted in stately rows with meticulous
  precision. He kept far enough to one side to avoid the charge of being seen
  walking with me, but from time to time tossed me remarks calculated to keep
  my nerves on edge.</p>

  <p>"What I shall show you is by way of warning!" was a remark he repeated two
  or three times. Then: "A native can always be made to talk by flogging him.
  Some white men need sterner measures!"</p>

  <p>We left the commandant's house on the hill far behind and followed the
  curve of the lake shore, toward a rocky promontory with a clump of thick
  jungle behind it. Fear began to get its work in, until the thought came that
  what he most desired was to make me afraid; then I managed to summon
  sufficient contempt for him and his tribe to regain my nerve and once more
  almost enjoy the promenade.</p>

  <p>He halted the hammock bearers at a spot about three hundred yards away
  from the promontory and, leaving them standing there, turned inland with a
  hand on my arm to give me support and direction. We followed a path that was
  fairly well marked out and trodden, but rough, and several times I should
  have fallen but for his help. My legs still refused any sort of strenuous
  duty.</p>

  <p>"The staff surgeon at this station is a man of ideas," he announced as we
  rounded a big rock and passed down a narrow glade in the jungle. "He is
  original. He is not like some of our official fools. He studies."</p>

  <p>I refused to seem curious, and walked beside him in silence.</p>

  <p>"He studies sleeping sickness. If he can find the key to the solution of
  that scourge it will mean promotion for him. He has noticed that the sleeping
  sickness is always at its worst beside the lake, and putting two and two
  together like a sensible man has reached the conclusion that the disease may
  be propagated in some way in the blood of these things."</p>

  <p>We emerged into a clearing in which a pool more than a hundred yards long
  and nearly as many wide was formed naturally by a hollow in the surface of a
  great sheet of granite. The pool was fed by a trickle of water from a jumble
  of rocks at one end. At the other end the bottom of the pond sloped upward
  gradually, so that a ramp of smooth rock was formed, emerging out of shallow
  water. A stone wall had been built about three feet high to enclose that end
  of the pond, and all the way along both sides the granite had been broken and
  chipped until the edges were sheer and unclimbable.</p>

  <p>"Look!" he said, pointing.</p>

  <p>I looked and grew sick. On the ramp, half in the water and half out lay
  about a hundred crocodiles basking in the sun, their yellow eyes all open.
  They were aware of us, for they began to move slowly higher out of water as
  if they expected something.</p>

  <p>"You see that post?" asked Schillingschen.</p>

  <p>The stump of a dead tree that he referred to stood up nearly straight out
  of a crack in the rock, and a few yards above water level. The crocodiles all
  lay nose toward it, some of them twelve or fourteen feet long, some smaller,
  and some very small indeed, all interested to distraction in the dead tree-
  trunk.</p>

  <p>"That is where he feeds them," Schillingschen announced. "He has tested
  them for hearing, smell, and eyesight. By making fast a living animal to that
  post be has been able to convince himself that from about nine in the morning
  until five in the afternoon their senses are limited. Only occasionally do
  they come and take the bait between those hours. They are hungriest in the
  early morning just before daylight. Recently a large ape tied to the post at
  midday was not killed and eaten until four next morning, and that is about
  the usual thing, although not the rule. Now my proposal is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stepped back and eyed me with the coldest look of appraisal I ever
  sickened under. I blenched at last&mdash;visibly suffered under his eye, and
  he liked it.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;that you tell your secret or be fastened to that post from noon,
  say, until the crocodiles make an end of you!"</p>

  <p>He stepped back a pace farther, perhaps to gloat over my discomfort,
  perhaps from fear of some concealed weapon.</p>

  <p>"You have not much time to arrive at your decision!"</p>

  <p>He took another pace backward. It occurred to me then that he was looking
  for some one he expected. Nobody turning up, he began to gather loose stones
  and throw them at the reptiles, driving them down into deep water, first in
  ones and twos and then by dozens. Most of them swam away to the far side of
  the pool, and hid themselves where it was deep.</p>

  <p>Then, panting with having run, there came a native who looked like a Zulu,
  for he had enormous thighs and the straight up and down carriage, as well as
  facial characteristics.</p>

  <p>"You are late!" shouted Schillingschen in German "<i>Warum?</i> What d'ye
  mean by it?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Warum?</i> (German)&mdash;Why?.]</p>

  <p>The man opened his mouth wide and made grimaces. He had no tongue.
  Schillingschen laughed.</p>

  <p>"This is a servant who does no tattling in the market-place!" he said,
  turning again toward me. "He and I can tie you to that post easily. What do
  you say?"</p>

  <p>There was nothing whatever to say, or to do except wonder how to
  circumvent him, and nothing in sight that could possibly turn into a friend
  &mdash;except a little tuft of faded brown that out of the corner of my eye I
  detected zigzagging toward me in the direction from which we had come. A
  moment later I knew it really was a friend. "Crinkle," a mongrel dog that
  Fred bad adopted the day after our arrival, breasted the low rise, saw me,
  gave a yelp of delight and came scampering.</p>

  <p>The dog sniffed my knee to make sure of me, and then trotted over to sniff
  Schillingschen. The professor stooped down to pat him, rubbed his ear a
  moment to get the dog's confidence, and then seized him suddenly by both hind
  legs. I saw what he intended too late.</p>

  <p>"Stop, or I'll kill you!" I shouted, and made a rush at him. But he swung
  the yelping dog and hurled him far out into the pool.</p>

  <p>A second later my fist crashed into his face and be staggered backward. A
  second later yet the dumb Zulu pinned my elbows from behind and set his knee
  into the small of my back with such terrific force that I yelled with pain.
  Then Schillingschen approached me and began to try to drive my teeth in with
  unaccustomed fists. He loosened my front teeth, but cut his own knuckles, so
  began looking about for a stick.</p>

  <p>Strangely enough my own attention was less fixed on Schillingschen than on
  the wretched "Crinkle" swimming frantically for shore. Dog-like he was making
  straight for me, and there was no possibility whatever of his being able to
  scramble up the steep side. I shouted to call his attention, and tried to
  motion to him to swim toward shallow water, but the Zulu would not let my
  arms free, and the dog only thought I was urging him to hurry.</p>

  <p>Schillingschen found a stick and came back to give me a hammering with it
  just at the moment when a crocodile saw "Crinkle." A blow landed on my head,
  cut my forehead, and sent the blood down into my eyes at the same moment that
  I heard the dog's yelp of agony; and next time I looked at the pond there was
  a tiny whirlpool on the surface, slightly tinged with red.</p>

  <p>"You swine!" I shouted at Schillingschen, trying to break loose and attack
  him. For answer he raised his cudgel in both hands and stood on tiptoe to get
  leverage. If that blow had landed it must have broken something, for he was
  strong as a gorilla; but somebody shouted&mdash;I recognized Fred's voice,
  and in another second he and Will charged down on us. Schillingschen turned
  about to strike Fred instead of me, but Will's fist hit him on the ear and
  split it. The professor staggered backward, and a moment later Fred had
  felled the Zulu. I reeled from weakness and excitement, and nearly fell
  down.</p>

  <p>"Throw him to the crocks, you men!" I urged madly. "He threw Crinkle in.
  Throw him! Nobody'll ever know! He'd have dared throw me in! Nobody comes
  here! Throw him in and trust the crocks to leave no trace!"</p>

  <p>"Shut up, you fool!" growled Fred.</p>

  <p>"Did you see him throw that dog in?" I retorted.</p>

  <p>"No," " he answered, "but I saw him strike you. That's enough! I'll deal
  with him!"</p>

  <p>I suppose Fred intended to knock the professor down and belabor him with
  the same stick be had used on me, but the plan died stillborn. Schillingschen
  bethought him of his hip-pocket, produced a repeating pistol, and leveled
  it.</p>

  <p>"Any nonsense, and I shoot you all!" he announced.</p>

  <p>That ended the battle as far as we were concerned. We had no firearms.
  Schillingschen wasted no time on explanations, but beckoned his Zulu and
  walked off, striding at a great pace and only looking back over his shoulder
  once or twice to make sure we were not in pursuit.</p>

  <p>Fred and Will lent me an arm apiece and we followed slowly, I recounting
  as fast as I could all that had happened, and they trying to chaff me back
  into a sensible frame of mind.</p>

  <p>"That was a decent dog!" I insisted. "He slept on my bed those nights when
  I had fever!"</p>

  <p>"I know it," Fred answered. "Will and I lay and scratched, while you
  rested, with proper flea-food for protection! Don't worry, we'll find you
  another dog!"</p>

  <p>Schillingschen's consideration for my wound had vanished with the chance
  of making use of me. As we emerged into the open we saw him in the distance
  lolling in the hammock he had brought me in.</p>

  <p>"Never mind!" grinned Will. "I'll bet the brute has an earache!"</p>

  <p>"And teeth-ache!" added Fred.</p>

  <p>"And I'll bet he has gone to prepare us a hot reception!" said I. "He owns
  this town!"</p>

  <p>But nothing happened immediately on our return into the town. Actually
  Fred and Will had been outside township limits and could be arrested;
  suspecting foul play as soon as they saw me with Schillingschen, they had
  followed at once. They were as mystified as I when no swift vengeance lit on
  them. We saw Schillingschen carried in the hammock up the steep path leading
  to the commandant's house; but no one came down again. After we got back to
  camp we spent all the rest of the day waiting for the vengeance we felt sure
  was overdue, but none came. Toward evening we even began to grow hopeful
  again and to talk about the dhow. Fred and Will had examined it through
  field-glasses from the top of the rock, and were optimistic 'regarding its
  size and general condition.</p>

  <p>"Even if it leaks rather badly," said Will, "we could reach some island,
  and beach it there, and caulk it."</p>

  <p>"How about that launch, that brought the professor and Lady Saffren
  Waldon?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"What about it?"</p>

  <p>"Couldn't they follow us with that?"</p>

  <p>"You bet they could!" said Will. "We've either got to spike the launch's
  boilers, or give them the complete slip on a dark night!"</p>

  <p>"We might steal the launch!" suggested Fred, but that was too wild a
  proposal to be taken seriously. The launch was the apple of the German
  governmental eye, and the engine crew slept on it always.</p>

  <p>The prospect was unpromising as ever, yet I went to bed and listened to
  the strains of Fred's concertina in the next tent with less foreboding than
  at any time since reaching Muanza, and fell asleep to the tune of Silver
  Hairs among the Gold, a melancholy piece that Will liked to sing when hope or
  courage stirred him.</p>

  <p>I was awakened near midnight of a moonless black night by a hand on my
  bedclothes and the light of a lantern in my eyes.</p>

  <p>"Hus-s-s-h!" said some one. "Don't speak yet! Listen!"</p>

  <p>It was a woman's voice, and it puzzled me indescribably, for a sick man's
  wits don't work swiftly as a rule when he lies between sleeping and
  waking.</p>

  <p>"Listen!" said the voice again. "I must come to terms with you three men!
  You are the only hope left me! I have no friends in Muanza&mdash;and none
  whom I trust! Those Greeks and that Goanese would sell me to the first
  bidder, and these Germans are worse than dogs!"</p>

  <p>"But who are you?" I asked stupidly.</p>

  <p>For answer she held the lantern so that I could see her face. Her hand
  trembled, and the unsteady light threw baffling shadows, but even so I could
  see she looked drawn and aged.</p>

  <p>"Where is your maid, then, Lady Waldon?" I asked, for it seemed to me that
  was one friend who had served her through thick and thin.</p>

  <p>"Ask the commandant!" she answered. "The poor foot thinks he will marry
  her! Little she knows of the German method! I am alone! I have not even a
  servant any longer! I have walked through the shadows from the commandant's
  house, only lighting this lantern after I was inside the hedge. Nobody knows
  I am here. One watchman was asleep; the others did not see me. All you need
  fear is those Greeks. As long as they don't suspect I am here we can talk
  safely."</p>

  <p>I tumbled out of bed on the far side, and went to waken the other two.
  After a hurried consultation we decided my tent was the best for the
  interview, because of the light that had burned in it nearly always while I
  was so deathly ill. We wrapped ourselves in blankets, and Fred went and shook
  Simba awake.</p>

  <p>"Watch those Greeks!" be ordered him. "If they show signs of life, come
  and give the alarm!"</p>

  <p>Then we set Lady Waldon's lantern on the ground in the back of my tent,
  closed the tent up, and foregathered. There was one chair. We three sat on
  the bed.</p>

  <p>"Before we begin," said Fred, "we'd like some kind of proof, Lady Waldon,
  that your overture is honest! I've no need to labor the point. Until now you
  have been our implacable enemy. Why should we believe you are our friend to-
  night ?"</p>

  <p>She sighed. "I don't expect friendship," she answered. "You and I are in
  deep water, and must find a straw that may float us all! If I can help you to
  escape out of the country I will. If you can help me, you must! If you don't
  escape there are worse things in store for you than you imagine! If you tell
  your secret now, they intend to prevent your telling it to any one else
  afterward! And unless you tell they intend to take terrible steps to compel
  you! As for me&mdash;they have discovered that after all I know nothing, and
  am of no further use to them! They have not said so, but it is very clear to
  me how the land lies. Professor Schillingschen is drunk to-night; he came
  home with his car and mouth bleeding, and has plied the whisky bottle freely
  ever since until he fell asleep an hour and a half ago. He boasted over his
  cups. They are simply using this long wait for Major Schunck, who is supposed
  to be coming from the coast, to gather additional evidence against you. They
  have men out following your trail back by the way you came, and if they can
  find no genuine evidence they will invent what they need; the purpose is to
  get you legally behind the bars; and if you ever come out again alive that
  would not be their fault!"</p>

  <p>"What do you propose?" asked Fred.</p>

  <p>"Escape!" she answered excitedly. Then another thought made her clench her
  fists. "Is it possible you told Professor Schillingschen your secret to-day?
  Did one of you tell him? Is that why he is drunk?"</p>

  <p>She saw by our faces that that fear was groundless, but a greater one,
  that she might not be able to convince us, seized her next and she made such
  an excited gesture that the shawl she wore over her head and shoulders fell
  away and her long hair came tumbling down like a witch's.</p>

  <p>"Listen! There is nothing that you men from your point of view could say
  too bad about me! I know! I have been in the pay of Germany for many years,
  but what you don't know is how they got me in the toils and kept me in,
  dragging me down from one degradation to another! They have dragged me down
  so far at last that I am not much more use to them. If we were in British
  territory they would simply expose me to the British government and save
  themselves the trouble of ending my career. They did that to Mrs. Winstin
  Willoughby, and Lord James Rait, and fifty others; it was so easy to put
  incriminating evidence against them in the hands of the public prosecutor.
  Lord James Rait died in Dartmoor Prison&mdash;a common felon. I shall not!
  But believe me&mdash;I am certain as I sit here that they only wait for my
  return to British East! To have me murdered here might start inconvenient
  rumors that would lead to unanswerable questions! It was proposed to me
  to-day that I should return to British East on the launch!"</p>

  <p>"Then why talk about escaping?" Fred wondered. "Why not go?"</p>

  <p>"Because," she hissed emphatically, "don't you see, you stupid!&mdash;if
  they send me back it will be to my doom! My one chance is to escape from
  their clutches&mdash;get into touch with British officials&mdash;and save the
  situation by telling my own tale first!"</p>

  <p>Fred was in no hurry to be convinced. I was already for accepting her
  story and helping her out; but that was perhaps because I was a sick man, too
  recently recovered from the gates of death to care to be hard on any one.</p>

  <p>"I still don't see your danger," Fred told her. "In all my life I fail to
  recall a single instance of the British courts passing a severe sentence on a
  spy. If you'll excuse my saying so, your story about Lord James Rait is
  incorrect. I recall the case well. He got a twenty-year sentence for
  forgery."</p>

  <p>"True!" she answered. "And Mrs. Winstin Willoughby was sentenced to
  fifteen years for theft! Lord James did forge&mdash;in the way of business
  for the German government! Jane Winstin Willoughby did steal&mdash;for the
  same blackguard masters! Do you think they will expose me as a spy? That
  would be too clumsy, even for such bullies as they are! Do you suppose they
  could have dragged me down to this without some sword held over me? They can
  prove that I committed a crime in England several years ago. Oh, yes, I am a
  criminal! I raised a check. It was a check on a German bank, given to me by a
  German on behalf of a countryman of his. I needed money desperately, and the
  man who brought the check to me suggested I should raise it! Since then I
  have tried to repay that money with interest a dozen times, but they have
  always laughed and told me they preferred to leave matters as they are."</p>

  <p>"What would be the use of returning to British territory, then?" asked
  Fred. "If they hold that over you, they can denounce you at any time."</p>

  <p>"Not they!" she answered. "Not if I get there first! I know too much! I
  can tell too much! I can prove too much! If I were once arrested on the
  charge of raising that check, no government in the world would listen to me.
  But if I can tell my story first, and confess about the check, and explain
  why the charge is likely to be brought against me, then there will be Downing
  Street officials who know how to whisper to the German Embassy words that
  will frighten them into silence! I can prove too much against the German
  government, if only I can tell my tale before they crush me!"</p>

  <p>"Why not write it?" asked Fred, and it seemed to me there was humor in his
  eye, but she only detected stubbornness, and laughed scornfully.</p>

  <p>"My own maid even gave them the letters written to me by my sister! If I
  should be suspected of writing they would never rest until they had the
  letter!"</p>

  <p>"Give me your letter to mail!" suggested Fred maliciously.</p>

  <p>"Deluded man!" she sneered. "All the letters you have written since you
  came to Muanza lie in a drawer in the commandant's desk! I myself have read
  them!"</p>

  <p>In the dark, with shifting shadows thrown by the cheap trade lantern, it
  was difficult to judge what was going on behind that beard of Fred's. I had
  begun to suspect he was coming over to my way of thinking and would yield to
  her presently, but he returned to the attack&mdash;very directly and
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>"What is it you know against the German government?" he demanded, and sat
  with his jaw in the palm of his hand waiting for her answer.</p>

  <p>"Why should I tell you? Why should I put myself completely in your
  power?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" asked Fred.</p>

  <p>"What would prevent you from stealing my thunder, and telling my story as
  your own&mdash;leaving me at the Germans' mercy?"</p>

  <p>"Something very potent that I think you would not understand if I talked
  of it," Fred answered. "Listen to me now a minute. I haven't conferred with
  my friends here, as you know. Whatever I tell you is subject to their
  agreeing with me. The only condition on which I, for one, would consent to
  taking part with you in anything&mdash;after all our experience of you!
  &mdash;would be that you should put yourself so completely in our power that
  we could feel we had your safekeeping. On those terms I would be willing to
  do my best to help you out."</p>

  <p>"I agree to that like a shot!" said Will; and I nodded.</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"All or nothing!" Fred insisted.</p>

  <p>"You mean that you also, just like these Germans, must have a sword to
  hold over me?"</p>

  <p>"I thought you wouldn't understand!" Fred answered. "What we demand, Lady
  Saffren Walden, is proof that you really do give us your confidence. Without
  that we have nothing to say to you, and nothing to do with you!"</p>

  <p>She broke down then and cried a little, tearing herself with sobs she
  hated to release. Suddenly she raised her head and glared at us wildly, dry-
  eyed; not a tear had accompanied the sobbing.</p>

  <p>"If I tell you&mdash;if you fail me after that&mdash;I shall kill myself
  in such way that you shall know&mdash;my blood is on your heads!"</p>

  <p>Fred laughed. It was no doubt the best thing to do, but I wondered how he
  managed it.</p>

  <p>"Suppose you begin by telling us," he said. "We can discuss the blood-
  stains afterward!"</p>

  <p>Then she suddenly burst into her tale, as if she had rehearsed it a
  hundred times in readiness to pour into the ears of the first British
  official who had power enough to shield her. She told it dramatically, in few
  words, wasting no breath on side-issues, and without once pausing to explain,
  letting her words smash down the barriers of unbelief and pave their own way
  for explanations afterward.</p>

  <p>"Germany is planning to conquer the world!&mdash;not now, but ten or a
  dozen years from now! She is getting ready ceaselessly! Part of the plan is
  to undermine British rule in Africa by means of a religious influence among
  the natives. That is the special duty of Professor Schillingschen. As soon as
  possible a great native army is to be trained, and thoroughly schooled in the
  fanatical precepts of Islam. But the German people are too heavily taxed
  already, and refuse to vote money for this miserable colony, where the great
  beginning must be made because it is only here that they can work
  unsuspected. So funds must be found in some other way!"</p>

  <p>She paused for breath. No woman pleading at the bar of justice could have
  seemed more in earnest. Of one thing I was quite sure: she had found it worth
  her while to convince us if that were possible. She was playing no
  half-hearted game.</p>

  <p>"Do you begin to see now why the Germans are so set on finding Tippoo
  Tib's hoard of ivory? Do you begin to understand why they are determined, not
  only to prevent your finding it, but to learn your secret? If rumor is
  one-half true, the Arab buried somewhere enough ivory to finance this plan of
  theirs! They have been going about the search systematically, and sooner or
  later they feel they must stumble on it. They will not let you forestall
  them!"</p>

  <p>She paused again. Her very earnestness exhausted her more than the walk
  through the dark in danger had done.</p>

  <p>"Take your time," Fred advised her. "We're all listening!"</p>

  <p>"When I told you in Nairobi that Lord Montdidier had been murdered, I
  believed I was so near the truth that you would never know the difference. I
  knew the order had been given to have him killed on board ship&mdash;given by
  men who are accustomed to be obeyed&mdash;who do not excuse failure on any
  ground. They feared he might be going to divulge the secret of the ivory to
  his government in London. Oh, I tell you they stop at nothing! To-day London
  is the ivory market of the world, but they have their arrangements made for
  transferring that center of trade to Hamburg! They mean first to crush
  competitors, and then monopolize! They hope the ivory is in this country. In
  that case their task will be easy. But if it should be found in British East,
  they are all ready with the necessary men of influence to apply for a mining
  or agricultural concession, and they will fence that place off so thoroughly
  that no one will ever be the wiser until they have carried the ivory out of
  the country!"</p>

  <p>"They could never get it out of British East without the government
  knowing," objected Fred; but she laughed at him.</p>

  <p>"If worse came to the worst, they are ready with an offer to exchange ten
  times the territory elsewhere for just that small section of the country.
  They would give up German New Guinea, or Southwest Africa&mdash;anything!
  They have fooled the French and Russian governments until they are ready to
  bring pressure to bear on England diplomatically to induce her to make almost
  any bargain of that kind that the Germans want. They are even willing to
  concede to England the whole of Abyssinia, which nobody owns yet, and to back
  her up against the claims of France and Italy! Why should they not be willing
  to make temporary concessions, when all Africa is to be theirs in ten years'
  time! They will give to-day, and with the help of the money that ivory will
  bring they will create an army that shall take away to-morrow!"</p>

  <p>"But how can you prove all this?" Fred asked her.</p>

  <p>"How? I know the names of the men who are preaching Germany's sermons all
  through British East! I know all Schillingschen's secrets! Why should I not?
  I have suffered enough! He is a drunken brute nearly always after the sun
  goes down, and his caresses are disgusting; I have endured them until I know
  all he knows! Now he realizes that I know his secrets and have none of my own
  to tell, so he hopes to send me to my doom at the hands of the government I
  have betrayed too many times! What is the use of my pretending to be better
  than I am? I am a spy&mdash;a traitress&mdash;a divorced woman with worse
  than no reputation! I am not a person likely to be shown much mercy! I never
  would have recanted unless the end of my rope had come! Now I know I must buy
  my pardon&mdash;I must earn it&mdash;I must pay for it with solid value!
  Luckily I can do that! I do not ask you men for mercy. I know what is in
  store for you if you do not escape! I offer to help you to escape, in
  exchange for helping me!"</p>

  <p>"Better be more precise!" suggested Fred. "Exactly what is in store for
  us?"</p>

  <p>She pointed her finger at me. "You went out of bounds to-day with
  Schillingschen! Well and good; he was with you. But you, and you&mdash;" She
  pointed at Fred and Will. "&mdash;went without permission. Why do you suppose
  they over-looked such a splendid chance of jailing you legally?
  Schillingschen came up to the commandant's house in a towering passion,
  demanding the immediate arrest and close confinement of all three of you. He
  was only persuaded to wait a few days longer because a runner has come in
  with word that the bodies of several Masai whom you shot on this side of the
  German border have been found! The bones&mdash;the bullets found among the
  bones&mdash;and cartridge cases that will fit your rifles are being brought
  to Muanza! After that&mdash;the deluge, my friends! That is why Professor
  Schillingschen gets drunk and sings himself to sleep in spite of your being
  still at liberty! Either escape before that evidence reaches Muanza, or make
  up your minds for the worst! It is growing late&mdash;answer me&mdash;do you
  agree?"</p>

  <p>Fred glanced once at each of us. We both nodded.</p>

  <p>"We agree with reservations," he said.</p>

  <p>"What are they? Man&mdash;don't be a fool! Don't fritter the lives of all
  of us away!"</p>

  <p>"They're simple. We've a friend in the jail here. His name's Brown."</p>

  <p>"That drunkard? Leave him! He's worthless!"</p>

  <p>"We've a servant on the chain-gang. His name is Kazimoto."</p>

  <p>"A nigger? You'd risk another day in this place for a nigger? How absurd!
  They're never grateful. They don't see things from the white man's
  standpoint. They don't expect ideal treatment. Leave him his wages and tell
  him to follow when they let him off the chain!"</p>

  <p>"And we have a string of porters," Fred continued. "We will not leave
  Muanza without the porters, our man Kazimoto, and Mr. Brown of Lumbwa!"</p>

  <p>"You are mad! You are crazy!"</p>

  <p>"We are the men you have invited to trust you," Fred answered kindly.
  "Those are our conditions. We will not 'bate one iota! Take 'em or leave 'em,
  Lady Waldon!"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10">CHAPTER 10</a></h2>

  <p class="poem">Lean, loveless, hungry lanes are these!<br>
  The longest has an end.<br>
  Ill luck tasted to the bitter lees<br>
  Soonest shall mend.<br>
  From out the foe's ranks if Heaven please<br>
  Shall come your friend.<br>
  <br>
  &mdash;<i>In Hoc Signo Vade</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">WE came to no fixed decision that night, although we knew
  there was no alternative. She held out, in the vain hope of making us agree
  to leave Kazimoto and Brown behind. The porters, she agreed, might come in
  very handy, although it was at least doubtful that we should be able to slip
  out of Muanza by land. The Germans had taken latterly to counting our porters
  every morning, to supplying them with ration money once every day, and to
  sending the bill to us by an askari, who waited for the cash. At any rate,
  she conceded the porters, provided we would leave the two others behind. And
  of course we were adamant.</p>

  <p>She left us an hour and a half before dawn, we letting her return alone
  because of the greater danger of detection if we had tried to escort her. It
  was after she had gone, while we sat listening for the sound of a challenge
  that would have ruined all her hopes, if not ours, that Will conceived the
  bright idea which finally saved us.</p>

  <p>"The Heinies don't know that we're wise to their game," he said
  cheerfully. His ears were sticking out from his head and he had the naughty
  boy look that always presaged wisdom. "Why don't we play that card for all
  it's worth?"</p>

  <p>"We need five cards to make even a poker hand," Fred objected.</p>

  <p>"Will a full house suit you&mdash;aces and queens?" he answered. "I've
  named you one ace already. Ace number two is the fact that these German
  officials are brutes pure and simple&mdash;brutes who don't understand how to
  be anything else, with brutal low cunning and no other cleverness."</p>

  <p>"That sounds like the joker!" said Fred.</p>

  <p>"It's ace number two, I tell you! The third is the fact that Brown of
  Lumbwa can talk with Kazimoto in the night through that corrugated iron
  partition! Three aces&mdash;count 'em&mdash;one, two, three! Queens? One of
  'em left a few minutes ago! The other's the dhow! We'll call that blessed
  boat the Queen of Sheba for luck! The Queen of Sheba got to her journey's
  end, and found more than she expected, and by the lights of little old
  Broadway, so shall we! I've dealt the cards&mdash;is it up to me to play
  them?"</p>

  <p>"Your hand, America! Talk it over first, though! There's an awful lot
  hangs on the game!" said Fred.</p>

  <p>I fell asleep while they argued over the points of Will's strategy. Africa
  is a land of sudden death and swift recoveries, but for a convalescent man I
  had been through a strenuous day and had right to be tired out. It was broad
  daylight when I awoke, and breakfast was ready. Fred and Will had returned
  from their march around the township with the native band, and to my surprise
  the commandant was standing in front of their tent, talking with them. I
  threw on a jacket and joined them at table.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand you," said the commandant. "Either talk German or
  speak more slowly!"</p>

  <p>Will took a purchase on his stock of patience and began again.</p>

  <p>"If our porters run away, you'll blame us. We don't care to be blamed for
  what is none of our fault. So if you don't put 'em all on a chain and lock
  'em up nights, we're going to discontinue paying for their keep. That's flat!
  You can work 'em if you like. Let 'em help keep the township clean. We'll pay
  their board and wages as long as you're responsible for their not escaping!
  And say! If you want to get real work out of 'em I'll give you a tip. There
  never was a savage like that Kazimoto of ours for getting results out of that
  gang. Put him on the same chain with the lot of 'em, and we'll all be
  satisfied! I don't presume to be running your jail, but I'm telling you facts
  that'll hurt nobody. Those porters 'ud be a darn sight better off with plenty
  of exercise."</p>

  <p>"Do I understand you to ask that your porters be made prisoners?" asked
  the commandant.</p>

  <p>"You get me exactly!" said Will.</p>

  <p>The commandant grunted, nodded, waited for us to get up and salute him,
  grunted again with disgust when we did nothing of the sort, turned on his
  heel, and walked off. We spent an hour on tenterhooks, and I began to believe
  the German had simply become more suspicious than ever and would keep closer
  watch on us without troubling at all about the men. But at the end of an hour
  we saw the porters rounded up, and a chain fetched out that was long enough
  to hold them all. They disappeared within the boma wall. Ten minutes later
  suddenly Will pointed toward the southward.</p>

  <p>"Look! See what happens when the roofs of shanty-town take fire!"</p>

  <p>Flames went up from the dry grass roof of one of the rectangular Swahili
  huts. Within thirty seconds the askaris on guard at the boma began firing
  their rifles in the air as fast as they could pull the trigger and reload.
  Within two minutes the chain-gang was headed for jail, where it was locked
  behind doors, in order that every askari in Muanza might be free to pile arms
  and hurry to the fire. It was not only askaris; the whole township turned out
  as to the circus, with Schubert and his long kiboko ruling the riot. The
  other sergeants were in evidence, but quiet, imperturbable men compared to
  their <i>Feldwebel</i>, plying their kibokos without wasting words, stirring
  the whole world within their reach into action&mdash;if not orderly and
  purposeful, action, at least.</p>

  <p>Schubert climbed on a roof well to windward and safe from the sparks, and
  directed proceedings in a voice that out-thundered the mob's roar and
  crackling flames. To illustrate his meaning he seized handfuls of the thatch
  on which he stood and tore them out, to the huge discontent of the owner. The
  crowd saw what he wanted and began at once tearing off roofs in a wide circle
  around the fire so as to isolate it, Schubert demonstrating until scarcely a
  handful of thatch remained on the roof he honored and he had to stand
  awkwardly on the crisscross poles, while the owner and his women wept.</p>

  <p>Within ten minutes after the commencement of the fire there was under way
  a regular orgy of roof pulling. Whoever had an enemy ran and tore his roof
  off, and there were several instances of reciprocity, two families tearing
  off each other's roofs, each believing the other to be at the fire.</p>

  <p>Muanza was a furious place&mdash;a riot&mdash;a home of din and tumult
  while the fire lasted, and when it was put out it took another hour to stop
  the fights between victims of the flames and unofficial salvage-men.</p>

  <p>"D'ye get the idea of it?" asked Will. "D'ye see the Achilles heel?"</p>

  <p>In that second, I believe, Fred Oakes and I betrayed ourselves genuine
  adventurers. Any fool could have talked glibly about setting the town on
  fire; any coward could have yelped about the danger of it, and improbability
  of success. It needed adventurers to size up instantly all the odds against
  the idea, recognize the one infinitesimal chance, and plump for it. And we
  were there!</p>

  <p>"It's the only chance we've got!" agreed Fred. "I'm for it! Lead on
  America!"</p>

  <p>"I believe we can pull it off!" said I. "I'm game!"</p>

  <p>After that it seemed like waste of time to talk, yet every single detail
  of our plan had to be thought out beforehand and mentally rehearsed, if we
  hoped to have even the one slim chance we built on. Luckily Professor
  Schillingschen continued drunk, which meant that he would sleep early and
  give Lady Waldon another chance to pay us a nocturnal visit. One of our boys
  told us that according to market gossips the commandant was drinking with him
  and the two of them were watching a sort of prolonged native nautch* they had
  staged in seclusion on the hill.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>nautch</i> (Hindi)&mdash;an intricate traditional
  dance in India performed by professional dancing (nautch) girls. <i><a href=

  <p>The next day we learned there was to be a murder trial of no less than
  nine men&mdash;an event likely to keep the whole garrison's attention drawn
  away from us. And after the trial would come the hanging (it would have been
  impossible to convince any one, German or native, that the verdict and
  sentence were not foregone conclusions). The stars in their courses appeared
  to be on our side. For several nights to come the worst the moon could do
  would be to show a sliver of silver crescent for an hour or two.</p>

  <p>Lady Waldon came earlier that night. When we outlined our plan to her
  roughly she argued against it at first&mdash;and it was impossible far-
  fetched&mdash;ridiculous. She insisted again on our simply sneaking away by
  night with her. But Fred wasted no time on argument, and took the upper
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Take us or leave us, Lady Waldon, as we are! We've an unwritten rule that
  none of us has ever thought of breaking, that binds us to obey the member of
  the party whose plan we have adopted. On this occasion we have agreed to Mr.
  Yerkes' plan, and you've got to obey him implicitly if you want to have part
  with us! We will not leave our men or Brown of Lumbwa behind, and we will not
  change the plan by a hair's breadth! Will you or won't you obey?"</p>

  <p>She yielded then very quickly. It seemed a relief to her at last to
  subject her views to those of men whose purpose was merely honest. Will took
  up the reins at once.</p>

  <p>"We've talked over buying the boat," he said, "but that's hopeless. The
  more we paid for it the louder the owner would brag. The Germans would be
  'on' in a minute. We've simply got to steal it. It's up to you to find out
  the man's proper name and address, and we'll send him the money from the
  first British post-office we reach."</p>

  <p>"Don Quixote de la Mancha!" she said critically. "Well&mdash;we steal the
  boat and you pay for it afterward. The owner will think you are crazy, and if
  the Germans ever discover it they will take the money away from him by some
  legal process. But go on!"</p>

  <p>"We've plenty of money," said Will, "so there's no need to worry about too
  many supplies to begin with. But we'll need scant rations for ourselves and
  all our men until we reach some place where more are to be bought. And we've
  got to get them on board the dhow secretly. The first question is, how to do
  that."</p>

  <p>She told us at once of a path going round by the back of the hill behind
  us, that would make the trip to the dhow in the dark a matter of over two
  miles, but that avoided all sentries and habitations. We agreed that all
  three of us should climb to the top of the hill, which was not out of bounds
  &mdash;and study the track next morning. On the fateful night we must take
  our chance, just as she had done, of avoiding the sleepy-eyed sentry who kept
  watch over the Greeks.</p>

  <p>"We'll talk to Brown of Lumbwa on the morning and afternoon march around
  the township," Will went on. "Brown must whisper to Kazimoto through the
  corrugated iron partition in the jail at night, and have them all ready to
  break loose at the signal and bring him along with them. We must be careful
  to show Brown just where the dhow is. He has been sober quite a while. Maybe
  he'll remember if we direct him carefully."</p>

  <p>"What is to be the signal?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Just what I'm coming to," said Will. "A fire-alarm on the first windy
  night! The next question is, who is to start the fire? We'll need a good one!
  Yet if we do it, we're likely to be caught by the crowd coming running to
  deal with it."</p>

  <p>"Coutlass!" she answered suddenly. "Coutlass and his two friends!"</p>

  <p>"You'll perhaps pardon me," Fred answered, "but none of us would trust
  those Greeks as far as a hen could swim in alcohol!"</p>

  <p>"Yet you must! Leave them to me! They don't know that the sand in my glass
  has run down. Let me go to them presently, pretending that I went direct to
  them and am afraid of being seen by you. I will tell them that the Germans
  want a good excuse for putting you three men in jail and that they will he
  sent away free as a reward if they will start a fire and charge you afterward
  with arson! I will tell them to choose the first windy night, so as to have a
  really spectacular blaze worth committing perjury about!"</p>

  <p>"Better arrange a signal," Will advised. "They might otherwise fire before
  we were ready!"</p>

  <p>"Very well. You men give me the word at midday of the day of the start,
  and I will spread red, white and blue laundry on the roof of the commandant's
  house for the Greeks to see."</p>

  <p>"Good enough!" agreed Will. "Now one more stunt! We simply must have
  firearms. The Germans have taken ours away and locked them up. At a pinch I
  suppose we could manage with one rifle, provided we had lots of ammunition.
  We would rather have one each. In fact, the more the merrier. One we must
  have! What about it?"</p>

  <p>She thought for several minutes. At last she told us that one of the
  commandant's rifles and one of Schillingschen's stood leaning in a corner of
  the living-room beside a book-case. Whether she could make away with one or
  both of those without detection she did not know, and she would have to use
  her wits regarding ammunition. It was always kept locked up.</p>

  <p>"Why not kill an askari and take his rifle and cartridges?" she asked.
  "The sentry on duty watching the Greeks will be in the way. Knock him on the
  head from behind!"</p>

  <p>"Thank you!" grinned Will, exchanging glances with us. "We shall have
  about enough on our consciences setting fire to half the township. We'll not
  kill except in self-defense."</p>

  <p>"But you won't set the town on fire! The Greeks will do that!"</p>

  <p>"Don't let's argue ethics!" Fred interrupted, for Will's cars were getting
  red. "Can you tell us for certain, Lady Waldon, whether all the askaris and
  German sergeants really run to a fire? Or do a certain number remain in the
  boma?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know about that," she answered. "Until the prisoners are all locked
  in&mdash;that is to say, in case of fire in the daytime&mdash;six or eight
  askaris remain inside the boma. The minute they are locked in, if the fire is
  serious, and in case of fire by night, they all go except two, who stand on
  the eastern boma wall, one at each corner. From there they are supposed to be
  able to see on every side except the water-front. Nobody guards the
  water-front; I don't know why, unless it is that the gate on that side is
  kept locked almost always and the wall runs along the water's edge."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," said I, "those two sentries on the wall will be too
  busy staring at the fire, if the Greeks really make a big one, to see
  anything else unless we march by under their noses with a brass band."</p>

  <p>"Bah!" sneered Lady Waldon. "If I get that rifle I would dare shoot them
  both for you myself!"</p>

  <p>"If you overstep one detail of Will's plan, I guarantee to put you ashore
  on the first barren island we come to!" said Fred. "Leave shooting to
  us!"</p>

  <p>The next problem was to draw away from the Greeks the attention of the
  askari at the cross-roads. We could not see him, for it was one of those
  black African nights when the stars look like tiny pin-pricks and there are
  no shadows because all is dark. To go out and look what he was doing would
  have been to arouse his suspicion. Yet there was always a chance that he
  might be patrolling down near the Greek camp; doubtless acting on orders, he
  had a trick of approaching their tents very closely once in a while.</p>

  <p>So when Lady Waldon had slipped out into the darkness we lit half a dozen
  lamps and started a concert, Fred playing and we singing the sort of tunes
  that black men love. He took the bait, hook, sinker, and all; in the silence
  at the end of the first song we heard his butt ground on the gravel just
  beyond the cactus hedge in front of us; and there he stayed, we entertaining
  him for an hour. By that time we were quite sure that Lady Waldon had passed
  along the road behind him; so Fred went out and gave him tobacco.</p>

  <p>"It's time you went and looked at those Greeks again!" he advised him.
  "You would be in trouble if they slipped away in the night!"</p>

  <p>Now that a plan of campaign was finally decided on, there seemed much less
  to do than we had feared. Mapping out in our minds the way round the back of
  the hill to the dhow was perfectly simple; we went and smoked on the hilltop,
  and within an hour after breakfast had every turn and twist memorized. Fred
  drew a chart of the track for safety's sake.</p>

  <p>Persuading Brown of Lumbwa proved unexpectedly to be much the most
  difficult task. Added to the fact that the askaris who marched behind and the
  Greeks who marched in front were unusually inquisitive, Brown himself was
  afraid.</p>

  <p>"We'll all be shot in the dark!" he objected.</p>

  <p>"Would you rather," Will asked, "be shot in the dark with a run for 'your
  money, or fed to the crocks in the doctor's pond?" And be told him about the
  crocodiles to encourage him.</p>

  <p>"They'll have to let me out of jail at the end of the month," Brown
  argued.</p>

  <p>"Don't you believe it! In less than a week from now we'll all be in on one
  and the same charge of filibustering! They'll not let you go back to British
  East to tell tales about their treatment of the rest of us," Will assured
  him.</p>

  <p>But Brown proved tinged with a little streak of yellow somewhere. It was
  not until the afternoon march that Fred and Will, one on either side of him,
  by appeals to his racial instinct and recalling the methods of the military
  court, induced him to do his part. Once having promised he vowed he would see
  the thing through to the end; but he was the weak link; he was afraid; and he
  disbelieved in the wisdom of the attempt.</p>

  <p>It was Kazimoto in the end who kept Brown up to the mark, and shamed him
  into action by superior courage. Fred found a chance to speak to him as the
  long string rested at noon under the narrow shade of a cactus hedge, and
  warned him in about fifty words of what was intended. (The askaris, almost as
  leg-weary as the gang, were sprawling at the far end of the line, gambling at
  pitch-and-toss.)</p>

  <p>"Be sure you sleep as near to the partition as you can. Get details of the
  plan from Mr. Brown, and then drill the porters one by one! Don't let them
  tell one another. You tell each one of them yourself!"</p>

  <p>Then he walked down the line and ordered the porters in a loud voice to
  obey the askaris implicitly, and to work harder in return for the good food
  and care they were getting, winking at the same time very emphatically, with
  the eye the askaris could not see.</p>

  <p>The night work was the hardest., because, although we were quite sure
  about direction, even in the dark, it was another matter to feel our way and
  carry unaccustomed loads. By day we decided what to take and what to leave
  behind, and we cut down what to take with us to the irreducible, dangerous
  minimum. Then we broke that up into thirty-or forty-pound packages, so that
  when we all three made the trip to the dhow the most we took at one time was
  about a hundred pounds' weight. In the condition I was in I could take not
  more than one trip to the others' two; after the first it was agreed that I
  would better stay behind and keep an eye on the askari. The minute he showed
  symptoms of becoming inquisitive I was to invent some way of keeping his
  attention; so all unsuspected by him I lay in the sand by the roadside within
  three yards of him, while the ants crawled over me and he dozed leaning on
  his rifle. Once a long snake crawled over my wrist and my very marrow curdled
  with fear and loathing; but except for mosquitoes, who were legion and sucked
  their fill, there was no other contretemps. I don't know what I would have
  done if the askari had taken alarm and set off to investigate. I trusted to
  intuition should that happen.</p>

  <p>The work of arranging the stuff in the dhow was the most difficult of all,
  because we dared not light a lantern, yet we also dared not stow things
  carelessly for fear of confusion when the hour of action came. The space was
  ridiculously small for ourselves and all those men, and every inch had to be
  economized. In addition to that the dhow had to be worked backward off the
  mud far enough to be shoved off easily, and then made fast by a rope to the
  bushes in such way as not to be noticeable. Most of the ropes turned out to
  be rather rotten, and we could only guess at the condition of the sails; the
  feel of them in the dark gave us small assurance. But fortunately we had a
  couple of hundred feet of good half-inch manila in camp with us, and that
  Fred and Will took out and stowed in the hold the night following.</p>

  <p>We bought such things at the D.O.A.G. as we could without arousing
  suspicion, as, for instance, a quantity of German dried pea-soup&mdash;not
  that the porters would take to it kindly, but it would go a long way among
  them at a pinch. Live stock we did not dare buy, for fear of the noise it
  would make; but we laid in some eggs and bananas. Most of the thirty-pound
  loads were rice.</p>

  <p>It troubled us sorely to leave our good tents, beds, and equipment behind,
  yet all we could take was the blankets and one Gladstone bag packed with
  clothes for us all. Kettles and pots and pans were a noisy nuisance, yet we
  had to have them, and blankets for all those porters, who would escape from
  jail practically naked, were an essential; but fortunately we had a
  sixty-pound bale of trade-blankets among our loads.</p>

  <p>Not one word did we exchange all this while with Coutlass and his friends.
  Not one overture did we make to them, or they to us. But there was no doubt
  of their intention to do their worst. They gloated over us&mdash;eyed us with
  lofty disdain and scornful superior knowledge. They were so full of the
  notion of having us jailed for their misdeed that they positively ached to
  come and jeer at us, and I believe were only saved from doing that by the
  shortness of the time.</p>

  <p>At last, three days after decision had been reached, we threw our blankets
  with a red one uppermost over the top of both tents in the sun; and within
  thirty minutes after that Lady Saffren Waldon had spread on the commandant's
  roof a blue cotton dress, a white petticoat, and a blazing red piece of
  silken stuff. There and then the Greeks and the Goanese pledged one another
  out in the open with copious draughts in turn from the neck of one whisky
  bottle, and we began to pray they might not get too drunk before night.
  Judging by their meaning glances at us, they considered us their mortal and
  cruel enemies whom it would be an act of sublime virtue to bring to book.</p>

  <p>The trial of the natives for murder had taken place, accompanied by the
  usual amount of thrashing of witnesses and the usual stir throughout the
  countryside. These were charged with having murdered an askari near their
  village&mdash;a big bully sent to arrest a man, who had taken leave to help
  himself to more than rations, and had made a lot too free with the village
  women. So German military honor had to be upheld exemplarily. Condign
  vengeance was sure and swift. The execution was to take place on the
  drill-ground on the day we chose for our departure.</p>

  <p>There was no risk of investigations that day. Had we known it, we could
  have gone away in all likelihood in broad daylight, so busy was the garrison
  in marshaling into place and policing the swarms of villagers brought in from
  as far as sixty miles away to witness German justice. Even the customary
  parade of the band was canceled for that occasion, and that was our only real
  ground for uneasiness, for it prevented our having a last talk with Brown of
  Lumbwa and assuring ourselves that courage would not fail him in the
  pinch.</p>

  <p>We worried in plenty without cause, as it seems that humans must do on the
  eve of putting plans, however well laid, to the test. We had a thousand
  scares&mdash;a thousand doubts&mdash;and overlooked at least a thousand
  evidences that fortune favored us. Toward the end our hearts turned to water
  at the thought that Kazimoto would probably fail to do his part, although why
  we should have doubted him after his faithful record, and knowing his hatred
  of German rule, we would have found it hard to say.</p>

  <p>Several times that morning we showed ourselves about the town, with the
  purpose of allaying any possible suspicion and saving the authorities the
  trouble of asking what we were up to. With the same end in view we attended
  the execution in the afternoon, and sincerely wished before it was over that
  we had stayed away.</p>

  <p>On this occasion even the chain-gangs were included among the spectators,
  in the front row, on the ground that, being proved criminals, they needed the
  lesson more than the hempen-noose-food not yet caught and tried and brought
  to book.</p>

  <p>The same sort of sermon, only this time more fiery and full of ranting
  humbug about German righteousness, was preached by the commandant. The
  miserable victims had received a simple death sentence, but he explained that
  in virtue of his superior office be had seen fit to add to it. "Death" he
  explained, "would certainly rid the German protectorate of such
  conscienceless scalawags as these, but might not be enough to discourage the
  bad element that disliked German rule. Natives must be taught that the very
  name of all that is German must be reverenced, and that German punishment is
  as terrible and sure as the German arm is long! And be sure of this!" he
  continued. "The ear of the German government is as far-reaching as its arm!
  In your villages&mdash;in your homes&mdash;in your families&mdash;there is
  always an agent of the government listening! Your own brother&mdash;your
  wife&mdash;your child may be that agent of the government! Now, watch
  carefully and see what happens to men with bad hearts&mdash;aye, and to women
  with bad hearts, who conspire against German rule!"</p>

  <p>What followed was more impressive because of the determination we had
  heard of to bring all Africa under the German yoke. In vain should the
  wretched natives in after years escape by the hundreds northward in the hope
  of living under British government. The fools&mdash;the "easy people"
  &mdash;the "folk who gave without a price"&mdash;the "truth tellers"
  &mdash;the "men who wish to forget"&mdash;the unwise, cocksure,
  cleaner-living, unbelievably credulous, foolishly honest British officials
  would be all gone. The <i>Pickelhaube</i>* and the lash, blackmail and
  coercion would take the place of generosity. Africa would better be back
  under the Arabs again, for the Arabs had no system to speak of and were
  inefficient. Some Arabs have a heart&mdash;some a very soft heart.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Pickelhaube</i> (German)&mdash;a spiked
  helmet.]</p>

  <p>The crowd grew bright-eyed, little children straining forward between
  their elders in the bull-fight frenzy&mdash;that same intoxication of the
  senses that held the Roman freemen spellbound at the sight of suffering.</p>

  <p>One at a time, that the last might see the torture of the first, the
  victims were noosed by the heel (one heel)&mdash;thrown with a jerk&mdash;
  hauled heel-first to the overhanging branch&mdash;and flogged into
  unconsciousness with slow blows, the lieutenant standing by to reprove the
  askaris if they struck too fast, for that would have been merciful. Not until
  the victims ceased to struggle were they lowered and thrown on the ground, to
  lie bleeding, awaiting their turn to be hanged.</p>

  <p>The last two&mdash;supposed to have been the culprits who actually held
  the spear that pierced the marauding askari's heart&mdash;were hauled up
  heel-to-heel together, and hanged presently in the same noose, the commandant
  laughing at their struggles and Professor Schillingschen studying their agony
  with strictly scientific interest.</p>

  <p>When the last had ceased struggling Schillingschen permitted himself one
  more pleasure. He strolled over to us and blocked Fred's way, standing with
  hands behind him and out-thrust chin.</p>

  <p>"You flatter yourself, don't you!" he sneered. He was just drunk enough to
  be boastful, while thoroughly sure of what he was saying. "You expect to tell
  a fine tale! I know the psychology of the English! I know it like a book! Let
  me tell you two things: First, your English would not believe you. They are
  such supremely cocksure fools that they can not be made to believe that
  another so-called civilized nation would act as they, in their egoism, would
  be ashamed to act! Civilization! That is a fine word, full of false meanings!
  Civilization is prudery&mdash;sham&mdash;false pride&mdash;veneer! Only the
  Germans are truly civilized, because they alone are not afraid to face naked
  animalism without its mask! The British dare not! They hide from it
  &mdash;shut their eyes! The fools! If you could tell them their story they
  would never listen!</p>

  <p>"Second: You will never tell the story! Being English, you were such dull-
  witted fools that you did not even hide the cartridge cases, or the bones of
  the Masai you shot! Bah-ha-ha-ha-hah! You can escape hanging yet by telling
  your secret. Jail you can not escape! Try it if you don't believe me! Try to
  escape&mdash;go on!"</p>

  <p>He turned on his heel and left us, striding heavily with the strength of
  an ox and about the alertness of a traction engine, turning his head every
  once in a while to enjoy the spectacle of our discomfort.</p>

  <p>We judged it best to appear concerned, as if that was indeed our first
  realization of the extent of the case against us and the nature of the
  evidence. But we did not find it difficult. We were all three startled by the
  fear that in some way he had got wind of our plans, and that he meant to play
  with us cat-and-mouse fashion.</p>

  <p>That night it stormed&mdash;not rain, but wind from east to west, blowing
  such clouds of dust that one could scarcely see across the narrow streets.
  Every element favored us. Even the askari at the cross-roads, supposed to be
  watching the Greeks, turned his back to the wind, and what with rubbing sand
  in and out of smarting eyes and fingering it out of his ears, heard and saw
  nothing. It was scarcely sunset when we saw both Greeks and the Goanese sneak
  out of the camping place in Indian file with their pockets full of cotton
  waste. They had soaked the stuff in kerosene right under our eye that
  afternoon.</p>

  <p>There ought to have been a sliver of moon, but the wind and dust hid it.
  Fifteen minutes after sundown the only light was from the lamps in windows
  and the cooking fires glowing in the open here and there. Thirty minutes
  later there began to be a red glow in three directions. Less than one second
  after we saw the first indications of the holocaust a regular volley of shots
  broke out from the boma as the sentries on duty gave the general alarm. Less
  than five minutes after that the whole of the southern, grass-roofed section
  of the town was going up in flames, and every living man, black, white, gray,
  mulatto, brown and mixed, was running full pelt to the scene of action.</p>

  <p>We waited ten minutes longer, rather expecting the Greeks to double back
  and begin denouncing us at once. In that case we intended to stretch them out
  with the first weapons handy. I sat feeling the weight of an ax, and
  wondering just how hard I could hit a Greek's head with the back of it
  without killing him. Fred had a long tent-peg. Will chose a wooden mallet
  that our porters carried to help in pitching tents.</p>

  <p>But the Greeks did not come, and there streamed such a perfect screen of
  crimson dust, sparkling in the reflected blaze and more beautiful than all
  the fireworks ever loosed off at a coronation, that it was folly to linger.
  We each seized the load left for that last trip (Fred's included the hammer,
  Pincers, and cold chisel for striking off the porters' chain) and started off
  quietly round the hill, not beginning to hurry until the hill lay between us
  and the burning town.</p>

  <p>There was not much need for caution. The roar of flames, the shouting, the
  excitement would have protected us, whatever noise we made, however openly we
  ran. Over and above the tumult we could hear Schubert's bull-throated
  bellowing, and then the echo to him as the sergeants took up the shout all
  together, ordering "Off with the grass roofs! Off with the roofs!"</p>

  <p>The white officials were more than interested, and had no time for
  anything but thought for the blaze. As we crossed the shoulder of the far
  side of the hill we could see them standing on the drill-ground all together,
  clearly defined against the crimson flare. Schillingschen was with them.</p>

  <p>There was no sign of what had happened at the boma. The gang would have to
  emerge from a little-used gate at the northern end, provided they could break
  the lock or secure the key to it; otherwise their only chance was to climb
  the wall by the cook-house roof and jump twenty feet on the far side. I was
  for running to the little gate and bursting it in from the outside, but Fred
  damned me for a mutineer between his panting for breath, and Will, who was
  longer-winded, agreed with him.</p>

  <p>"Have to leave their end of the plan to them! Let's do our part
  right!"</p>

  <p>As it turned out, we were last at the rendezvous. We heard the chain
  clanking in the dark just ahead of us, and try how we might, could not catch
  up. Then, near the boat bow, Kazimoto suddenly recognized Fred and nearly
  throttled him in a fierce embrace, releasing all his pent-up rage, agony,
  resentment, misery, fear in one paroxysm of affection for the man who cared
  enough to run risks for the sake of rescuing him. Fred had to pry him off by
  main force.</p>

  <p>"Into the boat with you!" Will ordered them. "Chain-gang first! Get down
  below, and lie down! The first head that shows shall be hit with a club!
  Quickly now!"</p>

  <p>Clanking their infernal chain like all the ghosts from all the haunted
  granges of the Old World, they climbed overside and disappeared. There were
  more figures left on shore then than we expected. Brown we could make out
  dimly in the dark: he was chattering nervously, and admitted that but for
  Kazimoto he would not be there. The faithful fellow had broken down the
  corrugated iron partition and had dragged him out by main force. He was
  rather resentful than grateful.</p>

  <p>"Hauled here by a nigger&mdash;think of it!"</p>

  <p>We ordered Brown on board and below, pretty peremptorily. Lady Saffren
  Waldon stepped out of the darkness next, holding a rifle and two bandoleers
  so full of cartridges that she could hardly raise her arms. We took the load
  from her, and helped her overside. Fred took the rifle and succumbed to the
  hunter's habit of opening the breach first thing. It was a German sporting
  Mauser, with a hair trigger attachment and magazine, as handy and useful a
  weapon as the heart of man could wish. He had scarcely snapped the breach to
  again when a voice we all recognized made the hair rise on my neck. Fred
  jumped and raised the rifle. Will swore softly&mdash;endlessly.</p>

  <p>"Gassharrrrammminy! You men took us for damned fools, didn't you? You
  thought to get away and leave us! By hell, no! We go or you stay! Birds of a
  feather fly together! One of you is American&mdash;I am American! Two of you
  are English&mdash;I am English, and can prove it! My friends come with
  me!"</p>

  <p>Fred leveled the rifle at him.</p>

  <p>"About face! Off back to town with you!" he barked.</p>

  <p>"Not on your tin-type!" Coutlass yelled. "I'm no man's popinjay! Shoot if
  you dare, and I'll spoil the whole game! Help! He-e-e-lp! He-e-e-e-lp!"</p>

  <p>The other Greek and the Goanese joined in the shout, the dark man setting
  up such an ululating screech that the very storm dwindled into second place
  in comparison. It was true, the unearthly yelling was carried out over the
  water, and very likely not a sound of it reached twenty yards inland; but it
  rattled our nerves, nevertheless. The skin grew prickly all up and down my
  backbone, and the men on the chain-gang inside the hull began shouting to
  know what the matter was.</p>

  <p>Will remembered then that he was captain for the day, and made virtue of
  necessity.</p>

  <p>"In with you!" he ordered. "Quick!"</p>

  <p>With a grin that was half-triumph, half-cunning, and wholly glad, Coutlass
  helped his companions over the bow, and had the civility to stand there with
  hand outstretched to help us in after him. We sent him below with his
  friends, but be came up again and insisted on leaning his weight on the poles
  with which we began shoving off into deeper water. It was hard work, for with
  her human cargo and several hundred gallons of water that had leaked through
  her gaping seams, the dhow was down several inches. Her hull had just begun
  to feel the wind and to rise and fall freely, when a white figure ran
  screaming down toward the water's edge and stood there waving to us
  frantically.</p>

  <p>"Leave her!" said Lady Waldon excitedly, clutching my arm. I was up on the
  bow, just about to lay the pole along the deck and haul on the halyards. She
  spoke very slowly right in my ear. "That, is my maid Rebecca. The faithless
  slut&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Coutlass began to shout, trying to pole the dhow back to land single-
  handed.</p>

  <p>"We can't leave that woman behind there!" Fred shouted, hardly making
  himself heard against the wind.</p>

  <p>"Can't we!" shouted Lady Waldon. "Give me that rifle, and I'll solve the
  problem for you!"</p>

  <p>But Coutlass solved it in another way by jumping overboard, over his head
  in deep water, taking our hempen warp with him (I had made one end of it fast
  to the bitts, meaning to be able to find it in the dark).</p>

  <p>There was quite a sea running, even as close inshore as that, and for a
  moment I doubted whether the Greek would make it. By that time it was all we
  could do to see the woman's white figure, still gesticulating, and screaming
  like a mad thing. Presently, however, the warp tightened, and then by the
  strain on it I knew that Coutlass was trying to haul us back inshore. Failing
  to do that, for the strength of the wind was increasing, he seized the Syrian
  woman by the waist and plunged into the water with her. I saw them disappear
  and hauled on the warp hand-over-hand with all my might, Lady Waldon leaning
  over to strike at my hands until I shouted to Fred to come and hold her. Then
  she begged Fred again for the rifle, promising to kill the two of them and
  reduce our problem to that extent if we would only let her.</p>

  <p>Will and I hauled the dripping pair on board, and Coutlass carried the
  maid to the stern. She had fainted, either from fright or from being half-
  drowned, there was no guessing which. Then in pitch blackness with Will's
  help I got the ship beam to the wind and began to make sail.</p>

  <p>Now danger was only just beginning! I was the only one of them all who
  knew anything whatever about sails and sailing. I was too weak to get the
  sail up single-handed, had no compass, knew nothing whatever of the rocks and
  shoals, except by rumor that there were plenty of both. There appeared to be
  no way of reefing the lateen sail, which was made of no better material than
  calico, and I was entirely unfamiliar with the rigging.</p>

  <p>Behind us, as we payed before the gaining wind, was brilliant blaze that
  showed where Muanza was. Against the blaze stood out the lakeward boma wall.
  I stood due east away from it, and discovered presently that by easing on the
  halyard so as to lower the long spar I could obtain something the effect of
  reefing.</p>

  <p>I set Fred and Will to making a sea-anchor of buckets and spars in case
  the sail or rotten rigging should carry away, leaving us at the mercy of the
  short steep waves that fresh-water lakes and the North Sea only know. The big
  curved spar, now that it was hanging low, bucked and swung and the dhow
  steered like an omnibus on slippery pavement. Luckily, I had living ballast
  and could trim the ship how I chose. They all began to grow seasick, but I
  gave them something to think about by making them shift backward and forward
  and from side to side until I found which way the dhow rode easiest.</p>

  <p>When Fred had finished the sea-anchor he got out the tools and began
  striking off the iron rings on the porters' necks through which the chain
  passed. The job took him two hours, but at the end of it we owned a good
  serviceable chain, and a crew that could be drilled to take the brute hard
  labor off our shoulders.</p>

  <p>Coutlass meanwhile was busy on the seat in the stern beside me making
  Hellenic inflammatory love to Lady Waldon's maid, whom he had wrapped in his
  own blanket and held shivering in his arms. Lady Waldon herself sat on the
  other side of me, affecting not to be aware of the existence of either of
  them. The other Greek and the Goanese had been driven below, where they
  started to smoke until I saw the glow of their pipes and shouted to Will to
  stop that foolishness. He snatched both pipes and threw them overboard. The
  thought of being seen from shore was almost incitement enough for murder.
  They refused to turn a hand to anything that night, but sat sulking below the
  sloping roof of reeds and tarpaulin that did duty for a deck, wedged
  alongside of seasick Wanyamwezi.</p>

  <p>It was Kazimoto who chose the least disheartened of the gang, beat them
  and stung them into liveliness, and set them to bailing. There was a trough
  running thwartwise of the ship into which the water had to be lifted from the
  midship well. It took the gang of eight men, working in relays, until nearly
  dawn to get the water out of her; and to keep her bottom reasonably dry after
  that two men working constantly.</p>

  <p>I knew vaguely that the great island of Ukerewe lay to the northwestward
  of us. Between that and the mainland, running roughly north, was a passage
  that narrowed in more than one place to less than a hundred yards. That would
  have been the obvious course to take had we not been afraid of pursuit, had
  we dared get away by daylight, and provided I had known the way. As it was I
  intended to add another hundred miles to the distance between us and the
  northern shore of the lake, by sailing well clear of and around Ukerewe,
  trusting to the less frequented water and the wilder islands to make escape
  easier.</p>

  <p>I judged it likely that the moment we were missed, the launch would be
  sent off in search of us, and that the Germans would search the narrow
  passage first. They would expect us to take the narrow passage, as the
  shortest, and depend on their ability to steam a dozen miles an hour to
  overhaul us, even should we get a long start on the outside course.</p>

  <p>With gaining wind, a following sea, a little ship crowded to suffocation,
  and a sail that might blow to shreds at any minute, it was not long before I
  began to pray for the lee of Ukerewe, and to stand in closer toward where I
  judged the end of the island ought to be than perhaps I should have done. It
  was lucky, though, that I did.</p>

  <p>In making calculations I had overlooked the obvious fact that, steaming
  three miles to our one, the launch could very well afford to take the outside
  course to start with. Then they could take a good look for us in the open
  water next morning, and, failing to find us, steam all around Ukerewe, come
  back down the inside passage, and catch us between two banks.</p>

  <p>It was Lady Saffren Waldon on my left hand, looking anywhere but at her
  maid and sweeping the dark waste of water with eyes as restless as the waves
  themselves, who gave the first alarm.</p>

  <p>"What is that light?" she asked me.</p>

  <p>Following the direction of her hand I saw a red glow on the water to our
  left, not more than a mile behind.</p>

  <p>"Reflection from the burning town," I answered, but I had no sooner said
  it than I knew the answer was foolish. It was the glow that rides above hot
  steamer funnels in the night.</p>

  <p>"Fred!" I shouted, for fear took hold of the very roots of my heart, "for
  the love of God make every one keep silence! Show no lights! Don't speak
  above a whisper! Keep all heads below the gunwale! That cursed German launch
  is after us!"</p>

  <p>We were in double danger. I could hear surf pounding on rocks to
  starboard. I did not dare to come up into the wind because nobody but I knew
  how the spar would have to be passed around the mast, and in any case the
  noise and the fluttering sail might attract attention.</p>

  <p>"Look out for breakers ahead!" I ordered. "I'm going to hold this course
  and hope they pass us in the dark!"</p>

  &mdash;"So David prevailed ..." (1. Samuel 17:50)</p><br>

  <p class="first">IF the dhow had been seaworthy; if the crew had understood
  the rigging and the long unwieldy spar; if we had had any chart, or had known
  anything whatever of the coast; if nobody had been afraid; and, above all, if
  that incessant din of surf pounding on rocks not far away to starboard had
  not threatened disaster even greater than the Germans in the steam launch,
  our problem might have been simple enough.</p>

  <p>But every one was afraid, including me who held the tiller (and the lives
  of all the party) in my right hand. Lady Saffren Waldon disguised fear under
  an acid temper and some villainously bad advice.</p>

  <p>"Steer toward them!" she kept shouting in my ear. "Steer toward them! Ram
  them! Sink them!"</p>

  <p>Coutlass, on my other hand, made feverish haste with his love-affair,
  fearful lest discovery by the Germans should postpone forever the assuaging
  of his hungry heart's desire.</p>

  <p>"Steer toward shore!" he urged me. "Who cares if we run on rocks? Can't we
  swim? Gassharamminy! Take to the land and give them a run for it!"</p>

  <p>He seized the tiller to reinforce the argument, and wrenched at it until I
  hit him, and Fred threatened him with the only rifle.</p>

  <p>"Get up forward!" Fred ordered; but Georges Coutlass would not go.</p>

  <p>"Gassharamminy!" he snarled. "You want my girl! I will fight the whole
  damned crew before I let her out of the hollow of my arm.</p>

  <p>"All right, touch that tiller again and I'll kill you!" Fred warned
  him.</p>

  <p>"Touch my girl, and you kill me or get out and swim!" Coutlass
  retorted.</p>

  <p>Will was up forward with Brown, looking out for breakers through the spray
  that swept over us continually. I watched the glow that rode above the
  launch's funnel, marveling, when I found time for it, at the mystery of why
  the cotton sail should hold. The firm, somewhere in Connecticut, who made
  that export calico, should be praised by name, only that the dye they used
  was much less perfect than the stuff and workmanship; their trademark was all
  washed out.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Will dodged under the bellying sail, throwing up both hands, and
  he and Brown screamed at me: "To your left! Go to your left! Rocks to the
  right!"</p>

  <p>The Germans had passed us, but not by much, for the short steep seas were
  tossing their propeller out of the water half the time. Because of the course
  I had taken the wind was setting slightly from us toward them, and I could
  have sworn they heard Will's voice. Yet there was nothing for it but to put
  the helm over, and as I laid her nearly broadside to the wind a great wave
  swept us. At that the Greek, the Goanese, and all the natives in the hold set
  up a yell together that ought to have announced our presence to the Seven
  Sleepers.</p>

  <p>I held the helm up, and let her reel and wallow in the trough. Now I could
  see the fangs of rock myself and the white waves raging around them. See? I
  could have spat on them! There was a current there that set strongly toward
  the rocks, for a backwash of some sort helped the helm and we won clear,
  about a third full of water, with the crew too panicky to bail.</p>

  <p>"Hold her so!" yelled Fred in my ear. "Don't ease up yet! If we get too
  close and they see us, I've the rifle! They haven't seen us yet!"</p>

  <p>"Rocks ahead again!" yelled Will. "To the left again!"</p>

  <p>We were in the gaping jaws of a sort of pocket, and it was too late to
  steer clear.</p>

  <p>"Throw the anchor over!" I roared, "and let go everything.</p>

  <p>Will attended to the anchor. Fred was too anxious for the safety of the
  only rifle to trust it out of hand, and he hesitated. Georges Coutlass saved
  the day by letting go the shivering Syrian maid and slashing at the halyard
  with his knife. Down came the great spar with a crash, and as the dhow swung
  round in answer to anchor and helm, Fred, Will and Brown, between them,
  contrived to save the sail, Brown complaining that we were the first sailors
  he ever heard of who did not have rum served them for working overtime in
  dirty weather.</p>

  <p>So we lay, then, wallowing in the jaws of a crescent granite reef, and
  watched the red glow above the German launch move farther and farther away
  from us. We waited there, wet and hungry, until dawn dimmed the flame from
  the burning roofs of Muanza, Lady Isobel Saffren Waldon loudly accusing us
  all at intervals of being rank incompetents unfit to be trusted with the
  lives of fish, and Coutlass afraid of nothing but interruption. The things he
  said to the maid, in English&mdash;the only language that they had apparently
  in common&mdash;would have scandalized a Goanese harbor "guide" or a Rock
  Scorpion from the lower streets of Gib. He did not mention marriage to her,
  beyond admitting that he had half a dozen wives already, and had been too
  bored by convention ever to submit to the yoke again. The maid seemed
  enraptured&mdash;delirious in the bight of his lawless arm, forgetful of her
  wetting, and only afraid when he left her for a minute.</p>

  <p>We dared not try to cook anything, even supposing that had been possible.
  Forward was a box full of sand to serve as hearthstone, but the little scraps
  of fuel we had brought with us were drenched and unburnable, even if the risk
  of being seen were not too great. Lady Saffren Waldon told us we were
  "toe-rag* contrivers." In fact, now that she was out of reach of the men she
  feared and hated most, she reverted to type and tried to domineer over us all
  by the simple old recipe&mdash;audacious arrogance. Luckily, she slept for an
  hour or two.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>toe-rag</i> (British slang)&mdash;contemptible;

  ]</p>

  <p>A little before dawn, when it began to be light enough to let us see the
  outline of the shore, we sent Kazimoto aloft to reeve our hemp rope through
  the hole that did duty for block, and by the time the sun had pushed the
  uppermost arc of his rim above the sky-line we once more had the sail
  set.</p>

  <p>The wind was still blowing a gale; the seamanlike precaution would have
  been to lie where we were at anchor until fairer weather; but daring is
  forced on the fearfullest, and there was nothing for it but to study out the
  method by which the unwieldy spar should be made to pass the mast when
  tacking, drill Fred, Will, Brown and Kazimoto, and then haul up the anchor
  and sail away before people on shore could see us.</p>

  <p>We had to tack toward Muanza for a quarter of a mile with fear in our arms
  to make them clumsy before I dared believe we were clear of the reefs; but
  when I put the helm down at last there was neither launch in sight nor any
  other boat that might contain an enemy. The southern spur of Ukerewe stuck
  out like a wedge into boiling water not many miles ahead, and once around
  that we should be sheltered. The only fly in the ointment then was the
  probability that the launch would be waiting for us just around the spur, or
  else under the lee of another smaller island in the offing to our left, but
  what we could not see in that hour could not upset us much.</p>

  <p>Every one clamored for food. The porters, already forgetful of the chain
  that had galled them, and the whips that had flayed them day and night,
  demanded to be set ashore to build a fire and eat. Lady Saffren Waldon awoke
  to fresh bad temper, and Coutlass, too, grew villainously impatient. His
  Greek friend, from under the shelter of the leaky reed-and-tarpaulin deck,
  offered him Greek advice, and was cursed for his trouble. One curse led to
  another, and then they both had to be beaten into subjection with the first
  thing handy, because when they fought Lady Saffren Waldon egged them on and
  the maid tried to savage the other Greek with a brooch-pin, which brought out
  the Goanese to the rescue. That crowded dhow was no place for pitched
  battles, plunging and rolling between the frying-pan of Muanza and the fire
  of unknown things ahead.</p>

  <p>"One more outbreak from you, and I shoot!" Fred announced, patting the
  rifle. But, he did not mean it, and Coutlass knew he did not. The English
  temperament does not turn readily on even the most rascally fellow beings in
  distress. Besides, it was an indubitable fact that we all much preferred
  Coutlass, with his daring record, and now a most outrageous love-affair on
  hand, to the other Greek or the Goanese, who were now disposed to bid for our
  friendship by abusing him. Georges Coutlass was no drawing-room darling, or
  worthy citizen of any land, but he had courage of a kind, and a sort of
  splendid fire that made men forget his turpitude.</p>

  <p>We were a seasick, cold and sorry company that rounded the point at last
  and came to anchor in a calm shallow bay where fuel grew close down to the
  water's edge. Having no small boat, we had to wade ashore and carry the
  women, Coutlass attending to his own inamorata. Lady Saffren Waldon's picric
  acid rage exploded by being dropped between two porters waist-deep into the
  water. It was her fault. She insisted one was not enough, yet refused to
  explain how two should do the work of one. Sitting on their two shoulders,
  holding on by their hair, she frightened the left-hand man by losing her
  balance and clutching his nose and eyes. She insisted on having both men
  flogged for having dropped her, and Fred's refusal was the signal for new
  war, our rescue of her being flung at once on to the scrap heap of her
  memory.</p>

  <p>She counted with cold cynicism on our unwillingness to leave her again at
  the mercy of the Germans, and had no more consideration of our rights or
  feelings than the cuckoo has for the owner of the nest in which she lays her
  eggs.</p>

  <p>"Beat those fools!" she ordered. "Beat them blue and give them no
  breakfast!"</p>

  <p>"Do you see that rock over there, Lady Waldon?" Fred answered. "Go and
  spread your clothes to dry. When we've cooked food we'll send Rebecca to you
  with your share."</p>

  <p>"If you send that slut to me I will kill her!" she answered, flying into a
  new fury.</p>

  <p>"Whom do you call slut?" demanded Coutlass (and he had no compunctions of
  any kind&mdash;particularly none about women, and calling names. He was
  simply feeling gallant after his own fashion, and alert for a chance to show
  off.) Lady Waldon backed away from him.</p>

  <p>"Of course," she sneered, "if you loose your bully at me, I am no match at
  all!"</p>

  <p>Fred promptly kicked Coutlass until he ran limping out of range, to sit
  and nurse his bruises with polyglot profanity. The Syrian Rebecca went over
  to comfort him, and eying the two of them with either malice or else
  calculation (it was impossible to judge which) Lady Waldon retreated toward
  the rock that Fred had pointed out.</p>

  <p>We cooked a miserable meal, neither daring to make too great inroad into
  our stores before making sure we could replenish them, nor caring to make
  more smoke than we could help. We hoped to escape being seen even by natives,
  but Lady Waldon upset that part of our plan by setting up such a scream when
  she saw three islanders crossing a ridge three hundred yards away, that they
  could not help hearing her, and came to investigate. She was forced to dress
  faster than ever in her life before, and came running to demand that we flog
  all three "to teach them manners." She had perfectly absorbed the German
  attitude toward all black men.</p>

  <p>From the natives we learned that there was no telegraph wire along that
  coast, and that the only German settlements were semi-permanent camps where
  they were cutting wood, for fuel for their own launch and for the steamers
  the British were building to serve the lake ports, Muanza included.</p>

  <p>With that good news for encouragement we made the three natives a small
  present in the vain hope that they might be induced not to talk about us, and
  put to sea again. The weather was fairer and growing intolerably hot. Even
  before the sun grew high the dhow was a comfortless indecent thing, more
  crowded than anything Noah can have had to tolerate: and we lacked Noah's
  faith in omniscient guidance, in addition to sailing in a hotter latitude,
  and having more fleas on board than the pair he is reported to have
  carried.</p>

  <p>As we crept up-coast, leaning to this or that side when the gusts of wind
  varied, the only enviable ones were the three in the bow, posted there to
  keep a look-out for the launch or any other enemy. They had room enough to
  sit without touching one another, and air to breathe that mostly had not been
  tasted half a dozen times. Fred, Will and Brown took turns commanding the
  foredeck look-out, keeping it awake and its units from quarreling. The rest
  of us found no joy in life, and not too much hope even when Fred's concertina
  lifted the refrain of missionary hymn-tunes that even the porters knew, and
  most of us sang, the porters humming wordless melancholy through their noses.
  (When that happened Lady Saffren Waldon's scorn was something the
  arch-priests of Babylon would have paid to see.)</p>

  <p>There was never room on the tiny after-deck for more than six people
  sitting elbow to elbow and back to back or knee to knee. Lady Waldon simply
  refused to yield her corner seat on any account at any time to any one.
  Coutlass refused to leave his new sweetheart, for the freely-voiced reason
  that then Brown might make love to her; and we did not care to send both of
  them below for obvious reasons. That reduced open-air accommodation to a
  minimum, because the reed-and-tarpaulin deck was scarcely strong enough to
  bear the weight of two men at a time, and we did not care to throw the whole
  deck overboard for fear of rain.</p>

  <p>And by-and-by the rain came&mdash;out of season, but no less violent
  because of that. It rained three days and nights on end&mdash;three windless
  days and starless nights, during which we had to linger alongshore close to
  the papyrus. In order to keep mosquitoes out we had to light a smudge in the
  sand-box below. The smudge added to the heat, and the heat drove men to the
  open air to gasp a few minutes in the rain for breath and go down again to
  make room for the next in turn.</p>

  <p>Sleep on shore was impossible, for thereabouts were crocodile and snake
  swamps, fuller of insect life than dictionaries are of letters. Poling was
  next to impossible, because the soft mud bottom gave no purchase. And the
  oars we made out of poles were clumsy affairs; there was not room for more
  than two boys to try to use them at a time, even if the deck would have stood
  the strain of more feet, which it certainly would not have done.</p>

  <p>Lady Waldon slept seated in her corner, with her head wrapped in a veil
  over which the mosquitoes prospected in gangs. Coutlass and his lady-love
  endured rain and insects in the open, too, but suffered less, because of
  mutual distraction. The rest of us took turns with the natives below, lying
  packed between them, much as sardines nestle in a can, wondering whether the
  famous Black Hole of Calcutta was really such a record-breaker as they say.
  Brown was of the opinion that the Black Hole was a nosegay compared to our
  lot&mdash;"Besides which, they probably had rum with 'em!" he added.</p>

  <p>Some of the porters grew sick under the strain of heat, fear, excitement
  and inactivity. The native suffers as much from unaccustomed inconvenience as
  the white man, and more from close confinement. The third night out the man
  next me began coughing, shaking my frame as much as his own as he racked
  himself, for we were wedged together with only the thickness of his blanket
  and mine between us, and I was jammed tight against the ship's side. Toward
  morning he grew quiet&mdash;grew colder, too. When dawn came we found that he
  had coughed up the most of his lungs on my white English blanket.</p>

  <p>I gave them the blanket to bury him in, and we poled the Queen of Sheba
  inshore to find a place to dig a hole, leaving the body stretched on some
  tree-roots while we prospected. We should have known enough by that time to
  leave four or five men on guard close by; as it was, when the men still on
  board the dhow began kicking up a Babel, Fred and I came running and jumping
  back through the marsh just in time to see a crocodile wriggle off into the
  water, with the corpse in his jaws feet first. Fred fired a shotted salute,
  but missed, and that ended that funeral.</p>

  <p>By day we passed villages on higher ground, where we might have procured
  more food if we had dared run the risk of meeting Germans. It was likely
  enough the villagers were so used to dhows that they would not trouble to
  report having seen us in the distance; but it was perfectly certain that if
  we paid them a visit they would pass word along from mouth to mouth with that
  astonishing, undiscoverable ease that is at once the blessing and bane of
  governments.</p>

  <p>So Fred wasted hot hours with the only rifle, trying to hunt meat on a
  shore where all the four-legged game had been ran down by the natives, or
  butchered by the German machine-guns long ago (for to teach Sudanese
  mercenaries the art of rapid fire in action their officers marched them out
  to practise on herds of antelope. There was game in plenty away from the
  lake, but none where the German officer could conveniently practise his
  profession.)</p>

  <p>We tried to shoot ducks and geese; but a rifle at long range is not the
  best weapon for that sport. We shot very few, and then only to discover the
  invincible repugnance natives have to eating "dagi" as they call all birds.
  We kept ourselves alive, but did not solve the problem of the
  ever-diminishing supplies of rice for our men.</p>

  <p>Somebody thought of fishing. We found hooks in a crevice in the Queen of
  Sheba's bow, and made lines from a frayed rope. But although the shore was
  lined with traps in which the inhabitants no doubt took fish in proper
  season, all that we caught was one miserable finny specimen, all head and
  mouth and tail, that the natives said would poison any one who ate it. The
  truth was, of course, that they preferred rice to anything, and, African
  native-like, would eat nothing else as long as rice was to be had, having no
  earthly notions of economy. When the rice was all gone on the fifth day out
  of Muanza they raided a banana plantation before we knew what they were up
  to, and came back gorged, with bunches enough to feed them for two or three
  more days.</p>

  <p>The fat was in the fire then, of course. We paid the owners handsomely,
  giving them their choice of money or blankets when they bore down on us in
  long canoes demanding vengeance. They voted for blankets and money, but vowed
  they would far rather have the bananas, because now their own people would be
  on short commons to make up for the surfeit of ours.</p>

  <p>We left them never doubting that they would send word to the nearest
  German officer. (They told us there was a wood-cutting station within a "few
  hours," and we prayed he might be only a non-commissioned man in charge of
  it, but knew that prayer was too sweetly reasonable to be answered where the
  German Gott makes war on foreigners.) Kazimoto assured us he heard them
  telling one another they would make complaint against us within the day.</p>

  <p>It remained, then, only to guess where that steam launch might be. We were
  approaching the northern end of Ukerewe, not a day's sail, if the light wind
  held, from the narrow mouth of the channel between Ukerewe and the mainland.
  That was the likeliest place for the launch to lie in wait; it was where we
  would have waited had we been pursuers and they the pursued. So we decided
  after a council of war to put the helm over and sail almost due westward,
  hoping to meet with an island where we might stop for a few days, catch fish
  and dry them, and caulk the leaky dhow, without the risk of letting the
  Germans know our whereabouts. (It is a peculiar fact that whatever the native
  secret system of transferring messages may be, it does not work across
  water.)</p>

  <p>Not all the little gods of Africa were fighting for the Germans, although
  it began to seem so. An hour after putting up the helm we sighted a school of
  hippopotami&mdash;fifty at least, and for half a day we chased them, Fred
  trying to shoot one until Will and I objected to further waste of ammunition.
  A dead hippo would have provided us with meat enough for a month for the
  whole ship's company. We could have towed the carcass ashore somewhere and
  dried the meat in slabs. But the glare on the water made shooting very nearly
  impossible (Fred's eyes were sore from it); and if we should meet the Germans
  those remaining cartridges would be our only hope. But the diversion took us
  out of sight of land, and that stood us in better stead presently than tons
  of fresh meat.</p>

  <p>Whether the Germans heard us, or were merely quartering that part of the
  lake in wait, we never knew. Probably they heard the shooting in the distance
  and gave chase. At any rate, within ten minutes of Fred's last wasted shot
  Coutlass caught sight of smoke and announced the fact with his favorite
  oath.</p>

  <p>"Gassharamminy! The launch!"</p>

  <p>At first we were all in a stew because there was no land near, where we
  might have beached the dhow and scattered. It was an hour before our
  advantage of position dawned on us, and all the while the launch approached
  us leisurely. She had plenty of fuel; the wood was piled high above her
  gunwale in a stack toward the stern; but those on board her seemed to take
  more pleasure in contemplation of our defenselessness than in speed. She
  steamed twice around us slowly before closing in; and then we made out
  Schillingschen's hairy shape, leaning against the cord-wood with a rifle
  between his hands.</p>

  <p>"Shoot him! Shoot him, by Jiminy!" urged Coutlass, but Fred was not so
  previous as that. We were not yet on the defensive. We counted five rifles,
  in addition to Schillingschen's protruding above the launch's side, and we
  all took cover in the hope either that they might decide we were not the dhow
  they waited for, or else that they might come very close out of curiosity.
  For Fred had a plan of his own. Rifle in hand, he crawled under the hot
  tarpaulin and lay flat on the reed deck, Will crawling after him to snatch
  the rifle in case Fred should be hit.</p>

  <p>"Steer straight toward 'em!" Fred called to me, as soon as it was evident
  that the launch did not intend to pass us by. "Keep headed toward them!"</p>

  <p>That was not easy in the light wind, until Schillingschen tired of staring
  at us and gave an order to the engineer. Then they laid the launch broadside
  on to our bow at about two hundred yards' range, and without a word of
  warning opened fire on us from all six rifles, Schillingschen devoting his
  first attention to myself at the helm.</p>

  <p>Our lone rifle cracked in reply, but they could not see Fred and did not
  guess where to shoot in order to search him out. They came no nearer, but
  circled slowly around us, only Schillingschen's bullets appearing to come
  anywhere near the target, until a yell from below showed what their real plan
  was and I understood why the sail was not ripped and no bullets whistled
  overhead. They were shooting through the planking of the dhow, endeavoring to
  massacre the helpless crowd below, and no doubt to sink her and drown us as
  soon as she was full enough of holes.</p>

  <p>A wounded Nyamwezi came scrambling on deck, spouting blood from his neck
  and crazed with fear. He jumped overboard and tried to swim toward the
  launch, but one of the Germans hit him in the head at the third shot and he
  disappeared. Then one of Schillingschen's elephant bullets slit my sleeve,
  and the next one pierced my helmet.</p>

  <p>"Put one into Schillingschen, Fred!" I shouted, but Fred did not answer.
  He kept up a very steady succession of shots that were doing no good at all
  that I could see.</p>

  <p>Another German bullet found its mark below deck in the thigh of the
  Goanese. He might have known enough to lie quiet, having some alleged white
  blood in him, but instead he, too, came struggling to the after-deck,
  bellowing like a mad-man. Coutlass knocked him back below with a blow on the
  chin, and he there and then threw the whole crowd into a panic by screaming
  and kicking. They all began to try to swarm together through the narrow
  opening, and those in the rear tore at the reed deck.</p>

  <p>Into that pandemonium went Coutlass, armed with nothing but Hellenic fury,
  thoughtful of nothing but his lady-love&mdash;surely reckless of his own
  skin. He beat, kicked, bit, scragged, banged their foolish heads together,
  cursed, spat, gouged, and strangled as surely no catamount ever did. Brown
  leaped in to lend a hand, and into the midst of that inferno three more
  bullets penetrated, each wounding a man. Lady Waldon, mad with some idiotic
  strategy of her own sudden devising, seized the tiller and tried to wrench it
  from my hand. The Syrian Rebecca, imagining new treachery and fearful for her
  Greek lover, tried to prevent her with teeth and nails. The Germans raised a
  war-whoop of wild enjoyment. And just at the height of all that, Fred's
  three-and-twentieth shot went home.</p>

  <p>There was a loud report, followed by instant nothing except stampede on
  the part of the Germans to get out of reach of something. Then the something
  grew denser; invisible hot vapor became a pall of steam that bid the launch
  from view, three more shots from Fred's rifle finding the proper mark by
  sheer accident, for there was another explosion; the cloud increased and the
  launch stopped dead.</p>

  <p>"That gray sheet of metal wasn't her boiler at all!" Fred shouted back to
  me. "The first shot pierced the boiler when I found out where to aim! I think
  three of them are scalded badly&mdash;hope so!&mdash;high pressure steam
  &mdash;superheated&mdash;did you see? Now leave 'em to find their own way
  home!"</p>

  <p>"See if you can't get Schillingschen!" said I.</p>

  <p>But Schillingschen was invisible in the white cloud, and Fred refused to
  waste one of the half-dozen cartridges remaining. The light wind that bore us
  away from the launch also spread the screen of steam between us and them. A
  shot or two from Schillingschen's rifle proved him to be still alive, and
  still determined, but missed us by so much that we began to dare to sit
  upright. Then Fred went below to sort out wounded men, plug holes in the
  dhow, and stop the panic, and we all prayed for wind with a fervor they never
  exceeded in Nelson's fleet.</p>

  <p>When Will had gone below to help Fred, the panic had ceased, two dead men
  had been thrown overboard, and six of the crew had been set to work bailing
  in deadly earnest to keep ahead of the new leaks, there was time to consider
  the position and to realize how hugely better off we were than if the launch
  had caught us somewhere close inshore. Now we could sail safely northward,
  every puff of wind carrying us nearer to British water and safety, whereas
  unless they could mend that high-pressure boiler, they would have to lie
  there for a week, or a month&mdash;die unless some one came in search of
  them. Had we holed their boiler near the shore they would have been able to
  take to the land until they found canoes. Good canoes, well manned, could
  have overhauled us hand over fist like terriers after a rat.</p>

  <p>It was fifteen minutes yet before we were out of rifle range, and
  Schillingschen tried to make the most of them when the steam thinned,
  exposing his beefy carcass recklessly. But by the time it had thinned down
  sufficiently to let him really see us we were too far away to make sure
  shooting. He slit the sail, giving us half a night's work to mend it, and
  made three more holes in our planking, but hurt nobody.</p>

  <p>That was the only launch the German government had on the lake in those
  days, an almost perfect toy with an aluminum hull and more up-to-date gadgets
  on her machinery than a battleship's engineer could have explained the
  purpose of in a watch. They had lavished a whole appropriation on one show.
  From the minute we were out of range of Schillingschen's big-bore elephant
  gun we ran risk of starvation, and perhaps surprise, but no longer of
  pursuit, and we headed the Queen of Sheba as nearly as we could guess for
  British East with feelings that even Lady Waldon shared, for she grew
  distantly polite again, and complimented Fred on his cool nerve and accurate
  shooting.</p>

  <p>We should have suspected treachery, for she made no attempt to retaliate
  on Rebecca for scratching her face. Unnatural inaction should have put us on
  our guard. She even went so far as to compliment the maid on "finding such a
  great, strong, brave man as Coutlass to cherish her." The Greek simply cooed
  at that&mdash;threw out his great chest and rearranged with his fingers the
  whiskers that had almost totally disguised him.</p>

  <p>(There was not one of us but looked like a pirate by that time. The
  natives of that part of Africa shave every particle of hair from their bodies
  whenever they get the chance, and prefer their heads as shiny and naked as
  any other part of them. But the German prison system, devised to break the
  spirit of whoever came within its clutches, included prohibition of shaving,
  so that we had the wooliest crowd of passengers imaginable.)</p>

  <p>We found it impossible to help being sorry for Lady Waldon, or even for
  the maid, who suffered in spite of Coutlass's kisses and strong arms. The
  obvious fact that the dhow was no place for a woman made us overlook the
  conduct of both of them over and over again, shutting eyes and ears to Lady
  Waldon's meanness and the maid's increasing impudence.</p>

  <p>Lady Waldon actually began to set her own cap at Coutlass, encouraging him
  to boast to the porters, and pretending to admire the gift with which he told
  them tales in Kiswahili that would have made even her blush if she had
  understood the half of them. At intervals the maid grew jealous, and had to
  be kissed back to serenity by Coutlass, who was no less in love with her
  because of any mere addition to the number of his interests. He could have
  made hot love to six women, and have enjoyed it. There were times when he
  really flattered himself that Lady Waldon admired his looks and fine
  physique.</p>

  <p>Food was now the chief concern. We trailed a fishing line behind us, but
  caught nothing. Brown said there were too many crocodiles for fish to be
  plentiful, but on the other hand, Kazimoto, who surely should have known,
  swore that the water was full of big fish, and that the islanders lived on
  little else. Whatever the truth of it, we caught nothing; and when we reached
  an island whose shore was lined with fish-traps made of stakes and
  basket-work we searched all the traps in vain. The natives we saw in the
  distance all ran away from us, and there were no crops that we could see of
  any kind, which rather bore out Kazimoto's story.</p>

  <p>"Crocks' eggs are what those savages eat, I tell you!" Brown insisted.
  "They're wholesome and don't taste worse than a rotten hen's egg." We offered
  him his own price if he would eat one himself in the presence of us all; but
  hungry though we were all beginning to be, he refused, and we needed his
  example.</p>

  <p>After that first island we began to sail among a regular archipelago, most
  of them scarcely better than granite rocks on which the crocodiles could
  crawl to sun themselves, but some of them a half-mile long, or longer. Nearly
  all of them were barren, but at last, when we judged ourselves well inside
  the British portion of the lake, we came on a very large one that had a
  mountain in the middle of it, and contained a fair-sized village hidden among
  trees.</p>

  <p>It was dark, and we were all famished when we reached it, so when we had
  poled the dhow into a little bay between granite boulders big enough to hide
  her, mast and all, we went ashore, made fires, and served out the last
  handfuls of rice, skimping our own allowance to increase those of the
  porters, whose larger stomachs afforded vaster yearning power. They were
  pitiably meager rations&mdash;a mere jest&mdash;an insult to hungry men; but
  we found before we had cooked and finished them that we had witnesses who
  thought us fortunate.</p>

  <p>They came so silently that even the porters did not notice them at first
  &mdash;gaunt black shadows flitting in the deeper shadows, and coming
  presently to squat outside the edge of the circle of firelight, until a
  tribe, men, women and little children, were all gathered around us burning up
  the darkness with their eyes.</p>

  <p>They were hungrier than we! Our food, that looked so scant to us, to them
  was a very feast of the gods! They all had pieces of leather or plaited grass
  drawn tight around their middles to lessen the pangs of hunger, and the
  chief, who sat rather apart from the rest, gnawed at a piece of bark.</p>

  <p>None of them wore any clothes. Those that had goat-skin aprons had them on
  behind, and they were as free from self-consciousness as the trees in winter.
  Some of them had spears, and they all had knives, yet none offered violence,
  or as much as begged. There were three or four hundred of them, at the lowest
  reckoning, yet they allowed us to finish our meal in the dark in peace.</p>

  <p>There was nothing to say when we had finished. We knew what the matter
  was, and they knew we knew. We had nothing to share with them, and they knew
  that, for they could see the empty rice bags that the porters had shaken and
  beaten to get out the very dust. We did not know their language; even
  Kazimoto professed himself ignorant of any dozen words that could unlock
  their understanding.</p>

  <p>Presently, under the eyes of all of them, Fred got out the rifle from its
  wrappings and proceeded to clean and oil it carefully, as every genuine
  hunter should before he sleeps.</p>

  <p>Then it was evident at once that new hope for some reason had been born
  among that silent crowd. The chief, uninvited, drew nearer and watched every
  detail of Fred's husbandry with glittering eye.</p>

  <p>"Give him the oily rag to suck!" suggested Brown, but that proved not to
  be the key to his interest, for he thrust the rag back into Fred's hand and
  motioned to him to continue cleaning.</p>

  <p>Finally Fred examined the last handful of cartridges carefully one by one,
  and filled the magazine. Then, after making sure the sights were in order, he
  began to wrap the rifle again.</p>

  <p>But at that the chief held out a lean long arm and stopped him. Coutlass
  sprang to his feet in a hurry, imagining that was a signal to attack at last,
  but Fred ordered him to sit down, and Lady Waldon, who seemed possessed for
  the once by uncanny calmness, asked him to give her an arm to the dhow, where
  she proposed to try to sleep. Coutlass felt flattered, and obeyed. The maid
  got up and followed them both in a fury of jealousy, and they three were lost
  to view in a moment among the shadows cast by our four flickering fires. The
  other Greek got up and followed them, leaving the Goanese already snoozing by
  the fire.</p>

  <p>Then, just as the half of a brilliantly pale moon rose above the papyrus,
  the chief came a pace nearer and touched Fred's hand. Then he beckoned. Then
  he touched the hand again and retreated backward. Glancing around I saw the
  shadows that were his tribe leaning toward us in strained attention, with
  eyes for nothing but their chief and Fred. Understanding there was something
  that the chief desired him to go and do, Fred passed the rifle to Will and
  rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>With patience that was simply pathetic the chief shook his head and tried
  to explain something in weary-motioned pantomime. Fred took the rifle back
  from Will. The chief nodded. Fred started to follow him, and then the whole
  tribe sighed, with a sound like the evening wind rustling through the
  papyrus.</p>

  <p>It being clear now that he was to shoot something, Fred took the wrappings
  off the rifle, threw them to me, and walked into the dark, the chief trotting
  ahead like a phantom and glancing back to beckon about once a minute. Not
  caring to miss the play, we followed in Indian file, I bringing up the
  rear.</p>

  <p>The whole tribe rose at once and flitted along beside us on our landward
  side. We could not hear a footfall, or a breath. They passed through dry
  grass without rustling, neither stumbling nor crowding one another, but all
  so governed by one all-absorbing thought that they acted in absolute unison.
  That the thought was food did not, even in their starving state, make them
  forget the crowning need for silence. We with our leather boots made more
  noise than all they together.</p>

  <p>We passed along the lake shore for half a mile, until suddenly the chief,
  looking tall as a stripped tree in the pale uncertain light, threw up an arm
  and waved it in a circle. Instantly the whole tribe vanished. It was as if a
  puff of wind had blown them; or as if they had been figures thrown on a
  screen by a magic lantern and suddenly switched off at the performer's whim.
  Then the chief continued forward, we marching more carefully.</p>

  <p>Now he turned to the half-right and followed a narrow track across a neck
  of land that jutted out into the lake. We approached a low rise, and as he
  drew near the top of that he went down on hands and knees, crawling up the
  last few yards so cautiously that I had to stare hard to be sure he was there
  at all.</p>

  <p>As soon as Fred came near he made frantic signals to him to get down and
  crawl too; so we all knelt down and crawled behind Fred, striving to make no
  noise and filling the unhappy chief so full of fury at the noise we did make
  that he writhed in nervous torment.</p>

  <p>On top of the rise Fred stopped and in imitation of the chief thrust his
  head forward very gradually. One by one we followed suit until, lying prone
  in line along the ridge within thirty paces of the water, we saw at last what
  we were after.</p>

  <p>Bathed in the moonlight, head and shoulders clear of the mirror-like
  water, a great bull hippopotamus surveyed the scenery, drinking in
  contentment through his little placid eyes. Out there nothing troubled him,
  as for instance the mosquitoes troubled us. He had eaten his fill, for some
  sort of green stuff hung from his jaws; and he was beginning to feel sleepy,
  for be opened his enormous mouth and yawned straight toward us&mdash;three
  tons of meat on the hoof, less than a hundred yards away, stock-still, and
  unsuspicious!</p>

  <p>The chief began whispering unintelligible warnings in a voice so low that
  it sounded like the drone of insects. Fred thrust the rifle forward inch by
  inch and, taking his time about it, settled himself comfortably for the shot.
  It was no easy shot in that uncertain light at a downward angle. The glare of
  the sun on the lake had troubled his eyes during the last few days. The
  shimmer of the moonlight was deceptive now. I wished he would pass the rifle
  to Will, or even to Brown of Lumbwa, who was digging his fingers into the
  earth beside me in almost uncontrollable excitement. But Fred was
  unperturbed, and the chief, who was nervous enough to detect the slightest
  sign of nervousness in Fred, did not seem to mistrust him for one second.</p>

  <p>Three times I saw Fred breathe deeply, as if about to squeeze the trigger,
  but each time he was only "makkin' sikkar,"* and eased his lungs again. The
  target a hippo offers to a Mauser rifle bullet is not much more than half the
  size of a man's hand, including only the ear and eye and the narrow space
  between them. By daylight at a hundred yards that is nothing for a cool shot
  to complain about, but in half-moonlight, at that angle, it is none too much.
  I swore silently, wishing again and again that Fred would pass the rifle to
  Will, or to Brown&mdash;or to me! Yet if he had passed it to me I should have
  trembled worse than any one.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>makkin' sikkar</i> (Scots)&mdash;making sure.]</p>

  <p>Visions began to haunt me of what would happen if Fred should miss! What
  would the effect be on wild folk tortured by hunger and keyed to the pitch of
  frenzy by suspense? Then, even while we watched, another problem added
  itself. Over on the water there began to come a wind, driving ripples and
  little waves in front of it. The moment those came near the hippo be would
  vanish from view, for they only care for moonlight when they can see it
  mirrored on a perfectly still surface</p>

  <p>I cursed Fred between set teeth, almost loud enough for him to hear me;
  for the hippo did move. His head was a foot nearer water-level; he had seen
  or heard something that alarmed him. He was in the act of sinking under water
  when Fred made sure of the sights at last and the rifle spoke, ringing out
  into the still night like the crack of Judgment Day, more startling because
  we had waited so long for it in such suspense.</p>

  <p>Instantly the amazing happened. A yell burst out behind us that split the
  night apart. Where stilly blackness had been, now four or five hundred crazy
  shadows leaped and danced, murdering the silence with marrow-curdling noises
  intended to express joy.</p>

  <p>Out on the water the stricken hippo pitched head downward and plunged like
  a mountain of meat gone mad, thrashing up great waves that were darkened with
  his life-blood. A whole herd, several hundred strong, emerged shoulder-high
  from the water to take one swift look at him and flee. The arriving wind
  overswept the little whirlpools they all made in the moonlight, as they dived
  to seek seclusion somewhere and no doubt to choose themselves a new bully
  after terrific fighting.</p>

  <p>Our quarry plunged a last time, and stayed under. Now was new anxiety. In
  twenty minutes or half an hour he should rise to the surface again, but no
  man could guess where, and the wind and currents would very swiftly hide his
  great carcass somewhere amid the acres of papyrus unless sharp eyes were
  alert.</p>

  <p>But the papyrus was friend as well as foe. In a space of time to be
  measured by seconds the yelling young men of the tribe had uncovered three
  canoes, hidden from marauding enemies among the more-than-man-high reeds, and
  the rest of the tribe&mdash;men, women and young ones&mdash;scattered along
  the shore to watch from between the stalks.</p>

  <p>In less than fifteen minutes some one yelled, and even the very old men,
  who had stayed beside us to gape at Fred's rifle and our clothes and boots,
  began running like hares toward the sound. In twenty minutes after that, with
  the aid of grass ropes and leather thongs, they had hauled the huge carcass
  to the shore and rolled it out of the water, where it lay glistening in
  moonlight, stumpy, foolish, legs uppermost.</p>

  <p>The butcher's work&mdash;the feast&mdash;did not begin yet. There was
  time-honored custom to obey, which Kazimoto knew all about even if those
  ignorant wachenzie* would have fallen to without ceremony. He drove them off.
  A white man had slain that animal; therefore the white man's choice of meat
  was first, and he very leisurely and skillfully cut out the enormous tongue
  for us and fifty pounds of meat for our following before he would let them as
  much as touch the carcass with a dagger.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>wachenzi</i> (Swahili, plural of <i>machenzi</i>)
  &mdash;man from 'way back,' rube, simp. Author's footnote. ]</p>

  <p>Then, though, the tribe fell to, naked, with little naked knives&mdash;
  tearing off the thick hide in foot-wide strips, and hacking the red flesh
  into lumps that they ate, raw and quivering, while they worked. The little
  bits of children, each chewing raw bloody meat, brought baskets for the
  overflow, dragging them to wherever they could find a space between the legs
  of struggling men, the women emptying the baskets almost as fast as the
  children filled them, and chewing until their jaws ran blood.</p>

  <p>Nothing was wasted. The blood was caught in pools in part of the hide,
  spread like an apron on the earth, and lapped up by whoever could get to it.
  The very guts were gathered up in baskets to be cooked. And where the last
  little soft iron dagger had done its work, the blood had been drunk, and the
  last scrap of hide bad been cut into strips, to be chewed when the meat and
  its memory were things of the past, the enormous ribs lay glistening in the
  moonlight like those of an abandoned wreck, picked as clean as if the kites
  had done it.</p>

  <p>"Have we done a commendable thing?" laughed Fred, looking at the crowd's
  distended paunches. "There's a good bull hippo the less. We've saved the
  lives for a time of several hundred gluttons. They know neither grace nor
  gratitude."</p>

  <p>But he was wrong. They did. They brought Fred a woman&mdash;their fattest,
  ugliest; which means she was skin and bone and uglier than Want, also she was
  more afraid of Fred than Satan is said to be of shriving. The chief led her
  by the hand, she hanging back and hiding her face under one arm (which left
  the rest of her nakedness unprotected). He seized Fred's hand and put the
  woman's in it.</p>

  <p>"Now you're spliced!" Brown explained. "Married to the gal forever in
  presence of legal witnesses!"</p>

  <p>Kazimoto confirmed the fearful news.</p>

  <p>"Married in regular form an' accord with tribal custom!" Brown continued,
  nodding solemnly.</p>

  <p>"Divorce me&mdash;soon and swiftly, somebody!" Fred demanded.</p>

  <p>We appealed to Kazimoto for information, but only threw him into a
  quandary, and he proceeded to add to ours. The usual price for a woman, it
  seemed, was cows&mdash;many or few according as she was lovely or her father
  rich. In case of divorce, custom decreed that the cows with their offspring
  should be given back. The objection to any other property than cows changing
  hands to bind or loose in wedlock was that food, for instance, when eaten was
  not returnable.</p>

  <p>"Married to the gal for good an! all!" Brown grinned, nudging Will and me
  to note Fred's consternation. "You'd better stay here an' take the chief's
  job when he kicks the bucket&mdash;possibly you can speed the day by
  overfeedin' him!"</p>

  <p>"Some men's luck," Will murmured, but stopped in mid-sentence, for
  interruption came in the form of a weird figure, gesticulating like a
  windmill, stumbling and careening through the gloom, shouting as it came. Not
  until it was thirty yards away did an intelligible sound explain at least who
  the apparition was.</p>

  <p>"Gassharamminy! Give me that gun!"</p>

  <p>Coutlass burst in among us so out of breath that he could not force
  through his teeth another rational syllable, but he made his intentions
  partly clear by snatching at Fred's rifle, persisting until Will and I pulled
  him off.</p>

  <p>"The dhow's gone!" he panted at last. "Give me that rifle, or come
  yourself! Hurry! There's a wind! You'll be too late!"</p>

  <p>"You're dreaming or drunk!" Fred answered, but Coutlass refused to be
  disbelieved, and in another moment we were all running as fast as we dared
  through the darkness toward the camp-fires, where we had left the Goanese
  snoozing and the dhow snugly moored among the rocks.</p>

  <p>The chief and his followers far outdistanced us in spite of their gorged
  condition&mdash;all except the woman, who jogged dutifully, although
  unhappily, behind Fred. When we reached the campfires they were standing
  gazing out on the lake, where we could just make out the bellying sail of the
  Queen of Sheba leaning like a phantom away from the gaining wind. The
  distance was not to be judged in that weak uncertain light. We all shouted
  together, but there came no answer and we could not tell whether the sound
  carried as far as the dhow or not.</p>

  <p>"Gassharamminy!&mdash;why don't you shoot!" shouted Coutlass, dancing up
  and down the bank in frenzy. "Give me that rifle! I'll show you! I'll teach
  them!"</p>

  <p>I believe I would have fired if the rifle had been in my hands. Brown,
  last to arrive and most out of breath, joined with Coutlass in angry shouts
  for vengeance. Will offered no argument against sending them a parting shot.
  Fred set the butt of the rifle down with a determined snort, walked over
  toward the fire, stirred the embers, threw on more fuel, and looked about him
  when the dry wood blazed.</p>

  <p>"If she has left as much as one blanket among the lot of us, I don't see
  it anywhere!" he said, taking his seat on a rock.</p>

  <p>"A blanket?" sneered Coutlass. "She has even your money! Worse than that
  &mdash;she has my woman! You were a gum-gasted galoot* not to shoot at
  her!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>gum-gasted</i>&mdash;scared witless; funked out;
  <i>galoot</i>&mdash;a clumsy fool; a clod. ]</p>

  <p>Fred patted the bulging pocket of his shooting jacket.</p>

  <p>"Most of the money is here" he said quietly, and we all sighed with
  relief.</p>

  <p>"Take canoes and chase them!" shouted Coutlass, beginning to dance up and
  down again.</p>

  <p>"There's time enough" Fred answered. "We know the winds of these parts
  well enough by this time. This will blow until midnight. Then calm until
  dawn. After dawn a little more wind for an hour or two, then doldrums again
  until late afternoon. They'll run on a rock in all likelihood. If they do we
  can catch them at our leisure, supposing we can get these islanders to
  paddle. If it should blow hard, then we can't catch them anyhow. Sit down and
  tell us what happened, Coutlass!"</p>

  <p>The Greek cursed and swore and pranced, but all in vain. Fred was
  inexorable. We others grew calmer when the problem of who should paddle the
  canoes solved itself suddenly with the arrival of fourteen of our own men.
  Discovering themselves left behind, they had run along the bank in vain hope
  of catching the dhow somehow&mdash;perchance of swimming through the
  crocodile-infested water, and returned now disconsolate, to leap and laugh
  with new hope at sight of us and of the red meat that Kazimoto had thrown on
  the ground near the fire. They came near in a cluster. Will hacked off a lump
  of meat for them, and they forthwith forgot their troubles, as instantly as
  the birds forget when a sparrow-hawk has done murder down a hedge-row and
  swooped away.</p>

  <p>Not everything was gone after all. Kazimoto found the pots we had cooked
  the rice in, and started to boil the hippo's tongue for us.</p>

  <p>"Come, Coutlass&mdash;sit down before we eat and tell us what happened,"
  Fred suggested.</p>

  <p>The Greek paced up and down another time or two, and at last calmed
  himself sufficiently to laugh at Fred's woman, who had squatted down
  patiently in the shadow behind him.</p>

  <p>"Easy for you!" he grinned savagely, squatting on the far side of the
  fire. "You have a woman! Mine is God knows where! She said to me&mdash;that
  hell-damned Lady Saffren Waldon said to me&mdash;we sat all three together in
  the stern of the dhow, I with my arm around Rebecca, and she said to
  me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll see if I can't make a dicker for the chief's canoes," Will
  interrupted. "We can hear the Greek's tale any old time."</p>

  <p>"Trade my woman for them!" Fred suggested cheerfully. "Go on,
  Coutlass!"</p>

  <p>The Greek gritted his teeth savagely. "She said&mdash;that hell-damned
  Lady Saffren Waldon said, as we sat there in the dhow, 'How about the kicking
  Fred Oakes gave you on the island, Mr. Coutlass? Where is your Greek honor?'
  &mdash;Do you see? She worked on my bodily bruises and my spiritual courage
  at the same time&mdash;the cunning hussy! 'That Fred Oakes will win this
  Rebecca away from you very soon!' she went on. 'I have watched him.'"</p>

  <p>Fred smiled about as comfortably as a martyr on the grid. The presence of
  the dusky damsel, confirmed by her smell behind him, made him touchy on the
  subject of sex.</p>

  <p>"Presently she said to me, 'I have my own affairs that will adjust
  themselves all the better for their absence when I get to British East. As
  for you, they will simply report you to the authorities for raiding those
  cattle of Brown's. Can you imagine that creature Brown forgiving you? He will
  have you thrown in jail! Why wait? But we must not leave the Goanese or the
  other porters, and we must hurry! You go,' she said, 'and send the Goanese
  and the rest of the porters on board!'</p>

  <p>"So I did go. I kicked de Sousa awake, and he cursed me, because my toe
  landed once or twice on his thigh where the bullet wounded him. I drove him
  on board, and she put him to work with Kamarajes getting up the sail. Then I
  went off to get those cursed porters. I could not find them! The dogs had
  gone to the village, to find women I don't doubt! I tell you what I would do
  to them if they were mine!"</p>

  <p>"Never mind that!" Fred cut in. We could all guess what form the
  punishment would take. "Get on with the tale! You couldn't find the porters.
  What next?"</p>

  <p>"I decided to leave the dogs behind, and serve them right! I went back to
  the dhow in a great hurry. She was gone! Vanished! Disappeared as if the lake
  had opened up and swallowed her! I could just see the sail in the distance. I
  shouted! No answer! I shouted again. I heard Rebecca call to me! Then I heard
  laughter&mdash;Lady Isobel Saffren Waldon's laughter! Gassharamminy! I will
  run red-hot skewers into that woman when I catch her! Do you see how she has
  vengeance on Rebecca? Do you see now why she took sides between me and
  Kamarajes and de Sousa? Do you see how she has plotted? What will she do now?
  What Will she do?"</p>

  <p>He began to pace up and down again furiously, shaking both fists at the
  unresponsive stars.</p>

  <p>"She will do Rebecca an injury! She will give that girl to de Sousa or to
  that old Kamarajes! We shall never catch them! Gassharamminy! Oh, Absalom!
  You should have fired when I told you! That she-dog has a trick of some kind
  up her sleeve yet! How shall we catch her? Why do we wait? Give me that
  rifle! I will take a canoe and go after them alone! You do not know what
  Greek spirit is! I am American sometimes&mdash;English when it suits me
  &mdash;always Greek when I am wronged!"</p>

  <p>"You certainly have been put upon" Fred answered. "Tell us how your Greek
  spirit justified deserting us."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" snarled Coutlass. "Do you love me? What would you do to me if
  you could get me to British East in your power? You would hand me over as a
  cattle thief!"</p>

  <p>"You bet I will!" admitted Brown of Lumbwa. "You dog, you've ruined
  me!"</p>

  <p>"What did I tell you?" demanded Coutlass. "Why, then, should I not look
  out for myself?"</p>

  <p>"I think we'd better leave you on this island," Fred told him quietly. "We
  can't trust you out of sight. The only way to prevent you from stealing this
  rifle and murdering us all would be to lie awake in turns."</p>

  <p>"Bah!" grinned the Greek, striding back toward the fire. "How many
  cartridges have you left? Five, eh? After I had murdered all of you, how many
  would remain?"</p>

  <p>"You'll have to think of a better argument than that," smiled Fred, and
  for the first time I suspected he was speaking in deadly earnest. Coutlass
  suspected it, too, and grew still. The sweat burst out on his face, and his
  eyes bulged from their sockets.</p>

  <p>"You will leave me here?" he stammered.</p>

  <p>Fred nodded, smiling up at him.</p>

  <p>"You see, you're such on all-in scoundrel!" Brown assured him.</p>

  <p>"You! You poor drunkard!" Coutlass turned his back on Brown, and faced
  Fred squarely. "You are a man, Mr. Oakes! I can speak to you as to my
  brother."</p>

  <p>Fred smiled blandly.</p>

  <p>"I will speak to you God's truth!"</p>

  <p>Fred grinned.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you where the ivory is!"</p>

  <p>Fred threw his head back and laughed outright.</p>

  <p>"I speak to you on my honor! That mother of misery, Lady Saffren Waldon,
  stole a map from Schillingschen. Before I would agree to set the town on fire
  I made her give me that for a hostage, lest she should prove treacherous and
  leave me behind after all! I have it now! It is marked with a circle to show
  where Schillingschen believes the stuff must be, because he has searched
  everywhere else!"</p>

  <p>"If that map is worth anything," Fred countered, "how did Lady Saffren
  Waldon care to leave you behind with it?"</p>

  <p>"The harridan forgot it!" answered Coutlass. "She was so delighted to get
  vengeance on Rebecca by taking her away from me that she did not care for
  anything else! She hates you! She hates me! She hates Rebecca! Those who hate
  &mdash;as I can hate!&mdash;would rather have revenge than all the riches of
  Africa! Do you think I would hesitate between money and revenge on her?"</p>

  <p>"All right," Fred answered. "The map, then&mdash;what about it?"</p>

  <p>"Take me with you and the map is yours!"</p>

  <p>"Show it to me, then!"</p>

  <p>"I must have a share of the ivory!"</p>

  <p>"Show me the map first!"</p>

  <p>Coutlass searched inside his flannel shirt&mdash;swiftly&mdash;more
  swiftly&mdash;angrily. His jaw dropped. Even between the fire-light and the
  moonlight one could judge that his color changed&mdash;and changed again.</p>

  <p>"Show me the map before we bargain!" Fred insisted. "Hurry, man! There's
  Mr. Yerkes with the canoe. We can't wait here all night!"</p>

  <p>"It is gone!" admitted Coutlass. "Some one stole it!"</p>

  <p>"I could have told you that in the first place," Fred informed him, rising
  to his feet. "I have the map in my pocket."</p>

  <p>"You stole it?" Coutlass gasped.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not. Rebecca stole it while she was supposed to be sleeping in
  your arms!"</p>

  <p>"Gassharamminy! I might have known it! Those Syrians&mdash;she meant to
  give us all the slip and find the ivory herself!"</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the Sort!" said Fred. "She stole it from you, to give it to
  Lady Saffren Waldon! Kazimoto saw her do it&mdash;saw where Lady Waldon hid
  it&mdash;and stole it from her while she slept to give to me, believing it to
  be something of mine. Here it is!"</p>

  <p>Fred let the end of a folded map protrude from his inner pocket just far
  enough for Coutlass to recognize it by the fire-light. The Greek turned on
  his heel.</p>

  <p>"All right!" be said ruefully, swinging suddenly round again. "If you were
  alone I would fight you, my knife against your rifle! I can not fight all
  four of you! Go away then, and be damned! I have nothing to offer. There is
  nothing I can do. Leave me, and I will look after myself!"</p>

  <p>"Now you're talking like a man." said Fred.</p>

  <p>"Leave me that woman of yours, and go to hell, all of you!" laughed the
  Greek.</p>

  <p>Fred seemed suddenly possessed of a bright idea. He turned to the woman
  and beckoned her to rise. Then in unmistakable pantomime he went through the
  motions of presenting her to Coutlass. The woman gasped&mdash;stammered
  something that was positively not consent&mdash;stared with frightened eyes
  at Coutlass&mdash;shook her shaven head violently&mdash;and ran away into the
  darkness, pursued by roars of laughter that speeded her on her way.</p>

  <p>"A clear case of desertion!" announced Fred judicially. "You men are
  witnesses!" Then he turned once more to Coutlass. "I don't think we'll leave
  you to raise Cain on this island. It depends on you whether we find you a
  lonelier island&mdash;turn you loose or hand you over to the authorities in
  British East!"</p>

  <p>"Good!" Coutlass shouted. "By Jingo, you are a gentleman! You are the best
  man in the world! I will treat you as my brother!"</p>

  <p>"Thanks!" said Fred dryly.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you men ever coming?" asked Will, striding out of the shadows.
  "I've made the dicker&mdash;found a man who'd been on the mainland and knows
  Swahili. The chief's agreeable to loan us two canoes in place of deeding you
  the woman. I took your name in vain, Fred, and consented to that while your
  back was turned&mdash;kick all you like&mdash;the deed is done! Four of his
  savages come with us as far as we want to go, we feeding 'em meat and paying
  'em money. It's agreed they're to eat just as often as we do. They paddle the
  canoes back home when we're through with them. Are you all ready? Then all
  aboard! Let's hurry!"</p>

  <p class="poem"
     style="margin-left:5%">When the last of the luck has deserted and the
     least of the chances has waned,<br>
  When there's nowhere to run to and even the pluck in the smile that you carry
  is feigned;<br>
  When grimmer than yesterday's horror to-morrow dawns hungry and cold,<br>
  And your faith in the coming unknown is denied in regret for the known and
  the old,<br>
  Then you're facing, my son, what the Fathers from Abraham down to to-day<br>
  Have looked on alone, and stood up to alone, and each in his several way<br>
  O'ercame (or he shouldn't be Father). So ye shall o'ercome: while ye
  live,<br>
  Though ye've nothing but breath and good-will to your name ye must stand to
  it naked, and give!<br>
  <br>
  Ye shall learn in that hour that the plunder ye won by profession is naught
  &mdash;<br>
  And false was the aim ye aspired with&mdash;and dross was the glamour ye
  sought&mdash;<br>
  The codes and the creeds that ye cherished were shadows of clouds in the
  wind,<br>
  (And ye can not recall for their counsel lost leaders ye dallied behind!)<br>
  Ye shall stand in that hour and discover by agony's guttering flame<br>
  How the fruits of self-will, and the lees of ambition and bitterness all are
  the same,<br>
  Until, stripped of desire, ye shall know that was death. Then the proof that
  ye live<br>
  Shall be knowledge new-born that the naked&mdash;the fools and the felons,
  can give!<br>
  <br>
  Then the suns and the stars in their courses shall speedily swing to your
  aid,<br>
  And nothing shall hinder you further, and nothing shall make you afraid,<br>
  For the veriest edges of evil shall challenge your joy, and no more,<br>
  And room for the right shall shine clear in your vision where wrong was
  before.<br>
  Then the stones in the road shall be restful that used to be traps for your
  feet,<br>
  Then the crowd shall be kind that was cruel before, and your solitude
  sweet<br>
  That was want to be gloomy aforetime and gray&mdash;when the proof that ye
  live<br>
  Is no longer the pain of desire, but the will&mdash;and the wit&mdash;and the
  vision, to give!<br>
  <br>
  &mdash;"Many that are first shall be last; and the last first."</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE canoes were the usual crazy affairs, longer and rather
  wider than the average. The bottom portion of each was made from a
  tree-trunk, hollowed out by burning, and chipped very roughly into shape. The
  sides were laboriously hewn planks, stitched into place with thread made from
  papyrus.</p>

  <p>Some of the men left behind were our personal servants. Counting them and
  Kazimoto, there were twenty natives remaining with us, making, with the four
  men lent us by the chief, an allowance of twelve to each canoe. If we had had
  loads as well it would have been a problem how to get the whole party away;
  but as Lady Saffren Waldon had left us nothing but three cooking-pots, we
  just contrived to crowd the last man in without passing the danger point,
  Fred taking charge of the first canoe with Brown of Lumbwa and Kazimoto, and
  leaving Coutlass with the other canoe to Will and me. We agreed it was most
  convenient to keep the Greek and the rifle separated by a stretch of
  water.</p>

  <p>There is one inevitable, invariable way of starting on a journey by canoe
  in Africa. Somebody pushes off. The naked paddlers, seated at intervals down
  either side, strain their toes against a thwart or a rib. The leading paddler
  yells, and off you go with a swing and a rhythmic thunder as they all bring
  their paddles hard against the boat's side at the end of each stroke. Fifty
  &mdash;sixty&mdash;seventy&mdash;perhaps a hundred strokes they take at top
  speed, and the passenger settles down to enjoy himself, for there is no more
  captivating motion in the world. Then suddenly they stop, and all begin
  arguing at top of their lungs. Unless the passenger is a man of swift
  decision and firm purpose there is frequently a fight at that stage, likely
  to end in overturned canoes and an adventure among the crocodiles.</p>

  <p>Our voyage broke no precedents. We started off in fine style, feeling like
  old-time emperors traveling in state; and within ten minutes we were using
  paddles ourselves to poke and beat our men into understanding of the laws of
  balance, they abusing one another while the canoes rocked and took in water
  through the loosely laid on planks.</p>

  <p>The fiber stitching began to give out very soon after that, because when
  not in use the canoes were always hauled out somewhere and the dried-out
  fiber cracked and broke. We had all to sit to one side while some one
  re-stitched the planking. Later, when a wind came up and the quick short sea
  arose peculiar to lakes, we were very glad we had done that job so early.</p>

  <p>It was only the first mile that as much as suggested enjoyment. Never
  accustomed to much paddling in any case, our own men had suffered from hunger
  and confinement in the reeking hot dhow. Then, hippo meat needs hours of
  cooking to be wholesome (our own share of it was still in the pot, waiting to
  be boiled more thoroughly at the next halting place). They had merely toasted
  their tough lumps in the camp-fire embers and gobbled it. The result was a
  craving for sleep, noisily seconded by the chief's four men, who had eaten
  the stuff without cooking at all, and in enormous quantities.</p>

  <p>We began with a keen determination to overhaul the dhow, that dwindled as
  we had time to think the matter over; wondering what we should do with two
  such women in case we should capture them, and how we should prevent Coutlass
  in that case from acting like a savage.</p>

  <p>"Why don't we leave 'em to make their own explanations?" I proposed at
  last. "We can claim our few belongings at any time if we see fit." But the
  suggestion took time to recommend itself.</p>

  <p>That night until nearly morning we fretted at every rest the paddlers took
  &mdash;drove them unmercifully&mdash;ran risks of overturning on the slippery
  shoulders of partly submerged rocks&mdash;took long turns ourselves to
  relieve the weary men, Coutlass working harder than the rest of us. It would
  have been a bad night's work if we had overhauled the dhow and loosed him to
  do his will.</p>

  <p>"Think of the baggage!" he kept shouting to the night at large. "Lying in
  the arms of Georges Coutlass, kissing and being kissed, simply to rob him
  &mdash;Coutlass&mdash;me! Think of it! Only think of it. She lay in the hook
  of my right arm and only thought of how to win back the favor of the other
  she-hellion! And I was deceived by such a cabbage! Wait though! Nobody ever
  turned a trick on Georges Coutlass more than once! Wait till we catch them!
  See what I do to them! I don't forget Kamarajes either, or that bastard de
  Sousa, also pretending they were friends of mine! Heiah! Hurry! Drive the
  paddles in, you lazy black men!"</p>

  <p>It was more his hunger for revenge than any other one thing that tipped
  the scales of indecision and called us off the chase. A little before
  morning, at about that darkest hour, when the stars have seen the coming sun
  but the world is not yet aware of it, Fred called to us to turn in toward a
  barren-looking hill of granite that rose almost sheer out of the water but at
  one corner offered a shelving landing place. There we all clambered out to
  stretch cramped muscles and make a fire to cook the hippo's tongue, Coutlass
  cursing us for letting what he called idleness come between us and
  revenge.</p>

  <p>Kazimoto had scarcely more than gathered an armful of wood, thrown it
  down, and gone to hunt for more; one of the other boys had struck a match,
  and the first little flicker of crimson fire and purple smoke was starting to
  curl skyward, when Fred jumped on it and stamped it out.</p>

  <p>"Silence!" he ordered. "Keep still every one!" and repeated it twice in
  Kiswahili for the natives' benefit.</p>

  <p>We could not see at first which way he was staring through the darkness.
  It was more than two minutes before I knew what had alarmed him, and then it
  was sound, not sight that gave me the first clue. There came a purring from
  the lake; and when I had searched for a minute for the source of it I saw the
  glow we had watched from the dhow in the storm the first night out&mdash; the
  telltale crimson stain on the dark that rides above a steamer's funnel, and
  at intervals a stream of sparks to prove they were burning wood and driving
  her at top speed.</p>

  <p>"It can't be the German launch," said I.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" demanded Fred irritably. He knew I knew it was the German
  launch as certainly as he did.</p>

  <p>"How can they have patched her boiler?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"How many beans make five? They've done it, and there she goes! No other
  launch on the lake can make that speed! I've heard the British railway people
  have a launch or two, but they're small enough to have traveled down the line
  on ordinary trucks. That's the German launch and Schillingschen as surely as
  we stand here!"</p>

  <p>We waited there until dawn, arguing at intervals, not daring to light a
  fire, nor caring to sleep, Coutlass sitting apart and laughing every now and
  then like a hyena.</p>

  <p>"If the men weren't so dead beat I'd be for carrying on, said Fred.</p>

  <p>"What's the use?" argued Brown. "We can't catch the bally launch, can we?
  Soon as it's daylight they'd see us, like as not. I hope to get drunk once
  more before I die! Schillingschen 'ud run us down, an' good-bye us!"</p>

  <p>"I'd say follow them if the men could make it," Will agreed. "But what's
  the odds? It's us they're after. They'll dare do nothing to the women on the
  dhow&mdash;in British waters."</p>

  <p>"That's so," I agreed, not believing a word of it, any more than they. One
  had to calm one's feelings somehow; the men were too weary to drive the
  canoes another mile at anything like speed. Coutlass, who had heard every
  word of the argument, burst out into such yells of laughter that Fred threw a
  rock at him. "Curse you, you ghoul!"</p>

  <p>Coutlass changed his tone from demoniacal delight to quieter, grim
  amusement.</p>

  <p>"They will do nothing, eh? It is I, Georges Coutlass, who need do nothing!
  I have my revenge by proxy! Wait and see!"</p>

  <p>Fred threw a second rock, and hit him squarely.</p>

  <p>"Gassharamminy!" swore the Greek. "Do you know that rock is harder than a
  man's head?"</p>

  <p>Fred let the boys light a fire when the sun had risen high enough to make
  the little blaze not noticeable. Most of the men were asleep, but though our
  eyes ached with the long vigil we could not have copied them. About three
  hours after daylight we breakfasted off slices of hot boiled hippo tongue and
  cold lake water, without salt or condiments of any kind, and with discontent
  increased by that unpleasing feast we aroused the boys and drove them into
  the canoes.</p>

  <p>We forced the pace again, and picked up smoke on the sky-line an hour
  before noon, but it was not from a steamer's funnel. It was lazy,
  flat-flowing, spreading smoke with a look of iniquity about it that sent our
  hearts to our mouths. We paddled toward it with frenzied energy, and long
  before any of us could make out details Coutlass, standing balancing himself
  amidships, told us what we knew was true and flatly refused to believe.</p>

  <p>"It's the Queen of Sheba burning to the water-line!"</p>

  <p>"Sit down, you fool, or you'll upset us!"</p>

  <p>"She's gutted already&mdash;the flame is about finished! nothing now but
  smoke!"</p>

  <p>"Sit down, you lying idiot, and hold your tongue!"</p>

  <p>"I can see the smoke of the German launch now! Don't you all see it?
  Straight ahead beyond the smoke of the dhow! They've burned the dhow and
  steamed away! I'll bet you a million pounds they've killed everybody&mdash;
  shot 'em, or burned 'em alive, or drowned 'em!"</p>

  <p>"Did you hear me tell you to sit down? I'll tip you overboard and make you
  swim for shore&mdash;d'ye see those crocodiles? Ugh! Look at the brutes! In
  you go among the crocks if you don't sit down at once!"</p>

  <p>Coutlass took no notice of the threat, but rocked the canoe recklessly as
  he stood on tiptoe.</p>

  <p>"Think of their gall! By Bacchus, they're steaming for British East! I bet
  you five million pounds to a kick they think they've drowned the lot of us!
  They're going to steam in and report the accident!"</p>

  <p>We got him to sit down at last by ordering the paddlers nearest him to
  throw him overboard, but nothing would stop his evil croaking any more than
  flat refusal to admit the truth of what he gloated over lessened our real
  conviction.</p>

  <p>Long before we reached the dhow there was no room left for unbelief. The
  stern planks were charred, but stood erect, unburned yet, and the blue and
  white paint smeared on them was surely that of the Queen of Sheba. When we
  came within fifty yards the water was full of loathsome reptiles; our paddles
  actually struck them as they swarmed after the prey, snapping at one another
  and at our canoes&mdash;long, slimy-looking monsters, as able to smell
  carrion in the distance as kites are to see.</p>

  <p>There were garments on the water&mdash;blankets&mdash;and one soaked,
  torn, lacy thing that certainly had been a woman's. More than a dozen
  crocodiles fought around that. We tried to go close enough to see whether
  there were dead bodies in the dhow's charred hull, but as if the very ripple
  from our paddles were the last straw, the wreck dipped suddenly ten feet from
  us and plunged, the crocodiles following it down into deep water with lashing
  tails&mdash;swifter than fish.</p>

  <p>We paddled about for an hour in the blistering sun, searching stupidly for
  what we knew we could never find; crocodiles remove traces of identity more
  swiftly than kites and crows.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet you they thought we were on board!" gleed Coutlass. "I'll bet
  you they opened fire, and when we didn't answer came to the conclusion we had
  no ammunition. Then they steamed close enough to throw kerosene on board and
  light it! I bet you they steamed round and round and watched the people jump
  as the flames drove them overboard! Or d'you think they shot them all, and
  then threw them overboard and fired the dhow? No&mdash;then they'd have known
  we weren't on the dhow; they'd have steamed back then to find us; they
  thought we were in the dhow!" They thought we were hiding below deck! They're
  going to British East to take their Bible oaths they saw us burn and drown!
  Isn't that a joke! Isn't that a good one! Gassharamminy! But I'd give my hope
  of heaven to know whether they shot the women first or watched them jump
  among the crocodiles when the heat grew fierce!"</p>

  <p>We paddled to another rocky island&mdash;one that had trees on it, and
  rested through the heat of the day when we had killed all the snakes that had
  forestalled us in the shade. There, after again eating hippo-tongue
  unseasoned and ungarnished, we held a council of war, and Fred produced the
  map that Rebecca stole from Coutlass.</p>

  <p>"If we make for a township now&mdash;Kisumu is the nearest&mdash;about
  five and twenty miles away," said Fred, "we can give ourselves the pleasure
  of surprising Schillingschen, and of course we can get a square meal and some
  clothes and soap and so on&mdash;incidentally perhaps some rifles and
  ammunition. But we can't prove a thing against Schillingschen, and he has
  enough pull with British officials to make things deuced unpleasant for us,
  for a time at least. Consider the other side of it. Suppose we don't make for
  a station. Schillingschen reports us dead. Nobody looks for us&mdash;unless
  perhaps out on the lake for a hat or some scrap of clothing by way of
  corroborative evidence. Suppose we paddle out of this gulf and take to shore
  somewhere along the north end of the lake. We've no food, no tents, only one
  gun, next to no ammunition, nothing but money and a purpose. We don't know
  what chance we have of getting supplies, and particularly rifles, without
  letting any one know where we are, but we do know we've a clear field and a
  straight mark for Elgon, where rumor says&mdash;and Courtney said&mdash; and
  Schillingschen thinks&mdash;and this map says the ivory ought to be! The odds
  are against us&mdash;climate&mdash;starvation&mdash;wild
  beasts&mdash;savages&mdash;last and not least, the government, if they ever
  get wind of our being beyond bounds. Are we willing to take the chance, or
  are we not?"</p>

  <p>We talked it over for an hour, Coutlass listening all ears to most of what
  we said, although we drove him to the farthest limit of the shade trees. We
  were in two minds whether or not it mattered if he listened, and made the
  usual two-minds hash of it. Finally we put it to a vote, letting Brown have a
  voice with the rest of us. He was in favor of anything that offered prospect
  of a gamble; and we remembered the letter in code we had given the missionary
  to mail to Monty. We had told him in that that we should make tracks for
  Elgon, and we all voted the same way.</p>

  <p>"In other words" grinned Fred, "we're perfect idiots, and ready and
  willing to prove it! Good! If you fellows had voted the other way I'd have
  gone forward to Elgon alone!"</p>

  <p>It was then that Georges Coutlass took a hand in the game again. He came
  striding through the trees with something of his old swagger, and sat down
  among us with an air.</p>

  <p>"Count me in!" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"D'you mean in the lake?" suggested Fred.</p>

  <p>"In on the trip to Mount Elgon!"</p>

  <p>"We've had nearly enough of you!" Fred answered. "I know what's coming! If
  you don't come with us you'll tell tales? Blackmail, eh? Well, it won't work!
  We'll set you ashore on the mainland, and if you dare show yourself to
  Schillingschen or any British official, we'll run that risk cheerfully!"</p>

  <p>But Coutlass was imperturbable for once. He laid a hand on Fred's knee,
  and changed his tone to one of gentle persuasion between friend and
  friend.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Mr. Oakes, I know you now too well! You are not the man to leave me
  in the lurch! These others perhaps! You never! You know me, too. You have
  seen me under all conditions. You are able to judge my character. You know
  how firm a friend I can be, as well as how savage an enemy! You know I would
  never be false to a friend such as you&mdash;to a man whom I admire as I do
  you!"</p>

  <p>Will Yerkes, who had tried to keep a straight face, now went off into
  peals of laughter, rolling over on his back and rocking his legs in the air
  &mdash;a performance that did not appear to discourage Coutlass in the least.
  Brown was far from amused. He advised throwing the Greek into the lake.</p>

  <p>"Remember those cattle o' mine!" he insisted.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" agreed Coutlass. "Remember those cattle! Consider what a man of
  quick decision and courage I am! How useful I can be! What a forager! What a
  guide! What a fighting man! What a hunter! What a liar on behalf of my
  friends! What a danger for my friends' enemies! What are the cattle of a
  drunkard like Brown&mdash;the poor unhappy sot!&mdash;compared to the
  momentary needs of a gentleman! Ah! By the ordeal! I am a gentleman, and that
  is the secret of it all! You, Mr. Oakes, as one brave gentleman, can not
  despise the right hand of friendship of Georges Coutlass, another gentleman!
  I know you can not! You haven't it in you! You were born under another star
  than that! I have confidence! I sit contented!"</p>

  <p>"You good-for-nothing villain!" Fred grinned. "I'll take you at your
  word!" and Brown of Lumbwa gasped, the very hairs of his red beard
  bristling.</p>

  <p>"I knew you would!" said Coutlass calmly. "These others are not gentlemen.
  They do not understand."</p>

  <p>"If your word is good for anything," Fred continued.</p>

  <p>"My word is my bond!" said the Greek.</p>

  <p>"And you really want to prove yourself my friend&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I would go to hell for you and bring you back the devil's favorite
  wife!"</p>

  <p>"I will set you on the mainland, to go and recover those cattle of Mr.
  Brown's from the Masai who raided them! Return them to Lumbwa, and I'll
  guarantee Brown shall shake hands with you!"</p>

  <p>"Pah! Brown! That drunkard!"</p>

  <p>"See here!" said Brown, getting up and peeling off his coat. "I've had
  enough of being called drunkard by you. Put up your dukes!"</p>

  <p>But a fight between Brown and the Greek with bare fists would have been
  little short of murder. Brown was in no condition to thrash that wiry
  customer, and we in no mood to see Coutlass get the better of him.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool, Brown! Sit down!" ordered Fred, and having saved his
  face Brown condescended readily enough.</p>

  <p>"What you said's right," he admitted. "Let him get my cattle back afore
  he's fit to fight a gentleman!"</p>

  <p>And so the matter was left for the present, with Georges Coutlass under
  sentence of abandonment to his own devices as soon as we could do that
  without entailing his starvation. We had no right to have pity for the
  rascal; he had no claim whatever on our generosity; yet I think even Brown
  would not have consented to deserting him on any of those barren islands,
  whatever the risk of his spoiling our plans as soon as we should let him out
  of sight.</p>

  <p>From then until we beached the canoes at last in a gap in the papyrus on
  the lake's northern shore, we pressed forward like hunted men. For one thing,
  the very thought of boiled meat without bread, salt, or vegetables grew
  detestable even to the natives after the second or third meal, although hippo
  tongue is good food. We tried green stuff gathered on the islands, but it
  proved either bitter or else nauseating, and although our boys gathered bark
  and roots that they said were fit for food, it was noticeable that they did
  not eat much of it themselves. The simplest course was to race for the shore
  with as little rest and as little sleep as the men could do with.</p>

  <p>However, we were not noticeably better off when we first set foot on
  shore. There was nothing but short grass growing on the thin soil that only
  partly hid the volcanic rock and manganese iron ore. Victoria Nyanza is the
  crater of a once enormous, long ago extinct volcano, and we stood on a shelf
  of rock about a thousand feet below what had been the upper rim&mdash;a chain
  of mountains leading away toward the north higher and higher, until they
  culminated in Mount Elgon, another extinct volcano fourteen thousand feet
  above sea level.</p>

  <p>It was not unexplored land where we stood, but it was so little known that
  the existence of white men was said to be a matter of some doubt among
  natives a mile or two to either side of the old safari route that passed from
  east to west. We could see no villages, although we marched for hours, the
  loaned canoe-men tagging along behind us, hungrier than we, until at last
  over the back of a long low spur we spied the tops of growing kaffir
  corn.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>kaffir corn</i>&mdash;a tropical African variety of
  sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) grown in dry regions and in the Great Plains for
  grain and forage. <i><a href=
  "http://www.bartleby.com/61/23/K0002300.html">The American Heritage
  Dictionary</a></i>. For more information, see the <i>Wikipedia</i> article
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durra">Durra</a>. ]</p>

  <p>At sight of that we broke into a run and burst on the field of grain like
  a pack of the dog-baboons that swoop from the hills and make havoc. We seized
  the heads of grain, rubbed them between our hands, and had munched our fill
  before we were seen by the jealous owners. A small boy herding hump-backed
  cattle down in the valley watched us for a minute, and then deserted his
  charge to report to the village hidden behind a clump of trees. Ten minutes
  after that we were surrounded by naked black giants, all armed with spears
  and a personal smell that outstank one's notions of Gehenna.</p>

  <p>We had nothing to offer them, except money, for which they obviously had
  not the slightest use. None of us knew their language. From their point of
  view we were thieves taken in the act, all but one of us unarmed as far as
  they knew, to be judged by the tribal standard that for more centuries than
  men remember has decreed that the thief shall die. They were most incensed at
  the four unhappy islanders, probably on the same principle that dogs pick on
  the weakest, and fight most readily with dogs of a more or less similar
  breed.</p>

  <p>It was Coutlass who saved that situation. He instantly went crazy, or the
  next thing to it, wrinkling up his black-whiskered face into a caricature,
  yelling a Greek monologue in a refrain consisting of five notes repeated over
  and over, and dancing around in a wide ring with one leg shorter than the
  other and his arms executing symbols of witchcraft.</p>

  <p>The chief was the biggest man&mdash;not an inch less than seven feet
  &mdash;black as ebony, from the curly hair, into which his patient wives had
  plaited fiber to hang in a greasy lump over his neck, all down his naked body
  to the soles of his enormous feet. Each time he came in front of that
  individual Coutlass paused and executed special finger movements, like the
  trills of a super-pianist, ending invariably in a punctuation point that made
  the savage shiver.</p>

  <p>The fifth time round, to avoid the accusing fingers, the giant dodged
  behind a smaller man, who dodged behind a woman, who promptly turned and ran,
  swinging in the wind behind her a bustle like a horse's tail that was her
  only garment. Her flight was the touch that settled the decision in our
  favor. We all began to do a mumbo-jumbo dance around Coutlass, and in five
  seconds more the whole armed party was in full retreat, holding their spears
  behind them as some sort of protection against magic.</p>

  <p>"After that," said Coutlass proudly, "will you still dismiss me from your
  party, gentlemen?"</p>

  <p>"You've got to go and find Brown's cattle and return them to him!" Fred
  answered firmly. But we none of us felt like sending him packing until he was
  better fed and some provision could be made for his safety on the road. It
  was wonderful, the number of excuses that flocked through my mind for
  befriending the ruffian, and later on I found it was the same with Fred and
  Will. Brown, on the other hand, affected indignation at his being allowed to
  go with us another yard.</p>

  <p>"Make a rope o' grass an' hang the swine!" he grumbled.</p>

  <p>We decided to march on the village, retreat being obviously far too
  dangerous, and the only likely safe course being to follow up the chance
  success. Sleep another night in the open among the mosquitoes and wild
  beasts, besides making us wretched at the mere suggestion, was likely to
  bring us all down with fever. We preferred the thought of fever to the
  loneliness; for man is unlike all other nomads, and that is why the dog takes
  kindly to him; he must have a home of his own&mdash;a portable one, if you
  will&mdash;a tub like Diogenes&mdash;a Bedouin's tent&mdash;a cave, or a hole
  in the ground&mdash;something, so be he may rent it or own it or know for a
  fact he may sleep there when night comes. Life in the open is only good fun
  when there is cover to take to at will.</p>

  <p>All the way along the winding foot-track leading in every imaginable
  direction except toward the village, and only turning suddenly toward it when
  we had grown disgusted and decided to leave it and try to find another, Brown
  kept pointing out trees with suitable overhanging arms to which we might hang
  Coutlass. The Greek, with eyes for nothing but the fat, hump-backed village
  cattle in the distance, seemed to think only of them, until Will commented on
  the fact, and Fred saw fit to drop a hint.</p>

  <p>"Steal as much as a young calf, Coutlass, and we'll let Brown choose the
  tree! Try it on if you don't believe me!"</p>

  <p>The villagers closed their gate against us by dragging great piles of
  thorn across the gap in the rough palisade, but, as Coutlass pointed out,
  they would have to open it up again to let the cattle in before dark, so we
  sat down and ate the remaining fragments of the hippo tongue&mdash;no
  ambrosia by that time; it had to be eaten, to save it from utter waste!</p>

  <p>Then Coutlass once more did a first-class devil dance backward and forward
  this time before the gate, putting genius into it and fear into the hearts of
  the defenders. Kazimoto helped even more than he by discovering a native
  within the palisade who could speak a common tongue.</p>

  <p>Their villagers held a very noisy council on their side of the thorn
  obstruction, under the apparent impression that it was sound- and
  bullet-proof. It was beginning to be pretty obvious that a man who advised
  volleying through the crevices with spears was winning the argument when
  Kazimoto detected familiar accents and raised his voice. After that the
  barricade was dragged aside within ten minutes and we entered, if not in
  honor, at least in temporary safety.</p>

  <p>Luxury is a question of contrast. That evening in a hut assigned to us by
  the chief, squatting on the trodden cow-dung floor, leaning against the
  dried-mud sides, with a little fire of sticks in the midst to give us light
  and keep mosquitoes at a distance at the expense of almost unbearable heat,
  we ate porridge made from mama as they call their kaffir corn, and washed it
  down with milk&mdash;good rich cows' milk, milked by Kazimoto into our own
  metal pot instead of their unwashed gourds. Lucullus never dined better.</p>

  <p>The feast was only rather spoiled by two things: we all had chiggers in
  our feet&mdash;the minute fleas that haunt the dust of native villages and
  insert themselves under toe-nails to grow great and lay their eggs. (Nearly
  every native in the village had more than one toe missing.) And the chief
  felt obliged to insert his smelly presence among us and ask innumerable
  idiotic questions through the medium of his interpreter and Kazimoto. He
  received some astonishing answers, but would not have been satisfied with
  anything more reasonable. We wanted him satisfied, and gave our interpreter
  free rein.</p>

  <p>The main trouble was we had nothing of value to offer him. Money was
  something he had no knowledge of. He wanted beads of a certain size and
  color; for two handfuls of them he expressed himself willing to be our friend
  for life. We had to educate him about money, and Kazimoto assured him that
  the silver rupees Fred produced from a bag were so precious that governments
  went to war to get them away from other governments.</p>

  <p>But the impression still prevailed that we were wasikini&mdash;poor men;
  and that is a fatal qualification in the savage mind.</p>

  <p>"Why have you only one gun?"</p>

  <p>In vain Kazimoto assured him that we had dozens of guns "at home"&mdash;
  that Fred's landed possessions were so vast that two hundred strong men
  walking for a month would be unable to march across them&mdash;that Fred's
  wives (Fred seemed to live under a cloud of sexual scandal in those days)
  were so many in number they had to be counted twice a day to make sure none
  was missing.</p>

  <p>The chief had eighteen wives of his own to show. He could prove his
  matrimonial felicity. Why had Fred left his behind? How did he dare? Who
  looked after them? Had he left the guns behind to guard the women? Why did
  such a rich man travel without food for his men? The chief had seen us with
  his own eyes devour porridge as if we were starving.</p>

  <p>To have told him the truth would have been worse than useless. To have
  mentioned such a thing as shipwreck would only have stirred the savage
  instinct to prey off all unfortunates. Failing evidence of wealth in our
  possession, the only feasible plan was to claim so much that he might believe
  some of it, and it was Coutlass, drawing a bow at a venture, who ordered
  Kazimoto to tell him that we expected a party in a few days bringing tents,
  provisions and more guns.</p>

  <p>"There will be blue-and-white beads of the sort you long for among those
  loads," added Kazimoto on his own account; and that eased the chief's mind
  for the night. Fred gave him a half-rupee, and promised him to exchange it
  when the loads should come for as many of the beads as he could seize in his
  two fists. The chief went out to brag to the village, opening and closing his
  fists to see how huge their compass was; and later that night his wives had
  to be beaten for fighting. They were jealous because the fattest and the
  youngest new one had both been promised double shares.</p>

  <p>There was another fight because our porters emerged from their hut and
  demanded that a barren cow out of the village herd be butchered. They made
  their meaning perfectly clear by taking the cow by the horns and tail and
  throwing her on her back. Fred decided that argument with a thick stick about
  four feet long.</p>

  <p>The unusual spectacle of some one taking sides against his own men,
  whatever the rights or wrongs of it, so affected the chief that he entered
  our hut next morning disposed to hold us up for double promises of beads. It
  was evident we had to deal with a born extortioner. He would increase his
  demands with every fresh concession.</p>

  <p>"Oh, what's the odds!" laughed Coutlass. "Promise him anything! The only
  loads likely to come along this way for a year or two are
  Schillingschen's!"</p>

  <p>Fred told the chief he would think the matter over, and chased him out of
  the hut. Coutlass had given us all a new idea in an instant, and he was the
  only one who did not see its point&mdash;he, the only one who did not give a
  snap of the fingers for the laws of any land!</p>

  <p>"D'you suppose&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Too good to hope for!"</p>

  <p>"If he thinks we're dead&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"And if he believes in that map&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He'll not need the map. He'll have memorized it. There's only a circle
  drawn on it to mark the Elgon district. All the old pencil marks have been
  rubbed out as he searched the other likely places and drew them all
  blank."</p>

  <p>"He'll travel without military escort?"</p>

  <p>"Sure! He won't want witnesses! He'll make believe it's a scientific trip.
  Remember, he's a professor of ethnology. That's how he puts it all over the
  British and goes where he pleases without as much as by-your-leave."</p>

  <p>"Say, fellows! It's a moral cinch that when we broke away from Muanza he
  made up his mind in a flash to return to British East and destroy us on the
  way. He thinks he made a clean job of that. I'll bet he loaded the launch
  down with stuff for a long safari, and thinks now he has a clear run and can
  take his time!"</p>

  <p>"If that's how the cards lie, the game's ours!"</p>

  <p>Coutlass saw the point at last and offered himself on the altar of
  forgiveness and friendship.</p>

  <p>"Make me your partner, gentlemen, and if he travels within a hundred miles
  of this I will crawl into that Schillingschen's tent in the night and slit
  his throat! I would murder him as willingly as I eat when I am hungry!"</p>

  <p>"Your job has been assigned you!" answered Fred. "When Mr. Brown's cattle
  are back in Lumbwa perhaps we'll give you something else to do!"</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Coutlass had outlined in a flash the limits of the plan. We
  would draw the line at murdering even Schillingschen, but must help ourselves
  to his outfit as our only chance of re-outfitting without betraying our
  presence in British East. But the plan was not without rat-holes in it that a
  fool could see.</p>

  <p>"Schillingschen's boys will escape and run to the nearest British official
  with the story!"</p>

  <p>"And the British official will be so full of the importance of
  Schillingschen and the need of protecting his beastly carcass&mdash;to say
  nothing of the everlasting disgrace of letting him be scoughed on British
  territory&mdash;and the official reprimand from home that's sure to follow
  &mdash;that he'll come hot-foot to investigate!"</p>

  <p>"We'll have to provide against that," said Fred, and we all laughed,
  including Coutlass. Talk of provisions is easy when you have no means out of
  which to provide. It did not occur to include Coutlass in the calculations,
  or to dismiss him from them; but without exchanging any remarks on the
  subject it was clear enough to all of us that no such plan could hope to
  succeed with the Greek at large, at liberty to spoil it. We saw we should
  have to keep him in our party for the present.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget," said Coutlass, more accustomed than we to seizing the
  strategic points of desperate situations, "that Schillingschen will have his
  own boys with him from German East."</p>

  <p>"I didn't see any with him on the launch," I objected.</p>

  <p>"He would never have come without them" Coutlass insisted. "He made them
  lie below the water-line out of reach of bullets at the only time when you
  might have seen them! He wouldn't trust himself to British porters. My word,
  no! That devil knows natives! He knows some of them might be British
  government spies! He'll have his own boys,&mdash;if they can't carry all his
  loads he'll buy donkeys at Mumias; there are always donkeys to be bought at
  that place, brought down from Turkana by the Arab ivory traders. Do donkeys
  talk?"</p>

  <p>At any rate, we talked, and made no bones at all about including Georges
  Coutlass in the conversation. It was his suggestion that we should send
  natives to look out for Schillingschen, and Fred's amendment that reduced the
  messengers to one, and that one Kazimoto. Any of the others might decide to
  desert, once out of sight, and we could scarcely have blamed them, for their
  path had not lain among roses in our company.</p>

  <p>Kazimoto had a million objections to offer against going alone on that
  errand, as, for instance, that the chigger fleas would invade our toe-nails
  disastrously without his cunning fingers to hunt them out again. He also
  prophesied that without him to interpret there would swiftly be trouble
  between us and the chief; but we saw the other side of that medal and rather
  looked forward to an interval when the chief should not be able to talk to us
  at all.</p>

  <p>At last, on the second morning after our arrival at the village, Kazimoto
  wrapped an enormous mound of cold mtama pudding in a cloth and went his way,
  prophesying darkly of murder and sudden death lurking behind rocks and trees,
  as unwishful to be alone as a terrier without a master, but much too faithful
  to refuse duty.</p>

  <p>The chief saw a side of the medal that we had not guessed existed. He came
  and sat beside us like an evil-smelling shadow, satisfied that now we could
  not dismiss him, he being under no obligation to understand gestures.
  Curiosity was the impelling motive, but he was not without suspicion. Fred
  said he reminded him of a Bloomsbury landlady whose lodgers had not paid
  their board and rooming in advance.</p>

  <p>Will solved that problem by taking the rifle, and one cartridge that Fred
  doled out grudgingly, and after a long day's stalking among mosquitoes in the
  papyrus at the edge of the lake five miles away, at imminent risk of
  crocodiles and an even worse horror we had not yet suspected, shooting a
  hippopotamus. Forthwith the whole village, chief included, went to cut up and
  carry off the meat, and there followed revelry by night, the chiefs wives
  brewing beer from the mtama, and all getting drunk as well as gorged.
  Coutlass and Brown got more drunk than any one.</p>

  <p>Will came back with flies on his coat&mdash;three large things like
  horse-flies, that crossed their wings in repose, resembling in all other
  respects the common tsetse fly. He said the reeds by the lake-side were full
  of them.</p>

  <p>Remembering tales about sleeping sickness, and suspicion of conveying it
  said to rest on a tsetse fly that crossed its wings, I went out the following
  day and walked many miles east-ward, taking with me the only two sober
  villagers I could find. They came willingly enough for five miles, thinking,
  I suppose, that I intended to follow Will's example and kill some more meat
  (although, as I did not take the rifle with me, they were not guilty of much
  dead-weight reasoning).</p>

  <p>At the bank of the fifth stream we came to they stopped, and refused to go
  another yard. Thinking they were merely lusting after the meat and beer in
  the village, I took a stick to drive them across the stream in front of me,
  but they dodged in terror and ran back home as if the devil had been after
  them.</p>

  <p>I crossed the stream and continued forward alone about another mile toward
  a fairly large village visible between great blue boulders with cactus dotted
  all about. There was the usual herd of cattle grazing near at hand, but the
  place had an unaccountable forlorn look, and the small boy standing on an
  ant-hill to watch the cattle seemed too listless to be curious, and too
  indifferent to run away. The big brown tsetse flies, that crossed their wings
  when resting, were everywhere, making no noise at all, but announcing
  themselves every once in a while by a bite on the back of the hand that stung
  like a whip-lash. They seemed to have special liking for coat-sleeves, and a
  dozen of them were generally riding on each side of me. One could drive them
  off, but they came back at once, as horse-flies do when poked off with a
  whip.</p>

  <p>When I drew near the village nobody came out to look at me, which was
  suspicious in itself. Nobody shouted. Nobody blocked the way, or dragged
  thorn-bushes across the gateway. There were black men and women there,
  sitting in the shadows of the eaves, who looked up and stared at me&mdash;
  men and women too intent on sitting still to care whether their skins were
  glossy&mdash;unoiled, unwashed, unfed, by the look of them&mdash; skeletons
  clothed in leather and dust, desiring death, but cruelly denied it.</p>

  <p>One man, thin as a wisp of smoke, rushed at me from the shadow of a hut
  door and tried to bite my leg. The merest push sent him rolling over, and
  there he lay, too overcome by inertia to move another inch, his arm uplifted
  in the act of self-defense. Nobody else in the village stirred. There were
  more huts than people, more kites on the roofs than huts. Some of the
  littlest children played in the hut doors, but nearly all of them were
  listless like the grown folk. The only sign of normal activity was the big
  black earthen jars that witnessed that the women performed part at least of
  their daily round by bringing water from the lake.</p>

  <p>I returned late that afternoon, walking, as it were, out of a belt of
  tsetse flies. On one side of a narrow stream they were thick together; to the
  west of it there were scarcely any, although the wind blew from east to
  west.</p>

  <p>"There's no fear of news about us reaching any government official," I
  announced. "There's a curtain of death between us and the government that
  even suspicion couldn't penetrate!"</p>

  [* It is a characteristic of the so-called Sleeping Sickness that is
  decimating the tribes around Victoria Nyanza that the victim, although he
  goes into a coma, never actually sleeps from the time of taking the disease
  until the end, usually more than a year later. The natives, a tribe that came
  originally down from Egypt, themselves say that the dreaded sickness is a
  "visitation" by way of revenge on them for former sins, although what sins,
  and whose vengeance, they are at a total loss to explain.]</p><br>

  <p class="first">KAZIMOTO was gone five days, and then came preceded by proof
  of the news he brought. He came in the evening. In the morning, unaccountably
  from the northward, instead of from the westward where Uganda
  lay,&mdash;avoiding the regular safari route and the belt of sleeping
  sickness villages, came a genial, sleek, shiny Baganda, arrayed in khaki
  coat, red fez, and bordered loin-cloth, gifted with tongues, and
  self-confident beyond belief.</p>

  <p>He knew nothing of us at first, for we sat in our hut with a smudge going,
  nervous about flies, even Coutlass, reckless as a rule of anything he could
  not see, and perfectly indifferent to death for others, now fidgety and
  afraid to swagger forth.</p>

  <p>One of our Nyamwezi porters suddenly made a great shout of "Hodi!" and
  came stooping through the low door, standing erect again inside to await our
  pleasure. We could hear others outside, listening under the eaves. When we
  had kept him waiting sufficiently long to prevent his getting too much notion
  of his own importance, Fred nodded to him to speak.</p>

  <p>"Is it true, bwana," he asked, "that the Germans will come soon and
  conquer this part of Africa?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not!" said Fred.</p>

  <p>"There is one out here, a Baganda, who says they will surely come. He says
  the religion of Islam will be preached from end to end of everywhere, and
  that the Germans are the true priests of Islam. They will come, says he, when
  the time is ripe, and call on all the converts of Islam to rise and slay all
  other people, including all white folk, like the English, who do not accept
  that creed. If that is true, bwana, whither shall we go, and whither shall
  you go, to escape such terrible things?"</p>

  <p>"Does the Baganda know there are white men in this village?" Fred
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Not yet, bwana."</p>

  <p>"Don't tell him, then, but bring him in here. Tell him there are folk in
  here who say he is a liar."</p>

  <p>The Nyamwezi backed out, and we heard whispering outside. There is
  precious little performance in Africa without a deal of talk. At the end of
  about ten minutes the porter again shouted "Hodi!" and this time was followed
  in by the stranger, seven other of our own men, uninvited, bringing up the
  rear.</p>

  <p>"Jambo!" said the Baganda, with a great effort at bravado, when his eyes
  had grown accustomed to the gloom and the first severe surprise of seeing
  white men had worn off. He was a very cool customer indeed.</p>

  <p>"Whose pimp are you?" demanded Fred, without answering the salutation.</p>

  <p>The man fell back on insolence at once. There is no native in Africa who
  takes more keenly to that weapon than the mission-schooled Baganda.</p>

  <p>"I am employed by a gentleman of superior position," he answered in
  perfectly good English.</p>

  <p>"In what capacity?" demanded Fred.</p>

  <p>"I am not employed to tell his secrets to the first strangers who ask
  me!"</p>

  <p>"Do you obey him implicitly?"</p>

  <p>"I do. I am honorable person. I receive his pay and do his bidding."</p>

  <p>"Is his name Schillingschen?"</p>

  <p>The Baganda hesitated.</p>

  <p>"All right," said Fred. "I know his name is Schillingschen. You have
  boasted that you do what he orders you. These men tell me you have said that
  the Germans are coming to conquer the country and destroy all people,
  including the English, who have not accepted Islam!"</p>

  <p>The man hesitated again, glancing over his shoulder to discover his
  retreat cut off by our porters, and eying Fred with malignity that reminded
  one of a cornered beast of prey. He could control his face, but not his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, sir!" he answered after swallowing a time or two. "How could they
  tell such lies against me! I am a person born in Uganda, now a British
  protectorate and enjoying all blessings of British rule. I am educated at the
  mission college at Entebbe. How should I tell such a tale against my
  benefactors?"</p>

  <p>"That is what you are here to explain!" Fred answered. "No! You can't
  escape, you hellion! Squat down and answer!"</p>

  <p>"All this stuff is pretty familiar," Will interrupted. "In the States
  there are always people going the rounds among our darkies preaching some
  form of treason. Over there we can afford to treat it as a joke&mdash;now and
  then an ugly one, and on the darkies!"</p>

  <p>"This is an ugly joke on a darkie, too!" grinned Fred.</p>

  <p>The Baganda made a sudden dive and a determined struggle to get through
  the door, but our porters were too quick and strong for him.</p>

  <p>"Confession is your one chance!" said Fred.</p>

  <p>"Put hot irons to his feet!" advised Coutlass. (The native beer had left
  him villainously evil-tempered.) "Gassharamminy! Leave me alone with that fat
  Baganda for half an hour, and I will make him tell me what is on the far side
  of the moon, as well as what his mother said and did before she bore
  him!"</p>

  <p>"Shall I hand you over to this Greek gentleman?" suggested Fred.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God, no!" the Baganda answered, trembling. "Hand me over to the
  bwana collector! He will put me in jail. I am not afraid of British jail! It
  will not be for long! The English do not punish as the Germans do! You dare
  not assault me! You dare not torture me! You must hand me over to the bwana
  collector to be tried in court of law. Nothing else is permissible! I shall
  receive short sentence, that is all, with reprieve after two-thirds time on
  account of good conduct!"</p>

  <p>"Make him prisoner in the sleeping sickness village you told us about!"
  advised Coutlass, lolling at ease on his elbow to watch the man's increasing
  fear.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, no! Oh, gentlemen! That is not how white Englishmen behave! You
  must either let me go, or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He made another terrific dive for liberty, biting and kicking at his
  captors, and finally lying on his back to scream as if the hot irons Coutlass
  had recommended were being applied in earnest.</p>

  <p>"What shall we do with the beast?" asked Fred. The hut was so full of his
  infernal screaming that we could talk without his hearing us.</p>

  <p>"Tie him up," I said. "If we let him go he'll run straight to
  Schillingschen."</p>

  <p>"Leave him here with Coutlass and me!" urged Brown. (He and Coutlass had
  grown almost friendly since getting drunk together on the native beer.)</p>

  <p>"I recommend," said Will, "that we take the law in our own hands&mdash;
  "</p>

  <p>The Baganda ceased screaming and listened. For some reason he suspected
  Will of being the deciding factor in our councils&mdash;perhaps because Will
  had said least.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;take the law in our own hands, and thrash him soundly. Later on we
  can report what we have done to the British government, and ask for
  condonation under the circumstances or pay whatever piffling fine they care
  to impose for the sake of appearances. The point is, there's no court of law
  in these parts to hand him over to, and he needs punishing."</p>

  <p>"I agree," said Fred. "Let's thrash him to begin with."</p>

  <p>"Let's thrash him," went on Will, "as thoroughly as we've seen his friends
  the Germans do the job!"</p>

  <p>"Both sides!" agreed Brown.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, no, no! You can not do that, gentlemen!"</p>

  <p>"Lay him out!" ordered Fred. "Let's begin on him. Who shall beat him
  first?"</p>

  <p>At a nod from Fred our porters stretched him face downward on the dry dung
  floor, and knelt on his arms and legs. One of them staffed a good handful of
  the dry dung into his mouth to stop his yelling.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Will, rather slowly and distinctly, "if he told us about
  Schillingschen, we'd have to let him off. Let's hope he holds his tongue, for
  I never wanted to flog a man so much in all my life!"</p>

  <p>The most palpable absurdity at the moment was that there was nothing in
  the hut to beat him with. There were dozens of strips of the recently shot
  hippo hide hanging in the sun outside to dry, with stones tied to the end of
  each, to keep them taut and straight, but nobody made a move to bring one
  in.</p>

  <p>"Take off his loin-cloth!" ordered Fred. "It won't hurt him enough with
  that thing on!"</p>

  <p>The Baganda spat the cow-dung from his mouth and struggled violently.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, no!" he shouted. "I will tell! I will tell everything!"</p>

  <p>"Too late now!" said Will jubilantly.</p>

  <p>"No, gentlemen, no! Not too late! I tell all&mdash;I tell quickly! Only
  listen! bwana Schillingschen will shoot me if he knows! He is very bad man
  &mdash;very kali&mdash;very fierce&mdash;and oh, too clever! You must protect
  me!"</p>

  <p>He could hardly get the words out, for the knees of our porters pinned him
  down, and his chin was pressed hard on the floor.</p>

  <p>"I ordered that loin-cloth removed!" was all Fred commented. One of the
  porters attended to the task, and the Baganda hurried with his tale, drawing
  in breath in noisy gasps like a man with asthma because of the weight of his
  captors on him and the strained position of his neck.</p>

  <p>"bwana Schillingschen is sending me and many other men&mdash;not all
  Baganda, but of many tribes&mdash;to go through all parts and say Islam is
  the only good religion&mdash;all Germans are high-priests of Islam&mdash;
  soon the Germans are coming with great armies to destroy the British and all
  other foolish people who have not accepted Islam as their creed! All are to
  get ready to receive the Germans."</p>

  <p>"Where is Schillingschen now?" demanded Fred.</p>

  <p>"Beyond Mumias."</p>

  <p>"How far beyond Mumias?"</p>

  <p>"Who knows? He is marching."</p>

  <p>"In which direction? What for?"</p>

  <p>"To Mount Elgon. I do not know what for."</p>

  <p>"How do you know he is going to Mount Elgon?"</p>

  <p>"He told me to go there and find him after my work is done."</p>

  <p>"How long were you to continue at what you call your work?"</p>

  <p>"A month or five weeks."</p>

  <p>"So he expects to stay a long time up there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know."</p>

  <p>"Has he many loads with him?"</p>

  <p>"Very many provisions for a long time."</p>

  <p>"Guns?"</p>

  <p>"Several. I do not know how many. He gives guns to some of his men when he
  gets to where the government will not know about it."</p>

  <p>"How many men has he?"</p>

  <p>"Not many. Ten, I think."</p>

  <p>"How can they carry all those loads?"</p>

  <p>"He brought a hundred porters from Kisumu to Mumias, and there bought more
  than forty donkeys, sending the porters back again."</p>

  <p>"Then are the men he has with him his own?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"From German East?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"What orders did he give you besides to tell these lies about German
  conquest?"</p>

  <p>"None.</p>

  <p>"Pass me that whip!" ordered Fred. There was no whip, but the Baganda
  could not know that.</p>

  <p>"He gave the same order to all of us," he yelled. "We are to stay out a
  month or five weeks unless we meet white men. If we meet white men we are to
  discover the white men's plans by talking with their servants, and then hurry
  to him and report."</p>

  <p>"Ah! How many other spies has he out in this direction?"</p>

  <p>"None."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you pass me that whip when I ask for it?" demanded Fred.</p>

  <p>"None! None! None, bwana! I am the only man in this direction! He has sent
  them north, south, east and west, but I am the only one down here."</p>

  <p>"He has a lot more to tell yet," said Coutlass. "Let me put hot irons on
  his feet!"</p>

  <p>Fred demurred. "He couldn't march with us if we did that!" he said with a
  perfectly straight face.</p>

  <p>"Who cares whether or not he marches!" answered Coutlass. "To tell all he
  knows is his business! Wait while I heat the iron!"</p>

  <p>The Baganda began to scream again, babbling that he knew no more. He
  assured us that Schillingschen had set the closest watch along the old
  caravan route, and toward his own rear in the direction of Kisumu, whence
  officials might come on chance errands.</p>

  <p>"All right," said Fred. "Truss him up tight and keep him prisoner among
  our men in their hut."</p>

  <p>"Our men are likely to get drunk tonight," warned Will.</p>

  <p>"Let me watch him!" urged Coutlass. "Leave me with him alone!"</p>

  <p>To the Greek's disgust we decided to trust the prisoner with our own men,
  and to keep very careful watch on them, threatening them with loss of all
  their pay if they dared get drunk and lose him&mdash;a threat they accepted
  at its full face value, but resented because of Brown's and the Greek's
  behavior the night before. They begged to get a little drunk&mdash;to get
  half as drunk as Brown had been&mdash;half as drunk as Coutlass had been
  &mdash;not drunk at all, but just to drink a little. We were adamant, and
  Brown added to their resentment by preaching them a sermon in their own
  tongue on the importance of being respectful toward white folk.</p>

  <p>Kazimoto came in toward dark, foot-weary, but primed with news, and most
  of what he had to say confirmed the Baganda's story. Schillingschen, he said,
  was making for Mount Elgon in very leisurely stages, letting his loaded
  donkeys graze their way along, and spending hours of his time in questioning
  natives along the way on every subject under the sun.</p>

  <p>Besides the fact of his leisurely progress, which was sufficiently
  important in itself, we learned from Kazimoto that Schillingschen's own ten
  boys were unable to speak the language of the country beyond a few of the
  commonest words&mdash;that they all slept in a tent together at night,
  usually quite a little distance apart from Schillingschen's&mdash;and that
  the donkeys were usually picketed between the two tents in a long line. He
  also told us the ten men had five Mauser rifles between them, in addition to
  the German's own battery of three guns, one of which he carried all day and
  kept beside his bed at night; the other two were carried behind him in the
  daytime by a gun-bearer.</p>

  <p>That was good news on the whole. Coutlass went out on the strength of it
  and began to drink beer from the big earthenware crock in which the women had
  just brewed a fresh supply. Brown joined him within five minutes, and at the
  end of an hour, they were swearing everlasting friendship, Coutlass promising
  Brown his cattle back, and Brown assuring him that Greece and the Greeks had
  always held his warmest possible regards.</p>

  <p>"Thermopylae, y'know, old boy, an' Marathon, an' all that kind o' thing!
  How many miles in a day could a Greek run in them days? Gosh!"</p>

  <p>They two drank themselves to sleep among the gentle cattle in the circular
  enclosure in the midst of the village, and we&mdash;going out in turns at
  intervals to make sure our own boys were not drinking&mdash;matured our plans
  in peace.</p>

  <p>We were too few to dare undertake the task in front of us without the aid
  of Brown and the Greek. It was a case of who was not against us must be for
  us, and the end must justify both men and means. We tried to work out ways of
  managing without them, but when we thought of our Baganda prisoner, and the
  almost certainty that both he and Coutlass would race to give our game away
  to Schillingschen if let out of sight for a minute, the necessity of making
  the best, not the worst, of the Greek seemed overwhelming.</p>

  <p>Early next morning, before the village had awakened from its glut of beer
  and hippo meat, we shook Coutlass and Brown to their feet none too gently,
  and, with the Baganda firmly secured by the wrists between two of our men,
  started off, Fred leading.</p>

  <p>The village awoke as if by magic before we bad dragged away the thorns
  from the gate, and the chief leaped to the realization that the beads he had
  promised his women were about as concrete as his drunken dreams. He and a
  swarm of his younger men followed us, begging and arguing&mdash;mile after
  mile&mdash;growing angrier and more importunate. It was by my advice that we
  crossed the stream into the sleeping sickness zone and left them shuddering
  on their own side. Our own men did not know so much about the ravages of that
  plague, and in any case were willing to dare whatever risks we despised. But
  we took a long bend back and crossed the stream again higher up as soon as
  the chief and his beggars were out of sight. It was a pity not to keep exact
  faith and give them the promised beads, if only for the sake of other white
  men who might camp there in the future; but more than two tons of hippo meat
  was not bad pay for their hospitality.</p>

  <p>We wished we had as good price to offer at the villages on our way, for
  sleep under cover we must, if we hoped to escape the ravages of fever; and
  the primitive savage, at least in those parts, had the principle down fine of
  nothing whatever for nothing. Yet as it turned out, the very man whose
  company we looked on as a nuisance proved to be a key to all gates. We
  marched along the track the Baganda had taken. The chiefs of all villages
  knew him again; and the men who dared take such a prophet of evil prisoner
  were looked upon as high government officials at least.</p>

  <p>We accepted that description of ourselves, letting it go by silent assent,
  and explained our lack of tents and almost every other thing the white man
  generally travels with as due to haste. Heaven only knew what lies Kazimoto
  told those credulous folk, to the perfectly worthy end of making our lot
  bearable, but we were fed after a fashion, and lodged after a worse one all
  along our road. And who should send in reports about us&mdash;and to whom?
  Obviously white men with a prisoner, marching in such a hurry toward the
  north, were government officials. Who should report officials to their
  government? As for the tale about our having left our loads behind&mdash; are
  not all white people crazy? Who shall explain their craziness?</p>

  <p>From being a nuisance the Baganda became a joke. When it dawned on his fat
  intellect that we were hurrying toward Schillingschen with only one rifle
  among us and no baggage at all, he jumped at once to the conclusion we must
  be Schillingschen's friends; and his fear that we intended to hand him over
  to that ruthless brute for summary punishment was more melting to his
  backbone than the dread of our imaginary whip, that had caused him to give
  Schillingschen away.</p>

  <p>He tried to bite through the thongs that held him, but Will twisted for
  him handcuffs out of thick iron wire that we begged from a chief, who had
  intended to make ornaments with it for his own legs. We did not dare let the
  man escape, nor care to prevent our men from using force when he threw
  himself on the ground and wept like a spoiled child.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you" he said at last, deciding he might as well be hanged for
  mutton as for lamb, "what bwana Schillingschen is searching for! I will tell
  you who knows where to find it! I will tell you where to find the man who
  knows! Only let me run away then to my own home in Uganda, and I will never
  again leave it! I am afraid! I am afraid!"</p>

  <p>But that was only one more reason for keeping him with us, and no ground
  at all for delay. He would not tell unless we loosed his hands first, so we
  pressed on, camping late and starting early, until about noon of the fourth
  day we caught sight of Schillingschen's tents in the distance, and gathered
  our party at once into a little rocky hollow to discuss the situation.</p>

  <p>Behind us the land sloped gradually for thirty or forty miles toward a
  sharp escarpment that overlooked the level land beside the lake. At times
  between the hills and trees we could glimpse Nyanza itself, looking like the
  vast rim of forever, mysterious and calm. In front of us the rolling hills,
  broken out here and there into rocky knolls, piled up on one another toward
  the hump of Elgon, on which the blue sky rested. In every direction were
  villages of folk who knew so little of white men that they paid no taxes yet
  and did no work&mdash;marrying and giving in marriage&mdash;fighting and
  running away&mdash;eating and drinking and watching their women cultivate the
  corn and beans and sweet potatoes&mdash;without as much as foreboding of the
  taxes, work for wages, missionaries, law and commerce soon to come.</p>

  <p>Schillingschen was more than taking his time, he was dawdling, keeping his
  donkeys fat, and letting his men wander at pleasure to right and left
  gathering reports for him of unusual folk or things. We came very close to
  being seen by one of them, who emerged from a village near us with a pair of
  chickens he had foraged, followed by the owner of the luckless birds in a
  great hurry and fury to get paid for them.</p>

  <p>Schillingschen's tent could fairly easily be stalked from the far side in
  broad daylight, and I was for making the attempt. There was the risk that one
  of our porters might grow restless and break bounds if we waited, or that the
  Baganda might take to yelling. We gagged him as soon as I talked of the
  danger of that.</p>

  <p>Coutlass and Brown, however, were the only two who would agree with me.
  Like me, they were weary to death of mtama porridge, with or without milk,
  and the sight of Schillingschen's distant campfire with a great pot resting
  on stones in the midst of it whetted appetite for white man's food. They and
  I were for supping as soon as possible from the German's provender, and
  sleeping under his canvas roof.</p>

  <p>But Fred and Will insisted on caution, claiming reasonably that surprise
  would be infinitely easier after dark. It was unlikely that Schillingschen
  would post any sentries, and not much matter if he did. His knowledge of
  natives and natural air of authority made him quite safe among any but the
  wildest, and these were a comparatively peaceful folk. In all probability he
  would sit and read by candle light, with his boys all snoring a hundred yards
  away. There was no making Fred and Will see the virtue of my contention that
  a sudden attack while his boys were scattered all about among the villages
  would be just as likely to succeed; so we settled down to wait where we were
  with what patience we could summon.</p>

  <p>It was a miserable, hungry business, under a blazing hot sky, packed
  tightly together among men who objected to our smell as strongly as we to
  theirs. It is the fixed opinion of all black people that the white man smells
  like "bad water"; and no word seems discoverable that will quite return the
  compliment. That afternoon was reminiscent of the long days on the dhow, when
  nobody could move without disturbing everybody else, and we all breathed the
  same hot mixed stench over and over.</p>

  <p>We posted two sentries to lie with their eyes on the level of the rim and
  guard against surprise. But there was so little to watch, except kites
  wheeling overhead everlastingly, that they went to sleep; and we were so
  bored, and so sure of our hiding-place and Schillingschen's unsuspicion that
  we did not notice them. I myself fell asleep toward five o'clock, and when I
  awoke the sun was so low in the west that our hollow lay in deep gloom.</p>

  <p>Fred was lying on his elbow, sucking an unfilled, unlighted pipe. Will lay
  on his side, too, with back toward both of us, ruminating. Coutlass and Brown
  were both asleep, but Coutlass awoke as I rolled over and struck him with my
  heel. Nearly all the porters were snoring.</p>

  <p>It was a sharp exclamation from the Greek that caused me to sit up and
  face due westward. The others lay as they were. It was the gloom in our
  hollow&mdash;the velvety shadows in which we lay with granite boulders
  scattered between us, and no alertness on our part that saved that day,
  although Coutlass acted instantly and creditably, once awake.</p>

  <p>Schillingschen stood there looking down on us, with his feet planted
  squarely on the rim of the hollow, and Mauser rifle under one arm. His great
  splay beard flowed sidewise in the evening wind. One hand he held over his
  eyes, trying to make out details in the dark, as stupid as we were. He stood
  with his back to the setting sun, exposing himself without any thought of the
  risk he ran, his huge, filled-out head refusing stubbornly to take in the
  truth of what had happened. Once convinced, the Prussian mind is not readily
  unconvinced. He had assured himself long ago that our party was at the bottom
  of Victoria Nyanza.</p>

  <p>The second he did make out details he was swift to act, but that was
  already too late, although he did not know it at the moment. He threw up his
  rifle and laughed&mdash;a great deep guffaw from the stomach, that awoke
  every one.</p>

  <p>"So, so!" he gloated. "So Mr. Oakes and his fellow escaped convicts are
  alive after all! Ha-ha-ho-ho! So you followed me all this way, only to forget
  that kites are curious! A fine comfortless journey you must have had, too!
  There were twenty kites wheeling over you. I counted, and wondered. Curiosity
  drove me to come and see. The first man who moves a finger, Mr. Oakes, will
  die that instant! Let your rifle lie where it is!"</p>

  <p>It would be no use pretending the man had not courage, at all events of
  the sort that glories in the upper hand of a fight. He chuckled, and reveled
  in our predicament, taking in, now that his eyes had grown accustomed to the
  darkness of our hollow, the utter lack of comforts or provisions, and
  enjoying our disappointment. He certainly knew himself master of the
  situation.</p>

  <p>"I suspect you have a man of mine down there with you!" he announced
  presently. "Is not that my Baganda? Is he gagged? Is he bound? Loose him, Mr.
  Oakes, at once!" I say at once! Otherwise you die now!"</p>

  <p>He pointed his rifle directly at Fred, and the next second fired it, but
  not intentionally. Coutlass sprang from behind him, having crawled out
  through a shadow, and hit him so hard with a stone on the back of the skull
  that he loosed off the rifle and pitched head-foremost down among us. The
  Greek promptly jumped on top of him with a yell like a maniac's, failing to
  land with both heels on his backbone by nothing but luck. As it was, he lost
  balance and sat down so hard on Schillingschen's head that there was no need
  of the energy with which we all followed suit, piling all over him to pin him
  down like hounds that have rolled their quarry over.</p>

  <p>The German was stunned&mdash;knocked into utter oblivion&mdash; breathing
  like a sleeping drunkard, and bleeding freely from the nose. Coutlass jumped
  off him and began to execute a war dance up and down, yelling like a madman
  until Fred threatened him with the rifle and Will gagged him from behind.</p>

  <p>"Do you want his armed men down on us, you ass?"</p>

  <p>"Gassharamminy!" he laughed. "I forgot about them! Let us go and eat their
  supper!" He spoke as a man who had full right now to be considered a member
  in good standing. We all noticed it, and exchanged glances; but that was no
  time for argument about men's rights.</p>

  <p>Brown was already over the rim of the hollow and making in the direction
  of the tents. We called him back and compelled him to stay on guard over the
  prisoners, to his awful disgust, for he suspected there was whisky among
  Schillingschen's "chop-boxes." But so did we! We left all our boys with him
  except Kazimoto, threatening them with hitherto unheard of penalties if they
  dared as much as show a lock of hair above the rim of the hollow while we
  were gone.</p>

  <p>Then the rest of us, with Fred leading and Kazimoto last of all, crept out
  and sought the lowest level along which to reach the camp. Will had taken
  Schillingschen's rifle and went next after Fred. Coutlass followed so close
  on my heels that more than once he trod on them, and once so nearly tripped
  me that Fred called a halt behind some bushes and cursed me for
  clumsiness.</p>

  <p>But it turned out to be easy hunting. The ten boys had tied the donkeys up
  to a rope in line and sat crooning while their supper cooked at a long bright
  fire. We came up to Schillingschen's tent from behind, crept around the side
  of it, and in a moment had three more good weapons, I taking the big-bore
  elephant gun that had dealt with us so savagely on the lake, Coutlass seizing
  another Mauser, and Kazimoto adopting the shot-gun.</p>

  <p>The rest was child's play. We marched out of the tent all abreast and
  called on the ten boys to surrender, making them put up their hands until
  Coutlass had found their five rifles and ammunition. They were too astonished
  even to ask questions. Accustomed to Schillingschen's despotic orders, they
  obeyed ours silently, showing no symptoms of trying to bolt, having nowhere
  to bolt to; but we took precautions.</p>

  <p>Kazimoto ran back to bring our party, and we took a coil of iron wire from
  Schillingschen's trade goods and fastened every prisoner's hands firmly
  behind his back, including the unconscious German's. That done, we ate the
  meat, beans and vegetable supper that the ten had cooked.</p>

  <p>Brown and Coutlass found Schillingschen's whisky after that, and under its
  influence again swore ceaseless friendship beneath the non-committal stars.
  While they feasted we took Coutlass' rifle away as a plain precaution.</p>

  &mdash;<i>Parcere Subjectis?</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">FOR a while we looked like having trouble with Coutlass. We
  gave Brown a rifle, and distributed the other Mausers among Kazimoto and our
  best boys, but we did not dare trust the Greek with a weapon he might use
  against us, and be resented that bitterly. He had an answer to Fred's
  subterfuge that as a white man he would need a license before daring to carry
  firearms. "I dare do anything! I care nothing for law!" he argued, and Fred
  nodded.</p>

  <p>That night we reveled in luxury, for after the life we had led recently it
  took time to reaccustom any of us to the common comforts. Schillingschen
  traveled with every provision for his carcass and his belly; and we plundered
  him.</p>

  <p>We put the prisoners and our own porters in a hut in the nearest native
  village (less than half a mile away) under the watchful eye of Kazimoto and
  the shot-gun, dividing Schillingschen's two large tents between ourselves.
  The others offered me the camp-bed as a recent invalid, but I refused, and
  Will won it by matching coins. We divided the blankets in the same way, and
  all the spare underwear. Brown and Coutlass had to be satisfied with cotton
  blankets from a bale of trade goods; but when they had rifled enough to build
  up good thick mattresses as well as coverings, there were still two apiece
  for our boys and all the porters.</p>

  <p>The chop-boxes were a revelation. The man had with him food enough for at
  least a year's traveling, including all the canned delicacies that hungry men
  dream about in the wilderness. Before we slept we ate so enormously of so
  very many things that it was a wonder that we were able to sleep at all.</p>

  <p>We all hoped Schillingschen would die, for it was a hard problem what to
  do with him. He had no papers in his possession, beyond a diary written in
  German <i>Schrift</i>* that even Will could not make head or tail of, for all
  his knowledge of the language; and a very vague map bearing the imprint of
  the British government, filled in by himself with the names of the villages
  he had passed on his way. There was no proof that we could find that would
  have condemned him of nefarious practices in a British court of law.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Schrift</i> (German)&mdash;script,
  handwriting.]</p>

  <p>"And believe me," argued Will, sprawling on the plundered bed, blowing the
  smoke of a Melachrino* through his nose, "your local British judges would
  take the word of Professor Schillingschen against all of ours, backed up by
  simply overwhelming native evidence! They're so in awe of Schillingschen's
  professorial degree, and of his passports, and his letters of introduction
  from this and that mogul that they wouldn't believe him guilty of arson if
  they caught him in the act!"</p>

  ]</p>

  <p>"Something's got to be done with him pretty soon, though," answered Fred
  from the floor, lying at ease on a pillow and a folded Jaeger blanket,
  smoking a fat cigar.</p>

  <p>Coutlass and Brown were singing songs outside the tent and I sat in a
  genuine armchair with my feet on a box full of canned plum pudding. (Nobody
  knows, who has not hungered on the high or low veldt&mdash;who has not eaten
  meat without vegetables for days on end, and then porridge without salt or
  sugar&mdash;how good that common, export, canned plum pudding is! To sit with
  my feet on the case that contained it was the arrogance of affluence!)</p>

  <p>"We have his stores and his papers," said I. "We have his Baganda; and as
  time goes on, and his other spies begin to come in, we shall have them, too,
  if we're half careful. Why don't we let him go, to tell his own tale wherever
  he likes?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe he'll die yet!" said the optimist on the camp-bed, blowing more
  cigarette smoke.</p>

  <p>"Suppose he doesn't. We've done our best to keep him alive. He's quit
  bleeding. Suppose we let him go, and he lays a charge against us. Suppose
  they send after us and bring us in. We've his diary and his men&mdash;
  evidence enough," said I.</p>

  <p>"You bally ass!" Fred murmured.</p>

  <p>"Cuckoo!" laughed Will.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe he'd dare approach a British official with his story,"
  said I.</p>

  <p>"Incredible imbecile!" Fred answered. "He has the gall of a brass
  monkey."</p>

  <p>"And magnetism&mdash;loads of it," Will added. "He'd make the Pope play
  three-card monte."</p>

  <p>"To say nothing," continued Fred, "of the necessity of not letting the
  government know we're here! Rather than turn him loose, I'd march him into
  Kisumu and hand him over. But, as Will says wisely, our proconsuls would
  believe him, and put us under bonds for outraging a distinguished
  foreigner."</p>

  <p>"Well, then," said I, "what the devil shall we do with him? Offer
  something constructive, you two solons!"</p>

  <p>"Have the four men we borrowed from the island bolted home yet?" wondered
  Will.</p>

  <p>"They hadn't this evening," I answered. "I don't believe they'll venture
  home until we stop feeding them. They were hungry on their island. Our
  shortest commons then seemed affluence. Now they're in heaven!"</p>

  <p>"Their canoes must be where they left them in the papyrus."</p>

  <p>"Sure. Who'd steal a canoe?"</p>

  <p>"Whoever could find them," Fred answered. "But they're skillfully hidden.
  Why don't we put Schillingschen and his ten pet blacks into those canoes,
  with a little food and no rifles&mdash;and show them the way to German
  East?"</p>

  <p>"Because," said I, "they wouldn't go. They'd turn around and paddle for
  Kisumu, to file complaint against us."</p>

  <p>"Don't you suppose," suggested Will, "that Schillingschen's own men 'ud
  insist on going home? Out on the water, ten to one, without guns or too much
  food, they wouldn't have the same fear of him they had formerly."</p>

  <p>"That chance is too broad and long and deep," said Fred. "Altogether too
  bulky to be taken. Let's sleep on it. This cigar's done, and I'm drowsy. Are
  you quite sure Schillingschen's hands are fast behind him? Then good night,
  all!"</p>

  <p>The problem looked no easier next morning, with Schillingschen recovered
  sufficiently to be hungry and sit up. There was a look in his eye of
  smoldering courage and assurance that did not bode well for us, and when we
  untwisted the iron wire from his wrists to let him wash himself and eat he
  looked about him with a sort of quick-fire cunning that belied his story of
  headache.</p>

  <p>He was much too astute a customer to be judged superficially. I whispered
  to Fred not to shackle him again too soon, and sat near and watched him,
  close enough for real safety, yet not so close that he might not venture to
  try tricks. He said nothing whatever, but I noticed that his eye, after
  roving around the tent, kept returning again and again to a chop-box that
  stood near the foot of the bed.</p>

  <p>Now I had unpacked that chop-box and repacked it the previous night. I
  knew everything it contained&mdash;exactly how many cans of plum pudding. It
  was the box I had rested my feet on. I felt perfectly sure he knew as well as
  I what the box contained, and to suppose he would sit there planning to
  recover canned food, however dainty, was ridiculous.</p>

  <p>Wherefore it was a safe conclusion he was trying to deceive me as to his
  real intention. I put my foot on the box again, and he frowned, as much as to
  say I had forestalled his only hope. Pretending to watch the box and him, I
  examined every detail of the tent, particularly that side of it opposite the
  box, away from where it seemed he wanted me to look.</p>

  <p>The human eye is a highly imperfect piece of mechanism and the human brain
  is mostly grayish slush. It was minutes before I detected the edge of his
  diary, sticking out from the pocket of Fred's shooting coat that itself
  protruded from under the folded blanket on which Fred had slept. It was
  nearer to Schillingschen than to me. After watching him for about fifteen
  minutes, during which he made a great fuss about his headache, I was quite
  sure it was the diary that interested him.</p>

  <p>I stooped and extracted it from the coat pocket. The grimace he made was
  certainly not due to headache.</p>

  <p>"Fred!" I called out, and he and Will came striding in together.</p>

  <p>"That diary's the key," I said. "It's important. It holds his
  secrets!"</p>

  <p>Will was swift to put that to the test.</p>

  <p>"What will you offer?" he asked Schillingschen. "We want you to go back
  direct to German East. Will you go, if we give you back your diary?"</p>

  <p>Schillingschen blundered into the trap like a buffalo in strange
  surroundings.</p>

  <p><i>"Jawohl!"</i> he answered. "Give me that, and you shall never see me
  again!"</p>

  <p>At that Fred threw himself full length on his blanket and took one of
  Schillingschen's cigars.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he said, "you would give anything for leave to take those
  words back! You needn't try to hide the wince&mdash;we fully appreciate the
  situation! What do you say, you fellows? How about last night's idea? Who
  mooted it? Shall we send him back by canoe to German East, with a guarantee
  that if he doesn't go we'll hand over diary and him to our government?"</p>

  <p>"Better send the book to the commissioner at Nairobi, or Mombasa, or
  wherever he is," suggested Will. "Then if the 'prof' here doesn't get a swift
  move on he's liable to be overtaken by the cops, I should say."</p>

  <p>"Let's make no promises," said I. "I vote we simply give him time to get
  away."</p>

  <p>At that the German saw the weak side of our case in a flash.</p>

  <p>"If you dared give that diary to your government," be growled, "you would
  do so without bargaining with me! Why do you propose to let me go? Out of
  love for me? No! But because you dare not appeal to your government! Give me
  that diary, and I will go at once to German East, not otherwise! It is only a
  diary," he added. "Nothing important&mdash;merely my private jottings and
  memoranda."</p>

  <p>Fred turned toward me so that Schillingschen could not see his face.</p>

  <p>"Are you willing to start for Kisumu at once with that book?" he asked,
  and I nodded. He winked at me so violently that I could not trust myself to
  answer aloud and keep a straight face.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said. "Suppose you start with it to-morrow morning. At the
  end of a week well turn the professor home to follow his own nose!"</p>

  <p>Schillingschen shrugged his shoulders and refused to be drawn into further
  argument. We gave him a good meal from his own provisions, and then once more
  made his hands fast with wire behind him and left him to sleep off his rage
  if he cared to in a corner of the tent.</p>

  <p>Later that morning we sent for the Baganda&mdash;gave him a view of
  Schillingschen trussed and helpless&mdash;and questioned him about the man he
  boasted he knew, who could tell us what Schillingschen was after. He was so
  full of fear by that time that he held back nothing.</p>

  <p>He assured us the German was after buried ivory. There was a man, who had
  promised to meet Schillingschen, who knew where to find the ivory and would
  lead the way to it. He did not know names or places&mdash;knew only that the
  man would be found waiting at a certain place, and was not white.</p>

  <p>"How did you get that information?" Fred demanded.</p>

  <p>"By listening."</p>

  <p>"When? Where?"</p>

  <p>"At night, months ago, in Nairobi, outside the professor's tent. I lay
  under the fly among the loads and listened. The man came in the dark, and
  went in the dark. I did not see him. I did not hear him called by name. He
  must have been an old man. Speaking Kiswahili, he admitted he knew where the
  ivory is. He said he saw it buried, and that he alone survives of all men who
  buried it. He promised to lead the professor to the place on condition that
  the Germans shall release his brother, and his brother's wife, and two sons
  whom they keep in prison on a life-sentence. The professor agreed, but said,
  'Wait! There are first those people who also think they know the secret.
  Perhaps they do! Wait until after I have dealt with them. Then you shall take
  me to the place! After that your criminal relations shall be pardoned! Here
  is money. Go and wait for me at the place we spoke of when we talked
  before.'"</p>

  <p>We each cross-examined him in turn, but could not make him change his
  story in any essential. He merely exaggerated the parts that he guessed might
  please us, and begged to be allowed to run before Schillingschen could break
  loose and get after him.</p>

  <p>By noontime, when we gave him his second meal, Schillingschen had made up
  his own mind that his case was desperate and called for heroic remedy.</p>

  <p>"All right," he growled. "I need that diary. Hand it to me and I'll tell
  you how to find what you're after!"</p>

  <p>"You mean about the man who's to meet you?" suggested Fred blandly.</p>

  <p>Schillingschen started as if shot.</p>

  <p>"One of your men is an eavesdropper," Fred assured him with a cheerful
  nod. "That plug has been pulled already, Professor!"</p>

  <p>"Let's play the cards face up!" Will interrupted impatiently. "Listen,
  Schillingschen. You're an all-in scoundrel. You're a spy. You're a bloody
  murderer of women and defenseless natives. If we could prove that we wouldn't
  argue with you. We know you burned that dhow with the women in it, but we've
  got no evidence, that's all. We know the German government wants that ivory,
  and we know why. We also want it. Our only reason for secrecy is that we hope
  for better terms from the British government. We've nothing to fear, except
  possible financial loss. If you prefer to come with us to Kisumu and have the
  whole matter out in court, all you need do is just say so. On the other hand,
  if you want to get out of this country before your diary can reach the hands
  of the British High Commissioner&mdash;you'd just better slide, that's
  all!"</p>

  <p>"You've only until dawn to think it over," remarked Fred. "You poor boob!"
  continued Will. "You imagine we're criminals because you're one yourself! The
  difference between your offer and ours is that you're bluffing and we know
  it, whereas we're not bluffing by as much as a hair, and the quicker you see
  that the better for you!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, rats! Let's take him in with us to Kisumu!" said I, and at that
  Professor Schillingschen capitulated.</p>

  <p>"Very well" he said. "<i>Kurz und gut</i>. I will leave the country.
  Permit me to take only food enough, and my porters, and one gun!"</p>

  <p>"No guns!" said Fred promptly.</p>

  <p>Schillingschen sighed resignedly, and we went out of the tent to talk over
  ways and means. In spite of our recent experience of Germany's colonial
  government we were still so ignorant of the workings of the <i>mens
  germanica</i>* that we took his surrender at face value.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>mens germanica</i> (Latin)&mdash;the German mind.
  <i><a href=
  "http://catholic.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/words.exe?mens+germanica">William
  Whitaker's Words</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>The problem of getting him down to the lake shore safely was none too
  simple. I was soft hearted and headed enough to propose that we should loose
  his hands, now that he had surrendered, and permit him reasonable liberty.
  Will&mdash;least inclined of all of us to cruelty&mdash;was disposed to agree
  with me. We might have overborne Fred's objections if Coutlass and Brown,
  returning from walking off their overnight debauch together, had not shouted
  and beckoned us in a mysterious sort of way, as if some new discovery puzzled
  them.</p>

  <p>We walked about a hundred and fifty yards to where they stood by a row of
  low ant-hills. Neither of them was in a sociable frame of mind. It was
  obvious from the moment we could see their faces clearly that they had not
  called us to enjoy a joke. They stood like two dumb bird-dogs, pointing, and
  we had to come about abreast of them before we knew why we were summoned.</p>

  <p>There lay five clean-picked skeletons, one on each ant-hill. One was a big
  bird's; one looked like a dog's; the third was a snake's; the fourth a young
  antelope's; and the fifth was certainly that of a yellow village cur, for
  some of the hairs from the tip of its tail were remaining, not yet borne off
  by the ants.</p>

  <p>The skeletons lay as if the creatures had died writhing. There were pegs
  driven into the earth that had evidently held them in position by the sinews.
  Most peculiar circumstance of all, there was a camp-chair standing very near
  by, with its feet deep in the red earth, as if a very heavy man had sat in
  it.</p>

  <p>I went back to the camp and told Kazimoto to bring one of the professor's
  men. Kazimoto had to do the talking, for we did not know the man's language,
  nor he ours.</p>

  <p>Yes, the professor always did that to animals. He liked to sit and watch
  them and keep the kites away. He said it was white man's knowledge
  (science?). Yes, the animals were pegged out alive on the ant-hills, and the
  professor would sit with his watch in his hand, counting the minutes until
  they ceased from writhing. It was part of the duty of the ten to catch
  animals and bring them alive to him in camp for that purpose. No, they did
  not know why he did it, except that it was white man's knowledge. No, natives
  did not do that way, except now and then to their enemies. The professor
  always made threats he would do so to them if they ran away from him, or
  disobeyed, or misbehaved. Certainly they believed him! Why should they not
  believe him? Did not Germans always keep their word when they talked of
  punishment?</p>

  <p>We decided after that to let Schillingschen lie bound, whether or not the
  iron wire cut his wrists. We did not trouble to go back to inquire whether he
  needed drink, but let him wait for that until supper-time. The remainder of
  that afternoon we spent discussing who should have the disagreeable and not
  too easy task of taking the professor to the lake and sending him on his way.
  We sat with our backs against a rock, with the firearms beside us and a good
  view of all the countryside, very much puzzled as to whether to leave
  Coutlass behind in camp (with Brown and the whisky) or send him (with or
  without Brown) and one or two of us on the errand. He was a dangerous ally in
  either case.</p>

  <p>Evening fell, and the good smell of supper came along the wind to find us
  still undecided. We returned to the tent thinking that perhaps something
  Schillingschen himself might say would help us to decide one way or the
  other.</p>

  <p>"Better see if the brute wants a drink," said Fred, and I went in ahead to
  offer him water.</p>

  <p>He was gone! Clean gone, without a trace, or a hint as to how he managed
  it! I called the others, and we hunted. The sides of the tent were pegged
  down tight all around. The front, it is true, was wide open, but we had sat
  in full view of it and not so much as a rat could have crept out without our
  seeing. There were no signs of burrowing. He was not under the bed, or behind
  the boxes, or between the sides of the tent and the fly. The only cover for
  more than a hundred yards was the shallow depression along which we had come
  to the capture of the camp, and that was the way he must have taken. But
  that, too, had been practically in full view of us all the time.</p>

  <p>We counted heads and called the roll. Coutlass was close by. It did not
  look as if he had played traitor this time. Brown was sleeping off his
  headache in the shade. Kazimoto and all the boys were accounted for. The
  prisoners were safe. No donkeys were missing&mdash;no firearms&mdash;and no
  loads. The earth had simply opened up and swallowed Schillingschen, and that
  was all about it!</p>

  <p>He had not made off with his pocket diary. Fred had that. There and then
  we packed it in an empty biscuit tin and buried it under a rock, Will and I
  keeping watch while Fred did the digging and covering up. It was too likely
  that Schillingschen would come back in the night and try to steal it for any
  of us to care about keeping it on his person.</p>

  <p>It was too late to look far and wide for him that evening. A hunter such
  as he could have lain unseen in the dark with us almost stepping on him. Gone
  was all appetite for supper! We nibbled, and swore, and smoked&mdash;locked
  up the whisky&mdash;defied either Brown or Coutlass to try to break the boxes
  open&mdash;and arranged to take turns on sentry-go all that night, Will,
  Fred, and I&mdash;declining very pointedly offers by the other two to have
  their part in keeping watch. In spite of lack of evidence we suspected
  Coutlass; and we knew no particular reason for having confidence in
  Brown.</p>

  <p class="first">THE man who tries to explain away coincidences to men who
  were the victims of them is likely to need more sympathy than he will get.
  The dictionary defines them clumsily as instances of coinciding, apparently
  accidental, but which suggest a casual connection.</p>

  <p>Lions paid us a visit that first night after Schillingschen's escape
  &mdash;the first lions we had seen or heard since landing on the north shore
  of the lake. We prayed they might get Schillingschen, yet they and he
  persisted until morning&mdash;they roaring and circling never near enough for
  the man on guard to get a shot&mdash;he also circling the camp, calling to
  his ten men, whom we had transferred from the native village to the second
  tent under guard of Kazimoto and our own men as a precaution.</p>

  <p>Our boys slept as if drugged, but not his. He called to them in a language
  that even Kazimoto did not understand, and they kept answering at intervals.
  Once, when I was listening to locate Schillingschen if I could, the lions
  came sniffing and snuffing to the back side of the tent. I tried to stalk
  them&mdash;a rash, reprehensible, tenderfoot trick. Luck was with me; they
  slunk away in the shadows, and I lived to summon Fred and Will. We tried to
  save the donkeys, but the lions took three of them at their leisure, and
  scared the rest so that they broke out of the thorn-bush boma we had made the
  boys build (as a precaution against leopards, not lions). Next morning out of
  forty we recovered twenty-five, and wondered how many of them Schillingschen
  got.</p>

  <p>Remembering how we ourselves had managed, without ammunition or supplies,
  we did not fool ourselves with the belief that Schillingschen, with his
  brutal personal magnetism and profound knowledge of natives, would not do
  better. The probability was he would stir up the countryside against us.</p>

  <p>He had been doing missionary work; it might be the natives of that part
  were already sufficiently schooled to do murder at his bidding.</p>

  <p>We decided to leave at once for a district where he had not yet done any
  of his infernal preaching.</p>

  <p>"You should set a trap and shoot the swine!" Coutlass insisted. Will was
  inclined to agree with him, but Fred and I demurred. The British writ had
  never really run as far as the slopes of Elgon, and we could see them ahead
  of us not very many marches away. If Schillingschen intended to dog us and
  watch chances we preferred to have him do that in a remote wilderness, where
  our prospect of influencing natives would likely be as good as his, that was
  all.</p>

  <p>Part of our strategy was to make an early start and march swiftly, taking
  advantage of his physical weariness after a night in the open on the prowl;
  but after a few days in camp it is the most difficult thing imaginable to get
  a crowd of porters started on the march. It was more particularly difficult
  on that occasion because none of our men were familiar with Schillingschen's
  loads, and the captured ten, even when we loosed their hands and treated them
  friendly, showed no disposition to be useful. We gave them a load apiece to
  carry, but to every one we had to assign two of our own as guards, so that,
  what with having lost the fifteen donkeys, we had not a man to spare.</p>

  <p>It was after midday when we got off at last. We had not left the camp more
  than half a mile behind when I looked back and saw Schillingschen where his
  great tent had stood, cavorting on hands and feet like an enormous dog-
  baboon, searching every inch of the ground for anything we might have left.
  We three stood and watched him for half an hour, sweating with fear lest he
  chance on the place where his diary lay buried in the tin box. We began to
  wish we had brought it with us. I said we had done foolishly to leave it,
  although I had approved of Fred's burying it at the time.</p>

  <p>"Suppose," I argued, "he sets the natives of that village to searching!
  What's to prevent him? You know the kind of job they'd make of it&mdash;
  blade by blade of grass&mdash;pebble by pebble. Where they found a trace of
  loosened dirt they'd dig."</p>

  <p>"Did you bury something, then?" inquired a voice we knew too well. "By the
  ace of stinks, those natives can smell out anything a white man ever
  touched!"</p>

  <p>We turned and faced Coutlass, whom we had imagined on ahead with the
  safari. If he noticed our sour looks, he saw fit to ignore them; but he took
  an upperhanded, new, insolent way with us, no doubt due to our refusal to
  shoot Schillingschen. He ascribed that to a yellow streak.</p>

  <p>"I was right. Gassharamminy! I could have sworn I saw two of you on watch
  while the third man dug among the stones! What did you bury? I came back to
  talk about Brown. The poor drunkard wants to head more to the east. I say
  straight on. What do you say?"</p>

  <p>We told him to go forward. Then we looked in one another's eyes, and said
  nothing. Whether or not the original decision had been wise, there was no
  question now what was the proper course.</p>

  <p>Instead of tiring out Schillingschen we made an early camp by a
  watercourse, and built a very big protection for the donkeys against lions
  &mdash;a high thorn enclosure, and an outer one not so high, with a space
  between them wide enough for the two tents and half a dozen big fires. Before
  dark we had enough fuel stacked up to keep the fires blazing well all night
  long.</p>

  <p>Neither Coutlass nor Brown had had a drink of whisky that day, so it was
  all the more remarkable that Coutlass lay down early in a corner of the tent
  and fell into a sound sleep almost at once. We were thoroughly glad of it.
  Our plan was for two of us to creep out of camp when it was dark enough, and
  recover the contents of that tin box before Schillingschen or the blacks
  could forestall us.</p>

  <p>The lions began roaring again at about sundown, but they love donkey-meat
  more than almost any except giraffe, and it was not likely they would trouble
  us. We were so sure the task was not particularly risky that Fred, who would
  have insisted on the place of greater danger for himself, consented willingly
  enough to stay in camp while Will and I went back. Our original intention was
  to take Schillingschen's patent, wind-proof, non-upsettable camp lantern to
  find the way with and keep wild beasts at bay; but just as Will went toward
  the tent to fetch it (Fred's back was turned, over on the far side where he
  was seeing to the camp-fires) we both at once caught sight of Coutlass
  creeping on hands and knees along a shadow. We had closed the gap in the
  outer wall of thorn, but he dragged aside enough to make an opening and
  slipped through, thinking himself unobserved.</p>

  <p>To have followed him with a lantern would have been worse than my crime of
  stalking lions in the dark. Will ran to tell Fred what had happened while I
  followed the Greek through the gap, and presently Will and I were both hot on
  his trail, as close to him as we could keep without letting him hear us.</p>

  <p>"Fred says," Will whispered, "if we catch him talking with Schillingschen,
  shoot 'em both! Fred won't let him into camp again unless we bring back proof
  he's not a traitor!"</p>

  <p>We were pursuing a practiced hunter, who at first kept stopping to make
  sure he was not followed. He took a line across that wild country in the dark
  with such assurance, and so swiftly that it was unbelievably hard to follow
  him quietly. It was not long before we lost sound of him. Then we ran more
  freely, trusting to luck as much as anything to keep him thinking he had the
  darkness to himself.</p>

  <p>Our short day's journey seemed to have trebled itself! We were leg-weary
  and tired-eyed when at last we reached, and nearly fell into a hollow we
  recognized. Will went down and struck a match to get a look at his watch.</p>

  <p>"There ought to be a moon in about ten minutes," he whispered. "We're
  within sight of the place. Suppose we climb a tree and scout about a
  bit."</p>

  <p>It was not a very big tree that we selected, but it was the biggest; it
  had low branches, and the merit of being easy to climb.</p>

  <p>When the pale latter half of the moon announced itself we could dimly make
  out from the upper branches all of the flat ground where the camp had been.
  There was no sign of Coutlass. None of Schillingschen. A lioness and two
  enormous lions stood facing one another in a triangle, almost exactly on the
  spot where the larger tent had stood, not fifty yards from us.</p>

  <p>"Gee!" whispered Will excitedly. "We nearly stumbled on 'em!"</p>

  <p>"Shoot!" I whispered. My own position on the branch was so insecure that I
  could not have brought my rifle into use without making a prodigious noise.
  Will shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I can see Coutlass now! Look at that rock&mdash;he's hiding behind it
  &mdash;see, he's climbing! And look, there's Schillingschen!"</p>

  <p>Neither man was aware of the other's presence, or of ours. They were out
  of sight of each other, Coutlass on the very rocks against which we had
  leaned to watch the tent the afternoon before, and neither man really out of
  reach of anything with claws that cared to go after them in earnest.</p>

  <p>The arrival of the dim moon seemed to give the lions their cue for action.
  The lioness turned half away, as if weary of waiting, and then lay down
  full-length to watch as one lion sprang at the other with a roar like the
  wrath of warring worlds. They met in mid-air, claw to claw, and went down
  together&mdash;a roaring, snarling, eight-legged, two-tailed catastrophe
  &mdash;never apart&mdash;not still an instant&mdash;tearing, beating
  &mdash;rolling over and over&mdash;emitting bellows of mingled rage and agony
  whenever the teeth of one or other brute went home.</p>

  <p>Even as shadows fighting in the shadows they were terrible to watch. They
  shook the very earth and air, as if they owned all the primeval bestial force
  of all the animals. And the she-lion lay watching them, her eyes like burning
  yellow coals, not moving a muscle that we could see.</p>

  <p>Iron could not have withstood the blows; the thunder of them reached us in
  the tree! Steel ropes could not have endured the strain as claws went home,
  and the brutes wrenched, ripped, and yelled in titanic agony. Their fury
  increased. Wounds did not seem to enfeeble them. Nothing checked the speed of
  the fighting an instant, until suddenly the lioness stood erect, gave a long
  loud call like a cat's, and turned and vanished.</p>

  <p>She had seen. She knew. Like a spring loosed from its containing box one
  of the lions freed himself in mid-air and hurtled clear, landing on all-fours
  and hurrying away after the lioness with a bad limp. The other lion fell on
  his side and lay groaning, then roared half-heartedly and dragged himself
  away.</p>

  <p>The second lion had hardly gone when Coutlass descended gingerly from the
  rock, peering about him, and listening. He evidently had no suspicion of our
  presence, for he never once looked in our direction. It was Schillingschen,
  not lions, he feared; and Schillingschen, clambering over the top of another
  rock, watched him as a night-beast eyes its prey. Another one-act drama was
  staged, and it was not time for us to come down from the tree yet.</p>

  <p>Satisfied he was not followed and that Schillingschen was elsewhere,
  Coutlass crept from rock to rock toward the little cluster of small ones
  where, by his own confession, he had seen Fred bury the box. Schillingschen
  stalked him through the shadows as actively as a great ape, making no sound,
  as clearly visible to us as he was invisible to Coutlass.</p>

  <p>There was not a trace of mist&mdash;nothing to obscure the dim pale light,
  and as the moon swung higher into space we could see both men's every
  movement, like the play of marionettes.</p>

  <p>Down on his knees at last among the small loose rocks, Coutlass began
  digging with his fingers&mdash;grew weary of that very soon, and drew out the
  long knife from his boot&mdash;dug with that like a frenzied man until from
  our tree we heard the hard point strike on metal. Then Schillingschen began
  to close in, and it was time for us to drop down from the tree.</p>

  <p>We made an abominable lot of noise about it, for the tree creaked, and our
  clothing tore on the thorny projections of limbs that seemed to have grown
  there since we climbed. To make matters worse, I stepped off the lowest
  branch, imagining there was another branch beneath it, and fell headlong,
  rifle and all, with a clatter and thump that should have alarmed the village
  half a mile away. And Will, not knowing what I had done but alarmed by the
  noise I made, jumped down on top of me.</p>

  <p>We picked ourselves up and listened. We could hear the short quick stabs
  of the knife as Coutlass loosed and scooped the earth out. Among the myriad
  noises of the African night our own, that seemed appalling to us, had passed
  unnoticed&mdash;or perhaps Schillingschen heard, and thought it was the
  injured lion dragging himself away. (Nobody needed worry about the chance of
  attack from that particular lion for many a night to come; he would ask
  nothing better than to be left to eat mice and carrion until his awful wounds
  were healed.)</p>

  <p>Reassured by the sound of digging we crept forward, knowing pretty well
  the best path to take from having seen Schillingschen stalking. But it was
  more by dint of their obsession than by any skill of ours that we crept up
  near without giving them alarm. Coutlass was still on his knees, throwing out
  the last few handfuls of loose dirt. Schillingschen stood almost over him, so
  close that the thrown dirt struck against his legs.</p>

  <p>We took up positions in the shadow, one to either side, almost afraid to
  breathe, I cursing because the rifle quivered in my two hands like the
  proverbial aspen leaf. The prospect of shooting a white man&mdash;even such a
  thorough-paced blackguard white as Schillingschen&mdash;made me as nervous as
  a school-girl at a grown-up party.</p>

  <p>At last Coutlass groped down shoulder-deep and drew the box out.</p>

  <p>"Give that to me!" Schillingschen shouted like a thunder-clap, making me
  jump as if I were the one intended.</p>

  <p>The moonlight gleamed on the tin box. Coutlass did not drop it but turned
  his head to look behind him. Schillingschen swung for his face with a
  clenched fist and the whole weight and strength of his ungainly body. He
  would have broken the jaw he aimed at had the blow landed; but the Greek's
  wit was too swift.</p>

  <p>He kicked like a mule, hard and suddenly, ducking his head, and then
  diving backward between the German's legs that were outspread to give him
  balance and leverage for the fist-blow. Schillingschen pitched over him head-
  forward, landing on both hands with one shoulder in the hole out of which the
  box had come. With the other arm he reached for the knife that Coutlass had
  laid on the loose earth. Coutlass reached for it, too, too late, and there
  followed a fight not at all inferior in fury to the battle of the lions.
  Humans are only feebler than the beasts, not less malicious.</p>

  <p>Will reached for the tin box, opened it, took out the diary, closed it
  again, put the diary in his own inner pocket, and returned the box; but they
  never saw or heard him. The German, with an arm as strong as an ape's, thrust
  again and again at Coutlass, missing his skin by a bait's breadth as the
  Greek held off the blows with the utmost strength of both hands.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Coutlass sprang to his feet, broke loose for a second, landed a
  terrific kick in the German's stomach, and closed again. He twisted
  Schillingschen's great splay beard into a wisp and wrenched it, forcing his
  head back, holding the knife-hand in his own left, and spitting between the
  German's parted teeth; then threw all his weight on him suddenly, and they
  went down together, Coutlass on top and Schillingschen stabbing violently in
  the direction of his ribs.</p>

  <p>Letting go the beard, Coutlass rained blows on the German's face with his
  free fist. Made frantic by that assault Schillingschen squirmed and upset the
  Greek's balance, rolled him partly over and, blinded by a very rain of blows,
  slashed and stabbed half a dozen times. Coutlass screamed once, and swore
  twice as the knife got in between his bones. The German could not wrench it
  out again. With both hands free now, the Greek seized him by the throat and
  began to throttle him, beating with his forehead on the purple face the while
  his steel fingers kneaded, as if the throat were dough.</p>

  <p>We were not at all inclined to stop Coutlass from killing the man. We came
  closer, to see the end, and Coutlass caught sight of us at last.</p>

  <p>"Shoot him!" he screamed. "Gassharamminy! Shoot him, can't you, while I
  hold him!"</p>

  <p>As he made that appeal the German convulsed his whole body like an
  earthquake, wrenched the knife loose at last, and as Coutlass changed
  position to guard against a new terrific stab rolled him over, freed himself
  and stood with upraised hand to give the finishing blow. Then suddenly he saw
  us and his jaw dropped, the beastly mess that had been his well-kept beard
  dropping an inch and showing where the Greeks fist had broken the front
  teeth. But that was only for a second&mdash;a second that gave Coutlass time
  to rise to his knees, and dodge the descending blow.</p>

  <p>I made up my mind then it was time to shoot the German, whatever the
  crimes of the Greek might be; but Coutlass had not grown slower of wit from
  loss of blood. As he dodged he rolled sidewise and seized my rifle, jerking
  it from my hand. He jerked too quickly. The German saw the move and kicked
  it, sending it spinning several yards away. We all made a sudden scramble for
  it, Schillingschen leading, when the German turned as suddenly as one of the
  great apes he so resembled, tripped Will by the heel, wrenched the rifle from
  his right hand, pounced on the empty tin box, and was gone!</p>

  <p>Too late, I remembered my own rifle and fired after him, emptying the
  magazine at shadows.</p>

  <p>Will's rage and self-contempt were more distressing than the Greek's
  spouting knife-wounds.</p>

  <p>"By blood and knuckle-bones! Give me that gun of yours, will you! I go
  after the swine! I cut his liver out! Where is my knife? Ah, there it is!
  Stoop and give it me, for my ribs hurt! So! Now I go after him!"</p>

  <p>We held Coutlass back, making him be still while we tore his shirt in
  strips, and then our own, and tried to staunch the blood, Will almost
  blubbering with rage while his fingers worked, and the Greek cursing us both
  for wasting time.</p>

  <p>"He has the box!" he screamed. "He has the rifle!"</p>

  <p>"He has no ammunition but what's in the magazine," said I; and that
  started Will off swearing at himself all over again from the beginning.</p>

  <p>"You damned yegg!" he complained as be knotted two strips of shirt. "This
  would never have happened if you hadn't sneaked out to steal the contents of
  the box!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly Coutlass screamed again, like a mad stallion smelling battle.</p>

  <p>"There he is! There the swine is! I see him! I hear him! Give me
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He reached for my rifle, but I was too quick that time and stepped back
  out of range of his arm. As I did that the blood burst anew from his wounds.
  He put his left hand to his side and scattered the hot blood up in the air in
  a sort of votive offering to the gods of Greek revenge, and, brandishing the
  long knife, tore away into the dark.</p>

  <p>"I see him!" he yelled. "I see the swine! By Gassharamminy! To-night his
  naked feet'll blister on the floor of hell!"</p>

  <p>We followed him, enthralled by mixed motives made of desire and a sort of
  half-genuine respect for the courage of this man, who claimed three countries
  and disgraced each one at intervals in turn. We did not go so fast as he. We
  were not so enamored of the risks the dark contained.</p>

  <p>Suddenly there came out of the blackness just ahead a marrow-curdling cry
  &mdash;agony, rage, and desperation&mdash;that surely no human ever
  uttered&mdash;roar, yelp of pain, and battle-cry in one.</p>

  <p>"Help!" yelled Coutlass. "Help! Oh-ah! Ah!"</p>

  <p>We raced forward then, I leading with my rifle thrust forward. A second
  later I fired; and that was the only time in my life I ever touched a lion's
  face with a rifle muzzle before I pulled the trigger! The brute fell all in a
  heap, with Coutlass underneath him and the Greek's long knife stuck in his
  shoulder to the hilt. The lion must have died within the minute without my
  shot to finish him.</p>

  <p>Coutlass lay dead under the defeated beast that had crawled away to hide
  and lick his wounds. We dragged his body out from under, and in proof that
  Schillingschen, the common enemy, lived, a bullet came whistling between us.
  The flash of my shot had given him direction. Perhaps he could see us, too,
  against the moon. We ducked, and lay still, but no more shots came.</p>

  <p>"He's only got four left," Will whispered. "Maybe he'll husband
  those!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe he knows by now that box is empty!" said I. "He'll stalk us on the
  way back!"</p>

  <p>"Us for the tree, then, until morning!" said Will.</p>

  <p>"Sure!" I answered. "And be shot out of it like crows out of a nest!"</p>

  <p>But Will had the right idea for all that. He was merely getting at it in
  his own way. After a little whispering we went to work with fevered fingers,
  stripping off the bloody bandages we had tied on the Greek's ribs&mdash;
  stripping off more of his clothes&mdash;then more of ours&mdash;tying them
  all into one&mdash;then skinning the mangled lion with the long knife that
  had really ended his career, tearing the hide into strips and knotting them
  each to each. In twenty minutes we had a slippery, smeary, smelly rope of
  sorts. In five more we had dragged the Greek's dead body underneath the
  tree.</p>

  <p>Then I went back to the vantage point among the rocks and waited until
  Will had thrown the rope with a stone tied to its end over an upper branch.
  Presently I saw Coutlass' dead body go clambering ungracefully up among the
  branches, looking so much less dead than alive that I thought at first Will
  must have tangled the rope in the crotch of the tree and be clambering up to
  release it.</p>

  <p>The ruse worked. Georges Coutlass served us dead as well as living. Out of
  the darkness to my left there came a flash and a report. I did not look to
  see whether the corpse in the tree jerked as the bullet struck. Before the
  flash had died&mdash;almost before the crack of the report bad reached my
  ear-drums I answered with three shots in quick succession.</p>

  <p>"Did you get him?" called Will.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," I answered. "If I didn't, he's only got three cartridges
  left!"</p>

  <p>We left the Greek's body in the tree for Schillingschen to shoot at
  further if be saw fit; it was safer there from marauding animals than if we
  had laid it on the ground, and as for the rites of the dead, it was a toss-up
  which was better, kites and vultures, or jackals and the ants. We saw no
  sense that night in laboring with a knife and our hands to bury a body that
  the brutes would dig up again within five minutes of our leaving it.</p>

  <p>"Schillingschen has three cartridges," said Will. "One each for you, me
  and Fred Oakes! I'll stay and trick him some more. I'll think up a new plan.
  I don't care if he gets me. I'd hate to face Fred without my rifle, and have
  to tell him the enemy is laying for him with it through my carelessness."</p>

  <p>It was my first experience of Will with hysteria, for it amounted to that.
  I remembered that to cure a bevy of school-girls of it one should rap out
  something sharply, with a cane if need be. Yet Will was not like a
  school-girl, and his hysteria took the pseudo-manly form of refusal to
  retreat. I yearned for Fred's camp-fires, and Fred's laugh, hot supper, or
  breakfast, or whatever the meal would be, and blankets. Will, with a ruthless
  murderer stalking him in the dark, yearned only for self-contentment. All at
  once I saw the thing to do, and thrust my rifle in his hands.</p>

  <p>"Take it," I said. "Hunt Schillingschen all night if you want to. I'm
  going back to tell Fred I've lost my rifle, and was afraid to face you for
  fear you'd laugh at me. Go on&mdash;take it! No, you've got to take it!"</p>

  <p>I let the rifle fall at his feet, and he was forced to pick it up. By that
  time I was on my way, and he had to hurry if he hoped to catch me. I kept him
  hurrying&mdash;cursing, and calling out to wait. And so, hours later, we
  arrived in sight of Fred's fires and answered his cheery challenge:</p>

  <p>"Halt there, or I'll shoot your bally head off!"</p>

  <p>Lions had kept him busy making the boys pile thornwood on the fires. He
  had shot two&mdash;one inside the enclosure, where the brute had jumped in a
  vain effort to reach the frantic donkeys. We stumbled over the carcass of the
  other as we made our way toward the gate-gap, and dragged it in ignominiously
  by the tail (not such an easy task as the uninitiated might imagine.)</p>

  <p>Once within the enclosure I left Will to tell Fred his story as best
  suited him, Fred roaring with laughter as he watched Will's rueful face, yet
  turning suddenly on Brown to curse him like a criminal for laughing, too!</p>

  <p>"Go and fetch that Mauser of yours, Brown, and give it to Mr. Yerkes in
  place of what he's lost! Hurry, please!"</p>

  <p>It was touch and go whether Brown would obey. But he happened to be sober,
  and realized that he had committed the impermissible offense. Fred might
  laugh at Will all he chose; so might I; either of us might laugh Fred out of
  countenance; or they might howl derisively at me. But Brown, camp-fellow
  though he was, and not bad fellow though he was, was not of our inner-guard.
  He might laugh with, never at, especially when catastrophe brought inner
  feelings to the surface.</p>

  <p>"Take the shot-gun if you care to," Fred told him, as he passed Will the
  rifle. "I'll unlock the chop-box presently, and let you have some
  whisky!"</p>

  <p>This last was the cruelest cut, but it did Brown good. When Fred kept his
  promise and produced a whole bottle from the locked-up store Brown refused to
  touch it, instead insulting him like a good man, cursing him&mdash;whisky,
  whiskers, whims and all, using language that Fred good-naturedly assured him
  was very unladylike.</p>

  <p>Before dawn the boys, peering through the gaps between the camp-fires, to
  distinguish lions if they could and give the alarm before another could jump
  in and do damage, swore they saw Schillingschen, rifle in hand, stalking
  among the shadows. Nothing could convince them they had not seen him. They
  said he stooped like a man in a dream&mdash;that big beard was matted, and
  his shirt torn&mdash;that he strode out of darkness into darkness like a man
  whose mind was gone. We purposely laughed at their story, to see if we could
  shake them in it. But they laughed at our incredulity.</p>

  <p>"My eyes are good eyes" answered Kazimoto. "What I see I see! Why should I
  invent lies?"</p>

  <p>It was not pleasant to imagine Schillingschen, mind gone or not, with or
  without three cartridges and a rifle, prowling about our camp awaiting
  opportunity to do murder.</p>

  <p>"Come to think of it," said Fred, "we've no proof he hasn't a lot more
  than three cartridges. It's hardly likely, but he might have cached some in
  reserve near where we found his camp pitched. More unlikely things have
  happened. But the bally man must go to sleep some time. He seems to have been
  awake ever since he escaped. We'll be off at dawn, and either tire him out or
  leave him!"</p>

  <p>"I'll bet he's got one or more of those donkeys," I answered. "He'll not
  be so easy to tire."</p>

  <p>"Suppose you and Will go and sleep," suggested Fred. "Otherwise we'll all
  go crazy, and all get left behind!"</p>

  <p>There did not remain much time for sleeping. The porters, being used to
  the tents and their loads now, got away to a good start, heading straight
  toward the frowning pile of Elgon that hove its great hump against a blue sky
  and domineered over the world to the northward.</p>

  <p>There were plenty of villages, well filled with timid spear-men and hard-
  working naked wives. Now that we had trade goods in plenty there was no
  difficulty at all about making friends with them. They had two obsessing
  fears: that it might not rain in proper season, and "the people" as they
  called themselves would "have too much hunger;" and that the men from the
  mountain might come and take their babies.</p>

  <p>"Which men, from what mountain?"</p>

  <p>"Bad men, from very high up on that mountain!" They pointed toward Elgon,
  shuddered, and looked away.</p>

  <p>"Why should they take your babies?"</p>

  <p>"They eat them!"</p>

  <p>"What makes you think that?"</p>

  <p>"We know it! They come! Once in so often they come and fight with us, and
  take away, and kill and eat our fat babies!"</p>

  <p>All the inhabitants of all the villages agreed. None of them had ever
  ventured on the mountain; but all agreed that very bad black men came raiding
  from the upper slopes at uncertain intervals. There was no variation of the
  tale.</p>

  <p>One thing puzzled us much more than the cannibal story. We heard shooting
  a long way off behind us to our right&mdash;two shots, followed by the
  unmistakable ringing echo among growing trees. Had Schillingschen decided to
  desert us? And if so, how did he dare squander two of his three cartridges at
  once&mdash;supposing he were not now mad, as our boys, and his, all vowed he
  was? His own ten men began to beg to be protected from him, and the captured
  Baganda recommended in best missionary English that we seek the services of
  the first witch doctor we could find.</p>

  &mdash;<i>The Song Of The Elephants</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">WE had laughed at Fred's suggestion that Schillingschen
  might have ammunition cached away. Fred had sneered at my guess that the
  German might ride donkey-back and not be so easily left behind. Now the
  probability of both suggestions seemed to stiffen into reality.</p>

  <p>Day followed day, and Schillingschen, squandering cartridges not far away
  behind us, always had more of them. He seemed, too, to lose interest in
  keeping so extremely close to us, as we raced to get away from him toward the
  mountain. If he was really crazy, as his trembling boys maintained, then for
  a crazy man blazing at everything or nothing he was shooting remarkably
  little. On the contrary, if he was sane, and shooting for the pot, be must
  have acquired a big following in some mysterious manner, or else have lost
  his marksmanship when Coutlass bruised his eyes. He fired each day, judging
  by the echo of the shots, about as many cartridges as we did, who had to feed
  a fairly long column of men, and make presents of meat, in addition, to the
  chiefs of villages. It began to be a mystery how he carried so much
  ammunition, unless he had donkeys or porters.</p>

  <p>Soon we began to pass through a country where elephants bad been. There
  was ruin a hundred yards wide, where a herd of more than a thousand of them
  must have swept in panic for fifteen miles. There were villages with roofs
  not yet re-thatched, whose inhabitants came and begged us to take vengeance
  on the monsters, showing us their trampled enclosures, torn-down huts, and
  ruined plantations. They offered to do whatever we told them in the way of
  taking part, and several times we marshaled the men of two or three villages
  together in an effort to get a line to windward and drive the herd our
  way.</p>

  <p>But each time, as the plan approached development, ringing shots from
  behind us put the brutes to flight. It became uncanny&mdash;as if
  Schillingschen in his new mad mood was able to divine exactly when his noise
  would work most harm. Our fool boys told the local natives that a madman was
  on our heels, and after that all offers of help ceased, even from those who
  had suffered most from the elephants. We began to be regarded as mad
  ourselves. Efforts to get natives to go scouting to watch Schillingschen, and
  report to us, were met with point-blank refusal. Rumor began to precede us,
  and from one village that had suffered more than usually badly from passing
  elephants the inhabitants all fled at the first sign of Brown, leading our
  long single column.</p>

  <p>We followed the herd. Its track was wide, and easier than the winding
  native foot-paths; and we were willing enough to jettison loads of
  trade-goods if only we could replace them with tusks. The chase led up toward
  Elgon, over the shoulder of an outlying spur, and upward toward the
  mountain's eastern slopes.</p>

  <p>As long as we kept in the wake of the herd the going presented no
  difficulties. We knew by the state of the tracks and the dung that the herd
  was never far ahead. Frequently we heard them crashing through trees in front
  of us. Yet whenever we came so close as to hope for a view, and a shot at a
  tusker, invariably a regular fusillade from the eastward to our rear would
  start the herd stampeding with a din like all the avalanches.</p>

  <p>Streams by the dozen flowed down from the mountain's sides, their banks
  crushed into bog where the elephants had crossed. Our donkeys grew used to
  being tied by the head in line and hauled across (for in common with all
  herds of donkeys, there were a few of them that swam readily, and many that
  either could not or refused). The flies in the wake of the elephants were
  worse than the tsetse that haunted the shore of Nyanza.</p>

  <p>We had no trouble now from our boys. We could even let the Baganda's hands
  loose. They feared the cannibals of the higher slopes, but were much more
  afraid of the madman to our right rear. Our difficulty lay in compelling them
  to keep a course sufficiently to eastward, and in calling a halt each day
  before men and animals were too utterly tired out. Yet for all their hurry,
  we did not gain on the man who made them so afraid.</p>

  <p>Elephants, once thoroughly seared, will ran away forever. Our boys openly
  praised the herd in front for its speed and stamina, hoping it would continue
  on its course and oblige us to keep the madman with the rifle at a safe
  distance to our rear. But it seemed he had an easier line than we, or else
  his frenzy gave him seven-league boots, for he even began to gain on us,
  keeping along our right flank at a distance of several miles, and driving us
  nearly mad in the frantic effort to keep our column from turning and running
  away to the westward. If we had relaxed our vigilance for a moment they would
  have broken line and fled.</p>

  <p>It was old volcanic country we were marching through, densely wooded,
  virgin forest for the most part, with earth so warm at times that it was not
  easy to believe the crater of Elgon quite extinct. Even at that low level we
  came on blow-holes nearly filled in with dirt and trash, serving as fine
  caves for beasts of prey. We went into one for about three hundred paces
  before it narrowed into nothing, and would have camped in it but for the
  stink. It smelt like a place where the egg of original sin had turned rotten.
  Fred said that was sulfur, with the air of a man who would like it believed
  that he knew.</p>

  <p>At last the enemy must have made a night march, for he passed us, and the
  following dawn we heard him shooting to our right in front. That morning it
  was simply impossible to make the boys break camp. They swore that the ghost
  of Schillingschen had gone in league with the elephants to destroy us, and
  they preferred to be shot by us rather than murdered by witchcraft.</p>

  <p>Beyond doubt they would have bolted and left us had that camp not been an
  almost perfect one, on rising ground with two great wings of rock almost
  enclosing it, and a singing brook galloping through the midst. There was only
  one gap by which elephant or man could enter (unless they should fall from
  the sky), and they closed that by rolling rocks and dragging up trunks of
  trees.</p>

  <p>After a useless argument, during which we all lost our tempers and they
  were reduced to the verge of panic, we decided to leave them there in charge
  of Brown and those porters, except Kazimoto, who had rifles. The armed men
  promised faithfully to die beside Brown in the only place of exit rather than
  permit a man to pass out; and the rest all agreed it would be right to shoot
  them if they attempted to desert; but we left the camp together&mdash;Fred,
  Will, I, and Kazimoto, with Will's personal servant and mine bringing up the
  rear&mdash;wondering whether we should ever see any member or part of the
  outfit again. It felt like going to a funeral&mdash;or rather from it
  &mdash;more than likely Brown's.</p>

  <p>Kazimoto and the other two should have been carrying spare rifles; but
  Brown had refused to remain behind unless we left him all but the one apiece
  we absolutely needed. We took the boys more from habit than for any use they
  were likely to be; and my boy and Will's bolted back to the camp almost
  before we were out of sight of it, Kazimoto begging us to shoot them in the
  back for cowards.</p>

  <p>"Huh!" he grunted. "They are afraid of death. Teach them what death
  is!"</p>

  <p>We heard Brown challenge them as they approached the camp, and hoped he
  thrashed them soundly. But it turned out he did not. He himself had grown
  afraid; for the fear of a crowd is contagious, and spreads nearly as readily
  from black to white as from white to black. He broke open a chop-box and
  consoled himself with whisky.</p>

  <p>Forcing our way through vegetation that crowded around a spur of volcanic
  rock, it soon became evident that the whole of the huge herd was breakfasting
  not far in front of us, tearing off limbs of trees, and crashing about as if
  noise were the only object. We climbed and attempted to look down on them,
  only to discover that the part of the forest where we were consisted of a
  narrow belt, with a mile-wide open space beyond it between us and the
  elephants. The wind was from them toward us, but that did not wholly account
  for the amount of noise that reached us. It was the fact that the herd was
  twice as big as we imagined. There were elephants in every direction. We
  could see and hear branches breaking with reports like cannon-fire.</p>

  <p>Kazimoto was as steady as an old soldier, a great grin spreading across
  his ugly honest face, and his eyes alight with enthusiasm. This was the
  profession he had followed when he was Courtney's gun-bearer, and he kept
  close to Fred with a handful of cartridges ready to pass to him, whispering
  wise counsel.</p>

  <p>"Get close to them, bwana! Go close! Go close! Wind coming our way&mdash;
  smell coming our way&mdash;noise coming our way&mdash;elephant very busy
  eating&mdash;no hurry! No long shooting! Go right up close!"</p>

  <p>It was easier said than done. The elephants had spread broadcast through
  the forest, and there was no longer one well-defined swath to follow, but a
  very great number of twisting narrow alleys through elastic undergrowth
  between great unyielding trees. We had to separate, to gain any advantage
  from our number, so that we emerged into the open more than a hundred yards
  apart, with Fred at the far left and Will in the center. Fred, with Kazimoto
  close at his heels, was more than fifty yards in front of either of us.</p>

  <p>And crossing that mile of open land was no simple business. It was a mass
  of rocks and tree-roots, burned over in some swift-running forest fire and
  not yet re-seeded, nor yet rotted down. There were winding ways all across it
  by the dozen that the elephants, with their greater height and better
  woodcraft, could follow on the run, but great stumps and rocks higher than a
  man's head (that from a distance had looked like level land) blocked all
  vision and made progress mostly guesswork.</p>

  <p>However, the latter half-mile was more like level going&mdash;I emerged
  from between two boulders, wondering whether I could ever find my way back
  again, and envied Fred, who had found a better track and had the lead of me
  now by several hundred yards. Will was as far behind him as I, but had gone
  over more to the left, leaving me&mdash;feeling remarkably lonely&mdash; away
  in the rear to the right.</p>

  <p>Kazimoto followed Fred so closely, stooping low behind him, that the two
  looked like some strange four-legged beast. They were headed for the forest
  in front of them at a great pace, increasing their lead from Will, who, like
  me, was more or less winded. I stooped at a pool to scoop up water and splash
  my face and neck. When I looked up a moment later I could see none of
  them.</p>

  <p>At that instant, when I could actually smell the great brutes crashing in
  the forest, unseen within a hundred yards of me, and would have given all I
  had or hoped for just to have a friend within speaking distance, a shot rang
  out in the forest ahead, and rattled from tree to tree like the echo of a
  skirmish. It was not from Fred's gun, or Will's. It was the phantom rifleman
  at work again. Schillingschen&mdash;Schillingschen's ghost&mdash;or whoever
  he was, he could not have timed his fusillade better for our undoing. The
  first shot was followed by six more in swift succession. And then chaos broke
  loose.</p>

  <p>Toward where I stood, from every angle to my front, the whole herd
  stampeded. No human being could have guessed their number. The forest awoke
  with a battle-din of falling trees and crashing undergrowth, split apart by
  the trumpeting of angry bulls and the screams of cows summoning their young
  ones. The earth shook under the weight of their tremendous rout. I heard
  Fred's rifle ring out three times far to my left&mdash;then Will's a rifle
  nearer to me; and at that the herd swung toward its own left, and the whole
  lot of them came full-pelt, blind, screaming, frantic, straight for me.</p>

  <p>There was no turning them now. None but the very farthest on the flank
  could have turned, given sense enough left to do it. It was a flood of
  maddened monsters, crazed with fear, pent by their own numbers, forced
  forward by the crowd behind, that invited me to dam them if I could! As they
  burst into the open, more shots rang out in the forest to lend their fury
  wings!</p>

  <p>I glanced behind, to right and left, but there was no escape, I had come
  too far into the open to retreat! There were big rocks to the rear to have
  scrambled on, but there was no time. There was one big rock in front of me
  that divided their course about in halves; to pass it they must open up,
  although they would almost surely close again. I took my stand in line with
  that, as a man on trial for life takes refuge behind an unestablishable
  alibi.</p>

  <p>They talk glibly about men's whole lives passing in review before them in
  the instant of a crisis. That may be. That was a crisis, and I saw elephants
  &mdash;elephants! I remembered some of what Courtney had told us&mdash; some
  of the mad yarns Coutlass spun when liquor and the camp-fire made him
  boastful. All the advice I ever heard; all my previous imaginings of what I
  should do when such a time came, seemed to be condensed into one concrete
  demand&mdash;shoot, shoot, shoot, and keep on shooting! Yet my finger, bent
  around the trigger, absolutely would not act!</p>

  <p>The oncoming gray wave of brutes split apart at the rock, as it must do,
  some of them screaming as they crashed into it breast on and were crushed by
  the crowd behind. In the van of the right-hand wing, brushing the rock with
  his shoulder, charged an enormous bull with tusks so large that the heavier
  had weighed down his head to a permanent rakish angle. He caught sight of me
  &mdash;trumpeted like a siren in the Channel fog&mdash;and came at me with
  raised ears and trunk outstretched. I heard shooting to the left, and more
  shots from the forest, where the very active ghost or madman was keeping up a
  battle of his own. I felt the fear, that turns a man's very heart to ice,
  grip hold of me&mdash;felt as if nothing mattered&mdash;imagined the whole
  universe a sea of charging elephants&mdash;accepted the inevitable &mdash;and
  suddenly received my manhood back again! My forefinger acted! I fired
  point-blank down the throat of the charging bull. And it seemed to have no
  more effect on him than a pea-shooter has on a railroad train!</p>

  <p>I had left Schillingschen's heavy-bored elephant gun behind with Brown,
  considering it too cumbersome, and was using a Mauser with flat-nosed
  bullets. I fired four shots as fast as I could pump them from the magazine
  straight down the monster's hot red throat; and he continued to come on as if
  I had not touched him, hard-pressed on either flank by bulls nearly as big as
  he.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the reason why my past history did not flash review was that my
  time was not yet come! I continued to see elephant&mdash;nothing but
  elephant!&mdash;little bloodshot eyes aflame with frenzy&mdash;great tusks
  upthrown&mdash;a trunk upraised to brain me&mdash;huge flat feet that raged
  to tread me down and knead me into purple mud! I kept the last shot with a
  coolness I believe was really numbness&mdash;then felt his hot breath like a
  blast on my face, and let him have it, straight down the throat again!</p>

  <p>He screamed&mdash;stopped&mdash;quivered right over me&mdash;toppled from
  the knees&mdash;and fell like a landslide, pushed forward as he tumbled by
  the weight behind, and held from rolling sidewise by the living tide on
  either flank. I tried to spring back, but his falling trunk struck me to
  earth. On either side of me a huge tusk drove into the ground, and I lay
  still between them, as safe as if in bed, while the herd crashed past to
  right and left for so many minutes that it seemed all the universe was
  elephants&mdash;bulls, cows and calves all trumpeting in mad desire to get
  away&mdash;away&mdash;anywhere at all so be it was not where they then
  were.</p>

  <p>Blood poured on me from the dead brute's throat&mdash;warm, slippery,
  sticky stuff; but I lay still. I did not move when the crashing had all gone
  by, but lay looking up at the monster that had willed his worst and, seeking
  to slay, had saved me. Those are the moments when young men summon all their
  calf-philosophy. I wondered what the difference was between that brute and
  me, that I should be justified in slaying; that I should be congratulated;
  that I should have been pitied, had the touch-and-go reversed itself and he
  killed me. I knew there was a difference that had nothing to do with shape,
  or weight, or size, but I could not give it a name or lay my finger on
  it.</p>

  <p>My reverie, or reaction, or whatever it was, was broken by Fred's voice,
  flustered and out of breath, coming nearer at a great pace.</p>

  <p>"I tell you the poor chap's dead as a door-nail! He's under that great
  bull, I tell you! He's simply been charged and flattened out! What a dog I
  was&mdash;what a green-horn&mdash;what a careless, fat-headed tomfool to
  leave him alone like that! He was the least experienced of all of us, and we
  let him take the full brunt of a charging herd! We ought to be hung, drawn
  and quartered! I shall never forgive myself! As for you, Will, it wasn't half
  as much your fault as mine! You were following me. You expected me to give
  the orders, and I ought to have called a halt away back there until we were
  all three in touch! I'll never forgive myself&mdash;never!"</p>

  <p>I crawled out then from between the tusks, and shook myself, much more
  dazed than I expected, and full of an unaccountable desire to vomit.</p>

  <p>"Damn your soul!" Fred fairly yelled at me. "What the hell d'you mean by
  startling me in that way! Why aren't you dead? Look out! What's the matter
  with the man? The poor chap's hurt&mdash;I knew he was!"</p>

  <p>But that inexplicable desire to empty all I had inside me out on to the
  trampled ground could no longer be resisted, that was all. The aftermath of
  deadly fear is fear's corollary. Each bears fruit after its kind.</p>

  <p>To my one tusker Will and Fred had brought down five and six respectively.
  That made twenty-three tusks, for one was an enormous "singleton." We sent
  Kazimoto back alone to try to persuade some of our porters to come and chop
  out the ivory with axes, bidding him promise them all the hearts, and as many
  tail-hairs as they chose to pull out to keep witches away with. Then, since
  my sickness passed presently and left me steady on my legs, Fred made a
  proposal that we jumped at.</p>

  <p>"Let's go and lay Schillingschen's ghost! If that was Schillingschen
  shooting in the forest, we've a little account with him! If it wasn't I want
  to know it! Come along!"</p>

  <p>We advanced into the forest and toiled up-hill along the tracks the
  stampeding elephants had made, amid flies indescribable, and almost
  intolerable heat. The blood on my clothing made me a veritable feeding-place
  of flies, until I threw most of it off, and then began to suffer in addition
  from bites I could not feel before, and from the sharp points of beckoning
  undergrowth. My bare legs began to bleed from scratches, and the flies
  swooped anew on those, and clung as if they grew there.</p>

  <p>Will climbed a huge tree, at imminent risk of pythons and rotten branches,
  and descried open country on our right front. We made for it, I walking last
  to take advantage of the others' wake, and after more than an hour of most
  prodigious effort we emerged on rolling rocky country under a ledge that
  overhung a thousand feet sheer above us on the side of Elgon. To our right
  was all green grass, sloping away from us.</p>

  <p>There was a camp half a mile away pitched on the edge of the forest
  &mdash;a white man's tent&mdash;a mule&mdash;meat hanging to dry in the wind
  under a branch&mdash;two tents for natives&mdash;and a pile of bags and boxes
  orderly arranged. We could see a man sitting under a big tent awning. He was
  reading, or writing, or something of that kind. He was certainly not
  Schillingschen. We hurried. Fred presently broke into a run; then,
  half-ashamed, checked himself and waited for me, who was beyond running.</p>

  <p>When we came quite close we saw that the man was playing chess all by
  himself with a folding board open on his knees. He did not look up, although
  by that time he surely should have heard us. Fred began to walk quietly,
  signaling to the camp hangers-on to say nothing. We followed him silently in
  Indian file. As he came near the awning Fred tip-toed, and I felt like
  giggling, or yelling&mdash;like doing anything ridiculous.</p>

  <p>He who played chess yawned suddenly, and closed the chess-board with a
  snap. He got up lazily, smiled, stretched himself like a great good-looking
  cat, faced Fred, and laughed outright.</p>

  <p>"Glad to see you all! Did you get many elephants?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Monty, you old pirate&mdash;I knew it was you!" said Fred, holding a hand
  out.</p>

  <p>Monty took it, and forced him into the chair he had just vacated.</p>

  <p>"You damned old liar!" he said, nodding approvingly.</p>

  <p class="poem">Now for opulence and place<br>

  <br>
  &mdash;"They Toil Not, Neither Do They Spin"</p><br>

  <p class="first">NOBODY in camp slept that night. When the tusks had been
  chopped out, and our camp carried across and pitched beside
  Monty's&mdash;ivory weighed &mdash;lion-proof boma built&mdash;and
  elephant-heart portioned out to the men, who gorged themselves on it in order
  that their own hearts might grow great and strong; when all the myriad
  matters had been seen to that make camping in the tropics such a business,
  then there were tales to be told. We demanded Monty's first; he ours; and
  because his was likely to be much the shortest we won that argument.</p>

  <p>"Wait one minute, though," he insisted. "Before I begin, have you any
  notion who a man with a beard could be&mdash;bruised face-broken front
  teeth&mdash;Mauser rifle&mdash;big dark beard cut shovel-shape&mdash;
  enormously powerful by the look of his shoulders and arms? I came on him
  three, no, four days' march back."</p>

  <p>"Schillingschen!" we exclaimed with one voice.</p>

  <p>"Show me Schillingschen!" echoed Brown, who was very drunk by that time,
  nearly ready to be put to bed. "Show me Schillingschen, an' I'll show you a
  corpse!"</p>

  <p>"He's right," nodded Monty. "The man's dead. Blew his brains out with his
  last cartridge. Looked to me to have lost himself. Slept in trees, I should
  say. Clothing all torn. Hadn't been dead long when some of my boys came on
  him and drove away the jackals. Had he been in a fight, do you know?"</p>

  <p>But we would not tell him that tale until we had his own.</p>

  <p>"Mine's short and simple," he began. "Some ruffians boarded my ship at
  Suez, who made such eyes at me, and so obviously intended to do me damage at
  the first opportunity, that I talked it over with the captain (giving him a
  hint or two of the possible reason) and he agreed to slip me off secretly at
  Ismailia. It was easy&mdash;middle of the night, you know&mdash;had the
  doctor isolate the ruffians on the starboard side while the ship anchored
  &mdash;some cooked-up excuse about quarantine&mdash;and kept 'em out of sight
  of what was happening until the ship went on again. Very simple."</p>

  <p>"Go on, Didums&mdash;we'll be all night talking&mdash;what did you do with
  the King of Belgium?" Fred demanded.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Didn't go near the King of Belgium. I was quarantined at
  Ismailia on wholly imaginary grounds for fourteen days; and who should come
  smiling into the same lazaretto on the last day but Frederick Courtney
  &mdash;a very old friend of mine!"</p>

  <p>"He was to go to Somaliland," I said.</p>

  <p>"So he told me. He's on his way there now. Decided for reasons of his own
  to enter the country by way of Abyssinia. Told me of the advice he'd given
  you fellows, and assured me he'd seen King Leopold himself on the very matter
  scarcely a year before. Of course, he said, I might succeed where he failed,
  using influence and all that sort of thing, but he assured me Leopold was
  hard to deal with, and difficult to tie down. His advice was, go back to
  Elgon, and hunt for the stuff there."</p>

  <p>"That's what he kept advising us," said Will. "But why should he give away
  his information free? And if it's good, where did he get it?"</p>

  <p>"Courtney's no dog in the manger," Monty answered. "He told me of this man
  Schillingschen. Said he had sent in a report about him to the Home
  Government, but couldn't for the life of him get documentary evidence with
  which to back up his charges."</p>

  <p>Will whistled, and drew out the diary he had rescued from the tin box.
  Fred nodded. Will threw it to Monty, who caught it.</p>

  <p>"He told me this Schillingschen had searched the whole country over for
  the stuff&mdash;had it straight from Schillingschen's boys&mdash;I dare say
  you know how Courtney can make a native tell him all he knows.
  Schillingschen, he said, had eliminated pretty nearly all the likely places
  until Mount Elgon was about all there is left. Courtney said, too, that there
  were always so many thousands of elephants near Elgon that Tippoo Tib
  probably gathered a harvest there. We discussed probabilities, and agreed it
  wasn't likely he would carry the stuff far in order to hide it. It seemed
  likely to both of us, too, that if the quantity the old man hid was anything
  like what rumor says, then there were probably half a dozen hiding-places,
  not one. Most of the stuff may be in the Congo Free State, and we'll do well
  to leave that to Leopold of Belgium and his pet concessionaires. Some of it
  may be near here. I stayed in the lazaretto an extra day with Courtney,
  talking it over. One other thing he remembered to tell me was that
  Schillingschen had hunted high and low for Tippoo Tib's old servants, and had
  finally managed to have the relatives of that man Hassan&mdash;I remember,
  Fred, you called him Johnson in Zanzibar&mdash;thrown in jail in German East
  for some alleged offense or other."</p>

  <p>Monty stopped to scrape out a faithful pipe, fill it, press down tobacco
  with a practiced thumb, and reach toward the campfire for a burning brand.
  Then he smoked for two minutes reflectively.</p>

  <p>"I offered Courtney a share should we find the stuff. Knew you fellows
  would agree." Pause. "Courtney wouldn't hear of it." Pause. "Said good-bye to
  him, and took a coastwise trading steamer back to Mombasa. Delightful trip
  &mdash;put in everywhere&mdash;saw everything. Saw a lot of the Galla
  &mdash;fine tribe, the Galla."</p>

  <p>"Suppose you cut the travelogue stuff until later on!" suggested Will.</p>

  <p>"Landed at Mombasa, and learned the first day that you fellows had managed
  to make more enemies than friends. Put in a number of days on heavy social
  labor&mdash;lingered at the club&mdash;drank too much of their infernal
  gin-and-black-pepper appetizer&mdash;but made you fellows right, I
  think."</p>

  <p>"We're not interested in the slumming. Go on and tell us what you did!"
  urged Fred.</p>

  <p>"That is what I did&mdash;and undid. I made friends. Soon I had all the
  other junior officials in a state of mind to help me if they could. Then I
  began to inquire for Hassan. They drew the dragnet tight, and discovered him
  at Nairobi! A young assistant district superintendent of police, who will
  rise in the service, I hope, before long, discovered a woman&mdash;who was
  jealous of a man&mdash;who was just then making love to the dusky damsel
  particularly favored by Hassan; and in that roundabout way we discovered that
  Hassan intended to take a trip very soon toward Mount Elgon, where, if you
  please, he was to take part in Professor Schillingschen's ethnological
  studies. On condition that he held his tongue until I gave him leave to talk,
  I promised that young policeman&mdash;to put him en rapport with
  Schillingschen's doings as swiftly as may be. Then I returned to Mombasa, and
  got your code letter saying you would head this way. It all fitted in like a
  game of chess."</p>

  <p>"How in the world did you get that letter so soon?" demanded Fred. "The
  missionary chap was to mail it in Ujiji, via Salisbury, Rhodesia."</p>

  <p>"I suppose he simply didn't do that, that's all," Monty answered. "The
  bank manager told me he received it in the mission mail bag&mdash;from Ujiji,
  yes, but by way of Muanza, Tabora, and Dar es Salaam. It reached me in the
  nick of time. I must have been marching nearly parallel with you chaps for
  about a week!"</p>

  <p>"If coincidence of evidence means anything," said Will "we're all on a
  red-hot scent! That Baganda we have in our outfit is our prisoner. One of
  Schillingschen's pet pimps. He swears Hassan&mdash;or rather some old native
  whose name he doesn't know&mdash;was to meet Schillingschen in these parts
  and lead him to where he actually helped bury the ivory, years ago!"</p>

  <p>"We may have difficulty finding him," said I. "Mount Elgon's big!"</p>

  <p>"What about Brown?" asked Monty. "I hope you haven't made him partner? I
  agree, of course, if you have, but I hope not!"</p>

  <p>"Nothing doing!"</p>

  <p>"No. Why should we?"</p>

  <p>"Brown's all right, but a present ought to satisfy him."</p>

  <p>We began to tell Monty about Brown's cattle that Coutlass stole, and the
  Masai looted from Coutlass and us.</p>

  <p>"Were they branded?" asked Monty.</p>

  <p>"Branded and hoof- and ear-marked," said I.</p>

  <p>"Then they ought to be traceable, even among the huge herds the Masai
  have. I think I've influence enough by this time with this government to have
  those cattle traced and returned to Brown."</p>

  <p>"They're his only love!" said I. "Do that for him, and he'll never wait to
  receive a present!"</p>

  <p>Dawn found us still recounting our adventures and Monty alternately
  laughing and frowning.</p>

  <p>"I regret Coutlass" he said, shaking the ashes from his pipe at last when
  Kazimoto brought our breakfast. "I regretted having to throw him out of the
  hotel in Zanzibar. I wish he could have escaped with his life&mdash;a
  picturesque scoundrel if ever there was one! I'd rather be robbed by him than
  flattered by ten Schillingschens or Lady Saffren Waldons. I suppose if I'd
  been with you I'd have killed him. It's well I wasn't. I might have regretted
  it all my days!"</p>

  <p>We buried our newly won ivory under a tree, locating the spot exactly with
  the aid of Monty's compass, and broke camp, starting sleepless up the
  mountain. As Monty said:</p>

  <p>"No use meandering around the mountain. Hassan might be higher up or lower
  down. If he is there you may depend on it he's tired of waiting. He's looking
  for a safari. Let's climb where we can be seen from miles away."</p>

  <p>So climb we did, thousand after thousand feet, until the night air grew so
  cold that the porters' teeth chattered and they threatened to desert us. They
  grew afraid, too, remembering the tales the villagers had told them down
  below.</p>

  <p>"Wow! You are not fat babies!" Kazimoto told them. "Who would eat such
  stringy meat as you?"</p>

  <p>We came to caves that none of the men dared enter&mdash;vast, gloomy
  tunnels into the mountain through which the chill wind whistled like a dirge.
  Yet the caverns were warmer than the wind, and not bad camping-places if we
  could have persuaded the boys to take advantage of them.</p>

  <p>The earth, too, all over the mountain and the range to eastward of it was
  warm in spite of the wind. In places there were warm springs bubbling from
  the rock, and at night and early morning a blanket of white mist that was
  remarkably like steam covered everything. It was a land of thunderless
  lightning&mdash;lightning from a clear sky, flashing here and there without
  warning or excuse. On the high slopes there was little or no game, and no
  signs whatever of inhabitants, until late one afternoon the porters shouted,
  and we saw an old man racing toward us along the top of a ridge.</p>

  <p>He held his hands out, and shouted as he ran&mdash;a round-faced, big-
  bellied man, although not nearly so fat as when we saw him last; unclean,
  unkempt, in tattered shirt and crushed-in fez&mdash;a man with one desire
  expressed all over him&mdash;to see, and touch, and talk with other men. He
  ran and threw himself at Monty's feet, clasped his legs, and blubbered.</p>

  <p>"Oh bwana! Oh, bwana! Oh, bwana!"</p>

  <p>"Get up, Johnson!" Fred took him by the arm and raised him. "Tell us
  what's the matter."</p>

  <p>"Men who eat men! Men who eat men! I had three porters to carry my tent
  and food. Now I have none. They have eaten them! Now they hunt me!"</p>

  <p>"Well, you're safe," said Monty. "Calm yourself."</p>

  <p>"But you are not bwana Schillingschen! I am here to wait for him. Have you
  seen him? Where is he?"</p>

  <p>Fred answered him. "Dead!"</p>

  <p>Hassan threw himself on the ground again at Monty's feet.</p>

  <p>"Oh, what shall I do?" he blubbered. "I am an old man. Who shall take my
  people out of jail? Who shall go to Dar es Salaam and make Germans give them
  up?"</p>

  <p>"If you're willing to show us what you intended to show Schillingschen,"
  said Monty, "I'll do what I can for your relations."</p>

  <p>"What can you do? Oh, what can you do? No man but a German can make these
  Germans cease from punishing!"</p>

  <p>Monty beckoned to the Baganda who had once done Schillingschen's dirty
  work.</p>

  <p>"D'you see this man? This is a German spy. The German will be willing to
  hand over your relations in exchange for a promise not to make a fuss about
  this man. Wait a minute, though! Are your relations criminals?"</p>

  <p>"No, bwana! No, bwana! My relations honorable folk! Formerly living in
  Zanzibar&mdash;going to Bagamoyo to serve in German family by invitation of
  person attached to German Consulate&mdash;no sooner landed than thrown in
  jail on charges they know nothing whatever about. Then Schillingschen he
  finding me, and say to me, 'You show where is that Tippoo Tib's ivory, and
  your relations shall go free!' And Tippoo Tib, he say to me, 'You take first
  step to show any man where is that ivory, and you shall be fed to white ants
  by my faithful people!' And Schillingschen he catch two of them faithful
  people, and feed 'em to white ants when nobody looking that way!
  Schillingschen terrible! Tippoo Tib terrible! What shall do? Tippoo Tib, he
  one time making me go long trip with bwana Coutlass, very bad Greek. bwana
  Coutlass wanting ivory&mdash;me pretending showing him&mdash;leading him
  wrong way. Coutlass very bad man, beating me ngumu sana.* All the same, me
  more afraid of Tippoo Tib and bwana Schillingschen. Not long ago Tippoo Tib
  sending me with bwana Coutlass second time, making bad threats against me if
  I not lead him wrong. Then Schillingschen he send for me and making worse
  threats! Oh, what shall do! Oh, what shall do!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>ngumu sana</i>&mdash;very severely. <i><a href=
  "http://research.yale.edu/cgi-bin/swahili/lookup.cgi?Word=gumu&amp;EngP=0">The
  Internet Living Swahili Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>"You shall show us where that ivory is!" Monty answered him. "Stop
  blubbering! Get up! Look here! See this! (Get me that diary, Will.) If the
  Germans won't release your relations from jail on account of this Baganda,
  this is a written book that will make them do it! In this book are the names
  of men who have broken treaties and the law of nations. When the Germans know
  the British Government in London has this book under lock and key, they will
  think it a little thing to release your relations for the sake of avoiding
  trouble!"</p>

  <p>"Promise me, bwana! You promise me!"</p>

  <p>"I promise I will do my best for you."</p>

  <p>"Word of an Englishman&mdash;promise!"</p>

  <p>"Word of an Englishman&mdash;I promise to do my best!"</p>

  <p>That was a proud enough moment on the shoulder of a mountain, with
  wilderness in every direction farther than the highest eagle in the air above
  could see, to have that helpless, hopeless ex-slave, part Arab, part
  machenzi,* put his whole stock-in-trade&mdash;his secret&mdash;all he had on
  earth to bargain with for those he loved&mdash;in the balance on the promise
  of an Englishman. It was a tribute to a race that has had its share, no
  doubt, of bad men, but has won dominion over half the earth and pretty much
  all the sea by keeping faith with men who could not by any means compel good
  faith.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>machenzi</i> (Swahili)&mdash;bumpkin; clodhopper;

  <p>"Then I tell!" said Hassan. "Then I show!"</p>

  <p>But now a new fear seized him, and he clung to Monty, trembling and
  jabbering.</p>

  <p>"The men who eat men! The men who eat men!"</p>

  <p>"Pah! Cannibals!" sneered Fred. "They're always cowards!"</p>

  <p>"Tippoo Tib, he afraid of nothing&mdash;nobody! He is hiding the ivory
  where men who eat men can guard it and none dare come!"</p>

  <p>"Lead on, McDuff!" Fred grinned, shouldering his rifle.</p>

  <p>All of us except Monty had beards by that time that fluttered in the wind,
  and looked desperate enough for any venture. Considering the rifles and our
  uncouth appearance, Hassan took heart of grace. He insisted on an armed guard
  to walk on either side of him, and nearly drove Kazimoto frantic by ducking
  behind rocks at intervals, imagining he saw an enemy; but he did not refuse
  any longer to show the way.</p>

  <p>It seemed that in expectation of Schillingschen's early arrival he had
  camped within a mile of the place where the stuff was hidden, taking
  unreasoning courage from the bare fact of having the redoubtable
  Schillingschen for friend. But the cannibals (who must have been a hungry
  folk, for there were no plantations, and almost no animals on all those upper
  slopes) had pounced on his three lean porters, missing himself by a hair's
  breadth.</p>

  <p>In hiding, he had watched his three men killed, toasted before a fire in a
  cavern-mouth, and eaten. Then he had run for his life, following the shoulder
  of the mountain in the hope of meeting Schillingschen, munching uncooked corn
  he had in a little bag, hiding and running at intervals for a day and a night
  until he chanced on us. For an old man almost sick with fear he was
  astonishingly little affected by the adventure.</p>

  <p>We took longer over the course than he had done, because he wanted to find
  cannibals, and teach them, maybe, a needed lesson. Fred's theory was that we
  should surprise them and pen them into a cavern, discovering some means of
  talking with them when hunger brought them out to surrender and cringe.</p>

  <p>So we threw out a line of scouts, and pounced on cave-mouths suddenly,
  entering great tunnels and following the course of them in ages-old lava
  until sometimes we thought ourselves lost in the gloom and spent hours
  finding the way out again.</p>

  <p>Time and again we found bones&mdash;bones of wild animals, and of birds,
  and of fish; now and then bones that perhaps had been monkeys, but that
  looked too suspiciously like those of the fat babies mothers mourned for in
  the villages below for the benefit of the doubt to be conceded without
  something more or less resembling proof. But never a human being did we see
  until we rounded the northeastern hump of the mountain in a bitter wind, and
  spied half a hundred naked men and women, thinner than wraiths, who scampered
  off at sight of us and volleyed ridiculous arrows from a cave-mouth. The
  arrows fell about midway between us and them, but threw Hassan into a
  paroxysm of fear, out of which it was difficult to shake him.</p>

  <p>"Those are the people who ate my men! That is the cavern where Tippoo Tib
  hid the ivory! That is where my men's bones are! See&mdash;they have torn my
  tent for clothing for their naked women!"</p>

  <p>We put Hassan under double guard for fear lest he bolt again and leave us.
  And all that day, and all the next we hunted for cannibals through mazy
  caverns that seemed to extend into the mountain's very womb. There were times
  when the stench was so horrible we nearly fainted. We stumbled on men's
  bones. We collided with sharp projections in the gloom&mdash;fell down holes
  that might have been bottomless for aught we knew in advance&mdash; and
  scrambled over ledges that in places were smooth with the wear of feet for
  ages. Everlastingly to right, or left of us, or up above, or down below we
  could hear the inhabitants scampering away. Now and then an arrow would
  flitter between us; but their supply of ammunition seemed very scanty.</p>

  <p>At night we camped in the cavern mouth to cut off all escape, and resumed
  the hunt at dawn. But the caverns were hot&mdash;hotter by contrast with the
  biting winds outside; and when in the afternoon of the second day we all came
  out to breathe and cool off the running sweat, we saw the whole tribe
  &mdash;scarcely more than fifty of them&mdash;emerge from an opening above,
  whose existence we had not guessed, and go scampering away along a ledge like
  monkeys. Some of them stopped to throw stones at us&mdash; impotent, aimless
  stones that fell half-way; and Fred sent three bullets after them, chipping
  bits from the ledge, after which they showed us a turn of speed that was
  simply incredible, and vanished.</p>

  <p>"Now for the great disillusionment!" laughed Will. "Hassan! Go forward,
  and show us where that hoard of ivory ought to be!"</p>

  <p>We all expected disillusionment. Brown, who was under no delusion as to
  his share in the venture, scoffed openly at the idea of finding anything
  buried, in a land where every living "crittur," as he put it, was a thief
  from birth. But Hassan led on in, fearless now that the cannibals were gone,
  and positive as if he led into his own house and would show his house-hold
  treasures.</p>

  <p>He stopped before a black-mouthed chasm, two or three hundred yards along
  the smallest subdivision of the cavern, and called for lights and a rope. We
  lit lanterns, and he showed us men's bones lying everywhere in grisly
  confusion.</p>

  <p>"Tippoo Tib his men!" he remarked. "They throwing ivory in here, then By-
  um-by men who eat men kill and eat them. I alone living to tell! Plenty men
  who eat men in those days&mdash;all mountains full of them!"</p>

  <p>He tied a lantern to a rope and lowered it down what looked like an old
  vent-hole in the lava. But the little light was lost in the enormous
  blackness, and we could see nothing.</p>

  <p>"Send a man down!" he counseled.</p>

  <p>We leaned over the edge and sniffed. There was a faint smell of what might
  be sulfur, but not enough to hurt.</p>

  <p>"Who'll go?" asked Monty, and I thought he was going to volunteer
  himself.</p>

  <p>"I go down!" announced Kazimoto cheerfully, and promptly proceeded to
  divest himself of every stitch of clothing.</p>

  <p>We made our stoutest line fast under his arm-pits, gave him a lantern and
  lowered him over the edge. For fifty or sixty feet he descended steadily,
  swinging the lantern and walking downward, held almost horizontally by the
  slowly paid-out rope. Then he stopped, and we heard him whistling.</p>

  <p>"What do you see?" we called down.</p>

  <p>"Pembe!"*</p>

  <p>"Much of it?"</p>

  <p>"Tele!* Oh, tele, tele! Tele, tele, tele, TELE!"</p>

  <p>His voice ended with the very high-pitched note that natives use when they
  want to multiply superlatives. Then he whistled again. Next he called very
  excitedly.</p>

  <p>"Very bad smell here, bwana! Pull me out quickly!"</p>

  <p class="poem">The dry death-rattle of the streets<br>
  Asserts a joyless goal&mdash;<br>
  Re-echoed clang where traffic meets,<br>
  And drab monotony repeats<br>
  The hour-encumbered role.<br>
  Tinsel and glare, twin tawdry shams<br>
  Outshine the evening star<br>
  Where puppet-show and printed lie,<br>
  Victim and trapper and trap, deny<br>
  Old truths that always are.<br>
  So fare ye, fare ye well, old roofs!<br>
  The siren warns the shore,<br>
  The flowing tide sings overside<br>
  Of far-off beaches where abide<br>
  The joys ye know no more!<br>
  The salt sea spray shall kiss our lips&mdash;<br>
  Kiss clean from the fumes that were,<br>
  And gulls shall herald waking days<br>
  With news of far-seen water-ways<br>
  All warm, and passing fair.<br>
  They've cast the shore-lines loose at last<br>
  And coiled the wet hemp down&mdash;<br>
  Cut picket-ropes of Kedar's tents,<br>
  Of time-clock task and square-foot rents!<br>
  Good luck to you, old town!<br>
  Oh, Africa is calling back<br>
  Alluringly and low<br>
  And few they be who hear the voice,<br>
  But they obey&mdash;Lot's wife's the choice,<br>
  And we must surely go!<br>
  So fare ye, fare ye well, old roofs!<br>
  The stars and clouds and trees<br>
  In place of you! The heaped thorn fire&mdash;<br>
  Delight for the town's two-edged desire&mdash;<br>
  For thrice-breathed breath the breeze!<br>
  For rumble of wheels the lion's roar,<br>
  Glad green for trodden brown<br>
  For potted plant and measured lawn<br>
  The view of the velvet veldt at dawn!<br>
  Good-bye to you, old town!<br>

  &mdash;<i>L'Envoi</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">IF all is well that ends well, and only that is well, then
  this story fails at the finish, for we never caught the cannibals, so never
  taught them the lesson in housekeeping and economics that they needed. But
  there is no other shortcoming to record.</p>

  <p>It is no business of any one's what terms we made in the end with the
  Protectorate Government; but thanks to Monty's tact and influence, and to
  their sense of fair play, we were treated generously. And if, when the world
  war at last broke out and the Germans undertook to put in practise the
  treachery they had so long planned, there was a secret fund of hugely welcome
  money at the disposal of the out-numbered defenders of British East, its
  source will no doubt be accounted for, as well as its expenditures, to the
  proper people, by the proper people, at the proper time and place.</p>

  <p>But those who are curious, and are adept at unraveling statistics might
  learn more than a little by studying the export figures relating to ivory
  during the years that preceded the war. They say statistics never lie; but
  those who write them now and then do, and it may be that camouflage was
  understood and went by another name before the great war made the art
  notorious and popular.</p>

  <p>Some of the ivory in that huge hole was ruined by the heat that still
  lives in Elgon's womb. Some of it was splintered by the fall when yoked
  slaves tossed it in. Rats had gnawed some of it, to get at the soft sweet
  core.</p>

  <p>But the men who keep the keys of the bursting ivory vaults by London docks
  could tell how much of it was good, and what huge stores of it reached them.
  For some strange reason they are not a very talkative breed of men.</p>

  <p>We did not haul the ivory out ourselves. That would have been too public a
  proceeding. But any one who attempted during the years that followed nineteen
  hundred to make a trip to Elgon can truthfully inform whoever cares to know,
  how jealously and wakefully the Protectorate Government guarded those lonely
  trails. And there are folk who saw the hundred-man safaris that came down
  from that way every week or so, carrying old ivory, said to be acquired in
  the way of trade. But that is really all government business, and looks
  impertinent in print.</p>

  <p>We did not make enough money to establish Monty in the homes of his
  ancestors at Montdidier Towers and Kirkudbrightshire Castle; for that would
  have been an unbelievable amount; it takes more than mere affluence to keep
  up an earldom in the proper style. But we all got rich.</p>

  <p>Brown received his cattle back after a long wait, as well as a present of
  money that set him up handsomely for life. And certain dissatisfied Masai
  were fined so many cows and sheep for raiding across the border that they
  talked of migrating out of spite to German East&mdash;but did not do it.</p>

  <p>A youthful red-headed assistant district superintendent of police was
  unaccountably alert enough to round up and bring into court more than a dozen
  natives who had preached sedition. And, being lucky enough to secure
  convictions in every case, he was promoted. The last I heard of him he was
  fighting in the very heart of German East in command of a whole brigade. So
  it is advantageous sometimes to do favors for stray noblemen, provided you
  are clever enough, and man enough to make good when the favors are
  repaid.</p>

  <p>And while on the subject of favors, the four homesick islanders who had
  lent us their canoes and came with us all that journey, were sent back to
  their island followed by a launch towing two barges full of corn&mdash; free,
  gratis, and for nothing&mdash;"burre tu," as the natives say, meaning that
  the English are certainly crazy and giving away food without a pull-back to
  it simply and solely because "the people" have too much nja. Nja is the
  nastiest word in all those languages. It means the one thing everybody dreads
  &mdash;the thing that only the English seem to know charms against&mdash;
  want&mdash;emptiness&mdash;HUNGER.</p>

  <p>At our expense, but by the favor of the government, there went to that
  island food enough in boxes and strong sacks&mdash;and seeds, treated against
  insects&mdash;and tools with which the wives could chop the soil up (for you
  can't expect the owner of a wife to work) to keep that island and its
  friendly folk from hunger for many a day.</p>
