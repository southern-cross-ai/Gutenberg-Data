  <h2><a name="letter01"
     id="letter01">LETTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT is with difficulty that I persuade myself, that it is I
who am sitting
  and writing to you from this great city of the East. Whether I look upon the
  face of nature, or the works of man, I see every thing different from what
  the West presents; so widely different, that it seems to me, at times, as if
  I were subject to the power of a dream. But I rouse myself, and find that I
  am awake, and that it is really I, your old friend and neighbor, Piso, late a
  dweller upon the Coelian hill, who am now basking in the warm skies of
  Palmyra, and, notwithstanding all the splendor and luxury by which I am
  surrounded, longing to be once more in Rome, by the side of my Curtius, and
  with him discoursing, as we have been wont to do, of the acts and policy of
  the magnificent Aurelian.</p>

  <p>But to the purpose of this letter, which is, in agreement with my promise,
  to tell you of my fortunes since I parted from you, and of my good or ill
  success, as it may be, in the prosecution of that affair which has driven me
  so far from my beloved Rome. O, Humanity! why art thou so afflicted? Why have
  the immortal gods made the cup of life so bitter? And why am I singled out to
  partake of one that seems all bitter? My feelings sometimes overmaster my
  philosophy. You can forgive this, who know my sorrows. Still I am delaying to
  inform you concerning my journey and my arrival. Now I will begin.</p>

  <p>As soon as I had lost sight of you weeping on the quay, holding in your
  hand the little Gallus, and of the dear Lucilia leaning on your arm, and
  could no longer, even by mounting upon the highest part of the vessel,
  discern the waving of your hands, nor cause you to see the fervor with which
  I returned the sign of friendship, I at once left off thinking of you, as far
  as I could, and to divert my thoughts, began to examine, as if I had never
  seen them before, the banks of the yellow Tiber. At first the crowds of
  shipping, of every form and from every part of the world, distracted the
  sight, and compelled me to observe what was immediately around me. The cries
  of the sailors, as they were engaged in managing different parts of their
  vessels, or as they called out in violent and abusive terms to those who
  passed them, or as their several galleys struck against each other in their
  attempts to go up or down the river, together with the frequent roarings and
  bellowings of whole cargoes of wild beasts from the deserts of Asia and
  Africa destined to the amphitheatre, intermingled with the jargon of an
  hundred different barbarian languages from the thousands who thronged the
  decks of this fleet of all nations,&mdash;these sights and sounds at first
  wholly absorbed me, and for a moment shut all the world besides&mdash;even
  you&mdash;out of my mind. It was a strange yet inspiring scene, and gave me
  greater thoughts than ever of the power and majesty of Rome. Here were men
  and ships that had traversed oceans and continents to bring the offerings of
  their toil, and lay them at the feet of the mistress of the world. And over
  all this bustle, created by the busy spirit of commerce, a splendor and
  gayety were thrown by numerous triremes and boats of pleasure, which,
  glittering under the light of a summer's morning sun, were just setting out
  upon some excursion of pleasure, with streamers floating from the slender
  masts, music swelling up from innumerable performers, and shouts of merry
  laughter from crowds of the rich and noble youths of the city, who reclined
  upon the decks, beneath canopies of the richest dyes. As these Cleopatra
  barges floated along with their soft burden, torrents of vituperative epithet
  were poured upon them by the rough children of Neptune, which was received
  with an easy indifference, or returned with no lack of ability in that sort
  of warfare, according to the temper or breeding of the parties.</p>

  <p>When the novelty of this scene was worn out, for though often seen it is
  ever new, and we had fallen a few miles below the city, to where the eye
  first meets the smiling face of the country, I looked eagerly around, first
  upon one, and then upon the other bank of the river, in search of the villas
  of our fortunate citizens, waiting impatiently till the well-known turn of
  the stream should bring me before yours, where, with our mutual friends, we
  have passed so many happy days. It was not long before I was gratified. Our
  vessel gracefully doubled the projecting point, blackened with that thick
  grove of pine, and your hospitable dwelling greeted my eyes; now, alas!
  again, by that loved and familiar object, made to overflow with tears. I was
  obliged, by one manly effort, to leap clear of the power of all-subduing
  love, for my sensibilities were drawing upon me the observation of my
  fellow-passengers. I therefore withdrew from the side of the vessel where I
  had been standing, and moving to that part of it which would best protect me
  from what, but now, I had so eagerly sought, sat down and occupied myself in
  watching the movements and the figures of the persons whom chance had thrown
  into my company, and with whom I was now, for so many days, to be shut up in
  the narrow compass of our merchant- barque. I had sat but a little while,
  when the master of the ship, passing by me, stopped, and asked if it was I
  who was to land at Utica&mdash;for that one, or more than one, he believed,
  had spoken for a passage only to that port.</p>

  <p>'No, truly,'I replied; and added: 'Do you, then, cross over to
  Utica?&mdash;that seems to me far from a direct course for those bound to
  Syria.'</p>

  <p>'Better round-about,' rejoined he, in his rough way, 'than risk Scylla and
  Charybdis; and so would you judge, were the bowels of my good ship stored
  with your wealth, as they are, it may be, with that of some of your friends.
  The Roman merchant likes not that narrow strait, fatal to so many, but
  prefers the open sea, though the voyage be longer. But with this
  wind&mdash;once out of this foul Tiber&mdash;and we shall soon see the white
  shores of Africa. Truly, what a medley we seem to have on board! Jews,
  Romans, Syrians, Greeks, soldiers, adventurers, merchants, pedlers, and, if I
  miss not, Christians too; and you, if I miss not again, the only patrician. I
  marvel at your taking ship with so spotted a company, when there are these
  gay passenger-boats, sacred to the trim persons of the capital, admitting
  even not so much as a case of jewels besides.'</p>

  <p>'Doubtless it would have been better on some accounts,'I replied, 'but my
  business was urgent, and I could not wait for the sailing of the
  packet-boats; and besides, I am not unwilling to adventure where I shall mix
  with a greater variety of my own species, and gain a better knowledge of
  myself by the study of others. In this object I am not likely to be
  disappointed, for you furnish me with diverse samples, which I can
  contemplate at my leisure.'</p>

  <p>'If one studied so as to know well the properties of fishes or animals,'
  rejoined he, in a sneering tone, 'it would be profitable, for fishes can be
  eaten, and animals can be used: but man! I know little that he is good for,
  but to bury, and so fatten the soil. Emperors, as being highest, should be
  best, and yet, what are they? Whether they have been fools or madmen, the
  Tiber has still run blood, and the air been poisoned by the rotting carcasses
  of their victims. Claudius was a good man, I grant; but the gods, I believe,
  envied us our felicity, and so took him.'</p>

  <p>'I trust,' said I, 'that the present auspices will not deceive us, and
  that the happiness begun under that almost divine ruler, will be completed
  under him whom he designated as most worthy of the sceptre of the world, and
  whose reign&mdash;certainly we may say it&mdash;has commenced so
  prosperously. I think better of man than you do, and I cannot but believe
  that there will yet rise up among us those who shall feel what power, almost
  of a god, is lodged in the will of a Roman emperor, and will use it like a
  god to bless, not curse mankind. Why may not Nature repeat the virtuous
  Antonines! Her power is not spent. For myself, I have faith that Aurelian
  will restore not so much the greatness, as the peace and happiness of the
  empire.'</p>

  <p>'So have not I,' cried the master of the ship: 'is he not sprung from the
  loins of a peasant? Has not the camp been his home? Was not a shield his
  cradle? Such power as his will craze him. Born to it, and the chance were
  better. Mark a sailor's word: he will sooner play the part of Maximin, than
  that of Antonine or Severus, or of our late good Claudius. When he feels easy
  in the saddle, we shall see what he will do. So far, the blood of barbarians,
  slain in battle, has satisfied him: when once in Rome, that of citizens will
  be sweeter. But may the gods befriend us!'</p>

  <p>At this point of our discourse, we were interrupted by loud vociferations
  from the forward part of the vessel, where I had long observed a crowd of the
  passengers, who seemed engaged in some earnest conversation. The tones now
  became sharp and angry, and the group suddenly dispersed, separating this way
  and that, as the hoarse and commanding voice of the master of the ship
  reached them, calling upon them to observe the rules of the vessel, which
  allowed of no riot or quarrelling. Toward me there moved one whom I hardly
  know how to describe, and yet feel that I must. You will here doubtless
  exclaim, 'Why obliged to describe? Why say so much of accidental companions?'
  But you will answer yourself, I feel persuaded, my Curtius, by supposing that
  I should not particularly notice a mere companion of the voyage, unless he
  had connected himself in some manner with my fortunes. Such has been the case
  with this person, and one other whom I will shortly introduce to you. As I
  was saying, then, when that group dispersed, one of its number moved toward
  me, and seated himself at my side. He was evidently a Roman and a citizen.
  His features were of no other nation. But with all the dignity that
  characterized him as a Roman, there were mixed a sweetness and a mildness,
  such as I do not remember to have seen in another. And in the eye there was a
  melancholy and a deepness, if I may say so, more remarkable still. It was the
  eye of one who was all sorrow, all love, and all purity; in whom the soul had
  undisputed sway over the passions and the senses. I have seen an expression
  which has approached it, in some of our priests, but far below it in power
  and beauty. My first impulse was to address him, but his pallid and
  thoughtful countenance, together with that eye, restrained me, and I know not
  how I should have overcome this strange diffidence, had not the difficulty
  been removed by the intervention of a third party. This was no other than one
  of those travelling Jews, who infest all cities, towns and regions, and dwell
  among all people, yet mix with none. He was bent almost double by the weight
  of large packages of goods, of all descriptions, which he carried, part
  before and part behind him, and which he had not laid aside, in the hope, I
  suppose, of effecting some sales among the passengers.</p>

  <p>'Here's old Isaac the Jew,' cried he, as he approached toward where I sat,
  and then stood before me resting his pannier of articles upon a pile of
  merchandise, which lay there&mdash;'here's old Isaac the Jew, last from Rome,
  but a citizen of the world, now on his way to Carthage and Syria, with all
  sorts of jewelry and ornaments: nothing that a lady wants that's not
  here&mdash;or gentleman either. Most noble Sir, let me press upon you this
  steel mirror, of the most perfect polish: see the setting too; could the
  fancy of it be better? No? You would prefer a ring: look then at this
  assortment&mdash;iron and gold rings&mdash;marriage, seal, and fancy
  rings&mdash;buckles too: have you seen finer? Here too are soaps, perfumes,
  and salves for the toilet&mdash;hair-pins and essences. Perhaps you would
  prefer somewhat a little more useful. I shall show you then these sandals and
  slippers; see what a charming variety&mdash;both in form and color: pretty
  feet alone should press these&mdash;think you not so? But, alas! I cannot
  tempt you.'</p>

  <p>'How is it possible,' said I, 'for another to speak when thy tongue wags
  so fast? Those rings I would gladly have examined, and now that thou hast
  discharged that volley of hoarse sounds, I pray thee open again that case. I
  thank thee for giving me an occupation.'</p>

  <p>'Take care!' replied the voluble Jew, throwing a quick and mischievous
  glance toward the Roman whom I have already mentioned&mdash;'take care how my
  friend here of the new faith hears thee or sees the, an' thou wouldst escape
  a rebuke. He holds my beauties here and my calling in high contempt, and as
  for occupation, he thinks one never need be idle who has himself to converse
  with.'</p>

  <p>'What you have last uttered is true,' replied the person whom he
  addressed: 'he need never want for employment, who possesses the power of
  thought. But as to thy trade, I object not to that, nor to what thou sellest:
  only to being myself a buyer.'</p>

  <p>'Ha! thou wilt not buy? Trust Isaac for that. I keep that which shall suit
  all, and enslave all. I would have made thee buy of me before, but for the
  uproar of those soldiers.'</p>

  <p>While uttering these words, he had placed the case of rings in my hands to
  examine them, and was engaged himself in exploring the depths of a large
  package, from which he at length triumphantly drew forth a parchment
  roll.</p>

  <p>'Now open all thine eyes, Nazarene,' cried the Jew, 'and thou shalt see
  what thou shalt. Look!'</p>

  <p>And so saying, he unfolded the first portion of the roll, upon which the
  eye of the Roman had no sooner fallen, than his face suddenly glowed as if a
  god shone through him, and reverently seizing the book, he exclaimed:</p>

  <p>'I thank thee, Jew; thou hast conquered: I am a customer too. Here is my
  purse&mdash;take what thou wilt.'</p>

  <p>'Hold, hold!' interrupted the Jew, laughing, 'I have not done with thee
  yet; what thou hast bought in Greek, I would now sell thee again in Latin.
  Thy half convert, the soldier Macer, would greet this as a cordial to his
  famishing soul. Take both, and thou hast them cheaper.'</p>

  <p>'Your cunning hardly deserves such a reward,' said the Christian, as I now
  perceived him to be, 'but you have said well, and I not unwillingly obey your
  suggestions. Pay yourself now for both, and give them to me carefully rolled
  up.'</p>

  <p>'No better sale than this shall I make to-day, and that too to a Jew-
  hating Nazarene. But what matters it whom I tax for the upholding of
  Jerusalem? Surely it is sweeter, when the cruel Roman or the heretic
  Christian is made unconsciously to build at her walls.'</p>

  <p>Thus muttered the Jew to himself, as he skilfully bound into a parcel the
  Christian's books.</p>

  <p>'And now, most excellent Sir,' said he, turning toward me, 'what do you
  find worthy your own or your lady's finger? Here is another
  case&mdash;perhaps these may strike you as rarer for their devices, or their
  workmanship. But they are rather better suited to the tastes of the rich
  Palmyrenes, to whom I am bearing them.'</p>

  <p>'Ah!'I exclaimed, 'these are what I want. This seal ring, with the head of
  Zenobia, for which I sought in vain in Rome, I will buy, nor care for its
  cost, if thou canst assure me of its resemblance to the great Queen. Who was
  the artist?'</p>

  <p>'As I stand here, a true son of Abraham,' he replied, 'it was worked by a
  Greek jeweller, who lives hard by the Temple of Fortune, and who has engraved
  it after a drawing made by a brother, an inhabitant of Palmyra. Two such
  artists in their way are not to be found. I myself, moreover, bore the
  original drawing from Demetrius to his brother in Rome, and that it is like
  the great Queen, I can well testify, for I have often seen her. Her
  marvellous beauty is here well expressed, or as well as that which partakes
  so much more of heaven than of earth can be. But look at these, too! Here I
  have what I look to do well with. See! heads of Odenatus! Think you not they
  will take well? These also are done with the same care as the others, and by
  the same workmen. Nothing of the kind has as yet been seen in Palmyra, nor
  indeed in Rome. Happy Isaac!&mdash;thy fortune is made! Come, put them on thy
  finger, and observe their beauty. King and Queen&mdash;how lovingly they sit
  there together! 'Twas just so when Odenatus was alive. They were a noble and
  a loving pair. The Queen yet weeps for him.'</p>

  <p>'Jew,' said I, 'on thy word I purchase these. Although thy name is in no
  good repute, yet thy face is honest, and I will trust thee so far.'</p>

  <p>'The name of the unfortunate and the weak is never in repute,' said Isaac,
  as he took my money and folded up the rings, his whole manner suddenly
  changing. 'The Jew is now but a worm, writhing under the heel of the proud
  Roman. Many a time has he, however, as thou well knowest, turned upon his
  destroyer, and tasted the sweetness of a brief revenge. Why should I speak of
  the massacres of Egypt, Cyrene, and Syria in the days of Trajan? Let Rome
  beware! Small though we seem, the day will yet arrive when the glory of Zion
  shall fill the whole earth&mdash;and He shall come, before whom the mighty
  Emperor of Rome shall tremble in his palaces.&mdash;This is what I say.
  Thanks to the great Aurelian, that even a poor son of Abraham may speak his
  mind and not lose his head. Here's old Isaac: who'll buy of old
  Isaac&mdash;rings&mdash;pins&mdash;and razors,&mdash;who'll buy?'</p>

  <p>And so singing, he turned away, and mixed with the passengers in the other
  parts of the vessel. The wild glare of his eye, and deep, suppressed tone of
  his voice, as he spoke of the condition and hopes of his tribe, startled and
  moved me, and I would willingly have prolonged a conversation with one of
  that singular people, about whom I really know nothing, and with none of whom
  had I ever before come in contact. When I see you again, I shall have much to
  tell you of him; for during the rest of the voyage we were often thrown
  together, and, as you will learn, he has become of essential service to me in
  the prosecution of my objects.</p>

  <p>No sooner had Isaac withdrawn from our company, than I embraced the
  opportunity to address myself to the remarkable-looking person whom I have
  already in part described.</p>

  <p>'It is a great testimony,'I said, turning toward him, 'which these Jews
  bear to their national religion. I much doubt if Romans, under similar
  circumstances of oppression, would exhibit a constancy like theirs. Their
  attachment too is to an invisible religion, as one may say, which makes it
  the more remarkable. They have neither temples, altars, victims, nor statues,
  nor any form of god or goddess, to which they pay real or feigned adoration.
  Toward us they bear deep and inextinguishable hate, for our religion not less
  than for our oppressions. I never see a Jew threading our streets with busy
  steps, and his dark, piercing eye, but I seem to see an assassin, who, with
  Caligula, wishes the Roman people had but one neck, that he might exterminate
  the whole race with a single blow. Toward you, however, who are so nearly of
  his own faith, I suppose his sentiments are more kindly. The Christian Roman,
  perhaps, he would spare.'</p>

  <p>'Not so, I greatly fear,' replied the Christian. 'Nay, the Jew bears a
  deeper hatred toward us than toward you, and would sooner sacrifice us; for
  the reason, doubtless, that we are nearer him in faith than you; just as our
  successful emperors have no sooner found themselves securely seated, than
  they have first turned upon the members of their own family, that from this,
  the most dangerous quarter, there should be no fear of rival or usurper. The
  Jew holds the Christian&mdash;though in some sort believing with him&mdash;as
  a rival&mdash;a usurper&mdash;a rebel; as one who would substitute a novelty
  for the ancient creed of his people, and, in a word, bring ruin upon the very
  existence of his tribe. His suspicions, truly, are not without foundation;
  but they do not excuse the temper with which he regards us. I cast no
  imputation upon the virtues of friend Isaac, in what I say. The very spirit
  of universal love, I believe, reigns in his soul. Would that all of his race
  were like him.'</p>

  <p>'What you say is new and strange,'I replied. 'I may possibly bring shame
  upon myself, by saying so, but it is true. I have been accustomed to regard
  Christians and Jews as in effect one people; one, I mean, in opinion and
  feeling. But in truth I know nothing. You are not ignorant of the prejudice
  which exists toward both these races, on the part of the Romans. I have
  yielded, with multitudes around me, to prevailing ideas, taking no steps to
  learn their truth or error. Our writers, from Tacitus to the base
  tools&mdash;for such they must have been&mdash;who lent themselves to the
  purposes of the bigot Macrianus, and who filled the city with their accounts
  of the Christians, have all agreed in representing your faith as a dark and
  mischievous superstition. I have, indeed, been struck with the circumstance,
  that while the Jews make no converts from among us, great numbers are
  reported to have joined the Christians; and of those, not a few of the higher
  orders. The late Emperor Philip, I think it clear, was a Christian. This
  might have taught me that there is a wide difference between the Christian
  and the Jew. But the general hatred toward both the one and the other,
  together with the persecutions to which they have been exposed, have made me
  more than indifferent to their merits,'</p>

  <p>'I trust the time will come,' replied the Christian, 'when our cause will
  be examined on the ground of its merits. Why may we not believe that it has
  now come? The Roman world is at peace. A strong and generous prince is upon
  the throne. Mild and just laws restrain the furious bigotry of an ignorant
  and sanguinary priesthood. Men of intelligence and virtue adorn our
  profession, from whom those who are anxious to know the truth can hear it;
  and copies of our sacred books both in Greek and Latin abound, whence may
  easily be learned the true principles of our faith, and the light of whose
  holy pages would instantly dispel the darkness by which the minds of many,
  even of the virtuous and well-disposed, are oppressed. It is hardly likely
  that a fitter opportunity will soon offer for an examination of the claims of
  Christianity. We have nothing to dread but the deadness and indifference of
  the public mind. It is not credible that polytheism should stand a day upon
  any fair comparison of it with the religion of Christ. You yourself are not a
  believer (pardon my boldness) in the ineffable stupidities of the common
  religion. To suppose you were&mdash;I see by the expression of your
  countenance&mdash;would be the unpardonable offence. I sincerely believe,
  that nothing more is wanting to change you, and every intelligent Roman, from
  professed supporters of the common religion, (but real infidels,) into warm
  believers and advocates of the doctrine of Christ&mdash;but simply
  this&mdash;to read his sayings, and the delineation of his character, as they
  have been written down by some of his followers. You are, I see, incredulous,
  but not more so than I was myself only a year ago; yet you behold me a
  Christian. I had to contend against, perhaps, far more adverse influences
  than would oppose you. You start with surprise that I should give evidence
  that I know you; but I have many a time seen you at the shop of Publius, and
  have heard you in your addresses to the people.</p>

  <p>'I am the son of a priest of the Temple of Jupiter&mdash;of a man, who, to
  a mildness and gentleness of soul that would do honor to the Christian, added
  a faith in the religion of his fathers, deep-struck and firm-rooted as the
  rocks of ocean. I was his assistant in the duties of his office. My childish
  faith was all he could wish it; I reverenced a religion which had nurtured
  virtues like his. In process of time, I became myself a father. Four
  children, more beautiful than ever visited the dreams of Phidias, made my
  dwelling a portion of Elysium, as I then thought. Their mother&mdash;but why
  should I speak of her? It is enough to say, she was a Roman mother. At home,
  it was my supreme happiness to sport with my little ones, or initiate them
  into the elements of useful knowledge. And often, when at the temple
  preparing for the days of ceremony, my children were with me; and my labors
  were nothing, cheered by the music of their feet running upon the marble
  pavements, and of their merry voices echoing among the columns and arches of
  the vast interior. O days thrice happy! They were too happy to last. Within
  the space of one year&mdash;one cruel year&mdash;these four living idols were
  ravished from my arms by a prevailing disease. My wife, broken-hearted, soon
  followed them, and I was left alone. I need not describe my grief: I will
  only say, that with bitter imprecations I cursed the gods. 'Who are ye,'I
  cried, 'who sit above in your secure seats, and make your sport of human wo?
  Ye are less than men. Man though I am, I would not inflict upon the meanest
  slave the misery ye have poured upon my defenceless head. Where are your
  mercies?'I was frantic. How long this lasted I cannot tell, for I took no
  note of time. I was awakened, may I not say saved, by a kind neighbor whom I
  had long known to be a Christian. He was a witness of my sufferings, and with
  deep compassion ministered to my necessities. 'Probus,' said he, 'I know your
  sorrows, and I know your wants. I have perceived that neither your own
  thoughts, nor all the philosophy of your venerable father, have brought you
  peace. It's not surprising: ye are but men, and ye have but the power and the
  wisdom of men. It is aid from the Divinity that you want. I will not
  discourse with you; but I leave with you this book, which I simply ask you to
  read.'I read it&mdash;and read it&mdash;again and again; and I am a
  Christian. As the Christian grew up within me, my pains were soothed, and
  days, once days of tears and unavailing complaints, are now days of calm and
  cheerful duty: I am a new man.'</p>

  <p>I cannot describe to you, my Curtius, the effect of this little narrative
  upon myself, or upon those who, as he spoke, had gathered round, especially
  those hard-featured soldiers. Tears flowed down their weather-beaten faces,
  and one of them&mdash;Macer, as I afterward learned&mdash;cried out: 'Where
  now are the gods of Rome?' Probus started from his seat, apparently for the
  first time conscious of any other listener beside myself, and joined the
  master of the vessel at the helm. I resigned myself to meditation; and that
  night fell asleep, thinking of the Christian and his book.</p>

  <p>Leaving now Ostia and its fleet, greater even than that of the Tiber, five
  days brought us in sight of the African shore, but quite to the west of
  Utica. So, coasting along, we presently came off against Hippo, and then
  doubling a promontory, both Utica and Carthage were at once
  visible&mdash;Utica nearer, Carthage just discernible in the distance. All
  was now noise and bustle, as we rapidly drew near the port. Many of our
  passengers were to land here, and they were busily employed, with the aid of
  the sailors, in collecting their merchandise or their baggage. The soldiers
  destined to the African service here left us, together with the Jew Isaac and
  the Christian Probus. I was sorry to lose them, as beside them there was not
  one on board, except the governor of the ship, from whose company or
  conversation I could derive either pleasure or knowledge. They are both,
  however, destined to Palmyra, and I shall soon expect them to join me here.
  You smile at my speaking thus of a travelling Jew and a despised Christian,
  but in the issue you will acknowledge your as well as my obligations to them
  both. I confess myself attached to them. As the Jew turned to bid me
  farewell, before he sprang on shore, he said:</p>

  <p>'Most noble Piso, if thou forsakest the gods of Rome, let it be for the
  synagogue of the children of Abraham, whose faith is not of yesterday. Be not
  beguiled by the specious tongue of that heretic Probus. I can tell thee a
  better story than his.'</p>

  <p>'Fear not, honest Isaac,'I cried; 'I am not yet so weary of the faith of
  my ancestors. That cannot be altogether despicable, which has had power to
  bind in one mass the whole Roman people for so many ages I shall be no easy
  convert to either you or Probus. Farewell, to meet in Tadmor.'</p>

  <p>Probus now passed me, and said: 'If I should not see you in the Eastern
  capital, according to my purpose, I trust I shall in Rome. My dwelling is in
  the Livian way not far from the Pantheon, opposite the well-known house of
  Vitruvius, still so called; or, at the shop of the learned Publius, I may be
  seen every morning, and may there be always heard of.'</p>

  <p>I assured him, that no affairs could be so pressing, after I should return
  to Rome, as not to allow me to seek him, but that I hoped the fates would not
  interpose to deprive me of the pleasure of first seeing him in Palmyra.</p>

  <p>So we parted. And very soon after, the merchandise and passengers being
  all landed, we set sail again, and stood out to sea. I regretted that we were
  not to touch at Carthage, as my desire had always been strong to see that
  famous place. An adverse wind, however, setting in from the North, drove us
  farther toward the city than the pilot intended to have gone, and I thus
  obtained quite a satisfactory glimpse of the African capital. I was surprised
  at the indications of its vastness and grandeur. Since its attempted
  restoration by Augustus, it has advanced steadily to almost its former
  populousness and magnificence. Nothing could be more imposing and beautiful,
  than its long lines of buildings, its towers, walls, palaces, and columns,
  seen through the warm and rosy mist of an African sky. I could hardly believe
  that I was looking but upon a provincial city, a dependant upon almighty
  Rome. It soon sank below the horizon, as its glory had sunk once before.</p>

  <p>I will not detain you long with our voyage, but will only mark out its
  course. Leaving the African shore, we struck across to Sicily, and coasting
  along its eastern border, beheld with pleasure the towering form of Aetna,
  sending up into the heavens a dull and sluggish cloud of vapors. We then ran
  between the Peloponnesus and Crete, and so held our course till the Island of
  Cyprus rose like her own fair goddess from the ocean, and filled our eyes
  with a beautiful vision of hill and valley, wooded promontory, and glittering
  towns and villas. A fair wind soon withdrew us from these charming prospects,
  and after driving us swiftly and roughly over the remainder of our way,
  rewarded us with a brighter and more welcome vision still&mdash;the coast of
  Syria and our destined port, Berytus.</p>

  <p>As far as the eye could reach, both toward the North and the South, we
  beheld a luxuriant region, crowded with villages, and giving every indication
  of comfort and wealth. The city itself, which we rapidly approached, was of
  inferior size, but presented an agreeable prospect of warehouses, public and
  private edifices, overtopped here and there by the lofty palm, and other
  trees of a new and peculiar foliage. Four days were consumed here in the
  purchase of slaves, camels, and horses, and in other preparations for the
  journey across the Desert. Two routes presented themselves, one more, the
  other less direct; the last, though more circuitous, appeared to me the more
  desirable, as it would take me within sight of the modern glories and ancient
  remains of Heliopolis. This, therefore, was determined upon; and on the
  morning of the fifth day we set forward upon our long march. Four slaves, two
  camels, and three horses, with an Arab conductor, constituted our little
  caravan; but for greater safety we attached ourselves to a much larger one
  than our own, in which we were swallowed up and lost, consisting of
  travellers and traders, from all parts of the world, and who were also on
  their way to Palmyra, as a point whence to separate to various parts of the
  vast East. It would delight me to lay before you with the distinctness and
  minuteness of a picture, the whole of this novel, and to me most interesting
  route; but I must content myself with a slight sketch, and reserve fuller
  communications to the time when, once more seated with you upon the Coelian,
  we enjoy the freedom of social converse.</p>

  <p>Our way through the valleys of Libanus, was like one long wandering among
  the pleasure grounds of opulent citizens. The land was every where richly
  cultivated, and a happier peasantry, as far as the eye of the traveller could
  judge, nowhere exists. The most luxuriant valleys of our own Italy are not
  more crowded with the evidences of plenty and contentment. Upon drawing near
  to the ancient Baalbec, I found on inquiry of our guide, that we were not to
  pass through it, as I had hoped, nor even very near it, not nearer than
  between two and three miles. So that in this I had been clearly deceived by
  those of whom I had made the most exact inquiries at Berytus. I thought I
  discovered great command of myself, in that I did not break the head of my
  Arab, who doubtless, to answer purposes of his own, had brought me thus out
  of my way for nothing. The event proved, however, that it was not for
  nothing; for soon after we had started on our journey, on the morning of the
  second day, turning suddenly round the projecting rock of a mountain ridge,
  we all at once beheld, as if a veil had been lifted up, Heliopolis and its
  suburbs, spread out before us in all their various beauty. The city lay about
  three miles distant. I could only, therefore, identify its principal
  structure, the Temple of the Sun, as built by the first Antonine. This
  towered above the walls, and over all the other buildings, and gave vast
  ideas of the greatness of the place, leading the mind to crowd it with other
  edifices that should bear some proportion to this noble monument of imperial
  magnificence. As suddenly as the view of this imposing scene had been
  revealed, so suddenly was it again eclipsed, by another short turn in the
  road, which took us once more into the mountain valleys. But the overhanging
  and impenetrable foliage of a Syrian forest, shielding me from the fierce
  rays of a burning sun, soon reconciled me to my loss&mdash;more especially as
  I knew that in a short time we were to enter upon the sandy desert, which
  stretches from the Anti-Libanus almost to the very walls of Palmyra.</p>

  <p>Upon this boundless desert we now soon entered. The scene which it
  presented was more dismal than I can describe. A red moving sand&mdash;or
  hard and baked by the heat of a sun such as Rome never knows&mdash;low gray
  rocks just rising here and there above the level of the plain, with now and
  then the dead and glittering trunk of a vast cedar, whose roots seemed as if
  they had outlasted centuries&mdash;the bones of camels and elephants,
  scattered on either hand, dazzling the sight by reason of their excessive
  whiteness&mdash;at a distance occasionally an Arab of the desert, for a
  moment surveying our long line, and then darting off to his
  fastnesses&mdash;these were the objects which, with scarce any variation, met
  our eyes during the four wearisome days that we dragged ourselves over this
  wild and inhospitable region. A little after the noon of the fourth day, as
  we started on our way, having refreshed ourselves and our exhausted animals
  at a spring which here poured out its warm but still grateful waters to the
  traveller, my ears received the agreeable news that toward the east there
  could now be discerned the dark line, which indicated our approach to the
  verdant tract that encompasses the great city. Our own excited spirits were
  quickly imparted to our beasts, and a more rapid movement soon revealed into
  distinctness the high land and waving groves of palm trees which mark the
  site of Palmyra.</p>

  <p>It was several miles before we reached the city, that we suddenly found
  ourselves&mdash;landing as it were from a sea upon an island or
  continent&mdash;in a rich and thickly peopled country. The roads indicated an
  approach to a great capital, in the increasing numbers of those who thronged
  them, meeting and passing us, overtaking us, or crossing our way. Elephants,
  camels, and the dromedary, which I had before seen only in the amphitheatres,
  I here beheld as the native inhabitants of the soil. Frequent villas of the
  rich and luxurious Palmyrenes, to which they retreat from the greater heats
  of the city, now threw a lovely charm over the scene. Nothing can exceed the
  splendor of these sumptuous palaces. Italy itself has nothing which surpasses
  them. The new and brilliant costumes of the persons whom we met, together
  with the rich housings of the animals they rode, served greatly to add to all
  this beauty. I was still entranced, as it were, by the objects around me, and
  buried in reflection, when I was roused by the shout of those who led the
  caravan, and who had attained the summit of a little rising ground, saying,
  'Palmyra! Palmyra!'I urged forward my steed, and in a moment the most
  wonderful prospect I ever beheld&mdash;no, I cannot except even
  Rome&mdash;burst upon my sight. Flanked by hills of considerable elevation on
  the East, the city filled the whole plain below as far as the eye could
  reach, both toward the North and toward the South. This immense plain was all
  one vast and boundless city. It seemed to me to be larger than Rome. Yet I
  knew very well that it could not be&mdash;that it was not. And it was some
  time before I understood the true character of the scene before me, so as to
  separate the city from the country, and the country from the city, which here
  wonderfully interpenetrate each other and so confound and deceive the
  observer. For the city proper is so studded with groups of lofty palm trees,
  shooting up among its temples and palaces, and on the other hand, the plain
  in its immediate vicinity is so thickly adorned with magnificent structures
  of the purest marble, that it is not easy, nay it is impossible at the
  distance at which I contemplated the whole, to distinguish the line which
  divided the one from the other. It was all city and all country, all country
  and all city. Those which lay before me I was ready to believe were the
  Elysian Fields. I imagined that I saw under my feet the dwellings of purified
  men and of gods. Certainly they were too glorious for the mere earth- born.
  There was a central point, however, which chiefly fixed my attention, where
  the vast Temple of the Sun stretched upward its thousand columns of polished
  marble to the heavens, in its matchless beauty casting into the shade every
  other work of art of which the world can boast. I have stood before the
  Parthenon, and have almost worshipped that divine achievement of the immortal
  Phidias. But it is a toy by the side of this bright crown of the Eastern
  capital. I have been at Milan, at Ephesus, at Alexandria, at Antioch; but in
  neither of those renowned cities have I beheld any thing that I can allow to
  approach in united extent, grandeur, and most consummate beauty, this almost
  more than work of man. On each side of this, the central point, there rose
  upward slender pyramids&mdash;pointed obelisks&mdash;domes of the most
  graceful proportions, columns, arches and lofty towers, for number and for
  form, beyond my power to describe. These buildings, as well as the walls of
  the city, being all either of white marble, or of some stone as white, and
  being every where in their whole extent interspersed, as I have already said,
  with multitudes of overshadowing palm trees, perfectly filled and satisfied
  my sense of beauty, and made me feel for the moment, as if in such a scene I
  should love to dwell, and there end my days. Nor was I alone in these
  transports of delight. All my fellow-travellers seemed equally affected: and
  from the native Palmyrenes, of whom there were many among us, the most
  impassioned and boastful exclamations broke forth. 'What is Rome to this?'
  they cried: 'Fortune is not constant. Why may not Palmyra be what Rome has
  been&mdash;mistress of the world? Who more fit to rule than the great
  Zenobia? A few years may see great changes. Who can tell what shall come to
  pass?' These, and many such sayings, were uttered by those around me,
  accompanied by many significant gestures and glances of the eye. I thought of
  them afterward. We now descended the hill, and the long line of caravan moved
  on toward the city.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="letter02"
     id="letter02">LETTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I FEAR lest the length of my first letter may have fatigued
you, my
  Curtius, knowing as I so well do, how you esteem brevity. I hope at this time
  not to try your patience. But, however I may weary or vex you by my
  garrulity, I am sure of a patient and indulgent reader in the dear Lucilia,
  to whom I would now first of all commend myself. I salute her, and with her
  the little Gallus. My writing to you is a sufficient proof that I myself am
  well.</p>

  <p>By reason of our delaying so long on that little hill, and at other
  points, for the sake of drinking in full draughts of the unrivalled beauty
  which lay spread over all the scenery within the scope of our vision, we did
  not approach the walls of the city till the last rays of the sun were
  lingering upon the higher buildings of the capital. This rendered every
  object so much the more beautiful; for a flood of golden light, of a richer
  hue, it seemed to me, than our sun ever sheds upon Rome, rolled over the
  city, and plain, and distant mountains, giving to the whole a gorgeousness
  altogether beyond any thing I ever saw before, and agreeing well with all my
  impressions of oriental magnificence. It was soon under the right aspect. Not
  one expectation was disappointed but rather exceeded as we came in sight of
  the vast walls of the city, and of the 'Roman Gate'&mdash;so it is
  called&mdash;through which we were to make our entrance. It was all upon the
  grandest scale. The walls were higher, and more frequently defended by square
  massy towers springing out of them, than those of Rome. The towers, which on
  either side flanked the gateway, and which were connected by an immense arch
  flung from one to the other, were particularly magnificent. No sooner had we
  passed through, than we found ourselves in a street lined as it were with
  palaces. It was of great width&mdash;-we have no street like it in this
  respect&mdash;of an exact level, and stretched onward farther than the eye
  could distinctly reach, being terminated by another gate similar to that by
  which we had entered. The buildings on either side were altogether of marble,
  of Grecian design&mdash;the city is filled with Greek artists of every
  description&mdash;frequently adorned with porticos of the most rich and
  costly construction and by long ranges of private dwellings, interrupted here
  and there by temples of religion, edifices of vast extent belonging to the
  state, or by gardens attached to the residences of the luxurious Palmyrene
  nobility.</p>

  <p>'It is well for Palmyra,' here muttered my slave Milo, 'that the Emperor
  has never, like us, travelled this way.'</p>

  <p>'Why so, Milo?' said I.</p>

  <p>'I simply think,' rejoined he, 'that he would burn it down; and it were a
  pity so many fine buildings should be destroyed. Was there not once a place
  called Carthage? I have heard it said that it was as large as Rome, and as
  well garnished with temples, and that for that reason the Romans 'blotted it
  out.' The people here may thank the desert which we have crossed, that they
  are not as Carthage. Aurelian, I trow, little dreams what glory is to be won
  here in the East, or else he would not waste his time upon the savage
  Goths,'</p>

  <p>'The Romans are no longer barbarians,'I replied, 'as they were once. They
  build up now, instead of demolishing. Remember that Augustus rebuilt
  Carthage, and that the first Antonine founded that huge and beautiful temple
  which rose out of the midst of Baalbec; and besides&mdash;if I am not
  mistaken&mdash;many of the noblest monuments of art in this very city are the
  fruit of his munificence.'</p>

  <p>'Gods, what a throng is here!' ejaculated Milo, little heeding,
  apparently, what I had said; 'how are we to get our beasts along? They pay no
  more regard to us, either, than if we were not Romans. Could any one have
  believed that a people existed of such strange customs and appearance? What
  carriages!&mdash;what wagons!&mdash;what animals!&mdash;what fantastical
  attire!&mdash;and from every corner of the earth, too, as it would seem! But
  it is a pretty sight. Pity though but they could move as quick, as they look
  well. Fellow, there! you will gratify us if you will start your camels a
  little out of our way. We wish to make toward the house of Gracchus, and we
  cannot pass you.'</p>

  <p>The rider of the camel turned round his turbaned head, and fixing upon
  Milo a pair of fierce eyes, bade him hold his peace:</p>

  <p>'Did he not see the street was crowded?'</p>

  <p>'I see it is filled with a set of dull idlers,' replied Milo, 'who want
  nothing but Roman rods to teach them a quick and wholesome movement. Friend,
  lend me thy cudgel; and I will engage to set thy beasts and thee too in
  motion. If not, consider that we are new comers, and Romans withal, and that
  we deserve some regard.'</p>

  <p>'Romans!' screamed he: 'may curses light on you You swarm here like
  locusts, and like them you come but to devour. Take my counsel: turn your
  faces the other way, and off to the desert again! I give you no welcome, for
  one. Now pass on&mdash;if on you still will go&mdash;and take the curse of
  Hassan the Arab along with you.'</p>

  <p>'Milo,' said I, 'have a care how you provoke these Orientals. Bethink
  yourself that we are not now in the streets of Rome. Bridle your tongue
  betimes, or your head may roll off your shoulders before you can have time to
  eat your words to save it'</p>

  <p>'I am a slave indeed,' answered Milo, with some dignity for him, 'but I
  eat other food than my own words. In that there hangs something of the Roman
  about me.'</p>

  <p>We were now opposite what I discovered, from the statues and emblems upon
  it and surrounding it, to be the Temple of Justice, and I knew therefore that
  the palace on the other side of the street, adorned with porticos, and partly
  hidden among embowering trees and shrubs, must be the dwelling of
  Gracchus.</p>

  <p>We turned down into a narrower street, and after proceeding a little way,
  passed under a massy arched gateway, and found ourselves in the spacious
  court- yard of this princely mansion. Slaves soon surrounded us, and by their
  alacrity in assisting me to dismount, and in performing every office of a
  hospitable reception, showed that we were expected guests, and that my
  letters announcing my intended visit had been received. Leaving my slaves and
  effects to the care of the servants of the house, I followed one who seemed
  to be a sort of head among them, through walks bordered with the choicest
  trees, flowers and shrubs, opening here and there in the most graceful manner
  to reveal a statue of some sylvan god reclining under the shade, and soon
  reached the rear of the house, which I entered by a flight of marble steps.
  Through a lofty hall I passed into a saloon which seemed the reception-room
  of the palace, where I had hardly arrived, and obtained one glance at my
  soiled dress and sun-burnt visage in the mirror, than my ear caught the quick
  sound of a female foot hastening over the pavement of the hall, and turning
  suddenly I caught in my arms the beautiful Fausta. It was well for me that I
  was so taken by surprise, for I acted naturally, which I fear I should not
  have done if I had had a moment to deliberate before I met her; for she is no
  longer a girl, as in Rome, running and jumping after her slave to school, but
  a nearly full-grown woman, and of a beauty so imposing as might well cause
  embarrassment in a youth of even more pretensions than myself.</p>

  <p>'Are you indeed,' said I, retaining each hand in mine, but feeling that in
  spite of all my assumed courage I was covered with blushes, 'are you indeed
  the little Fausta? Truly there must be marvellous virtues in the air of
  Palmyra. It is but six years since you left Rome, and then, as I
  remember&mdash;-shall I mention such a thing?&mdash;you were but twelve, and
  now though but'&mdash;</p>

  <p>'O,' cried she, 'never begin such a speech! it will only trouble you
  before you can end it. How glad I am to see you! Welcome, dear Lucius, to
  Palmyra! If open hearts can make you happy here, you will not fail to be so.
  But how did you leave all in Rome? First, your friend Marcus? and Lucilia?
  and the noble, good Portia? Ah! how happy were those days in Rome! Come sit
  on these cushions by this open window. But more than all, how does the dear
  pedagogue and dialectician, the learned Solon? Is he as wise yet as his great
  namesake? O what days of merriment have his vanity and simplicity afforded
  me! But he was a good soul. Would he could have accompanied you. You are not
  so far out of leading-strings that you could not have taken him with you as a
  travelling Mentor. In truth, nothing could have given me more pleasure.'</p>

  <p>'I came away in great haste, dear Fausta,' said I, 'with scarce a moment
  for preparation of any kind. You have but this morning received my letter,
  which was but part of a day in advance of me. If I could have done it, I
  should have given you more timely notice. I could not therefore look out for
  companions for the way. It would however have been a kindness to Solon, and a
  pleasure to me. But why have I not before asked for your father? is not
  Gracchus at home?&mdash;and is he well?'</p>

  <p>'He is at home, or rather he is in the city,' replied Fausta, 'and why he
  makes it so late before returning, I cannot tell: but you will soon see him.
  In the mean time, let my slaves show you where to find your rooms, that you
  may rest and prepare for supper.'</p>

  <p>So saying, she clapped her hands, and a tall Ethiopian, with a turban as
  white as his face was black, quickly made his appearance and took me in his
  charge.</p>

  <p>'Look well after your toilet,' cried Fausta, laughing as I left the room;
  'we think more of costume here than they do in Rome.'</p>

  <p>I followed my dark conductor through many passages to a distant part of
  the building, where I found apartments furnished with every luxury, and
  already prepared for my use.</p>

  <p>'Here I have carefully placed your baggage,' said the slave as I entered
  the room, 'and whatever else I thought you might need. Call Hannibal when you
  wish for my services; I am now yours. This door leads to a small room where
  will lodge your own slave Milo; the others are in the stables.' Thus
  delivering himself, he departed.</p>

  <p>The windows of my apartment opened upon the wide street by which we had
  entered the city, not immediately, but first upon a border of trees and
  flowers, then upon a low wall, here and there crowned with a statue or a
  vase, which separated the house from the street, and last upon the street
  itself, its busy throngs and noble structures. I stood for a moment enjoying
  the scene, rendered more impressive by the dim but still glowing light of the
  declining day. Sounds of languages which I knew not fell upon my ear, sent
  forth by those who urged along through the crowds their cattle, or by those
  who would draw attention to the articles which they had to sell. All was new
  and strange, and tended, together with my reflections upon the business which
  had borne me so far from my home and you, to fill me with melancholy. I was
  roused from my reverie by the voice of Milo.</p>

  <p>'If,' said he, 'the people of these eastern regions understand better than
  we of Rome the art of taking off heads, they certainly understand better, as
  in reason they should, the art of making them comfortable while they are on:
  already I have taken a longer draught at a wine skin than I have been blessed
  with since I was in the service of the most noble Gallienus. Ah, that was
  life! He was your true philosopher who thought life, made for living. These
  Palmyrenes seem of his school.'</p>

  <p>'Leave philosophy, good Milo, and come help me dress; that is the matter
  now in hand. Unclasp these trunks and find something that shall not deform
  me.'</p>

  <p>So desirous was I, you perceive, to appear well in the eyes of the fair
  Fausta.</p>

  <p>It was now the appointed hour to descend to the supper room, and as I was
  about to leave my apartment, hardly knowing which way to move, the Ethiopian,
  Hannibal, made his appearance, to serve as my conductor.</p>

  <p>I was ushered into an apartment, not large, but of exquisite
  proportions&mdash;circular, and of the most perfect architecture, on the
  Greek principles. The walls, thrown into panels between the windows and
  doors, were covered with paintings, admirable both for their design and
  color; and running all around the room, and attached to the walls, was a low
  and broad seat, covered with cushions of the richest workmanship and
  material. A lofty and arched ceiling, lighted by invisible lamps, represented
  a banquet of the gods, offering to those seated at the tables below a high
  example of the manner in which the divine gifts should be enjoyed. This
  evening, at least, we did not use the privileges which that high example
  sanctioned. Fausta was already in the room, and rose with affectionate haste
  to greet me again.</p>

  <p>'I fear my toilet has not been very successful, Fausta,' said I, 'for my
  slave Milo was too much elated by the generous wines with which his
  companions had plied him, as a cordial after the fatigues of the journey, to
  give me any of the benefit of his taste or assistance. I have been my own
  artificer on this occasion, and you must therefore be gentle in your
  judgments.'</p>

  <p>'I cannot say that your fashions are equally tasteful with those of our
  Palmyrenes, I must confess. The love of the beautiful, the magnificent, and
  the luxurious, is our national fault, Lucius; it betrays itself in every
  department of civil and social life, and not unfrequently declines into a
  degrading effeminacy. If any thing ruin us, it will be this vice. I assure
  you I was rather jesting than in earnest, when I bade you look to your
  toilet. When you shall have seen some of our young nobles, you will find
  reason to be proud of your comparative simplicity. I hear, however, that you
  are not now far behind us in Rome&mdash;nay, in many excesses, you go greatly
  beyond us. We have never yet had a Vitellius, a Pollio, or a Gallienus. And
  may the sands of the desert bury us a thousand fathoms deep, ere such
  monsters shall be bred and endured in Palmyra!'</p>

  <p>'I perceive,' said I, 'that your sometime residence in Rome has not taught
  you to love your native country less. If but a small portion of the fire
  which I see burning in your eye warm the hearts of the people, it will be no
  easy matter for any external foe to subdue you, however vice and luxury may
  do it.'</p>

  <p>'There are not many, I believe,' replied Fausta, 'of your or my sex in
  Palmyra, who would with more alacrity lay down their lives for their country
  and our sweet and noble Queen, than I. But believe me, Lucius, there are
  multitudes who would do it as soon. Zenobia will lead the way to no battle-
  field where Fausta, girl though she be, will not follow. Remember what I say,
  I pray you, if difficulty should ever again grow up&mdash;which the gods
  forefend!&mdash;between us and Rome. But, truth to say, we are in more danger
  from ourselves than from Rome.'</p>

  <p>We were now suddenly interrupted by the loud and cheerful voice of
  Gracchus, exclaiming, as he approached us from the great hall of the palace,
  'How now!&mdash;How now!&mdash;whom have we here? Are my eyes and ears true
  to their report&mdash;Lucius Piso? It is he indeed. Thrice welcome to
  Palmyra! May a visit from so good and great a house be an augury of good. You
  are quick indeed upon the track of your letter. How have you sped by the way?
  I need not ask after your own welfare, for I see it, but I am impatient to
  learn all that you can tell me of friends and enemies in Rome. I dare say,
  all this has been once told to Fausta, but, as a penalty for arriving while I
  was absent, it must be repeated for my special pleasure. But come, that can
  be done while we sit at table; I see the supper waits.'</p>

  <p>In this pleasant mood did the father of Fausta, and now, as you know, one
  of the chief pillars of the province or kingdom&mdash;whichever it must be
  called&mdash;receive me. I was struck with the fine union in his appearance
  and manner of courtly ease, and a noble Roman frankness. His head, slightly
  bald, but cast in the truest mould of manly beauty, would have done honor to
  any of his illustrious ancestors; and his figure was entirely worthy of that
  faultless crown. I confess I experienced a pang of regret that one so fitted
  to sustain and adorn the greatness of his parent country had chosen to cast
  his fortunes so far from the great centre and heart of the Empire. After the
  first duties of the table had been gone through with, and my
  hunger&mdash;real hunger&mdash;had been appeased by the various delicacies
  which my kind hostess urged upon me noways unwilling to receive such tokens
  of regard, I took up the questions of Gracchus, and gave him a full account
  of our social and political state in Rome, to all which Fausta too lent a
  greedy ear, her fine face sparkling with the intelligence which beamed out
  from every feature. It was easy to see how deep an interest she takes in
  matters to which her sex are usually so insensible. It is indescribable, the
  imperial pride and lofty spirit of independence which at times sat upon her
  brow and curled her lip. She seems to me made to command. She is indeed
  courteous and kind, but you not with difficulty see that she is bold,
  aspiring and proud, beyond the common measure of woman. Her beauty is of this
  character. It is severe, rather than in any sense soft or feminine. Her
  features are those of her father, truly Roman in their outline, and their
  combined expression goes to impress every beholder with the truth that Roman
  blood alone, and that too of all the Gracchi, runs in her veins. Her form
  harmonizes perfectly with the air and character of the face. It is indicative
  of great vigor and decision in every movement; yet it is graceful, and of
  such proportions as would suit the most fastidious Greek. I am thus minute in
  telling you how Fausta struck me, because I know the interest you and Lucilia
  both take in her, and how you will desire to have from me as exact a picture
  as I can draw. Be relieved, my dear friends, as to the state of my heart, nor
  indulge in either hopes or suspicions in this direction. I assure you I am
  not yet a captive at the fair feet of Fausta, nor do I think I shall be. But
  if such a thing should happen, depend upon my friendship to give you the
  earliest intelligence of the event. Whoever shall obtain the heart of Fausta,
  will win one of which a Caesar might be proud. But to return to our present
  interview and its event.</p>

  <p>No sooner had I ended my account of the state of affairs at Rome, than
  Gracchus expressed, in the strongest terms, his joy that we were so
  prosperous. 'It agrees,' said he, 'with all that we have lately heard.
  Aurelian is in truth entitled to the praise which belongs to a reformer of
  the state. The army has not been under such discipline since the days of
  Vespasian. He has now, as we learn by the last arrival of news from the
  North, by the way of Antioch, nearly completed the subjection of the Goths
  and Alemanni, and rumors are afloat of an unpleasant nature, of an Eastern
  expedition. For this no ground occurs to me except, possibly, an attempt upon
  Persia, for the rescue of Valerian, if yet he be living, or for the general
  vindication of the honor of Rome against the disgraceful successes of the
  Great King. I cannot for one moment believe that toward Palmyra any other
  policy will be adopted than that which has been pursued for the last century
  and a half, and emphatically sanctioned, as you well know, by both Gallienus
  and Claudius. Standing on the honorable footing, as nominally a part of the
  empire of Rome, but in fact a sovereign and independent power, we enjoy all
  that we can desire in the form of political privileges. Then for our
  commerce, it could not be more flourishing, or conducted on more advantageous
  terms even to Rome itself. In one word, we are contented, prosperous, and
  happy, and the crime of that man would be great indeed, who, from any motive
  of personal ambition, or any policy of state, would disturb our existing
  relations of peace and friendship with all the world.'</p>

  <p>To this I replied: 'I most sincerely trust that no design, such as you
  hint at, exists in the mind of Aurelian. I know him, and know him to be
  ambitious and imperious, as he is great in resources and unequalled in
  military science, but withal he is a man of wisdom, and in the main, of
  justice too. That he is a true lover of his country, I am sure; and that the
  glory of that country is dearer to him than all other objects&mdash;that it
  rises in him almost to a species of madness&mdash;this I know too; and it is
  from this quarter, if from any, that danger is to be apprehended. He will
  have Rome to be all in all. His desire is that it should once more possess
  the unity that it did under the Antonines. This idea, dwelt upon, may lead
  him into enterprises from which, however defended on the ground of the
  empire's glory, will result in nothing but discredit to himself and injury to
  the state. I too have heard the rumors of which you speak, but I cannot give
  them one moment's credence; and I pray most fervently that, springing as they
  do no one knows whence nor on what authority resting, they will not be
  permitted to have the least effect upon the mind of the Queen, nor upon any
  of her advisers. She is now in reality an independent sovereign, reigning
  over an immense empire, stretching from Egypt to the shores of the Euxine,
  from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates, and she still stands upon the
  records of the senate as a colleague&mdash;even as when Odenatus shared the
  throne with her&mdash;of the Emperor. This is a great and a fortunate
  position. The gods forbid that any intemperance on the part of the Palmyrenes
  should rouse the anger or the jealousy of the fierce Aurelian!'</p>

  <p>Could I have said less than this? But I saw in the countenances of both,
  while I was speaking, especially in the honest, expressive one of Fausta,
  that they could brook no hint of inferiority or of dependence on the part of
  their country; so deep a place has the great Zenobia secured for herself in
  the pride and most sacred affections of this people.</p>

  <p>'I will not, with you, Piso,' said Gracchus, 'believe that the Emperor
  will do aught to break up the present harmony. I will have faith in him; and
  I shall use all the influence that I may possess in the affairs of the state
  to infuse a spirit of moderation into our acts, and above all into our
  language; for one hasty word uttered in certain quarters may lead to the ruin
  of kingdoms that have taken centuries to attain their growth. But this I say:
  let there only come over here from the West the faintest whisper of any
  purpose on the part of Aurelian to consider Zenobia as holding the same
  position in regard to Rome as Tetricus in Gaul, and that moment a flame is
  kindled throughout Palmyra that nothing but blood can quench. This people, as
  you well know, has been a free people from the earliest records of history,
  and they will sink under the ruins of their capital and their country, ere
  they will bend to a foreign power.'</p>

  <p>'That will they!&mdash;that will they, indeed!' cried Fausta; 'there is
  not a Palmyrene who, had he two lives, would not give one for liberty, and
  the other for his good Queen. You do not know Zenobia, Lucius, nor can you
  tell, therefore, how reasonable the affection is which binds every heart to
  her as to a mother or a sister.'</p>

  <p>'But enough of this for the present,' said Gracchus; 'let us leave the
  affairs of nations, and ascend to those of private individuals&mdash;for I
  suppose your philosophy teaches you, as it does me, that individual happiness
  is the object for which governments are instituted, and that they are
  therefore less than this. Let us ascend, I say, from the policy of Rome and
  of Aurelian, to the private affairs of our friend Lucius Piso; for your
  letter gives me the privilege of asking you to tell us, in all frankness and
  love, what, beside the pleasure of seeing us, brings you so far from Rome. It
  is, you hint, a business of a painful nature. Use me and Fausta, as you would
  in Rome Portia and the good Lucilia, with the same freedom and the same
  assurance of our friendship.'</p>

  <p>'Do so, indeed,' added Fausta, with affectionate warmth, 'and feel that,
  in addressing us, you are entrusting your thoughts to true and long-tried
  friends.'</p>

  <p>'I have,' replied I, 'but little to communicate, but that little is great
  in its interest, and demands immediate action; and touching what shall be
  most expedient to be done, I shall want and shall ask your deliberate
  counsel. You are well aware, alas! too well aware, of the cruel fate of my
  parent, the truly great Cneius Piso, whom to name is always a spring of
  strength to my virtues. With the unhappy Valerian, to whom he clung to the
  last, resolved to die with him, or suffer with him whatever the fates should
  decree, he passed into captivity; but of too proud a spirit to endure the
  indignities which were heaped upon the Emperor, and which were threatened
  him, he&mdash;so we have learned&mdash;destroyed himself. He found an
  opportunity, however, before he thus nobly used his power, to exhort my poor
  brothers not at once, at least, to follow his example, 'You are young,' said
  he, 'and have more strength than I, and the gods may interpose and deliver
  you. Hope dwells with youth, as it dies with age. Do not despair. I feel that
  you will one day return to Rome. For myself, I am a decayed trunk, at best,
  and it matters little when I fall, or where I lie. One thing, at least, I
  cannot bear; it would destroy me if I did not destroy myself. I am a Roman
  and a Piso, and the foot of a Persian shall never plant itself upon my neck.
  I die.' My elder brother, thinking example a more powerful kind of precept
  than words, no sooner was assured of the death of his father, than he too
  opened his veins, and perished. And so we learned had Calpurnius done, and we
  were comparatively happy in the thought that they had escaped by a voluntary
  death the shame of being used as footstools by the haughty Sapor, and the
  princes of his court. But a rumor reached us a few days before I left Rome,
  that Calpurnius is yet living. We learn, obscurely, that being favorably
  distinguished and secretly favored by the son of Sapor, he was persuaded to
  live, and wait for the times to open a way for his escape. You may imagine
  both my grief and my joy on this intelligence. The thought that he should so
  long have lain in captivity and imprisonment, and no step have been taken
  toward his rescue, has weighed upon me with a mountain weight of sorrow. Yet
  at the same time, I have been supported by the hope that his deliverance may
  be effected, and that he may return to Rome once more, to glad the eyes of
  the aged Portia. It is this hope which has brought me to Palmyra, as perhaps
  the best point whence to set in motion the measures which it shall be thought
  wisest to adopt. I shall rely much upon your counsel.' No sooner had I spoken
  thus, than Fausta quickly exclaimed:</p>

  <p>'O father, how easily, were the Queen now in Palmyra, might we obtain
  through her the means of approaching the Persian King with some hope of a
  successful appeal to his compassion!&mdash;and yet'&mdash;She hesitated and
  paused.</p>

  <p>'I perceive,' said Gracchus, 'what it is that checks your speech. You feel
  that in this matter Zenobia would have no power with the Persian monarch or
  court. The two nations are now, it is true, upon friendly terms; but a deep
  hatred exists in the heart of Sapor toward Zenobia. The successive defeats
  which he suffered, when Odenatus and his Queen took it upon them to vindicate
  the honor of Rome, and revenge the foul indignities cast upon the unfortunate
  Valerian, will never be forgotten; and policy only, not love or regard, keeps
  the peace between Persia and Palmyra. Sapor fears the power of Zenobia,
  supported, as he knows she would be in case of rupture, by the strength of
  Rome; and moreover, he is well aware that Palmyra serves as a protecting wall
  between him and Rome, and that her existence as an independent power is vital
  to the best interests of his kingdom. For these reasons harmony prevails, and
  in the event of war between us and Rome, we might with certainty calculate
  upon Persia as an ally. Still Sapor is an enemy at heart. His pride, humbled
  as it was by that disastrous rout, when his whole camp and even his wives
  fell into the hands of the Royal Odenatus, will never recover from the wound,
  and will prompt to acts of retaliation and revenge, rather than to any deed
  of kindness. While his public policy is, and doubtless will continue to be,
  pacific, his private feelings are, and ever will be, bitter. I see not how in
  this business we can rely with any hope of advantage upon the interposition
  of the Queen. If your brother is ever rescued, it must, I think, be achieved
  by private enterprise.'</p>

  <p>'Your words,' said I, 'have pierced me through with grief, and dispelled
  in a moment the brightest visions. All the way from Rome have I been cheered
  by the hope of what the Queen, at your solicitation, would be able to attempt
  and accomplish in my behalf. But it is all over. I feel the truth of what you
  have urged. I see it&mdash;I now see it&mdash;private enterprise can alone
  effect his deliverance, and from this moment I devote myself to that work. If
  Rome leave her Emperor to die in captivity, so will not I my brother. I will
  go myself to the den of this worse than barbarian king, and bring thence the
  loved Calpurnius, or leave my own body there for that beast to batten on. It
  is now indeed thirteen years since Calpurnius left me, a child in Rome, to
  join the Emperor in that ill-fated expedition. But it is with the
  distinctness of a yesterday's vision that he now stands before my eyes, as he
  then stood that day he parted from us, glittering in his brilliant armor, and
  his face just as brilliant with the light of a great and trusting spirit. As
  he turned from the last embraces of the weeping Portia, he seized me in his
  arms, who stood jingling his sword against his iron greaves, and imprinting
  upon my cheek a kiss, bade me grow a man at once, to take care of the
  household, while they were gone with the good Emperor to fight the enemies of
  Rome in Asia. He was, as I remember him, of a quick and fiery temper, but he
  was always gentle toward me, and has bound me to him forever,'</p>

  <p>'The gods prosper you!' cried Fausta, 'as surely they will. It is a pious
  work to which you put your hand, and you will succeed.'</p>

  <p>'Do not, Fausta,' said Gracchus, 'lend the weight of your voice to urge
  our friend to measures which may be rather rash than wise, and may end only
  in causing a greater evil than what already exists. Prudence must govern us
  as well as affection. By venturing yourself at once into the dominion of
  Persia, upon such an errand, it is scarcely less than certain that you would
  perish, and without effecting your object. We ought to consider, too, I
  think, what the condition and treatment of Calpurnius are, before too great a
  risk is incurred for his rescue. He has now, we are to remember, been at the
  capital of the great king thirteen years. You have hinted that he had been
  kindly regarded by the son of Sapor. Possibly his captivity amounts to no
  more than a foreign residence&mdash;a sort of exile. Possibly he may, in this
  long series of years, have become changed into a Persian. I understand your
  little lip, Fausta, and your indignant frown, Lucius; but what I suggest is
  among things possible, it cannot be denied; and can you deny it?&mdash;not so
  very unlikely, when you think what the feelings of one must have been to be
  so wholly forgotten and abandoned by his native country, and that country,
  Rome, the mistress of the world, who needed but to have stretched forth the
  half of her power to have broken for ever the chains of his slavery, as well
  as of the thousands who with him have been left to linger out their lives in
  bondage. If Calpurnius has been distinguished by the son of Sapor, his lot,
  doubtless, has been greatly lightened, and he may now be living as a Persian
  prince. My counsel is, therefore, that the truth in this regard be first
  obtained, before the life of another son, and the only inheritor of so great
  a name, be put in jeopardy. But what is the exact sum of what you have
  learned, and upon which we may rely, and from which reason and act?'</p>

  <p>'Our knowledge,'I replied, 'is derived from a soldier, who, by a great and
  happy fortune, escaped and reached his native Rome. He only knew what he saw
  when he was first a captive, and afterward, by chance, had heard from others.
  He was, he said, taken to serve as a slave about the palace of the King, and
  it was there that for a space he was an eye-witness to the cruel and
  insulting usage of both Valerian and Calpurnius. That was but too true, he
  said, which had been reported to us, that whenever the proud Sapor went forth
  to mount his horse, the Emperor was brought, in the face of the whole court,
  and of the populace who crowded round, to serve as his footstool. Clothed in
  the imperial purple, the unfortunate Valerian received upon his neck the foot
  of Sapor, and bore him to his saddle. It was the same purpose that Calpurnius
  was made to serve for the young prince Hormisdas. But, said the soldier, the
  prince pitied the young and noble Roman, and would gladly, at the beginning,
  have spared him the indignity put upon him by the stern command of his
  haughty and cruel father. He often found occasion at these times, while
  standing with his foot upon his neck, to speak with Calpurnius, and to
  express his regrets and his grief for his misfortunes, and promise redress,
  and more, if he ever came to the throne. But the soldier was soon removed
  from the vicinity of the Royal palace, and saw no more of either Valerian or
  Calpurnius. What came to his ears was, generally, that while Valerian was
  retained exclusively for the use of Sapor, Calpurnius was after a time
  relinquished as entirely into the hands of Hormisdas, in whose own palace he
  dwelt, but with what portion of freedom, he knew not. That he was living at
  the time he escaped, he was certain. This, Gracchus, is the sum of what we
  have heard; in addition only, that the Emperor sank under his misfortunes,
  and that his skin, fashioned over some substance so as exactly to resemble
  the living man, is preserved by Sapor, as a monument of his triumph over the
  legions of Rome.'</p>

  <p>'It is a pitiful story,' said Fausta, as I ended: 'for a brave man it has
  been a fate worse than death; but having survived the first shame, I fear me
  my father's thought will prove a too true one, and that long absence, and
  indignation at neglect, and perhaps gratitude and attachment to the prince,
  who seems to have protected him, will have weaned him from Rome. So that we
  cannot suffer you, Lucius, to undertake so long and dangerous a journey upon
  so doubtful an errand. But those can be found, bold and faithful, who for
  that ample reward with which you could so easily enrich them, would venture
  even into the heart of Ecbatana itself, and bring you back your brother
  alive, or advertise you of his apostasy or death.'</p>

  <p>'What Fausta says is just,' observed Gracchus, 'and in few words
  prescribes your course. It will not be a difficult thing, out of the
  multitudes of bold spirits who crowd the capital, Greek, Roman, Syrian, and
  Arab, to find one who will do all that you could do, and I may add, both more
  and better. You may find those who are familiar with the route, who know the
  customs of Persia, who can speak its language, and are even at home in her
  capitals, and who would be infinitely more capable than either you or I, or
  even Fausta, to manage to a happy issue an enterprise like this. Let this
  then be our decision; and be it now our united care to find the individual to
  whom we may commit this dear but perilous service. And now enough of this.
  The city sleeps, and it were better that we slept with it. But first, my
  child, bring harmony into our spirits by one of those wild, sad airs which
  you are accustomed to sing to me upon the harp of the Jews. It will dispose
  Lucius to pleasant dreams.'</p>

  <p>I added my importunities, and Fausta rising, moved to an open window,
  through which the moon was now pouring a flood of silver light, and seating
  herself before the instrument which stood there, first swept its strings with
  an easy and graceful hand.</p>

  <p>'I wish,' said she, 'I could give you the song which I am going to sing in
  the language of the Hebrews, for it agrees better, I think, with the
  sentiment and the character of the music, than the softer accents of the
  Greek. But every thing is Greek now.'</p>

  <p>So saying, she commenced with a prelude more sweetly and profoundly
  melancholy than even the wailing of the night wind among the leafless trees
  of the forest. This was followed by&mdash;an ode shall I call it?&mdash;or a
  hymn?&mdash;for it was not what we mean by a song. Nor was the music like any
  other music I had ever heard, but much more full of passion; broken, wild,
  plaintive, triumphant by turns, it stirred all the deepest feelings of the
  heart. It seemed to be the language of one in captivity, who, refusing to
  sing one of the songs of his country for the gratification of his conquerors,
  broke out into passionate strains of patriotism, in which he exalted his
  desolated home to the Heavens, and prophesied in the boldest terms her
  ultimate restoration to power and glory. The sentiment lost nothing coming to
  the ear clothed in the rich music of Fausta's voice, which rose and sank,
  swelled and died away, or was full of tears or joy, as agreed with the theme
  of the poet. She was herself the poet, and the captive, and the Jew, so
  wholly did she abandon herself to the sway of the thoughts which she was
  expressing. One idea alone, however, had possessed me while she sang&mdash;to
  which, the moment she paused, I first gave utterance. 'And think you,
  Fausta,' said I, 'that while the captive Jew remembers his country, the
  captive Roman will forget his? Never! Calpurnius, if he lives, lives a Roman.
  For this I thank your song. Melancholy and sad in itself, it has bred joy in
  my soul. I shall now sleep well.' So saying, we separated.</p>

  <p>Thus was passed my first evening in Palmyra.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="letter03"
     id="letter03">LETTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WITH what pleasure do I again sit down, dear Curtius and
Lucilia, to tell
  you how I have passed my time, and what I have been able to accomplish, since
  I last wrote; thrice happy that I have to report of success rather than of
  defeat in that matter which I have undertaken. But first, let me thank you
  for all the city gossip, with which you so greatly entertained me in your
  joint epistle. Although I pass my hours and days in this beautiful capital as
  happily as I could any where out of Rome, still my letters from home are a
  great addition to my enjoyment. After rising from perusal of yours and my
  mother's, I was a new man. Let me beg you&mdash;which indeed I need hardly
  do&mdash;to send each letter of mine, as you receive it, to Portia, and in
  return receive and read those which I have written and shall continue to
  write to her. To you I shall give a narrative of events; to her, I shall pour
  out sentiment and philosophy, as in our conversation we are wont to do. I
  shall hope soon to have somewhat of interest to say of the state of letters
  here, and of my interviews with distinguished men. So soon as the Queen shall
  return from her excursion through some of her distant provinces, I shall call
  upon Gracchus to fulfil his promise, and make me known to the great Longinus,
  now with the Queen absent. From my intercourse with him I shall look to draw
  up long and full reports of much that shall afford both entertainment and
  instruction to you all.</p>

  <p>I have now passed several days in Palmyra, and have a mass of things to
  say. But instead of giving you a confused report, I shall separate one thing
  from another, and set down each according to the time and manner in which it
  happened. This is what I know you desire, and this is what I shall do.</p>

  <p>I cannot easily tell you how delicious was my slumber after that last day
  of fatiguing travel, and that evening of to me the most exciting converse. I
  dreamed that night of Calpurnius rescued and returned; and ever as he was
  present to my sleeping fancy, the music of Fausta's harp and voice was
  floating near.</p>

  <p>Hannibal was early at my door to warn me of the hour of the morning meal,
  Milo being still under the influences of the evening's potation. I was shown
  to a different apartment from that in which we had supped, but opening into
  it. It was a portico rather than a room, being on two sides open to the
  shrubbery, with slender Ionic pillars of marble supporting the ceiling, all
  joined together by the light interlacings of the most gorgeous creeping
  plants. Their odors filled the air. A fountain threw up in the most graceful
  forms its clear water, and spread all around an agreeable coolness. Standing
  at those points where flights of steps led down to the walks and plots of
  grass and flowers, which wound about the palace, the eye wandered over the
  rich scene of verdure and blossom which they presented, and then rested where
  it can never rest too often or too long, upon the glittering shafts of the
  Temple of the Sun. This morning prospect, from this single point, I thought
  was reward enough for my long voyage and hot journey over the desert. It
  inspired more cheerful thoughts than the same scene as I had seen it the
  evening before from the windows of my chamber. I could not but draw omens of
  good from the universal smile that beamed upon me from the earth and the
  heavens. Fausta's little hand suddenly placed within mine, and the cheerful
  greeting of her voice, awoke me from my dreamy state.</p>

  <p>'Your countenance shows that you have slept well, Lucius,' said she; 'it
  is bright as the morning itself. Your dreams must have been favorable. Or
  else is it the wonder-working power of a Palmyrene air that has wrought so
  with you since the last evening? Tell me, have you not slept as you never
  slept in Rome?'</p>

  <p>'I have slept well, indeed,'I replied, 'but I believe it was owing rather
  to your harp and Jewish ode, than to any mysterious qualities of the air.
  Your music haunted the chambers of my brain all night, and peopled them with
  the forms of those whom I love, and whose memory it last evening recalled so
  vividly. Mostly I dreamed of Calpurnius, and of his return to Rome, and with
  him came ever your image dimly seen hovering round, and the strains of your
  voice and harp. These are to me auguries of good, even as if the voice of a
  god had spoken. I shall once more embrace a brother&mdash;and what is even
  more, a Roman.'</p>

  <p>'The gods grant it may be so!' replied Fausta: 'A prayer which I repeat,'
  cried Gracchus, as he approached us from the hall, through which I had just
  passed. 'I have thought much of your affair since I parted from you last
  evening, and am more than ever persuaded that we came to a true decision
  touching the steps best to be taken. To-day I shall be much abroad, and shall
  not forget to search in every direction for one who may be intrusted with
  this nice, and difficult, and withal dangerous business. I can now think of
  no messenger who bids so fair to combine all the qualities we most desire, as
  the Jew. I know but few of that tribe, and those are among the rich. But then
  those rich are connected in various ways with the poor&mdash;for to a
  marvellous extent they are one people&mdash;- it is the same you know in
  Rome&mdash;and through them I think I may succeed.'</p>

  <p>'Now have you,'I quickly added, 'again poured light into my mind. Half our
  labor is over. I know a Jew whose capacities could not be more fitting for
  this enterprise. I saw much of him on board the vessel which took us first to
  the African coast, where, at Utica, it set him on shore, bringing me farther
  on to Berytus. He is a true citizen of the world&mdash;knows all languages,
  and all people, and all places. He has all the shrewdness of his
  race&mdash;-their intelligence, their enthusiasm, and, I may add, their
  courage. He is a traveller by profession, and a vender of such things as any
  will buy, and will go wherever he may hope to make large gains wherewith to
  do his share toward "building again the walls of Jerusalem," as he calls it.
  He has a home in every city of the East. It was toward Palmyra that he was
  bending his way: and, as I now remember, promised that he would see me here
  not many days after I should arrive, and have the pleasure, as he trusted, to
  sell me more of his goods; for you must be told that I did indeed traffic
  with him, however little it became a patrician of Rome. And here I have about
  me, in a little casket, some rings which I purchased of him, having upon them
  heads of Zenobia and Odenatus, resembling the originals to the life, as he
  assured me with much asseveration. See, Fausta, here they are. Look now, and
  tell me if he has spoken in this instance the truth; if so, it will be a
  ground for trusting him farther.'</p>

  <p>'Beautiful!' exclaimed both Gracchus and Fausta. 'He has indeed dealt
  honestly with you. Nothing can be more exact than these resemblances, and the
  workmanship is worthy the hand of Demetrius the Greek.'</p>

  <p>'Provincials,' said I, 'ever know the capital and its fashions better than
  citizens. Now never till Isaac, my Jew friend, rehearsed to me the praises of
  Demetrius the jeweller, had I ever heard his name, or aught concerning his
  skill, and here in the heart of Asia he seems a household word.'</p>

  <p>'It is so, indeed,' said Gracchus. 'I do not doubt that the fashionable
  artists of every kind in Rome are better known to the followers of fashion in
  Palmyra than they are to the patricians themselves. Wanting the real
  greatness of Rome, we try to surpass her in the trappings of greatness. We
  are well represented by the frog of &AElig;sop; happy, if our swelling pride
  do not destroy us. But these rings&mdash;they are indeed of exquisite art.
  The head of Odenatus is truer to life, methinks, than that of the Queen.'</p>

  <p>'And how can poor stone and gold set out the divine beauty and grace of
  Zenobia!' cried Fausta. 'This is beautiful to you now, Lucius, but it will be
  so no longer when you shall have seen her. Would that she were here! It seems
  as if the sun were gone from the heavens, when she is absent from us on these
  long excursions among her distant subjects.'</p>

  <p>'Till then, dear Fausta,' said I, 'deign to wear on that only finger which
  I see ungraced by a ring, this head of your so much vaunted Queen; afterward
  wear it, if you will, not for her sake, but mine.'</p>

  <p>So saying, upon her finger which she held out to me&mdash;and which how
  beautiful it was I shall not say&mdash;I attempted to pass the ring, but
  alas! it was too small, and would not, with all the gentle force I dared to
  use, go on.</p>

  <p>'Here is an omen, Fausta,' said I; 'the Queen cannot be forced upon your
  hand. I fear your friendship is threatened.'</p>

  <p>'Oh! never entertain any such apprehension,' interrupted Fausta. 'It is
  quite needless. Here is plenty of room on this neighbor finger. It is quite
  right that Aurelian, you know, should give way to Zenobia: so, away with the
  Emperor!' and she snapped the ring across the pavement of the
  Portico&mdash;'and now, Lucius, invest me with that burning beauty.'</p>

  <p>'And now do you think you deserve it? I marvel, Gracchus, at the boldness
  of these little girls. Verily, they bid fair to mount up over our heads. But
  come, your finger: there&mdash;one cannot but say it becomes you better than
  the fierce Aurelian. As for the deposed Emperor, he is henceforward mine.
  Thus I re-instate him.' In saying which, I pursued and picked up the
  discarded ring, and gave to it the most honored place upon my right hand.</p>

  <p>Fausta now, first laughingly bidding me welcome to the ring, called us to
  the table, where the breakfast, consisting of fruits in greater proportion
  than with us, awaited us. Much talk now ensued concerning the city, its
  growth and numbers, power and probable destiny. I was satisfied from what
  fell from each, that the most ambitious designs are entertained by both the
  court and people, and that their wonderful successes have bred in them a real
  belief that they should have nothing to fear from the valor or power of Rome,
  under any circumstances of collision. When this was through, Gracchus, rising
  from his seat and pacing slowly up and down the portico, spoke of my private
  affairs, and with great kindness went over again the whole ground. The result
  was the same.</p>

  <p>'Our way, then,' he said, 'is clear. Wait a few days for your fellow
  traveller, Isaac. If he appears, well,&mdash;if not, we must then search the
  quarter of the Jews for one who may do as good service perhaps. I now leave
  you, with a suggestion to Fausta that she should take it upon her to drive
  you round the city, and into the suburbs. No one can perform the office of a
  guide better than she.'</p>

  <p>'If Fausta will take that trouble upon her,'I replied, 'it will give
  me&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'A great deal of pleasure, you were going to say; so it will me. I am sure
  we shall enjoy it. If I love any thing, it is to reveal to a proud Roman the
  glories of Palmyra. Take away from a Roman that ineffable air which says
  "Behold embodied in me the majesty of Rome!" and there remains a very
  agreeable person. But for those qualities of mind and manners which fit men
  and women for society, the Roman men and women must yield to the Palmyrenes.
  So I think, who have seen somewhat of both&mdash;and so think&mdash;gainsay
  my authorities if you have the courage&mdash;Longinus and the Bishop of
  Antioch. I see that you are disturbed. No wonder. Longinus, though a
  philosopher, is a man of the world, who sees through its ways as clearly as
  he does through the mysticism of Plato, and that asks for good eyes; and for
  the bishop&mdash;there is not so finished a gentleman in all the East. His
  appointments are not less exquisite than those of the highest noble either of
  Antioch or Palmyra. If an umpire in any question of manners were to be
  chosen, it would be he.'</p>

  <p>'As for the Greek,'I rejoined, 'I am predisposed to admit his superior
  claims. I will surrender to him with alacrity my doubts both in manners and
  philosophy. For I hold there is a philosophy in manners, nay, even in
  clothes, and that the highest bred intellect will on that very account best
  perceive the nice distinctions and relations, in the exact perception and
  observance of which the highest manners consist. Such an one may offend
  against the last device in costume&mdash;and the last refinement in the
  recondite art of a bow&mdash;but he will eternally excel in all that we mean
  by breeding. Your bishop I know nothing of, but your account of him strikes
  me not very agreeably. These Christian bishops, methinks, are taking upon
  themselves too much. And besides, if what I gathered of the theory of their
  religion from a passenger on board the Mediterranean trader, be correct, they
  depart greatly from the severity of their principles, when they so addict
  themselves to the practices of courts and of the rich. I received from this
  Christian a beautiful idea of his faith, and only lamented that our
  companionship was broken off before I had had time fully to comprehend all he
  had to say. The character of this man, and his very countenance, seemed as
  arguments to support the strict opinions which he advanced. This bishop, I
  think, can scarcely do his faith the same service.'</p>

  <p>'I know him not much,' said Fausta, 'and of his faith, nothing. He has
  great power over the Princess Julia, and it would not much amaze me if, by
  and by, she declared herself a Christian. It is incredible how that
  superstition spreads. But here is our carriage. Come, let us forth.'</p>

  <p>So, breaking off our talk, we betook ourselves to the carriage. How shall
  I find language, my Curtius, to set before you with the vividness of the
  reality, or with any approach to it, the pictures which this drive through
  and around Palmyra caused to pass successively before me? You know indeed,
  generally, what the city is, from the reports of former travellers,
  especially from the late book of Spurius, about which and its speculations
  much was said a little while since. But let me tell you, a more one-sided,
  one-eyed, malignant observer never thrust himself upon the hospitalities of a
  free, open-hearted people, than that same Spurius, poet and bibliopole. His
  very name is an offence to the Palmyrenes, who, whatever national faults they
  may have, do not deserve the deep disgrace of being brought before the world
  in the pages of so poor a thing as the said Ventidius Spurius. Though it will
  not be my province to treat as an author of the condition, policy, and
  prospects of Palmyra, yet to you and my friends I shall lay myself open with
  the utmost freedom, and shall refrain from no statement or opinion that shall
  possess, or seem to do so, truth or importance.</p>

  <p>The horses springing from under the whip of the charioteer, soon bore us
  from the great entrance of the palace into the midst of the throng that
  crowded the streets. The streets, seen now under the advantages of a warm
  morning sun adding a beauty of its own to whatever it glanced upon, showed
  much more brilliantly than ours of Rome. There is, in the first place, a more
  general sumptuousness in equipage and dress, very striking to the eye of a
  Roman. Not perhaps that more wealth is displayed, but the forms and the
  colors, through which it displays itself, are more various, more tasteful,
  more gorgeous. Nothing can exceed, nothing equals, it is said, any where in
  the world, the state of the Queen and her court; and this infects, if I may
  use so harsh a word, the whole city. So that, though with far less of real
  substantial riches than we have, their extravagance and luxury are equal, and
  their taste far before us. Then every thing wears a newer, fresher look than
  in Rome. The buildings of the republic, which many are so desirous to
  preserve, and whole streets even of ante-Augustan architecture, tend to
  spread around here and there in Rome a gloom&mdash;to me full of beauty and
  poetry&mdash;but still gloom. Here all is bright and gay. The buildings of
  marble&mdash;the streets paved and clean&mdash;frequent fountains of water
  throwing up their foaming jets, and shedding around a delicious
  coolness&mdash;temples, and palaces of the nobles, or of wealthy Palmyrene
  merchants&mdash;altogether present a more brilliant assemblage of objects
  than I suppose any other city can boast. Then conceive, poured through these
  long lines of beautiful edifices, among these temples and fountains, a
  population drawn from every country of the far East, arrayed in every variety
  of the most showy and fanciful costume; with the singular animals, rarely
  seen in our streets, but here met at every turn&mdash;elephants, camels, and
  dromedaries, to say nothing of the Arabian horses, with their jewelled
  housings, with every now and then a troop of the Queen's cavalry, moving
  along, to the sound of their clanging trumpets&mdash;conceive, I say, this
  ceaseless tide of various animal life poured along among the proud piles, and
  choking the ways, and you will have some faint glimpse of the strange and
  imposing reality.</p>

  <p>Fausta was in raptures at my transports, and in her pleasant but deep-
  meaning way, boasted much over the great capital of the world. So we rode
  along, slowly, because of the crowded state of the streets, and on account of
  my desire to observe the manners and ways of the people&mdash;their shops,
  which glittered with every rare work of art&mdash;and the devices, so similar
  in all places of trade, by which the seller attracts the buyer. I was
  engrossed by objects of this sort, when Fausta's voice drew my attention
  another way.</p>

  <p>'Now,' said she, 'prepare yourself for the glory of Palmyra; look when we
  shall suddenly turn round the next corner, on the left, and see what you
  shall see.'</p>

  <p>The chariot soon whirled round the indicated corner, and we found
  ourselves in full view of the Temple of the Sun, so famous throughout the
  world. Upon a vast platform of marble, itself decorated with endless lines of
  columns&mdash;elsewhere of beauty and size sufficient for the principal
  building, but here a mere appendage&mdash;stood in solitary magnificence this
  peerless work of art. All I could do was, and the act was involuntary, to
  call upon the charioteer to rein up his horses and let me quietly gaze. In
  this Fausta, nothing unwilling, indulged me. Then, when satisfied with this
  the first point of view, we wound slowly round the spacious square upon which
  it stands, observing it well in all directions, and taking my fill of that
  exalted but nameless pleasure which flows in upon the soul from the
  contemplation of perfect excellence.</p>

  <p>'This is, if I err not, Fausta, the work of a Greek artist.'</p>

  <p>'It is,' said she: 'here both Romans and Palmyrenes must acknowledge their
  inferiority, and indeed all other people. In every city of the world, I
  believe, all the great works of art are the offspring of Grecian genius and
  Grecian taste. Truly, a wonderful people! In this very city, our
  artists&mdash;our men of letters&mdash;even the first ministers of
  state&mdash;all are Greeks. But come, let us move on to the Long Portico, an
  edifice which will astonish you yet more than even the Temple of the Sun,
  through your having heard of it so much less. We shall reach it in about half
  a Roman mile.'</p>

  <p>This space was soon passed, and the Portico stood revealed with its
  interminable ranges of Corinthian columns, and the busy multitudes winding
  among them, and, pursuing their various avocations, for which this building
  offers a common and convenient ground. Here the merchants assemble and meet
  each other. Here various articles of more than common rarity are brought and
  exhibited for sale. Here the mountebanks resort, and entertain the idle and
  lovers of amusement with their fantastic tricks. And here strangers from all
  parts of the world may be seen walking to and fro, observing the customs of
  the place, and regaling themselves at the brilliant rooms, furnished with
  every luxury, which are opened for their use, or else at the public baths
  which are found in the immediate neighborhood. The Portico does not, like the
  Temple, stand upon an elevated platform, but more upon a level with the
  streets. Its greatness is derived from its extreme length, and its
  exquisitely-perfect designs and workmanship, as seen in the graceful fluted
  columns and the rich entablature running round the whole. The life and
  achievements of Alexander are sculptured upon the frieze; the artist&mdash;a
  Greek also&mdash;having been allowed to choose his own theme.</p>

  <p>'Fausta,' said I, 'my soul is steeped in beauty. It will be to no purpose
  to show me more now. I am like one who has eaten too much&mdash;forgive the
  figure&mdash;delicacies are lost upon him.'</p>

  <p>'I cannot release you yet,' cried Fausta; 'a little farther on, and you
  may see the palace of our great Queen; give me your patience to that point,
  and I will then relieve you by a little excursion through the suburbs, where
  your eye may repose upon a rural beauty as satisfying as this of the city.
  You must see the palace. There!&mdash;we are already in sight of it.'</p>

  <p>It rose upon us, so vast is it, and of so many parts, like a city within a
  city. A fit dwelling for so great, so good, and so beautiful a woman. Of this
  you will find a careful and true account, with drawings, which greatly help
  the imagination, in the otherwise vile book of the traducer Spurius. To that
  I refer you, and so refrain from all description.</p>

  <p>We now left the city, and wound at our leisure among the shady avenues,
  the noble country retreats, the public gardens, the groves and woods which
  encompass the walls, and stretch away far beyond the sight, into the
  interior. Returning, we passed through the arches of the vast aqueduct which
  pours into the city a river of the purest water. This is the most striking
  object, and noblest work of art, without the walls.</p>

  <p>When we had passed in this way nearly the whole day, we at length re-
  entered the city by the Persian Gate, on the eastern side,</p>

  <p>'Now, Fausta,' said I, 'having given so much of the day to pleasure, I
  must give the rest, not to pain, but to duty. I will seek out and find, if I
  can, Demetrius, brother to Demetrius of Rome. From him I can learn, it seems
  probable, concerning the movements of Isaac.'</p>

  <p>'You will find the shop of Demetrius in the very heart of the city, midway
  between the Persian and Roman gates. Farewell, for a time, and may the gods
  prosper you!'</p>

  <p>I was not long in making my way to the shop of the Greek. I found the
  skilful Demetrius busily engaged in putting the last polish upon a small
  silver statue of a flying Mercury. He looked up as I entered, and saluting me
  in Greek, invited me to look at his works. I could not for a long time take
  off my eyes from the figure upon which he was working, and expressed my
  admiration.</p>

  <p>'Ah, it is very well, I think, said he, 'but it is nothing compared with
  the work of my brother at Rome. You know him doubtless?'</p>

  <p>'Indeed I do not, I am obliged to say.'</p>

  <p>'What!&mdash;a Roman, as I perceive, and a patrician also, and not know
  Demetrius the goldsmith?&mdash;he who was the favorite of Valerian, and
  Gallienus, and Claudius, and now of Aurelian? There is no hand like that of
  Demetrius the elder. These, sir, are mere scratches, to his divine touch.
  These are dolls, compared with the living and breathing gold as it leaves his
  chisel. Sir, it is saying nothing beyond belief, when I say, that many a
  statue like this, of his, is worth more than many a living form that we see
  in and out of the shop. Forgive me, but I must say I would rather possess one
  of his images of Venus or Apollo, than a live Roman&mdash;though he be a
  patrician too.'</p>

  <p>'You are complimentary,'I said: 'but I can believe you. When I return to
  Rome, I shall seek out your brother, and make myself acquainted with his
  genius. I have heretofore heard of him chiefly through a travelling Jew, whom
  I fell in with on the way hither&mdash;Isaac, as he is called.'</p>

  <p>'Ah ha!&mdash;Isaac of Rome. I know him well,' he replied. 'He is a good
  man&mdash;that is, he is good for one of that tribe. I look for him every
  day. A letter from Rome informs me that he is on his way. It is a pleasant
  thing to see Isaac. I wonder what curiosities he brings from the hand of my
  brother. He will be welcome. I trust he brings some heads of our late king
  and present queen, from drawings which I made and transmitted. I am impatient
  to see them. Saw you anything of this sort about him?'</p>

  <p>'Truly I did, and if by some ill chance I have not left them behind me, in
  my preparations for a morning excursion, I can show you what you will like to
  see. Ah! here it is: in this small casket I have, I presume, unless Isaac
  shall have deceived me&mdash;but of which you will be a perfect
  judge&mdash;some of your brother's art. Look, here are rings with heads of
  your king and queen, such as you have just spoken of. Are they genuine?'</p>

  <p>'No instrument but that which is guided by the hand of the elder Demetrius
  ever did this work,' said he, slowly drawing out his words, as he closely
  scrutinized the ring. 'The gold embossment might indeed have been done by
  another, but not these heads, so true to the life, and of an art so far
  beyond any ability of mine, that I am tempted sometimes to think that he is
  in league with Vulcan. Gods! how that mouth of the Queen speaks! Do we not
  hear it? Ah, Roman, give me the skill of Demetrius the elder, and I would
  spit upon all the power of Aurelian.'</p>

  <p>'You Greeks are a singular people. I believe that the idea of beauty is to
  you food and clothing, and shelter and drink, more than all riches and all
  power: dying on a desert island, a fragment of Phidias would be dearer to you
  than a cargo of food.'</p>

  <p>'That's a pretty conceit enough,' said he, 'and something near the truth,
  as must be confessed.'</p>

  <p>As we were thus idly discoursing, we became suddenly conscious of an
  unusual commotion in the street. The populace began to move quickly by in
  crowds, and vehicles of all sorts came pouring along as if in expectation of
  something they were eager to see.</p>

  <p>'What's all this?&mdash;what's all this?' said Demetrius, leaving his
  work, which he had resumed, and running to the door of his shop: 'what's the
  matter, friend?' addressing a citizen hurrying by: 'Is Aurelian at the gates,
  that you are posting along in such confusion?'</p>

  <p>'Not Aurelian,' replied the other, 'but Aurelian's mistress. The Queen is
  coming. Clouds of dust on the skirts of the plain show that she is advancing
  toward the city.'</p>

  <p>'Now, Roman, if thou wouldst see a sight, be advised and follow me. We
  will mount the roof of yonder market, whence we shall win a prospect such as
  no eye can have seen that has not gazed from the same point. It is where I go
  to refresh my dulled senses, after the day's hard toil.'</p>

  <p>So saying, and pausing a moment only to give some necessary directions to
  the pupils, who were stationed at their tasks throughout the long apartment,
  telling them to wait for the show till it should pass by the shop, and not
  think to imitate their master in all his ways&mdash;saying these things in a
  half earnest and half playful manner&mdash;we crossed the street, and soon
  reached the level roof, well protected by a marble breastwork, of the
  building he had pointed out.</p>

  <p>'We are here just at the right moment,' said he: 'come quickly to this
  corner and secure a seat, for you see the people are already thronging after
  us. There! can Elysium offer a more perfect scene? And look, how inspiring is
  the view of these two multitudes moving toward each other, in the spirit of
  friendship! How the city opens her arms to embrace her Queen!'</p>

  <p>At the distance of about a mile from the walls, we now saw the party of
  the Queen, escorted by a large body of horse: and, approaching them from the
  city, apparently its whole population, some on foot, some on horse, some in
  carriages of every description. The plain was filled with life. The sun
  shooting his beams over the whole, and reflected from the spears and corslets
  of the cavalry, and the gilding and polished work of chariots and harness,
  caused the scene to sparkle as if strewed with diamonds. It was a fair sight.
  But fairer than all was it to witness, as I did, the hearty enthusiasm of the
  people, and even of the children, toward their lovely Queen. Tears of joy
  even I could see falling from many eyes, that she was returning to them
  again. As soon as the near approach of Zenobia to the walls began to conceal
  her and her escort, then we again changed our position, and returned to the
  steps of the shop of Demetrius, as the Queen would pass directly by them, on
  her way to the palace.</p>

  <p>We had been here not many minutes, before the shouts of the people, and
  the braying of martial music, and the confused sound of an approaching
  multitude, showed that the Queen was near. Troops of horse, variously
  caparisoned, each more brilliantly as it seemed than another, preceded a
  train of sumptuary elephants and camels, these too richly dressed, but
  heavily loaded. Then came the body-guard of the Queen, in armor of complete
  steel&mdash;and then the chariot of Zenobia, drawn by milk-white Arabians. So
  soon as she appeared, the air resounded with the acclamations of the
  countless multitudes. Every cry of loyalty and affection was heard from ten
  thousand mouths, making a music such as filled the heart almost to
  breaking.</p>

  <p>'Long live the great Zenobia!' went up to the heavens. 'The blessing of
  all the gods on our good Queen!'&mdash;'Health and happiness to the mother of
  her people!'&mdash;'Death and destruction to her enemies!'&mdash;these, and
  cries of the same kind, came from the people, not as a mere lip-service, but
  evidently, from the tone in which they were uttered, prompted by real
  sentiments of love, such as it seems to me never before can have existed
  toward a supreme and absolute prince.</p>

  <p>It was to me a moment inexpressibly interesting. I could not have asked
  for more, than for the first time to see this great woman just as I now saw
  her. I cannot, at this time, even speak of her beauty, and the imposing yet
  sweet dignity of her manner; for it was with me, as I suppose it was with
  all&mdash;the diviner beauty of the emotions and sentiments which were
  working at her heart and shone out in the expressive language of her
  countenance, took away all power of narrowly scanning complexion, feature and
  form. Her look was full of love for her people. She regarded them as if they
  were her children. She bent herself fondly toward them, as if nothing but the
  restraints of form withheld her from throwing herself into their arms. This
  was the beauty which filled and agitated me. I was more than satisfied.</p>

  <p>'And who,' said I to Demetrius, 'is that beautiful being, but of a sad and
  thoughtful countenance, who sits at the side of the Queen?'</p>

  <p>'That,' he replied, 'is the Princess Julia; a true descendant of her great
  mother; and the gods grant that she, rather than either of her brothers, may
  succeed to the sovereign power.'</p>

  <p>'She looks indeed,' said I, 'worthy to reign&mdash;over hearts at least,
  if not over nations. Those in the next chariot are, I suppose, the young
  Caesars, as I hear they are called&mdash;about as promising, to judge by the
  form and face, as some of our Roman brood of the same name. I need not ask
  whose head that is in the carriage next succeeding; it can belong to no other
  in Palmyra than the great Longinus. What a divine repose breathes over that
  noble countenance! What a clear and far-sighted spirit looks out of those
  eyes! But&mdash;gods of Rome and of the world!&mdash;who sits beside him?
  Whose dark soul is lodged in that fearful tenement?&mdash;fearful and yet
  beautiful, as would be a statue of ebony!'</p>

  <p>'Know you not him? Know you not the Egyptian Zabdas?&mdash;the mirror of
  accomplished knighthood&mdash;the pillar of the state&mdash;the Aurelian of
  the East? Ah! far may you go to find two such men as those&mdash;of gifts so
  diverse, and power so great&mdash;sitting together like brothers. It all
  shows the greater power of Zenobia, who can tame the roughest and most
  ambitious spirits to her uses. Who is like Zenobia?'</p>

  <p>'So ends, it seems to me,'I replied,' every sentence of every
  Palmyrene&mdash;"Who is like Zenobia?"'</p>

  <p>'Well, Roman,' said he, 'it is a good ending; may there never be a worse.
  Happy were it for mankind, if kings and queens were all like her. She rules
  to make others happy&mdash;not to rule. She conceives herself to be an
  instrument of government, not its end. Many is the time, that, standing in
  her private closet, with my cases of rare jewels, or with some pretty fancy
  of mine in the way of statue or vase, I have heard the wisdom of Aristotle
  dropping in the honey of Plato's Greek from her divine lips.'</p>

  <p>'You are all going mad with love,' said I; 'I begin to tremble for myself
  as a Roman. I must depart while I am yet safe. But see! the crowd and the
  show are vanished. Let me hear of the earliest return of Isaac, and the gods
  prosper you! I am at the house of Gracchus, opposite the Temple of
  Justice.'</p>

  <p>I found, on reaching the palace, Fausta and Gracchus, overjoyed at the
  safe and happy return of the Queen. Fausta, too, as the Queen was passing by,
  she standing by one of the pillars of the great entrance, had obtained a
  smile of recognition, and a wave of the hand from her great friend, as I may
  justly term her, and nothing could exceed the spirits she was in.</p>

  <p>'How glad I am, Lucius,' said she, 'that you have seen her so soon, and
  more than all, that you saw her just as you did, in the very heart of the
  people. I do not believe you ever saw Aurelian so received in
  Rome&mdash;Claudius perhaps&mdash;but not again Galliemis, or his severe but
  weak father. But what have you done&mdash;which is to all of us a more
  immediately interesting subject&mdash;what have you done for Calpurnius? Do
  you learn any thing of Isaac?'</p>

  <p>'I have the best news,'I replied, 'possible in the case. Isaac will be in
  Palmyra&mdash;perhaps this very night; but certainly within a few days, if
  the gods spare his life. Demetrius is to give me the earliest intelligence of
  his arrival.'</p>

  <p>'Now then let us,' said Fausta, 'to the table, which need not offer the
  delicacies of Vitellius, to insure a favorable reception from appetites
  sharpened as ours have been by the day's motion and excitement.'</p>

  <p>Gracchus, throwing down a manuscript he had been attentively perusing, now
  joined us.</p>

  <p>Leaving untold all the good things which were said, especially by
  Gracchus, while I and Fausta, more terrestrially given, applied ourselves to
  the agreeable task set before us, I hasten to tell you of my interview with
  the Jew, and of its issue. For no sooner had evening set in, and Fausta,
  seated at her harp, was again soothing the soul with her sweet and wild
  strains, than a messenger was announced from the Greek Demetrius, desiring to
  have communication with me. Divining at once his errand, I sought him in the
  ante- room, where, learning from him that Isaac was arrived, and that if I
  would see him I must seek him on the moment, as he was but for one night in
  the city, intending in the morning to start for Ctesiphon, I bade him lead
  on, and I would follow, first calling Milo to accompany me.</p>

  <p>'To what part of the city do we go?' said I, addressing the messenger of
  Demetrius.</p>

  <p>'To the quarter of the Jews, near the Gate of the Desert,' he replied. 'Be
  not apprehensive of danger,' he added; 'the city is as safe by night as by
  day. This we owe to the great Queen.'</p>

  <p>'Take me where thou wilt, I fear nothing,' said I.</p>

  <p>'But methinks, master mine,' said Milo, 'seeing that we know not the ways
  of this outlandish capital, nor even who this doubtless respectable person is
  who invites us to this enterprise, it were more discreet to add Hannibal to
  our numbers. Permit me, and I will invoke the presence of the Ethiopian.'</p>

  <p>'No, Milo,'I replied, 'in thy valor I am ready to put my trust. Thy
  courage is tried courage, and if need be, I doubt not thou wilt not hesitate
  to die sword in hand.'</p>

  <p>'Such sort of confidence I do by no means covet: I would rather that thou
  shouldst place it somewhere else. It is true that when I was in the service
  of the most noble Gallienus&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Well, we will spare thee the trouble of that story. I believe I do thy
  virtues no injustice. Moreover, the less talk, the more speed.'</p>

  <p>Saying this, in order that I might be left to my own thoughts for a space,
  before I should meet the Jew, we then pressed on, threading our way through a
  maze of streets, where recollection of place and of direction was soon and
  altogether lost. The streets now became narrow, filthy, darker and darker,
  crooked and involved. They were still noisy with the loud voices of the
  inhabitants of the dwellings, calling to each other, quarrelling or laughing,
  with the rattling of vehicles returning home after the labors of the day, and
  with all that variety of deafening sounds which fall upon the ear where great
  numbers of a poor and degraded population are crowded together into confined
  quarters. Suddenly leaving what seemed to be a sort of principal street, our
  guide turned down into an obscure lane, which, though extremely narrow and
  crooked, was better built than the streets we had just left. Stopping now
  before what seemed a long and low white wall, our guide, descending a few
  steps, brought us to the principal entrance of the dwelling, for such we
  found it to be. Applying a stone to the door, to arouse those who might be
  within, we were immediately answered in a voice which I at once recognised as
  that of Isaac:</p>

  <p>'Break not in the door,' shouted he, 'with your unmannerly blows. Who are
  you, that one must live standing with his hand on the latch of the door? Wait
  say, till I can have time to walk the length of the room. What can the
  Gentiles of Palmyra want of Isaac of Rome at this time of night?' So
  muttering, he unbarred and opened the door.</p>

  <p>'Come in, come in: the house of Isaac is but a poor house of a poor Jew,
  but it has a welcome for all. Come in&mdash;come&mdash;. But, father Abraham!
  whom have we here? The most noble Piso! A patrician of Rome in the hovel of a
  poverty-pinched Jew! That would sound well upon the exchange. It may be of
  account. But what am I saying? Welcome to Palmyra, most noble Piso, for
  Palmyra is one of my homes; at Rome, and at Antioch, and Alexandria, and
  Ctesiphon, and Carthage&mdash;it is the same to Isaac. Pray seat yourselves;
  upon this chair thou wilt find a secure seat, though it promises not so much,
  and here upon my dromedary's furniture is another. So, now we are well. Would
  that I had that flask of soft Palmyrene, which but now I sent&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Take no trouble for our sakes,'I exclaimed, cordially saluting him; 'I am
  just now come from the table of Gracchus. I have matters of more moment to
  discuss than either meats or wines.'</p>

  <p>'But, noble master, hast thou ever brought to thy lips this same soft
  Palmyrene? The name indicates some delicious juice.'</p>

  <p>'Peace, Milo, or thou goest home alone, as thou best canst.'</p>

  <p>'Roman,' began Isaac,'I can think only of two reasons that can have
  brought thee to my poor abode so soon; the one is to furnish thyself with
  more of that jewelry which gave thee so much delight, and the other to
  discourse with me concerning the faith of Moses. Much as I love a bargain, I
  hope it is for the last that thou art come; for I would fain see thee in a
  better way than thou art, or than thou wouldst be if that smooth Probus
  should gain thy ear. Heed not the wily Nazarene! I cannot deny him a good
  heart, after what I saw of him in Carthage. But who is he, to take it upon
  him to sit in judgment upon the faith of two thousand years? Would that I
  could once see him in the grasp of Simon Ben Gorah! How would his heresy
  wither and die before the learning of that son of God. Roman, heed him not!
  Let me take thee to Simon, that thou mayst once in thy life hear the words of
  wisdom.'</p>

  <p>'Not now, not now, good Isaac. Whenever I apostatize from the faith of the
  founders of my nation, and deny the gods who for more than a thousand years
  have stood guardians over Rome, I will not refuse to weigh whatever the Jew
  has to offer in behalf of his ancient creed. But I come to thee now neither
  to buy of thee, nor to learn truth of thee, but to seek aid in a matter that
  lies near my heart.'</p>

  <p>'Ha! thy heathen god Cupid has ensnared thee! Well, well, the young must
  be humored, and men must marry. It was the counsel of my father, whose beard
  came lower than his girdle, and than whom the son of Sirach had not more
  wisdom, "Meddle not nor make in the loves of others. God only knoweth the
  heart. And how knowest thou that, in contriving happiness, thou shalt not
  engender sorrow?" Howbeit, in many things have I departed from the counsel of
  that venerable man. Alas for it! Had my feet taken hold, in all their goings,
  of his steps, I had not now for my only companion my fleet-footed dromedary,
  and for my only wealth this load of gilded toys,'</p>

  <p>'Neither is it,'I rejoined, 'for any love-sickness that I am come, seeking
  some healing or inflaming drug, but upon a matter of somewhat more moment.
  Listen to me, while I unfold.'</p>

  <p>So saying, I told all that you already so well know in as few words as I
  could, but leaving out no argument by which I could hope to work upon either
  the cupidity, the benevolence, or the patriotism of the Jew. He, with his
  hands folded under his beard, listened without once interrupting me, but with
  an expression of countenance so stolid, that when I had ended I could guess
  no better than when I began as to the part he would act.</p>

  <p>After a pause of some length, he slowly began, discoursing rather with
  himself than with me: 'A large enterprise&mdash;and to be largely considered.
  The way is long&mdash;seven hundred Roman miles at the least&mdash;and among
  little other than savage tribes, save here and there a desert, where the
  sands, as is reported, rise and fall like the sea. How can an old man like me
  encounter such labor and peril? These unbelieving heathen think not so much
  of the life of a Jew as of a dog. Gentile, why goest thou not thyself?'</p>

  <p>'Thy skill, Isaac, and knowledge of men and countries, are more than mine,
  and will stand thee in good stead. Death were the certain issue, were I to
  venture upon this expedition, and then my brother's fate were sealed
  forever.'</p>

  <p>'I seem to thee, Roman Piso, to be a lone man in a wide world, who may
  live or die, and there be none to know or care how it is. It is verily much
  so. Yet I was not always alone. Children once leaped at the sound of my
  voice, and clung in sport to my garment. They are in Abraham's
  bosom,&mdash;better than here. Yet, Roman, I am not alone. The God of Israel
  is with me, and while it is him I serve, life is not without value. I trust
  in the coming restoration of Jerusalem: for that I toil, and for that I am
  ready to die. But why should my bones whiten the desert, or my mangled
  carcass swing upon a Persian gibbet? Will that be to die for my country?'</p>

  <p>'I can enrich thee for thy services, Jew, and thou sayest that it is for
  wealth, that it may be poured into the general coffers of thy tribe, that
  thou traversest the globe. Name thy sum, and so it be not beyond reason, I
  will be bound to pay thee in good Roman coin.'</p>

  <p>'This is to be thought of. Doubtless thou wouldst reward me well. But
  consider how large this sum must be. I fear me thou wilt shrink from the
  payment of it, for a Roman noble loves not money less than a poor Jew. My
  trade in Ctesiphon I lose. That must be made up. My faithful dromedary will
  be worn out by the long journey: that too must be made good. My plan will
  require an attendant slave and camel: then there, are the dangers of the
  way&mdash;the risk of life in the city of the Great King&mdash;and, if it be
  not cut off, the expenses of it. These, to Isaac, are not great, but I may be
  kept there long.'</p>

  <p>'But thou wilt abate somewhat of the sum thou hast determined upon, out of
  love to thy kind. Is the pleasure of doing a good deed nothing to thee?'</p>

  <p>'Not a jot will I abate from a just sum&mdash;not a jot.' And why should
  I? And thou art not in earnest to ask the abatement of a feather's weight.
  What doth the Jew owe the Roman? What hath the Roman done to the Jew? He hath
  laid waste his country with fire and sword. Her towns and villages he hath
  levelled with the ground. The holy Jerusalem he hath spoiled and defiled, and
  then driven the plough over its ruins. My people are scattered abroad among
  all nations&mdash;subject every where to persecution and death. This thou
  knowest is what the Roman hath done. And what then owe I, a Jew&mdash;a
  Jew&mdash;to the Roman? I bear thee, Piso, no ill will; nay, I love thee; but
  wert thou Rome, and this wheaten straw a dagger, it should find thy heart!
  Nay, start not; I would not hurt a hair of thy head. But tell me now if thou
  agreest to my terms: one gold talent of Jerusalem if I return alive with or
  without thy brother, and if I perish, two, to be paid as I shall direct.'</p>

  <p>'Most heartily, Isaac, do I agree to them, and bless thee more than words
  can tell, besides. Bring back my brother alive, and whatsoever thou shalt
  desire more, shall be freely thine.'</p>

  <p>'I am content. To-morrow then I turn my back upon Ctesiphon and Palmyra,
  and make for Ecbatana. Of my progress thou shalt learn. Of success I am
  sure&mdash;that is, if thy brother hearken to the invitation.</p>

  <p>Then giving such instructions as might be necessary on my part, we
  separated.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="letter04"
     id="letter04">LETTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IF the gods, dear Marcus and Lucilia, came down to dwell
upon earth, they
  could not but choose Palmyra for their seat, both on account of the general
  beauty of the city and its surrounding plains, and the exceeding sweetness
  and serenity of its climate. It is a joy here only to sit still and live. The
  air, always loaded with perfume, seems to convey essential nutriment to those
  who breathe it; and its hue, especially when a morning or evening sun shines
  through it, is of that golden cast, which, as poets feign, bathes the tops of
  Olympus. Never do we tremble here before blasts like those which from the
  Appenines sweep along the plains and cities of the Italian coast. No extremes
  of either heat or cold are experienced in this happy spot. In winter, airs,
  which in other places equally far to the north would come bearing with them
  an icy coldness, are here tempered by the vast deserts of sand which stretch
  away in every direction, and which it is said never wholly lose the heat
  treasured up during the fierce reign of the summer sun. And in summer, the
  winds which as they pass over the deserts are indeed like the breath of a
  furnace, long before they reach the city change to a cool and refreshing
  breeze by traversing as they do the vast tracts of cultivated ground, which,
  as I have already told you, surround the capital to a very great extent on
  every side. Palmyra is the very heaven of the body. Every sense is fed to the
  full with that which it chiefly covets.</p>

  <p>But when I add to this, that its unrivalled position, in respect to a
  great inland traffic, has poured into the lap of its inhabitants a sudden and
  boundless flood of wealth, making every merchant a prince, you will truly
  suppose, that however heartily I extol it for its outward beauties, and all
  the appliances of luxury, I do not conceive it very favorable in its
  influences upon the character of its population. Palmyrenes, charming as they
  are, are not Romans. They are enervated by riches, and the luxurious sensual
  indulgences which they bring along by necessity in their train&mdash;all
  their evil power being here increased by the voluptuous softness of the
  climate. I do not say that all are so. All Rome cannot furnish a woman more
  truly Roman than Fausta, nor a man more worthy that name than Gracchus. It is
  of the younger portion of the inhabitants I now speak. These are without
  exception effeminate. They love their country, and their great queen, but
  they are not a defence upon which in time of need to rely. Neither do I deny
  them courage. They want something more vital still&mdash;bodily strength and
  martial training. Were it not for this, I should almost fear for the issue of
  any encounter between Rome and Palmyra. But as it is, notwithstanding the
  great achievements of Odenatus and Zenobia, I cannot but deem the glory of
  this state to have risen to its highest point, and even to have passed it.
  You may think me to be hasty in forming this opinion, but I am persuaded you
  will agree with me when you shall have seen more at length the grounds upon
  which I rest it, as they are laid down in my last letter to Portia.</p>

  <p>But I did not mean to say these things when I sat down to my tablets, but
  rather to tell you of myself, and what I have seen and done since I last
  wrote. I have experienced and enjoyed much. How indeed could it be otherwise,
  in the house of Gracchus, and with Gracchus and Fausta for my companions?
  Many are the excursions we have together taken into the country, to the
  neighboring hills whence the city derives its ample supply of water, and even
  to the very borders of the desert. I have thus seen much of this people, of
  their pursuits, and modes of life, and I have found that whether they have
  been of the original Palmyrene population&mdash;Persian or Parthian
  emigrants&mdash;Jews, Arabians, or even Romans&mdash;they agree in one thing,
  love of their queen, and in a determination to defend her and her capital to
  the last extremity, whether against the encroachments of Persia or Rome,
  Independence is their watchword. They have already shown, in a manner the
  most unequivocal, and to themselves eternally honorable, that they will not
  be the slaves of Sapor, nor dependents upon his power. And in that they have
  given at the same time the clearest proof of their kindly feeling toward us,
  and of their earnest desire to live at peace with us. I truly hope that no
  extravagances on the part of the Queen, or her too-ambitious advisers, will
  endanger the existing tranquillity; yet from a late occurrence of which I was
  myself a witness among other excited thousands, I am filled with
  apprehensions.</p>

  <p>That to which I allude, happened at the great amphitheatre, during an
  exhibition of games given by Zenobia on the occasion of her return, in which
  the Palmyrenes, especially those of Roman descent, take great delight. I
  care, as you know, nothing for them, nor only that, abhor them for their
  power to imbrute the people accustomed to their spectacles more and more. In
  this instance I was persuaded by Fausta and Gracchus to attend, as I should
  see both the Queen and her subjects under favorable circumstances to obtain
  new knowledge of their characters; and I am not sorry to have been there.</p>

  <p>The show could boast all the magnificence of Rome. Nothing could exceed
  the excitement and tumult of the city. Its whole population was abroad to
  partake of the general joy. Early in the day the streets began to be thronged
  with the multitudes who were either pouring along toward the theatre, to
  secure in season the best seats, or with eager curiosity pressing after the
  cages of wild animals drawn by elephants or camels toward the place of combat
  and slaughter. As a part of this throng, I found myself, seated between
  Gracchus and Fausta, in their most sumptuous chariot, themselves arrayed in
  their most sumptuous attire. Our horses could scarcely do more than walk, and
  were frequently obliged to stand still, owing to the crowds of men on horse,
  on foot, and in vehicles of every sort, which filled the streets. The roaring
  of the imprisoned animals, the loud voices of their keepers, and of the
  drivers of the cumbrous wagons which held them, the neighing, or screaming I
  might say, of the affrighted horses every now and then brought into immediate
  contact with the wild beasts of the forests, lions, tigers or leopards, made
  a scene of confusion, the very counterpart of what we have so often witnessed
  in Rome, which always pains more than it pleases me, and which I now describe
  at all, only that you may believe what Romans are so slow to believe, that
  there are other cities in the world where great actions are done as well as
  in their own. The inhabitants of Palmyra are as quick as you could desire
  them to be, in catching the vices and fashions of the great metropolis.</p>

  <p>'Scipio, Scipio,' cried Gracchus suddenly to his charioteer, 'be not in
  too great haste. It is in vain to attempt to pass that wagon, nay, unless you
  shall be a little more reserved in your approaches, the paw of that tawny
  Numidian will find its way to the neck of our favorite Arab. The bars of his
  cage are over far apart.'</p>

  <p>'I almost wish they were yet farther apart,' said I, 'and that he might
  fairly find his way into the thickest of this foolish crowd, and take a short
  revenge upon his civilized tormentors. What a spectacle is this&mdash;more
  strange and savage, I think, looked upon aright, than that which we are going
  to enjoy&mdash;of you, Gracchus, a pillar of a great kingdom; of me, a
  pillar&mdash;a lesser one, indeed, but still a pillar&mdash;of a greater
  kingdom; and of you, Fausta, a woman, all on our way to see wild beasts let
  loose to lacerate and destroy each other, and what is worse, gladiators, that
  is, educated murderers, set upon one another, to die for our entertainment.
  The best thing I have heard of the Christian superstition is, that it utterly
  denounces and prohibits to its disciples the frequenting of these shows.
  Nothing to me is plainer than that we may trace the cruelties of Marius,
  Sylla, and their worthy imitators through the long line of our Emperors, to
  these schools where they had their early training. Why were Domitian and his
  fly worse than Gracchus, or Piso, or Fausta, and their gored elephant, or
  dying gladiator?'</p>

  <p>'You take this custom too seriously,' replied Gracchus. 'I see in it, so
  far as the beasts are concerned, but a lawful source of pleasure. If they
  tore not one another in pieces for our entertainment, they would still do it
  for their own, in their native forests; and if it must be done, it were a
  pity none enjoyed it. Then for the effects upon the beholding crowd, I am
  inclined to think they are rather necessary and wholesome than otherwise.
  They help to render men insensible to danger, suffering, and death; and as we
  are so often called upon to fight each other, and die in defence of our
  liberties, or of our tyrants and oppressors, whichever it may be, it seems to
  me we are in need of some such initiatory process in the art of seeing blood
  shed unmoved, and of some lessons which shall diminish our love and regard
  for life. As for the gladiators, they are wretches who are better dead than
  alive; and to die in the excitement of a combat is not worse, perhaps, than
  to expire through the slow and lingering assaults of a painful disease.
  Besides, with us there is never, as with you, cool and deliberate murder
  perpetrated on the part of the assembly. There is here no turning up of the
  thumb. It is all honorable fighting, and honorable killing. What, moreover,
  shall be done to entertain the people? We must feed them with some such
  spectacles, or I verily think they would turn upon each other for amusement,
  in civil broil and slaughter.'</p>

  <p>'Your Epicurean philosophy teaches you, I am aware,' said I in reply, 'to
  draw happiness as you best can from all the various institutions of
  Providence and of man&mdash;not to contend but to receive, and submit, and be
  thankful. It is a philosophy well enough for man's enjoyment of the passing
  hour, but it fatally obstructs, it appears to me, the way of improvement. For
  my own part, though I am no philosopher, yet I hold to this, that whatever
  our reason proves to be wrong or defective, it at the same time enforces the
  duty of change and reform&mdash;that no palpable evil, either in life or
  government, is to be passively submitted to as incurable. In these spectacles
  I behold an enormous wrong, a terrific evil; and though I see not how the
  wrong is to be redressed, nor the evil to be removed, I none the less, but so
  much the more, conceive it to be my part, as a man and a citizen, to think
  and converse, as now, upon the subject, in the hope that some new light may
  dawn upon its darkness. What think you, Fausta? I hope you agree with
  me&mdash;nay, as to that, I think Gracchus, from his tone, was but half in
  earnest.'</p>

  <p>'It has struck me chiefly,' said Fausta, 'as a foolish custom; not so much
  in itself very wrong, as childish. It is to me indeed attended with pain, but
  that I suppose is a weakness of my own&mdash;it seems not to be so in the
  case of others. I have thought it a poor, barren entertainment, fit but for
  children, and those grown children whose minds, uninstructed in higher
  things, must seek their happiness in some spring of mere sensual joy. Women
  frequent the amphitheatre, I am sure, rather to make a show of their beauty,
  their dress, and equipage, than for any thing else; and they would, I
  believe, easily give in to any change, so it should leave them an equally
  fair occasion of display. But so far as attending the spectacles tends to
  make better soldiers, and stouter defenders of our Queen, I confess, Lucius,
  I look upon them with some favor. But come, our talk is getting to be a
  little too grave. Look, Lucius, if this be not a brave sight? See what a mass
  of life encompasses the circus! And its vast walls, from the lowest entrances
  to its very summit, swarm as it were with the whole population of Palmyra. It
  is not so large a building as your Flavian, but it is not wholly unworthy to
  be compared with it.'</p>

  <p>It is not, indeed,' said I; 'although not so large, its architecture is
  equally in accordance with the best principles, both of science and taste,
  and the stone is of a purer white, and more finely worked.'</p>

  <p>We now descended from our carriage, and made our way through the narrow
  passages and up the narrow stairways to the interior of the theatre, which
  was already much more than half filled. The seats to which we were conducted
  were not far from those which were to be occupied by the Queen and her train.
  I need not tell you how the time was passed which intervened between taking
  our seats, the filling of the theatre, and the commencement of the
  games&mdash;how we all were amused by the fierce smugglings of those who most
  wished to exhibit themselves, for the best places; by the efforts of many to
  cause themselves to be recognised by those who were of higher rank than
  themselves, and to avoid the neighborhood and escape the notice of others
  whose acquaintance would bring them no credit; how we laughed at the awkward
  movements and labors of the servants of the circus, who were busying
  themselves in giving its final smoothness to the saw-dust and hurrying
  through the last little offices of so vast a preparation, urged on
  continually by the voices or lashes of the managers of the games; nor how our
  ears were deafened by the fearful yellings of the maddened beasts confined in
  the vivaria, the grated doors of which opened, as in the Roman buildings of
  the same kind, immediately on the arena. Neither will I inflict weariness
  upon myself or you, by a detailed account of the kind and order of the games
  at this time exhibited for the entertainment of the people. The whole show
  was an exact copy from the usages of Rome. I could hardly believe myself in
  the heart of Asia. Touching only on these things so familiar to you, I will
  relate what I was able to observe of the Queen and her demeanor, about which
  I know you will feel chiefly desirous of information.</p>

  <p>It was not till after the games had been some time in progress, and the
  wrestlers and mock-fighters having finished their foolish feats, the combats
  of wild animals with each other had commenced, that a herald announced by
  sound of trumpet the approach of the Queen. The moment that sound, and the
  loud clang of martial music which followed it, was heard, every eye of the
  vast multitude was turned to the part of the circus where we were sitting,
  and near which was the passage by which Zenobia would enter the theatre. The
  animals now tore each other piecemeal, unnoticed by the impatient throng. A
  greater care possessed them. And no sooner did the object of this universal
  expectation reveal herself to their sight, led to her seat by the dark
  Zabdas, followed by the Princess Julia and Longinus, and accompanied by a
  crowd of the rank and beauty of Palmyra, than one enthusiastic cry of loyalty
  and affection rent the air, drowning all other sounds, and causing the silken
  canopy of the amphitheatre to sway to and fro as if shaken by a tempest. The
  very foundations of the huge structure seemed to tremble in their places.
  With what queenly dignity, yet with what enchanting sweetness, did the great
  Zenobia acknowledge the greetings of her people! The color of her cheek
  mounted and fell again, even as it would have done in a young girl, and
  glances full of sensibility and love went from her to every part of the
  boundless interior, and seemed to seek out every individual and to each make
  a separate return for the hearty welcome with which she had been received.
  These mutual courtesies being quickly ended, the games again went on, and
  every eye was soon riveted on the arena where animals were contending with
  each other or with men.</p>

  <p>The multitude being thus intently engaged, those who chose to employ their
  time differently were left at full liberty to amuse themselves with
  conversation or otherwise, as it pleased them. Many a fat and unwieldy
  citizen we saw soundly sleeping in spite of the roarings of the beasts and
  the shouts of the spectators. Others, gathering together in little societies
  of their own, passed all the intervals between the games, as well as the time
  taken up by games which gave them no pleasure, in discussing with one another
  the fashions, the news, or the politics of the day. Of these parties we were
  one; for neither Gracchus, nor Fausta, nor I, cared much for the sports of
  the day, and there were few foolish or wise things that were not uttered by
  one of as during the continuance of those tedious, never-ending games.</p>

  <p>'Well, Lucius,' said Fausta, 'and what think you now of our great Queen?
  For the last half hour your eyes having scarcely wandered from her, you must
  by this time be prepared with an opinion.'</p>

  <p>'There can be little interest,' said I, 'in hearing an opinion on a
  subject about which all the world is agreed. I can only say, what all say. I
  confess I have never before seen a woman. I am already prepared to love and
  worship her with you, for I am sure that such pre-eminent beauty exists in
  company with a goodness that corresponds to it. Her intellect too we know is
  not surpassed in strength by that of any philosopher of the East. These
  things being so, where in the world can we believe there is a woman to be
  compared with her? As for Cleopatra, she is not worthy to be named.'</p>

  <p>As I uttered these things with animation and vehemence, showing I suppose
  in my manner how deeply I felt all that I said, I perceived Fausta's fine
  countenance glowing with emotion, and tears of gratified affection standing
  in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Gracchus spoke. 'Piso,' said he,'I do not wonder at the enthusiastic
  warmth of your language. Chilled as my blood is by the approaches of age, I
  feel even as you do: nay, I suppose I feel much more; for to all your
  admiration, as a mere philosophical observer, there is added in my case the
  fervid attachment which springs from long and intimate knowledge, and from an
  intercourse, which not the coolness of a single hour has ever interrupted. It
  would be strange indeed if there were not one single flaw in so bright an
  emanation from the very soul of the divinity, wearing as it does the form of
  humanity. I allude to her ambition. It is boundless, almost insane. Caesar
  himself was not more ambitious. But in her even this is partly a virtue, even
  in its wildest extravagance; for it is never for herself alone that she
  reaches so far and so high, but as much or more for her people. She never
  separates herself from them, even in thought, and all her aspirings are, that
  she herself may be great indeed, but that her country may with and through
  her be great also, and her people happy. When I see her as now surrounded by
  her subjects, and lodged in their very heart of hearts, I wish&mdash;and
  fervently would I pray, were there gods to implore&mdash;that her restless
  spirit may be at peace, and that she may seek no higher good either for
  herself or her people than that which we now enjoy. But I confess myself to
  be full of apprehension. I tremble for my country. And yet here is my little
  rebel, Fausta, who will not hearken to this, but adds the fuel of her own
  fiery spirit to feed that of her great mistress. It were beyond a doubt a
  good law which should exclude women from any part in public affairs.'</p>

  <p>'Dear father, how do you remind me of the elder Cato, in the matter of the
  Oppian Law: while women interfered in public affairs, only to promote the
  interests of their worthy husbands, the lords of the world, the great Cato
  had never thought but to commend them; but no sooner did they seek to secure
  some privileges very dear to them as women, and clamor a little in order to
  obtain them, than straightway they were nuisances in the body politic, and
  ought to be restrained by enactments from having any voice in the business of
  the state. Truly I think this is far from generous treatment. And happy am I,
  for one, that at length the gods in their good providence have permitted that
  one woman should arise to vindicate her sex against the tyranny of their
  ancient oppressors and traducers. If I might appoint to the spirits of the
  departed their offices, I could wish nothing merrier than that that same Cato
  should be made the news-carrier from the kingdom of Zenobia to the council of
  the gods. How he would enjoy his occupation! But seriously, dear father, I
  see not that our Queen has any more of this same ambition than men are in a
  similar position permitted to have, and accounted all the greater for it. Is
  that a vice in Zenobia which is a glory in Aurelian? Longinus would not
  decide so. Observe how intent the Queen is upon the games.</p>

  <p>'I would rather,' said I, 'that she should not gaze upon so cruel a sight.
  But see! the Princess Julia has hidden her head in the folds of her
  veil.'</p>

  <p>'Julia's heart,' said Fausta, 'is even tenderer than a woman's. Besides,
  if I mistake not, she has on this point at least adopted some of the notions
  of the Christians. Paul of Antioch has not been without his power over her.
  And truly his genius is well nigh irresistible. A stronger intellect than
  hers might without shame yield to his. Look, look!&mdash;the elephant will
  surely conquer after all. The gods grant he may! He is a noble creature; but
  how cruelly beset! Three such foes are too much for a fair battle. How he has
  wreathed his trunk round that tiger, and now whirls him in the air! But the
  rhinoceros sees his advantage: quick&mdash;quick!'</p>

  <p>Fausta, too, could not endure the savage sight, but turned her head away;
  for the huge rhinoceros, as the elephant lifted the tiger from the ground, in
  the act to dash him again to the earth, seized the moment, and before the
  noble animal could recover himself, buried his enormous tusk deep in his
  vitals. It was fatal to both, for the assailant, unable to extricate his
  horn, was crushed through every bone in his body, by the weight of the
  falling elephant. A single tiger remained master of the field, who now
  testified his joy by coursing round and round the arena.</p>

  <p>'Well, well,' said Gracchus, 'they would have died in the forest; what
  signifies it? But why is this blast of trumpets? It is the royal flourish!
  Ah! I see how it is; the sons of Zenobia, whom none miss not being present,
  are about to enter the theatre. They make amends by the noise of their
  approach for their temporary absence. Yet these distant shouts are more than
  usual. The gods grant that none of my fears may turn true!'</p>

  <p>No sooner had Gracchus ended these words, while his face grew pale with
  anxious expectation, than suddenly the three sons of the Queen made their
  appearance, and&mdash;how shall I say it?&mdash;arrayed in imperial purple,
  and habited in all respects as Caesars. It seemed to me as if at that very
  moment the pillars of this flourishing empire crumbled to their foundation.
  And now while I write, and the heat of that moment is passed, I cannot but
  predict disaster and ruin, at least fierce and desolating wars, as the
  consequence of the rash act. I know the soul of Aurelian, and that it will
  never brook what it shall so much as dream to be an indignity&mdash;never
  endure so much as the thought of rivalry in another, whether Roman or
  foreigner, man or woman. To think it is treason with him&mdash;a crime for
  which blood only can atone.</p>

  <p>Having entered thus the amphitheatre, assuming a high and haughty bearing,
  as if they were already masters of the world, they advanced to the front
  railing, and there received the tumultuous acclamations of the people. A
  thousand different cries filled the air. Each uttered the sentiment which
  possessed him, regardless of all but testifying loyalty and devotion to the
  reigning house. Much of the language was directed against Rome, which, since
  the circulation of the rumors of which I have already spoken, has become the
  object of their most jealous regard. Aurelian's name was coupled with every
  term of reproach. 'Is Aurelian to possess the, whole earth?' cried one. 'Who
  are Romans?' cried another; 'the story of Valerian shows that they are not
  invincible.' 'We will put Zabdas and Zenobia against the world!' shouted
  others.' 'The conqueror of Egypt forever!&mdash;long live the great Zabdas!'
  rose from every quarter. It were in vain to attempt to remember or write down
  half the violent things which in this hour of madness were uttered. The games
  were for a long time necessarily suspended, and the whole amphitheatre was
  converted into an arena of political discussion, from which arose the
  confused din of unnumbered voices, like the roar of the angry ocean. I looked
  at Zenobia; she was calm&mdash;satisfied. Pride was upon her lip and brow. So
  like a god was the expression of her whole form, that for a moment I almost
  wished her mistress of the world. She seemed worthy to reign. Julia was
  evidently sad, and almost distressed; Longinus, impenetrable as marble;
  Zabdas, black and lowering as night.</p>

  <p>Quiet was at length restored, and the games went on.</p>

  <p>A messenger came now from the Queen to our seat, with the request that
  Fausta should join her, not being satisfied with the distant intercourse of
  looks and signs, So, accompanied by Gracchus, she was soon placed by the side
  of Zenobia, whose happiness seemed doubled by the society of, I believe, her
  choicest friend. Left now to myself, I had leisure to think and to observe. A
  more gorgeous show than this vast assembly presented, I think I never before
  beheld&mdash;no, not even in the Flavian. Although in Rome we seem to draw
  together people of all regions and all climes, yet after all the North and
  West preponderate, and we lack the gayer costumes which a larger proportion
  of these Orientals would add to our spectacles. Not to say too, that here in
  the East the beauty of woman is more transcendent, and the forms of the men
  cast in a finer mould. Every variety of complexion is here also to be seen,
  from the jet black of the slender Ethiopian, to the more than white of the
  women of the Danube. Here I saw before me, in one promiscuous throng, arrayed
  in their national dresses, Persians, dark-skinned Indians, swarthy Egyptians,
  the languishing, soft-eyed Syrian, nymphs from the borders of the Caspian,
  women of the Jews from the shores of the Mediterranean, Greeks from Asia
  Minor, the Islands, and Attica, with their classic costume and statue-like
  forms and faces, Romans, and, abounding over all and more beautiful than all,
  the richly- habited nobles and gentry of Palmyra itself. I enjoyed the scene
  as a man and a philosopher; nay, as a Roman too: and could not but desire
  earnestly, that the state, of whose prosperity it was so clear a token, might
  last even with Rome itself. I wished you and Lucilia at my side&mdash;not to
  mention the little Gallus&mdash;not, as you may believe, to witness the
  games, but to behold in this remote centre of Asia so fair a show of our
  common race.</p>

  <p>It was not till the sun was already about to sink in the west, that the
  games ended, and the crowds dispersed, and I once more found myself in the
  peaceful precincts of home; for so already do I call the hospitable dwelling
  of Gracchus.</p>

  <p>'So, Fausta,' said I, 'you forsook your old friend Lucius for the
  companionship of a queen? Truly I cannot blame you, for most gladly would I
  too have gone and made one of your circle. How irksome are the forms and
  restraints of station, and even of society! how little freedom do they allow
  in the expression of our real sentiments! Could I have sat with you by
  Zenobia, can I doubt that by a frank disclosure of my feelings and opinions,
  I could have corrected some errors, softened some prejudices, and at the same
  time gained her esteem&mdash;her esteem for me, I mean, as a sincere
  well-wisher to her kingdom, although none the less a Roman? It would have
  been a fortunate moment for such communication as I desire. I trust yet,
  seeing such a promise has gone forth from you, to see her in her own
  palace.'</p>

  <p>'Indeed you shall,' said Fausta; 'it has only been owing to fatigue, after
  her long excursion, and to this show of games, that you have not seen her
  long before this. She is well aware of your rank and footing of intimacy with
  Aurelian, and of the object for which you make this visit to her capital, and
  has expressed frequent and earnest desires of an interview with you. And now
  have I a great mind not to tell you of the speedy pleasure and honor that
  await you. What will you give to know the tenor of what I have to say?'</p>

  <p>'I will confer the greatest honor in my power,' said I: 'I will dislodge
  the Emperor from my own finger and replace him upon yours. Here I offer you
  the head of Aurelian&mdash;cut, not indeed by the cunning tool of Demetrius
  of Rome, but doubtless by some competent artist. Is it not a fair offer,
  Gracchus?'</p>

  <p>'I fear unless you make a different and a better one, you will scarce open
  the lips of our fierce patriot,' answered Gracchus.</p>

  <p>'That will he not,' said Fausta; 'were he to engage by to-morrow to make
  himself over into a veritable, sound-hearted, queen-loving Palmyrene, it
  would not be more than he ought to do. I am sure, old Solon toiled hard to
  make a Roman out of me, and how do I know but it was at your instance? And it
  having been so, as I must believe, what less can you do in atonement than to
  plant yourself here upon the soil of Palmyra? A Roman, trust me, takes quick
  root in this rich earthy and soon shoots up and spreads out into a perfectly
  proportioned Palmyrene, tall and beautiful as a date tree. Father, how can we
  bribe him? You shake your head as if without hope. Well, let us wait till
  Calpurnius returns; when you find him an Oriental, perhaps you may be induced
  to emigrate too. Surely it is no such great matter to remove from Rome to
  Palmyra. We do not ask you to love Rome any the less, but only Palmyra more.
  I still trust we shall ever dwell in friendship with each other. We certainly
  must desire it, who are half Roman. But why do I keep you in such painful
  suspense? Hear, then, my message, which is, that you will appear at the
  palace of Zenobia to-morrow. The Queen desires a private interview with you,
  and for that purpose will receive no other visiters. Her messenger will in
  the morning apprize you of the hour, and conduct you to the palace! Ah! I see
  by your countenance how delighted you are. It is no wonder.'</p>

  <p>'I am delighted, indeed,' said I; 'that is a part of my feeling, but not
  the whole of it. I cannot, accustomed even as I have been to associate with
  the high in rank and intellect in various countries, without some inward
  perturbation, think of meeting for the first time so remarkable a person; one
  whose name is known not only throughout Asia, but the world; and whose genius
  and virtues are the theme of universal wonder and praise. Then, Fausta,
  Zenobia is a woman, and a woman inspires an awe which man never does; and
  what is more yet, she is of a marvellous beauty, and before that most perfect
  work of the gods, a beautiful woman, I am apt to be awkward and dumb; at the
  least&mdash;which perhaps is it&mdash;-made to think too much of myself to
  acquit myself well. You may think that I exaggerate these feelings. Possibly
  I do. Certainly they are not of such strength that I do not gladly seize upon
  the favor thus extended, and count myself honored and happy.'</p>

  <p>'Where, Lucius, tell me where you learned this new dialect, which runs so
  sweetly when woman is the theme. Sure am I, it is not Roman, Ovid has it not.
  Nor yet is it Palmyrene. Do we owe it to a rich invention of your own?'</p>

  <p>'Fausta, I am in earnest in what I have said. It is my own native
  dialect&mdash;instinctive. Therefore laugh not, but give me a lesson how I
  shall deport myself. Remember the lessons I have so many times given you in
  Rome, and now that you have risen into the seat of power, return them as you
  are bound to do.'</p>

  <p>'Now are you both little more than two foolish children, but just escaped
  from the nursery,' cried Gracchus, who had been pacing up and down the
  portico, little heeding, to all appearance, what was going on. 'Lucius, ask
  no advice of that wild school-girl. Listen to me, who am a counsellor, and of
  age, and ought, if I do not, to speak the words of wisdom. Take along with
  thee nothing but thy common sense, and an honest purpose, and then Venus
  herself would not daunt thee, nor Rhadamanthus and the Furies terrify. Forget
  not too, that beneath this exterior covering, first of clothes, and then of
  flesh, there lies enshrined in the breast of Zenobia, as of you and me, a
  human heart, and that this is ever and in all the same, eternally responsive
  to the same notes, by whomsoever struck. This is a great secret. Believe too,
  that in our good Queen this heart is pure as a child's; or, if I may use
  another similitude, and you can understand it, pure as a
  Christian's&mdash;rather, perhaps, as a Christian's ought to be. Take this
  also, that the high tremble to meet the low, as often as the low to meet the
  high. Now ask no more counsel of Fausta, but digest what the oracle has given
  out, and which now for the night is silent,'</p>

  <p>In this sportive mood we separated.</p>

  <p>At the appointed hour on the following day, the expected messenger
  appeared, and announcing the Queen's pleasure that I should attend her at the
  palace, conducted me there with as much of state as if I had been Aurelian's
  ambassador.</p>

  <p>On arriving at the palace, I was ushered into an apartment, not large, but
  of exquisite architecture, finished and furnished in the Persian taste, where
  sat Zenobia and Julia. At the feet of the Queen, and supporting them upon an
  embroidered cushion of silk, there lay crouched a beautiful Indian slave. If
  it was her office to bear that light and pretty burden, it seemed to be her
  pleasure too; for she was ever weaving round it in playful manner her
  jewelled ringers; casting upwards to her mistress frequent glances of most
  affectionate regard.</p>

  <p>'Noble Piso,' said the Queen, after I had approached and saluted her in
  the appointed manner, 'it gives me pleasure to greet one of your ancient name
  in Palmyra, I seem already acquainted with you through my fast friends
  Gracchus and his bright daughter. You have lost nothing, I am sure, in coming
  to us first through their lips; and if any lips are honest and true, it is
  theirs. We welcome you to the city of the desert.'</p>

  <p>'Great Queen,'I replied, 'it is both a pleasure and a pain to find myself
  in your brilliant capital. I left Rome upon a melancholy errand, which I have
  as yet but half accomplished. Till success shall crown it, I can but half
  enjoy the novel scenes, full of interest and beauty, which your kingdom and
  city present. It was to rescue a brother&mdash;if I may speak for one moment
  of myself&mdash;held in captivity since the disaster of Valerian, that I set
  sail from Italy, and am now a dweller in Palmyra, From this point, I
  persuaded myself I could best operate for his deliverance. My first impulse
  was to throw myself at your feet, and ask of you both counsel and aid,'</p>

  <p>'They should have been gladly yours, very heartily yours. It was a foul
  deed of Sapor&mdash;and a sad fate, that of the great Censor, and of your
  father the good Oneius Piso. And yet I see not much that I could have
  done.'</p>

  <p>'Refuse not my thanks,' said I, 'for the expression of so generous
  sentiments. I am sure I should have shared a goodness of which all seem to
  partake, had I thought it right and necessary to appeal to you. But I was
  soon convinced, by the arguments of both Gracchus and Fausta, that my chance
  of success was greater through private than through public enterprise. And
  happy am I to be able to say, that I have found and employed an emissary,
  who, if the business be capable of accomplishment by human endeavors, will
  with more likelihood than any other that could easily be named, accomplish
  it. Aurelian himself could not here do as much nor as well as Isaac of
  Rome.'</p>

  <p>'I believe,' said Zenobia, 'you will readily agree with me in the opinion,
  that Rome has never respected herself so little as in her neglect of Valerian
  and his fellow-sufferers. But for the scathing got from our arm, the proud
  Persian had come out of that encounter with nothing but laurels. We, thanks
  to the bravery and accomplished art of Odenatus, tore off some of those
  laurels, and left upon the body of the Great King the marks of blows which
  smart yet. This Indian girl at my feet was of the household of Sapor&mdash;a
  slave of one of those women of whom we took a tent full. The shame of this
  loss yet rankles deep in the heart of the king. But should Rome have dealt so
  by her good Emperor and her brave soldiers? Ought she to have left it to a
  then new and small power to take vengeance on her mean, base-minded, yet
  powerful foe? It is not even yet too late, methinks, for her to stir herself,
  were it only to rescue one of the noble house of Piso. Perhaps it may be with
  some intent of this kind that we hear rumors of an Asiatic expedition.
  Aurelian, we learn, having weaned himself with victory in Gaul and Germany,
  turns his thoughts towards the East. What can his aim be, if not Persia? But
  I truly rejoice that through efforts of your own you have so good prospect of
  seeing again your captive brother.'</p>

  <p>'I have no knowledge of the purposes of the Roman Emperor,'I replied, 'but
  such as is common to all. Though honored with the friendship of Aurelian, I
  am not a political confidant. I can only conjecture touching his designs,
  from my acquaintance with his character, and the features of the policy he
  has adopted and avowed as that which is to govern his administration. And
  this policy is that which has been acted upon by so many of those who before
  him have been raised to the head of our nation, namely this, that, west of
  the Euphrates to the farthest limits of Spain and Gaul, embracing all the
  shores of the Mediterranean, with their thickly scattered nations, there
  shall be but one empire, and of that one empire but one head. It is the fixed
  purpose of Aurelian to restore to the empire, the unity by which it was
  distinguished and blessed under the two Antonines. And already his movements
  in Gaul show that his practice is to conform to his theory. I feel that you
  will pardon, nay, that you will commend me for the plainness with which I
  impart such knowledge as I may possess. It will be to me the dearest
  happiness, if I can subserve in any way, consistently with my duty to Rome,
  the interests of Palmyra and her Queen.'</p>

  <p>'Roman,' said Zenobia in reply, 'I honor your frankness, and thank you for
  your faith in my generosity. It is not, I assure you, misplaced. I am glad to
  know from so authentic a source the policy of Aurelian. I surmised as much
  before. All that I have thought, will come true. The rumors which are afloat
  are not without foundation. Your emperor understands that I have a policy as
  well as he, and a fixed purpose as well as he. I will never fall from what I
  have been, but into ruin final and complete. I have lived a sovereign Queen,
  and so I will die. The son of Valerian received Odenatus and Zenobia as
  partners in empire. We were representatives of Rome in the East. Our
  dignities and our titles were those of Gallienus. It were small boasting to
  say that they were worn not less worthily here than in Rome. And this
  association with Rome&mdash;I sought it not. It was offered as a tribute to
  our greatness. Shall it be dissolved at the will of Aurelian?&mdash;and
  Palmyra, no longer needed as a scourge for the Great King, be broken down
  into a tributary province, an obscure appendage of your greatness? May the
  gods forsake me that moment I am false to my country! I too am ambitious, as
  well as Aurelian. And let him be told, that I stipulate for a full
  partnership of the Roman power&mdash;my sons to bear the name and rank of
  Caesar&mdash;or the tie which unites Palmyra to Rome is at once and forever
  sundered, and she stands before the world an independent kingdom, to make
  good as she may, by feats of arms, her claim to that high dignity; and the
  arms which have prevailed from the Nile to the shores of the Caspian, from
  the Euphrates to the Mediterranean, and have triumphed more than once over
  the pride and power of Persia, may be trusted in any encounter, if the fates
  should so ordain, with even Rome herself. The conqueror of Egypt would, I
  believe, run a not ignoble tilt with the conqueror of a Gallic province.'</p>

  <p>'Dearest mother,' said the Princess Julia, in a voice full of earnest
  entreaty, 'do not, do not give way to such thoughts. Heed not these lying
  rumors. Trust in the magnanimity of Aurelian. We make the virtue we believe
  in. Let it not reach his ears that you have doubted him. I can see no reason
  why he should desire to disturb the harmony that has so long
  reigned&mdash;and Aurelian is no madman. What could he gain by a warlike
  expedition, which a few words could not gain? Noble Piso, if your great
  emperor would but speak before he acts&mdash;if indeed any purpose like that
  which is attributed to him has entered his mind&mdash;a world of evil, and
  suffering, and crime, might possibly be saved. Zenobia, though ambitious, is
  reasonable and patient, and will listen as becomes a philosopher, and a lover
  of her people, to any thing he should say. It were a great act of friendship
  to press upon him the policy, as well as the virtue of moderation.'</p>

  <p>Zenobia gave a mother's smile of love to her daughter, whose countenance,
  while she uttered these few words, was brilliant with the beauty of strong
  emotion.</p>

  <p>'No act of friendship like this, lady,' said I, 'shall be wanting on my
  part. If I have any influence over the mind of Aurelian, it shall be exerted
  to serve the cause of peace. I have dear friends in Palmyra, and this short
  residence among her people has bound me to them very closely. It would grieve
  me sorely to feel that as a Roman and a lover of my country, I must needs
  break these so lately knitted bonds of affection. But, I am obliged to say
  it, I am now full of apprehension, lest no efforts of mine, or of any, may
  have power to avert the calamities which impend. The scene I was witness of
  but so few hours ago, seems to me now to cut off all hope of an amicable
  adjustment,'</p>

  <p>Julia's countenance fell. The air of pride in Zenobia mounted higher and
  higher.</p>

  <p>'And what was it I did?' said Zenobia. 'Do I not stand upon the records of
  the Senate, Augusta of the Roman empire! Was not the late renowned Odenatus,
  Augustus by the decree of that same Senate? And was I not then right to call
  my own sons by their rightful title of Caesar?&mdash;and invest them with the
  appropriate robe, and even show them to the people as their destined rulers?
  I am yet to learn that in aught I have offended against any fair construction
  of the Roman law. And unless I may thus stand in equal honor with other
  partners of this empire, asking and receiving nothing as favor, I sever
  myself and my kingdom from it.'</p>

  <p>'But,' said Julia, in her persuasive voice, whose very tones were enough
  to change the harshest sentiment to music, 'why put at hazard the certain
  good we now enjoy, the peace and prosperity of this fair realm, for what at
  best is but a shadow&mdash;a name? What is it to you or me that Timolaus,
  Herennianus, and Vabalathus be hailed by the pretty style of Caesar? For me
  at least, and so I think for all who love you, it is enough that they are the
  sons of Zenobia. Who shall heap more upon that honor?'</p>

  <p>'Julia,' replied the Queen, 'as the world deems&mdash;and we are in the
  world and of it&mdash;honor and greatness lie not in those things which are
  truly honorable and great; not in learning or genius, else were Longinus upon
  this throne, and I his waiting woman; not in action&mdash;else were the great
  Zabdas king; not in merit, else were many a dame of Palmyra where I am, and I
  a patient household drudge. Birth, and station, and power, are before these.
  Men bow before names, and sceptres, and robes of office, lower than before
  the gods themselves. Nay, here in the East, power itself were a shadow
  without its tinsel trappings. 'Tis vain to stand against the world. I am one
  of the general herd. What they honor, I crave. This coronet of pearl, this
  gorgeous robe, this golden chair, this human footstool, in the eye of a
  severe judgment, may signify but little. Zeno or Diogenes might smile upon
  them with contempt. But so thinks not the world. It is no secret that in
  Timolaus, Herennianus and Vabalathus dwells not the wisdom of Longinus, nor
  the virtue of Valerian. What then so crazed the assembled people of Palmyra,
  but the purple-colored mantle of the Roman Caesar? I am for that fathoms
  deeper in the great heart of my people. These are poor opinions, so thou
  judgest, Roman, for the pupil of the chief philosopher of our age, and
  through him skilled in all the learning of the Greeks. But forget not that I
  am an Oriental and&mdash;a woman. This double nature works at my heart with
  more than all the power of the schools. Who and what so strong as the
  divinity within?'</p>

  <p>This is a poor record, my Curtius, of what fell from this extraordinary
  woman. Would that I could set down the noble sentiments which, in the midst
  of so much that I could not approve, came from her lips in a language worthy
  of her great teacher! Would that I could transfer to my pages the touching
  eloquence of the divine Julia, whose mind, I know not how it is, moves in a
  higher world than ours. Sometimes, nay, many times, her thoughts, strangely
  enough, raised up before me the image of the Christian Probus, of whom I had
  till then scarcely thought since our parting. For a long time was this
  interview continued&mdash;an interview to me more stirring than any other of
  my life, and, owing to the part I was obliged to take, almost painfully so.
  Much that I said could not but have grated harshly upon the proud and
  ambitious spirit of Zenobia. But I shrunk from nothing that in the least
  degree might tend to shake her in the designs which now possess and agitate
  her, and which, as it seems to me, cannot be carried out without great danger
  to the safety or existence of her kingdom; though I cannot but say, that if a
  rupture should occur between Palmyra and Rome, imprudence might indeed be
  charged upon Zenobia, but guilt, deep guilt, would lie at the door of
  Aurelian. It was a great aid that Julia, in all I said, was my ally. Her
  assent gave double force to every argument I used; for Zenobia trusts her as
  a sister, I had almost said, reveres her as a divinity. Beautiful it was to
  witness their freedom and their love. The gods avert every calamity from
  their heads!</p>

  <p>When we had in this manner, as I have said, a long time discoursed,
  Zenobia, at length, rising from her seat, said to me, 'Now do we owe you some
  fair return, noble Piso, for the patience with which you have listened to our
  treasonable words. If it please you, accompany us now to some other part of
  our palace, and it will be strange if we cannot find something worthy of your
  regard.'</p>

  <p>So saying, we bent our way in company, idly talking of such things as
  offered, to a remote part of the vast building, passing through and lingering
  here and there in many a richly-wrought hall and room, till, turning suddenly
  into a saloon of Egyptian device, where we heard the sound of voices, I found
  myself in the presence of Gracchus and Fausta, Longinus and Zabdas, with a
  few others of the chief citizens of Palmyra. I need not say how delighted I
  was. It was a meeting never to be forgotten. But it was in the evening of
  this day, walking in the gardens of the palace between Julia and Fausta, that
  I banqueted upon the purest pleasure of my life.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="letter05"
     id="letter05">LETTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">YOU could not but suppose, my Curtius, when you came to the
end of my last
  letter, that I should soon write again, and not leave you ignorant of the
  manner in which I passed the evening at the palace of Zenobia. Accordingly,
  knowing that you would desire this, I had no sooner tied and sealed my
  epistle, than I sat down to give you those minute recollections of incident
  and of conversation in which you and Lucilia both so much delight, and which
  indeed, in the present instance, are not unimportant in their bearing upon my
  future lot. But this I shall leave to your own conjectures. A tempest of rain
  makes me a necessary prisoner to the house, but the pleasant duty of writing
  to you spreads sunshine on all within my room. I trust in the gods that you
  are all well.</p>

  <p>Of the banquet in that Egyptian hall, and its immediate attendant
  circumstances, I need not tell you. It was like other feasts of ceremony,
  where the niceties of form constantly obtrude themselves, and check too much
  the flow of conversation. Then too one's mind is necessarily distracted,
  where the feast is sumptuous, by the rarity of the dishes, the richness of
  the service, and the pomp and stir of the attendance. Never was it my fortune
  in Rome to recline at a table of more imperial splendor. For Lucilia's sake I
  will just say, that the service was of solid gold, most elaborately carved,
  and covered with designs illustrative of points of the Egyptian annals. Our
  wine cups were also of gold, enriched with precious stones; and for each kind
  of wine, a different cup, set with jewels, typical of the character of the
  wine for which it was intended. These were by the hand of Demetrius. It was
  in all respects a Roman meal, in its fashions and conduct, though the table
  was spread with many delicacies peculiar to the Orientals. The walls and
  ceiling of the room, and the carpets, represented, in the colors of the most
  eminent Greek and Persian artists, scenes of the life and reign of the great
  Queen of Egypt, of whom Zenobia reckons herself a descendant. Cleopatra was
  all around, above, and beneath. Music at intervals, as the repast drew toward
  a close, streamed in from invisible performers, and added a last and crowning
  charm. The conversation was light and sportful, taking once or twice only,
  and accidentally, as it were, a political turn. These graceful Palmyrenes act
  a winning part in all the high courtesies of life; and nothing could be more
  perfect than their demeanor, free and frank, yet never forgetful of the
  presence of Zenobia, nor even of me, a representative in some manner of the
  majesty of Rome.</p>

  <p>The moon, nearly at her full, was already shining bright in the heavens,
  when we left the tables, and walking first for a time upon the cool pavements
  of the porticos of the palace, then descended to the gardens, and separating
  in groups, moved away at will among their endless windings. Zenobia, as if
  desiring some private conference with her great teacher, left us in company
  with Longinus. It was my good and happy fortune to find myself in the society
  of Julia and Fausta, with whom I directed my steps toward the remoter and
  more quiet parts of the garden&mdash;for nearer the palace there were still
  to be heard the sounds of merriment, and of the instruments furnishing a soft
  and delicious entertainment for such as chose to remain longer in the palace.
  Of the rest of the company, some like ourselves wandered among the
  labyrinthian walks of this vast pleasure-ground, while others, already weary,
  or satisfied with enjoyment, returned early to their homes.</p>

  <p>The evening, shall I say it, was worthy of the company now, abroad to
  enjoy it. A gentle breeze just swayed the huge leaves of the&mdash;to
  me&mdash;strange plants which overhung the paths, and came, as it here always
  seems to come, laden with a sweetness which in Rome it never has, unless
  added by the hand of art. Dian's face shone never before so fair and bright,
  and her light, coming to us at frequent turns in our walk, through the spray
  of numerous fountains, caused them to show like falling diamonds. A divine
  repose breathed over the whole scene, I am sure our souls were in harmony
  with it.</p>

  <p>'Princess,' said I, 'the gardens of Nero can have presented no scenes more
  beautiful than these. He who designed these avenues, and groups of flowers
  and trees, these frequent statues and fountains, bowers and mimic temples,
  and made them bear to each other these perfect proportions and relations, had
  no less knowledge, methinks, of the true principles of taste, and of the very
  secrets of beauty, than the great Longinus himself. The beauty is so rare,
  that it affects the mind almost like greatness itself. In truth, in perfect
  beauty there is always that which overawes.'</p>

  <p>'I cannot say,' replied Julia, 'that the learned Greek was the architect
  and designer of these various forms of beauty. The credit, I believe, is
  rather due to Periander, a native Athenian, a man, it is universally
  conceded, of the highest genius. Yet it is at the same time to be said, that
  the mind of Longinus presided over the whole. And he took not less delight in
  ordering the arrangements of these gardens, than he did in composing that
  great treatise, not long published, and which you must have seen before you
  left Rome. He is a man of universal powers. You have not failed to observe
  his grace, not less than his abilities, while we were at the tables. You have
  seen that he can play the part of one who would win the regards of two
  foolish girls, as well as that of first minister of a great kingdom, or that
  of the chief living representative and teacher of the philosophy of the
  immortal Plato.'</p>

  <p>'For myself,'I replied, 'I could hardly withdraw myself from the simple
  admiration of his noble head and form, to attend, so as to judge of it, to
  what fell from his lips. It seems to me that if a sculptor of his own Greece
  sought for a model of the human figure, he could hope to find none so perfect
  as that of Longinus.'</p>

  <p>'That makes it the foolisher and stranger,' said Fausta, 'that he should
  toil at his toilet as he so manifestly does. Why can he not rely, for his
  power over both men and women, upon his genius, and his natural graces. It
  might be well enough for the Stagyrite to deck his little person in fine
  clothes, and to cover his fingers with rings&mdash;for I believe there must
  be something in the outward appearance to strike the mere sensual eye, and
  please it, either natural or assumed, or else even philosophers might go
  unheeded. I doubt if upon my fingers there be more or more glowing rings than
  upon those of Longinus. To be sure, one must admit that his taste is
  exquisite.'</p>

  <p>'In the manners and dress of Longinus,' said I, 'as well as in those of
  Aristotle, we behold, I think, simply the power of custom. They were both, in
  respect to such things, in a state of indifference&mdash;the true
  philosophical state. But what happened? Both became instructors and
  companions of princes, and the inmates of royal palaces. Their manners and
  costume were left, without a thought, I will dare to say, on their part, to
  conform themselves to what was around them. Would it not have been a more
  glaring piece of vanity, if in the palace of Philip, Aristotle had clothed
  himself in the garb of Diogenes&mdash;or if Longinus, in the presence of the
  great Zenobia, had appeared in the sordid attire of Timon?'</p>

  <p>'I think so,' said Julia.</p>

  <p>'Your explanation is a very probable one,' added Fausta, 'and had not
  occurred to me. It is true, the courts may have dressed them and not
  themselves, But never, I still must think, did a rich dress fall upon more
  willing shoulders than upon those of the Greek, always excepting, Julia, Paul
  of Antioch.'</p>

  <p>'Ah, Fausta,' said Julia, 'you cannot, do what you will, shake my faith in
  Paul. If I allow him vain, and luxurious, and haughty, I can still separate
  the advocate from the cause. You would not condemn the doctrine of Aristotle,
  on the ground that he wore rings. Nor can I altogether, nor in part, that of
  Paul, because he rolls through the city in a gilded chariot, with the
  attendance of a prince. I may blame or despise him&mdash;but not therefore
  reject his teaching. That has a defence independent of him. Policy, and
  necessity of time and place, have compelled him to much which his reason
  disapproves. This he has given me to believe, and has conjured me on this, as
  on all subjects, to yield my mind only to evidence, apart from all personal
  considerations. But I did not mean to turn our conversation in this
  direction. Here, Piso, have we now arrived in our walk at my favorite
  retreat. This is my bower for meditation, and frequently for reading too. Let
  us take this seat. Observe how through these openings we catch some of the
  prominent points of the city. There is the obelisk of Cleopatra; there the
  tower of Antonine', there the Egyptian Pyramid; and there a column going up
  in honor of Aurelian; and in this direction, the whole outline of the
  palace.'</p>

  <p>'Yet are we at the same time shut out from all the world,' said I. 'Your
  hours must fly swiftly here. But are your musings always solitary ones?'</p>

  <p>'O no&mdash;I am not so craving as that of my own society: sometimes I am
  joined by my mother, and not seldom by my sweet Fausta here,' said she, at
  the same time affectionately drawing Fausta's arm within her own, and
  clasping her hand; 'we do not agree, indeed, upon all the subjects which we
  discuss, but we still agree in our love.'</p>

  <p>'Indeed we do, and may the gods make it perpetual; may death only divide
  us!' said Fausta with fervor.</p>

  <p>'And may the divinity who sits supreme above,' said Julia, 'grant that
  over that, not even death shall have power. If any thing makes existence
  valuable, it is love. If I should define my happiness, I should say it in one
  word, Love. Without Zenobia, what should I be? I cannot conceive of
  existence, deprived of her, or of her regard. Loving her, and Fausta, and
  Longinus, as I do&mdash;not to forget Livia and the dear Faustula&mdash;and
  beloved of all in return&mdash;and my happiness scarcely seems to admit of
  addition.'</p>

  <p>'With what pain,' said I, 'does one contemplate the mere possibility that
  affections such as these are to last only for the few years which make up the
  sum of human life. Must I believe, must you believe, that all this fair scene
  is to end forever at death? That you, bound to each other by so many ties,
  are to be separated, and both of you to be divided from Zenobia, and all of
  us to fall into nothingness, silence, and darkness? Rather than that, would
  that the life we now enjoy might be immortal! Here are beautiful objects,
  among which one might be willing to live forever. I am never weary of the
  moon and her soft light, nor of the balmy air, nor of the bright greens of
  the herbage, nor of the forms of plain and mountain, nor of the human beings,
  infinite in the varieties of their character, who surround me wherever I go.
  Here now have I wandered far from my home, yet in what society and in what
  scenes do I find myself! The same heaven is above me, the same forms of
  vegetable life around me? and what is more, friends already dear as those I
  have left behind. In this very spot, were it but as an humble attendant upon
  the greatness of the Queen, could I be content to dwell.'</p>

  <p>'Truly, I think you might,' cried Fausta; 'having chosen for yourself so
  elysian a spot, and filled it with such inhabitants, it is no great proof of
  a contented spirit that you should love to inhabit it. But how many such
  spots does the world present?&mdash;and how many such inhabitants? The
  question I think is, would you be ready to accept the common lot of man as an
  immortal one? I can easily believe that many, were they seated in these
  gardens, and waited on by attendant slaves, and their whole being made soft
  and tranquil, and exempt from care and fear, would say, 'Ensure me this, and
  I ask no more.' For myself, indeed, I must say it would not be so. I think
  not even the lot of Zenobia, enthroned as she is in the hearts of millions,
  nor yet thine, Julia, beloved not less than Zenobia, would satisfy me. I have
  now all that my utmost desires crave. Yet is there a part of me, I know not
  what it is, nor where it is, that is not full. I confess myself restless and
  unsatisfied. No object, no study, no pursuit, no friendship&mdash;forgive me,
  Julia,'&mdash;and she kissed her hand,&mdash;'no friendship even, satisfies
  and fills me.'</p>

  <p>'I do not wonder,' said Julia.</p>

  <p>'But how much unhappiness is there spread over the earth,' continued
  Fausta: 'I, and you, and Piso perhaps too, are in a state of dissatisfaction.
  And yet we are perched, as it were, upon the loftiest heights of existence.
  How must it be with those who are so far inferior to us as multitudes are in
  their means of happiness? From how many ills are we shielded, which rain down
  sharp- pointed, like the hail storms of winter, upon the undefended heads of
  the poor and low? They, Piso, would not, I think, pray that their lot might
  he immortal.'</p>

  <p>'Indeed I think not,' said I. 'Yet, perhaps, their lot is not so much more
  miserable than yours, as the difference in outward condition might lead one
  to think. Remember, the slave and the poor do not feel as you would, suddenly
  reduced to their state. The Arab enjoys his sleep upon his tent floor as well
  as you, Princess, beneath a canopy of woven gold, and his frugal meal of date
  or pulse tastes as sweet, as to you do dainties fetched from Rome, or fished
  from the Indian seas: and eating and sleeping make up much of life. Then the
  hearts of the great are corroded by cares and solicitudes which never visit
  the humble. Still, I do not deny that their condition is not far less
  enviable than ours. The slave who may be lashed, and tormented, and killed at
  his master's pleasure, drinks from a cup of which we never so much as taste.
  But over the whole of life, and throughout every condition of it, there are
  scattered evils and sorrows which pierce every heart with pain. I look upon
  all conditions as in part evil. It is only by selecting circumstances, and
  excluding ills which are the lot of all, that I could ask to live forever,
  even in the gardens of Zenobia.'</p>

  <p>'I do not think we differ much then,' said Fausta, 'in what we think of
  human life. I hold the highest lot to be unsatisfying. You admit all are so,
  but have shown me that there is a nearer approach to an equality of happiness
  than I had supposed, though evil weighs upon all. How the mind longs and
  struggles to penetrate the mysteries of its being! How imperfect and without
  aim does life seem! Every thing beside man seems to reach its utmost
  perfection. Man alone appears a thing incomplete and faulty.'</p>

  <p>'And what,' said I, 'would make him appear to you a thing perfect and
  complete' What change should you suggest?'</p>

  <p>'That which rather may be called an addition,' replied Fausta, 'and which,
  if I err not, all wise and good men desire, the assurance of immortality.
  Nothing is sweet; every cup is bitter; that which we are this moment drinking
  from, bitterest of all, without this. Of this I incessantly think and dream,
  and am still tossed in a sea of doubt.'</p>

  <p>'You have read Plato?' said I.</p>

  <p>'Yes, truly,' she replied; 'but I found little there to satisfy me, I have
  enjoyed too the frequent conversation of Longinus, and yet it is the same.
  Would that he were now here! The hour is serene, and the air which comes in
  so gently from the West, such as he loves.'</p>

  <p>As Fausta uttered these words, our eyes at the same moment caught the
  forms of Zenobia and Longinus, as they emerged from a walk very near, but
  made dark by overhanging and embowering roses. We immediately advanced toward
  them, and begged them to join us.</p>

  <p>'We are conversing,' said Julia, 'upon such things as you both love. Come
  and sit now with us, and let us know what you can say upon the same
  themes.'</p>

  <p>'We will sit with you gladly,' said the Queen; 'at least for myself I may
  say it, for I am sure that with you I shall find some other subjects
  discussed beside perplexing affairs of state. When alone with
  Longinus&mdash;as but now&mdash;our topic is ever the same.'</p>

  <p>'If the subject of our discourse, however, be ever the same,' said the
  Greek, 'we have this satisfaction in reflecting upon it, that it is one that
  in its nature is real and tangible. The well-being of a nation is not an
  undefined and shadowy topic, like so many of those which occupy the time and
  thoughts of even the wise. I too, however, shall gladly bear a part in
  whatever theme may engross the thoughts of Julia, Fausta, and Piso.'</p>

  <p>With these words, we returned to the seats we had left, which were not
  within the arbor of Julia, but were the marble steps which led to it. There
  we placed ourselves, one above and one beside another, as
  happened&mdash;Zenobia sitting between Fausta and Julia, I at the feet of
  Julia, and Longinus on the same step with myself, and next to Fausta. I could
  hardly believe that Zenobia was now the same person before whom I had in the
  morning, with no little agitation, prostrated myself, after the manner of the
  Persian ceremonial. She seemed rather like a friend whom I both loved and
  revered. The majesty of the Queen was gone; there remained only the native
  dignity of beauty, and goodness, and intellect, which, though it inspires
  reverence, yet is there nothing slavish in the feeling. It differs in degree
  only from that sentiment which we entertain toward the gods; it raises rather
  than depresses.</p>

  <p>'We were speaking,' said Julia, resuming the subject which had engaged us,
  'of life and of man&mdash;how unsatisfactory life is, and how imperfect and
  unfinished, as it were, man; and we agreed, I believe, in the opinion, that
  there can be no true happiness, without a certain assurance of immortality,
  and this we are without.'</p>

  <p>'I agree with you,' said Longinus, 'in all that you can have expressed
  concerning the unsatisfactoriness of life, regarded as a finite existence,
  and concerning the want of harmony there is between man and the other works
  of God, if he is mortal; and in this also, that without the assurance of
  immortality, there can, to the thinking mind, be no true felicity. I only
  wonder that on the last point there should exist in the mind of any one of
  you doubts so serious as to give you much disturbance. I cannot, indeed, feel
  so secure of a future and then unending existence, as I am sure that I live
  now. What I am now I know; concerning the future, I can only believe, and
  belief can never possess the certainty of knowledge. Still, of a future life
  I entertain no doubts that distress me. My belief in it is as clear and
  strong as I can well conceive belief in things invisible and unexperienced to
  be. It is such as makes me happy in any thought or prospect of death. Without
  it, and life would appear to me like nothing more to be esteemed than a
  short, and often troubled or terrific dream.'</p>

  <p>'So I confess it seems to me,' said Fausta. 'How should I bless the gods,
  if upon my mind there could rest a conviction of immortality strong like
  yours! The very certainty with which you speak, seems, through the power of
  sympathy, to have scattered some of my doubts. But, alas! they will soon
  return.'</p>

  <p>'In what you have now said,' replied Longinus, 'and in the feeling you
  have expressed on this point, do I found one of the strongest arguments for
  the immortality of the soul.'</p>

  <p>'I do not comprehend you,' said Fausta.</p>

  <p>'Do you not, Fausta,' asked Longinus, 'intensely desire a life after
  death?'</p>

  <p>'I do indeed. I have just expressed it.'</p>

  <p>'And do not you too, Zenobia, and Piso, and Julia?'</p>

  <p>'Surely, and with intensity,' we answered; 'the question need scarce be
  asked.'</p>

  <p>'I believe you,' resumed Longinus. 'You all earnestly desire an immortal
  life&mdash;you perpetually dwell upon the thought of it, and long for it. Is
  it not so with all who reflect at all upon themselves? Are there any such,
  have there ever been any, who have not been possessed by the same thoughts
  and desires, and who, having been greatly comforted and supported by them
  during life, have not at death relied upon them, and looked with some degree
  of confidence toward a coming forth again from death? Now I think it is far
  more reasonable to believe in another life, than in the delusiveness of these
  expectations. For I cannot suppose that this universal expectation will be
  disappointed, without believing in the wickedness, nay, the infinite
  malignity, of the Supreme Ruler, which my whole nature utterly refuses to do.
  For what more cruel, than to create this earnest and universal longing, and
  not gratify it? Does it not seem so?'</p>

  <p>We all admitted it.</p>

  <p>'This instinctive desire,' continued Longinus, 'I cannot but regard as
  being implanted by the Being who created us. It can proceed from no other. It
  is an instinct, that is, a suggestion or inspiration of God. If it could be
  shown to be a consequence of education, we might refer it for its origin to
  ingenious philosophers. But it exists where the light of philosophy has never
  shone. There have been none, of whom history has preserved even obscurest
  traditions, who have wanted this instinct. It is then the very inspiration of
  the Divinity, and will not be disappointed. I trust much to these tendencies
  of our nature. This is the best ground for our belief of a God. The arguments
  of the schools have never succeeded in establishing the truth, even to the
  conviction of a philosophic mind, much less a common one. Yet the truth is
  universally admitted. God, I think, has provided for so important an article
  of faith in the structure of our minds. He has not left it to chance or
  special Revelation. So, too, the determinations of the mind concerning virtue
  and vice, right and wrong, being for the most part so accordant throughout
  the whole race&mdash;these also I hold to be instinctive.'</p>

  <p>'I can think of nothing,' said Fausta, 'to urge against your argument. It
  adds some strength, I cannot but confess, to what belief I had before. I
  trust you have yet more that you can impart. Do not fear that we shall be
  dull listeners.'</p>

  <p>'I sit here a willing and patient learner,' said Zenobia, 'of any one who
  will pour new light into my mind. Go on, Longinus.'</p>

  <p>'To such a school,' said he, 'how can I refuse to speak? Let me ask you
  then, if you have never been perplexed by the evils of life, such as either
  you have yourselves experienced, or such as you have witnessed?'</p>

  <p>'I have, indeed,' said Fausta, 'and have deeply deplored them. But how are
  they connected with a future existence?'</p>

  <p>'Thus,' replied Longinus. 'As in the last case, the benevolence of the
  Supreme God cannot be sustained without the admission of the reality of a
  future life. Nor only that, but it seems to me direct proof may be adduced
  from the existence and universality of these evils to establish the blackest
  malignity. So that to me, belief in a future existence is in proportion to
  the difficulty of admitting the idea of divine malignity, and it cannot
  therefore be much stronger than it is.'</p>

  <p>'How can you make that clear to us?' said Fausta; 'I should truly rejoice
  if out of the evils which so darken the earth, any thing good or beautiful
  could be drawn.'</p>

  <p>'As this dark mould,' rejoined the philosopher, 'sends upwards, and out of
  its very heart, this rare Persian rose, so does hope grow out of evil, and
  the darker the evil the brighter the hope, as from a richer and fouler soil
  comes the more vigorous plant and larger flower. Take a particular evil, and
  consider it. You remember the sad tale concerning the Christian Probus, which
  Piso, in recounting the incidents of his journey from Rome to Palmyra,
  related to us while seated at the tables?'</p>

  <p>'Indeed, I did not hear it,' said Zenobia; 'so that Piso must, if he will,
  repeat it.'</p>

  <p>'We shall willingly hear it again,' said Julia and Fausta.</p>

  <p>And I then related it again.</p>

  <p>'Now do you wonder,' resumed Longinus, when I had finished, 'that Probus,
  when, one after another, four children were ravished from his arms by death,
  and then, as if to crown his lot with evil, his wife followed them, and he
  was left alone in the world, bereaved of every object to which his heart was
  most fondly attached, do you wonder, I say, that he turned to the heavens and
  cursed the gods? And can you justify the gods so that they shall not be
  chargeable with blackest malignity, if there be no future and immortal state?
  What is it to bind so the heart of a parent to a child, to give that
  affection a force and a tenderness which belong to no other tie, so that
  anxieties for its life and welfare, and cares and sacrifices for its good,
  constitute the very existence of the parent, what is it to foster by so many
  contrivances this love, and then forever disappoint and blast it, but
  malignity? Yet this work is done every hour, and in almost every heart; if
  for children we lament not, yet we do for others as dear.'</p>

  <p>Tears to the memory of Odenatus fell fast from the eyes of Zenobia.</p>

  <p>'Are we not then,'&mdash;continued Longinus, without pausing&mdash;'are we
  not then presented with this alternative, either the Supreme God is a
  malignant being, whose pleasure it is to torment, or, there is an immortal
  state, where we shall meet again with those, who, for inscrutable purposes,
  have been torn from our arms here below? And who can hesitate in which to
  rest? The belief, therefore, in a future life ought to be in proportion to
  the difficulty of admitting the idea of divine malignity. And this idea is so
  repulsive&mdash;so impossible to be entertained for one moment&mdash;that the
  other cannot, it seems to me, rest upon a firmer foundation.'</p>

  <p>'Every word you speak,' said Zenobia, 'yields pleasure and instruction. It
  delights me, even when thickest beset by the cares of state, to pause and
  contemplate for a moment the prospects of futurity. It diffuses a divine calm
  throughout the soul. You have given me new food for my thoughts.'</p>

  <p>'I will add,' said Longinus, 'only one thing to what I have said, and that
  is, concerning the incompleteness of man, as a divine work, and which has
  been mentioned by Fausta. Is not this an argument for a future life? Other
  things and beings are finished and complete&mdash;man only is left, as it
  were, half made up. A tree grows and bears fruit, and the end of its creation
  is answered. A complete circle is run. It is the same with the animals. No
  one expects more from a lion or a horse than is found in both. But with man
  it is not so. In no period of history, and among no people, has it been
  satisfactorily determined what man is, or what are the limits of his capacity
  and being. He is full of contradictions, and of incomprehensible
  organization, if he is considered only in relation to this world. For while
  every other affection finds and rests in its appropriate object, which fully
  satisfies and fills it, the desire of unlimited improvement and of endless
  life&mdash;the strongest and best defined of any of the desires&mdash;this
  alone is answered by no corresponding object: which is not different from
  what it would be, if the gods should create a race like ours, having the same
  craving and necessity for food and drink, yet never provide for them the one
  nor the other, but leave them all to die of hunger. Unless there is a future
  life, we all die of a worse hunger. Unless there is a future life, man is a
  monster in creation&mdash;compared with other things, an abortion&mdash;and
  in himself, and compared with himself, an enigma&mdash;a riddle&mdash;which
  no human wit has ever solved, nor can ever hope to solve.'</p>

  <p>'This seems unanswerable,' said Fausta; 'yet is it no objection to all
  such arguments, which we ourselves construct, that the thing they establish
  is too great and good almost to be believed, without some divine warrant? It
  does to me appear almost or quite presumptuous to think, that for me there is
  by the gods prepared a world of never-fading light, and a never-ending
  joy.'</p>

  <p>'When,' replied the Greek, 'we look at the lower forms of man which fall
  under our observation, I confess that the objection which you urge strikes me
  with some force. But when I think that it is for beings like you to whom I
  speak, for whom another and fairer world is to be prepared, it loses again
  much of its force. And when I think of the great and good of other times, of
  Homer and Hesiod, of Phidias and Praxiteles, of Socrates and Plato, and of
  what the mind of man has in them, and in others as great and good,
  accomplished, the objection which you urge loses all its force. I see and
  feel that man has been made not altogether unworthy of a longer life and a
  happier lot than earth affords. And in regard to the ignorant, the low, and
  the almost or quite savage, we are to consider that the same powers and
  affections are in them as in us, and that their inferiority to us is not
  intrinsic and essential, but as it were accidental. The difference between
  the soul of Plato and yonder Ethiopian slave is not in any original faculty
  or power; the slave here equals the philosopher; but in this, that the
  faculties and powers of Plato were strengthened, and nurtured, and polished,
  by the hand of education, and the happy influences of a more civilized
  community, all which to the slave has been wanting. He is a diamond just as
  it comes from the mine; Plato like that one set in gold, which sparkles with
  the radiance of a star, Fausta, upon your finger. But, surely, the glory of
  the diamond is, that it is a diamond; not that Demetrius has polished and set
  it. Man has within him so much of the god, that I do not wonder he has been
  so often deified. The great and excellent among men, therefore, I think not
  unworthy of immortality, for what they are; the humble and the bad, for what
  they may so easily become, and might have been, under circumstances but
  slightly altered.'</p>

  <p>'I cannot,' said Julia, as Longinus closed, 'deny strength and
  plausibility to your arguments, but I cannot admit that they satisfy me.
  After the most elaborate reasoning, I am still left in darkness. No power nor
  wit of man has ever wholly scattered the mists which rest upon life and
  death. I confess, with Socrates, that I want a promise or a revelation to
  enable me to take the voyage of life in a spirit of cheerfulness, and without
  the fear of fatal shipwreck. If your reasonings, Longinus, were only
  accompanied with authority more than that of man, if I could only believe
  that the Divinity inspired you, I could then rest contented and happy. One
  word authoritatively declaring man's immortality, a word which by infallible
  token I could know to be a word from the Supreme, would to me be worth
  infinitely more than all the conjectures, hopes, and reasonings of all the
  philosophers. I fully agree with you, that the instincts of our nature all
  point both to a God and to immortality. But the heart longs for something
  more sure and clear, at least my woman's heart does. It may be that it is the
  woman within me which prompts the feeling&mdash;but I wish to lean upon
  authority in this great matter. I wish to repose calmly in a divine
  assurance.'</p>

  <p>'In that, Princess,'I could not help saying, 'I am a woman too. I have
  long since lost all that regard for the gods in which I was so carefully
  nourished. I despise the popular superstitions. Yet is there nothing which I
  have found as yet to supply their place. I have searched the writings of
  Plato, of Cicero, of Seneca, in vain. I find there, indeed, wisdom, and
  learning, and sagacity, almost more than human. But I find nothing which can
  be dignified by the name of religion. Their systems of morals are admirable,
  and sufficient perhaps to enable one to live a happy or fortunate life. But
  concerning the soul of man, and its destiny, they are dumb, or their words,
  if they utter any, are but the dark speeches of an oracle.'</p>

  <p>'I am happy that I am not alone,' said Julia; 'and I cannot but think that
  many, very many, are with me. I am sure that what most persons, perhaps, who
  think and feel upon those subjects, want, is some divine promise or
  revelation. Common minds, Longinus, cannot appreciate the subtlety of your
  reasonings, much less those of the Phaedo. And, besides, the cares and labors
  of life do not allow time to engage in such inquiries, even if we supposed
  all men to have capacity for them. Is it not necessary that truths relating
  to the soul and futurity should rest upon authority, if any or many beside
  philosophers are to embrace them? And surely, if the poor and ignorant are
  immortal, it is as needful for them, as for us, to know it. It is, I
  conceive, on this account, that the religion of the Christians has spread so
  rapidly. It meets our nature. It supplies authority. It professes to bring
  annunciations from Heaven of man's immortality.'</p>

  <p>'It is for that reason,' replied Longinus, 'I cannot esteem it. The very
  term revelation offends. The right application of reason effects all, it
  seems to me, that what is called revelation can. It perfectly satisfies the
  philosopher, and as for common minds, instinct is an equally sufficient guide
  and light.'</p>

  <p>'I cannot but judge you, Longinus,' said Julia, 'wanting in a true fellow-
  feeling for your kind, notwithstanding all you have said concerning the
  nature and powers of man. How is it that you can desire that mankind should
  remain any longer under the dominion of the same gross and pernicious errors
  that have for so many ages oppressed them! Only consider the horrors of an
  idolatrous religion in Egypt and Assyria, in Greece and in Rome&mdash;and do
  you not desire their extermination?&mdash;and what prospect of this can there
  be, but through the plain authoritative language of a revelation?'</p>

  <p>'I certainly desire with you,' replied Longinus, 'the extermination of
  error, and the overthrow of horrible and corrupting superstitions; and of
  nothing am I more sure than that the reason of man, in unfolding and
  constantly improving ages, will effect it. A plain voice from Heaven,
  announcing important truth, might perhaps hasten the work. But this voice, as
  thought to be heard in Christianity, is not a plain voice, nor clearly known
  to be a voice from Heaven. Here is the Bishop of Antioch set upon by the
  Bishops of Alexandria and Cesarea, and many others, as I learn, who accuse
  him of wrongly receiving and falsely teaching the doctrines of Christ; and
  for two hundred years has there prevailed the like uncertainty about the
  essence of the religion.'</p>

  <p>'I look not with much hope to Christianity,' said Fausta. 'Yet I must
  first inform myself more exactly concerning it, before I judge.'</p>

  <p>'That is spoken like Fausta,' said Julia; 'and it is much for you to say
  who dislike so heartily that Paul, whom I am constantly wishing you to
  hear.'</p>

  <p>'Whenever he shall lay aside a little of his pomp, I may be willing to
  listen,' replied Fausta; 'but I could ill brook a discourse upon immortality
  from one whose soul seems so wedded to time.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Julia, 'but let us not be drawn away from our subject. I
  admit that there are disputes among the Christians, but, like the disputes
  among philosophers, they are about secondary matters. There is no dispute
  concerning the great and chiefly interesting part of the religion&mdash;its
  revelation of a future life Christians have never divided here, nor on
  another great point, that Christ, the founder of the religion, was a true
  messenger from God. The voice of Christianity on both these points is a clear
  one. Thus, I think, every one will judge, who, as I have done, will read the
  writings in which the religion is found. And I am persuaded it is because it
  is so plain a voice here, that it is bidding fair to supersede every other
  form of religion. And that it is a voice from God, is, it seems to me, made
  out with as much clearness as we could look for. That Christ, the author of
  this religion, was a messenger from God, was shown by his miracles. How could
  it be shown otherwise? I can conceive of no other way in which so satisfying
  proof could be given of the agency and authority of God. And certainly there
  is evidence enough, if history is to be believed, that he wrought many and
  stupendous miracles.'</p>

  <p>'What is a miracle?' asked Longinus.</p>

  <p>'It is that,' replied Julia, 'which being done or said, furnishes
  satisfactory proof of the present interposing power of God. A man who, by a
  word spoken, can heal sick persons, and raise to life dead ones, can be no
  other than a messenger of God!'</p>

  <p>'Why not of some other superior being&mdash;perhaps a bad one?'</p>

  <p>'The character, teaching, objects, acts of Christ, make it unlikely, if
  not impossible, that he should have been sent by any bad intelligence. And
  that he came not only from a good being, but from God, we may believe on his
  own word.'</p>

  <p>'His goodness may have been all assumed. The whole may be a
  deception.'</p>

  <p>'Men do not sacrifice their lives merely to deceive, to play a child's
  game before the world. Christ died to show his attachment to his cause, and
  with him innumerable others. Would they have done this merely to impose upon
  mankind? And for what purpose?&mdash;for that of teaching a religion
  inculcating the loftiest virtue! But I do not set myself forward as a
  champion of this new religion,' continued Julia, plainly disturbed lest she
  might have seemed too earnest. 'Would that you, Longinus, could be persuaded
  to search into its claims. If you would but read the books written by the
  founders of it, I am sure you would say this at least, that such books were
  never written before, nor such a character portrayed as that of Jesus Christ.
  You who profess yourself charmed with the poetry of the Jewish Scriptures,
  and the grandeur of the sentiments expressed in them, would not be less
  impressed by the gentler majesty, the mild, sweet dignity of the person and
  doctrine of Christ. And if the reasonings of Socrates and Plato have any
  power to convince you of the immortality of the soul, how must you be moved
  by the simple announcements of the truth by the Nazarene, and above all by
  his resurrection from the dead! Christianity boasts already powerful
  advocates, but I wish it could say that its character and claims had been
  examined by the great Longinus.'</p>

  <p>The soft yet earnest, eloquent tones of Julia's voice fell upon pleased
  and willing ears. The countenance of the Greek glowed with a generous
  satisfaction, as he listened to the reasoning of his fair pupil, poured forth
  in that noble tongue it had been his task and his happiness to teach her.
  Evidently desirous, however, not to prolong the conversation, he addressed
  himself to the Queen.</p>

  <p>'You are pleased,' said he, 'you must be, with the aptness of my scholar.
  Julia has not studied dialectics in vain. Before I can feel myself able to
  contend with her, I must study the books she has commended so&mdash;from
  which, I must acknowledge, I have been repelled by a prejudice, I believe,
  rather than any thing else, or more worthy&mdash;and then, perhaps, I may
  agree in opinion with her.'</p>

  <p>'In truth,' said Zenobia, 'Julia is almost or quite a Christian. I knew
  not, daughter, that Paul had made such progress in his work. But all have my
  full consent to cherish such form of religious faith as most approves itself
  to their own minds. I find my highest satisfaction in Moses and the prophets.
  Happy shall I be if Julia find as much, or more, in Christ and his apostles.
  Sure am I, there is no beneficent power nor charm in the religions of Greece,
  or Rome, or Persia, or Egypt, to cause any of us to adhere to them, though
  our very infancy were instructed in their doctrines.'</p>

  <p>'It is not, I assure you,' said Julia, 'to Paul of Antioch that I owe such
  faith in Christ as I have, but to the Christian books themselves; or if to
  any human authority besides, to St. Thomas, the old hermit of the mountain,
  to whom I would that every one should resort who would draw near to the
  purest living fountain of Christian knowledge.'</p>

  <p>'I trust,' said I, 'that at some future time I may, with your guidance, or
  through your influence, gain admittance to this aged professor of the
  Christian faith. I confess myself now, since what I have heard, a seeker
  after Christian knowledge.'</p>

  <p>'Gladly shall I take you there,' replied the princess, 'and gladly will
  St. Thomas receive you.'</p>

  <p>We now at the same time rose from our seats. Zenobia, taking the hand of
  Fausta, walked toward the palace; Longinus, with folded arms, and as if
  absorbed by the thoughts which were passing through his mind, began to pace
  to and fro beneath the thick shadows of a group of orange trees. I was left
  with Julia.</p>

  <p>'Princess,' said I, 'it is yet early, and the beauty of the evening makes
  it wrong to shut ourselves up from the sight of so fair a scene: shall we
  follow farther some of these inviting paths?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing can be more pleasant,' said she; 'these are my favorite haunts,
  and I never am weary of them, and never did they seem to me to wear a more
  lovely aspect than now. Let me be your guide, and I will lead you by a
  winding way to Zenobia's Temple, as we call it, for the reason that it is her
  chosen retreat, as the arbor which we have now left is mine.'</p>

  <p>So we began to walk toward the spot of which she spoke. We were for some
  time silent. At length the princess said, 'Roman, you have now seen Zenobia,
  both as a queen and a woman. Has fame done her more than justice?'</p>

  <p>'Great as her reputation is in Rome,'I replied, 'fame has not, to my ear
  at least, brought any thing that more than distantly approaches a true and
  faithful picture of her. We have heard much indeed&mdash;and yet not
  enough&mdash;of her surpassing beauty, of the vigor of her understanding, of
  her vast acquirements in the Greek learning, of the wisdom and energy of her
  conduct as a sovereign queen, of her skill in the chase, of her bravery and
  martial bearing, when, at the head of her troops, she leads them to the
  charge. But of this union of feminine loveliness with so much of masculine
  power, of this womanly grace, of this winning condescension,&mdash;so that it
  loses all the air of condescension,&mdash;to those even much beneath her in
  every human accomplishment as well as in rank, of this I had heard nothing,
  and for this I was not prepared. When, in the morning, I first saw her seated
  in all the pride of oriental state, and found myself prostrate at her feet,
  it was only Zenobia that I saw, and I saw what I expected. But no sooner had
  she spoken, especially no sooner had she cast that look upon you, princess,
  when you had said a few words in reply to me, than I saw not Zenobia only,
  but the woman and the mother. A veil was suddenly lifted, and a new being
  stood before me. It seemed to me that moment, that I knew her better than I
  know myself. I am sure that I know her. Her countenance all living with
  emotion, changing and working with every thought of her mind and every
  feeling of her heart, reveals her with the truth of a magic mirror. She is
  not known at Rome.'</p>

  <p>'I am sorry for it,' said Julia; 'if they only knew her, they could never
  do her harm. You, Piso, may perhaps do much for her. I perceive, already,
  that she highly regards you, and values your opinion. If you are willing to
  do us such service, if you feel interest enough in our fate, speak to her, I
  pray you, with plainness, all that you think. Withhold nothing. Fear not to
  utter what you may deem to be most unpalatable truths. She is candid and
  generous as she is ambitious. She will at least hear and weigh whatever you
  may advance. God grant, that truth may reach her mind, and reaching, sway
  it!'</p>

  <p>'I can now think of no higher satisfaction,'I replied, 'than to do all I
  may, as a Roman, in your service. I love your nation; and as a Roman and a
  man, I desire its welfare and permanent glory. Its existence is necessary to
  Rome; its ruin or decay must be, viewed aright, but so much injury to her
  most vital interests. Strange, how strange, that Zenobia, formed by the gods
  to draw her happiness from sources so much nobler than any which ambition can
  supply, should turn from them, and seek for it in the same shallow pool with
  Alexander, and Aurelian, and the hireling soldier of fortune!'</p>

  <p>'Strange indeed,' said Julia, 'that she who can enter with Longinus into
  the deepest mysteries of philosophy, and whose mind is stored with all the
  learning of the schools, should still love the pomp of power better than all.
  And Fausta is but her second self. Fausta worships Zenobia, and Zenobia is
  encouraged in her opinions by the kindred sentiments of that bright spirit.
  All the influence, Piso, which you can exert over Fausta will reach
  Zenobia.'</p>

  <p>'It seems presumptuous, princess,' said I, 'to seek to draw the minds of
  two such beings as Zenobia and Fausta to our bent. Yet surely they are in the
  wrong.'</p>

  <p>'It is something,' quickly added the princess, 'that Longinus is of our
  mind; but then again Zabdas and Gracchus are a host on the other part. And
  all the power and pride of Palmyra are with them too. But change Zenobia, and
  we change all. O how weary am I of ambition, and how sick of greatness!
  Willingly would I exchange all this for an Arab's tent, or a hermit's
  cell,'</p>

  <p>'The gods grant that may never be,'I replied; 'but that you, princess, may
  yet live to sit upon the throne of Zenobia.'</p>

  <p>'I say it with sincerity, Roman&mdash;that prayer finds no echo in my
  bosom, I have seen enough of power, and of the honors that wait upon it. And
  when I say this, having had before my eyes this beautiful vision of Zenobia
  reigning over subjects as a mother would reign over her family, dealing
  justly with all, and living but to make others happy&mdash;you must believe
  me. I seek and love a calmer, humbler lot. This, Piso, is the temple of
  Zenobia. Let us enter.'</p>

  <p>We approached and entered. It was a small building, after the model of the
  temple of Vesta at Tibur, constructed of the most beautiful marbles, and
  adorned with statues. Within were the seats on which the Queen was accustomed
  to recline, and an ample table, covered with her favorite authors, and the
  materials of writing.</p>

  <p>'It is here,' said Julia, 'that, seated with my mother, we listen to the
  eloquence of Longinus, while he unfolds the beauties of the Greek or Roman
  learning; or, together with him, read the most famous works of former ages.
  With Homer, Thucydides, and Sophocles for our companions, we have here passed
  precious hours and days, and have the while happily forgotten the heavy
  burden of a nation's cares. I have forgotten them; not so Zenobia. They are
  her life, and from all we have read would she ever draw somewhat that should
  be of service to her in the duties of her great office,'</p>

  <p>Returning to the surrounding portico, we stood and for a time enjoyed in
  silence the calm beauty of the scene.</p>

  <p>As we stood thus,&mdash;Julia gazing upon the objects around us, or lost
  in thought, I must I say it? seeing scarce any thing but her, and thinking
  only of her&mdash;as we stood thus, shouts of merry laughter came to us,
  borne upon the breeze, and roused us from our reverie.</p>

  <p>'These sounds,' said I,' cannot come from the palace; it is too far,
  unless these winding walks have deceived me.'</p>

  <p>'They are the voices,' said Julia, 'I am almost sure, of Livia and
  Faustula, and the young Caesars. They seem to be engaged in some sport near
  the palace. Shall we join them?'</p>

  <p>'Let us do so,' said I.</p>

  <p>So we moved toward that quarter of the gardens whence the sounds
  proceeded. A high wall at length separated us from those whom we sought. But
  reaching a gate, we passed through and entered upon a lawn covered as it
  seemed with children, slaves, and the various inmates of the palace. Here,
  mingled among the motley company, we at once perceived the Queen, and
  Longinus and Fausta, together with many of those whom we had sat with at the
  banquet. The centre of attraction, and the cause of the loud shouts of
  laughter which continually arose, was a small white elephant with which the
  young princes and princesses were amusing themselves. He had evidently been
  trained to the part he had to perform, for nothing could be more expert than
  the manner in which he went through his various tricks. Sometimes he chased
  them and pretended difficulty in overtaking them; then he would affect to
  stumble, and so fall and roll upon the ground; then springing quickly upon
  his feet, he would surprise some one or other lurking near him, and seizing
  him with his trunk would hold him fast, or first whirling him in the air,
  then seat him upon his back, and march gravely round the lawn, the rest
  following and shouting; then releasing his prisoner, he would lay himself
  upon the ground, while all together would fearlessly climb upon his back,
  till it was covered, when he would either suddenly shake his huge body, so
  that one after another they rolled off, or he would attempt to rise slowly
  upon his legs, in doing which, nearly all would slip from off his slanting
  back, and only two or three succeed in keeping their places. And other
  sportive tricks, more than it would be worth while for me to recount, did he
  perform for the amusement of his play-fellows. And beautiful was it to see
  the carefulness with which he trod and moved, lest any harm might come to
  those children. His especial favorite was the little flaxen-haired Faustula.
  He was never weary of caressing her, taking her on his trunk, and bearing her
  about, and when he set her down, would wait to see that she was fairly on her
  feet and safe, before he would return to his gambols. Her voice calling out,
  'Sapor, Sapor,' was sure to bring him to her, when, what with words and
  signs, he soon comprehended what it was she wanted. I myself came in
  unwittingly for a share of the sport. For, as Faustula came bounding by me, I
  did as those are so apt to do who know little of children&mdash;I suddenly
  extended my arms and caught her. She, finding herself seized and in the arms
  of one she knew not, thought, as children will think, that she was already
  home a thousand leagues from her home, and screamed; whereupon at the
  instant, I felt myself taken round the legs by a force greater than that of a
  man, and which drew them together with such violence that instinctively I
  dropped the child, and at the same time cried out with pain. Julia, standing
  next me, incontinently slapped the trunk of the elephant&mdash;for it was
  that twisted round me&mdash;with her hand, at which, leaving me, he wound it
  lightly round the waist of the princess, and held her his close prisoner.
  Great laughter from the children and the slaves testified their joy at seeing
  their elders, equally with themselves, in the power of the elephant. Milo
  being of the number, and in his foolish exhilaration and sportive approbation
  of Sapor's feats having gone up to him and patted him on his side, the beast,
  receiving as an affront that plebeian salutation, quickly turned upon him,
  and taking him by one of his feet, held him in that displeasing
  manner&mdash;-his head hanging down&mdash;and paraded leisurely round the
  green, Milo making the while hideous outcry, and the whole company,
  especially the slaves and menials, filling the air with screams of laughter.
  At length Vabalathus, thinking that Milo might be injured, called out to
  Sapor, who thereupon released him, and he, rising and adjusting his dress,
  was heard to affirm, that it had never happened so while he was in the
  service of Gallienus.</p>

  <p>These things for the little Gallus.</p>

  <p>Satisfied now with the amusements of the evening and the pleasures of the
  day, we parted from one another, filled with quite different sentiments from
  those which had possessed us in the morning. Do members of this great human
  family ever meet each other in social converse, and freely open their hearts,
  without a new and better strength being given to the bonds which hold in
  their embrace the peace and happiness of society? To love each other, I think
  we chiefly need but to know each other. Ignorance begets suspicion, suspicion
  dislike or hatred, and so we live as strangers and enemies, when knowledge
  would have led to intimacy and friendship. Farewell!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="letter06"
     id="letter06">LETTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MANY days have passed, my Curtius, since I last wrote, each
bringing its
  own pleasures, and leaving its ineffaceable impressions upon the soul. But
  though all have been in many things delightful, none has equalled that day
  and evening at the palace of the Queen. I have now mingled largely with the
  best society of Palmyra. The doors of the noble and the rich have been opened
  to me with a liberal hospitality, As the friend of Gracchus and
  Fausta&mdash;and now I may add I believe without presumption&mdash;of Zenobia
  also, of Julia, and Longinus, I have been received with attentions, of which
  Aurelian himself might with reason have been proud. More and more do I love
  this people, more and more fervently do I beg of the Being or Beings who rule
  over the affairs of men, to interpose and defend them from any threatening
  danger. I grieve that the rumors still reaching us from Rome tend so much to
  confirm the belief that our emperor is making preparations for an eastern
  expedition. Yet I cannot bring myself to think that he aims at Zenobia. If it
  were so, would there be first no communication with the Queen? Is it like
  Aurelian to plan and move so secretly? And against a woman too?&mdash;and
  that woman Zenobia? I'll not believe it. Your letters would not be what they
  are, if there were any real purpose like that which is attributed to
  Aurelian. But time will make its revelations. Meanwhile, let me tell you
  where I now am, and what pleasures I am enjoying. This will be written under
  various dates.</p>

  <p>I write to you from what is called the Queen's Mountain Palace, being her
  summer residence&mdash;occasionally&mdash;either to avoid the greater heats
  of the city or that she may divert herself with athletic sports of hunting,
  of which she is excessively fond, and in which she has few equals of her own
  or even of our sex. Roman women of the present day would be amazed, perhaps
  shocked, to be told what the sports and exercises are in which this great
  eastern Queen finds her pleasures. She is not more exalted above the women of
  Rome by genius, and the severer studies of the closet, than she is, in my
  judgment, by the manner and fashion of her recreations. Let not the dear
  Lucilia be offended. Were she here with me, her fair and generous mind would
  rest, I am sure, after due comparisons, in the very same conclusions. Fausta
  is in these respects too, as in others, but her second self. There is not a
  feat of horsemanship or archery, nor an enterprise in the chase, but she will
  dare all and do all that is dared or done by Zenobia; not in the spirit of
  limitation or even rivalry, but from the native impulses of a soul that
  reaches at all things great and difficult. And even Julia, that being who
  seems too ethereal for earth, and as if by some strange chance she were
  misplaced, being here, even Julia has been trained in the same school, and,
  as I shall show you, can join in the chase, and draw the bow, with scarcely
  less of skill and vigor&mdash;with no less courage&mdash;than either her
  mother or Fausta. Although I have now seen it, I still can hardly associate
  such excess of beauty&mdash;a beauty both of form and face so truly belonging
  to this soft, Syrian clime&mdash;with a strength and dexterity at every
  exercise that might put to shame many a Roman who wears both a beard and the
  manly gown. But this, I need not say, is not after Julia's heart. She loves
  more the gentler encounters of social intercourse, where wit, and sense, and
  the affections, have their full play, and the god-like that is within us
  asserts its supremacy.</p>

  <p>But my purpose now is to tell you how and why it is I am here, and
  describe to you as well as I can this new Elysium: and how it is the happy
  spirits, whom the gods have permitted to dwell here, pass their hours.</p>

  <p>I am here by the invitation of the Queen. A few days after that which we
  had so highly enjoyed at the palace, she expressed her desire that Gracchus,
  Fausta, and myself would accompany her, with others of her select friends, to
  her retreat among the hills, there to indulge in perfect repose, or engage in
  the rural sports of the place, according to our pleasure. I was not slow,
  neither were Gracchus and Fausta, to accept so agreeable an invitation. 'I
  feared,' said Fausta, 'lest the troubled state of affairs would prevent the
  Queen from taking her usual vacation, where she loves best to be. But to say
  the truth, Lucius, I do not think the prospect of a rupture with Rome does
  give her very serious thought. The vision of a trial of arms with so renowned
  a soldier as Aurelian, is, I doubt, not wholly, displeasing to her; there
  being especially so good reason to believe that what befell Heraclianus might
  befall Aurelian. Nay, do not look so grave. Rome is not
  fallen&mdash;yet.'</p>

  <p>'Your tongue, Fausta, is lighter than your heart. Yet if Rome must fall,
  why truly I know not at whose feet it could fall so worthily as those of
  Zenobia and Fausta. But I trust its destiny is never to fall. Other kingdoms
  as great, or almost as great, I know you will say, have fallen, and Rome must
  in its turn. It seems, however, I must say, to possess a principle of
  vitality which never before belonged to any nation. Its very vastness too
  seems to protect it. I can as soon believe that shoals of sea-carp may
  overcome the whale, or an army of emmets the elephant or rhinoceros, as that
  one nation, or many banded together, can break down the power of Rome.'</p>

  <p>'How very, very naturally and easily is that said. Who can doubt that you
  are a Roman, born upon the Coelian Hill! Pity but that we Palmyrenes could
  copy that high way you Romans have. Do you not think that strength and
  success lie much in confidence? Were every Roman such as you, I can believe
  you were then omnipotent. But then we have some like you. Here are Zenobia
  and I; you cannot deny that we have something of the Roman about us.'</p>

  <p>'I confess it would be a drawn battle, at least, were you a nation of
  Zenobias. How Fausta is at the lance, I cannot yet tell.'</p>

  <p>'That you shall see as soon as we are among the mountains. Is not this
  charming, now, in the Queen, to bring us all together again so soon, under
  her own roof? And such a place too, Lucius! We shall live there, indeed; each
  day will at least be doubled. For I suppose life is to be measured, not by
  hours, but sensations. Are you ready for the morning start? O, that Solon
  were here! what exquisite mirth should we have! Milo is something; but Solon
  were more.'</p>

  <p>'Fausta, Fausta,' cried Gracchus, 'when will you be a woman?'</p>

  <p>'Never, I trust,' replied Fausta; 'if I may then neither laugh, nor cry,
  nor vex a Roman, nor fight for our Queen. These are my vocations, and if I
  must renounce them, then I will be a man.'</p>

  <p>'Either sex may be proud to gain you, my noble girl,' said Gracchus.</p>

  <p>Early in the morning of the following day, all at the house of Gracchus
  gave note of preparation. We were to meet the Queen and her party a few miles
  from the walls of the city, at an appointed place, whence we were to make the
  rest of the journey in company. We were first at the place of meeting, which
  was a rising ground, shadowed by a few cedars, with their huge branching
  tops. We reined up our horses and stood with our faces toward the road, over
  which we had just passed, looking to catch the first view of the Queen. The
  sun was just rising above the horizon, and touching with its golden color the
  higher objects of the scene&mdash;the tall cedars&mdash;the gray crags, which
  here and there jutted out into the plain&mdash;the towers, and columns, and
  obelisks of the still slumbering city.</p>

  <p>'How beautiful!' exclaimed Fausta: 'but look! that is more beautiful
  still&mdash;that moving troop of horse! See!&mdash;even at this distance you
  can distinguish the form and bearing of the Queen. How the slant beams of
  this ruddy sun make her dress and the harness of her gallant steed to
  sparkle! Is it not a fair sight, Lucius?'</p>

  <p>It was beautiful indeed. The Queen was conspicuous above all, not more for
  her form and bearing, than for the more than imperial magnificence of her
  appointments. It is thus she is always seen by her people, dazzling them
  equally by her beauties and her state. As she drew nearer, I felt that I had
  never before seen aught on earth so glorious. The fiery Arabian that bore her
  knew, as well as I, who it was that sat upon him; and the pride of his
  carriage was visible in a thousand expressive movements. Julia was at her
  side, differing from her only as one sun differs from another. She, like
  Zenobia, seemed almost a part of the animal that bounded beneath her, so
  perfect was the art with which she rode.</p>

  <p>'A fair morning to you all,' cried the Queen, accompanying the words with
  a glance that was reward enough for a life of service. 'The day smiles upon
  our enterprise. Fausta, if you will join me, Piso will take care of Julia; as
  for our Zabdas and Longinus, they are sad loiterers.'</p>

  <p>Saying these things&mdash;scarcely checking her steed&mdash;and before the
  rest of the party had quite come up&mdash;we darted on, the Queen leading the
  way, and, as is her wont, almost at the top of her horse's speed.</p>

  <p>'Zenobia,' said Julia, 'is in fine spirits this morning, as you may judge
  from her beaming countenance, and the rate at which she travels. But we can
  hardly converse while we are going so fast.'</p>

  <p>'No bond has been signed,' said I, 'that we should ride like couriers.
  Suppose, princess, we slacken our pace.'</p>

  <p>'That will we,' she replied, 'and leave it to the Queen to announce our
  approach. Here now, alas! are Zabdas and Longinus overtaking us. The Queen
  wonders at your delay,' said she, addressing them; 'put spurs to your horses,
  and you may easily overtake her.'</p>

  <p>'Is it required?' asked the Egyptian, evidently willing to linger.</p>

  <p>'Not so indeed,' answered Julia, 'but it would be gallant; the Queen, save
  Fausta, is alone. How can we answer it, if evil befall her? Her girth may
  break.'</p>

  <p>At which alarming suggestion, taking it as merrily as it was given, the
  two counsellors quickened their pace, and bidding us good morning, soon, as
  we saw at the ascent of a little hill, overtook Zenobia.</p>

  <p>For the rest of us, we were passing and repassing each other, mingling and
  separating all the remainder of the way. Our road lay through a rough and
  hilly country, but here and there sprinkled with bright spots of the richest
  beauty and highest cultivation, The valleys, whenever we descended into them,
  we found well watered and tilled, and peopled by an apparently happy
  peasantry. And as we saw them from first one eminence and then another,
  stretching away and winding among the hills, we agreed that they presented
  delicious retreats for those who, weary of the world, wished to taste, toward
  the close of life, the sweets of a repose which the world never knows. As we
  drew toward the end of our ride&mdash;a ride of quite twenty Roman
  miles&mdash;we found ourselves forsaken of all the rest of the company, owing
  either to our horses not being equal to the others, or rather, perhaps, to
  the frequent pauses which we made at all those points where the scenery
  presented any thing beautiful or uncommon.</p>

  <p>Every thing now at last indicated that we were not far from the royal
  demesne. All around were marks of the hand and eye of taste having been
  there, and of the outlay of enormous wealth. It was not, however, till we
  had, for a mile and more, ridden through lawns and fields covered with grain
  and fruit, laid out in divisions of tillage or of wood, that, emerging from a
  dark grove, we came within sight of the palace. We could just discern, by the
  glittering of the sun upon the jewelry of their horses, that the last of the
  company were wheeling into the grounds in front of what seemed the principal
  part of the vast structure. That we might not be too much in the rear of all,
  we put our horses to their speed, which then, with the fleetness of wind,
  bore us to the outer gates of the palace. Passing these, we were in a moment
  in the midst of those who had preceded us, the grooms and slaves of the
  palace surrounding us, and taking charge of our horses. Zenobia was still
  standing in the great central portico, where she had dismounted, her face
  glowing with the excitement of the ride, and engaged in free discourse with,
  the group around her. Soon as Julia reined up her horse, and quicker than any
  other could approach, she sprang to her daughter's side, and assisted her to
  dismount, holding with a strong hand the while, the fiery and restless animal
  she rode.</p>

  <p>'Welcome in safety, Julia,' said the Queen, 'and thanks, noble Piso, for
  your care of your charge. But perhaps we owe your safety more to the strength
  of your Arab's girth, than to any care of Piso.'</p>

  <p>Julia's laugh rang merrily through the arches of the portico.</p>

  <p>'Truly,' said she, 'I was glad to use any sudden conceit by which to gain
  a more solitary ride than I was like to have. It was my ambition to be Piso's
  companion, that I might enjoy the pleasure of pointing out to new eyes the
  beauties of the country. I trust I was rightly comprehended by our grave
  counsellors.'</p>

  <p>'Assure yourself of it,' said Longinus; 'and though we could not but part
  from you with some unwillingness, yet seeing whom we were to join, we bore
  the loss with such philosophy as we were able to summon on the sudden.'</p>

  <p>Zenobia now led the way to the banqueting hall, where tables loaded with
  meats, fruits, and wines, offered themselves most temptingly and seasonably,
  to those who had ridden, as I have said, twenty Roman miles.</p>

  <p>This villa of the Queen, for its beauty and extent unrivalled in all the
  East, I would that I could set before you, so that you might form some
  conception of its greatness and variety. The palace stands at the northern
  extremity of a vast plain, just where the wild and mountainous region ends,
  and the more level and cultivated begins. To the North stretches a savage
  country, little inhabited, and filled with the wild animals which make the
  forests of Asia so terrible. This is the Queen's hunting-ground. It was here
  that, with Odenatus, she pursued the wild boar, the tiger, or the panther,
  with a daring and a skill that astonished the boldest huntsmen. It was in
  these forests, that the wretch Maesonius, insolently throwing his javelin at
  the game, just as he saw his uncle was about to strike, incurred that just
  rebuke, which however his revengeful nature never forgave, and which was
  appeased only with the blood of the royal Palmyrene. Zenobia is never more
  herself than when she joins the chase mounted upon her fleet Arabian, and
  roused to all her power by the presence of a gallant company of the boldest
  spirits of Palmyra.</p>

  <p>The southern view, and which my apartments overlook, presents a wide
  expanse of level ground, or gently undulating, offering a various prospect of
  cultivated fields, unbroken lawns, dense groves, of standing or flowing
  waters, of light bridges spanning them, of pavilions, arbors, statues,
  standing out in full view, or just visible through, the rich foliage or
  brilliant flowering plants of these sunny regions. The scene is closed by the
  low, waving outline of the country, through which we passed on the morning of
  our ride from Palmyra, over which there is spread a thin veil of purple haze,
  adding a new charm to whatever objects are dimly discerned through it. At one
  point only can we, when this vapor is by any cause diminished, catch a
  glimpse of the loftier buildings of the distant city. But the palace itself,
  though it be the work of man, and not of gods, is not less beautiful than all
  these aspects of nature. It is wholly built after the light and almost
  fantastic forms of the Persian architecture, which seem more suited to a
  residence of this kind than the heavier fashions of the Greek or Roman taste.
  Hadrian's villa is alone to be compared with it for vastness and
  magnificence, and that, by the side of this, seems a huge prison, so gay and
  pleasing are the thoughts and sensations which this dream-like combination of
  arch upon arch, of pinnacle, dome, and tower&mdash;all enriched with the most
  minute and costly work&mdash;inspires the mind.</p>

  <p>Nothing has pleased me more than at times, when the sultry heats of the
  day forbid alike study and recreation, to choose for myself some remote and
  shaded spot, and lying along upon the flowery turf, soothed by the drowsy hum
  of the summer insects, gaze upon this gorgeous pile of oriental grandeur, and
  lazily drink in the draughts of a beauty, as I believe, no where else to be
  enjoyed. When at such hours Julia or Fausta is my companion, I need not say
  in how great degree the pleasure is heightened, nor what hues of a more rosy
  tint wrap all the objects of the scene. Fountains here, as every where in the
  Eastern world, are frequent, and of such size as to exert a sensible
  influence upon the heated atmosphere. Huge columns of the coldest water,
  drawn from the recesses of the mountains, are thrown into the air, and then
  falling and foaming over rocks rudely piled, to resemble some natural
  cascade, disappear, and are led by subterranean conduits to distant and lower
  parts of the ground. These fountains take many and fantastic forms. In the
  centre of the principal court of the palace, it is an enormous elephant of
  stone, who disgorges from his uplifted trunk a vast but graceful shower,
  sometimes charged with the most exquisite perfumes, and which are diffused by
  the air through every part of the palace. Around this fountain, reclining
  upon seats constructed to allow the most easy attitudes, or else in some of
  the apartments immediately opening upon it, it is our custom to pass the
  evening hours, either conversing with each other, or listening to some tale
  which he who thinks he can entertain the company is at liberty to relate, or
  gathering at once instruction and delight, as Longinus, either from his
  memory or a volume, imparts to us choice selections of the literature of
  Athens or Rome. So have I heard the Oedipus Tyrannus, and the Prometheus, as
  I never have heard them before.</p>

  <p>At such times, it is beautiful to see the group of listeners gathering
  nearer and nearer, as the philosopher reads or recites, and catching every
  word and accent of that divine tongue, as it falls from his lips. Zenobia
  alone, of all who are there, ever presumes to interrupt the reader with
  either question or comment. To her voice Longinus instantly becomes a willing
  listener; and well may he: for never does she speak, at such moments, without
  adding a new charm to whatever theme she touches. Her mind, surprisingly
  clear, and deeply imbued with the best spirit of ancient learning, and
  poetically cast, becomes of right our teacher; and commands always the
  profound respect, if not always the assent, of the accomplished Greek. Not
  unfrequently, on such casual remark of the Queen, the reading is thereupon
  suspended, and discussion between her and the philosopher, or conversation
  upon topics suggested in which we all take part, ensues. But, however this
  may be, all moves on in a spirit the most liberal, frank, and free. No
  restraint is upon us but that which reverence for superior learning, or
  goodness, or beauty imposes. I must add, that on these occasions the great
  Zabdas is always seen to compose himself to his slumbers, from which he often
  starts, uttering loud shouts, as if at the head of his troops. Our bursts of
  laughter wake him not, but by the strange power of sleep seem to be heard by
  him as if they were responsive cries of the enemy, and only cause him to send
  forth louder shouts than ever, 'Down with the Egyptian dogs!' 'Let the Nile
  choke with their carcasses!'&mdash;'The Queen forever!' and then his voice
  dies away in inarticulate sounds.</p>

  <p>But I should weary you indeed, were I to go on to tell you half the
  beauties and delights of this chosen spot, and cause you, perhaps, to be
  discontented with that quiet, modest house, upon the banks of the Tiber. I
  leave you therefore to fill up with your own colors the outline which I have
  now set before you, as I best could, and pass to other things.</p>

  <p>Every day has seen its peculiar games and entertainments. Sometimes the
  Queen's slaves, trained to their respective feats, have wrestled, or fought,
  or run, for our amusement. At other times, we ourselves have been the
  performers. Upon the racecourse, fleet Arabians have contended for the prize,
  or they, who have esteemed themselves skilful, have tried for the mastery in
  two or four horse chariots. Elephants have been put to their strength, and
  dromedaries to their speed. But our chief pleasure has been derived from
  trials of skill and of strength with the lance and the arrow, and from the
  chase.</p>

  <p>It was in using the lance, that Antiochus&mdash;a kinsman of the Queen,
  whom I believe I have not before mentioned, although I have many times met
  him&mdash;chiefly signalized himself. This person, half Syrian and half
  Roman, possessing the bad qualities of both and the good ones of neither, was
  made one of this party, rather, I suppose, because he could not be left out,
  than because he was wanted. He has few friends in Palmyra, but among wild and
  dissolute spirits like himself. He is famed for no quality either great or
  good. Violent passions and intemperate lusts are what he is chiefly noted
  for. But, except that pride and arrogance are writ upon the lines of his
  countenance, you would hardly guess that his light-tinted and beardless
  cheeks and soft blue eyes belonged to one of so dark and foul a soul. His
  frame and his strength are those of a giant; yet is he wholly destitute of
  grace. His limbs seem sometimes as if they were scarcely a part of him, such
  difficulty does he discover in marshalling them aright. Consciousness of this
  embarrasses him, and sends him for refuge to his pride, which darts looks of
  anger and bitter revenge upon all who offend or make light of him. His
  ambition is, and his hope, to succeed Zenobia. You may think this strange,
  considering the family of the Queen. But as for the sons of Zenobia, he
  calculates much, so it is reported, upon their weakness both of mind and
  body, as rendering them distasteful to the Palmyrenes, even if they should
  live; and as for Julia and her sisters, he has so high conceptions of his own
  superior merit, that he doubts not in case of the Queen's demise, that the
  people would by acclamation select him, in preference to them, as her
  successor; or in the last emergency, that it would be but to marry Julia, in
  order to secure the throne beyond any peradventure. These are the schemes
  which many do not scruple to impute to him. Whether credited or not by
  Zenobia, I cannot tell. But were they, I believe she would but smile at the
  poor lack-brain who entertains them. Intrenched as she is in the impregnable
  fortress of her people's heart, she might well despise the intrigues of a
  bolder and worthier spirit than Antiochus. For him she can spare neither
  words nor thoughts.</p>

  <p>It was Fausta who a few days ago, as we rose from the tables, proposed
  that we should try our strength and skill in throwing the lance. 'I promised
  you, Lucius,' said she, 'that when here, you should be permitted to judge of
  my abilities in that art. Are all ready for the sport?'</p>

  <p>All sprang from their seats, like persons weary of one occupation, and
  grateful for the proffer of another.</p>

  <p>Zenobia led the way to the grounds, not far from the palace, appropriated
  to games of this kind, and to the various athletic sports. Not all the
  company entered the lists, but many seated themselves, or stood around,
  spectators of the strife. Slaves now appeared, bearing the lances, and
  preparing the ground for our exercise. The feat to be performed seemed to me
  not difficult so much as impossible. It was to throw the lance with such
  unerring aim and force, as to pass through an aperture in a shield of
  four-fold ox-hide, of a size but slightly larger than the beam of the lance,
  so as not so much as to graze the sides of the perforated place. The distance
  too of the point from which the lance was to be thrown, from the shield, was
  such as to require great strength of arm to overcome it.</p>

  <p>The young Caesars advanced first to the trial. 'Now,' whispered Fausta,
  'behold the vigor of the royal arm. Were such alone our defence, well might
  Palmyra tremble.'</p>

  <p>Herennianus, daintily handling and brandishing his lance, in the manner
  prescribed at the schools, where skill in all warlike arts is taught, and
  having drawn all eyes upon him, at length let it fly, when, notwithstanding
  so much preparatory flourish, it fell short of the staff upon which the
  shield was reared.</p>

  <p>'Just from the tables,' said the prince, as he withdrew, angry at his so
  conspicuous failure; 'and how can one reach what he can scarcely see?'</p>

  <p>'Our arm has not yet recovered from its late injury,' said Timolaus, as he
  selected his weapon; 'yet will we venture a throw.' His lance reached the
  mast, but dropped feebly at his foot. Vabalathus, saying nothing, and putting
  all his strength in requisition, drove his weapon into the staff, where it
  stood quivering a moment, and fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>Carias, Seleucus, Otho, Gabrayas, noblemen of Palmyra, now successively
  tried their fortune, and all showed themselves well trained to the use of the
  weapon, by each fixing his lance in the body of the shield, and in the near
  neighborhood of the central hole.</p>

  <p>Zabdas now suddenly springing from his seat, which he had taken among
  those who apparently declined to join in the sport, seized a lance from the
  hands of the slave who bore them, and hurling it with the force of a tempest,
  the weapon, hissing along the air, struck the butt near the centre; but the
  wood of which it was made, unused to such violence, shivered and crumbled
  under the blow. Without a word, and without an emotion, so far as the face
  was its index, the Egyptian returned to his seat. It seemed as if he had done
  the whole in his sleep. It is actual war alone that can rouse the energies of
  Zabdas.</p>

  <p>Zenobia, who had stood leaning upon her lance, next advanced to the trial.
  Knowing her admirable skill at all manly exercises, I looked with certainty
  to see her surpass those who had already essayed their powers. Nor was I
  disappointed. With a wonderful grace she quickly threw herself into the
  appointed position, and with but a moment's preparation, and as if it cost
  her but a slight effort, sent her lance, with unerring aim and incredible
  swiftness, through the hole. Yet was not the feat a perfect one. For, in
  passing through the aperture, the weapon not having been driven with quite
  sufficient force, did not preserve its level, so that the end grazed the
  shield, and the lance then consequently taking an oblique direction, plunged
  downward and buried its head in the turf.</p>

  <p>'Now, Fausta,' said the Queen, 'must you finish what I have but begun. Let
  us now see your weapon sweep on till its force shall be evenly spent.'</p>

  <p>'When Zenobia fails,' said Fausta, 'there must be some evil influence
  abroad that shall cripple the powers of others yet more. However, let me try;
  for I have promised to prove to our Roman friend that the women, of Palmyra
  know the use of arms not less than the men.'</p>

  <p>So saying, she chose her lance, and with little ceremony, and almost
  before our eyes could trace her movements, the weapon had flown, and passing
  through, as it seemed, the very centre of the perforated space, swept on till
  its force died away in the distance, and it fell gracefully to the
  ground.</p>

  <p>A burst of applause arose from the surrounding groups.</p>

  <p>'I knew,' said Zenobia, 'that I could trust the fame, of the women of
  Palmyra to you. At the harp, the needle, or the lance, our Fausta has no
  equal; unless,' turning herself round, 'in my own Julia. Now we will see what
  your arm can do.'</p>

  <p>Standing near the lances, I selected one eminent for its smoothness and
  polish, and placed it in her hand.</p>

  <p>With a form of so much less apparent vigor than either Zenobia or Fausta,
  so truly Syrian in a certain soft languor that spreads itself over her,
  whether at rest or in motion, it was amazing to see with what easy strength
  she held and balanced the heavy weapon. Every movement showed that there lay
  concealed within her ample power for this and every manly exercise, should
  she please to put it forth.</p>

  <p>'At the schools,' said the princess, 'Fausta and I went on ever with equal
  steps. Her advantage lies in being at all times mistress of her power. My arm
  is often treacherous, through failure of the heart.'</p>

  <p>It was not difficult to see the truth of what she said, in her varying
  color, and the slightly agitated lance.</p>

  <p>But addressing herself to the sport, and with but one instant's pause, the
  lance flew toward the shield, and entering the opening, but not with a
  perfect direction, it passed not through, but hung there by the head.</p>

  <p>'Princess,' said Zabdas, springing from his repose with more than wonted
  energy, 'that lance was chosen, as I saw, by a Roman. Try once more with one
  that I shall choose, and see what the issue will be.'</p>

  <p>'Truly,' said Julia, 'I am ready to seize any plea under which to redeem
  my fame. But first give me yourself a lesson, will you not?'</p>

  <p>The Egyptian was not deaf to the invitation, and once more essaying the
  feat, and with his whole soul bent to the work, the lance, quicker than
  sight, darted from his hand, and following in the wake of Fausta's, lighted
  farther than hers&mdash;being driven with more force&mdash;upon the lawn.</p>

  <p>The princess now, with more of confidence in her air, again balanced and
  threw the lance which Zabdas had chosen&mdash;this time with success; for,
  passing through the shield, it fell side by side with Fausta's.</p>

  <p>'Fortune still unites us,' said Julia; 'if for a time she leaves me a
  little in the rear, yet she soon repents of the wrong, and brings me up.'
  Saying which, she placed herself at Fausta's side.</p>

  <p>'But come, our worthy cousin,' said the Queen, now turning and addressing
  Antiochus, who stood with folded arms, dully surveying the scene, 'will you
  not try a lance?'</p>

  <p>'Tis hardly worth our while,' said he, 'for the gods seem to have
  delivered all the honor and power of the East into the hands of women.'</p>

  <p>'Yet it may not be past redemption,' said Julia, 'and who more likely than
  Hercules to achieve so great a work? Pray begin.'</p>

  <p>That mass of a man, hardly knowing whether the princess were jesting or in
  earnest&mdash;for to the usual cloud that rested upon his intellect, there
  was now added the stupidity arising from free indulgence at the
  tables&mdash;slowly moved toward the lances, and selecting the longest and
  heaviest, took his station at the proper place. Raising then his arm, which
  was like a weaver's beam, and throwing his enormous body into attitudes which
  showed that no child's play was going on, he let drive the lance, which,
  shooting with more force than exactness of aim, struck upon the outer rim of
  the shield, and then glancing sideways was near spearing a poor slave, whose
  pleasure it was, with others, to stand in the neighborhood of the butt, to
  pick up and return the weapons thrown, or withdraw them from the shield,
  where they might have fastened themselves.</p>

  <p>Involuntary laughter broke forth upon this unwonted performance of the
  lance; upon which it was easy to see, by the mounting color of Antiochus,
  that his passions were inflamed. Especially&mdash;did we afterward
  suppose&mdash;was he enraged at the exclamation of one of the slaves near the
  shield, who was heard to say to his fellow: 'Now is the reign of women at an
  end.' Seizing, however, on the instant, another lance, he was known to
  exclaim, by a few who stood near him, but who did not take the meaning of his
  words: 'With a better mark, there may be a better aim.' Then resuming his
  position, he made at first, by a long and steady aim, as if he were going,
  with certainty now, to hit the shield; but, changing suddenly the direction
  of his lance, he launched it with fatal aim, and a giant's force, at the
  slave who had uttered those words. It went through him, as he had been but a
  sheet of papyrus, and then sung along the plain. The poor wretch gave one
  convulsive leap into the air, and dropped dead.</p>

  <p>'Zenobia!' exclaimed Julia.</p>

  <p>'Great Queen!' said Fausta.</p>

  <p>'Shameful!'&mdash;'dastardly!'&mdash;'cowardly!'&mdash;broke from one and
  another of the company.</p>

  <p>'That's the mark I never miss,' observed Antiochus; and at the same time
  regaled his nose from a box of perfume.</p>

  <p>'Tis his own chattel,' said the Queen; 'he may do with it as he lists. He
  has trenched upon no law of the realm, but only upon those of breeding and
  humanity. Our presence, and that of this company, might, we think, have
  claimed a more gentle observance.'</p>

  <p>'Dogs!' fiercely shouted Antiochus&mdash;who, as the Queen said these
  words, her eyes fastened indignantly upon him, had slunk sulkily to his
  seat&mdash;'dogs,' said he, aiming suddenly to brave the matter, 'off with
  yonder carrion!&mdash;it offends the Queen.'</p>

  <p>'Would our cousin,' said Zenobia, 'win the hearts of Palmyra, this surely
  is a mistaken way. Come, let us to the palace. This spot is tainted. But that
  it may he sweetened as far as may be, slaves!' she cried, 'bring to the gates
  the chariot, and other remaining chattels of Antiochus!'</p>

  <p>Antiochus, at these words, pale with the apprehensions of a cowardly
  spirit, rose and strode toward the palace, from which, in a few moments, he
  was seen on his way to the city.</p>

  <p>'You may judge me needlessly harsh, Piso,' said the Queen, as we now
  sauntered toward the palace, 'but truly the condition of the slave is such,
  that seeing the laws protect him not, we must do something to enlist in his
  behalf the spirit of humanity. The breach of courtesy, however, was itself
  not to be forgiven.'</p>

  <p>'It was a merciful fate of the slave,' said I, 'compared with what our
  Roman slaves suffer. To be lashed to death, or crucified, or burned, or
  flayed alive, or torn by dogs, or thrown as food for fishes, is something
  worse than this quick exit of the thrall of Antiochus. You of these softer
  climes are in your natures milder than we, and are more moved by scenes like
  this. What would you think, Queen, to see not one, but scores or hundreds of
  these miserable beings, upon bare suspicion of attempts against their
  master's life, condemned, by their absolute irresponsible possessors, to
  death in all its most revolting forms? Nay, even our Roman women, of highest
  rank, and gentlest nurture, stand by while their slaves are scourged, or
  themselves apply the lash. If under this torture they die, it is thought of
  but as of the death of vermin. War has made with us this sort of property of
  so cheap possession, that to destroy it is often a useful measure of economy.
  By a Roman, nothing is less regarded than life. And in truth, I see not how
  it can be otherwise.'</p>

  <p>'But surely,' said Julia, 'you do not mean to defend this condition of
  life. It is not like the sentiments I have heard you express,'</p>

  <p>'I defend it only thus,'I replied: 'so long as we have wars&mdash;and when
  will they cease?&mdash;there must be captives; and what can these be but
  slaves? To return them to their own country, were to war to no purpose. To
  colonize them were to strip war of its horrors. To make them freemen of our
  own soil, were to fill the land with foes and traitors. Then if there must be
  slaves, there must be masters and owners. And the absolute master of other
  human beings, responsible to no one, can be no other than a tyrant. If he
  has, as he must have, the power to punish at will, he will exercise it, and
  that cruelly. If he has the power to kill, as he must have, then will he kill
  and kill cruelly when his nature prompts. And this his nature will prompt, or
  if not his nature absolutely, yet his educated nature. Our children grow up
  within the sight and sound of all the horrors and sufferings of this state of
  things. They use their slaves&mdash;with which, almost in infancy, they are
  provided&mdash;according to their pleasure&mdash;as dogs, as horses; they
  lash, they scourge them, long before they have the strength to kill. What
  wonder if the boy, who, when a boy, used a slave as his beast of burden, or
  his footstool, when he grows to be a man, should use him as a mark to be shot
  at? The youth of Antiochus was reared in Rome. I presume to say that his
  earliest play-things were slaves, and the children of slaves. I am not
  surprised at his act. And such acts are too common in Rome for this to
  disturb me much. The education of Antiochus was continued and completed, I
  may venture also to say, at the circus. I think the result very natural. It
  cannot be very different, where slavery and the sports of the amphitheatre
  exist.'</p>

  <p>'I perceive your meaning,' said Julia; 'Antiochus you affirm to be the
  natural product of the customs and institutions which now prevail. It is
  certainly so, and must continue so, until some new element shall be
  introduced into society, that shall ultimately reform its practices, by first
  exalting the sentiments and the character of the individual. Such an element
  do I detect&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'In Christianity,' said Fausta; 'this is your panacea. May it prove all
  you desire; yet methinks it gives small promise, seeing it has already been
  at work more than two hundred years, and has accomplished no more.'</p>

  <p>'A close observer,' replied Julia, 'sees much of the effect of
  Christianity beside that which appears upon the surface. If I err not
  greatly, a few years more will reveal what this religion has been doing these
  two centuries and more. Revolutions which are acted out in a day, have often
  been years or centuries in preparation. An eye that will see, may see the
  final issue, a long time foreshadowed in the tendencies and character of a
  preceding age.'</p>

  <p>The princess uttered this with earnestness. I have reflected upon it. And
  if you, my Curtius, will look around upon the state of the empire, you will
  find many things to startle you. But of this another time.</p>

  <p>Assembled in the evening in the court of the elephant, we were made to
  forget whatever had proved disagreeable during the day, while we listened to
  the 'Frogs,' read by Julia and Longinus.</p>

  <p>The following day was appointed for the chase, and early in the morning I
  was waked by the braying of trumpets, and the baying of dogs. I found the
  Queen already mounted and equipped for the sport, surrounded by Zabdas,
  Longinus, and a few of the nobles of Palmyra. We were soon joined by Julia
  and Fausta. In order to insure our sport, a tiger, made fierce by being for
  some days deprived of food, had the preceding evening been let loose from the
  royal collection into the neighboring forests. These forests, abounding in
  game, commence immediately, as it were, in the rear of the palace. They
  present a boundless continuity of crag, mountain, and wooded plain, offering
  every variety of ground to those who seek the pleasures of the chase. The sun
  had not been long above the horizon when we sallied forth from the palace
  gates, and from the smooth and shaven fields of the royal demesne, plunged at
  once into the</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was a moment of inexpressible horror. At the same
instant, our eyes
  caught the form of the famished tiger, just in the act to spring from the
  crag upon the unconscious Queen. But before we had time to alarm
  Zenobia&mdash;which would indeed have been useless&mdash;a shaft from an
  unerring arm arrested the monster midair, whose body then tumbled heavily at
  the feet of Zenobia's Arab. The horse, rearing with affright, had nearly
  dashed the Queen against the opposite rocks, but keeping her seat, she soon,
  by her powerful arm and complete horsemanship, reduced him to his obedience,
  though trembling like a terrified child through every part of his body. A
  thrust from my hunting spear quickly despatched the dying beast. We now
  gathered around the Queen.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Hardly were we arrived at the lawn in front of the palace,
when a cloud of
  dust was observed to rise in the direction of the road to Palmyra, as if
  caused by a body of horse in rapid movement. 'What may this mean?' said
  Zenobia: 'orders were strict, that our brief retirement should not be
  disturbed. This indicates an errand of some urgency.'</p>

  <p>'Some embassy from abroad, perhaps,' said Julia, 'that cannot brook delay.
  It may be from your great brother at Rome.'</p>

  <p>While we, in a sportive humor, indulged in various conjectures, an
  official of the palace announced the approach of a Roman herald, 'who craved
  permission to address the Queen of Palmyra.' He was ordered to advance.</p>

  <p>In a few moments, upon a horse covered with dust and foam, appeared the
  Roman herald. Without one moment's hesitancy, he saw in Zenobia the Queen,
  and taking off his helmet, said, 'that Caius Petronius, and Cornelius Varro,
  ambassadors of Aurelian, were in waiting at the outer gates of the palace,
  and asked a brief audience of the Queen of Palmyra, upon affairs of deepest
  interest, both to Zenobia and the Emperor.'</p>

  <p>'It is not our custom,' said Zenobia in reply, 'when seeking repose, as
  now, from the cares of state, to allow aught to break it. But we will not be
  selfish nor churlish. Bid the servants of your Emperor draw near, and we will
  hear them.'</p>

  <p>I was not unwilling that the messengers of Aurelian should see Zenobia
  just as she was now. Sitting upon her noble Arabian, and leaning upon her
  hunting spear, her countenance glowing with a higher beauty than ever before,
  as it seemed to me&mdash;her head surmounted with a Parthian hunting-cap,
  from which drooped a single ostrich feather, springing from a diamond worth a
  nation's rental, her costume also Parthian, and revealing in the most perfect
  manner the just proportions of her form&mdash;I thought I had never seen even
  her, when she so filled and satisfied the eye and the mind&mdash;and, for
  that moment, I was almost a traitor to Aurelian. Had Julia filled her seat, I
  should have been quite so. As it was, I could worship her who sat her steed
  with no less grace, upon the left of the Queen, without being guilty of that
  crime. On Zenobia's right were Longinus and Zabdas, Gracchus, and the other
  noblemen of Palmyra. I and Fausta were near Julia. In this manner, just as we
  had come in from the chase, did we await the ambassadors of Aurelian.</p>

  <p>Announced by trumpets, and followed by their train, they soon wheeled into
  the lawn, and advanced toward the Queen.</p>

  <p>'Caius Petronius and Cornelius Varro,' said Zenobia, first addressing the
  ambassadors, and moving toward them a few paces, 'we bid you heartily welcome
  to Palmyra. If we receive you thus without form, you must take the blame
  partly to yourselves, who have sought us with such haste. We put by the
  customary observances, that we may cause you no delay. These whom you see are
  all friends or counsellors. Speak your errand without restraint.'</p>

  <p>'We come,' replied Petronius, 'as you may surmises great Queen, upon no
  pleasing errand. Yet we cannot but persuade ourselves, that the Queen of
  Palmyra will listen to the proposals of Aurelian, and preserve the good
  understanding which has lasted so long between the West and the East. There
  have been brought already to your ears, if I have been rightly informed,
  rumors of dissatisfaction on the part of our Emperor, with the affairs of the
  East, and of plans of an eastern expedition. It is my business now to say,
  that these rumors have been well founded. I am further to say, that the
  object at which Aurelian has aimed, in the preparations he has made, is not
  Persia, but Palmyra.'</p>

  <p>'He does us too much honor,' said Zenobia, her color rising, and her eye
  kindling; 'and what, may I ask, are specifically his demands, and the price
  of peace?'</p>

  <p>'For a long series of years,' replied the ambassador, 'the wealth of Egypt
  and the East, as you are aware, flowed into the Roman treasury. That stream
  has been diverted to Palmyra. Egypt, and Syria, and Bithynia, and
  Mesopotamia, were dependants upon Rome, and Roman provinces. It is needless
  to say what they now are. The Queen of Palmyra was once but the Queen of
  Palmyra; she is now Queen of Egypt and of the East&mdash;Augusta of the Roman
  empire&mdash;her sons styled and arrayed as Caesars. By whatever consent of
  former emperors these honors have been won or permitted, it is not, we are
  required to say, with the consent of Aurelian. By whatever service in behalf
  of Rome they may, in the judgment of some, be thought to be deserved, in the
  judgment of Aurelian the reward exceeds greatly the value of the service
  rendered. But while we would not be deemed insensible to those services, and
  while he honors the greatness and the genius of Zenobia, he would, he
  conceives, be unfaithful to the interests of those who have raised him to his
  high office, if he did not require that in the East, as in the West, the
  Roman empire should again be restored to the limits which bounded it in the
  reigns of the virtuous Antonines. This he holds essential to his own honor,
  and the glory of the Roman world.'</p>

  <p>'You have delivered yourself, Caius Petronius,' replied the Queen, in a
  calm and firm voice, 'as it became a Roman to do, with plainness, and as I
  must believe, without reserve. So far I honor you. Now hear me, and as you
  hear, so report to him who sent you. Tell Aurelian that what I am, I have
  made myself; that the empire which hails me Queen has been moulded into what
  it is by Odenatus and Zenobia; it is no gift, but an inheritance&mdash;a
  conquest and a possession; it is held, not by favor, but by right of birth
  and power; and that when he will give away possessions or provinces which he
  claims as his or Rome's, for the asking, I will give away Egypt and the
  Mediterranean coast. Tell him that as I have lived a queen, so, the gods
  helping, I will die a queen,&mdash;that the last moment of my reign and my
  life shall be the same. If he is ambitious, let him be told that I am
  ambitious too&mdash;ambitious of wider and yet wider empire&mdash;of an
  unsullied fame, and of my people's love. Tell him I do not speak of gratitude
  on the part of Rome, but that posterity will say, that the Power which stood
  between Rome and Persia, and saved the empire in the East, which avenged the
  death of Valerian, and twice pursued the king of kings as far as the gates of
  Ctesiphon, deserved some fairer acknowledgment than the message you now
  bring, at the hands of a Roman emperor.'</p>

  <p>'Let the Queen,' quickly rejoined Petronius, but evidently moved by what
  he had heard, 'let the Queen fully take me. Aurelian purposes not to invade
  the fair region where I now am, and where my eyes are rejoiced by this goodly
  show of city, plain and country. He hails you Queen of Palmyra! He does but
  ask again those appendages of your greatness, which have been torn from Rome,
  and were once members of her body.'</p>

  <p>'Your emperor is gracious indeed!' replied the Queen, smiling; 'if he may
  hew off my limbs, he will spare the trunk!&mdash;and what were the trunk
  without the limbs?'</p>

  <p>'And is this,' said Petronius, his voice significant of inward grief,
  'that which I must carry back to Rome? Is there no hope of a better
  adjustment?'</p>

  <p>'Will not the Queen of Palmyra delay for a few days her final answer?'
  added Varro: 'I see, happily, in her train, a noble Roman, from whom, as well
  as from us, she may obtain all needed knowledge of both the character and
  purposes of Aurelian. We are at liberty to wait her pleasure.'</p>

  <p>'You have our thanks, Romans, for your courtesy, and we accept your offer;
  although in what I have said, I think I have spoken the sense of my
  people.'</p>

  <p>'You have indeed, great Queen,' interrupted Zabdas with energy.</p>

  <p>'Yet I owe it to my trusty counsellor, the great Longinus,' continued the
  Queen, 'and who now thinks not with me, to look farther into the
  reasons&mdash;which, because they are his, must be strong ones&mdash;-by
  which he supports an opposite judgment.'</p>

  <p>'Those reasons have now,' said the Greek, 'lost much or all of their
  force,'&mdash;Zabdas smiled triumphantly&mdash;'yet still I would advocate
  delay.'</p>

  <p>'Let it be so then,' said the Queen; 'and in the meanwhile, let the
  ambassadors of Aurelian not refuse the hospitalities of the Eastern Queen.
  Our palace is yours, while it shall please you to remain.'</p>

  <p>'For the night and the morning, we accept your offers; then, as strangers
  in this region, we would return to the city, to see better than we have yet
  done the objects which it presents. It seemed to us, on a hasty glance,
  surrounded by its luxuriant plains, like the habitation of gods. We would
  dwell there a space.'</p>

  <p>'It shall be as you will. Let me now conduct you to the palace.'</p>

  <p>So saying, Zenobia, putting spurs to her horse, led the way to the palace,
  followed by a long train of Romans and Palmyrenes. The generous hospitality
  of the tables closed the day and wore away the night.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="letter07"
     id="letter07">LETTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">YOU will be glad to learn, my Curtius, that the time has
now come, when I
  may with reason look for news from Isaac, or for his return. It was his
  agreement to write of his progress, so soon as he should arrive at Ecbatana.
  But since he would consume but a very few days in the accomplishment of his
  task, if, the gods helping, he should be able to accomplish it at all, I may
  see him even before I hear from him, and, O day thrice happy! my brother
  perhaps with him. Yet am I not without solicitude, even though Calpurnius
  should return. For how shall I meet him?&mdash;as a Persian, or a
  Roman?&mdash;as a friend, or an enemy? As a brother, I can never cease to
  love him; as a public enemy of Rome, I may be obliged to condemn him.</p>

  <p>You have indeed gratified me by what you have said concerning the public
  works in which the emperor is now engaged. Would that the erection of temples
  and palaces might draw away his thoughts from the East. The new wall, of so
  much wider sweep, with which he is now enclosing the city, is well worthy the
  greatness of his genius. Yet do we, my Curtius, perceive in this rebuilding
  and strengthening of the walls of Rome, no indication of our country's
  decline? Were Rome vigorous and sound, as once, in her limbs, what were the
  need of this new defence about the heart? It is to me a confession of
  weakness, rather than any evidence of greatness and strength. Aurelian
  achieves more for Rome by the strictness of his discipline, and his
  restoration of the ancient simplicity and severity among the troops, than he
  could by a triple wall about the metropolis. Rome will then already have
  fallen, when a Gothic army shall have penetrated so far as even to have seen
  her gates. The walls of Rome are her living and moving walls of flesh. Her
  old and crumbling ramparts of masonry, upon which we have so often climbed in
  sport, rolling down into the surrounding ditch huge masses, have ever been to
  me, when I have thought of them, pregnant signs of security and power.</p>

  <p>The ambassadors, Petronius and Varro, early on the morning succeeding
  their interview with the Queen, departed for the city. They were soon
  followed by Zenobia and her train of counsellors and attendants. It had been
  before agreed that the princess, Fausta, and myself, should remain longer at
  the palace, for the purpose of visiting, as had been proposed, the aged
  Christian hermit, whose retreat is among the fastnesses of the neighboring
  mountains. I would rather have accompanied the Queen, seeing it was so
  certain that important interviews and discussions would take place, when they
  should be all returned once more to the city. I suppose this was expressed in
  my countenance, for the Queen, as she took her seat in the chariot, turned
  and said to me: 'We shall soon see you again in the city. A few hours in the
  mountains will be all that Julia will require; and sure I am that the wisdom
  of St. Thomas will more than repay you for what you may lose in Palmyra. Our
  topics will relate but to worldly aggrandizement&mdash;yours to more
  permanent interests.'</p>

  <p>How great a pity that the love of glory has so fastened upon the heart of
  this wonderful woman; else might she live, and reign, and die the object of
  universal idolatry. But set as her heart is upon conquest and universal
  empire throughout the East, and of such marvellous power to subdue every
  intellect, even the strongest, to her will, I can see nothing before her but
  a short and brilliant career, ending in ruin, absolute and complete. Zenobia
  has not, or will not allow it to be seen that she has, any proper conception
  of the power of Rome. She judges of Rome by the feeble Valerian, and the
  unskilful Heraclianus, and by their standard measures such men as Aurelian,
  and Probus, and Carus. She may indeed gain a single battle, for her genius is
  vast, and her troops well disciplined and brave. But the loss of a battle
  would be to her the loss of empire, while to Rome it would be but as the
  sting of a summer insect. Yet this she does not or will not see. To triumph
  over Aurelian is, I believe, the vision that dazzles, deludes, and will
  destroy her.</p>

  <p>No sooner had the Queen and her train departed, than, mounting our horses,
  we took our way, Julia, Fausta, and myself, through winding valleys and over
  rugged hills, toward the hermit's retreat. Reaching the base of what seemed
  an almost inaccessible crag, we found it necessary to leave our horses in the
  care of attendant slaves, and pursue the remainder of the way on foot. The
  hill which we now had to ascend was thickly grown over with every variety of
  tree and bush, with here and there a mountain stream falling from rock to
  rock, and forcing its way to the valley below. The sultry heat of the day
  compelled us frequently to pause, as we toiled up the side of the hill,
  seating ourselves, now beneath the dark shadows of a branching cedar or the
  long-lived terebinth, and now on the mossy banks of a descending brook. The
  mingled beauty and wildness of the scene, together with such companions, soon
  drove the Queen, Rome, and Palmyra, from my thoughts. I could not but wish
  that we might lose our way to the hermit's cave, that by such means our walk
  might be prolonged.</p>

  <p>'Is it, I wonder,' said Fausta, 'the instruction of his religion which
  confines this Christian saint to these distant solitudes? What a singular
  faith it must be which should drive all who embrace it to the woods and
  rocks! What would become of our dear Palmyra, were it to be changed to a
  Christian city? The same event, I suppose, Julia, would change it to a
  desert.'</p>

  <p>'I do not think Christianity prescribes this mode of life, though. I do
  not know but it may permit it,' replied the princess. 'But of this, the
  Hermit will inform us. He may have chosen this retreat on account of his
  extreme age, which permits him no longer to engage in the affairs of an
  active life.'</p>

  <p>'I trust for the sake of Christianity it is so,' added Fausta; 'for I
  cannot conceive of a true religion inculcating, or even permitting
  inactivity. What would become of the world, if it could be proved that the
  gods required us to pass our days in retired contemplation?'</p>

  <p>'Yet it cannot be denied,' said Julia, 'that the greatest benefactors of
  mankind have been those who have in solitude, and with patient labor, pursued
  truth till they have discovered it, and then revealed it to shed its light
  and heat upon the world.'</p>

  <p>'For my part,' replied Fausta, 'I must think that they who have sowed and
  reaped, have been equal benefactors. The essential truths are instinctive and
  universal. As for the philosophers, they have, with few exceptions, been
  occupied as much about mere frivolities as any Palmyrene lady at her toilet.
  Still, I do not deny that the contemplative race is a useful one in its way.
  What I say is, that a religion which enjoined a solitary life as a duty,
  would be a very mischievous religion. And what is more, any such precept,
  fairly proved upon it, would annihilate all its claims to a divine origin.
  For certainly, if it were made a religious duty for one man to turn an idle,
  contemplative hermit, it would be equally the duty of every other, and then
  the arts of life by which we subsist would be forsaken. Any of the prevalent
  superstitions, if we may not call them religions, were better than this.'</p>

  <p>'I agree with you entirely,' said Julia; 'but my acquaintance with the
  Christian writings is not such as to enable me to say with confidence that
  they contain no such permission or injunction. Indeed some of them I have not
  even read, and much I do not fully understand. But as I have seen and read
  enough to believe firmly that Christianity is a divine religion, my reason
  teaches me that it contains no precept such as we speak of.'</p>

  <p>We had now, in the course of our walk, reached what we found to be a broad
  and level ledge, about half way to the summit of the hill. It was a spot
  remarkable for a sort of dark and solemn beauty, being set with huge
  branching trees, whose tops were woven into a roof, through which only here
  and there the rays of the fierce sun could find their way. The turf beneath,
  unincumbered with any smaller growth of tree or shrub, was sprinkled with
  flowers that love the shade. The upper limit of this level space was bounded
  by precipitous rocks, up which ascent seemed difficult or impossible, and the
  lower by similar ones, to descend which seemed equally difficult or
  impossible.</p>

  <p>'If the abode of the Christian is hereabouts,' we said, 'it seems well
  chosen both for its security and the exceeding beauty of the various objects
  which greet the eye.'</p>

  <p>'Soon as we shall have passed that tumbling rivulet,' said Julia, 'it will
  come into view.'</p>

  <p>Upon a rude bridge of fallen trunks of trees, we passed the stream as it
  crossed our path, and which then shooting over the edge of the precipice, was
  lost among the rocks and woods below. A cloud of light spray fell upon us as
  we stood upon the bridge, and imparted a most refreshing coolness.</p>

  <p>'Where you see,' said Julia, 'that dark entrance, beneath yonder low-
  browed rock, is the dwelling of the aged Christian.'</p>

  <p>We moved on with slow and silent steps, our spirits partaking of the
  stillness and solitariness of the place. We reached the front of the grotto,
  without disturbing the meditations of the venerable man. A part of the rock
  which formed his dwelling served him for a seat, and another part projecting
  after the manner of a shelf, served him for a table, upon which lay unrolled
  a large volume. Bending over the book, his lean and shrivelled finger
  pointing to the words, and aiding his now dim and feeble eye, he seemed
  wholly wrapped in the truths he was contemplating, and heeded not our
  presence. We stood still for a moment, unwilling to break a repose so
  peaceful and profound. At length, raising his eyes from the page, they caught
  the form and face of the princess, who stood nearest to him. A quick and
  benignant smile lighted up his features; and rising slowly to his full
  height, he bade her welcome, with sweet and tremulous tones, to his humble
  roof.</p>

  <p>'It is kind in you,' said he,'so soon again to ascend these rough
  solitudes, to visit a now unprofitable old, man; and more kind still to bring
  others with you. Voices from the world ring a sweet music in my
  ear&mdash;sweeter than any sound of bird or stream. Enter, friends, if it
  please you, and be rested, after the toil of your ascent.'</p>

  <p>'I bring you here, father,' said Julia, 'according to my sometime promise,
  my friend and companion, the daughter of Gracchus, and with her a noble
  Roman, of the house of Piso, lately come hither from the capital of the
  world.'</p>

  <p>'They are very, very welcome,' replied the saint, 'your presence breaks
  most gratefully the monotony of my life.'</p>

  <p>'We almost doubted,' said I, 'venerable Father, whether it would please
  you to find beneath your roof those who receive not your belief, and what is
  much more, belong to a faith which has poured upon you and yours so full a
  flood of suffering and reproach. But your countenance assures us that we have
  erred.'</p>

  <p>'You have, indeed,' replied the sage; 'as a Christian I see in you not
  pagans and unbelievers, not followers of Plato and Epicurus, not dwellers in
  Rome or Alexandria, but members of the great family of man, and as such I
  greet you, and already love you. The design of christianity is to unite and
  draw together, not divide and drive asunder. It teaches its disciples,
  indeed, to go out and convert the world, but if they cannot convert it, it
  still teaches them to love it. My days and my strength have been spent in
  preaching Christ to Jews and heathen, and many of those who have heard have
  believed. But more have not. These are not my brethren in Christ, but they
  are my brethren in God, and I love them as his.'</p>

  <p>'These are noble sentiments,' said Fausta. 'Religion has, in almost all
  its forms, condemned utterly all who have not received it in the form in
  which it has been proposed. Rome, indeed, used to be mild and tolerant of
  every shape which the religious sentiment assumed. But since the appearance
  of christianity it has wholly changed its policy. I am afraid it formerly
  tolerated, only because it saw nothing to fear. Fearing christianity, it
  seeks to destroy it. That is scarcely generous of you, Lucius; nor very wise
  either&mdash;for surely truth can neither be created nor suppressed by
  applications of force. Such is not the doctrine of christianity, if I
  understand you right.'</p>

  <p>'Lady, most certainly not,' he replied. 'Christianity is offered to
  mankind, not forced upon them. And this supposes in them the power and the
  right to sit in judgement upon its truth. But were not all free judgment
  destroyed, and all worthy reception of it therefore, if any penal
  consequences&mdash;greater or less, of one kind or another, present or
  future&mdash;followed upon its rejection? Rome has done wickedly, in her aim
  to suppress error and maintain truth by force. Is Rome a god to distinguish
  with certainty the one from the other? But alas! Rome is not alone to blame
  in this. Christians themselves are guilty of the same folly and crime. They
  interpret differently the sayings of Christ&mdash;as how should they
  not?&mdash;and the party which is stronger in numbers already begins to
  oppress, with hard usage and language, the weaker party, which presumes to
  entertain its own opinions. The Christians of Alexandria and Rome, fond of
  the ancient philosophy, and desirous to recommend the doctrines of Christ, by
  showing their near accordance with it, have, as many think, greatly
  adulterated the gospel, by mixing up with its truths the fantastic dreams of
  Plato. Others, among whom is our Paul of Antioch, deeming this injurious and
  erroneous, aim to restore the Christian doctrine to the simplicity that
  belongs to it in the original records, and which, for the most part, it still
  retains among the common people. But this is not willingly allowed. On the
  contrary, because Paul cannot see with their eyes and judge with their
  judgment, he is to be driven from his bishopric. Thus do the Christians
  imitate in their treatment of each other their common enemy, the Roman. They
  seem already ashamed of the gentleness of Christ, who would have every mind
  left in its own freedom to believe as its own powers enable it to believe.
  Our good Zenobia, though no Christian, is yet in this respect the truest
  Christian. All within her realm, thought is free as the air that plays among
  these leaves.'</p>

  <p>'But is it not, said Fausta, 'a mark of imperfection in your religion,
  that it cannot control and bind to a perfect life its disciples? Methinks a
  divine religion should manifest its divinity in the superior goodness which
  it forms.'</p>

  <p>'Is not that just?'I added.</p>

  <p>'A divine religion,' he replied, 'may indeed be expected to show its
  heaven-derived power in creating a higher virtue than human systems. And
  this, I am sure, christianity does. I may safely challenge the world to show
  in human form the perfection which dwelt in Jesus, the founder of this
  religion. Yet his character was formed by the power of his own doctrines.
  Among his followers, if there have been none so perfect as he, there have
  been multitudes who have approached him, and have exhibited a virtue which
  was once thought to belong only to philosophers. The world has been
  accustomed to celebrate, with almost divine honors, Socrates, and chiefly
  because of the greatness of mind displayed by him when condemned to drink the
  cup of poison. I can tell you of thousands among the Christians, among common
  and unlearned Christians, who have met death, in forms many times more
  horrible than that in which the Greek encountered it, with equal calmness and
  serenity. This they have been enabled to do simply through the divine force
  of a few great truths, which they have implicitly believed. Beside this,
  consider the many usages of the world, which, while others hold them
  innocent, the Christians condemn them, and abstain from them. It is not to be
  denied that they are the reformers of the age. They are busy, sometimes with
  an indiscreet and violent zeal, in new modeling both the opinions and
  practices of the world. But what then? Are they to be condemned if a single
  fault may be charged upon, them? Must they be perfect, because their religion
  is divine? This might be so, if it were of the nature of religion to operate
  with an irresistible influence upon the mind, producing an involuntary and
  forced obedience. But in such an obedience there would be nothing like what
  we mean by virtue, but something quite inferior in the comparison. A
  religion, for the reason that it is divine, will, with the more certainty,
  make its appeals to a free nature. It will explain the nature and reveal the
  consequences of virtue and vice, but will leave the mind free to choose the
  one or the other. Christianity teaches, that in goodness, and faithfulness to
  the sense of duty, lies the chief good; in these there is a heaven of reward,
  not only now and on earth, but throughout an existence truly immortal. Is it
  not most evident that, with whatever authority this religion may propound its
  doctrines, men not being in a single power coerced, will not, though they may
  receive them, yield to them an equal observance? Hence, even among
  Christians, there must foe, perhaps ever, much imperfection.'</p>

  <p>'Does not this appear to you, Fausta and Piso,' said Julia, as the old man
  paused, 'just and reasonable? Can it be an objection to this faith, that its
  disciples partake of the common weaknesses of humanity? Otherwise, religion
  would be a principle designed, not so much to improve and exalt our nature,
  as to alter it.</p>

  <p>'We allow it readily to be both just and reasonable.'</p>

  <p>'But it seemed to us,' said Fausta, 'as we ascended the mountain, and were
  conversing, to be with certainty a proof of imperfection in your
  religion&mdash;pardon my freedom, we are come as learners, and they who would
  learn, must, without restraint, express their doubts&mdash;that it
  recommended or permitted a recluse and inactive life. Have your days, Father,
  been passed in this deep solitude? and has your religion demanded it?'</p>

  <p>'Your freedom pleases me,' replied the venerable man; 'and I wonder not at
  the question you propose. Not my religion, lady, but an enfeebled and
  decrepit frame chains me to this solitude. I have now outlasted a century,
  and my powers are wasted and gone. I can do little more than sit and ponder
  the truths of this life-giving book, and anticipate the renewed activity of
  that immortal being which it promises. The Christian converts, who dwell
  beneath those roofs which you see gleaming in the valley below, supply the
  few wants which I have. When their labor is done for the day, they sometimes
  come up, bringing with them baskets of fresh or dried fruits, which serve me,
  together with the few roots and berries which I myself can gather as I walk
  this level space, for my food. My thirst I quench at the brook which you have
  just passed. Upon this simple but wholesome nutriment, and breathing this dry
  mountain air, my days may yet be prolonged through many years. But I do not
  covet them, since nature makes me a prisoner. But I submit, because my faith
  teaches me to receive patiently whatever the Supreme Ruler appoints. It is
  not my religion that prescribes this manner of life, or permits it, but as
  the last refuge of an imbecility like mine. Christianity denounces
  selfishness, in all its forms, and what form of selfishness more gross than
  to spend the best of one's days in solitary musing and prayer, all to secure
  one's own salvation? The founder of this religion led an active and laborious
  life. He did good not only to himself by prayer and meditation: he went about
  doing it to others&mdash;seeking out objects whom he might benefit and bless.
  His life was one of active benevolence; and the record of that life is the
  religious code of his followers. No condemnation could be more severe than
  that which the Prophet of Nazareth would pronounce upon such a life as mine
  now is, were it a chosen, voluntary one. But it never has been voluntary.
  Till age dried up the sources of my strength, I toiled night and day in all
  countries and climates, in the face of every danger, in the service of
  mankind. For it is by serving others, that the law of Christ is fulfilled.
  Disinterested labor for others constituted the greatness of Jesus Christ.
  This constitutes true greatness in his followers. I perceive that what I say
  falls upon your ear as a new and strange doctrine. But it is the doctrine of
  christianity. It utterly condemns, therefore, a life of solitary devotion. It
  is a mischievous influence which is now spreading outward from the example of
  that Paul, who suffered so much under the persecution of the Emperor Decius
  and who then, flying to the solitudes of the Egyptian Thebais, has there, in
  the vigor of his days, buried himself in a cave of the earth, that he may
  serve God by forsaking man. His maxim seems to be, "The farther from man, the
  nearer to God"&mdash;-the reverse of the Christian maxim, "The nearer man,
  the nearer God." A disciple of Jesus has truly said: "He who loves not his
  brother whom he hath seen, how shall he love God, whom he hath not seen?"
  This, it may be, Roman, is the first sentence you have ever heard from the
  Christian books.'</p>

  <p>'I am obliged to confess that it is,'I replied. 'I have heretofore lived
  in an easy indifference toward all religions. The popular religion of my
  country I early learned to despise. I have perused the philosophers, and
  examined their systems, from Pythagoras to Seneca, and am now, what I have
  long been, a disciple of none but Pyrrho. My researches have taught me only
  how the more ingeniously to doubt. Wearied at length with a vain inquiry
  after truth that should satisfy and fill me, I suddenly abandoned the
  pursuit, with the resolve never to resume it. I was not even tempted to
  depart from this resolution when Christianity offered itself to my notice;
  for I confounded it with Judaism, and for that, as a Roman, I entertained too
  profound a contempt to bestow upon it a single thought. I must acknowledge
  that the reports which I heard, and which I sometimes read, of the marvellous
  constancy and serenity of the Christians, under accumulated sufferings and
  wrongs, interested my feelings in their behalf; and the thought often arose,
  "Must there not be truth to support such heroism?" But the world went on its
  way, and I with it, and the Christians were forgotten. To a Christian, on my
  voyage across the Mediterranean, I owe much, for my first knowledge of
  Christianity. To the Princess Julia I owe a larger debt still. And now from
  your lips, long accustomed to declare its truths, I have heard what makes me
  truly desirous to hear the whole of that which, in the glimpses I have been
  able to obtain, has afforded so real a satisfaction,'</p>

  <p>'Were you to study the Christian books,' said the recluse, 'you would be
  chiefly struck perhaps with the plainness and simplicity of the doctrines
  there unfolded. You would say that much which you found there, relating to
  the right conduct of life, you had already found scattered through the books
  of the Greek and Roman moralists. You would be startled by no strange or
  appalling truth. You would turn over their leaves in vain in search of such
  dark and puzzling ingenuities as try the wits of those who resort to the
  pages of the Timaeus. A child can understand the essential truths of Christ.
  And the value of Christianity consists not in this, that it puts forth a new,
  ingenious, and intricate system of philosophy, but that it adds to recognised
  and familiar truths divine authority. Some things are indeed new; and much is
  new, if that may be called so which, having been neglected as insignificant
  by other teachers, has by Christ been singled out and announced as primal and
  essential. But the peculiarity of Christianity lies in this, that its voice,
  whether heard in republishing an old and familiar doctrine, or announcing, a
  new one, is not the voice of man, but of God. It is a revelation. It is a
  word from the invisible, unapproachable Spirit of the universe. For this
  Socrates would have been willing to renounce all his wisdom. Is it not this
  which we need? We can theorize and conjecture without end, but cannot relieve
  ourselves of our doubts. They will assail every work of man. We wish to
  repose in a divine assurance. This we have in Christianity. It is a message
  from God. It puts an end to doubt and conjecture. Wise men of all ages have
  agreed in the belief of One God; but not being able to demonstrate his being
  and his unity, they have had no power to change the popular belief, which has
  ever tended to polytheism and idolatry, Christianity teaches this truth with
  the authority of God himself, and already has it become the faith of
  millions. Philosophers have long ago taught that the only safe and happy life
  is a virtuous life. Christianity repeats this great truth, and adds, that it
  is such a life alone that conducts to immortality. Philosophers have
  themselves believed in the doctrine of a future existence, and have died
  hoping to live again; and it cannot be denied that mankind generally have
  entertained an obscure expectation of a renewed being after death. The
  advantage of Christianity consists in this, that it assures us of the reality
  of a future life, on the word and authority of God himself. Jesus Christ
  taught, that all men come forth from death, wearing a new spiritual body, and
  thereafter never die; and to confirm his teaching, he himself being slain,
  rose from the dead, and showed himself to his followers alive, and while they
  were yet looking upon him, ascended to some other and higher world. Surely,
  Roman, though christianity announced nothing more than these great truths,
  yet seeing it puts them forth in the name, and with the authority of God, it
  is a vast accession to our knowledge.'</p>

  <p>'Indeed it cannot be denied,'I answered. 'It would be a great happiness
  too to feel such an assurance, as he must who believes in your religion, of
  another life. Death would then lose every terror. We could approach the close
  of life as calmly and cheerfully, sometimes as gladly, as we now do the close
  of a day of weary travel or toil. It would be but to lie down and rest, and
  sleep, and rise again refreshed by the slumber for the labors and enjoyments
  of a life which should then be without termination, and yet unattended by
  fatigue. I can think of no greater felicity than to be able to perceive the
  truth of such a religion as yours.'</p>

  <p>'This religion of the Christians,' said Fausta, 'seems to be full of
  reasonable and desirable truth&mdash;if it all be truth. But how is this
  great point to be determined? How are we to know whether the founder of this
  religion was in truth a person holding communication with God? The mind will
  necessarily demand a large amount of evidence, before it can believe so
  extraordinary a thing. I greatly fear, Julia, lest I may never be a
  Christian. What is the evidence, Father, with which you trust, to convince
  the mind of an inquirer? It must possess potency, for all the world seems
  flocking to the standard of Christ.'</p>

  <p>'I think, indeed,' replied the saint, 'that it possesses potency. I
  believe its power to be irresistible. But do you ask in sincerity, daughter
  of Gracchus, what to do in order to believe in christianity?'</p>

  <p>'I do, indeed,' answered Fausta. 'But know that my mind is one not easy of
  belief.'</p>

  <p>'Christianity, lady, asks no forced or faint assent. It appeals to human
  reason, and it blames not the conscientious doubter or denier. When it
  requires you to examine, and constitutes you judge, it condemns no honest
  decision. The mind that approaches christianity must be free, and ought to be
  fearless. Hesitate not to reject that which evidence does not substantiate.
  But examine and weigh well the testimony. If then you would know whether
  christianity be true, it is first of all needful that you read and ponder the
  Christian books. These books prove themselves. The religion of Christ is felt
  to be true, as you read the writings in which it is recorded. Just as the
  works of nature prove to the contemplative mind the being of a God, so do the
  books of the Christians prove the truth of their religion. As you read them,
  as your mind embraces the teaching, and above all, the character of Christ,
  you involuntarily exclaim: "This must be true; the sun in the heavens does
  not more clearly point to a divine author, than do the contents of these
  books." You find them utterly unlike any other books&mdash;differing from
  them just in the same infinite and essential way that the works of God differ
  from the works of man.'</p>

  <p>He paused, and we were for a few moments silent. At length Fausta said:
  'This is all very new and strange, Father! Why, Julia, have you never urged
  me to read these books?'</p>

  <p>'The princess,' resumed the hermit, 'has done wisely co leave you to the
  promptings of your own mind. The more every thing in religion is voluntary
  and free, the more worth attaches to it. Christ would not that any should be
  driven or urged to him; but that they should come. Nevertheless the way must
  be pointed out. I have now shown you one way. Let me tell you of another. The
  Christian books bear the names of the persons who profess to have written
  them, and who declare themselves to have lived and to have recorded events
  which happened in the province of Judea, in the reigns of Tiberius and Nero.
  Now it is by no means a difficult matter for a person, desirous to arrive at
  the truth, to institute such inquiries, as shall fully convince him that such
  persons lived then and there, and performed the actions ascribed to them. We
  are not so far removed from those times, but that by resorting to the places
  where the events of the Christian history took place, we can readily satisfy
  ourselves of their truth&mdash;if they be true&mdash;by inquiring of the
  descendants of those who were concerned in the very transactions recorded.
  This thousands and thousands have done, and they believe in the
  events&mdash;strange as they are&mdash;of the Christian history as implicitly
  as they do in the events of the Roman history, for the same period of time.
  Listen, my children, while I rehearse my own experience as a believer in
  Christ.</p>

  <p>'My father, Cyprian, a native of Syria, attained, as I have attained, to
  an extreme old age. At the age of five score years and ten, he died within
  the walls of this quiet dwelling of nature's own hewing, and there at the
  root of that ancient cedar his bones repose. He was for twenty years a
  contemporary of St. John the evangelist&mdash;of that John, who was one of
  the companions of Jesus the founder of christianity, and who ere he died
  wrote a history of Jesus, of his acts and doctrine. From the very lips of
  this holy man, did the youthful but truth-loving and truth-seeking Cyprian
  receive his knowledge of christianity. He sat and listened while the aged
  apostle&mdash;the past rising before him with the distinctness of a
  picture&mdash;told of Jesus; of the mild majesty of his presence; of the
  power and sweetness of his discourse; of the love he bore toward all that
  lived; of his countenance radiant with joy when, in using the miraculous
  power intrusted to show descent from God, he gave health to the pining sick,
  and restored the dying and the dead to the arms of weeping friends. There was
  no point of the history which the apostle has recorded for the instruction of
  posterity, which Cyprian did not hear, with all its minuter circumstances,
  from his own mouth. Nay, he was himself a witness of the exercise of that
  same power of God which was committed without measure to Jesus, on the part
  of the apostle. He stood by&mdash;his spirit wrapt and
  wonderstruck&mdash;while at the name of Jesus the lame walked, the blind
  recovered their sight, and the sick leaped from their couches. When this
  great apostle was fallen asleep, my father, by the counsel of St. John, and
  that his faith might be yet farther confirmed, travelled over all the scenes
  of the Christian history. He visited the towns and cities of Judea, where
  Jesus had done his marvellous works. He conversed with the children of those
  who had been subjects of the healing power of the Messiah. He was with those
  who themselves had mingled among the multitudes who encompassed him, when
  Lazarus was summoned from the grave, and who clung to the cross when Jesus
  was upon it dying, and witnessed the sudden darkness, and felt the quaking of
  the earth. Finding, wherever he turned his steps in Judea, from Bethlehem to
  Nazareth, from the Jordan to the great sea, the whole land filled with those
  who, as either friends or enemies, had hung upon the steps of Jesus, and seen
  his miracles, what was he, to doubt whether such a person as Jesus had ever
  lived, or had ever done those wonderful works? He doubted not; he believed,
  even as he would have done had he himself been present as a disciple. In
  addition to this, he saw at the places where they were kept, the evangelic
  histories, in the writing of those who drew them up; and at Rome, at Corinth,
  at Philippi, at Ephesus, he handled with his own hands the letters of Paul,
  which he wrote to the Christians of those places; and in those places and
  others, did he dwell and converse with multitudes who had seen and heard the
  great apostle, and had witnessed the wonders he had wrought. I, the child of
  Cyprian's old age, heard from him all that I have now recounted to you. I sat
  at his feet, as he had sat at the evangelist's, and from him I heard the
  various experiences of his long, laborious, and troubled life. Could I help
  but believe what I heard?&mdash;and so could I help but be a Christian? My
  father was a man&mdash;and all Syria knows him to have been such an
  one&mdash;of a passionate love of truth. At any moment would he have
  cheerfully suffered torture and death, sooner than have swerved from the
  strictest allegiance to its very letter. Nevertheless, he would not that I
  should trust to him alone, but as the apostle had sent him forth, so he sent
  me forth, to read the evidences of the truth of this religion in the living
  monuments of Judea. I, too, wandered a pilgrim over the hills and plains of
  Galilee. I sat in the synagogue at Nazareth, I dwelt in Capernaum. I mused by
  the shore of the Galilean lake. I haunted the ruins of Jerusalem, and sought
  out the places where the Savior of men had passed the last hours of his life.
  Night after night I wept and prayed upon the Mount of Olives. Wherever I
  went, and among whomsoever I mingled, I found witnesses eloquent and loud,
  and without number, to all the principal facts and events of our sacred
  history. Ten thousand traditions of the life and acts of Christ and his
  apostles, all agreeing substantially with the written records, were passing
  from mouth to mouth, and descending from sire to son. The whole land, in all
  its length and breadth, was but one vast monument to the truth of
  Christianity. And for this purpose it was resorted to by the lovers of truth
  from all parts of the world. Did doubts arise in the mind of a dweller in
  Rome, or Carthage, or Britain, concerning the whole or any part of the
  Christian story, he addressed letters to well known inhabitants of the Jewish
  cities, or he visited them in person, and by a few plain words from another,
  or by the evidence of his own eyes and ears, every doubt was scattered. When
  I had stored my mind with knowledge from these original sources, I then
  betook myself to some of the living oracles of Christian wisdom, with the
  fame of whose learning and piety the world was filled. From the great Clement
  of Rome, from Dionysius at Alexandria, from Tertullian at Carthage, from that
  wonder of human genius, Origen, in his school at Caesarea, I gathered
  together what more was needed to arm me for the Christian warfare; and I then
  went forth full of faith myself to plant its divine seeds in the hearts of
  whosoever would receive them. In this good work my days have been spent. I
  have lived and taught but to unfold to others the evidences which have made
  me a Christian. My children,'continued he, 'why should you not receive my
  words? why should I desire to deceive you? I am an old man, trembling upon
  the borders of the grave. Can I have any wish to injure you? Is it
  conceivable that, standing thus already as it were before the bar of God, I
  could pour false and idle tales into your ears? But if I have spoken truly,
  can you refuse to believe? But I must not urge. Use your freedom. Inquire for
  yourselves. Let the leisure and the wealth which are yours carry you to read
  with your own eyes that wide-spread volume which you will find among the
  mountains and valleys of the holy land. Princess, my strength is spent, or
  there is much more I could gladly add.'</p>

  <p>'My friends,' said the princess, 'are, I am sure, grateful for what you
  have said, and they have heard.'</p>

  <p>'Indeed we are,' said Fausta, 'and heartily do we thank you. One thing
  more would I ask. What think you of the prospects of the Christian faith? Are
  the common reports of its rapid ascendency to be heeded? Is it making its
  way, as we are told, even into the palaces of kings? I know, indeed, what
  happens in Palmyra; but elsewhere, holy father?'</p>

  <p>As Fausta spoke these words, the aged man seemed wrapped in thought. His
  venerable head sank upon his breast; his beard swept the ground. At length,
  slowly raising his head, and with eyes lifted upward, he said, in deep and
  solemn tones: 'It cannot, it cannot be difficult to read the future. It must
  be so. I see it as if it were already come. The throne which is red with
  blood, and he who sits thereon, wielding a sword dropping blood,
  sinks&mdash;sinks&mdash;and disappears; and one all white, and he who sits
  thereon, having upon his frontlet these words, "Peace on earth and good will
  toward men," rises and fills its place. And I hear a movement as of a
  multitude which no man number, coming and worshipping around the throne. God
  of the whole earth, arise!&mdash;visit it with thy salvation! Hasten the
  coming of the universal kingdom of thy Son, when all shall know thee, and
  love to God and love to man possess and fill every soul.'</p>

  <p>As the venerable man uttered this prayer, Julia looked steadfastly upon
  him, and a beauty more than of earth seemed to dwell upon her
  countenance.</p>

  <p>'Father,' said Fausta, 'we are not now fair judges of truth. Your
  discourse has wrought so upon us, that we need reflection before we can tell
  what we ought to believe.'</p>

  <p>'That is just,' said the saint; 'to determine right, we must think as well
  as feel. And that your minds may the sooner return to the proper state, let
  me set before you of such as my dwelling will afford.'</p>

  <p>Saying this, he moved from the seat which till now he had retained, and
  closing the volume he had been reading, laid it away with care, saying as he
  did so, 'This, children, is the Christian's book; not containing all those
  writings which we deem to be of authority in describing our faith, but such
  as are most needful. It is from reading this, and noting as you read the
  inward marks of honesty, and observing how easy it were, even now, by
  visiting Judea, to convict its authors of error and falsehood, had they been
  guilty of either, that your minds will be best able to judge of the truth and
  worth of Christianity.'</p>

  <p>'At another time, father,' said Fausta, 'it would give me great delight,
  and equally too, I am sure, our friend from Rome, if you would read to us
  portions of that volume, that we may know somewhat of its contents from your
  lips, accompanied too by such comments as you might deem useful to learners.
  It is thus we have often heard the Greek and Roman writers from the mouth of
  Longinus.'</p>

  <p>'Whenever,' he replied, 'you shall be willing to ascend these steep and
  rugged paths, in pursuit of truth, I in my turn will stand prepared to teach.
  To behold such listeners before me, brings back the life of former days.'</p>

  <p>He then, with short and interrupted steps, busied himself in bringing
  forth his humble fare. Bread and fruits, and olives, formed our light repast,
  together with ice-cold water, which Julia, seizing from his hand the hermit's
  pitcher, brought from a spring that gushed from a neighboring rock.</p>

  <p>This being ended, and with it much various and agreeable conversation, in
  the course of which the Christian patriarch gave many striking anecdotes of
  his exposed and toilsome life, we rose, and bidding farewell, with promises
  to return again, betook ourselves to our horses, and mounting them, were soon
  at the gates of the palace.</p>

  <p>I confess myself interested in the question of Christianity. The old
  religions are time-worn, and in effect dead. To the common people, when
  believed, they are as often injurious as useful&mdash;to others, they are the
  objects of open, undisguised contempt. Yet religion, in some form, the human
  mind must have. We feel the want of it as we do of food and drink. But, as in
  the case of food and drink, it must be something that we shall perceive to
  nourish and strengthen, not to debilitate and poison. In my searches through
  antiquity, I have found no system which I could rest in as complete and
  satisfying. They all fail in many vital points. They are frequently childish
  in their requisitions and their principles; their morality is faulty; their
  spirit narrow and exclusive; and more than all, they are without authority.
  The principles which are to guide, control, and exalt our nature, it seems to
  me, must proceed from the author of that nature. The claim of Christianity to
  be a religion provided for man by the Creator of man, is the feature in it
  which draws me toward it. This claim I shall investigate and scan, with all
  the ability and learning I can bring to the work. But whatever I or you may
  think of it, or ultimately determine, every eye must see with what giant
  steps it is striding onward&mdash;temples, religions, superstitions, and
  powers crumbling and dissolving at its approach. Farewell.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="letter08"
     id="letter08">LETTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE words of that Christian recluse, my Curtins, still ring
in my ear. I
  know not how it is, but there is a strange power in all that I have heard
  from any of that sect. You remember how I was struck by the manner, the
  countenance, and above all by the sentiments of Probus, the Christian whom I
  encountered on his way to Carthage. A still stronger feeling possesses me,
  when I hear the same things from the lips of Julia. It seems as if she
  herself, and the religion she discourses of, must proceed from the same
  author. She is certainly a divine work. And there is such an alliance between
  her and those truths, that I am ready almost to believe that for this reason
  alone they must have that very divine origin which is claimed for them. Is
  there any thing in our Roman superstitions, or philosophy even, that is at
  all kindred to the spirit of a perfect woman?&mdash;any thing suited to her
  nature? Has it ever seemed as if woman were in any respect the care of the
  gods? In this, Christianity differs from all former religions and
  philosophies. It is feminine. I do not mean by that, weak or effeminate. But
  in its gentleness, in the suavity of its tone, in the humanity of its
  doctrines, in the deep love it breathes toward all of human kind, in the high
  rank it assigns to the virtues which are peculiarly those of woman, in these
  things and many others, it is throughout for them as well as for
  us&mdash;almost more for them than for us. In this feature of it, so strange
  and new, I see marks of a wisdom beyond that of any human fabricator. A human
  inventor would scarcely have conceived such a system; and could he have
  conceived it, would not have dared to publish it. It would have been in his
  judgment to have wantonly forfeited the favor of the world. The author of
  Christianity, with a divine boldness, makes his perfect man, in the purity
  and beauty of his character, the counterpart of a perfect woman. The virtues
  upon which former teachers have chiefly dwelt, are by him almost unnoticed,
  and those soft and feminine ones, which others seem to have utterly
  forgotten, he has exalted to the highest place. So that, as I before said,
  Julia discoursing to me of Christianity is in herself, in the exact
  accordance between her mind and heart and that faith, the strongest argument
  I have yet found of its truth. I do not say that I am a believer. I am not.
  But I cannot say what the effect may be of a few more interviews with the
  hermit of the mountain, in company with the princess. His arguments,
  illustrated by her presence, will carry with them not a little force.</p>

  <p>When, after our interview with the Christian, we had returned to the
  Queen's villa, we easily persuaded ourselves that the heat of the day was too
  great for us to set out, till toward the close of it, for the city. So we
  agreed, in the absence of the Queen and other guests, to pass the day after
  our own manner, and by ourselves. The princess proposed that we should
  confine ourselves to the cool retreats near the fountain of the Elephant,
  made also more agreeable to us than any other place by the delightful hours
  we had sat there listening to the melodious accents of the great Longinus. To
  this proposal we quickly and gladly assented. Our garments being then made to
  correspond to the excessive heats of the season, soothed by the noise of the
  falling waters, and fanned by slaves who waved to and fro huge leaves of the
  palm tree, cut into graceful forms, and set in gold or ivory, we resigned
  ourselves to that sleepy but yet delicious state which we reach only a few
  times in all our lives, when the senses are perfectly satisfied and filled,
  and merely to live is bliss enough. But our luxurious ease was slightly
  diversified with additions and changes no ways unwelcome. Ever and anon
  slaves entered, bearing trays laden with every rare and curious confection
  which the art of the East supplies, but especially with drinks cooled by snow
  brought from the mountains of India. These, in the most agreeable manner,
  recruited our strength when exhausted by fits of merriment, or when one had
  become weary of reading or reciting a story for the amusement of the others,
  and the others as weary, or more weary, by listening. It were in vain to
  attempt to recall for your and Lucilia's entertainment the many pleasant
  things which were both said and done on this day never to be forgotten. And
  besides, perhaps, were they set down in order and sent to Rome, the spicy
  flavor which gave life to them here might all exhale, and leave them flat and
  dull. Suffice it therefore to say, that in our judgment many witty and
  learned sayings were uttered&mdash;for the learning, that must rest upon our
  declaration&mdash;for the wit, the slaves will bear witness to it, as they
  did then, by their unrestrained bursts of laughter.</p>

  <p>It was with no little reluctance that, as the last rays of the sun fell
  upon the highest jet of the fountain, we heard the princess declare that the
  latest hour had come, and we must fain prepare for the city. A little time
  sufficed for this, and we were soon upon our horses threading the defiles
  among the hills, or flying over the plains. A few hours brought us within the
  gates of the city. Leaving Julia at the palace of the Queen, we turned toward
  the house of Gracchus. Its lofty front soon rose before us. As we passed into
  the court-yard, the first sound that greeted me was Milo's blundering voice:
  'Welcome, most noble Gallienus, welcome again to Palmyra!'</p>

  <p>'I am not,' said I, 'quite an emperor yet, but notwithstanding, I am glad
  to be in Palmyra&mdash;more glad to be at the house of Gracchus&mdash;and
  glad most of all to see Gracchus himself at home, and well'&mdash;the noble
  Roman&mdash;as I shall call him&mdash;at that moment issuing from a door of
  the palace, and descending at a quick pace the steps, to assist Fausta from
  her horse.</p>

  <p>'We are not,' said he, 'long separated; but to those who really love, the
  shortest separation is a long one, and the quickest return an occasion of
  joy.' Saying so, he embraced and kissed his beautiful daughter, and grasped
  cordially my hand.</p>

  <p>'Come,' added he, 'enter and repose. Your ride has been a sharp one, as
  your horses declare, and the heat is great. Let us to the banqueting-hall, as
  the coolest, and there sit and rest.' So we were again soon within that
  graceful apartment, where I had first sat and tasted the hospitalities of
  Palmyra. The gods above were still at their feast, drinking or drunken.
  Below, we sat at the open windows, and with more temperance regaled ourselves
  with the cool air that came to us, richly laden with the fragrance of
  surrounding flowers, and with that social converse that is more inspiring
  than Falernian, or the soft Palmyrene. After talking of other things,
  Gracchus addressed me saying:</p>

  <p>'But is it not now time, Lucius, that a letter at least came from Isaac? I
  have forborne to inquire, from time to time, as I would do nothing to add to
  your necessary anxiety. It surely now however is right to consider the steps
  next to be taken, if he shall have failed in his enterprise.'</p>

  <p>'Isaac and Calpurnius,'I replied, 'are never absent from my thoughts, and
  I have already resolved&mdash;the gods willing and favoring&mdash;that when a
  period of sufficient length shall have elapsed, and the Jew does not appear,
  having either perished on the way or else in the capital of the Great
  King&mdash;myself to start, as I at first designed to do, upon this
  expedition, and either return with my brother, or else die also in the
  endeavor. Seek not, Fausta, as I perceive you are about to do, to turn me
  from my purpose. It will be&mdash;it ought to be&mdash;in vain. I can consent
  no longer to live thus in the very heart of life, while this cloud of
  uncertainty hangs over the fate of one so near to me. Though I should depute
  the service of his rescue to a thousand others, my own inactivity is
  insupportable, and reproaches me like a crime.'</p>

  <p>'I was not, as you supposed, Lucius,' replied Fausta, 'about to draw you
  away from your purpose, but, on the contrary, to declare my approbation of
  it. Were I Lucius, my thoughts would be, I am sure, what yours now are; and
  to- morrow's sun would light me on the way to Ecbatana. Nay, father, I would
  not wait a day longer. Woman though I am, I am almost ready to offer myself a
  companion of our friend on this pious service.'</p>

  <p>'I shall not,' said Gracchus, 'undertake to dissuade our friend from what
  seems now to be his settled purpose. Yet still, for our sakes, for the sake
  of the aged Portia, and all in Rome, I could wish&mdash;supposing Isaac
  should fail&mdash;that one more attempt might be made in the same way, ere so
  much is put at hazard. It needs no great penetration to see how highly prized
  by Persia must be the possession of such a trophy of her prowess as the head
  of the ancient house of Piso&mdash;with what jealousy his every movement
  would be watched, and what danger must wait upon any attempt at his
  deliverance. Moreover, while a mere hireling might, if detected, have one
  chance among a thousand of pardon and escape, even that were wanting to you.
  Another Piso would be either another footstool of the Persian despot, while
  life should last, or else he would swing upon a Persian gibbet, and so would
  perish the last of a noble name.'</p>

  <p>'I cannot deny that reason is on your side,'I said, in reply to this
  strong case of Gracchus, 'but feeling is on mine, and the contest is never an
  equal one. Feeling is, perhaps, the essence of reason, of which no account
  need or can be given, and ought to prevail. But however this may be, I feel
  that I am right, and so I must act.'</p>

  <p>'But let us now think of nothing else,' said Fausta, 'than that before
  another day is ended, we shall get intelligence of Isaac. Have you, Lucius,
  inquired, since your return, of Demetrius?'</p>

  <p>'Milo is now absent on that very errand,'I replied, 'and here he is,
  giving no signs of success.'</p>

  <p>Milo at the same moment entered the hall, and stated that Demetrius was
  himself absent from the city, but was every moment expected, and it was known
  that he had been seeking anxiously&mdash;the preceding day&mdash;for me.
  While Milo was yet speaking, a messenger was announced, inquiring for me, and
  before I could reach the extremity of the apartment, Demetrius himself
  entered the room in haste, brandishing in his hand a letter, which he knew
  well to be from Isaac.</p>

  <p>''Tis his own hand,' said he, 'The form of his letters is not to be
  mistaken. Not even the hand of Demetrius can cut with more grace the Greek
  character. Observe, Roman, the fashion of his touch. Isaac would have guided
  a rare hand at the graving tool. But these Jews shun the nicer arts. They are
  a strange people.'</p>

  <p>'Quickly,' said I, interrupting the voluble Greek, 'as you love the gods,
  deliver to me the letter! By and by we will discourse of these
  things'&mdash;and seizing the epistle, I ran with it to another apartment,
  first to devour it myself.</p>

  <p>I cannot tell you, dear friends, with what eagerness I drank in the
  contents of the letter, and with what ecstasy of joy I leaped and shouted at
  the news it brought. In one word, my brother lives, and it is possible that
  before this epistle to you shall be finished, he himself will sit at my side.
  But to put you in possession of the whole case, I shall transcribe for you
  the chief parts of Isaac's careful and minute account, preserving for your
  amusement much of what in no way whatever relates to the affair in hand, and
  is useful only as it will present a sort of picture of one of this strange
  tribe. As soon as I had filled myself with its transporting contents, I
  hastened to the hall where I had left Fausta and Gracchus, to
  whom&mdash;Demetrius having in the mean time taken his departure&mdash;I
  quickly communicated its intelligence, and received their hearty
  congratulations, and then read it to them very much as I now transcribe it
  for you. You will now acknowledge my obligations to this kind-hearted Jew,
  and will devoutly bless the gods for my accidental encounter with him on
  board the Mediterranean trader. Here now is the letter itself.</p>

  <p>ISAAC, <i>the Son of Isaac of Rome, to the most noble</i> L. MANLIUS Piso,
  <i>at Palmyra</i>:</p>

  <p>That I am alive, Roman, after the perils of my journey, and the worse
  perils of this Pagan city, can be ascribed to nothing else than the
  protecting arm of the God of our nation. It is new evidence to me, that
  somewhat is yet to be achieved by my ministry, for the good of my country.
  That I am here in this remote and benighted region, that I should have
  adventured hither in the service of a Roman to save one Roman life, when,
  were the power mine, I would cut off every Roman life, from the babe at the
  breast to the silver head, and lay waste the kingdom of the great Mother of
  Iniquity with fire and sword, is to me a thing so wonderful, that I refer it
  all to the pleasure of that Power, who orders events according to a plan and
  wisdom impenetrable by us. Think not, Roman, that I have journeyed so far for
  the sake of thy two talents of gold&mdash;though that is considerable. And
  the mention of this draws my mind to a matter, overlooked in the stipulations
  entered into between thee and me, at my dwelling in Palmyra. Singular, that
  so weighty a part of that transaction should have been taken no note of! Now
  I must trust it wholly to thee, Piso, and feel that I may safely do so. In
  case of my death, the double of the recompense agreed upon was to be paid, in
  accordance with directions left. But what was to be done in case of thy
  death? Why, most thoughtful Isaac&mdash;most prudent of men&mdash;for this
  thou didst make no provision! And yet may not Piso die; as well as Isaac? Has
  a Roman more lives than a Jew? Nay, how know I but thou art now dead, and no
  one living to do me justice? See to this, excellent Roman. Thou wouldst not
  have me go unrequited for all this hazard and toil. Let thy heirs be bound,
  by sure and legal instruments, to make good to me all thou hast bound thyself
  to pay. Do this, and thy gods and my God prosper thee! Forget it not. Let it
  be done as soon as these words are read. Demetrius will show thee one who
  will draw up a writing in agreement with both the Palmyrene and Roman Law.
  Unheard of heedlessness! But this I thought not about till I took my pen to
  write.</p>

  <p>What was I saying?&mdash;that I came not for thy gold&mdash;that is, not
  for that solely or chiefly. For what, and why, then? Because, as I have
  hinted, I felt myself driven by an invisible power to this enterprise. I wait
  with, patience to know what its issue is to be.</p>

  <p>Now let me inform thee of my journey and my doings. But first, in one
  brief word, let me relieve thy impatience by saying, I think thy brother is
  to be rescued! No more of this at present, but all in order. When I parted
  from thee that night, I had hardly formed my plan, though my mind, quick in
  all its workings, did suddenly conceive one way in which it appeared possible
  to me to compass the desired object. Perhaps you will deem it a piece of
  rashness rather than of courage so quickly to undertake your affair, I should
  call it so too, did I not also catch dimly in the depth of the Heavens the
  form of the finger of God. This thou wilt not and canst not understand. It is
  beyond thee. Is it not so? But, Roman, I trust the day is to come when by my
  mouth, if not by another's, thou shalt hear enough to understand that truth
  is to be found no where but in Moses. Avoid Probus. I fear me he is already
  in Palmyra. There is more cunning in him than is good. With that deep face
  and serene air he deceives many. All I say is, shun him. To be a Roman
  unbeliever is better than to be a Christian heretic. But to my journey.</p>

  <p>The morning after I parted from thee saw me issuing at an early hour from
  the Persian Gate, and with my single Ethiopian slave bearing toward the
  desert, I took with me but a light bale of merchandise, that I might not
  burden my good dromedary. Than mine, there is not a fleeter in the whole
  East. One nearly as good, and at a huge price, did I purchase for my slave.
  'T was too suddenly bought to be cheaply bought. But I was not cozened. It
  proved a rare animal. I think there lives not the man in Palmyra or Damascus
  who could blind Isaac. I determined to travel at the greatest speed we and
  our beasts could bear, so we avoided as far as we could the heats of day, and
  rode by night. The first day being through the peopled regions of the Queen's
  dominions, and through a cultivated country, we travelled at our ease; and
  not unfrequently at such places as I saw promised well, did we stop, and
  while our good beasts regaled themselves upon the rich herbage or richer
  grain, trafficked. In this surely I erred not. For losing, as I have done by
  this distant and unwonted route, the trade of Ctesiphon, 't was just, was it
  not, that to the extent possible, without great obstruction thrown in the way
  of your affairs, I should repair the evil of that loss? Truth to speak, it
  was only because my eye foresaw some such profitings on the way, that I made
  myself contented with but two gold talents of Jerusalem. Two days were passed
  thus, and on the third we entered upon a barren region&mdash;barren as where
  the prophet found no food but such as birds from Heaven brought him. But why
  speak of this to thee? O, that thou wouldst but once only once, sit at the
  feet of that man of God, Simon Ben Gorah! Solomon was not more wise. His
  words are arrows with two heads from a golden bow. His reasons weigh as the
  mountains of Lebanon. They break and crush all on whom they fall. Would,
  Roman, they might sometime fall on thee! The third day we were on this barren
  region, and the next fairly upon the desert. Now did we reap the benefit of
  our good beasts. The heat was like that of the furnace of Nebuchadnezzar, out
  of which the three children, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came, through
  the power of God, unscorched. And moreover, they were soon put to an unwonted
  and unlooked for burden, and in such a manner as, to thy wonder, I shall
  relate.</p>

  <p>It was a day the air of which was like the air of that
  furnace&mdash;burning&mdash;burning hot. Death was written upon the whole
  face of the visible earth. Where leaves had been, there were none now, or
  they crumbled into ashes as the hand touched them. The atmosphere, when moved
  by the wind, brought not, as it is used to do, a greater coolness, but a
  fiercer heat. It was full of flickering waves that danced up and down with a
  quivering motion, and dazzled and blinded the eye that looked upon them. And
  the sand was not like that which for the most part is met with on that desert
  stretching from the Mediterranean to Palmyra, and of which thou hast had some
  experience&mdash;heavy, and hard, and seamed with cracks&mdash;but fine, and
  light, and raised into clouds by every breath of wind, and driven into the
  skin like points of needles. When the wind, as frequently it did, blew with
  violence, we could only stop and bury our faces in our garments, our poor
  beasts crying out with pain. It was on such a day, having, because there was
  no place of rest, been obliged to endure all the noonday heat, that, when the
  sun was at the highest and we looked eagerly every way for even a dry and
  leafless bush that we might crouch down beneath its shade, we saw at a
  distance before us the tall trunk of a cedar, bleached to ivory, and
  twinkling like a pharos under the hot rays. We slowly approached it, Hadad,
  my Ethiopian, knowing it as one of the pillars of the desert.</p>

  <p>'There it has stood and shone a thousand years,' said he; 'and but for
  such marks, who could cross these seas of sand, where your foot-mark is lost,
  as soon as made?' After a few moments' pause, he again exclaimed: 'And by the
  beard of holy Abraham! a living human being sits at the root&mdash;or else
  mayhap my eyes deceive me, and I see only the twisted roots of the tree.'</p>

  <p>''T is too far for my eyes to discern aught but the blasted trunk. No
  living creature can dwell here. 'T is the region of death only.'</p>

  <p>A blast of the desert struck us at the moment, and well nigh buried us in
  its rushing whirlwind of sand. We stood still, closed our eyes, and buried
  our faces in the folds of our garments.</p>

  <p>'Horrible and out of nature!'I cried&mdash;'the sun blazing without a
  cloud as big as a locust to dim his ray, and yet these gusts, like the raging
  of a tempest. The winds surely rise. Providence be our guide out of this
  valley of fire and death!'</p>

  <p>'There is no providence here,' said the slave, 'nor any where; else why
  these savage and dreary deserts, which must be crossed, and yet we die in
  doing it.'</p>

  <p>'Hold thy peace, blasphemer!'I could not but rejoin, 'and take heed lest
  thy impious tongue draw down a whirlwind of God to the destruction of us
  both.'</p>

  <p>'The curse of Arimanes'&mdash;began the irritated slave&mdash;when
  suddenly he paused, and cried out in another tone: 'Look! look! Isaac, and
  see now for thyself: I am no Jew, if there sit not a woman at the root of
  yonder tree,'</p>

  <p>I looked, and now that we had drawn nearer, and the wind had subsided for
  an instant, I plainly beheld the form of a woman, bent over as if in the act
  of holding and defending an infant. I believed it a delusion of Satan.</p>

  <p>'It is awful,' said I; 'but let us hasten; if it be a reality, our coming
  must be as the descent of angels.'</p>

  <p>I pressed on my weary animal, and in a few moments we stood before what
  seemed indeed a human being, of flesh and bone&mdash;and what was more
  wonderful still, a woman. Yet she stirred not, nor gave other sign of
  life.</p>

  <p>'Is the breath of life yet in you?'I cried out&mdash;not doubting,
  however, that whoever it was, death had already released her from her
  misery&mdash;and at the same time laid my hand upon her shoulder. At which
  she started, and lifting up her head, the very ghastliness of death stamped
  upon every feature, she shrieked: 'I drown! I drown! Hassan, save me!' and
  her head fell again upon her knees.</p>

  <p>'Poor fool,' said I, 'thou art upon the sands of the desert, and thou
  dreamest: awake!&mdash;awake!&mdash;and here is water for thee&mdash;real
  water.'</p>

  <p>At which she waked indeed, with a convulsive start, and while with one
  hand she held fast her child&mdash;for a child was indeed laid away among the
  folds of her garments&mdash;with the other she madly grasped the small cup I
  held out to her, and tearing aside the covering from the face of the infant,
  she forced open its mouth, and poured in some of the water we gave her,
  watching its effect. Soon as the little one gave signs of life, she drank the
  remainder at a draught, crying out, 'More! more!' Our water, of which we had
  as yet good store, though hot as the wind itself, quickly restored both
  mother and child.</p>

  <p>'And now tell me, miserable woman, what direful chance has brought and
  left thee here?&mdash;but hasten&mdash;speak quickly as thou canst&mdash;and
  dost thou look for any one to come to thy relief?'</p>

  <p>'Robbers of the desert,' said she, 'have either murdered or carried into
  slavery my husband, and destroyed and scattered the caravan of which we made
  a part. I am alone in the desert; and I know of no relief but such as you can
  give. Leave us not, if you are men, to perish in these burning sands!'</p>

  <p>'Fear not that I will leave you,' said I: 'what I can spare, shall freely
  be thine. But time is precious, for we are yet but midway the desert, and the
  signs of the heavens portend wind and whirlwind: hasten then and mount the
  dromedary of my slave, while I upon mine-bear as stronger than thou&mdash;the
  child.'</p>

  <p>'Isaac,' here muttered Hadad, in an undertone, 'art thou mad? Is thy
  reason wholly gone? It is scarcely to be hoped that we alone may cross in
  safety what remains of the desert, beset as we are by these sweeping gusts,
  and wilt thou oppress our fainting beasts with this new burden?'</p>

  <p>'Thou accursed of God! wouldst thou leave these here to perish? I believed
  not before that out of hell there could be so black a soul. Bring down thy
  dromedary. One word of hesitancy, and thy own carcass shall bleach upon the
  sands.'</p>

  <p>I knew well who I was dealing with&mdash;that I was safe from immediate
  violence, though not from ultimate revenge.</p>

  <p>Hadad then drew up his beast, which kneeling received the woman, while I
  took in my arms the child. We then set forward at an increased pace, to reach
  before light, if possible, the 'place of springs,' where a small green spot,
  watered by fountains which never fail, blesses these inhospitable plains.</p>

  <p>Not a cloud was to be seen in all the compass of the heavens, yet the
  winds raged. The blueness of the sky was gone, and the whole inflamed dome
  above us was rather of the color of molten brass, the sun being but its
  brightest and hottest spot. At a distance we saw clouds of sand whirled
  aloft, and driven fiercely over the boundless plain, any one of which, it
  seemed to us, if it should cross our path, would bury us under its moving
  mass. We pressed on, trembling and silent through apprehension. The blood in
  my veins seemed hotter than the sand, or the sun that beat upon my face.
  Roman, thou canst form no conception of the horrors of this day. But for my
  faith, I should have utterly failed. What couldst thou have done?&mdash;nay,
  or the Christian Probus? But I will not taunt thee. I will rather hope. The
  wind became more and more violent. The sand was driven before it like chaff.
  Sometimes the tempest immediately around us would abate, but it only served
  to fill us with new apprehensions, by revealing to us the tossings of this
  great deep, in the distance. At one of these moments, as I was taking
  occasion to speak a word of comfort to the half dead mother, and cherish the
  little one whom I bore, a sound as of the roar of ocean caught my
  ear&mdash;more awful than aught I had yet heard&mdash;and at the same time a
  shriek and a shout from Hadad, 'God of Israel, save us! The sand! the
  sand!'</p>

  <p>I looked in the direction of the sound, and there in the south it
  looked&mdash;God, how terrible to behold!&mdash;as if the whole plain were
  risen up, and were about to fall upon us.</p>

  <p>''T is vain to fly!'I cried aloud to Hadad, who was urging his animal to
  its utmost speed. 'Let us perish together. Besides, observe the heaviest and
  thickest of the cloud is in advance of us.'</p>

  <p>The mother of the child cried out, as Hadad insanely hastened on, for her
  offspring, to whom I answered: 'Trust the young Ishmael to me&mdash;fear me
  not&mdash;cleave to the dromedary.'</p>

  <p>Hardly were the words spoken, when the whirlwind struck us. We were dashed
  to the earth as we had been weeds. My senses were for a time lost in the
  confusion and horror of the scene. I only knew that I had been torn from my
  dromedary&mdash;borne along and buried by the sand&mdash;and that the young
  child was still in my arms. In the first moment of consciousness, I found
  myself struggling to free myself from the sand which was heaped around and
  over me. In this, after a time, I succeeded, and in restoring to animation
  the poor child, choked and blinded, yet&mdash;wonderful indeed!&mdash;not
  dead. I then looked around for Hadad and the woman, but they were no where to
  be seen. I shouted aloud, but there was no answer. The sand had now
  fallen&mdash;the wind had died away&mdash;and no sound met my ear, but the
  distant rumbling of the retreating storm. Not far from me, my own dromedary
  stood, partly buried in sand, and vainly endeavoring to extricate himself.
  With my aid, this was quickly effected. I was soon upon his back. But I knew
  not which way to turn. My dependence was upon Hadad, familiar with the route.
  The sun however had declined sensibly toward the west&mdash;I knew that my
  general direction was toward the east and north, so that with some certainty
  as to the true path, I sorrowfully recommenced my journey. Have I not thy
  pity, Roman? Has a worse case ever come to thy ear? I will not distress thee
  by reciting my sufferings all the way to the 'place of springs,' which by the
  next morning, plodding on wearily through the night, I safely reached.</p>

  <p>There one of the first objects that greeted me, was Hadad and the mother
  of my Ishmael. I approached them unobserved, as they sat on the border of a
  spring. In the midst of other travellers, some of whom I saw were comforting
  the wailing Hagar&mdash;and, without a word, dropped the young child into the
  lap of its mother. Who shall describe the transports of her joy? 'T was
  worth, Piso, the journey and all its hazards.</p>

  <p>How refreshing it was to lie here on the cool soil, beneath the shade of
  the grateful palm, enjoying every moment of existence, and repairing the
  injuries the journey had inflicted upon ourselves and our beasts! Two days we
  passed in this manner. While here, Hadad related what befel him after our
  separation. Owing to his urging on his animal in that mad way, at the time I
  called out to him, instead of stopping or retreating, he was farther within
  the heart of the cloud than I, and was more rudely handled.</p>

  <p>'Soon as the blast fell upon us,' said he, 'that instant was my reason
  gone. I knew nothing for I cannot tell how long. But when I came to myself,
  and found that I was not in the place of the wicked&mdash;whereat I rejoiced
  and was amazed&mdash;I discovered, on looking round, that my good dromedary,
  whom I could ill spare, was dead and buried, and your Hagar, whom I could
  have so well spared, alive and weeping for her lost boy. I made her, with
  difficulty, comprehend that time was precious, and that strength would be
  impaired by weeping and wailing. Knowing at once in what direction to
  travel&mdash;after searching in vain for thee&mdash;we set out upon a
  journey, which, on foot, beneath a burning sun, and without water, there was
  small hope of accomplishing. I looked with certainty to die in the desert.
  But Oromasdes was my protector. See, Isaac, the advantage of a little of many
  faiths. We had not travelled far among the hillocks, or hills rather, of sand
  which we found piled up in our way, and completely altering the face of the
  plain, before, to our amazement and our joy, we discovered a camel, without
  rider or burden, coming toward us. I secured him without difficulty. At a
  little distance, we soon saw another; and by and by we found that we were
  passing over the graves of a caravan, the whole or chief part of which had
  been overwhelmed by the storm. Here was a body partly out of the sand, there
  the head or leg of a dromedary or camel. Ruin and death seemed to have
  finished their work. But it was not quite so. For presently on reaching the
  summit of a wave of sand, we discerned a remnant mounted upon the beasts that
  had been saved, making in the same direction, and probably to the same point,
  as ourselves. We joined them, and partaking of their water, were recruited,
  and so reached this place alive. It is now from here,' he added, 'a safe and
  easy road to Ecbatana.'</p>

  <p>So we found it. But confess now, noble Piso, if in thy judgment it would
  have been exorbitant if I had required of thee three talents of Jerusalem
  instead of two? For what wouldst thou cross that molten sea, and be buried
  under its fiery waves! It is none other than a miracle that I am here alive
  in Ecbatana. And for thee I fear that miracle would not have been wrought.
  Hadst thou been in my place, the sands of the desert were now thy
  dwelling-place. Yet have I again to tempt those horrors. Being here, I must
  return. The dromedary of my slave Hadad was worth a hundred aurelians. A
  better or a fleeter never yet was in the stables of Zenobia. And dost thou
  know, Roman, how curious the Queen is in horses and dromedaries? There cannot
  a rare one of either kind enter the walls of Palmyra, but he is straightway
  bought up for the service of Zenobia. The swiftest in the East are hers. 'T
  was my purpose, returning, to have drawn upon Hadad's beast the notice of the
  Queen. Doubtless I should have sold it to her, and two hundred aurelians is
  the very least I should have asked or taken for her. To no other than Zenobia
  would I have parted with her for less than three hundred. But alas! her bones
  are on the desert. But why, you ask, should I have so favored Zenobia? It is
  no wonder you ask. And in answer, I tell thee perhaps a secret. Zenobia is a
  Jewess! Receive it or not, as thou wilt&mdash;she is a Jewess&mdash;and her
  heart is tender toward our tribe. I do not say, mark me, that she is one by
  descent, nor that she is so much as even a proselyte of the Gate, but that
  she believes in some sort Moses and the prophets and reads our sacred books.
  These things I know well from those who have been near her. But who ever
  heard that she has been seen to read the books of the Christians! Probus will
  not dare to assert it. 'T is not more public that Longinus himself is
  inclined to our faith&mdash;by my head, I doubt not that he is more than
  inclined&mdash;than 'tis that Zenobia is. If our Messiah should first of all
  gird on the sword of Palmyra, what Jew, whose sight is better than a mole's,
  would be surprised? My father&mdash;may his sleep be sweet!&mdash;whose beard
  came lower than his girdle, and whose wisdom was famous throughout the East,
  built much upon what he knew of the Queen, and her great minister, and used
  to say, 'That another Barchochab would arise in Palmyra, whom it would
  require more than, another Hadrian to hinder in his way to empire; and that
  if horses again swam in blood, as once at Bither, 'twould be in Roman blood.'
  Who am I, to deny truth and likelihood to the words of one in whom dwelt the
  wisdom of Solomon and the meekness of Moses, the faith of Abraham, the valor
  of Gideon, and the patience of Job? I rather maintain their truth. And in the
  features of the present time, I read change and revolution&mdash;war, and
  uproar, and ruin&mdash;the falling of kingdoms that have outlasted centuries,
  and the uprising of others that shall last for other centuries. I see the
  Queen of the East at battle with the Emperor of Rome, and through her
  victories deliverance wrought out for Israel, and the throne of Judah once
  more erected within the walls of Jerusalem! Now dost thou, Piso, understand,
  I suppose, not one word of all this. How shouldst thou? But I trust thou
  wilt. Surely now you will say, 'What is all this to the purpose?' Not much to
  any present purpose, I confess freely; and I should not marvel greatly if
  thou wert to throw this letter down and trample it in the dust&mdash;as Rome
  has done by Judea&mdash;but that thou lookest to hear of thy brother. Well,
  now I will tell thee of him.</p>

  <p>When we drew near to the capital of the Great King, wishing to enrage
  Hadad, I asked, 'What mud-walled village is it that we see yonder over the
  plain?' Thou shouldst have seen the scowl of his eye&mdash;answer he gave
  none. I spit upon such a city&mdash;I cast out my shoe upon it! I who have
  dwelt at Rome, Carthage, Antioch, and Palmyra, may be allowed to despise a
  place like this. There are but two things that impress the beholder&mdash;the
  Palace of Sapor, and the Temple of Mithras, near it. These truly would be
  noted even in Palmyra. Not that in the building any rule or order of art is
  observed, but that the congregation of strange and fantastic
  trickery&mdash;some whereof, it cannot be gainsaid, is of rare
  beauty&mdash;is so vast that one is pleased with it as he is with the
  remembrance of the wonderful combinations of a dream.</p>

  <p>Soon as we entered the gates of the city, I turned to the woman whom we
  brought from the desert, and who rode the camel with Hadad, and said to her:
  'First of all, Hagar, we take thee to those who are of thy kindred, or to thy
  friends, and well may they bless the good Providence of God that they see
  thee. 'T was a foul deed of thy husband, after the manner of the patriarch to
  leave thee and thy little one to perish on the burning sands of the
  desert.'</p>

  <p>'Good Jew,' she replied, 'my name is not Hagar, nor did my husband leave
  me willingly. I tell thee we were set upon by robbers, and Hassan, my poor
  husband, was either killed, or carried away no one can tell whither.'</p>

  <p>'No matter&mdash;names are of little moment. To me, thou art Hagar, and
  thy little one here is Ishmael&mdash;and if thou wilt, Ishmael shall be mine.
  I will take him and rear him as mine&mdash;he shall be rich&mdash;and thou
  shalt be rich, and dwell where thou wilt.' The child, Roman, had wound itself
  all around my heart. He was of three years or more, and, feature for feature,
  answered to the youngest of my own, long since lost, and now in Abraham's
  bosom. But it was not to be as I wished. All the mother rushed into the face
  of the woman.</p>

  <p>'Good Jew,' she cried, 'the God of Heaven will reward thee for thy mercy
  shown to us; but hadst thou saved my life a thousand times, I could not pay
  thee with my child. I am poor, and have nought to give thee but my
  thanks.'</p>

  <p>'I will see thee again,' said I to the widow of Hassan, as we set her down
  in the street where her kinsfolk dwelt, 'if thou wilt allow me. Receive thy
  child.'</p>

  <p>The child smiled as I kissed him and gave him again to his mother. It was
  the smile of Joseph. I could at that moment almost myself have become a
  robber of the desert, and taken what the others had left.</p>

  <p>We here parted, and Hadad and myself bent our way to the house of Levi, a
  merchant well known to Hadad, and who, he assured me, would gladly receive
  us. His shop, as we entered it, seemed well stored with the richest goods,
  but the building of which it made a part promised not very ample lodgings.
  But the hospitable welcome of the aged Levi promised better.</p>

  <p>'Welcome every true son of Israel,' said he, as we drew near where in a
  remoter part of the large apartment he sat busy at his books of account.
  'Make yourselves at home beneath the roof of Levi. Follow me and find more
  private quarters.'</p>

  <p>So, leaving Hadad and the camels to the care of those whom our host
  summoned, I followed him as desired to another part of the dwelling. It now
  seemed spacious enough. After winding about among narrow and dark passages,
  we at length came to large and well-furnished rooms, apparently quite remote
  from the shop, and far removed from the street. Here we seated ourselves, and
  I unfolded to Levi the nature of my business. He listened, wondered, smiled,
  shook his head, and made a thousand contrary movements and signs. When I had
  done, he comforted and instructed me after this manner.</p>

  <p>'Something like a fool's errand. Yet the pay is good&mdash;that cannot be
  doubted. It had been better, I think, for thee to have followed thy trade in
  Palmyra or Ctesiphon. Yet perhaps this may turn out well. The promised sum is
  large. Who can tell? 'Tis worth a risk. Yet if, in taking the risk, one loses
  his head, it were a mad enterprise. Verily, I can say nothing but that time
  will disclose it, and the event prove it. A thing is not seen all at once,
  and the eye cannot at once reach every part of a ball. Wait with patience,
  and God shall show it.'</p>

  <p>I saw that nothing was to be got from this prophet. Yet perhaps he knew
  facts. So I asked him of Hormisdas and Sapor, and if he knew aught of the
  Roman Piso, held a strict prisoner in Ecbatana.</p>

  <p>'A prisoner, say you?' he replied, beginning at the end of my question;
  'how can a Persian Satrap be called a prisoner? He dwells in the palace of
  Hormisdas, and when seen abroad, rides upon a horse whose harness is jewelled
  like the prince's, and his dress moreover is of the richest stuffs, and
  altogether Persian. 'Tis forgotten by most that he is any other than a native
  Persian.'</p>

  <p>'Is he ever seen to ride alone?'I asked.</p>

  <p>'Why the question? I know not. Who should know who rides alone and who in
  company? When I have seen him, it has always been in the train of
  others.'</p>

  <p>'I thought as much. Doubtless he goes abroad well guarded. His companions,
  Levi, I doubt are little better than jailers?'</p>

  <p>Levi opened his eyes, but it was to no purpose; they can see no other
  thing clearly, save a Persian coin.</p>

  <p>I found, upon further inquiry, that it was even as I had supposed and had
  heard. Calpurnius lives in the palace of Hormisdas, and is his chosen
  companion and friend, but is allowed by Sapor no liberty of movement, and
  wherever he goes is attended by persons appointed to guard him. Nor have the
  many years that he has been here caused this vigilance in any degree to
  relax. All outward honor is shown him, except by the king, who, had he not,
  in the time of Valerian, passed his word to the prince his son, and fully
  surrendered Piso into his hands, would, it is believed, even now use him as
  he did the unhappy emperor. But he is safe in the keeping of the prince. And
  the guard about him, it is my present suspicion, is as much to defend him
  against any sudden freak of the king or his satellites, as it is to prevent
  his escape. The least that could happen to any Roman falling into Sapor's
  power would be to be flayed alive. My safety will lie in my being known only
  as a Jew, not as a dweller in Rome.</p>

  <p>And now, Roman, thou desirest to know in what manner I mean to accomplish
  the deliverance of thy brother. It is thus. Commend the cunning of it. My
  Ethiopian slave is then&mdash;I must tell thee to thine amazement&mdash;no
  Ethiopian and no slave! He is one of my own tribe whom I have many times
  employed in difficult affairs, and having often conferred upon him the most
  essential favors, have bound him to my will. Him I am to leave here, being
  first cleansed of the deep dye with which by my art&mdash;and what art is it
  I am not familiar with?&mdash;I have stained his skin to the darkest hue of
  the African, and then in his place, and retained to the same hue, am I to
  take thy brother, and so with security and in broad day walk through the
  gates of Ecbatana. Is it to be thought of that I should fail? All will rest
  with Calpurnius. If, in the first place, he shall be willing to return, and
  then, in the next place, shall consent to submit to this momentary and only
  apparent degradation, the issue is as certain to be happy, as the means shall
  be tried. My head never set with a sense of more security upon my shoulders,
  than now, while planning and putting into execution this Carthaginian
  plot.</p>

  <p>It was first of all necessary that I should become acquainted with the
  city, with the situation and structure of the palace of Hormisdas, and make
  myself known in the streets as one of those way-side merchants whom all
  abuse, yet whom all are glad to trade with. So, with my slave bending under
  the burden of those articles of use or luxury which I thought would be most
  attractive, we set forth into the midst of the busy streets, seeking a market
  for our commodities. Several days were passed in this manner, returning each
  night to lodge in the house of the rich and foolish, but hospitable Levi.</p>

  <p>While thus employed, I frequently saw Calpurnius in company with the
  prince or other nobles, either riding in state through the streets of the
  city, or else setting out upon excursions of pleasure beyond the walls. But
  my chief object was to observe well the palace of the prince, and learn the
  particular part of it inhabited by the Roman, and how and where it was his
  custom to pass his time. This it was not difficult to do. The palace of the
  prince I found to occupy a square of the city not far from that of the king
  his father. It is of vast extent, but of a desolate aspect, from the fewness
  of its inhabitants and the jealousy with which the prince and all his
  movements are watched by the wicked and now superannuated Sapor. Every day I
  diligently paced the streets upon which it stands. I at first went without
  Hadad, that I might observe with the more leisure. I at length discovered the
  apartments used by Calpurnius, and learned that it was his custom, when not
  absent from the palace upon some enterprise of pleasure, to refresh himself
  by breathing the air, and pacing to and fro upon a gallery of light Persian
  architecture, which borders immediately upon one of the four streets that
  bounds the palace. This gallery was not so high above the street but what the
  voice could easily reach those who were walking there, and that without
  greatly increasing its natural tone. From pillar to pillar there ran along a
  low lattice-work of fanciful device, upon which it was the usage of
  Calpurnius, and those who were with him, often to lean and idly watch the
  movements of the passengers below. Here, I found, must be my place of
  audience. Here I must draw his attention, and make myself known to him. For
  an opportunity to do this, I saw at once I might be obliged to wait long, for
  scarce ever was Calpurnius there, but Hormisdas, or some one of the nobles,
  was with him; or if he was alone, yet the street was so thronged that it must
  be difficult to obtain a hearing.</p>

  <p>Having learned these things, I then came forth, with Hadad bearing my
  merchandise, I myself going before him as owner and crier. Many times did I
  pass and repass the gallery of Calpurnius to no purpose&mdash;he either not
  being there, or attended closely by others, or wrapped in thought so that my
  cries could not arouse him. It was clear to me that I must make some bold
  attempt. He was one day standing at the lattice-work already named, alone,
  and looking at the passers by. Seeing him there as I entered the street, I
  made directly toward the spot, crying in the loudest tone my goods; and
  notwithstanding the numbers who were on their way along the street, I
  addressed myself boldly to him, purposely mistaking him for Hormisdas.
  'Prince,' said I, 'buy a little, if it please you, of a poor Jew, who has
  lately traversed the desert to serve you. I have in these panniers wonders
  from all parts of the world. There is not a city famous for its art in any
  rare and curious work, that is not represented here. Kings, queens, and
  princes, have not disdained to purchase of me. The great Sapor at Ctesiphon
  has of me procured some of his largest diamonds. I have sold to Claudius, and
  Zenobia, and half the nobility of Palmyra. Dost thou see, prince, the glory
  of this assortment of diamonds? Look! How would they become thy finger, thy
  hunting cap, or thy sandals?'</p>

  <p>Thy brother listened to me with unmoved countenance and folded arms,
  receiving passively whatever I was pleased to say. When I paused, he said, in
  a tone of sadness, though of affected pleasantry:</p>

  <p>'Jew, I am the worst subject for thee in all Ecbatana. I am a man without
  wants. I do nothing but live, and I have nothing to do to live.'</p>

  <p>'Now,'I replied, 'is it time for me to die, having seen the chief wonder
  of the world&mdash;a man without wants.'</p>

  <p>'There is a greater yet,' said he smiling; 'thou must live on.'</p>

  <p>'And what is that?'</p>

  <p>'A woman.'</p>

  <p>'Thou hast me. But I can easily compound with life. I have many wants, yet
  I love it. I was but a day or two since buried alive under the burning sands
  of the desert, and lost there a dromedary worth&mdash;if a
  farthing&mdash;four hundred aurelians, for which thou mayest have him. Yet I
  love to live, and take the chances of the world as they turn up. Here now
  have I all the way consoled myself with the thought of what I might sell to
  the great Prince Hormisdas, and thou seest my reward. Still I cry my goods
  with the same zeal. But surely thou wantest something? I have jewels from
  Rome&mdash;of the latest fashion.'</p>

  <p>'I want nothing from Rome.'</p>

  <p>Seeing no one was near, and lowering my voice, I said, 'Thou wantest
  nothing from Rome? What wouldst thou give, Roman, for news from Rome?'</p>

  <p>'News from Rome? Not an obolus. How knowest thou me to be a Roman? But
  now, I was the prince Hormisdas.'</p>

  <p>'I have seen thee many times, and know thee well, as the Roman Piso. I
  have news for thee.'</p>

  <p>'The prince approaches!' said Piso, in a hurried manner. 'Begone, but come
  again at the hour of dusk, and I shall be alone, and will have thee admitted
  within the gates of the palace.'</p>

  <p>The fates ordering it so, I was obliged to depart, and trust again to the
  future for such chances of renewing my conversation with him as it might have
  to offer. Here let me tell thee, Lucius Piso, that not having seen thy
  brother, thou hast never seen a man. He is one with every mark of the noblest
  manhood. His air is that of a born prince of the highest bearing, yet free
  and unrestrained. The beauty of his countenance is beyond that of any other I
  have ever seen, yet is it a manly beauty. A line of dark short hair covers
  his upper lip. His eyes are large and dark, yet soft in their general
  expression. He seems of a melancholy and thoughtful temper, and sometimes in
  his words there is an inexpressible bitterness. Yet it has appeared to me,
  that his nature is gentle, and that the other character is one accidental or
  assumed. If I should compare him with any one for beauty, it would be, Roman,
  not with thee&mdash;though I see him and thee to be of the same
  stock&mdash;but with the princess Julia. Were her beauty only made masculine,
  she would then be Calpurnius; or were his made feminine, he would then be
  Julia. But this fancy might not strike others. His features and air are not
  so much Roman as oriental&mdash;thine are purely Roman. It may be that
  costume alone imparts this Eastern aspect to the countenance and the
  form&mdash;for his dress is wholly that of a Persian.</p>

  <p>As I passed into the dwelling of my host, entering it as at first by the
  way of the shop, its owner was holding a conversation of business with some
  of his customers. How does money seem native to the palm of some men! They
  have but to open it, and straight it is lined with gold. If they blunder, it
  is into more wealth. With wit scarce sufficient to make it clear to another
  that they are properly men, do they manage to make themselves the very chief
  of all, by reason of the riches they heap up&mdash;which ever have claimed
  and received, and ever will, the homage of the world. Levi is of this sort.
  The meanness of his understanding words cannot express&mdash;or no words but
  his own. He was talking after this manner, as I entered, to one who seemed to
  hold him in utmost reverence:</p>

  <p>'The thing is so&mdash;the thing is so. If 't were otherwise 'tis most
  clear it would not be the same. Ha! The price may change. Who can say? The
  world is full of change. But it cannot be less, and leave a gain to the
  seller&mdash;unless indeed, circumstances altering, the profit should still
  he the same. But who can understand the future? An hour is more than I can
  comprehend. He that deals well with the present, is it not he, Holy Abraham!
  who best secures the passing time? It cannot be denied!'</p>

  <p>As the oracle ended, the Persian bowed low, saying:</p>

  <p>'The wisdom of it is clearer than the light. I shall so report to the
  prince.' Seeing me, he, in his friendly way, inquired after my success,
  shaking his head at what he is pleased to regard my mad enterprise. 'Better
  not meddle nor make in such matters. With thy pack upon thy back, and
  exercising diligence, thou wouldst become rich here in the streets of
  Ecbatana. And for what else shouldst thou care? 'Tis only money that remains
  the same in the midst of change. All agree in the value they place upon this,
  while they agree in nothing else. Who can remember a difference here? Leave
  thy project, Isaac, which thou must have undertaken half for love, and I will
  make thee a great man in Ecbatana.' Little does he know of Isaac, and thou I
  believe as little.</p>

  <p>No sooner had the god of these idolaters gone down to his rest, and the
  friendly twilight come, than I set forth for the palace of Hormisdas. Upon
  coming beneath the gallery, I waited not long before thy brother appeared,
  and pointed out the way in which, through a low and private entrance at a
  remote spot, I might reach an apartment where I should find him. Following
  his directions, and accompanied by Hadad, I was received, at the specified
  place, by a slave of the palace, who conducted me to Piso's presence. It was
  in one of his more private apartments, but still sumptuously set out with
  every article of Persian luxury, in which I found myself once more in company
  with thy brother, and where I ordered Hadad to display for his entertainment
  the most curious and costly of the contents of his pack.</p>

  <p>'I marvel chiefly, Roman,'I began by saying, 'at the ease with which I
  obtain an entrance into the palace, and into thine own apartment. I had
  thought this to have been attended with both difficulty and danger.'</p>

  <p>'It is not without danger,' he replied; 'thou mayst lose thy head for this
  adventure. But this risk I suppose thee to have weighed. Every one in
  Ecbatana knows Sapor and me&mdash;with what jealousy I am guarded&mdash;and
  that the king will not flinch to keep his word, and take off any head that
  meddles. But fear not. The king is old and weak, and though cruel as ever,
  forgets me as every thing else. Besides, it is found that I am so good a
  Persian, that all strictness in the watch has long since ceased. Half
  Ecbatana believe me more a Persian than a Roman&mdash;and in truth they are
  right.'</p>

  <p>'Thou hast not, Roman, forgotten thy country! Surely thou hast not, though
  suffering captivity, ceased to love and long for thy native land. The Jew
  never forgets his. He lives indeed in every corner and hole of the earth, but
  ever in the hope&mdash;'tis this that keeps his life&mdash;either himself or
  through his children to dwell once more within the walls of Jerusalem, or
  among the hills and valleys of Judea.'</p>

  <p>'Where we are not loved nor remembered, we cannot love,' he bitterly
  replied. 'I loved Rome once, more than I loved parent or kindred. The
  greatness and glory of Rome were to me infinitely more than my own. For
  her&mdash;in my beardless youth&mdash;I was ready to lay down my life at any
  moment. Nay, when the trial came, and the good Valerian set forth to redeem
  the East from the encroaching power of Persia, I was not found wanting, but
  abandoned a home, than which there was not a prouder nor happier within the
  walls of Rome, to take my chance with the emperor and my noble father. The
  issue thou knowest. How has Rome remembered me, and the brave legions that
  with me fell into the hands of these fierce barbarians? Even as Gallienus the
  son seemed to rejoice in the captivity of his parent, so has Rome the mother
  seemed to rejoice in the captivity of her children. Not an arm has she
  lifted, not a finger has she moved, to lighten the chains of our bondage, or
  rescue us from this thraldom. Rome is no longer my country.'</p>

  <p>'Consider, Roman,'I replied, 'in extenuation of thy country's fault, who
  it was that succeeded the good Valerian&mdash;then the brief reign of
  virtuous Claudius, who died ere a single purpose had time to ripen&mdash;and
  the hard task that has tied the hands of Aurelian on the borders of Gaul and
  Germany. Have patience.'</p>

  <p>'Dost thou not blush, old man,' he said, 'with that long gray beard of
  thine, and thy back bent with years, to stand there the apologist of crime?
  If ingratitude and heartlessness are to be defended, and numbered among the
  virtues, the reign of Arimanes has indeed begun. Such is not the lesson, Jew,
  thy sacred books have taught thee. But a truce with this! Thy last words this
  morning were, that thou hadst news for me. For Roman news I care not, nor
  will hear. If thou canst tell me aught of family and friends, say
  on&mdash;although&mdash;O gods, that it should be so!&mdash;even they seem to
  share the guilt of all. How many messengers have I bribed with gold, more
  than thou hast ever seen, Jew, to bear my letters to Rome, and never a word
  has been returned of good or evil. Canst thou tell me any thing of Portia my
  mother? or of Lucius Piso my brother? Live they?'</p>

  <p>'Do I not know them well?'I replied: 'who that dwells in Rome knows not
  the noble Portia? She lives yet; and long may she live, the friend of all! To
  Jew, and even to Nazarene, she is good, even as to her own. Never did age, or
  want, or helplessness, ask of her in vain. Years have not stopped the
  fountains of her tears, nor chilled a single affection of her heart. And dost
  thou think that while she remembers the outcast Jew, and the despised
  Nazarene, she forgets her own offspring? Where is thy heart, Roman, to
  suppose it? Have I not heard her, many a time, when I have been to solicit
  alms for some poor unfortunate of my tribe, run back upon the line of years,
  and speak of the wars of Valerian, of the day when she parted from her great
  husband, and her two sons, and of that dark day too when the news came that
  they were all fast in the clutch of that foul barbarian, Sapor&mdash;-and
  stood a silent and astonished witness of a love, such as I never saw in any
  other, and which seemed so great as to be a necessary seed of death to her
  frail and shattered frame? Of thee especially have I heard her descant as
  mothers will, and tell one after another of all thy beauties, nay and of the
  virtues which bound her to thee so, and of her trust so long cherished, that
  thou, more than either of her other sons, wouldst live to sustain, and even
  bear up higher, the name of Piso.'</p>

  <p>'My noble mother! was it so indeed?'</p>

  <p>'How should it be otherwise? Is it any thing that thou hast not heard from
  her? Was she to tempt herself the horrors of a Persian journey? Was she, in
  her age, to seek thee over the sands of Asia? or thy brother? Especially when
  it was held in Rome not more certain that Valerian was dead, than that thy
  father and thou wert also. The same messengers related both events. No other
  news ever came from Ctesiphon. Was not one event as likely as the other? Did
  not both rest upon the same authority? In the same commemorative acts of the
  Senate were thy name, thy father's, thy brother's, and the emperor's, with
  others who were also believed to have perished. Was Portia alone, of all
  Rome, to give the lie to universal fame? As for thy messengers, art thou so
  foolish as to believe that one ever crossed the desert, or escaped the meshes
  set for him by the jealous and malignant Sapor?'</p>

  <p>'It is enough, Jew&mdash;say no more.'</p>

  <p>'But I have much more to say, or else be false to those who sent me.'</p>

  <p>'Sent thee? who sent thee? Speak! do Portia then, and Lucius, know that I
  live? And art thou here a messenger from them?'</p>

  <p>'It is even so.'</p>

  <p>Thy brother was greatly moved. At first he made as though he would have
  embraced me, but turned and paced with quick and agitated steps the room.</p>

  <p>I then related to him how we had in Rome first heard through that soldier
  a rumor of his being yet alive&mdash;but at the same time, that he had
  renounced his country and become a Persian Satrap. I told him of thy faith in
  him and of Portia's that he would never prove a recreant to his
  country&mdash;of thy instant journey to Palmyra, with purpose to cross the
  desert thyself and risk all the dangers of Ecbatana to accomplish his
  deliverance, and of the counsel of Gracchus, which caused thee to make me a
  substitute.</p>

  <p>'Lucius then,' he at length said, approaching me, 'is in Palmyra? Is it
  so?'</p>

  <p>'It is,'I said. 'At least I left him there. He was to remain there, and
  learn the issue of my attempt. If I perished, or failed in the endeavor to
  obtain thy freedom, then was it his purpose himself to try&mdash;unless in
  the mean time he should learn through me, or otherwise, that thou wert too
  wedded to Persia and to Persian customs, to consent to change them for Rome
  and Roman ways.'</p>

  <p>'Jew, thou seest that now I hesitate. Thou hast roused all the son, the
  brother, and something of the Roman within me. I am drawn many ways. To Rome
  I will never return. Toward her, a resentment burns deep within, which I know
  will close only with life itself. But toward Palmyra, my heart yearns 'Twas
  Zenobia alone of all the world that ever moved for the rescue of Valerian:
  'twas she alone of all the world, who pitied our sorrows, and though she
  could not heal, avenged them. Her image has been a dear source of consolation
  in this long captivity. I have eagerly sought for all that could be obtained
  concerning her character, her acts, her policy, and the state of her affairs.
  And often have I thought to slip my bonds and throw myself at her feet, to
  serve with her, if need should be, either against Rome or Persia. But habit
  has prevailed, and the generous friendship of Hormisdas, to keep me here. And
  why should I change this not unpleasing certainty for the doubtful future
  that must await me in Palmyra? Here I am in the very lap of luxury. I am, as
  I have said to thee, a man without wants. All countries, and climates, and
  seas, and arts, minister to my pleasure. The learning of ancient and of
  modern times, you see there piled upon shelves, to entertain my leisure, or
  task my hours of study. I am without care&mdash;without the necessity of
  toil&mdash;with a palace, its slaves, and, I may add, its prince, at my
  command. And beyond all this present reality, there is the prospect of every
  thing else that Persia contains, upon the death of Sapor, which, in the
  course of nature, cannot be far off, if violence do not anticipate that hour.
  Yet what thou now tellest me, renews my desire of change. Lucius is in
  Palmyra&mdash;perhaps he would dwell there. 'Tis the home, I learn, of many
  noble Romans. Who can say that Portia might not come and complete our
  happiness?'</p>

  <p>And saying these things, he began to muse. He again paced with folded arms
  the long apartment. I saw that he was still distracted by doubts. I knew of
  but one thing more to say, by which to work upon his passionate nature. I
  resolved to say it, though I know not what thou wilt think of it, nor what
  the event may be. There was, thou knowest, ere I left Palmyra, rumor of war
  between Palmyra and Rome. Barely to name this, it seemed to me, would be on
  the instant to fix his wavering mind. I could not withstand the temptation.
  But, Piso once in Palmyra, and sure I am I shall be forgiven. I began again
  thus.</p>

  <p>'Gracchus too, Roman; dost thou not remember the family of Gracchus? He
  also is in Palmyra.'</p>

  <p>'Ay, I remember him well. A man of true nobility&mdash;now one of the
  Queen's chief advisers, and head of the Senate. He had a daughter too, who,
  her mother dying young, was committed to the care of Portia, and was as a
  sister. Does she live?&mdash;and dwells she in Palmyra?'</p>

  <p>'She lives, and beneath her father's roof. Fame speaks loudly of her
  beauty and her wit, and more loudly still of her young wisdom, and influence
  with the Queen. Her spirit is the counterpart of Zenobia's. She is,
  notwithstanding her long Roman nurture, a Palmyrene of the truest stamp. And
  ever since there have been these rumors of a war with Rome'&mdash;</p>

  <p>'What sayst thou? What is that? War with Rome? Did I hear aright?'</p>

  <p>'Verily thou didst. 'Twas the current report when I left Palmyra. It came
  both by the way of Antioch and Alexandria. Nothing was talked of else. Ever
  since, I say&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Why hast thou not said this before? How shall I believe thee?'</p>

  <p>'I said it not before, simply because I thought not of it. How was I to
  know what thou most desiredst to hear? I can give thee no other ground of
  belief than common rumor. If my own opinion will weigh aught, I may add, that
  for myself I have not a doubt that the report springs from truth. When at
  Rome, it was commonly spoken of, and by those too whom I knew to be near the
  emperor, that Aurelian felt himself aggrieved and insulted, that a woman
  should hold under her dominion territories that once belonged to Rome, and
  who had wrested them from Rome by defeat of Roman generals&mdash;and had
  sworn to restore the empire in the East as well as West, to its ancient
  bounds. At Palmyra too I found those who were of deep intelligence in the
  politics of the times, who felt sure of nothing more than that, what with the
  pride of Zenobia and the ambition of Aurelian, war was inevitable. I tell
  thee these things as they fell upon my ear. Before this, as I think, it is
  most likely that war may have broken out between the two nations.'</p>

  <p>'Thou hast now spoken, Jew,' said Calpurnius. 'Hadst thou said these
  things at first, thou hadst spared me much tormenting doubt. My mind is now
  bent and determined upon flight. This it will not be difficult, I think, to
  accomplish. But what is thy plan?&mdash;for I suppose, coming upon this
  errand, thou hast one well digested. But remember now, as I have already
  warned thee, that thy head will answer for any failure: detection will be
  death.'</p>

  <p>'Death is little to a Jew, who in dying dies for his country. And such
  would be my death. Whether I live or die, 'tis for Jerusalem. Thy brother
  rewards me largely for this journey, and these dangers I encounter; and if I
  perish, the double of the whole sum agreed upon is to be paid according to
  certain directions left with him. I would rather live; but I shall not shrink
  from death. But, Piso, detection shall not ensue. I have not lived to this
  age, to writhe upon a Persian spear, or grin from over a Persian gateway.
  What I have devised is this. Thou seest my slave Hadad?'</p>

  <p>'I see him&mdash;an Ethiopian.'</p>

  <p>'So he seems to thee. But his skin is white as thine. By an art, known
  only to me, it has been changed to this ebon hue.'</p>

  <p>'What follows?'</p>

  <p>'This. Thou art to take his place, thy skin being first made to resemble
  his, while he is cleansed, and remains in Ecbatana. We then, thou bearing my
  packages of merchandise, take our way, quietly and in broad day-light,
  through the gates of Ecbatana. How sayst thou?'</p>

  <p>'The invention is perfect. I cannot fear the result.</p>

  <p>'So soon then as I shall have made some few preparations, for which to-
  morrow will suffice, I shall be ready for the desert.'</p>

  <p>I heard these words with joy. I now called to Hadad to open his cases of
  jewels, from which I took a seal, having upon it the head of Zenobia, and
  offered it to Calpurnius. He seized it with eagerness, having never before
  seen even so much as a drawing of the Great Queen. I then drew forth thine
  own ring and gave him, with that locket containing the hair of Portia, and
  thy letter. He received them with emotion; and as I engaged myself in
  re-packing my goods, my quick ear caught tears falling upon the sheet as he
  read.</p>

  <p>I then returned to the house of Levi.</p>

  <p>Thus have I accomplished, successfully so far, my errand. I write these
  things to thee, because a caravan leaves Ecbatana in the morning, and may
  reach Palmyra before ourselves; though it is quite possible that we may
  overtake and join it. But we may also be delayed for many days. So that it is
  right, in that case, thou shouldst hear.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">In these words, my Curtius, you have, for the most part,
the letter of
  Isaac. I have omitted many things which at another time you shall see. They
  are such as relate chiefly to himself and his faith&mdash;abounding in
  cautions against that heretic Probus, who haunts his imagination as if he
  were the very genius of evil.</p>

  <p>How can I believe it, that within a few hours I may embrace a brother,
  separated so long, and so long numbered with the dead? Yet how mixed the
  pleasure! He returns a brother, but not a Roman. Nay, 'tis the expectation of
  war with Rome, that has gained him. I am perplexed and sad, at the same time
  that I leap for joy. Fausta cannot conceal her satisfaction&mdash;yet she
  pities me. Gracchus tells us to moderate our feelings and expectations, as
  the full cup is often spilled. No more now&mdash;except this&mdash;that you
  fail not at once to send this letter to Portia. Farewell!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="letter09"
     id="letter09">LETTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SEVERAL days have elapsed since I last wrote, yet
Calpurnius is not
  arrived. I am filled with apprehensions. I fear lest he may have thought too
  lightly of the difficulties of an escape, and of the strictness with which he
  is watched; for while he seems to have held it an easy matter to elude the
  vigilance of his keepers, common opinion at Ecbatana appears to have judged
  very differently. Yet, after all, I cannot but rely with much confidence upon
  the discretion and the cunning of Isaac. I must now relate what has happened
  in the mean time.</p>

  <p>It was the morning after Isaac's letter had been received and read, that
  Milo presented himself, with a countenance and manner indicative of some
  inward disturbance.</p>

  <p>'And what,'I asked, 'may be the matter?'</p>

  <p>'Enough is the matter, both for yourself and me,' he replied. 'Here now
  has been a wretch of an Arab, a fellow of no appearance, a mere camel-driver,
  desiring to see you. I told him flatly that you were not to be seen by scum
  such as he. I advised him to be gone, before he might have to complain of a
  broken head. And what do you suppose was the burden of his errand? Why truly
  to ask of the most noble Piso concerning his wife and child! I begged him to
  consider whether, supposing you did know aught concerning them, you would
  deign to communicate with a sun-baked beggar of the desert like him.
  Whereupon he raised a lance longer than a mast, and would have run me
  through, but for the expertness with which I seized and wrested it from him,
  and then broke it over his head. 'Twas the same scowling knave whose camels
  choked the street the first day we entered the city, and who sent his curse
  after us. Hassan is his name. His eye left a mark on me that's not out yet. A
  hyena's is nothing to it.'</p>

  <p>Thus did he run on. I could have speared him as willingly as Hassan. It
  was plain that the husband of the woman found in the desert by Isaac, hearing
  a rumor of intelligence received by me, had been to obtain such information
  as possibly I might possess of his wife and child. Upon asking my slave where
  the camel-driver now was, he replied that, 'Truly he did not know; he had
  been driven from the court-yard with blows, and it was a mercy that his life
  was left to him. He had been taught how again to curse Romans.'</p>

  <p>It was in vain that I assured him once and again that he was no longer in
  the service of an emperor, and that it was unnecessary to treat me with quite
  so much deference; his only regret was that the robber had got off so easily.
  As the only reparation in my power for such stupidity and inhumanity, I
  ordered Milo instantly to set forth in search of Hassan, in the quarter of
  the city which the Arabs chiefly frequent, and finding him, to bring him to
  the house of Gracchus, for I had news for him. This was little relished by
  Milo, and I could see, by the change of his countenance, that his cowardly
  soul was ill-inclined to an encounter with the insulted Arab, in the remote
  parts of the city, and unaccompanied by any of the slaves of the palace.
  Nevertheless, he started upon his errand&mdash;but, as I afterward learned,
  bribed Hannibal to act as life- guard.</p>

  <p>Thinking that I might possibly fall in with him myself, and desirous,
  moreover, of an occupation that should cause me to forget Calpurnius and my
  anxieties for a season, I went forth also, taking the paths that first
  offered themselves. A sort of instinct drew me, as it almost always does, to
  one of the principal streets of the city, denominated, from the size and
  beauty of the trees which adorn it, the Street of Palms. This is an avenue
  which traverses the city in its whole length; and at equal distances from its
  centre, and also running its whole length, there shoots up a double row of
  palms, which, far above the roofs of the highest buildings, spread out their
  broad and massy tufts of leaves, and perfectly protect the throngs below from
  the rays of the blazing sun. Thus a deep shadow is cast upon the floor of the
  street, while at the same time, it is unencumbered by the low branches, which
  on every other kind of tree stretch out in all directions, and obstruct the
  view, taking away a greater beauty and advantage than they give. This palm is
  not the date- bearing species, but of another sort, attaining a loftier
  growth, and adorned with a larger leaf. A pity truly it is, that Rome cannot
  crown itself with this princely diadem; but even though the bitter blasts
  from the Appennines did not prevent, a want of taste for what is beautiful
  would. The Roman is a coarse form of humanity, Curtius, compared with either
  the Greek or the Palmyrene. Romans will best conquer the world, or defend it;
  but its adorning should be left to others. Their hands are rude, and they but
  spoil what they touch. Since the days of Cicero, and the death of the
  Republic, what has Rome done to advance any cause, save that of slavery and
  licentiousness? A moral Hercules is needed to sweep it clean of corruptions,
  which it is amazing have not ere this drawn down the thunder of the gods.
  Julia would say that Christ is that Hercules. May it be so!</p>

  <p>Along the street which I had thus entered I slowly sauntered, observing
  the people who thronged it, and the shops with their varieties which lined
  it. I could easily gather from the conversation which now and then fell upon
  my ear&mdash;sometimes as I mingled with those who were observing a fine
  piece of sculpture or a new picture exposed for sale, or examining the
  articles which some hawker with much vociferation thrust upon the attention
  of those who were passing along, or waiting at a fountain, while slaves in
  attendance served round in vessels of glass, water cooled with snow and
  flavored with the juice of fruits peculiar to the East&mdash;that the arrival
  of the ambassadors had caused a great excitement among the people, and had
  turned all thoughts into one channel. Frequently were they gathered together
  in groups, around some of the larger trees, or at the corners of the streets,
  or at the entrance of some conspicuous shop, to listen to the news which one
  had to tell, or to arguments upon the all-engrossing theme with which another
  sought to bring over those who would listen, to one or another side of the
  great question. But I must confess that&mdash;save in a very few
  instances&mdash;the question was no question at all, and had but one side.
  Those whom I heard, and who were listened to by any numbers, and with any
  patience, were zealous patriots, inveighing bitterly against the ambition and
  tyranny of Rome, and prognosticating national degradation, and ruin, and
  slavery, if once the policy of concession to her demands was adopted.</p>

  <p>'Palmyra,' they said, 'with Zenobia and Longinus at her head, the deserts
  around her, and Persia to back her, might fearlessly stand against Rome and
  the world. Empire began in the East: it had only wandered for a while to the
  West&mdash;losing its way. The East was its native seat, and there it would
  return. Why should not Palmyra be what Assyria and Persia once were? What
  kingdom of the world, and what age, could ever boast a general like Zabdas, a
  minister like Longinus, a queen like the great Zenobia?' At such flights, the
  air would resound with the plaudits of the listening crowd, who would then
  disperse and pursue their affairs, or presently gather around some new
  declaimer.</p>

  <p>I was greatly moved on several of these occasions, to make a few
  statements in reply to some of the orators, and which might possibly have let
  a little light upon minds willing to know the truth; but I doubted whether
  even the proverbially good-natured and courteous Palmyrenes might not take
  umbrage at it. As I turned from one of these little knots of politicians, I
  encountered Otho, a nobleman of Palmyra and one of the Queen's council. 'I
  was just asking myself,' said I, saluting him, 'whether the temper of your
  people, even and forbearing as it is, would allow a Roman in their own city
  to harangue them, who should not so much advocate a side, as aim to impart
  truth.'</p>

  <p>'Genuine Palmyrenes,' he answered, 'would listen with patience and
  civility. But, in a crowded street, one can never answer for his audience.
  You see here not only Palmyrenes, but strangers from all parts of the
  East&mdash;people from our conquered provinces and dependences, who feel
  politically with the Palmyrene, but yet have not the manners of the
  Palmyrene. There is an Armenian, there a Saracen, there an Arab, there a
  Cappadocian, there a Jew, and there an Egyptian&mdash;politically perhaps
  with us, but otherwise a part of us not more than the Ethiopian or Scythian.
  The Senate of Palmyra would hear all you might say&mdash;or the Queen's
  council&mdash;but not the street, I fear. Nay, one of these idle boys, but
  whose patriotism is ever boiling over, might in his zeal and his ignorance do
  that which should bring disgrace upon our good city. I should rather pray you
  to forbear. But if you will extend your walk to the Portico which I have just
  left, you will there find a more select crowd than jostles us where we stand,
  and perhaps ears ready to hear you. All that you may say to divert the heart
  of the nation from this mad enterprise, I shall be most grateful for. But any
  words which you may speak, or which a present god might utter, would avail no
  more against the reigning frenzy, than would a palm leaf against a whirlwind
  of the desert.'</p>

  <p>As he uttered these words, with a voice somewhat elevated, several had
  gathered about us, listening with eagerness to what the noble and respected
  Otho had to say. They heard him attentively, shook their heads, and turned
  away&mdash;some saying: 'He is a good man, but timid.' Others scrupled not to
  impute to him a 'Roman leaning.' When he had ended, seeing that a number had
  pressed around, he hastily wished me a happy day, and moved down the street I
  bent my way toward the Portico, ruminating the while upon the fates of
  empire.</p>

  <p>I soon reached that magnificent structure, with its endless lines of
  columns. More than the usual crowd of talkers, idlers, strangers, buyers and
  sellers, thronged its ample pavements. One portion of it seems to be
  appropriated, at least abandoned, to those who have aught that is rare and
  beautiful to dispose of. Before one column stands a Jew with antiquities
  raked from the ruins of Babylon or Thebes&mdash;displaying their coins, their
  mutilated statuary, or half legible inscriptions. At another, you see a Greek
  with some masterpiece of Zeuxis&mdash;nobody less&mdash;which he swears is
  genuine, and to his oaths adds a parchment containing its history, with names
  of men in Athens, Antioch and Alexandria, who attest it all. At the foot of
  another, sits a dealer in manuscripts, remarkable either as being the
  complete works of distinguished authors, or for the perfection of the art of
  the copyist, or for their great antiquity. Here were Manetho and
  Sanchoniathon to be had perfect and complete! Not far from these stood
  others, who offered sculptures, ancient and modern&mdash;vases of every
  beautiful form, from those of Egypt and Etruria, to the freshly-wrought ones
  of our own Demetrius&mdash;and jewelry of the most rare and costly kinds.
  There is scarce an article of taste, or valuable of any sort whatever, but
  may be found here, brought from all parts of the world. In Persian, Indian,
  and Chinese rarities&mdash;which in Rome are rarities indeed&mdash;I have
  dealt largely, and shall return with much to show you.</p>

  <p>When, with some toil, I had won a passage through this busy mart, I
  mingled with a different crowd. I passed from buyers and sellers among those
  who were, like myself, brought there merely for the purpose of seeing others,
  of passing the time, and observing the beautiful effects of this interminable
  Portico, with its moving and changing crowds robed in a thousand varieties of
  the richest costume. It was indeed a spectacle of beauty, such as I never had
  seen before nor elsewhere. I chose out point after point, and stood a silent
  and rapt observer of the scene. Of the view from one of these points, I have
  purchased a painting, done with exquisite skill, which I shall send to you,
  and which will set before you almost the living reality.</p>

  <p>To this part of the Portico those resort who wish to hear the opinions of
  the day upon subjects of politics or literature, or philosophy, or to
  disseminate their own. He who cherishes a darling theory upon any branch of
  knowledge, and would promulgate it, let him come here, and he will find
  hearers at least. As I walked along, I was attracted by a voice declaiming
  with much earnestness to a crowd of hearers, and who seemed as I drew near to
  listen with attention, some being seated upon low blocks of marble arranged
  among the columns of the Portico for this purpose, others leaning against the
  columns themselves, and others standing on the outside of the circle. The
  philosopher&mdash;for such I perceived him at once to be&mdash;was evidently
  a Greek. He was arrayed in a fashionable garb, with a robe much like our toga
  thrown over his shoulders, and which he made great use of in his
  gesticulations. A heavy chain of gold was wound around his neck, and then
  crossing several times his breast, hung down in artificially-arranged
  festoons. A general air of effeminacy produced in the hearer at once a state
  of mind not very favorably disposed to receive his opinions. The first words
  I caught were these: 'In this manner,' said he, 'did that wonderful genius
  interpret the universe. 'Tis not credible that any but children and slaves
  should judge differently. Was there once nothing? Then were there nothing
  now. But there is something now, We see it. The world is. Then it has always
  been. It is an eternal Being. It is infinite. Ha! can you escape me now? Say,
  can there be two infinites? Then where are your gods? The fabled creator or
  creators&mdash;be they many or one&mdash;of the universe? Vanished, I fancy,
  at the touch of my intellectual wand, into thin air. Congratulate yourselves
  upon your freedom. The Egyptians had gods, and you know what they were. The
  Greeks had gods, and you know what they were. Those nations grovelled and
  writhed under their partly childish, partly terrific, and partly disgusting
  superstitions. Happy that the reality of divine natures can, so easily as I
  have now done it, be disproved! The superincumbent gloom is dispersed. Light
  has broken through. And so too, touching the immortality of the soul.
  Immortality of the soul! Did any one of you ever see a soul? I should like to
  have that question answered:'&mdash;he swung defyingly his robe and
  paused&mdash;'did any one ever see a soul! Yes, and that it was immortal,
  too! You see a body, and therefore you believe in it. You see that it is
  mortal and therefore you believe in its mortality. You do not see the
  soul&mdash;therefore you believe in one? Is that your reasoning? How plain
  the argument is! When the god or gods&mdash;suppose their being&mdash;shall
  send down and impart to me the astounding fact that I am not one, as I seem,
  but two&mdash;am not mortal, as I seem, but immortal&mdash;do not melt into
  dust at death, but rise in spirit&mdash;then will I believe such things, not
  otherwise. Have we knowledge of any other existences&mdash;elemental
  existences&mdash;than corporeal atoms? None. These constitute the human
  being. Death is their separation, and that separation means the end of the
  being they once did constitute. But it may all be summed up in a word. When
  you can see and touch your own soul, as you do see and touch your body,
  believe in it. Deny and reject this principle, and the world will continue to
  suffer from its belief in gorgons, demons, spectres, gods, and monsters; in
  Tartarean regions and torments of damned spirits. Adopt it, and life flows
  undisturbed by visionary fears, and death comes as a long and welcome sleep,
  upon which no terrors and no dreams intrude.'</p>

  <p>Such was the doctrine, and such nearly the language of the follower of
  Epicurus. You will easily judge how far he misrepresented the opinions of
  that philosopher. As I turned away from this mischievous dealer in Cimmerian
  darkness, I inquired of one who stood near me who this great man might
  be.</p>

  <p>'What,' said he, in reply, 'do you not know Critias the Epicurean? You
  must be a stranger in Palmyra. Do you not see, by the quality of his
  audience, that he leads away with him all the fine spirits of the city?
  Observe how the greater number of these who hang upon his lips resemble, in
  their dress and air, the philosopher.'</p>

  <p>'I see it is so. It seems as if all the profligates and young rakes of
  Palmyra&mdash;of the nobler sort&mdash;were assembled here to receive some
  new lessons in the art of self-destruction.'</p>

  <p>'Many a philosopher of old would, I believe,' he rejoined, 'have prayed
  that his system might perish with himself, could he have looked forward into
  futurity, and known how it would be interpreted and set forth by his
  followers. The temperate and virtuous Epicurus little thought that his name
  and doctrine would in after times be the rallying point for the licentious
  and dissolute. His philosophy was crude enough, and mischievous I grant in
  its principles and tendencies. But it was promulgated, I am sure, with honest
  intentions, and he himself was not aware of its extreme liability to
  misapprehension and perversion. How would his ears tingle at what we have now
  heard!'</p>

  <p>'And would after all deserve it,'I replied. 'For he, it seems to me, is
  too ignorant of human nature, to venture upon the office of teacher of
  mankind, who believes that the reality of a superintending providence can be
  denied with safety to the world. A glance at history, and the slightest
  penetration into human character, would have shown him, that atheism, in any
  of its forms, is incompatible with the existence of a social state.'</p>

  <p>'What you say is very true,' replied the Palmyrene; 'I defend only the
  intentions and personal character of Epicurus, not his real fitness for his
  office. This Critias, were it not for the odiousness of any interference with
  men's opinions, I should like to see driven from our city back to his native
  Athens, Listen now as he lays down the method of a happy life. See how these
  young idlers drink in the nectarean stream. But enough. I leave them in their
  own stye. Farewell! Pray invite the philosopher to visit you at Rome, We can
  spare him.'</p>

  <p>Saying this, he turned upon his heel and went his way. I also passed on.
  Continuing my walk up the Portico, I perceived at a little distance another
  dark mass of persons, apparently listening with profound attention to one who
  was addressing them. Hoping to hear some one discoursing upon the condition
  of the country and its prospects, I joined the circle. But I was
  disappointed. The orator was a follower of Plato, and a teacher of his
  philosophy. His aim seemed to be to darken the minds of his hearers by
  unintelligible refinements, at least such I thought the effect must be. He
  clothed his thoughts&mdash;if thoughts there really were any&mdash;in such a
  many-colored cloud of poetic diction, that the mind, while it was undoubtedly
  excited, received not a single clear idea, but was left in a pleasing,
  half-bewildered state, with visions of beautiful divine truth floating before
  it, which it in vain attempted to arrest, and convert to reality. All was
  obscure, shadowy, impalpable. Yet was he heard with every testimony of
  reverence, on the part of his audience. They evidently thought him original
  and profound, in proportion as he was incomprehensible. I could not help
  calling to mind the remark of the Palmyrene who had just parted from me. It
  is difficult to believe that Plato himself labored to be obscure, though some
  affirm it. I would rather believe that his great mind, always searching after
  truth at the greatest heights and lowest depths, often but partially seized
  it, being defeated by its very vastness; yet, ambitious to reveal it to
  mankind, he hesitated not to exhibit it in the form and with the completeness
  he best could. It was necessary, therefore, that what he but half knew
  himself, should be imperfectly and darkly stated, and dimly comprehended by
  others. For this reason, his writings are obscure&mdash;obscure, not because
  of truths for their vastness beyond the reach of our minds, but because they
  abound in conceptions but half formed&mdash;in inconsequential
  reasonings&mdash;in logic overlaid and buried beneath a poetic phraseology.
  They will always be obscure, in spite of the labors of the commentators; or,
  a commentary can make them plain only by substituting the sense of the critic
  for the no-sense of the original. But Plato did not aim at darkness. And
  could his spirit have listened to the jargon which I had just heard
  proclaimed as Platonism, consisting of common-place thoughts, laboriously
  tortured and involved, till their true semblance was lost, and instead of
  them a wordy mist&mdash;glowing indeed oftentimes with rainbow
  colors&mdash;was presented to the mind of the hearer for him to feed upon, he
  would at the moment have as heartily despised, as he had formerly gloried in,
  the name and office of philosopher.</p>

  <p>I waited not to learn the results at which this great master of wisdom
  would arrive, but quickly turned away, and advanced still farther toward the
  upper termination of the Portico. The numbers of those who frequented this
  vast pile diminished sensibly at this part of it. Nevertheless, many were
  still like myself wandering listlessly around. Quite at the extremity of the
  building I observed however a larger collection than I had noticed before;
  and, as it appeared to me, deeply absorbed by what they heard. I cared not to
  make one of them, having had enough of philosophy for the day. But as I stood
  not far from them, idly watching the labors of the workmen who were carrying
  up the column of Aurelian&mdash;noting how one laid the stone which another
  brought, and how another bore along and up the dizzy ladders the mortar which
  others tempered, and how the larger masses of marble were raised to their
  places by machines worked by elephants, and how all went on in exact
  order&mdash;while I stood thus, the voice of the speaker frequently fell upon
  my ear, and at last, by its peculiarity, and especially by the unwonted 4
  earnestness of the tone, drew me away to a position nearer the listening
  crowd. By the words which I now distinctly caught, I discovered that it was a
  Christian who was speaking. I joined the outer circle of hearers, but the
  preacher&mdash;for so the Christians term those who declare their doctrines
  in public&mdash;was concealed from me by a column. I could hear him
  distinctly, and I could see the faces, with their expressions, of those whom
  he addressed. The greater part manifested the deepest interest and sympathy
  with him who addressed them, but upon the countenances of some sat scorn and
  contempt&mdash;ridicule, doubt, and disbelief. As the voice fell upon my ear,
  in this my nearer position, I was startled. 'Surely,'I said, 'I have heard it
  before, and yet as surely I never before heard a Christian preach.' The
  thought of Probus flashed across my mind; and suddenly changing my
  place&mdash;and by passing round the assembly, coming in front of the
  preacher&mdash;I at once recognised the pale and melancholy features of the
  afflicted Christian. I was surprised and delighted. He had convinced me, at
  the few interviews I had had with him, that he was no common man, and I had
  determined to obtain from him, if I should ever meet him again, all necessary
  knowledge of the Christian institutions and doctrine. Although I had learned
  much, in the mean time, from both Julia and the Hermit, still there was much
  left which I felt I could obtain, probably in a more exact mariner, from
  Probus. I was rejoiced to see him. He was evidently drawing to the close of
  his address. The words which I first caught, were nearly these:</p>

  <p>'Thus have I declared to you, Palmyrenes, Romans, and whoever are here?
  how Christianity seeks the happiness of man, by securing his virtue. Its
  object is your greater well-being through the truths it publishes and
  enforces. It comes to your understandings, not to darken and confound them by
  words without meaning, but to shed light upon them by a revelation of those
  few sublime doctrines of which I have now discoursed to you. Has the Greek,
  the Roman, or the Persian philosophy, furnished your minds with truths like
  these? Has life a great object, or death an issue of certainty and joy, under
  either of those systems of faith? Systems of faith! I blush to term them so.
  I am a Roman, the son of a priest of the temple of Jupiter. Shall I reveal to
  you the greater and the lesser mysteries of that worship? I see by most
  expressive signs that it cannot be needful. Why then, if ye yourselves know
  and despise the popular worship, why will you not consider the claims of
  Jesus of Nazareth?'</p>

  <p>'I despise it not,' cried a voice from the throng, 'I honor it.'</p>

  <p>'In every nation,' continued the preacher, 'and among all worshippers, are
  there those whom God will accept The sincere offering of the heart will never
  be refused. Socrates, toiling and dying in the cause of truth&mdash;though
  that truth, in the light of the Gospel, were error&mdash;is beloved of God.
  But if God has in these latter days announced new truth, if he has sent a
  special messenger to teach it, or if it be asserted by persons of
  intelligence and apparent honesty that he has, ought not every sincere lover
  of truth and of God, or the gods, to inquire diligently whether it be so or
  not? Socrates would have done so. Search, men of Palmyra, into the certainty
  of these things. These many years has the word of Christ been preached in
  your streets, yet how few followers can as yet be counted of him who came to
  bless you! Sleep no longer. Close not the ear against the parent voice of the
  Gospel Fear not that the religion of Jesus comes to reign over aught but your
  hearts. It asks no dominion over your temporal affairs. It cares not for
  thrones, nor the sword, nor princely revenues, nor seats of honor. It would
  serve you, not rule over you. And the ministers of Christ are your servants
  in spiritual things, seeking not yours, but you.'</p>

  <p>'Paul! Paul of Antioch!' shouted several voices at once.</p>

  <p>'I defend not Paul of Antioch,' cried Probus, no ways disconcerted. 'Judge
  Christianity, I pray you, not by me, nor by Paul, but by itself. Because a
  fool lectures upon the philosophy of Plato, you do not therefore condemn
  Plato for a fool. Because a disciple of Zeno lives luxuriously, you do not
  for that take up a judgment against the philosopher himself. Paul of
  Samosata, not in his doctrine, but in his life, is an alien, a foreigner, an
  adversary, and no friend or servant of Jesus. Listen, citizens of Palmyra,
  while I read to you what the founder of Christianity himself says touching
  this matter!' and he drew from beneath his robe a small parchment roll, and
  turning to the part he sought, read in a loud voice words of Jesus such as
  these: 'He that is greatest among you shall be your servant. Whosoever shall
  exalt himself shall be abased, and he that shall humble himself shall be
  exalted.' 'This is the doctrine of Christ. According to Jesus, "he among his
  disciples is greatest, who performs for others the most essential service."'
  He then turned to another part of the book, and read a long, and as it struck
  me beautiful passage, in which the author of Christianity was represented as
  stooping and washing the feet of his disciples, to enforce in a more lively
  way his doctrine of humility and philanthropy. When he had finished it, a
  deep silence had fallen upon those who listened. It was broken by the voice
  of Probus once more saying in low and sorrowful tones: 'I confess&mdash;with
  grief and shame I confess&mdash;that pride, and arrogance, and the lust of
  power, are already among the ministers of Jesus. They are sundering
  themselves from their master, and thrusting a sword into the life of his
  Gospel. And if this faith of Christ should ever&mdash;as a prophetic eye sees
  it so sure to do&mdash;fill the throne of the world, and sit in Caesar's
  place, may the God who gave it appear for it, that it perish not through the
  encumbering weight of earthly glory. Through tribulation and persecution it
  has held on its way without swerving. Prosperity begins already to weaken and
  defile&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>What more Probus would have added, I know not; for at this point an
  unusual disturbance arose in the streets. Trumpets sent forth their long
  peal, and a troop of out-riders, as accompanying some great personage, rode
  rapidly along, followed by the crowd of idle lookers-on. And immediately a
  chariot appeared, with a single individual seated in it, who seemed to take
  great pleasure in his own state. No sooner had the pageant arrived over
  against that part of the Portico where we stood, than one and another of
  Probus's hearers exclaimed:</p>

  <p>'Ha! Paul! Paul of Antioch! Behold a Christian servant!' And the whole
  throng turned away in confusion to watch the spectacle.</p>

  <p>'An unhappy commentary upon the doctrine,' said a Palmyrene to me, as he
  turned sneeringly away.</p>

  <p>'What say you to this?' asked another, of Probus himself, as he descended
  from his rostrum, and stood gazing with the rest, but with a burning cheek
  and downcast eye.</p>

  <p>'I say,' he replied, 'what I have said before, that yonder bishop, however
  christianized his head may be is a misbeliever in his heart. He is a true
  anti-Christ.'</p>

  <p>'I am disposed to trust you,' rejoined the other. 'I have heard you not
  without emotion. We have had among us many who have declared the doctrine of
  Christ. But I have heeded them not, It is different with me now. I am
  desirous to know what this doctrine of Christ is. I have been impressed by
  what you recited from the writings of Jesus. How, Christian, shall I apply
  myself, and where, to learn more than I know now?'</p>

  <p>'If thou wilt learn of so humble a teacher as I am,&mdash;who yet know
  somewhat of what Christianity really is&mdash;come and hear me at the place
  of Christian worship in the street that runs behind the great Persian Inn.
  There, this evening when the sun is down, shall I preach again the truth in
  Christ.'</p>

  <p>'I shall not fail to be there,' said the other, and moved away.</p>

  <p>'Nor shall I, Probus,' said I, heartily saluting him.</p>

  <p>'Noble Piso!' he cried, his countenance suddenly growing bright as the
  sun, 'I am glad to meet you at length. And have you too heard a Christian
  preach? A senator of Rome?'</p>

  <p>'I have; and I shall gladly hear more. I am not, however, a Christian,
  Probus; I profess to be but a seeker after truth, if perhaps it may be found
  in your faith, having failed to discover it among dead or living
  philosophers. I shall hear you to-night.'</p>

  <p>After many mutual inquiries concerning each other's welfare, we
  separated.</p>

  <p>Upon returning to the house of Gracchus, and finding myself again in the
  company of Fausta and her father, I said: 'I go to-night to hear a Christian,
  the Christian Probus, discourse concerning the Christian doctrine. Will you
  accompany me, Fausta?'</p>

  <p>'Not now, Lucius,' she replied; 'my head and heart are too full of the
  interests and cares of Zenobia, to allow me to think of aught else. No other
  reason, I assure you, prevents. I have no fears of the opinions of others to
  hinder me. When our public affairs are once more in a settled state, I shall
  not be slow to learn more of the religion of which you speak. Julia's
  attachment to it, of itself, has almost made a convert of me already, so full
  of sympathy in all things is a true affection. But the heart is a poor
  logician. It darts to its object, overleaping all reasons, and may as well
  rest in error as truth. Whatever the purity of Julia and the honesty and
  vigor of Zenobia accept and worship, I believe I should, without further
  investigation, though they were the fooleries and gods of Egypt, Did you
  succeed in your search of the Arab?'</p>

  <p>'No: but perhaps Milo has. To tell the truth, I was soon diverted from
  that object, first by the excitement I found prevailing among the people on
  the affairs of the kingdom, and afterward by the spectacles of the Portico,
  and the preaching of Probus, whom. I encountered there.'</p>

  <p>In the evening, soon as the sun was set, I wound my way to the Christians'
  place of worship.</p>

  <p>It was in a part of the city remote and obscure, indicating very plainly
  that whatever Christianity may be destined to accomplish in this city, it has
  done little as yet. Indeed, I do not perceive what principle of strength or
  power it possesses, sufficient to force its way through the world, and into
  the hearts of men. It allows not the use of the sword; it resorts not to the
  civil arm; it is devoid of all that should win upon the senses of the
  multitude, being, beyond all other forms of faith, remarkable for its
  simplicity, for its spiritual and intellectual character. Moreover, it is
  stern and uncompromising in its morality, requiring the strictest purity of
  life, and making virtue to consist not in the outward act, but in the secret
  motive which prompts the act. It is at open and unintermitting war with all
  the vain and vicious inclinations of the heart. It insists upon an undivided
  sovereignty over the whole character and life of the individual. And in
  return for such surrender, it bestows no other reward than an inward
  consciousness of right action, and of the approbation of God, with the hope
  of immortality. It seems thus to have man's whole nature, and all the
  institutions of the world, especially of other existing religions, to contend
  with. If it prevail against such odds, and with such means as it alone
  employs, it surely will carry along with it its own demonstration of its
  divinity. But how it shall have power to achieve such conquests, I now cannot
  see nor conjecture.</p>

  <p>Arriving at the place designated by Probus, I found a low building of
  stone, which seemed to have been diverted from former uses of a different
  kind, to serve its present purpose as a temple of religious worship. Passing
  through a door, of height scarce sufficient to admit a person of ordinary
  stature, I reached a vestibule, from which by a descent of a few steps I
  entered a large circular apartment, low but not inelegant, with a vaulted
  ceiling supported by chaste Ionic columns. The assembly was already seated,
  but the worship not begun. The service consisted of prayers to God, offered
  in the name of Christ; of reading a portion of the sacred books of the
  Christians, of preaching, of music sung to religious words, and voluntary
  offerings of money or other gifts for the poor.</p>

  <p>I cannot doubt that you are repelled, my Curtius, by this account of a
  worship of such simplicity as to amount almost to poverty. But I must tell
  you that never have I been so overwhelmed by emotions of the noblest kind, as
  when sitting in the midst of these despised Nazarenes, and joining in their
  devotions; for to sit neuter in such a scene, it was not in my nature to do,
  nor would it have been in yours, much as you affect to despise this
  'superstitious race.' This was indeed worship. It was a true communion of the
  creature with the Creator. Never before had I heard a prayer. How different
  from the loud and declamatory harangues of our priests! the full and rich
  tones of the voice of Probus, expressive of deepest reverence of the Being he
  addressed, and of profoundest humility on the part of the worshipper, seeming
  too as if uttered in no part by the usual organs of speech, but as if
  pronounced by the very heart itself, fell upon the charmed ear like notes
  from another world. There was a new and strange union, both in the manner of
  the Christian and in the sentiments he expressed, of an awe such as I never
  before witnessed in man towards the gods, and a familiarity and child-like
  confidence, that made me feel as if the God to whom he prayed was a father
  and a friend, in a much higher sense than we are accustomed to regard the
  Creator of the universe. It was a child soliciting mercies from a kind and
  considerate parent&mdash;conscious of much frailty and ill desert, but
  relying too with a perfect trust, both upon the equity and benignity of the
  God of his faith. I received an impression also from the quiet and breathless
  silence of the apartment, from the low and but just audible voice of the
  preacher, of the near neighborhood of gods and men, of the universal presence
  of the infinite spirit of the Deity, which certainly I had never received
  before. I could hardly divest myself of the feeling that the God addressed
  was in truth in the midst of the temple; and I found my eye turning to the
  ceiling, as if there must be some visible manifestation of his presence. I
  wish you could have been there. I am sure that after witnessing such
  devotions, contempt or ridicule would be the last emotions you would ever
  entertain toward this people. Neither could you any longer apply to them the
  terms fanatic, enthusiast, or superstitious. You would have seen a calmness,
  a sobriety, a decency, so remarkable; you would have heard sentiments so
  rational, so instructive, so exalted, that you would have felt your
  prejudices breaking away and disappearing without any volition or act of your
  own. Nay, against your will they would have fallen. And nothing would have
  been left but the naked question&mdash;not is this faith beautiful and
  worthy&mdash;but is this religion true or false?</p>

  <p>When the worship had been begun by prayer to God in the name of Christ,
  then one of the officiating priests opened the book of the Christians, the
  Gospels, and read from the Greek, in which they are written&mdash;changing it
  into the Palmyrene dialect as he read&mdash;diverse passages, some relating
  to the life of Jesus, and others which were extracts of letters written by
  apostles of his to individuals or churches, to which I listened with
  attention and pleasure. When this was over, Probus rose, standing upon a low
  platform like the rostrums from which our lawyers plead, and first reading a
  sentence from the sayings of Paul, an apostle of Jesus, of which this was the
  substance, 'Jesus came into the world, bringing life and immortality to
  light,' he delivered, with a most winning and persuasive beauty, a discourse,
  or oration, the purpose of which was to show, that Jesus was sent into the
  world to bring to light or make plain the true character and end of the life
  on earth, and also the reality and true nature of a future existence. In
  doing this, he exposed&mdash;but in a manner so full of the most earnest
  humanity that no one could be offended&mdash;the errors of many of the
  philosophers concerning a happy life, and compared with the greatest force
  their requisitions with those of the gospel, 'as he termed his religion;
  showing what unworthy and inadequate conceptions had prevailed as to what
  constitutes a man truly great, and good, and happy. Then he went on to show,
  that it was such a life only as he had described that could make a being like
  man worthy of immortality; that although Jesus had proved the reality of a
  future and immortal existence, yet he had, with even more importunity, and
  earnestness, and frequency, laid down his precepts touching a virtuous life
  on earth. He finally went into the Christian argument in proof of a future
  existence, and exhorted those who heard him, and who desired to inhabit the
  Christian's heaven, to live the life which Christ had brought to light, and
  himself had exemplified on earth, laboring to impress their minds with the
  fact, that it was a superior goodness which made Jesus what he was, and that
  it must be by a similar goodness that his followers could fit themselves for
  the immortality he had revealed. All this was with frequent reference to
  existing opinions and practices, and with large illustrations drawn from
  ancient and modern religious history.</p>

  <p>What struck me most, after having listened to the discourse of Probus to
  the end, was the practical aim and character of the religion he preached. It
  was no fanciful speculation nor airy dream. It was not a plaything of the
  imagination he had been holding up to our contemplation, but a series of
  truths and doctrines bearing with eminent directness, and with a perfect
  adaptation, upon human life, the effect and issue of which, widely and
  cordially received, must be to give birth to a condition of humanity not now
  any where to be found on the earth. I was startled by no confounding and
  overwhelming mysteries; neither my faith nor my reason was burdened or
  offended; but I was shown, as by a light from heaven, how truly the path
  which leads to the possession and enjoyment of a future existence coincides
  with that which conducts to the best happiness of earth. It was a religion
  addressed to the reason and the affections; and evidence enough was afforded
  in the representations given of its more important truths, that it was
  furnished with ample power to convince and exalt the reason, to satisfy and
  fill the affections. No sooner shall I have returned to the leisure of my
  home, to my study and my books, than I shall seriously undertake an
  examination of the Christian argument. It surely becomes those who fill the
  place in the social state which I do, to make up an intelligent judgment upon
  a question like this, so that I may stand prepared to defend it, and urge it
  upon my countrymen, if I am convinced of its truth and of its advantage to my
  country, or assail and oppose it, if I shall determine it to be what it is so
  frequently termed, a pernicious and hateful superstition.</p>

  <p>When the discourse was ended, of the power and various beauty of which I
  cannot pretend properly to acquaint you, another prayer longer and more
  general was offered, to parts of which there were responses by the hearers.
  Then, as a regular part of the service, voluntary offerings and gifts were
  made by those present for the poor. More than once, as a part of the worship,
  hymns were sung to some plain and simple air, in which all the assembly
  joined. Sometimes, to the services which I witnessed, Probus informed me
  there is added a further ceremony, called the 'Lord's supper,' being a social
  service, during which bread and wine are partaken of, in memory of Jesus
  Christ. This was the occasion, in former times, of heavy charges against the
  Christians of rioting and intemperance, and even of more serious crimes. But
  Probus assures me that the last were even then groundless, and that now
  nothing can be more blameless than this simple spiritual repast.</p>

  <p>The worship being ended, and Probus having descended from his seat, I
  accosted him, giving him what I am certain were very sincere thanks for the
  information I had obtained from his oration, concerning the primary articles
  of the Christian faith.</p>

  <p>'It has been,' said he in reply, 'with utmost satisfaction, that I beheld
  a person of your rank and intelligence among my hearers. The change of the
  popular belief throughout the Roman empire, which must come, will be a less
  tumultuous one, in proportion as we can obtain even so much as a hearing from
  those who sit at the head of society in rank and intelligence. Let me make a
  sincere convert of a Roman emperor, and in a few years the temples of
  Paganism would lie even with the ground. Believe me, Christianity has
  penetrated deeper and farther, than you in the seats of power dream of. While
  you are satisfied with things as they are, and are content to live on and
  enjoy the leisure and honors the gods crown you with, the classes below you,
  less absorbed by the things of the world&mdash;because perhaps having fewer
  of them,&mdash;give their thoughts to religion and the prospects which it
  holds out of a happier existence after the present. Having little here, they
  are less tied to the world than others, and more solicitous concerning the
  more and the better, of which Christianity speaks.'</p>

  <p>'I am not insensible,'I replied, 'to the truth of what you say. The
  cruelties, moreover, exercised by the emperors toward the Christians, the
  countless examples of those who have died in torments for the truth of this
  religion, have drawn largely and deeply upon the sympathy of the general
  heart, and disposed it favorably toward belief. In Rome, surrounded by
  ancient associations, embosomed in a family remarkable for its attachment to
  the ancient order of things; friends of power, of letters, and philosophy, I
  hardly was conscious of the existence of such a thing as Christianity. The
  name was never heard where I moved. Portia, my noble mother, with a heart
  beating warm for every thing human, instinctively religious beyond any whom I
  have ever seen or known, of the Christian or any other faith, living but to
  increase the happiness of all around her, was yet&mdash;shall I say
  it?&mdash;a bigot to the institutions of her country. The government and the
  religion under which all the Pisos had lived and flourished, which had
  protected the rights and nursed the virtues of her great husband and his
  family, were good enough for her, for her children, and for all. Her ear was
  closed against the sound of Christianity, as naturally as an adder's against
  all sound. She could not, and never did hear it. From her I received my
  principles and first impressions. Not even the history, nor so much as a word
  of the sufferings, of the Christians ever fell on my ear. I grew up in all
  things a Piso; the true child of my mother, in all save her divine virtues.
  And it was not till a few years since, when I broke loose from domestic and
  Roman life, and travelled to Greece and Egypt, and now to the East, that I
  became practically aware of the existence of such a people as the Christians;
  and my own is, I suppose, but a specimen of the history of my order. I now
  perceive, that while we have slept, truth has been advancing its posts, till
  the very citadel of the world is about to be scaled. The leaven of
  Christianity is cast into the lump, and will work its necessary end. It now,
  I apprehend, will matter but little what part the noble and the learned shall
  take, or even the men in power. The people have taken theirs, and the rest
  must follow, at least submit. Do I over-estimate the inroads of the religion
  upon the mind and heart of the world?'</p>

  <p>'I am persuaded you do not,' replied the Christian. Give me, as I said
  before, one Roman emperor for a convert, and I will insure the immediate and
  final triumph of Christianity. But in the mean time, another Nero, another
  Domitian, another Decius, may arise, and the bloody acts of other
  persecutions stain the annals of our guilty empire.'</p>

  <p>'The gods forbid!' said I; yet who shall say it may not be! Much as I
  honor Aurelian for his many virtues, I feel not sure that in the right hands
  he might not be roused to as dark deeds as any before him&mdash;darker they
  would be&mdash;inasmuch as his nature for sternness and severity has not, I
  think, been equalled. If the mild and just Valerian could be so wrought upon
  by the malignant Macrianus, what security have we in the case of Aurelian? He
  is naturally superstitious.'</p>

  <p>'O that in Aurelian,' said the Christian, 'were lodged the woman's heart
  of Zenobia!&mdash;we then could trust to-morrow as well as enjoy to-day. Here
  no laws seal the lips of the Christian: he may tell his tale to as many as
  choose to hear. I learn, since my arrival, that the Princess Julia is
  favorably inclined toward the Christian cause. Dost thou know what the truth
  may be?'</p>

  <p>'It is certain that she admires greatly the character and the doctrine of
  Christ, and I should think, believes; but she does not as yet openly confess
  herself a follower of the Nazarene. She is perhaps as much a Christian as
  Zenobia is a Jewess.'</p>

  <p>'I may well rejoice in that,' replied the Christian, 'yes, and do.'</p>

  <p>The lights of the apartment were now extinguished, and we parted.</p>

  <p>If I am ever again in Rome, my Curtius, it shall be my care to bring to
  your acquaintance and Lucilia's, the Christian Probus. Farewell!</p>

  <h2><a name="letter10"
     id="letter10">LETTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS I returned from the worship of the Christians to the
house of Gracchus,
  my thoughts wandered from the subjects which had just occupied my mind to the
  condition of the country, and the prospect now growing more and more
  portentous of an immediate rupture with Rome. On my way I passed through
  streets of more than Roman magnificence, exhibiting all the signs of wealth,
  taste, refinement, and luxury. The happy, light-hearted populace were moving
  through them, enjoying at their leisure the calm beauty of the evening, or
  hastening to or from some place of festivity. The earnest tone of
  conversation, the loud laugh, the witty retort, the merry jest, fell upon my
  ear from one and another as I passed along. From the windows of the palaces
  of the merchants and nobles, the rays of innumerable lights streamed across
  my path, giving to the streets almost the brilliancy of day; and the sound of
  music, either of martial instruments, or of the harp accompanied by the
  voice, at every turn arrested my attention, and made me pause to listen.</p>

  <p>A deep melancholy came over me. It seemed to me that the days of this
  people were numbered, and that the gods intending their ruin had first made
  them mad. Their gayety appeared to me no other than madness. They were like
  the gladiators of our circuses, who, doomed to death, pass the last-days of
  life in a delirium of forced and frantic joy. Many of the inhabitants I could
  not but suppose utterly insensible to the dangers which impend&mdash;or
  ignorant of them; but more I believe are cheerful, and even gay, through a
  mad contempt of them. They look back upon their long and uninterrupted
  prosperity&mdash;they call to mind their late glorious achievements under
  Odenatus and their Queen&mdash;they think of the wide extent of their
  empire&mdash;they remember that Longinus is their minister, and Zenobia still
  their Queen&mdash;and give their fears to the winds. A contest with Rome they
  approach as they would the games of the amphitheatre.</p>

  <p>The situation of their city, defended as it is by the wide-stretching
  deserts, is indeed enough of itself to inspire the people with a belief that
  it is impregnable. It requires an effort, I am aware, to admit the likelihood
  of an army from the far west first overcoming the dangers of the desert, and
  then levelling the walls of the city, which seem more like ramparts of
  Nature's making so massy are they, than any work of man. And the Palmyrenes
  have certainly also some excuse in the wretched management of our generals,
  ever since the expedition of Valerian, and in the brilliancy of their own
  achievements, for thinking well of themselves, and anticipating, without much
  apprehension for the issue, a war with us. But these and the like apologies,
  however they may serve for the common people, surely are of no force in their
  application to the intelligent, and such as fill the high places of the
  kingdom. They know that although upon some mere question of honor or of
  boundary, it might be very proper and politic to fight a single battle rather
  than tamely submit to an encroachment, it is quite another thing when the
  only aim of the war is to see which is the stronger of the two&mdash;which is
  to be master. This last, what is it but madness? the madness of pride and
  ambition in the Queen&mdash;in the people the madness of a love and a
  devotion to her, unparalleled since the world began. A blindness as of death
  has seized them all.</p>

  <p>Thinking of these things, and full of saddest forebodings as to the fate
  of this most interesting and polished people, I reached the gate of the
  palace of Gracchus. The inmates, Gracchus and Fausta, I learned from Milo,
  were at the palace of the Queen, whither I was instructed by them to resort
  at the request of Zenobia herself. The chariot of my host soon bore me there.
  It was with pleasure that I greeted this unexpected good fortune. I had not
  even seen the Queen since the day passed at her villa, and I was not a little
  desirous, before the ambassadors should receive their final answer, to have
  one more opportunity of conversing with her.</p>

  <p>The moment I entered the apartment where the Queen was with her guests, I
  perceived that all state was laid aside, and that we were to enjoy each other
  with the same social ease as when in the country, or as on that first evening
  in the gardens of the palace. There was on this occasion no prostration, and
  no slave crouched at her feet; and all the various Persian ceremonial, in
  which this proud woman so delights, was dispensed with. The room in which we
  met was large, and opening on two of its sides upon those lofty Corinthian
  porticos, which add so greatly to the magnificence of this palace. Light was
  so disposed as to shed a soft and moon-like radiance, which, without
  dazzling, perfectly revealed every person and object, even to the minutest
  beauties of the paintings upon the walls, and of the statuary that offered to
  the eye the master-pieces of ancient and modern sculpture. The company was
  scattered; some being seated together in conversation, others observing the
  works of art, others pacing the marble floors of the porticos, their forms
  crossing and recrossing the ample arched door-ways which opened upon
  them.</p>

  <p>'We feared,' said the Queen, advancing toward me as I entered, 'that we
  were not to be so happy as to see you. My other friends have already passed a
  precious hour with me. But every sacrifice to the affections, be it ever so
  slight, is a virtue, and therefore you are still an object of praise, rather
  than of censure.'</p>

  <p>I said in reply that an affair of consequence had detained me, or I should
  have been earlier at the house of Gracchus, so as to have accompanied
  Fausta.</p>

  <p>Fausta, who had been sitting with the Queen, now came forward, Julia
  leaning on her arm, and said, 'And what do you imagine to be the affair of
  consequence that has deprived us of Piso's company?'</p>

  <p>'I cannot tell, indeed,' replied Zenobia.</p>

  <p>'Julia at least,' said Fausta, 'will applaud him, when she hears that he
  has just come from an assembly of Christians. May I ask, Lucius, what new
  truth you have learned with which to enlighten us? But your countenance tells
  me I must not jest. There&mdash;let me smooth that brow and make my peace.
  But in seriousness, I hope your Mediterranean friend rewarded you for the
  hour you have given him, and deprived us of?'</p>

  <p>'I wish,'I could not but reply, 'that but one out of every thousand hours
  of my life had been as well rewarded, and it would not have been so
  worthless. The Princess may believe me when I say that not even the Bishop of
  Antioch could have done better justice to the Christian argument. I have
  heard this evening a Christian of the name of Probus, whose history I
  related&mdash;and which you may remember&mdash;at the tables, within a few
  days after my arrival in Palmyra. He is in opinion a follower of Paul, so I
  am informed, though not&mdash;you Julia will be glad to learn it&mdash;in his
  manner of life. What the differences are which separate the Christians from
  one another in their belief, I know not. I only know that truth cannot take a
  more winning shape than that in which it came from the lips of Probus, and it
  was largely supported by the words of the founder of the religion. I think
  you may justly congratulate your city and your subjects,' I continued
  addressing Zenobia, 'upon the labors and teaching of a man like Probus. The
  sentiments which he utters are such as must tend to the strength of any
  government which relies for its support, in any sense, upon the social and
  personal virtues of the people. In implanting the virtues of justice,
  temperance, and piety, and in binding each heart to every other, by the bonds
  of a love which this religion makes itself almost to consist in, it does all
  that either philosophy or religion can do for the harmony and order of
  society, the safety of governments, and the peace of the world.'</p>

  <p>'You speak with the earnestness of a deep persuasion, Roman,' replied the
  Queen, 'and I shall not forget the name and office of the person whom you
  have now named to me. I hear with pleasure of the arrival of any teacher of
  truth in my kingdom. I have derived so much myself from the influences of
  letters and philosophy, that it is no far-off conclusion for me to arrive at,
  that my people must be proportionally benefited by an easy access to the same
  life- giving fountains. Whatever helps to quicken thought, and create or
  confirm habits of reflection, is so much direct service to the cause of
  humanity. I truly believe that there is no obstacle but ignorance, to prevent
  the world from attaining a felicity and a virtue, such as we now hardly dream
  of&mdash;ignorance respecting the first principles of philosophy and
  religion. Knowledge is not less essential to the increase and elevation of
  virtue, than it is to the further advances of truth, and the detection of
  error. Prove the truth, and mankind will always prefer it to falsehood. So
  too, demonstrate wherein goodness consists, and the road that leads to it,
  and mankind will prefer it to vice. Vice is a mistake, as well as a fault; I
  do not say as often. I fear that the Christian teachers are occupying
  themselves and their disciples too much about mere speculative and fanciful
  distinctions, while they give too little heed to that which alone is of any
  consequence, virtue. In this, Longinus,' turning towards the philosopher, who
  had now joined us, 'I think they affect to imitate the commentators and
  living expositors of the great Plato. I have heard from Paul of Samosata
  accounts of differences among Christians, where the points were quite too
  subtle for my understanding to appreciate. They reminded me of the
  refinements of some of the young adventurers from Athens, who occasionally
  have resorted here for the purpose of elucidating the doctrines of your great
  master&mdash;pseudo-philosophers and tyros, I perceive you are waiting to
  term them. Is it so that you denominate Polemo the Athenian, who as I learn
  is now here with the benevolent design of enlightening my people?'</p>

  <p>'He is a man,' replied Longinus, 'hardly worthy to be named in this
  connection and this presence at all. I have neither met him nor heard him,
  nor do I desire to do so. It is through the mischievous intermeddling of such
  as he that the honorable name and office of philosopher are brought into
  contempt. It requires more intellect than ever enlightens the soul of Polemo,
  to comprehend the lofty truth of Plato. I trust that when it has been my
  pleasure to unfold the sense of that great teacher, it has not been found to
  be either unprofitable, or unintelligible?'</p>

  <p>Zenobia smiled and said, 'I must confess that at times, as I have ever
  frankly stated, my mind has been a little tasked. There has been but an
  approach to a perfect idea. But I do not say that a perfect conception has
  not been presented. So that when this has happened, Longinus being the
  teacher, and Zenobia and Julia the pupils, I cannot doubt that when the task
  is entrusted to less cultivated minds&mdash;the task both of teaching and
  learning&mdash;it must frequently end in what it might be rash to term light
  or knowledge.'</p>

  <p>'I grieve, O Queen,' replied Longinus, smiling in his turn, 'that both you
  and the Princess should have possessed so little affinity for the soul-
  purifying and elevating doctrines of the immortal Plato&mdash;that you,
  Queen, should have even preferred the dark annals of Egyptian and Assyrian
  history and politics, and the Greek learning; and you, Princess, should have
  fixed your affections upon this, not new-found philosophy, but new-invented
  religion, of the Christians. I still anticipate the happiness to lead you
  both into the groves of the academy, and detain you there, where and where
  only are seats that well become you.'</p>

  <p>'But is it not,'I ventured here to suggest, 'some objection to the
  philosophy of Plato as the guide of life, that it requires minds of the very
  highest order to receive it? Philosophy, methinks, should be something of
  such potency, yet at the same time of such simplicity, that it should not so
  much require a lofty and elevated intellect to admit it, as tend, being
  received readily and easily by minds of a humbler order, to raise them up to
  itself. Now this, so far as I understand it, is the character of the
  Christian philosophy&mdash;for philosophy I must think it deservedly called.
  It is admitted into the mind with ease. But once being there, its operation
  is continually to exalt and refine it&mdash;leading it upwards forever to
  some higher point than it has hitherto arrived at. I do not deny an elevating
  power to your philosophy when once an inmate of the soul&mdash;I only assert
  the difficulty of receiving it on the part of the common mind.'</p>

  <p>'And the common mind has nothing to do,' replied the Greek, 'with Plato or
  his wisdom. They are for minds of a higher order. Why should the man who
  makes my sandals and my cloak be at the same time a philosopher? Would he be
  the happier? In my opinion, it would but increase his discontent. Every
  stitch that he set would be accompanied by the reflection, "What a poor
  employment is this for a soul like mine, imbued with the best wisdom of
  Greece," and if this did not make him miserable at his task, it would make
  him contemptible when he should forsake it to do the work of some
  Polemo&mdash;who, it may safely be presumed, has made some such exchange of
  occupation. No. Philosophy is not for the many, but the few. Parts there are
  of it which may descend and become a common inheritance. Other parts there
  are, and it is of these I speak, which may not.'</p>

  <p>'Therein,'I rejoined, 'I discern its inferiority to Christianity, which
  appeals to all and is suited to all, to lowest as well as highest, to highest
  as well as lowest.'</p>

  <p>'But I remember to have been told,' said the Greek in reply, 'that
  Christian teachers too have their mysteries&mdash;their doctrines for the
  common people, and their refinements for the initiated.'</p>

  <p>'I have heard not of it,'I answered; 'if it be so I should lament it. It
  would detract from its value greatly in my judgment.'</p>

  <p>'Where your information fails, Piso, mine perhaps may serve,' said Julia,
  as I paused at fault. 'It is indeed true, as has been hinted by Longinus,
  that some of the Christian doctors, through their weak and mistaken ambition
  to assimilate their faith the nearest possible to the Greek philosophy, have
  magnified the points in which the least resemblance could be traced between
  them; and through the force of a lively imagination have discovered
  resemblances which exist only in their fancies. These they make their boast
  of, as showing that if Platonism be to be esteemed for its most striking
  peculiarities, the very same, or ones nearly corresponding, exist also in
  Christianity. Thus they hope to recommend their faith to the lovers of
  philosophy. Many have by these means been drawn over to it, and have not
  afterward altered any of their modes of life, and scarce any of their
  opinions; still wearing the philosopher's robe and teaching their former
  doctrines, slightly modified by a tincture of Christianity. However the
  motive for such accommodation may be justified, it has already resulted and
  must do so more and more to the corruption and injury of Christianity. This
  religion, or philosophy, whichever it should be called, ought however,'
  continued the Princess, addressing particularly the Greek, 'certainly to be
  judged on its own merits, and not by the conduct or opinions of injudicious,
  weak, or dishonest advocates. You are not willing that Plato should be judged
  by the criticisms of a Polemo, but insist that the student should go to the
  pages of the philosopher himself, or else to some living expositor worthy of
  him. So the Christian may say of christianity. I have been a reader of the
  Christian records, and I can say, that such secret and mysterious doctrines
  as you allude to, are not to be found there. Moreover, I can refer you, for
  the same opinion, to Paul of Antioch&mdash;I wish he were here&mdash;who,
  however he may depart from the simplicity of the Christian life, maintains
  the simplicity of its doctrine.'</p>

  <p>'You have well shown, my fair pupil,' replied the philosopher, 'that the
  imputation upon Christianity, of a secret and interior doctrine for the
  initiated alone, is unjust, but therein have you deprived it of the very
  feature that would commend it to the studious and inquisitive. It may present
  itself as a useful moral guide to the common mind, but scarcely can it hope
  to obtain that enthusiastic homage of souls imbued with the love of letters,
  and of a refined speculation, which binds in such true-hearted devotion every
  follower of Plato to the doctrine of his divine master.'</p>

  <p>At this moment Zabdas and Otho entered the apartment, and drawing near to
  our group to salute the Queen, our conversation was broken off. I took
  occasion, while this ceremony was going through, to turn aside and survey the
  various beauty and magnificence of the room, with its rare works of art. In
  this I was joined by Longinus, who, with a taste and a power which I have
  seen in no other, descanted upon the more remarkable of the pictures and
  statues, not in the manner of a lecturer, but with a fine perception and
  observance of that nice line which separates the learned philosopher from the
  polite man of the world. He was both at once. He never veiled his learning or
  his genius, and yet never, by the display of either, jarred the sensibilities
  of the most refined and cultivated taste.</p>

  <p>When we had in this way passed through the apartment, and were standing
  looking toward where Zenobia sat engaged in earnest conversation with
  Gracchus and Zabdas, Longinus said,</p>

  <p>'Do you observe the restlessness of the Queen, and that flush upon her
  cheek? She is thinking of to-morrow and of the departure of the ambassadors.
  And so too is it with every other here. We speak of other things, but the
  mind dwells but upon one. I trust the Queen will not lose this fair occasion
  to gather once more the opinions of those who most love and honor her. Piso,
  you have seen something of the attachment of this people to their Queen. But
  you know not the one half of the truth. There is not a living man in Palmyra,
  save only Antiochus, who would not lay down his life for Zenobia. I except
  not myself. This attachment is founded in part upon great and admirable
  qualities. But it is to be fully explained only when I name the fascinations
  of a manner and a beauty such as poets have feigned in former ages, but which
  never have been realized till now. I acknowledge it,&mdash;we are slaves
  yoked to her car, and ask no higher felicity or glory.'</p>

  <p>'I wonder not,' said I; 'though a Roman, I have hardly myself escaped the
  common fate; you need not be surprised to see me drawn, by-and-by, within the
  charmed circle, and binding upon my own neck the silken chains and the golden
  yoke. But see, the Queen asks our audience.'</p>

  <p>We accordingly moved toward the seat which Zenobia now occupied,
  surrounded by her friends, some being seated and others standing without
  order around her.</p>

  <p>'Good friends,' she said, 'I believe one thought fills every mind present
  here. Is it not better that we give it utterance? I need the sympathy and the
  counsel of those who love me. But I ask not only for the opinions of those
  who agree with me, but as sincerely for those of such as may differ from me.
  You know me well in this, that I refuse not to hearken to reasons, the
  strongest that can be devised, although they oppose my own settled judgment.
  Upon an occasion like this it would ill become the head of a great empire to
  shut out the slenderest ray of light that from any quarter might be directed
  upon the questions which so deeply interest and agitate us. I believe that
  the great heart of my people goes with me in the resolution I have taken, and
  am supported in by my council; but I am well aware, that minds not inferior
  to any in strength, and hearts that beat not less warmly toward their country
  and toward me than any others, are opposed to that resolution, and anticipate
  nought but disaster and ruin from a conflict with the masters of the world.
  Let us freely open our minds each to other, and let no one fear to offend me,
  but by withholding his full and free opinion.'</p>

  <p>'We who know our Queen so well,' said Gracchus, 'hardly need these
  assurances. Were I as bitterly opposed to the measures proposed as I am
  decidedly in favor of them, I should none the less fearlessly and frankly
  declare the reasons of my dissent. I am sure that every one here experiences
  the freedom you enjoin. But who will need to use it? For are we not of one
  mind? I see indeed one or two who oppose the general sentiment. But for the
  rest, one spirit animates all, and what is more, to the farthest limits of
  the kingdom am I persuaded the same spirit spreads, and possesses and fills
  every soul. The attempt of Aurelian to control us in our affairs, to dictate
  to us concerning the limits of our empire so far removed, is felt to be a
  wanton freak of despotic power, which, if it be not withstood in its first
  encroachment, may proceed to other acts less tolerable still, and which may
  leave us scarcely our name as a distinct people&mdash;and that covered with
  shame. Although a Roman by descent, I advocate not Roman intolerance. I can
  see and denounce injustice in Aurelian as well as in another. Palmyra is my
  country and Zenobia my Queen, and when I seek not their honor, may my own
  fall blasted and ruined. I stand ready to pledge for them in this emergency,
  what every other man of Palmyra holds it his privilege to offer, my property
  and my life, and if I have any possession dearer than these, I am ready to
  bring and lay it upon the same altar.'</p>

  <p>The eyes of Zenobia filled at the generous enthusiasm of her faithful
  counsellor&mdash;and, for Fausta, it was only a look and sign of the Queen
  that held her to her seat.</p>

  <p>Longinus then, as seemed to be his place, entered at length into the
  merits of the question. He did not hesitate to say that at the first outbreak
  of these difficulties he had been in favor of such concessions to the pride
  of Rome as would perhaps have appeased her and cast no indignity upon
  Palmyra. He did not scruple to add that he had deeply disapproved and
  honestly censured that rash act of the young princes in assuming the garb and
  state of Caesars. He would rather leave to Rome her own titles and empire,
  and stand here upon a new and independent footing. It was a mad and useless
  affront, deeply wounding to the pride of Aurelian, and the more rankling as
  it was of the nature of a personal as well as national affront. He withheld
  not blame too from that towering ambition which, as he said, coveted the
  world because the gods had indeed imparted a genius capable to rule the
  world. He had exerted all his powers to moderate and restrain it, by infusing
  a love of other than warlike pursuits. 'But,' said he, 'the gods weave the
  texture of our souls, not ourselves; and the web is too intensely wove and
  drenched in too deep a dye for us to undo or greatly change. The eagle cannot
  be tamed down to the softness of a dove, and no art of the husbandman can
  send into the gnarled and knotted oak the juices that shall smooth and melt
  its stiffness into the yielding pliancy of the willow. I wage no war with the
  work of the gods. Besides, the demands of Rome have now grown to such a size
  that they swallow up our very existence as a free and sovereign state. They
  leave us but this single city and province out of an empire that now
  stretches from the Nile to the Bosphorus&mdash;an empire obtained by what
  cost of blood and treasure I need not say, any more than by what consummate
  skill in that art which boasts the loftiest minds of all ages.' He went on to
  say, that Palmyra owed a duty not only to herself in this matter, but to the
  whole East, and even to the world. For what part of the civilized world had
  not been trampled into dust by the despotism of almighty Rome? It was needful
  to the well-being of nations that some power should boldly stand forth and
  check an insolence that suffered no city nor kingdom to rest in peace. No
  single people ought to obtain universal empire. A powerful nation was the
  more observant of the eternal principles of honor and justice for being
  watched by another, its equal. Individual character needs such supervision,
  and national as much. Palmyra was now an imposing object in the eye of the
  whole world. It was the second power. All he wished was, that for the sake of
  the world's peace, it should retain this position. He deprecated conquest.
  However another might aspire to victory over Aurelian, to new additions from
  the Roman territory, he had no such aspirations. On the other hand, he should
  deplore any success beyond the maintenance of a just and honorable
  independence. This was our right, he said, by inheritance, and as much also
  by conquest, and for this he was ready, with the noble Gracchus, to offer to
  his sovereign his properties, his powers, and his life. 'If my poor life,' he
  closed with saying, 'could prolong by a single year the reign of one who,
  with virtues so eminent and a genius so vast, fills the throne of this fair
  kingdom, I would lay it at her feet with joy, and think it a service well
  done for our own and the world's happiness.'</p>

  <p>No sooner had Longinus ended, than Otho, a man of whom I have more than
  once spoken to you, begged to say a few words.</p>

  <p>'My opinions are well known,' he began with saying, 'and it may be
  needless that I should again, and especially here, declare them, seeing that
  they will jar so rudely with those entertained by you, my friends around me.
  But sure I am, that no one has advocated the cause and the sentiments which
  Zenobia cherishes so fondly, with a truer, deeper affection for her, with a
  sincerer love of her glory, than I rise to oppose them with&mdash;' 'We know
  it, we know it, Otho,' interrupted the Queen. 'Thanks, noble Queen, for the
  fresh assurance of it. It is because I love, that I resist you. It is because
  I glory in your reign, in your renown, in your virtues, that I oppose an
  enterprise that I see with a prophet's vision will tarnish them all. Were I
  your enemy, I could not do better than to repeat the arguments that have just
  fallen from the lips of the head of our councils, set off with every trick of
  eloquence that would send them with a yet more resistless power into the
  minds not only of those who are assembled here, but of those, your subjects,
  wherever over these large dominions they are scattered. To press this war is
  to undermine the foundations of the fairest kingdom the sun shines upon, and
  unseat the most beloved ruler that ever swayed a sceptre over the hearts of a
  devoted people. It can have no other issue. And this is not, O noble Queen,
  to throw discredit upon former achievements, or to express a doubt of powers
  which have received the homage of the world. It is only with open eyes to
  acknowledge what all but the blind must see and confess, the overwhelming
  superiority in power of every kind of the other party. With a feeble man upon
  the Roman throne, and I grant that upon the outskirts of her empire a brave
  and determined opposition might obtain great advantages, and conquer or
  re-conquer provinces and cities, and bring disgrace upon Roman generals. But
  this must be a transitory glory&mdash;the mere shooting of an evening
  star&mdash;ending in deeper gloom. For what is Rome? Is it the commander of a
  legion, or the resident governor of a dependent kingdom, or even Caesar
  himself? And have you dealt with Rome when you have dealt with Balista, or
  Heraclianus, or Probus? Alas! no. Rome still stands omnipotent and secure.
  The lion has been but chafed, and is still a lion, with more than his former
  fury; one hair has been drawn; his teeth, his limbs, his massy weight, his
  untouched energies, remain. Rome has been asleep for thirteen long years. Any
  empire but Rome&mdash;which is immortal&mdash;would have slept the sleep of
  death under the dastardly, besotted Gallienus. But Rome has but slumbered,
  and has now awaked with renovated powers, under the auspices of a man whose
  name alone has carried terror and dismay to the farthest tribes of the German
  forests. Against Aurelian, with all the world at his back! and what can any
  resistance of ours avail? We may gain a single victory&mdash;to that, genius
  and courage are equal, and we possess them in more than even Roman
  measure&mdash;but that very victory may be our undoing, or it will but
  embitter the temper of the enemy, call forth a new display of unexhausted and
  inexhaustible resources, while our very good success itself will have nearly
  annihilated our armies; and what can happen then but ruin, absolute and
  complete? Roman magnanimity may spare our city and our name. But it is more
  likely that Roman vengeance may blot them both out from the map of the world,
  and leave us nought but the fame of our Queen, and the crumbling ruins of
  this once flourishing city, by which to be remembered by posterity.</p>

  <p>'These are not the counsels of fear&mdash;of a tame and cowardly spirit. I
  may rebut that imputation without vanity, by referring to the siege of
  Ctesiphon and the reduction of Egypt. The generous Zabdas will do me
  justice&mdash;nay, you all will&mdash;why am I apprehensive? Bear with me a
  moment more'&mdash;'Say on, say on, noble Otho,' said the Queen, and many
  other voices at the same time.&mdash;'The great Longinus has said,' continued
  he, 'that it is needful that there be one empire at least in the world to
  stand between Rome and universal dominion. I believe it. And that Palmyra may
  be, or continue to be, that kingdom, I counsel peace&mdash;I counsel
  delay&mdash;temporary concession&mdash;negotiation&mdash;any thing but war. A
  Roman emperor lives not forever; and let us once ward off the jealousy of
  Aurelian, by yielding to some of his demands, and resigning pretensions which
  are nothing in reality, but exist as names and shadows only, and long years
  of peace and prosperity may again arise, when our now infant kingdom may
  shoot up into the strong bone and muscle of a more vigorous manhood, and with
  reason assert rights, which now it seems but madness, essential madness, to
  do. Listen, great Queen! to the counsels of a time-worn soldier, whose whole
  soul is bound up in most true-hearted devotion to your greatness and glory. I
  quarrel not with your ambition, or your love of warlike fame. I would only
  direct them to fields where they may pluck fresh laurels, and divert them
  from those where waits&mdash;pardon me, my royal mistress!&mdash;inevitable
  shame.'</p>

  <p>Soon as Otho had given a single sign of pause, Zabdas, like a war-horse,
  sprang upon his feet. 'Were not the words,' said he, 'which we have just
  heard, the words of Otho, I would cry out treason! treason!&mdash;But
  Otho&mdash;is Otho. What nation would ever, O Queen, outgrow its infancy,
  were a policy like this, now descanted upon, to guide its counsels? The
  general who risks nothing can win nothing. And the nation that should wait
  till absolutely sure of victory before unsheathing the sword would never draw
  it, or only in some poor skirmish, where victory would be as disgraceful as
  defeat. Besides, although such a nation were to rise by such victories, if
  victories those may be called won by a thousand over an hundred, who would
  not blush to own himself a citizen of it? Greatness lies not in pounds weight
  of flesh, but in skill, courage, warlike genius, energy, and an indomitable
  will. A great heart will scatter a multitude. The love of freedom, in a few
  brave spirits, overthrows kingdoms. It was not, if I rightly remember,
  numbers by which the Persian hosts were beaten upon the plains of Greece. It
  was there something like three hundred to a million&mdash;the million weighed
  more than the three hundred, yet the three hundred were the heavier. The arm
  of one Spartan fell like a tempest upon the degenerate Persians, crushing its
  thousands at a single sweep. It was a great heart and a trusting spirit that
  made it weigh so against mere human flesh. Are we to wait till Palmyra be as
  multitudinous as Rome, ere we risk a battle? Perhaps Rome will grow as fast
  as Palmyra&mdash;and how long must we then wait? I care not, though Aurelian
  bring half Europe at his back, there sits a throned spirit&mdash;whether of
  earth or not, I cannot tell, but as I think more than half divine&mdash;who
  will drive him back shattered and bleeding, the jest and ridicule of the
  observing world. She who, by the force of pure intellect, has out of this
  speck in the desert made a large empire, who has humbled Persia, and entered
  her capital in triumph, has defeated three Roman armies, and wrested more
  provinces than time will allow me to number, from the firm grasp of the
  self-styled mistress of the world, this more than Semiramis is to be daunted
  forsooth, because a Roman soldier of fortune sends his hirelings here and
  asks of her the surrender of three fourths of her kingdom&mdash;she is to
  kneel and cry him mercy&mdash;and humbly lay at his royal feet the laurels
  won by so much precious blood and treasure. May the sands of the desert bury
  Palmyra and her Queen, sooner than one humiliating word shall pass those
  lips, or one act of concession blast a fame to this hour spotless as the
  snows of Ararat, and bright as the Persian God. Shame upon the man who, after
  the lessons of the past, wants faith in his sovereign. Great Queen, believe
  me, the nation is with you. Palmyra, as one man, will pour out treasure to
  the last and least dust of gold, and blood to the last drop, that you may
  still sit secure upon that throne, and stretch your sceptre over a yet wider
  and undishonored empire.'</p>

  <p>'Let not the Queen,' resumed Otho, as Zabdas ceased, 'let not the Queen
  doubt my faith'&mdash;'I doubt it not, good Otho,' she replied; 'heed not the
  sharp words of the impetuous Zabdas; in his zeal for the art he only loves
  and for his Queen, he has thrust his lance hither and thither at all
  adventures, but as in the sports of the field he means no injury.'</p>

  <p>'Zabdas intends no wrong, I am well assured,' rejoined Otho. 'I would only
  add a word, to show upon what I ground my doubt of good success, should
  Aurelian muster all his strength. It cannot be thought that I have lost my
  faith in the military genius and prowess of either Zenobia or Zabdas, with
  both of whom, side by side, I have fought so many times, and by their conduct
  mounted up to victory. Neither do I doubt the courage of our native
  Palmyrenes, nor their devotion to the interests of their country. They will
  war to the death. But should a second army be to be raised, should the chosen
  troops of the city and its neighboring territories be once cut off, upon whom
  are we then to rely? Where are the auxiliaries whom we can trust? What
  reliance can be placed upon Arabs, the Armenians, the Saracens, the
  Cappadocians, the Syrians? Is our empire so old, and so well moulded into one
  mass, so single in interest and affection, that these scattered
  tribes&mdash;formerly hostile to each other and to us, many, most of them at
  different times subject to Rome&mdash;may be depended upon as our own people?
  Have we legions already drawn from their numbers, disciplined, and accustomed
  to our modes of warfare? Truly, this war with Rome seems to be approached
  much as if it were but some passing show of arms, some holiday pastime. But
  the gods grant that none of my forebodings turn true!'</p>

  <p>The words of the sober-minded and honest Otho found no echo in the bosoms
  of those who heard him, and he ceased, when I believe he would willingly have
  gone on to a closer and sharper opposition. Others followed him, each one
  present eagerly pressing forward to utter, were it but one word, to show his
  loyalty, and his zeal in the service of his Queen.</p>

  <p>When all, or nearly all, had in this manner manifested their attachment
  and declared their opinions, the Queen turned to me, saying, that as I had
  there heard so much of what I could not approve, and perhaps had power to
  disprove, it was right that if I wished I should also express my opinions;
  nay, it would be esteemed as a favor by herself, and she was sure also by all
  her friends, if I would freely impart any knowledge I might possess, by which
  any error might be corrected, or false impressions dissipated.</p>

  <p>Being thus invited, I not unwillingly entered into the questions that had
  been agitated, and with earnestness and sincerity, and with all the power I
  could bring to bear, labored to expose the imminent hazard to the very
  existence of the kingdom, which was run by this rash encounter with the
  countless hosts of Rome. I revealed a true picture of the resources of our
  country, and sketched, as I could so well do in their proper colors, the
  character of the fierce Aurelian; and, in a word, did all that a Roman could
  do for Rome, and a Palmyrene for Palmyra. I remembered what Otho had told me
  of the courtesy and willingness with which any company of genuine Palmyrenes
  would listen to me, and shrank not from any statement however harsh and
  grating to their national vanity, but which seemed to me to convey the
  wholesome truth. It appeared to me indeed too late to work any change in
  minds so pledged already to an adopted opinion, but I resolved to leave
  nothing untried to turn them from a bent that must end in irretrievable ruin.
  I was encouraged too, and urged on to more than a common effort, by the
  imploring countenance of the Princess Julia, who, in that expressive manner,
  begged me to use all frankness and boldness in my communications. Otho had,
  it is true, with great power and unshrinking fidelity, advocated the cause of
  peace, and laid bare the true motives to the war, but still it appeared to me
  that much might be said by a Roman and a stranger, that would carry with it
  more weight than as coming from a citizen, however loved and respected. To
  you, my friend, I need enter into no detail; you will easily imagine what it
  was, as a Roman, I should urge upon such an occasion, and in such a presence.
  I shall always remember with satisfaction, I am sure, whatever the issue of
  this difference may be, my efforts to preserve peace between two nations,
  whose best interests must be advanced not by enmity and war, but by the
  closest alliance of friendly intercourse.</p>

  <p>I was heard with attention and respect, and afterwards with sincerity
  thanked, not only by the opposers of the present measures, but by their
  advocates also; they were glad to know the worst that could be said against
  the cause they had espoused. A brief silence ensued as I ended, and the eyes
  of all were instinctively turned upon Zenobia, the ruling spirit&mdash;the
  maker of the kingdom&mdash;its soul&mdash;its head&mdash;and bright, peerless
  crown.</p>

  <p>'It was my wish,' said Zenobia, answering the general expectation, 'before
  the final decision of the senate and the council, to receive from my friends,
  in social confidence, a full expression of their feelings, their opinions,
  their hopes, and their fears, concerning the present posture of our affairs.
  My wish has been gratified, and I truly thank you all, and not least those my
  friends&mdash;as a philosopher, should I not term them my best
  friends?&mdash;who, with a generous trust in me and in you who are on my
  part, have not shrunk from the duty, always a hard one, of exposing the
  errors and the faults of those they love. After such exposure&mdash;and which
  at more length and with more specification will, I trust, be repeated in the
  hearing of the senate and the council&mdash;it cannot be said that I blindly
  rushed upon danger and ruin, if these await us, or weakly blundered upon a
  wider renown, if that, as I doubt not, is to be the event of the impending
  contest. I would neither gain nor lose, but as the effect of a wise
  calculation and a careful choice of means. Withhold not now your confidence,
  which before you have never refused me. Believe that now, as ever before, I
  discern with a clear eye the path which is to conduct us to a yet higher
  pitch of glory. I have long anticipated the emergency that has arisen. I was
  not so ignorant of the history and character of the Roman people, as to
  suppose that they would suffer an empire like this, founded and governed by a
  woman, to divide long with them the homage of the world. With the death of
  the ignoble son of Valerian, I believed would close our undisputed reign over
  most of these eastern provinces. Had Claudius lived, good as he was, he was
  too Roman in his mould not to have done what Aurelian now attempts. I
  prepared then for the crisis which has come not till now. I am ready now. My
  armies are in complete discipline; the city itself so fortified with every
  art and muniment of war as safely to defy any power that any nation may array
  before its walls. But were this not so; did the embassy of Aurelian take us
  by surprise and unprepared; should a people that respects itself, and would
  win or keep the good opinion of mankind, tamely submit to requisitions like
  these? Are we to dismember our country at the behest of a stranger, of a
  foreigner, and a Roman? Do you feel that without a struggle first for freedom
  and independence, you could sink down into a mean tributary of allingulfing
  Rome, and lose the name of Palmyrene? I see by the most expressive of all
  language, that you would rather die. Happy are you, my friends, that this is
  not your case; you are ready for the enemy; you shall not lose your name or
  your renown; and you shall not die. I and my brave soldiers will at a
  distance breast the coming storm; your ears shall not so much as hear its
  thunder; and at the worst, by the sacrifice of our lives, your and your
  country's life shall be preserved.</p>

  <p>'I am advised to avert this evil by negotiation, by delay. Does any one
  believe that delay on our part will change the time-engendered character of
  Rome? If I cease to oppose, will Rome cease to be ambitious? Will fair words
  turn aside the fierce spirit of Aurelian from his settled purpose? Will
  he&mdash;so truly painted by the Roman Piso&mdash;who looks to build an
  undying name, by bringing back the empire to the bounds that compassed it
  under the great Antonines, let slip the glory for a few cities now in hand,
  and others promised? or for the purple robe humbly pulled from our young
  Caesars' shoulders? Believe it not. The storm that threatens might he so
  warded off perhaps for a day&mdash;a month&mdash;a year&mdash;a
  reign&mdash;but after that it would come, and, in all reasonable calculation,
  with tenfold fury. I would rather meet the danger at its first menace, and
  thereby keep our good name,&mdash;which otherwise should we not sully or
  lose?&mdash;and find it less too than a few years more would make it.</p>

  <p>'I am charged with pride and ambition. The charge is true, and I glory in
  its truth. Who ever achieved any thing great in letters, arts, or arms, who
  was not ambitious? Caesar was not more ambitious than Cicero. It was but in
  another way. All greatness is born of ambition. Let the ambition be a noble
  one, and who shall blame it? I confess I did once aspire to be Queen not only
  of Palmyra, but of the East. That I am. I now aspire to remain so. Is it not
  an honorable ambition? Does it not become a descendant of the Ptolemys and of
  Cleopatra? I am applauded by you all for what I have already done. You would
  not it should have been less. But why pause here? Is so much ambition
  praiseworthy, and more criminal? Is it fixed in nature that the limits of
  this empire should be Egypt on the one hand, the Hellespont and the Euxine on
  the other? Were not Suez and Armenia more natural limits? Or hath empire no
  natural limit, but is broad as the genius that can devise, and the power that
  can win? Rome has the West. Let Palmyra possess the East Not that nature
  prescribes this and no more. The gods prospering, and I swear not that the
  Mediterranean shall hem me in upon the West, or Persia on the East. Longinus
  is right&mdash;I would that the world were mine. I feel within the will and
  the power to bless it, were it so.</p>

  <p>'Are not my people happy? I look upon the past and the present, upon my
  nearer and remoter subjects, and ask nor fear the answer&mdash;whom have I
  wronged? what province have I oppressed? what city pillaged? what region
  drained with taxes? whose life have I unjustly taken, or estates coveted or
  robbed? whose honor have I wantonly assailed? whose rights, though of the
  weakest and poorest, have I trenched upon? I dwell where I would ever dwell,
  in the hearts of my people. It is writ in your faces, that I reign not more
  over you than within you. The foundation of my throne is not more power than
  love. Suppose now, my ambition add another province to our realm? Is it an
  evil? The kingdoms already bound to us by the joint acts of ourself and the
  late royal Odenatus, we found discordant and at war. They are now united and
  at peace. One harmonious whole has grown out of hostile and sundered parts.
  At my hands they receive a common justice and equal benefits. The channels of
  their commerce have I opened, and dug them deep and sure. Prosperity and
  plenty are in all their borders. The streets of our capital bear testimony to
  the distant and various industry which here seeks its market. This is no vain
  boasting&mdash;receive it not so, good friends: it is but truth. He who
  traduces himself, sins with him who traduces another. He who is unjust to
  himself, or less than just, breaks a law as well as he who hurts his
  neighbor. I tell you what I am and what I have done, that your trust for the
  future may not rest upon ignorant grounds. If I am more than just to myself,
  rebuke me. If I have overstepped the modesty that became me, I am open to
  your censure, and will bear it. But I have spoken, that you may know your
  Queen&mdash;not only by her acts, but by her admitted principles. I tell you
  then that I am ambitious&mdash;that I crave dominion, and while I live will
  reign. Sprung from a line of kings, a throne is my natural seat. I love it.
  But I strive too&mdash;you can bear me witness that I do&mdash;that it shall
  be, while I sit upon it, an honored, unpolluted seat. If I can, I will hang a
  yet brighter glory round it.</p>

  <p>'And as to pride&mdash;what if my woman's nature, that nature the gods
  implanted and I have received from royal ancestors, loves the pomp and show
  of power? What if the pride which dwells in all high natures gratifies itself
  in me by planting its feet upon an Indian princess, as its only fitting
  footstool, who'&mdash;Suddenly at this point of her discourse the Queen broke
  off, and advancing from where she stood&mdash;she had risen from her seat in
  the ardor of her address&mdash;greeted with native courtesy and grace the
  Roman ambassadors, who, in company with others of their train, we now saw to
  enter the apartments.</p>

  <p>The company, upon this, again resolved itself into many separate groups,
  and returned to such private topics as each one liked, Zenobia devoting
  herself to Varro and Petronius.</p>

  <p>By and by, at the striking up of music, we moved to another apartment, the
  banqueting hall&mdash;the same Egyptian room in which I had before partaken
  the hospitalities of the Eastern Queen, where tables, set out with the most
  lavish magnificence, and bending beneath the most tempting burdens, awaited
  our approach. A flood of light was poured from the ceiling, and reflected
  back again from the jewelled wine cups and embossed gold of Demetrius.</p>

  <p>But I cannot pretend to describe this sumptuous feast. I will only say,
  that the Queen, seated between the Roman ambassadors, gave the evening to
  them. And what with the frequent cups in which she pledged them, and the
  fascinating charms of her beauty and her conversation, I fear there was but
  little of the Roman in them when they rose to depart. In this more peaceful
  way has Zenobia won provinces and cities, as well as at the head of her
  armies. Farewell.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="letter11"
     id="letter11">LETTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FROM my late letters to Portia, and which without doubt you
have before
  this read, you have learned with certainty, what I am sure the eye of Lucilia
  must before have clearly discerned, my love of the Princess Julia. I have
  there related all that it can import my friends to know. The greatest event
  of my life&mdash;the issues of which, whether they are to crown me with a
  felicity the gods might envy, or plunge me in afflictions divine compassions
  could not assuage&mdash;I have there described with that careful concern for
  your fullest information, touching all that befalls me, by which you will
  bear me testimony I have been actuated during my residence in this Eastern
  capital.</p>

  <p>You will not be surprised to learn that my passion is opposed by the
  Queen. It was in the same apartment of the palace where I first saw this
  wonderful woman, that at a late interview with her, at her command, I was
  enjoined to think no more of an alliance with her house.</p>

  <p>I was, as you may easily imagine, not a little disturbed in anticipation
  of an interview with such a person, on such an occasion. Fausta assured me
  that I might rely upon the Queen's generosity, and could look to receive only
  the most courteous reception, whatever her decision might be on my suit. 'I
  fear greatly for your success,' said she, 'but pray the gods both for your
  and the Princess' sake my fears may not come true. Julia lives in her
  affections&mdash;she cannot like me become part of the world abroad, and
  doubly live in its various action. She loves Zenobia indeed with the truest
  affection, but she has given her heart to you, Lucius, and disappointment
  here would feed upon her very life. She ought not to be denied. She cannot
  bear it. Yet Zenobia, devoured by ambition, and holding so little sympathy
  with human hearts in their mutual loves&mdash;all the world to them&mdash;may
  deny her, nor ever half conceive the misery she will inflict upon a being she
  loves and even reveres. Press your cause, Lucius, with a manly boldness. The
  gods succeed you.'</p>

  <p>The Queen received me graciously, but with a fixed and almost severe
  countenance. She expressed herself obliged to me for the early knowledge of
  what otherwise she had not so much as suspected. 'Living myself,' said she
  'far above any dependence upon love for my happiness, I am not prone to see
  the affection in others. The love which fastens upon objects because they are
  worthy, I can understand and honor. But that mad and blind passion, which
  loves only because it will love, which can render no reason for its existence
  but a hot and capricious fancy, I have had no experience of in my own heart,
  and where I see it I have no feeling for it but one of disapprobation or
  contempt. If it be but the beauty of Julia which has bewitched thy fancy,
  Roman, amuse thyself with a brief tour of pleasure, either to Antioch or
  Alexandria, and other objects will greet thee, and soon drive her from thy
  thoughts.'</p>

  <p>I assured her that my regard was not of this kind; that indeed her
  transcendent beauty had first won me, but that other qualities retained me;
  that the bond which held me was as much friendship as love, and I might say
  as much reverence as friendship.</p>

  <p>'The greater the pity, Roman,' rejoined the Queen in a voice somewhat
  stern, but yet melancholy, 'the greater the pity. In truth, I had hoped thine
  was but the love of the painted image, and might without pain be transferred
  to another, painted but as well. Yet, had I reflected upon the sentiments I
  have heard from thee, I might have judged thee nobler. But, Piso, this must
  not be. Were I to look only to myself and Julia, I might well be pleased with
  a tie that bound us to one whom I have so weighty reasons to respect and
  honor. But to do this I have no right. I am not my own, but the State's.
  Julia is no daughter of mine, but the property of Palmyra. Marriage is one of
  the chief bonds of nations, as of families. Were it not a crime in me, with
  selfish regard to my own or my daughter's pleasure, to bestow her upon a
  private citizen of whatever worth, when, espousing her to some foreign
  prince, a province or a kingdom may be won or saved?'</p>

  <p>'But,'I ventured to remark, 'are the hearts of princes and princesses to
  be bartered away for power or territory? are the affections to be bought and
  sold? Is the question of happiness to be no question in their case?'</p>

  <p>'By no means the principal one. It is not necessarily a sacrifice, but if
  necessary the sacrifice must be made. The world envies the lot of those who
  sit upon thrones. But the seat is not without its thorns. It seems all summer
  with them. But upon whom burst more storms, or charged with redder fury? They
  seem to the unreflecting mind to be the only independent&mdash;while they are
  the slaves of all. The prosperous citizen may link himself and his children
  when and with whom he likes, and none may gainsay him. He has but to look to
  himself and his merest whim. The royal family must go and ask his leave. My
  children are more his than mine. And if it be his pleasure and preference
  that my daughters ally themselves to an Indian or a Roman prince, his will is
  done, not mine&mdash;his is the gain, mine the loss. And were it just that,
  when by joining hands though not hearts two nations could be knit together in
  amity, the royal house should refuse the sacrifice? Roman, I live for
  Palmyra. I have asked of the gods my children, not for my own pleasure, but
  for Palmyra's sake. I should give the lie to my whole life, to every
  sentiment I have harbored since that day I gave myself to the royal Odenatus,
  were I now to bestow upon a private citizen her, through whom we have so long
  looked to ally ourselves by a new and stronger bond to some neighboring
  kingdom. Julia, Roman&mdash;you have seen her, you know her, you can
  appreciate her more than human qualities&mdash;Julia is the destined bride of
  Hormisdas. By her, on Sapor's death, do we hope to bind together by chains
  never to be afterward sundered, Persia and Palmyra, who, then leagued by
  interest and affection, may as one kingdom stand up with the more hope
  against the overwhelming force of Rome. Were I justified to forego this
  advantage for any private reason? Can you doubt, were I not constrained to
  act otherwise, whether I should prefer some nobleman of Palmyra, or thee,
  that so I might ever dwell within the charmed influence of one, from whom to
  part will be like the pang of death?'</p>

  <p>'But the princess,'&mdash;I again urged.</p>

  <p>'That is scarcely a question,' she rejoined. 'She may be a sacrifice; but
  it will be upon her country's altar. How many of our brave soldiers, how many
  of our great officers, with devoted patriotism throw away their lives for
  their country. You will not say that this is done for the paltry recompense,
  which at best scarce shields the body from the icy winds of winter, or the
  scorching rays of summer. And shall not a daughter of the royal house stand
  ready to encounter the hardships of a throne, the dangers of a Persian court,
  and the terrors of a royal husband, especially when by doing so, fierce and
  bloody wars may be staid, and nations brought into closer unity? I know but
  little of Hormisdas; report speaks well of him. But were it much less that I
  know, and were report yet less favorable, it were not enough to turn me from
  my purpose. Palmyra married to Persia, through Julia married to Hormisdas, is
  that upon which I and my people dwell.'</p>

  <p>'Better a thousand times,'I then said, 'to be born to the lot of the
  humblest peasant&mdash;a slave's is no worse.'</p>

  <p>'Upon love's calendar,' said the Queen, 'so it is. But have I not freely
  admitted, Roman, the dependency, nay slavery, of a royal house? It would
  grieve my mother's heart, I need scarce assure thee, were Julia unhappy. But
  grief to me might bring joy to two kingdoms.'</p>

  <p>I then could not but urge the claims of my own family, and that by a more
  powerful and honored one she could not ally herself to Rome; and might not
  national interest be as well promoted by such a bond, as by one with the
  remoter East? I was the friend too of Aurelian, much in his confidence and
  regard.</p>

  <p>Zenobia paused, and was for a few moments buried in thought. A faint smile
  for the first time played over her features as she said in reply, 'I wish for
  your sake and Julia's it could be so. But it is too late. Rome is resolved
  upon the ruin of Palmyra&mdash;she cannot be turned aside. Aurelian for
  worlds would not lose the glory of subduing the East. The greater need of
  haste in seeking a union with Persia. Were Sapor dead to-day, to-morrow an
  embassy should start for Ecbatana. But think not, Piso, I harbor ill will
  toward you, or hold your offer in contempt. A Queen of the East might not
  disdain to join herself to a family, whose ancestors were like yours. That
  Piso who was once the rival, and in power&mdash;not indeed in
  virtue&mdash;the equal of the great Germanicus, and looked, not without show
  of reason, to the seat of Tiberius; and he who so many years and with such
  honor reigned over the city its unequalled governor; and thou the descendant
  and companion of princes&mdash;an alliance with such might well be an object
  of ambition with even crowned heads. And it may well be, seeing the steps by
  which many an emperor of Rome has climbed upon his precarious seat, that the
  coming years may behold thee in the place which Aurelian fills, and, were I
  to pleasure thee in thy request, Julia empress of the world! The vision
  dazzles! But it cannot be. It would be sad recreancy to my most sacred duty
  were I, falling in love with a dream, to forsake a great reality.'</p>

  <p>'I may not then&mdash;'I began.</p>

  <p>'No, Piso, you may not even hope. I have reasoned with you because I honor
  you. But think not that I hesitate or waver. Julia can never be yours. She is
  the daughter of the state, and to a state must be espoused. Seek not
  therefore any more to deepen the place which you hold in her affections.
  Canst thou not be a friend, and leave the lover out? Friendship is a
  sentiment worthy godlike natures, and is the true sweetener of the cup of
  life. Love is at best but a bitter sweet; and when sweetest, it is the
  friendship mingled with it that makes it so. Love, too, wastes away with
  years. Friendship is eternal. It rests upon qualities that are a part of the
  soul. The witchery of the outward image helps not to make it, nor being lost
  as it is with age, can dissolve it. Friendship agrees too with ambition,
  while love is its most dreaded rival. Need I point to Antony? If, Piso, thou
  wouldst live the worthy heir of thy great name; if thou wouldst build for
  thyself a throne in the esteem of mankind, admit friendship, but bar out
  love. And I trust to hear that thou art great in Rome, greater even than
  thine ancestor Galba's adopted son. Aim at even the highest, and the arrow,
  if it reach it not, will hit the nearer. When thou art Caesar, send me an
  embassy. Then perhaps&mdash;'</p>

  <p>She closed with that radiant smile that subdues all to her will, her
  manner at the same time giving me to understand that the conversation was
  ended, her own sentence being left playfully unfinished.</p>

  <p>I urged not many things which you may well suppose it came into my mind to
  do, for I neither wished, nor did I feel as if I had a right, at an hour of
  so much public inquietude, to say aught to add to the burden already weighing
  upon her. Besides, it occurred to me, that when within so short a time great
  public changes may take place, and the relations of parties be so essentially
  altered, it was not worth while to give utterance to sentiments, which the
  lapse of a brief period might show to have been unnecessary and unwise. I may
  also add that the presence of this great woman is so imposing; she seems, in
  the very nature and form the gods have given her, to move so far above the
  rest of her kind, that I found it impossible both to say much of what I had
  intended to say, and to express what I did say with the ease and propriety
  which are common to me on ordinary or other extraordinary occasions. They are
  few, I believe, who possess themselves fully in her presence. Even Longinus
  confesses a constraint.</p>

  <p>'It is even as I apprehended,' said Fausta, as I communicated to her the
  result of my interview with the Queen. 'I know her heart to have been set
  upon a foreign alliance by marriage with Julia, and that she has been looking
  forward with impatience to the time when her daughters should be of an age to
  add in this way new strength to the kingdom. I rather hoped than had faith,
  that she would listen to your proposals. I thought that perhaps the
  earnestness of the princess, with the Queen's strong affection for her,
  together with the weight of your family and name, might prevail. But then I
  have asked myself, if it were reasonable to indulge such a hope. The Queen is
  right in stating as she did her dependence, in some sort, upon the people. It
  is they, as well as she, who are looking forward to this Persian marriage. I
  know not what discontents would break out were Hormisdas postponed to
  Piso&mdash;Persia to Rome. My position, Lucius, I think a sadder one than
  Zenobia's. I love Julia as dearly as Zenobia, and you a great deal more than
  Zenobia does, and would fain see you happy; and yet I love Palmyra I dare not
  say how much&mdash;nor that, if by such an act good might come to my country,
  I could almost wish that Julia should live in Persia.'</p>

  <p>I have within me a better ground of hope than is guessed either by the
  Queen or Fausta, but yet can name it not. I mention this to you, and pass to
  other things.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The city has to-day been greatly moved, owing to the
expected audience of
  our ambassadors before the council, and their final answer. The streets are
  thronged with multitudes not engaged in the active affairs of traffic, but
  standing in larger or smaller crowds talking, and hearing or telling news, as
  it arrives from the palace or from abroad.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The die is cast The ambassadors are dismissed. The decision
of the council
  has been confirmed by the senate, and Varro and Petronius have with their
  train departed from the city. War therefore is begun. For it was the distinct
  language of the embassy, that no other terms need be proposed, nor would be
  accepted, beside those offered by them. None others have been offered on the
  part of Palmyra. And the ambassadors have been delayed rather to avoid the
  charge of unreasonable precipitancy, than in the belief that the public mind
  would incline to or permit any reply more moderate than that which they have
  borne back to the emperor.</p>

  <p>It is understood that Aurelian, with an army perfectly equipped, stands
  waiting, ready to start for Asia on the arrival of the ambassadors or their
  couriers. From your last letters I gather as much. How, again I ask&mdash;as
  I have often asked both myself and the principal persons here&mdash;how is it
  possible there should be but one issue to this contest? Yet from language
  which I heard in the senate, as well as in the private apartments of the
  Queen, there is a mad confidence, that after a battle or two on the outskirts
  of the kingdom, in which they shall conquer as always heretofore, an
  advantageous peace will end the contest. In the senate, scarce a voice was
  raised for concession; its mere mention was enough to bring down the most
  bitter charges of a want of patriotism, a Roman leaning, a sordid regard to
  the interests of commerce over those of honor, a poor and low-minded spirit.
  Such as had courage to lift up a warning voice were soon silenced by the
  universal clamor of the opposite party; and although the war was opposed by
  some of the ablest men in the kingdom, men inferior to none of those who have
  come more especially within my notice, and whom I have named to you, yet it
  is termed a unanimous decision, and so will be reported at Rome.</p>

  <p>The simple truth is however that, with the exception of these very few,
  there is no independent judgment in Palmyra, on great national questions. The
  Queen is all in all. She is queen, council and senate. Here are the forms of
  a republican deliberation, with the reality of a despotic will. Not that
  Zenobia is a despotic prince, in any bad sense of the term, but being of so
  exalted a character, ruling with such equity and wisdom; moreover having
  created the kingdom by her own unrivalled energies and genius, it has become
  the habit of the people to defer to her in all things; their confidence and
  love are so deep and fervent, that they have no will nor power now, I
  believe, to oppose her in any measure she might propose. The city and country
  of Palmyra proper are her property in as real a sense as my five hundred
  slaves, on my Tiburtine farm, are mine. Nor is it very much otherwise with
  many of the nearer allied provinces. The same enthusiasm pervades them. Her
  watchfulness over their interests, her impartiality, her personal oversight
  of them by means of the frequent passages she makes among them, have all
  contributed to knit them to her by the closest ties. With the more remote
  portions of the empire it is very different, and it would require the
  operation of but slight causes to divide from their allegiance Egypt,
  Armenia, and the provinces of Asia Minor.</p>

  <p>How is not this rashness, this folly, to be deplored! Could the early
  counsels of Longinus have been but heeded, all had been well. But he is now
  as much devoted to the will and interests of Zenobia as any in the kingdom,
  and lends all the energies of his great mind to the promotion of her cause.
  He said truly, that he like others is but a slave yoked to her car. His
  opinion now is, that no concessions would avail to preserve the independent
  existence of Palmyra. The question lies between war and a voluntary descent
  to the condition of a Roman province. Nothing less than that will satisfy the
  ambition and the pride of Rome. The first step may be such as that proposed
  by Varro&mdash;the lopping off of the late conquered provinces, leaving
  Zenobia the city, the circumjacent territory, and Syria. But a second step
  would soon follow the first, and the foot of Aurelian would plant itself upon
  the neck of Zenobia herself. This he felt assured of, both from observation
  upon the Roman character and history, upon the personal character of
  Aurelian, and from private advices from Rome. He is now accordingly the
  moving spirit of the enterprise, going with all his heart and mind into every
  measure of the Queen.</p>

  <p>I am just returned from a singular adventure. My hand trembles as I write.
  I had laid down my pen and gone forth upon my Arab, accompanied by Milo, to
  refresh and invigorate my frame after our late carousal&mdash;shall I term
  it?&mdash;at the palace. I took my way, as I often do, to the Long Portico,
  that I might again look upon its faultless beauty and watch the changing
  crowds. Turning from that, I then amused my vacant mind by posting myself
  where I could overlook, as if I were indeed the builder or superintendent,
  the laborers upon the column of Aurelian. I became at length particularly
  interested in the efforts of a huge elephant, who was employed in dragging up
  to the foundations of the column, so that they might he fastened to machines
  to be then hoisted to their place, enormous blocks of marble. He was a noble
  animal, and, as it seemed to me, of far more than common size and strength.
  Yet did not his utmost endeavors appear to satisfy the demands of those who
  drove him, and who plied without mercy the barbed scourges which they bore.
  His temper at length gave way. He was chained to a mass of rock, which it was
  evidently beyond his power to move. It required the united strength of two at
  least. But this was nothing to his inhuman masters. They ceased not to urge
  him with cries and blows. One of them at length, transported by that insane
  fury which seizes the vulgar when their will is not done by the brute
  creation, laid hold upon a long lance, terminated with a sharp iron goad,
  long as my sword, and rushing upon the beast, drove it into his hinder part.
  At that very moment the chariot of the Queen, containing Zenobia herself,
  Julia, and the other princesses, came suddenly against the column, on its way
  to the palace. I made every possible sign to the charioteer to turn and fly.
  But it was too late. The infuriated monster snapped the chains that held him
  to the stone, at a single bound, as the iron entered him, and trampling to
  death one of his drivers, dashed forward to wreak his vengeance upon the
  first object that should come in his way. That, to the universal terror and
  distraction of the now scattered and flying crowds, was the chariot of the
  Queen. Her mounted guards, at the first onset of the maddened animal, putting
  their horses to their speed, by quick leaps escaped. The horses attached to
  the chariot, springing forward to do the same, urged by the lash of the
  charioteer, were met by the elephant with straightened trunk and tail, who,
  in the twinkling of an eye, wreathed his proboscis round the neck of the
  first he encountered, and wrenching him from his harness, whirled him aloft
  and dashed him to the ground. This I saw was the moment to save the life of
  the Queen, if it was indeed to be saved. Snatching from a flying soldier his
  long spear, and knowing well the temper of my horse, I ran upon the monster
  as he disengaged his trunk from the crushed and dying Arabian for a new
  assault, and drove it with unerring aim into his eye, and through that
  opening on into the brain. He fell as if a bolt from heaven had struck him.
  The terrified and struggling horses of the chariot were secured by the now
  returning crowds, and the Queen and the princesses relieved from the peril
  which was so imminent, and had blanched with terror every cheek but
  Zenobia's. She had stood the while, I was told&mdash;there being no exertion
  which she could make&mdash;watching with eager and intense gaze my movements,
  upon which she felt that their safety, perhaps their lives, depended.</p>

  <p>It all passed in a moment. Soon as I drew out my spear from the dying
  animal, the air was rent with the shouts of the surrounding populace. Surely,
  at that moment I was the greatest, at least the most fortunate, man in
  Palmyra. These approving shouts, but still more the few words uttered by
  Zenobia and Julia, were more than recompense enough for the small service I
  had performed; especially, however, the invitation of the Queen:</p>

  <p>'But come, noble Piso, leave not the work half done; we need now a
  protector for the remainder of the way. Ascend, if you will do us such
  pleasure, and join us to the palace.'</p>

  <p>I needed no repeated urging, but taking the offered seat&mdash;whereupon
  new acclamations went up from the now augmented throngs&mdash;I was driven,
  as I conceived, in a sort of triumph to the palace, where passing an hour,
  which it seems to me held more than all the rest of my life, I have now
  returned to my apartment, and relate what has happened for your
  entertainment. You will not wonder that for many reasons my hand trembles,
  and my letters are not formed with their accustomed exactness.</p>

  <p>Again I am interrupted. What can be the meaning of the noise and running
  to and fro which I hear? Some one with a quick, light foot approaches.</p>

  <p>It is now night. The palace is asleep, but I take again my pen to tell you
  of the accomplishment of the dear object for which I have wandered to this
  distant spot. Calpurnius is arrived!</p>

  <p>The quick, light foot by which I was disturbed was Fausta's. I knew it,
  and sprang to the door. She met me with her bright and glowing countenance
  bursting with expression. 'Calpurnius!' said she, 'your brother! is
  here'&mdash;and seizing my hand drew me to the apartment where he sat by the
  side of Gracchus; Isaac, with his inseparable pack, standing near.</p>

  <p>I need not, as I cannot, describe our meeting. It was the meeting of
  brothers&mdash;yet of strangers&mdash;and a confusion of wonder, curiosity,
  vague expectation, and doubt, possessed the soul of each. I trust and
  believe, that notwithstanding the different political bias which sways each,
  the ancient ties which bound us together as brothers will again unite us. The
  countenance of Calpurnius, though dark and almost stern in its general
  expression, yet unbends and relaxes frequently and suddenly, in a manner that
  impresses you forcibly with an inward humanity as the presiding though often
  concealed quality of his nature. I can trace faintly the features which have
  been stamped upon my memory&mdash;and the form too&mdash;chiefly by the
  recollected scene of that bright morning, when he with our elder brother and
  venerable parent gave me each a last embrace, as they started for the tents
  of Valerian. A warmer climate has deepened the olive of his complexion, and
  at the same time added brilliancy to an eye by nature soft as a woman's. His
  Persian dress increases greatly the effect of his rare beauty, yet I heartily
  wish it off, as it contributes more I believe than the lapse of so many years
  to separate us. He will not seem and feel as a brother till he returns to the
  costume of his native land. How great this power of mere dress is upon our
  affections and our regard, you can yourself bear witness, when those who
  parted from you to travel in foreign countries have returned metamorphosed
  into Greeks, Egyptians, or Persians, according to the fashions that have
  struck their foolish fancies. The assumed and foreign air chills the
  untravelled heart as it greets them. They are no longer the same. However the
  reason may strive to overcome what seems the mere prejudice of a wayward
  nature, we strive in vain&mdash;nature will be uppermost&mdash;and many, many
  times have I seen the former friend-ships break away and perish.</p>

  <p>I could not but be alive to the general justness of the comparison
  instituted by Isaac, between Calpurnius and Julia. There are many points of
  resemblance. The very same likeness in kind that we so often observe between
  a brother and sister&mdash;such as we have often remarked in our nephew and
  niece, Drusus and Lavinia&mdash;whose dress being changed, and they are
  changed.</p>

  <p>No sooner had I greeted and welcomed my brother, than I turned to Isaac
  and saluted him, I am persuaded, with scarcely less cordiality.</p>

  <p>'I sincerely bless the gods,' said I, 'that you have escaped the perils of
  two such passages through the desert, and are safe in Palmyra. May every wish
  of your heart, concerning your beloved Jerusalem, be accomplished. In the
  keeping of Demetrius will you find not only the single talent agreed upon in
  case you returned, but the two which were to be paid had you perished. One
  such tempest upon the desert, escaped, is more and worse than death itself
  met softly upon one's bed.'</p>

  <p>'Now, Jehovah be praised,' ejaculated Isaac, 'who himself has moved thy
  heart to this grace! Israel will feel this bounty through every limb, it will
  be to her as the oil of life.'</p>

  <p>'And my debt,' said Calpurnius, 'is greater yet, and should in reason be
  more largely paid. Through the hands of Demetrius I will discharge it.'</p>

  <p>'We are all bound to you,' said Fausta, 'more than words can tell or money
  pay.'</p>

  <p>'You owe more than you are perhaps aware of to the rhetoric of Isaac,'
  added Calpurnius. 'Had it not been for the faithful zeal and cunning of your
  messenger in his arguments not less than his contrivances, I had hardly now
  been sitting within the walls of Palmyra.'</p>

  <p>'But then again, noble Roman,' said Isaac, 'to be honest, I ought to say
  what I said not&mdash;for it had not then occurred&mdash;in my letter to thy
  brother, how by my indiscretion I had nearly brought upon myself the wrath,
  even unto death, of a foul Persian mob, and so sealed thy fate together with
  my own. Ye have heard doubtless of Manes the Persian, who deems himself some
  great one, and sent of God? It was noised abroad ere I left Palmyra, that for
  failing in a much boasted attempt to work a cure by miracle upon the Prince
  Hormisdas, he had been strangled by order of Sapor. Had he done so, his love
  of death- doing had at length fallen upon a proper object, a true child of
  Satan. But as I can testify, his end was not such, and is not yet. He still
  walks the earth, poisoning the air he breathes, and deluding the souls of
  men. Him I encountered one day, the very day I had despatched thy letter, in
  the streets of Ecbatana, dogged at the heels by his twelve ragged apostles,
  dragging along their thin and bloodless limbs, that seemed each step ready to
  give way beneath the weight, little as it was, they had to bear. Their
  master, puffed up with the pride of a reformer, as forsooth he holds himself,
  stalked by at their head, drawing the admiration of the besotted people by
  his great show of sanctity, and the wise saws which every now and then he let
  drop for the edification of such as heard. Some of these sayings fell upon my
  ear, and who was I, to hear them and not speak? Ye may know that this false
  prophet has made it his aim to bring into one the Magian and Christian
  superstitions, so that by such incongruous and deadly mixture he might feed
  the disciples of those two widely sundered religions, retaining, as he
  foolishly hoped, enough of the faith of each to satisfy all who should
  receive the compound. In doing this he hath cast dirt upon the religion of
  the Jew, blasphemously teaching that our sacred books are the work of the
  author of evil, while those of Christ are by the author of good. With more
  zeal, it must be confessed, than wisdom, seeing where I was and why I was
  there, I resisted this father of lies, and withstood him to his face. 'Who
  art thou, bold blasphemer,'I said, 'that takest away the Godhead, breaking
  into twain that which is infinite and indivisible? Who art thou to tread into
  the dust the faith of Abraham, and Moses, and the prophets, imputing their
  words, uttered by the spirit of Jehovah, to the great enemy of mankind? I
  wonder, people of Ecbatana, that the thunders of God sleep, and strike him
  not to the earth as a rebel&mdash;nay, that the earth cleaveth not beneath
  him and swalloweth him not up, as once before the rebels Korah, Dathan, and
  Abiram;' and much more in the same mad way, till while I was yet speaking,
  those lean and hungry followers of his set upon me with violence, crying out
  against me as a Jew, and stirring up the people, who were nothing unwilling,
  but fell upon me, and throwing me down, dragged me to a gate of the city, and
  casting me out as I had been a dead dog, returned themselves like dogs to
  their vomit&mdash;that accursed dish of Manichean garbage. I believed myself
  for a long while surely dead; and in my half conscious state took shame to
  myself, as I was bound to do, for meddling in the affairs of Pagan
  misbelievers&mdash;putting thy safety at risk. Through the compassion of an
  Arab woman dwelling without the walls, I was restored and healed&mdash;for
  whose sake I shall ever bless the Ishmaelite. I doubt not, Roman, while I lay
  at the hut of that good woman, thou thoughtest me a false man?'</p>

  <p>'I could not but think so,' said Calpurnius, 'and after the strong desire
  of escape which you had at length kindled, I assure you I heaped curses upon
  you in no stinted measure.'</p>

  <p>'But all has ended well and so all is well,' said Fausta, 'and it was
  perhaps too much to expect, Isaac, that you should stand quietly by and hear
  the religion of your fathers traduced. You are well rewarded for what you did
  and suffered, by the light in which your tribe will now regard you, as an
  almost-martyr, and owing to no want of will, or endeavor on your part, that
  almost did not end in quite. Hannibal, good Isaac, will now see to your
  entertainment.'</p>

  <p>'One word if it please you,' said Isaac, 'before I depart. The gentile
  despises the Jew. He charges upon him usury and extortion. He accuses him of
  avarice. He believes him to subsist upon the very life blood of whomsoever he
  can draw into his meshes. I have known those who have firm faith that the Jew
  feeds but upon the flesh and blood of Pagan and Christian infants, whom, by
  necromantic power, he beguiles from their homes. He is held as the common
  enemy of man, a universal robber, whom all are bound to hate and oppress.
  Reward me now with your belief, better than even the two gold talents I have
  earned, that all are not such. This is the charity, and all that I would beg;
  and I beg it of you, for that I love you all, and would have your esteem.
  Believe that in the Jew there is a heart of flesh as well as in a dog.
  Believe that some noble ambition visits his mind as well as yours. Credit it
  not&mdash;it is against nature&mdash;that any tribe of man is what you make
  the Jew. Look upon me, and behold the emblem of my tribe. What do you see? A
  man bent with years and toil; this ragged tunic his richest garb; his face
  worn with the storms of all climates; a wanderer over the earth; my
  home&mdash;Piso, thou hast seen it&mdash;a single room, with my good
  dromedary's furniture for my bed at night, and my seat by day; this pack my
  only apparent wealth. Yet here have I now received two gold talents of
  Jerusalem!&mdash;what most would say were wealth enough, and this is not the
  tythe of that which I possess. What then? Is it for that I love obscurity,
  slavery, and a beggar's raiment, that I live and labor thus, when my wealth
  would raise me to a prince's state? Or is it that I love to sit and count my
  hoarded gains? Good friends, for such you are, believe it not. You have found
  me faithful and true to my engagements; believe my word also. You have heard
  of Jerusalem, once the chief city of the East, where stood the great temple
  of our faith, and which was the very heart of our nation, and you know how it
  was beleaguered by the Romans, and its very foundations rooted up, and her
  inhabitants driven abroad as outcasts, to wander over the face of the earth,
  with every where a country, but no where a home. And does the Jew, think you,
  sit down quietly under these wrongs? Trajan's reign may answer that. Is there
  no patriotism yet alive in the bosom of a Jew? Will every other toil and die
  for his country and not the Jew? Believe me again, the prayers which go up
  morning, noon and night, for the restoration of Jerusalem, are not fewer than
  those which go up for Rome or Palmyra. And their deeds are not less; for
  every prayer there are two acts. It is for Jerusalem! that you behold me thus
  in rags, and yet rich. It is for her glory that I am the servant of all and
  the scorn of all, that I am now pinched by the winters of Byzantium, now
  scorched by the heats of Asia, and buried beneath the sands of the desert.
  All that I have and am is for Jerusalem. And in telling you of myself, I have
  told you of my tribe. What we do and are is not for ourselves, but for oar
  country. Friends, the hour of our redemption draweth nigh. The Messiah treads
  in the steps of Zenobia! and when the East shall behold the disasters of
  Aurelian&mdash;as it will&mdash;it will behold the restoration of that
  empire, which is destined in the lapse of ages to gather to itself the glory
  and dominion of the whole earth.'</p>

  <p>Saying these words, during which he seemed no longer Isaac the Jew, but
  the very Prince of the Captivity himself, he turned and took his
  departure.</p>

  <p>Long and earnest conversation now ensued, in which we received from
  Calpurnius the most exact accounts of his whole manner of life during his
  captivity; of his early sufferings and disgraces, and his late honors and
  elevation; and gave in return similar details concerning the history of our
  family and of Rome, during the same period of time. I will not pretend to set
  down the narrative of Calpurnius. It was delivered with a grace which I can
  by no means transfer to these pages. I trust you may one day hear it from his
  own lips. Neither can I tell you how beautiful it was to see Fausta hanging
  upon his words, with a devotion that made her insensible to all
  else&mdash;her varying color and changing expression showing how deeply she
  sympathized with the narrator. When he had ended, and we had become weary of
  the excitement of this first interview, Fausta proposed that we should
  separate to meet again at supper. To this we agreed.</p>

  <p>According to the proposal of Fausta, we were again, soon as evening had
  come, assembled around the table of the princely Gracchus.</p>

  <p>When we had partaken of the luxuries of the feast, and various lighter
  discourse had caused the time to pass by in an agreeable manner, I said thus,
  turning to my brother:</p>

  <p>'I would, Calpurnius, that the temper of one's mind could as easily be
  changed as one's garments. You now seem to me, having put off your Persian
  robes, far more like Piso than before. Your dress, though but in part Roman
  and part Palmyrene, still brings you nearer. Were it wholly Roman it were
  better. Is nothing of the Persian really put off, and nothing of the Roman
  put on, by this change?'</p>

  <p>'Whatever of the Persian there was about me,' replied Calpurnius, 'I am
  free to say I have laid aside with my Persian attire. I was a Persian not by
  choice and preference, I need scarcely assure you, but by a sort of
  necessity, just as it was with my costume. I could not procure Roman clothes
  if I would. I could not help too putting off the Roman&mdash;seeing how I was
  dealt by&mdash;and putting on the Persian. Yet I part with whatever of the
  Persian has cleaved to me without reluctance&mdash;would it were so that I
  could again assume the Roman&mdash;but that can never be. But Isaac has
  already told you all.'</p>

  <p>'Isaac has indeed informed me in his letter from Ecbatana, that you had
  renounced your country, and that it was the expectation of war with Rome that
  alone had power to draw you from your captivity. But I have not believed that
  you would stand by that determination. The days of republican patriotism I
  know are passed, but even now under the empire our country has claims and her
  children owe her duties.'</p>

  <p>'The figure is a common one,' Calpurnius answered, 'by which our country
  is termed a parent, and we her children. Allow it just. Do I owe obedience to
  an unjust or tyrannical parent? to one who has abandoned me in helplessness
  or exposed me in infancy? Are not the natural ties then sundered?'</p>

  <p>'I think not,'I replied; 'no provocation nor injury can justify a
  parricidal blow. Our parent is our creator&mdash;in some sense a God to us.
  The tie that binds us to him is like no other tie; to do it violence, is not
  only a wrong, but an impiety.'</p>

  <p>'I cannot think so,' he rejoined. 'A parent is our creator, not so much
  for our good as his own pleasure. In the case of the gods this is reversed:
  they have given us being for our advantage, not theirs. We lie under
  obligation to a parent then, only as he fulfils the proper duties of one.
  When he ceases to be virtuous, the child must cease to respect. When he
  ceases to be just, or careful, or kind, the child must cease to love. And
  from whomsoever else then the child receives the treatment, becoming a
  parent, that person is to him the true parent. It is idle to be governed by
  names rather than things; it is more, it is mischievous and injurious.'</p>

  <p>'I still am of opinion,'I replied, 'that nature has ordained what I have
  asserted to be an everlasting and universal truth, by the instincts which she
  has implanted. All men, of all tribes, have united in expressions of horror
  against him who does violence to his parents. And have not the poets truly
  painted, when they have set before us the parricide, forever after the guilty
  act, pursued by the Furies, and delivered over to their judicial
  torments?'</p>

  <p>'All instincts,' he replied, 'are not to be defended: some animals devour
  their own young as soon as born. Vice is instinctive. If it be instinctive to
  honor, and love, and obey a vicious parent, to be unresisting under the most
  galling oppression, then I say, the sooner reason usurps the place of
  instinct the safer for mankind. No error can be more gross or hurtful, than
  to respect vice because of the person in whom it is embodied, even though
  that person be a parent. Vice is vice, injustice is injustice, wrong is
  wrong, wheresoever they are found; and are to be detested and withstood. But
  I might admit that I am in an error here; and still maintain my cause by
  denying the justice of the figure by which our country is made our parent,
  and our obligations to her made to rest on the same ground. It is mere fancy,
  it is a nullity, unless it be true, as I think it is, that it has been the
  source of great mischiefs to the world, in which case it cannot be termed a
  nullity, but something positively pernicious. What age of the world can be
  named when an insane devotion to one's country has not been the mother of war
  upon war, evil upon evil, beyond the power of memory to recount? Patriotism,
  standing for this instinctive slavery of the will, has cursed as much as it
  has blessed mankind. Men have not reasoned, they have only felt: they have
  not inquired, is the cause of my country just&mdash;but is it her cause? That
  has ever been the cry in Rome. "Our country! our country!&mdash;right or
  wrong&mdash;our country!" It is a maxim good for conquest and despotism; bad,
  for peace and justice. It has made Rome mistress of the world, and at the
  same time the scourge of the world, and trodden down into their own
  blood-stained soil the people of many a clime, who had else dwelt in freedom.
  I am no Roman in this sense, and ought never to have been. Admit that I am
  not justified in raising my hand against the life of a parent&mdash;though if
  I could defend myself against violence no otherwise, I should raise that
  hand&mdash;I will never allow that I am to approve and second with my best
  blood all the acts of my country; but when she errs am bound, on the other
  hand, to blame, and if need be oppose. Why not? What is this country? Men
  like myself. Who enact the decrees by which I am to be thus bound? Senators,
  no more profoundly wise perhaps, and no more irreproachably virtuous, than
  myself. And do I owe their judgments, which I esteem false, a dearer
  allegiance than I do to my own, which I esteem right and true? Never: such
  patriotism is a degradation and a vice. Rome, Lucius, I think to have dealt
  by me and the miserable men who, with me, fell into the hands of Sapor, after
  the manner of a selfish, cold-hearted, unnatural parent, and I renounce her,
  and all allegiance to her. I am from this hour a Palmyrene, Zenobia is my
  mother, Palmyra my country.'</p>

  <p>'But,'I could not but still urge, 'should no distinction be made between
  your country and her emperor? Is the country to rest under the imputation
  which is justly perhaps cast upon him? That were hardly right. To renounce
  Gallienus, were he now emperor, were a defensible act: But why Rome or
  Aurelian?'</p>

  <p>'I freely grant, that had a just emperor been put upon the throne, a man
  with human feelings, the people, had he projected our rescue or revenge,
  would have gone with him. But how is their conduct to be defended during the
  long reign of the son of Valerian? Was such a people as the people of Rome to
  conform their minds and acts to a monster like him? Was that the part of a
  great nation? Is it credible that the senate and the people together, had no
  power to compel Gallienus to the performance of his duties to his own father,
  and the brave legions who fell with him? Alas! they too wanted the will.'</p>

  <p>'O not so, Calpurnius,'I rejoined; 'Gallienus wished the death or
  captivity of his father, that he might reign. To release him was the last act
  that wretch could have been urged to do. And could he then have been made to
  interpose for the others? He might have been assassinated, but all the power
  of Rome could not have compelled him to a war, the issue of which might have
  been, by the rescue of Valerian, to lose him his throne.'</p>

  <p>'Then he should have been assassinated. Rome owed herself a greater duty
  than allegiance to a beast in human form.'</p>

  <p>'But, Galpurnius, you now enjoy your liberty. Why consider so curiously
  whence it comes? Besides, you have, while in Persia, dwelt in comfort, and at
  last even in magnificence. The Prince himself has been your companion and
  friend.'</p>

  <p>'What was it,' he replied, 'what was it, when I reflected upon myself, but
  so much deeper degradation, to find that in spite of myself I was every day
  sinking deeper and deeper in Persian effeminacy? What was it but the worst
  wretchedness of all to feel as I did, that I, a Roman and a Piso, was losing
  my nature as I had lost my country? If any thing served to turn my blood into
  one hot current of bitterness and revenge, it was this. It will never cool
  till I find myself, sword in hand, under the banners of Zenobia. Urge me no
  more: it were as hopeful an endeavor to stem the current of the Euphrates, as
  to turn me from my purpose. I have reasoned with you because you are a
  brother, not because you are a Roman.'</p>

  <p>'And I,'I replied, 'can still love you, because you are a brother, nor
  less because you are also a Palmyrene. I greet you as the head of our house,
  the elder heir of an illustrious name. I still will hope, that when these
  troubles cease, Rome may claim you as her own.'</p>

  <p>'No emperor,' he answered, 'unless he were a Piso, I fear, would permit a
  renegade of such rank ever to dwell within the walls of Rome. Let me rather
  hope, that when this war is ended, Portia may exchange Rome for Palmyra, and
  that here, upon this fair and neutral ground, the Pisos may once more dwell
  beneath the same roof.'</p>

  <p>'May it be so,' said Gracchus; 'and let not the heats of political
  opposition change the kindly current of your blood, nor inflame it. You,
  Lucius Piso, are to remember the provocations of Calpurnius, and are to feel
  that there was a nobleness in that sensibility to a declension into Persian
  effeminacy that, to say the least, reflects quite as much honor upon the name
  of Piso, and even Roman, as any loyalty to an emperor like Gallienus, or that
  senate filled with his creatures. And you, Calpurnius Piso, are to allow for
  that instinctive veneration for every thing Roman which grows up with the
  Roman, and even in spite of his better reason ripens into a bigotry that
  deserves the name of a crime rather than a virtue, and are to consider, that
  while in you the growth of this false sentiment has been checked by causes,
  in respect to which you were the sport of fortune, so in Lucius it has been
  quickened by other causes over which he also was powerless. But to utter my
  belief, Lucius I think is now more than half Palmyrene, and I trust yet, if
  committed as he has been to the further tuition of our patriot Fausta, will
  be not only in part, but altogether of our side.'</p>

  <p>'In the mean time, let us rejoice,' said Fausta, 'that the noble
  Calpurnius joins our cause. If we may judge by the eye, the soft life of a
  Persian Satrap has not quite exhausted the native Roman vigor.'</p>

  <p>'I have never intermitted,' replied Calpurnius, 'martial exercises:
  especially have I studied the whole art of horsemanship, so far as the chase
  and military discipline can teach it. It is in her cavalry, as I learn, that
  Zenobia places her strength: I shall there, I trust, do her good
  service.'</p>

  <p>'In the morning,' said Fausta, 'it shall be my office to bring you before
  our Queen.'</p>

  <p>'And now, Fausta,' said Gracchus,'bring your harp, and let music perfect
  the harmony which reason and philosophy have already so well begun;
  music&mdash;which for its power over our souls, may rather be held an
  influence of the gods, a divine breathing, than any thing of mortal
  birth.'</p>

  <p>'I fear,' said Fausta, as she touched the instrument&mdash;the Greek and
  not the Jewish harp&mdash;'I shall still further task your philosophy; for I
  can sing nothing else than the war-song, which is already heard all through
  the streets of Palmyra, and whose author, it is said, is no less than our
  chief spirit, Longinus. Lucius, you must close your ears.'</p>

  <p>'Never, while your voice sounds, though bloody treason were the only
  burden.'</p>

  <p>'You are a gentle Roman.'</p>

  <p>Then after a brief but fiery prelude, which of itself struck by her
  fingers was enough to send life into stones, she broke forth into a strain,
  abrupt and impassioned, of wild Pindaric energy, that seemed the very war-cry
  of a people striking and dying for liberty. Her voice, inspired by a soul too
  large for mortal form, rang like a trumpet through the apartment, and seemed
  to startle the gods themselves at their feast. As the hymn moved on to its
  perfect close, and the voice of Fausta swelled with the waxing theme,
  Calpurnius seemed like one entranced; unconsciously he had left his seat, and
  there, in the midst of the room, stood before the divine girl converted to a
  statue. As she ceased, the eyes of Calpurnius fell quickly upon me, with an
  expression which I instantly interpreted, and should have instantly returned,
  but that we were all alike roused out of ourselves by the loud shouts of a
  multitude without the palace, who apparently had been drawn together by the
  far-reaching tones of Fausta's voice, and who, as soon as the last strings of
  the harp were touched, testified their delight by reiterated and enthusiastic
  cries.</p>

  <p>'When Zabdas and Zenobia fail,' said Calpurnius, 'you, daughter of
  Gracchus, may lead the armies of your country by your harp and voice; they
  would inspire not less than the fame of Caesar or Aurelian.'</p>

  <p>'But be it known to you. Piso,' said Gracchus, 'that this slight girl can
  wield a lance or a sword, while centaur-like she grows to the animal she
  rides, as well as sweep these idle strings.'</p>

  <p>'I will learn of her in either art,' replied my brother. 'As I acknowledge
  no instinct which is to bind me to an unjust parent, but will give honor only
  where there is virtue, so on the field of war I will enlist under any leader
  in whom I behold the genius of a warrior, be that leader man or woman, boy or
  girl.'</p>

  <p>'I shall be satisfied,' said Fausta, 'to become your teacher in music,
  that is, if you can learn through the force of example alone. Take now
  another lesson. Zenobia shall teach you the art of war.'</p>

  <p>With these words she again passed her fingers over her harp, and after
  strains of melting sweetness, prolonged till our souls were wholly subdued to
  the sway of the gentler emotions, she sang in words of Sappho, the praise of
  love and peace, twin-sisters. And then as we urged, or named to her, Greek or
  Roman airs which we wished to hear, did she sing and play till every sense
  was satisfied and filled.</p>

  <p>It needs not so much sagacity as I possess to perceive the effect upon my
  brother of the beauty and powers of Fausta. He speaks with difficulty when he
  addresses her, and while arguing or conversing with me or Gracchus, his eye
  seeks her countenance, and then falls as it encounters hers, as if he had
  committed some crime. Fausta, I am sure, is not insensible to the many rare
  and striking qualities of Calpurnius: but her affections can be given only
  where there is a soul of very uncommon elevation. Whether Calpurnius is
  throughout that, which he seems to be, and whether he is worthy the love of a
  being like Fausta, I know not yet, though I am strong in faith that it is so.
  In the mean time, a mutual affection is springing up and growing upon the
  thin soil of the fancy, and may reach a quick and rank luxuriance before it
  shall be discovered that there is nothing more substantial beneath. But why
  indulge a single doubt? only, I suppose, because I would rather Rome should
  fall than that any harm come to the heart of Fausta.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was a little after the noon of this day that the
ambassadors, Petronius
  and Varro, passed from out the gates of Palmyra, bearing with them a virtual
  declaration of war.</p>

  <p>The greatest excitement prevails. The streets are already filled with
  sights and sounds admonitory of the scenes which are soon to be disclosed.
  There is the utmost enthusiasm in every quarter, and upon every face you
  behold the confidence and pride of those who, accustomed to conquest, are
  about to extend their dominion over new territories, and to whom war is a
  game of pleasure rather than a dark hazard, that may end in utter desolation
  and ruin. Intrenched within these massy walls, the people of this gay capital
  cannot realise war. Its sounds have ever been afar off, beyond the wide sweep
  of the deserts; and will be now, so they judge&mdash;and they are scarcely
  turned for a moment, or by the least remove, from their accustomed cares or
  pleasures.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="letter12"
     id="letter12">LETTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I LAMENT to hear of the disturbance among your slaves, and
of the severity
  with which you have thought it necessary to proceed against them. You will
  bear me witness that I have often warned you that the cruelty with which Tiro
  exercised his authority would lead to difficulties, if not to violence and
  murder. I am not surprised to learn his fate: I am indeed very free to say
  that I rejoice at it. I rejoice not that you are troubled in your affairs,
  but that such an inhuman overseer as Tiro, a man wholly unworthy the kindness
  and indulgence with which you have treated him, should at length be overtaken
  by a just retribution. That the poison took effect upon his wife and children
  I sincerely regret, and wish that some other mode of destruction had been
  chosen, whose effects could have been safely directed and limited, for I do
  not believe that the least ill-will existed toward Claudia and her little
  ones. But rest satisfied, I beseech you, with the punishments already
  inflicted: enough have been scourged, put to the torture, and crucified: let
  the rest escape. Remember your disposition, now indulgent, now tyrannical,
  and lay a restraint upon your passions if you would save yourself from
  lasting regrets. It is some proof that you are looking to yourself more than
  formerly, that so many have been imprisoned to wait a further deliberation,
  and that you are willing first to ask my opinion. Be assured that further
  crucifixions would serve only to exasperate those who survive, and totally
  alienate them from you, so that your own life instead of being the more safe,
  would be much less so. They will be driven to despair, and say that they may
  as well terminate their wretched lives in one way as another, and so end all
  at once by an assault upon yourself and Lucilia, which, while it destroyed
  you, and so glutted their revenge, could do no more than destroy them&mdash;a
  fate which they dread now&mdash;but which at all times, owing to their
  miseries, they dread much less than we suppose, and so are more willing than
  we imagine to take the lives of their masters or governors, not caring for
  death themselves. A well-timed lenity would now be an act of policy as well
  as of virtue. Those whom you have reprieved, being pardoned, will be bound to
  you by a sort of gratitude&mdash;those of them at least who put a value upon
  their lives&mdash;and now that Tiro is fairly out of the way, and his
  scourgings at an end, they will all value their lives at a higher rate than
  before.</p>

  <p>But let me especially intercede for Laco and Caelia, with their children.
  It was they, who, when I have been at your farm, have chiefly attended upon
  me; they have done me many acts of kindness beyond the mere duties of their
  office, and have ever manifested dispositions so gentle, and so much above
  their condition, that I feel sure they cannot be guilty of taking any part in
  the crime. They have been always too happy, to put their all at risk by such
  an attempt. Be assured they are innocent; and they are too good to be
  sacrificed merely for the effect. There are others, wretches in all respects,
  who will serve for this, if enough have not already suffered.</p>

  <p>When will sentiments of justice assert their supremacy in the human mind?
  When will our laws and institutions recognise the rights inherent in every
  man, as man, and compel their observance? When I reflect that I myself
  possess, upon one only of my estates, five hundred slaves, over whom I wield
  despotic power, and that each one of these differs not from myself except in
  the position into which fortune and our laws have cast him, I look with a
  sort of horror upon myself, the laws, and my country which enacts and
  maintains them. But if we cannot at once new-model our institutions and laws,
  we can do something. By a strict justice, and by merciful treatment, we can
  mitigate the evils of their lot who are within our own power. We can exercise
  the authority and temper of fathers, and lay aside in a greater degree than
  we do, the air and manner of tyrant. When upon the fields of every farm, as I
  ride through our interior, I hear the lash of the task-master, and behold the
  cross rearing aloft its victim to poison the air with foetid exhalations and
  strike terror into all who toil within their reach, I hate my country and my
  nature, and long for some power to reveal itself, I care not of what kind nor
  in what quarter, capable to reform a state of society, rotten as this is to
  its very heart.</p>

  <p>You yourself, advocate as you are for the existing order of things, would
  be agitated alternately by horror and compassion, were I to relate to you the
  scenes described to me by Milo, as having a thousand times been witnessed by
  him when in the service of Gallienus. To torture and destroy his slaves, by
  the most ingenious devices of cruelty, was his daily pastime. They were
  purchased for this very end. When I see you again, I will give you instances
  with which I could not soil these pages. Antiochus, were he in Rome, would be
  a monster of the same stamp. But all this is, as I have often mentioned, a
  necessary accompaniment of such power as the laws confer upon the owner.</p>

  <p>And now, that war has actually broken out between Palmyra and Rome, you
  will wish to know what part I intend to take. Your letters imply, that in
  such an event you would expect my immediate return. But this pleasure must,
  for the present at least, he deferred. I am too deeply interested in too many
  here, to allow me to forsake them in a time of so much anxiety, and as I
  think of peril too. Zenobia's full consent I have already obtained: indeed,
  she is now desirous that I should remain. The services that I have
  accidentally rendered her have increased the regard with which she treats me.
  I confess too that I am less unwilling to remain than I was, out of a rooted
  disapprobation of the violent course of Aurelian. I cannot, as Calpurnius has
  done, renounce my country; but I can blame our emperor. His purposes are
  without a color of justice: nor are they only unjust and iniquitous, they are
  impolitic. I can enter fully into and defend the feelings and arguments of
  Palmyra in this direction. Her cause is in the main a just one. She has done
  somewhat indeed to provoke a sensitive and jealous mind; but nothing to
  warrant the step which Aurelian is taking. And when I counsel peace, and by
  concessions too, I do it not because I hold it right that such concessions
  should be made, but because I deem it frantic on the part of Zenobia to
  encounter the combined power of Rome, under such a soldier as Aurelian. My
  sympathies are accordingly enlisted in behalf of this people as a people; my
  heart is closely bound to both the house of Gracchus and Zenobia; and
  therefore I cannot leave them. I shall not bear arms against my country; I
  think I would sooner die; but in any case of extremity I shall not wear a
  sword in vain, if by using it I can save the life or honor of persons dear to
  me. I am firm in the belief, that no such extremity will ever present itself;
  but should it come, I am ready for it. I cannot but hope that a battle, one
  or more, upon the outskirts of the empire, will satisfy the pride of
  Aurelian, and convince the Queen, that to contend for empire with him, and
  Rome at his back, is vain, and that negotiation will therefore end what
  passion has begun. I shall expect no other issue than this. Then, having done
  all here, I shall return to Italy, if the Queen relents not, to pass an
  unhappy life upon the Tiburtine farm.</p>

  <p>Preparations of every kind for the approaching contest are going forward
  with activity. The camp of the Queen is forming without the walls upon a wide
  and beautiful plain, stretching towards the south. One army will be formed
  here chiefly consisting of cavalry, in which lies the strength of the Queen,
  and another in the vicinity of Antioch, where a junction will be effected,
  and whence the whole will move either toward the Bosphorus or Egypt,
  according to the route which, it shall I be learned, Aurelian intends to
  pursue.</p>

  <p>During these few days that have elapsed since the departure of the
  ambassadors, the stir and confusion incident to such a time have continually
  increased. In the streets, I meet scarce any who are not engaged in some
  service connected with the army. Troops of soldiers are forming, exercising
  at their arms, and passing from the city as they are severally equipped to
  join the camp. The shops of the armorers resound with the blows of an
  innumerable body of artisans manufacturing or repairing those brilliant suits
  of steel for which the cavalry of Zenobia are distinguished. Immense
  repositories of all the various weapons of our modern warfare, prepared by
  the Queen against seasons of emergency, furnish forth arms of the most
  perfect workmanship and metal to all who offer themselves for the expedition.
  Without the walls in every direction, the eye beholds clouds of dust raised
  by different bodies of the Queen's forces, as they pour in from their various
  encampments to one central point. Trains of sumptuary elephants and camels,
  making a part of every legion as it comes up, and stretching their long lines
  from the verge of the plain to the very walls, contribute a fresh beauty and
  interest to the scene.</p>

  <p>Within the camp, whatever the tumult and confusion may be without, every
  thing is conducted with the most admirable order, and with the observance of
  a discipline as exact, if not as severe, as that of Vespasian, or Aurelian
  himself. Here are to be seen the commanders of the chief divisions of the
  army inspecting the arms and equipments of each individual soldier, and not
  with less diligence inquiring into the mettle and points of the horse he
  rides. Every horse, pronounced in any way defective, is rejected from the
  service and another procured. The Queen's stable has been exhausted in
  providing in this manner substitutes for such as have been set aside as
  unworthy.</p>

  <p>Zenobia herself is the most active and laborious of all. She is in every
  place, seeing with her own eyes that every arrangement and provision ordered
  to be made is completed, and that in the most perfect manner. All the duties
  of a general are performed by her, with a freedom, a power, and a boldness,
  that fills one with astonishment who is acquainted with those opposite
  qualities which render her, as a woman, the most lovely and fascinating of
  her sex. She is seen sometimes driving rapidly through the streets in an open
  chariot, of the antique form; but more frequently on horseback, with a small
  body of attendants, who have quite enough to do to keep pace with her, so as
  to catch from her the orders which she rapidly issues, and then execute them
  in every part of the camp and city. She inspires all who behold her with her
  own spirit. In every soldier and leader you behold something of the same
  alertness and impetuosity of movement which are so remarkable in her. She is
  the universal model; and the confidence in the resources of her genius is
  universal and boundless. 'Let our courage and conduct,' they say, 'be only in
  some good proportion to our Queen's, and we may defy Rome and the world.' As
  the idea of naught but conquest ever crosses their minds, the
  animation&mdash;even gayety that prevails in the camp and throughout the
  ranks is scarcely to be believed, as it is, I doubt not, unparalleled in the
  history of war. Were she a goddess, and omnipotent, the trust in her could
  not be more unwavering.</p>

  <p>I have just encountered Calpurnius returning from the palace of the Queen,
  whither he has been to offer his services during the war, in any capacity in
  which it might please her to employ him.</p>

  <p>'What was your reception?' said I.</p>

  <p>'Such as Fausta had assured me of. She gives me a hearty welcome to her
  camp, and assigns me a legion of horse. And, in addition, one more charge
  dearer and yet more anxious a thousand-fold.'</p>

  <p>'May I know it?' said I, but readily surmising the nature of it.</p>

  <p>'It is,' he replied with visible emotion, 'Fausta herself.'</p>

  <p>'It is fixed then that she accompanies the Queen?'</p>

  <p>'She entreats, and the Queen consents.'</p>

  <p>'Would that she could be turned from this purpose, but I suppose the
  united power of the East could not do it. To be near Zenobia, and if evil
  should befall her to share it, or to throw herself as a shield between the
  Queen and death, is what she pants for more than for renown, though it should
  be double that of Semiramis.'</p>

  <p>'Lucius, have you urged every reason, and used all the power you possess
  over her, to dissuade her?'</p>

  <p>'I have done all I have dared to do. The decisions of some minds, you
  know, with the motives which sway them, we too much revere to oppose to them
  our own. Girl though Fausta be, yet when I see by the lofty expression of her
  countenance, her firm and steadfast eye, that she has taken her part, I have
  no assurance sufficient to question the rectitude of her determination, or
  essay to change it. I have more faith in her in myself.'</p>

  <p>'Yet it must never be,' said my brother with earnestness; 'she could never
  support the fatigues of such a campaign, and it must not be permitted that
  she should encounter the dangers and horrors of actual combat. I have learned
  that at the palace which, while it has dismissed the most painful
  apprehensions of one sort, has filled me with others more tolerable, but yet
  intolerable. How, Lucius? has it happened that your heart, soft in most of
  its parts, on one side has been adamant?'</p>

  <p>'The way of the heart,'I said, 'like the way of Providence, is mysterious.
  I know not. Perhaps it was that I knew her longer in Rome and more closely
  than you, and the sentiment always uppermost toward her has been that of a
  brother's love. Hers toward me has never been other than the free,
  unrestrained affection of a sister. But you have not seen the Princess?'</p>

  <p>'I have not.'</p>

  <p>'That will complete the explanation. The Queen rejects me; but I do not
  despair. But to return to Fausta. As no force could withhold her from the
  army, I thank the gods that in you she will find a companion and defender,
  and that to you the Queen has committed her. Fail her not, Calpurnius, in the
  hour of need. You do not know, for your eye has but taken in her outward
  form, what a jewel, richer than Eastern monarch ever knew, is entrusted to
  your care. Keep it as you would your own life, nay, your life will be well
  given for its safety. Forgive me, if in this I seem to charge you as an
  elder. Remember that you I do not know, Fausta I do. Of you I scarcely know
  more than that you are a Piso, and that the very soul of honor ought to dwell
  within you. The Queen's ready confidence in you, lays you under obligations
  heavy as injunctions from the gods to fidelity. If, as you journey on toward
  Antioch, the opportunities of the way throw you together, and your heart is
  won by your nearer knowledge of her sweet qualities as well as great ones, as
  your eye has already been, ask not, seek not, for hers, but after a close
  questioning of yourself whether you are worthy of her. Of your life and the
  true lineaments of your soul, you know every thing, she knows nothing; but
  she is more free and unsuspicious than a child, and without looking further
  than the show and color of honesty and truth, will surrender up her heart
  where her fancy leads, trusting to find according to her faith, and to
  receive all that she gives. Brother though you be, I here invoke the curses
  of the gods upon your head, if the faintest purpose of dishonest or deceptive
  dealing have place within you.'</p>

  <p>'Your words,' said Calpurnius in reply&mdash;a wholesome and natural
  expression of indignation spreading over his countenance, which inspired more
  confidence than any thing he could say&mdash;'your words, Lucius, are earnest
  and something sharp. But I bear them without complaint, for the sake of the
  cause in which you have used them. I blame you not. It is true, I am a
  stranger both to yourself and Fausta, and it were monstrous to ask confidence
  before time has proved me. Leave it all to time. My conduct under this trust
  shall be my trial. Not till our return from Antioch will I aim at more than
  the happiness to be her companion and guard. The noble Otho will be near us,
  to whom you may commit us both.'</p>

  <p>'Brother,'I rejoined, 'I doubt you not; but where our treasure is great,
  we are tormented by imaginary fears, and we guard it by a thousand
  superfluous cares, What I have said has implied the existence of doubts and
  apprehensions, but in sober truth they were forced into existence. My nature
  from the first has been full of trust in you; but this very promptness to
  confide, my anxious fears converted to a fault, and urged suspicion as a
  duty. Your countenance and your words have now inspired me with an assurance,
  not, I am certain, to be ever shaken, in your virtues. It shall be my joy to
  impart the same to Gracchus. Fausta shall be left free to the workings of her
  own mind and heart.'</p>

  <p>I should not have been justified, it seems to me, in saying less than
  this, though I said it with apprehensions, many and grave, of a breach
  between us, which perhaps time might never heal. It has ended in a deep and
  settled conviction that the character of Calpurnius is what it at first
  appears to be. Persian duplicity has made no lodgment within him, of that I
  am sure. And where you feel sure of sincerity, almost any other fault may be
  borne.</p>

  <p>The army has taken up its march, and the city is deprived of its best and
  bravest spirits&mdash;Zenobia and Fausta, those kindred souls, are gone. How
  desolate is this vast palace! The loss of Gracchus and Fausta seems the loss
  of all. A hundred attendant slaves leave it still empty.</p>

  <p>A period of the most active preparation has been closed to-day, by the
  departure of as well appointed an army as ever issued from the Praetorian
  camps. It was a spectacle as beautiful as my eyes ever beheld&mdash;and as
  sad. Let me set before you the events of the day.</p>

  <p>As I descended to the apartment where we take together our morning meal,
  and which we were now for the last time to partake in each other's company, I
  found Fausta already there, and surveying with sparkling eyes and a flushed
  cheek a suit of the most brilliant armor, which having been made by the
  Queen's workmen, and by her order, had just now been brought and delivered to
  her.</p>

  <p>'I asked the honor,' said the person with whom she was conversing, 'to
  bring it myself, who have made it with the same care as the Queen's, of the
  same materials, and after the same fashion. So it was her order to do. It
  will set, lady, believe me, as easy as a riding dress, though it be all of
  the most impenetrable steel. The polish too is such, that neither arrow nor
  javelin need be feared, they can but touch and glance. Hercules could not
  indent this surface. Let me reveal to you diverse secret and perfect springs
  and clasps, the use of which you should be well acquainted with. Yet it
  differs not so much from that in which you have performed your exercises, but
  you will readily comprehend the manner of its adjustment.'</p>

  <p>He then went through with his demonstrations, and departed.</p>

  <p>'This is beautiful indeed!'I said, as I surveyed and handled parts of the
  armor; 'the eye can hardly bear it when the rays of the sun fall upon it. But
  I wish it was fairly back again in the shop of the armored'</p>

  <p>'That would he,' said Fausta, 'only to condemn me to an older and worse
  one; and if you should wish that away too, it would be only to send me into
  the ranks defenceless. Surely that you would not do?'</p>

  <p>'The gods forbid! I only mean that I would rather these walls, Fausta,
  should he your defence. You were not made, whatever you may think, to brave
  the dangers of the desert and the horrors of a war. Do you remember at the
  amphitheatre you hid your eyes from the cruel sights of the arena? I doubt
  not your courage; but it is not after your heart.'</p>

  <p>'From the useless barbarities of the circus I might indeed turn away my
  eyes, and yet I think with perfect consistency strike my lance into the heart
  of a man who came against my country or my Queen, nor even blench. But do not
  suppose that it is with any light or childish joy that I resolve to follow in
  the steps of Zenobia to the field of slaughter. I would far rather sit here
  in the midst of security and peace, making mimic war on my embroidery, or
  tuning my voice and harp, with Gracchus and you to listen and applaud. But
  there is that within me that forbids my stay. I am urged from within by a
  voice which seems as the voice of a god, to do according to my strength, for
  what may be the last struggle of our country against the encroachments and
  ambition of Rome. You may deem it little that a woman can do?'</p>

  <p>'I confess I am of opinion that many a substitute could do Palmyra a
  better service than even the arm of Fausta. A woman may do much and bravely,
  but a man may do more.'</p>

  <p>'Therein, Lucius, am I persuaded you err. If it were only that, in the
  language of Zahdas, I added so many pounds weight of bone and flesh, by
  adding myself to the Queen's troops, I would stay at home, There are heavier
  arms than mine, for mine are slight, and sturdier limbs, for mine in spite of
  the sports of the field are still a woman's. But you know nothing of Palmyra
  if you know not this, that her victories have been won, not by the arm, but
  by the presence of Zenobia; to be led to the onset by a woman, and that woman
  Zenobia&mdash;it is this that has infused a spirit and an enthusiasm into our
  soldiery that has rendered them irresistible. Were it a thousand against ten
  thousand, not a native Palmyrene would shrink from the trial, with Zenobia at
  their head. I am not Zenobia, Lucius, but what she can do for an army, I can
  do for a legion. Mark the sensation, when this morning Zenobia presents
  herself to the army, and even when Fausta wheels into the ranks, and
  acknowledge that I have uttered a truth.'</p>

  <p>'There must be truth in what you say, for were I in your train I can feel
  how far I should follow you, and when forsake you. But what you say only
  fills me with new apprehensions, and renders me the more anxious to detain
  you. What but certain death awaits you if you are to lead the way?'</p>

  <p>'And why should I not die, as well as another? And is it of more
  consequence that Fausta, the daughter of Gracchus, should die upon a bed of
  down, and beneath silken canopies, than that the common soldier should, who
  falls at her side? How could I die hotter than at the head of a legion, whom,
  as I fell, I saw sweeping on like a tempest to emulate and revenge my
  death?'</p>

  <p>'But Gracchus&mdash;has he another Fausta, or another child?'</p>

  <p>Her eyes were bent to the ground, and for a few moments she was buried in
  thought. They were filled with tears as she raised them and said,</p>

  <p>'You may well suppose, Lucius, having witnessed, as you have, what the
  love is which I bear Gracchus, and how his life is bound up in mine, that
  this has been my heaviest thought. But it has not prevailed with me to change
  my purpose, and ought not to do so. Could I look into futurity, and know that
  while I fell upon the plains of Antioch, or on the sands of the desert, he
  returned to these walls to wear out, childless and in solitude, the remnant
  of his days, my weakness I believe would yield, and I should prefer my parent
  to my country. But the future is all dark. And it may as well be, that either
  we shall both fall, or both return; or that he may fall and I survive. It is
  unworthy of me, is it not then, to consider too curiously such chances? The
  only thing certain and of certain advantage is this&mdash;I can do my
  country, as I deem it, a signal service by joining her forces in this hour of
  peril. To this I cleave, and leave the rest to the disposal of the gods. But
  come, urge me no more, Lucius; my mind is finally resolved, and it but serves
  to darken the remaining hours. See, Gracchus and Calpurnius are
  come&mdash;let us to the tables.'</p>

  <p>This last meal was eaten in silence, save the few required words of
  courtesy.</p>

  <p>Soon as it was over, Fausta, springing from her seat, disappeared,
  hastening to her apartments. She returned in a few moments, her dress changed
  and prepared for her armor.</p>

  <p>'Now, Lucius,' she exclaimed, 'your hour of duty has come, which is to fit
  upon me this queenly apparel. Show your dexterity, and prove that you too
  have seen the wars, by the grace with which you shall do your service.'</p>

  <p>'These pieces differ not greatly,'I said, 'from those which I have worn in
  Gaul and Germany, and were they to be fastened on my own limbs, or a
  comrade's, the task were an easy one. I fear lest I may use too rough a hand
  in binding on this heavy iron.'</p>

  <p>'O, never fear&mdash;there, that is well. The Queen's armorer has said
  truly; this is easy as a robe of silk. Now these clasps&mdash;are they not
  well made? will they not catch?'</p>

  <p>'The clasps are perfect, Fausta, but my eye is dim. Here&mdash;clasp them
  yourself;' and I turned away.</p>

  <p>'Lucius, Lucius, are you a Roman, with eyes so melting? Julia were a
  better hand-maid. But one thing remains, and that must be done by no other
  hand than yours&mdash;crown me now with this helmet.'</p>

  <p>I took it from her and placed it upon her head, saying, as I did it, 'The
  gods shield you from danger, dear Fausta, and when you have either triumphed
  or suffered defeat, return you again to this happy roof! Now for my services
  allow me this reward'&mdash;and for the first time since she was a girl I
  kissed her forehead.</p>

  <p>She was now a beautiful vision to behold as ever lighted upon the earth.
  Her armor revealed with exactness the perfection of her form, and to her
  uncommon beauty added its own, being of the most brilliant steel, and
  frequently studded with jewels of dazzling lustre. Her sex was revealed only
  by her hair, which, parting over her forehead, fell towards either eye, and
  then was drawn up and buried in her helmet. The ease with which she moved
  showed how well she had accustomed herself, by frequent exercises, to the
  cumbrous load she bore. I could hardly believe, as she paced the apartment,
  issuing her final orders to her slaves and attendants who pressed around,
  that I was looking upon a woman reared in all the luxury of the East. Much as
  I had been accustomed to the sight of Zenobia, performing the part of an
  emperor, I found it difficult to persuade myself, that when I looked upon
  Fausta, changing so completely her sex, it was any thing more than an
  illusion.</p>

  <p>Gracchus and Calpurnius now joined us, each, like Fausta, arrayed in the
  armor of the Queen's cavalry.</p>

  <p>'Fausta,' said Gracchus hastily, 'the hour is come that we were at the
  camp; our horses wait us in the court-yard&mdash;let us mount. Farewell,
  Lucius Piso,' continued he, as we moved toward the rear of the palace; 'would
  you were to make one of our company; but as that cannot be, I bequeath to you
  my place, my honors, and my house. Be ready to receive us with large
  hospitality and a philosophical composure, when we return loaded with the
  laurels of victory and the spoils of your countrymen. It is fortunate, that
  as we lose you, we have Calpurnius, who seems of the true warrior breed.
  Never, Lucius, has my eye lighted upon a nobler pair than this. Observe them.
  The Queen, careful of our Fausta, has given her in special charge to your
  brother. I thank her. By his greater activity and my more prudent counsel, I
  trust to bring her again to Palmyra with a fame not less than Zenobia's.</p>

  <p>'I can spare the fame,'I replied, 'so I see her once more in Palmyra,
  herself unharmed and her country at peace.'</p>

  <p>'Palmyra would no longer be itself without her,' rejoined the father.</p>

  <p>We were now in the court-yard, where we found the horses fully
  caparisoned, awaiting their riders. Fausta's was her favorite Arab, of a jet
  black color and of a fierce and fiery temper, hardly to be managed by the
  Saracen, whose sole office it was to attend upon him; while in the hands of
  Fausta, though still spirited almost to wildness, he was yet docile and
  obedient. Soon as she was mounted, although before it had been difficult to
  hold him, he became quiet and calm.</p>

  <p>'See the power of woman,' said Gracchus; 'were Antiochus here, he would
  look upon this as but another proof that the gods are abandoning Palmyra to
  the sway of women.'</p>

  <p>'It is,' said Fausta, 'simply the power of gentleness. My Saracen operates
  through fear, and I through love. My hand laid softly upon his neck gains
  more a thousand fold than the lash laid hardly upon his back.'</p>

  <p>Mounting my horse, which Milo stood holding for me, we then sallied out of
  the court-yard gate toward the camp.</p>

  <p>The city itself was all pouring forth upon the plains in its vicinity. The
  crowds choked the streets as they passed out, so that our progress was slow.
  Arriving at length, we turned toward the pavilion of the Queen, pitched over
  against the centre of the army. There we stood, joined by others, awaiting
  her arrival; for she had not yet left the palace. We had not stood long,
  before the braying of trumpets and other warlike instruments announced her
  approach. We turned, and looking toward the gate of the city, through which
  we had but now passed, saw Zenobia, having on either side Longinus and
  Zabdas, and preceded and followed by a select troop of horse, advancing at
  her usual speed toward the pavilion. She was mounted upon her far-famed white
  Numidian, for power an elephant, for endurance a dromedary, for fleetness a
  very Nicoean, and who had been her companion in all the battles by which she
  had gained her renown and her empire.</p>

  <p>Calpurnius was beside himself: he had not before seen her when assuming
  all her state. 'Did eye ever look upon aught so like a celestial apparition?
  It is a descent from other regions; I can swear 'tis no mortal&mdash;still
  less a woman. Fausta, this puts to shame your eulogies, swollen as I termed
  them.'</p>

  <p>I did not wonder at his amazement, for I myself shared it, though I had
  seen her so often. The object that approached us truly seemed rather a moving
  blaze of light than an armed woman, which the eye and the reason declared it
  to be, with such gorgeous magnificence was she arrayed. The whole art of the
  armorer had been exhausted in her appointments. The caparison of her steed,
  sheathed with burnished gold, and thick studded with precious stones of every
  various hue, reflected an almost intolerable splendor as the rays of a hot
  morning sun fell upon it. She too herself, being clothed in armor of polished
  steel, whose own fiery brightness was doubled by the diamonds&mdash;that was
  the only jewel she wore&mdash;sown with profusion all over its more prominent
  parts, could he gazed upon scarcely with more ease than the sun himself,
  whose beams were given back from it with undiminished glory. In her right
  hand she held the long slender lance of the cavalry; over her shoulders hung
  a quiver well loaded with arrows, while at her side depended a heavy Damascus
  blade. Her head was surmounted by a steel helmet, which left her face wholly
  uncovered, and showed her forehead, like Fausta's shaded by the dark hair,
  which, while it was the only circumstance that revealed the woman, added to
  the effect of a countenance unequalled for a marvellous union of feminine
  beauty, queenly dignity, and masculine power. Sometimes it has been her
  usage, upon such occasions, to appear with arms bare and gloved hands; they
  were now cased, like the rest of the body, in plates of steel.</p>

  <p>'Calpurnius,' said Fausta, 'saw you ever in Persia such horsemanship? See
  now, as she draws nearer, with what grace and power she moves. Blame you the
  enthusiasm of this people?'</p>

  <p>'I more than share it,' he replied; 'it is reward enough for my long
  captivity, at last to follow such a leader. Many a time, as Zenobia has in
  years past visited my dreams, and I almost fancied myself in her train, I
  little thought that the happiness I now experience was to become a reality.
  But hark! how the shout of welcome goes up from this innumerable host.'</p>

  <p>No sooner was the Queen arrived where we stood, and the whole extended
  lines became aware of her presence, than the air was filled with the clang of
  trumpets and the enthusiastic cries of the soldiery, who waved aloft their
  arms and made a thousand expressive signs of most joyful greeting. When this
  hearty salutation, commencing at the centre, had died away along the wings,
  stretching one way to the walls of the city, and the other toward the desert,
  Zenobia rode up nearer the lines, and being there surrounded by the ranks
  which were in front, and by a crowd of the great officers of the army, spoke
  to them in accordance with her custom. Stretching out her hand, as if she
  would ask the attention of the multitude, a deep silence ensued, and in a
  voice clear and strong, she thus addressed them:</p>

  <p>'Men and soldiers of Palmyra! Is this the last time that you are to gather
  together in this glittering array, and go forth as lords of the whole East?
  Conquerors in so many wars, are you now about to make an offering of
  yourselves and your homes to the emperor of Rome? Am I, who have twice led
  you to the gates of Ctesiphon, now to be your leader to the footstool of
  Aurelian? Are you thinking of any thing but victory? Is there one in all
  these ranks who doubts whether the same fate that once befel Probus shall now
  befal Aurelian? If there be, let him stand forth! Let him go and intrench
  himself within the walls of Palmyra. We want him not. (The soldiers
  brandished and clashed their arms.) Victory, soldiers, belongs to those who
  believe. Believe that you can do so, and we will return with a Roman army
  captive at our chariot wheels. Who should put trust in themselves, if not the
  men and soldiers of Palmyra? Whose memory is long enough to reach backward to
  a defeat? What was the reign of Odenatus but an unbroken triumph? Are you
  now, for the first time, to fly or fall before an enemy? And who the enemy?
  Forget it not&mdash;Rome! and Aurelian! the greatest empire and the greatest
  soldier of the world. Never before was so large a prize within your reach.
  Never before fought you on a stage with the whole world for spectators.
  Forget not too that defeat will be not only defeat, but ruin! The loss of a
  battle will be not only so many dead and wounded, but the loss of empire! For
  Rome resolves upon our subjugation. We must conquer or we must perish, and
  forever lose our city, our throne, and our name. Are you ready to write
  yourselves subjects and slaves of Rome!&mdash;citizens of a Roman province?
  and forfeit the proud name of Palmyrene?' (Loud and indignant cries rose from
  the surrounding ranks.) 'If not, you have only to remember the plains of
  Egypt and of Persia; and the spirit that burned within your bosoms then will
  save you now, and bring you back to these walls, your brows bound about with
  the garlands of victory. Soldiers! strike your tents! and away to the
  desert!'</p>

  <p>Shouts long and loud, mingled with the clash of arms, followed these few
  words of the Queen. Her own name was heard above all. "Long live the great
  Zenobia!" ran along the ranks from the centre to the extremes, and from the
  extremes back again to the centre. It seemed as if, when her name had once
  been uttered, they could not cease&mdash;through the operation of some
  charm&mdash;to repeat it again and again, coupled too with a thousand phrases
  of loyalty and affection.</p>

  <p>The Queen, as she ended, turned toward the Pavilion, where dismounting she
  entered, and together with her, her counsellors, the great officers of the
  army and empire, her family, and friends. Here was passed an hour in the
  interchange of the words and signs of affection between those who were about
  to depart upon this uncertain enterprise, and those who were to remain. The
  Queen would fain inspire all with her light, bold, and confident spirit, but
  it could not prevail to banish the fears and sorrows that filled many hearts.
  Julia's eyes never moved from her mother's face, or only to rest on Fausta's,
  whose hand she held clasped in her own. Zenobia often turned towards her with
  a look, in which the melting tenderness of the mother contended but too
  successfully with the calm dignity of the Queen, and bore testimony to the
  strong affection working at the heart. She would then, saying a word or two,
  turn away again, and mingle with those who made less demand upon her
  sympathies. Livia was there too, and the flaxen-haired Faustula&mdash;Livia,
  gay even, through excess of life&mdash;Faustula sad and almost terrified at
  the scene, and clinging to Julia as to her haven of safety. The Caesars were
  also there, insignificant as always, but the youngest, Vabalathus, armed for
  the war; the others are not to be drawn away from the luxuries and pleasures
  of the city. Antiochus, sullen and silent, was of the number too, stalking
  with folded arms apart from the company, or else arm in arm with one of his
  own color, and seeming to be there rather because he feared to be absent,
  than because he derived any pleasure from the scene. It was with an effort,
  and with reluctance, that he came forward from his hiding places, and with
  supreme awkwardness, yet with an air of haughtiness and pride, paid his court
  to the Queen.</p>

  <p>As he retreated from his audience, the Queen's eye sought me, and
  approaching me she said, 'Piso, I am not prone to suspicion, and fear is a
  stranger to my heart: but I am told to distrust Antiochus. I have been warned
  to observe him. I cannot now do it, for I depart while he remains in Palmyra.
  It has been thrown out that he has designs of a treasonable nature, and that
  the Princess Julia is connected with them. He is an object too contemptible
  to deserve my thought, and I have not been willing so much as to name the
  circumstance to any of the council. He may prove an amusing and interesting
  subject for your speculation while we are gone.'</p>

  <p>This was said in a partly serious, partly trifling vein. I answered her,
  saying, 'that I could not but fear lest there might be more foundation for
  the warnings that had been given her than she was disposed to allow. He was
  indeed insignificant and contemptible in character, but he was malignant and
  restless. Many an insect, otherwise every way despicable, is yet armed with a
  deadly sting. A swarm may conquer even the monarch of the forest. Antiochus,
  mean as he is, may yet inflict a secret and fatal wound; and he is not alone;
  there are those who affect him. I believe you have imposed no task which as a
  Roman I may not innocently perform. Rest assured that if watchfulness of mine
  may avert the shadow of an evil from your head, it shall not be wanting. I
  would that you yourself could look more seriously upon this information, but
  I perceive you to be utterly incredulous.'</p>

  <p>'It is so indeed,' she replied. 'It were better for me perhaps were it
  otherwise. Had I heeded the rumors which reached me of the base Maeonius,
  Odenatus had now perhaps been alive and at my side. But it is against the
  grain of my nature. I can neither doubt nor fear.'</p>

  <p>Sounds from without now indicated that the camp was broken up, and the
  army in motion. The moment of separation had come. The Queen hastily
  approached her daughters, and impressing a mother's kisses upon them turned
  quickly away, and springing upon her horse was soon lost to sight as she made
  her way through the ranks, to assume her place at their head. Fausta lingered
  long in the embraces of Julia, who, to part with her, seemed as if about to
  lose as much more as she had just lost in Zenobia.</p>

  <p>'These our friends being now gone, let us,' said the Princess, 'who
  remain, ascend together the walls of the city, and from the towers of the
  gate observe the progress of the army so long as it shall remain in
  sight.'</p>

  <p>Saying this, we returned to the city, and from the highest part of the
  walls watched the departing glories of the most magnificent military array I
  had ever beheld. It was long after noon before the last of the train of
  loaded elephants sank below the horizon. I have seen larger armies upon the
  Danube, and in Gaul: but never have I seen one that in all its appointments
  presented so imposing a spectacle. This was partly owing to the greater
  proportion of cavalry, and to the admixture of the long lines of elephants
  with their burdens, their towers and litters; but more perhaps to the
  perfectness with which each individual, be he on horse or foot, be he
  servant, slave or master, is furnished, respecting both arms, armor, and
  apparel. Julia beheld it, if with sorrow, with pride also.</p>

  <p>'Between an army like this,' she said, 'so appointed, and so led and
  inflamed, and another like that of Rome coming up under a leader like
  Aurelian, how sharp and deadly must be the encounter! What a multitude of
  this and that living host, now glorious in the blaze of arms, and burning
  with desires of conquest, will fall and perish, pierced by weapons, or
  crushed by elephants, nor ever hear the shout of victory! A horrid death,
  winding up a feverish dream. And of that number how likely to be Fausta and
  Zenobia!'</p>

  <p>'Why, sister,' said Faustula, whom I held, and in pointing out to whom the
  most remarkable objects of the strange scene I had been occupied, 'why does
  our mother love to go away and kill the Romans? I am sure she would not like
  to kill you,'&mdash;looking up in my face,&mdash;'and are not you a Roman?
  She will not let me hurt even a little fly or ant, but tells me they feel as
  much to be killed, as if Sapor were to put his great foot on me and tread me
  into the sand.'</p>

  <p>'But the Romans,' said Julia, 'are coming to take away our city from us,
  and perhaps do us a great deal of harm, and must they not be hindered?'</p>

  <p>'But,' replied Faustula, 'would they do it if Zenobia asked them not to do
  it? Did you ever know any body who could help doing as she asked them? I wish
  Aurelian could only have come here and heard her speak, and seen her smile,
  and I know he would not have wanted to hurt her. If I were a Queen, I would
  never fight.'</p>

  <p>'I do not believe you would,' said I; 'you do not seem as if you could
  hurt any body or any thing.'</p>

  <p>'And now is not Zenobia better than I? I think perhaps she is only going
  to frighten the Romans, and then coming home again.'</p>

  <p>'O no&mdash;do not think so,' said Livia; 'has not Zenobia fought a great
  many battles before this? If she did not fight battles, we should have no
  city to live in.'</p>

  <p>'If it is so good to fight battles, why does she prevent me from
  quarrelling, or even speaking unkindly? I think she ought to teach me to
  fight. I do not believe that men or women ought to fight any more than
  children; and I dare say if they first saw and talked with one another before
  they fought, as I am told to do, they never would do it. I find that if I
  talk and tell what I think, then I do not want to quarrel.&mdash;See! is that
  Zenobia? How bright she shines! I wish she would come back.'</p>

  <p>'Wait a little while, and she will come again,' said Livia, 'and bring
  Aurelian perhaps with her. Should you not like to see Aurelian?'</p>

  <p>'No, I am sure I should not. I do not want to see any one that does not
  love Zenobia.'</p>

  <p>So the little child ran on, often uttering truths, too obviously truths
  for mankind to be governed by them, yet containing the best philosophy of
  life. Truth and happiness are both within easy reach. We miss them because
  they are so near. We look over them, and grasp at distant and more imposing
  objects, wrapped in the false charms which distance lends.</p>

  <p>During the absence of the Queen and Fausta, we have, in agreement with the
  promise we made, repeated our visit more than once to the retreat of the
  Christian Hermit; from whom I have drawn almost all that remains to he known,
  concerning the truths of his religion. Both Julia and Livia have been my
  companions. Of the conversations at these visits, I shall hope at some future
  time to furnish you with full accounts.</p>

  <p>In the meanwhile, Farewell.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="letter13"
     id="letter13">LETTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THESE few days having passed in the manner I have
described, our
  impatience has been relieved by news from the West. We learn that Aurelian,
  having appointed Illyricum as the central point for assembling his forces,
  has, marching thence through Thrace, and giving battle on the way to the
  Goths, at length reached Byzantium, whence crossing the Bosphorus, it is his
  purpose to subdue the Asiatic provinces, and afterwards advance toward
  Palmyra. The army of the Queen, judging by the last accounts received by her
  messengers, must now have reached the neighborhood of Antioch, and there
  already perhaps have encountered the forces of the Emperor.</p>

  <p>The citizens begin at length to put on the appearance of those who feel
  that something of value is at stake. The Portico is forsaken, or frequented
  only by such as hope to hear news by going there. The streets are become
  silent and solitary. I myself partake of the general gloom. I am often at the
  palace and at the house of Longinus. The dwelling, or rather should I not
  term it the spacious palace of the minister, affords me delightful hours of
  relaxation and instruction, as I sit and converse with its accomplished lord,
  or wander among the compartments of his vast library, or feast the senses and
  imagination upon the choice specimens of sculpture and painting, both ancient
  and modern, which adorn the walls, the ceilings, the stair-ways, and, indeed,
  every part of the extensive interior. Here I succeed in forgetting the world
  and all its useless troubles, and am fairly transported into those regions of
  the fancy, where the airs are always soft and the skies serene, where want is
  unknown, and solicitations to vice come not, where men are just and true and
  kind, and women the goddesses we make them in our dreams, and the whole of
  existence is a calm summer's day, without storm of the inward or outward
  world. And when upon these delicious moments the philosopher himself breaks
  in, the dream is not dissolved, but stands rather converted to an absolute
  reality, for it then shines with the actual presence of a god. It is with
  unwillingness that I acknowledge my real state, and consent to return to this
  living world of anxieties and apprehensions in which I now dwell.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I am just returned from the palace and the Princess Julia.
While there
  seated in conversation with her, Longinus, and Livia, a courier was suddenly
  announced from Zenobia. He entered, we stamped upon his features, and
  delivered letters into the hands of Longinus. Alas! Alas! for Palmyra. The
  intelligence is of disaster and defeat! The countenance of the Greek grew
  pale as he read. He placed the despatches in silence in the hands of Julia,
  having finished them, and hastily withdrew.</p>

  <p>The sum of the news is this. A battle has been fought before Antioch, and
  the forces of the Queen completely routed. It appears that upon the approach
  of Aurelian, the several provinces of Asia Minor, which by negotiation and
  conquest had by Zenobia been connected with her kingdom, immediately returned
  to their former allegiance. The cities opened their gates and admitted the
  armies of the conqueror. Tyana alone of all the Queen's dominions in that
  quarter opposed the progress of the Emperor, and this strong-hold was soon by
  treachery delivered into his power. Thence he pressed on without pause to
  Antioch, where he found the Queen awaiting him. A battle immediately ensued.
  At first, the Queen's forces obtained decided advantages, and victory seemed
  ready to declare for her as always before, when the gods decreed otherwise,
  and the day was lost&mdash;but lost, in the indignant language of the Queen,
  'not in fair and honorable fight, but through the baseness of a stratagem
  rather to have been expected from a Carthaginian than the great
  Aurelian.'</p>

  <p>'Our troops,' she writes, 'had driven the enemy from, his ground at every
  point. Notwithstanding the presence of Aurelian, and the prodigies of valor
  by which he distinguished himself anew, and animated his soldiers, our
  cavalry, led by the incomparable Zabdas, bore him and his legions backwards,
  till apparently discomfited by the violence of the onset, the Roman horse
  gave way and fled in all directions. The shout of victory arose from our
  ranks, which now broke, and in the disorder of a flushed and conquering army,
  scattered in hot pursuit of the flying foe. Now, when too late, we saw the
  treachery of the enemy. Our horse, heavy-armed as you know, were led on by
  the retreating Romans into a broken and marshy ground, where their movements
  were in every way impeded, and thousands were suddenly fixed immovable in the
  deep morass. At this moment, the enemy, by preconcerted signals, with
  inconceivable rapidity, being light-armed, formed; and, returning upon our
  now scattered forces, made horrible slaughter of all who had pushed farthest
  from the main body of the army. Dismay seized our soldiers, the panic spread,
  increased by the belief that a fresh army had come up and was entering the
  field, and our whole duty centered in forming and covering our retreat. This,
  chiefly through the conduct of Calpurnius Piso, was safely effected; the
  Romans being kept at bay while we drew together, and then under cover of the
  approaching night fell back to a new and strong position.</p>

  <p>'I attempt not, Longinus, to make that better which is bad. I reveal the
  whole truth, not softening nor withholding a single feature of it, that your
  mind may be possessed of the exact state of our affairs, and know how to form
  its judgments. Make that which I write public, to the extent and in the
  manner that shall seem best to you.</p>

  <p>'After mature deliberation, we have determined to retreat further yet, and
  take up our position under the walls of Emesa. Here, I trust in the gods, we
  shall redeem that which we have lost.'</p>

  <p>In a letter to Julia the Queen says, 'Fausta has escaped the dangers of
  the battle; selfishly perhaps dividing her from Piso, she has shared my tent
  and my fortunes, and has proved herself worthy of every confidence that has
  been reposed in her. She is my inseparable companion in the tent, in the
  field, and on the road, by night and by day. Give not way to despondency,
  dear Julia. Fortune, which has so long smiled upon me, is not now about to
  forsake me. There is no day so long and bright that clouds do not sail by and
  cast their little shadows. But the sun is behind them. Our army is still
  great and in good heart. The soldiers receive me, whenever I appear, with
  their customary acclamations. Fausta shares this enthusiasm. Wait without
  anxiety or fear for news from Emesa.'</p>

  <p>When we had perused and re-perused the despatches of the Queen, and were
  brooding in no little despondency over their contents, Longinus re-entering
  said to me,</p>

  <p>'And what, Piso, may I ask, is your judgment of the course which Aurelian
  will now pursue? I see not that I can offend in asking, or you in answering.
  I have heretofore inclined to the belief that Rome, having atoned her injured
  honor by a battle, would then prefer to convert Palmyra into a useful ally,
  by the proposal of terms which she could accept; terms which would leave her
  an independent existence as formerly, in friendly alliance with, though in no
  sense subject to Rome. But neither preceding the battle at Antioch, nor
  since, does it appear that terms have been so much as proposed or discussed.
  I can hardly believe that Aurelian, even if victory should continue to sit
  upon his eagles, would desire to drive the Queen to extremities, and convert
  this whole people into a united and infuriated enemy. If he be willing to do
  this, he little understands the best interests of Rome, and proves only this,
  that though he may be a good soldier, he is a bad sovereign, and really
  betrays his country while achieving the most brilliant victories.'</p>

  <p>'I am obliged to say,'I replied, 'that I have wavered in my judgment.
  Sometimes, when I have thought of policy, of the past services of Palmyra,
  and of Persia, I have deemed it hardly possible that Aurelian should have had
  any other purpose in this expedition than to negotiate with Zenobia, under
  the advantages of an armed force; that at the most and worst, a single battle
  would suffice, and the differences which exist be then easily adjusted. But
  then, when again I have thought of the character of Aurelian, I have doubted
  these conclusions, and believed that conquest alone will satisfy him; and
  that he will never turn back till he can call Palmyra a Roman province. From
  what has now transpired at Antioch, and especially from what has not
  transpired, I am strengthened in this last opinion. One or the other must
  fall. I believe it has come to this.'</p>

  <p>'One or the other may fall at Emesa,' said Liviay 'but no power can ever
  force the walls of Palmyra.'</p>

  <p>'I am ready to believe with you, Princess,' said Longinus, 'but I trust
  never to see a Roman army before them. Yet if your last judgment of Aurelian
  be the true one, Piso, it may happen. We are not a power to pour forth the
  hordes of Rome or Germany. We have valor, but not numbers.'</p>

  <p>'Ought not,' said Julia, 'every provision to be made, even though there be
  but the remotest possibility of the city sustaining a siege?'</p>

  <p>'The most fruitful imagination,' replied Longinus, 'could hardly suggest a
  single addition to what is already done, to render Palmyra impregnable. And
  long before the food now within the walls could be exhausted, any army, save
  one of Arabs of the desert, lying before them, must itself perish. But these
  things the council and senate will maturely weigh.'</p>

  <p>Longinus departed.</p>

  <p>At the same moment that he left the apartment, that Indian slave whom I
  have often seen sitting at the feet of the Queen entered where we were, and
  addressing a few words to the Princess Julia again retreated. I could not but
  remark again, what I had remarked before, her graceful beauty, and especially
  the symmetry of her form and elasticity of her step. There was now also an
  expression in the countenance which, notwithstanding its dark beauty, I liked
  not, as I had often before liked it not, when I had seen her in the presence
  of Zenobia.</p>

  <p>'Princess,' said I, 'is the slave who has just departed sincere in her
  attachment to Zenobia?'</p>

  <p>'I cannot doubt it,' she replied; 'at least I have observed nothing to
  cause me to doubt it. Thinking herself injured and degraded by Zenobia, she
  may perhaps feel toward her as the captive feels toward the conqueror. But if
  this be so, the lip breathes it not. To the Queen she is, as far as the eye
  may judge, fondly attached, and faithful to the trusts reposed in her.'</p>

  <p>'But why,'I asked, 'thinks she herself injured and degraded? Is she not
  what she seems to be, a slave?'</p>

  <p>'She is a slave by the chances of fortune and war, not by descent or
  purchase. She was of the household of Sapor, when his tents, wives, and
  slaves fell into the hands of Odenatus, and by him, as we learned, had been
  taken in his wars with an Indian nation. In her own country she was a
  princess, and were she now there, were queen. Zenobia's pride is gratified by
  using her for the purposes she does, nor has it availed to intercede in her
  behalf. Yet has it always seemed as if a strong attachment drew the fair
  slave to our mother, and sure I am that Zenobia greatly esteems her, and,
  save in one respect, maintains and holds her rather as an equal than
  inferior. We all love her. Others beside yourself have questioned her truth,
  but we have heeded them not. Upon what, may I ask, have you founded a doubt
  of her sincerity?'</p>

  <p>'I can scarcely say,'I rejoined, 'that I have ground to doubt her
  sincerity. Indeed, I know nothing of her but what you have now rehearsed,
  except that, a few days since, as I retired from the palace, I observed her
  near the eastern gate in earnest conversation with Antiochus. Soon as her eye
  caught me, although at a great distance, she hastily withdrew into the
  palace, while Antiochus turned toward the neighboring street.'</p>

  <p>Julia smiled. 'Ah,' said she, 'our cousin Antiochus, were he to lose all
  hope of me, would hasten to throw himself at the feet of the beautiful
  Sindarina. When at the palace, his eyes can hardly be drawn from her face. I
  have been told he exalts her above her great mistress. Were Antiochus king, I
  can hardly doubt that Sindarina were queen. His visit to the palace must have
  been to her alone. Livia, have you received him since the departure of
  Zenobia?'</p>

  <p>Her sister had not seen him. I said no more. But never have I read aright
  the human countenance, if in her there be not hidden designs of evil. I knew
  not before this interview her history. This supplies a motive for a
  treacherous turn, if by it her freedom or her fortune might be achieved. I
  have mentioned my suspicions to Longinus, but he sees nothing in them.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The intelligence thus received from Antioch has effectually
sobered the
  giddy citizens of Palmyra. They are now of opinion that war really exists,
  and that they are a party concerned. The merchants, who are the princes of
  the place, perceiving their traffic to decline or cease, begin to interest
  themselves in the affairs of the state. So long as wealth flowed in as ever,
  and the traders from India and Persia saw no obstruction in the state of
  things to a safe transaction of their various businesses and transportation
  of their valuable commodities, the merchants left the state to take care of
  itself, and whatever opinions they held, expressed them only in their own
  circles, thinking but of accumulation by day, and of ostentatious expenditure
  by night. I have often heard, that their general voice, had it been raised,
  would have been hostile to the policy that has prevailed. But it was not
  raised; and now, when too late, and these mercenary and selfish beings are
  driven to some action by the loss of their accustomed gains, a large and
  violent party is forming among them, who loudly condemn the conduct of the
  Queen and her ministers, and advocate immediate submission to whatever terms
  Aurelian may impose. This party however, powerful though it maybe through
  wealth, is weak in numbers. The people are opposed to them, and go
  enthusiastically with the Queen, and do not scruple to exult in the
  distresses of the merchants. Their present impotence is but a just
  retribution upon them for their criminal apathy during the early stages of
  the difficulty. Then had they taken a part as they ought to have done in the
  public deliberations, the rupture which has ensued might, it is quite likely,
  have been prevented. Their voice would have been a loud and strong, one, and
  would have been heard. They deserve to lose their liberties, who will not
  spare time from selfish pursuits to guard them. Where a government is
  popular, even to no greater extent than this, it behooves every individual,
  if he values the power delegated to him and would retain it, to use it,
  otherwise it is by degrees and insensibly lost; and once absorbed into the
  hands of the few, it is not easily, if at all, to be recovered.</p>

  <p>Nothing can exceed the activity displayed on all hands in every
  preparation which the emergency demands. New levies of men are making, and a
  camp again forming to reinforce the Queen, at Emesa, or in its neighborhood,
  if she should not be compelled to retire upon Palmyra. In the mean time, we
  wait with beating hearts for the next arrival of couriers.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">After an anxious suspense of several days all my worst
apprehensions are
  realized. Messengers have arrived, announcing the defeat of Zenobia before
  the walls of Emesa, and with them fugitives from the conquered army are
  pouring in. Every hour now do we expect the approach of the Queen, with the
  remnant of her forces. Our intelligence is in the hand of Zenobia herself.
  She has written thus to her minister.</p>

  <p>'Septimia Zenobia to Dionysius Longinus. I am again defeated. Our cavalry
  were at first victorious, as before at Antioch. The Roman horse were routed.
  But the infantry of Aurelian, in number greatly superior to ours, falling
  upon our ranks when deprived of the support of the cavalry, obtained an easy
  victory; while their horse, rallying and increased by reinforcements from
  Antioch, drove us in turn at all points, penetrating even to our camp, and
  completed the disaster of the day. I have now no power with which to cope
  with Aurelian. It remains but to retreat upon Palmyra, there placing our
  reliance upon the strength of our walls, and upon our Armenian, Saracen, and
  Persian allies. I do not despair, although the favor of the gods seems
  withdrawn. Farewell.'</p>

  <p>The city is in the utmost consternation. All power seems paralysed. The
  citizens stand together in knots at the corners of the streets, like persons
  struck dumb, and without command of either their bodies or then minds. The
  first feeling was, and it was freely expressed, 'To contend further is
  hopeless. The army is destroyed; another cannot now be recruited; and if it
  could, before it were effected, Aurelian would be at the gates with his
  countless legions, and the city necessarily surrender. We must now make the
  best terms we can, and receive passively conditions which we can no longer
  oppose.'</p>

  <p>But soon other sentiments took the place of these, and being urged by
  those who entertained them, with zeal, they have prevailed.</p>

  <p>'Why,' they have urged, 'should we yield before that becomes the only
  alternative? At present we are secure within the walls of our city, which may
  well defy all the power of a besieging army. Those most skilled in such
  matters, and who have visited the places in the world deemed most
  impregnable, assert that the defences of Palmyra are perfect, and surpassed
  by none; and that any army, whether a Roman or any others must perish before
  it would be possible either to force our gates or reduce us by hunger.
  Besides, what could we expect by submitting to the conqueror, but national
  extinction? Our city would be pillaged; our principal citizens murdered;
  perhaps a general slaughter made of the inhabitants, without regard to age or
  sex. The mercies of Rome have ever been cruel; and Aurelian we know to be
  famed for the severity of his temper. No commander of modern times has
  instituted so terrible a discipline in his army, and Rome itself has felt the
  might of his iron hand; it is always on his sword. What can strangers,
  foreigners, enemies, and rebels, as he regards us, expect? And are the people
  of Palmyra ready to abandon their Queen? to whom we owe all this great
  prosperity, this wide renown, this extended empire? But for Zenobia we were
  now what we were so many ages, a petty trading village, a community of
  money-makers, hucksters and barterers, without arts, without science, without
  fame, destitute of all that adorns and elevates a people. Zenobia has raised
  us to empire; it is Zenobia who has made us the conquerors of Persia, and the
  rival of Rome. Shame on those who will desert her! Shame on those who will
  distrust a genius that has hitherto shone with greater lustre in proportion
  to the difficulties that have opposed it! Who can doubt that by lending her
  all our energies and means, she will yet triumph? Shame and death to the
  enemies of the Queen and the State!'</p>

  <p>Sentiments like these are now every where heard, and the courage and
  enthusiasm of the people are rising again. Those who are for war and
  resistance are always the popular party. There is an instinctive love of
  liberty and power, and a horror at the thought of losing them, that come to
  the aid of the weak, and often cause them to resist, under circumstances
  absolutely desperate. Palmyra is not weak, but to one who contemplates both
  parties, and compares their relative strength, it is little short of madness
  to hope to hold out with ultimate success against the power of Rome. But such
  is the determination of the great body of the people. And the Queen, when she
  shall approach with her broken and diminished, and defeated army, will meet
  the welcome of a conqueror. Never before in the history of the world, was
  there so true-hearted a devotion of a whole people to the glory, interests,
  and happiness of One&mdash;and never was such devotion so deserved.</p>

  <p>The Princess Julia possesses herself like one armed for such adversities,
  not by nature, but by reflection and philosophy. She was designed for scenes
  of calmness and peace: but she has made herself equal to times of difficulty,
  tumult and danger. She shrinks not from the duties which her station now
  imposes upon her; but seems like one who possesses resolution enough to reign
  with the vigor and power of Zenobia. Her two brothers, who have remained in
  the city, Herennianus and Timolaus, leave all affairs of state to her and the
  council; they preferring the base pleasures of sensuality, in which they
  wallow day and night in company with Antiochus and his crew. If a deep
  depression is sometimes seen to rest upon her spirit, it comes rather when
  she thinks of her mother, than of herself. She experiences already, through
  her lively sympathies, the grief that will rage in the soul of Zenobia,
  should fortune deprive her of her crown.</p>

  <p>'Zenobia,' she has said to me, 'Zenobia cannot descend from a throne,
  without suffering such as common souls cannot conceive. A goddess driven from
  heaven and the company of the gods could not endure more. To possess and to
  exercise power is to her heaven, to be despoiled of it, Tartarus and death.
  She was born for a throne, though not on one; and how she graces it, you and
  the world have seen. She will display fortitude under adversity and defeat, I
  am sure, and to the common eye, the same soul, vigorous with all its
  energies, will appear to preside over her. But the prospect or expectation of
  a fall from her high place will rack with torments such as no mortal can hope
  to assuage. To witness her grief, without the power to relieve&mdash;I cannot
  bear to think of it!'</p>

  <p>In Livia there is more of the mother. She is proud, imperious, and
  ambitious, in a greater measure even than Zenobia. Young as she is, she
  believes herself of a different nature from others; she born to rule, others
  to serve. It is not the idea of her country and its renown that fills and
  sways her, but of a throne and its attendant glories. So she could reign a
  Queen, with a Queen's state and homage, it would matter little to her whether
  it were in Persia or Palmyra. Yet with those who are her equals is she free,
  and even sportive, light of heart, and overflowing with excess of life. Her
  eye burns with the bright lustre of a star, and her step is that of the
  mistress of a world. She is not terrified at the prospect before her, for her
  confident and buoyant spirit looks down all opposition, and predicts a safe
  egress from the surrounding peril, and an ascent, through this very calamity
  itself, to a position more illustrious still.</p>

  <p>'Julia,' said she, on one occasion of late, while I sat a listener,
  'supposing that the people of Palmyra should set aside our renowned brothers,
  and again prefer a woman's sway, would not you renounce your elder right in
  favor of me? I do not think you would care to be a Queen?'</p>

  <p>'That is true,' replied Julia, 'I should not care to be a Queen; and yet,
  I believe I should reign, that you might not. Though I covet not the exercise
  of power, I believe I should use it more wisely than you would, who do.'</p>

  <p>'I am sure,' said Livia, 'I feel within me that very superiority to
  others, which constitutes the royal character, and would fit me eminently to
  reign. He cannot be a proper slave who has not the soul of a slave. Neither
  can he reign well who has not the soul of a monarch. I am suited to a throne,
  just as others are by the providence of the gods suited to uphold the throne,
  and be the slaves of it.'</p>

  <p>'Were you Queen, Livia, it would be for your own sake; to enjoy the
  pleasures which as you imagine accompany that state, and exercise over others
  the powers with which you were clothed, and receive the homage of dependent
  subjects. Your own magnificence and luxurious state would be your principal
  thought. Is that being suited to a throne?'</p>

  <p>'But,' said Livia, 'I should not be guilty of intentional wrong toward
  any. So long as my people obeyed my laws and supported my government, there
  would be no causes of difficulty. But surely, if there were resistance, and
  any either insulted or opposed my authority, it would be a proper occasion
  for violent measures. For there must be some to govern as well as others to
  obey. All cannot rule. Government is founded in necessity. Kings and queens
  are of nature's making. It would be right then to use utmost severity toward
  such as ceased to obey, as the slave his master. How could the master obtain
  the service of the slave, if there were not reposed in him power to punish?
  Shall the master of millions have less?'</p>

  <p>'Dear Livia, your principles are suited only to some Persian despotism.
  You very soberly imagine, unless you jest, that governments exist for the
  sake of those who govern&mdash;that kings and queens are the objects for
  which governments are instituted,'</p>

  <p>'Truly, it is very much so. Otherwise what would the king or queen of an
  empire be but a poor official, maintained in a sort of state by the people,
  and paid by them for the discharge of a certain set of duties which must be
  performed by some one; but who possesses, in fact, no will nor power of his
  own; rather the servant of the people than their master?'</p>

  <p>'I think,' replied Julia, 'you have given a very just definition of the
  imperial office. A king, queen, or emperor, is indeed the servant of the
  people. He exists not for his own pleasure or glory, but for their good. Else
  he is a tyrant, a despot&mdash;not a sovereign.'</p>

  <p>'It is then,' said Livia, 'only a tyrant or a despot that I would consent
  to be. Not in any bad meaning of the terms; for you know, Julia, that I could
  not be cruel nor unjust. But unless I could reign, as one independent of my
  people, and irresponsible to them not in name only, but in reality above
  them; receiving the homage due to the queenly character and
  office&mdash;would not reign at all. To sit upon a throne, a mere painted
  puppet, shaken by the breath of every conceited or discontented citizen, a
  butt for every shaft to fly at, a mere hireling, a slave in a queen's robe,
  the mouthpiece for others to speak by and proclaim their laws, with no will
  nor power of my own&mdash;no, no! It is not such that Zenobia is.'</p>

  <p>'She is more than that indeed,' replied Julia; 'she is in some sense a
  despot; her will is sovereign in the state; she is an absolute prince in
  fact; but it is through the force of her own character and virtues, not by
  the consent and expressed allowance of her subjects. Her genius, her
  goodness, her justice, and her services, have united to confer upon her this
  dangerous pre- eminence. But who else, with power such as hers, would reign
  as she has reigned? An absolute will, guided by perfect wisdom and goodness,
  constitutes I indeed believe the simplest and best form of human government.
  It is a copy of that of the universe, under the providence of the gods. But
  an absolute will, moved only or chiefly by the selfish love of regal state
  and homage, or by a very defective wisdom and goodness, is on the other hand
  the very worst form of human government. You would make an unequalled queen,
  Livia, if to act the queen were all; if you were but to sit and receive the
  worship of the slaves, your subjects. As you sit now, Lean almost believe you
  Queen of the East! Juno's air was not more imperial, nor the beauty of Venus
  more enslaving. Piso will not dissent from what I began with, or now end
  with.'</p>

  <p>'I think you have delivered a true doctrine,'I replied; 'but which few who
  have once tasted of power will admit. Liberty would be in great danger were
  Livia queen. Her subjects would be too willing to forget their rights,
  through a voluntary homage to her queenly character and state. Their chains
  would however be none the less chains, that they were voluntarily assumed.
  That indeed is the most dangerous slavery which men impose upon themselves,
  for it does not bear the name of slavery, but some other; yet as it is real,
  the character of the slave is silently and unconsciously formed, and then
  unconsciously transmitted.'</p>

  <p>'I perceive,' said Livia, 'if what you philosophers urge be true, that I
  am rather meant by nature for a Persian or a Roman throne than any other. I
  would be absolute, though it were over but a village. A divided and imperfect
  power I would not accept, though it were over the world. But the gods grant
  it long ere any one be called in Palmyra to fill the place of Zenobia!'</p>

  <p>'Happy were it for mankind,' said Julia, 'could she live and reign
  forever.'</p>

  <p>Thus do all differences cease and run into harmony at the name of
  Zenobia.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Every hour do we look for the arrival of the army.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">As I sit writing at my open window, overlooking the street
and spacious
  courts of the Temple of Justice, I am conscious of an unusual
  disturbance&mdash;the people at a distance are running in one
  direction&mdash;the clamor approaches&mdash;and now I hear the cries of the
  multitudes, 'The Queen! the Queen!'</p>

  <p>I fly to the walls.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I resume my pen. The alarm was a true one. Upon gaining the
streets, I
  found the populace all pouring toward the Gate of the Desert, in which
  direction, it was affirmed, the Queen was making her approach. Upon reaching
  it, and ascending one of its lofty towers, I beheld from the verge of the
  horizon to within a mile of the walls, the whole plain filled with the
  scattered forces of Zenobia, a cloud of dust resting over the whole, and
  marking out the extent of ground they covered. As the advanced detachments
  drew near, how different a spectacle did they present from that bright
  morning, when glittering in steel, and full of the fire of expected victory,
  they proudly took their way toward the places from which they now were
  returning, a conquered, spoiled, and dispirited remnant, covered with the
  dust of a long march, and wearily dragging their limbs beneath the rays of a
  burning sun. Yet was there order and military discipline preserved, even
  under circumstances so depressing, and which usually are an excuse for their
  total relaxation. It was the silent, dismal march of a funeral train, rather
  than the hurried flight of a routed and discomfited army. There was the stiff
  and formal military array, but the life and spirit of an elated and proud
  soldiery were gone. They moved with method to the sound of clanging
  instruments, and the long, shrill blast of the trumpet, but they moved as
  mourners, They seemed as if they came to bury their Queen.</p>

  <p>Yet the scene changed to a brighter aspect, as the army drew nearer and
  nearer to the walls, and the city throwing open her gates, the populace burst
  forth, and with loud and prolonged shouts, welcomed them home. These shouts
  sent new life into the hearts of the desponding ranks, and with brightened
  faces and a changed air they waved their arms and banners, and returned shout
  for shout. As they passed through the gates to the ample quarters provided
  within the walls, a thousand phrases of hearty greeting were showered down
  upon them, from those who lined the walls, the towers, and the way-side,
  which seemed, from the effects produced in those on whom they fell, a more
  quickening restorative than could have been any medicine or food that had
  ministered only to the body.</p>

  <p>The impatience of the multitude to behold and receive the Queen was hardly
  to be restrained from breaking forth in some violent way. They were ready to
  rush upon the great avenue, bearing aside the troops, that they might the
  sooner greet her. When, at length, the centre of the army approached, and the
  armed chariot appeared in which Zenobia sat, the enthusiasm of the people
  knew no bounds. They broke through all restraint, and with cries that filled
  the heavens, pressed toward her&mdash;the soldiers catching the frenzy and
  joining them&mdash;and quickly detaching the horses from her carriage,
  themselves drew her into the city just as if she had returned victor with
  Aurelian in her train. There was no language of devotion and loyalty that did
  not meet her ear, nor any sign of affection that could be made from any
  distance, from the plains, the walls, the gates, the higher buildings of the
  city, the roofs of which were thronged, that did not meet her eye. It was a
  testimony of love so spontaneous and universal, a demonstration of confidence
  and unshaken attachment so hearty and sincere, that Zenobia was more than
  moved by it, she was subdued&mdash;and she who, by her people, had never
  before been seen to weep, bent her head and buried her face in her hands.</p>

  <p>With what an agony of expectation, while this scene was passing, did I
  await the appearance of Fausta, and Gracchus, and Calpurnius&mdash;if,
  indeed, I were destined ever to see them again. I waited long, and with pain,
  but the gods be praised, not in vain, nor to meet with disappointment only.
  Not far in the rear of Zenobia, at the head of a squadron of cavalry, rode,
  as my eye distinctly informed me, those whom I sought. No sooner did they in
  turn approach the gates, than almost the same welcome that had been lavished
  upon Zenobia, was repeated for Fausta, Gracchus, and Calpurnius. The names of
  Calpurnius and Fausta&mdash;of Calpurnius, as he who had saved the army at
  Antioch, of Fausta as the intrepid and fast friend of the Queen, were
  especially heard from a thousand lips, joined with every title of honor. My
  voice was not wanting in the loud acclaim. It reached the ears of Fausta,
  who, starting and looking upward, caught my eye just as she passed beneath
  the arch of the gateway. I then descended from my tower of observation, and
  joined the crowds who thronged the close ranks, as they filed along the
  streets of the city. I pressed upon the steps of my friends, never being able
  to keep my eyes from the forms of those I loved so well, whom I had so feared
  to lose, and so rejoiced to behold returned alive and unhurt.</p>

  <p>All day the army has continued pouring into the city, and beside the army
  greater crowds still of the inhabitants of the suburbs, who, knowing that
  before another day shall end, the Romans may encamp before the walls, are
  scattering in all directions&mdash;multitudes taking refuge in the city, but
  greater numbers still, mounted upon elephants, camels, dromedaries and
  horses, flying into the country to the north. The whole region as far as the
  eye can reach, seems in commotion, as if society were dissolved, and breaking
  up from its foundations. The noble and the rich, whose means are ample,
  gather together their valuables, and with their children and friends seek the
  nearest parts of Mesopotamia, where they will remain in safety till the siege
  shall be raised. The poor, and such as cannot reach the Euphrates, flock into
  the city, bringing with them what little of provisions or money they may
  possess, and are quartered upon the inhabitants, or take up a temporary abode
  in the open squares, or in the courts and porticos of palaces and
  temples&mdash;the softness and serenity of the climate rendering even so much
  as the shelter of a tent superfluous. But by this vast influx the population
  of the city cannot be less than doubled, and I should tremble for the means
  of subsistence for so large a multitude, did I not know the inexhaustible
  magazines of grain, laid up by the prudent foresight of the Queen, in
  anticipation of the possible occurrence of the emergency which has now
  arrived. A long time&mdash;longer than he himself would be able to subsist
  his army&mdash;must Aurelian lie before Palmyra ere he can hope to reduce it
  by famine. What impression his engines may be able to make upon the walls,
  remains to be seen. Periander pronounces the city impregnable. My own
  judgment, formed upon a comparison of it with the cities most famous in the
  world for the strength of their defences, would agree with his.</p>

  <p>Following on in the wake of the squadron to which Fausta was attached, I
  wished to reach the camp at the same time with herself and Gracchus and my
  brother, but owing to the press in the streets, arising from the causes just
  specified, I was soon separated from, and lost sight of it. Desirous however
  to meet them, I urged my way along with much labor till I reached the quarter
  of the city assigned to the troops, where I found the tents and the open
  ground already occupied. I sought in vain for Fausta. While I waited, hoping
  still to see her, I stood leaning upon a pile of shields, which the soldiers,
  throwing off their arms, had just made, and watching them as they were, some
  disencumbering themselves of their armor, others unclasping the harness of
  their horses, others arranging their weapons into regular forms, and others,
  having gone through their first tasks, were stretching themselves at rest
  beneath the shadow of their tents, or of some branching tree. Near me sat a
  soldier, who, apparently too fatigued to rid himself of his heavy armor, had
  thrown himself upon the ground, and was just taking off his helmet, and
  wiping the dust and sweat from his face, while a little boy, observing his
  wants, ran to a neighboring fountain, and filling a vessel with water,
  returned and held it to him, saying, 'Drink, soldier this will make you
  stronger than your armor.'</p>

  <p>'You little traitor,' said the soldier,' art not ashamed to bring drink to
  me, who have helped to betray the city? Beware, or a sharp sword will cut you
  in two.'</p>

  <p>'I thought,' replied the child, nothing daunted, 'that you were a soldier
  of Palmyra, who had been to fight the Romans. But whoever you may be, I am
  sure you need the water.'</p>

  <p>'But,' rejoined the soldier, swallowing at long draughts as if it had been
  nectar, the cooling drink, 'do I deserve water, or any of these cowards here,
  who have been beaten by the Romans, and so broken the heart of our good
  Queen, and possibly lost her her throne? Answer me that.'</p>

  <p>'You have done what you could, I know,' replied the boy, 'because you are
  a Palmyrene, and who can do more? I carry round the streets of the city in
  this palm-leaf basket, date cakes, which I sell to those who love them. But
  does my mother blame me because I do not always come home with an empty
  basket? I sell what I can. Should I be punished for doing what I cannot?'</p>

  <p>'Get you gone, you rogue,' replied the soldier; 'you talk like a Christian
  boy, and they have a new way of returning good for evil. But here, if you
  have cakes in your basket, give me one and I will give you a penny all the
  way from Antioch. See! there is the head of Aurelian on it. Take care he
  don't eat you up&mdash;or at least your cakes. But hark you, little boy, do
  you see yonder that old man with a bald head, leaning against his shield? go
  to him with your cakes.'</p>

  <p>The boy ran off.</p>

  <p>'Friend,' said I, addressing him, 'your march has not lost you your
  spirits; you can jest yet.'</p>

  <p>'Truly I can. If the power to do that were gone, then were all lost. A
  good jest in a time of misfortune is food and drink. It is strength to the
  arm, digestion to the stomach, courage to the heart. It is better than wisdom
  or wine. A prosperous man may afford to be melancholy, but if the miserable
  are so, they are worse than dead&mdash;but it is sure to kill them. Near me I
  had a comrade whose wit it was alone that kept life in me upon the desert.
  All the way from Emesa, had it not been for the tears of laughter, those of
  sorrow and shame would have killed me.'</p>

  <p>'But in the words of the little cake urchin, you did what you could. The
  fates were opposed to you.'</p>

  <p>'If all had done as much and as well as some, we would have had the fates
  in our own keeping. Had it not been for that artifice of the Romans at
  Antioch, we, had now been rather in Rome than here, and it was a
  woman&mdash;or girl rather, as I am told&mdash;the daughter of Gracchus, who
  first detected the cheat, and strove to save the army, but it was too
  late.'</p>

  <p>'Were you near her?'</p>

  <p>'Was I not? Not the great Zabdas himself put more mettle into the troops
  than did that fiery spirit and her black horse. And beyond a doubt, she would
  have perished through an insane daring, had not the Queen in time called her
  from the field, and afterward kept her within her sight and reach. Her
  companion, a Roman turned Palmyrene as I heard, was like one palsied when she
  was gone, till when, he had been the very Mars of the field. As it was, he
  was the true hero of the day. He brought to my mind Odenatus, 'Twas so he
  looked that day we entered Ctesiphon I could wish, and hope too, that he
  might share the throne of Zenobia, but that all the world knows what a
  man-hater she is. But were you not there?'</p>

  <p>'No. It could not be. I remained in the city.'</p>

  <p>'Ten thousand more of such men as you&mdash;and we would not have fallen
  back upon Emesa, nor left Antioch without the head of Aurelian. But alas for
  it, the men of Palmyra are men of silk, and love their pleasures too well to
  be free. I should call them women, but for Zenobia and the daughter of
  Gracchus.'</p>

  <p>'Do not take me for one of them. I am a Roman&mdash;and could not fight
  against my country.'</p>

  <p>'A Roman! and what makes you here? Suppose I were to run you through with
  this spear?'</p>

  <p>'Give me another and you are welcome to try.'</p>

  <p>'Am I so? Then will I not do it. Give a man his will and he no longer
  cares for it. Besides, having escaped with hazard from the clutches of one
  Roman, I will not encounter another. Dost thou know that demon Aurelian? Half
  who fell, fell by his hand. His sword made no more of a man in steel armor,
  than mine would of a naked slave. Many a tall Palmyrene did he split to the
  saddle, falling both ways. The ranks broke and fled wherever he appeared.
  Death could not keep pace with him. The Roman Piso&mdash;of our
  side&mdash;sought him over the field, to try his fortune with him, but the
  gods protected him, and he found him not: otherwise his body were now food
  for hyenas. No arm of mortal mould can cope with his, Mine is not despicable:
  there is not its match in Palmyra: but I would not encounter Aurelian unless
  I were in love with death.'</p>

  <p>'It is as you say, I well know. He is reputed in our army to have killed
  more with his single arm in battle, than any known in Roman history. Our camp
  resounds with songs which celebrate his deeds of blood. His slain are counted
  by thousands, nothing less.'</p>

  <p>'The gods blast him, ere he be seen before the walls of Palmyra; our
  chance were better against double the number of legions under another
  general. The general makes the soldier. The Roman infantry are so many
  Aurelians. Yet to- morrow's sun will see him here. I am free to say, I
  tremble for Palmyra. A war ill begun, will, if auguries are aught, end worse.
  Last night the sky was full of angry flashes, both white and red. While the
  army slept over-wrought upon the desert, and the silence of death was around,
  the watches heard sounds as of the raging of a battle, distinct and clear,
  dying away in groans as of a host perishing under the sword and battle-axe.
  These horrid sounds at length settled over the sleeping men, till it seemed
  as if they proceeded from them. The sentinels&mdash;at first struck dumb with
  terror and amazement&mdash;called out to one another to know what it should
  mean, but they could only confirm to each other what had been heard, and
  together ask the protection of the gods. But what strikes deeper yet, is what
  you have heard, that the Queen's far-famed Numidian, just as we came in sight
  of the walls of the city, stumbled, and where he stumbled, fell and died.
  What these things forebode, if not disaster and ruin, 'tis hard to say. I
  need no one to read them to me.'</p>

  <p>Saying thus, he rose and began to divest himself of the remainder of his
  heavy armor, saying, as he did it&mdash;'It was this heavy armor that lost us
  the day at Antioch&mdash;lighter, and we could have escaped the meshes. Now
  let me lie and sleep.'</p>

  <p>Returning, hardly had I arrived at the house of Gracchus, when it was
  announced in loud shouts by the slaves of the palace, that Gracchus himself,
  Fausta and Calpurnius were approaching. I hastened to the portico overlooking
  the court-yard, and was there just in season to assist Fausta to dismount. It
  was a joyful moment I need scarce assure you. Fausta returns wholly unhurt.
  Gracchus is wounded upon his left, and Calpurnius upon his right
  arm&mdash;but will not long suffer from the injury.</p>

  <p>It was an unspeakable joy, once more to hear the cheerful voice of
  Gracchus resounding in the walls of his own dwelling, and to see Fausta,
  eased of her unnatural load of iron, again moving in her accustomed sphere in
  that graceful costume, partly Roman and partly Persian, and which now hides
  and now betrays the form, so as to reveal its beauty in the most perfect
  manner. A deep sadness, deeper than ever, sits upon her countenance, whenever
  her own thoughts occupy her. But surrounded by her friends, her native
  spirit, too elastic to be subdued, breaks forth, and she seems her former
  self again.</p>

  <p>Our evening meal was sad, but not silent.</p>

  <p>Gracchus instructed me, by giving a minute narrative of the march to
  Antioch&mdash;of the two battles&mdash;and the retreat. Calpurnius related
  with equal exactness the part which he took, and the services which Fausta,
  by her penetrating observation, had been able to render to the army. They
  united in bestowing the highest encomiums upon Zenobia, who herself planned
  the battle, and disposed the forces, and with such consummate judgment, that
  Zabdas himself found nothing to disapprove or alter.</p>

  <p>'The day was clearly ours,' said Fausta, 'but for the artifice of
  Aurelian&mdash;allowable, I know, by all the rules of war&mdash;by which we
  were led on blindfold to our ruin. But flushed as we were by the early and
  complete success of the day, is it to be severely condemned that our brave
  men followed up their advantages with too much confidence, and broke from
  that close order, in which till then, they had fought; and by doing so, lost
  the command of themselves and their own strength? O, the dulness of our
  spirits, that we did not sooner detect the rank insincerity of that sudden,
  unexpected retreat of the Roman horse!'</p>

  <p>'The gods rather be praised,' said Gracchus, 'that your watchful eye
  detected so soon, what was too well concerted and acted to be perceived at
  all, and that as the fruit of it we sit here alive, and Zenobia holds her
  throne, and so many of our brave soldiers are now locked in sleep beneath
  their quiet tents.'</p>

  <p>'That, I think,' said Calpurnius, 'is rather the sentiment that should
  possess us. You will hardly believe, Lucius, that it was owing to the
  military genius of your ancient playmate, that we escaped the certain
  destruction that had been prepared for us?'</p>

  <p>'I can believe any thing good in that quarter, and upon slighter
  testimony. I have already heard from the lips of a soldier of your legion,
  that which you have now related. Part of the praise was by him bestowed upon
  one Piso, a Roman turned Palmyrene as he termed him, who, he reported, fought
  at the side of the daughter of Gracchus.'</p>

  <p>'He could not have said too much of that same Piso,' said Gracchus.
  'Palmyra owes him a large debt of gratitude, which I am sure she will not be
  slow to pay. But let us think rather of the future than of the past, which,
  however we may have conducted, speaks only of disaster.'</p>

  <p>I thank you for your assurances concerning Laco and Coelia. Your
  conscience will never reproach you for this lenity.</p>

  <h2><a name="letter14"
     id="letter14">LETTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE last days of this so lately favored empire draw
near&mdash;at least
  such is my judgment. After a brief day of glory, its light will set in a long
  night of utter darkness and ruin.</p>

  <p>Close upon the rear guard of the Queen's forces followed the light troops
  of Aurelian, and early this morning it was proclaimed that the armies of Rome
  were in sight, and fast approaching the city. These armies were considered
  too numerous to hazard another battle, therefore the gates were shut, and we
  are now beleaguered by a power too mighty to contend with, and which the
  Arabs, the climate, and want, must be trusted to subdue. The circumjacent
  plains are filled with the legions of Rome. Exhausted, by the march across
  the desert, they have but pitched their tents, and now repose.</p>

  <p>The Queen displays more than ever her accustomed activity and energy. She
  examines in person every part of the vast extent of wall, and every engine
  planted upon them for their defence. By her frequent presence in every part
  of the city she inspires her soldiers with the same spirit which possesses
  herself; and for herself, to behold her careering through the streets of the
  city, reviewing, and often addressing, the different divisions of the army,
  and issuing her commands, she seems rather like one who is now Queen of the
  East, and is soon to be of the world, than one whose dominion is already
  narrowed down to the compass of a single city, and may shortly be deprived
  even of that. The lofty dignity of her air has assumed a more imposing
  greatness still. The imperial magnificence of her state is noways diminished,
  but rather increased, so that by a sort of delusion of the senses, she seems
  more a Queen than ever. By her native vigor and goodness, and by the addition
  of a most consummate art, by which she manages as she will a people whom she
  perfectly comprehends, she is at this moment more deeply intrenched within
  the affections of her subjects, and more completely the object of their
  idolatrous homage than ever before. Yet in her secret soul there is a deep
  depression, and a loss of confidence in her cause, which amounts not yet to a
  loss of hope, but approaches it. This is seen by those who can observe her in
  her more quiet hours, when the glare of public action and station is off, and
  her mind is left to its own workings. But, like those who play at dice, she
  has staked all&mdash;her kingdom, her crown&mdash;her life perhaps&mdash;upon
  a single throw, and having wound herself up to the desperate act, all the
  entreaty or argument of the whole earth could not move her to unclasp the
  hand that wields the fatal box. She will abide the throw.</p>

  <p>There are still those who use both intreaty and argument to persuade her
  even at this late hour to make the best terms she may with Rome. Otho, though
  perfectly loyal and true, ceases not to press upon her, both in public and in
  private, those considerations which may have any weight with her to induce a
  change of measures. But it has thus far been to no purpose. Others there are
  who, as the danger increases, become more and more restless, and scruple not
  to let their voice be heard in loud complaint and discontent, but they are
  too few in proportion to the whole, to make them objects of apprehension. It
  will however be strange if, as the siege is prolonged, they do not receive
  such accessions of strength as to render them dangerous.</p>

  <p>The Emperor has commenced his attacks upon the city in a manner that shows
  him unacquainted with its strength. The battle has raged fiercely all day,
  with great loss we infer to the Romans, with none we know to the
  Palmyrenes.</p>

  <p>Early on the morning of the second day it was evident that a general
  assault was to be made. The Roman army completely surrounded the city, at the
  same signal approached, and under cover of their shields, attempted both to
  undermine and scale the walls. But their attempts were met with such vigor,
  and with such advantage of action by the besieged, that although repeated
  many times during the day, they have resulted in only loss and death to the
  assailants. It is incredible the variety and ingenuity of the contrivances by
  which the Queen's forces beat off and rendered ineffectual all the successive
  movements of the enemy, in their attempts to surmount the walls. Not only
  from every part of them were showers of arrows discharged from the bows of
  experienced archers, but from engines also, by which they were driven to a
  much greater distance, and with great increase of force.</p>

  <p>This soon rendered every attack of this nature useless and worse, and
  their efforts were then concentrated upon the several gates, which
  simultaneously were attempted to be broken in, fired, or undermined. But here
  again, as often as these attempts were renewed, were they defeated, and great
  destruction made of those engaged in them. The troops approached as is usual,
  covered completely, or buried rather, beneath their shields. They were
  suffered to form directly under the walls, and actually commence their work
  of destruction, when suddenly from the towers of the gates, and through
  channels constructed for the purpose in every part of the masonry, torrents
  of liquid fire were poured upon the iron roof, beneath which the soldiers
  worked. This at first they endured. The melted substances ran off from the
  polished surface of the shields, and the stones which were dashed upon them
  from engines, after rattling and bounding over their heads, rolled harmless
  to the ground. But there was in reserve a foe which they could not encounter.
  When it was found that the fiery streams flowed down the slanting sides of
  the shell, penetrating scarcely at all through the crevices of the
  well-joined shields, it was suggested by the ingenious Periander, that there
  should first be thrown down a quantity of pitch in a half melted state, by
  which the whole surface of the roof should be completely covered, and which
  should then, by a fresh discharge of fire, be set in a blaze, the effect of
  which must be to heat the shields to such a degree, that they could neither
  be held, nor the heat beneath endured by the miners. This was immediately
  resorted to at all the gates, and the success was complete. For no sooner was
  the cold pitch set on fire and constantly fed by fresh quantities from above,
  than the heat became insupportable to those below, who suddenly letting go
  their hold, and breaking away from their compacted form, in hope to escape
  from the stifling heat, the burning substance then poured in upon them, and
  vast numbers perished miserably upon the spot, or ran burning, and howling
  with pain, toward the camp. The slaughter made was very great, and terrible
  to behold.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the next day the same attempts were renewed, in the hope, we
  supposed, that the Queen's missiles might be expended, but were defeated
  again in the same manner and with like success.</p>

  <p>These things being so, and Aurelian being apparently convinced that the
  city cannot be taken by storm, the enemy are now employed in surrounding it
  with a double ditch and rampart, as defences both against us and our allies,
  between which the army is to be safely encamped; an immense labor, to which I
  believe a Roman army is alone equal. While this has been doing, the
  Palmyrenes have made frequent sallies from the gates, greatly interrupting
  the progress of the work, and inflicting severe losses. These attacks have
  usually been made at night, when the soldiers have been wearied by the
  exhausting toil of the day, and only a small proportion of the whole have
  been in a condition to ward off the blows.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The Roman works are at length completed. Every lofty palm
tree, every
  cedar, every terebinth, has disappeared from the surrounding plains, to be
  converted into battering rams, or wrought into immense towers, fire and
  constantly fed by fresh quantities from above, than the heat became
  insupportable to those below, who suddenly letting go their hold, and
  breaking away from their compacted form, in hope to escape from the stifling
  heat, the burning substance then poured in upon them, and vast numbers
  perished miserably upon the spot, or ran burning, and howling with pain,
  toward the camp. The slaughter made was very great, and terrible to
  behold.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the next day the same attempts were renewed, in the hope, we
  supposed, that the Queen's missiles might be expended, but were defeated
  again in the same manner and with like success.</p>

  <p>These things being so, and Aurelian being apparently convinced that the
  city cannot be taken by storm, the enemy are now employed in surrounding it
  with a double ditch and rampart, as defences both against us and our allies,
  between which the army is to be safely encamped; an immense labor, to which I
  believe a Roman army is alone equal. While this has been doing, the
  Palmyrenes have made frequent sallies from the gates, greatly interrupting
  the progress of the work, and inflicting severe losses. These attacks have
  usually been made at night, when the soldiers have been wearied by the
  exhausting toil of the day, and only a small proportion of the whole have
  been in a condition to ward off the blows.</p>

  <p>The Roman works are at length completed. Every lofty palm tree, every
  cedar, every terebinth, has disappeared from the surrounding plains, to be
  converted into battering rams, or wrought into immense towers, fired, if
  possible, by means of well-barbed arrows and javelins, to which were attached
  sacs and balls of inflammable and explosive substances. These fastening
  themselves upon every part of the tower could not fail to set fire to them
  while yet at some distance, and in extinguishing which the water and other
  means provided for that purpose would be nearly or quite exhausted, before
  they had reached the walls. Then as they came within easier reach, the
  engines were to belch forth those rivers of oil, fire, and burning pitch,
  which he was sure no structure, unless of solid iron, could withstand.</p>

  <p>These directions were carefully observed, and their success at every point
  such as Periander had predicted. At the Gate of the Desert the most
  formidable preparations were made, under the inspection of the Emperor
  himself, who, at a distance, could plainly be discerned directing the work
  and encouraging the soldiers. Two towers of enormous size were here
  constructed, and driven toward the walls. Upon both, as they came within the
  play of the engines, were showered the fiery javelins and arrows, which it
  required all the activity of the occupants to ward off, or extinguish where
  they had succeeded in fastening themselves. One was soon in flames. The
  other, owing either to its being of a better construction, or to a less
  vigorous discharge of fire on the part of the defenders of the wall, not only
  escaped the more distant storm of blazing missiles, but succeeded in
  quenching the floods of burning pitch and oil, which, as it drew nearer and
  nearer, were poured upon it in fiery streams. On it moved, propelled by its
  invisible and protected power, and had now reached the wall; the bridge was
  in the very act of being thrown and grappled to the ramparts; Aurelian was
  seen pressing forward the legions, who, as soon as it should be fastened,
  were to pour up its flights of steps and out upon the walls; when, to the
  horror of all, not less of the besiegers than of the besieged, its
  foundations upon one side&mdash;being laid over the moat&mdash;suddenly gave
  way, and the towering and enormous mass, with all its living burden, fell
  thundering to the plain. A shout, as of a delivered and conquering army, went
  up from the walls, while upon the legions below, such as had not been crushed
  by the tumbling ruin, and who endeavored to save themselves by flight, a
  sudden storm of stones, rocks, burning pitch, and missiles of a thousand
  kinds was directed, that left few to escape to tell the tale of death to
  their comrades. Aurelian, in his fury, or his desire to aid the fallen,
  approaching too near the walls, was himself struck by a well- directed shaft,
  wounded, and borne from the field.</p>

  <p>At the other gates, where similar assaults had been made, the same success
  attended the Palmyrenes. The towers were in each instance set on fire and
  destroyed.</p>

  <p>The city has greatly exulted at the issue of these repeated contests.
  Every sound and sign of triumph has been made upon the walls. Banners have
  been waved to and fro, trumpets have been blown, and in bold defiance of
  their power, parties of horse have sallied out from the gates, and after
  careering in sight of the enemy, have returned again within the walls. The
  enemy are evidently dispirited, and already weary of the work they have
  undertaken.</p>

  <p>The Queen and her ministers are confident of success, so far as active
  resistance of the attacks upon the walls is concerned&mdash;and perhaps with
  reason. For not even the walls of Rome, as they are now re-building, can be
  of greater strength than these; and never were the defences of a besieged
  city so complete at all points. But with equal reason are they despondent in
  the prospect of Aurelian's reducing them by want. If he shall succeed in
  procuring supplies for his army, and if he shall defeat the allies of the
  Queen, who are now every day looked for, captivity and ruin are sure. But the
  Queen and the citizens entertain themselves with the hope, that Aurelian's
  fiery temper will never endure the slow and almost disgraceful process of
  starving them into a surrender, and that finding his army constantly
  diminishing through the effects of such extraordinary exertions in a climate
  like this, he will at length propose such terms as they without dishonor can
  accept.</p>

  <p>Many days have passed in inactivity on both sides; except that nothing can
  exceed the strictness with which all approaches to the city are watched, and
  the possibility of supplies reaching it cut off.</p>

  <p>That which has been expected has come to pass. The Emperor has offered
  terms of surrender to the Queen; but such terms, and so expressed, that their
  acceptance was not so much as debated. The Queen was in council with her
  advisers, when it was announced that a herald from the Roman camp was seen
  approaching the walls. The gates were ordered to be opened, and the messenger
  admitted. He was conducted to the presence of the Queen, surrounded by her
  ministers.</p>

  <p>'I come,' said he, as he advanced toward Zenobia, 'bearing a letter from
  the Emperor of Rome to the Queen of Palmyra. Here it is.'</p>

  <p>'I receive it gladly,' replied the Queen, 'and hope that it may open a way
  to an honorable composition of the difficulties which now divide us.
  Nichomachus, break the seals and read its contents.'</p>

  <p>The secretary took the epistle from the hands of the herald, and opening,
  read that which follows:</p>

  <p>'Aurelian, Emperor of Rome and Conqueror of the East, to Zenobia and her
  companions in arms.</p>

  <p>'You ought of your own accord long since to have done, what now by this
  letter I enjoin and command. And what I now enjoin and command is this, an
  immediate surrender of the city; but with assurance of life to yourself and
  your friends; you, O Queen, with your friends, to pass your days where the
  senate, in its sovereign will, shall please to appoint. The rights of every
  citizen shall be respected, upon condition that all precious stones, silver,
  gold, silk, horses and camels be delivered into the hands of the Romans.'</p>

  <p>As the secretary finished these words the Queen broke
  forth,&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>'What think you, good friends?'&mdash;her mounting color and curled lip
  showing the storm that raged within&mdash;'What think you? Is it a man or a
  god who has written thus? Can it be a mortal who speaks in such terms to
  another? By the soul of Odenatus, but I think it must be the God of War
  himself. Slave, what sayest thou?'</p>

  <p>'I am but the chosen bearer,'the herald replied, 'of what I took from the
  hands of the Emperor. But between him and the god just named there is, as I
  deem, but small difference.'</p>

  <p>'That's well said,' replied the Queen; 'there's something of the old Roman
  in thee. Friends,' she continued, turning to her counsellors, 'what answer
  shall we send to this lordly command? What is your advice?'</p>

  <p>'Mine is,' said Zabdas, 'that the Queen set her foot upon the accursed
  scroll, and that yonder wretch that bore it be pitched headlong from the
  highest tower upon the walls, and let the wind from his rotting carcass bear
  back our only answer.'</p>

  <p>'Nay, nay, brave Zabdas,' said the Queen, the fury of her general having
  the effect to restore her own self-possession, 'thou wouldst not counsel so.
  War then doubles its wo and guilt, when cruelty and injustice bear sway.
  Otho, what sayest thou?'</p>

  <p>'Answer it in its own vein! You smile, Queen, as if incredulous. But I
  repeat&mdash;answer it in its own vein! I confess an inward disappointment
  and an inward change. I hoped much from terms which a wise man might at this
  point propose, and soil neither his own nor his country's honor. But
  Aurelian&mdash;I now see&mdash;is not such a one. He is but the spoiled child
  of fortune. He has grown too quickly great to grow well. Wisdom has had no
  time to ripen.'</p>

  <p>Others concurring, Zenobia seized a pen and wrote that which I
  transcribe.</p>

  <p>'Zenobia, Queen of the East? to Aurelian Augustus.</p>

  <p>'No one before you ever thought to make a letter serve instead of a
  battle. But let me tell you, whatever is won in war, is won by bravery, not
  by letters. You ask me to surrender&mdash;as if ignorant that Cleopatra chose
  rather to die, than, surrendering, to live in the enjoyment of every honor.
  Our Persian allies will not fail me. I look for them every hour. The Saracens
  are with me&mdash;the Armenians are with me. The Syrian robbers have already
  done you no little damage. What then can you expect, when these allied armies
  are upon you? You will lay aside I think a little of that presumption with
  which you now command me to surrender, as if you were already conqueror of
  the whole world.'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The letter being written and approved by those who were
present, it was
  placed by Nichomachus in the hands of the herald.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">No one can marvel, my Curtius, that a letter in the terms
of Aurelian's
  should be rejected, nor that it should provoke such an answer as Zenobia's.
  It has served merely to exasperate passions which were already enough
  excited. It was entirely in the power of the Emperor to have terminated the
  contest, by the proposal of conditions which Palmyra would have gladly
  accepted, and by which Rome would have been more profited and honored than it
  can be by the reduction and ruin of a city and kingdom like this. But it is
  too true, that Aurelian is rather a soldier than an Emperor. A victory got by
  blood is sweeter far to him, I fear, than tenfold wider conquests won by
  peaceful negotiations.</p>

  <p>The effect of the taunting and scornful answer of the Queen has been
  immediately visible in the increased activity and stir in the camp of
  Aurelian. Preparations are going on for renewed assaults upon the walls upon
  a much larger scale than before.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">On the evening of the day on which the letter of Aurelian
was received and
  answered, I resorted, according to my custom during the siege, to a part of
  the walls not far from the house of Gracchus, whence an extended view is had
  of the Roman works and camp. Fausta, as often before, accompanied me. She
  delights thus at the close of these weary, melancholy days, to walk forth,
  breathe the reviving air, observe the condition of the city, and from the
  towers upon the walls, watch the movements and labors of the enemy. The night
  was without moon or stars. Low and heavy clouds hung, but did not move, over
  our heads. The air was still, nay, rather dead, so deep was its repose.</p>

  <p>'How oppressive is this gloom,' said Fausta, as we came forth upon the
  ramparts, and took our seat where the eye could wander unobstructed over the
  plain, 'and yet how gaily illuminated is this darkness by yonder belt of
  moving lights. It seems like the gorgeous preparation for a funeral. Above us
  and behind it is silent and dark. These show like the torches of the
  approaching mourners. The gods grant there be no omen in this.'</p>

  <p>'I know not,'I replied. 'It may be so. To-day has, I confess it, destroyed
  the last hope in my mind that there might come a happy termination to this
  unwise and unnecessary contest. It can end now only in the utter defeat and
  ruin of one of the parties&mdash;and which that shall be I cannot doubt.
  Listen, Fausta, to the confused murmur that comes from the camp of the Roman
  army, bearing witness to its numbers; and to those sounds of the hammer, the
  axe, and the saw, plied by ten thousand arms, bearing witness to the activity
  and exhaustless resources of the enemy, and you cannot but feel, that at
  last&mdash;it may be long first&mdash;but that at last, Palmyra must give
  way. From what has been observed to-day, there is not a doubt that Aurelian
  has provided, by means of regular caravans to Antioch, for a constant supply
  of whatever his army requires. Reinforcements too, both of horse and foot,
  are seen daily arriving, in such numbers as more than to make good those who
  have been lost under the walls, or by the excessive heats of the
  climate.'</p>

  <p>'I hear so,' said Fausta, 'but I will not despair. If I have one absorbing
  love, it is for Palmyra. It is the land of my birth, of my affections. I
  cannot tell you with what pride I have watched its growth, and its daily
  advancement in arts and letters, and have dwelt in fancy upon that future,
  when it should rival Rome, and surpass the traditionary glories of Babylon
  and Nineveh. O Lucius! to see now a black pall descending&mdash;these swollen
  clouds are an emblem of it&mdash;and settling upon the prospect and veiling
  it forever in death and ruin&mdash;I cannot believe it. It cannot have come
  to this. It is treason to give way to such fears. Where Zenobia is, final
  ruin cannot come.'</p>

  <p>'It ought not, I wish it could not,'I replied, 'but my fears are that it
  will, and my fears now are convictions. Where now, my dear Fausta, are the so
  certainly expected reliefs from Armenia, from Persia?&mdash;Fausta, Palmyra
  must fall.'</p>

  <p>'Lucius Piso, Palmyra shall not fall&mdash;I say it&mdash;and every
  Palmyrene says it&mdash;and what all say, is decreed. If we are true in our
  loyalty and zeal, the Romans will be wearied out. Lucius, could I but reach
  the tent of Aurelian, my single arm should rid Palmyra of her foe, and
  achieve her freedom.'</p>

  <p>'No, Fausta, you could not do it.'</p>

  <p>'Indeed I would and could. I would consent to draw infamy upon my head as
  a woman, if by putting off my sex and my nature too, I could by such an act
  give life to a dying nation, and what is as much, preserve Zenobia her
  throne.'</p>

  <p>'Think not in that vein, Fausta. I would not that your mind should be
  injured even by the thought.'</p>

  <p>'I do not feel it to be an injury,' she rejoined; 'it would be a sacrifice
  for my country, and the dearer, in that I should lose my good name in making
  it. I should be sure of one thing, that I should do it in no respect for my
  own glory. But let us talk no more of it. I often end, Lucius, when thinking
  of our calamities, and of a fatal termination of these contests to us, with
  dwelling upon one bright vision. Misfortune to us will bring you nearer to
  Julia.'</p>

  <p>'The gods forbid that my happiness should be bought at such a price!'</p>

  <p>'It will only come as an accidental consequence, and cannot disturb you.
  If Palmyra falls, the pride of Zenobia will no longer separate you.'</p>

  <p>'But,'I replied, 'the prospect is not all so bright. Captive princes are
  by the usages of Rome often sacrificed, and Aurelian, if sometimes generous,
  is often cruel. Fears would possess me in the event of a capitulation or
  conquest, which I cannot endure to entertain.'</p>

  <p>'O Lucius, you rate Aurelian too low, if you believe he could revenge
  himself upon a woman&mdash;and such a woman as Zenobia. I cannot believe it
  possible. No. If Palmyra falls it will give you Julia, and it will be some
  consolation even in the fall of a kingdom, that it brings happiness to two,
  whom friendship binds closer to me than any others.'</p>

  <p>As Fausta said these words, we became conscious of the presence of a
  person at no great distance from us, leaning against the parapet of the wall,
  the upper part of the form just discernible.</p>

  <p>'Who stands yonder?' said Fausta. 'It has not the form of a sentinel;
  besides, the sentinel paces by us to and fro without pausing. It may be
  Calpurnius, His legion is in this quarter. Let us move toward him.'</p>

  <p>'No. He moves himself and comes toward us. How dark the night! I can make
  nothing of the form.'</p>

  <p>The figure passed us, and unchallenged by the sentinel whom it met. After
  a brief absence it returned, and stopping as it came before us&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Fausta!' said a voice&mdash;once heard, not to be mistaken.</p>

  <p>'Zenobia!' said Fausta, and forgetting dignity, embraced her as a
  friend.</p>

  <p>'What makes you here?' inquired Fausta;&mdash;'are there none in Palmyra
  to do your bidding, but you must be abroad at such an hour and such a
  place?'</p>

  <p>''Tis not so fearful quite,' replied the Queen, 'as a battle-field, and
  there you trust me.'</p>

  <p>'Never, willingly.'</p>

  <p>'Then you do not love my honor?' said the Queen, taking Fausta's hand as
  she spoke.</p>

  <p>'I love your safety better&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;what have I
  said&mdash;not better than your honor&mdash;and yet to what end is honor, if
  we lose the life in which it resides? I sometimes think we purchase human
  glory too dearly, at the sacrifice of quiet, peace, and security.'</p>

  <p>'But you do not think so long. What is a life of indulgence and sloth?
  Life is worthy only in what it achieves. Should I have done better to have
  sat over my embroidery, in the midst of my slaves, all my days, than to have
  spent them in building up a kingdom?'</p>

  <p>'O no&mdash;no&mdash;you have done right. Slaves can embroider: Zenobia
  cannot. This hand was made for other weapon than the needle.'</p>

  <p>'I am weary,' said the Queen; 'let us sit;'&mdash;and saying so, she
  placed herself upon the low stone block, upon which we had been sitting, and
  drawing Fausta near her, she threw her left arm round her, retaining the hand
  she held clasped in her own.</p>

  <p>'I am weary,' she continued, 'for I have walked nearly the circuit of the
  walls. You asked what makes me here. No night passes but I visit these towers
  and battlements. If the governor of the ship sleeps, the men at the watch
  sleep. Besides, I love Palmyra too well to sleep while others wait and watch.
  I would do my share. How beautiful is this!&mdash;the city girded by these
  strange fires! its ears filled with this busy music! Piso, it seems hard to
  believe an enemy, and such an enemy, is there, and that these sights and
  sounds are all of death!'</p>

  <p>'Would it were not so, noble Queen! Would it were not yet too late to move
  in the cause of peace. If even at the risk of life I&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Forbear, Piso,' quickly rejoined the Queen; 'it is to no purpose. You
  have my thanks, but your Emperor has closed the door of peace forever. It is
  now war unto death. He may prove victor: it is quite possible: but I draw not
  back&mdash;no word of supplication goes from me. And every citizen of
  Palmyra, save a few sottish souls, is with me. It were worth my throne and my
  life, the bare suggestion of an embassy now to Aurelian. But let us not speak
  of this, but of things more agreeable. The day for trouble, the night for
  rest. Fausta, where is the quarter of Calpurnius? methinks it is
  hereabouts.'</p>

  <p>'It is,' replied Fausta, 'just beyond the towers of the gate next to us;
  were it not for this thick night, we could see where at this time he is
  usually to be found, doing, like yourself, an unnecessary task.'</p>

  <p>'He is a good soldier and a faithful&mdash;may he prove as true to you, my
  noble girl, as he has to me. Albeit I am myself a sceptic in love, I cannot
  but be made happier when I see hearts worthy of each other united by that
  bond. I trust that bright days are coming, when I may do you the honor I
  would. Piso, I am largely a debtor to your brother&mdash;and Palmyra as much.
  Singular fortune! that while Rome thus oppresses me, to Romans I should owe
  so much; to one twice my life, to another my army. But where, Lucius Piso,
  was your heart, that it fell not into the snare that caught Calpurnius?'</p>

  <p>'My heart,'I replied, 'has always been Fausta's, from
  childhood&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Our attachment,' said Fausta, interrupting me, 'is not less than love,
  but greater. It is the sacred tie of nature, if I may say so, of brother to
  sister; it is friendship.'</p>

  <p>'You say well,' replied the Queen. 'I like the sentiment. It is not less
  than love, but greater. Love is a delirium, a dream, a disease. It is full of
  disturbance. It is unequal, capricious, unjust; its felicity, when at the
  highest, is then nearest to deepest misery; a step, and it is into
  unfathomable gulfs of woe. While the object loved is as yet unattained, life
  is darker than darkest night. When it is attained, it is then oftener like
  the ocean heaving and tossing from its foundations, than the calm, peaceful
  lake, which mirrors friendship. And when lost, all is lost, the universe is
  nothing. Who will deny it the name of madness? Will love find entrance into
  Elysium? Will heaven know more than friendship? I trust not. It were an
  element of discord there, where harmony should reign perpetual.' After a
  pause, in which she seemed buried in thought, she added musingly&mdash;'What
  darkness rests upon the future! Life, like love, is itself but a dream; often
  a brief or a prolonged madness. Its light burns sometimes brightly, oftener
  obscurely, and with a flickering ray, and then goes out in smoke and
  darkness. How strange that creatures so exquisitely wrought as we are,
  capable of such thoughts and acts, rising by science, and art, and letters,
  almost to the level of gods, should be fixed here for so short a time,
  running our race with the unintelligent brute; living not so long as some,
  dying like all. Could I have ever looked out of this life into the possession
  of any other beyond it, I believe my aims would have been different. I should
  not so easily have been satisfied with glory and power: at least I think so;
  for who knows himself? I should then, I think, have reached after higher
  kinds of excellence, such for example as, existing more in the mind itself,
  could be of avail after death&mdash;could be carried out of the
  world&mdash;which power, riches, glory, cannot. The greatest service which
  any philosopher could perform for the human race, would be to demonstrate the
  certainty of a future existence, in the same satisfactory manner that Euclid
  demonstrates the truths of geometry. We cannot help believing Euclid if we
  would, and the truths he has established concerning lines and angles,
  influence us whether we will or not. Whenever the immortality of the soul
  shall be proved in like manner, so that men cannot help believing it, so that
  they shall draw it in with the first elements of all knowledge, then will
  mankind become a quite different race of beings. Men will be more virtuous
  and more happy. How is it possible to be either in a very exalted degree,
  dwelling as we do in this deep obscure, uncertain whether we are mere earth
  and water, or parts of the divinity; whether we are worms or immortals; men
  or gods; spending all our days in, at best, miserable perplexity and doubt?
  Do you remember, Fausta and Piso, the discourse of Longinus in the garden,
  concerning the probability of a future life?</p>

  <p>'We do, very distinctly.'</p>

  <p>'And how did it impress you?'</p>

  <p>'It seemed to possess much likelihood,' replied Fausta, 'but that was
  all.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' responded the Queen, sighing deeply, 'that was indeed all.
  Philosophy, in this part of it, is a mere guess. Even Longinus can but
  conjecture. And what to his great and piercing intellect stands but in the
  strength of probability, to ours will, of necessity, address itself in the
  very weakness of fiction. As it is, I value life only for the brightest and
  best it can give now, and these to my mind are power and a throne. When these
  are lost I would fall unregarded into darkness and death.'</p>

  <p>'But,'I ventured to suggest, 'you derive great pleasure and large profit
  from study; from the researches of philosophy, from the knowledge of history,
  from contemplation of the beauties of art, and the magnificence of nature.
  Are not these things that give worth to life? If you reasoned aright, and
  probed the soul well, would you not find that from these, as from hidden
  springs, a great deal of all the best felicity you have tasted, has welled
  up? Then, still more, from acts of good and just government; from promoting
  and witnessing the happiness of your subjects; from private friendship; from
  affections resting upon objects worthy to be loved&mdash;from these has no
  happiness come worth living for? And beside all this, from an inward
  consciousness of rectitude? Most of all this may still be yours, though you
  no longer sat upon a throne, and men held their lives but in your breath.</p>

  <p>'From such sources,' replied Zenobia, 'some streams have issued it may be,
  that have added to what I have enjoyed; but, of themselves, they would have
  been nothing. The lot of earth, being of the low and common herd, is a lot
  too low and sordid to be taken if proffered. I thank the gods mine has been
  better. It has been a throne, glory, renown, pomp, and power; and I have been
  happy. Stripped of these, and without the prospect of immortality, and I
  would not live.'</p>

  <p>With these words she rose quickly from her seat, saying that she had a
  further duty to perform. Fausta intreated to be used as an agent or
  messenger, but could not prevail. Zenobia darting from our side was in a
  moment lost in the surrounding darkness. We returned to the house of
  Gracchus.</p>

  <p>In a few days, the vast preparations of the Romans being complete, a
  general assault was made by the whole army upon every part of the walls.
  Every engine, known to our modern methods of attacking walled cities, was
  brought to bear. Towers constructed in the former manner were wheeled up to
  the walls. Battering rams of enormous size, those who worked them being
  protected by sheds of hide, thundered on all sides at the gates and walls.
  Language fails to convey an idea of the energy, the fury, the madness of the
  onset. The Roman army seemed as if but one being, with such equal courage and
  contempt of danger and death was the dreadful work performed. But the Queen's
  defences have again proved superior to all the power of Aurelian. Her engines
  have dealt death and ruin in awful measure among the assailants. The moat and
  the surrounding plain are filled and covered with the bodies of the slain. As
  night came on after a long day of uninterrupted conflict, the troops of
  Aurelian, baffled and defeated at every point, withdrew to their tents, and
  left the city to repose.</p>

  <p>The temples of the gods have resounded with songs of thanksgiving for this
  new deliverance, garlands have been hung around their images, and gifts laid
  upon their altars. Jews and Christians, Persians and Egyptians, after the
  manner of their worship, have added their voices to the general chorus.</p>

  <p>Again there has been a pause. The Romans have rested after the late fierce
  assault to recover strength, and the city has breathed free. Many are filled
  with new courage and hope, and the discontented spirits are silenced. The
  praises of Zenobia, next to those of the gods, fill every mouth. The streets
  ring with songs composed in her honor.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Another day of excited expectations and bitter
disappointment.</p>

  <p>It was early reported that forces were seen approaching from the east, on
  the very skirts of the plain, and that they could be no other than the long-
  looked-for Persian army. Before its approach was indicated to those upon the
  highest towers of the gates, by the clouds of dust hovering over it, it was
  evident from the extraordinary commotion in the Roman intrenchments, that
  somewhat unusual had taken place. Their scouts must have brought in early
  intelligence of the advancing foe. Soon as the news spread through the city
  the most extravagant demonstrations of joy broke forth on all sides. Even the
  most moderate and sedate could not but give way to expressions of heartfelt
  satisfaction. The multitudes poured to the walls to witness a combat upon
  which the existence of the city seemed suspended.</p>

  <p>'Father,' said Fausta, after Gracchus had communicated the happy tidings,
  'I cannot sit here&mdash;let us hasten to the towers of the Persian gate,
  whence we may behold the encounter.'</p>

  <p>'I will not oppose you,' replied Gracchus, 'but the sight may cost you
  naught but tears and pain. Persia's good will, I fear, will not be much, nor
  manifested by large contributions to our cause. If it be what I
  suspect&mdash;but a paltry subdivision of her army, sent here rather to be
  cut in pieces than aught else&mdash;it will but needlessly afflict and
  irritate.'</p>

  <p>'Father, I would turn away from no evil that threatens Palmyra. Besides, I
  should suffer more from imagined, than from real disaster. Let us hasten to
  the walls.'</p>

  <p>We flew to the Persian gate.</p>

  <p>'But why,' asked Fausta, addressing Gracchus on the way, 'are you not more
  elated? What suspicion do you entertain of Sapor? Will he not be sincerely
  desirous to aid us?'</p>

  <p>'I fear not,' replied Gracchus. 'If we are to be the conquering party in
  this war, he will send such an army as would afterward make it plain that he
  had intended an act of friendship, and done the duty of an ally. If we are to
  be beaten, he will lose little in losing such an army, and will easily, by
  placing the matter in certain lights, convince the Romans that their
  interests had been consulted, rather than ours, We can expect no act of true
  friendship from Sapor. Yet he dares not abandon us. Were Hormisdas upon the
  throne, our prospects were brighter.'</p>

  <p>'I pray the gods that ancient wretch may quickly perish then,' cried
  Fausta, 'if such might be the consequences to us. Why is he suffered longer
  to darken Persia and the earth with his cruel despotism!'</p>

  <p>'His throne shakes beneath him,' replied Gracchus; 'a breath may throw it
  down.'</p>

  <p>As we issued forth upon the walls, and then mounted to the battlements of
  the highest tower, whence the eye took in the environs of the city, and even
  the farthest verge of the plain, and overlooked, like one's own court-yard,
  the camp and intrenchments of the Romans&mdash;we beheld with distinctness
  the Persian forces within less than two Roman miles. They had halted and
  formed, and there apparently awaited the enemy.</p>

  <p>No sooner had Gracchus surveyed well the scene, than he exclaimed, 'The
  gods be praised! I have done Sapor injustice. Yonder forces are such as may
  well call forth all the strength of the Roman army. In that case there will
  be much for us to do. I must descend and to the post of duty.'</p>

  <p>So saying he left us.</p>

  <p>'I suppose,' said Fausta, 'in case the enemy be such as to draw off the
  larger part of the Roman army, sorties will be made from the gates upon their
  camp?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,'I rejoined; 'if the Romans should suffer themselves to be drawn to a
  distance, and their forces divided, a great chance would fall into the hands
  of the city. But that they will not do. You perceive the Romans move not, but
  keep their station just where they are. They will oblige the Persians to
  commence the assault upon them in their present position, or there will be no
  battle.'</p>

  <p>'I perceive their policy now,' said Fausta. 'And the battle being fought
  so near the walls, they are still as strongly beleaguered as ever&mdash;at
  least half their strength seems to remain within their intrenchments. See,
  see! the Persian army is on the march. It moves toward the city. Now again it
  halts.'</p>

  <p>'It hopes to entice Aurelian from his position, so as to put power into
  our hands. But they will fail in their object.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I fear they will,' replied Fausta. 'The Romans remain fixed as
  statues in their place.'</p>

  <p>'Is it not plain to you, Fausta,' said I, 'that the Persians conceive not
  the full strength of the Roman army? Your eye can now measure their
  respective forces.'</p>

  <p>'It is too plain, alas!' said Fausta. 'If the Persians should defeat the
  army now formed, there is another within the trenches to be defeated
  afterwards, Now they move again. Righteous gods, interpose in our
  behalf!'</p>

  <p>At this moment indeed the whole Persian army put itself into quick and
  decisive motion, as if determined to dare all&mdash;and achieve all for their
  ally, if fate should so decree. It was a sight beautiful to behold, but of an
  interest too painful almost to be endured. The very existence of a city and
  an empire seemed to hang upon its issues; and here, looking on and awaiting
  the decisive moment, was as it were the empire itself assembled upon the
  walls of its capital, with which, if it should fall, the kingdom would also
  fall, and the same ruin cover both. The Queen herself was there to animate
  and encourage by her presence, not only the hearts of all around, but even
  the distant forces of the Persians, who, from their position, might easily
  behold the whole extent of the walls and towers, covered with an innumerable
  multitude of the besieged inhabitants, who, by waving their hands, and by
  every conceivable demonstration, gave them to feel more deeply than they
  could otherwise have done, how much was depending upon their skill and
  bravery.</p>

  <p>Soon after the last movement of the Persians, the light troops of either
  army encountered, and by a discharge of arrows and javelins, commenced the
  attack. Then in a few moments, it being apparently impossible to restrain the
  impatient soldiery, the battle became general. The cry of the onset and the
  clash of arms fell distinctly upon our ears. Long, long, were the opposing
  armies mingled together in one undistinguishable mass, waging an equal fight.
  Now it would sway toward the one side, and now toward the other, heaving and
  bending as a field of ripe grain to the fitful breeze. Fausta sat with
  clenched hands and straining eye, watching the doubtful fight, and waiting
  the issue in speechless agony. A deep silence, as of night and death, held
  the whole swarming multitude of the citizens, who hardly seemed as if they
  dared breathe while what seemed the final scene was in the act of being
  performed.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a new scene, and more terrific because nearer, burst upon our
  sight. At a signal given by Zenobia from the high tower which she occupied,
  the gates below us flew open, and Zabdas, at the head of all the flower of
  the Palmyra cavalry, poured forth, followed closely from this and the other
  gates by the infantry. The battle now raged between the walls and the Roman
  intrenchments as well as beyond. The whole plain was one field of battle and
  slaughter. Despair lent vigor and swiftness to the horse and foot of Palmyra;
  rage at the long continued contest, revenge for all they had lost and
  endured, nerved the Roman arm, and gave a double edge to its sword. Never
  before, my Curtius, had I beheld a fight in which every blow seemed so to
  carry with it the whole soul, boiling with wrath, of him who gave it. Death
  sat upon every arm.</p>

  <p>'Lucius!' cried Fausta, I started, for it had been long that she had
  uttered not a word.</p>

  <p>'Lucius! unless my eye grows dim and lies, which the gods grant, the
  Persians! look! they give way&mdash;is it not so? Immortal gods, forsake not
  my country!'</p>

  <p>'The battle may yet turn,'I said, turning my eyes where she pointed, and
  seeing it was so&mdash;'despair not, dear Fausta. If the Persians
  yield&mdash;see, Zabdas has mounted the Roman intrenchments.'</p>

  <p>'Yes&mdash;they fly,' screamed Fausta, and would madly have sprung over
  the battlements, but that I seized and held her. At the same moment a cry
  arose that Zabdas was slain&mdash;her eye caught his noble form as it fell
  backwards from his horse, and with a faint exclamation, 'Palmyra is lost!'
  fell lifeless into my arms.</p>

  <p>While I devoted myself to her recovery, cries of distress and despair fell
  from all quarters upon my ear. And when I had succeeded in restoring her to
  consciousness, the fate of the day was decided&mdash;the Persians were
  routed&mdash;the Palmyrenes were hurrying in wild confusion before the
  pursuing Romans, and pressing into the gates.</p>

  <p>'Lucius,' said Fausta, 'I am sorry for this weakness. But to sit as it
  were chained here, the witness of such disaster, is too much for mere mortal
  force. Could I but have mingled in that fight! Ah, how cruel the slaughter of
  those flying troops! Why do they not turn, and at least die with their faces
  toward the enemy? Let us now go and seek Calpurnius and Gracchus.'</p>

  <p>'We cannot yet, Fausta, for the streets are thronged with this flying
  multitude.'</p>

  <p>'It is hard to remain here, the ears rent, and the heart torn by these
  shrieks of the wounded and dying. How horrible this tumult! It seems as if
  the world were expiring. There&mdash;the gates are swinging upon their
  hinges; they are shut. Let us descend.'</p>

  <p>We forced our way as well as we could through the streets, crowded now
  with soldiers and citizens&mdash;the soldiers scattered and in disorder, the
  citizens weeping and alarmed&mdash;some hardly able to drag along themselves,
  others sinking beneath the weight of the wounded whom they bore upon their
  shoulders, or upon lances and shields as upon a litter. The way was all along
  obstructed by the bodies of men and horses who had there fallen and died,
  their wounds allowing them to proceed no further, or who had been run down
  and trampled to death in the tumult and hurry of the entrance.</p>

  <p>After a long and weary struggle, we reached the house of
  Gracchus&mdash;still solitary&mdash;for neither he nor Calpurnius had
  returned. The slaves gathered around us to know the certainty and extent of
  the evil. When they had learned it, their sorrow for their mistress, whom
  they loved for her own sake, and whom they saw overwhelmed with grief, made
  them almost forget that they only were suffering these things who had
  inflicted a worse injury upon themselves. I could not but admire a virtue
  which seemed of double lustre from the circumstances in which it was
  manifested.</p>

  <p>Calpurnius had been in the thickest of the fight, but had escaped unhurt.
  He was near Zabdas when he fell, and revenged his death by hewing down the
  soldier who had pierced him with his lance.</p>

  <p>'Zabdas,' said Calpurnius, when in the evening we recalled the sad events
  of the day, 'was not instantly killed by the thrust of the spear, but falling
  backwards from his horse, found strength and life enough remaining to raise
  himself upon his knee, and cheer me on, as I flew to revenge his death upon
  the retreating Roman. As I returned to him, having completed my task, he had
  sunk upon the ground, but was still living, and his eye bright with its
  wonted fire. I raised him in my arms, and lifting him upon my horse, moved
  toward the gate, intending to bring him within the walls. But he presently
  entreated me to desist.'</p>

  <p>'"I die," said he; "it is all in vain, noble Piso. Lay me at the root of
  this tree, and that shall be my bed and its shaft my monument."</p>

  <p>'I took him from the horse as he desired.'</p>

  <p>'"Place me," said he, "with my back against the tree, and my face toward
  the intrenchments, that while I live I may see the battle. Piso, tell the
  Queen that to the last hour I am true to her. It has been my glory in life to
  live but for her, and my death is a happiness, dying for her. Her image swims
  before me now, and over her hovers a winged victory. The Romans fly&mdash;I
  knew it would be so&mdash;the dogs cannot stand before the cavalry of
  Palmyra&mdash;they never could&mdash;they fled at Antioch. Hark!&mdash;there
  are the shouts of triumph&mdash;bring me my horse&mdash;Zenobia! live and
  reign forever!"</p>

  <p>'With these words and in this happy delusion, his head fell upon his
  bosom, and he died. I returned to the conflict; but it had become a rout, and
  I was borne along with the rushing throng toward the gates.'</p>

  <p>After a night of repose and quiet, there has come another day of
  adversity. The hopes of the city have again been raised, only again to be
  disappointed. The joyful cry was heard from the walls in the morning, that
  the Saracens and Armenians with united forces were in the field. Coming so
  soon upon the fatiguing duty of the last day, and the Roman army not having
  received reinforcements from the West, it was believed that the enemy could
  not sustain another onset as fierce as that of the Persians. I hastened once
  more to the walls&mdash;Fausta being compelled by Gracchus to remain within
  the palace&mdash;to witness as I believed another battle.</p>

  <p>The report I found true. The allied forces of those nations were in
  sight&mdash;the Romans were already drawn from their encampment to encounter
  them. The same policy was pursued on their part as before. They awaited the
  approach of the new enemy just on the outer side of their works. The walls
  and towers as far as the eye could reach were again swarming with the
  population of Palmyra.</p>

  <p>For a long time neither army seemed disposed to move.</p>

  <p>'They seem not very ready to try the fortune of another day,' said a
  citizen to me standing by my side. 'Nor do I wonder. The Persians gave them
  rough handling. A few thousands more on their side, and the event would not
  have been as it was. Think you not the sally under Zabdas was too long
  deferred?'</p>

  <p>'It is easy afterward,'I replied, 'to say how an action should have been
  performed. It requires the knowledge and wisdom of a god never to err. There
  were different judgments I know, but for myself I believe the Queen was
  right; that is, whether Zabdas had left the gates earlier or later, the event
  would have been the same.'</p>

  <p>'What means that?' suddenly exclaimed my companion; 'see you yonder herald
  bearing a flag of truce, and proceeding from the Roman ranks? It bodes no
  good to Palmyra. What think you the purpose is?'</p>

  <p>'It may be but to ask a forbearance of arms for a few hours, or a day
  perhaps. Yet it is not the custom of Rome. I cannot guess.'</p>

  <p>'That can I,' exclaimed another citizen on my other side. 'Neither in the
  Armenians nor yet the Saracens can so much trust be reposed as in a Christian
  or a Jew. They are for the strongest. Think you they have come to fight? Not
  if they can treat to better purpose. The Romans, who know by heart the people
  of the whole earth, know them. Mark me, they will draw never a sword. As the
  chances are now, they will judge the Romans winners, and a little gold will
  buy them.'</p>

  <p>'The gods forbid,' cried the other, 'that it should be so; they are the
  last hope of Palmyra. If they fail us, we must e'en throw open our gates, and
  take our fate at the mercy of Aurelian.'</p>

  <p>'Never while I have an arm that can wield a sword, shall a gate of Palmyra
  swing upon its hinge to let in an enemy.'</p>

  <p>'Food already grows short,' said the first; 'better yield than
  starve.'</p>

  <p>'Thou, friend, art in no danger for many a day, if, as is fabled of
  certain animals, thou canst live on thine own fat. Or if it came to
  extremities, thou wouldst make a capital stew or roast for others.'</p>

  <p>At which the surrounding crowd laughed heartily, while the fat man,
  turning pale, slunk away and disappeared.</p>

  <p>'That man,' said one, 'would betray a city for a full meal.'</p>

  <p>'I know him well,' said another; 'he is the earliest at the markets, where
  you may always see him feeling out with his fat finger the parts of meats
  that are kindred to himself. His soul, could it be seen, would be of the form
  of a fat kidney. His riches he values only as they can be changed into food.
  Were all Palmyra starved, he, were he sought, would be found in some
  deep-down vault, bedded in the choicest meats&mdash;enough to stand a year's
  siege, and leave his paunch as far about as 't is to-day. See, the Queen
  betrays anxiety. The gods shield her from harm!'</p>

  <p>Zenobia occupied the same post of observation as before. She paced to and
  fro with a hasty and troubled step the narrow summit of the tower, where she
  had placed herself.</p>

  <p>After no long-interval of time, the Roman herald was seen returning from
  the camp of the Armenians. Again he sallied forth from the tent of Aurelian,
  on the same errand. It was too clear now that negotiations were going on
  which might end fatally for Palmyra. Doubt, fear, anxiety, intense
  expectation kept the multitude around me in breathless silence, standing at
  fixed gaze, like so many figures of stone.</p>

  <p>They stood not long in this deep and agonizing suspense; for no sooner did
  the Roman herald reach the tents of the allied armies, and hold brief parley
  with their chiefs, than he again turned toward the Roman intrenchments at a
  quick pace, and at the same moment the tents of the other party were struck,
  and while a part commenced a retreat, another and larger part moved as
  auxiliaries to join the camp of Aurelian.</p>

  <p>Cries of indignation, rage, grief and despair, then burst from the
  miserable crowds, as with slow and melancholy steps they turned from the
  walls to seek again their homes. Zenobia was seen once to clasp her hands,
  turning her face toward the heavens. As she emerged from the tower and
  ascended her chariot, the enthusiastic throngs failed not to testify their
  unshaken confidence and determined spirit of devotion to her and her throne,
  by acclamations that seemed to shake the very walls themselves.</p>

  <p>This last has proved a heavier blow to Palmyra than the former. It shows
  that their cause is regarded by the neighboring powers as a losing one, or
  already lost and that hope, so far as it rested upon their friendly
  interposition, must be abandoned. The city is silent and sad. Almost all the
  forms of industry having ceased, the inhabitants are doubly wretched through
  their necessary idleness; they can do little but sit and brood over their
  present deprivations, and utter their dark bodings touching the future. They
  who obtained their subsistence by ministering to the pleasures of others, are
  now the first to suffer; for there are none to employ their services.
  Streets, which but a little while ago resounded with notes of music and the
  loud laughter of those who lived to pleasure, are now dull and deserted. The
  brilliant shops are closed, the fountains forsaken, the Porticos solitary, or
  they are frequented by a few who resort to them chiefly to while away some of
  the melancholy hours that hang upon their hands. And they who are abroad seem
  not like the same people. Their step is now measured and slow&mdash;the head
  bent&mdash;no salutation greets the passing stranger or acquaintance, or only
  a few cold words of inquiry, which pass from cold lips into ears as cold.
  Apathy&mdash;lethargy&mdash; stupor&mdash;seem fast settling over all. They
  would indeed bury all, I believe, were it not that the parties of the
  discontented increase in number and power, which compels the friends of the
  Queen to keep upon the alert. The question of surrender is now openly
  discussed. 'It is useless,' it is said, 'to hold out longer. Better make the
  best terms we can. If we save the city by an early capitulation from
  destruction, coming off with our lives and a portion of our goods, it is more
  than we shall get if the act be much longer postponed. Every day of delay
  adds to our weakness, while it adds also to the vexation and rage of the
  enemy, who the more and longer he suffers, will be less inclined to treat us
  with indulgence.'</p>

  <p>These may be said to have reason on their side, but the other party are
  inflamed with national pride and devotion to Zenobia, and no power of earth
  is sufficient to bend them. They are the principal party for numbers; much
  more for rank and political power. They will hold out till the very last
  moment&mdash;till it is reduced to a choice between death and capitulation;
  and, on the part of the Queen and the great spirits of Palmyra, death would
  be their unhesitating choice, were it not for the destruction of so many with
  them. They will therefore, until the last loaf of bread is divided, keep the
  gates shut; then throw them open, and meet the terms, whatever they may be,
  which the power of the conqueror may impose.</p>

  <p>A formidable conspiracy has been detected, and the supposed chiefs of it
  seized and executed.</p>

  <p>The design was to secure the person of the Queen, obtain by a violent
  assault one of the gates, and sallying out, deliver her into the hands of the
  Romans, who, with her in their power, could immediately put an end to the
  contest. There is little doubt that Antiochus was privy to it, although those
  who suffered betrayed him not, if that were the fact. But it has been urged
  with some force in his favor, that none who suffered would have felt regard
  enough for him to have hesitated to sacrifice him, if by doing so they could
  have saved their own lives or others.</p>

  <p>Zenobia displayed her usual dauntless courage, her clemency, and her
  severity. The attack was made upon her, surrounded by her small body-guard,
  as she was returning toward evening from her customary visit of observation
  to the walls. It was sudden, violent, desperate; but the loyalty and bravery
  of the guards was more than a match for the assassins, aided too by the
  powerful arm of the Queen herself, who was no idle spectator of the fray. It
  was a well-laid plot, and but for an accidental addition which was made at
  the walls to the Queen's guard, might have succeeded; for the attack was made
  just at the Persian gate, and the keeper of the gate had been gained over.
  Had the guard been overpowered but for a moment, they would have shot the
  gate too quickly for the citizens to have roused to her rescue. Such of the
  conspirators as were not slain upon the spot were secured. Upon examination,
  they denied the participation of others than themselves in the attempt, and
  died, such of them as were executed, involving none in their ruin. The Queen
  would not permit a general slaughter of them, though urged to do so. 'The
  ends of justice and the safety of the city,' she said, 'would be sufficiently
  secured, if an example were made of such as seemed manifestly the chief
  movers. But there should be no indulgence of the spirit of revenge.' Those
  accordingly were beheaded, the others imprisoned.</p>

  <p>While these long and weary days are passing away, Gracchus, Fausta,
  Calpurnius and myself are often at the palace of Zenobia. The Queen is
  gracious, as she ever is, but laboring under an anxiety and an inward sorrow,
  that imprint themselves deeply upon her countenance, and reveal themselves in
  a greater reserve of manner. While she is not engaged in some active service
  she is buried in thought, and seems like one revolving difficult and
  perplexing questions. Sometimes she breaks from these moments of reverie with
  some sudden question to one or another of those around her, from which we can
  obscurely conjecture the subjects of her meditations. With Longinus, Otho,
  and Gracchus she passes many of her hours in deep deliberation. At times,
  when apparently nature cries out for relief, she will join us as we sit
  diverting our minds by conversation upon subjects as far removed as possible
  from the present distresses, and will, as formerly, shed the light of her
  penetrating judgment upon whatever it is we discuss. But she soon falls back
  into herself again, and remains silent and abstracted, or leaves us and
  retreats to her private apartments.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Suddenly the Queen has announced a project which fills the
city with
  astonishment at its boldness, and once more lights up hope within the bosoms
  of the most desponding.</p>

  <p>Soon as her own mind had conceived and matured it, her friends and
  counsellors were summoned to receive it from her, and pronounce their
  judgment. Would that I could set before you, my Curtius, this wonderful woman
  as she stood before us at this interview. Never before did she seem so great,
  or of such transcendent beauty&mdash;if under such circumstances such a
  thought may be expressed. Whatever of melancholy had for so long a time shed
  its gloom over her features was now gone. The native fire of her eye was
  restored and doubled, as it seemed, by the thoughts which she was waiting to
  express. A spirit greater than even her own, appeared to animate her, and to
  breathe an unwonted majesty into her form, and over the countenance.</p>

  <p>She greeted all with the warmth of a friend, and besought them to hear her
  while she presented a view of the present condition of their affairs, and
  then proposed what she could not but believe might still prove a means of
  final deliverance&mdash;at least, it might deserve their careful
  consideration. After having gone over the course that had been pursued and
  defended it, as that alone which became the dignity and honor of a sovereign
  and independent power, she proceeded thus:</p>

  <p>'We are now, it is obvious to all, at the last extremity. If no new outlet
  be opened from the difficulties which environ us, a few days will determine
  our fate. We must open our gates and take such mercy as our conquerors may
  bestow. The provision laid up in the public granaries is nearly exhausted.
  Already has it been found necessary greatly to diminish the amount of the
  daily distribution. Hope in any power of our own seems utterly extinct: if
  any remain, it rests upon foreign interposition, and of this I do not
  despair. I still rely upon Persia. I look with confidence to Sapor for
  farther and yet larger succors. In the former instance, it was apprehended by
  many&mdash;I confess I shared the apprehension&mdash;that there would be on
  the part of Persia but a parade of friendship, with nothing of reality. But
  you well know it was far otherwise. There was a sincere and vigorous
  demonstration in our behalf. Persia never fought a better field, and with
  slightly larger numbers would have accomplished our rescue. My proposition
  is, that we sue again at the court of Sapor&mdash;no, not again, for the
  first was a free-will offering&mdash;and that we fail not, I would go myself
  my own ambassador, and solicit what so solicited, my life upon it, will not
  be refused. You well know that I can bear with me jewels gathered during a
  long reign of such value as to plead eloquently in my cause, since the tithe
  of them would well repay the Persian for all his kingdom might suffer for our
  sakes.'</p>

  <p>'What you propose, great Queen,' said Longinus, as Zenobia paused, 'agrees
  with your whole life. But how can we, who hold you as we do, sit in our
  places and allow you alone to encounter the dangers of such an enterprise?
  For without danger it cannot be&mdash;from the robber of the desert, from the
  Roman, from the Persian.' In disguise and upon the road, you may suffer the
  common fate of those who travel where, as now, marauders of all nations
  swarm; Sapor may, in his capricious policy, detain you prisoner; Aurelian may
  intercept. Let your servants prevail with you to dismiss this thought from
  your mind. You can name no one of all this company who will not plead to be
  your substitute.'</p>

  <p>There was not one present who did not spring upon his feet, and express
  his readiness to undertake the charge.</p>

  <p>'I thank you all,' said the Queen, 'but claim, in this perhaps the last
  act of my reign, to be set free in your indulgence to hold an unobstructed
  course. If in your honest judgments you confess that of all who could appear
  at the court of Sapor, I should appear there as the most powerful pleader for
  Palmyra, it is all I ask you to determine. Is such your judgment?'</p>

  <p>'It is,' they all responded&mdash;'without doubt it is.'</p>

  <p>'Then am I resolved. And the enterprise itself you judge wise and of
  probable success?'</p>

  <p>'We do. The reasons are just upon which it is founded. It is greatly
  conceived, and the gods giving you safe conduct to Sapor, we cannot doubt a
  happy result.'</p>

  <p>'Then all that remains is, to contrive the manner of escape from the city
  and through the Roman camp.'</p>

  <p>'There is first one thing more,' said the Princess Julia, suddenly rising
  from her mother's side, but with a forced and trembling courage, 'which
  remains for me to do. If there appear any want of maidenly reserve in what I
  say, let the cause, good friends, for which I speak and act, be my excuse. It
  is well known to you who are familiar with the councils of the state, that
  not many months past Persia sought through me an alliance with Palmyra. But
  in me, you, my mother and Queen, have hitherto found an uncomplying
  daughter&mdash;and you, Fathers, a self-willed Princess. I now seek what
  before I have shunned. Although I know not the Prince Hormisdas&mdash;report
  speaks worthily of him&mdash;but of him I think not&mdash;yet if by the offer
  of myself I could now help the cause of my country, the victim is ready for
  the altar. Let Zenobia bear with her not only the stones torn from her crown,
  but this which she so often has termed her living jewel, and if the others,
  first proffered, fail to reach the Persian's heart, then, but not till then,
  add the other to the scale. If it weigh to buy deliverance and prosperity to
  Palmyra&mdash;though I can never be happy&mdash;yet I shall be happy if the
  cause of happiness to you.'</p>

  <p>'My noble child!' said Zenobia, 'I cannot have so startled the chiefs of
  Palmyra by a new and unthought-of project, as I am now amazed in my turn. I
  dreamed not of this. But I cannot hinder you in your purpose. It ensures
  success to your country; and to be the instrument of that, will be a rich
  compensation for even the largest sacrifice of private affections.'</p>

  <p>The counsellors and senators who were present expressed a great, and I
  doubt not sincere unwillingness that so dangerous a service should be
  undertaken by those whom they so loved, and whom beyond all others they would
  shield with their lives from the very shadow of harm. But they were overcome
  by the determined spirit both of the Queen and Julia, and by their own secret
  conviction that it was the only act in the power of mortals by which the
  existence of the empire and city could be preserved.</p>

  <p>At this point of the interview, Calpurnius, whom we had missed, entered,
  and learning what had passed, announced that by a channel not to be
  mistrusted, he had received intelligence of a sudden rising in Persia, of the
  assassination of Sapor, and the elevation of Hormisdas to the throne of his
  father. This imparted to all the liveliest pleasure, and seemed to take away
  from the project of the Queen every remaining source of disquietude and
  doubt. Calpurnius at the same moment was besought, and offered himself to
  serve as the Queen's companion and guide. The chosen friend of Hormisdas, and
  whose friendship he had not forfeited by his flight&mdash;no one could so
  well as he advocate her cause with the new king.</p>

  <p>'But how is it,' inquired Longinus, 'that you obtain foreign intelligence,
  the city thus beset?'</p>

  <p>'It may well be asked,' replied Calpurnius. 'It is through the
  intelligence and cunning of a Jew well known in Palmyra, and throughout the
  world I believe, called Isaac. By him was I rescued from Persian captivity,
  and through him have I received letters thence, ever since the city has been
  besieged. He is acquainted with a subterranean passage&mdash;in the time of
  Trajan, he has informed me, a public conduit, but long since much choked and
  dry&mdash;by which one may pass from the city under and beyond the lines of
  the Roman intrenchments, emerging into a deep ravine or fissure, grown
  thickly over with vines and olives. Once it was of size sufficient to admit
  an elephant with his rider; now, he says, has it become so obstructed, and in
  some places so fallen in, that it is with difficulty that a dromedary of but
  the common size can force his way through.'</p>

  <p>'Through this then the Queen may effect her escape,' said Longinus.</p>

  <p>'With perfect ease and security,' rejoined Calpurnius. 'At the outlet,
  Isaac shall be in waiting with the fleetest dromedaries of the royal
  stables.'</p>

  <p>'We are satisfied,' said Longinus; 'let it be as you say. The gods prosper
  the pious service!'</p>

  <p>So ended the conversation.</p>

  <p>Of the ancient aqueduct or conduit, you have already heard from me; it is
  the same by which Isaac has transmitted my late letters to Portia&mdash;which
  I trust you have received and read. To Portia alone&mdash;be not
  offended&mdash;do I pour out my whole soul. From her learn more of what
  relates to the Princess.</p>

  <p>I returned from the palace of Zenobia overwhelmed with a thousand painful
  sensations. But this I need not say.</p>

  <p>Fausta, upon learning the determination of the Queen, which had been
  communicated not even to her, exclaimed&mdash;'There, Lucius, I have always
  told you Palmyra brought forth women! Where in the wide world shall two be
  found to match Zenobia and Julia? But when is the time fixed for the
  flight?'</p>

  <p>'To-morrow night.'</p>

  <p>'I will to the palace. These may be the last hours permitted by the gods
  to our friendship. I must not lose one of them.'</p>

  <p>I went not there again.</p>

  <p>Late on the evening of the following day Fausta returned&mdash;her
  countenance betraying what she had suffered in parting from those two, her
  bosom friends. It was long ere she could possess herself so far as to give to
  Gracchus and myself a narrative of what had occurred. To do it, asked but few
  words.</p>

  <p>'We have passed the time,' she said at length, 'as you might suppose those
  would about to be separated&mdash;forever; yes, I feel that I have seen them
  for the last time. It is like a conviction inspired by the gods. We did
  naught till the hour of attiring for the flight arrived, but sit, look upon
  each other, embrace, and weep. Not that Zenobia, always great, lost the true
  command of herself, or omitted aught that should be done; but that she was a
  woman, and a mother, and a friend, as well as a Queen and a divinity. But I
  can say no more.'</p>

  <p>'Yet one thing,' she suddenly resumed; 'alas! I had well nigh forgotten
  it&mdash;it should have been said first. What think you? the Indian slave,
  Sindarina, was to accompany the Queen, but at the hour of departure she was
  missing. Her chamber was empty&mdash;the Arabian disguise, in which all were
  to be arrayed, lying on her bed&mdash;she herself to be found neither there
  nor any where within the palace. Another of the Queen's women was chosen in
  her place. What make you of it?'</p>

  <p>'Treason!&mdash;treachery!' cried Gracchus, and springing from his seat,
  shouted for a horse.</p>

  <p>'The gods forgive me,' cried the afflicted Gracchus, 'that this has been
  forgotten! Why, why did I not lay to heart the hints which you dropped!'</p>

  <p>'In very truth,'I replied, 'they were almost too slight to build even a
  suspicion upon. The Queen heeded them not&mdash;and I myself had dismissed
  them from my mind not less than yourself.'</p>

  <p>'Not a moment is to be lost,' said Gracchus; 'the slave must be found, and
  all whom we suspect seized.'</p>

  <p>The night was passed in laborious search, both of the slave and Antiochus.
  The whole city was abroad in a common cause. All the loose companions of
  Antiochus and the young princes were taken and imprisoned; the suspected
  leaders in the affair, after a scrutinizing search and public proclamation,
  could not be found. The inference was clear, agonizing as clear, that the
  Queen's flight had been betrayed.</p>

  <p>Another day has revealed the whole. Isaac, who acted as guide through the
  conduit, and was to serve in the same capacity till the party were secure
  within a Persian fortress, not far from the banks of the Euphrates, has, by a
  messenger, a servant of the palace, found means to convey a relation of what
  befel after leaving Palmyra.</p>

  <p>'Soon,' he says, 'as the shades of evening fell, the Queen, the Princess
  Julia, Nichomachus, a slave, and Calpurnius, arrayed in the garb of Arabs of
  the desert, together with a guard of ten soldiers, selected for their bravery
  and strength, met by different routes at the mouth of the old conduit. So
  noble a company had I never before the charge of. Thou wouldst never have
  guessed the Queen through the veil of her outlandish garment. She became it
  well. Not one was more a man than she. For the Princess, a dull eye would
  have seen through her. Entering a little way in utter darkness, I then bid
  them stand while I lighted torches. The Queen was near me the while, and
  asked me the length of the passage, and whether the walls were of that
  thickness as to prevent the voice from being heard above.</p>

  <p>'"Till we reach one particular spot, where the arch is partly fallen in,"
  I said, "we may use our tongues as freely and as loud as we please; at that
  place there will be need of special caution, as it is directly beneath the
  Roman intrenchments. Of our approach thereto I will give timely warning."</p>

  <p>'I took occasion to say, that I was sorry the Queen of Palmyra should be
  compelled to pass through so gloomy a cavern, but doubtless he who was with
  Deborah and Judith would not forsake her who was so fast a friend to his
  people, and who, if rumor might be believed, was even herself one of them.
  This, Roman, you will doubtless think bold; but how could one who was full
  refrain? I even added, "Fear not; he who watches over Judah and Israel, will
  not fail to appear for one by whose arm their glories are to be restored."
  The Queen at that smiled, and if a countenance may be read, which I hold it
  can, as well as a book, it spoke favorable things for Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>'When our torches were kindled, we went on our way; a narrow way and dark.
  We went in silence too, for I quickly discerned that minds and hearts were
  too busy with themselves and their own sorrows and fears to choose to be
  disturbed. Ah, Roman, how many times harder the lot of the high than the low!
  When we drew nigh to the fissure in the arch, the torches were again
  extinguished, and we proceeded at a snail's pace and with a hyena's foot
  while we were passing within a few feet of the then, as I doubted not,
  sleeping Romans. As we came beneath the broken and open part, I was startled
  by the sound of voices. Soldiers were above conversing. As we paused through
  apprehension, a few words were distinctly heard.</p>

  <p>'"The times will not bear it," muttered one. "'Tis a vain attempt."</p>

  <p>'"His severity is cruel," said another. "Gods! when before was it heard
  of, that a soldier, and such a one, for what every one does whom chance
  favors, should be torn limb from limb? The trees that wrenched Stilcho
  asunder, ere they grow too stiff, may serve a turn on 'Hand-to-his-Sword'
  himself. He will fatten on these starved citizens when he climbs over their
  walls."</p>

  <p>'"O no, by Jupiter!" said the first, "it is far likelier he will let them
  off, as he did at Tyana, and we lose our sport. It is his own soldiers' blood
  he loves."</p>

  <p>'"He may yet learn," replied the other, "that soldiers wear weapons for
  one purpose as well as another. Hark! what noise was that?"</p>

  <p>'"It was but some rat at work within this old arch, Come, let us to
  bed."</p>

  <p>'They moved away, and we, breathing again, passed along, and soon re-
  lighted our torches.</p>

  <p>'After walking a weary distance from this point, and encountering many
  obstacles, we at length reached the long-desired termination. The dromedaries
  were in readiness, and mounting them without delay, we ascended the steep
  sides of the ravine, and then at a rapid pace sought the open plains. When
  they were attained, I considered that we were out of all danger from the
  Romans, and had only to apprehend the ordinary dangers of this route during a
  time of war, when freebooters of all the neighboring tribes are apt to
  abound. "Here," I said to the Queen, "we will put our animals to their utmost
  speed, as the way is plain and smooth&mdash;having regard only," I added, "to
  your and the Princess's strength."&mdash;"On, on, in the name of the gods!"
  said they both; "we can follow as fast as you shall lead." And on we flew
  with the speed of the wind. The Queen's animals were like spirits of the air,
  with such amazing fleetness and sureness of foot did they shoot over the
  surface of the earth. The way was wholly our own. We met none; we saw none.
  Thrice we paused to relieve those not accustomed to such speed, or to the
  peculiar motion of this animal. But at each resting place, the Queen with
  impatience hastened us away, saying, that "rest could be better had at once
  when we had crossed the river; and once upon the other bank, and we were
  safe."</p>

  <p>'The first flush of morning was upon the sky as we came within sight of
  the valley of the Euphrates. The river was itself seen faintly gleaming as we
  wound down the side of a gentle hill. The country here was broken, as it had
  been for many of the last miles we had rode&mdash;divided by low ridges, deep
  ravines, and stretches of wood and bush. So that to those approaching the
  banks in the same general direction, many distinct paths offered themselves.
  It was here, O Piso, just as we reached the foot of this little hill, riding
  more slowly by reason of the winding road, that my quick ear caught at a
  distance the sounds of other hoofs upon the ground beside our own. My heart
  sank within me&mdash;a sudden faintness spread over my limbs. But at the
  instant I gave the alarm to our troop, and at greatest risk of life and limb
  we put our beasts to their extreme speed, and dashed toward the river. I
  still, as we rode, turning my ear in the direction of the sound, heard with
  distinctness the clatter of horses' hoofs. Our beasts were dromedaries; in
  that lay my hope. Two boats awaited us among the rushes on the river's bank,
  in the keeping of those who had been sent forward for that purpose; and off
  against them, upon the other side of the stream, lay a small Persian village
  and fortress. Once off in the boats but ever so short a distance, and we were
  safe. On we flew, and on I was each moment conscious came pursuers, whoever
  they might be. We reached the river's edge.&mdash;"Quick! for your lives," I
  cried. "The Queen, the Princess, and four men in this boat; the packages in
  the other." In a moment and less than that, we were in our boat, a troop of
  horse at the same instant sweeping like a blast of the desert down the bank
  of the river. We shot into the stream; but ere the other could gain the
  water, the Romans, as we now too plainly saw them to be, were upon them. A
  brief but desperate strife ensued. The Romans were five for one of the
  others, and quickly putting them to the sword, sprang into their boat.</p>

  <p>'"Pull! pull!" cried the Queen, the first words she had uttered, "for your
  lives and Palmyra!" They gained upon us. We had six oars, they eight. But the
  strength of three seemed to nerve the arm of Calpurnius.</p>

  <p>'"Immortal gods!" cried he, in inexpressible agony, "they near us!" and
  straining with redoubled energy his oar snapped, and the boat whirled from
  her course.</p>

  <p>'"All is lost!" ejaculated Zenobia.</p>

  <p>'A Roman voice was now heard, "Yield you, and your lives are safe."</p>

  <p>'"Never," cried Calpurnius, and as the Roman boat struck against ours, he
  raised his broken oar, and aiming at him who had spoken, lost his balance and
  plunged headlong into the stream,</p>

  <p>'"Save him&mdash;save him!" cried the Queen, but they heeded her not. "It
  is vain to contend," she cried out again; "we yield, but save the life of him
  who has fallen."</p>

  <p>'The light was yet not sufficient to see but to a little distance. Nothing
  was visible upon the smooth surface of the water, nor any sound heard.</p>

  <p>'"His own rash fury has destroyed him," said the Roman, who we now could
  discern bore the rank of Centurion.</p>

  <p>'"We seek," said he, turning toward where the Queen sat, "we seek Zenobia,
  Queen of Palmyra."</p>

  <p>'"I am Zenobia," said the Queen.</p>

  <p>'"The gods be praised therefor!" rejoined the Centurion. "Our commands are
  to bear you to the tent of Aurelian."</p>

  <p>'"Do with me as you list," replied the Queen; "I am in your power."</p>

  <p>'"To the shore," exclaimed the Roman; and our boat, fastened to the other,
  was soon at the place whence but a moment before it had parted.</p>

  <p>'"Who are these?" asked the Centurion, as we reached the shore, pointing
  to the Princess, and the attendant slave and secretary. "Our orders extend
  only to the person of the Queen."</p>

  <p>'"Divide them not," I said, willing to spare the Queen the bandying of
  words with a Roman soldier, "they are of the Queen's family. They are a part
  of herself. If thou takest one take all to thy Emperor."</p>

  <p>'"So be it; and now to your horses, and once more over the plain. It shall
  go hard, but that what we carry with us will make our fortune with
  Aurelian."</p>

  <p>'Saying this, the whole troop formed, placing Zenobia and Julia in the
  midst, and winding up the banks of the river disappeared.</p>

  <p>'Such, O unhappy Piso, was this disastrous night. Surely all was done on
  our part to secure a successful issue. I can discern no defect nor fault. We
  could not have been more fleet. Swifter beasts never trod the sands of
  Arabia. What then? Hath there not been, think you, foul play? Whence got the
  Romans knowledge, not only of our flight, but of the very spot for which we
  aimed? I doubt not there has been treachery&mdash;and that too of the very
  color of hell. Look to it, and let not the guilty go free.</p>

  <p>'One word touching thy brother. Despond not. I cannot think that he is
  lost. We were but a furlong from the shore. My belief is, that seeing the
  capture of the Queen was certain, and that to him, if taken with her in arms
  against his country, death was inevitable, he, when he fell, rose again at a
  safe distance, and will yet be found.</p>

  <p>'These things I send in haste by a returning servant of the palace, I
  remaining both to secure the dromedaries now wandering at will along the
  banks of the river, and to search diligently for Calpurnius, whom I trust to
  bear back with me to Palmyra.'</p>

  <p>Here, my Curtius, was food for meditation and grief&mdash;the renowned
  Queen of this brilliant capital and kingdom, so late filling a throne that
  drew the admiration of the world, sitting there in a proud magnificence that
  cast into shade Persia itself, is in one short night shorn of all her power;
  a captive at the mercy of a cruel foe; Julia also a captive; my brother, so
  late redeemed&mdash;as I cannot but suppose&mdash;dead. I need not nor can I
  tell you with what emotions I read the fatal letter. The same messenger who
  delivered it to me had spread through the city the news of the Queen's
  captivity. What related to Calpurnius I determined to conceal from Fausta,
  since it was at least possible that by communicating it I might cause a
  useless suffering.</p>

  <p>Fausta, upon learning the horrors of the night, which she first did from
  the outcries and lamentations in the streets, seemed more like one dead than
  alive. She could not weep; the evil was too great for tears. And there being
  no other way in which to give vent to the grief that wrung her soul in every
  feeling and affection, I trembled lest reason should be hurled from its seat.
  She wandered from room to room, her face of the hue of death&mdash;but
  indicating life enough in its intense expression of inward pain&mdash;and
  speechless, save that at intervals in a low tone, 'Zenobia! Palmyra!' fell
  from her scarcely moving lips. To Gracchus and myself essaying to divert her
  from thoughts that seemed to prey upon her very life, she said, 'Leave me to
  wrestle alone with my grief; it is the way to strength. I do not doubt that I
  shall find it.'</p>

  <p>'She is right,' said Gracchus; 'to overcome she must fight her own battle.
  Our aid but ministers to her weakness.'</p>

  <p>It was not long before she rejoined us, tears having brought relief to her
  over-burdened heart.</p>

  <p>Her first inquiry now was for Calpurnius. 'I have feared to ask, for if he
  too is captive, I know that he is lost. Now I can hear and bear all. How is
  it, Lucius?'</p>

  <p>I answered, that 'he was not a captive, so much was known; but where he
  now was, or what had befallen him, was not known. I had reason to believe
  that he would find his way back through the guidance of Isaac to the
  city.'</p>

  <p>'Alas! I read in your words his fate. But I will not urge you farther. I
  will live upon all the hope I can keep alive. Yet it is not the death of
  Calpurnius&mdash;nor yet of Zenobia&mdash;nor Julia&mdash;that wrings the
  soul and saps its life, like this bitter, bitter disappointment, this base
  treason of Antiochus. To be so near the summit of our best hopes, only to be
  cast down into this deep abyss&mdash;that is the sting in our calamity that
  shoots deepest, and for which there is no cure. Is there no other way,
  father, in which we can explain the capture of the Queen?
  Accident&mdash;could it not be accident that threw the troop of Aurelian in
  their way?'</p>

  <p>'I fear not,' said Gracchus. 'When we add what rumor has heretofore
  reported of the aims of Antiochus, but which we have all too much contemned
  him to believe him capable of, to what has now occurred, I think we cannot
  doubt that he is the author of the evil, seducing into his plot the Queen's
  slave, through whom he received intelligence of every plan and movement.'</p>

  <p>'Ah, cruel treachery! How can one join together the sweet innocent face of
  Sindarina and such deep hypocrisy! Antiochus surely must have perverted her
  by magic arts. Of that I am sure. But what fruit can Antiochus hope his
  treason shall bear for him? Can he think that Palmyra will endure his
  rule?'</p>

  <p>'That,' replied Gracchus, 'must be his hope. The party of the discontented
  we well know to be large; upon them he thinks he may rely. Then his treason
  recommending him to Aurelian, he builds upon his power to establish him on
  the throne, and sustain him there till his own strength shall have grown, so
  that he can stand alone. That the city will surrender upon the news of the
  Queen's captivity, he doubtless calculates upon as certain.'</p>

  <p>'May his every hope,' cried Fausta, 'be blasted, and a little of the
  misery he has poured without stint into our hearts wring his own, and when he
  cries for mercy, may he find none!'</p>

  <p>'One hope,'I said here, 'if I know aught of the nature of Aurelian, and
  upon which he must chiefly found his project, will sink under him to his
  shame and ruin.'</p>

  <p>'What mean you?' said Fausta eagerly.</p>

  <p>'His belief that Aurelian will reward baseness though to an enemy. He
  never did it yet, and he cannot do it. Were there within the thick skull of
  Antiochus the brains of a foolish ostrich, he would have read in the fate of
  Heraclammon, the rich traitor of Tyana, his own. If I err not, he has
  indiscreetly enough thrust himself into a lion's den. If Aurelian is fierce,
  his is the grand and terrific ferocity of the king of beasts.'</p>

  <p>'May it be so!' said Fausta. 'There were no providence in the gods did
  such villany escape punishment, still less, did it grow great. But if
  Aurelian is such as you describe him, O then is there not reason in the
  belief that he will do gently by her? Were it compatible with greatness or
  generosity&mdash;and these, you say, belong to the Emperor&mdash;to take
  revenge upon an enemy, thrown by such means into his power? and such an
  enemy? and that too a woman? Julia too! O immortal gods, how bitter past
  drinking is this cup!'</p>

  <p>'Yet must you, must we, not lean too confidently upon the dispositions of
  Aurelian. He is subject, though supreme, to the state, nay, and in some sense
  to the army; and what he might gladly do of his own free and generous nature,
  policy and the contrary wishes and sometimes requisitions of his troops, or
  of the people, compel him to forbear. The usage of Rome toward captive
  princes has been, and is, cruel. Yet the Emperor does much to modify it,
  giving it, according to his own temper, a more or less savage character. And
  Aurelian has displayed great independence in his acts, both of people and
  soldiers. There is much ground for hope&mdash;but it must not pass into
  confident expectation.'</p>

  <p>'You, Lucius, in former days have known Aurelian well, before fortune
  raised him to this high eminence. You say you were his friend. Could you
  not&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'No, I fear with scarce any hope of doing good. My residence here during
  all these troubles will, I doubt not, raise suspicions in the mind of
  Aurelian which it will not be easy to allay. But whenever I shall have it in
  my power to present myself before him, I shall not fail to press upon him
  arguments which, if he shall act freely, cannot I think but weigh with
  him.'</p>

  <p>'Ought not the city now,' said Fausta, addressing Gracchus, 'to surrender,
  and, if it can do no better, throw itself upon the mercy of Aurelian? I see
  not now what can be gained by longer resistance, and would not a still
  protracted refusal to capitulate, and when it must be without the faintest
  expectation of ultimate success, tend merely and with certainty to exasperate
  Aurelian, and perhaps embitter him toward the Queen?'</p>

  <p>'I can scarcely doubt that it would,' replied Gracchus. 'The city ought to
  surrender. Soon as the first flood of grief has spent itself, must we hasten
  to accomplish it if possible. Longinus, to whom will now be entrusted the
  chief power, will advocate it I am sure&mdash;so will Otho, Seleucus,
  Gabrayas; but the army will, I fear, be opposed to it, and will, more through
  a certain pride of their order than from any principle, incline to hold
  out.&mdash;It is time I sought Longinus.'</p>

  <p>He departed in search of the Greek. I went forth into the streets to learn
  the opinions and observe the behavior of the people.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The shades of night are around me&mdash;the palace is
still&mdash;the city
  sleeps. I resume my pen to add a few words to this epistle, already long, but
  they are words that convey so much that I cannot but add them for my own
  pleasure not less than yours. They are in brief these,&mdash;Calpurnius is
  alive and once again returned to us. The conjecture of Isaac was a
  description of the truth. My brother, knowing well that if apprehended his
  death were certain, had in the outset resolved, if attacked, rather to
  provoke his death, and insure it in the violence of a conflict, than be
  reserved for the axe of the Roman executioner. But in the short moment in
  which he fell headlong into the river, it flashed across his mind&mdash;'The
  darkness favors my escape&mdash;I can reach the shore;' so swimming a short
  distance below the surface, falling down with the stream and softly rising,
  concealed himself among the reeds upon the margin of the stream. Finding the
  field in a short time wholly in possession of Isaac, he revealed himself and
  joined him, returning to the city as soon as the darkness of the night
  permitted. Here is a little gleam of light breaking through Fausta's almost
  solid gloom. A smile has once more played over her features.</p>

  <p>In the evening after Calpurnius's return, she tried her harp, but the
  sounds it gave out only seemed to increase her sorrow, and she threw it from
  her.</p>

  <p>'Music,' said Gracchus, 'is in its nature melancholy, and how, my child,
  can you think to forget or stifle grief by waking the strings of your harp,
  whose tones, of all other instruments, are the most melancholy? And yet
  sometimes sadness seeks sadness, and finds in it its best relief. But now,
  Fausta? rather let sleep be your minister and nurse.'</p>

  <p>So we parted. Farewell.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="letter15"
     id="letter15">LETTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT were a vain endeavor, my Curtius, to attempt to describe
the fever of
  indignation, and rage, and grief, that burned in the bosoms of this unhappy
  people, as soon as it was known that their Queen was a captive in the hands
  of the Romans. Those imprisoned upon suspicion of having been concerned in
  her betrayal would have been torn from their confinement, and sacrificed to
  the wrath of the citizens, in the first hours of their excitement, but for
  the formidable guard by which the prisons were defended. The whole population
  seemed to be in the streets and public places, giving and receiving with
  eagerness such intelligence as could be obtained. Their affliction is such as
  it would be had each one lost a parent or a friend. The men rave, or sit, or
  wander about listless and sad; the women weep; children catch the infection,
  and lament as for the greatest misfortune that could have overtaken them. The
  soldiers, at first dumb with amazement at so unlooked-for and unaccountable a
  catastrophe, afterward, upon learning that it fell out through the treason of
  Antiochus, bound themselves by oaths never to acknowledge or submit to his
  authority, though Aurelian himself should impose him upon them, nay, to
  sacrifice him to the violated honor of the empire, if ever he should fall
  into their power.</p>

  <p>Yet all are not such. The numbers are not contemptible of those who,
  openly or secretly, favor the cause and approve the act of Antiochus. He has
  not committed so great a crime without some prospect of advantage from it,
  nor without the assurance that a large party of the citizens, though not the
  largest, is with him, and will adhere to his fortunes. These are they, who
  think, and justly think, that the Queen has sacrificed the country to her
  insane ambition and pride. They cleave to Antiochus, not from personal regard
  toward him, but because he seems more available for their present purposes
  than any other, principally through his fool-hardy ambition; and, on the
  other hand, they abandon the Queen, not for want of personal affection, equal
  perhaps to what exists in any others, but because they conceive that the
  power of Rome is too mighty to contend with, and that their best interests
  rather than any extravagant notions of national honor, ought to prompt their
  measures.</p>

  <p>The city will now give itself up, it is probable, upon the first summons
  of Aurelian. The council and the senate have determined that to hold out
  longer than a few days more is impossible. The provisions of the public
  granaries are exhausted, and the people are already beginning to be pinched
  with hunger. The rich, and all who have been enabled to subsist upon their
  own stores, are now engaged in distributing what remains among the poorer
  sort, who are now thrown upon their compassion. May it not be, that I am to
  be a witness of a people dying of hunger! Gracchus and Fausta are busily
  employed in relieving the wants of the suffering.</p>

  <p>We have waited impatiently to hear the fate of the Queen. Many reports
  have prevailed, founded upon what has been observed from the walls. At one
  time, it has been said that she had perished under the hands of the
  executioner&mdash;at another, that the whole Roman camp had been seen to be
  thrown into wild tumult, and that she had doubtless fallen a sacrifice to the
  ungovernable fury of the licentious soldiery, I cannot think either report
  probable. Aurelian, if he revenged himself by her death, would reserve her
  for execution on the day of his triumph. But he would never tarnish his glory
  by such an act. And for the soldiers&mdash;I am sure of nothing more than
  that they are under too rigid a discipline, and hold Aurelian in too great
  terror, to dare to commit a violence like that which has been imputed to
  them.</p>

  <p>At length&mdash;for hours are months in such suspense&mdash;we are
  relieved. Letters have come from Nichomachus to both Longinus and Livia,</p>

  <p>First, their sum is, the Queen lives!</p>

  <p>I shall give you what I gather from them.</p>

  <p>'When we had parted,' writes the secretary, 'from the river's edge, we
  were led at a rapid pace over the same path we had just come, to the
  neighborhood of the Roman camp. I learned from what I overheard of the
  conversation of the Centurion with his companion at his side, that the flight
  of the Queen had been betrayed. But beyond that, nothing.</p>

  <p>'We were taken not at once to the presence of Aurelian, but lodged in one
  of the abandoned palaces in the outskirts of the city&mdash;that of Seleucus,
  if I err not&mdash;where? the Queen being assigned the apartments needful for
  her and her effects, a guard was set around the building.</p>

  <p>'Here we had remained not long, yet long enough for the Queen to exchange
  her disguise for her usual robes, when it was announced by the Centurion that
  we must proceed to the tent of the Emperor. The Queen and the Princess were
  placed in a close litter, and conveyed secretly there, out of fear of the
  soldiers, "who," said the Centurion, "if made aware of whom we carry, would
  in their rage tear to fragments and scatter to the winds both the litter and
  its burden."</p>

  <p>'We were in this manner borne through the camp to the tent of Aurelian. As
  we entered, the Emperor stood at its upper end, surrounded by the chief
  persons of his army. He advanced to meet the Queen, and in his changing
  countenance and disturbed manner might it be plainly seen how even an
  Emperor, and he the Emperor of the world, felt the presence of a majesty such
  as Zenobia's. And never did our great mistress seem more a Queen than
  now&mdash;not through that commanding pride which, when upon her throne, has
  impressed all who have approached her with a feeling of inferiority, but
  through a certain dark and solemn grandeur that struck with awe, as of some
  superior being, those who looked upon her. There was no sign of grief upon
  her countenance, but many of a deep and rooted sadness, such as might never
  pass away. No one could behold her and not lament the fortune that had
  brought her to such a pass. Whoever had thought to enjoy the triumph of
  exulting over the royal captive, was rebuked by that air of calm dignity and
  profound melancholy, which even against the will, touched the hearts of all,
  and forced their homage.</p>

  <p>'"It is a happy day for Rome," said Aurelian, approaching and saluting
  her, "that sees you, lately Queen of Palmyra and of the East, a captive in
  the tent of Aurelian."</p>

  <p>'"And a dark one for my afflicted country," replied the Queen.</p>

  <p>'"It might have been darker," rejoined the emperor, "had not the good
  providence of the gods delivered you into my hands."</p>

  <p>'"The gods preside not over treachery. And it must have been by treason
  among those in whom I have placed my most familiar trust, that I am now where
  and what I am. I can but darkly surmise by whose baseness the act has been
  committed. It had been a nobler triumph to you, Roman, and a lighter fall to
  me, had the field of battle decided the fate of my kingdom, and led me a
  prisoner to your tent."</p>

  <p>'"Doubtless it had been so," replied Aurelian; "yet was it for me to cast
  away what chance threw into my power? A war is now happily ended, which, had
  your boat reached the further bank of the Euphrates, might yet have
  raged&mdash;and but to the mutual harm of two great nations. Yet it was both
  a bold and sagacious device, and agrees well with what was done by you at
  Antioch, Emesa, and now in the defence of your city, A more determined, a
  better appointed, or more desperate foe, I have never yet contended
  with."</p>

  <p>'"It were strange, indeed," replied the Queen, "if you met not with a
  determined foe, when life and liberty were to be defended. Had not treason,
  base and accursed treason, given me up like a chained slave to your power,
  yonder walls must have first been beaten piecemeal down by your engines, and
  buried me beneath their ruins, and famine clutched all whom the sword had
  spared, ere we had owned you master. What is life, when liberty and
  independence are gone?"</p>

  <p>'"But why, let me ask," said Aurelian?"were you moved to assert an
  independency of Rome? How many peaceful and prosperous years have rolled on
  since Trajan and the Antonines, while you and Rome were at harmony; a part of
  us and yet independent; allies rather than a subject province; using our
  power for your defence; yet owning no allegiance. Why was this order
  disturbed? What madness ruled to turn you against the power of Rome?"</p>

  <p>'"The same madness," replied Zenobia, "that tells Aurelian he may yet
  possess the whole world, and sends him here into the far East to wage
  needless war with a woman&mdash;Ambition! Yet had Aurelian always been upon
  the Roman throne, or one resembling him, it had perhaps been different. There
  then could have been naught but honor in any alliance that had bound together
  Rome and Palmyra. But was I, was the late renowned Odenatus, to confess
  allegiance to base souls such as Aureolus, Gallienus, Balista? While the
  thirty tyrants were fighting for the Roman crown, was I to sit still, waiting
  humbly to become the passive prey of whosoever might please to call me his?
  By the immortal gods, not so! I asserted my supremacy, and made it felt; and
  in times of tumult and confusion to Rome, while her Eastern provinces were
  one scene of discord and civil broil, I came in and reduced the jarring
  elements, and out of parts broken and sundered, and hostile, constructed a
  fair and well-proportioned whole. And when once created, and I had tasted the
  sweets of sovereign and despotic power&mdash;what they are thou
  knowest&mdash;was I tamely to yield the whole at the word or threat even of
  Aurelian? It could not be. So many years as had passed and seen me Queen, not
  of Palmyra only, but of the East&mdash;a sovereign honored and courted at
  Rome, feared by Persia, my alliance sought by all the neighboring dominions
  of Asia&mdash;had served but to foster in me that love of rule which
  descended to me from a long line of kings. Sprung from a royal line, and so
  long upon a throne, it was superior force alone&mdash;divine or
  human&mdash;that should drag me from my right. Thou hast been but four years
  king, Aurelian, monarch of the great Roman world, yet wouldst thou not, but
  with painful unwillingness, descend and mingle with the common herd. For me,
  ceasing to reign, I would cease to live."</p>

  <p>'"Thy speech," said Aurelian, "shows thee well worthy to reign. It is no
  treason to Rome, Carus, to lament that the fates have cast down from a
  throne? one who filled its seat so well. Hadst thou hearkened to the message
  of Petronius, thou mightest still, lady, have sat upon thy native seat. The
  crown of Palmyra might still have girt thy brow."</p>

  <p>'"But not of the East," rejoined the Queen.</p>

  <p>'"Fight against ambition, Carus! thou seest how, by aiming at too much, it
  loses all. It is the bane of humanity. When I am dead, may ambition then die,
  nor rise again."</p>

  <p>'"May it be so," replied his general; "it has greatly cursed the world. It
  were better perhaps that it died now."</p>

  <p>'"It cannot," replied Aurelian; "its life is too strong. I lament too,
  great Queen, for so I may well call thee, that upon an ancient defender of
  our Roman honor, upon her who revenged Rome upon the insolent Persian, this
  heavy fate should fall. I would willingly have met for the first time in a
  different way the brave conqueror of Sapor, the avenger of the wrongs and
  insults of the virtuous Valerian. The debt of Rome to Zenobia is great, and
  shall yet, in some sort at least, be paid. Curses upon those who moved thee
  to this war. They have brought this calamity upon thee, Queen, not I, nor
  thou. What ill designing aspirants have urged thee on? This is not a woman's
  war."</p>

  <p>'"Was not that a woman's war," replied the Queen, "that drove the Goths
  from upper Asia? Was not that a woman's war that hemmed Sapor in his capital,
  and seized his camp? and that which beat Heraclianus, and gained thereby
  Syria and Mesopotamia? and that which worsted Probus, and so won the crown of
  Egypt? Does it ask for more, to be beaten by Romans, than to conquer these?
  Rest assured, great prince, that the war was mine. My people were indeed with
  me, but it was I who roused, fired, and led them on. I had indeed great
  advisers. Their names are known throughout the world. Why should I name the
  renowned Longinus, the princely Gracchus, the invincible Zabdas, the honest
  Otho? Their names are honored in Rome as well as here. They have been with
  me; but without lying or vanity, I may say I have been their head."</p>

  <p>'"Be it so; nevertheless, thy services shall be remembered. But let us now
  to the affairs before us. The city has not surrendered&mdash;though thy
  captivity is known, the gates still are shut. A word from thee would open
  them."</p>

  <p>'"It is a word I cannot speak," replied the Queen; her countenance
  expressing now, instead of sorrow, indignation. "Wouldst thou that I too
  should turn traitor?"</p>

  <p>'"It surely would not be that," replied the Emperor. "It can avail naught
  to contend further&mdash;it can but end in a wider destruction, both of your
  people and my soldiers."</p>

  <p>'"Longinus, I may suppose," said Zenobia, "is now supreme. Let the Emperor
  address him, and what is right will be done."</p>

  <p>'Aurelian turned, and held a brief conversation with some of his
  officers.</p>

  <p>'"Within the walls," said the Emperor, again addressing the Queen, "thou
  hast sons. Is it not so?"</p>

  <p>'"It is not they," said the Queen quickly, her countenance growing pale,
  "it is not they, nor either of them, who have conspired against me!"</p>

  <p>'"No&mdash;not quite so. Yet he who betrayed thee calls himself of thy
  family. Thy sons surely were not in league with him. Soldiers," cried the
  Emperor, "lead forth the great Antiochus, and his slave."</p>

  <p>'At his name, the Queen started&mdash;the Princess uttered a faint cry,
  and seemed as if she would have fallen.</p>

  <p>'A fold of the tent was drawn aside, and the huge form of Antiochus
  appeared, followed by the Queen's slave, her head bent down and eyes cast
  upon the ground. If a look could have killed, the first glance of Zenobia, so
  full of a withering contempt, would have destroyed her base kinsman. He
  heeded it but so much as to blush and turn away his face from her. Upon
  Sindarina the Queen gazed with a look of deepest sorrow. The beautiful slave
  stood there where she entered, not lifting her head, but her bosom rising and
  falling with some great emotion&mdash;conscious, as it seemed, that the
  Queen's look was fastened upon her, and fearing to meet it. But it was so
  only for a moment, when raising her head, and revealing a countenance swollen
  with grief, she rushed toward the Queen, and threw herself at her feet,
  embracing them, and covering them with kisses. Her deep sobs took away all
  power of speech. The Queen only said, "My poor Sindarina!"</p>

  <p>'The stern voice of Aurelian was first heard, "Bear her away&mdash;bear
  her from the tent."</p>

  <p>'A guard seized her, and forcibly separating her from Zenobia, bore her
  weeping away.</p>

  <p>'"This," said Aurelian, turning now to Zenobia, "this is thy kinsman, as
  he tells me&mdash;the Prince Antiochus?"</p>

  <p>'The Queen replied not.</p>

  <p>'"He has done Rome a great service." Antiochus raised his head, and
  straightened his stooping shoulders, "He has the merit of ending a weary and
  disastrous war. It is a rare fortune to fall to any one. 'Tis a work to grow
  great upon. Yet, Prince," turning to Antiochus, "the work is not complete.
  The city yet holds out. If I am to reward thee with the sovereign power, as
  thou sayest, thou must open the gates. Canst thou do it?"</p>

  <p>'"Great Prince," replied the base spirit eagerly, "it is provided for.
  Allow me but a few moments, and a place proper for it, and the gates I
  warrant shall quickly swing upon their hinges."</p>

  <p>'"Ah! do you say so? That is well. What, I pray, is the process?"</p>

  <p>'"At a signal which I shall make, noble Prince, and which has been agreed
  upon, every head of every one of the Queen's party rolls in the
  dust&mdash;Longinus, Gracchus, and his daughter, Seleucus, Gabrayas, and a
  host more&mdash;their heads fall. The gates are then to be thrown open."</p>

  <p>'"Noble Palmyrene, you have the thanks of all. Of the city then we are at
  length secure. For this, thou wouldst have the rule of it under Rome,
  wielding a sceptre in the name of the Roman Senate, and paying tribute as a
  subject province? Is it not so?"</p>

  <p>'"It is. That is what I would have, and would do, most excellent
  Aurelian."</p>

  <p>'"Who are thy associates in this? Are the Queen's sons, Herennianus,
  Timolaus, Vabalathus, of thy side, and partners in this enterprise?"</p>

  <p>'"They are not privy to the design to deliver up to thy great power the
  Queen their mother; but they are my friends, and most surely do I count upon
  their support. As I shall return king of Palmyra, they will gladly share my
  power."</p>

  <p>'"But if friends of thine, they are enemies of mine," rejoined Aurelian,
  in terrific tones; "they are seeds of future trouble; they may sprout up into
  kings also, to Rome's annoyance. They must be crushed. Dost thou understand
  me?"</p>

  <p>'"I do, great Prince. Leave them to me. I will do for them. But to say the
  truth they are too weak to disturb any&mdash;friends or enemies."</p>

  <p>'"Escape not so. They must die." roared Aurelian.</p>

  <p>'"They shall&mdash;they shall," ejaculated the alarmed Antiochus; "soon as
  I am within the walls their heads shall be sent to thee."</p>

  <p>'"That now is as I would have it. One thing more thou hast
  asked&mdash;that the fair slave who accompanies thee be spared to thee, to be
  thy Queen."</p>

  <p>'"It was her desire&mdash;hers, noble Aurelian, not mine."</p>

  <p>'"But didst thou not engage to her as much?"</p>

  <p>'"Truly I did. But among princes such words are but politic ones: that is
  well understood. Kings marry for the state. I would be higher matched;" and
  the sensual demon cast his eyes significantly towards the Princess Julia.</p>

  <p>'"Am I understood?" continued Antiochus, Aurelian making no response. "The
  Princess Julia I would raise to the throne." The monster seemed to dilate to
  twice his common size, as his mind fed upon the opening glories.</p>

  <p>'Aurelian had turned from him, looking first at his Roman attendants, then
  at the Queen and Julia&mdash;his countenance kindling with some swelling
  passion.</p>

  <p>'"Do I understand thee?" he then said. "I understand thee to say that for
  the bestowment of the favors and honors thou hast named, thou wilt do the
  things thou hast now specifically promised? Is it not so?"</p>

  <p>'"It is, gracious king."</p>

  <p>'"Dost thou swear it?"</p>

  <p>'"I swear it by the great God of Light!"</p>

  <p>'The countenance of the Emperor now grew black with as it seemed mingled
  fury and contempt. Antiochus started, and his cheek paled. A little light
  reached his thick brain.</p>

  <p>'"Romans," cried Aurelian, "pardon me for so abusing your ears! And you,
  our royal captives! I knew not that such baseness lived&mdash;still less that
  it was here. Thou foul stigma upon humanity! Why opens not the earth under
  thee, but that it loathes and rejects thee! Is a Roman like thee, dost thou
  think, to reward thy unheard-of treacheries? Thou knowest no more what a
  Roman is, than what truth and honor are. Soldiers! seize yonder miscreant,
  write traitor on his back, and spurn him forth the camp. His form and his
  soul both offend alike. Hence, monster!"</p>

  <p>'Antiochus was like one thunderstruck. Trembling in every joint, he sought
  to appeal to the Emperor's mercy, but the guard stopped his mouth, and
  dragged him from the tent. His shrieks pierced the air as the soldiers
  scourged him beyond the encampment.</p>

  <p>'"It was not for me," said Aurelian, as these ceased to be heard, "to
  refuse what fate threw into my hands. Though I despise the traitorous
  informer, I could not shut my ear to the facts he revealed, without myself
  betraying the interests of Rome. But, believe me, it was information I would
  willingly have spared, My infamy were as his to have rewarded the traitor.
  Fear not, great Queen; I pledge the word of a Roman and an Emperor for thy
  safety. Thou art safe both from Roman and Palmyrene."</p>

  <p>'"What I have but now been witness of," replied the Queen, "assures me
  that in the magnanimity of Aurelian I may securely rest."</p>

  <p>'"As the Queen uttered these words, a sound as of a distant tumult, and
  the uproar of a multitude, caught the ears of all within the tent.</p>

  <p>'"What mean these tumultuous cries?" inquired Aurelian of his attending
  guard. "They increase and approach."</p>

  <p>'"It may be but the soldiers at their game with Antiochus," replied
  Probus.</p>

  <p>'But it was not so. At the moment a Centurion, breathless, and with his
  head bare, rushed madly into the tent.</p>

  <p>'"Speak," said the Emperor, "what is it?"</p>

  <p>'"The legions!" said the Centurion, as soon as he could command his words,
  "the legions are advancing, crying out for the Queen of Palmyra! They have
  broken from their camp and their leaders, and in one mixed body come to
  surround the Emperor's tent."</p>

  <p>'"As he ended, the fierce cries of the enraged soldiery were distinctly
  heard, like the roaring of a forest torn by a tempest. Aurelian, baring his
  sword, and calling upon his friends to do the same, sprang toward the
  entrance of the tent. They were met by the dense throng of the soldiers, who
  now pressed against the tent, and whose savage yells now could be
  heard,&mdash;</p>

  <p>'"The head of Zenobia."&mdash;"Deliver the Queen to our
  will."&mdash;"Throw out the head of Zenobia, and we will return to our
  quarters."&mdash;"She belongs to us."</p>

  <p>'At the same moment the sides of the tent were thrown up, showing the
  whole plain filled with the heaving multitude, and being itself instantly
  crowded with the ringleaders and their more desperate associates. Zenobia,
  supporting the Princess, who clung to her, and pale through a just
  apprehension of every horror, but otherwise firm and undaunted, cried out to
  Aurelian, "Save us, O Emperor, from this foul butchery!"</p>

  <p>'"We will die else!" replied the Emperor; who with the word, sprang upon a
  soldier making toward the Queen, and with a blow clove him to the earth. Then
  swinging round him that sword which had drunk the blood of thousands, and
  followed by the gigantic Sandarion, by Probus, and Carus, a space around the
  Queen was soon cleared.</p>

  <p>'"Back, ruffians," cried Aurelian, in a voice of thunder, "for you are no
  longer Romans! back to the borders of the tent. There I will hear your
  complaints." The soldiers fell back, and their ferocious cries ceased.</p>

  <p>'"Now," cried the Emperor, addressing them, "what is your will, that thus
  in wild disorder you throng my tent?"</p>

  <p>'One from the crowd replied&mdash;"Our will is that the Queen of Palmyra
  be delivered to us as our right, instantly. Thousands and thousands of our
  bold companions lie buried upon these accursed plains, slain by her and her
  fiery engines. We demand her life. It is but justice, and faint justice
  too."</p>

  <p>'"Her life!"&mdash;"Her life!"&mdash;arose in one shout from the
  innumerable throng.</p>

  <p>'The Emperor raised his hand, waving his sword dropping with the blood of
  the slain soldier; the noise subsided; and his voice, clear and loud like the
  tone of a trumpet, went to the farthest bounds of the multitude.</p>

  <p>'"Soldiers," he cried, "you ask for justice; and justice you shall
  have."&mdash;"Aurelian is ever just!" cried many voices.&mdash;"But you shall
  not have the life of the Queen of Palmyra."&mdash;He paused; a low murmur
  went through the crowd.&mdash;"Or you must first take the life of your
  Emperor, and of these who stand with him."&mdash;The soldiers were
  silent.&mdash;"In asking the life of Zenobia," he continued, "you know not
  what you ask. Are any here who went with Valerian to the Persian war?" A few
  voices responded, "I was there,&mdash;and I,&mdash;and I."&mdash;"Are there
  any here whose parents, or brothers, or friends fell into the tiger clutches
  of the barbarian Sapor, and died miserably in hopeless captivity?"&mdash;Many
  voices every where throughout the crowd were heard in reply, "Yes,
  yes,&mdash;Mine were there, and mine."&mdash;"Did you ever hear it said,"
  continued Aurelian, "that Rome lifted a finger for their rescue, or for that
  of the good Valerian?"&mdash;They were silent, some crying, "No,
  no."&mdash;"Know then, that when Rome forgot her brave soldiers and her
  Emperor, Zenobia remembered and avenged them; and Rome fallen into contempt
  with the Persian, was raised to her ancient renown by the arms of her ally,
  the brave Zenobia, and her dominions throughout the East saved from the grasp
  of Sapor only by her valor. While Gallienus wallowed in sensuality and forgot
  Rome, and even his own great father, the Queen of Palmyra stood forth, and
  with her royal husband, the noble Odenatus, was in truth the savior of the
  empire. And is it her life you would have? Were that a just return? Were that
  Roman magnanimity? And grant that thousands of your brave companions lie
  buried upon these plains: it is but the fortune of war. Were they not slain
  in honorable fight, in the siege of a city, for its defence unequalled in all
  the annals of war? Cannot Romans honor courage and conduct, though in an
  enemy? But you ask for justice. I have said you shall have justice. You
  shall. It is right that the heads and advisers of this revolt, for such the
  senate deems it, should be cut off. It is the ministers of princes who are
  the true devisers of a nation's acts. These, when in our power, shall be
  yours. And now, who, soldiers! stirred up this mutiny, bringing inexpiable
  shame upon our brave legions? Who are the leaders of the tumult?"</p>

  <p>'Enough were found to name them;</p>

  <p>'"Firmus! Carinus! the Centurions Plancus! Tatius! Burrhus! Valens!
  Crispinus!"</p>

  <p>'"Guards! seize them and hew them down. Soldiers! to your tents." The
  legions fell back as tumultuously as they had come together; the faster, as
  the dying groans of the slaughtered ringleaders fell upon their ears.</p>

  <p>'The tent of the Emperor was once more restored to order. After a brief
  conversation, in which Aurelian expressed his shame for the occurrence of
  such disorders in the presence of the Queen, the guard were commanded to
  convey back to the palace of Seleucus, whence they had been taken, Zenobia
  and the Princess.'</p>

  <p>Such are the principal matters contained in the communications of
  Nichomachus.</p>

  <p>When the facts contained in them became known, the senate, the council,
  the army, and the people, agreed in the belief, that the Queen's safety and
  their own would now be best secured by an immediate capitulation.
  Accordingly, heralds bearing letters from Longinus, in the name of the
  council, proceeded to the Roman camp. No other terms could be obtained than a
  verbal promise that the city, the walls, and the common people should be
  spared; but the surrender, beyond that, must be unconditional.</p>

  <p>Upon learning the terms prescribed by the conqueror, many were for further
  resistance. 'The language of Aurelian,' they said, 'is ambiguous. He will
  spare the city, walls, and common people. Are our senators and counsellors to
  be sacrificed? Are they, who have borne the burden of the day, now to be
  selected, as the only ones who are to suffer? It shall not be so.'</p>

  <p>Generous sentiments like these were heard on all sides. But they were
  answered and overcome, by Gracchus especially, and others. Said Gracchus to
  the people, 'Doubtless punishment will be inflicted by Rome upon some. Our
  resistance is termed by her, rebellion, revolt, conspiracy; the leaders will
  be sought and punished. It is ever her course. But this is a light evil
  compared with a wide-spread massacre of this whole population, the
  destruction of these famous temples, the levelling of these proud walls.
  Aurelian has said that these shall he spared. His word, though an unwritten
  and informal one, may he trusted. My counsel is, that it be at once accepted.
  What if a few grey heads among us are taken off? That will not touch the
  existence or prosperity of Palmyra. You can spare them. Your children will
  soon grow up to take our places, and fill them, I hope, with a better
  wisdom.'</p>

  <p>But such words only served at first the more to strengthen the people in
  their resolution, that their rulers should not be the only sacrifice. None
  were loved throughout the city more than Gracchus and Otho, none revered like
  Longinus. It was a long and painful struggle between affection and the
  convictions of reason before it ended, and the consent of the people was
  obtained to deliver up the city to the mercy of Aurelian. But it was
  obtained.</p>

  <p>I was sitting with Fausta and Calpurnius, speaking of the things that had
  happened, and of the conduct of the Queen, when Gracchus entered and joined
  us, informing us that 'ambassadors were now gone to the camp of Aurelian,
  clothed with authority to deliver up the city into his hands. So that now the
  end has drawn on, and Palmyra ceases to exist.'</p>

  <p>Fausta, although knowing that this must happen, and might at any moment,
  could not hear the fatal words, announcing the death of her country, as she
  deemed it, and quenching forever in darkness the bright dreams upon which she
  had fed so long, without renewed grief. We were a long time silent.</p>

  <p>'Something yet remains,' at length Gracchus resumed, 'for us to resolve
  upon and do. Before many hours have elapsed, a Roman army will fill the
  streets of the city, perhaps our houses also, and a general plunder may be
  commenced of all the valuables we possess. It will be useless to conceal what
  it will be well enough known, from the manner in which we live, must be
  beneath our roof. It will but expose our lives. Yet, Fausta, your jewels,
  valued by you as gifts, and other things precious for the same or a like
  reason, may easily be secreted, nor yet be missed by the licensed robbers.
  See to this, my child; but except this there is now naught to do concerning
  such affairs, but to sit still and observe the general wreck. But there are
  other and weightier matters to be decided upon, and that at once.'</p>

  <p>'Concerning the care of ourselves, you mean?' said Fausta.</p>

  <p>'I do,' replied Gracchus.</p>

  <p>'I,' said Fausta, 'would remain here, where I am.'</p>

  <p>'It is that which I wish,' replied her father. 'I commit you to the care
  of Lucius. For Calpurnius, he must leave you, and as he would live, fly if
  that yet be possible beyond the walls, or conceal himself within them.'</p>

  <p>'Never!' said Calpurnius; 'I can do neither. I have never shunned a
  danger&mdash;and I cannot.'</p>

  <p>'Let pride and passion now,' said Gracchus, 'go fast asleep. We have no
  occasion for them; they are out of place, dealing as we now do with stern
  necessities. Your life will be especially sought by Aurelian; it is a life
  that cannot be spared. Fausta needs you. In you she must find, or nowhere,
  father, husband, friend. Lucius, when these troubles are over, will return to
  Rome, and I shall be in the keeping of Aurelian. You must live; for her sake,
  if not for your own.'</p>

  <p>'For mine too, surely, if for hers,' replied Calpurnius.</p>

  <p>'Father,' said Fausta, throwing her arms around him, 'why, why must you
  fall into the hands of Aurelian? Why not, with Calpurnius, fly from these now
  hated walls?'</p>

  <p>'My daughter!' replied Gracchus, 'let not your love of me make you
  forgetful of what I owe my own name and our country's. Am I not bound by the
  words of Aurelian?&mdash;"He will spare the city and the common
  people"&mdash;reserving for himself their rulers and advisers. Were they all
  to fly or shrink into concealment, can we doubt that then the fury of the
  fierce Roman would discharge itself upon the helpless people, and men, women
  and children suffer in our stead? And shall I fly while the rest are true to
  their trust?'</p>

  <p>'The gods forbid!' sobbed Fausta.</p>

  <p>'Now you are yourself again. Life is of little account with me. For you I
  would willingly hold on upon it, though in any event my grasp would be
  rapidly growing weaker and weaker; age would come and weaken and dissolve it.
  But for myself, I can truly say, I survey the prospect of death with
  indifference. Life is one step; death is another. I have taken the first, I
  am as ready to take the second. But to preserve life, agreeable as I have
  found it, by any sacrifice&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'O, that were dying twice!' said Fausta; 'I know it.'</p>

  <p>'Be thankful then that I shall die but once, and so dry your tears. Of
  nothing am I more clear, than that if the loss of my head will bring security
  to the city and the people, I can offer it to the executioner with scarce a
  single regret. But let us leave this. But few hours remain to do what is yet
  to be done.'</p>

  <p>It was so indeed. Already the commotion in the streets indicated that the
  entrance of the Roman army was each moment expected.</p>

  <p>It was determined that Calpurnius should avail himself of the old conduit,
  and fly beyond the walls. To this he consented, though with pain; and bidding
  us farewell, departed. Fausta retired to fulfil the injunctions of her
  father, while Gracchus employed himself in arranging a few papers, to be
  entrusted to my keeping.</p>

  <p>In the course of a few hours the gates of the city were thrown open, and
  the army of the conqueror made its unobstructed entrance. Soon as the walls
  were secured, the towers of the gates, and the arms of the Queen's remaining
  forces, Aurelian himself approached, and by the Roman gate passed into a city
  that had cost him so dear to gain. He rode through its principal streets and
  squares, gazing with admiration at the magnificence which every where met his
  view. As he arrived at the far-famed Temple of the Sun, and was told to what
  deity it was dedicated, he bared his head, flung himself from his horse, and
  on foot, followed by an innumerable company of Romans, ascended its long
  flight of steps, and there within its walls returned solemn thanks to the
  great God of Light, the protecting deity of his house, for the success that
  had crowned his arms.</p>

  <p>When this act of worship had been performed, and votive offerings had been
  hung upon the columns of the temple, the Emperor came forth, and after
  visiting and inspecting all that was beautiful and rare, made proclamation of
  his will concerning the city and its inhabitants. This was, that all gold and
  silver, precious stones, all pictures, statues, and other works of art, were
  to be placed in the hands of the Romans, and that all the members of the
  Queen's senate and council, with the nobility, were to be delivered up as
  prisoners of war, together with certain specified portions of the army.
  Beyond these requisitions, the persons and property of the citizens were to
  be respected. No violence of any kind on the part of the soldiers would be
  allowed, or pardoned if committed.</p>

  <p>Immediately upon this, the Roman army was converted into a body of
  laborers and artisans, employed in the construction of wains of every form
  and size, for the transportation across the desert to the sea-coast, of
  whatever would adorn the triumph of Aurelian, or add to the riches of the
  great capital of the world. Vast numbers of elephants and camels were
  collected from the city, and from all the neighboring territory, with which
  to drag the huge and heavy loaded wagons through the deep sands and over the
  rough and rocky plains of Syria. The palaces of the nobles and the wealthy
  merchants have been stripped of every embellishment of art and taste. The
  private and public gardens, the fountains, the porticos, have each and all
  been robbed of every work, in either marble or brass, which had the
  misfortune or the merit to have been wrought by artists of distinguished
  names. The palaces of the Queen and of Longinus were objects of especial
  curiosity and desire, and, as it were, their entire contents, after being
  secured with utmost art from possibility of injury, have been piled upon
  carriages prepared for them, ready for their journey toward Rome. It was
  pitiful to look on and see this wide desolation of scenes, that so little
  while ago had offered to the eye all that the most cultivated taste could
  have required for its gratification. The citizens stood around in groups,
  silent witnesses of the departing glories of their city and nation.</p>

  <p>But the sight saddest of all to behold, was that of the senators and
  counsellors of Palmyra, led guarded from the city to the camp of Aurelian.
  All along the streets through which they passed, the people stood in dumb and
  motionless array, to testify in that expressive manner their affection and
  their grief. Voices were indeed occasionally heard invoking the blessings of
  the gods upon them, or imprecating curses upon the head of the scourge
  Aurelian. Whenever Longinus and Gracchus appeared, their names were uttered
  in the tones with which children would cry out to venerated parents, whom
  they beheld for the last time; beheld borne away from them by a power they
  could not resist to captivity or death. No fear of the legion that surrounded
  them availed to repress or silence such testimonies of regard. And if
  confidence was reposed in the Roman soldiery, that they would not, because
  conquerors and the power was theirs, churlishly deny them the freedom to
  relieve in that manner their over-burdened hearts, it was not&mdash;happy was
  I, as a Roman, to witness it&mdash;misplaced. They resented it not either by
  word or look or act, but moved on like so many statues in mail, turning
  neither to the one hand nor the other, nor apparently so much as hearing the
  reproaches which were by some lavished upon them and their Emperor.</p>

  <p>Livia, Faustula, and the other inmates of the palace have joined Zenobia
  and Julia, by order of Aurelian, at the house of Seleucus. The Caesars,
  Herennianus and Timolaus, have fled or concealed themselves; Vabalathus has
  surrendered himself, and has accompanied the princesses to the Roman
  camp.</p>

  <p>How desolate is the house of Gracchus, deprived of its princely
  head!&mdash;especially as the mind cannot help running forward and
  conjecturing the fate which awaits him. Fausta surrenders herself to her
  grief&mdash;loss of country and of parent, at one and the same moment, is
  loss too great for her to bear with fortitude. Her spirit, so alive to
  affection and every generous sentiment, is almost broken by these sorrows and
  disappointments. I did not witness the parting between her and Gracchus, and
  happy am I that I did not. Her agony was in proportion to her love and her
  sensibility. I have not met her since. She remains within her own apartments,
  seen only by her favorite slaves. A double darkness spreads around while
  Fausta too is withdrawn.</p>

  <p>It appeared to me now, my Curtius, as if something might be done on my
  part in behalf of Gracchus. According to the usages of Rome, the chief
  persons among the prisoners, and who might be considered as the leaders of
  the rebellion, I knew would die either at once, or at farthest, when Aurelian
  should re-enter Rome as the conqueror of the East. I considered that by
  reason of the growing severity of the Emperor toward all, friends as well as
  foes&mdash;amounting, as many now deem, to cruelty&mdash;the danger to
  Gracchus was extreme, beyond any power perhaps to avert. Yet I remembered, at
  the same time, the generous traits in Aurelian's character; his attachment
  toward old friends; his gratitude for services rendered him in the early part
  of his life, while making his way up through the lower posts of the army. It
  seemed to me that he was open to solicitation; that he would not refuse to
  hear me&mdash;a friend&mdash;the son of Cneius Piso&mdash;with what object
  soever I might present myself before him: and that, consequently, there was
  from this quarter a ray of hope, however small, for the father of our beloved
  Fausta.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, so soon as the affairs at first calling for the entire
  devotion of Aurelian were through, and I knew that his leisure would allow of
  an interruption, I sought the Roman camp, and asked an audience of the
  Emperor. It was immediately granted.</p>

  <p>As I entered his tent, Aurelian was seated at a table holding in his hand
  a parchment scroll, which he seemed intently considering. His stern
  countenance lowered over it like a thunder-cloud. I stood there where I had
  entered a few moments before he seemed aware of the presence of any one. His
  eye then falling almost accidentally upon me, he suddenly rose, and with the
  manner of his ancient friendship warmly greeted me.</p>

  <p>'I am glad,' said he, 'to meet so true a Roman in these distant
  parts.'</p>

  <p>'I am still a true Roman,'I replied, 'notwithstanding I have been, during
  this siege, upon the side of the enemy.'</p>

  <p>'I doubt it not. I am not ignorant of the causes that led you to Palmyra,
  and have detained you there. Henceforward your Roman blood must be held of
  the purest, for as I learn, and since I have seen can believe, they are few
  who have come within the magic circle of the late Queen, who have not lost
  their name and freedom&mdash;themselves fastening on the chains of her
  service.'</p>

  <p>'You have heard truly. Her court and camp are filled with those who at
  first perhaps sought her capital, as visiters of curiosity or traffic, but
  being once within the marvellous influence of her presence, have remained
  there her friends or servants. She is irresistible.'</p>

  <p>'And well nigh so in war too. In Rome they make themselves merry at my
  expense, inasmuch as I have been warring thus with a woman&mdash;not a poet
  in the garrets of the Via Coeli, but has entertained the city with his
  couplets upon the invincible Aurelian, beset here in the East by an army of
  women, who seem likely to subdue him by their needles or their charms. Nay,
  the Senate looks on and laughs. By the immortal gods! they know not of what
  they speak. Julius Caesar himself, Piso, never displayed a better genius than
  this woman. Twice have I saved my army but by stratagem. I give the honor of
  those days to Zenobia. It belongs to her rather than to me. Palmyra may well
  boast of Antioch and Emesa. Your brother did her good service there. I trust,
  for your sake and for mine, he will not fall into my hands.'</p>

  <p>That dark and cruel frown, which marks Aurelian, grew above and around his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>'I never,' he continued, 'forgive a traitor to his country.'</p>

  <p>'Yet,'I ventured to say, 'surely the circumstances of his captivity, and
  long abandonment, may plead somewhat in extenuation of his fault.'</p>

  <p>'Never. His crime is beyond the reach of pardon.'</p>

  <p>Aurelian had evidently supposed that I came to seek favor for Calpurnius.
  But this I had not intended to do, as Calpurnius had long ago resolved never
  again to dwell within the walls of Rome, I then opened the subject of my
  visit.</p>

  <p>'I have come,'I said, 'not to seek the pardon of Calpurnius Piso. Such, to
  my grief, is his hostility toward Rome, that he would neither seek nor accept
  mercy at her hands. He has forsworn his country, and never willingly will set
  foot within her borders. He dwells henceforward in Asia. But there is
  another&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'You would speak of Gracchus. It cannot be. Longinus excepted, he is the
  first citizen of Palmyra. If the Queen be spared, these must suffer. It is
  due to the army, and to justice, and to vengeance. The soldiers have clamored
  for the blood of Zenobia, and it has been at no small cost that her and her
  daughter's life have been redeemed. But I have sworn it, they shall live; my
  blood shall flow before theirs. Zenobia has done more for Rome than many an
  Emperor. Besides, I would that Rome should see with her own eyes who it is
  has held even battle with Roman legions so long, that they may judge me to
  have had a worthy antagonist. She must grace my triumph.'</p>

  <p>'I truly thank the gods,'I said, 'that it is so resolved! Fortune has
  placed me, while in her dominions, near the Queen, and though a Roman, I have
  come to love and revere her even like a Palmyrene. Would that the like
  clemency might be shown toward Gracchus! There is no greatness like
  mercy.'</p>

  <p>'I may not, noble Piso, win glory to myself at the cost of Rome. On the
  field of battle I and Rome win together. In pardoning her enemies fallen into
  my power, I may indeed crown myself with the praise of magnanimity in the eye
  of the world, while by the same act I wound my country. No rebellion is
  quelled, till the heads that moved and guided it are off&mdash;off. Who is
  ignorant that Longinus, that subtle Greek, has been the master-spring in this
  great revolt? and hand and hand with him Gracchus? Well should I deserve the
  gibes and sneers of the Roman mob, if I turned my back upon the great work I
  have achieved, leaving behind me spirits like these to brew fresh trouble.
  Nor, holding to this as it may seem to you harsh decision, am I forgetful,
  Piso, of our former friendship; nor of the helping hand often stretched out
  to do me service of Cneius Piso, your great parent. I must trust in this to
  your generosity or justice, to construe me aright. Fidelity to Rome must come
  before private friendship, or even gratitude. Am I understood?'</p>

  <p>'I think so.'</p>

  <p>'Neither must you speak to me of Longinus the learned Greek&mdash;the
  accomplished scholar&mdash;the great philosopher. He has thrown aside the
  scholar and the philosopher in putting on the minister. He is to me known
  only as the Queen's chief adviser; Palmyra's strength; the enemy of Rome. As
  such he has been arrayed against me; as such he has fallen a prisoner into my
  hands; as such he must feel the sword of the Roman executioner.
  Gracchus&mdash;I would willingly for thy sake, Piso, spare him&mdash;the
  more, as I hear thou art betrothed to his far-famed daughter, she who upon
  the fields of Antioch and Emesa filled with amazement even Roman
  soldiers.'</p>

  <p>To say that instead of me it was Calpurnius to whom she was betrothed,
  would seem to have sealed the fate of Gracchus at the moment there was a
  gleam of hope. I only said,</p>

  <p>'She was the life of the Queen's army. She falls but little below her
  great mistress.'</p>

  <p>'I believe it. These women of Palmyra are the true wonder of the age. When
  for the first time I found myself before Zenobia and her daughter, it is no
  shame for me to confess that it was hard for the moment to believe myself
  Aurelian and conqueror. I was ready to play the subject; I scarce kept myself
  from an oriental prostration. Never, Piso, was such beauty seen in Rome. Rome
  now has an Empress worthy of her&mdash;unless a Roman Emperor may sue in
  vain. Think you not with me? You have seen the Princess Julia?'</p>

  <p>You can pity me, Curtius and Lucilia. I said only,</p>

  <p>'I have. Her beauty is rare indeed, but by many, nay by most, her sister,
  the Princess Livia, is esteemed before her.'</p>

  <p>'Hah! Nay, but that cannot be. The world itself holds not another like the
  elder Princess, much less the same household. He seemed as if he would have
  added more, but his eye fell upon the scroll before him, and it changed the
  current of his thoughts and the expression of his countenance, which again
  grew dark as when I first entered the tent. He muttered over as to himself
  the names of 'Gracchus,' 'Fausta,' 'the very life of their cause,' 'the
  people's chief trust,' and other broken sentences of the same kind. He then
  suddenly recommenced:</p>

  <p>'Piso, I know not that even I have power to grant thy suit. I have saved,
  with some hazard, the life of the Queen and her daughter; in doing it I
  promised to the soldiers, in their place, the best blood of Palmyra, and
  theirs it is by right. It will not be easy to wrest Gracchus from their
  hands. It will bring danger to myself, to the Queen, and to the empire. It
  may breed a fatal revolt. But, Piso, for the noble Portia's sake, the living
  representative of Cneius Piso my early friend, for thine, and chiefly for the
  reason that thou art affianced to the warlike daughter of the princely
  Palmyrene&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Great Prince,' said I&mdash;for it was now my turn to
  speak,&mdash;'pardon me that I break in upon your speech, but I cannot by a
  deception, however slight and unintentional, purchase the life even of a
  friend.'</p>

  <p>'To what does this tend?'</p>

  <p>'It is not I who am affianced to the daughter of Gracchus, but Calpurnius
  Piso my brother and the enemy of Rome. If my hope for Gracchus rests but
  where you have placed it, it must be renounced. Rumor has dealt falsely with
  you.'</p>

  <p>'I am sorry for it. You know me, Piso, well enough to believe me&mdash;I
  am sorry for it. That plea would have availed me more than any. Yet it is
  right that he should die, It is the custom of war. The legions clamor for his
  death&mdash;it has been promised&mdash;it is due to justice and revenge.
  Piso, he must die!'</p>

  <p>I however did not cease to importune. As Aurelian had spoken of Portia, I
  too spoke of her, and refrained not from bringing freshly before his memory
  the characters of both my parents, and especially the services of my father.
  The Emperor was noways displeased, but on the contrary, as I recurred to the
  early periods of his career, when he was a Centurion in Germany, under
  tutelage to the experienced Cneius Piso, he himself took up the story, and
  detained me long with the history of his life and actions, while serving with
  and under my father&mdash;and then afterward when in Gaul, in Africa, and in
  the East. Much curious narrative, the proper source of history, I heard from
  the great actor himself, during this long interview. It was terminated by the
  entrance of Sandarion, upon pressing business with the Emperor, whereupon I
  withdrew, Gracchus not being again named, but leaving his fate in the hands
  of the master of the world, and yet&mdash;how often has it been so with our
  Emperors&mdash;the slave of his own soldiers. I returned to the city.</p>

  <p>The following day I again saw Fausta&mdash;now pale, melancholy and
  silent. I told her of my interview with Aurelian, and of its doubtful issue.
  She listened to me with a painful interest, as if wishing a favorable result,
  yet not daring to hope. When I had ended, she said,</p>

  <p>'You have done all, Lucius, that can be done, yet it avails little or
  nothing. Would that Aurelian had thought women worthy his regard so much as
  to have made me a prisoner too. I can now feel how little one may fear death,
  dying in a certain cause. Palmyra is now dead, and I care no more for life.
  And if Gracchus is to die too, how much rather would I die with him, than
  live without him. And this is not as it may seem, infidelity to Calpurnius. I
  love him better than I ever thought to have loved anything beside Palmyra and
  Gracchus. But my love for these is from my infancy, and is in reason stronger
  than the other. The gods make it so, not I. I love Calpurnius with all that
  is left. When does the army depart?'</p>

  <p>'To-morrow, as I learn. I shall follow it to Emesa, for it is there, so it
  is reported, that the fate of the prisoners will be decided.'</p>

  <p>'Do so, Lucius, and by bribery, cunning, or force, find your way to the
  presence of Gracchus. Be not denied. Tell him&mdash;but no, you know what I
  would say; I cannot&mdash;' and a passionate flood of tears came to her
  relief.</p>

  <p>The preparations of the army are now completed. The city has been drained
  of its wealth and its embellishments. Scarce anything is left but the walls
  and buildings, which are uninjured, the lives and the industry of the
  inhabitants. Sandarion is made Governor of the city and province, with, as it
  seems to me, a very incompetent force to support his authority. Yet the
  citizens are, as they have been since the day the contest was decided,
  perfectly peaceable&mdash;nay, I rather should say, stupid and lethargic.
  There appear to be on the part of Aurelian no apprehensions of future
  disturbance.</p>

  <p>I have stood upon the walls and watched till the last of the Romans has
  disappeared beyond the horizon, Two days have been spent in getting into
  motion and beyond the precincts of the city and suburbs, the army with its
  innumerable wagons&mdash;its long trains of elephants, and camels, and
  horses. Not only Palmyra, but the whole East, seems to have taken its
  departure for the Mediterranean. For the carriages were hardly to be numbered
  which have borne away for the Roman amphitheatres wild animals of every kind,
  collected from every part of Asia, together with innumerable objects of
  curiosity and works of art.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="letter16"
     id="letter16">LETTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I WRITE to you, Curtius, as from my last you were doubtless
led to expect,
  from Emesa, a Syrian town of some consequence, filled now to overflowing with
  the Roman army. Here Aurelian reposes for a while, after the fatigues of the
  march across the desert, and here justice is to be inflicted upon the leaders
  of the late revolt, as by Rome it is termed.</p>

  <p>The prisons are crowded with the great, and noble, and good, of Palmyra.
  All those with whom I have for the last few months mingled so much, whose
  hospitality I have shared, whose taste, accomplishments, and elegant displays
  of wealth I have admired, are now here immured in dungeons, and awaiting that
  death which their virtues, not their vices nor their crimes, have drawn upon
  them. For I suppose it will be agreed, that if ever mankind do that which
  claims the name and rank of virtue, it is when they freely offer up their
  lives for their country, and for a cause which, whatever may be their
  misjudgment in the case, they believe to be the cause of liberty. Man is then
  greater in his disinterestedness, in the spirit with which he renounces
  himself, and offers his neck to the axe of the executioner, than he can be
  clothed in any robe of honor, or sitting upon any throne of power. Which is
  greater in the present instance, Longinus, Gracchus, Otho&mdash;or
  Aurelian&mdash;I cannot doubt for a moment; although I fear that you,
  Curtius, were I to declare my opinion, would hardly agree with me. Strange
  that such a sacrifice as this which is about to be made, can be thought to be
  necessary! It is not necessary; nor can Aurelian himself in his heart deem it
  so. It is a peace-offering to the blood-thirsty legions, who, well do I know
  it&mdash;for I have been of them&mdash;- love no sight so well as the dying
  throes of an enemy. It is, I am told, with an impatience hardly to be
  restrained within the bounds of discipline, that they wait for the moment,
  when their eyes shall be feasted with the flowing blood and headless trunks
  of the brave defenders of Palmyra. I see that this is so, whenever I pass by
  a group of soldiers, or through the camp. Their conversation seems to turn
  upon nothing else than the vengeance due to them upon those who have thinned
  their ranks of one half their numbers, and who, themselves shielded by their
  walls, looked on and beheld in security the slaughter which they made. They
  cry out for the blood of every Palmyrene brought across the desert. My hope
  for Gracchus is small; not more, however, because of this clamor of the
  legions, than on account of the stern and almost cruel nature of Aurelian
  himself. He is himself a soldier. He is one of the legions. His sympathies
  are with them, one of whom he so long has been, and from whom he sprang. The
  gratifications which he remembers himself so often to have sought and so
  dearly to have prized, he is willing to bestow upon those who he knows feel
  as he once did. He may speak of his want of power to resist the will of the
  soldiers; but I almost doubt his sincerity, since nothing can equal the
  terror and reverence with which he is regarded throughout the army; reverence
  for his genius, terror for his passions, which, when excited, rage with the
  fury of a madman, and wreak themselves upon all upon whom the least suspicion
  falls, though among his most trusted friends. To this terror, as you well
  know, his bodily strength greatly adds.</p>

  <p>It was my first office to seek the presence of Gracchus. I found, upon
  inquiry, that both he and Longinus were confined in the same prison, and in
  the charge of the same keeper. I did not believe that I should experience
  difficulty in gaining admission to them, and I found it so.</p>

  <p>Applying to the jailer for admittance to Gracchus the Palmyrene, I was
  told that but few were allowed to see him, and such only whose names had been
  given him. Upon giving him my name, he said that it was one which was upon
  his list, and I might enter. 'Make the most of your time,' he added, 'for
  to-morrow is the day set for the general execution.'</p>

  <p>'So soon?'I said.</p>

  <p>'Aye,' he replied, 'and that is scarce soon enough to keep the soldiers
  quiet. Since they have lost the Queen, they are suspicious lest the others,
  or some of them, may escape too,&mdash;so that they are well guarded, I
  warrant you.'</p>

  <p>'Is the Queen,'I asked, 'under your guard, and within the same
  prison?'</p>

  <p>'The Queen?' he rejoined, and lowering his tone added, 'she is far enough
  from here. If others know it not, I know that she is well on her way to Rome.
  She has let too much Roman blood for her safety within reach of Roman swords,
  I can tell you&mdash;Aurelian notwithstanding. That butchery of the
  Centurions did neither any good.'</p>

  <p>'You say to-morrow is the day appointed for the execution?'</p>

  <p>'So I said. But you will scarce believe it when you see the prisoners.
  They seem rather as if they were for Rome upon a journey of pleasure, than so
  soon for the axe. But walk in. And when you would be let out, make a signal
  by drawing the cord which you will find within the inner ward.'</p>

  <p>I passed in, and meeting another officer of the prison, was by him shown
  the door that led to the cell of Gracchus, and the cord by which I was to
  make the necessary signal.</p>

  <p>I unbarred the door and entered. Gracchus, who was pacing to and fro in
  his apartment, upon seeing who his visiter was, greeted me in his cordial,
  cheerful way. His first inquiry was,</p>

  <p>'Is Fausta well?'</p>

  <p>'I left her well; well as her grief would allow her to be.'</p>

  <p>'My room is narrow, Piso, but it offers two seats. Let us sit. This room
  is not our hall in Palmyra, nor the banqueting room&mdash;this window is too
  small&mdash;nay, it is in some sort but a crevice&mdash;and this ceiling is
  too low&mdash;and these webs of the spider, the prisoner's friend, are not
  our purple hangings&mdash;but it might all be worse. I am free of chains, I
  can walk the length of my room and back again, and there is light enough from
  our chink to see a friend's face by. Yet far as these things are from worst,
  I trust not to be annoyed or comforted by them long. You have done kindly,
  Piso, to seek me out thus remote from Palmyra, and death will be lighter for
  your presence. I am glad to see you.'</p>

  <p>'I could not, as you may easily suppose, remain in Palmyra, and you here
  and thus. For Fausta's sake and my own, I must be here. Although I should not
  speak a word, nor you, there is a happiness in being near and in seeing.'</p>

  <p>'There is. Confinement for a long period of time were robbed of much of
  its horror, if there were near you but a single human countenance, and that a
  stranger's, upon which you might look, especially if you might read there
  pity and affection. Then if this countenance should be that of one known and
  beloved, it would be almost like living in society, even though speech were
  prohibited. Tyrants know this&mdash;these walls are the proof of it. Aurelian
  is not a tyrant in this sense. He is not without magnanimity. Are you here
  with his knowledge?'</p>

  <p>'By his express provision. The jailer had been furnished with my name. You
  are right surely, touching the character of Aurelian. Though rude and
  unlettered, and severe almost to cruelty, there are generous sentiments
  within which shed a softening light, if inconstant, upon the darker traits. I
  would conceal nothing from you, Gracchus; as I would do nothing without your
  approbation. I know your indifference to life. I know that you would not
  purchase a day by any unworthy concession, by any doubtful act or word.
  Relying with some confidence upon the generosity of Aurelian&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Why, Lucius, so hesitating and indirect? You would say that you have
  appealed to Aurelian for my life&mdash;and that hope is not extinct in your
  mind of escape from this appointed death.'</p>

  <p>'That is what I would say. The Emperor inclines to spare your life, but
  wavers. Shall I seek another interview with him? And is there any argument
  which you would that I should urge?&mdash;or&mdash;would you rather that I
  should forbear? It is, Gracchus, because I feared lest I had been doing you a
  displeasing and undesired service, that I have now spoken.'</p>

  <p>'Piso, it is the simple truth when I say that I anticipate the hour and
  the moment of death with the same indifference and composure that I do any,
  the most common event. I have schooled myself to patience. Acquiescence in
  the will of the gods&mdash;if gods there are&mdash;or which is the same
  thing, in the order of events, is the temper which, since I have reflected at
  all, I have cultivated, and to which I can say I have fully attained. I throw
  myself upon the current of life, unresisting, to be wafted withersoever it
  will. I look with desire neither to this shore nor the opposite, to one port
  nor another, but wherever I am borne and permitted to act, I straightway find
  there and in that my happiness. Not that one allotment is not in itself
  preferable to another, but that there being so much of life over which man
  has no control, and cannot, if he would, secure his felicity, I think it
  wiser to renounce all action and endeavor concerning it&mdash;receiving what
  is sent or happens with joy if it be good, without complaint if it be evil.
  In this manner have I secured an inward calm, which has been as a fountain of
  life. My days, whether they have been dark ones or bright, as others term
  them, have flowed along a smooth and even current. Under misfortune, I
  believe I have enjoyed more from this my inward frame, than many a son of
  prosperity has in the very height of his glory. That which so disturbs the
  peace of multitudes&mdash;even of philosophers&mdash;the prospect of death,
  has occasioned me not one moment's disquiet. It is true, I know not what it
  is&mdash;do I know what life is?&mdash;but that is no reason why I should
  fear it. One thing I know, which is this, that it will come, as it comes to
  all, and that I cannot escape it. It may take me where it will, I shall be
  content. If it be but a change, and I live again elsewhere, I shall be glad,
  especially if I am then exempt from evils in my condition which assail me
  here; if it be extinction of being, it will but resemble those nights when I
  sleep without dreaming&mdash;it will not yield any delights, but it will not
  bring affright nor torment. I desire not to entertain, and I do not entertain
  either hope or fear. I am passive. My will is annihilated. The object of my
  life has been to secure the greatest amount of pleasure&mdash;that being the
  best thing of which we can conceive. This I have done by acting right. I have
  found happiness, or that which we agree to call so, in acting in accordance
  with that part of my nature which prescribes the lines of duty: not in any
  set of philosophical opinions; not in expectations in futurity; not in any
  fancies or dreams; but in the substantial reality of virtuous action. I have
  sought to treat both myself and others in such a way, that afterward I should
  not hear from either a single word of reproach. In this way of life I have
  for the most part succeeded, as any one can who will apply his powers as he
  may if he will. I have at this hour, which it may be is the last of my life,
  no complaints to make or hear against myself. So too in regard to others. At
  least I know not that there is one living whom I have wronged, and to whom I
  owe the least reparation. Now therefore by living in the best manner for this
  life on earth, I have prepared myself in the best manner for death, and for
  another life, if there be one. If there be none&mdash;still what I have
  enjoyed I have enjoyed, and it has been more than any other manner of life
  could have afforded. So that in any event, I am like a soldier armed at all
  points. To me, Piso, to die is no more than to go on to live. Both are
  events: to both I am alike indifferent; I know nothing about either. As for
  the pain of death, it is not worthy a moment's thought, even if it were
  considerable&mdash;but it appears to me that it is not. I have many times
  witnessed it, and it has ever seemed that death, so far from being
  represented by any word signifying pain, would be better expressed by one
  that should stand for insensibility. The nearer death the nearer apathy.
  There is pain which often precedes it, in various forms of sickness; but this
  is sickness, not death. Such pains we often endure and recover; worse often
  than apparently are endured by those who die.'</p>

  <p>'I perceive then, Gracchus, that I have given you neither pain nor
  pleasure by any thing I have done.'</p>

  <p>'Not that exactly. It has given me pleasure that you have sought to do me
  a service. For myself, it will weigh but little whether you succeed or fail.
  Your intercession has not displeased me. It cannot affect my good name. For
  Fausta's sake&mdash;'at her name he paused as if for strength&mdash;'and
  because she wishes it, I would rather live than die. Otherwise my mind is
  even- poised, inclining neither way.'</p>

  <p>'But would it not afford you, Gracchus, a sensible pleasure, if, supposing
  you are now to die, you could anticipate with certainty a future existence?
  You are now, you say, in a state of indifference, as to life or death? Above
  all you are delivered from all apprehensions concerning death and futurity.
  This is, it cannot be denied, a great felicity. You are able to sit here calm
  and composed. But it seems to me, if you were possessed of a certain
  expectation of immortality, you would be very much animated and transported,
  as it were, with the prospect of the wonderful scenes so soon to be revealed.
  If, with such a belief, you could turn back your eye upon as faultless and
  virtuous a life as you have passed, you would cast it forward with feelings
  far from those of indifference.'</p>

  <p>'What you assert is very true: doubtless it would be as you say. I can
  conceive that death may be approached not only with composure, but with a
  bursting impatience; just as the youthful traveller pants to leap from the
  vessel that bears him to a foreign land. This would be the case if we were as
  secure of another and happier life as we are certain that we live now. In
  future ages, perhaps through the discoveries of reason, perhaps by
  disclosures from superior beings, it may be so universally, and death come to
  be regarded even with affection, as the great deliverer and rewarder. But at
  present it is very different; I have found no evidence to satisfy me in any
  of the systems of ancient or modern philosophers, from Pythagoras to Seneca,
  and our own Longinus, either of the existence of a God, or of the reality of
  a future life. It seems to me oftentimes in certain frames of mind, but they
  are transient, as if both were true; they feel true, but that is all. I find
  no evidence beyond this inward feeling at all complete and sufficient; and
  this feeling is nothing, it is of the nature of a dream, I cannot rely upon
  it. So that I have, as I still judge, wisely intrenched myself behind
  indifference. I have never indulged in idle lamentations over evils that
  could not be removed, nor do I now. Submission is the law of my life, the sum
  of my philosophy.'</p>

  <p>'The Christians,'I here said, 'seem to possess that which all so much
  desire, a hope, amounting to a certain expectation, of immortality. They all,
  so I am informed, the poor and the humble, as well as the rich and the
  learned, live while they live, as feeling themselves to be only passengers
  here, and when they die, die as those who pass from one stage of a journey to
  another. To them death loses its character of death, and is associated rather
  in their minds with life. It is a beginning rather than an ending; a
  commencement, not a consummation; being born, not dying.'</p>

  <p>'So I have heard; but I have never considered their doctrine. The
  Christian philosophy or doctrine is almost the only one of all, which lay
  claim to such distinction, that I have not studied. I have been repelled from
  that I suppose by seeing it in so great proportion the property of the
  vulgar. What they so rejoiced in, it has appeared to me, could not at the
  same time be what would yield me either pleasure or wisdom. At least in other
  things the vulgar and the refined seek their knowledge and their pleasures
  from very different sources. I cannot conceive of the same philosophy
  approving itself to both classes. Do you learn, Piso, when the time for the
  execution of the prisoners is appointed?'</p>

  <p>'To-morrow, as I heard from the jailer.'</p>

  <p>'To-morrow. It is well. Yet I marvel that the jailer told not me. I am
  somewhat more concerned to know the hour than you, yet to you he has imparted
  what he has withheld from me. He is a partial knave. Have you yet seen
  Longinus?'</p>

  <p>'I have not, but shall visit him in the morning.'</p>

  <p>'Do so. He will receive you with pleasure. Tell me if he continues true in
  his affections for the Queen. His is a great trial, laboring, as at first he
  did, to turn her from the measures that have come to this end; now dying,
  because at last, out of friendship for her rather than anything else, he
  espoused her cause. Yet it is almost the same with me. And for myself, the
  sweetest feeling of this hour is, that I die for Zenobia, and that perhaps my
  death is in part the sacrifice that spares her. Incomparable woman! how the
  hearts of those who have known thee are bound to thee, so that thy very
  errors and faults are esteemed to be virtues!'</p>

  <p>Our conversation here ended, and I turned from the prison, resolved to
  seek the presence of Aurelian. I did so. He received me with urbanity as
  before, but neither confirmed my hopes nor my fears. I returned again to the
  cell of Gracchus, with whom, in various, and to me most instructive
  conversation, we passed the remainder of the day.</p>

  <p>In the morning, with a spirit heavy and sad, burdened indeed with a grief
  such as I never before had experienced, I turned to seek the apartment of
  Longinus. It was not far from that of Gracchus. The keeper of the prison
  readily admitted me, saying, 'that free intercourse was allowed the prisoners
  with all whom it was their desire to see, and that there were several friends
  of Longinus already with him.' With these words he let fall a heavy bar, and
  the door of the cell creaked upon its hinges.</p>

  <p>The room into which I passed seemed a dungeon, rather than any thing else
  or better, for the only light it had, came from a small barred window far
  above the reach. Longinus was seated near a massy central column, to which he
  was bound by a chain; his friends were around him, with whom he appeared to
  have been engaged in earnest conversation, He rose as I approached him, and
  saluted me with the grace that is natural to him, and which is expressive,
  not more of his high breeding, than of an inward benevolence that goes forth
  and embraces all who draw near him.</p>

  <p>'Although,' said he, 'I am forsaken of that which men call fortune, yet I
  am not forgotten by my friends. So that the best things remain. Piso, I
  rejoice truly to see you. These whom you behold are pupils and friends whom
  you have often met at my house, if this dim light will allow you to
  distinguish them.'</p>

  <p>'My eyes are not yet so used to darkness as to see with much distinctness,
  but I recognise well-known faces.'</p>

  <p>After mutual salutations, Longinus said, 'Let me now first inquire
  concerning the daughter of Gracchus, that bright emanation of the Deity. I
  trust in the gods she is well!'</p>

  <p>'I left her,'I replied, 'overwhelmed by sorrow. To lose at once country,
  parent, and friends, is loss too great I fear for her. Death to Gracchus will
  he death also to her.'</p>

  <p>'The temper of Fausta is too sanguine, her heart too warm: she was
  designed for a perpetual prosperity. The misfortunes that overtake her
  friends she makes more than her own. Others' sufferings&mdash;her own she
  could bear&mdash;falling upon her so thickly, will, if they leave her life,
  impart a lasting bitterness to it. It were better perhaps that she died with
  us. Gracchus you have found altogether Gracchus?'</p>

  <p>'I have. He is in the prison as he was in his own palace. His thoughts
  will sometimes wander to his daughter&mdash;oftener than he would&mdash;and
  then in the mirror of the face you behold the inward sorrow of the heart, but
  it is only a momentary ruffling of the surface, and straightway it is calm
  again. Except this only, and he sits upon his hard seat in the same composure
  as if at the head of the Senate.'</p>

  <p>'Gracchus,' said Longinus in reply, 'is naturally great; he is a giant!
  the ills of life, the greater and the lesser, which assail and subdue so
  many, can make nothing of him. He is impenetrable, immovable. Then he has
  aided nature by the precepts of philosophy. What he wanted of insensibility
  to evil, he has added from a doctrine, to which he himself clings
  tenaciously, to which he refers and will refer, as the spring of his highest
  felicity, but from which I&mdash;so variously are we constituted&mdash;shrink
  with unfeigned horror. Doubtless you all know what it is?'</p>

  <p>'We do.'</p>

  <p>'I grant it thus much; that it steels the mind against pain; that it is
  unrivalled in its power to sear and harden the soul; and that if it were
  man's common lot to be exposed to evil, and evil chiefly, it were a
  philosophy to be greatly coveted. But it is benumbing, deadening in its
  influences. It oppresses the soul and overlays it; it delivers it by
  rendering it insensible, not by imparting a new principle of vitality beyond
  the reach of earthly ill. It does the same service that a stupifying draught
  does to him who is about to submit to the knife of the surgeon, or the axe of
  the executioner. But is it not nobler to meet such pains fortified in no
  other way than by a resolute purpose to bear them as well as the nature the
  gods have given you will allow? And suppose you shrink or give signs of
  suffering? that does not impeach the soul. It is rather the gods themselves
  who cry out through you: you did not; it was your corporeal nature, something
  beside your proper self. It is to be no subject of humiliation to us, or of
  grief, that when the prospect of acute suffering is before us; or, still
  more, when called to endure it, we give many tokens of a keen sensibility; so
  it be that at the same time we remain unshaken in our principles, and ready
  to bear what we must.'</p>

  <p>'And what,' asked the young Cleoras, a favorite disciple of the
  philosopher, 'is it in your case that enables you to meet misfortune and
  death without shrinking? If you take not shelter behind indifference, what
  other shield do you find to be sufficient?'</p>

  <p>'I know,' said Longinus, 'that you ask this question not because you have
  never heard from me virtually at least its answer, but because you wish to
  hear from me at this hour, whether I adhere with firmness to the principles I
  have ever inculcated, respecting death, and whether I myself derive from them
  the satisfactions I have declared them capable to impart. It is right and
  well that you do so. And I on my part take pleasure in repeating and
  re-affirming what I have maintained and taught. But I must be brief in what I
  say, more so than I have been in replying to your other inquiries, Cleoras
  and Bassus, for I perceive by the manner in which the rays of the sun shoot
  through the bars of the window, that it is not long before the executioner
  will make his appearance. It affords me then, I say, a very especial
  satisfaction, to declare in the presence of so many worthy friends, my
  continued attachment and hearty devotion to the truths I have believed and
  taught, concerning the existence of a God, and the reality of a future and
  immortal life. Upon these two great points I suffer from no serious doubts,
  and it is from this belief that I now derive the serenity and peace which you
  witness. All the arguments which you have often heard from me in support of
  them, now seem to me to be possessed of a greater strength than ever&mdash;I
  will not repeat them, for they are too familiar to you, but only re-affirm
  them, and pronounce them, as in my judgment, affording a ground for our
  assurance in the department of moral demonstration, as solid and sufficient
  as the reasonings of Euclid afford in the science of geometry. I believe in a
  supreme God and sovereign ruler of the world, by whose wisdom and power all
  things and beings have been created, and are sustained, and in whose presence
  I live and enjoy, as implicitly as I believe the fifth proposition of
  Euclid's first book. I believe in a future life with the like strength. It is
  behind these truths, Cleoras, that I entrench myself at this hour; these make
  the shield which defends me from the assaults of fear and despair, that would
  otherwise, I am sure, overwhelm me.'</p>

  <p>'But how do they defend you, Longinus,' asked Cleoras&mdash;'by simply
  rendering you inaccessible to the shafts which are directed against you, or
  by any other and higher operation upon the soul?'</p>

  <p>'Were it only,' replied the philosopher, 'that truth made me insensible
  and indifferent, I should pray rather to be left to the tutelage of nature. I
  both despise and abhor doctrines that can do no more than this. I desire to
  bless the gods that the philosophy I have received and taught has performed
  for me a far more essential service. This elevates and expands: it renders
  nature as it were superior to itself and its condition: it causes the soul to
  assert its entire supremacy over its companion, the body, and its
  dwelling-place the earth, and in the perfect possession of itself to inhabit
  a better world of its own creation: it infinitely increases all its
  sensibilities, and adds to the constitution received from nature, what may be
  termed new senses, so vividly does it come to apprehend things, which to
  those who are unenlightened by this excellent truth, are as if they had no
  existence, their minds being invested with no faculty or power whereby to
  discern and esteem them. So far from carrying those who embrace it farther
  toward insensibility and indifference, which may truly be called a kind of
  death, it renders them intensely alive, and it is through the transforming
  energies of this new life that the soul is made not insensible to pain, but
  superior to it, and to all the greater ills of existence. It soars above
  them. The knowledge and the belief that fill it furnish it with wings by
  which it is borne far aloft, even at the very time that the body is in the
  deepest affliction. Gracchus meets death with equanimity, and that is
  something. It is better than to be convulsed with vulgar and excessive fear.
  But it is a state of the soul very inferior to what exists in those who truly
  receive the doctrines which I have taught. I, Cleoras, look upon death as a
  release, not from a life which has been wholly evil, for I have, through the
  favor of the gods, enjoyed much, but from the dominion of the body and the
  appetites which clog the soul and greatly hinder it in its efforts after a
  perfect virtue and a true felicity. It will open a way for me into those
  elysian realms in whose reality all men have believed, a very few excepted,
  though few or none could prove it. Even as the great Roman could call that "O
  glorious day," that should admit him to the council of the gods, and the
  society of the great and good who had preceded him, so can I in like manner
  designate the day and hour which are now present. I shall leave you whom I
  have known so long; I shall be separated from scenes familiar and beloved
  through a series of years; the arts and the sciences, which have ministered
  so largely to my happiness, in these forms of them I shall lose; the very
  earth itself, venerable to my mind for the events which have passed upon it,
  and the genius it has nurtured and matured, and beautiful too in its array of
  forms and colors, I shall be conversant with no more. Death will divide me
  from them all: but it will bear me to worlds and scenes of a far exceeding
  beauty: it will introduce me to mansions inconceivably more magnificent than
  anything which the soul has experience of here; above all it will bring me
  into the company of the good of all ages, with whom I shall enjoy the
  pleasures of an uninterrupted intercourse. It will place me where I shall be
  furnished with ample means for the prosecution of all those inquiries which
  have engaged me on earth, exposed to none or fewer of the hindrances which
  have here thronged the way. All knowledge and all happiness will then be
  attainable. Is death to be called an evil, or is it to be feared or
  approached with tears and regrets, when such are to be its issues?'</p>

  <p>'By no means,' said Cleoras; 'it is rather to be desired. If my philosophy
  were as deep and secure as yours, Longinus, I should beg to exchange places
  with you. I should willingly suffer a brief pain to be rewarded so largely.
  But I find within me no such strong assurance.'</p>

  <p>'That,' replied Longinus, 'is for want of reflection. It is only by
  conversing with itself that the soul rises to any height of faith. Argument
  from abroad is of but little service in the comparison. I have often
  discoursed with you concerning these things, and have laid open before you
  the grounds upon which my convictions rest. But I have ever taught that
  consciousness was the true source of belief, and that of this you could
  possess yourselves only through habits of profound attention. What I believe
  I feel. I cannot communicate the strength of my belief to another, because it
  is mysteriously generated within, interweaving itself with all my faculties
  and affections, and abundantly imparting itself to them, but at the same time
  inseparable from them in such a sense that I can offer it as I can a portion
  of my reason or my knowledge, to any whom I might desire to benefit. It is in
  truth in its origin the gift of God, strengthened and exalted infinitely by
  reflection. It is an instinct. Were it otherwise, why could I not give to you
  all I possess myself, and possess because I have by labor acquired it?
  Whereas, though I believe so confidently myself, I find no way in which to
  bestow the same good upon you. But each one will possess it, I am persuaded,
  in the proportion in which he prepares himself by a pure life and habitual
  meditation. It will then reveal itself with new strength every day. So will
  it also be of service to contemplate the characters and lives of those who
  have lived illustriously, both for their virtue and their philosophy. To
  study the character of Plato will be more beneficial in this regard than to
  ponder the arguments of the Phoedo. Those arguments are trivial, fanciful,
  and ingenious, rather than convincing. And the great advantage to be derived
  from the perusal of that treatise is, as it shall be regarded as a sublime
  expression of the confidence with which its author entertained the hope of
  immortality. It is as a part of Plato's biography&mdash;of the history of his
  mind&mdash;that it is valuable. Through meditation, through inward purity,
  through the contemplation of bright examples, will the soul be best prepared
  for the birth of that feeling or conviction that shall set before you with
  the distinctness and certainty of actual vision the prospect of
  immortality.'</p>

  <p>'But are there, Longinus, after all, no waverings of the mind, no
  impertinent doubts, no overcasting shadows, which at all disturb your peace,
  or impair the vividness of your faith? Are you wholly superior to
  fear&mdash;the fear of suffering and death?'</p>

  <p>'That is not, Cleoras, so much to ask whether I still consider my
  philosophy as sufficient, and whether it be so, as whether or not I am still
  a man, and therefore a mixed and imperfect being. But if you desire the
  assurance, I can answer you, and say that I am but a man, and therefore
  notwithstanding my philosophy subject to infirmity and to assaults from the
  body, which undoubtedly occasion me some distress. But these seasons are
  momentary. I can truly affirm, that although there have been and still are
  conflicts, the soul is ever conqueror, and that too by very great odds. My
  doubts and fears are mere flitting shadows; my hope, a strong and unchanging
  beam of light. The body sometimes slips from beyond my control and trembles,
  but the soul is at the very same time secure in herself and undaunted. I
  present the same apparent contradiction that the soldier often does upon the
  field of battle; he trembles and turns pale as he first springs forward to
  encounter the foe, but his arm is strong and his soul determined at the very
  same moment, and no death nor suffering in prospect avails to alarm or turn
  him back. Do not therefore, although I should exhibit signs of fear, imagine
  that my soul is terrified, or that I am forsaken of those steadfast
  principles to which I have given in my allegiance for so long a time.'</p>

  <p>'We will not, Longinus,' said they all.</p>

  <p>Longinus here paused, and seemed for a time buried in meditation. We were
  all silent&mdash;or the silence was broken only by the sobs of those who
  could not restrain their grief.</p>

  <p>'I have spoken to you, my friends,' he at length resumed, 'of the hope of
  immortality, of the strength it yields, and of its descent from God. But
  think not that this hope can exist but in the strictest alliance with virtue.
  The hope of immortality without virtue is a contradiction in terms. The
  perpetuation of vice, or of any vicious affections or desires, can be
  contemplated only with horror. If the soul be without virtue, it is better
  that it should perish. And if deep stained with vice, it is to be feared that
  the very principle of life may be annihilated. As then you would meet the
  final hour, not only with calmness, but with pleasant expectations, cherish
  virtue in your souls; reverence the divinity; do justly by all; obey your
  instincts, which point out the right and the wrong; keep yourselves pure;
  subdue the body. As virtue becomes a habit and a choice, and the soul,
  throughout all its affections and powers, harmonizes with nature and God,
  will the hope of immortality increase in strength till it shall grow to a
  confident expectation. Remember that virtue is the golden key, and the only
  one, that unlocks the gates of the celestial mansions.'</p>

  <p>I here asked Longinus if he was conscious of having been influenced in any
  of his opinions by Christianity. 'I know,'I said, 'that in former
  conversations you have ever objected to that doctrine. Does your judgment
  remain the same?'</p>

  <p>'I have not read the writings of the Christians, yet am I not wholly
  ignorant of them, since it were impossible to know with such familiarity the
  Princess Julia, and not arrive at some just conceptions of what that religion
  is. But I have not received it. Yet even as a piece of polished metal takes a
  thousand hues from surrounding objects, so does the mind; and mine may have
  been unconsciously colored and swayed by the truths of Christianity, which I
  have heard so often stated and defended. Light may have fallen upon it from
  that quarter as well as from others. I doubt not that it has. For although I
  cannot myself admit that doctrine, yet am I now, and have ever been,
  persuaded of its excellence, and that upon such as can admit it, it must
  exert a power altogether beneficial. But let us now, for the little time that
  remains, turn to other things. Piso, know you aught concerning the Queen? I
  have not seen her since the day of her flight, nor have I heard concerning
  her that which I could trust.'</p>

  <p>I then related at length all that I knew.</p>

  <p>'Happy would it have been for her and for all, had my first counsels
  prevailed! Yet am I glad that fortune spares her. May she live to hear of
  Palmyra once more restored to opulence and glory. I was happy in her service.
  I am now happy, if by my death, as by my life, I can avert from her evil that
  otherwise might overtake her. For her, or for the Princess, there is no
  extremity I would not endure, as there have been no services I have not
  rejoiced to perform. The only favor I have asked of Aurelian was, to be
  permitted a last interview with my great pupils; it did not agree with my
  opinions of him, that I was denied so reasonable a request.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps,' said I, 'it is in my power to furnish the reason, having been
  informed, since reaching Emesa, that the Queen, with her attendants and the
  Princesses, had been sent on secretly toward Rome, that they might be placed
  beyond the risk of violence on the part of the legions. He himself was
  doubtful of his power to protect them.'</p>

  <p>'For the sake of both am I glad to hear the explanation,' replied
  Longinus.</p>

  <p>As he uttered these words, the sound of steps was heard as of several
  approaching the door of the room. Then the heavy bar of the door was let
  fall, and the key turned in the wards of the lock. We knew that the last
  moments of Longinus had arrived. Although knowing this so well, yet we still
  were not ready for it, and a horror as of some unlooked-for calamity came
  over us. Cleoras wept without restraint; and threw himself down before
  Longinus, embraced his knees, and as the officers entered and drew near,
  warned them away with threatening language. It was with difficulty that
  Longinus calmed him. He seemed to have lost the possession of his reason.</p>

  <p>The jailer, followed by a guard, now came up to Longinus, and informed him
  that the hour appointed for his execution had arrived.</p>

  <p>Longinus replied, 'that he was ready to go with him, but must first, when
  his chains were taken off, be permitted to address himself to the gods. For,'
  said he, 'we ought to undertake no enterprise of moment, especially ought we
  not to venture into any unknown and untried scenes without first asking their
  guidance, who alone have power to carry us safely through.'</p>

  <p>'This we readily grant,' replied the jailer; who then taking his hammer
  struck off the chain that was bound around the middle of his body.</p>

  <p>Longinus then, without moving from where he sat, bent his head, and
  covering his face with his hands remained a few moments in that posture. The
  apartment was silent as if no one had been in it. Even Cleoras was by that
  sight taught to put a restraint upon the expression of his feelings.</p>

  <p>When these few moments were ended, Longinus raised his head, and with a
  bright and smiling countenance said to the jailer that he was now ready.</p>

  <p>He then went out in company with the guard and soldiers, we following in
  sad procession. The place of execution was in front of the camp, all the
  legions being drawn round to witness it. Aurelian himself was present among
  them.</p>

  <p>Soon as we came in sight of that fatal place, and of the executioner
  standing with his axe lifted upon his shoulder, Longinus suddenly stopped,
  his face became pale and his frame trembled. He turned and looked upon us who
  were immediately behind him, and held up his hands, but without speaking,
  which was as much as to say, 'you perceive that what I said was very likely
  to happen has come to pass, and the body has obtained a momentary triumph.'
  He paused however not long, making then a sign to the soldiers that he was
  ready to proceed. After a short walk from that spot we reached the block and
  the executioner.</p>

  <p>'Friend,' said he now to the executioner, 'I hope your axe is sharp, and
  that you are skilful in your art; and yet it is a pity if you have had so
  much practice as to have become very dexterous in it.'</p>

  <p>'Ten years service in Rome,' he replied, 'may well make one so, or he must
  be born with little wit. Distrust not my arm, for it has never failed yet.
  One blow, and that a light one, is all I want, if it be as it ought, a little
  slanting. As for this edge&mdash;feel it if thou wilt&mdash;it would do for
  thy beard.'</p>

  <p>Longinus had now divested himself of whatever parts of his garments would
  obstruct the executioner in his duty, and was about to place his head in the
  prescribed place, when he first turned to us and again held out his hands,
  which now trembled no longer.</p>

  <p>'You see,' said he, in a cheerful voice, 'that the soul is again supreme.
  Love and cultivate the soul, my good friends, and you will then be universal
  conquerors, and throughout all ages. It will never betray you. Now, my new
  friend, open for me the gates of immortality, for you are in truth a
  celestial porter.' So saying, he placed himself as he was directed to do, and
  at a single blow, as he had been promised, the head of Longinus was severed
  from his body.</p>

  <p>Neither the head nor the body was delivered to the soldiers, nor allowed
  to be treated with disrespect. This favor we had obtained of Aurelian. So
  after the executioner had held up the head of the philosopher, and shown it
  to the soldiers, it was together with the body given to our care, and by us
  sent to Palmyra.</p>

  <p>On this same day perished Otho, Seleucus, Gabrayas, Nicanor&mdash;all, in
  a word, of the Queen's council, and almost all of the senate. Some were
  reserved for execution at another time, and among these I found, as I went
  sadly toward the cell of Gracchus, was the father of Fausta.</p>

  <p>The keeper of the prison admitted me with a more cheerful air than before,
  and with a significant shake of the head. I heeded him but little, pressing
  on to meet Gracchus.</p>

  <p>'So,'I exclaimed, 'it is not to-day'&mdash;</p>

  <p>'No,' rejoined Gracchus, visibly moved, 'nor to-morrow, Piso. Read here.'
  And placing a parchment in my hand, turned away.</p>

  <p>It contained a full and free remission of punishment, and permission to
  return immediately to Palmyra.</p>

  <p>'The gods be praised! the gods be praised!'I cried as I embraced him, 'Is
  not this better, Gracchus?'</p>

  <p>'It is,' said he, with emphasis. 'It is a great boon. I do not deny it.
  For Fausta's sake I rejoice&mdash;as for myself, all is strictly true which I
  have said to you. But I forget all now, save Fausta and her joy and renewed
  life. Would, O would, that Longinus could have returned to Palmyra with
  me!'&mdash;and then, for the first time, Gracchus gave way to grief, and wept
  aloud.</p>

  <p>In the morning we set out for Palmyra. Farewell.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="letter17"
     id="letter17">LETTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I WRITE again from Palmyra.</p>

  <p>We arrived here after a day's hard travel. The sensation occasioned by the
  unexpected return of Gracchus seemed to cause a temporary forgetfulness of
  their calamities on the part of the citizens. As we entered the city at the
  close of the day, and they recognised their venerated friend, there were no
  hounds to the tumultuous expressions of their joy. The whole city was abroad.
  It were hard to say whether Fausta herself was more pained by excess of
  pleasure, than was each citizen who thronged the streets as we made our
  triumphal entry.</p>

  <p>A general amnesty of the past having been proclaimed by Sandarion
  immediately after the departure of Aurelian with the prisoners whom he chose
  to select, we found Calpurnius already returned. At Fausta's side he received
  us as we dismounted in the palace-yard. I need not tell you how we passed our
  first evening. Yet it was one of very mixed enjoyment. Fausta's eye, as it
  dwelt upon the beloved form of her father, seemed to express unalloyed
  happiness. But then again, as it was withdrawn at those moments when, his
  voice kept not her attention fixed upon himself, she fell back upon the past
  and the lost, and the shadows of a deep sadness would gather over her. So in
  truth was it with us all&mdash;especially, when at the urgency of the rest, I
  related to them the interviews I had had with Longinus, and described to them
  his behavior in the prison and at the execution.</p>

  <p>'I think,' said Fausta, 'that Aurelian, in the death of Longinus, has
  injured his fame far more than by the capture of Zenobia and the reduction of
  Palmyra he has added to it. Posterity will not readily forgive him for
  putting out, in its meridian blaze, the very brightest light of the age. It
  surely was an unnecessary act.'</p>

  <p>'The destruction of prisoners, especially those of rank and influence,
  is,' said I, 'according to the savage usages of war&mdash;and Aurelian
  defends the death of Longinus by saying, that in becoming the first adviser
  of Zenobia, he was no longer Longinus the philosopher, but Longinus the
  minister and rebel.'</p>

  <p>'That will be held,' she replied, 'as a poor piece of sophistry. He was
  still Longinus. And in killing Longinus the minister, he basely slew Longinus
  the renowned philosopher, the accomplished scholar, the man of letters and of
  taste; the great man of the age; for you will not say that either in Rome or
  Greece there now lives his equal.'</p>

  <p>'Fausta,' said Gracchus, 'you are right. And had Aurelian been any more or
  higher than a soldier, he would not have dared to encounter the odium of the
  act; but in simple truth he was, I suppose, and is utterly insensible to the
  crime he has committed, not against an individual or Palmyra, but against the
  civilized world and posterity; a crime that will grow in its magnitude as
  time rolls on, and will forever and to the remotest times blast the fame and
  the name of him who did it. Longinus belonged to all times and people, and by
  them will be avenged. Aurelian could not understand the greatness of his
  victim, and was ignorant that he was drawing upon himself a reproach greater
  than if he had sacrificed in his fury the Queen herself, and half the
  inhabitants of Palmyra. He will find it out when he reaches Rome. He will
  find himself as notorious there, as the murderer of Longinus, as he will be
  as conqueror of the East.'</p>

  <p>'There was one sentiment of Aurelian,'I said, 'which he expressed to me
  when I urged upon him the sparing of Longinus, to which you must allow some
  greatness to attach. I had said to him that it was greater to pardon than to
  punish, and that for that reason&mdash;"Ah," he replied, interrupting me, "I
  may not gain to myself the fame of magnanimity at the expense of Rome. As the
  chief enemy of Rome in this rebellion, Rome requires his punishment, and Rome
  is the party to be satisfied, not I."'</p>

  <p>'I grant that there is greatness in the sentiment. If he was sincere, all
  we can say is this&mdash;that he misjudged in supposing Rome to need the
  sacrifice. She needed it not. There were enough heads like mine, of less
  worth, that would do for the soldiers&mdash;for they are Rome in Aurelian's
  vocabulary.'</p>

  <p>'Men of humanity and of letters,'I replied, 'will, I suppose, decide upon
  this question one way, politicians and soldiers another.'</p>

  <p>'That, I believe,' rejoined Gracchus, 'is nearly the truth.'</p>

  <p>When wearied by a prolonged conversation, we sought the repose of our
  pillows; each one of us happier by a large and overflowing measure than but
  two days before we had ever thought to be again.</p>

  <p>The city is to all appearance tranquil and acquiescent under its bitter
  chastisement. The outward aspect is calm and peaceful. The gates are thrown
  open, and the merchants and traders are returning to the pursuits of traffic;
  the gentry and nobles are engaged in refitting and re-embellishing their
  rifled palaces; and the common people have returned in quiet to the several
  channels of their industry.</p>

  <p>I have made however some observations, which lead me to believe that all
  is not so settled and secure as it seems to be, and that however the greater
  proportion of the citizens are content to sit down patiently under the rule
  of their new masters, others are not of their mind. I can perceive that
  Antiochus, who under the general pardon proclaimed by Sandarion has returned
  to the city, is the central point of a good deal of interest among a certain
  class of citizens. He is again at the head of the same licentious and
  desperate crew as before; a set of men, like himself, large in their
  resources, lawless in their lives, and daring in the pursuit of whatever
  object they set before them. To one who knows the men, their habits and
  manners, it is not difficult to see that they are engaged in other plans than
  appear upon the surface. Yet are their movements so quietly ordered as to
  occasion no general observation or remark. Sandarion, ignorant whence danger
  might be expected to arise, appears not to indulge suspicions of one nor
  another. Indeed, from the smallness of the garrison, from the whole manner
  both of the governor and those who are under him, soldiers and others, it is
  evident that no thought of a rising on the part of the populace has entered
  their minds.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A few days have passed, and Gracchus and Fausta, who
inclined not to give
  much heed to my observations, both think with me&mdash;indeed, to Gracchus
  communication has been made of the existence of a plot to rescue the city
  from the hands of the Romans, in which he has been solicited to join.</p>

  <p>Antiochus himself has sought and obtained an interview with Gracchus.</p>

  <p>Gracchus has not hesitated to reject all overtures from that quarter. We
  thus learn that the most desperate measures are in agitation&mdash;weak and
  preposterous too as they are desperate, and must in the end prove ruinous.
  Antiochus, we doubt not, is a tool in the hands of others, but he stands out
  as the head and centre of the conspiracy. There is a violent and a strong
  party, consisting chiefly of the disbanded soldiers, but of some drawn from
  every class of the inhabitants, whose object is by a sudden attack to snatch
  the city from the Roman garrison; and placing Antiochus on the throne,
  proclaim their independence again, and prepare themselves to maintain and
  defend it. They make use of Antiochus because of his connection with Zenobia,
  and the influence he would exert through that prejudice, and because of his
  sway over other families among the richest and most powerful, especially the
  two princes, Herennianus and Timolaus&mdash;and because of his
  fool-hardiness. If they should fail, he, they imagine, will be the only or
  the chief sacrifice&mdash;and he can well be spared. If they succeed, it will
  be an easy matter afterward to dispose of him, if his character or measures
  as their king should displease them, and exalt some other and worthier in his
  room.</p>

  <p>'And what, father,' said Fausta, 'said you to Antiochus?'</p>

  <p>'I told him,' replied Gracchus, 'what I thought, that the plan struck me
  not only as frantic and wild, but foolish&mdash;that I for myself should
  engage in no plot of any kind, having in view any similar object, much less
  in such a one as he proposed. I told him that if Palmyra was destined ever to
  assert its supremacy and independence of Rome, it could not be for many years
  to come, and then by watching for some favorable juncture in the affairs of
  Rome in other parts of the world. It might very well happen, I thought, that
  in the process of years, and when Palmyra had wholly recruited her strength
  after her late and extreme sufferings&mdash;that there might occur some
  period of revolution or inward commotion in the Roman empire, such as would
  leave her remote provinces in a comparatively unprotected state. Then would
  be the time for re-asserting our independence; then we might spring upon our
  keepers with some good prospect of overpowering them, and taking again to
  ourselves our own government. But now, I tried to convince him, it was utter
  madness, or worse, stupidity, to dream of success in such an enterprise. The
  Romans were already inflamed and angry; not half appeased by the bloody
  offering that had just been made; their strength was undiminished&mdash;for
  what could diminish the strength of Rome?&mdash;and a rising could no sooner
  take place, than her legions would again be upon us, and our sufferings might
  be greater than ever. I entreated him to pause, and to dissuade those from
  action who were connected with him. I did not hesitate to set before him a
  lively picture of his own hazard in the affair; that he, if failure ensued,
  would be the first victim. I urged moreover, that a few, as I held his number
  to be, had no right to endanger, by any selfish and besotted conduct, the
  general welfare, the lives and property of the citizens; that not till he
  felt he had the voice of the people with him ought he to dare to act; and
  that although I should not betray his councils to Sandarion, I should to the
  people, unless I received from him ample assurance that no movement should be
  made without a full disclosure of the project to all the principal citizens,
  as representatives of the whole city.'</p>

  <p>'And how took he all that?' we asked.</p>

  <p>'He was evidently troubled at the vision I raised of his' own head borne
  aloft upon a Roman pike, and not a little disconcerted at what I labored to
  convince him were the rights of us all in the case. I obtained from him in
  the end a solemn promise that he would communicate what I had said to his
  companions, and that they would forbear all action till they had first
  obtained the concurrence of the greater part of the city. I assured him
  however, that in no case and under no conceivable circumstances could he or
  others calculate upon any co-operation of mine. Upon any knowledge which I
  might obtain of intended action, I should withdraw from the city.'</p>

  <p>'It is a sad fate,' said Fausta, 'that having just escaped with our lives
  and the bare walls of our city and dwellings from the Romans, we are now to
  become the prey of a wicked faction among ourselves. But, can you trust the
  word of Antiochus that he will give you timely notice if they go on to
  prosecute the affair? Will they not now work in secret all the more, and veil
  themselves even from the scrutiny of citizens?'</p>

  <p>'I hardly think they can escape the watchful eyes that will be fixed upon
  them,' replied Gracchus; 'nor do I believe that however inclined Antiochus
  might be to deceive me, those who are of his party would agree to such
  baseness. There are honorable men, however deluded, in his company.'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Several days have passed, and our fears are almost laid.
Antiochus and the
  princes have been seen as usual frequenting the more public streets, lounging
  in the Portico, or at the places of amusement. And the evenings have been
  devoted to gayety and pleasure&mdash;Sandarion himself, and the officers of
  his legion, being frequent visiters at the palace of Antiochus, and at that
  of the Caesars, lately the palace of Zenobia.</p>

  <p>During this interval we have celebrated with all becoming rites the
  marriage of Fausta and Calpurnius, hastened at the urgency of Gracchus, who
  feeling still very insecure of life, and doubtful of the continued
  tranquillity of the city, wished to bestow upon Calpurnius the rights of a
  husband, and to secure to Fausta the protection of one. Gracchus seems
  happier and lighter of heart since this has been done&mdash;so do we all. It
  was an occasion of joy, but as much of tears also. An event which we had
  hoped to have been graced by the presence of Zenobia, Julia, and Longinus,
  took place almost in solitude and silence. But of this I have written fully
  to Portia.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">That which we have apprehended has happened. The How has
been struck, and
  Palmyra is again, in name at least, free and independent.</p>

  <p>Early on the morning after the marriage of Fausta, we were alarmed by the
  sounds of strife and commotion in the streets&mdash;by the cries of those who
  pursued, and of those who fled and fought. It was as yet hardly light. But it
  was not difficult to know the cause of the uproar, or the parties engaged. We
  seized our arms, and prepared ourselves for defence, against whatever party,
  Roman or Palmyrene, should make an assault. The preparation was however
  needless, for the contest was already decided. The whole garrison, with the
  brave Sandarion at their head, has been massacred, and the power of Palmyra
  is in the hands of Antiochus and his adherents. There has been in truth no
  fighting, it has been the murder rather of unprepared and defenceless men.
  The garrison was cut off in detail while upon their watch by overwhelming
  numbers. Sandarion was despatched in his quarters, and in his bed, by the
  very inhuman wretches at whose tables he had just been feasted, from whom he
  had but a few hours before parted, giving and receiving the signs of
  friendship. The cowardly Antiochus it was who stabbed him as he sprang from
  his sleep, encumbered and disabled by his night-clothes. Not a Roman has
  escaped with his life.</p>

  <p>Antiochus is proclaimed king, and the streets of the city have resounded
  with the shouts of this deluded people, crying, 'long live Antiochus!' He has
  been borne in tumult to the great portico of the temple of the Sun, where,
  with the ceremonies prescribed for the occasion, he has been crowned king of
  Palmyra and of the East.</p>

  <p>While these things were in progress&mdash;the now king entering upon his
  authority, and the government forming itself&mdash;Gracchus chose and acted
  his part.</p>

  <p>'There is little safety,' he said, 'for me now, I fear, anywhere&mdash;but
  least of all here. But were I secure of life, Palmyra is now to be a
  desecrated and polluted place, and I would fain depart from it. I could not
  remain in it, though covered with honor, to see Antiochus in the seat of
  Zenobia, and Critias in the chair of Longinus. I must go, as I respect myself
  and as I desire life. Antiochus will bear me no good will, and no sooner will
  he have become easy in his seat and secure of his power, than he will begin
  the work for which his nature alone fits him, of cold-blooded revenge,
  cruelty, and lust. I trust indeed that his reign will end before that day
  shall arrive&mdash;but it may not&mdash;and it will be best for me and for
  you, my children, to remove from his sight. If he sees us not, he may forget
  us.'</p>

  <p>We all gladly assented to the plan which he then proposed. It was to
  withdraw privately as possible to one of his estates in the neighborhood of
  the city, and there await the unfolding of the scenes that remained yet to be
  enacted. The plan was at once carried into effect. The estate to which we
  retreated was about four Roman miles from the walls, situated upon an
  eminence, and overlooking the city and the surrounding plains. Soon as the
  shadows of the evening of the first day of the reign of Antiochus had fallen,
  we departed from Palmyra, and within an hour found ourselves upon a spot as
  wild and secluded as if it had been within the bosom of a wilderness. The
  building consists of a square tower of stone, large and lofty, built
  originally for purposes of war and defence, but now long occupied by those
  who have pursued the peaceful labors of husbandry. The wildness of the
  region, the solitariness of the place, the dark and frowning aspect of the
  impregnable tower, had pleased the fancy of both Gracchus and Fausta, and it
  has been used by them as an occasional retreat at those times when, wearied
  of the sound and sight of life, they have needed perfect repose. A few slaves
  are all that are required to constitute a sufficient household.</p>

  <p>Here, Curtius, notwithstanding the troubled aspect of the times, have we
  passed a few days of no moderate enjoyment. Had there been no other, it would
  have been enough to sit and witness the happiness of Calpurnius and Fausta.
  But there have been and are other sources of satisfaction as you will not
  doubt. We have now leisure to converse at such length as we please upon a
  thousand subjects which interest us. Seated upon the rocks at nightfall, or
  upon the lofty battlements of the tower, or at hot noon reclining beneath the
  shade of the terebinth or palm, we have tasted once again the calm delights
  we experienced at the Queen's mountain palace. In this manner have we heard
  from Calpurnius accounts every way instructive and entertaining of his life
  while in Persia; of the character and acts of Sapor; of the condition of that
  empire, and its wide-spread population. Nothing seems to have escaped his
  notice and investigation. At these times and places too do I amuse and
  enlighten the circle around me by reading such portions of your letters and
  of Portia's as relate to matters generally interesting&mdash;and thus too do
  we discuss the times, and speculate upon the events with which the future
  labors in relation to Palmyra.</p>

  <p>In the mean time we learn that the city is given up to festivity and
  excess. Antiochus himself possessing immense riches, is devoting these, and
  whatever the treasury of the kingdom places within his reach, to the
  entertainment of the people with shows and games after the Roman fashion, and
  seems really to have deluded the mass of the people so far as to have
  convinced them that their ancient prosperity has returned, and that he is the
  father of their country, a second Odenatus. He has succeeded in giving to his
  betrayal of the Queen the character and merit of a patriotic act, at least
  with the creatures who uphold him&mdash;and there are no praises so false and
  gross that they are not heaped upon him, and imposed upon the people in
  proclamations, and edicts. The ignorant&mdash;and where is it that they are
  not the greater part&mdash;stand by, wonder and believe. They cannot
  penetrate the wickedness of the game that has been played before them, and by
  the arts of the king and his minions have already been converted into friends
  and supporters.</p>

  <p>The defence of the city is not, we understand, wholly neglected; but
  having before their eyes some fear of retribution, troops are again levied
  and organized, and the walls beginning to be put into a state of preparation.
  But this is all of secondary interest, and is postponed to any object of more
  immediate and sensual gratification.</p>

  <p>But there are large numbers of the late Queen's truest friends, who with
  Gracchus look on in grief and terror even, at the order of things that has
  arisen, and prophesying with him a speedy end to it, either from interior and
  domestic revolution, or a return of the Roman armies, accompanied in either
  case of course by a wide-spread destruction, have with him also secretly
  withdrawn from the city, and fled either to some neighboring territory, or
  retreated to the fastnesses of the rural districts. Gracchus has not ceased
  to warn all whom he knows and chiefly esteems of the dangers to be
  apprehended, and urge upon them the duty of a timely escape.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Messengers have arrived from Antiochus to Gracchus, with
whom they have
  held long and earnest conference, the object of which has been to induce him
  to return to the city, and resume his place at the head of the Senate, the
  king well knowing that no act of his would so much strengthen his power as to
  be able to number Gracchus among his friends. But Gracchus has not so much as
  wavered in his purpose to keep aloof from Antiochus and all concern with his
  affairs. His contempt and abhorrence of the king would not however, he says,
  prevent his serving his country, were he not persuaded that in so short a
  time violence of some sort from without or within would prostrate king and
  government in the dust.</p>

  <p>It was only a few days after the messengers from Antiochus had paid their
  visit to Gracchus, that as we were seated upon a shaded rock, not far from
  the tower, listening to Fausta as she read to us, we were alarmed by the
  sudden irruption of Milo upon our seclusion, breathless, except that he could
  just exclaim, 'The Romans! The Romans!' As he could command his speech, he
  said, 'that the Roman army could plainly be discerned from the higher points
  of the land, rapidly approaching the city, of which we might satisfy
  ourselves by ascending the tower.'</p>

  <p>'Gods! can it be possible,' exclaimed Gracchus, 'that Aurelian can himself
  have returned? He must have been well on his way to the Hellespont ere the
  conspiracy broke out.'</p>

  <p>'I can easily believe it,'I replied, as we hastened toward the old tower,
  'from what I have known and witnessed of the promptness and miraculous
  celerity of his movements.'</p>

  <p>As we came out upon the battlements of the tower, not a doubt remained
  that it was indeed the Romans pouring in again like a flood upon the plains
  of the now devoted city. Far as the eye could reach to the west, clouds of
  dust indicated the line of the Roman march, while the van was already within
  a mile of the very gates. The roads leading to the capital, in every
  direction, seemed covered with those who, at the last moment, ere the gates
  were shut, had rushed forth and were flying to escape the impending
  desolation. All bore the appearance of a city taken by surprise and utterly
  unprepared; as we doubted not was the case from what we had observed of its
  actual state, and from the suddenness of Aurelian's return and approach.</p>

  <p>'Now,' said Fausta, 'I can believe that the last days of Palmyra have
  arrived. It is impossible that Antiochus can sustain the siege against what
  will now be the tenfold fury of Aurelian and his enraged soldiers.'</p>

  <p>A very few days will suffice for its reduction, if long before it be not
  again betrayed into the power of the assailants.</p>

  <p>We have watched with intense curiosity and anxiety the scene that has been
  performing before our eyes. We are not so remote but that we can see with
  considerable distinctness whatever takes place, sometimes advancing and
  choosing our point of observation upon some nearer eminence.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">After one day of preparation and one of assault the city
has fallen, and
  Aurelian again entered in triumph; this time in the spirit of revenge and
  retaliation. It is evident, as we look on horror-struck, that no quarter is
  given, but that a general massacre has been ordered, both of soldier and
  citizen. We can behold whole herds of the defenceless populace escaping from
  the gates or over the walls, only to be pursued&mdash;hunted&mdash; and
  slaughtered by the remorseless soldiers. And thousands upon thousands have we
  seen driven over the walls, or hurled from the battlements of the lofty
  towers to perish, dashed upon the rocks below. Fausta cannot endure these
  sights of horror, but retires and hides herself in her apartments.</p>

  <p>No sooner had the evening of this fatal day set in, than a new scene of
  terrific sublimity opened before us as we beheld flames beginning to ascend
  from every part of the city. They grew and spread till they presently
  appeared to wrap all objects alike in one vast sheet of fire. Towers,
  pinnacles and domes, after glittering awhile in the fierce blaze, one after
  another fell and disappeared in the general ruin. The Temple of the Sun stood
  long untouched, shining almost with the brightness of the sun itself, its
  polished shafts and sides reflecting the surrounding fire with an intense
  brilliancy. We hoped that it might escape, and were certain that it would,
  unless fired from within&mdash;as from its insulated position the flames from
  the neighboring buildings could not reach it. But we watched not long ere
  from its western extremity the fire broke forth, and warned us that that
  peerless monument of human genius, like all else, would soon crumble to the
  ground. To our amazement however and joy, the flames, after having made great
  progress, were suddenly arrested, and by some cause extinguished; and the
  vast pile stood towering in the centre of the desolation, of double size as
  it seemed, from the fall and disappearance of so many of the surrounding
  structures.</p>

  <p>'This,' said Fausta, 'is the act of a rash and passionate man. Aurelian,
  before to-morrow's sun is set, will himself repent it. What a single night
  has destroyed, a century could not restore. This blighted and ruined capital,
  as long as its crumbling remains shall attract the gaze of the traveller,
  will utter a blasting malediction upon the name and memory of Aurelian.
  Hereafter he will be known, not as conqueror of the East and the restorer of
  the Roman Empire, but as the executioner of Longinus and the ruthless
  destroyer of Palmyra.'</p>

  <p>'I fear that you prophesy with too much truth,'I replied. 'Rage and
  revenge have ruled the hour, and have committed horrors which no reason and
  no policy either of the present or of any age, will justify.'</p>

  <p>'It is a result ever to be expected,' said Gracchus, 'so long as mankind
  will prefer an ignorant, unlettered soldier as their ruler. They can look for
  nothing different from one whose ideas have been formed by the camp
  alone&mdash;whose vulgar mind has never been illuminated by study and the
  knowledge of antiquity. Such a one feels no reverence for the arts, for
  learning, for philosophy, nor for man as man&mdash;he knows not what these
  mean&mdash;power is all he can comprehend, and all he worships. As long as
  the army furnishes Rome with her emperors, so long may she know that her name
  will, by acts like these, be handed down to posterity covered with the infamy
  that belongs to the polished savage&mdash;the civilized barbarian. Come,
  Fausta, let us now in and hide ourselves from this sight&mdash;too sad and
  sorrowful to gaze upon.'</p>

  <p>'I can look now, father, without emotion,' she replied; 'a little sorrow
  opens all the fountains of grief&mdash;too much seals them. I have wept till
  I can weep no more. My sensibility is, I believe, by this succession of
  calamities dulled till it is dead.'</p>

  <p>Aurelian, we learn, long before the fire had completed its work of
  destruction, recalled the orders he had given, and labored to arrest the
  progress of the flames. In this he to a considerable extent succeeded, and it
  was owing to this that the great temple was saved, and others among the most
  costly and beautiful structures.</p>

  <p>On the third day after the capture of the city and the massacre of the
  inhabitants, the army of the 'conqueror and destroyer' withdrew from the
  scene of its glory, and again disappeared beyond the desert. I sought not the
  presence of Aurelian while before the city, for I cared not to meet him
  drenched in the blood of women and children. But as soon as he and his
  legions were departed, we turned toward the city, as children to visit the
  dead body of a parent.</p>

  <p>No language which I can use, my Curtius, can give you any just conception
  of the horrors which met our view on the way to the walls and in the city
  itself. For more than a mile before we reached the gates, the roads, and the
  fields on either hand, were strewed with the bodies of those who, in their
  attempts to escape, had been overtaken by the enemy and slain. Many a group
  of bodies did we notice, evidently those of a family, the parents and the
  children, who, hoping to reach in company some place of security, had
  all&mdash;and without resistance apparently&mdash;fallen a sacrifice to the
  relentless fury of their pursuers. Immediately in the vicinity of the walls
  and under them the earth was concealed from the eye by the multitudes of the
  slain, and all objects were stained with the one hue of blood. Upon passing
  the gates and entering within those walls which I had been accustomed to
  regard as embracing in their wide and graceful sweep the most beautiful city
  of the world, my eye met naught but black and smoking ruins, fallen houses
  and temples, the streets choked with piles of still blazing timbers and the
  half- burned bodies of the dead. As I penetrated farther into the heart of
  the city, and to its better built and more spacious quarters, I found the
  destruction to be less&mdash;that the principal streets were standing, and
  many of the more distinguished structures. But every where&mdash;in the
  streets&mdash;upon the porticos of private and public dwellings&mdash;upon
  the steps and within the very walls of the temples of every faith&mdash;in
  all places, the most sacred as well as the most common, lay the mangled
  carcasses of the wretched inhabitants. None apparently had been spared. The
  aged were there, with their silvered heads&mdash;little children and
  infants&mdash;women, the young, the beautiful, the good&mdash;all were there,
  slaughtered in every imaginable way, and presenting to the eye spectacles of
  horror and of grief enough to break the heart and craze the brain. For one
  could not but go back to the day and the hour when they died, and suffer with
  these innocent thousands a part of what they suffered, when the gates of the
  city giving way, the infuriated soldiery poured in, and with death written in
  their faces and clamoring on their tongues, their quiet houses were invaded,
  and resisting or unresisting, they all fell together beneath the murderous
  knives of the savage foe. What shrieks then rent and filled the
  air&mdash;what prayers of agony went up to the gods for life to those whose
  ears on mercy's side were adders'&mdash;what piercing supplications that life
  might be taken and honor spared! The apartments of the rich and the noble
  presented the most harrowing spectacles, where the inmates, delicately
  nurtured, and knowing of danger, evil and wrong only by name and report, had
  first endured all that nature most abhors, and then, there where their souls
  had died, were slain by their brutal violators with every circumstance of
  most demoniac cruelty. Happy for those who, like Gracchus, foresaw the
  tempest and fled. These calamities have fallen chiefly upon the adherents of
  Antiochus: but among them, alas! were some of the noblest and most honored
  families of the capital. Their bodies now lie blackened and bloated upon
  their door-stones&mdash;their own halls have become their tombs.</p>

  <p>We sought together the house of Gracchus. We found it partly consumed,
  partly standing and uninjured. The offices and one of the rear wings were
  burned and level with the ground, but there the flames had been arrested, and
  the remainder, comprising all the principal apartments, stands as it stood
  before. The palace of Zenobia has escaped without harm&mdash;its lofty walls
  and insulated position were its protection. The Long Portico, with its
  columns, monuments, and inscriptions, remains also untouched by the flames
  and unprofaned by any violence from the wanton soldiery. The fire has fed
  upon the poorer quarters of the city, where the buildings were composed in
  greater proportion of wood, and spared most of the great thorough-fares,
  principal avenues, and squares of the capital, which, being constructed in
  the most solid manner of stone, resisted effectually all progress of the
  flames, and though frequently set on fire for the purpose of their
  destruction, the fire perished from a want of material, or it consumed but
  the single edifice where it was kindled.</p>

  <p>The silence of death and of ruin rests over this once and but so lately
  populous city. As I stood upon a high point which overlooked a large extent
  of it, I could discern no signs of life, except here and there a detachment
  of the Roman guard dragging forth the bodies of the slaughtered citizens, and
  bearing them to be burned or buried. This whole people is extinct. In a
  single day these hundred thousands have found a common grave. Not one remains
  to bewail or bury the dead. Where are the anxious crowds, who when their
  dwellings have been burned, eagerly rush in as the flames have spent
  themselves to sorrow over their smoking altars, and pry with busy search
  among the hot ashes, if perchance they may yet rescue some lamented treasure,
  or bear away at least the bones of a parent or a child, buried beneath the
  ruins? They are not here. It is broad day, and the sun shines bright, but not
  a living form is seen lingering about these desolated streets and squares.
  Birds of prey are already hovering round, and alighting without apprehension
  of disturbance wherever the banquet invites them; and soon as the shadows of
  evening shall fall, the hyena of the desert will be here to gorge himself
  upon what they have left, having scented afar off upon the tainted breeze the
  fumes of the rich feast here spread for him. These Roman grave-diggers from
  the legion of Bassus, are alone upon the ground to contend with them for
  their prize. O, miserable condition of humanity! Why is it that to man have
  been given passions which he cannot tame, and which sink him below the brute!
  Why is it that a few ambitious are permitted by the Great Ruler, in the
  selfish pursuit of their own aggrandizement, to scatter in ruin, desolation,
  and death, whole kingdoms&mdash;making misery and destruction the steps by
  which they mount up to their seats of pride! O, gentle doctrine of Christ!
  doctrine of love and of peace, when shall it be that I and all mankind shall
  know thy truth, and the world smile with a new happiness under thy
  life-giving reign!</p>

  <p>Fausta, as she has wandered with us through this wilderness of woe, has
  uttered scarce a word. This appalling and afflicting sight of her beloved
  Palmyra&mdash;her pride and hope&mdash;in whose glory her very life was wrapt
  up&mdash;so soon become a blackened heap of ruins&mdash;its power
  departed&mdash;its busy multitudes dead, and their dwellings empty or
  consumed&mdash;has deprived her of all but tears. She has only wept. The
  sensibility which she feared was dead she finds endued with life
  enough&mdash;with too much for either her peace or safety.</p>

  <p>As soon as it became known in the neighboring districts that the army of
  Aurelian was withdrawn, and that the troops left in the camp and upon the
  walls were no longer commissioned to destroy, they who had succeeded in
  effecting their escape, or who had early retreated from the scene of danger,
  began to venture back. These were accompanied by great numbers of the country
  people, who now poured in either to witness with their own eyes the great
  horror of the times, or to seek for the bodies of children or friends, who,
  dwelling in the city for purposes of trade or labor or as soldiers, had
  fallen in the common ruin. For many days might the streets, and walls, and
  ruins be seen covered with crowds of men and women, who weeping sought among
  the piles of the yet unburied and decaying dead, dear relatives, or friends,
  or lovers, for whom they hoped to perform the last offices of unfailing
  affection; a hope that was, perhaps, in scarce a single instance fulfilled.
  And how could any but those in whom love had swallowed up reason once imagine
  that where the dead were heaped fathoms deep, mangled by every shocking mode
  of death, and now defaced yet more by the processes of corruption, they could
  identify the forms which they last saw beautiful in all the bloom of health?
  But love is love; it feels and cannot reason.</p>

  <p>Cerronius Bassus, the lieutenant of Aurelian, has with a humane violence
  laid hold upon this curious and gazing multitude, and changed them all into
  buriers of the dead they came to seek and bewail. To save the country,
  himself and his soldiers from pestilence, he hastens the necessary work of
  interment. The plains are trenched, and into them the bodies of the citizens
  are indiscriminately thrown. There now lie in narrow space the multitudes of
  Palmyra.</p>

  <p>The mangled bodies of Antiochus, Herennianus and Timolaus have been found
  among the slain.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">We go no longer to the city, but remain at our solitary
tower&mdash;now
  however populous as the city itself. We converse of the past and the future;
  but most of my speedy departure for Rome.</p>

  <p>It is the purpose of Gracchus to continue for a season yet in the quiet
  retreat where he now is. He then will return to the capital, and become one
  of those to lay again the foundations of another prosperity.</p>

  <p>'Nature,' he says, 'has given to our city a position and resources which,
  it seems to me, no power of man can deprive her of, nor prevent their always
  creating and sustaining upon this same spot a large population. Circumstances
  like the present may oppress and overwhelm for a time, but time will again
  revive and rebuild, and embellish. I will not for one sit down in inactivity
  or useless grief, but if Aurelian does not hinder, shall apply the remainder
  of my days to the restoration of Palmyra. In Calpurnius and Fausta I shall
  look to find my lieutenants, prompt to execute the commissions intrusted to
  them by their commander.'</p>

  <p>'We shall fall behind,' said Calpurnius, 'I warrant you, in no quality of
  affection or zeal in the great task.'</p>

  <p>'Fausta,' continued Gracchus, 'has as yet no heart but for the dead and
  the lost. But, Lucius, when you shall have been not long in Rome, you will
  hear that she lives then but among the living, and runs before me and
  Calpurnius in every labor that promises advantage to Palmyra.'</p>

  <p>'It may be so,' replied Fausta, 'but I have no faith that it will. We have
  witnessed the death of our country; we have attended the funeral obsequies. I
  have no belief in any rising again from the dead.'</p>

  <p>'Give not way, my child,' said Gracchus, 'to grief and despair. These are
  among the worst enemies of man. They are the true doubters and deniers of the
  gods and their providence, who want a spirit of trust and hope. Hope and
  confidence are the best religion, and the truest worship. I who do not
  believe in the existence of the gods am therefore to be commended for my
  religion more than many of the staunchest defenders of Pagan, Christian, or
  Jewish superstitions, who too often, it seems to me, feel and act as if the
  world were abandoned of all divine care, and its affairs and events the sport
  of a blind chance. What is best for man and the condition of the world, must
  be most agreeable to the gods&mdash;to the creator and possessor of the
  world&mdash;be they one or many. Can we doubt which is best for the remaining
  inhabitants of Palmyra, and the provinces around which are dependent upon her
  trade&mdash;to leave her in her ruin finally and utterly to perish, or apply
  every energy to her restoration? Is it better that the sands of the desert
  should within a few years heap themselves over these remaining walls and
  dwellings, or that we who survive should cleanse, and repair, and rebuild, in
  the confident hope, before we in our turn are called to disappear, to behold
  our beloved city again thronged with its thousands of busy and laborious
  inhabitants? Carthage is again populous as in the days of Hamilcar. You,
  Fausta, may live to see Palmyra what it was in the days of Zenobia.'</p>

  <p>'The gods grant it may be so!' exclaimed Fausta; and a bright smile at the
  vision her father had raised up before her illuminated her features. She
  looked for a moment as if the reality had been suddenly revealed to her, and
  had stood forth in all its glory.</p>

  <p>'I do not despair,' continued Gracchus, 'of the Romans themselves doing
  something toward the restoration of that which they have wantonly and
  foolishly destroyed.'</p>

  <p>'But they cannot give life to the dead, and therefore it is but little
  that they can do at best,' said Fausta. 'They may indeed rebuild the temple
  of the Sun, but they cannot give us back the godlike form of Longinus, and
  kindle within it that intellect that shed light over the world; they may
  raise again the walls of the citizen's humble dwelling, but they cannot
  re-animate the bodies of the slaughtered multitudes, and call them out from
  their trenches to people again the silent streets.'</p>

  <p>'They cannot indeed,' rejoined Gracchus; 'they cannot do every
  thing&mdash;they may not do any thing. But I think they will, and that the
  Emperor himself, when reason returns, will himself set the example. And from
  you, Lucius, when once more in Rome, shall I look for substantial aid in
  disposing favorably the mind both of Aurelian and the Senate.'</p>

  <p>'I can never be more happily employed,'I replied, 'than in serving either
  you or Palmyra. You will have a powerful advocate also in Zenobia.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Gracchus, 'if her life be spared, which must for some time be
  still quite uncertain. After gracing the triumph of Aurelian, she, like
  Longinus, may be offered as a new largess to the still hungering
  legions.'</p>

  <p>'Nay, there I think, Gracchus, you do Aurelian hardly justice. Although he
  has bound himself by no oath, yet virtually is he sworn to spare
  Zenobia&mdash;and his least word is true as his sword.'</p>

  <p>Thus have we passed the last days and hours of my residence here. I should
  in vain attempt, my Curtius, to tell you how strongly I am bound to this
  place&mdash;to this kingdom and city, and above all to those who survive this
  destruction. No Palmyrene can lament with more sincerity than I the whirlwind
  of desolation that has passed over them, obliterating almost their place and
  name&mdash;nor from any one do there ascend more fervent prayers that
  prosperity may yet return, and these wide-spread ruins again rise and glow in
  their ancient beauty. Rome has by former acts of unparalleled barbarism
  covered her name with reproach, but by none has she so drenched it in guilt
  as by this wanton annihilation&mdash;for so do I regard it&mdash;of one of
  the fairest cities and kingdoms of the earth. The day of Aurelian's triumph
  may be a day of triumph to him, but to Rome it will be a day of never
  forgotten infamy.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="letter18"
     id="letter18">LETTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">FROM PISO TO FAUSTA</p>

  <p class="first">I TRUST that you have safely received the letter which, as
we entered the
  Tiber, I was fortunate enough to place on board a vessel bound directly to
  Berytus. In that I have told you of my journey and voyage, and have said many
  other things of more consequence still, both to you, Gracchus, and
  myself.</p>

  <p>I now write to you from my own dwelling upon the Coelian, where I have
  been these many days that have intervened since the date of my former letter.
  If you have waited impatiently to hear from me again, I hope that I shall now
  atone for what may seem a too long delay, by telling you of those concerning
  whom you wish chiefly to hear and know&mdash;Zenobia and Julia.</p>

  <p>But first let me say that I have found Portia in health, and as happy as
  she could be after her bitter disappointment in Calpurnius. This has proved a
  misfortune, less only than the loss of our father himself. That a Piso should
  live, and be other than a Roman; that he should live and bear arms against
  his country&mdash;this has been to her one of those inexplicable mysteries in
  the providence of the gods that has tasked her piety to the utmost. In vain
  has she scrutinized her life to discover what fault has drawn down upon her
  and her house this heavy retribution. Yet her grief is lightened by what I
  have told her of the conduct of Calpurnius at Antioch and Emesa. At such
  times, when I have related the events of those great days, and the part which
  my brother took, the pride of the Roman has yielded to that of the mother,
  and she has not been able to conceal her satisfaction. 'Ah,' she would say,
  'my brave boy! That was like him! I warrant Zabdas himself was not greater!
  What might he not be, were he but in Rome!'</p>

  <p>Portia is never weary with inquiring into every thing relating to yourself
  and Gracchus. My letters, many and minute as they have been, so far from
  satisfying her, serve only as themes for new and endless conversations, in
  which, as well as I am able, I set before her my whole life while in Palmyra,
  and every event, from the conversation at the table or in the porticos, to
  the fall of the city and the death of Longinus. So great is her desire to
  know all concerning the 'hero Fausta,' and so unsatisfying is the all that I
  can say, that I shall not wonder if, after the ceremony of the triumph, she
  should herself propose a journey to Palmyra, to see you once more with her
  own eyes, and once more fold you in her arms. You will rejoice to be told
  that she bewails, even with tears, the ruin of the city, and the cruel
  massacre of its inhabitants. She condemns the Emperor in language as strong
  as you or I should use. The slaughter of Sandarion and his troops she will by
  no means allow to be a sufficient justification of the act. And of her
  opinion are all the chief citizens of Rome.</p>

  <p>I have found Curtius and Lucilia also in health. They are at their villa
  upon the Tiber. The first to greet me there were Laco and Coelia. Their
  gratitude was affecting and oppressive. Indeed there is no duty so hard as to
  receive with grace the thanks of those whom you have obliged. Curtius is for
  once satisfied that I have performed with fidelity the part of a
  correspondent. He even wonders at my diligence. The advantage is, I believe
  for the first time, fairly on my side; though you can yourself bear
  testimony, having heard all his epistles, how many he wrote, and with what
  vividness and exactness he made Rome to pass before us. I think he will not
  be prevented from writing to you by anything I can say. He drops in every
  day, Lucilia sometimes with him, and never leaves us till he has exhausted
  his prepared questions concerning you, and the great events which have taken
  place&mdash;there remaining innumerable points to a man of his exact turn of
  mind, about which he must insist upon fuller and more careful information. I
  think he will draw up a history of the war. I hope he will&mdash;no one could
  do it better.</p>

  <p>Aurelian, you will have heard, upon leaving Palmyra, instead of continuing
  on the route upon which he set out toward Emesa and Antioch, turned aside to
  Egypt, in order to put down by one of his sudden movements the Egyptian
  merchant Firmus, who, with a genius for war greater than for traffic, had
  placed himself at the head of the people, and proclaimed their independence
  of Rome. As the friend and ally of Zenobia&mdash;although he could render her
  during the siege no assistance&mdash;I must pity his misfortunes and his end.
  News has just reached us that his armies have been defeated, he himself taken
  and put to death, and his new-made kingdom reduced again to the condition of
  a Roman province. We now every hour look to hear of the arrival of the
  Emperor and his armies.</p>

  <p>Although there has been observed some secrecy concerning the progress and
  places of residence of Zenobia, yet we learn with a good degree of certainty
  that she is now at Brundusium, awaiting the further orders of Aurelian,
  having gone over-land from Byzantium to Apollonia, and there crossing the
  Adriatic. I have not been much disturbed by the reports which have prevailed,
  because I thought I knew too much of the Queen to think them well grounded.
  Yet I confess I have suffered somewhat when, upon resorting to the capitol or
  the baths, I have found the principal topic to be the death of
  Zenobia&mdash;according to some, of grief, on her way from Antioch to
  Byzantium&mdash;or, as others had it, of hunger, she having resolutely
  refused all nourishment. I have given no credit to the rumor, yet as all
  stories of this kind are a mixture of truth and error, so in this case I can
  conceive easily that it has some foundation in reality, and I am led to
  believe from it that the sufferings of the Queen have been great. How indeed
  could they be otherwise! A feebler spirit than Zenobia's, and a feebler frame
  would necessarily have been destroyed. With what impatience do I await the
  hour that shall see her in Rome! I am happily already relieved of all anxiety
  as to her treatment by Aurelian&mdash;no fear need be entertained for her
  safety. Desirous as far as may be to atone for the rash severity of his
  orders in Syria, he will distinguish with every possible mark of honor the
  Queen, her family, and such other of the inhabitants of Palmyra as have been
  reserved to grace his triumph.</p>

  <p>For this august ceremony the preparations are already making. It is the
  sole topic of conversation, and the single object toward which seem to be
  bent the whole genius and industry of the capital. It is intended to surpass
  in magnificence all that has been done by former Emperors or Generals. The
  materials for it are collecting from every part of the empire, and the
  remotest regions of Asia and Africa. Every day there arrive cargoes either of
  wild beasts or of prisoners, destined to the amphitheatre; illustrious
  captives also from Asia, Germany and Gaul, among whom are Tetricus and his
  son. The Tiber is crowded with vessels bringing in the treasures drawn from
  Palmyra&mdash;her silver and gold&mdash;her statuary and works of
  art&mdash;and every object of curiosity and taste that was susceptible of
  transportation across the desert and the ocean.</p>

  <p>It is now certain that the Queen has advanced as far as Tusculum, where
  with Julia, Livia, Faustula and Vabalathus, they will remain&mdash;at a villa
  of Aurelian's it is said&mdash;till the day of the triumph. Separation seems
  the more painful as they approach nearer. Although knowing that they would be
  scrupulously prohibited from all intercourse with any beyond the precincts of
  the villa itself, I have not been restrained from going again and again to
  Tusculum, and passing through it and around it in the hope to obtain were it
  but a distant glimpse of persons to whom I am bound more closely than to any
  others on earth. But it has been all in vain. I shall not see them till I
  behold them a part of the triumphal procession of their conqueror.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Aurelian has arrived&mdash;the long expected day has
come&mdash;and is
  gone. His triumph has been celebrated, and with a magnificence and a pomp
  greater than the traditionary glories of those of Pompey, Trajan, Titus, or
  even the secular games of Philip.</p>

  <p>I have seen Zenobia!</p>

  <p>The sun of Italy never poured a flood of more golden light upon the great
  capital and its surrounding plains than on the day of Aurelian's triumph. The
  airs of Palmyra were never more soft. The whole city was early abroad, and,
  added to our own overgrown population, there were the inhabitants of all the
  neighboring towns and cities, and strangers from all parts of the empire, so
  that it was with difficulty and labor only, and no little danger too, that
  the spectacle could be seen. I obtained a position opposite the capitol, from
  which I could observe the whole of this proud display of the power and
  greatness of Rome.</p>

  <p>A long train of elephants opened the show, their huge sides and limbs hung
  with cloth of gold and scarlet, some having upon their backs military towers
  or other fanciful structures, which were filled with the natives of Asia or
  Africa, all arrayed in the richest costumes of their countries. These were
  followed by wild animals, and those remarkable for their beauty, from every
  part of the world, either led, as in the case of lions, tigers, leopards, by
  those who from long management of them possessed the same power over them as
  the groom over his horse, or else drawn along upon low platforms, upon which
  they were made to perform a thousand antic tricks for the amusement of the
  gaping and wondering crowds. Then came not many fewer than two thousand
  gladiators in pairs, all arranged in such a manner as to display to the
  greatest advantage their well-knit joints, and projecting and swollen
  muscles. Of these a great number have already perished on the arena of the
  Flavian, and in the sea fights in Domitian's theatre. Next, upon gilded
  wagons, and so arranged as to produce the most dazzling effect, came the
  spoils of the wars of Aurelian&mdash;treasures of art, rich cloths and
  embroideries, utensils of gold and silver, pictures, statues, and works in
  brass, from the cities of Gaul, from Asia and from Egypt. Conspicuous here
  over all were the rich and gorgeous contents of the palace of Zenobia. The
  huge wains groaned under the weight of vessels of gold and silver, of ivory,
  and of the most precious woods of India. The jewelled wine cups, vases, and
  golden sculpture of Demetrius attracted the gaze and excited the admiration
  of every beholder. Immediately after these came a crowd of youths richly
  habited in the costumes of a thousand different tribes, bearing in their
  hands, upon cushions of silk, crowns of gold and precious stones, the
  offerings of the cities and kingdoms of all the world, as it were, to the
  power and fame of Aurelian. Following these came the ambassadors of all
  nations, sumptuously arrayed in the habits of their respective countries.
  Then an innumerable train of captives, showing plainly in their downcast
  eyes, in their fixed and melancholy gaze, that hope had taken its departure
  from their breasts. Among these were many women from the shores of the
  Danube, taken in arms fighting for their country, of enormous stature, and
  clothed in the warlike costume of their tribes.</p>

  <p>But why do I detain you with these things, when it is of one only that you
  wish to hear. I cannot tell you with what impatience I waited for that part
  of the procession to approach where were Zenobia and Julia. I thought its
  line would stretch on forever. And it was the ninth hour before the alternate
  shouts and deep silence of the multitudes announced that the conqueror was
  drawing near the capitol. As the first shout arose, I turned toward the
  quarter whence it came, and beheld, not Aurelian as I expected, but the
  Gallic Emperor Tetricus&mdash;yet slave of his army and of
  Victoria&mdash;accompanied by the prince his son, and followed by other
  illustrious captives from Gaul. All eyes were turned with pity upon him, and
  with indignation too that Aurelian should thus treat a Roman, and
  once&mdash;a Senator. But sympathy for him was instantly lost in a stronger
  feeling of the same kind for Zenobia, who came immediately after. You can
  imagine, Fausta, better than I can describe them, my sensations, when I saw
  our beloved friend&mdash;her whom I had seen treated never otherwise than as
  a sovereign Queen, and with all the imposing pomp of the Persian
  ceremonial&mdash;now on foot, and exposed to the rude gaze of the Roman
  populace&mdash;toiling beneath the rays of a hot sun, and the weight of
  jewels, such as both for richness and beauty, were never before seen in
  Rome&mdash;and of chains of gold, which, first passing around her neck and
  arms, were then borne up by attendant slaves. I could have wept to see her
  so&mdash;yes, and did. My impulse was to break through the crowd and support
  her almost fainting form&mdash;but I well knew that my life would answer for
  the rashness on the spot. I could only therefore, like the rest, wonder and
  gaze. And never did she seem to me, not even in the midst of her own court,
  to blaze forth with such transcendent beauty&mdash;yet touched with grief.
  Her look was not that of dejection of one who was broken and crushed by
  misfortune&mdash;there was no blush of shame. It was rather one of profound
  heartbreaking melancholy, Her full eyes looked as if privacy only was wanted
  for them to overflow with floods of tears. But they fell not. Her gaze was
  fixed on vacancy, or else cast toward the ground. She seemed like one
  unobservant of all around her, and buried in thoughts to which all else were
  strangers, and had nothing in common with. They were in Palmyra, and with her
  slaughtered multitudes. Yet though she wept not, others did; and one could,
  see all along, wherever she moved, the Roman hardness yielding to pity, and
  melting down before the all-subduing presence of this wonderful woman. The
  most touching phrases of compassion fell constantly upon my ear. And ever and
  anon as in the road there would happen some rough or damp place, the kind
  souls would throw down upon it whatever of their garments they could quickest
  divest themselves of, that those feet, little used to such encounters, might
  receive no harm. And as when other parts of the procession were passing by,
  shouts of triumph and vulgar joy frequently arose from the motley crowds, yet
  when Zenobia appeared, a death-like silence prevailed, or it was interrupted
  only by exclamations of admiration or pity, or of indignation at Aurelian for
  so using her. But this happened not long. For when the Emperor's pride had
  been sufficiently gratified, and just there where he came over against the
  steps of the capitol, he himself, crowned as he was with the diadem of
  universal empire, descended from his chariot, and, unlocking the chains of
  gold that bound the limbs of the Queen, led and placed her in her own
  chariot&mdash;that chariot in which she had fondly hoped herself to enter
  Rome in triumph&mdash;between Julia and Livia. Upon this the air was rent
  with the grateful acclamations of the countless multitudes. The Queen's
  countenance brightened for a moment as if with the expressive sentiment, 'The
  gods bless you!' and was then buried in the folds of her robe. And when after
  the lapse of many minutes it was again raised and turned toward the people,
  every one might see that tears burning hot had coursed her cheeks, and
  relieved a heart which else might well have burst with its restrained
  emotion. Soon as the chariot which held her had disappeared upon the other
  side of the capitol, I extricated myself from the crowd and returned home. It
  was not till the shades of evening had fallen, that the last of the
  procession had passed the front of the capitol, and the Emperor reposed
  within the walls of his palace. The evening was devoted to the shows of the
  theatres.</p>

  <p>Seven days succeeding this first day of the triumph have been devoted to
  games and shows. I attended them not, but escaping from the tumult and
  confusion of the city, passed them in a very different manner&mdash;you will
  at once conjecture where and with whom. It was indeed as you suppose in the
  society of Zenobia, Julia, and Livia.</p>

  <p>What the immediate destination of the Queen was to be I knew not, nor did
  any seem to know even so late as the day of the triumph. It was only known
  that her treatment was to be lenient. But on the day after, it became public
  in the city, that the Emperor had bestowed upon her his magnificent villa,
  not far from Hadrian's at Tibur, and at the close of the first day of the
  triumph a chariot of Aurelian in waiting had conveyed her there. This was to
  me transporting news, as it will be to you.</p>

  <p>On the evening of that day I was at Tibur. Had I been a son or a brother,
  the Queen could not have received me with more emotion. But I leave it to you
  to imagine the first moments of our interview. When our greetings were over,
  the first thought, at least the first question, of Zenobia was, concerning
  you and Gracchus. All her inquiries, as well as those of Julia, I was happily
  able to answer in the most exact manner, out of the fulness of your letter.
  When I had finished this agreeable duty, the Queen said,</p>

  <p>'Our happiness were complete, as now it can be, could Fausta and Gracchus
  be but added to our numbers. I shall hope, in the lapse of days or months, to
  entice them away for a season from their melancholy home. And yet what better
  can I offer them here? There they behold their city in ruins; here their
  Queen. There they already detect some tokens of reviving life; here they
  would have before them but the picture of decay and approaching death. But
  these things I ought not to say. Piso, you will be glad to learn the purposes
  of Aurelian concerning Palmyra. He has already set apart large sums for the
  restoration of its walls and temples; and what is more and better, he has
  made Gracchus governor of the city and province, with liberal promises of
  treasure to carry into effect whatever designs he may conceive as most likely
  to people again the silent streets, and fill them with the merchants of the
  East and the West.'</p>

  <p>'Aurelian, I am persuaded,'I replied, 'will feel upon him the weight of
  the strongest motives to do all that he can to repair the injuries he has
  inflicted. Then too, in addition to this, his nature is generous.'</p>

  <p>'It is so,' said Julia. 'How happy if he had been less subject to his
  passions! The proofs of a generous nature you see here, Piso, every where
  around us. This vast and magnificent palace, with its extensive grounds, has
  he freely bestowed upon us; and here, as your eye has already informed you,
  has he caused to be brought and arranged every article of use or luxury found
  in the palace of Palmyra, and capable of transportation.'</p>

  <p>'I could hardly believe,'I said, 'as I approached the great entrance, and
  beheld objects so familiar&mdash;still more, when I came within the walls and
  saw around me all that I had seen in Palmyra, that I was indeed in the
  vicinity of Rome, and had not been by some strange power transported suddenly
  to Asia. In the rash violence of Aurelian in Syria, and in this reparation,
  both here and there, of the evil he has committed to the farthest extent
  possible, you witness a genuine revelation of his character. Would that
  principle rather than passion were the governing power of his life!'</p>

  <p>Although I have passed many days at Tibur, yet have I seen but little of
  Zenobia. She is silent and solitary. Her thoughts are evidently never with
  the present, but far back among the scenes of her former life. To converse is
  an effort. The lines of grief have fixed themselves upon her countenance; her
  very form and manner are expressive of a soul bowed and subdued by
  misfortune. Her pride seems no longer, as on the day of the triumph, to bear
  her up. It is Zenobia before me, but&mdash;like her own beautiful
  capital&mdash;it is Zenobia in ruins. That she suffers too from the
  reproaches of a mind now conscious of its errors I cannot doubt. She blames
  Aurelian, but I am persuaded she blames with no less severity herself. It is,
  I doubt not, the image of her desolated country rising before her, that
  causes her so often in the midst of discourse with us, or when she has been
  sitting long silent, suddenly to start and clasp her hands, and withdraw
  weeping to her apartments, or the seclusion of the garden.</p>

  <p>'It will be long, very long,' Julia has said to me, 'before Zenobia will
  recover from this grief&mdash;if indeed she ever do. Would that the
  principles of that faith, which we have learned to believe and prize, were
  also hers! Life would then still place before her a great object, which now
  she wants. The past absorbs her wholly&mdash;the future is nothing. She
  dwells upon glories that are departed forever, and is able to anticipate no
  other, or greater, in this world&mdash;nor with certainty in any beyond
  it.'</p>

  <p>I said, 'But doubtless she throws herself at this season upon her Jewish
  faith and philosophy. She has ever spoken of it with respect at least, if not
  with affection.'</p>

  <p>'I do not,' Julia replied, 'think that her faith in Judaism is of much
  avail to her. She has found pleasure in reading the sacred books of the Jews,
  and has often expressed warmly her admiration of the great principles of
  moral living and of religious belief found in them; but I do not think that
  she has derived from them that which she conceives to be the sum of all
  religion and philosophy, a firm belief and hope of immortality. I am sure she
  has not. She has sometimes spoken as if such a belief possessed likelihood,
  but never as if she entertained it in the way the Christian does.'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">You will rejoice, dear Fausta, to learn that Zenobia no
longer opposes me;
  but waits with impatience for the day when I shall be an inmate of her
  palace.</p>

  <p>What think you is the news to-day in Rome? No other and no less than
  this&mdash;which you may well suppose has for some time been no news to
  me&mdash;that Livia is to be Empress! It has just been made public by
  authority; and I despatch my letter that you may be immediately informed of
  it. It has brought another expression upon the countenance of Zenobia.</p>

  <p>Curtius and Lucilia have this moment come in, and full of these tidings
  interrupt me&mdash;they with Portia wish to be remembered to you with
  affection. I shall soon write again&mdash;telling you then especially of my
  interviews with Aurelian, and of Probus. Farewell.</p>

  <p><i>"Et quidem peregrina, nomine Zenobia, de qua jam multa dicta sunt, quae

  purpureo, gemmis dependentibus per ultimam fimbriam media etiam cyclade

  Batav. 1661, p. 787.</p>

  <p><i>"Ille (Odenatus) plane cum uxore Zenobia non solum Orientem quem jam in
  pristinum reformaverat statum, sed omnes omnino totius orbis partes
  reformasset, vir acer in bellis, et, quantum plerique scriptores loquuntur,

  assueta, quae multorum sententia fortior marito fuisse perhibetur; mulierum
  omnium nobilissima, Orientalium faeminarum et (ut Cornelius Capitolinus
  asserit) speciocissima."</i>&mdash;-Ib. p. 771</p>

  <p>Also what Aurelian himself says in a letter to the Roman Senate, preserved
  by Pollio.</p>

  <p><i>"Audio, P.C. mihi objici quod non virile munus impleverim, Zenobiam
  triumphando. Nae illi qui me reprehendunt satis laudarant, si scirent qualis
  ilia est mulier, quam prudens in consiliis, quam constans in dispositionibus,
  quam erga milites gravis, quam larga quum necessitas postulet, quam tristis
  quum severitas poscat. Possum dicere illius esse quod Odenatus Persos vicit,
  ac Sapore fugato Ctesiphontem usque pervenit. Possum asserere, tanto apud
  Orientalis et Egyptiorum populos timori mulierem fuisse, ut se non Arabes,
  non Sarraceni, non Armeni commoverent. Nec ego illi vitam conservassem nisi
  eam scissem multum Rom. Repub. profuisse, quurn sibi, vel liberis suis
  Orientis servaret imperium," etc.</i></p>

  <p>Piso, it will be observed, makes no mention of, nor allusion to, the story
  recorded by the historian Zosimus, of the Queen's public accusation of
  Longinus and the other principal persons of Palmyra, as authors of the
  rebellion, in order to save her own life. It is well known that Zenobia,
  chiefly on the authority of this historian, has been charged with having laid
  upon Longinus and her other counsellors, all the blame of the revolt, as if
  she had been driven by them against her will into the course she pursued. The
  words of Zosimus are as follows:</p>

  <p><i>'Emisam rediit et Zenobiam cum suis complicibus pro tribunali stitit.
  Illa causas exponens, et eulpa semet eximens multos alios in medium protulit,
  qui cam veluti faeminam seduxissent; quorum in numero et Longinus
  erat.&mdash;Itidem alii quos Zenobia detulerat suppliciis
  adficiebatur.'</i></p>

  <p>This is suspicious upon the face of it. As if Aurelian needed a formal
  tribunal and the testimony of Zenobia to inform him who the great men of
  Palmyra were, and her chief advisers. Longinus, at least, we may suppose, was
  as well known as Zenobia. But if there was a formal tribunal, then evidence
  was heard&mdash;and not upon one side only, but both. If therefore the
  statements of Zenobia were false, there were Longinus and the other accused
  persons, with their witnesses, to make it appear so. If they were
  true&mdash;if she had been overruled&mdash;led&mdash;or driven&mdash;by her
  advisers, then it was not unreasonable that punishment&mdash;if some must
  suffer&mdash;should fall where it did.</p>

  <p>But against Zosimus may be arrayed the words of Aurelian himself, in a
  letter addressed to the Roman senate, and preserved by Pollio. He says,</p>

  <p>'Nec ego illi (Zenobiae) vitam conservassem, nisi eam scissem multum
  Romanae rei publicae profuisse, cum sibi vel liberis suis orientis servaret
  imperium.'</p>

  <p>Aurelian here says that he would not have spared her life but for one
  reason, namely, that she had done such signal service to the republic, when
  either for herself or for her children she had saved the empire in the East.
  Aurelian spared her life, if he himself is to be believed, <i>because of
  services rendered to Rome,</i> NOT because by the accusation of others she
  had cleared herself of the charge of rebellion. Her life was never in any
  danger, if this be true; and unless it were, she of course had no motive to
  criminate Longinus in the manner related by Zosimus.</p>

  <p>Longinus and his companions suffered therefore, not in consequence of any
  special accusation&mdash;it was not needed for their condemnation&mdash;but
  as a matter of course, because they were leaders and directors of the revolt.
  It was the usage of war.</p>

  <p>Why are Pollio (the biographer of Zenobia) and Vopiscus (the biographer of
  Aurelian) and Zonaras all silent respecting so remarkable a point of the
  history of Zenobia? Pollio does not hesitate to say that she had been thought
  by some to have been partner in the crime of murdering Odenatus and his son
  Herod&mdash;a charge which never found credit in any quarter. Such a
  biographer surely would not have passed over in silence the unutterable
  baseness of Zenobia in the accusation of Longinus, if he had ever heard of it
  and had esteemed it to have come to him as well vouched at least as the other
  story. Omission under such circumstances is good evidence that it came to him
  not so well vouched&mdash;that is, not vouched at all.</p>

  <p>Supposing Zenobia to have been guilty of the crime laid to her charge,
  could Aurelian have treated her afterwards in the way he did? He not only
  took her to Rome and gave her a palace at Tibur, and the state of a Queen,
  but according to some, [Footnote: Filiam (Zenobiae) unam uxorem duxisse
  Aurellanum; caeteras nobilibus Romanis despondisee.&mdash;Zonoras, lib. xii.
  p. 480.] married one of her daughters. Could he have done all this had she
  been the mean, base and wicked woman Zosimus makes her out to be? The history
  of this same eastern expedition furnishes a case somewhat in point, and which
  may serve to show in what light he would probably have regarded Zenobia.
  Tyana, a city of Asia Minor, for a long time resisted all his attempts to
  reduce it. At length it was betrayed into his hands by one of its chief
  citizens, Heraclammon. How did Aurelian receive and treat him after entering
  the city? Let Vopiscus reply: 'Nam et Heraclammon proditorem patriae suse
  sapiens victor occidit.'&mdash;'Heraclammon who betrayed his country the
  conqueror wisely slew.' But this historian has preserved a letter of
  Aurelian, in which he speaks of this same traitor:</p>

  <p><i>'Aurelianus Aug: Mallio Chiloni. Occidi passus sum cujus quasi
  beneficio Tyanam recepi. Ego vero proditorem amare non potui; et libenter
  tuli quod eum milites occiderunt: neque enim mihi fidem servare potuisset qui
  patriae non pepercit,' etc.</i> He permits Heraclammon to be slain <i>because
  he could not love a traitor</i>, and <i>because one who had betrayed his
  country could not be trusted</i>&mdash;while Zenobia, if Zosimus is to be
  believed, whose act was of the same kind&mdash;only infinitely more
  base&mdash;he receives and crowns with distinguished honor, and marries her
  daughter!</p>

  <p><i>'Zosime pr&eacute;tend,'</i> says Tillemont, <i>'que ce f&ucirc;t
  Zenobie m&ecirc;me qui se d&eacute;chargea sur eux des choses don't on
  l'accusoit, (ce qui r&eacute;pondroit bien mal a cette grandeur d'&acirc;me
  qu'on l'ay attribu&eacute;.'</i>)&mdash;Hist, des Emp. t. II. p.
  <i>212</i>.</p>

  <p>The evidence of Zosimus is not of so high a character as justly to weigh
  against a strong internal improbability, or the silence of other historians.
  Gibbon says of him, 'In good policy we must use the service of Zosimus
  without esteeming him or trusting him,' and repeatedly designates him as
  'credulous,' 'partial,' 'disingenuous.' By Tillemont he is called a 'bad
  authority.'</p>

  <p>Nothing would seem to be plainer, than that Aurelian spared Zenobia
  because she was a woman; because she was a beautiful and every way remarkable
  woman; and as he himself says, because she had protected and saved the empire
  in the East; and that he sacrificed Longinus and the other chief men of
  Palmyra, because such was the usage of war.</p>

  <p>Page 122. Piso speaks of the prowess of Aurelian, and of the songs sung in
  the camp in honor of him. Vopiscus has preserved one of these.</p>

  <p><i>'Mille mille, mille, decollavimus,<br>
  Unus homo! mille decollavimus,<br>
  Mille bibat qui mille occidit.<br>
  Tantum vini habet nemo, quantum fudit sanguinis.'</i></p>

  <p><i>'Mille Sarmatas, mille Francos<br>
  Semel et semel occidimus<br>
  Mille Persas quaerimus.'</i></p>

  <p>The two letters on pages 135 and 137, it will be observed, are nearly the
  same as those found in Vopiscus.</p>

  <p>On page 172, Aurelian is designated by a soldier under the nick-name of
  'Hand-to-his-Sword.' Vopiscus also mentions this as a name by which he was
  known in the army. <i>'Nam quum essent in exercitu duo Aureliani tribuni,
  hic, et alius qui cum Valeriano captus est, huic signum (cognomen) exercitus
  apposuerat "Mannus ad ferrum,"' etc.</i></p>

  <p>Page 280. Piso represents Aurelian as wearing a crown. He was the first
  since the Tarquins who had dared to invest his brow with that symbol of
  tyranny. So says Aurelius Victor. <i>'Iste primus apud Romanos Diadema capiti
  innexuit; gemmisque et aurata omni veste, quod adhuc fere incognitum Romanis
  moribus videbatur, usus est.'</i></p>

  <p>On the same page, in the account of the triumph, a chariot of Zenobia is
  stated to have been exhibited, in which it was her belief that she should
  enter Rome in triumph, which indeed had been made for that very purpose. This
  singular fact is confirmed by Vopiscus&mdash;'<i>tertius, (currus) quem sibi
  Zenobia composuerat sperans se urbem Romanam cum eo visuram; quod eam non
  fefellit, nam cum eo urbem ingressa est victa et triumphata.'</i></p><br>
