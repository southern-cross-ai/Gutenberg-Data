  <h2><a id="part1"
     name="part1">PART I</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="intro"
     name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

  <p class="blurb"><i>Centuries come and go; but the plot of the drama is
  unchanged, and the same characters play the same parts. Only the actors cast
  for them are new.</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">IT is much worn,&mdash;this denarius,&mdash;and the lines
  are softened and blurred,&mdash;as of right they should be, when you think
  that more than two thousand years have passed since it felt the die. It is
  lying before me now on my table, and my eyes rest dreamily on its helmeted
  head of Pallas Nicephora. There, behind her, is the mint-mark and that word
  of ancient power and glory, "Roma." Below are letters so worn and indistinct
  that I must bend close to read them: "&mdash;M. SERGI," and then others that
  I cannot trace.</p>

  <p>Perhaps I have dozed a bit, for I must have turned the coin, unthinking,
  and now I see the reverse: a horseman, in full panoply, galloping, with naked
  sword brandished in his left hand, from which depends a severed head
  tight-clutched by long, flowing hair.</p>

  <p>The clouds hang low over the city, as I peer from my tower
  window,&mdash;driving, ever driving, from the east, and changing, ever
  changing, their fantastic shapes. Now they are the waving hands and gowns of
  a closely packed multitude surging with human passions; now they are the
  headlong rout of a flying army upon which press hordes of riders, dark,
  fierce, and barbarous&mdash;horses with tumultuous manes, and hands with
  brandished darts. Surely it is a sleepy, workless day! It will be vain to
  drive my pen across the pages.</p>

  <p>I do not see the cloud forms now&mdash;not with my eyes, for they have
  closed themselves perforce; but my brain is awake, and I know that the eyes
  of Pallas Nicephora see them, and grow brighter as if gazing on
  well-remembered scenes.</p>

  <p>Why not? How many thousand clinkings of coin against coin in purse and
  pouch, how many hundred impacts of hands that long since are dust, have
  served to dim your once clear relief!</p>

  <p>Surely, Pallas, you have looked upon all this and much more. Shall I see
  aught with your eyes, lady of my Sergian denarius? Shall I see, if, with you
  before me, I look fixedly at the legions of that cross my window an
  hour&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;even until the night closes in?</p>

  <p>Grant but a grain of this, O Goddess, and lo! I vow to thee a troop of
  pipe-players upon the Ides of June.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap101"
     name="chap101">I. &mdash; NEWS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"A TROOP of pipe-players to Minerva on the Ides of June, if
  we win!"</p>

  <p>"And my household to Mars, if we have lost!"</p>

  <p>The speakers were hurrying along the street that leads down from the
  Palatine Hill toward the Forum, and both were young. Their high shoes
  fastened with quadruple thongs and adorned with small silver crescents
  proclaimed their patrician rank.</p>

  <p>"Why do you vow as if the gods had already passed judgment, Lucius?"</p>

  <p>"Because, my Caius, I am very sure that a battle has been fought. What
  else do these rumours mean that are flying through the city? rumours that
  none can trace to a source. It is only a few minutes, since my freedman,
  Atius, told me how the slaves report that our neighbour Marcus Sabrius rode
  in last night through the Ratumenian Gate; and when I sent to his house to
  inquire, the doorkeeper feigned ignorance. That is only one of a hundred
  tales. Note the crowd thickening around us as we approach the Forum, and how
  all are pressing in the same direction. Study their faces, and doubt what I
  say if you can."</p>

  <p>"But is it victory or defeat?"</p>

  <p>"Answer me your own question, Caius. Is 'victory' or 'defeat'the word that
  men do not dare to utter?"</p>

  <p>The face of Caius became grave. Then suddenly he burst out
  with:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You are right. I see it all now, even as you speak; and what hope had we
  from the first? Who was the demagogue Flaminius that he should command our
  army, going forth without the auspices&mdash;a consul that was no consul at
  all in the sight of the gods! Then, too, there were the warnings that poured
  in from all the country: the ships in the sky, the crow alighting on the
  couch in the Temple of Juno, the stones rained in Picinum&mdash; "</p>

  <p>"Foolish stories, my Caius; the dreams of ignorant rustics," replied
  Lucius, smiling faintly. "Besides, you remember they were all
  expiated&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And who knows that they were expiated truly!" croaked an old woman from a
  booth by the road. "Who does not know that, as Varro says, your patrician
  magistrates would rather lose a battle than that a plebeian consul should
  triumph! Varbo, the butcher, dreamed last night that his son's blood was
  drenching his bed, and when he awoke, it was water from the roof; and Arates,
  the Greek soothsayer, says that Varbo's son has been slain in the water, and
  his blood&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the young patricians, who had halted a moment at the interruption, now
  hurried on with an expression of contempt on their faces.</p>

  <p>"That is what Flaminius stands for," resumed Lucius after a moment of
  silence. "How can we look for success when such men are raised to the
  command, merely because they <i>are</i>such men; and when a Fabius and a
  Claudius are set aside because their fathers' fathers led the armies of the
  Republic to victory in the days when this rabble were the slaves they should
  still be."</p>

  <p>The friends had turned into the Sacred Way. A moment later they arrived at
  the Forum lined with its rows of booths nestled away beneath massive
  porticoes of peperino, and with its columned temples standing like divine
  sentinels about or sweeping away up the rugged slope of the Capitoline to
  where the great fane of Jupiter Capitolinus shed its protecting glory over
  the destinies of Rome.</p>

  <p>Below, the broad expanse of Forum and Comitia was thronged with a surging
  crowd&mdash; patricians and plebeians,&mdash;elbowing and pushing one another
  in mad efforts to get closer to the Rostra and to a small group of
  magistrates, who, with grave faces, were clustered at the foot of its steps.
  These latter spoke to each other in whispers, but such a babel of sounds
  swelled up around them that they might safely have screamed without fear of
  being overheard.</p>

  <p>The booths were emptied of their cooks and butchers and silversmiths.
  Waving arms and the flutter of robes emphasized the discussions going on on
  every side. Here a rumour-monger was telling his tale to a gaping cluster of
  pallid faces; there a plebeian pot-house orator was arraigning the upper
  classes to a circle of lowering brows and clenched fists, while the sneering
  face of some passing patrician told of a disdain beyond words, as he gathered
  his toga closer to avoid the contamination of the rabble.</p>

  <p>One sentiment, however, seemed to prevail over all, and, beside it,
  curiosity, party rancour, wrath, and contempt were as nothing. It was anxiety
  sharpened even into dread that brooded everywhere and controlled all other
  passions, while itself threatening at every moment to sweep away the barriers
  and to loose the warm southern blood of the citizens into a seething flood of
  furious riot or headlong panic.</p>

  <p>The two young men had descended into this maelstrom of popular excitement,
  and were making such headway as they could toward the central point of
  interest. Now and again they passed friends who either looked straight into
  their faces, without a sign of recognition, or else burst out into floods of
  information,&mdash;prayers for news or vouchsafings of it,&mdash; news, good
  or bad, true or false. Perhaps three-fourths of the distance had been covered
  at the expense of torn togas and bruised sides, when a sudden commotion in
  front showed that something was happening. The next moment the hard, stern
  face of Marcus Pomponius Matho, the praetor peregrinus, rose above the crowd,
  and then the broad purple band upon his toga, as he mounted the steps of the
  Rostra.</p>

  <p>It seemed hours&mdash;almost days&mdash;that he stood there, grave and
  silent, looking down into the sea of upturned faces, while the roar of the
  multitude died away into a gentle murmur, and then into a silence so
  oppressive that each man seemed to be holding his breath. Once the
  magistrate's lips moved, but no words came from them, and strange noises, as
  of the clenching of teeth and sharp, quick breathing, rose all about. Then a
  voice came from his mouth, the very calmness of which seemed
  terrible:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Quirites, we have been beaten in a great battle. Our army is destroyed,
  and Caius Flaminius, the consul, is killed."</p>

  <p>For a moment there was stillness deeper almost than before, as if the
  leadlike words were sinking slowly but steadily along passage and nerve down
  to the central seats of consciousness; then burst forth a sound as of a
  single groan&mdash;the groan of Jupiter himself in mortal anguish; and then
  the noise of women weeping, the shrieking treble of age, and the rumbling
  murmur of curses and execrations,&mdash;against senate and nobles, against
  the rabble and their dead leader, but, above all, against Carthage and her
  terrible captain.</p>

  <p>"Who are these men that slay consuls and destroy armies?" piped the shrill
  voice of an aged cripple who had struggled up from where he sat upon the
  steps of Castor, and was shaking the stump of a wrist toward the north.</p>

  <p>"Are they not the men who surrendered Sicily that we might let them escape
  from us at Eryx? Did they not give up their ships, and pay us tribute, and
  scurry out of Sardinia that Rome might spare them? I&mdash;I who am talking
  to you have seen their armies: naked barbarians from the deserts, naked
  barbarians from the woods&mdash;not one well-armed man in five&mdash;a rabble
  with a score of languages, to whom no general can talk. <i>They</i> to
  destroy the army of Rome&mdash;in her own land!&mdash;what crime have we
  committed that the gods should deal with us thus?"</p>

  <p>"But the great beasts that tear up the ranks?" put in a young butcher, one
  of the circle that had been drawn together about the veteran.</p>

  <p>"How did his elephants save Pyrrhus&mdash;and then we saw them for the
  first time?" retorted the cripple.</p>

  <p>"You forget, that was before Rome had become the prey of demagogues;
  before she had Flaminii for consuls."</p>

  <p>All turned toward the new speaker&mdash;the young patrician whom his
  companion had called Lucius. He was a man perhaps twenty-five years of age,
  of middle height, sparely built but as if of tempered steel, with strong,
  commanding features and dark hawklike eyes that were now glittering with
  passion. It was not a handsome face except so far as strength and pride make
  masculine beauty, but it was the face of one whom a man might trust and a
  woman love.</p>

  <p>The butcher was on the point of returning an angry retort, half to hide
  his awe of the other's rank, when a friend caught him by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Do you not see it is Lucius Sergius Fidenas?" he whispered.</p>

  <p>The result of the warning was still doubtful, when a sudden commotion in
  the crowd about them drew the attention of all to a short, thick-set man of
  middle age, in the light panoply of a mounted legionary. Cries went up from
  all about:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It is Marcus Decius." "He is from the army." "Tell us! what news?"</p>

  <p>For answer the newcomer turned from one to the other of his questioners,
  with a dazed expression on his pale, drawn face.</p>

  <p>"What shall I say, neighbours?" he muttered at last. "My horse fell just
  out there on the Flaminian road, and I came here on foot. I have eaten
  nothing for a day."</p>

  <p>But they paid no attention to his wants, thronging around with almost
  threatening gestures and crying:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"What news? What news&mdash;not of yourself&mdash;of the army?&mdash;of
  the battle?"</p>

  <p>"There was no battle, and there is no army," said the man, dully.</p>

  <p>Sergius forced his way to the front and threw one arm about the soldier.
  Then, turning to the crowd:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Stand back!" he cried, "and give him air. Do you not see the fellow is
  fainting?"</p>

  <p>"No battle&mdash;and yet no army," repeated Decius, in a murmurous
  monotone, when, for a moment, there were silence and space around him. "We
  marched by the Lake Trasimenus, and the fog lay thick upon us. Then came a
  noise of shouts and clash of arms and shrieks, but we saw nothing&mdash;only
  sometimes a great, white, naked body swinging a huge sword, and again a black
  man buried in his horse's mane that waved about him as he rushed by&mdash;
  only these things and our own men falling&mdash;falling without ever a chance
  to strike or to see whence we were stricken."</p>

  <p>The crowd shuddered.</p>

  <p>"And the elephants?"</p>

  <p>"I did not see them. They say they are all dead."</p>

  <p>"And the consul?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know."</p>

  <p>Just then the cripple from the steps was pushed forward.</p>

  <p>"Flaminius is dead. He died fighting, as a Roman consul should. But you?
  What are you, to let the pulse-eaters at him. You should have seen how
  <i>we</i> dealt with them off the Aegusian Islands."</p>

  <p>"Or at Drepana?" sneered the horseman, roused from his lethargy by the
  other's taunt.</p>

  <p>"That was what a <i>patrician</i> consul brought us to," muttered the
  cripple, glancing at Sergius. "Do you know what the Claudian did? When the
  sacred chickens would not eat, he cried out, 'Then they shall drink,' and
  ordered them thrown overboard. How could soldiers win when an impious
  commander had first challenged the gods?"</p>

  <p>"And what about Flaminius ordering our standards to be dug up when they
  could not be drawn from the earth?" retorted the other.</p>

  <p>"Did he do that?" asked several, and for a moment the feeling that had
  been with the cripple, and against the victim of this latest disaster, seemed
  divided.</p>

  <p>Sergius perceived only too clearly that, in the present temper of men's
  minds, the faintest spark could light fires of riot and murder that might
  leave but a heap of ashes and corpses for the Carthaginian to gain. Taking
  advantage of the momentary lull, he said in conciliatory tones:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Flaminius neglected the auspices, and disaster came upon us for his
  impiety, but it appears that he died like a brave soldier, and he is a
  whip-knave who strikes at such. As for this man, he needs succour and care.
  Stand aside, then, that I may take him where his wants may be ministered to.
  There will soon be plenty of fugitives to fill your ears with tales."</p>

  <p>"Not many, master, not many," murmured Decius, as the young man forced a
  way for them through the crowd. "Some are taken, but most lie in the defile
  of Trasimenus or under the waters of the Lake."</p>

  <p>Sergius hurried on, thinking of Varbo the butcher's dream, and of Arates
  the Greek soothsayer's interpretation.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap102"
     name="chap102">II. &mdash; WORDS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THREE DAYS had passed since the awful news from the shore of
  Lake Trasimenus had plunged Rome into horror and despair. Every hour had
  brought in stragglers: horse, foot, fugitives from the country-side, each
  bearing his tale of slaughter. Crowds gathered at the gates, swarming about
  every newcomer, vociferous for his story, and then cursing and threatening
  the teller because it was what they knew it must be.</p>

  <p>In the atrium of Titus Manlius Torquatus, on the brow of the Palatine,
  overlooking the New Way, was gathered a company of three: the aged master of
  the house, a type of the Roman of better days, and a worthy descendant of
  that Torquatus who had won the name; his son Caius, the youth who had been
  with Sergius in the Forum; and Lucius Sergius himself. All were silent and
  serious.</p>

  <p>The elder Torquatus sat by a square fountain ornamented with bronze
  dolphins, that lay in the middle of the mosaic paving of the apartment. The
  walls were painted half yellow, half red, after the manner of Magna Grascia,
  while around them were ranged the statues of the Manlian nobles. The roof was
  supported in the Tuscan fashion by four beams crossing each other at right
  angles, and including between them the open space above the fountain.</p>

  <p>It was the old man who spoke first.</p>

  <p>"Do not think, my Lucius, but that I see the justice of your prayer, or
  that I wish otherwise than that Marcia should wind wool about your doorposts.
  Still there is much to be said for delay. Surely these days are not
  auspicious ones for marriages, and surely better will come. You have my
  pledge, as had my dead friend Marcus Marcius in the matter of her name. Do
  you think it was nothing for me to call a daughter other than
  Manlia&mdash;and for a plebeian house at that? Yet she is Marcia. Doubt not
  that I will keep this word as well."</p>

  <p>"Aye, but, father," persisted Sergius, "is it not something that she
  should be mine to protect in time of peril?"</p>

  <p>"And who so able to protect as Lucius," put in Caius, with an admiring
  glance, for Caius Torquatus was six years younger than his friend, and
  admired him with all the devotion of a younger man.</p>

  <p>"Has it come that our house cannot protect its women?" cried the elder
  Torquatus. "What more shameful than that our daughter should be carried thus
  across a Sergian threshold&mdash; going like a slave to her master!" He spoke
  proudly and sternly. Then, turning to Sergius, he went on more gently: "Were
  you to remain in the city, my son, there might be more force in what you
  claim; but you will go out with one of the new legions that they will
  doubtless raise, and you will believe an old man who says that it is not well
  for a soldier in the field to have a young wife at home."</p>

  <p>Sergius flushed and was silent, lest his answer should savour of pride or
  disrespect toward an elder.</p>

  <p>Suddenly they became conscious of a commotion in the street. Shrill cries
  were borne to their ears, and, a moment later, blows fell upon the outer
  door, followed by the grinding noise as it turned upon its pivots. A freedman
  burst into the atrium.</p>

  <p>Titus Torquatus rose from his seat, and half raised his staff as if to
  punish the unceremonious intrusion. Then he noted the excitement under which
  the man seemed to be labouring, and stood stern and silent to learn what news
  could warrant such a breach of decorum.</p>

  <p>"It is Maharbal, they say&mdash;" and the speaker's voice came almost in
  gasps&mdash; "Maharbal and the Numidians&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not at the gates!" cried both young men, springing to their feet; but the
  other shook his head and went on:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"No, not that&mdash;not <i>yet</i>, but he has cut up four thousand
  cavalry in Umbria with Caius Centenius. The consul had sent them from
  Gaul&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Be silent!" commanded the elder Torquatus. "Surely I hear the public
  crier in the street. Is he not summoning the Senate? Velo," he said, turning
  to the freedman; "you are pardoned for your intrusion. Go, now, and bear
  orders from me to arm my household, and that my clients and freedmen wait
  upon me in the morning. It is possible that the Republic may call for every
  man; and though I fear Titus Manlius Torquatus cannot strike the blows he
  struck in Sicily, yet even <i>his</i> sword might avail to pierce light
  armour; and he is happy in that he can give those to the State whose muscles
  shall suffice to drive the point through heavy buckler and breastplate."</p>

  <p>"Shall it be permitted that I attend you to the Senate House?" asked
  Caius.</p>

  <p>His father inclined his head, and, donning the togas which slaves had
  brought, they hurried into the street, hardly noting that Sergius had
  reseated himself and was gazing absently down into the water, counting the
  ripples that spread from where each threadlike stream fell from its
  dolphin-mouth source.</p>

  <p>He did not know how long he had sat thus, nor was he, perhaps, altogether
  conscious of his motive in failing to pay the aged senator the honour of
  accompanying him, at least so far as the gates of the Temple of Concord.
  Sounds came to his ears from the apartments above: the trampling of feet and
  bustle of preparation that told of Velo's delivery of his patron's commands.
  Then a woman's laugh rang through the passage that led back to the garden of
  the peristyle.</p>

  <p>Sergius rose and turned, just as a girl sprang out into the atrium,
  looking back with a laughing challenge to some one who seemed to pursue her,
  but who hesitated to issue from the protecting darkness.</p>

  <p>"What do you fear, Minutia," she cried. "My father and Caius have gone,
  and there is no one&mdash;oh!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly she became conscious of Sergius' presence, and her olive cheeks
  flushed to a rich crimson. Then she faced him with an air of pretty defiance
  and went on:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"No one here but Lucius Sergius Fidenas, who should have business
  elsewhere."</p>

  <p>Sergius said nothing, but continued to stand with eyes fixed thoughtfully
  upon her face.</p>

  <p>Her figure was tall, slender, and very graceful, her hair and eyes were
  dark, and her features delicate and perfectly moulded. Over all was now an
  expression of hoydenish mirth that bespoke the complete forgetfulness of
  serious things that only comes to young girls. His attentive silence seemed
  at last to disturb her. An annoyed look drove the smile from her lips, and,
  with an almost imperceptible side motion of her small head, she went
  on:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Surely Lucius Sergius Fidenas has not allowed my father to go to the
  Senate House with only Caius to attend him! Lucius respects my father too
  much for that&mdash;and too disinterestedly. It is an even more serious
  omission than his failure to attend the consul at Trasimenus&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sergius' eyes blazed at the taunt, and, struggling with the answer that
  rose to his lips, he said nothing for fear he might say too much.</p>

  <p>The girl watched him closely. Her mirth returned a little at the sight of
  his confusion, and, with her mirth, came something of mercy.</p>

  <p>"Oh, to be sure, his wound. I almost forgot that. Tell me, my brave
  Lucius, did the Gauls bite hard when they caught you in the woods and drove
  you and my brave uncle to Tanes? How funny for naked Gauls to ambush Roman
  legionaries and chase them home! Father has not spoken to Uncle Cneus since.
  He says it was his duty to have remained on the field, and I suppose he
  thinks it was yours, too, instead of running away like a fox to be shut up in
  his hole."</p>

  <p>Sergius had recovered his composure now, but his brow was clouded.</p>

  <p>"You are as cruel as ever, Marcia," he said. "And yet I know you have
  heard that it was the men of my maniple who carried me away, senseless from
  the blow of a dead man."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you <i>did</i> kill him. I remember now," she resumed, with some
  display of interest. "You had run him through, had you not? and he just let
  his big sword drop on your head. I got Caius to show me about it, and I was
  the Gaul. Caius did not stab me, but I let the stick fall pretty hard, and
  Caius had a sore head for two days. I meant it for you, because you are
  trying to make an old woman of me when I am hardly a girl."</p>

  <p>"Marcia&mdash;" began Lucius; but she raised her hand warningly and went
  on:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to tell you why my father will not let you marry me now?
  There are two reasons. One because I don't want him to, and another because
  he thinks you must do something great to wipe out the stain of a Roman
  centurion's even being <i>carried</i> away before the Gauls."</p>

  <p>"That will be an easy task, judging by the news we receive each day. I
  wish I felt as certain of the safety of the Republic as I am that my honour
  shall be satisfactorily vindicated."</p>

  <p>He spoke bitterly, but she went on without taking note of his meaning.</p>

  <p>"These are auspicious words, my Lucius. You will regain your honour;
  father will once more receive you into his favour, and, by that time, I shall
  doubtless be old enough to marry,&mdash;perhaps too old,&mdash;but, no, I
  must not wait so long as that. Perhaps I shall have married some one else by
  the time you are worthy of my favour."</p>

  <p>"More probably I shall have ceased to care for the favour of living men
  and women."</p>

  <p>"Truly? And you think you will have to die? Perhaps you will be a Decius
  Mus, and stand on the javelin and wear the Cincture Gabinus; and then I shall
  mourn for you and hang so many garlands on your tomb that all the shades of
  your friends will be mad with jealousy&mdash; "</p>

  <p>"Marcia, is it possible for you to be serious?"</p>

  <p>He was pale with suppressed passion, and, as he spoke, he stepped forward
  and laid his hand upon her wrist.</p>

  <p>She sprang back and half raised a light staff she carried, while her face
  flushed crimson.</p>

  <p>"I will be more serious than will please you," she said, "if you please me
  as little as you do now. Learn, I am not your wife that you should seek to
  restrain me, and it is quite possible that I never shall be."</p>

  <p>"You speak truly," he said; "it is quite possible that no woman shall be a
  new mother to the house of Fidenas&mdash;that our name shall die in me. So be
  it; and may the gods only avert the evils that threaten the Republic, nor
  look upon one of the race of the Trojan Segestes as an unworthy
  offering."</p>

  <p>Bending his head in respectful salutation, he turned toward the entrance
  hall.</p>

  <p>Marcia stood silent beside the fountain, and her face clouded with
  thought. The sound of her lover's footsteps grew fainter and fainter. She
  started forward as if to follow him. Then she stopped and listened. The noise
  of the street had drowned their echoes; the door had creaked twice on its
  pivots. He was gone. Then she called, "Lucius!" but there was no answer. Her
  eyes drooped with a little frown of regret, but in a moment she turned away
  laughing.</p>

  <p>"Never mind. He cannot do anything very desperate yet, and I will treat
  him better next time&mdash;perhaps."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap103"
     name="chap103">III. &mdash; PARTING</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE ensuing days were pregnant with rumour and action. The
  waves of terror and despair that lashed over the city, as blow after blow
  fell, had now receded. The white banner, that was always lowered at the
  approach of an enemy, still spread its undulating folds above Janiculum; the
  crops and fruit trees and vines smiled upon the hillsides; the flocks and
  herds browsed peacefully along the Campagna with never a Numidian pillager to
  disturb their serenity; and, amid all, there was no rumour of allied gates
  opened to receive the invader, no welcome from the Italians whom he had
  striven to conciliate. Courage returned, and with courage firmness, and with
  firmness confidence to endure and dare and do, so long as invaders presumed
  to set foot upon the heritage of Rome.</p>

  <p>How far this new confidence was born of the news that the Carthaginian was
  turning aside to the west, through Umbria and Picenum, how far by the rumour
  that Spoletum had closed her gates and repulsed his vanguard, or how far by
  wrath at the tales of ravage and the numberless murders of Roman citizens
  that marked his line of march, it would be difficult to apportion.</p>

  <p>However these, the city was now seething with energetic preparation. The
  Senate sat daily and into each night. No word of peace was uttered&mdash;all
  was war and revenge. Quintus Fabius Maximus was elected pro-dictator by a
  vote of the Comitia&mdash;not dictator, because that could only be done
  through appointment by the surviving consul, then absent in Gaul&mdash; or
  none knew where. By the same power, and in order to appease the commons
  irritated by criticisms of Flaminius, Marcus Minutius Rufus was elected
  master of the horse. Nor were the gods neglected. Their stimulating influence
  was invoked by the dictator to inspire the people with confidence, while he
  soothed them with the intimation that Flaminius had failed rather through
  overcourage and neglect of divine things than through mere plebeian temerity
  and ignorance. Fabius took care to impress it upon all that he himself would
  take full warning from the lesson. He moved that the Sibylline books should
  be consulted, and the Senate promptly acted upon the motion. These directed
  that a holy spring be proclaimed forthwith; that every animal fit for
  sacrifice, and born between the Kalends of March and May throughout all
  Italy, should be offered to Jupiter. Votive games were decided upon, couches
  were set by the judges, whereon the twelve gods should feast in splendour,
  temples were vowed, to Venus Erycina by the dictator himself, to Mens by
  Titus Otacilius, the praetor.</p>

  <p>But with all, and, as Fabius put it, that the immortal gods should not be
  overburdened with the petty affairs of mortals, every care that human
  prudence and warcraft could suggest was taken. Walls and towers were
  strengthened, and bridges were broken down; the inhabitants of open towns
  were driven into places of security, and their houses and crops destroyed.
  Amid all, the rumour came that Servilius was hastening back from Gaul; then,
  that he was close at hand, and, finally, Fabius set out to meet him, sending
  orders in advance that the consul should come without lictors, so that the
  dignity of the dictatorship might stand high before the people. And when
  Servilius had come, in all respects as commanded, then he, the consul, after
  first delivering up his legions which he had left at Ariminum, was ordered to
  Ostia and the fleet to keep watch and ward over the Italian coast and to
  protect the corn ships. So all the armies of the Republic went to the
  pro-dictator, together with authority to raise such more as he should
  consider needful; two new legions in the place of those dead on the shores of
  Trasimenus, and some thousands of poorer citizens from the tribes, to man the
  quinqueremes of Servilius and the walls of Rome.</p>

  <p>Amid these days of bustle and preparation, Sergius had found little
  difficulty in keeping his footsteps from Marcia's threshold. After the first
  grief of the conviction that she did not love him, pride came to his rescue.
  Should he, the head of the noblest house of the noble Sergian gens, should he
  abase himself and submit to scornful words even from a daughter of Torquatus?
  or, yet, should he, as a man, desire to bear the torch before an unwilling
  bride? These were simple questions, and there was but one word that could
  answer them; so Sergius struggled to put Marcia from his heart, until he
  flattered himself that the difficult task had at last been accomplished.</p>

  <p>During this internal struggle, there came, also, to help him, word that he
  had been named as one of the military tribunes in the new Fourth Legion, and,
  his wound being now almost well, he threw himself headlong into the work of
  the levy and of exercising his men, striving to bring them to such a degree
  of efficiency as might win honour for himself and advantage to the Republic.
  Now and again twinges of the old heart-pain would rack him, but he
  obstinately attributed all depression and melancholy to the inferior quality,
  both physically and socially, of many of the new levies, and to his
  misgivings as to the account they would render of themselves when confronted
  by the veterans of Hannibal.</p>

  <p>At last the day of marching arrived, and with it the greatest struggle of
  all. Suddenly a suspicion awoke within him, whispering that the task he had
  set for himself was but poorly done; that the image of Marcia still smiled
  unbanished above the altar of his heart; and, with all his pride and
  strength, this suspicion of his weakness was, oddly enough, a source of
  positive exultation. Caius had been with him through much of his work, for
  Caius served in the same legion. It was evident, however, that the young man
  had received strict orders on one subject; for, in all their talks, the name
  of Marcia never passed his lips. This was unlike Caius, who was thought by
  many to be given to overmuch speaking, and, for that reason, it irritated
  Sergius the more, who would sooner have cut away his hand than questioned his
  friend concerning his sister. Thus the two men, illogically but humanly
  enough, continued to grow apart, until, with never a thought but of
  friendliness, their intercourse became limited, through sheer embarrassment,
  to the commonplaces of fellow-soldiers who held light acquaintance with each
  other's names and faces.</p>

  <p>As the hour drew near, the city bubbled with excitement, and the altars of
  the gods reeked with unnumbered victims. Especially invoked were Castor,
  Fortune, Liberty, and Hope, but, above all, the mighty trinity of the
  Capitol. Lest the pang of so great a parting with men who were about to
  encounter such grave dangers might sap the courage of those remaining, and
  thence that of the new levies, the dictator had wisely decreed that the army
  should assemble at Tibur. So it happened that there was none to go now save
  himself and a small escort of cavalry, five turmae, at the head of which was
  Sergius. With these went Rome's last hope: the cast behind which lay only
  ruin, but for the averting favour of the gods.</p>

  <p>At midday the fasces would be carried forth, and it lacked but an hour of
  the time. Sergius had prepared everything; his men were ready to mount at the
  blast of the trumpet, and his household was set in order against the absence
  of its master. He was standing within the Viminal Gate, while an attendant
  held his horse close by and a little apart from the crowds of weeping women
  who surrounded the soldiers of the dictator's escort. Suddenly he felt some
  one pluck him by the cloak, and turned quickly to see a young woman in the
  single tunic of a slave. Her dress, however, was of finer texture than that
  worn by most of her class, and seemed to bespeak a rich mistress and especial
  favour. She stood with her finger to her lips, her eyes great with the
  importance of her mission.</p>

  <p>"My mistress, the Lady Marcia, orders that you come and bid her farewell,"
  she whispered hurriedly.</p>

  <p>Then she darted away among the crowd, before the young tribune could make
  answer to an invitation so oddly worded.</p>

  <p>His first impulse was to show the Lady Marcia that he was not to be
  dismissed and sent for&mdash;much less ordered back at the caprice of a girl.
  His next was to humour the whim of a child, and his third was to obey humbly
  and thankfully, without a thought but of Marcia's beauty and his own good
  fortune.</p>

  <p>A word to his slave and another to his horse, whereat the former loosed
  the bridle, and the latter knelt for his master. Then came a wild gallop
  across the crest of the Viminal Hill, through the ill-omened street where the
  wicked Tullia had driven over her father's corpse, into the Forum, and out up
  the New Way to the house of Torquatus.</p>

  <p>Throwing his rein to the porter, Sergius entered the court of the atrium,
  vacant and resounding to the hurried tread of his cothurni. Pausing for a
  moment and hesitating to penetrate farther into the house, he became aware
  that the porter had followed him. Like most of his class, he was a man
  considerably past middle life, and thus considered suited to the comparative
  ease and responsibility of his position. With a freedom and garrulity born of
  long service, he began:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It was a word I was commanded to deliver to the most noble Sergius, and I
  doubt not it would have been well and truly delivered, but for his springing
  from his horse so quickly and rushing past me. It is possible that I might
  have come to him sooner had he not left me to take care of the animal, and it
  needed time to summon the groom, whose duty such work is.
  Therefore&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"By Hercules, man, give me the message! Do you think I can listen all day
  to your gabbling?" cried the soldier, furious with impatience.</p>

  <p>A faint laugh seemed to come from somewhere beyond the hallway.</p>

  <p>"I was about to say, most noble lord," pursued the porter, hardly ruffled
  by the outburst; "and I trust you will pardon me if I dallied over-much;
  but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sergius raised his hand. Then, thinking better of the blow, he seized the
  man by the throat.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I can shake the words out like dice from a box. Now for the Venus
  cast!" he cried, suiting the action to the speech.</p>

  <p>"Are you making trial of your strength that you may break more readily
  into Carthaginian houses? Remember it is soldiers with whom you are to
  contend."</p>

  <p>Sergius turned quickly, to see Marcia herself standing at the entrance to
  the hall. In her eyes, on her lips, was malicious laughter; but a little red
  spot on either cheek seemed to tell of some stronger feeling behind. He had
  released the porter so quickly that the latter staggered back almost into the
  fountain, and Marcia smiled.</p>

  <p>"I think I have been taking a great deal of trouble for the sake of a very
  discourteous person," she said. "I sent Minutia to tell a certain soldier
  that I am willing to bid him farewell, despite his unworthiness, and he comes
  and nearly strangles poor old Rhetus for trying to say that I was awaiting
  him in the peristyle."</p>

  <p>"Rhetus' attempt was not very successful, and my time was short," said
  Sergius, growing alternately red and pale.</p>

  <p>"And so you thought to hasten his speech by closing his throat? Oh! you
  are a wise man&mdash;a very logical man. They should have made <i>you</i>
  dictator, so that you could save Italy by surrendering Rome."</p>

  <p>"Is it to say such things that you sent for me?" asked Sergius, after a
  pause during which he struggled against embarrassment and wrath.</p>

  <p>"Surely not, for how could I know that you were going to behave so
  outrageously? If you will follow me, we will go into the peristyle."</p>

  <p>She turned back through the passage, and Sergius followed, issuing a
  moment later into a large, cloister-like court, open in the middle, and
  decorated with flowers and shrubs. Four rows of columns, half plain, half
  fluted, supported the shed roof that protected the frescoes. These covered
  three of the walls. On the back was a garden scene so painted as to seem like
  a continuation of the court itself into the far distance; on the right was
  the combat between Aeneas and Turnus, and on the left a representation of the
  first Torquatus despoiling the slain Gaul of the trophy from which the family
  took its name.</p>

  <p>"And now I will tell you why I sent."</p>

  <p>She had seated herself in a marble chair with wolf heads carved on the
  arms, and her face had grown grave and thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"It was to tell you a dream&mdash;a dream of you that I had last
  night."</p>

  <p>Her cheek flushed, and Sergius' eyes sparkled.</p>

  <p>"You dreamt of <i>me</i>?" he said in a low voice. He half raised his arms
  and came nearer; but she held up one hand in the old imperious manner.</p>

  <p>"If you please, I have not sent for you that you should grow presumptuous,
  because I was unmaidenly enough to dream of so badly behaved a person as
  yourself. It&mdash;it was because it&mdash;I thought you should know, so that
  the omen might be expiated."</p>

  <p>Sergius had halted and was standing still. His lip curled slightly.</p>

  <p>"I dreamt," she went on, after a short pause, "that there was a wide plain
  with mountains about it and a river running through; and it was all heaped up
  with dead men&mdash; thousands upon thousands&mdash;stripped of arms and
  clothing, and the air was gray with vultures, and the wolves and foxes were
  calling to each other back among the hills. And I was very sad and walked
  daintily so that my sandals and gown might not be splashed with the blood
  that curdled in pools all about. Suddenly I came to a heap of slain whereon
  <i>you</i> were lying, with a long javelin through your body. So I screamed
  and awoke&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Surely, then, you felt sorrow," cried Sergius, who had followed the
  narrative with deep interest, but who seemed to consider nothing of it save
  the concern she had shown at his death.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I," she began; and then, as if angry with herself at the betrayal
  of feeling and of her embarrassment, she burst out; "I did not send, foolish
  one, that you should consider <i>me</i>. Look rather to yourself."</p>

  <p>But Sergius was full of the joy of his own thoughts.</p>

  <p>"That I shall do, my Marcia, by setting my mind upon things that are
  better than myself&mdash; the Republic&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah, but the omen?"</p>

  <p>"I shall put it aside together with the other: that you have called me
  back from the march; and I shall consider both well expiated by the knowledge
  that I am not as nothing to you."</p>

  <p>Her face grew pale, and she half rose from the chair.</p>

  <p>"Truly, I did not think about calling you back. It is terrible&mdash;all
  this&mdash; and it is my doing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then, if you wish, I shall lay it up against you," cried he, gayly,
  "unless you promise to be Caia in my house&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are unfair to press me now and by such means."</p>

  <p>"But it must be now," exclaimed the young man, springing forward and
  trying to catch her in his arms. "Do you not see I must leave you at once?
  Shall it be without a promise?"</p>

  <p>The blush had turned again to little anger spots, as she evaded him.</p>

  <p>"Very well," she said slowly. "I will be Caia where thou art
  Caius&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sergius' face shone with exultation, and his lips parted.</p>

  <p>"I will be Caia," she resumed, "upon the day when Orcus sends back the
  dead from Acheron."</p>

  <p>His expression of joy faded, and indignation took its place. Surely this
  was carrying light speech too far&mdash;and at such a time. Suddenly he
  realized that the dictator might already have ridden on, and disgrace have
  fallen upon a Sergius at the very beginning of the campaign.</p>

  <p>"So be it! I accept that omen&mdash;with the others," he cried sternly,
  and, turning, strode out through the atrium, bounded upon his horse, and
  dashed headlong down the street, before Marcia was fairly aware that he had
  gone from her presence.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap104"
     name="chap104">IV. &mdash; FABIUS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SERGIUS rode back to his men, deeply wounded in love and
  pride. He tried to excuse Marcia for her treatment of him, on the score of
  her youth and of youth's thoughtlessness; he blamed himself for his
  abruptness and his lack of knowledge of women&mdash;failings that had perhaps
  turned an impending victory into the defeat that now oppressed him. Worst of
  all, there was no hope to remedy his or her fault. A dangerous campaign lay
  before him, and the omens&mdash;but pshaw! <i>he</i> was not one of the
  rabble, to tremble at a flight of birds from the west or an ox with a bad
  liver. He had always admired the spirit of that old sceptic, Claudius, who
  had drowned the chickens off Drepana, though he admitted the faulty judgment
  in failing to realize the effect of such a defiance upon ignorant seamen and
  marines: the hierarchy was necessary for the State; if only to keep fools in
  order, but for a man of family and education&mdash;well, he smiled. It
  provoked him, amid all his disbelief, that he could not help preferring that
  those same omens had been more favourable. Pride, pride was his last and
  truest safeguard. He, a descendant of the companion of Aeneas, to fear the
  Carthaginian sword! he, a Roman noble, about to face death for his country,
  to waste his thoughts upon a silly girl who chose to flout him!</p>

  <p>Then the long clarions of the cavalry rang out, and the horsemen ran to
  their steeds. Down the slope of the Viminal rode the dictator: before him
  went the twenty-four axes, each in its bundle of staves, their bearers robed
  in military cloaks of purple cloth; behind came a small troop of illustrious
  Romans&mdash;his legati, his staff, nominated by him and sanctioned by the
  Senate for their fame and skill in war; also such senators as had elected, by
  way of personal compliment, to ride with the general and to partake as
  volunteers in whatever share of the war he might set for them.</p>

  <p>Quintus Fabius Maximus seemed a man just passing the prime of life. His
  figure, as he sat his horse, was squat rather than tall, though this
  appearance might be due, in a measure, to the great breadth of his shoulders;
  altogether his frame seemed one better adapted to feats of strength and
  endurance than for those of agility. The face, with its grizzled hair and
  beard, both cut short, suited well the figure that bore it. Dignity,
  firmness, and kindliness were in its strong and rugged outlines, with less,
  perhaps, of the pride of race and rank than might have been looked for in the
  head of the great family whose name he bore&mdash;he who was now twice
  dictator of the destinies of Rome. For dress, his purple cloak, similar to
  those of his lictors, hung loosely from his shoulders to below his knees,
  and, opening in front, disclosed a corselet of leather overlaid with metal
  across chest and abdomen, and embossed with bronze designs of ancient pattern
  and workmanship. The hem of the white tunic showed below the leathern
  pendants that hung a foot down from his girdle; the greaves were ornamented
  at the knees with lions' heads; an armour-bearer carried his master's bronze
  helmet with its crest of divergent red plumes.</p>

  <p>Such was the man upon whom Rome now depended for her saving&mdash;"for
  victory," dreamed such of the unthinking as had recovered from their terror;
  "for time, time, time," reasoned the man with the deep-set, gray eyes upon
  whom they had pinned their faith.</p>

  <p>Hardly a stride behind him rode Marcus Minucius Rufus, tall and well-
  built, with bold, coarse features and fierce, roving eyes. His red hair
  bristled from his brow, and he seemed to restrain with difficulty either his
  steed or himself from darting forward into the lead.</p>

  <p>"Yonder is the sword of the Republic," said one of Sergius' men, as the
  master-of-the-horse rode by the escort; but the man to whom he said
  it&mdash;an old soldier of the Spanish wars&mdash;only shrugged his
  shoulders. A moment later he grunted in reply:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Like enough; but it is a shield that the Republic needs most of all."</p>

  <p>Then the clarion summoned them to fall in behind the dictator's company,
  and the troop rode out from the gate&mdash;out into the broad
  plain&mdash;away from the protecting walls fluctuant with waving stoles, and
  from which tear-dimmed eyes strove to follow them among the villas, farms,
  and orchards of the country-side&mdash;away from the Forum, from the sacred
  fig tree and the black stone of Romulus&mdash;away from the divine triad that
  kept guard over the Capitol. Beyond lay the Alban Mountains, and, beyond
  these,&mdash;no one knew where,&mdash;the strange dangers that awaited them:
  fierce Spaniards with slender blades as red as the crimson borders of their
  white coats; wild Numidian riders that always fell upon the rear of Rome's
  battle; serried phalanges of Africans, veterans of fifty wars; naked Gauls
  with swords that lopped off a limb at every stroke; Balearic slingers whose
  bullets spattered one's brains over the ground; Cretans whose arrows could
  dent an aes at a hundred yards; and above all, over all, the great mind, the
  unswerving, unrelenting purpose that had blended all these elements into one
  terrible engine of destruction to move and smite and burn and ravage at the
  touch of a man's will.</p>

  <p>The cavalry rode two and two, thinking of such things; picked men,
  equipped in the new Greek fashion with breastplate, stout buckler, and strong
  spear pointed at both ends. What thoughts held the mind of the general, none
  could fathom. With head slightly inclined he seemed to study, now the ribbons
  woven in his horse's mane, now the small, sensitive ears that pricked
  backward and forward, as the Tiburtine Way flowed sluggishly beneath. As for
  Minucius, he alone seemed hopeful and unimpressed by the dangers that
  menaced. He glided here and there, reining his horse beside this senator or
  that lieutenant to utter a word of the safety assured to Rome and of the ruin
  that hung over the invader, or even calling back to the foremost of the
  escort some rough badinage upon their gloomy looks; for Minucius was a man of
  the people, scorning patrician pride of race, and wishing it known that,
  however high his rank, he held himself no whit better than any potter of the
  Aventine or weaver of the Suburra.</p>

  <p>So, riding, thinking, talking, they reached Tibur, where the new levies
  lay encamped.</p>

  <p>Thence began the march of the army&mdash;a long, weary march to strike the
  line of the Carthaginian devastators; and, as it rolled onward, the stream of
  war gathered volume. At Daunia they were joined by the legions of Servilius
  that had marched down from Ariminum; and, at every point, contingents of the
  allies poured in, until even the most timid began to believe it impossible
  that disaster could befall, and grew first confident, then defiant, then
  boastful.</p>

  <p>To the mind of the dictator himself, however, came no such change. He
  alone knew the danger, he alone knew the value of the force with which he
  must meet it&mdash; soldiers in whose minds, despite all their present
  spirit, lingered the tradition of defeat; raw levies not yet truly confident
  of their officers or themselves, however much the sight of their numbers and
  their brave show might blind them to the fact that there was another side to
  the war.</p>

  <p>And now rumours began to reach them of the enemy. He was at Praetutia, at
  Hadriana, at Marrucina, at Frentana! He had set out toward Iapygia! he had
  reached Luceria! and everywhere the country was a garden before him and a
  desert behind. Only one gleam of light shone through the darkness,&mdash;the
  Apulians submitted to ravage, but they refused to save their lands by joining
  fortunes with the invaders.</p>

  <p>At last came the day of trial. "The enemy was at hand." Scouts poured in
  with news of foraging parties, of masses of troops on the march; and at Aecae
  the dictator ordered the camp to be pitched and fortified in the order that
  Roman discipline prescribed, with rampart and ditch and stakes&mdash;a city
  in embryo.</p>

  <p>Now it was that the boasters must stand by their boasts.</p>

  <p>Scarcely had the morning broke, when the distant mist of the plain seemed
  to sparkle with myriads of glittering points&mdash;seemed to thicken and
  become dense with clouds of dust. Mingled noises came to the ears of the
  waking legions,&mdash;the neighing of horses, the inarticulate murmur of a
  multitude, the dull rumble of marching men, the ring of arms and
  accoutrements.</p>

  <p>Then came the order from the praetorium,&mdash;not to advance the
  standards, but to man the rampart and to repel. Such was not the custom of
  Rome&mdash;to refuse battle amid the ravaged lands of her allies. Had the
  heart of the dictator grown cold? Forthwith the pale cheeks of the boasters
  flushed again; lips that had been compressed, before the terrors they had so
  rashly invoked, parted in wonder and complaint; the mist rose, and the sun
  pierced through the settling dust. There stood the enemy, drawn up in order
  of battle across the plain, and waiting; too far away for the Romans to make
  out their form or equipment&mdash;just a long, dense array that seemed dark
  or light in spots. Now and again a trumpet rang out its distant note of
  defiance; now and again some portion of the line seemed to manoeuvre or
  change front, as if to tempt attack, while from time to time a flurry of
  horsemen&mdash; dark-skinned riders, bending low upon the necks of wiry
  little steeds and urging them with shrill, barbarous cries&mdash;swept almost
  up to the ditch, and brandished their darts, making obscene gestures and
  shouting words that brought the blood to the faces of the garrison, though
  they understood not the tongue that uttered them.</p>

  <p>A circle of officers surrounded the dictator's tent. Some were silent and
  shamefaced; some were vociferous of their desire to be allowed to go forth
  and fight, or, at least, to lead out the cavalry to chastise the insolence of
  slaves and barbarians; all were wondering and dissatisfied. Few, however,
  ventured to express their full thoughts. There was a something in the very
  mildness of the general that discouraged too direct criticism. Only Minucius,
  presuming, perhaps on his position of second in command, perhaps on his
  contempt for the great houses, sought the dictator's presence and spoke as if
  half to him, half to the company of officers. Even his first words but thinly
  veiled his feelings.</p>

  <p>"The enemy await us in line of battle, my master, but I do not see the red
  flag above your tent. Is it your will that the standards be advanced?"</p>

  <p>"No, Marcus, it is not my will, or the signal would have been displayed,"
  said Fabius, calmly.</p>

  <p>"The troops are eager to be led out; the enemy insult us up to the very
  ditch. Italy is wasted," went on Minucius; but, as if slightly cowed by the
  deep, gray eyes, his tone seemed less aggressive.</p>

  <p>Fabius paused a moment, before answering, and glanced around upon the
  lowering faces of legates and tribunes. Then he said:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It is proper, Quirites, that I should say something to you of my plans.
  Our men are new&mdash;untried. Those that have seen service have seen defeat.
  The enemy are flushed with victory, full of confidence in themselves and
  their general, well seasoned in battle. Has the Republic a new army if this
  be lost? But happily there is another side to the picture. We are in our own
  lands. Our supplies are inexhaustible; <i>we</i>receive; <i>they</i>must
  take. We shall wear them out in skirmishes, cut off their foragers&mdash;men
  whom they cannot replace, while we replace our losses daily and season
  ourselves in battle and grow to see that even Carthaginians are not
  immortal."</p>

  <p>There was a moment of silence. Then Minucius spoke again.</p>

  <p>"And, while we pursue this prudent policy, what becomes of the spirit of
  our men who see that their general dares not face the enemy? What becomes of
  the allies who see their fields wasted and cities burned, while Rome lies
  silent in her camps and offers no succour?"</p>

  <p>Fabius' brow clouded, but he spoke even more mildly than before.</p>

  <p>"There is much of truth in what you say Marcus; but I am convinced that
  there is less danger in such risks than in tempting the fate of Flaminius;
  and there are many compensations, together with certain victory in the
  end."</p>

  <p>And then the master-of-the-horse lost control of his temper; his voice
  rose, and he cried out:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You are general and you command, but you shall hear me when I say that I
  had rather have perished bravely with a Flaminius than live to conquer in
  such cowardly fashion with a Fabius."</p>

  <p>A murmur of half-uttered applause ran around the circle, but Fabius did
  not seem to hear it. He eyed his lieutenant calmly for an instant. Then he
  said:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You speak truth, Marcus, when you say that I am general;" and, turning
  his back upon Minucius, he passed through the line of officers, as they fell
  aside to give him way, and proceeded slowly toward the praetorian gate.</p>

  <p>Here, among the soldiers, discontent with the dictator's policy was as
  strong as it had been in the praetorium, while its expression was less
  governed by the amenities of rank. Roman discipline, however severe as to the
  acts of the legionary, put very few restrictions upon his speech; and the
  general, as he watched from the rampart the lines and movements of the enemy,
  heard many comments no less uncomplimentary than those of his
  master-of-the-horse, and couched in language almost as coarse as that of the
  Numidians themselves. It seemed as if the foul words of the barbarians were
  passed on thus to the man held responsible for Romans being compelled to
  listen to such insults.</p>

  <p>Curiously enough, the centurions and under officers appeared to be the
  only ones not hostile to Fabius' policy. These were silent or even made some
  efforts to restrain the ribaldry of their men.</p>

  <p>As for the general himself, no one could have appeared less conscious of
  the storm his orders had provoked. His eyes were still fixed upon the distant
  array, and when, as the sun almost touched the meridian, Lucius Sergius
  approached with despatches just arrived from Rome, he was compelled to speak
  twice before the other was aware of his presence. Then the dictator turned
  quickly, and, pointing to the Carthaginians, exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"See! they are withdrawing. Do you not note how thin the centre grows? Ah!
  I shall teach them new lessons of war&mdash;new lessons. They will find in me
  no Flaminius, to let my enemy choose the day and field of battle."</p>

  <p>Leaving the ramparts, they walked back toward the praetorium, Fabius
  breaking the seals and reading the letters as he walked. When they reached
  the tent, he stood still for a moment and seemed to study the face of the
  young tribune who had followed, a half pace behind, to receive any answer or
  order that might be forthcoming.</p>

  <p>"What is your opinion of my refusing battle?" he asked suddenly, after a
  short silence.</p>

  <p>Sergius turned crimson, but he answered quickly:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I have learned to trust in my general until such time as I know him to be
  unworthy of trust."</p>

  <p>Fabius smiled.</p>

  <p>"Some of your colleagues appear to have already arrived at the latter
  conclusion," he said. Then, after a pause, he went on: "After all, it is the
  judgment of the centurions that counts for most. Our legates and tribunes
  feel disgraced by our refusing a challenge; they may be sneered at for
  <i>that</i>, but who would blame <i>them</i> for the defeat that might follow
  its acceptance. The common soldier knows only his rage against the enemy,
  sees his comrades about him furious for battle, and comprehends nothing of
  its dangers. It is the centurions, our veterans, who realize the truth: the
  worth of their own men as measured against those of the enemy; nor are they
  puffed up with foolish pride of rank. You observe, sir, that the centurions
  are with me."</p>

  <p>Sergius bowed.</p>

  <p>"Now mark well what will happen," pursued Fabius. "Hannibal will retreat
  to his camp; he will break camp and march off during the night. He must have
  forage, and he cannot scatter his forces while I am near. He will escape, and
  I shall let him, rather than risk the army in a night battle; but I shall
  hang close as the father-wolf to the stag's haunch, keeping nevertheless to
  the high ground, where his cavalry cannot trouble me. There will be need of
  good horsemen who shall cling yet closer and advise me of his movements."</p>

  <p>Sergius' eyes flashed with eagerness, but he said nothing.</p>

  <p>"You will attend to this service," continued Fabius, not seeming to regard
  the young officer's exultation. "Take the other five turmae of your
  legion&mdash;not those of the escort. You must have light cavalry to cope
  with the Numidians, and your Greek horsemen are too heavily equipped.
  Assemble your men, watch the enemy, follow him when he marches tonight, cut
  off his stragglers, and send such words to me as you consider necessary. This
  shall be your reward for trusting greater things to your general."</p>

  <p>Turning, he entered the tent, before the tribune could express his
  thanks.</p>

  <p>Deeply impressed by the favour and confidence of the dictator, Sergius
  hurried away to his quarters, and, sending for Marcus Decius, the decurion
  who had told the news of Trasimenus to the crowd of the Forum, he directed
  him to see that the horses were fed and the men in readiness for a night
  march. Then he resigned himself to sleep and dreams of a certain pictured
  peristyle on the Palatine Hill,&mdash;a peristyle wherein a maid sat spinning
  by a fountain and thinking&mdash;of what? Perhaps of him&mdash;for he was
  only dreaming, and maidens do not always think as men dream.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap105"
     name="chap105">V. &mdash; TEMPTATION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE night was already far spent, and the Roman camp slept
  on, secure in all its grim array; silent, but for the tread of the patrols,
  as they paced the streets and exchanged the watchword, post with post, or but
  for the clang of sword upon greave, or shield against cuirass, as some sentry
  at gate, rampart or praetorium shifted his arms in weary waiting for the
  day.</p>

  <p>Far up in the heavens the moon shone silvery and serene, while here and
  there upon the plain below swaying points of light seemed to move, flicker,
  go out, and rekindle again. No Roman watcher but knew well that play of
  moonlight upon the heads of the reedlike spears with which the ancient
  cavalry of the legion were equipped&mdash;weapons which, together with their
  ox-hide bucklers, were being gradually superseded by the heavier Greek
  accoutrements. Yes, and had not the word passed from the guard at the
  praetorian gate, how a tribune and five turmae of the fourth legion had
  ridden out on the service of the dictator?</p>

  <p>Earlier in the night, those who listened closely had heard a low hum that
  seemed to pervade the air, rising and falling like the dull glow in the west
  that told of the fluctuant watch-fires of the hostile camp. Now the noises
  had died away, as in the distance, and the light that had flashed up a few
  hours since hardly tinted the clouds. It is only the old soldier who can read
  the signs of a decamping foe, who knows how the fagots must be heaped at the
  moment of departure, so that the deserted fires may burn until the morning,
  whose quick ear catches and recognizes the indefinite noises of a host moving
  in secret. All these things were, and old campaigners among the legionaries
  at the gate had read them aright. Messenger after messenger hurried to the
  praetorium, and returned with word that the dictator slept, "having taken all
  needed measures," and how the master-of-the-horse paced up and down before
  his tent, grinding his teeth, clenching his hands, and muttering curses upon
  patrician cowardice and imbecility.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Lucius Sergius rode on through the night, with Marcus Decius at
  his side, and the troop of horse trailing out across the plain behind
  them.</p>

  <p>"It is silent, master," said the decurion, but his attitude, as he leaned
  forward over his horse's neck, was rather of one trying to smell than to
  listen. "The pulse-eaters sleep deeply." He watched Sergius from under
  half-closed lids, waiting to be contradicted, that he might measure his
  officer's warcraft.</p>

  <p>Sergius smiled. "Perhaps they are even wider awake than ourselves," he
  said, drawing rein. Then, as the other nodded several times in satisfied
  acquiescence, he brought his horse to his haunches a stride beyond, and
  added: "It was the dictator who said we should find their lair empty, and,
  though I do not question his judgment, it will be well to send on a few who
  shall spy out the fact, and see whether there be not Numidians lurking among
  the huts."</p>

  <p>So, slowly and cautiously, they pushed forward again, with riders in
  advance, until a shout gave notice that the way was indeed clear, and they
  rode through the open gate of the rampart and along the silent street of the
  deserted camp.</p>

  <p>Nothing was about them save dismantled huts, for the most part mere
  burrows with roofs of interlaced boughs that were now smoking amid the ashes
  of the fires. Not a sign of disorder, nor even of the rapidity with which so
  great an army had been moved; not a scale of armour left behind&mdash;only
  the insufferable stench of a barbarian camp, of offal and refuse piled or
  scattered about, of dead beasts and of dead men&mdash;the sick and wounded
  who had yielded to sword or disease during the last few days.</p>

  <p>It was with a sense of relief that the cavalcade emerged from the shadows
  of the huts and began to mount the rising ground beyond. The moon, too, had
  grown faint, and the gray mists of the morning were lying along the lower
  levels. Sounds, mingled and far ahead, told of the presence of a marching
  host, and Sergius led his troop on a more oblique course to gain the flank of
  the foe and lessen the chances of detection and ambuscade.</p>

  <p>It was not stirring work for a soldier&mdash;the days that followed; never
  attacking, always guarding against discovery and surprise, viewing slaughter
  and devastation that duty and weakness alike made him powerless to prevent or
  punish, sending courier after courier to his general to tell of the enemies'
  march or of stragglers and foragers to be crushed in the jaws of the army
  that enveloped the invader's rear. Thus the war passed through Apulia, over
  the Apennines, down into the old Samnite lands, past Beneventum that closed
  its gates and mourned over its devastated fields, on across the Volturnus,
  descending at last into the Falernian plain, the glory of Campania, the
  Paradise of Italian wealth and luxury.</p>

  <p>During all these days Sergius had grown thinner and browner. Little
  furrows had been ploughed between the eyes that must pierce every ridge and
  thicket for the glint of javelins and the wild faces of the bridleless riders
  of the desert. From time to time news of devastators cut to pieces brought a
  fierce joy to his heart; from time to time he dreamt he saw the eagles of the
  Republic hovering upon the heights above, ready to stoop and strike and save
  the allied lands from trials greater than they could bear; but of Marcia,
  scarce a waking thought. Surely the man he now was had never reclined in
  peaceful halls where women plied the distaff and talked about love, and of
  how Rabuleius, the perfume-maker of the Suburra, had just received a new
  essence from Arabia! That old life was all a dream, perhaps the memory of a
  former existence, as the sage of Croton had taught. There was nothing real in
  the world, in these days, but fear and suffering and humiliation and revenge.
  Even duty had become a mere habit that should minister to greater
  influences.</p>

  <p>And now it was worst of all. Campania was a conflagration from which rose
  supplications and shrieks and groans, mingled with curses against the
  cowardly ally that had left her to her fate. Still the legions held to the
  high ground, and still the black pest of Numidia swept hither and thither on
  its errand of murder and rapine. Even to Sergius the plans of the dictator
  began to seem but "coined lead," as Marcus Decius roughly put it. Of what
  avail was it that the pass at Tarracina was blocked, that he had garrisoned
  Casilinum in the enemies' rear and Cales upon the Latin Way, and that the sea
  and the Volturnus and the steep hills with their guarded passes seemed to
  complete the line of circumvallation? Could such bonds hold one so wise as
  Hannibal from the rich cities of the plain? Unless Rome would advance her
  standards, were not Sinuessa and Cumae, Puteoli and Neapolis, Nuceria and
  Teanum, and, above all, Capua, left to fight their own battle against
  barbarian insolence and barbarian power? What hope to starve out an enemy
  established in such a region and amid such affluence!</p>

  <p>Then, too, there was less work now for Sergius, even such as it was. The
  enemy, wheresoever he marched, was well in view from a dozen points held by
  the dictator, and at last word came to the tribune that he should join the
  camp near Casilinum. There, at least, he would have companionship in shame,
  instead of seeming to command men and being unwilling to lead them to fight
  for lands which the gods themselves had deemed worthy of their
  contention.</p>

  <p>They were near Cales when the orders were brought. Could it be the
  dictator's intention to give battle and avenge what he had failed to save? By
  midday they were mounted and threading the forest paths that led to their
  comrades&mdash;paths whence, from time to time, some vista in the woods
  disclosed the plain below, with here and there a column of smoke that made
  Sergius grind his teeth and clench his hands in impotent rage. Suddenly he
  drew rein, for a man, dressed in the coarse, gray tunic of a slave, had half
  run, half stumbled across his way. An instant more, and the fellow was
  struggling in the grasp of Decius, who had sprung to the ground.</p>

  <p>"What now, forkbearer! what now, delight of the scourges!" cried the
  decurion. "Will you delay the march of a tribune of the Republic?"</p>

  <p>"Pity me, master, pity me and let me go!" cried the man, still striving
  vainly to escape. "Surely they are close behind me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who are behind you?" asked Sergius, sternly. "Speak and lie not, food for
  Acheron!"</p>

  <p>"They who are burning the farm."</p>

  <p>Sergius' eyes glittered, and he leaned forward to catch the words, as he
  began to gather their import.</p>

  <p>"Speak quickly, and you shall be safe," he said, in more reassuring tones.
  "Whose farm is it that is burning? Loose him, Marcus."</p>

  <p>Released from the hands that held him, the fugitive seemed to waver for a
  moment between speech and flight. Perhaps exhaustion turned the balance, for,
  still panting for breath, he threw himself on his knees before Sergius'
  bridle and gasped:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"My master's farm&mdash;a veteran of the first war&mdash;a
  centurion&mdash;the Numidians."</p>

  <p>"Where is it? How many are there?"</p>

  <p>The man pointed down the slope up which he had scrambled.</p>

  <p>"I did not note their numbers, lord. Perhaps a hundred&mdash;perhaps
  more."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the sky began to brighten as with fire, and Sergius, wheeling
  his horse, urged him downward toward the plain. Decius was by his side in an
  instant, and behind them came the cavalry at a speed that threatened to hurl
  them headlong to the foot of the rocky declivity. Joy and fury shone on the
  faces of the men: only Marcus Decius seemed troubled and abstracted.</p>

  <p>"We shall be with them soon, my Marcus," cried Sergius, gayly, and then,
  noting the furrowed face of his first decurion: "Surely, Trasimenus has not
  cooled your heart. Take courage. There is no water here to chill you."</p>

  <p>Decius flushed through the deep bronze of his skin.</p>

  <p>"It is true that there is no water here, and blows might warm my blood. It
  was the command of the dictator that I thought of."</p>

  <p>They had reached the level plain now. A cluster of burning buildings
  hardly a mile ahead marked their goal.</p>

  <p>"And it is you, Marcus, who have been railing at those same commands?"</p>

  <p>"I am an old soldier, my master. I growl, but I obey."</p>

  <p>For answer, Sergius urged on his horse with knee and thong. Now they could
  distinguish dark shapes gliding hither and thither around the fires, and now
  they burst in upon a scene as of the orgies of demons.</p>

  <p>Utterly unsuspicious of danger, the marauders had taken no precautions.
  Their wiry, little horses had been turned loose about the gardens, while the
  riders murdered and pillaged and ravished and destroyed. The worst was over
  now. Little remained of the buildings, save clay walls covered with plaster;
  dead bodies were scattered here and there; the women and such of the slaves
  as had not been slaughtered, together with the farm stock and other things of
  value, were gathered beyond the reach of the fires; while, bound high upon a
  rude cross before his own threshold, the master of the farm writhed amid
  flames that shot upward to lick his hands and face.</p>

  <p>Then, in an instant, the scene was changed: the Roman horsemen burst in,
  and, frenzied by the spectacle before them, slew madly and fast. Hither and
  thither they swept, wherever the dusky figures sought to fly, and the thin,
  reed-like lances rose and plunged and rose again, shivering and dripping,
  from the bodies of their victims. But for their well-trained steeds, who came
  and knelt at their masters' calls, not one of the desert horsemen could have
  escaped, and, as it was, a mere dozen broke out from the carnage and scurried
  away, with the avengers in close and relentless pursuit. Marcus Decius paused
  a moment before the cross and studied the torn frame and blackened skin of
  the man who hung there. Then, with a swift movement of his lance, he
  transfixed the quivering body, and, hardly catching the "Jove bless thee,
  comrade," and the sigh with which life escaped, he dashed on after the
  pursuing squadrons.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap106"
     name="chap106">VI. &mdash; DISOBEDIENCE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THAT the chase was doomed to be a vain one seemed apparent.
  Once mounted and urging on their steeds with the shrill, barbaric cries of
  the desert, Hannibal's light horsemen were safe from all ordinary pursuit.
  One after another of the Romans drew up his panting animal, and scarce half
  of their turmae pounded on.</p>

  <p>Suddenly they saw the flying Numidians throw their horses upon their
  haunches. A moment of indecision followed, and then, while several darted off
  obliquely, the remainder, seven or eight in all, swung around and charged
  straight at the legionaries. At their head rode a giant, black as ebony save
  where gouts of red had splashed him with the hue of terror. His frizzly hair
  was caught up high and ornamented with a cluster of ostrich feathers, while
  with his right hand he drew javelin after javelin from the sheaf he carried
  in his left, and launched them with unerring aim at his former pursuers.
  Three had flown on their errands, two had brought down a soldier each, and
  the third quivered in the throat of Sergius' horse. Then, as the animal
  reared and went over, carrying his rider with him, the assailant burst
  through the line, and in a moment had gained the open plain beyond. Once more
  he was safe, safe but for one short, thick-set rider,&mdash;Marcus Decius,
  first decurion of the first turma, hastening to overtake his troop.</p>

  <p>Escape from such a pursuer was child's play for the Numidian; but the fury
  of fight was on him, and, gnashing his white teeth, from which the thick,
  black lips seemed to writhe away, he bent low amid his horse's mane and, with
  an inarticulate cry, urged him straight at the veteran. His javelins had all
  been expended in breaking through the Roman line, and a short, heavy dagger
  was his only weapon. Nothing daunted, he came on, evaded like a flash the
  thrust of Decius' spear, and hurled himself upon him. It was the small
  buckler of the Roman that saved his life; the dagger passed through the
  ox-hide, slightly gashing his arm, and, before the barbarian could withdraw
  it, the impact of the horses in full career had sent both men and animals to
  the plain in a floundering heap. Again the Numidian was quicker, and, gaining
  his feet, he sprang, weaponless as he was, upon the decurion still struggling
  to untangle himself from his fallen horse. The buckler, with the African's
  knife thrust through it, had rolled away, and the possession of Decius'
  sword, which hung in its sheath upon his right thigh, became the object of
  the struggle. Perhaps the strength of the men was not very unequal; but the
  Roman, hardly free from his mount, was undermost and wounded, so that the
  result seemed hardly doubtful. The Numidian's charger had risen to its feet,
  and stood, with out-stretched neck, whinnying softly, as if sharing in the
  excitement of the contest. Then the trampling of hoofs sounded in the ears of
  the straining combatants. Decius felt his adversary make a convulsive effort
  as if to free himself, and then a gush of something warm came into the
  Roman's face, and his foe sank down upon him, limp and helpless. With a last
  effort of his spent strength, he pushed the twitching body aside, and,
  staggering to his feet, saw Sergius standing beside him, with a dripping
  sword in his hand, and the bridle of Titus Icilius', the flag-bearer's,
  horse thrown over his left arm.</p>

  <p>Remounting, they rode slowly back to their troop, and then the cause of
  the strange boldness of the fugitives was disclosed. Advancing across the
  plain directly in the path of their flight came four hundred of the allied
  cavalry, whom the dictator had sent out to reconnoitre, and, caught thus
  between two lines, the Numidians had, for the most part, chosen to take their
  chances against the weaker force. Not one of the marauders was alive, but
  they had sold their lives dearly; for a dozen of the Romans also were dead,
  and a score more showed wounds that marked this last spasm of barbarian
  frenzy.</p>

  <p>While the men talked together, Sergius sought the praefect of the new
  detachment, a Hostilian of the family of Mancinus, whom he recalled among the
  young hot-heads that formed the party of the master-of-the-horse, and
  declaimed against the policy of Fabius as cowardly and base. He found him in
  the best possible humour, laughing and making coarse jests amid a circle of
  decurions and optios&mdash;as rude a Roman as marched with the standards, yet
  able, when occasion demanded, to play the man of fashion who had spent a year
  at Athens. The latter mood fell upon him when he descried Sergius. He came
  forward to meet him.</p>

  <p>"Health to you, my Lucius!" he cried, "Surely the gods have held you in
  especial favour this day. I am told you have cut up a few squadrons of this
  African offal."</p>

  <p>"With your timely aid," replied Sergius, bowing.</p>

  <p>"I but made the hares double to your coursing," said Hostilius,
  carelessly; "and they tell me you have won both the spolia opima and a civic
  crown. That is a great deal for one day&mdash;and under a peaceful
  dictator."</p>

  <p>Sergius flushed.</p>

  <p>"I shall not claim them," he said. "Doubtless, Decius would have both
  slain the fellow and saved himself had I not come up&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No modesty! no modesty!" cried Hostilius, gayly. "I assure you it is even
  less Greek than Roman in these days. Lo! now, I myself will claim both for
  you at Rome, if only to show that I do not grudge you your share of the
  carrion. Perhaps such honours will not prejudice you in a certain house on
  the Palatine," he added, slyly. "But come! you and I shall join our forces
  and raid together. We have sent two hundred to Acheron since we left the
  camp, and birds have been singing on our left all the morning."</p>

  <p>"Where is the dictator now?" asked Sergius.</p>

  <p>"In his tent, of course," replied the other, scornfully. "And no one cares
  where that may be."</p>

  <p>"And you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! he was persuaded at last to risk a scouting party, and, at the
  request of the brave Minucius, he gave the command to me with strict
  injunctions to use only my eyes. Well, I have used them so sharply that my
  hands, too, have been full," and Hostilius laughed. "There are some five
  hundred of the cross-food that have evaded me thus far. We shall catch them
  now, though, and, together, it will be easy for us to prevail."</p>

  <p>Sergius was silent. To make a dash from the heights in defence of allies
  dying in his sight, was one thing; to deliberately join this insubordinate in
  turning a reconnaissance into a raid, was another and much more serious
  matter.</p>

  <p>The praefect noted his hesitation, and a slight frown chased the smile
  from his lips.</p>

  <p>"Or perhaps you prefer to obey the old woman's orders," he added, "and
  keep your couch warm. Well, our men and horses are fed by this time, and I am
  off. If you are a Roman, I greet you to ride with me; if you fear robbers or
  the axe that smote Titus Manlius, why, I will bid you farewell and ride
  alone."</p>

  <p>"Where do you set your course?" queried Sergius, with a vague hope of at
  least seeming to combine inclination with duty.</p>

  <p>"Toward the enemy," replied the other, shortly. "Does not the direction
  please you?" and he turned to his horse.</p>

  <p>Sergius' brow clouded. His blood was hot with the conflict just finished.
  Youth, courage&mdash;all combined to turn him from obedience; but obedience
  bade fair to conquer, when Marcia's laugh rang in his ears, and he could hear
  her gravely complimenting his prudence and discoursing on the rare value of
  docility in a husband. Besides, what did it all matter? Had he not said that
  he sought death? and, surely, the way it came soonest was the best.</p>

  <p>Placing his hand upon his horse's withers, he vaulted upon its back,
  before the animal had time to kneel, and a moment later was beside
  Hostilius.</p>

  <p>"By Hercules!" exclaimed the latter; "I am glad you are here. Even in
  these days of strange things, I would have found it difficult to imagine that
  a Sergian could be a coward."</p>

  <p>"And now," cried Sergius, "you will only have to imagine him a fool. So be
  it, and let the cost of his life pay for his folly."</p>

  <p>"Jupiter avert the omen!" exclaimed Hostilius, shuddering, and then,
  turning to his trumpeter, he bade him give the signal for the march.</p>

  <p>It was a desolate country&mdash;the fair plains of Campania through which
  they rode. Here and there a cluster of blackened ruins, here and there things
  that were once men, fruit trees cut down, vines uprooted, corn-fields reaped
  with the sword; while far away upon the horizon smoky columns curled up to
  show that the work of devastation still went on.</p>

  <p>"May Mavers curse him&mdash;curse him forever!" cried Hostilius, grinding
  his teeth in rage at each new manifestation of the enemy's handiwork. "Could
  the most disastrous battle be worse than this?"</p>

  <p>Sergius was silent. In a way his feelings went out to meet those of his
  companion; but the dictator had trusted him, and he had disobeyed, and, for
  all his disobedience, his soldier's instinct told him that the dictator was
  right.</p>

  <p>Hostilius eyed him sharply and suspiciously, as if trying to divine his
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>"If you regret&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a decurion of the allies dashed up beside them.</p>

  <p>"Look!" he cried, pointing toward the east. "There is carrion for the
  wolves."</p>

  <p>Both leaders turned at the words.</p>

  <p>Far out across the plain was what seemed at first sight like a clump of
  dark foliage, save that it moved and changed shape too much.</p>

  <p>"Numidians!" exclaimed the decurion, following his finger with his speech,
  while the veins in Hostilius' forehead began to swell and grow dark.</p>

  <p>"The signal! Let it be given," he cried to his officer, and, turning, he
  dug his knees into his horse's sides and galloped toward the distant quarry.
  A moment later the cavalry wheeled at the trumpet call, and, in some disorder
  but full of eagerness, began the pursuit of their leader.</p>

  <p>As for Sergius, he, too, gave order and rein, though more deliberately,
  and his troop followed the cavalry of the allies in somewhat better array. By
  his side galloped Decius with an expression hard to analyze upon his
  weather-beaten face.</p>

  <p>Sergius glanced at the old soldier from time to time with a look of
  inquiry and concern. At last he ventured to question his grim mentor.</p>

  <p>"Is it well or ill, Marcus?"</p>

  <p>"Ill for you that command, well for me who obey," growled the other, and
  Sergius flushed and was silent.</p>

  <p>"Shall we catch them?" he asked, a few moments later, for the clump of
  Numidians, who had sat motionless upon their horses until the Romans covered
  half the intervening distance, had now wheeled for flight.</p>

  <p>"If they be too strong for us, we shall catch them," replied Decius. "It
  is as they will."</p>

  <p>And now it became apparent that the marauders were far inferior in numbers
  to the assailants, and that they recognized the fact; for flight and pursuit
  began in earnest. Horses were urged to higher speed. At one moment the
  Numidians seemed to be holding their distance; at another, the Romans gained
  slightly but unmistakably. All order of detachments and turmae was soon lost;
  Romans and allies, officers and men, were mingled together in a straggling
  mass, with naught but the eagerness of the riders and the speed of their
  animals to marshal them. Only Decius continued to pound along, with his
  horse's nose at his tribune's elbow. The thunder of many hundred hoofs rolled
  across the plain.</p>

  <p>"By Hercules! we shall do it!" cried Sergius, in whom ardour of the chase
  had put to flight all sentiments of regret or doubt. "Do you not see we are
  gaining?"</p>

  <p>"They ride silently yet," said Decius. "It is but knee-speed with them.
  Wait till they cry out to their horses, and we shall see."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, as if to supplement the words, a single shrill cry, half
  whistle, half scream, rose up ahead. Had they been closer, they might have
  noted the pricking ears of the desert steeds; but this much they
  saw:&mdash;one horse and rider darting out of the press, like arrow from bow,
  and scurrying away over the plain as if their former gait had been but a
  hand-gallop.</p>

  <p>An instant of misgiving came to some few of the Romans, who were not blind
  to everything but the excitement of the moment, but they, like the rest, only
  plied knee and thong the harder, and the episode of the single rider was
  forgotten by all save Marcus Decius and Sergius.</p>

  <p>"It is a trap, master," said the former, with an inquiring glance at his
  leader.</p>

  <p>Sergius bowed his head, and his face was troubled, as he
  replied:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I know it, my Marcus, but we cannot turn back now. I have accepted the
  feast: therefore I must recline until my host gives the signal to rise. I
  pray you pardon me."</p>

  <p>By a quick movement Decius urged his horse a stride ahead of the
  tribune's, that he might the better hide his emotion; at the same time
  growling:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I pardon you?&mdash;and for the chance of a blow at the scum? I thank you
  many times."</p>

  <p>And now, from the plain ahead rose a low range of rolling hills over which
  a light cloud seemed to hover. Was it the ascent that wearied the horses of
  the Numidians? Surely the space between pursuers and pursued was lessening
  rapidly, and Hostilius leaned far forward, shaking his spear and calling upon
  his men for a renewed effort.</p>

  <p>"Now! now!" he cried. "See! they are spent! Up with them ere they top the
  hill!"</p>

  <p>But the Numidians gained the sought-for ridge, if only by a few
  spear-lengths' lead, and the cloud, now close ahead, hung so dense that there
  were those who thought it the smoke of another farm. Decius' eyes seemed set
  in a dazed stare. There was too much red in that cloud, and yet it was not
  the red of fire, and it was too light and too thin for smoke. He knew it; he
  had known it all along, but what did it matter? The last Numidian had
  disappeared down the opposite slope&mdash;no! surely they had turned again,
  and in a longer line&mdash;a thicker one; and the light javelins and naked
  black bodies had become long, stout spears and glittering corselets, while at
  their head rode a slender man with forked beard, and his black eyes seemed to
  burn in his head like coals. So, with one barbaric roar, the whole array
  poured down over the allied cavalry, and these were like the dust of the
  trampled field.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap107"
     name="chap107">VII. &mdash; PUNISHMENT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SERGIUS hardly knew what was happening. He was conscious
  that the stride of his horse had been checked by a dense mass of plunging
  animals in front&mdash;a mass that grew more dense and more tangled with
  every instant. Those behind were still endeavouring to press forward, and
  those in front were hurled back upon them or were striving frantically to
  break through the rearmost squadrons and escape; while, shrill above the
  clash of arms and the shouts and screams, rose a name that Sergius found
  himself listening to with a sort of curious interest.</p>

  <p>"Maharbal! Maharbal!" came the cry, nearer and nearer.</p>

  <p>At the first moment of the check, Marcus Decius had pushed the sturdy
  horse that he rode well to the fore. He saw Hostilius riding back, waving one
  arm and crying out incoherent words: his spear was gone, and the head of a
  Spaniard's lance had been thrust through his shoulder and broken off, so that
  a third of the shaft hung from the wound.</p>

  <p>Then what had happened and the hopelessness of it all became apparent.
  Like the veriest fools they had ridden into the snare, and Maharbal, the
  Carthaginian, with at least two thousand Spanish and African horsemen, was
  thundering on their front and flanks: their front&mdash;but in a moment,
  their rear; for now those who had not been ridden down at the first onset or
  become inextricably entangled with their fellows broke away over the plain,
  carrying their officers with them in a mad frenzy of flight; while other
  Numidians&mdash;fresh riders on fresh steeds&mdash;urged the pursuit and
  smote down the hindermost.</p>

  <p>Decius found himself riding in the middle of the press. His face was as
  imperturbable as ever, though he glanced over his shoulder from time to time
  as if to note how much nearer death had come. Sergius galloped close behind
  him, careless and abstracted, his rein lying loose on his charger's steaming
  neck. Then, of a sudden, a resolve seemed to come to him. Straightening
  himself, he urged the weary horse forward through the fugitives till he drew
  up even with Hostilius, who, still frantic with panic, was now swaying in his
  saddle from the pain and loss of blood.</p>

  <p>Sergius leaned over and laid his hand upon the other's arm, and Hostilius
  started as if he had touched a serpent. Then he became calmer, and a troubled
  look was in the eyes that sought the tribune's face.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," he said at last, speaking hurriedly and in odd, strained
  accents. "I led you into it, and now I am flying."</p>

  <p>"Let us turn back," said Sergius, mildly. "I do not reproach you, but let
  us turn back. Surely it is better than the rods and axe."</p>

  <p>Hostilius shuddered, and, at that moment, Decius, who had overtaken them,
  broke in with:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"By Hercules! there is no fear of those. They cut us down in flight. The
  choice is, shall we have it in the face or between the shoulders."</p>

  <p>"By the gods of Rome, then!" shouted the praefect, suddenly reining up,
  while Sergius and Decius swung their horses in short circles.</p>

  <p>There was no trumpet to give the signal, and the little cavalry banner had
  gone down long ago; but such was the force of Roman training that nearly all
  of Sergius' men and half of the allies turned in mid-panic with their
  leaders. To make head, much less to form was impossible, for the foremost of
  the enemy were well mingled with the rearmost fugitives. As Decius had said,
  it was only a choice of deaths: the one swift and honourable, the other more
  lingering, but none the less inevitable.</p>

  <p>Almost in a moment it was over. Between two and three hundred of the
  united detachments had fallen already, and the hundred or so that now sought
  to face about, went down in a crushed and bleeding mass under the thousands
  of hoofs that overwhelmed them. Such was the weight and impetus of the
  pursuing force that there was no time even to strike, and most of the victims
  fell unwounded by spear or javelin. Sergius was vaguely conscious that he had
  seen the praefect cloven through the head by the short, swordlike Numidian
  knife, his own horse seemed to collapse under him, and that was the end.</p>

  <p>Then he knew that it was dark and cold and that there was a howling in the
  air, as of beasts of prey, and the shadow of a man fell across him, for the
  moon was in the heavens, and the man was cursing by all the gods of the
  Capitol.</p>

  <p>Gradually consciousness returned, and he recalled, incident by incident,
  the happenings of the past day. He had been lying still, thus far, without
  further wish than to look up at the stars and think and listen to what he now
  knew was the distant howling of wolves and the nearer curses of Marcus
  Decius. At last he stirred slightly, and the decurion turned and looked
  down.</p>

  <p>"Do you live, master?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, truly," replied Sergius; "unless you chance to be a shade."</p>

  <p>Then he struggled to his feet, and the two gazed silently at each other
  and around them. All about, in the moonlight, lay the bodies of horses and
  men, the latter glittering in their white tunics, save here and there an
  officer whose helmet and breastplate had seemed to mark out his corpse for
  stripping and nameless desecrations. Sergius' head-piece was gone, but he
  glanced at his own corselet and then at Decius.</p>

  <p>"We were buried together under a heap of dead," said the latter, in answer
  to the unasked query. "They made haste in their spoiling; and, when they had
  gone, I drew myself free and found you: the wolves are feasting well
  to-night; can you walk?"</p>

  <p>Sergius moved stiffly a few steps. He felt bruised from head to foot, and
  one arm hung useless from a dislocated shoulder, but he found no wound.
  Decius had not escaped so lightly. Besides the gash he had received earlier
  in the day, he had been cut again across the forehead, but his prodigious
  strength seemed to have inexhaustible resources to draw upon.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said. "We must go southward as quickly as possible. Sergius
  still walked slowly about, glancing at one corpse after another, until the
  decurion, at last divining his thought, broke in roughly:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Come! The wolves must provide him sepulchre as they will do for better
  men. What would he have? The she-wolf suckled the twins. Let Hostilius pay
  the debt by feeding the she-wolf's cubs. By Hercules! other sepulchre for him
  means need of one for ourselves."</p>

  <p>So speaking, he at last drew Sergius away, and they began their weary
  tramp across the field.</p>

  <p>"If I could have seen but one pulse-eater among the slain," said the
  tribune, after they had gone some distance in silence.</p>

  <p>"I know of one that should be dead," remarked Decius, grimly, "if a spear
  through his midriff be enough for him. Truly the ancient shafts are useless
  in close fight, save for a single thrust. I, for one, welcome the Greek
  equipment&mdash;and the sooner the better."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Sergius stopped and laid his hand upon his comrade's arm.</p>

  <p>"Look!" he said.</p>

  <p>A long, low rampart seemed to rise up from the plain two hundred yards
  ahead.</p>

  <p>"Their camp," said the decurion, after a short pause, "and deserted. Let
  us go forward cautiously; perhaps we shall find food."</p>

  <p>Step by step they crept up, walking faster and more erect as they drew
  nearer and as the evidence that life was not there became more apparent.</p>

  <p>"They have left it only to-night," said Decius, clambering up the mound of
  earth and sniffing the air. "Had it been a day old, we should have smelt it
  long ago, though the wind blows from us."</p>

  <p>Then, as they descended and traversed the silent lanes, a puzzled
  expression came to his face, and he halted from time to time.</p>

  <p>Sergius eyed him inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"Do you not smell fresh blood?" said the veteran, at last. "I remember
  when we marched with Lucius Aemilius, after the Gauls had beaten the
  praetor's army at Clusium. There were ten thousand men just slain, and the
  air was salt like the sea&mdash;by Jupiter! What is this?"</p>

  <p>Resuming their advance, they had come upon a space of open ground near the
  centre of the camp, doubtless the spot reserved for a market; but what meat
  was it that cumbered the shambles, without buyer or seller? Piled in ghastly
  heaps, or covering the ground two and three deep, lay a fresh-reaped harvest
  of corpses, stripped, distorted, gleaming in the moonlight. Could it be that
  the camp had been taken? But these were no African dead, nor yet was this a
  Roman camp. There was a set deliberation, too, about the slaughter, that told
  no tale of battle.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Decius cried out and, stooping down, raised the hands of one of
  the victims&mdash; hands upon which the shackles still hung.</p>

  <p>"Slaves," murmured Sergius; "but why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Say, rather, prisoners," said the centurion, grimly.</p>

  <p>Sergius struck his thigh. It was all clear to him now.</p>

  <p>"May the plague fall upon him! may he go to a thousand crosses! Do you not
  see? He is <i>escaping</i>. He has made for the passes and slain his
  prisoners, that they may not hamper his march. Who knows but that by now he
  is on the road to Rome? Gods! This was Hostilius' duty and mine, and we
  wasted our time and our men on a few score of miserable Numidians. Come, my
  Marcus, come: there are no such things as wounds or weariness or caution. We
  must reach the dictator at once, and may the gods grant that it be not too
  late!"</p>

  <p>Marcus Decius had been gazing gloomily at the young man, as the words
  burst from his lips.</p>

  <p>"Where shall we go, and how?" he said, with a despairing gesture.</p>

  <p>"On our feet," cried Sergius. "Did I not say that weariness and wounds
  were not? It is for the life of the Republic: I to the camp near Casilinum;
  you to Tarracina. They will march by the Appian or by the Latin Way, if they
  strike for Rome. If not, the plan may not be fatal."</p>

  <p>Decius yielded to the decision of his companion, and, with hasty fingers,
  they unlaced each other's corselets and hurried out of the camp, each to run
  his race with what strength remained. The last clasp of hands had been given
  and received, when, far away on the hills east and northeast, the quick eye
  of Sergius caught the gleam of a rapidly moving torch: then another and
  another and another seemed to flame out in the night, like stars when the
  moon has failed, until the whole range of heights blazed with fires that
  flashed and danced and crossed and recrossed each other in mad confusion, as
  if all the thronging bacchanals of Greece had assembled for one frenzied
  orgy.</p>

  <p>Dazed and confounded by the spectacle, as grand as it was weird and
  unexplainable, they stood spell-bound, powerless each to take the first
  stride. Decius, the older man, the veteran, turned to his companion, yielding
  that unconscious homage to birth and rank and education, that comes in the
  presence of unknown perils. No experience of war could help him here, and his
  mind leaped at once to the supernatural for an explanation. As for the
  tribune, such thoughts, at least, had not occurred to him. Greek scepticism
  had already gained too strong a hold upon young Romans of rank, to let them
  regard the theology of the State other than as a machinery devised by wise
  men to control an ignorant rabble. Besides, his mind had taken another
  direction from the discovery of the slaughter of the prisoners, and,
  humanlike, it ran on in its channel, right or wrong.</p>

  <p>Decius was trembling violently.</p>

  <p>"Truly, master, the gods of Carthage are loose to-night," said he.</p>

  <p>There was even a little of contempt in the glance with which Sergius noted
  the abject terror of the sturdy veteran. Utterly at a loss to explain the
  apparitions, he never doubted for a moment but that they were the product of
  some human wile.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said shortly. "The gods of Carthage have favoured us in
  lighting the way. First of all, we shall go together and learn the truth."
  Without waiting for a reply, he set off, at an easy, loping gait, in the
  direction of the strange fires. Decius followed, as he would have followed
  through the portals of Avernus.</p>

  <p>The distance to the heights was not great,&mdash;four or five miles at the
  utmost,&mdash; but half an hour had passed, and still the spectacle, wilder
  and more brilliant than ever, remained unexplained. For a stretch of miles,
  the hills above, beyond, and below were all ablaze with rushing flames that
  seemed guided by no sentient agency; then, suddenly, a single torch glanced
  out from a small grove of trees a short distance ahead and darted diagonally
  across their path. Decius stopped for an instant, with trembling knees; but
  Sergius bounded forward to intercept the torch-bearer, and the veteran
  followed from sheer shame.</p>

  <p>Up, down to the ground, up again, and then around in frantic waving
  circles swept the flame: a mad bellowing rolled through the night, until the
  tribune himself almost checked his stride in awe-struck wonder. The next
  instant the torch, if torch it was, seemed to flounder to the earth, from
  which it rose again and came driving directly toward him, explained at
  last,&mdash;an ox with a great bundle of blazing fagots fastened between its
  horns, blinded, frantic with pain and terror.</p>

  <p>Sergius sprang aside, as the beast dashed by; but Decius, roused once more
  to the possibility of independent thought and action, stepped toward it and,
  as it passed, plunged his sword between its heaving ribs.</p>

  <p>"What now, my master?" he said, flushing with shame at his fears of the
  last hour&mdash;perhaps the bravest hour of his life. "Does the lying
  Carthaginian seek to terrify Quintus Fabius, the dictator, as he terrified
  Marcus Decius, the decurion?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, truly," replied Sergius, gloomily; "and he will succeed even better.
  No general, and, least of all, ours, would lead out his army in the night
  against such a spectacle. Come, it is necessary that we should reach the
  camp," and, turning once again, they fell to running in a more southern
  direction, where a dim glow in the sky seemed to tell of the watchfires of an
  army.</p>

  <p>At first no sound broke the stillness of the night, save the laboured
  breathing of the weary runners and the strokes of their leathern cothurni
  upon the hard ground; but soon other noises came to mingle with these and, at
  last, to drown them: the lowing of thousands of cattle, now scattered far and
  wide over the plain and hillsides, and then the distant clash of arms and the
  cries of combatants.</p>

  <p>Day began to dawn, just as the fugitives came in sight of the Roman camp
  with the army drawn up behind its ramparts, waiting for they knew not what.
  Here and there upon the heights they could see small bodies of legionaries
  who defended themselves against light troops of the enemy, until overwhelmed
  by the Spanish infantry that scaled the hills and cut them to pieces; while
  to every prayer that the dictator should march out to their support, he
  returned one grim answer.</p>

  <p>"They deserted their posts in the passes. Rome needs not such
  soldiers."</p>

  <p>So, company by company, the guards of the defiles, terrified or lured away
  to the ridges by the ruse of the cattle and the blazing fagots, fell
  ingloriously before their comrades' eyes, as being men not worth the effort
  to succour. The rear-guard of the invaders had already made its way through
  the pass, while the Carthaginian van was well on into the valley of the
  Volturnus. Now, too, the African light troops disappeared, and, at last, the
  white tunics of the Spaniards, gay with their purple borders, glittered for a
  moment on the hilltops, and then, their work of death completed, sank away
  behind the ridges to fall back and join their comrades in a march of new
  destruction through a new country.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap108"
     name="chap108">VIII. &mdash; DISGRACE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHILE these things were happening, for the most part in the
  sight of all, Sergius had been able to gain a moment's speech with the
  dictator. Forcing his way through the crowd of tribunes and officers who
  thronged the praetorium, he had found Fabius seated before his tent, and had
  told his story in the fewest words possible.</p>

  <p>Naked but for his torn tunic and his cothurni, covered from head to foot
  with blood and mire, his left arm hanging useless, and his face like the face
  of a dead man, neither his miserable plight nor his story brought softness to
  the stern lips and brow of the general.</p>

  <p>"You have come to tell me this?" he said, when the other had finished
  speaking. "Do I not know it <i>now</i>?" and he pointed to the heights. Then
  he turned away and spoke with some one at his side, while Sergius stood, with
  downcast eyes, swaying and scarcely able to keep his feet.</p>

  <p>Among those around him his fate seemed hardly a matter of conjecture, but
  a thrill went through the company when Minucius, who had been vainly urging
  the dictator to support the guards of the passes, now turned away in disgust,
  and, noting the disgraced officer, as if for the first time, cried out in a
  loud voice:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"What, my friend! have not the lictors attended to you, yet, for venturing
  to play the man?"</p>

  <p>Sergius felt the added danger to which the master-of-the-horse had exposed
  him by using his insubordination to point such a moral to his commander; but
  the face of the dictator gave no sign that he had even heard the taunting
  challenge. Calmly he gave his orders for cautious scouting, for breaking
  camp, and for the army to resume its patient march of observation, along the
  flank of the retiring foe. Then, when one after another had retired to fulfil
  his commands, he turned again to the waiting tribune.</p>

  <p>"I have been considering your fault," he said slowly, "and I had marked
  you out as a much needed victim for the rods and axe. Go to my
  master-of-the-horse and thank him for your life. His taunt was doubtless
  meant to destroy you, in order that he might play the demagogue over your
  fate. I accept it as a challenge to my self-control. It is more necessary
  that I should show myself wise and forbearing than that one fool should
  perish for his folly. Go back to Rome, and tell them that I have many
  soldiers who can fight, and that I want only those who can obey."</p>

  <p>Utterly exhausted, Sergius struggled vainly to withstand this last,
  crushing blow. His composure was unequal to the task, and, sinking upon his
  knees, as the dictator turned toward the tent, he could only stretch out one
  hand and murmur:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The axe, my master; I pray you, the axe."</p>

  <p>Fabius paused a moment and eyed him grimly. Then his rugged, weary face
  softened slightly.</p>

  <p>"I trusted you," he said. "Could you not trust me for a little while? But
  go to Rome, as I bade you&mdash;only there shall others go with you, and you
  shall bear for your message, instead of that one, this: that there is no room
  for wounded men in my camp."</p>

  <p>"But I shall be well in two days&mdash;in one&mdash;I am well now if you
  say it."</p>

  <p>Fabius shook his head slowly.</p>

  <p>"Aesculapius has not been unhonoured by me," he said, "and he has told me
  that you will be but a burden for many days. For this reason go to Rome, and
  for two others that you shall not tell of: one, for punishment because you
  could not obey, and one, because the time will come soon when Rome shall need
  even the men who can only fight."</p>

  <p>Sergius saw the hopelessness of struggling against his softened fate,
  bitter though it was. Open disgrace, indeed, had been turned aside; but, on
  the other hand, he was doomed to inaction during times when all Rome longed
  only to strike, and he could not but feel that he had fallen far in the
  estimation of his general.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap109"
     name="chap109">IX. &mdash; HOME</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE Appian Way was still safe, even from the chance of
  Numidian foray, and it was along its lava-paved level that the long convoy of
  sick and wounded writhed slowly northward that afternoon.</p>

  <p>Half reclining in the rude chariot, each jolt of which brought agony to
  his injured shoulder, Sergius watched, with far deeper pain than that of
  body, the last troop of allied horse winding up the pass toward Allifae: the
  rear-guard of Rome's line of march. Then he fell to brooding upon his fate,
  while the night followed the day and the day the night, and still the dreary,
  groaning caravan dragged on, resting only during the heated hours.</p>

  <p>On, over the Liris at Minturnae, upward, over the mountains behind
  Tarracina and descending again into the Pontine plain; through the shady
  groves of Arician ilex that crown the Alban Hills, down to Bovillae, and then
  away across the Campagna to Rome&mdash;a marvel of deep cuttings through the
  hills,&mdash;a marvel of giant superstructures over valleys,&mdash;the
  Appian, the Queen of Ways.</p>

  <p>There were long, green ridges now, swelling from the plain and breaking
  away into little rocky cliffs tufted with wild fig trees: sluggish streams
  wound down from the east where, far away, loomed the snow-tipped summits of
  Apennine, while toward the west the sky reflected a brighter light from the
  sea that glittered beneath it.</p>

  <p>At last the eyes of the vanguard of weary wayfarers could descry, through
  the morning mists, the crowned cluster of hills that was to be a crown to all
  the world. Nearer they came and yet nearer, through the vineyards and
  cornfields of the Campagna&mdash;the southern Campagna teeming with its herds
  of mouse-coloured cattle, whose great, stupid eyes were only less stupidly
  beautiful than those of the rustics that watched over their grazings.</p>

  <p>And now wounds and sickness were, for the moment, forgotten, as man
  pointed out to man this and that landmark of home: temples on this hill and
  on that; Diana on the Aventine, the hill of the people; Jupiter Stator on the
  Palatine; the grim mass of the citadel above the rock of Tarpeia; the great
  quadriga that surmounted the greatest fane of all&mdash;the house of
  Capitoline Jove. To the right of these were the clustered oaks of the Caelian
  Mount, while, farthest away, but highest of all, the white banner fluttering
  from the heights of Janiculum told them that the city was still safe, still
  unassailed. They were passing where the road was bordered by its houses of
  the dead; tombs of the great families, above which the funereal cypresses
  bent their heads and shed peace and shade alike over the dead and the living.
  The hum of the city came to their ears, and, as the convoy drew nearer to the
  Capenian Gate, the throng, pouring out to meet them, grew thicker and more
  dense, blocking the way until the cavalry of the escort cleared it with their
  spear-butts. Then the press divided, running along on both sides of the
  carriages, in two fast-filling streams whose murmurs swelled into a very
  torrent's roar of questions and prayers for news of the general and the
  army.</p>

  <p>"Was Hannibal beaten? Had he been slain, or was he waiting in chains to
  grace the Fabian triumph? Was it true that he measured twice the height of
  common men, and that a single eye blazed cyclops-like in the middle of his
  forehead? How many elephants would be seen in the triumph?"</p>

  <p>Such and a hundred queries, equally wild, assailed the escort and the
  occupants of the wagons; for this was the rabble: poor citizens, freedmen,
  slaves, for whom no story of Hannibal and Carthage was too improbable.
  Nevertheless Sergius imagined he could discern a spirit of irony underlying
  much that he heard.</p>

  <p>When they had reached the low eminence that, crowned by the Temple of
  Mars, faced the city gate, he bade the attendants help him descend from the
  army carriage, that he might wait the coming of his slaves with a litter. A
  messenger was soon found, and hurried off, charged with necessary
  directions.</p>

  <p>The crowd had rolled on through the gate, together with the convoy, and
  the sick man was left alone save for the attendants of the temple in whose
  care he had placed himself. Day by day, as he had jolted along his journey,
  he had felt the fever coming on&mdash; fever born of his injury and the
  terrible strain to which he had been subjected: now it was only necessary to
  reach his home and rest. Last of his race but for two older sisters who had
  married several years since, the spacious mansion of the family of Fidenas
  was his alone, with its slaves and its ancestral masks and its cool courts
  and its outlook over the seething Forum up to the opposite heights of the
  Capitol. There he would find care and comfort for the body if not for the
  soul.</p>

  <p>And now the patter of running feet sounded from the pavement below. They
  were come, at last, with the litter, and Sergius, entering it, was borne
  swiftly through the gate, on, between the tall houses that backed up against
  the hills, turning soon to the left into the New Way; on, past the altar of
  Hercules in the cattle market, past the Temple of Vesta, along the Comitia,
  and into the Sacred Way by the front of the Curia. Thence they swung westward
  to the Roman Gate, the gate in the ancient Wall of the City of Romulus that
  fenced the Palatine alone,&mdash;a stately entrance, now, to the residence
  portion of the city most favoured by the great families. Near by stood the
  house that marked the ending of the journey, bustling with its slaves and
  bright with a hundred lamps; while the physician, an old freedman of the
  tribune's father, stood upon the threshold to greet and care for his late
  master's son.</p>

  <p>Gravely shaking his head at the discouraging aspect of the invalid and
  muttering to himself in Greek, for he was born in Rhodes, he led the way back
  to the great hall between the peristyle and the garden.</p>

  <p>"Here, master," he said, "I have caused your couch to be laid, at the
  moment I learned of your arrival and condition. You observe, the air and
  light will be better than in your apartment, and the space better calculated
  for those whose duty it shall be to minister to you, until the divine
  Aesculapius and Apollo's self unite to grant success to my efforts."</p>

  <p>"It is well, Agathocles," said Sergius, wearily, "and I thank you."</p>

  <p>His voice seemed to die away with the last words, and a sort of stupor
  fell over him. Agathocles watched him closely, as he lay upon the couch,
  noted the heavy breathing, and drew his brows together with a deep frown.
  Behind him a group of the household slaves whispered together and cast
  frightened glances, now at their master, now at the disciple of the healing
  art; for Sergius had been brought up among them, and the terms of their
  service were neither heavy nor harsh. Then the surgeon set to work examining
  the shoulder, nodding his head to observe that the bone had been replaced in
  its socket, but waxing troubled again over the inflammation and swelling that
  told the story of torn tendons and blood-vessels too long neglected, and of
  the hardships of the journey. Slaves were sent scurrying, in this direction
  and that, to compound lotions and spread poultices, while Agathocles himself
  proceeded to the ostentatious mixing of some cooling draught calculated to
  ward off, if possible, the fever that was already claiming its sway.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap110"
     name="chap110">X. &mdash; CONVALESCENCE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE many weeks of hovering between life and death that
  followed these days were a dense blank to Sergius. First, there was his
  injury, more serious than he had imagined, and the fever that had followed
  it, complicated again by the malaria of the marshes through which he had
  journeyed in so vulnerable a plight. Then came other weeks of such lassitude
  that he had neither power nor desire to learn of the world to which he felt
  himself slowly returning, as did Aeneas from the realms of Pluto. There were
  times when he had been vaguely conscious of whisperings around his couch upon
  subjects that should have interested him and did not. Was it his fault? or
  had everything become commonplace and of no account?</p>

  <p>At last there came a time of convalescence. His haggard face frightened
  him when he looked at it in the bronze mirror; but the air of the winter was
  fresh and keen, bringing health and life to the mind, if not entirely to the
  body. So, lying one day in the entrance hall and gazing out over the Forum
  below, he turned to Agathocles, who sat close by.</p>

  <p>"And now you shall tell me," he began, "of the things that have happened
  while I have lain here, helpless as a bag of corn in the granary, and of even
  less importance."</p>

  <p>"You mistake, my master," replied the physician, quickly. "Surely you must
  know that your condition has been a matter of deep anxiety to many, both
  within and without your walls."</p>

  <p>"Within, perhaps, yes," said Sergius, slowly. "I treat them well, and such
  of them as do not get freedom by my will would doubtless find harder masters
  in Sabinus and Camerinus. My sisters' husbands are patricians of the old
  school. As for without,&mdash;am I not a man useless in times of
  action?&mdash;well-nigh disgraced?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Agathocles hastened to interrupt:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Ah! my master, you do not know. Could you but see the crowd of clients
  who have gathered at your door each morning, waiting for it to creak upon the
  pivots, and, later in the day, such of your friends as were not away with the
  army&mdash;ay," he continued, with a sharp glance at the invalid, "and a
  pretty female slave who has come at each nightfall and has questioned the
  doorkeeper."</p>

  <p>The strong desire to hear of two things had come into Sergius' mind while
  the physician was speaking. He must learn about this female slave who had
  inquired so assiduously, and he must hear of the army, the war, the Republic;
  for these last three were really but one. After something of an effort, and
  not without a certain sentiment of self-approval, he said:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Let me hear of friends later, my Agathocles. Tell me now of the war."</p>

  <p>There was a troubled expression in the physician's eyes, but he answered
  volubly:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It progresses famously, in Spain, my master. Oh!&mdash;ay&mdash;famously.
  Their fleet has been swept from the seas, and Scipio slays and drives them as
  he wills. Doubtless by now they are all back in Africa&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not of Spain," interrupted Sergius, as the narrator caught his breath.
  "Tell me of Italy, of Hannibal and Fabius. Have the standards opposed each
  other?"</p>

  <p>"They say Hannibal is in winter quarters at Geronium, and the consuls
  watch him," began Agathocles, in more subdued tones.</p>

  <p>"Tell me of Fabius. Tell me of what has happened&mdash;all, do you hear?"
  cried Sergius, raising himself impatiently on one elbow. "If your story seems
  to lack coherence and truth, I swear to you that I will go down into the
  Forum at once and learn what I wish."</p>

  <p>Thus adjured, the physician answered, but with evident
  reluctance:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Truly, my master, all things have not been as we might wish, and yet they
  could easily have run worse. When your dictator let the invaders out of
  Campania, there was much complaint among the people that he was protracting
  the war for his own advantage; but when he came to Rome for the sacrifices
  and left Minucius in command, with orders not to engage, and when the
  master-of-the-horse, as some say, evading the orders, fought and gained an
  advantage, then, you may believe me, the city was in a turmoil; nor were
  there wanting friends of Minucius and emissaries from his camp to sound his
  praises as a general and decry the dictator and his policy, not to say his
  courage and his honesty."</p>

  <p>"I warrant," said Sergius, gloomily, "that every pot-house politician from
  the Etruscan Street was declaiming on how much better <i>he</i> could command
  than could Quintus Fabius."</p>

  <p>"Until at last," went on Agathocles, "Marcus Metilius&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The tribune?&mdash;a corrupt knave!" broke in Sergius.</p>

  <p>"Surely; yes. Well, this Marcus Metilius made a speech&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Full of rank demagoguery, I warrant."</p>

  <p>"Surely, and saying that it was intolerable for Minucius, who was the only
  man who could fight, to be put under guard lest he beat the enemy;
  intolerable that the territory of the allies should have been given up to
  ravage, while the dictator protected his own farm with the legions of the
  Republic; and, finally, proposing, as a most moderate measure, that Minucius,
  the victor, should be given equal command over the army with Fabius the
  laggard."</p>

  <p>"Unprecedented impudence!" murmured Sergius, "and what said the
  dictator?"</p>

  <p>"He did not trouble to go near the Comitia, and even in the Senate they
  did not like to hear his praises of Hannibal and his troops, or listen
  favourably when he spoke doubtfully concerning the magnitude of Minucius'
  victory and claimed that, even were it all true, the master-of-the-horse
  should be called to account for his insubordination. So, after he had lauded
  prudence and supported his own policy, and after Marcus Atilius Regulus was
  elected consul, the dictator departed for the army, in the night, and left
  them to do as they pleased."</p>

  <p>"They passed the law?" asked Sergius, bitterly.</p>

  <p>"It hung in doubt for some time," went on Agathocles; "for, though many
  favoured, few were disposed to advance such a measure, until Caius Terentius
  Varro, who was praetor last year&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The butcher's son," commented Sergius. "You know, my Agathocles, how
  demagogues and tyrants crushed out the life of your Hellas. We have yet to
  see the same ruin fall upon Rome, and from the same cause: first, an
  ungovernable rabble, stirred up by the ignorant and vicious, and then a king,
  and then a foreign conqueror. Flaminius lost one army, Minucius will
  doubtless lose another, while Metilius and Varro are well able to lose
  whatever may remain. Pah! Why did you not let me finish my journey to
  Acheron? This is no city for men whose fathers were able to teach them about
  war and honour. He whose tongue is most ready to lie about the noble and the
  rich is counted on to wield the sword best against an enemy.
  Well,&mdash;speak on; and what happened next?"</p>

  <p>"As you say," continued the physician, "the measure was passed; but when
  Minucius desired that he and the dictator should command on alternate days,
  Fabius would only consent to a division of the army."</p>

  <p>"Gods!" exclaimed Sergius. "Two legions apiece! That must have been rare
  sport for Hannibal."</p>

  <p>"Truly, yes; but it resulted well, for, to shorten the tale, the
  Carthaginian trapped Minucius through his rashness, and was about to cut him
  to pieces, when the dictator, who had foreseen all this, came up and saved
  what was left; whereupon the master-of-the-horse marched to the general's
  camp, and, saluting him as 'father' and 'saviour,' surrendered his equal
  command, after having directed his soldiers, also, to greet the others as
  patrons&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That, at least, was well done," said Sergius, nodding; "worthy of a man
  better born than Minucius. I do him honour for learning from experience.
  Metilius or Varro could not have done it."</p>

  <p>"And, now," continued Agathocles, "both the dictator and the master-
  of-the-horse have given up their commands, the time of their appointments
  expiring, and the army is in winter quarters under the consuls."</p>

  <p>"Servilius and Atilius?"</p>

  <p>"Truly."</p>

  <p>"And the elections?"</p>

  <p>"Are falling due."</p>

  <p>"Who sue for the consulship?"</p>

  <p>Agathocles hesitated and placed his fingers upon the patient's pulse.</p>

  <p>"I have told you enough for the day&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who are candidates?" reiterated Sergius, leaning forward impatiently.</p>

  <p>"They say that Varro&mdash;" began Agathocles.</p>

  <p>But the tribune had sprung to his feet. Then, as he swayed a moment from
  weakness, leaning back against the couch, he raised both hands and cried
  out:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Have they gone mad? The butcher's son!&mdash;the bearer of his father's
  wares, to command against Hannibal! Do you think the Carthaginian a bullock
  to stand still and stupid, while this soldier of the shambles swings the axe?
  Gods! They will learn their error&mdash; only <i>we</i> must pay the price,
  together with the rabble that owe it. Gods! Was not the lesson of Flaminius
  enough for these drinkers of vinegar-water? This will be great news for them
  on the Megalia."</p>

  <p>Then, seeming to gain strength from his excitement, he strode up and down
  the atrium, while the physician watched him anxiously but without venturing
  to interfere.</p>

  <p>It was the doorkeeper's attendant that broke in upon the scene, pausing a
  moment in doubt, as his eyes followed his master's rapid strides. Finally,
  approaching Agathocles, he plucked him by the sleeve and
  whispered:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The woman desires to know of the health of my lord."</p>

  <p>Before the physician could answer, Sergius had caught the words, and,
  wheeling about, faced the boy.</p>

  <p>"What woman and where?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The gray stole; the slave woman who inquires for you. She waits her
  answer at the door," said the boy, his tongue loosened by the question.</p>

  <p>"Let her come to me," commanded Sergius, and he threw himself down upon
  the deeply cushioned seat of a marble chair. Agathocles stood at his elbow,
  with an expression of anxiety on his face, and, in a moment more, the girl
  entered.</p>

  <p>Muffled almost to the eyes, she glided forward, and the voice that
  addressed him was soft and musical.</p>

  <p>"May the gods favour you, my lord! even as they have favoured me in
  permitting a sight of your improved health."</p>

  <p>"You have been here often," began Sergius, "and I wished to see you and
  bid you bear my thanks to her who sent you."</p>

  <p>Slowly the stole dropped from the eyes&mdash;very pretty eyes, that,
  joined with an equally pretty mouth, took on an expression of hurt
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"That <i>sent</i> me?" she murmured, half sadly. "Ah, well; doubtless it
  is a matter of insolence for a poor slave girl to wish and ask concerning the
  health of the noble Sergius."</p>

  <p>The tribune watched her closely and with mingled feelings. He had settled
  in his mind, from the moment of Agathocles' mention of the fact, that the
  slave woman who called must be sent by Marcia, and it was not without a pang
  of very poignant regret that he relinquished the idea. That he could not
  place this girl&mdash;one of a class so far beneath the notice of a Roman of
  rank&mdash;was not strange, and yet the face seemed vaguely familiar to him,
  and&mdash;it was certainly little short of beautiful. A man flouted, or,
  still worse, ignored by a mistress at whose shrine he has worshipped, might
  well be pardoned a feeling of satisfaction that his well-being was a matter
  of interest to at least one pretty woman.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the girl stood before him, her arms hanging by her sides, her
  eyes modestly cast down, and her whole attitude indicative of detected
  audacity and submissive despair. Agathocles had transferred his attention
  from his patient to the visitor, and his scrutiny seemed to trouble her.</p>

  <p>"So it was yourself alone who desired to learn of my welfare," said
  Sergius, with a faint smile. "Believe me, my girl, no Roman is too noble to
  value the interest of beauty like yours."</p>

  <p>There was just the suspicion of a laugh in the downcast eyes, but it sped
  away as swiftly as it came, and she made haste to answer:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Truly, my lord does not measure his own worth. There are many, as much
  above me in beauty as they are in rank; many who cannot venture to show the
  concern they doubtless feel. What has a poor slave girl to do with maidenly
  modesty&mdash;the plaything of any master who chooses to smile upon her for a
  moment?"</p>

  <p>She spoke bitterly, and Sergius, half frowning, half smiling, reached out
  his hand. The contrast between this girl's frankly spoken interest and the
  courted Marcia's trivial indifference came to him more powerfully. What a
  fool a man was to waste himself on some haughty mistress who exacted all
  things and gave nothing! She had taken the hand he held out, and now,
  suddenly, he drew her to him, and kissed her.</p>

  <p>Then he found new occasion to marvel over the strange ways of women. As if
  awakened from a dream or a part in a comedy, to some instant and frightful
  peril, she wrenched herself from him and, wrapping her cloak around her face,
  turned and ran like a deer through the hallway and out into the street.</p>

  <p>Sergius was dazed for a moment by the suddenness of it all; then he
  rose.</p>

  <p>"Quick, Smyrnus!" he called to the boy who attended on the porter.
  "Follow, and bring me word where she goes."</p>

  <p>The delay had been short, and Smyrnus was swift of foot, but when he
  reached the street it was empty as far as he could see, and a dash to each
  corner of the house gave no better results. Inquiries, likewise, were
  unavailing, and he returned slowly and with shoulders that already seemed to
  tingle under the expected rods.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Agathocles had essayed to exert his authority over the invalid,
  and was protesting volubly against the latter's imprudence. Sergius was in
  excellent humour, despite the escape of his conquest.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, my Agathocles," he began, half guiltily at first, but gaining
  confidence as he pursued his justification. "Do you not see, all this has
  done me more good than a score of days spent in dull reclining, with only
  nauseous draughts to mark the hours by? I have learned that I am a man again,
  with an interest in the Republic and myself. Surely such knowledge is worth a
  little risk. To-morrow, mark you, if the gods favour me, I shall descend into
  the Forum and see if nothing is to be effected against this rabble in the
  matter of the elections. Had she not magnificent eyes, my Agathocles? not
  those of the dull ox, as your Homer puts it, but rather of the startled
  fawn?"</p>

  <p>"They seemed to me more of the fox," said the physician, dryly, "being
  golden in colour and very cunning. I doubt you fathomed her smile, though
  wherefore she should seek&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sacrilege! Agathocles," cried Sergius, gayly; "but here comes Smyrnus.
  Well, boy, where is the lair of this fox of our good Agathocles?"</p>

  <p>The terrified boy had thrown himself upon his face.</p>

  <p>"I hastened with all speed, master," he protested. "At your word I flew,
  but she was gone, as if a god had snatched her up, nor was there a passer-by
  who had seen aught&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sergius was frowning ominously; then his face cleared.</p>

  <p>"Doubtless that was it, Smyrnus," he said. "Your judicious piety is
  quicker than your heels in saving your back. If a god took her, he showed
  excellent taste, and it would be utter sacrilege to punish you for failing to
  learn her whereabouts. Come, Agathocles, be not so gloomy. Do you think it is
  Aesculapius who has come to your aid? He, at least, is no spruce, young
  rival. Be conciliatory, or I may, perhaps, venture to try my fortune even
  against&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am rather of the opinion that some cunning Hermes has tricked Eros and
  Aesculapius and my Lord Lucius as well," said the physician. An expression of
  grim humour lurked in his face, and Sergius felt strangely uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"What is a physician if he talk not in the language of oracles," he said,
  querulously. "Well, you may send me to my couch now, if you will; but, mark
  you, to-morrow I go to the Forum."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap111"
     name="chap111">XI. &mdash; POLITICS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ON the following day, Sergius, true to his purpose, ordered
  his litter to be brought, and, reclining as his weakness compelled, was borne
  down into the Forum crowded with its mass of turbulent and perspiring
  humanity. Nor was the temper of the rabble doubtful. On every side he heard
  arraignments of Fabius, and, through him, of all men guilty of good birth or
  riches. Under every portico, speakers were pouring forth harangues whose
  ignorance was only matched by their coarseness and surpassed by their
  reckless malevolence. Once he bade his bearers set him down, near where one
  Quintus Baebius Herennius, a plebeian tribune and a relative of Varro's, was
  holding forth to a sympathetic crowd.</p>

  <p>"Do you not know, ye foolish Romans," cried the orator, alternately
  slapping his thigh, waving his arms, and casting up his eyes, "that this
  Hannibal was brought into Italy by these very nobles, who are always desiring
  war? Can you not see how they are protracting the war, when you consider that
  one man of the people, our own Minucius, when he commanded the four legions,
  was sufficient for the enemy? Behold how this traitorous, this
  <i>noble</i>Fabian schemed to expose the brave Minucius and two legions of
  the people to destruction, and only rescued the remnant that he might pose as
  their saviour and be saluted 'father' and 'patron.' There, indeed, was our
  Minucius at fault, as what honest, poor man is not, when confronted by the
  wiles of those bred to craft and trickery! See, too, how the consuls have
  followed the same dilatory measures, and can you doubt that it is all by
  agreement with these traitor nobles? Know well, now, that this war will have
  no ending until a man of the people ends it&mdash;a real plebeian; a new man.
  See you not that both consuls, by tarrying with the army, have set up an
  interregnum, that the wicked nobles may the better influence your choice? But
  if you be true Romans, such as were those who camped upon the Sacred Hill,
  you will remember that one consulship, at least, is yours by law, and you
  will elect a man to fill it who is one of yourselves and who will spurn the
  rich, as they now seek to spurn you and me and all good men."</p>

  <p>Sergius had listened to this harangue, and to the applause which greeted
  it, with mingled feelings of indignation and sorrow&mdash;sentiments to which
  was added surprise when he noted through the closed curtains of his litter
  that several patricians passed by and smiled and nodded to the speaker while
  he poured forth his diatribes. Now, however, a new commotion seemed to
  agitate the throng, who, turning suddenly, ran pell-mell in one direction,
  almost overturning the litter&mdash;a catastrophe from which it was only
  saved by a vigorous use of the bearers' staves upon the heads of the
  nearest.</p>

  <p>Sergius thrust aside the curtains and half raised himself to see the cause
  of the disturbance. The brightly fullered gown of a candidate flashed before
  his eyes, and then he recognized Varro standing upon a silversmith's counter,
  smiling this way and that, grasping the hands of those nearest, kissing his
  own to the very outskirts of the mob, and all the while crying out, to the
  promptings of his nomenclator: "Greeting to you, Marcus!" "Health, Quintus!"
  "Commend me to your brother, my Caius&mdash;yes, to be sure&mdash; when he
  shall return from the army. Ah! friends, when I am consul, there will be a
  hasty returning from such foolish wars. You shall see the African
  fork-bearers winding through the Forum."</p>

  <p>"And that is the first word of truth I have heard from you, Varro, or from
  your Herennius here," cried Sergius, who had risen and now stood, pale and
  gaunt, beside his litter. "With you and such as you to command, we may well
  look to see the African fork-bearers winding through the Forum&mdash;yes, and
  pillaging amid its ruins."</p>

  <p>A roar of vituperation drowned whatever answer the candidate might have
  made, as, with brandished clubs, cleavers, knives, styli&mdash;any weapon
  that could be snatched up from the booths&mdash;the nearest score of the
  crowd made a dash at the presumptuous noble.</p>

  <p>The litter-bearers were sturdy fellows, and their staves were stout, but
  the contest was far too unequal. One had gone down with a deep gash in the
  shoulder, and the others were quickly forced back upon their master.</p>

  <p>Sergius stood with his back to one of the square pillars of peperino, with
  folded arms and pale face upon which hovered a smile of ineffable scorn. He
  recognized his peril: the fate that had befallen many noble Romans in the
  election riots of the Republic; but his sentiment was rather one of
  indifference than of perturbation, and he was about to order his slaves to
  give up their hopeless defence, in order that the crowd might let them, at
  least, go without further hurt, when an entirely unexpected diversion brought
  him relief and safety.</p>

  <p>Varro had viewed the attack upon his critic with a pleasure that he
  scarcely tried to conceal. He kept begging his adherents to be moderate and
  abstain from violence, but in so low a voice that his counsels could not be
  heard except by those immediately around him, and were entirely inaudible to
  the howling assailants to whom they were presumably addressed. Another voice,
  however, a shrill, female voice, came suddenly to Sergius' ears:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Would that my brother could come to life and command another fleet, that
  the streets might be less crowded!"</p>

  <p>Sergius recognized, in a rich litter that was tossed hither and thither by
  the billows of the mob, the face of the sister of that Publius Claudius who
  had lost for Rome the naval battle off Drepanum. The mob, too, recognized
  her, and the scornful speech bit deeply. All around arose a cry of&mdash;</p>

  <p>"To the aediles with her! To the aediles! She has rejoiced in the death of
  our brothers! May the gods curse the noble!" and, in a moment, Sergius found
  himself alone but for his bruised and bleeding servants, while the tide of
  riot swept up the Forum, bearing the litter upon its tossing crests, and the
  virago within continued to scream out her defiance and contempt.</p>

  <p>Varro remained, surrounded by a few friends, and, as Sergius approached,
  he drew himself up, as if to renforce his courage with a sense of his
  importance. The tribune was about to pass him without a word; but the
  demagogue, emboldened by this seeming unwillingness for an encounter, placed
  himself in his path.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear the kindly wishes that the great express for the health of
  their poorer countrymen?" he began, tauntingly.</p>

  <p>"It is like your kind, Varro," replied Sergius, speaking slowly and in
  tones of profound contempt, "to attribute to our party any intemperance of a
  single opponent; but do you also credit us with the virtues of individuals? I
  might with better grace attribute the murderous attack just made&mdash;and
  with your connivance&mdash;upon myself, to the party of the people. That I do
  not do so, you may lay to a moderation and magnanimity that are not learned
  in the tradesman's booth or the butcher's shambles."</p>

  <p>Varro flushed crimson, and he looked from side to side, as if to call upon
  his friends for new violence; but a company of young patricians were
  descending from the Comitia, and his fellows were dull of comprehension.</p>

  <p>"Do you beware, though, Varro," continued Sergius, "lest, in striving to
  attain power and place on the wings of calumny against those better than
  yourself, or by the suggestion of false grievances to those who are ignorant
  and weak, you may, by these things, incite one riot too many. Beware, above
  all things, lest you win."</p>

  <p>Then, drawing his toga close, as if to avoid a contaminating touch, he
  strode by to join the approaching band of young men, leaving his opponent
  vicious to snarl, but powerless to bite.</p>

  <p>After the usual greetings and inquiries concerning his health, they walked
  on together toward the Curtian Pool, and Sergius' thoughts took on a deeper
  colour from the despondent speech of his friends. That Varro would receive
  the votes of the centuries, beyond all doubt, was unanimously conceded; and
  so great was the dissatisfaction with Fabius, that their regret seemed only
  for the manner of the popular victory and the man who was to gain it. A few
  hot-heads dropped hints to the effect that it might become necessary to
  reorganize the patrician clubs and meet violence with violence, in which
  event there could be but little doubt as to the result; but the sentiment of
  the majority was adverse to such measures, and they viewed the possibilities
  with an indifference that to Sergius seemed even more ominous than the frenzy
  of the rabble and the worthlessness of its leaders. His attempts to defend
  the Fabian policy, speaking as one of its victims, were hopelessly thrown
  away. All Rome was mad for battle, even at the cost of sending the butcher's
  son to command the legions; and, two days later, the result of low chicanery
  and indifferent lethargy took shape.</p>

  <p>The trumpet had summoned the army of the city to the Field of Mars, and
  century after century had entered the enclosure to cast its vote for
  Varro&mdash;for Varro alone, until no one of the noble candidates, who
  received the half-hearted support of their fellows, got even enough pebbles
  to be proclaimed elected to the second consulship. To Varro alone, cringing
  and insolent, was the oath administered; for Varro alone was the prayer put
  up; for Varro was the declaration twice made, according to the laws of the
  Republic, and into Varro's hands was placed the presidency over the assembly
  that was to elect his colleague.</p>

  <p>Then followed an exhibition of plebeian cunning. There were among the
  supporters of the consul those who realized what he himself could not: his
  military incompetence and the terrible necessity that, at such a juncture,
  there should be at least one soldier-consul. Varro had won on his merits as
  self-announced, on the strength of his own arraignment of his adversaries'
  shortcomings. He stood forth the incarnation of party and class hatred; and
  now the victors, half dazed by the very completeness of their triumph, paused
  in mid career to look for a soldier with whom the army might be entrusted.
  That he must be a noble, was self-evident. Even the rabble, now that its
  first outburst had passed, was not so mad as to attribute military skill to
  any of its wordy leaders. The butcher's colleague must be a patrician, but he
  must be such a patrician as would cast reproach upon his class, while he
  supplied the one quality requisite to the plebeian situation. To whose
  political acumen first occurred the name of Lucius Aemilius Paullus, no one
  seemed to know; but, once suggested, there was none to deny its entire
  appropriateness. Paullus was a veteran of several wars, an experienced
  commander, a brave soldier; and there his merits ended. He had been brought
  to trial for misappropriation of the plunder taken in the Illyrian campaign,
  and, as many thought, acquitted by means as scandalous as the crime itself,
  while his less influential colleague suffered for both. Harsh and rude, no
  high-born Roman was less popular; and his exaggeration of class insolence
  bade fair to offer him as an illustration, ready to the tongue of every
  demagogue, of what the people must always expect from patrician rule.</p>

  <p>So, one by one, the five noble opponents of Varro were rejected, and the
  word went out that, of their enemies, the people would have Paullus and him
  alone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap112"
     name="chap112">XII. &mdash; BRAWLINGS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MORE sick at heart, as he grew stronger in body, Sergius
  returned from the final voting in the Field of Mars. For some reason the
  popular party, sated with triumph, had permitted the election, as praetors,
  of good men who had experience in military affairs; perhaps that these might,
  together with Paullus, make surer the victory that was to redound to the
  honour of the darling of the mob and proclaim to all the Roman world the
  superiority of the butcher, Varro, over Fabius, the well-fathered.</p>

  <p>As Sergius was borne along toward the Palatine district, he found the
  streets crowded with a populace he had hardly known to exist in the city.
  Down from the lofty tenements of the Aicus, up from the slums of the Suburra,
  the Gate of the Three Folds, and the Etruscan Street they poured, drunk with
  joy and with hatred of all men who wore white togas and had money to lend or
  lands to till. At each corner a denser throng was gathered around jugglers,
  tumblers, wrestlers that writhed over the road-way, actors who danced
  Etruscan pantomimes and carried their make-up in little bags slung around
  their necks, singers of medleys, and would-be popular poets who spouted
  coarse epigrams and ribald satires levelled at the thieving, the effeminate,
  the adulterous patricians who thought to rule Rome and had named an Aemilius
  Paullus to stand beside and check the generous, the fearless, the
  incorruptible Varro. Threatening looks and words were cast at Sergius and the
  company of freedmen and clients that surrounded him, until he was not
  ill-pleased to see the escort of another noble issue from a side street and
  beat its way to where the exhausted bearers had set down the tribune's
  litter, pausing to gain breath before attempting to push on farther. When,
  however, he recognized in the sturdy old man who strode along in the midst of
  the new company, no more distant acquaintance than the father of Marcia, he
  was conscious of a strong revulsion. Better the continued buffeting with an
  obstreperous mob than the embarrassments he foresaw in such a rencontre; but
  it was too late to avoid it: the interests and perils of the two parties were
  too nearly identical, and he heard the gruff voice of his old friend crying
  out:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Back, exercisers of the whip! Back, colonizers of chains! To the cross
  with you all! Is this Animula or Rome, where rude clowns do not recognize
  their betters?" Then, for the first time, perceiving Sergius: "Greeting to
  you, my Lucius! May the gods favour you better than they have the Republic
  this day."</p>

  <p>At that moment, a big, hulking fellow thrust himself forward in the path
  of the advancing patrician and hiccoughed out:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"May you meet with a plague, master! Truly there are to be no betters or
  worsers in Rome&mdash;now that the noble Varro is consul and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The staff of Torquatus felled him to the ground, where he lay shuddering
  and drawing up his legs, while a yell of rage and menace broke from the
  crowd. Scarcely changing a line in his grim face, the old man calmly trussed
  the folds of his toga about his left arm, freed his right more fully, and
  drew a stylus of such size as to suggest a dagger much more than an
  instrument for writing: such a weapon as was born of the election brawls of
  earlier days, innocent under the law, yet equally efficient as pen or
  sword.</p>

  <p>Daunted at his aspect, the foremost assailants held back.</p>

  <p>"Are there not more vinegar drinkers that wish to learn from an old Roman
  the manners of old Rome?" asked Torquatus, sneeringly.</p>

  <p>How the fight, once begun, would have ended seemed hardly uncertain, for
  the crowd filled all the neighbouring streets: half were drunk, and nearly
  half were provided with arms of some sort, many of them such as were
  warranted by no pretext of law, save the knowledge that Varro was consul, and
  the belief that he would protect his adherents in whatever breach might
  please them. The dangerous front of Torquatus and his company might have
  sufficed to check those who would have to lead a rush, but they,
  unfortunately, had the least to say on the subject of giving battle. Already
  the mobs, pouring in from the side streets at the first scent of a brawl,
  were pushing the forlorn hope, all unwilling, to its fate; three or four had
  already gone down with broken heads, and a freedman of Torquatus had been
  stabbed in the side, when, above the tumult, rose a voice crying:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Make way for the Consul, Paullus! Way! way!"</p>

  <p>The matter, truly, was becoming serious, thought the outskirts of the
  mob&mdash; all of them who could hear the shout. A brush with the fiercest,
  the most hated, the most hating aristocrat that had been borne behind the
  fasces for many a year, would mean punishment with a heavy hand. The pressure
  was at once relieved, and though those in front saw no sign of consul or
  lictor&mdash;saw only Sergius who had descended from his litter and was
  leading his company in a vigorous attack&mdash;yet they were, for the most
  part, only too glad to escape from the glaring eyes of Titus Manlius and the
  broad sweep of his weapon. The old man was puffing hard from the unwonted
  exertion when Sergius reached his side through the fast-scattering
  assailants.</p>

  <p>"The gods have punished my blasphemy with kindness," began Torquatus, "in
  sending my Lord Paullus in such timely fashion."</p>

  <p>"Say, rather, my father, in sending his name into the mind of one Lucius
  Sergius," said Sergius, laughing.</p>

  <p>For a moment the other frowned with a puzzled look; then his face cleared,
  with as close an approach to a smile as it could wear.</p>

  <p>"And our rescue is not due to the consul, then?" he asked, still slow to
  fully grasp the ruse.</p>

  <p>"To the consul's name and to the favouring cunning of Mercury," said
  Sergius, bowing.</p>

  <p>"Truly, you should command," exclaimed Torquatus. "A general so ready in
  craft as you are might hope to match the African&mdash;and, by the gods! no
  one else seems able to. Come, let us go on to my house."</p>

  <p>Though harshly said, and in tones that one less acquainted with the
  speaker might well have mistaken for sarcasm, Sergius knew that the
  compliment was genuine. The aged patrician had turned and strode away, as he
  finished speaking, and etiquette left to the younger man no choice but to pay
  to the elder the reverence of his escort. That he had asked what he might
  well have looked for as a matter of course, was something of a condescension,
  according to the strict ceremoniousness of the ancient usage; therefore
  Sergius hurried on and overtook him, offering his litter, at which the other
  sniffed contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"May the gods grant me to lie at rest by the Appian Way, before I require
  such feet!" Then, as his sharp eyes noted the flush upon Sergius' face, he
  added: "Fever, wounds, and death may pardon effeminacy; and, truly, I would
  beg you to accompany me as you came, were it not that a climb up the Palatine
  should bring new health to one who could run ten miles with a broken
  shoulder. Believe me, my friend, the dictator thought better of you than he
  spoke, and would have regretted the axe. Jupiter grant that it be yours to
  justify his opinion!"</p>

  <p>No stimulant could have given such strength to the convalescent as did
  these words, and from such a source. The dictator had not condemned, then; he
  had even spoken well of him. The knowledge of it put to flight the
  embarrassment he had felt when he realized that he was going perforce to
  Marcia's house&mdash;perhaps into her presence; and he found himself standing
  straighter and stepping out with longer and bolder strides.</p>

  <p>"Good words are better than bad ones for a good man," mused Torquatus,
  wagging his head sententiously, and darting at his companion a comprehensive
  glance, behind which lurked a grim smile. "If women could ever learn as much,
  they might govern us the more readily&mdash; which the gods forefend! as I
  doubt not they will."</p>

  <p>Then the company halted. It was many months since Sergius had stood before
  that door, and he could not, without grave discourtesy, refuse the invitation
  to enter. Well, what mattered it? Marcia cared nothing; why should he? Then,
  too, the stimulus of the dictator's approval was still upon him, as the
  warning cry of the porter bade those nearest stand back while the door swung
  out. Most of the party took their leave here, but several followed into the
  atrium for adieus more appropriate to their station.</p>

  <p>At last all had departed save Sergius, who, having given orders that his
  attendants should await him in the street, passed on into the peristyle with
  his host.</p>

  <p>There, beside the fountain, spinning, as he had so often seen her&mdash;as
  he had seen her through all the days and nights of the campaign&mdash;sat the
  lady Marcia. Two of her maidens were assisting: one who glanced up at Sergius
  and smiled tauntingly; and another who turned her face away, and seemed to be
  trying to hide it in the close inspection of a great bunch of fleece. But
  both the forwardness of the one and the bashfulness of the other were wasted
  upon the visitor. As a matter of fact, he was so lost in wonder at his
  courage and self-control as to be well past observing the idiosyncrasies of
  slaves; and, if his own attitude was acceptable, even to himself, his
  admiration for that of his hostess amounted to absolute bitterness. That she,
  a mere girl, should rise and come forward with so conventional yet friendly a
  greeting, that neither her lip should tremble nor her cheek flush, was little
  short of intolerable. Nevertheless it helped to brace his own resolves yet
  more firmly. Such poise, after all that had been between them, could have its
  source only in the most absolute indifference.</p>

  <p>"Health to the noble Lucius! Let him believe that there is no one of his
  friends who thanks the gods more fervently for his recovery."</p>

  <p>On its face the speech was cordial&mdash;much too cordial for love that
  has quarrelled; therefore he bent his head and answered:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Were it not impiety, the noble Lucius would thank his well-wisher for her
  words, more, even, than he thanks the gods for his recovery."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" she replied lightly, "then he must scatter his thanks yet more
  broadly, for there cannot be a defenceless woman in Rome who does not rejoice
  that so brave a defender is spared to the State."</p>

  <p>Sarcasm for sarcasm, he thought bitterly, but he answered as
  carelessly:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"In that case, I shall not bear my thanks beyond the gods; for if my
  health be no greater care to you than to all the white stoles in the city, I
  think I can measure its value."</p>

  <p>An expression of almost infantile surprise and reproach crossed her
  features.</p>

  <p>"You are either very forgetful or very ungrateful," she said. "If Venus
  has healed so faithful a votary, surely mortal women have not been lacking in
  their sympathy; nor, if report tells truly, has the noble Lucius been lacking
  in gratitude&mdash;until now."</p>

  <p>That shaft struck home, and, for a moment, Sergius could find no answer.
  He could only remember the episode of the girl who had come to him, and
  wonder which one of his household could have borne treacherous word to Marcia
  of his weakness and his discomfiture. Meanwhile she had turned carelessly and
  dismissed her women, and one had gone, throwing back laughing glances, the
  other, with her face still buried in the wool with which she had filled her
  arms.</p>

  <p>Torquatus had been standing near, somewhat puzzled by what he felt to be a
  battle of words between his daughter and his guest, but a battle whose plans
  of attack or defence he found himself at a loss to fathom. Feeling at last
  that it was incumbent upon him as host to break in upon badinage that bade
  fair to become embarrassing, he spoke briefly of his encounter with the mob
  and of Lucius' timely aid and clever ruse. Marcia listened closely, nodding
  her head from time to time, but her colour had deepened and her hand was
  clenched tight when the story was finished.</p>

  <p>"Who will be safe in Rome, father!" she burst out. "The rabble elect their
  magistrates, and the magistrates, in return, let them do as they please. When
  it comes to attacking you; a consular&mdash;a Manlius! We must sleep no more
  in our houses unless the household be in arms and on guard."</p>

  <p>Sergius gazed in astonishment. A Marcia spoke whom he had never known; but
  the old man smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"It is the blood," he said. "She is truly 'Manlia,' though called, against
  custom, for my dead Marcius. When Claudians change the toga for the
  paludamentum, and Ogulnians cease to babble of Greek philosophy, then shall a
  Manlian be lacking in the spirit of our order&mdash; ay, and in the courage
  to act."</p>

  <p>Marcia did not seem to hear his words. Her brows were drawn together in
  what Sergius considered a very pretty frown. She turned toward him.</p>

  <p>"They have gotten their butcher for consul," she went on; "now let him
  lead them. How long before they will be begging for the swords they have
  despised! Let them alone! Let Hannibal work his will; then we shall stand
  forth, like the exiled Camillus, to defend a Rome purged of its black
  blood&mdash;a Rome worth defending&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Sergius had recovered from his surprise, and his face was serious, as
  he interrupted the torrent of words.</p>

  <p>"Patrician and plebeian must stand or fall together, my Marcia," he said
  quietly. "It is the Republic that we shall defend, and defend the more
  bravely because it is, in a way, defenceless. If a time of madness come upon
  a parent, do we not guard her the more tenderly who cannot guard
  herself?&mdash;ay, and even against the foolish acts she may herself
  attempt?"</p>

  <p>"And you&mdash;you&mdash;a Sergius, will serve under this Varro?" she
  exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Truly," he said bowing, "I am a Roman, and the barbarians are in Italy.
  When they are gone, I will fight Varro on the rostra, in the Senate. Perhaps
  I shall even lead my clients to drag him, stabbed, from his house."</p>

  <p>She was gazing at him with great, round eyes in which the contempt and
  anger began to give place to a softer look&mdash;a look which no man might
  hope quite to interpret; then she threw her head to one side and laughed, but
  the laugh was short and nervous.</p>

  <p>"I congratulate your eloquence and patriotism, as I sympathize with your
  unpropitious gallantry. May Venus make happy your next pursuit of a pretty
  slave."</p>

  <p>Again she laughed, and this time her laugh was unfeignedly malicious.
  Sergius flushed crimson; Torquatus looked scandalized and stern; but before
  either could answer, she was gone.</p>

  <p>"You will return to the army, then?" said the old man, hurriedly and as if
  to cover his annoyance. "How soon will your strength be sufficient?"</p>

  <p>"I shall set out to-night," said Sergius. The flush had gone from his
  face, and he was very pale, while his voice sounded as if from far away. "By
  so doing I shall journey by easier stages, and shall avoid accompanying the
  consul; nor will he reach the camp before me."</p>

  <p>"There is talk of new levies," said Torquatus, vaguely.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and there will be fighting soon."</p>

  <p>"Flaminius fought."</p>

  <p>"May Jupiter avert the omen! and you will forgive me, my father, if I bid
  you a too hasty farewell? I had not determined to go so soon&mdash;but it is
  best. And there is preparation to be made."</p>

  <p>Torquatus followed him silently to the door, and watched the light of his
  torches till it died out below the hill; then he shook his head with a
  puzzled, sad expression.</p>

  <p>"Yes, truly," he said; "let the omen be lacking."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap113"
     name="chap113">XIII. &mdash; THE RED FLAG</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE red flag fluttered in the breeze above the tent of
  Varro.</p>

  <p>Months had come and gone since the plebeians had triumphed in the Field of
  Mars; months of weary lying in camp, months of anxious watching, months of
  marches and countermarches. Contrary to the expectations of Sergius, neither
  of the new consuls had gone straight to the legions, and the pro-consuls,
  Servilius and Regulus, remained in command. Paullus had busied himself in
  preparing for the coming spring, levying new men and new legions, and
  directing from the city a policy not unlike that of Fabius; while Varro, on
  the other hand, as if maddened by his sudden elevation, rushed from Senate
  House to Forum and from Forum to every corner where a mob could congregate;
  everywhere rolling his eyes and waving his hands, now shrieking frantic
  denunciations against the selfish, the criminal, the traitorous nobles who
  had brought the war to Italy and sustained it there by their wicked
  machinations and contemptible cowardice; now congratulating his hearers that
  the people had at last taken the conspirators by the throat and had elected a
  fearless consul, an incorruptible consul, an able consul, one who would soon
  show the world that there were men outside of the three tribes. Then he would
  fall to mapping out his campaign&mdash;a different plan for each cluster of
  gaping listeners, but each ending in such a slaughter of invaders as Italy
  had never seen, and a picture of the long triumph winding up the Sacred Way,
  of Hannibal disappearing forever within the yawning jaws of the Tullianum. At
  times, when his imagination ran riot most, he went so far as to depict with
  what luxuriance the corn would grow on the farm of that happy man whose land
  should be selected by the great consul, the plebeian consul, the consul
  Varro, for his slaughter of the enemies of the Roman people.</p>

  <p>To these harangues Paullus and the nobles listened in wonder and
  disgust&mdash; even in terror; and when, at length, the consuls set out to
  take command of the greatest army Rome had ever put into the field, the story
  was passed from mouth to mouth of how Fabius had spoken with Paullus and
  warned him that he must now do battle against two commanders: Hannibal and
  his own colleague; and of how Paullus had answered in words that told more of
  foreboding than of hope.</p>

  <p>Even the Senate seemed to have fallen under the coarse spell of this
  mouthing ranter. News had come that Hannibal was at Cannae, had seized upon
  the Roman stores in the citadel there; that, strongly posted, he was scouring
  the country in all directions; that the allies could not be expected to stand
  another season of ravage; and so, when the consuls set out to take command of
  the legions, it was with the express direction of the fathers to give battle
  on the first favourable opportunity.</p>

  <p>Still, there was room left them for some discretion, and when Paullus had
  viewed the country along the banks of the Aufidus, level as it lay and open
  to the sweep of cavalry, his soldier eye told him that the opportunity was
  not here, and that, with a short delay, the enemy must, in the lack of safe
  forage, retire to more favourable ground.</p>

  <p>Then followed quarrels and denunciations and furious mouthings; but Varro
  did not neglect to use one day of his command to lead the army forward to a
  point between the Carthaginians and the sea, whence it would be impossible
  for Paullus to hope to withdraw them safely in the face of the foe.</p>

  <p>It was on the first of Sextilis that Hannibal offered battle; but this was
  Paullus' day, and he had lain quiet in camp, "Sulking," as his colleague
  exultantly put it, "because a plebeian's generalship had kept another
  do-nothing patrician commander from running away." Then the next morning
  broke&mdash;Varro's day&mdash;and the red flag fluttered from the spear above
  Varro's tent.</p>

  <p>A group of men were gathered before the quarters occupied by certain of
  the special cavalry: mounted volunteers, for the most part of rank, who
  served out of respect to the consul, Paullus. Fully armed, with horses held
  near by, they were already prepared to ride out at the word, and they
  listened to the din of preparation going on on every side, and watched the
  crimson signal of battle that now flapped lazily in the wind and again hung
  limp against its staff.</p>

  <p>"The butcher has his way at last," remarked a youth who had scarce offered
  up his first beard; but the man he addressed, Marcus Decius, growled in
  reply:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Wait, only wait, my little master, and we shall see who is the butcher
  and who is the fat steer."</p>

  <p>"But," put in another of the company, "have you not heard that our camp
  beyond the stream had no water yesterday? that the Numidians cut them off
  from it? Doubtless we are to cross over to its relief."</p>

  <p>Decius rose from his buckler, upon which he had been resting, and swept
  his arm out across the country.</p>

  <p>"All one," he said; "water or blood; this bank or that! Look! No room for
  our infantry to spread out; level ground for their horse to sweep clean. You
  have never been close to the Numidians, my master?" and he pointed to the
  scar across his forehead. "They ride fast and strike hard&mdash;when the
  country pleases them."</p>

  <p>The boy laughed carelessly, but said nothing, while he who had spoken
  third hesitated a moment and frowned. Then he said in a lower
  voice:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You are an old soldier, Marcus,&mdash;a head decurion once,&mdash;and you
  would do better than try to terrify men of less experience."</p>

  <p>Decius ground his teeth, and his eyes flashed, but he lowered his voice
  when he replied:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I thank you, Caius Manlius, for the reminder; and I also may recall to
  you that I am neither the only nor the highest officer who is serving as
  volunteer to-day, because Varro must have legions commanded by butchers and
  bakers and money-lenders. I, too, am a plebeian, and I cast my pebble for my
  order (whereat the infernal gods are doubtless now rejoicing); but I am also,
  as you say, an old soldier, and hold the camp to be no place for the tricks
  of the Forum. As for frightening recruits, if words and the sight of old
  scars will frighten them, they had best ride north to-day hard and fast."</p>

  <p>Manlius' face flushed at the reminder of his own lost command, and, as if
  by consent, both men glanced over at another who stood near them, leaning on
  his spear. Drawn by the centred attention of the two, Lucius Sergius turned
  from his inspection of the rising mists, beyond which lay the Carthaginian
  forces, and looked silently and sadly at his friends: Manlius, the brother of
  his mistress, parted from him for a while by petty embarrassments and diverse
  duties, but, for the last days, closer than ever in kindred service and
  fellowship; and Decius, the sturdy comrade of the Campanian raid, the man who
  talked, now like Ulysses, now like Thersites, but who always fought like
  Diomed; the very Nisus who had saved his life. It seemed, too, as if the
  others understood the import of his glance, for Decius turned away
  ostentatiously, and sought to arrange the leathern straps of his corselet
  skirt, while Manlius strode over and grasped Sergius' hand.</p>

  <p>"The butcher showed us better favour than he intended, when he put others
  in our commands," he said gayly. "We shall fight side by side, and perhaps my
  sister may be pleased to play the siren no longer. Besides, I am well
  satisfied to be free from any of the responsibilities of this day."</p>

  <p>"Marcia is no songstress of the rock, my Caius," said Sergius, half sadly,
  half playfully; "unless her heart be the rock from which she sings&mdash;a
  rock to me; but the gods have given men other things, when women do not
  choose to love:&mdash;things that will serve to stir us today. Afterward we
  shall be still." Then, noting that the young man who had first addressed
  Decius was now watching their talk with troubled face, he raised his voice
  cheerfully. "Tribune or volunteer, it is all one to me. Do we not serve under
  Aemilius Paullus and his Illyrian auspices? After this day, friends, we shall
  see no more pulse-eaters in Italy."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a blast of trumpets rang clear, above the noise of preparation;
  lieutenants dashed hither and thither, their legs bent along their horses'
  sides; several cohorts marched past, to man the rampart nearest the foe,
  while from behind came the louder rattle of arms, and the earth shook under
  the tread of the legions, pressing on through the porta dextra, and spreading
  out in three great columns that plunged down the slope into the Aufidus, and
  rose again, and pushed out into the plain on its southern bank. Hastati,
  principes, triarii&mdash;they marched in order of battle, ready to face about
  at the moment of attack, while, as they deployed, the famished Romans across
  the river swarmed down, under shelter of the protecting lines, and, lying
  thick in the turbid water below, drank as if their parched tongues and lips
  would never soften.</p>

  <p>The morning mists were clearing. Strange sounds and rumblings came also
  from the south and west, and the red flag hung limp upon the spear.</p>

  <p>Still the legions streamed on, but no orders had come to the special
  volunteers, and Sergius began to wonder whether they were to be left to guard
  the camp, as an added indignity to their rank. He ascended the rampart, with
  Manlius and Decius, and strove to pierce the distance in the west. Now and
  then a broad flash of light seemed to shine before his eyes, and ever there
  came to his ears the rumble of tramping thousands; the dust, too, was
  thickening, to take the place of the scattered mists, and the wind blew it up
  in blinding clouds into the face of Rome's battle.</p>

  <p>"Gods! what is Terrentius Varro doing!" cried Decius suddenly, and the
  three turned at his voice. A nodding forest of crests, red and black, rising
  a cubit above the uncovered helmets of the legionaries, seemed to fill the
  eastern plain and extend almost to where the Adriatic beat upon the shingle.
  "Look at his front! Look at how closely the maniples are crushed together!
  Gods! they are almost 'within the rails' already."</p>

  <p>Sergius looked, and the frown upon his brow deepened.</p>

  <p>"Eighty thousand men," he muttered; "and we shall scarce outflank their
  forty thousand. Does Varro wish to cast aside every advantage! Gods! what
  gain is there in such depth? and he might&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Evidently you do not understand the strategy of great commanders who have
  studied war."</p>

  <p>The voice that interrupted was cynical and scornful, to a degree that men
  hated the speaker even before they saw him; and, when the three wheeled
  quickly, his face gave nothing to dispel the bad impression. A tall, gaunt
  man, in plain and somewhat battered armour; a face sharp-featured, very
  dark, and deeply lined wherever the wrinkles lay that expressed pride and
  contempt and violent passions; lowering brows from beneath which shone little
  beady, cunning eyes that opponents feared and distrusted: this was Lucius
  Aemilius Paullus, the conqueror of Illyria, the man who had barely escaped
  conviction for his peculations, the colleague of Varro the butcher, a
  patrician of the bluest blood in Rome, a knave in pecuniary matters, selfish
  and ungoverned, but a brave and wary soldier from cothurni to crest.</p>

  <p>"You seem to be criticising a Roman consul: even my brother, Varro;" he
  said again, for the three had only bowed in reply to his former speech. "Are
  you not presumptuous?&mdash;you, Lucius Sergius; and you, Caius
  Manlius&mdash;boys in war&mdash;and you, Decius, or whoever you may
  be&mdash;a man of Varro's order, if I mistake not?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my father, I criticise," replied Sergius, at last, for the others
  said nothing.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you were thinking that he has extended his front too far?" said
  the consul, and there was infinite sarcasm in his tones.</p>

  <p>Sergius grew crimson under the taunting voice and the little, shifty
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"I have ventured to say," he replied haughtily, "that the consul, Varro,
  is not using our numbers as he might. As you have noted, the front <i>is</i>
  contracted, where we might easily lash around their flank like the thongs of
  a scourge. Nevertheless had I known that the noble colleague of the general
  was near me, I would have restrained my words."</p>

  <p>"Ah! then you have doubtless grown more respectful of commanders since you
  disobeyed your dictator in Campania;" but now the anger in Sergius' face told
  the speaker that the limit of endurance had been reached, and his tone became
  less offensive. "That is in the old days, though, and you <i>did</i> run
  twelve miles with a broken shoulder: you see I know all&mdash; only I am sure
  that you are not realizing how deeply your general has studied the Punic
  wars, or perhaps you do not know how necessary is depth to the battle that
  would stand against the great war-beasts. It is possible, barely possible,
  that our most scientific commander has forgotten that the enemy has no
  elephants here; but what is that to a great genius? He has learned that
  Carthage wars with elephants, that these are best met by deepening the files,
  and that we are about to fight Carthage; therefore he deepens the files,
  though the last elephant in Italy died two years ago in the northern marshes.
  If you are beaten, you will at least have the satisfaction of being beaten
  while fighting most learnedly."</p>

  <p>As Sergius noted the bitterness and agony in the voice that spoke, he
  found his resentment giving place to pity for the hard, grim man who,
  powerless to avert, yet saw clearly every cord of the snare into which he was
  being driven.</p>

  <p>"Do we guard the camp, my father?" he asked, gently, when Paullus had
  finished.</p>

  <p>The latter started from the gloomy stare with which he was regarding the
  fast-forming lines.</p>

  <p>"I have been offered the command of the camp," he said, almost fiercely.
  "I have refused it. Escape to the north would be too easy&mdash;and I do not
  wish to escape. What do you think the centuries would do if I came home
  beaten? I who escaped so narrowly before?" He leered cunningly at his
  listeners; then his face grew set, and his voice cold and even. "I have
  solicited command of the Roman cavalry. We shall fight on the right wing,
  beside the river, and I do not think many of us will ride from the battle.
  Varro commands the cavalry of the allies on the left, and the
  pro-consuls"&mdash;he hesitated a moment&mdash;"the pro-consuls market their
  beeves in the centre. You will cross with me now. My volunteers ride about my
  body. It is time. It is time."</p>

  <p>The breeze from the southward freshened every minute, and the red flag
  lashed out angrily toward the sea.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap114"
     name="chap114">XIV. &mdash; CANNAE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE cavalry trumpets rang out their clear notes, and Sergius
  and his companions threw themselves upon their kneeling chargers. Then they
  rode out and down the bank, behind the consul who, with head hanging upon his
  breast, had turned his rein the moment he had given the word. What if the
  dust did swirl up in blinding sheets from the south? Before them lay the
  Roman battle, horse and foot&mdash;such an army as the city had never sent
  forth. What if its masses were somewhat cramped? its front narrow? its
  general an amateur? They were to fight at last, and how should a mongrel
  horde of barbarians, but half their number, stand firm against the impetus of
  such a shock. A moment's hush; then measured voices rose in calm
  cadence&mdash;the voices of the tribunes administering the military oath to
  each cohort, "Faithful to the senate, obedient to your imperator." What Roman
  could doubt that the voice of victory spoke in the thunderous response!</p>

  <p>And now the clangour of cymbals and the roll of drums came up on the
  breezes from the south, and, with them, a strange uproar of barbarous shouts
  and cries. Then it was that the Roman legionaries began to crash their heavy
  javelins against their great, oblong shields until the din drowned everything
  else, and the thunder of Jove himself might have roared in vain.</p>

  <p>Sergius had ridden up the bank, almost at the consul's rein, and his eyes
  wandered eagerly over Varro's array. Eight full legions with their quota of
  allies seemed welded into one huge column: Romans on the right, Italians on
  the left. The sun was well up, and its rays played upon a very sea of bronze
  from which the feathered crests rose and shivered like foam. Far beyond the
  column, on the extreme left, he could make out squadrons of allied horse, and
  then he turned to take his place amid the cavalry of the city: young men well
  born, burning with courage and ardour and wrath. Despite himself his heart
  rose with a leap of triumph. A moment later he caught the little, beady eyes
  of the consul looking through him, as it were, while the thin mouth beneath
  writhed itself into a sneer.</p>

  <p>"You hope? That is well," said Paullus. "Young men fight better and die
  better when they hope; but I will show you how a Roman soldier can give up
  his life for naught. I would wish," he added with lowered voice and speaking
  as if in self-communion, "that more of our horsemen had adopted the Greek
  arms. Reed spears and ox-hide bucklers will not stand long against heavy
  cavalry. A temple to Mars the avenger, if I had but a front of Illyrian
  horse! See now! There are the scum!"</p>

  <p>His voice rose eagerly at the last words, and Sergius turned from the dark
  face now flashing with a sudden animation, and looked southward over the
  plain. For a moment the dust was too thick; then it seemed to clear away, and
  the Carthaginian army burst into view.</p>

  <p>Undulating like the open sea and rolling steadily on like the long, slow
  sweep of billows upon a level shore, the glory of barbaric war drew near. On
  their left, resting upon the river's bank, rode the Spanish and Gallic
  cavalry, strengthened here and there by a horse and man in full armour like
  those of the Clinabarians; and the face of Paullus clouded again when he
  noted what opponents he must meet: men, horses, arms&mdash;all heavier than
  his own with the exception of a few turmae newly equipped in the Greek
  fashion. Beyond them, thrown back in echelon, marched Africans in little
  squares of sixteen front. These had substituted for their own equipment the
  Roman spoils of Trasimenus and Trebia. Then, and again somewhat in advance,
  came alternate companies of Gauls and Spaniards spread out in long thin
  array; the former stripped to the navel, their hair tied up in a tufted knot,
  and bearing their great swords upon their shoulders; the Spaniards glittering
  in their purple-bordered tunics of snowy linen. The waving pikes of phalanges
  told of more Africans who seemed to lie in echelon beyond, while far away,
  toward the low hills overgrown with copsewood that formed the eastern
  horizon, clouds of swift-moving dust, amid which shadows darted hither and
  thither at seeming random, marked the presence of the wild riders of Numidia
  who were to face the horsemen of Italy and of the Latin name. In front of
  all, the plain was dotted with naked men advancing at regular intervals and
  bearing small bucklers of lynx-hide&mdash;the famous Balearic slingers that
  always opened the day of battle for Carthage. The heart of Sergius swelled
  within him, beating hard and fast under the tension of the moment. Only a few
  minutes more, and those magnificent armies would crash together, not to part
  until the plain should be heaped with corpses that were now men; until the
  gods should adjudge the sovereignty of Italy. Then he grew calm, calm as the
  consul himself, and gazed enraptured upon the picture, as if it meant no more
  than art and show&mdash;only the wind came fresher from the south, and the
  fine dust, ground up by marching thousands, smarted and blinded his eyes.</p>

  <p>Nearer and nearer they drew, with steady, slow advance, while Rome stood
  still and awaited their coming. And now a commotion seemed to start from the
  far distant south: the roar of voices, the blinding flash of the sun on
  tossing swords, a cloud of dust distinct upon the plain, a clump of
  horse-head standards rising amid it, and a group of riders urging their
  galloping steeds along the invaders' front. Rich armour of strange pattern
  shone among them, and, a length ahead of the rest, Sergius could see a white
  stallion with close-cropped mane, and hoofs and fetlocks stained vermilion,
  that danced and curvetted and arched its proud neck under the touch of a
  master. He was not an over-tall man, but his figure as he rode seemed well
  knit and graceful. His armour was of brown-bronze scale-work, rich with gold
  and jewels, while a white mantle fringed with Tyrian purple hung from his
  shoulders; a helmet of burnished gold, horned and crested, gleamed like a
  star upon his head, while, even at the distance, even through the swirl, of
  dust, Sergius saw the crisp curled, black beard, and dreamed that he caught
  the flash of dark, deep-set eyes. There was no need of the beating of weapons
  against shields, no need of the roar and howls and shrill screaming in a
  score of tongues to tell the stranger's name. Most of the soldiers kept
  ranks, but here and there a Gaul would bound forward, dancing with strange
  leaps and whirling his sword about his head, to throw himself prone before
  and beneath the vermilion hoofs that never paused or swerved in their gallop.
  Not a movement, not a glance of the rider gave sign of acknowledgment or
  recognition; not a look was cast upon the grovelling form, safe or hurt or
  maimed&mdash;only the soldier's comrades howled their plaudits, mingled with
  laughter and rude jeers whenever the devotee lay still or writhed or rose
  staggering from some stroke of the vermilion hoofs.</p>

  <p>But when the horseman drew bridle before the extreme left of the centre,
  and, with eyes shaded by his hand, gazed long and earnestly at the Roman
  array, the plaudits that had greeted his passage died away into low murmurs
  and then silence. "The general is studying the enemy. Be silent! Who knows
  but he would commune with Baal and Moloch? Be silent!" So the word ran around
  and through the African squares.</p>

  <p>Suddenly peals of laughter broke from the group of Carthaginian officers
  that had ridden behind and who now clustered around him. The calm that no
  devotion, no suffering, no danger of men could move, was gone; the
  schalischim had turned from his measuring of the enemy to smile and jest with
  his friends. Thereupon they threw back their heads and laughed loud and long;
  and then the Africans noted it, and hoarse cries of joy broke from their
  ranks. "The schalischim must be sure of victory. Praise be to Melkarth!"
  Sergius saw a captain of one of the squares run out and touch his forehead to
  the earth before his commander; but no Roman heard the man's words pregnant
  with fate.</p>

  <p>"Now, my father, let The Lion's Brood lead the beasts of all the fields to
  their feast. We hunger, father, we hunger!"</p>

  <p>And Hannibal had made answer, pointing northward toward the plume-crested
  sea of blazing bronze, "Lo! friend; there are your meat and wine."</p>

  <p>Then a new roar of acclamation broke upward and rolled away to the east.
  Two richly armed riders parted from the group and dashed off: Maharbal, light
  and slender, bending far over his horse's neck, rode headlong in Numidian
  fashion to his Numidians; Hasdrubal, erect and dignified, galloped to head
  the Gaulish and Spanish horse upon the banks of Aufidus; trumpets, drums,
  cymbals, crashed out in mad, barbaric discords; and, with their horse-head
  standards tossing amid the forest of spears, the Carthaginian line drove
  forward to the attack.</p>

  <p>Running fast before the line of battle, Sergius could still make out, even
  through the dust, those same naked men with lynx-hide bucklers, dotting the
  plain at regular intervals, and each man's right arm seemed always whirling
  about his head. The Roman light troops had pushed on to skirmish, and now
  they began to fall back, though no arrow or javelin could have reached
  them&mdash;could have flown to the foe. Sergius watched in surprise their
  confusion and terror as they sought to plunge among the legionaries or hide
  themselves behind the horsemen; nor had they fled unscathed. Here a man ran
  by screaming and clasping his shattered hand to his breast; then another
  staggered up, with arm hanging broken at his side, while the big drops of
  blood fell slowly from his fingers; and yet a third appeared, pale and
  helpless, supported between two companions.</p>

  <p>Sounds, too, now dull and heavy, and again ringing and metallic, seemed to
  punctuate the roar of the advancing host. Sergius saw a horseman near him
  clap his hand to his forehead and plunge headlong to the earth: horses reared
  and snorted, some fell with ugly, red blotches on their breasts and throats;
  the clangour and the thuds came faster&mdash; faster; for now the clay and
  leaden bullets of the slingers fell in showers, like hailstones, and it was
  good armour that turned them.</p>

  <p>Manlius had leaped down to aid a friend who was reeling helplessly, with
  both eyes beaten out, and, a moment later, he approached Sergius, holding up
  a slinger's bullet. The red had sunken into the lines of the stamped
  inscription, and displayed them in hideous relief, "This to your back,
  sheep!"</p>

  <p>"That is always the way with barbarians," sneered Marcus Decius. "No blow
  without an insult&mdash;look! They shall have blows themselves, soon, that
  will need no insults to piece them out."</p>

  <p>Paullus had watched with eagerness, with anxiety, for the signal to
  advance. Varro seemed to hesitate, while the great masses of Rome, lashed by
  the bitter rain of the slings, writhed and groaned in anguish and rage; the
  light troops had disappeared, and the Balearians, now close at hand, leaped
  and slung without let or hindrance. Then it was that Paullus, waiting no
  longer, made a sign to his trumpeters. "Scatter me that rabble!" he cried,
  and the cavalry clarions raised their voices in one long, swelling peal of
  sound.</p>

  <p>"Close! close!" rose the shout of battle, and the Roman horse dashed
  forward into the dust cloud&mdash;forward upon the slingers that suddenly
  were not there, had vanished, as it were, into the earth itself.</p>

  <p>The straight trumpets and curved horns of the legions were ringing behind
  them, stirred to life at last, but the horsemen did not hear. What were those
  looming up ahead? Not naked slingers&mdash;armoured cavalry! Hasdrubal with
  his Gauls and Spaniards were before them&mdash;upon them; and all sense and
  volition were lost in the terrific shock.</p>

  <p>Line after line went down, as if at touch, while fresh lines poured on
  over the heaving mass of men and horses, until those who were face to face
  seemed to fight upon a hill. Fiercer grew the pressure, tighter and more
  dense the throng; horses, crushed together, powerless to move, snorted and
  tossed their heads in terror, while the riders leaned forward and grappled
  with those opposite. Weapons first, then hands clutching at throats were
  doing the deadly work, and the dead, man and horse, stood fast amid the
  press, unable even to fall and become merged into the hideous, purple thing
  beneath their feet.</p>

  <p>Mere weight, though, was beginning to tell. The human ridge that had
  marked the joining of battle seemed far back among the enemy, and squadron
  after squadron, in close array, breasted its top and plunged down to mingle
  with the living or take their places among the dead. The Romans were giving
  ground, slowly, stubbornly, but unmistakably, and still, above the shouts and
  shrieks, the trampling and the clash of weapons, the groans and the hard,
  short breathing, they could hear the harsh voice of the consul, Paullus,
  urging his men to make battle firmly.</p>

  <p>Backward, steadily backward; and now, in one of those mad rushes, in which
  men who seemed immovably wedged were swirled about like the water in a
  maelstrom, Sergius found himself close to the consul, with Manlius but a few
  paces in front. The thin, cruel lips had writhed away from the white teeth,
  the helmet was gone, and the scant, black hair was dabbled with blood that
  flowed from a slight cut upon the general's brow; the snake-like eyes sought
  those of the young patrician with a look wherein exultation and despair were
  strangely mingled.</p>

  <p>"To the earth! to the earth, all!" he cried, at the same moment plunging
  his sword into his horse's throat, and lighting firmly on his feet, as the
  animal sank suddenly down. "We <i>must</i> stand. Gods! where are the
  legions? Clashing shields and waving javelins, while we are cut to pieces!
  Gods! they shall pay for it!" Then he drew close to Sergius' ear and
  whispered as calmly as if in the praetorium: "Learn, now, a lesson of war, my
  son. Hannibal destroys us piecemeal, choosing where he is strong and we are
  weak, while Varro allows <i>his</i> strength to stand and rest and wait for
  its turn to come. Down! down all!"</p>

  <p>Outnumbered, outarmed, borne down and back, the Roman cavalry still
  fought, but the press had grown looser, the mass less dense; and now, at the
  word of the consul, all that could hear his voice obeyed the order of
  despair, ancient as the day of Lake Regillus. Man after man sprang to earth.
  Here was freer swing for weapons, here was surer foothold, better chance to
  stand fast, and, for a moment, the thronging foe seemed to recoil before the
  determined onslaught.</p>

  <p>But it was not recoil. It was only the devouring of the foremost by that
  red monster underneath. Who could recoil, with the squadrons still pouring
  on, over the hill of corpses behind? Beaten, a man could but die in his
  place, and that much they did. Many, too, had followed the Roman example,
  leaping from their steeds and fighting hand to hand, till the cavalry battle
  had changed into a thousand combats of man against man.</p>

  <p>It was here that Caius Manlius fell. Sergius was but a few feet from him
  when he saw the youth sway gently, and, bowing his head, sink down. He had
  made an effort to push to his side, and then the front of the enemy seemed to
  receive some new impetus and surged forward over the spot. What mattered it?
  He had seen the red spear point peeping out between his friend's shoulders.
  He was dead, as they would all soon be, and the couch was purple and
  kinglike. At that moment, he felt his arm gripped hard, and turned to look
  into the consul's face.</p>

  <p>"Do you not see it is over?" said Paullus, sharply.</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"We are falling back&mdash;<i>forced</i> back&mdash;faster and faster. We
  are where we first stood. Do you see that sapling by the river? I marked it
  before we rode out. Soon we shall break; come!"</p>

  <p>"Where?" asked Sergius.</p>

  <p>"Where there may yet be hope, if the gods will it,&mdash;if they strike
  down Varro: the centre, the legions. I do not believe they have fairly
  advanced their standards yet."</p>

  <p>"Do we fly?" and, as he spoke, Sergius frowned darkly.</p>

  <p>"Fool! We <i>fight</i>. Later, perhaps, we shall die, but not here. In the
  <i>centre</i>&mdash;"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, a new, swirling rush seemed to carry them away, still
  together, first with furious violence, then more slowly.</p>

  <p>"Ah! it has come," said the consul, quietly. "This way. The dust is
  blinding, but I think the sun is behind us." Pushing on and striking right
  and left as he went, Aemilius Paullus fought a pathway through flying and
  pursuing men. Sergius followed and once, when he saw the consul cut down the
  boy who had stood near and talked to them that morning, he stopped still and
  shuddered.</p>

  <p>Paullus paused and laughed at him over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"A flying man in the path of a general is much worse than a dead one," he
  said. "Besides, none of them can save his life in that direction&mdash;so it
  is nothing."</p>

  <p>At that moment, indeed, the prophecy that no man of the Roman cavalry
  would escape, seemed fair for fulfilment. Few fought on, and these were soon
  ridden down, while Gauls and Spaniards thundered upon the rear of such as
  sought safety of the rein, and slew them with steady, measured strokes. Only
  the consul with perhaps a dozen others were, for the time, safe. They were
  clear of the rout; within the protecting reach of the great, legionary
  column, that was but just beginning to move, and they turned, gasping for
  breath, and, with dazed eyes, watched the flight and pursuit sweep by along
  the river bank.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap115"
     name="chap115">XV. &mdash; "WITHIN THE RAILS."</a></h2><br>

  <p>It was then that Sergius first realized that Caius Manlius, his friend,
  the brother of Marcia, was indeed dead; but the time for such thoughts ivas
  short. Clenching his teeth in a paroxysm of anger, he again turned to follow
  Paullus and Decius, who had passed into the ranks of the legions and joined
  themselves to the personal volunteers of the pro-consul, Servilius.</p>

  <p>The great column was moving now, steadily gathering impetus, and there was
  little speech between the generals. Servilius gazed with gloomy brows at the
  consul and the half dozen men that remained to him, and no question as to the
  fate of the right wing was asked or answered.</p>

  <p>"How fight they on the left?" asked Paullus, after a moment's pause.</p>

  <p>"The allies skirmish with the Numidians," replied Servilius.</p>

  <p>"You mean that the Numidians skirmish with them," said Paullus.</p>

  <p>That was all, and the two soldiers turned to their task.</p>

  <p>The slingers' bullets fell no longer, or only scattering ones, dropping
  from above, told that these hornets had fallen back and sought refuge behind
  their lines; but the roar of battle rolled furiously from the front.</p>

  <p>"It is the standards that oppose at last," commented Paullus. "The ranks
  are not too close&mdash;yet. Let us go forward."</p>

  <p>Servilius protested, but the other waved him back.</p>

  <p>"Here is <i>your</i> place who command, my Servilius," said the consul;
  and a smile, sad rather than bitter, lit up the harsh lines of his face. "It
  is I, having no command, who can justly ply the sword."</p>

  <p>Sergius followed, and in a few moments the increasing pandemonium told
  that the front was not far ahead. The dust filled their eyes, and they could
  see nothing beyond; but the signs were for the veteran to read. Soon there
  was no more headway to be made through the dense mass; the corpses of the
  slain were thick beneath their feet, half-naked Gauls and Spaniards in white
  and purple mingled with the dead of the legions, and still the column pushed
  forward and still the slain lay closer.</p>

  <p>"They give ground. We are driving in their centre," gasped Sergius.</p>

  <p>Paullus had been frowning grimly, but now he turned to Marcus Decius and
  showed his wolfish teeth in his old-time smile.</p>

  <p>"What do you say, decurion?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"We drive them, surely; but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, truly, <i>but</i>&mdash;do you hear those cries on the flank? We
  drive their Iberians, their Celts; it is the Africans that let us plunge on
  like one of Varro's stupid bulls: then they put the sword in our side. Could
  you fight now? I tell you we are already driven within the rails. If the gods
  keep Hasdrubal slaying my runaways, there may be hope; if he be a general,
  there is none."</p>

  <p>And still the column's headway seemed hardly checked, though the cries and
  the clashing of arms resounded, now, from both flanks as well as from the
  front, while, in the depths of its vitals, men were crushed together till
  they could scarce breathe. A rumour, too, like those Pan sends to dismay
  soldiers, ran quickly from heart to heart, rather than from lip to lip. It
  was that Hasdrubal had circled the rear and, falling upon the allied cavalry,
  had scattered the left wing as he had the right; that the Numidians pursued
  and slaughtered: but where now were the cavalry of Gaul and Spain, the
  winners of two victories? A sullen roar from the far distant rear seemed to
  answer; but the language was one that few could read&mdash;few of that host.
  Oh! for an hour of the veterans that slumbered on the shores of Trebia and
  Trasimenus! Oh! for an hour of Fabius, who lingered at Rome, powerless and
  discredited. Who were these that wore the armour, that wielded the ponderous
  javelins of Rome's legions? From under the bronze helmets gorgeously fierce
  with their great crests peered eyes&mdash;stupid, wondering eyes dazed by the
  uproar, blinded by the dust; eyes wherein, while as yet there was little of
  fear, still less was there of the knowledge of danger to be met and overcome;
  eyes that had but lately watched sheep upon the Alban hills, eyes that were
  used only to the flour dust when their owners kneaded dough behind the
  Forum.</p>

  <p>Ahead, around, the standards were tossing as if upon the billows of an
  angry sea. Was that a silver horse's head that flashed far to the right?</p>

  <p>"Look!" cried Sergius, striking Decius with his elbow.</p>

  <p>"You can see better now," muttered the veteran. "The flour is bread, and
  the bread of battle is mire kneaded of dust and blood."</p>

  <p>The eyes of Paullus were turned upward in strange prayer.</p>

  <p>"Grant me not, O Jupiter, my life this day!"</p>

  <p>It needed no eye of veteran to read the sentence that was writ. Driven, at
  last, within the rails, as went the saying, there was no room in all that
  weltering mass to use the sword, much less the pilum. On every side the
  barbarians of Africa, of Spain, of Gaul raged and slew&mdash;for even advance
  now was checked, and the Celts had turned and lashed the front with their
  great swords that rose and fell, crimson to the hilt, crimson to the
  shoulder, crimson to every inch of their wielders' huge bodies. The
  Spaniards, too, were stabbing fast and furiously, while all along both flanks
  the African squares, between which the weight of the column had forced its
  narrow length, thrust with their long sarissas and rained their pila upon the
  doomed monster in their midst: a war elephant, wounded to the death, with
  sides hung with javelins and streaming with blood, rocking and trumpeting in
  helpless agony.</p>

  <p>Sergius watched the dull, hopeless look deepening in the eyes of the young
  soldiers. They reminded him of the beeves in the shambles of the elder Varro.
  Even the voice of Pan could not wake such men. Were they not there to die for
  the traditions of Rome? It was true that every path leading to Pan's country
  bristled with spears, but only a few could fully know this, and these awaited
  their turn with the rest.</p>

  <p>The press seemed to loosen somewhat. Perhaps the assailants had drawn back
  to gain breath for a final onslaught; but, instinctively, the staggering
  lines of the Roman column opened out into the space afforded, and its four
  faces writhed forward bravely, pitifully. It was then that Sergius saw the
  consul for the last time. He had turned back from where he had forced his way
  to the head of the column; his arms were battered and blood-stained, and he
  reeled painfully in his saddle, for Paullus had mounted again, that he might
  the better be seen by the legionaries. His wandering eyes took in every
  detail of their hopeless plight; the last sparks of fire seemed to die out in
  him, and his head drooped upon his chest. Then, slowly, he dismounted, having
  ordered his horse to kneel, and the beast, unable to rise again, rolled over
  on its side. Paullus watched it with almost an expression of pity, and then
  dragged himself to a flat rock and sat down.</p>

  <p>Decius had sought to aid him, but the other thrust him rudely back. "It is
  only the smaller bone," he said. "One of their accursed stingers hit me."</p>

  <p>At that moment a rider covered with foam and dust and blood dashed up to
  the group and, reining his steaming animal to its haunches, leaped to the
  ground.</p>

  <p>Paullus raised his eyes.</p>

  <p>"It is time for you to escape, Cneius Lentulus," he said. "You have a
  horse."</p>

  <p>"It is for you, my father; that this day be not further darkened by the
  death of a consul. My horse is good, and there are still gaps between their
  squadrons. Ride to the east&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And you?"</p>

  <p>"I am but a tribune."</p>

  <p>"And a young man, my Cneius. Where is Varro?"</p>

  <p>"Fled."</p>

  <p>"And the pro-consuls?"</p>

  <p>"Both fallen."</p>

  <p>"And you would have it said, my Cneius, that the Republic degenerates?
  that not one of this year's consuls dares die with his men, while both of
  last year's were Romans? Truly, it would be a much darker day should I escape
  with Varro than if I die with Regulus and Servilius; besides, I have no
  humour for further charges and trials, in order that the rabble may vindicate
  their favourite butcher. But do you go, Cneius, and tell them that you have
  seen me sitting in my colleague's shambles."</p>

  <p>There were tears in Lentulus' eyes, and he still strove to persuade his
  general to accept the horse, but, at that moment, new shoutings and clashing
  of arms announced what must prove the final attack.</p>

  <p>"They come again, my father," said Decius calmly.</p>

  <p>The roar of battle swelled up, all about the doomed column. In front and
  flanks, Africans, Gauls, and Spaniards charged in unbroken lines, and soon
  forced the deploying but weakened maniples back into their weltering mass; in
  the rear, the attack was less continuous, for Hasdrubal's horsemen were
  exhausted with slaying, and he hurled them in alternate squadrons, now on
  this point, now on that, wherever the Roman line showed relics of strength or
  firmness. So the front worked back, driven by sheer weight in the direction
  where the pressure was least.</p>

  <p>Paullus still sat, with drooping head, faint with fatigue and loss of
  blood, while Decius, Sergius, and Lentulus stood by him, helplessly awaiting
  the end. A rush of fugitives swept by and almost overwhelmed the wounded man;
  but Decius passed his arm around him, and the press slackened.</p>

  <p>"It is time for you to mount and ride, Cneius Lentulus;" and the consul
  raised his head again, while the old-time spirit of command flashed in his
  eyes. "You shall be my envoy to the fathers. Bid them fortify and garrison
  the city; go&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A new rush broke in upon his words,&mdash;a rush, in which the whole front
  was borne back a spear's length beyond them. Sergius was thrown down, but
  some one raised him, dazed and stunned, and seemed to bear him along. A
  moment, and he found himself standing once more upon his feet. Cneius
  Lentulus and his horse were gone; Paullus and Marcus Decius were left alone
  far beyond&mdash;no, not alone. He saw the tunics of the Iberians, now all as
  purple as their borders, thronging around; he saw his general and his comrade
  give their throats to the sharp, slender swords; and then he saw, far ahead,
  amid the Carthaginian syntagmata, a swarthy, smiling face with crisp, curling
  beard; he saw the brown-bronze corselet rich with gold, the meteor helmet
  with ostrich plumes floating between its horns, the snowy mantle bordered
  with Tyrian purple; and he saw the white head of the horse whose feet needed
  now no dye of art to stain them vermilion. All the fury of battle, all the
  madness of revenge overwhelmed him in an instant; despair was gone, thoughts
  of past and future were swept away by the surge of one overmastering idea: he
  must reach that man and kill him. He looked around at the scattered, reeling
  maniples. A standard bearer was lying at his feet, striving with his remnant
  of strength to wrench the silver eagle from its staff, that he might hide it
  under his cloak; but the death rattle came too quickly. Sergius picked up the
  standard.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, "there is the enemy." And then, without a glance to note
  whether his appeal was regarded, he rushed blindly forward.</p>

  <p>It was a discipline inspired by tradition rather than taught by drills and
  punishments that came to the Roman recruit, and now it played its part. These
  peasants, these artisans whose eyes had seen naught save unaccustomed horrors
  through all the day, turned at once to answer the summons of the eagle.
  Sergius heard the feeble shout of battle that rose behind him, heard the
  scattered clanging of sword and shield, and when he struck the long pikes of
  the first square, it was with the force of half a dozen broken maniples
  welded into a solid mass.</p>

  <p>Still the sarissas held firm. Perhaps two lines went down, but the pila
  rained their slant courses from the rear; the feeble rush was stopped, and
  the legionaries struggled helplessly upon the spears. Sergius saw nothing but
  the dark, bearded face among the squares&mdash;scarcely nearer than before.
  Had he not read in a little book written by one, Xenophon, a Greek, and
  purchased, at great cost, at the shop of Milo, the bookseller in the
  Argiletum, how Oriental armies won or lost by the life or death of their
  leaders? He would kill Hannibal! Would to the gods that Paullus had fallen in
  the Cinctus Gabinus! Paullus, too much of an infidel to think of such
  old-time immolation; but there was yet one last appeal.</p>

  <p>Seizing the tough staff of the standard almost at the end, he whirled it
  around his head and let it go at full swing; the silver eagle flashed in the
  light of the setting sun, as it described great arcs, and plunged down amid
  the hostile ranks; a hoarse cry went up: the very deity of the legion was
  amid its foes! no Roman so untried as not to hear its call. The short swords
  hacked and stabbed among the spears; the first square swayed and rocked,
  shivered into fragments, and, hurled back upon the second, bore it, too, down
  in the mingled rush of pursuers and pursued. On every side of the dwindling
  band of assailants, front, flanks, and rear, the pikes dipped and plunged,
  the Gallic swords hissed through the air, the Spaniards ravened and stabbed;
  but, to the Romans, flanks and rear were nothing: it was the front, the
  Libyans, the lost eagle.</p>

  <p>And now, at last, it was won; the advance had been checked by the closer
  welding of the syntagmata, half his men were down; but Sergius, still unhurt,
  had stooped and raised the standard, kissing its crimson beak and wings. Then
  he looked up.</p>

  <p>Half the space between himself and the bearded horseman had vanished, and
  the latter was no longer talking carelessly with those about. His steady gaze
  was fixed upon the young Roman, as if studying the exact measure of strength
  that remained to him. There was nothing else for it. Again the great staff
  described great circles through the air, and again the crimson eagle soared
  and stooped, and the white stallion reared and snorted, as it struck the
  earth before him; again the shattered fragment of an army hurled itself,
  wounded and weary and bleeding, among the ever thickening spears; yes, and
  forced its way a quarter, half the remaining distance, until Sergius, whose
  eyes had never for a moment forsaken those of the Carthaginian, saw them grow
  troubled, saw the black, bushy brows draw together. Then his enemy turned and
  spoke a few hurried words to an attendant, gesticulating freely, until the
  man whirled his horse about and drove back through the throng. When Sergius
  looked into the face of the general again, it wore a disdainful
  smile&mdash;the smile of a Zeus that watches the sons of Aloeus pile mountain
  on mountain in the vain effort to storm Olympus. Again Hannibal was careless
  and unconcerned; again he laughed and joked gayly with his attendants; his
  soldier's eye had set the limit of Rome's last paroxysm, and it fell short of
  the spot where he sat&mdash;not by much, but enough. All that remained was
  for the arrows of Apollo to do their work, and now he had set these to the
  string.</p>

  <p>Wearily and yet more wearily the wolves bit and tore their way; then they
  came staggering to a stand, three spear lengths from the lost eagle, and then
  the pressure behind seemed to slacken, and the serried spears in front bore
  them slowly backward.</p>

  <p>All was over. Sergius' eyes, dim and bloodshot, wandered, at last, from
  the contemptuous smile that had held them, and rested upon the score of men,
  for the most part wounded, that remained about him. For an instant the spears
  and swords ceased their work, and the dense mass of lowering faces that
  surrounded the last of the legions rolled back. Lanes appeared between the
  syntagmata; a chorus of wild cries swelled up&mdash;swept nearer, and the
  furious riders of the desert came galloping through every interspace. To them
  had been granted, for a mark of honour, the ending of the battle. It was only
  a single rush, a brandishing and plunging of javelins retained in grasp, a
  little more blood spattered upon the horses' necks and bellies. No legionary
  was standing when the tempest had gone by, and there, among his men, with
  face turned from the red earth to the reddening sky, lay Lucius Sergius
  Fidenas, in slumber fitting for a Roman patrician when the black day of
  Cannae was done.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="part2"
     name="part2">PART II</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="chap201"
     name="chap201">I. &mdash; THE QUEEN OF THE WAYS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was much bustle and confusion throughout the little
  inn at Sinuessa. August was just closing, and the midday summer sun beat down
  too fiercely to permit of comfortable travel save toward morning or night.
  The inn-keeper had hurried out and stood in the roadway, bowing and wreathing
  his face with smiles of welcome, while, behind him, were grouped his
  servants, each bearing some implement of his or her calling&mdash;a muster
  well calculated to impress the wayfarer with the assurance of comfort and
  good cheer.</p>

  <p>The occasion of all this demonstration was a party that had halted,
  apparently for refreshment and the customary traveller's siesta; a rheda or
  four-wheeled travelling carriage, closely covered and drawn by three powerful
  horses yoked abreast. Two armed outriders, one apparently a freedman and the
  other a slave, made up the company, the former of whom, a stout, elderly man
  with gray hair and beard, had reined in his horse before the obsequious host,
  while the other remained by the carriage wheel, as if to aid the driver in
  guarding the rheda's occupants from intrusion.</p>

  <p>The innkeeper, short and fat, was breathing hard from the haste in which
  he had sallied out, but his words came volubly:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Let the gentlemen alight and enter&mdash;or, if they be ladies, so much
  the better. They shall make trial of the best inn along the whole length of
  the Queen of Ways. Such couches as they have never seen, save, doubtless, in
  their magnificent homes, fit for the gods to lie upon!&mdash;such
  dishes!&mdash;such cooking! guinea-hens fed and fattened under my own eye,
  mullet fresh from the water with all greens of the season, and such wine as
  only the Massic Mount can grow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here, however, he paused to take breath, and the freedman succeeded in
  interrupting the flow of words.</p>

  <p>"By the gods! will you be silent?" he said. "Perhaps we shall try your
  fare, if you do not take up the whole day in telling us about it. First,
  however, it is necessary for us to learn certain things. How many miles is it
  to Capua?"</p>

  <p>The innkeeper's face took on a grieved look in place of the beaming smile
  of a moment since, but he answered promptly and humbly:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The matter of twenty-five miles, my master."</p>

  <p>"At what hour do they close the gates?"</p>

  <p>The innkeeper glanced back at the group of domestics with a frightened
  expression.</p>

  <p>"That is a military question," he said. "How can I answer it in these
  times? It is dangerous to talk about such things."</p>

  <p>"Not dangerous for you," insisted the other, rather scornfully. "Since you
  Campanians have become pulse-eaters, not the wildest Numidian would dare
  disturb you. The cruel one is very tender of you all&mdash;<i>now</i>; but
  wait till Rome shall fall, then you will know what his tenderness is
  worth&mdash;when you are all busy grinding corn for Carthage&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"By all the gods! speak lower&mdash;if you must say such words," whispered
  the innkeeper, white with terror. "If one of my servants should betray me!
  Like enough the gate is closed at all times. It is said that Hannibal enters
  the town to-night."</p>

  <p>"Hannibal in Capua to-night!" came a voice from the rheda&mdash;a woman's
  voice, softly and delicately modulated, yet deep and rich in its tones. At
  the same moment the curtains were drawn aside, and she looked out, beckoning
  imperiously to the would-be host. "Come near, my good man, I wish to speak
  with you more closely."</p>

  <p>The innkeeper stood as one dazed, with open mouth and bulging eyes. He had
  looked upon great and beautiful ladies before, for many such travelled by the
  Appian Way, but the beauty and the nobility of this face seemed to him more
  than mortal. With all the grace, all the freshness, all the radiant charm of
  the girl Marcia, were now joined the calm and deep-eyed crown of womanhood.
  The perfect lines that could so perfectly respond to playful or tender
  emotions were still unmarred, and yet sorrow that had left no other trace had
  endowed them with new possibilities of devotion and high resolve.</p>

  <p>"Come," repeated Marcia, and the little inn-keeper trotted up to the rheda
  and stood watching her with an expression of canine wonder and subservience
  in his big, dull eyes.</p>

  <p>"Did I not hear you say that Hannibal was to be in Capua to-night? Have
  these false Campanians indeed carried out the treachery rumoured of
  them?"</p>

  <p>The man had forgotten all his fears of a few moments since, nor did the
  slur upon his race rouse aught of indignation. Held fast under the spell of
  the dark eyes before him, he made haste to answer:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The rumour, madam, that a traveller left with me some hours since is that
  Marius Blossius, praetor of Campania, has led all Capua out to meet Hannibal,
  who is to feast to-night at the house of the Ninii Celeres, Stenius and
  Pacuvius&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But how was this done?" she interrupted. "It was said at Rome that some
  few evil spirits, like Vibius Virrius and Pacuvius Calavius, were ill-
  disposed, but surely the senators of Capua are faithful?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know as to that," said the fellow, with the stubborn dulness of
  a peasant; "but I know it is hard to see your property and goods destroyed
  and to hold fast to allies who do not protect you&mdash;and a Roman garrison
  at Casilinum all the time. They say this African is kind to his friends, and
  then, too, he sent home my son without ransom when the young man was prisoner
  in the north&mdash;some battle by some lake that I forget the name
  of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Such talk is well enough for the poor-spirited rabble," cried Marcia,
  impetuously; "but was there none of noble blood in the city? None who could
  compel duty?"</p>

  <p>A look of cunning crossed his face as he answered:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Pacuvius Calavius took care of that. He cooped up the senate in the
  senate-house, by telling them the people sought their lives. Then he went out
  and spoke against them to that same people, and offered to surrender them for
  death, one by one; and then, when they had given up hope, he made a clever
  turn and persuaded us to forego their just punishment. So it is said in Capua
  that Pacuvius Calavius bought the senators for his slaves, and not one but
  runs to do his bidding. Senators, you see, do not like the rods and axe any
  better than humbler people like the sword and the torch."</p>

  <p>Marcia eyed him with disgust. Then her brow cleared. "What could be
  expected from such a man," she thought. "Surely not exalted patriotism or
  high ideals&mdash;especially when the class question had been brought into
  play against public faith and public honour. Mere stupidity would yoke him to
  the side that seemed to promise the most immediate exemptions or rewards. It
  was possible, though, that the situation might not be as bad as it was
  painted; that there might still be faithful men in the second city of
  Italy&mdash; men who, while at present held down by the skilful plotting of
  their enemies or the hopelessness of open resistance, were yet waiting,
  vigilant to seize upon the first promising opportunity to recover the lost
  ground. On the other hand, innkeepers were apt to be a well-informed class,
  as to public happenings, and this man told his tale with parrot-like
  precision. At any rate, there was nothing to do but reach Capua as soon as
  possible; for, the Carthaginian commander once within the walls, no one could
  tell what precautions and scrutiny might be established at the gates."</p>

  <p>She turned to the freedman.</p>

  <p>"There is no time for resting and refreshment, Ligurius. We must not lose
  the chance of entering the city before nightfall;" and to the man who rode at
  the wheel: "Come, Caipor. A little weariness will not hurt us."</p>

  <p>The driver's whip curled about the horses' flanks, and they started
  forward; but the disappointed innkeeper laid hold of one of the poles that
  supported the covering of the rheda and gasped and sputtered as he
  ran:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"What now! Would you die of the heat? Am I to lose my custom because I am
  good-natured and tell the news?"</p>

  <p>Caipor turned in his seat and raised the thong used to urge on his animal;
  but Marcia, hearing the clamour, thrust the curtain aside again and,
  motioning the slave to restrain himself, threw several denarii to her
  would-be host. At the same moment, the horses suddenly quickened their gait,
  and the pursuer, keeping his hold, was jerked flat upon his face.</p>

  <p>"Be cautious!" shouted Caipor. "There is silver in the dust you are
  swallowing," and they hurried on, unable to distinguish whether the half-
  choked ejaculations that followed them were thanks or curses.</p>

  <p>There was a short silence punctuated by the cracking of the whip, the
  clatter of hoofs, and the crunching of wheels along the pavement; then the
  curtains once more parted slightly, and Caipor, watchful to serve, saw
  Marcia's beckoning hand and drew closer to the rheda.</p>

  <p>"Bend down," she said, and, as he obeyed, she whispered:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You were my brother's servant, Caipor, and you bear his name. Will you
  help me to avenge him?"</p>

  <p>The slave's eyes flashed, and he straightened himself on his horse. Then
  he lowered his head to hear more.</p>

  <p>"Ligurius," she continued, "will be brave and faithful to my family in all
  things. I want one who will be faithful to what is greater and to what is
  less&mdash;to Rome and to me. I seek safety for the Republic; and I seek
  revenge for those who are dead. Will you help me when Ligurius halts?"</p>

  <p>"The cross itself will not daunt me," he said simply. "Whatever you shall
  do, lady, I will be faithful to the death."</p>

  <p>"For me, perhaps, to the death, Caipor," she answered; "but for you, if
  the gods favour me, to life and to freedom."</p>

  <p>His cheek flushed with the rich blood of his Samnite ancestors, and, as
  Ligurius glanced back from his post at the head of the party, the young man
  made his horse bound forward, lest his attitude and perturbation might bring
  some suspicion of a secret conference to the mind of the old freedman.</p>

  <p>So they descended within the hemicycle of hills. The heights of Mount
  Tifata began to fall away on the left, the rough, precipitous line of crags,
  sweeping around toward the east, seemed to dwindle into the distance, even as
  they drew nearer, while the low jumble of Neapolitan hills, beyond which
  towered Vesuvius with its fluttering pennon of vapour, rose higher and higher
  upon the southern horizon. A turn of the road, a temporary makeshift, led
  them around Casilinum, whose little garrison lay close, nor opened their
  gates to friend or foe. There, at last, in the midst of the level plain that
  stretched down to the sea, lay Capua, gleaming white and radiant beneath the
  brush of the now descending sun.</p>

  <p>Gradually the great sweep of city walls grew lowering and massive. It
  still lacked an hour of sunset, and the travellers had not urged themselves
  unduly through the midday course. The foam, yellowed and darkened by dust,
  had dried upon the horses' flanks save only where the chafing of the harness
  kept it fresh and white. Marcia leaned far out of the rheda and gazed eagerly
  at the nearing town, Caipor seemed scarcely able to restrain his eagerness to
  dash forward, while Ligurius shaded his eyes with his hand and viewed the
  spectacle like a general counting the power of his approaching foe. Even at
  this distance they saw, or began to imagine they saw, some indescribable
  change,&mdash;not a flurry of motion or excitement,&mdash;they were too far
  away to note that, had such been present. It was as though above, around
  every tower and battlement hung an atmosphere of hostility and defiance; yet
  this was the friend of Rome through days of weal and days of woe,&mdash;the
  second city of Italy.</p>

  <p>Nearer and nearer they drew. The horses threw their heads in the air, and,
  presaging rest and provender, quickened their pace, without urging. Suddenly
  an exclamation burst from the lips of Ligurius.</p>

  <p>"Look!" he cried. "It is true. They are indeed here." Marcia and Caipor
  strove to follow his hand. "My northern eyes, old though they be, are better
  than yours of the south. Do you not see them&mdash;one, two, three! Gods!
  They are thick on the walls."</p>

  <p>"What? in the name of Jove!" exclaimed Marcia, impatiently, and then
  Caipor started.</p>

  <p>"I see! I see now," he cried. "Ah! mistress, they are the standards of
  Carthage; the horses' heads, yellow, with red manes. Gods, how they glitter!
  Gold and blood&mdash;gold and blood!"</p>

  <p>"Drive on," said Marcia, for they had all drawn rein, half unconsciously,
  and she lay back, behind the curtains of the rheda.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap202"
     name="chap202">II. &mdash; THE GATE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A HARSH cry of command or warning rang out ahead, and the
  rheda stopped short with a jolt. Ligurius had thrown his horse upon his
  haunches and then backed him so as to take post at that side of the vehicle
  unprotected by Caipor; but, a moment later, the rush of a dozen tall figures
  thrust them both away, the curtains were torn aside, and Marcia looked out
  into savage faces and great, staring, blue eyes. Three or four overlapping
  circlets of iron just above the hips seemed the limit of these men's
  defensive armour, and the skin of some animal was thrown about the brawny
  shoulders of such as had not replaced their barbaric mantles with the Roman
  military cloak; the hair of each, black or red, but always long and
  indescribably filthy, was caught up in a knot at the top of the head, whence
  it streamed away, loose or matted, like the tail of an unkempt horse; their
  feet were bare, and their legs were covered by linen breeches bound close
  with leathern thongs. It needed not the great broad-swords slung about their
  shoulders to tell them for Hannibal's Gauls&mdash; creatures scarcely half
  human, whose name brought terror to the Roman maiden of the days of Cannae,
  as the sight of them had carried death or slavery to her less-favoured sister
  of the blacker days of the Allia.</p>

  <p>But Marcia showed little of womanish weakness. To the jargon of a dozen
  voices&mdash;a jargon that sounded like the yelping and barking of a pack of
  dogs&mdash;she opposed a cold and dignified silence. A dozen hands reached
  out to touch her, as they would touch something strange and admirable; but
  she drew back, and the rude hands and staring, blue eyes fell before the
  flash of her indignation.</p>

  <p>At that instant, a man strode forward, hurling the soldiers from his path
  to right and left, or striking them fiercely with his staff. Taller by almost
  half a head than the others, his richer vesture and arms, but, above all, the
  gold collar about his neck and the gold bracelets upon his arms, marked the
  chief. Standing by the rheda, he met Marcia's look of proud defiance, for a
  moment; then his eyes shifted and seemed to wander; but, cloaking with
  martial sternness the embarrassment of the barbarian, he spoke in
  Gallic:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Who are you?"</p>

  <p>Unable to understand the question, much less to answer it, she turned away
  and ignored both the man and his words. Again the look of indecision and
  embarrassment returned to his face; but, glancing round, he saw Ligurius
  struggling in the hands of his captors, and caught some words of Gallic in
  his half-throttled remonstrances.</p>

  <p>"Bring him," he said shortly, with a motion of his staff, and the
  freedman, who had been roughly pulled from his horse, was thrust forward, his
  clothes hanging in tatters, and his face bruised and bleeding from his
  efforts to break loose and guard his mistress from intrusion or insult.</p>

  <p>"Who is <i>she</i>, and who are you?" asked the chief, sternly; for his
  eyes, now that they looked into those of a man and an inferior, had regained
  all their wild fierceness.</p>

  <p>Ligurius hesitated, partly from lack of wind and partly from a doubt as to
  how much or what it would be wise to tell.</p>

  <p>"Speak!" cried the other, impatiently.</p>

  <p>Marcia threw aside the curtains which had been allowed to fall back in
  their place, and leaned out. The scene looked critical; the Gaul's face was
  working with nervous irritation, while his followers, scarcely recovered from
  his sudden onslaught, stood around in a ring, some fingering their swords,
  and with expressions whose wonder and stupidity seemed fast giving place to
  the lust of blood and plunder. Caipor had been knocked senseless at the
  beginning, and the driver was in the hands of several soldiers.</p>

  <p>Ligurius looked inquiringly at his mistress.</p>

  <p>"He asks who we are," he said. "What shall I say?"</p>

  <p>"Ah! you plot to deceive me," cried the Gaul, losing control of his
  temper, and, before Marcia could answer, he struck the freedman down with his
  staff. One of his followers shifted his sword belt, and, half drawing the
  great weapon, stepped forward; but Marcia had sprung from the rheda, and
  stood, with clenched hands and flashing eyes, above her prostrate
  attendant.</p>

  <p>"Bandits! Murderers!" she cried. "Does your general permit you to rob and
  kill travellers that seek to enter a friendly city?"</p>

  <p>Understanding the act rather than the words, the soldier halted, and the
  chief's eyes began again to shift nervously; but soon an expression of
  mingled lust and cunning came into them.</p>

  <p>"You are beautiful," he said. "You shall not die, you shall dwell in my
  hut."</p>

  <p>Marcia shuddered at the glance and change of tone. He reached out his
  arms, tattooed in blue designs, and made as if to advance. She drew a dagger
  from her girdle. Infuriated by the sight of what he took to be a hostile
  weapon, the barbarian's sword was out in an instant. Then he perceived that
  the dagger was directed not at his breast, but at the woman's. The point of
  the great sword, already half raised, dropped slowly to the ground, and a new
  look of embarrassed amazement took the place of the momentary glare of savage
  fury.</p>

  <p>How it would have ended never transpired, for a commotion at the gate
  attracted the attention of all. A small detachment of soldiers was advancing,
  at a leisurely pace, headed by a young officer whose arms blazed with gold
  and silver. No Hannibalian veterans these. As they came near, even Marcia
  could note the sleek, soft look of the men, and their listless, muscleless
  gait; while their leader's hair and person literally reeked with perfumes.
  His eyes turned slowly from the huge Gaul to the woman; then a flash of
  animation lent them light.</p>

  <p>"How is this?" he asked. "Why this tumult? Who are these people?"</p>

  <p>The Gaul shook his head defiantly, as if ignorant of the speech of his
  interrogator, while his followers began to nudge each other, pointing out the
  round limbs and fresh complexions of the Capuans, and laughing
  scornfully.</p>

  <p>The young officer flushed, and, turning to Marcia, repeated the
  question.</p>

  <p>"I am a Roman. Do you not understand my tongue?" she said.</p>

  <p>He glanced fearfully at the Gauls. Then, reassured by their evident
  failure to comprehend, he regained his assurance and answered:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Surely, lady, an educated Capuan cannot fail to understand all languages,
  civilized or barbarous. I speak the Greek, the Roman&mdash;all; only permit
  me to beg you to be less frank in naming your city: 'Roman' is a dangerous
  word to use here. What has led one so beautiful and so accomplished to run
  the risk of such a journey? Do you not know that Hannibal and his men are in
  Capua? That is why these beasts have been able to disturb you; but fear not,"
  he continued, as she was about to speak, "<i>I</i> also am here to protect
  you," and he accompanied the words, with a glance that left the nature of the
  protection offered more than equivocal.</p>

  <p>Suppressing her mingled feelings of disgust and amusement, Marcia answered
  haughtily:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"May Jove favour you for your offer; but has it come that the expected
  guest of Pacuvius Calavius needs protection at the gate of Capua?"</p>

  <p>Amazement and deference were at once apparent in his changed manner.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he said slowly, as if trying to gather his wits; "that is
  different&mdash; very different. It is a double regret that these vermin have
  troubled you; but you are safe now."</p>

  <p>Marcia found herself wondering whether he would allude to the Gauls so
  scornfully had they been able to understand his words.</p>

  <p>The Capuan turned to the Gallic chief, who, together with his followers,
  had drawn nearer.</p>

  <p>"Make way!" he cried. "Loose the slave that drives." Then to his own men,
  "Raise up the two that are hurt;" and to Marcia, "And you, lady; will it
  please you to return to your carriage?"</p>

  <p>But the Gauls, although evidently understanding the nature of his orders,
  showed no disposition to obey them. On the contrary, at a few words from
  their chief, they pushed closer yet, and some of them even began to jostle
  the soldiers of the Capuan guard. A light blow or a sharp word bade fair to
  precipitate a conflict that, despite the numerical equality, could hardly be
  doubtful in its outcome, when a sharp, commanding voice rang out behind.</p>

  <p>All swung around, as if to meet a blow, and the press opened. A rider,
  glittering in arms of simple but rich design, and mounted upon a black horse,
  was advancing from the gate. Two Spaniards, who rode several spear lengths
  behind him, were his sole escort; but, alone or at the head of a legion, it
  was all the same: no eye of Gaul or Capuan saw aught but the one horseman;
  and yet it was not easy to tell wherein the force lay. He was a young man,
  probably twenty&mdash;possibly twenty-five, for life advanced quickly under
  the sun of Africa. His figure was slender and boyish, his face thinly
  bearded, a lack which was accentuated by the beard being divided into two
  points. Yes, now they, saw; it was his eyes that had dispelled the boast and
  swagger of the Gaul, the superciliousness of the Capuan, and whatever of
  brawling boldness had been in either. These eyes were black and large and
  flashing with courage and energy and the pride of noble birth. No detail of
  the scene seemed to escape their first glance, and he asked no question, as
  he rode into the crowd.</p>

  <p>"Ardix," he said, addressing the Gaul in his own tongue, "back to your
  gate! and you," turning to the Capuan officer and changing his language with
  ready ease, "it would be wise for you to consider the unwisdom of quarrelling
  with our veterans."</p>

  <p>There was just enough of contempt in the inference of the last word to
  check the flow of explanation and complaint that was rising to the lips of
  the young exquisite. The newcomer had turned his back. The Capuan saw his
  followers slinking away with Ardix and his Gauls. It was hard to lose a
  chance of talking with a great man, and surely a few of the words he could
  choose and speak so well would compel the Carthaginian to value him at his
  worth. Still, there was something that impressed upon him the unwisdom of
  speech, and, after a moment of embarrassed indecision, he turned and strode
  away after the rest, seeking to conceal the humiliation of his retreat by the
  swagger of his gait and the fierceness of his expression&mdash;which there
  was no one to see.</p>

  <p>While this little comedy was passing, he, whose advent had been its
  occasion, was regarding Marcia fixedly; but he now looked into eyes that
  neither quailed nor wandered before his own. At last he spoke, and in
  Latin:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I am Mago, the son of Hamilcar. What brings a Roman woman to Capua in
  these days?"</p>

  <p>This youth, then, was the famous brother of Hannibal; the commander of the
  ambush at the Trebia. His voice was cold, harsh, and metallic, and in his
  eyes there was none of the rude lust of the Gaul or the polished
  licentiousness of the Capuan. They burned only with the fires that light the
  souls of patriots and leaders of men.</p>

  <p>"I come," said Marcia, slowly, "for several reasons, and believing that
  Carthage does not make war upon women."</p>

  <p>The eyes lost nothing of their cold scrutiny at the implied compliment or
  the covert reproach.</p>

  <p>"And what reasons?" he asked sharply.</p>

  <p>"For the one," replied Marcia, and she was conscious of an effort in
  holding her voice to its steady inflection; "that my house is bound in
  hospitality to that of Pacuvius Calavius&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mago's brow cleared for an instant.</p>

  <p>"Our friend," he said. "He is married to one of your Claudians." Then it
  darkened again as he continued: "Well, and you seek him for what? To tempt
  him back to Rome?"</p>

  <p>"I seek him," said Marcia, boldly, "because I am wise. Have I not seen the
  narrowing of Rome's resources? the quarrels of the factions? I have come from
  there, and I tell you that, if Hannibal have patience until the spring, it is
  Rome that will beg him to take her. What part has a woman with a man who
  cannot protect himself! Let her look for a new defender, if she be wise."</p>

  <p>An odd look had come into the Carthaginian's face as she spoke, a look
  more scornful but less threatening.</p>

  <p>"You speak true woman's philosophy," he said. "That is the philosophy of
  these times. I am convinced that there <i>were</i> days, and women&mdash;but
  pah! now it is only glory that is worthy to be a man's bride. Come, I will
  lead you to the house of Calavius."</p>

  <p>Ligurius had recovered sufficiently to remount his horse, while Mago's
  attendants had laid the still senseless Caipor in the rheda to which their
  master now assisted Marcia. Then he rode on, by the wheel of the
  carriage.</p>

  <p>As for the daughter of Torquatus, not even the consciousness of her
  purpose, and of the high and bitter motives that had shaped it, could drive
  the touch of shame from her cheeks. It galled her when she considered how she
  must appear to this man&mdash;a mere youth and a Carthaginian, and it galled
  her the more that she should care for his opinion. That she had inspired only
  his contempt, was quite evident; and she, whose glances had always gone
  straight as the arrows of Love to the hearts of men, now found herself more
  annoyed by the indifference of an enemy than she had been by the dangers from
  which he had rescued her. She was not certain whether it was with a desire to
  gain in his sight, or only in the pursuance of her plans, that she spoke
  again.</p>

  <p>"Does my lord think worse of me for what I have said?"</p>

  <p>"I thought you a woman; now I know you for one," he replied,
  carelessly.</p>

  <p>"Ah! but my lord did not ask as to my other reasons for seeking the camp
  of Carthage."</p>

  <p>"That is a matter for Calavius to look to. If you come as an
  enemy&mdash;so much the worse for him."</p>

  <p>"And if I come as a woman who would escape a hated marriage&mdash;to seek
  a lover who has won her heart afar off?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Calavius?" laughed Mago, the boy in him suddenly flashing out. "They say
  even the old men here are hunters of women. Have a care of the Claudian,
  though. She may bite."</p>

  <p>Marcia flushed crimson. Mago was not an easy subject for female influence.
  Besides, she began to realize that the respect she could not help feeling for
  the attitude of the young soldier might hamper whatever efforts she could put
  forth to ensnare and control him. His closeness to Hannibal, however, would
  make his conquest as advantageous as it seemed difficult, and it was some
  such thought as this that prompted her next words.</p>

  <p>"Happy the leader and brother that has so single and so firm a
  counsellor!"</p>

  <p>She spoke as if half unconsciously, but Mago shot a sharp glance straight
  into her eyes. Then he answered, carelessly:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"My brother is the captain-general of Carthage, and I am only a young
  soldier. Doubtless he is wise to ignore my opinions; and yet, had he harkened
  to Maharbal and myself at the close of the day of Cannae&mdash;had he let us
  press on with the cavalry and followed, with such speed as the gods could
  grant,&mdash;I am convinced that within five days he had supped in the
  Capitol."</p>

  <p>His tone changed, as he spoke, to one of fierce enthusiasm, and his
  listener shuddered. Then, sinking his voice, he went on, as if speaking to
  himself:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Even now&mdash;even now&mdash;before the winter closes in, there might be
  a chance. Later, they will recover strength and courage, and we&mdash;we
  shall become&mdash;Capuans."</p>

  <p>Marcia hid her agitation behind the curtains of the rheda. She was
  terrified by his vehemence and by the justice of his reasoning. Here was the
  man whose whole influence would be pitted against the purpose of her journey;
  and her woman's intuition told her that no argument or allurement could turn
  his mind. It was with a feeling of relief that the halting of the vehicle
  before the porch of a stately house checked the unwise retort that trembled
  on her lips. Later, she could oppose him better than if, yielding now to an
  impulse to controvert his views, she had aroused suspicion.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap203"
     name="chap203">III. &mdash; PACUVIUS CALAVIUS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE house of Pacuvius Calavius was well situated, near the
  centre of the town, accessible to the Forum, and upon a street of
  considerable width. The porch of the ostium was supported by four columns
  delicately fluted and painted, the lower half in dull crimson, the upper in
  ochre. A porter, in costume much richer than those worn by most free Romans,
  lounged on a stool set upon the mosaic pavement, and roused himself lazily to
  shuffle down and inquire why the rheda had halted before his door.</p>

  <p>"Ah! It was a lady"&mdash;and he smirked with insolent meaning&mdash;"who
  desired to see his master?" He threw out his hands with a deprecatory
  gesture. "The gods were, in truth, very friendly to Pacuvius Calavius; but
  then he was very old&mdash;a complaint which few could guard against.
  Oh!&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mago had signalled to one of his horsemen, and the soldier's lash whistled
  and wound itself about the slave's neck. All the fellow's laziness and
  insolence vanished, and he fell upon the pavement, writhing and
  whimpering.</p>

  <p>"Lash the hound till he does his office," said Mago, quietly; and the
  short hand-thong rose again.</p>

  <p>But before it descended a second time, the porter had rolled and scrambled
  to his feet, and was rushing to open the door. He vanished with wonderful
  speed, and, a moment later, there appeared a man somewhat above middle age,
  with a close-curling, white beard, and clad in a robe so heavily embroidered
  with gold as to leave the ground colour a matter of conjecture. With keen
  eyes that shifted nervously, he hurried down toward the rheda. Then, noting
  Mago, and that he was a Carthaginian of rank, he paused, uncertain, and his
  salutation savoured somewhat of over-respect.</p>

  <p>"A lady?" he said hesitatingly;&mdash;"a lady who desires to see me?"</p>

  <p>Marcia parted the curtains and leaned out, smiling. The newcomer stopped
  short and gasped in astonishment.</p>

  <p>Mago glanced sharply from one to the other, and his lip curled. He signed
  to his attendants, and, with an obeisance that had in it haughtiness rather
  than courtesy, he rode away.</p>

  <p>Glancing cautiously up and down the street, Calavius approached the
  rheda.</p>

  <p>"And is it the lady Marcia who is to honour my house?" he began, in words
  that carried more welcome than did the tone. "A dangerous journey, in these
  days, and a dangerous destination. Surely you are welcome&mdash;and who was
  the young man that rode with you? Did he know anything of your name and
  birth? I trust you were cautious?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Marcia laughed.</p>

  <p>"Do not fear, father;" Calavius frowned slightly at the venerable title,
  and shook out his robe that the odours might permeate the air. "Do not fear
  but that I was as cunning as your Campanians. I told him I was a
  Roman&mdash;wherefore not? For the matter of that, he divined it. He is Mago,
  the brother of Hannibal&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And he brought you here?" cried Calavius, trembling now in good earnest.
  "Surely it was done to ruin me; but whose plot?&mdash;whose plot?"</p>

  <p>"It is not necessary I should be your guest," said Marcia, with well-
  feigned indifference. "Doubtless there are inns; but he guided me here
  because I asked for your house, imagining that my father's friend would have
  a welcome for my father's daughter."</p>

  <p>Calavius instantly recovered his composure.</p>

  <p>"Ah! dear lady," he began, in a voice from which all the tremor had
  vanished, "and do you dream for a moment that you should taste of other
  hospitality than mine? Will you not descend&mdash;nay, I will help
  you&mdash;and let us enter quickly. These are indeed troublous days, and
  every door creaks a warning; troublous days, with each man's hand against his
  neighbour, plotting by necessity, often, rather than by preference. What!
  your attendants are hurt?" Again his voice shook. "A brawl? that is bad; but
  come within. It is there you shall tell me of it all."</p>

  <p>So speaking, he assisted Marcia to descend, and, summoning his servants,
  gave the rheda and its guardians into their care. Then he led the way into
  his house, carefully fastening the street door behind them, for the porter
  evidently had not halted in his flight, short of the slaves' apartments
  upstairs.</p>

  <p>Marcia followed, wondering at the magnificence of the decorations. She
  passed through passages lighted by hanging-lamps of gold and silver and
  bronze; past walls rich with frescoes in black and yellow and red; panels and
  pictures such as Caius Fabius Pictor could never have dreamed when he
  ornamented the Temple of Safety; frescoes that so far surpassed the work of
  Damophilus and Gorgasus upon the walls of Ceres, as these had surpassed the
  art of Pictor himself. Then came courts surrounded by rows of fluted columns,
  set with fountains that threw light sprays of scented water over the flowers
  and the garments of the passers; then more passages, with paintings of even
  greater merit and delicacy of execution, mingled, here and there, with scenes
  where the delicacy was of the execution alone, and that brought hot blushes
  to her cheek. Amid all, were scattered richly carved pedestals bearing
  beautiful statues done in marble or bronze, or great vases, black or
  terra-cotta, with intricately composed groups of figures in the opposite
  tint. It came like a veritable revelation to one who had known nothing but
  the crude art of the Etruscans and the cruder handicraft of her own people,
  tempered, as they were, by the taste of such Greek artists as fell so far
  short of their native ideals as to be willing to waste their skill upon
  barbarians. She had heard of the wealth and luxury of the Capuans, but it had
  never entered her mind to imagine that the luxury of Capua could demand, or
  the wealth of Campania purchase, pictures whose distance and proportions were
  true to life itself, and statues that seemed veritably to live and breathe.
  Her eyes were big with wonder and admiration, when her guide and host turned
  sharply to the right and ushered her into a small room that looked out
  through a row of slender pillars into a portico beyond, and thence into a
  garden that seemed a very forest of small rose trees. Around the walls ran a
  shelf upon which were set a number of circular boxes, while lying upon the
  table were several bulky rolls of papyrus, in parchment wrappers stained
  yellow or purple.</p>

  <p>"My library," said Calavius, in a careless tone, but with a wave of his
  arm that showed his pride in its possession. "Three hundred and eighty-nine
  works&mdash;the best, and of the most excellent authors:&mdash;poets,
  philosophers, historians, rhetoricians&mdash;all that is worth reading. No
  man in Capua has a better show of literature&mdash;unless, perhaps, it be
  Decius Magius," and his voice sank, as if the name had brought him back to a
  realization of circumstances. "Here I can read without disturbance, and here
  we can talk without fear of interruption or listening ears. There are slaves
  always stationed at both ends of the portico, to insure quiet."</p>

  <p>"And you are the man who has dared to turn Capua over to the enemies of
  Rome! Truly, I cannot understand."</p>

  <p>Marcia could not restrain the words, and Calavius flushed.</p>

  <p>"Do not condemn me for timidity," he said quickly. "These are dangerous
  seas for a man of mark to steer his craft upon. Carthaginians and other
  barbarians are not citizens of Capua&mdash;no refinement&mdash;no
  civilization. Much has happened to disturb me&mdash;to unsettle my nerves.
  Decius Magius has been parading in the Forum, defying our friends,&mdash; and
  who with him but my own son, Perolla, casting discredit on my plans, and
  danger on himself! It was with the utmost difficulty I could drag him
  away&mdash;and then, what does the Carthaginian do but fly into a rage, and
  demand an audience of the senate, with a view to punishing Decius. Nothing
  but my influence and that of Virrius and the Ninii have persuaded him to
  forego his purpose for the time; and that, only, by pleading the joy of this
  day, and that it should be given to nothing save festivity and feasting.
  Truly, my mind misgives me. Still, they have sworn that no Carthaginian shall
  have any power over a Campanian, and&mdash; was not that a noise in the
  portico?"</p>

  <p>He rose and, gliding out to the row of pillars, looked up and down. Marcia
  regarded him with contempt and pity.</p>

  <p>"And yet," she said, "it is for this terror and distrust that you have
  betrayed Rome. Were there none of our soldiers and citizens in the town?"</p>

  <p>"Do not speak of it," whispered Calavius, growing even paler;&mdash;"a
  most frightful misfortune! They were taken in arms, or at their
  business&mdash;what matters it which?&mdash;and confined in the baths for
  safe-keeping."</p>

  <p>"And then?" said Marcia, for he paused.</p>

  <p>"And then some evil-disposed persons turned on the vapour."</p>

  <p>"They were killed?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Not so loud!&mdash;not so loud! for the love of all the gods! It was a
  mistake, a terrible mistake!"</p>

  <p>"Ah! guest-friend of my father," said Marcia, sadly; "I fear it is a
  mistake that Rome will exact a heavy price for. You say truly that it matters
  not how they were taken."</p>

  <p>"But I swear it was no will of mine!" he cried, and then, fearing lest he
  had committed himself too deeply, he went on. "In fact, lady, they say too
  much, who set this revolution at my door; who say that I was the mover of
  all. Was it not Vibius Virrius who first suggested it? Was it not Marius
  Blossius, the praetor, who led out the people to meet the
  Carthaginians?&mdash;and see how my son is still with Rome! No, by Bacchus!
  there are many here a thousand times more guilty&mdash;if it be guilt, and on
  whom the rods and axes must fall first if there be justice under the gods.
  You can bear witness at Rome to that."</p>

  <p>"There will be rods and axes enough for all," said Marcia, grimly, filled
  with horror and disgust for the deeds told of, and with contempt for this
  garrulous, timid plotter of treachery and murder. Then, suddenly, she noted a
  sinister glitter in his eye, and, at the same time, remembering her mission,
  she checked her words and went on, "Rods and axes enough for all who are so
  feeble as not to take the sovereignty of Italy when it lies within their
  grasp."</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;what is that you say?" he said eagerly, and the threat fled
  from his face. "The sovereignty of Italy? Ah! it is a great prize! Who shall
  deny it to us? Are we not the second city? Have we not allies the strongest
  in the world?&mdash;a general the greatest? and when all is over, who so
  fitting to rule as the first man of the first city?&mdash; for Rome will be
  no more. Ah! I will deal with them gently, though; I will
  conciliate&mdash;unless I be opposed too obstinately. You shall tell them
  that. Are they meditating surrender? Do they not see that we must
  prevail?&mdash;but," and his tone changed again to distrust, "I have
  forgotten to ask, amid my anxiety about matters of state, why you have come
  to Capua&mdash;a Roman&mdash;at such times?"</p>

  <p>Marcia laughed. She was ready for her part now, and this adversary, at
  least, she despised,&mdash;perhaps too much, for he was a cunning man, in his
  way, and when the matter demanded only chicanery against other cowards.</p>

  <p>"Ah! my Pacuvius, a politician like <i>you</i> asks me that?" she
  exclaimed gayly. "Is it for a woman to remain in a ship buffeted and rocking
  in the storm? a ship that must founder soon, if it be but left to
  itself?"</p>

  <p>"Is that truth?" he asked eagerly, but with a tinge of suspicion in his
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Surely, it is truth: as it is truth that I, with many other women, have
  gone out to such cities where there are friends of our houses&mdash;cities
  friendly to the new powers, friends strong enough to give us shelter and
  protection. It is my happy fortune to have found a city and a friend the
  strongest of all."</p>

  <p>Calavius smiled complacently and stroked his beard.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you have done well," he said slowly. "I am not without interest with
  the captain-general of Carthage, and there may be yet greater things in store
  for me. I will go now and send female attendants to you, that you may seek
  the bath and your room, and have such refreshment as you desire. I will talk
  with you again later, but to-night there is the banquet at the house of the
  Ninii. Ah! it will be the greatest feast that Capua has seen&mdash;a banquet
  to Hannibal and the Carthaginian leaders. Farewell."</p>

  <p>He turned to go, but she rose quickly and laid her hand upon his robe.</p>

  <p>"You have not heard all, yet," she said, casting down her eyes and
  speaking in halting phrases. "Do you truly believe that it is <i>only</i> a
  woman's fears that have brought me to Capua? You have not questioned me
  closely. That is not worthy of your wisdom. It is hard for a woman to tell
  all things unless they be drawn from her."</p>

  <p>He stared with eyes full of wonder.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Then, throwing her head to one side, she laughed, so that Sergius himself
  would scarcely have known it from the laugh of the free-hearted, jesting
  Marcia of other days.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my father, you a Capuan and a man learned in the ways of women! It is
  pitiful&mdash;this littleness of your knowledge. Come, tell me now, as to a
  pedagogue, what is it that leads a woman to all places, through all
  dangers?"</p>

  <p>"Surely, my child, it is love," said Calavius, vacantly. Then his face
  took on an expression, first of furrowed surprise and then of gratified
  vanity, an expression that brought the hot blush to Marcia's cheek, even
  while she struggled to restrain her contemptuous mirth. His manner changed at
  once to one of insinuating gallantry, which she hastened to check before he
  should commit himself.</p>

  <p>"What is it," she went on again, glancing down that he might not see and
  read her eyes; "what is it that makes women love men? What, if not strength
  and courage? I am a Roman, my father; but Roman men are no longer fit mates
  for Roman women. Where but in the camp of Carthage shall I find one worthy of
  my beauty? It is there I seek my lover."</p>

  <p>Disappointment lowered on the face of Calavius. He had noted her beauty,
  long before she had referred to it; but now he noted it with a more distinct
  desire, and the words, "my father," which she had used, though but a
  customary term of respect, grated the more harshly upon his ears. Still,
  controlling himself, he asked:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"And which man of our allies has the lady Marcia chosen to bless with the
  love that is too high for an humble Italian?"</p>

  <p>She looked the siren herself, as she answered:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Surely, my father would not learn the secret of his daughter!" Calavius
  winced. "Believe, only, that he who has been loved at a distance is noble and
  powerful. However, if so be that my lord would learn the truth, let him take
  her to this banquet. I have heard often that much liberty is allowed to the
  women of Capua; why not, then, to the guest of the noblest of the
  Capuans?"</p>

  <p>The mind of Calavius had been divided. With the first rebuff to his rising
  passion had come the impulse to avail himself of his power and of the
  helpless position of his guest to gratify his spite or his pleasure as she
  might choose to make it. Then, at the suggestion that she loved and had come
  to seek a Carthaginian of rank, he thought of the disfavour&mdash;even peril
  he might incur by such a course should an enemy or a slave learn the facts
  and expose him; and, finally, he fell into a cunning casting up of the
  influence he might gain over the lover, whoever he was, to whom he should be
  instrumental in surrendering such perfect beauty. Again he winced at the
  thought, but then, what more likely than that her silly, woman's vanity
  aspired to the captain-general himself? and he, Pacuvius Calavius, might hope
  to be the confidential go-between. What profit and influence might not be
  found in such a relation!&mdash;so personal, so beneficent! After all, there
  were many beautiful women&mdash;even among his slaves, and what was the
  difference between woman and woman compared to the dream of Italian
  sovereignty that hovered before his eyes! He knew well that no wife or
  daughter of a Capuan would be present at that banquet&mdash;only the most
  beautiful of the city's hetairai&mdash;but what of that? This girl was a
  Roman&mdash;an enemy; the claims of hospitality between his people and hers
  would be shivered in the coming crash of arms. What mattered it if to gain a
  point&mdash;a great point&mdash;he wrenched loose his personal obligations a
  few days sooner? Yes, Marcia should go to the banquet, and, if Hannibal
  desired her, then he, Pacuvius Calavius, would surrender her into his arms.
  He knit his brows and spoke:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"What you ask, my daughter, is truly difficult to compass, nor do I know
  that any women or of what class will be present. Trust, however, that all my
  power shall be at your service to gain any wish of your heart,&mdash;and, as
  you know, I am not powerless,&mdash;only remember that it is your will that I
  am doing. I will send a servant who shall lead you to your chamber. Rest,
  prepare, and expect my return before the third hour. Farewell."</p>

  <p>Marcia did not detain him. She noticed the wealth of odours that his
  fluttering gown had left behind, and her contempt and disgust deepened.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap204"
     name="chap204">IV. &mdash; THE HOUSE OF THE NINII CELERES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE rustle of garments aroused Marcia from a sleep wherein
  had been more of bitter revery than of rest; and, glancing up, she saw, at
  the entrance of her apartment, two girls, evidently slaves. They had knelt,
  with arms crossed upon their breasts and downcast eyes.</p>

  <p>"Will my mistress be pleased to place herself in the hands of her
  servants, that she may receive refreshment and whatsoever she desires?"</p>

  <p>The girl's voice was soft and musical. Marcia rose, and, with a slight
  inclination of the head, indicated her acquiescence; then she followed her
  new guides through new halls and rooms, around and through the colonnade, to
  a part of the house beyond the garden. Here were the apartments of the bath,
  and, under the skilful hands of her attendants, she felt the fatigue and
  blights of the journey passing from her. No such artists of luxury were known
  at Rome as were these slave women of Capua; new refinements were revealed at
  every step&mdash;refinements that seemed to culminate when the hair-dresser
  began her work. First came the anointing with the richest odours deftly
  combined from a dozen vials of ivory or fine glass; then the crimping and
  curling with hot irons, the touch of which served also, as the attendant
  explained, to consume whatever coarseness clung to the perfumes and to bring
  out their finest and most delicate effects. Meanwhile the Roman simplicity of
  Marcia's wardrobe and jewel-case had been thoroughly explored, not without
  some scornful side glances on the part of the Capuan women, and she who was
  in charge of the tiring announced their contents to be quite inadequate to
  dress a lady for a banquet of state&mdash;an announcement which brought more
  smiles than blushes to Marcia's face. Still, despite her half-veiled
  contempt, there was nothing to do but resign herself absolutely into the
  hands of such competent authorities, and, besides, she could not say that she
  found the process altogether displeasing.</p>

  <p>The elaborate structure of curls and frizzes had now been confined in
  place by a net of fine gold thread, in which were set, at regular intervals,
  pearls remarkable for their colour and perfect spherical form; then a dozen
  long pins with carved gold heads were passed through the net, and above and
  around all was bound a diadem of thin-beaten gold ornamented with intricate
  open-work tracery. Finally, the hairdresser, having bade Marcia behold
  herself in the polished silver mirror which she held up, retired with an
  expression of serene self-approbation upon her face, and gave way to other
  attendants.</p>

  <p>One of these bound the smallest of jewelled sandals upon feet that were
  too small, even for them; another produced a long palla or sleeveless tunic
  of apple tint ornamented with feather patterns, and fastened it with amethyst
  brooches at the shoulders. Last, the head tirewoman herself came to perform
  what was, after the hair-dressing, the most delicate of all these
  operations&mdash;the adjustment of the cyclas or over-robe, a garment of the
  finest texture and of a shade known as wax-colour, through which the tint and
  ornamentation of the palla produced an effect of inimitable beauty. A
  slender, vine-work design, embroidered in gold, bordered the cyclas, and it
  was in arranging so that the course of this would form harmonious lines,
  wherein the skill and difficulty of the task mainly lay.</p>

  <p>A final appeal to the mirror followed, and then, with Marcia's approval,
  the work was over. She was robed, indeed, for a Capuan banquet, and in a
  manner her simple Roman taste had never dreamed of.</p>

  <p>As yet Calavius had not returned. She sat in the portico of the garden,
  awaiting him, and time was now afforded her to think of her plans, the risk
  she ran, and the objects to be gained. Not since the resolve had first found
  place in her mind had she wavered and feared as now, and an intolerable
  repugnance began to possess her.</p>

  <p>Darkness had veiled the city for several hours, but it was the darkness of
  a southern night and of a city in festal mood. The stars seemed to stand out
  from the blue-gray vault above, as if reaching down to the
  earth&mdash;whether in pity or anger, she could not tell. Around the city
  itself hung the luminous aura of its lights; the cries of revellers sounded
  from the neighbouring streets,&mdash;even the rush of feet,&mdash;while, to
  the eastward, the glow of the Carthaginian watch-fires seemed to reach
  upward to meet the rays of the stars. Yes, these were hostile to the
  invaders! She knew it now. They were the glittering points of Roman pila
  descending upon the foe&mdash;pila driven by the hands that mouldered amid
  the red mire of Cannae. Surely those men approved of what she was about to
  do! Was not Sergius among them, and would he not will her to make good, by
  her beauty, what the sacrifice of his own strength had failed to accomplish?
  What interest had he, now, in her as a woman, as a mistress, as a wife?
  Greater thoughts must inspire the shade that was once her lover: their common
  city, its life and power, the destiny of the world that depended upon the
  preservation of both of these; and still she could not banish the feeling of
  doubt, of disapproval. Perhaps Calavius would not return, or perhaps he might
  not be able to gain for her permission to attend the banquet?</p>

  <p>A commotion at the street entrance, the sound of approaching footsteps,
  and the rustle of a gown seemed about to answer her question. The next
  moment, her host stood before her and surveyed with astonished approval the
  appearance she presented.</p>

  <p>"You are very beautiful," he said slowly and as if thinking with regret
  that he was surrendering such perfection for mere influence and power. "I
  have spoken of you and your wish, and Stenius and Pacuvius&mdash;the Ninii
  Celeres&mdash;consent to your presence. The litters await us in the
  vestibule, and it is time that we set out."</p>

  <p>Marcia rose, and he led her back through the halls and courts.</p>

  <p>"Who will be there?" she asked, as they approached the street door.</p>

  <p>"All of especial note, except Vibius Virrius and Marius Blossius. They are
  away, busied about matters of state. Mago also has just departed on a mission
  to Carthage. There will be no Campanians save our hosts, myself, my son,
  Perolla, and Jubellius Taurea, the bravest of our horsemen. Of our good
  allies, you shall see Hasdrubal, Maharbal, Hannibal-the-Fighter, Silenus the
  Sicilian, who is to write the history of the wars, Iddilcar the priest of
  Melkarth, and the great captain-general himself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Come, let us hasten," said Marcia, quickly, as if fearful lest her
  resolution might forsake her while there was yet chance to withdraw.</p>

  <p>A moment later and Calavius had assisted her into a gorgeously caparisoned
  litter. She hardly noticed the rabble that thronged round the door as she
  passed out, and whom the slaves of her host seemed to keep back with
  difficulty. Still, she was conscious of nudgings, looks, and gestures that
  made her blush, though the words that accompanied them were unintelligible.
  Calavius was furious and paused, as if to give orders for harsher repression.
  Then a voice called out in coarse jargon&mdash;half Latin, half
  Campanian:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"She is pretty, my Pacuvius! Venus grant her to restore your youth!"</p>

  <p>With an effort, he twisted his features into a smile.</p>

  <p>"May the gods favour your wish, my friend!" he said. Then, plunging into
  his litter, he clapped his hands, for the bearers to proceed, and, lying back
  among the cushions, ground his teeth in rage.</p>

  <p>"Ah! I must play to them&mdash;now. Later I shall remember and know how to
  avenge. The lump of filth! Who knows, though, but that he spoke wisdom?
  Perhaps I am truly giving up the hope of my youth to others."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the bearers were running swiftly through the streets; that is,
  as swiftly as the crowds and their condition and humour permitted. Torches
  gleamed everywhere, and, from time to time as the curtains parted slightly,
  Marcia caught glimpses of the scene. The city had abandoned itself to the
  wildest debauchery&mdash;a debauchery that had about it more of the desire to
  drown unpleasant thoughts and haunting fears than of spontaneous exultation
  or mirth; and their drunkenness seemed but a garment, thrown over the head to
  shut out the approaching spectre of Roman retribution. All Capua presented to
  her the spectacular results of a turbulent democracy exalted to power; for
  the vagaries of the Roman plebeians seemed as nothing beside the unbridled
  insolence of this populace. Here was Pacuvius Calavius, who had triumphed by
  their aid over a senate more than half in sympathy with Rome; and now,
  recognizing his litter, they thronged around it, calling out familiar
  greetings, or even sheer vulgarities, pulling the curtains aside, kissing
  their hands to him, and, from time to time, compelling his bearers to pause
  while they slobbered drunken kisses upon his garments and person. No sign of
  true respect greeted their leader; it seemed as if the mob recognized him
  only as the creature of its whim, to be upheld as a facile puppet or cast
  down by the first savage gust of discontent.</p>

  <p>As for Calavius himself, he, too, fell readily into the part assigned him.
  His face was wreathed in a constant smile, his lips spoke only compliments,
  his hands waved greetings, until, at last, Marcia lay back, and, closing her
  eyes, refused to see more of her host's degradation.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the litter-bearers paused and set down their burdens. In distance
  the journey had been short, but the many enforced halts had made it seem as
  if the whole city had been traversed. They were now before the porch of a
  house that was, if possible, even more magnificent than that of Calavius.
  Every column was twined with garlands, flowers hung in festoons from the
  architrave, incense steamed up from brazen tripods set on either side of the
  entrance. In front and around the entire insula, the streets were packed
  dense with a seething crowd, save only for a small space before the
  vestibule, where was stationed a guard of Africans equipped in the manner of
  Roman legionaries. These were rude, wiry soldiers, scornful of civilians and
  their fancied rights, but, above all, contemptuous of the soft Campanian mob
  that arrogated so much and could command so little. At first the populace had
  tried to browbeat and play with them, and the soldiers had sallied out into
  the street and killed a couple of the most talkative, wounding half a dozen
  more. Now the cowardly Capuans stood back in awe, giving passage whenever the
  strangers called for it, and hardly daring to whisper among themselves as to
  what manner of rule they had invited to destroy them. Were it not for this
  summary treatment it is doubtful whether any of the guests would have been
  able to gain the entrance&mdash;least of all Calavius, who was looked upon as
  their peculiar creation and mouthpiece, and at whom a hundred complaints were
  volleyed (in low voices, be it said) as he made his slow way through the
  press.</p>

  <p>Glad to escape at last from a position at once embarrassing and dangerous,
  he now made haste to escort Marcia between the files of foreign guards, into
  the atrium, where the Ninii Celeres&mdash;smiling hosts&mdash;had stationed
  themselves to receive the guests that had been bidden to so important a
  festivity. Thence he led her, muffled as she was, to a vestiarium opening to
  the left side, where were already some half-dozen women, whose attendants
  were adding the finishing graces to toilets disarranged in the litters. One
  of these latter was assigned to Marcia's aid, but a few touches to her hair
  and a slight readjustment of the cyclas were all that was needed.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Roman was watching, with deep interest, the group in the
  court of the atrium. She had taken a position from which she could have an
  unobstructed view through the doorway, and her attendant had evidently
  informed herself as to the identity of the strangers, and was anxious to win
  approval by communicating her knowledge.</p>

  <p>"That is he, most beautiful lady; the one with the long, white tunic, at
  the right of my masters. Is he not poorly dressed for so great a man? Who
  would imagine him of any consequence at all?"</p>

  <p>While the girl spoke, Marcia was regarding earnestly, and for the first
  time, the chief of Carthage, the conqueror of Trebia and Trasimenus and
  Cannae&mdash;of Sempronius and Flaminius and Varro. She saw a man slightly
  above the middle height, well built, with strong, aquiline features and
  thick, black, curling beard and hair, though the latter was worn away at the
  temples by constant pressure of the helmet. It was a face that combined deep
  thought, immeasurable pride, and absolute self-poise and
  inscrutability&mdash;a face that would have been handsome but for the
  disfiguring effect of the eye lost in the marshes of the Arnus. Perhaps it
  was this that lent it something of its prevailing expression of sadness;
  perhaps it was a realization of responsibilities met and to be met and a
  premonition of the inevitable end. His dress was, as the maid had so
  scornfully commented, plain in the extreme&mdash;a striking contrast to the
  celebrated magnificence of his armour and military equipment. Now, a simple,
  white, tunic-like garment, relieved by a narrow border of gold, descended to
  his feet, while a slender gold fillet was his sole ornament in addition to
  the seal finger-ring and heavy earrings, which he wore in common with his
  companions.</p>

  <p>The latter formed a group hardly less interesting than their leader, and
  the girl pointed them out, one by one, and made her approving or slurring
  comments. There was Hasdrubal, coarse-featured, middle-sized, and corpulent,
  whose garments gleamed with purple and gold, and whose ears, fingers, and
  neck glittered with a profusion of jewels. Him Marcia's informant evidently
  regarded with admiration approaching to awe, although his skill as manager of
  the commissariat, and his exploits as a soldier when occasion demanded, were
  probably unknown to her.</p>

  <p>Maharbal, slight and agile, with plain, dark robe and few jewels, with
  hair dressed high, diadem of plumes, and beard worn forked in the Numidian
  fashion, attracted but passing comment. He was doubtless a savage from the
  desert and of little wealth. Another of the generals, however, seemed to
  arouse more positive sentiments: a giant in size, with scarlet tunic, and
  loaded with gold chains and rings and gems, his dark, ferocious face towered
  above the heads of his companions. The woman's voice sank to a whisper as she
  said:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"That is the one they call Hannibal-the-Fighter. They say he never spares
  an enemy, and that he eats the flesh of those he kills. May the gods grant
  that my masters shall wean him to-night from the love of such hideous,
  barbaric fare!"&mdash;and yet, with all her horror, Marcia almost smiled to
  note how the girl looked upon this brute with more of woman's feeling for man
  than she bestowed upon any of his better favoured and more famous
  compatriots.</p>

  <p>From these four the Roman's eyes wandered to a fifth Carthaginian, who
  seemed to complete the tale of guests of that nationality. Her informant had
  passed him by in silence, and had gone on to point out Jubellius Taurea,
  Pacuvius Calavius, and his son, Perolla&mdash;the only Campanians present
  besides the hosts of the occasion. When the category was completed, however,
  she called the maid's attention to the omission.</p>

  <p>"He?" said the latter, lightly; "the man in the violet tunic? He is
  nothing&mdash; a priest of one of their gods whom they call Melkarth."</p>

  <p>He was a tall, gaunt man, and he stood directly behind Hannibal, and kept
  his eyes fixed upon the pavement, as if studying the intricacies of its
  mosaic pattern.</p>

  <p>Silenus, the Greek rhetor, made the last of the group.</p>

  <p>And now, at a signal from the hosts, the company turned and followed them
  in single file toward the rear of the house.</p>

  <p>"They will send for you when they have reclined," said the attendant, in
  answer to a glance of inquiry from Marcia; and, a moment later, the summons
  came.</p>

  <p>Walls, floors, ceilings, every part of the house through which they
  passed, seemed covered with roses clustered, festooned, and superlaid.
  Suddenly they found themselves at the entrance of the great banquet hall,
  where two triclinia were set facing each other, with room for the servants to
  pass between and minister to the wants of the feasters.</p>

  <p>At the table to the east&mdash;that of honour&mdash;reclined Stenius
  Ninius, in the middle place of the middle couch, with Hannibal himself at his
  right, the place of honour above all. Marcia was led to the head of the
  lowest couch, next to the Carthaginian leader, where she found Pacuvius
  Calavius reclining below her, as the phrase went; while on the couch directly
  opposite lay the priest of Melkarth in the lowest place, and Perolla in the
  highest. The other places, below Pacuvius, between Stenius and the priest,
  and between the priest and Perolla, were assigned to the women, while the
  other table, over which Pacuvius Ninius presided, was arranged in similar
  fashion.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap205"
     name="chap205">V. &mdash; THE BANQUET</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MARCIA had felt an instinctive shrinking when she saw that
  the women, also, were to recline, after the manner of the dissolute Greeks,
  instead of sitting, as she had been taught to consider the only decent
  posture for a Roman maid or matron. Then the thought of her mission brought
  the blush surging to her cheeks, whence it receded, leaving them pale with a
  sterner resolve. Was not love of country the greatest virtue? It was time to
  school herself, to shrink at nothing in that cause. As she took her place,
  she noticed that the priest of Melkarth, who lay directly opposite, had been
  regarding her fixedly.</p>

  <p>She could see his face now, and it was not a pleasing one. The Semitic
  features, fine and noble in their best form, but capable of greater depths of
  degeneration than those of any other type, were in his case exaggerated to an
  extreme degree of coarseness. The mouth was large and badly formed, the
  forehead low, the small eyes peered out snakelike from under heavy, puffy
  lids. The nose alone was cut with any measure of fineness, and that
  projected, wide-nostrilled, and aquiline as the beak of a bird of prey. It
  would have been difficult to imagine a face more gross and sensual in its
  lines, and the look of low admiration and eagerness which it now wore, was
  well calculated to bring out the sensuality in its most repulsive form.
  Marcia felt her cheeks burning under the fixedness of the man's gaze, and,
  looking down, she struggled to compose herself by a close study of the
  gorgeous coverlid of the couch,&mdash;a fine Campanian texture, dyed scarlet,
  and heavily embroidered with figures of birds and beasts and flowers, worked
  into an elaborate design.</p>

  <p>Even then, his eyes seemed to burn through her hair, through her brain,
  down into her heart, and she found her will revolting more violently than
  ever against the possibilities involved in her mission.</p>

  <p>The voice of Hannibal, addressing some conventional compliment to Stenius
  upon the perfection of the arrangements, came as an intense relief, for the
  others all turned toward the speaker, and, a moment later, the slaves passed
  around with silver basins and ewers, pouring scented water upon the hands of
  the guests and drying them with dainty flickings of filmy napkins. Vessels of
  gold and silver and fine earthenware burdened the tables, while at each end
  of the garden stood a butler in charge of several large amphorae. Those at
  the north end were half buried amid imitation mountains, peaked with real
  snow wherewith the wine was to be cooled, while those at the south were
  surrounded by more than tropical verdure, with the braziers and vessels of
  hot water beside them, ready for mixing the warm draughts.</p>

  <p>And now the slaves hurried hither and thither, bearing costly dishes with
  elaborately dressed viands: dormice strewed with honey and poppy seeds;
  beccaficoes surrounded by yolks of eggs, seasoned with pepper and made to
  resemble peafowls' eggs in a nest whereon the stuffed bird was sitting; fish
  floating in rich gravies that spouted from the mouths of four tritons at the
  corners of the dish; crammed fowls, hares fitted with wings to resemble
  Pegasus, thrushes in pastry stuffed with raisins and nuts, oysters, scallops,
  snails on silver gridirons, boar stuffed with fieldfares, with baskets of
  figs and dates hanging from his tusks, sweetmeats, cold tarts with Spanish
  honey&mdash;these and a hundred other dishes, strange or costly, followed
  each other in quick succession, and, all the while, the carvers flourished
  their knives in time with music, now of instruments, again of choruses of
  boys and girls. The butlers, too, had not been idle, and the cups were
  constantly replenished, first with the warm and, later, with the cold
  mixtures.</p>

  <p>Yet, though both men and women ate greedily and drank deeply, a gloom
  seemed to hang over the feast. The Carthaginians, whether influenced by
  native dignity or by a real or simulated contempt for their hosts, were
  reserved and silent, while the Capuans seemed, at one moment, forcing
  themselves into strained merriment, and, at another, cowering before the cold
  eyes that watched their efforts with scarcely veiled indifference. With fear
  on the one side and distrust upon the other, the chances for hilarity and
  good fellowship looked scanty enough, and yet Stenius Ninius was too much a
  man of the world to yield readily to untoward social conditions.</p>

  <p>Clapping his hands, he cried out, as the head butler bowed before
  him:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Now, my good Cappadox, let us have no more of these native vintages. Good
  though they were, they but serve to cultivate the taste for the wines that
  cement friendships such as ours. Henceforth pour for us only the Coan,
  Leucadian, and Thasian, and see that you select those amphorae whose contents
  are toothless with age."</p>

  <p>A rough laugh rolled up from the other table, and the voice of
  Hannibal-the-Fighter broke out with:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It is well said, host. Truly I was wondering if we had been drinking from
  the famous cellars of Capua. We washed our horses with better wine in the
  north."</p>

  <p>Stenius flushed. Then he smiled.</p>

  <p>"And, Cappadox," he went on, in an unruffled voice, "do you send what
  remains in my cellar of the vintages we have been drinking, to the horse of
  my worthy guest."</p>

  <p>At the giant's discourteous words, Hannibal himself had started from the
  mood of thought in which he had seemed well-nigh buried. A quick glance shot
  from his eye, and his brow furrowed. Then the courtly answer of Stenius
  relieved the situation, and he turned to his host.</p>

  <p>"You must pardon rough words to rough soldiers, my friend. We of Carthage
  have had but slender chances to avail ourselves of Greek culture and
  urbanity. We are mere merchants and warriors&mdash;not men of letters or of
  social manners."</p>

  <p>The hulking savage grew purple and trembled under the rebuke of his chief.
  Twice he essayed to speak and then discreetly gulped down the words, for
  Hannibal's face, though calm and courtly, showed a hardening of its lines
  which meant much to those who knew him.</p>

  <p>As for the Campanian, he raised his hands in voluble deprecation of the
  apology.</p>

  <p>Did <i>he</i> not realize that but for soldiers and merchants, letters and
  social manners would never have come into being? It was the privilege of so
  brave a warrior as Hannibal-the-Fighter to say what he pleased, and when and
  where. Ordinary rules were only for little men. Besides, the best of
  Campanian wines were truly all too poor for heroes whose souls were already
  attasted to the nectar of the gods.</p>

  <p>The suppressed fury and shame of the offender melted away under the balm
  of these honeyed words, and, laughing loudly but with some constraint, he
  tossed off to his host a cup of the wine last brought.</p>

  <p>And now Hannibal seemed to shake himself loose from the bonds of silence
  and thought, though his conversation still showed the trend of his mind. He
  turned to Calavius.</p>

  <p>"Thirty thousand foot and four thousand horse form an excellent array, and
  yet I should imagine that the second city in Italy could do even
  better&mdash;in case of need."</p>

  <p>The attention of hosts and guests became tense at once, though Marcia
  could note that the motives were diverse.</p>

  <p>Calavius seemed nervous and flustered.</p>

  <p>"There was a time when that was undoubtedly so, my Lord," he said hastily;
  "but, now, many of our young men have fallen in the wars, and many are
  serving with the enemy, unable to escape and doubtless in serious
  danger&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Three hundred horsemen," interrupted Hannibal, dryly, "and my spies
  inform me that they are likely to continue serving Rome&mdash;by choice, as
  would doubtless many of your well-born at home&mdash;like this fellow,
  Magius," and his brow darkened ominously.</p>

  <p>The Campanians moved uneasily on the couches.</p>

  <p>"Magius is a traitor and will be dealt with in due season," said Stenius.
  "It is friends and festivities first with us, and enemies and punishments
  later."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Magius shall be dealt with," echoed Hannibal; but the acquiescence
  brought no relief to his hearers. Why should he feel it necessary to
  supplement their assurance so significantly? Did not the treaty between
  Carthage and Capua provide that Capuan laws and magistrates should still
  govern all Capuans? Why should he speak so markedly of their military power?
  Did not the treaty expressly state that no Capuan was to be called upon for
  military duty except by his own rulers?</p>

  <p>Calavius had been signalling vigorously to his son, Perolla, who had
  reclined silent and gloomy, but who now seemed about to speak. Disregarding
  his father's warning, the young man broke in:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It is idle to deny that the Campanian horse serve willingly with Rome and
  will continue so to serve. As for Decius Magius, there are many good men here
  who hold with him, but who lack his boldness."</p>

  <p>For an instant every one held his breath in terror of the coming outburst,
  but those whose angry or frightened eyes first ventured to glance toward the
  captain-general saw his face wreathed in smiles, and his wine cup raised
  toward the daring speaker.</p>

  <p>"Happiness to you, flower of Campanian youth! and know that there are two
  things that Hannibal prizes most among men: a friend who was once an enemy,
  and a friend who dares to speak the truth."</p>

  <p>Calavius had recovered his composure during this speech.</p>

  <p>"I would not have you imagine, my Lord," he began, "but that my son speaks
  as he believes and in order that you may have full information; yet, he is
  ill to-day in body and mind, and, even were it not so, I am older than he and
  know more of men. That Decius Magius has sympathizers, it is vain to deny;
  but that they are many or influential, I, who know the Capuans, aver is not
  the case. As for our horsemen, it is easy to see that their safety demands an
  apparent friendship for Rome. It is not wise for three hundred to revile
  thirty thousand."</p>

  <p>Hannibal had continued to keep his gaze upon Perolla, scarcely listening
  to his father's words. In the young man's face something of surprise had
  mingled with his half-defiant, half-moody expression.</p>

  <p>"I do not ask of you, my son," pursued the general, "that you whose heart
  was but lately with our enemies, should love and trust us at once. That were
  the part of a hypocrite, and I honour you, both for the filial piety that
  threw down your preference before your father's will, and for the slowness
  with which your heart follows your act. Grant me but this: that you judge us
  fairly by our deeds, and if we prove not better friends than Rome, return to
  them in peace and safety. Meanwhile there is a horse with crimson mane and
  feet that shall be led from my stable to yours in the morning. Ride him, and
  remember that Hannibal honours courage, filial obedience, and truth&mdash;all
  in like measure."</p>

  <p>Subdued applause from both tables followed these words, but the face of
  Perolla lost but little of its stubborn hostility. Hannibal turned away, and
  Calavius and Ninius sought to cover by eager talking the young man's
  ungracious reception of such signal favour. The faces of the Carthaginians
  remained for the most part impassive; only their dark eyes seemed to sparkle,
  either with wine or suppressed passion. Marcia still felt that one pair was
  trying to look through her, and she was conscious that Silenus, the Sicilian
  Greek, was making eager and indecorous love to one of the women at the other
  table. Another of the latter had just ventured on some light badinage with
  the chief guest, in whose face smiles had chased away all the abstraction of
  the earlier hours. He answered her as lightly, but with indifference, and
  turned to Marcia.</p>

  <p>"And what says our Roman beauty?" he asked. "She has come boldly and far
  to see her enemies. Who knows but she has a boon to beg."</p>

  <p>Again Marcia noted disturbance under Calavius' smile. He was wondering at
  the general's knowledge. Then he realized that Mago's report must be its
  basis, and his face cleared.</p>

  <p>"Yes, truly, I <i>have</i> a boon to ask," replied Marcia, fixing her
  great eyes upon the bearded front, stern through its smiles. "It is that you
  will spare one house in Italy from ravage and destruction."</p>

  <p>"And where may this house be?" he asked in bantering tones. "We shall
  leave many standing, but this one most surely of all."</p>

  <p>"It is upon the brow of the Palatine Hill&mdash;" she began, and then a
  burst of applause gave notice that the compliment had struck home. "It is my
  father's," she concluded, blushing.</p>

  <p>Calavius was in ecstasy over the graceful tact of his protg. No Capuan
  or Greek could have done better. Hannibal eyed her with a curious expression,
  half admiring, half doubtful.</p>

  <p>"I grant the boon&mdash;freely," he said. Then, fixing her with his gaze,
  he went on, "And when will you claim it?"</p>

  <p>"The son of Hamilcar knows best," replied Marcia, casting down her eyes,
  and again she felt the approval of her host and his friends.</p>

  <p>That Hannibal was pleased and flattered was evident, and yet there was a
  certain reserve in his manner. Possibly he suspected that she wished to
  provoke an announcement of his plans; perhaps an even deeper insight led him
  near to a fuller conception of her purpose.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is truly for us to say," he said loudly, glancing around the
  board; then, turning quickly to Marcia: "I understand that you counselled
  delay until spring to my brother, Mago. Why?"</p>

  <p>So frank a question, so different from all that had been told of the more
  than Oriental craft of the Carthaginians, and one that went so straight to
  the motive of her presence, threw Marcia into some confusion. Calavius
  noticed it, and, fearing lest she might say something to do away with the
  impression of her former tact, he came to the rescue.</p>

  <p>"Surely we shall not insult my Lord Bacchus by a council of war in his
  presence?" but Hannibal waved his hand toward him and looked fixedly at
  Marcia.</p>

  <p>"Goddesses may speak on all subjects, at all times; and the gods
  smile."</p>

  <p>"That my words," she began, with eyes still cast down, "were deemed worthy
  to be borne to my Lord, is too much honour. That he should deem them worthy
  of thought, is beyond the dream of mere woman." Then, glancing up and smiling
  wistfully into his face, she went on: "Know, that whatever of judgment born
  of knowledge of the place and the men has come to me, a girl,&mdash;that and
  more is for the service of the great general of Carthage,&mdash;the benignant
  liberator of Italy."</p>

  <p>"Why do you advise delay?" asked Hannibal again, and the eyes of Maharbal
  glittered, as he leaned over from the other table. "There are those who say I
  have delayed too long already."</p>

  <p>"For this," replied Marcia, boldly; "that you may save your soldiers and
  your allies; that they may lie in rest and luxury, and that, ere springtime,
  the cities of the Latin Name, yes, truly, and the very rabble of Rome, shall
  come to you on their knees for leave to bear the horseheads along the Sacred
  Way, up the Capitoline slope&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If in the spring, why not now?"</p>

  <p>Maharbal and Hannibal-the-Fighter made a clucking sound of assent;
  Hasdrubal and the other guests seemed indifferent, but the Capuans were
  hanging on Marcia's words.</p>

  <p>"Because the time is not ripe&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>"Words!" cried her questioner, cutting off her speech; "I asked,
  <i>why</i>?"</p>

  <p>Frightened at his vehemence, but put to it of necessity, she
  answered:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Because there are strifes and bickerings&mdash;at Rome&mdash;throughout
  the Latin Name&mdash; that must soon bear fruit of civil strife. The nobles
  grind and hold to their privileges; the commons serve and starve and look to
  Carthage for aid. How shall these things grow better, while you hold the
  garden of Italy&mdash;while the Greeks of the south and the Samnites and the
  men of the soil gather behind you on one side, and the Gauls and Etruscans
  muster in the north? The water is eating at the mole; soon the waves will
  lash up and sweep it from its foundations."</p>

  <p>Hannibal eyed her closely for a moment. Then he said: "There are those at
  Rome and among the Latin Name who tell me otherwise. They are good men, and
  they know. Perhaps I have been even too cautious. You are young and
  beautiful. Hold fast to matters suited to youth and beauty, and leave the
  conduct of wars and statecraft to men." Turning to Stenius, he went on, "If
  this Leucadian wine of yours, my Stenius, were let into the veins of those
  who lie dead at Cannae, they would be fit to rise and do battle again."</p>

  <p>Stenius bowed and smiled; Marcia grew red and then pale with shame and
  vexation, seeing how her plots were like to fall and crush her; but, at this
  moment, the voice of Hannibal-the-Fighter rose from the other table. Flushed
  with wine, he was boasting of his slain. "Four at Trebia," he cried out,
  "seven at Trasimenus, eighteen at Cannae&mdash;but all men. It is better to
  slay the wolves' whelps, if only to teach women that it is no longer wise to
  bring forth Romans. I&mdash;I who speak have already killed eleven
  boys&mdash;ah! but you must wait till we enter Rome. Then will be the day
  when they shall build new cities in Hades!"</p>

  <p>The Carthaginians heard him with indifference; the Capuans, all save
  Perolla, applauded nervously; and Marcia grew sick at heart and mad with a
  rage that could almost have strangled the giant as he reclined.</p>

  <p>"And now," began Ninius, mildly, when there was a moment's silence, "that
  we may the better enjoy what is to come, there are baths and attendants; and
  the red feather will make way for new feastings at the end of two hours."</p>

  <p>Slaves had run in to assist the diners from their couches; the Capuans,
  with dreams of relief, refreshment, and re-repletion; the Carthaginians,
  bored, but striving to be polite and to follow the customs of their
  entertainers. Even Hannibal, while his smile was half a frown, permitted
  himself to be led away.</p>

  <p>Filled with disgust and despair, Marcia felt herself all unfit to begin a
  new revel&mdash;one that was to be made possible by loathsome practices, as
  yet unknown at Rome, and which bade fair to end in aimless and hideous
  debauchery. The women were but warming to their part, when the summons of
  Stenius Ninius had proclaimed a truce with Bacchus and Venus&mdash;a truce
  with promise of more deadly battle to be joined. She had seen glances hot
  with wine and lust, claspings of hands, loosened cyclas, and more lascivious
  reclinings. The gloomy Perolla had yielded a little to the soft influences,
  and even Hannibal seemed to force himself to toying, if only in the name of
  courtesy; while, through it all, and more and more as the light of day
  advanced, Marcia felt the eyes of Iddilcar, priest of Melkarth, burning into
  her soul. He at least gave no heed to nearer blandishments, and terror and
  loathing filled her in equal measure.</p>

  <p>A faintness&mdash;a sudden weakness born of her recent
  journey&mdash;served for excuse, which Calavius seemed not unwilling to
  voice, and, surrounded by a guard of slaves, her litter bore her back to his
  house, through streets littered with drunken men and fluctuant with the
  figured robes of courtesans.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap206"
     name="chap206">VI. &mdash; ALLIES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">NIGHT had come again, before Marcia could arouse herself
  from the deep sleep with which exhaustion of mind and body had overwhelmed
  her. She remembered the scenes of the banquet as the phantasms of a
  dream&mdash;strange and terrible; for her thoughts were slow to gather the
  threads and weave the woof. Only a feeling of failure, of fruitless
  abasement, was ever present. Hannibal had admired her, but, proof against any
  controlling attraction, he had put her words aside with little short of
  contempt. A dread, even, lest the strange acumen of this wonderful man had
  pierced her mask, and that her very motive and mission were already
  suspected, was not lacking to add dismay to discouragement. Such thoughts
  were but wretched company, and they brought with them a vague conception of
  her own vain egotism in imagining the possibility of other outcome. She tried
  to sleep again, but could not. What mattered it though, by some shifting of
  hours, her day had become night and her night day! She must arise and talk
  with some one, if it were only the host whom she so heartily despised.</p>

  <p>Attendants entered at her summons, and the refreshment of the bath and the
  labour of the toilet were once more passed through. Then, dismissing the
  slaves, she walked out alone into the garden and sat down on a softly
  cushioned seat of carved marble. A fountain plashed soothingly in the foliage
  near by, the stars were shining again, while, from without, the jarring
  sounds of the city came to her ears.</p>

  <p>How long she sat, awake yet thinking of nothing, dull and dazed, she could
  not tell. Then she was aroused by a sandalled step upon the pavement. A man
  was standing before her, whose face, despite its youthful contours, was
  deep-lined and melancholy. He was short of stature and slenderly though
  gracefully built, and his black curls clustered over brow and eyes that
  seemed rather those of a poet or a dreamer than of a man of action. In the
  sombre, dark blue garments of mourning, without ornaments or jewels, so
  different from the gay banqueting robes in which she had last seen him,
  Marcia gazed a moment, before she recognized Perolla, the son of
  Pacuvius.</p>

  <p>"You are not pretty to-night, Scylla," he said tauntingly, "though you
  left us early. There are dark circles under the eyes that looked kindly at
  the enemy of your country."</p>

  <p>Marcia flushed crimson, and he went on: "Yes; I watched you smiling and
  ogling, but it will take greater traitors than you to snare him. He is like
  Minos, in that he did not reach out to take from your hands the purple lock
  shorn from your father's head: he is not like him otherwise: he is not just,
  and he will not give honourable terms."</p>

  <p>"You, at least, are faithful to Rome?" said Marcia, slowly, and ignoring
  his insults.</p>

  <p>"Can you ask?" he answered; "is it that you wish to betray me? Well, then,
  know truly that I have betrayed myself to your heart's content. Do you not
  see the mourning garments I wear for my city's faithlessness and for her
  coming ruin? Have you not heard how my father dragged me from the side of
  Decius Magius in the market place that I might attend the banquet?&mdash;ah!
  but you have not heard how I had planned to startle them all."</p>

  <p>Marcia began to wonder whether she was talking with a madman.</p>

  <p>"Shall I tell?"</p>

  <p>She made a sign of assent.</p>

  <p>"It was toward evening&mdash;they have but just risen from the tables now.
  Then, it was to seek the red feathers for the third time; but I led my father
  back among the rose bushes and showed him a sword which I had girt to my
  side, beneath my tunic. 'This,' said I, 'shall win us pardon from Rome. Look
  you, when we return, I will plunge it into the Carthaginian's breast.'"</p>

  <p>Marcia bent forward eagerly.</p>

  <p>"And then," he went on, "my father bound my arms to my sides, with his own
  around me, and wept and talked of our recent pledges to these foreigners.
  'Can they outweigh our ancient pledges to Rome?'I answered. So he pleaded how
  the attendants would surely cut me down, and mentioned Hannibal's look, which
  he affirmed I would not be able to confront; but I laughed and made little of
  these things. Then he spoke of the hospitable board, which I admitted had
  something of reason; and, finally, when he had declared that the sword must
  reach Hannibal only through his own breast, then, at last, from filial duty,
  mark you, I threw the weapon from me, telling him that he had betrayed his
  country thrice: in revolting from Rome, in allying with foreigners, and, now,
  in turning aside the instrument of escape. Then we returned to the banquet,
  but my father trembled, and ate and drank no more. There, now, is a story to
  tell your city's destroyer. If you betray me, perhaps he may yet love
  you."</p>

  <p>Marcia viewed him sternly.</p>

  <p>"Truly your father was right, when he said you were ill in mind."</p>

  <p>"Yes, ill in mind and in heart."</p>

  <p>"How, then, do you not recognize one whose heart is sicker than your
  own?"</p>

  <p>Perolla looked at her inquiringly, and she went on:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You have a city that has been false to itself, and is in danger of
  punishment&mdash;a father, too, if you will. <i>My</i> city has already
  suffered every evil but destruction: my brother and he to whom Juno was about
  to lead me have been killed by these pulse-eaters. Are such things the
  benefits that go to make friendship and love for the slayers? Say, rather,
  hate and the craving for revenge."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Perolla, moodily; "they are indeed evils, but less than mine,
  in that they are passed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And is Rome safe, do you think?" she asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"Rome will conquer," he said doggedly, "unless there be many more traitors
  like you."</p>

  <p>"Fool!" she cried, grasping his wrist. "Can you not see&mdash;you who
  claim to be a philosopher and to have Greek blood?&mdash;you, at least,
  should have understood my words."</p>

  <p>He gazed at her vacantly, and she began to regret her vehemence. It came
  to her mind that this was not altogether a safe man to trust with her secret.
  Faithful he was, no doubt; but a fool might be even more dangerous than a
  traitor. Still, she had said too much to be silent, and she felt the need of
  some ally to whom she could talk&mdash;upon whom she could at least pretend
  to lean when the weight of her burden was heaviest.</p>

  <p>"I have told you what I have lost&mdash;what I dread to lose. Now learn
  what I am here to gain. For many days after the black news of Cannae, I heard
  them talking in my father's house&mdash;talking of the advance of the
  insolent victors and of the paltry defence we could oppose, the certain
  destruction that awaited us. Still they were brave&mdash;old men and boys.
  The soldiers were dead, but we set to work training new&mdash;shaping them
  alike out of youth and age and bondmen; and the slayers of our citizens
  delayed, and we gained strength and courage. In every temple of the twelve
  gods it was the same prayer by day and night: 'Grant us delay. Grant us that
  the winter may find him in the south!' At last came the news that he was
  advancing to Capua, and rumours of a Carthaginian party in the city. From
  Capua, seized with all its engines of war, was but a few days to Rome. Then I
  took a resolve and made a vow: tell me, am I beautiful?"</p>

  <p>"Beautiful as Venus."</p>

  <p>"Know, then, that I have dedicated this beauty to her, that she may guard
  Rome and avenge me upon Rome's enemies."</p>

  <p>He shook his head stupidly.</p>

  <p>"Minerva does not favour me, lady," he replied; "for I do not understand
  your words."</p>

  <p>"Listen!" she went on, with the earnestness of desperation, "He shall
  <i>love</i> me&mdash;he or one who can sway him&mdash;and they shall play the
  laggards here, until the winter gives us time&mdash;and time brings
  safety."</p>

  <p>He understood her now, but still he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"If you speak truth," he said slowly, "you speak foolishness as well.
  Hannibal will love no mistress but Carthage, and there is no man living who
  shall sway him by a hair's breadth. <i>Now</i> I see why you spoke to him of
  plots at Rome and of the wisdom of delay. Ah! a woman to make game of
  <i>him</i>!" and he threw back his head and laughed. "Do you imagine he has
  not divined your plot? Give him your beauty if you will. He will take it,
  doubtless, if he have time, and march north forthwith, after you have
  confessed your little plottings beneath the hot tweezers. Only one thing
  shall stay him&mdash; steel,&mdash;and in the hands of man&mdash;not
  blandishments in the mouth of a girl."</p>

  <p>Marcia was in despair.</p>

  <p>"And is there no help," she cried, "for me, a Roman woman, from you, a
  friend of Rome? Surely we shall be stronger together, even if our plots are
  different. Two plans are better than one."</p>

  <p>Before he could frame his answer they heard footsteps coming toward them,
  and then a man, enveloped in the brown cloak of a slave, pushed aside the
  foliage and glided out into the moonlight. Perolla, wheeling about, had half
  drawn his sword, while Marcia shrunk back into the shadow.</p>

  <p>"Put up your sword, my Perolla," said the newcomer, speaking in low tones
  and throwing aside his mantle.</p>

  <p>"Decius Magius, by all the gods!" cried the young man; "but why are you
  disguised?"</p>

  <p>"Because, my friend," said Magius, slowly "Capua is no longer free;
  because spies of the Carthaginian and of our senate are watching my house,
  making ready to seize me. Decius Magius can no longer walk in his own city,
  clad in his own gown, and to-morrow, doubtless, he cannot walk at all.
  Therefore I wish to speak with you, and I have put on this disguise in order
  that I might gain your house unobserved, and that your father might not die
  of fright, learning me to be here."</p>

  <p>"But how did you enter? how find me?"</p>

  <p>"I entered, my Perolla, because your porter, like every slave in Capua, is
  drunk to-night, and because the boy whom he left to keep the gate was only
  enough awake to mumble that you were in the garden."</p>

  <p>Perolla frowned. Then, suddenly, he remembered Marcia, concerning whom his
  suspicions were not yet entirely removed, and he raised his hand in
  warning.</p>

  <p>"There is a woman here&mdash;a Roman woman, who tells a strange story," he
  whispered. "It is better to be discreet."</p>

  <p>"The time for discretion is past for Decius Magius," said the other,
  wearily. "Let him at least speak freely upon his last night of freedom."</p>

  <p>Marcia came forward.</p>

  <p>"Is it permitted a Roman maid to honour a Campanian who is true to his
  city's faith?"</p>

  <p>"Assuredly, daughter," replied Magius, quietly. She could not see his face
  except that it was stern and gray-bearded; but, kneeling down beside him, she
  took his hand and poured out the story of her life, her sorrow, her resolve,
  and its prosecution. Here, at least, was a man upon whose faith and judgment
  she could rely, and his manner grew more gentle as she made an end of
  speaking.</p>

  <p>"So you doubted her truth, my Perolla," he said softly. "That is because
  you have not felt her hand tremble, and because you are too young and too
  much of a philosopher to judge of the honesty of a woman's face. The same
  instinct that tells me, doubtless warned Hannibal also that this was not a
  courtesan, much less an immodest woman well born, and, least of all, a coward
  who would flee her city, or a traitress who would betray it. You will know
  more of such things, my Perolla, when you learn to study them less." Then,
  turning to Marcia, he went on: "What you have designed, my daughter, is noble
  and worthy of your race&mdash;and yet, while I commend, I am slow to
  encourage. Are you strong to carry your sacrifice to the uttermost?"</p>

  <p>Marcia shuddered.</p>

  <p>"Yes, if there be need," she said, in a low voice; "I look to no marriage
  now. Is not the Republic worthy of our best?"</p>

  <p>"It is a hard thing," he said, doubtfully, "for a woman well born and
  modest to belong to a man she hates."</p>

  <p>"But it is easy to die, my father, as died Lucretia."</p>

  <p>Decius Magius looked at her. Several times his lips moved as if about to
  speak, and, once, he turned away sharply for a moment, as if to gaze up into
  the night.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, my father," she said earnestly, "do you give me no hope? Is not
  my beauty worth the purchase of a few paltry months? And then comes the
  winter, bringing safety."</p>

  <p>Still Magius said nothing for several minutes, and when he spoke, it was
  in harsh, quick tones.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is all possible, as you say it."</p>

  <p>"Hannibal to surrender his plans for a woman?" cried Perolla, scornfully.
  "Surely, my Decius, you jest. Do you not know him&mdash;that only the gods
  can turn him from his purpose?"</p>

  <p>Marcia had wheeled about with flashing eyes and faced the last
  speaker.</p>

  <p>"You have shown me the way," she cried. "It is the gods who
  <i>shall</i>delay him."</p>

  <p>Perolla gazed at her in astonishment, as at one gone mad, but Magius
  nodded and frowned.</p>

  <p>"It is the best chance," he said slowly, "the only one."</p>

  <p>"Still Minerva does not favour me," said Perolla, shaking his head; but
  Marcia went on in a high, nervous voice and with a gayety that made the older
  man draw his cloak up to his face in pity:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Come, my philosopher, you are indeed stupid to-night. If you did not
  observe it at the house of the Ninii, you should have heard me just now when
  I told the story of the banquet to my lord Decius. It is Iddilcar, the priest
  of Melkarth, who shall bring his god to be my ally&mdash;Rome's ally:
  Iddilcar, who could not so much as take his eyes from me, through all their
  feasting. There is the man who will prefer my beauty, even to his god's
  favour; and surely your Hannibal will not wage war against the auspices."</p>

  <p>The face of Magius was still shaded by his cloak, and he said nothing; but
  over the features of the younger man came strange expressions: first
  amazement, then horror, then a look which had something of horror but more of
  yearning. He held out his hands in supplication.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no," he cried. "You shall not do it. You are too beautiful.
  First I hated you, when I dreamed you to be but a courtesan traitress.
  Now&mdash;now&mdash;O gods favour me! Listen! you shall not do it. It is I
  who will kill him&mdash;yes, and you also first," and, turning suddenly away,
  he staggered. Then, as Magius raised his hand to support him, he shook
  himself free and ran furiously into the house.</p>

  <p>Marcia turned to Magius in astonishment, and he smiled sadly.</p>

  <p>"Even philosophers are not proof," he said; "and you are very
  beautiful&mdash;and he is young&mdash; and half a Greek." She blushed, and
  the grim senator took her hand. "May the gods grant, my daughter, that your
  sacrifice be not for nothing. You have spoken wisdom; but he&mdash;he is a
  madman. As for me, I am as one who is dead. Farewell."</p>

  <p>He dropped her hand, and she felt, rather than heard or saw him go; only
  her voice would not obey her when she strove to detain him, if but for a
  moment: the only man in Capua whom she could honour&mdash;upon whom she could
  rely. Surely he would not desert her thus?&mdash; yes, truly, he was
  <i>gone</i>.</p>

  <p>Then she ran several steps in the direction he had taken, and called,
  though she dared not call his name, until a female attendant came hurrying to
  answer her.</p>

  <p>"My lord, Perolla," said the girl, "had but just rushed out into the
  street, as if possessed of a daimon. As for a strange slave, she had observed
  no one; but if such there was, doubtless he had slipped by the porter's
  boy&mdash;who was worthless."</p>

  <p>Marcia groped her way to her sleeping apartment, harshly brushing aside an
  offer of aid. Once alone, she threw herself down upon the couch and burst
  into a torrent of moans and sobs.</p>

  <p>The girl, who had followed hesitatingly, listened in the hallway, nodding
  her head with conscious satisfaction. "And so the Roman women loved, for all
  they were said to be so grand and stern. What a fool this one was, though, to
  prefer the son to the father, who was much richer, and who, being old, would
  doubtless realize the necessity of being more generous."</p>

  <p>And she went back to the slaves' apartments, laughing softly to
  herself.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap207"
     name="chap207">VII. &mdash; "FREEDOM."</a></h2><br>

  <p>The morning air of the Seplasia reeked with perfumes, more, even, than was
  its wont; for Carthaginian and Capuan revellers had been carousing there, and
  several of the shops had been broken open. The gutters streamed wine with
  which were mingled all the essences of India and Asia. Flowers, withered and
  soaked with coarser odours than their own, floated on the pools and drifted
  down the rivulets. Inert bodies, drunk to repletion, lay scattered about,
  helpless, unable to drink consciously, but absorbing the wasted liquor
  through every pore. A dead citizen, his head crushed in by a single blow,
  sprawled hideously in the middle of the street; while his murderer, a
  gigantic Gaul, was embracing the corpse with maudlin affection and whispering
  in its ear to arise and guide him back to camp. Those who passed, from time
  to time, paused to join the soldier's comrades in laughter and rude jests and
  suggestions of new methods of awakening his friend.</p>

  <p>And now, down the street, extending from wall to wall, came a line of
  young men, their faces flushed, their garments disordered or cast aside, and
  their brows crowned with what had once been chaplets of roses. Three or four
  courtesans, with gowns and tunics torn from their white shoulders, were being
  dragged along, half laughing, half resisting, and wholly possessed by Bacchic
  frenzy.</p>

  <p>In front of the company marched a slender youth with dark, curling hair
  and delicate features. In his hand was a thyrsis, and his eyes blazed with
  the madness of the wine.</p>

  <p>"Evoe! evoe!" he shouted. "Comrades! Bacchantes! there is no water in
  Capua to mix with wine. Equal mixture for poets and fools; undiluted wine for
  victors and lovers!"</p>

  <p>"Perolla is a good Carthaginian to-day," shouted one of his fellows.
  "Behold how Bacchus has answered our prayers! Kiss him, Cluvia, for a
  reward."</p>

  <p>Pushed forward, the courtesan fell upon the young man's neck, almost
  bearing him to the street and overwhelming him with drunken caresses. A
  moment later he freed himself from her arms.</p>

  <p>"What is Roman beauty to our Capuan?" he hiccoughed.
  "Marcia&mdash;Cluvia&mdash;all are one. All are women, and we are Capuans;
  braver than Romans, wiser than Carthaginians. Listen, friends! when my father
  rules Italy, you shall all be kings and queens. Evoe! evoe!"</p>

  <p>Shouts and shrieks of drunken joy greeted his words. Several sought to
  embrace him, and, staggering back, he stumbled over the Gaul and the dead
  Capuan where they sprawled in the street. Mingled laughter and curses rose
  all around. Blows and kisses were given and received, and the mad company
  rolled on through the Seplasia and into the Forum.</p>

  <p>Here, too, were intoxication and debauchery, but they were restrained
  within some manner of bounds. The fact that grave events were taking place,
  seemed to exert a sobering influence on the populace, and they gathered in a
  dense throng around the Senate House, whence ominous rumours pursued each
  other in quick succession.</p>

  <p>"The Senate was in session. Hannibal was before them. Decius Magius had
  been arrested at his demand." So ran the talk.</p>

  <p>Guards of Carthaginian soldiery were posted at several points, but
  especially at all the entrances to the chamber in which the fathers of the
  city discussed&mdash;or obeyed; and against these lines the waves of the
  rabble surged and broke and receded. Men offered the soldiers money for free
  passage or news; women offered them kisses for money; and the soldiers took
  both and gave nothing but jeers and blows.</p>

  <p>Perolla and his drunken company had but just poured out to swell the tide
  of this ocean of popular passion, when a commotion of a different character
  began at the other end of the Forum. The closed door of the Senate House
  swung open, and a man in the garb of a senator, but chained and shackled,
  issued forth and stood on the steps, beneath the porch. Surrounded by a guard
  of Africans, it was fully a moment, before the mob recognized Decius Magius,
  the partisan, of Rome. Then a chorus of howls and curses rose up. Insults
  were hurled,&mdash;the grossest that the minds of a licentious rabble could
  suggest, fists were shaken, women spat toward the prisoner,&mdash;even a few
  stones were cast, and when one of these happened to strike an African of the
  guard, he turned quietly and cut down the nearest citizen. Then, with their
  heavy javelins so held as to be used either as spears or clubs, the soldiers
  descended into the Forum, and, with the captive in their midst, began their
  progress toward the street and gate that led to the Carthaginian camp. There
  was no weak delay in this progress, no requests for passage; the escort clove
  through the mass of the people, as a war galley dashes through the breakers
  of a turbulent sea. A spray of human beings that strove to escape but could
  not, boiled up about the prow; a wake of bodies, writhing or senseless, fell
  behind the stern, while, at either side, the stout javelins rose and fell
  like the strokes of oars, splashing up blood for foam.</p>

  <p>The taunts and threats that had assailed the prisoner died away amid
  shrieks of terror or pain and the deep rumble of the mob. Stupid with drink,
  drunk with the exultation of ungoverned power, they wondered vaguely, as they
  crushed back, why their new friends should strike, merely because
  they,&mdash;the Capuan people,&mdash;allies of Carthage, strove to punish a
  traitor and a common enemy. The prisoner's lips were seen moving, as his
  captors hurried him along; but no speech from them could be heard, until the
  Forum had been nearly traversed. Then, on the hush born of surprise and
  efforts to escape blows, the words of Magius were audible, at least to those
  nearest.</p>

  <p>He was protesting against this violation of the treaty. He was speaking of
  himself; a Capuan, than whom no one was of higher rank, being dragged in
  chains to the camp of an ally who had sworn that no Carthaginian should have
  power over a citizen of Capua. At the mention of his rank, malice and envy
  lent to some of the cowed rabble courage to jeer once more. Then he had
  asked, how they expected that an ally so careless of recently sworn
  obligations would respect his vow that no Capuan would be compelled to do
  military service against his will; whereupon, some of those who heard looked
  serious, for this seemed reasonable, and brought the possibility of evil
  unpleasantly home to them. Finally, he congratulated them upon this
  marvellous, new-found freedom which the Carthaginian alliance had brought,
  and which they had been celebrating so earnestly.</p>

  <p>Perolla and his companions had found themselves crushed against the
  portico of the temple of Hercules, in which, only the day before, had been
  established, also, the worship of the Tyrian Melkarth, out of compliment to
  the new alliance.</p>

  <p>At first they had realized but little of what was going on before and
  around them. They had listened vacantly to crazy rumours of how the statue of
  Jupiter in the Senate House had bowed to Hannibal as he entered, and how the
  Senate had forthwith saluted him as a god and declared him the patron and
  protector of the city; and, again, to other rumours even more wild of how the
  wives of all the Capuans had been decreed to be given to the Carthaginians,
  in return for which the women of Rome were to be surrendered to the Capuans
  by their victorious allies.</p>

  <p>When Decius Magius was led out in custody of the soldiers, Perolla was
  trying to think whether, after all, he would not prefer Marcia to Cluvia.
  Then followed the passage through the crowded Forum, straight toward the exit
  beside the temple of Hercules, and Perolla found himself within a spear's
  length of his captive friend, whose words of protest and warning fell upon
  his ears like molten lead, and whose reproachful eyes gazed into his own,
  piercing through them to his brain and dissipating the fumes of intoxication
  as sunlight melts the fog. Decius had not spoken to him, for he was mindful
  that such speech might bring suspicion upon the younger man, but his look had
  said all that his tongue refrained from saying, and Perolla realized his
  degradation and his shame.</p>

  <p>He started forward and cried out:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I was mad, my father; <i>mad</i>! do you hear? It was because I knew
  suddenly that I loved her, and that she would never love me! and then I
  rushed out and met others who were drinking, and we feasted and drank until I
  knew nothing. Pardon! pardon!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly he became conscious that Decius and his guards were gone. Had he
  heard his plea? Surely yes, for did not he, Perolla, now hear his friend's
  eyes saying to him that he was but a fool who had added to folly, philosophy,
  and to both, weakness, and to all, madness? He looked around at his
  companions. Some were gaping at him vacantly, some were laughing. Cluvia
  tried to grasp his arm, and he shook her off and saw her stumble and roll
  down the steps that led up to the portico; then a new commotion arose in the
  direction of the Senate House, and the attention of the bystanders was
  diverted. More Carthaginian soldiers were forming and marching through the
  mob that now opened to give passage of double width; and, as the escort came
  nearer, Perolla saw Hannibal, clad in the gown of a Capuan senator, moving
  calmly in their midst.</p>

  <p>A new frenzy came to his brain to take the place of the fumes of wine:
  perhaps it was one compounded of that and of shame and horror and revenge. He
  groped under his torn tunic and found his dagger; then, brandishing it, he
  burst down through the crowd, uttering incoherent words, and threw himself,
  like a wild beast, upon the guards.</p>

  <p>He had stabbed one through the throat and another in the shoulder, before
  he was beaten down by a blow from the staff of a javelin. A moment later, the
  first soldier to recover from the surprise of the incident bent over him with
  drawn sword.</p>

  <p>A sharp exclamation from behind checked the descending thrust, and the
  soldier turned quickly. Hannibal stood beside him, with a thoughtful smile
  upon his lips.</p>

  <p>"Would you kill a citizen of Capua? a man of our allies?" he said
  quietly.</p>

  <p>The African looked around stupidly. That he should not crush the Italian
  vermin forthwith was beyond his comprehension, but evidently such was not the
  schalischim's wish. Grumbling, he slipped his sword slowly back into its
  sheath, and, at that moment, several of the Capuan senators in Hannibal's
  train gathered round him with protestations and expressions of regret. The
  general looked at them and frowned.</p>

  <p>"I have been with you scarcely two days," he said, "and now you try to
  murder me."</p>

  <p>The senators fell upon their knees, kissing his gown and hands, in a
  frenzy of horror at the thought.</p>

  <p>"Who is this fellow?" asked Hannibal, turning Perolla over with his foot.
  Then, recognizing the son of Pacuvius Calavius, he went on: "Some one of no
  consequence, doubtless; dust of the street that stings when the wind drives
  it," and he glared around at the prostrate senators.</p>

  <p>They glanced at the senseless figure, as if hardly daring so much. Some
  knew him, more did not; but all united in protesting their ignorance.</p>

  <p>Hannibal viewed them with drooping lids, and the smile returned to his
  lips. Perolla stirred slightly.</p>

  <p>Again he addressed the Capuans, raising his voice somewhat, so that the
  crowd might hear.</p>

  <p>"What is your law for the punishment of such a crime?"</p>

  <p>Those who had not recognized the assassin, cried out, "Death." Others,
  divided between the more powerful enmity of Hannibal and the slower revenge
  of Calavius, made their lips move but were silent, hoping to escape notice in
  the shout of the others. A few of these were envious of the young man's
  father; more feared him.</p>

  <p>Hannibal noted their confusion and came to their relief.</p>

  <p>"But perhaps so wicked a man is not a Capuan, after all. It is difficult
  to believe that the gods would suffer such impiety to lurk in a city so
  beloved as yours; and, if no one knows him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A chorus of disclaimers snatched at the proffered evasion, and the smile
  on Hannibal's lips grew more subtle, as he said:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"In that case, the treaty does not stand, and you, my fathers, are
  relieved from the burden of his trial and punishment. I am still free to
  condemn an ally of Rome. Let your rods and axe do their office."</p>

  <p>The senators were standing now, and several of them winced and looked
  frightened at the swift result of their complaisance. One, even, gathered
  courage to say:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"When is it my lord's will that punishment fall?"</p>

  <p>Hannibal eyed him closely for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Here, in your forum, and now," he said, "provided you would give prompt
  warning to such vermin."</p>

  <p>The Capuan shifted uneasily and looked down. Several of the soldiers had
  already lifted Perolla to his feet, and, holding him upright, had torn away
  what remained of his garments; others sent for the executioners, and, in a
  moment, these appeared with the instruments of their calling.</p>

  <p>It was doubtful whether the prisoner had recovered full consciousness when
  the first rod fell upon his shoulders, but he groaned and writhed slightly in
  the grasp of the four soldiers who held him extended upon the pavement.</p>

  <p>Then Hannibal turned away, ordering one of his officers to remain and see
  the end. He signed to the Capuans to follow him.</p>

  <p>"Such jackals, my fathers, are not worthy that men of rank and wealth
  should watch them die," he said lightly. "The rabble will provide him with
  sufficient audience."</p>

  <p>And the senators, with awed and thoughtful faces, followed in the train of
  the captain-general of Carthage.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap208"
     name="chap208">VIII. &mdash; DIPLOMACY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">PACUVIUS CALAVIUS sat in the atrium of his house. Black
  robed from head to foot, with hair and beard untrimmed and uncombed, and face
  and hands foul with dirt, he rocked to and fro and groaned. From time to time
  he ran his fingers through beard and hair, and uttered the measured cry of
  the Greek mourners.</p>

  <p>An hour before, one of the senators had stolen furtively in, and, having
  hurriedly related the grewsome scene just enacted in the Forum, had sneaked
  out again as if he were a spy passing through hostile lines. None other of
  the friends of the afflicted father had ventured to bear or send a message of
  condolence. It was as if the house of the once acknowledged leader had been
  marked for the pestilence&mdash;and no pestilence was more to be shunned than
  the deadly blight of broken power. Even the slaves shifted about in
  embarrassed silence, offered little service, and obeyed as if conscious that
  obedience was something of an indiscretion, and was liable at any moment to
  become a crime. Some had slipped away to their quarters, and had begun to
  discuss the relative possibilities of freedom, wholesale execution, or a new
  master, when the coming blow should fall upon this one.</p>

  <p>To Marcia, on the other hand, had been born a feeling of sympathy for her
  host, that, for the present, overcame the contempt with which he had inspired
  her&mdash;a contempt scarcely lessened by the repulsive ostentation of his
  mourning. She alone ventured to minister to his wants and to beg him to
  partake of food and drink. Perhaps her attitude was due in a measure to the
  horror with which she herself had listened to the morning's news. To be sure,
  she had not admired the character of Perolla. It had in it too much of the
  weakness and puerility engendered by the bastard Greek culture fashionable in
  lower Italy, and which naturally attained its most offensive form in the
  towns of Italian origin. Still, he had been faithful to Rome, and there was
  something within that told her his madness and ruin were not entirely
  disconnected with her own personality. Word, too, had just been brought her
  that both Ligurius and Caipor had died of their injuries. They had seemed on
  the road to recovery when she visited them on the previous day, and this
  sudden misfortune filled her with new forebodings, mingled with a suspicion
  too horrible to dwell upon. As for Decius Magius, she had barely seen him,
  yet she had felt him to be one of all others upon whom she could
  rely&mdash;an Italian uncorrupted by Capuan luxury, a worthy descendant of
  the rugged Samnite stock, a Roman in all but name; and now he was snatched
  away, a prisoner in the hands of enemies who knew nothing of mercy. Still, he
  had approved of her design; had seen in it the possibility of success; and
  there was at least a consolation in the thought that, without friends or
  allies, no one but herself would now be cognizant of the fulfilment of her
  impending degradation.</p>

  <p>Another hour had passed; into Marcia's mind had come the calmness of a
  fixed resolve. Calavius still moaned and cried out his measured "Ai!
  ai!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly a tumult of noises sounded from the street: the approaching
  murmur of a multitude, the footsteps of men, shouts of applause, cries of
  wonder or warning, and sharp words of command.</p>

  <p>Ah! the end was near, now. Calavius began to imagine himself stretching
  out his neck to the sword, and he sought, by proclaiming his willingness and
  welcome, to stay the chilling of his blood, the trembling of his lips and
  hands.</p>

  <p>Staves were beating upon the outer door; the hum of voices in the street
  rose and fell and rose again.</p>

  <p>"Open the door, Phoenix," mumbled Calavius, as he rocked and swayed. "Open
  the door and let them enter. I am an old man. My son is dead. What matters a
  few years of life? I pray to the gods that the barbarians may not hack me.
  You shall see how easy I will make it&mdash;if they have but a sharp sword."
  Suddenly he sprang to his feet and grasped Marcia's arm. "They will not
  scourge me? Surely they will not scourge me? I am a senator and the friend of
  Carthage!&mdash;will the door hold? Hasten, my daughter; run and tell me
  whether they are guarding the street in the rear&mdash;before the tradesmen's
  gate."</p>

  <p>The beating upon the door still continued, with short intermissions, and
  Marcia surmised that the porter was probably skulking in the attic with his
  fellow-slaves. Calavius had turned suddenly from the depths of despair and
  the height of resignation to a keen desire for life. He had hurried away to
  seek for some unguarded exit, heedless, for the moment, of what even Marcia
  fully realized: the utter impossibility of a man so well known escaping
  unaided through a hostile city and without a friendly land whereto to turn
  his flight. He had left her standing in the court, to be a first prey of the
  assailants, whether Capuans or Carthaginians, and she reasoned that it would
  be better, or at least quicker, to unbar the door before it should be broken
  in: she was wondering, in fact, at the forbearance that had preserved it thus
  far from more violent assault. Calavius had been gone some time. Doubtless he
  had escaped or, recognizing the uselessness of his attempt, was hiding
  somewhere, and, in either event, nothing would be lost by judicious
  parleying.</p>

  <p>Arranging her robe, she walked slowly through the hall, slid back the
  bolts one by one, and let the door swing out into the street; then she stood,
  dazed and frightened, for the sight that met her eyes was Hannibal himself
  reclining in a litter borne by four Nubians. The curtains were thrown back,
  and he was leaning out, evidently giving some directions to the attendants
  whose summons had thus far failed to obtain an answer. Beside the litter
  stood the priest, Iddilcar, with folded arms and look bent upon the ground.
  Around them were ranged a strong guard of Africans, and, back through the
  streets, as far as she could see, the Capuan rabble were thronging forward,
  curious or bloodthirsty.</p>

  <p>All this was visible in a moment, and then the general, attracted by the
  creaking of the door and the exclamation of the crowd, looked up and saw
  Marcia standing upon the threshold.</p>

  <p>The litter was set down at an imperceptible signal, and he stepped out,
  robed in a loose gown of black, entirely without ornaments, and with hair and
  beard uncombed and sprinkled lightly with ashes. Marcia stared in wonder.
  Surely this could not be the Carthaginian method of announcing judgment or
  execution! She caught a flash of subtle lightning from the eyes of Iddilcar,
  though these had not seemed to neglect for a moment their close scrutiny of
  the pavement. Then Hannibal stood before her, bowing low and speaking in
  suppressed tones:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The gods be with you and dwell within this house! I have come to look
  upon the face of my father, and, if may be, to console him. Praise be to
  Tanis for the omen that you have opened to us, rather than one whose servile
  duty it was. So shall our entrance be free and our going joyful."</p>

  <p>He had cast a rapid glance around, as he spoke, and Marcia knew that he
  divined why the service of tending the door had been left to her&mdash;a free
  woman and a guest; yet he was pleased to ignore all inferences, and to
  attribute her act to some divine will. His words, too, were more than
  friendly, and, if they covered no snare of Punic faith, augured safety and
  continued favour.</p>

  <p>"I have come," he continued, "that I might mingle my tears with those of
  my father who mourns the death of a son."</p>

  <p>Marcia stood amazed. Had they not been told how this man had himself
  ordered the execution of Perolla? How, then, could even a Carthaginian show
  such effrontery! Still, it was necessary to think quickly, and her woman's
  wit told her that, in any event, Calavius' best chance of safety was to seem
  to accept the visit in the spirit which cloaked it. So thinking, she led the
  visitors into the peristyle,&mdash;Hannibal, Iddilcar, and some twenty
  soldiers who followed as if by previous orders; while the rest mounted guard
  before the vestibule. Murmuring some word of apology, she hurried back
  through the garden to the tradesmen's door.</p>

  <p>It was still closed and barred, facts which, together with the rumble of
  the crowd without, showed that Calavius' plan of escape had proven
  impracticable. Then she began a careful search, becoming more agitated, with
  each moment, about the difficulty of explaining the delay. At last she found
  him, hidden away under a couch in one of the slaves' apartments, so senseless
  with terror that several minutes passed, before he could grasp her tale of
  Hannibal's presence, and of the chance of safety it offered. When, however,
  he understood that there was yet room for diplomacy,&mdash;that the visitors
  were not mere executioners with orders to obey,&mdash;he drew himself out
  from his hiding-place, alert and active. The need of haste, in view of the
  time already lost, was apparent; but, nevertheless, he paused in the garden
  to wallow a moment in the mould and plunge his hands into its depth.</p>

  <p>Marcia saw with disgust, but she led on until they reached the peristyle;
  when, slipping aside into one of the cells, she watched the playing of the
  game.</p>

  <p>Calavius paused a moment at the entrance. Then, groaning deeply to attract
  attention, he shambled forward, and, throwing himself at full length before
  Hannibal, seized the hem of his robe and pressed it eagerly to his lips.</p>

  <p>"Ah, my master!" he cried. "Slay me, slay me at once or with tortures.
  Surely that man is not fit to live whose loins have engendered such a monster
  of wickedness. Only by death can I hope to expiate my offence and retain the
  favour of the gods."</p>

  <p>"Rise, my father," said the captain-general, and to Marcia's ears his
  voice rang true with sympathy. He reached out his hand to help Calavius. "Do
  you not see that I also wear mourning for this melancholy error?"</p>

  <p>"Never shall I rise or face you," cried Calavius, "until you give me your
  oath that I shall have your forgiveness before I die. Ah, the monster! the
  parricide! who would slay, at one stroke, both him who had brought him up to
  better deeds, and him who is indeed the father of his country. Ah, gods! the
  shame of it! Give orders, lord, quickly&mdash;only vow first that you forgive
  me."</p>

  <p>Hannibal's tones were low and deep with sorrow, and, by an imperceptible
  effort of what must have been prodigious strength, he raised the unwilling
  Calavius to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Listen, my father," he said. "Have they not told you how I knew not the
  young man? He was stained and dishevelled with revellings in honour of our
  alliance&mdash;in honour of me, unhappy one. Perchance the Lord Bacchus, whom
  you worship, willed to have him for his own, for surely it was he that raised
  the young man's hand against me. Ah! my father, did I not know how this son
  of thine was most beautiful, best, and bravest of the Capuan youth? Had I not
  marked him out for signal honour&mdash;only less than yours, my father and
  his? See, now, how the gods confuse the affairs of men. It was at the banquet
  that I learned his worth, and determined that he should love me and find in
  me a friend."</p>

  <p>"Truly yes," interrupted Calavius, "and you had won his heart, for,
  walking in the garden, he told me as much, only adding that he must appear to
  turn to you slowly&mdash;for the honour of his name among the partisans of
  Rome, whom may the gods confound as they have done."</p>

  <p>Hannibal smiled softly, as he took up the words:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"All this I knew well, being somewhat learned in men, my father; and now
  the gods have smitten my brother with madness that he should try to slay me,
  and myself with blindness that I should, unknowingly, order the death of one
  I loved most. Look, my father, I join you in your mourning, with black robes
  and ashes; I come to weep with you at the feet of Fate&mdash;you whose love
  for me has lost you a son, and to offer you myself to be a son in his
  place."</p>

  <p>Calavius embraced him, mumbling prayers and vows and endearments in the
  sudden joy of escaped death. Iddilcar raised his eyes from the study of the
  mosaics and turned aside, shaking as if with some strong emotion, and
  Hannibal spoke again.</p>

  <p>"One thing more, my father, I would speak to you of, though for my best
  interests I should hold my peace nor make dissensions among allies. There
  were those with me when this evil happened&mdash;men of your Capuan
  Senate&mdash;who knew this youth better than I, and who I am convinced
  suspected the truth; yet they spoke not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" cried Calavius, "and you have their names writ down for me? We shall
  slay them!"</p>

  <p>Hannibal's face wore an expression strangely inscrutable as he
  answered:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Yes, my father, I have their names whom I suspect; and they shall surely
  die. Grant it to me, though, that I alone keep them and expiate my own fault
  by avenging your wrong. This I swear by Baal-Melkarth and Baal-Moloch to
  accomplish at the season best for our plans. Therefore I tell you the fact,
  but without names, that you may know that you have enemies and walk warily,
  while I, your son, shall, under the gods, be your reliance for protection and
  revenge."</p>

  <p>Another thought seemed to be struggling for utterance in the bosom of
  Calavius&mdash;a wish prompted by religion but checked by prudence. Twice he
  raised his head as if to speak, and twice his eyes wandered. Then Hannibal
  spoke again, as if reading the other's thoughts:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I have also, my father, given orders that funeral honours be paid to my
  brother; a pyre rich with woven fabrics and wine and oil and spices, and,
  from my own share of the Etruscan spoils, I have chosen a vase boldly
  pictured with a combat of heroes."</p>

  <p>Tears gushed anew from the eyes of Calavius at this added evidence of
  thoughtful friendship, and once again he embraced his benefactor, but with
  somewhat more of dignity, now that the fear of death was removed.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Marcia became conscious of an intruding presence beside her, and,
  turning, her eyes fell upon the repulsive features of Iddilcar, that seemed
  to sneer through the semi-gloom. She shuddered and drew back against the
  wall. Iddilcar held out his arms which the broad sleeves of his robe left
  bare to elbow. An expression of eager lust made his face even more hideous
  than did the sneer of a moment past.</p>

  <p>"Come, little bird," he said, "and I will charm you. Moon of Tanis! Lamp
  of Proserpine! Essence of all the Heavens! do you not see I love
  you?&mdash;I, Iddilcar, priest of Melkarth. Behold, my robe is dark. It
  mourns&mdash;not for the fool who died, but because you have not loved me.
  Love, and it will gleam again in violet, and all the bracelets that hung from
  my arms at the banquet shall be yours."</p>

  <p>She pressed her hands to her face; she felt herself swaying upon her
  trembling knees; only the support of the wall saved her from sinking
  down.</p>

  <p>After a moment's silence he began again:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"What is an old man, and weak&mdash;a sport of foreigners&mdash;to me who
  am young and strong, and by whose word even the schalischim of Carthage must
  march or halt? I, the favoured one of Melkarth, beseech you, a Roman, for
  favour, because Adonis wills it. See how I come to you, unpermitted, from
  those who cajole each other, and I show you my heart. Love me! love me! leave
  this keeper, who is but an old woman, and you shall be a priestess in
  Carthage, and the people shall swarm around and cast their jewels and wealth
  before you, for the deity&mdash;that shall be you alone; and we shall feast
  and love and love and feast again in such splendour as not even Carthage has
  ever known&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She could restrain her feelings no longer; all her resolves seemed to slip
  from her in the presence of this man; she thrust out her hands and turned her
  head away with a shiver of utter disgust. Her movement was vague in the dim
  light, but he saw it, and his face darkened.</p>

  <p>"What is this house?" he exclaimed harshly. "How long will it stand
  against me? Shall I not crush its root, even as its branch was torn off to-
  day? Filth! vermin! dust! Shall not its flower lie in my bosom to bloom
  forever, if she wills&mdash;or to bloom for a moment and wither and be cast
  away, if she wills not?"</p>

  <p>He strode forward and caught her wrist; his hot breath steamed in her
  face.</p>

  <p>"No! no! I <i>hate</i> you! Go!" The words sprang from her lips, without
  power to hold them back, and she struggled frantically in his grasp; she
  heard his teeth grinding, as, mad with passion, he strove to bind her arms to
  her sides. At that moment a rattling of weapons from the peristyle seemed to
  bring him to a consciousness of his surroundings. Releasing her, he half
  turned, and she sank down in the corner of the cell. The visit was evidently
  over, and Hannibal, about to take his leave, was glancing around, evidently
  in search of the missing priest.</p>

  <p>Iddilcar spoke low and rapidly:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I will return at once. Wait me till I come, or I will have you given to a
  syntagma of Africans."</p>

  <p>He was out in the peristyle now, bowing low before the captain-general.
  Then he whispered in his ear&mdash;probably some explanation of his absence,
  of how he had been keeping watch against treachery; for Hannibal nodded
  several times, and, again embracing Calavius, accepted his escort to the
  door, giving his arm to steady the steps of the older man.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap209"
     name="chap209">IX. &mdash; THE BAIT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MARCIA crouched, huddled in the farthest corner of the cell,
  and listened to the receding footsteps of the visitors. Then she heard new
  sounds echoing through the house: the rushing feet of slaves descending from
  their quarters, striving to gain their stations unobserved; the sharp tongue
  of Calavius now loosed from the bonds of terror, and rating them soundly for
  their unfaithfulness and cowardice; the patter of excuses and protestations.
  In a few moments the quarters above resounded with the shrieks and groans of
  those condemned to the lash; for the wrath and indignation of Calavius,
  generally the mildest of masters, were spurred to vindictive bitterness by a
  consciousness of his late terror and abasement. "They were guilty of all
  crimes, and, worst of all, of the rankest ingratitude. Let them learn that
  their master was still strong enough to punish." So the scourges fell, and
  the victims screamed and writhed.</p>

  <p>All these things Marcia heard, but they meant little to a mind so full of
  internal conflict as was hers. What was she to believe of herself? Had she
  not marked out a course of self-devotion and sacrifice which was to gain
  respite and safety for her country, revenge upon its enemies? Had not others,
  notably Decius Magius, been forced unwillingly to admit the possible
  efficiency of her plan? Yet now, when the gods had shown her favour beyond
  all anticipation&mdash;had brought the chosen quarry into her net&mdash;she
  had thrown all aside and yielded to her womanly weakness, her instinct of
  modesty, her sense of personal repulsion. What right had she to think of
  herself as a woman! He, for whose love her sex had been dear to her, was
  gone&mdash;a pallid shade who could no longer be sensitive to her beauty, a
  vague being sent far hence into the land of the four rivers by these very men
  whom she had devoted to destruction. What though the virtues that had beaten
  down her resolves had been good once&mdash;good for Marcia the woman? They
  were evil for that Marcia who had resolved to be a heroine, and who was now
  learning how hard it is for the female to seek the latter crown without
  losing the former. Again and again she struggled with herself, swayed back
  and forth by the counter-currents of conflicting shames, until the thought
  of death, as a final possibility, revived to steel her purpose. The sacrifice
  and the shame would be short, and, in the consciousness of her work
  accomplished, she could die, going before the lady Proserpine with a pure
  heart that need not fear to meet the eyes of Sergius when they should ask its
  secret.</p>

  <p>Rising quickly, she hastened to her chamber by passages where she would
  not be likely to meet her host. Whatever intentions he might have entertained
  toward her had been effectually suspended, if not obliterated, by the course
  of events, and now he was much too busy setting in order his demoralized
  household to think of her presence. Therefore, she reached her apartment
  unnoticed, and, summoning her tirewomen, surrendered herself to the tedious
  process of adornment according to the accepted taste of Magna Graecia.</p>

  <p>The afternoon was spent, ere all had been finished. Then she ate hurriedly
  and with little appetite, drinking deeply of the Lesbian wine till her cheeks
  flushed through the rouge, and her eyes sparkled. Calavius had gone out, busy
  about affairs of state, and eager to collect the strained threads of his
  influence&mdash;threads that might be strengthened by their very straining,
  in the hands of a politician who realized how men were ready to grant every
  complaisance to one whom they had deserved ill of and whose vengeance they
  feared. Marcia found herself wondering whether Iddilcar would indeed return
  as he had said. Perhaps her attitude had seemed to him so unfavourable that
  he would strike first;&mdash; but when and how? Perhaps affairs of state
  detained him also. Perhaps, even, this man, Hannibal, whose eye pierced
  through all subterfuges, had already divined the danger and set himself to
  nullify it. Perhaps&mdash;and then, as she was reclining in the larger dining
  hall, one of the slaves entered and whispered in her ear. She rose
  quickly.</p>

  <p>"Tell my lord that she whom he favours awaits him at the hemicycle in the
  garden, and guide him to me."</p>

  <p>She spoke, marvelling at her steady tones, and, turning, walked, with
  drooping head, to the semicircular, marble seat;&mdash;not the single seat,
  back amongst the foliage, where she had met Perolla; "the philosopher's
  chair," as Calavius had called it laughingly, where his son retired to
  commune with thoughts too great for men. Sinking down at one end of the
  hemicycle, she studied the carved lion's head that ornamented the arm-rest,
  and the paw, thrusting out from the side-support, upon the pavement beneath.
  It troubled her that such wonderful handicraft had not considered that the
  head was entirely out of proportion with the paw; and yet, if the former were
  larger or the latter smaller, surely they would not fit well in the places
  they were intended to ornament. What a provoking dilemma, to be
  sure&mdash;and at such a time, for, glancing suddenly up, she saw Iddilcar's
  dark, repulsive features bent upon her with a terrible intentness. All her
  former loathing surged back over her heart with tenfold force, sickening her
  with its suffocating weight.</p>

  <p>"Light of the two eyes of Baal," he murmured softly. "Look kindly upon thy
  servant. Smile upon his love, that thy light and his worship may be eternal.
  Behold! for thee I cast aside the worship of the lord Melkarth!"</p>

  <p>He tore apart his long, violet tunic, showing his throat and bosom hung
  with necklaces. His arms, bare to the shoulders, glittered with heavy
  bracelets.</p>

  <p>"Lo! the spoils of Italy assigned to my Lord I give to thee,"; and, taking
  off necklace and bracelet, he knelt and piled them at her feet, raising and
  parting his arms in the attitude of oblation.</p>

  <p>Charmed as by a serpent, Marcia watched him with horrible disgust, yet
  unable to turn her eyes aside.</p>

  <p>"What is Tanis to thee!" he went on. "What, Ceres! What, Proserpine!
  Ashera! Derceto!&mdash; goddesses afar from men&mdash;goddesses whom, not
  seeing, we worship faintly with sacrifice and ceremony. But thou&mdash;thou
  shalt dwell forever in the temple upon the Square of Melkarth. Come!"</p>

  <p>Again, and in spite of every resolve, Marcia felt the overmastering sense
  of woman's loathing that stood so obstinately between herself and the rle
  she had marked out. It was too much. She could not&mdash;could not suffer
  this man for a moment, even with the release of swiftly hastening death
  before her eyes. She struggled to her feet, groping about, turning, and, with
  a stifled scream, she sought to fly; but her strength refused her even this
  service.</p>

  <p>In an instant, he was up and beside her; his hand had roughly grasped her
  shoulder, half tearing away the cyclas; his little eyes blazed with
  vindictive fury; his nostrils dilated; his coarse lips writhed in hungry
  passion.</p>

  <p>"Ah, slave! You would escape? Where? where? In this house? Ah, fool! Could
  you not measure the comedy of this morning? Do you think this old imbecile,
  this man condemned to follow his mouse-killing son, can protect you from the
  meanest Nubian in the army? Do you think&mdash;ah!" and he raised his hand,
  as if to strike.</p>

  <p>Wrenching herself loose by a quick movement, Marcia turned and faced him
  with all the blood of the Torquati flushing in her cheeks, all their fire
  blazing in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Dog of a pulse-eater!" she cried, and he shrank back before the vehemence
  of her tone. "Do I care what you do? Break your alliance with these people if
  you wish&mdash;an alliance of fools with fools, knaves with knaves! Break it,
  before it be cloven asunder for you by the sword of Rome. Doubtless your
  chief will sacrifice all his plans to your cowardly lust. Kill my protector,
  tear down his house, and&mdash;kill me!&mdash;me, for whom there is neither
  sowing nor reaping in this matter."</p>

  <p>All his arrogance and violence had vanished, cowed and crushed by her
  outbreak; but, even as he cringed before her, the gleam of Oriental cunning
  had taken its place.</p>

  <p>"Ah! now, indeed, art thou more beautiful than the lady Tanis," he
  muttered, clasping and unclasping his hands, as if in ecstasy. "Now, indeed,
  do I love thee." His voice sank to a whisper, and he glanced about
  timorously. "And so it is neither sowing nor reaping with you, my pretty?" he
  went on. "Fools we may be, but not the fools to be blind to your
  sowing&mdash;not the fools who shall not root up your seed before the day of
  reaping. Did not you, a Roman, counsel Mago to delay? Did you not, foolish
  one, even give such counsel at the banquet of welcome to the schalischim,
  until I laughed in my cup to see a silly girl who would cajole men of
  government and of war?"</p>

  <p>Marcia stood, rigid and pale. All her plans seemed shivering about her.
  She was doomed to fail then&mdash;fail after all, through the cunning of
  these vermin. Still she struggled to retain her composure.</p>

  <p>"Liar!" she said. "Do I not know that if you spoke truth I would already
  be buried under hurdles weighted with stones?"</p>

  <p>He laughed softly. "Why?" he asked. "What can you avail, coining lead for
  us who perceive its falseness? Nay, you are even of use to Hannibal, for, by
  your very eagerness, he has come to Maharbal's thinking, that all must be
  done speedily, if we would take Rome. Even now Capuans work night and day
  building our engines. Soon they will set them up before your gates. We shall
  winter in Rome, as the guests of the lady Marcia who has invited us.
  Therefore Hannibal grants you life and to be a comfort to his friend and
  father, Pacuvius Calavius, in his declining years;" and he laughed again, but
  harshly and sneeringly.</p>

  <p>Marcia could scarcely keep her feet under the crushing force of these
  blows. In what vain manner had she, an inexperienced girl, blind to all but a
  noble purpose, contended with men whose cunning had sufficed to snare the
  chiefs of her people! Worse even, she had herself forged the weapons for the
  destruction of all she had hoped to save. Iddilcar watched her from under
  half-closed lids, noting every line of her face, and reading its struggle and
  its despair.</p>

  <p>"And so it is wisdom for us to march north at once?" he said softly.</p>

  <p>"How do I know?&mdash;a woman?"</p>

  <p>He smiled subtly and ignored the change of front he had wrested from
  her.</p>

  <p>"Love me, and I swear by the crown of Melkarth that Hannibal shall winter
  in Capua."</p>

  <p>She started, as if from the touch of fire. Had her ears heard words of
  his, or was it only a belated thought coursing from her brain to her
  heart?</p>

  <p>He stepped nearer and spoke again:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Love me, pretty one, and Hannibal shall winter in Capua,&mdash;yea,
  though he hangs on the cross for it,&mdash;though all the armies of Carthage
  become food for dogs."</p>

  <p>At first she had been dreaming of new snares; but these last words and the
  vehemence of his tone brought her to an intuitive realization that this man
  was indeed prepared to give up god, country, general, friends,&mdash;all, so
  only that he might gratify his overmastering passion. The gods were indeed
  with her, after all,&mdash;were guiding her aright; and the knowledge
  steadied her self-control and strengthened her resolve. What omen of favour
  could be more potent than this snatching of victory out of the very hands of
  ruin&mdash;this moulding of ruin into a source of victory?</p>

  <p>So she spoke, calmly and evenly:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you tell the truth, perhaps folly. How shall I know, any more
  than I know of this power to command commanders, of which you make such silly
  boast?"</p>

  <p>"Not I&mdash;-not I, lady," he protested eagerly. "Listen! It is the lord
  Melkarth that has always loved the colonies of Phoenicia, first among which
  is Carthage. It is he that has guided and guarded us through the perils of
  the deep and of the desert, of the skies and of the earth, of hunger and
  thirst, of beasts and men. What god equals him in our city! What god receives
  such gifts, such incense, such sacrifices! What though we fear Baal Moloch!
  Is it not the lord Melkarth whom we love? It is he who goes before our
  armies, that he may tell them when to attack, when to await the foe. I am his
  priest. Do you understand? I have spoken his words many times. Now he shall
  speak mine."</p>

  <p>Marcia could hardly fail to understand the nature of the power which this
  man now proposed to lay at her feet; yet it all seemed horribly impossible
  that he, a priest, could dare such sacrilege for such end. Had she been
  Fabius, Paullus, or even Sergius,&mdash; men who were already groping amid
  the Greek schools of doubt, and were coming to regard the religion of the
  state more as an invaluable means of curbing the vices of the low and
  ignorant than as a divine light for the learned,&mdash;had she been such as
  these, this proposal of Iddilcar would have seemed incredible only on account
  of its treason to his country. And yet, in one sense, she was better fitted
  than they to understand the Carthaginian. True scepticism had found little
  room under the mantle of the gloomy, the terrible cult that swayed the
  destinies of the Chanaanitish races. Even the priests, while they were ready
  enough to use the people's faith to minister to their own ends, trembled
  before their savage gods. Low, brutish, full of inconsistent wiles their
  faith might be, but such faith it was as an educated Roman could with
  difficulty comprehend. On the other hand, the minds of the women of Rome had
  not as yet swerved from unquestioning belief in the gods consulting and the
  gods apart, and the Torquati were most conservative among all the great
  houses. From childhood up&mdash;and in years she was scarcely more than a
  child&mdash;all these had been very real to her. Pomona wandered through
  every orchard beside her beloved Vertumnus; Pan and his sylvan brood sported
  behind the foliage of every copse. She would as soon have thought of
  questioning their presence as of doubting her own being. Marcia believed; the
  average Roman patrician affected to believe and indulged in his polite,
  Hellenic doubts; the Carthaginian priest, while he believed, with all
  Marcia's fervour, in a theology to which Marcia's was tender as the divine
  fellowship of the Phaeacians, yet conceived that it was entirely legitimate
  to play tricks upon his fiend-gods&mdash; to pit his cunning against theirs.
  If they caught him, perhaps they would laugh, perhaps consume him in the
  flames of their wrath. It depended on their mood&mdash;whether they had dined
  well, perhaps; and he would take his chances. He stood, now, toward his
  deities, just where the heroes of Homer had stood centuries before. He was a
  living evidence of the Asiatic birth of Greek theology&mdash;only, in the
  Asian races, religious feeling was not religious thought, did not arise from
  the mind or change, like the cults of Europe, as the mind that evolved or
  adopted them developed and outgrew its offspring.</p>

  <p>So it was that, while Marcia, but for her instinctive realization of the
  truth, might have been utterly unable to credit the sincerity of such
  prodigious wickedness, yet, armed with this intuition as a starting-point,
  she sought for and found reasons to support it. The purity of her own faith
  came to her aid. Perhaps the Punic gods were mere demons, as they seemed to
  be, and Iddilcar knew it and relied for protection upon the mightier gods of
  Rome. In a sense, she reasoned on false premises, but her conclusion was,
  none the less, more accurate than would have been that of either Paullus or
  Sergius. For the time, at least, Iddilcar was entirely sincere. To be sure,
  if he could gain his end by mere promises, he preferred to deceive Marcia
  rather than Melkarth, but his plotting had not gotten so far as that yet.
  Now, his fierce, Oriental nature was consuming with that passion which, in
  it, took the place of all love. This Roman woman had aroused desires that he
  had never known in the gardens of Ashera; her face was to the faces of the
  courtesans who thronged the sacred woods on feast days, as the glory of the
  crescent moon was to the sputter of the rancid oil in the lamp that illumined
  the cell of Fancula Cluvia. Cunning beyond his race, learned in the strange
  learning of the East that had come to a few in Egypt and to fewer yet in
  Phoenicia, Iddilcar read the struggle that was taking place in the girl's
  mind.</p>

  <p>"What do I care for Hannibal!" he cried; "for the Great Council! for
  Carthage! I would give them all to you for one kiss. To him who has learned
  all secret knowledge, the mind alone is God and city and home and
  friends,&mdash;everything, everything save love," and his voice, harsh, and
  strident, sank to a whisper in which was compassed all the fierceness of
  ungoverned and ungovernable desire.</p>

  <p>Marcia knew, now, that he was speaking the truth; that he would indeed
  stop at nothing; and, with the certainty, there came to her a strange
  mingling of exultation, terror, and calm. She saw this man, powerful with the
  power of the conqueror, learned with the learning of the student and of the
  ascetic, grovelling here at her feet&mdash;slave to a force against which no
  power, no philosophy could avail. She saw him crawl to her and press her robe
  to his lips; she heard him mumbling and whining like some animal, and she
  despised him and grew stronger in the light of her growing self-esteem. At
  last she spoke.</p>

  <p>"It is well. I have listened and determined. Yes, you are right. I have
  wished that the army should not march north; I have wished that it should
  winter in Campania. I am a Roman; why should I not wish it? You say you can
  accomplish this. Do so, and you shall have your reward."</p>

  <p>Iddilcar sprang to his feet and threw out his arms to draw her to him; the
  breath came from his chest in short gasps; his eyes were suffused with tears
  through which he saw something glitter; and his hands, clutching and
  unclutching, caught only air. Then his arms fell to his sides; he paused and
  looked stupidly at her. She had sprung back and was facing him defiantly with
  a short dagger raised to strike.</p>

  <p>"Not so soon, slave," she said, and her voice rang in his ears like steel.
  "He who would reap must first sow."</p>

  <p>"You do not love me," he said sheepishly, gnashing his teeth because he
  knew the foolishness of his words, and yet could say no others.</p>

  <p>She laughed; then her face grew sober.</p>

  <p>"No," she said; "I do not love you. Why should I? We love those who serve
  us well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah! but I have promised," he broke in. "I am giving you everything."</p>

  <p>"I want but one thing," she said, while the lines of her mouth hardened;
  "and, for that, I take no promise."</p>

  <p>He lowered his head to avoid the straight flash of her eyes.</p>

  <p>"It is I, then, who must trust&mdash;always I," he muttered. "How do I
  know you will give yourself when I earn you?&mdash;how do I know you will not
  kill yourself with that dagger? for you hate me," and then, with sudden
  fierceness; "why should I not take my own? What hinders me?"</p>

  <p>"This," said Marcia, touching the point with her finger.</p>

  <p>Iddilcar shuddered.</p>

  <p>"Listen now," she began, "and be reasonable. I have named my price, and
  you have said it is not too much. Why speak of love or hate? Earn me and take
  me."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he echoed; for he was braver when his eyes studied the pavement;
  "why speak of love or hate? It is you I want&mdash;your kisses, your
  embraces. Who shall say that hatred may not flavour them better even than
  love?" and he sneered. "Ah! but how shall I know?"</p>

  <p>"I am a Roman, and I have promised. Fulfil your Punic word as well, and I
  swear you shall have your pay, so surely,"&mdash;and then the memory of
  another day, happier, but oh! so bitterly regretted, came to her
  mind,&mdash;"so surely as Orcus sends not the dead back from Acheron. Now
  go."</p>

  <p>He drew back, step by step, still facing her, longing to rebel, yet not
  daring, cringing, skulking like a whipped cur. He reached the end of the
  path; the entrance to the garden was behind him. He raised his clenched hand
  to the heavens. "Ah, Melkarth!" burst from his lips, and, turning, he plunged
  into the house, running.</p>

  <p>Marcia listened eagerly to the fall of his sandals. They died away, and
  the distant door creaked. Tears filled her eyes, and, shivering in every
  muscle, she sank down upon the seat and buried her face in her hands.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap210"
     name="chap210">X. &mdash; MELKARTH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">TWO moons had waxed and waned; Pacuvius Calavius had dined
  in his winter triclinium for the first time this year, and Marcia was
  rejoicing at the omen. She watched her host, as he lay back upon his couch,
  and noted with pity the change that had come over him. When he had greeted
  her coming, he had seemed not very much past middle age&mdash;a brisk man,
  well preserved in mind and body. Now he was old&mdash;very old&mdash;and the
  pallor and wrinkles were prominent through the flush of the wine and the
  paint with which he strove to hide them. Even his ambition was dead; he
  hardly sought the Senate House, but, stopping within doors, maundered
  querulously and unceasingly to Marcia, to his servants, to any one who would
  listen to him, of the blunders that were being made, and of how war and
  negotiations should be conducted, speaking always as a man for whom such
  things had no personal interest. The diadem of Italy that had once blinded
  his eyes to good faith and oaths of alliance, had melted away in the flames
  of the pyre that consumed his son. As for Marcia, she had come to regard him
  with something of that indulgent consideration which we feel for the aged and
  infirm. His former attitude toward herself, which had filled her with
  contempt and disgust, had vanished utterly, and, in its place, was a fatherly
  kindness that had now no nearer object upon which to lavish itself. As for
  the household, what little discipline had once pertained, was gone. The
  slaves were no longer punished, and, slavelike, they presumed upon their
  master's gentleness or indifference. They pilfered right and left; they
  neglected duties and orders; until, at last, a large measure of the care of
  her host and his house devolved upon Marcia alone; and Marcia, also, had
  softened and grown kindlier, and was as slow to ask for punishments as was
  Calavius to decree them. They seemed like two who were awaiting death, and
  would not add to the measure of human misery, knowing, from their own, how
  great this was.</p>

  <p>"Let them enjoy a false freedom for a few days longer," said Calavius.
  "Soon we shall be gone, and then&mdash;who knows? I have no heirs, and the
  state may not deal so kindly with them." Strangely enough, he seemed always
  to assume Marcia's coming death along with his own; and when she gazed into
  her mirror, its story moulded well with that reflected in the mirror of her
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>She had grown thin&mdash;very thin&mdash;and pale, and her eyes burned,
  large and luminous, as with the fires of fever. Her lips, too, were redder
  even than when the blood had tinted them with hues of more perfect
  vigour.</p>

  <p>Hannibal had continued to preserve the attitude of respectful
  consideration which had marked his demeanour on that day of which they never
  spoke. He still greeted Calavius as, "father," when he came to ask about his
  health, and on the days when he did not come, he sent some Carthaginian of
  rank, generally Iddilcar, to make courteous inquiries in his stead.</p>

  <p>Calavius, on the other hand, complained continuously of the schalischim's
  delay, and Hannibal listened with downcast face, frowning to himself, and
  made no answer except that he was the servant of the gods. Marcia's presence
  he entirely ignored. Still, he spent little of his time in Capua, and of this
  Calavius was now speaking.</p>

  <p>"Truly did you note the news we have received to-day, my daughter? Two of
  the new engines destroyed before Casilinum!&mdash;Casilinum,
  forsooth!&mdash;a paltry village, against which the Capuan children would
  hardly deign to march! It is Rome&mdash;Rome&mdash;Rome that calls&mdash;and
  this great general, this conqueror, sits down before Nuceria, Acerrae, Nola,
  Casilinum. Soon, mark me," and his eyes gleamed prophetic, "Rome will sit
  down before Capua: and then, receive thou me, O Death, who art my friend and
  well-wisher!"</p>

  <p>Marcia wondered at this vehemence, so different from his manner through
  all these weeks.</p>

  <p>"But the omens, my father," she said, after a moment's pause. "I have
  heard that the gods of Carthage forbid the march north. Perhaps they fear to
  contend with the gods of Rome at the foot of their own hills."</p>

  <p>"Tush! girl," exclaimed Calavius, impatiently. "Who does not know that the
  gods say such words as their thievish priests filch from them. Mark now this
  fellow that comes from the captain-general. Do you not see how the fingers of
  his left hand clutch and unclutch? Were Hannibal to crucify him and a few
  like, his gods might utter more favouring responses. Meanwhile, our engines
  that should thunder at your Capenian Gate are consumed before mud heaps; and
  who knows but all the time some tree grows stouter that it may bear the
  weight of this Hannibal, the slave of gods that should be taught their place
  and their duties."</p>

  <p>Marcia, despite her complicity, listened, shuddering, to these
  sacrilegious words; and, mingled with her shrinking from a philosophy that
  dared to talk of the immortals as mere means to be used or cast aside as
  human ends might dictate, was a terror lest similar reasoning should at last
  find place in Hannibal's mind and thus bring to naught her aims and her
  sacrifices. It was easy to see how the general chafed at the unwonted delay,
  and with what willingness he listened when another spoke the words which he
  himself dared not utter.</p>

  <p>Calavius had but just finished his tirade when they both turned at a
  slight noise and saw Iddilcar standing in the entrance of the room. How long
  he had been there&mdash; what he had heard, neither knew, but his face wore
  the subtle smile which, though well-nigh native to its lines, yet seemed
  always to bear some hidden import.</p>

  <p>"The favour of Melkarth and of the Baalim be with you!" he said softly.
  "Your servants, my Pacuvius, are not over-well trained. There was no offer to
  bear word of my coming&mdash;no offer of attendance. The porter hardly
  deigned to swing the door for me."</p>

  <p>Marcia, knowing Iddilcar as she did, was prompt to take this speech in the
  light of an explanation of his eavesdropping; but the once sharp intelligence
  of Calavius had been too much deadened to search for secondary meanings.</p>

  <p>"I am an old man, priest," he said querulously. "Why should I leave
  stripes and crying behind me?"</p>

  <p>Iddilcar shrugged his shoulders. "That may be," he replied, "but if we had
  such servants as yours in Carthage we should send their shades ahead of
  us."</p>

  <p>He had indeed deftly parried any attack or inquiry. Then, suddenly, and of
  his own accord, he turned back to strike.</p>

  <p>"And so you have been condemning the piety of the schalischim? the
  integrity of the college of priests? the truth of the gods themselves, for
  aught I know? Have a care!"&mdash;he was lashing himself into a fury&mdash;"I
  have listened to your words. If I reported them, how long before you would
  both be sent to Carthage to keep comradeship with that terrible fellow,
  Decius Magius? Have care! have care lest the gods strike through me, their
  servant. Nevertheless the gods are merciful to those who bring
  offerings&mdash; peace-offerings of gold and jewels and raiment and spices.
  Come, what will you give me that I smother their wrath&mdash;I, Iddilcar,
  your friend, whom you speak ill of behind his back&mdash; whom you
  hate&mdash;-yes, both of you;" and his eyes flashed at Marcia with a strange
  recklessness that she had never seen in them.</p>

  <p>Wondering and terrified, she listened to his outburst of rage, but
  Calavius heard it calmly, and answered, without troubling himself to probe
  its import.</p>

  <p>"You shall have a talent of silver and such jewels as you choose," he
  said, rising. "I will go and give the orders."</p>

  <p>"Orders!" sneered the other; but to Marcia it seemed that the word and
  look covered suspicion at the ready acquiescence of the Capuan.</p>

  <p>"Then I will go with you and see that these orders are obeyed. Come;
  ah!&mdash;" and he turned to Marcia; "and will you be here when I return? I
  wish to speak with you."</p>

  <p>She inclined her head, still wondering, and when they had left the room
  her wonder deepened. Surely a change had taken place. A Carthaginian was
  always said to love money, but for Iddilcar to seek to obtain it by such
  crude and violent means, from a man whom his general professed to honour and
  protect, seemed to augur something of which she knew not. Either Hannibal's
  protection was to be, for some reason, withdrawn, or else?&mdash; but what
  else could embolden the priest to such license? The look, too, with which he
  had regarded herself! She had restrained him with some difficulty during the
  past months, but now she felt instinctively that her control had vanished.
  Even violence seemed near; for that Iddilcar could be fool enough to dream
  that his mere repetition of the words he had listened to, would enrage
  Hannibal, she did not for a moment believe. The general had heard the same
  from Calavius, face to face, and had only frowned and bit his lips behind his
  beard, as if feeling their justice. What, then, could have happened?</p>

  <p>"Ah! you are still here."</p>

  <p>She looked up quickly, and saw that the priest had returned alone. He went
  on, speaking quickly and nervously, but in low tones:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The time has come. And so you were thinking, thinking of what? Was it
  rejoicing that Tanis was to give you to me so soon?" and he showed his teeth,
  like a dog. "Listen: they suspect me. I have done all as you wished, but
  there was a council to-day in the camp before Casilinum, and Maharbal fell on
  his knees, as he did after Cannae, and begged to march north,&mdash;not with
  the cavalry alone, as then; he knew it was too late for that: and the
  schalischim knit his brows and frowned. Then Hasdrubal and Karthalo added
  their prayers and pleadings, gathering around him, and then he turned his
  sombre face to me, and asked if it was permitted; but, before I could answer,
  for my mind was disturbed, that animal whom they call, 'The Fighter' had
  drawn his sword and held it over my head, crying out: 'Yes, friends, it is
  permitted&mdash;see! It is permitted;' and then I felt myself grow pale, and
  I heard the great beast laugh. A moment later and Hannibal had ordered him to
  put up his sword, and I saw Maharbal whispering quick words in the general's
  ear, among which it seemed to me that his lips formed your name. Again,
  Hannibal asked: 'Is it permitted, Iddilcar? or what sacrifice will your lord
  have from us? Have we not served him faithfully? Is there aught he wishes?'
  and I felt all their eyes on me; but, above all, were yours that were soon to
  smile. Therefore I took courage, which the lord Melkarth granted, and spoke
  boldly, explaining that I had as yet been able to win no favour, though I had
  prayed long and fasted and lashed myself with thongs, whereupon Hannibal-
  the-Fighter made as if to tear off my mantle, laughing in his beard; and when
  I saw they did not believe me, my terror came back. Then it was that Melkarth
  shed wisdom upon his servant, and, after a moment's thought, I spoke up,
  thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Listen, lords,'I said; 'I am a native Carthaginian, like you all, and I
  reverence the gods. Howbeit it may chance that here, beyond the sea, it is
  not so easy to win their favour, so that they shall go before us. New and
  strange sacrifices and pleadings wherein I am untaught may be needed to
  pierce the denser ether of this land. Truly, lords, as ye have not failed in
  piety, neither have I erred in divination, for Melkarth has spoken many
  times, telling me of the unnumbered woes that would overwhelm the army if it
  marched upon Rome unbidden, and he hath spoken truth, and I have saved you to
  revile me for it&mdash;only I would learn if there be yet speech better
  fitted to his ear.' I paused, and they were silent, wondering. Then I spoke
  on: 'Grant me, lords, three days, that I may journey to Cumae; for I have
  heard that a woman dwells there, wise in the ways of the gods, and, if I bear
  her rich presents, it may happen that she will teach me the words that shall
  pierce this dull air, even to where Baal-Melkarth sits enthroned in Mappalia,
  that he may grant all your wishes.' So I crossed my arms upon my breast, and,
  bowing my head, listened. 'At Cumae?' growled Jubellius Taurea, who sat near
  me, 'say, rather, at the house of Pacuvius Calavius,' and I felt myself
  trembling, for then I knew surely that I had heard Maharbal aright, and that
  I was suspected. Still, I stood fast, and at last Hannibal spoke: 'Go to
  Cumae for three days,' he said sternly. 'Take what you wish&mdash; one
  talent, two, three; only bring back the words that shall win favour;' and
  Hasdrubal added: 'And harken! lord; if you win not favour, we shall yet
  march, and peradventure you shall come with us&mdash;if they drive not the
  nails too deep;'but there was an outcry at this, for they trembled lest
  Melkarth should smite them, and Hasdrubal spoke again, grumbling: 'Ah,
  masters, you have not seen soldiers as I have seen them, becoming bloated
  with wine and food, and soft in the arms of courtesans;'but Hannibal
  interrupted him, crying out to me again: 'Go!&mdash;go! There is little time
  for the march, and it may be we are already too late. Go and do all things so
  that the lord, Baal-Melkarth, shall favour us.' So I went out, and, having
  taken their talents, I am here. This old sheep has disgorged another talent
  together with gems. Therefore come now and we shall escape hence."</p>

  <p>Marcia saw a dimness before her, amid which his jewels and bracelets and
  earrings seemed to mingle strange glancings with the fires that burned in his
  eyes. At last she faltered:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"But your work?&mdash;it is not finished. How shall I know?&mdash;if I go
  with you?&mdash; "</p>

  <p>The rings on his hand were sinking deep into her wrist; his lips were
  close to her ear.</p>

  <p>"Ah! you will not go? You will play with me&mdash;deceive me? Listen now.
  To-morrow I shall be here with horses and money&mdash;in the
  morning&mdash;very early&mdash;before light; and you will go like a little
  bird that is tamed. These days will give us time to gain more, if more be
  needed. Look! I have hazarded all. Shall I lose my reward now because my work
  be unfinished by ever so little? It may be that, having gone, I shall not
  return. Do you think I will leave you here to laugh at me? You will go, or,
  to-morrow, Baal-Melkarth shall speak the word, and, before midday, Hannibal
  shall give orders to march to Rome. Why do you think I have gathered this
  wealth? Look! I have risked all for it, and you shall not escape."</p>

  <p>Exhausted by his rapid vehemence, he stood back, breathing hard and trying
  to smile.</p>

  <p>"Ah! moon of Tanis, you will come," he murmured, holding out his arms. "We
  shall escape to Sicily&mdash;to Greece&mdash;to Egypt&mdash;to the far East.
  We shall be rich with the spoils of fools&mdash; "</p>

  <p>A slight scraping noise came to their ears, and both started. Iddilcar
  sprang swiftly to the entrance of the room, but the lamp in the hall had gone
  out, and his eyes saw nothing in the darkness. Uncertain what to do, he
  looked back to where Marcia stood, pale and rigid. His voice and hands
  trembled as he repeated in a loud whisper:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You will come? You will be ready?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, "I will come;" but she did not look at him, as she spoke,
  only she caught the triumphant gleam of his eyes; a thousand weird lights
  seemed to whirl around her, and she felt herself sinking. It seemed, for a
  moment, as if a slave in a gray tunic was supporting her, and then all
  consciousness fled.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap211"
     name="chap211">XI. &mdash; THE SLAVE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was an hour past midnight, when Marcia first knew the
  agony of returning reason. The gong in the Forum had just struck. Where was
  she? Surely in her own apartment! How had she come there? Then, slowly, the
  memory of yesterday grew clear&mdash;the awful duty of to-morrow. With
  eyelids fast shut, as if dreading to open them to the darkness, she buried
  her throbbing temples beneath the rich Campanian coverlid. She could still
  see the eyes of Iddilcar gleaming wolfish amid his jewels; could see him
  standing in the doorway, as he turned from that startled rush in pursuit of
  what had been, doubtless, only a whisper of their imaginations. He had said
  he would come for her&mdash;before daybreak&mdash;and she must be ready.
  Later, she could approach death with suppliant hands, but now she must be
  ready. Her life was not her own yet. It was her country's. Later, the shade
  of Lucius would beckon. Surely he would forgive her for having avenged him.
  But how had she reached her room? Had it been Calavius or the slaves who had
  found her? did they suspect? Then she remembered the man who had seemed to
  catch her as she fell. Where could Iddilcar have been then? Had he hurried
  away? probably enough. Again a slight scratching noise, as of some one softly
  changing his position,&mdash;like the sound which had startled the priest,
  came to her ears. Ah, protecting gods! what was true, and what but dreams?
  Her whole life was passing before her, phantasmagorial and unreal. Surely
  some one was present! She <i>felt</i>it. Had Iddilcar come already? The
  horror of the thought gave her courage, and, thrusting down the coverlid, she
  opened her eyes defiantly and tried to pierce the darkness. Nothing was
  visible, but she knew she was not alone, and, leaning upon one elbow, she
  reached out, groping.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a hand grasped hers, a strong, bony hand, gripping it tightly,
  and by its very energy commanding silence. It seemed strange to her that she
  did not scream, but then she had known that she would find some one, and had
  the hand been Iddilcar's, she would certainly have realized it by the
  loathing in her soul. For her, now, all other men had become friends.
  Therefore she was not frightened, did not cry out&mdash;rather it was a
  soothing sense of companionship that came to her&mdash;almost of reliance.
  Why had this man come?&mdash;perhaps to help her; surely not to injure. Who
  was he? man or god? Gods had appeared to those of olden times, when the
  Republic was young, and Romans worshipped, believing. She felt very
  brave&mdash;fearless.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"I am a slave," answered a voice. "I brought you here, and I am
  watching."</p>

  <p>It was a voice that, while it rang hard, yet had in it an assurance of
  protection&mdash;even of power, and it thrilled her as with some familiar
  memory. Nevertheless she could not place its owner in the household. Calavius
  had many slaves; a few of them had been free-born, and some, perhaps, might
  even have known a measure of social standing, before the turn of war or of
  financial fortunes had lost them to home and position.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" she asked again.</p>

  <p>"I am a new servant," said the other. "Pacuvius Calavius bought me
  yesterday in the Street of the Whitened Feet."</p>

  <p>She was silent a moment, trying hard to think; she felt the man's hand
  trembling, and then, suddenly realizing, she drew her own away.</p>

  <p>"And yet you are going to-morrow with this beast&mdash;this animal!" said
  the voice, bitterly.</p>

  <p>Startled again by the tone and accent, no less than by the words, she
  burst out:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Ah! why do you say that?&mdash;but you do not know, and I cannot tell
  you. Yes, you are right. I am going away to-morrow. I am&mdash;a courtesan.
  What then?"</p>

  <p>"By the gods! no!" he cried, and she heard him spring to his feet. Then,
  lowering his voice, "If I thought <i>that</i>, I would kill you."</p>

  <p>"You would only forestall my own blow," she said quietly, and there was
  new silence.</p>

  <p>At last he spoke again.</p>

  <p>"Tell me all of this matter. You are safe. I am a Roman."</p>

  <p>"A Roman&mdash;and a slave?"</p>

  <p>"And a slave. Tell me the truth quickly."</p>

  <p>The voice sounded weak and hollow now, but still strangely familiar. She
  began her story, speaking in a low monotone.</p>

  <p>"I am Marcia, daughter of Titus Manlius Torquatus. I loved, and yet I
  drove my lover from me, and he was killed on the black day of Cannae. Then
  the Senate feared lest the enemy should advance to Rome&mdash;prayed for the
  winter&mdash;for time. And I was beautiful, and I had no love, save for the
  king, Orcus. So the thought came to me that by my blandishments I might win
  power with these people, and, by power, delay, and, by delay, safety for
  Rome&mdash; and revenge for my lord, Lucius. Therefore I journeyed to Capua.
  You see that I have played my part&mdash;that I have won? Tomorrow I go to
  pay the price. What matters it? Then I can die."</p>

  <p>He had listened in silence; only she heard his breath coming hard, and, a
  moment after she had finished, he spoke:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;you cannot die&mdash;not thus. <i>I</i> have died&mdash;once,
  yet I live. Listen! I, like the lover you tell of, was slain at Cannae,
  pierced through by javelins, and I lay with the dead heaped above
  me&mdash;ah! so many hours&mdash;days, perhaps&mdash;I do not know; until the
  slave-dealers, passing among the corpses, found me breathing, and wondered at
  my strength, auguring a good value. Therefore they took me, and when I was
  well of my wounds they brought me here&mdash;to Capua, and sold me to
  Pacuvius Calavius&mdash;to whom may the gods give the death of a traitor! Lo!
  now, let it be for a warning that Orcus does indeed send back the dead from
  Acheron."</p>

  <p>He leaned forward, as he spoke the words, and there came to Marcia a
  sudden memory of two occasions when she had used the ancient saying&mdash;the
  colloquial "never" of Rome. Once it had bound her to Iddilcar, and once, far
  back, in happier times, it had parted her forever from Sergius. Tears rolled
  down her cheeks. A dim light seemed to be creeping into the room&mdash;very
  dim, but as her eyes grew dry again, she could begin to trace the outlines of
  her companion sitting on a low stool beside her couch. Surely those were
  footsteps in the hall&mdash;yes, footsteps&mdash;and the approaching light of
  a lamp.</p>

  <p>Marcia's heart stood still. The slave had started from his seat and drawn
  far back in the darkest corner of the room; then the curtains were pushed
  cautiously aside, and the tall form of Iddilcar stood revealed by the light
  of the small, silver lamp he bore in his hand. A long, dark mantle enveloped
  him from head to foot.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, speaking sharply but in low tones; and, holding the lamp
  above his head, he tried to peer into the apartment. "Come; it will soon be
  light. Ah! you have not arisen? No matter; I have another cloak, and we must
  not delay. The slaves are well bribed, and Calavius sleeps
  soundly&mdash;forever. My horses, good horses, are in the street; a few
  moments and we gain the gate. The schalischim's own ring is on my finger, and
  the seal of the Great Council shall win us egress. <i>You</i> are my slave:
  that is how you shall go with me&mdash;and I accept the omen."</p>

  <p>He laughed low and harshly, and Marcia shuddered, thinking of her host
  lying slain&mdash;by his false slaves?&mdash;by the order of
  Hannibal?&mdash;no, rather by the hand or plotting of this wretch who now
  called her, "slave."</p>

  <p>"Come, come quickly, Romanus," he said, mimicking the Latin nomenclature
  of foreign slaves. At the same time he took a step forward into the room and
  let the curtains fall behind him. "Come, or I shall have to order the rods to
  those white shoulders. That would be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And then a shadow seemed to glide forward from the corner half behind him.
  For a moment a stream of lamplight fell upon a white, set face behind the
  Carthaginian's shoulder&mdash;a face that was indeed from the land of the
  four rivers; an arm was lashed around the priest's neck, and, while Marcia
  stared spellbound at the shade that had come back to save her, the lamp fell
  from Iddilcar's hand,&mdash;and then she lay still and listened to the
  furious struggle that ensued, the scuffling of feet upon the marble floor,
  the breathing that came and went in short, quick gasps. Now it seemed that
  both fell together; but not in victory or defeat, for the noises told of
  continuing combat; no words, only the horrible sound of writhing and of
  hard-drawn breath.</p>

  <p>Breaking at last from the bonds of dazed wonder, she glided from the
  couch, groping for the fallen lamp. She must <i>see</i>. She must
  <i>know</i>. Then she remembered the room-lamp that stood on a stand by the
  bed, and began to feel her way toward it. The grating of metal against metal
  came to her ears, followed by a low exclamation and a sharp "Ah!" gasped
  exultantly; then came the sound of two fierce blows.</p>

  <p>She had found the lamp now, and was trying to strike a light. The victory
  was still undecided, though the combatants seemed to groan with each breath
  they drew. At last the wick caught the spark, and the mellow light and the
  odour of perfumed oil began slowly to fill the room. A statuette or vase came
  crashing to the floor, and, raising the lamp high above her head, she threw
  its light upon the struggling men. For a moment she could make out nothing
  except a dark mass at her feet. Then she caught the glitter of a weapon, and
  at last her eyes grasped something of the situation.</p>

  <p>Iddilcar was undermost. She could see his black, curling beard that seemed
  matted and ragged now, while the Roman&mdash;the man who bore the face of the
  dead Sergius&mdash; was extended upon him, grasping, with both hands, the
  Carthaginian's wrists. It was the latter who held the blade that had
  glittered&mdash;a long Numidian dagger, but the hold upon his wrists
  prevented his using it, and the Roman dared not release either hand to wrench
  it away. There were bruises, too, on Iddilcar's face&mdash;the blows of
  fists; but the blood on the floor told of some other wound, doubtless the
  Roman's, inflicted before he could restrain the hand that dealt it. Now,
  neither seemed able to accomplish further injury, until the strength of one
  should fail; and if it was her protector's blood that was flowing?&mdash;the
  thought was ominous. Neither dared to cry out, for the aid that might come
  was too doubtful, and, besides, they needed to husband all the air their
  lungs could gain.</p>

  <p>Marcia saw these things and thought them clearly, quickly, and in order.
  Her mind seemed to grow as strangely calm as if busied in selecting some
  shade of wool for her distaff. She reached down and, by a quick movement,
  twisted the dagger from the stiffened, weary fingers of the Carthaginian. A
  cry burst from him&mdash;the first since the triumphant "Ah!" that had
  doubtless come from his lips when he used the weapon, a few moments since. He
  writhed furiously, and Marcia stood, holding the dagger in her hand,
  hesitating rather through dread of injuring this new Sergius that had arisen
  to aid her.</p>

  <p>The Roman, however, seeing himself freed from the necessity of guarding
  against the sharp point that had menaced him, now suddenly released the
  wrists of his adversary, and, grasping him by the throat, he lifted his head
  several times, and struck it violently against the pavement. The Carthaginian
  groaned, and his hold relaxed for a moment. Then, tearing himself free, and
  with one hand still gripping the throat of the prostrate man, the Roman
  raised his body, and, turning toward Marcia, reached out for the dagger. With
  eyes fixed wonderingly on his, she gave it to him, as if only half conscious
  of her act.</p>

  <p>Again the scene changed. Less helpless than he had seemed, and with
  staring eyes, before which death danced, Iddilcar gathered all his remaining
  strength for one last, despairing effort, wrenched himself loose, and
  staggered to his feet.</p>

  <p>Then Marcia saw Sergius, for she knew now it was indeed he, saw him throw
  himself forward on his knees, and, catching Iddilcar about the hips, plunge
  the blade into his side.</p>

  <p>The priest shrieked once, as he felt the point, and struggled furiously to
  escape, raining blows upon the other's head and shoulders. Again the long
  dagger rose and fell, piercing the man's entrails. Gods! would he never
  fall?&mdash;and still he maintained his footing, but now his hands beat only
  the air, and his struggles became agonized writhings. Sergius' grip about his
  hips had never loosened, and the dagger rose and fell a third time. Iddilcar
  groaned long and deeply and sank down in a heap, carrying his slayer with
  him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap212"
     name="chap212">XII. &mdash; FLIGHT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SLOWLY Sergius disengaged himself from the death grip that
  entangled him, and, rising, turned to where Marcia stood. Still holding the
  lighted lamp above her head and peering forward, she gazed into his eyes with
  a look wherein wonder and terror were mingled with awakening joy.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" she faltered at last; "you who come as a slave, bearing the
  face of a shade?"</p>

  <p>"I <i>am</i> a shade," he answered; "one sent back by Orcus&mdash;by the
  hand of Mercury, to save a Roman woman from dishonour."</p>

  <p>"Oh, my lord Lucius!" she cried, falling upon her knees and holding out
  her hands toward him. "Truly it was not dishonour to avenge you, to save the
  Republic; but if it were, then may your manes pity and forgive me. There,
  now, is the dagger. Take it and use it, so that I, too, may be your companion
  when you return to the land that owns you. I love you, Lucius; the laughter
  of the old days has passed. Surely a woman who is about to die may say to the
  dead words which a girl might not say to her lover for the shame of them. I
  love you&mdash;I love you. Take me before the maiden, Proserpine, that she
  may show us favour&mdash;to your land&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The lamp fell from her hand; she felt herself raised suddenly from the
  pavement, and strained hard against a bosom that rose and fell with all the
  pulsations of life and love. Frightened, wondering, she struggled faintly,
  while kisses warm and human fell upon her brow, her eyes, her lips.</p>

  <p>"Marcia, little bird, dearest, purest, best," murmured a voice close to
  her ear; "yes, you shall go with me to my land, and that land is Rome."</p>

  <p>Still she trembled in his arms, not daring to believe.</p>

  <p>"Wait," he said. Then, releasing her for a moment, he regained the fallen
  lamp, relighted it and placed it in its niche, facing her again with arms
  outspread.</p>

  <p>"Look well; am I not indeed Lucius Sergius&mdash;once pierced and worn
  with wounds, but now well and strong to fight or love? The tale I told you
  was true. It was my tale&mdash;the saving of one Roman from the slaughter of
  her legions."</p>

  <p>She drew closer and looked again into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, and in her voice the joy began to sweep away all other
  feelings; "yes, you are indeed Lucius Sergius Fidenas&mdash;man, not
  shade&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But, taking her hand, he interrupted:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Do you not remember the omen, my Marcia? how you said you would love me
  when Orcus should send back the dead from Acheron? how I accepted it? how the
  gods have brought all about, as was most to their honour and my
  joy?&mdash;for now you have indeed said that you love me."</p>

  <p>She placed her free hand upon his shoulder saying:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"And that which I, Marcia, daughter of Titus Manlius Torquatus, have said
  unto the shade, that say I to the living Lucius Sergius. Take me, love; for
  where thou art Caius, there shall I be Caia."</p>

  <p>Once again he took her in his arms and kissed her upon the lips, long and
  tenderly. Then she drew herself back.</p>

  <p>"You are wounded?" she said anxiously. "Forgive me that I forgot. Truly I
  forget all things, now&mdash;in this wonder and joy."</p>

  <p>Sergius laughed.</p>

  <p>"He pricked me&mdash;in the thigh, I think, but not deeply. The gods have
  brought me so close to the shades that I am enough akin to them not to heed
  little hurts."</p>

  <p>But she had seized the lamp and was examining his injury&mdash;a flesh
  wound that, while it had bled freely, yet seemed to have avoided the larger
  muscles and blood-vessels.</p>

  <p>"Did I not tell you?" he said reassuringly, as she rose from her knee. "A
  close bandage so that it will not bleed&mdash;that is all we shall want, for
  my strength must remain with me yet a little while, if we would truly go to
  Rome and not to the realms of the dead."</p>

  <p>She said nothing, but, tearing strips from her stole, proceeded deftly to
  bind them around the leg.</p>

  <p>"Agathocles himself could not do better&mdash;nay, I doubt
  Aesculapius&mdash;" but she rose again quickly and placed her finger upon his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"It is the gods who have saved us to each other. Do not make them angry,
  lest they withdraw their favour. I am ready to follow you, my lord
  Lucius."</p>

  <p>Standing erect, he raised both hands in invocation.</p>

  <p>"A shrine to Venus the Preserver!&mdash;to Apollo the Healer!"</p>

  <p>Then, stooping quickly, he drew the long, dark robe of Iddilcar from where
  it lay entangled about the legs of the corpse. Fortunately it had slipped
  down from the Carthaginian's shoulders early in the struggle; perhaps he had
  tried to free himself from it; perhaps it had been partly torn away; but, in
  either event, it had fallen where it must have hampered his movements even
  more seriously, and where it was less stained with his blood than might have
  been expected.</p>

  <p>Sergius threw it over his own tattered, blood-stained garments, striving
  to hide the rents, and raising it high about his neck so as to conceal his
  face as much as possible. Meanwhile, Marcia, having bound on her sandals, had
  of her own accord donned the mantle Iddilcar had brought for her, and which
  had fallen by the door of the apartment. Then, gathering up her long, thick
  hair, she confined it close above her head, drawing down upon it the hat that
  lay beside the cloak&mdash;a broad-brimmed Greek petasus, admirably adapted
  for concealment as well as protection.</p>

  <p>"I am ready," she said eagerly. "Let us make haste."</p>

  <p>Sergius was stooping over the dead man, searching for something.</p>

  <p>"It is the ring," he said; "the ring with the seal of the Great Council of
  which he spoke. How else should we pass the guard at the gate?"</p>

  <p>A moment later he rose, and, going to the light, examined carefully the
  several rings taken from the priest's-fingers.</p>

  <p>One by one they dropped and rolled away over the floor. The last only
  remained, and Marcia, looking over his shoulder, saw a heavy, gold signet
  bearing the device of a horse under a palm tree.</p>

  <p>"Come now," he said, taking her hand. He had thrust the long knife of
  Iddilcar into the girdle of his tunic, and this was their only weapon. So,
  leading Marcia, he quickly traversed the halls and courts and gained the
  door, which hung ajar and unattended. Outside, a company of five men were
  gathered, all mounted. Two were apparently soldiers, a sort of guard; the
  rest were servants. Heavy looking packages were bound, behind them, on their
  horses' backs, doubtless the money which Iddilcar had gotten, while two extra
  animals, saddled and bridled, were held in waiting.</p>

  <p>The heart of Sergius leaped as he noted the fine, small heads and slender,
  muscular legs that marked the Asian stock of their mounts. Iddilcar had
  provided well for all emergencies; but Sergius felt some anxiety lest a
  chance glimpse of his face might lead to detection. The sky in the east was
  already beginning to lighten, and there were more men of the escort than he
  had anticipated. Speech would be fatal; therefore he strode quickly out, took
  the bridle of one of the horses from the man who held it, and swung himself
  upon its back. To assist Marcia could not be done without exciting suspicion,
  and he ground his teeth when she tried to follow his example, and one of the
  servants laughed and pushed her roughly into the saddle. Then they rode on,
  and the others followed, whispering together.</p>

  <p>He had muffled his face a trifle too closely, perhaps, and he had mounted
  the horse standing, whereas all knew that the Cappadocians were trained to
  kneel at the word. Therefore the men of the escort wondered, though they
  hardly ventured to suspect.</p>

  <p>Marcia felt, rather than noted, their attitude, and Sergius, glancing
  toward her, saw that she was trembling. He urged his horse faster toward the
  gate that opened upon the Appian Way; boldness and speed were all that could
  save them. Suddenly the gate loomed up, gray and massive, in the mist of the
  early morning. Several soldiers lounged forward from the guardhouse, whence
  came the rattle of dice and the shrill laughter of a woman. Sergius showed
  his ring and said nothing, while Marcia came close to him, shivering, for the
  morning air was chill and biting. Their followers had drawn rein, and were
  gathered in a little clump several spear-lengths behind.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the soldiers, Spaniards they seemed, were gazing stupidly at the
  device on the seal and making irrelevant comments. It was evident that their
  night had been spent among the wineskins, and that a new danger menaced.</p>

  <p>Summoning what Punic he knew, Sergius leaned forward and asked in a low
  but stern voice to see their officer. Fortunately his own followers were too
  far away to hear his words, and drunken Iberians would not be critical as to
  a faulty Punic accent.</p>

  <p>Still they hesitated, chattered together, and stared, but at last one who
  seemed more sober than the rest reeled away to the guard-house, and, after
  some delay and evident persuasion, emerged again with a young officer whose
  moist, hanging lips and filmy eyes showed that he, too, had been dragged from
  the pursuit of pleasure. Helmetless and with loosened corselet, every detail
  of his appearance told the story of relaxed discipline.</p>

  <p>"What do you want? at this hour?" he said thickly, ambling forward and
  leaning heavily upon the shoulder of his scarcely more steady guide.</p>

  <p>Again Sergius held out the ring, and the man, being a native Carthaginian,
  recognized it through the mist of his intoxication, and, throwing himself at
  full length, touched the earth with his forehead.</p>

  <p>"What do you wish?" he said, rising and standing, somewhat sobered by the
  presence of such authority.</p>

  <p>"Open the gate. I ride under orders of the schalischim," said the Roman,
  again speaking low and rapidly.</p>

  <p>The officer turned and shouted to his men, and several ran to unbar the
  gate with such speed as their condition warranted. The other occupants of the
  guard-house were now grouped at the door, five men, half armed, and two
  dishevelled women with painted faces and flower-embroidered pallas.</p>

  <p>The gate swung slowly on its hinges.</p>

  <p>"The light of the Baals be with you, friend!" exclaimed Sergius, and he
  and Marcia rode through, with hearts beating madly. Voices raised in
  discussion made them turn in their saddles. In his drunken stupidity, the
  Carthaginian officer was trying to detain their escort and servants. "The
  master had said nothing about them. How did he know they belonged to the same
  party?" Then all began gesticulating and shouting to Sergius for help and
  explanation.</p>

  <p>Here was an unforeseen incident, and the mind of the young Roman viewed it
  rapidly in all its lights. On the one side, he would be relieved of an
  awkward following that might at any moment begin to suspect him; on the other
  hand to leave these in the lurch would be to invite prompt suspicion. Still,
  they were fifty yards or more in advance, their horses were good, and more
  space would be gained before the tangle at the gate could be straightened
  out; therefore he waved his arm, as if making some signal, and, turning again
  in his saddle, rode on, but without increasing his speed.</p>

  <p>Louder shouts followed him, for, as he had intended, his gesture had
  proved unintelligible. Then, when they saw he did not stop, the cries ceased
  suddenly and an animated chattering came to his ears. Here was suspicion
  trying to make itself understood and, at last, succeeding, for, as Sergius
  glanced back once more to note how the matter progressed, the young captain
  of the gate sprang forward and shouted for him to halt.</p>

  <p>"A third altar&mdash;to Mercury the hastener!" exclaimed Sergius. "Quick
  now! with the knees!" and, pressing the flanks of his Cappadocian, both
  animals bounded forward into a headlong gallop.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap213"
     name="chap213">XIII. &mdash; WINTER QUARTERS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE beat of hoofs upon the great blocks of basalt rang
  through the morning air in measured cadence, and soon an answering echo came
  up from the south. Open flight had at last dispelled all doubt and given the
  signal for pursuit.</p>

  <p>First came the two Africans of the original escort, released and bidden to
  ride for life or death; a short distance behind was the Carthaginian captain
  on his own horse which had probably been haltered behind the guard-house;
  and, last of all, three of the Spanish guard, who had thrown the servants and
  baggage from the animals that bore them, and appropriated such speed as these
  afforded for the business in hand.</p>

  <p>That the officer was pretty well sobered seemed apparent. A fugitive
  bearing the ring of the schalischim&mdash;the seal of the Great
  Council&mdash;must be a man of importance, or else the possession of such a
  talisman augured the commission of some terrible crime. Already he saw
  himself stretched writhing upon the cross; the crowd, reviling or gibing,
  seemed surging about his feet; and his howls of anguish found voice in a
  storm of guttural objurgations to men and horses, mingled with prayers and
  vows to the gods of Carthage.</p>

  <p>He had overtaken the two Africans now, for his animal was better than
  theirs, but the three others laboured hopelessly behind: the Cappadocians
  flew rather than galloped far in advance. Already nearly three hundred yards
  separated them from their pursuers, and the gap was widening slowly but
  surely. Only the officer held his own, for he was now forging ahead of the
  Africans.</p>

  <p>"Ah, cowards! slime! filth!" he shouted to his struggling men. "The cross!
  the cross! that for you unless we catch them! that for me!&mdash;for all! Ah,
  Eschmoun! Ah, Khamon!&mdash; Melkarth!&mdash;gifts!&mdash;gold, gems, robes,
  spices!&mdash;my first-born to the Baals! to the Baals! Help! speed!"</p>

  <p>The man was mad&mdash;mad indeed with terror and newly dispelled
  drunkenness; and his horse, a great African, coal-black save for one white
  hoof, seemed to partake of his master's frenzy. With ears lying flat along
  his head, and eyes that burned into those of Sergius, when he ventured to
  glance behind him,&mdash;glaring sheer through distance and dust like the
  very eyes of those demons his rider invoked,&mdash;the beast thundered on,
  equalling the speed of the light Asiatic chargers by the force of strength
  alone.</p>

  <p>From time to time the fugitives turned their heads to measure the
  distance, and the sight of this unwearied pursuer appeared to fascinate them
  as by some weird power. The rest were beaten out,&mdash;the Spaniards lost to
  sight, the Africans visible only by the dust that hung over them far
  behind.</p>

  <p>The mountains to the eastward seemed to be dancing away in a mad chase
  toward the south, a chase which Tifata itself was urging on. The glimmer of
  white in the north told of the morning sun striking upon houses. Still they
  rode on, pursuers and pursued.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a sound, half-trumpet note, half bellow, swelled up ahead. Then
  another answered it, and another and another took up the refrain.</p>

  <p>Sergius' face blanched, and, with a sudden effort, he threw his animal
  almost upon its haunches. Marcia was carried several spear-lengths farther
  before she could check her speed. Wonder and the dread of some accident drove
  the blood to her heart. A hoarse shout of triumph came from their pursuer, as
  she turned to ride back.</p>

  <p>She asked no questions. Surely Sergius knew what was best. She saw
  Iddilcar's long dagger in his hand, and that he was about to fight.</p>

  <p>"Back!&mdash;back! and to one side," he called, as she rode up. "Did you
  not hear the elephants? That is Casilinum, and they are besieging it. We
  should have remembered."</p>

  <p>He darted forward to meet the Carthaginian, fearful that he, too, would
  draw rein and await the coming of his followers. Then indeed all would be
  lost. Six soldiers on the one side and a camp full on the other were hopeless
  odds against a wounded man armed only with a Numidian dagger.</p>

  <p>But it was Bacchus that fought for Rome that day&mdash;Bacchus, to whom no
  altar had been vowed. A night of debauchery and the sudden terror of its
  awakening had effectually blurred whatever judgment the officer may have had,
  and his one thought was to kill or capture his quarry.</p>

  <p>So they came together, Sergius swerving his Cappadocian as they met. The
  officer struck blindly, but the good lord Bacchus put out his hand and turned
  the blow aside. Then, as they parted, a strange thing happened. Marcia had
  wondered dimly why Sergius struggled with the long, girdleless garment of
  Iddilcar, tearing it off as he rode. Now, when the two horses sprang apart,
  she saw that he had thrown it dexterously over the Carthaginian, blinding his
  blow and tangling him in its heavy folds.</p>

  <p>Prompt to respond to knee and rein, the Cappadocian wheeled, almost as
  soon as he ran clear, but the African thundered on, while its rider cursed in
  blind terror and tried to check his horse and to free his face and sword-arm.
  A moment, and he had succeeded, but he succeeded too late. The Roman was at
  his back, and Marcia saw the long dagger rise and fall in a swift thrust. She
  could not see how the point took its victim just at the nape; but she saw him
  pitch forward like an ox under the axe.</p>

  <p>Almost before she could grasp what had happened, Sergius was beside the
  fallen man, had resumed the priest's tunic, red with new blood stains, and
  was on his horse again. His brow lay in deep lines as he rode toward her.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said. "The gods favouring us, we must pass their camp before
  the rest come up. Grant that those may linger by the corpse, and that we meet
  no check."</p>

  <p>Again they were galloping toward the lines that lay about Casilinum. All
  had happened so quickly that even now they could scarcely see the plume in
  the distant dust cloud that told where the pursuers straggled on. They had
  turned into the new side-road without meeting a man. Then a small foraging
  party halted them, and Sergius showed the seal and spoke in Gallic to its
  Numidian leader. A little farther on was stationed another band, and here the
  delay was longer ere his halting Punic convinced the Spanish piquet, and they
  again rode forward unsuspected. All had bowed low to the horse and the palm
  tree, and no one dared question what weighty mission urged on the man in the
  torn and blood-stained tunic and the slender youth, his companion.</p>

  <p>Now they were back again upon the pavement of the Appian; the last line
  was passed, and the beleaguered town with its stout-hearted garrison lay well
  behind. Perhaps that sudden uproar told of the arrival of their pursuers;
  perhaps those glittering points amid distant dust clouds meant a new pursuit.
  Surely none but Mercury had winged the feet of the Cappadocians! Unwearied,
  like springs of steel, the stout muscles drove them on&mdash;on over the
  marshland with the glint of the sea before them&mdash;on, up the rising
  ground.</p>

  <p>Again and again Sergius turned in his saddle scanning the road behind,
  feeling the presence of pursuers whom he could not see. The good horses were
  weakening fast. No flesh and blood could stand that strain, and naught but
  the spirit of the breed kept them afoot. Marcia's was limping painfully; the
  one Sergius rode was wavering in its stride, like the Carthaginian captain
  when he came out of the guard-house by the gate.</p>

  <p>"Gods! What were those shrill sounds&mdash;half whistle, half scream?"</p>

  <p>Too well he remembered how the Numidians urged on their bridleless
  chargers. Yes, there they were now&mdash;scarce half a milestone behind and
  coming up like the wind that blew through their dishevelled manes&mdash;fifty
  at least. Death, then, was decreed, after all, and he glanced toward Marcia,
  measuring the time when he might kiss her and kill her ere he sold his own
  life to the javelins.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he heard her cry out.</p>

  <p>"Look!" she called, and, following her finger, he gazed eagerly ahead.</p>

  <p>A clump of horsemen, heavy armed with helmet and corselet, crowned the
  knoll of rising ground over which the road led, and, above them, fluttering
  in the breeze, he saw the square vexillum of the cavalry of the legion.</p>

  <p>He was among them now, lifting Marcia from her horse and dimly conscious
  of many words being spoken around.</p>

  <p>"See, lord, they have halted," said a voice. "Is it your will that we
  pursue?"</p>

  <p>Then, as an answering voice replied in the negative, he kissed Marcia and
  made her drink wine that some one brought. Barbarous cries that she must not
  hear or understand came to his ears, and he knew that their pursuers were
  wheeling in discomfited flight. The circle of soldiers stood back. Something
  cold and feathery fell upon his upturned face and turned to moisture. He saw
  a tall man with features of wonderful beauty regarding them kindly and in
  silence; his white paludamentum was heavily fringed with purple, and Sergius
  recognized him now,&mdash;Marcus Marcellus, the new dictator. Another drop,
  feathery, cold, and moist, fell upon Marcia's hand, and she roused herself at
  the touch, peering up into her lover's face and then quickly at the
  heavens.</p>

  <p>"Look!" she cried. "Up! not into my eyes."</p>

  <p>He turned, for an instant, to see the blue vault of a few moments since
  overcast with gray and filled with a swirl of snowy flakes.</p>

  <p>"See, now, Lucius, lord of my life; here are the messengers of winter.
  Winter quarters! he is in winter quarters! See! have we not prevailed?"</p>

  <p>It was the voice of the dictator that answered:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Yes, truly; and there shall soon be prepared for him eternal summer
  quarters in Phlegethon&mdash;if the Greek tales be true."</p>
