<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The following pages contain the results of the author's
travels and residence in the western parts of Australia, between
the years 1837 and 1840, during which period he traversed
extensive regions unknown to the European traveller, and probably
never before trodden by the foot of civilized man.</p>

<p>It is not alone with gratification of enlightened curiosity
that the countries now first brought to notice are likely to be
objects of interest. A knowledge of the districts lying between
Swan River and Shark Bay cannot but be of importance to future
colonists, whilst the intertropical provinces of the north-west
coasts, distinguished as they are by important peculiarities both
of character and position, are equally calculated to draw the
attention of the literary and enterprising enquirer.</p>

<p>It only remains to state in a few words the circumstances
under which this work is given to the public.</p>

<p>The author arrived in England in September, 1840, and was
engaged in preparing his notes for publication when he was
unexpectedly honoured with an appointment which re-called him to
Australia in the month of December following.</p>

<p>Avocations both of a public and private nature arising out of
that appointment prevented him from carrying his work through the
press during the short period of his residence in this country,
and consequently the final arrangement of the impression and the
duties of typographical revision devolved on others.</p>

<p>Although no pains have been spared to render these volumes
worthy of the public eye, the circumstances under which they
appear will naturally occasion them to be marked by defects
which, doubtless, would not have escaped the author's notice and
correction had he been present.</p>

<p>It would be an act of injustice not to express here the
obligations the author is under to Mr. J.E. Gray of the British
Museum for his valuable assistance in whatever relates to natural
history in the body of the work, as well as for the contributions
in the same branch of science which will be found in the
Appendix; nor are his thanks less due to Mr. Adam White for an
interesting paper on the Entomology of Australia; and to Mr.
Gould, who has lately visited that country, for his list of the
Birds of the Western Coast.</p>

<h1>JOURNALS OF EXPEDITIONS OF DISCOVERY.</h1>

<p><a name="chapter1"></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER 1. COMMENCEMENT OF THE EXPEDITION. TENERIFE.</h2>

<p>GENERAL PLAN AND OBJECTS.</p>

<p>The Expeditions of which the results are narrated in the
following pages took their origin from a proposition made to
Government by myself, in conjunction with Lieutenant Lushington,*
in the latter part of the year 1836.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Now Captain Lushington of the 9th
Foot.)</blockquote>

<p>At that time a large portion of the western coast and interior
of the great Australian continent had remained unvisited and
unknown; whilst the opinions of the celebrated navigators
Captains Dampier and King, connected with other circumstances,
led to the inference, or at least the hope, that a great river,
or water inlet, might be found to open out at some point on its
western or north-western side; which had then been only partially
surveyed from seaward.</p>

<p>DESIGN OF THE EXPEDITION.</p>

<p>Anxious to solve this interesting geographical problem, we
addressed a letter to Lord Glenelg, the Secretary of State for
the Colonies, wherein we offered our services to conduct an
exploration from the Swan River to the northward, having regard
to the direction of the coast, so as to intersect any
considerable body of water connecting it with the interior; and,
in the event of such being discovered, to extend our examination
of it as far as circumstances might admit.</p>

<p>The letter containing this offer also enumerated several
secondary objects, to which we proposed to direct our attention,
and which were ultimately comprehended in our instructions.</p>

<p>The offer and suggestions were favourably entertained by Lord
Glenelg, and further communications invited; and, the project
having been favoured by the support of the Royal Geographical
Society, our services were finally accepted by the
Government.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTIONS.</p>

<p>More mature consideration however led to a material alteration
in the first plan; for whilst our principal object, namely, the
search for a great river or interior inlet, remained the same, it
was considered, for several reasons, more advisable that the
exploration should commence from the vicinity of Prince Regent's
River, on the north-west coast, and be directed towards the Swan.
I shall pass over the various points of detail which occupied our
time and attention until the moment of departure, as they offer
no matters of general interest. It will be sufficient to say that
everything suggested as likely to be conducive to the success and
utility of the expedition was most liberally granted and
supplied; and, when all was prepared, a letter of instructions
dated the 16th June 1837 was addressed by Lord Glenelg to myself
and Lieutenant Lushington conjointly; which embraced the
following points:</p>

<p>1. We were to embark in H.M. sloop of war the Beagle, then
fitting out for a survey of the coasts and seas of Australia,
under the command of Captain Wickham, R.N.; and to proceed in
that vessel either to the Cape of Good Hope or to Swan River, as
might ultimately appear best suited to forward the objects of the
expedition.</p>

<p>2. On our arrival at either of the foregoing places, we were
directed to procure a small vessel to convey the party and stores
to the most convenient point in the vicinity of Prince Regent's
River.</p>

<p>3. After due examination of the country about Prince Regent's
River we were instructed to take such a course as would lead us
in the direction of the great opening behind Dampier's Land. From
the moment of our arrival at this point our subsequent
proceedings were left more discretionary; but the instructions
continued: "You will use the utmost exertions to penetrate from
thence to the Swan River; as, by adopting this course, you will
proceed in a direction parallel to the unknown coast, and must
necessarily cross every large river that flows from the interior
towards that side of the continent."</p>

<p>4. That we might have an opportunity, in the event of any
unforeseen difficulties occurring, of falling back upon the
vessel conveying the party, she was not to quit the place where
she might have been left by it until such a time had elapsed,
from the departure of the expedition for the interior, as should
be agreed upon; and, to ensure the observance of this condition,
we were instructed to act by the advice of the local authorities
of the colony where she might be engaged in drawing up the
agreement, as well as in procuring guarantees for its
fulfilment.</p>

<p>5. The main objects of the expedition were then specified to
be: To gain information as to the real state of North-Western
Australia, its resources, and the course and direction of its
rivers and mountain ranges; to familiarize the natives with the
British name and character; to search for and record all
information regarding the natural productions of the country, and
all details that might bear upon its capabilities for
colonization or the reverse; and to collect specimens of its
natural history.</p>

<p>6. It was directed that strict discipline should be observed,
and the regulations by which our intercourse with the natives was
to be governed were laid down; after which the instructions
concluded with the following paragraphs:</p>

<p>No further detail has been given you in these instructions,
for, as you have been made aware of the motives which have
induced his Majesty's Government to send out the expedition, it
is supposed each individual will do his utmost in his situation
to carry these objects out, either by obtaining all possible
information or by such other means as may be in his power.</p>

<p>Although the instructions regarding the expedition are
addressed to you conjointly as conductors of it, it is necessary
that the principal authority and direction should be vested in
one individual, on whom the chief responsibility would rest.</p>

<p>It is to be understood that Lieutenant Grey, the senior
military officer, is considered as commanding the party and the
person by whose orders and instructions all individuals composing
the party will be guided and conform.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>1837.</p>

<p>All our preparations being completed, there embarked in the
Beagle, besides myself and Mr. Lushington, Mr. Walker, a surgeon
and naturalist, and Corporals Coles and Auger, Royal Sappers and
Miners, who had volunteered their services; and we sailed from
Plymouth on the 5th July 1837.</p>

<p>TENERIFE. AQUEDUCT AT SANTA CRUZ.</p>

<p>The usual incidents of a sea voyage brought us to Santa Cruz
in Tenerife, where I landed on Wednesday 19th July 1837, about 2
o'clock in the afternoon. There was a sort of table d'hote at 3
o'clock at an hotel kept by an Englishman, at which I dined, and
was fortunate in so doing as I met there a German and several
English merchants who were principally engaged in the trade of
the country. There was also a gentleman who had been from his
earliest years in the African trade for gums, etc.; and he gave
me many interesting particulars of the wild life the individuals
so occupied are compelled to lead. In the afternoon I made a set
of magnetic observations and then walked out to see the aqueduct;
which at about three-quarters of a mile to the north-east of the
town approaches it by a passage cut through a mountain. The
execution of this work must have been attended with immense
labour, for, although the design is grand and noble, the actual
plan upon which it has been completed was by no means well
conceived. The average depth of this cut is at least one hundred
and twenty feet, its length is about one hundred and eighty,
whilst its breadth in many parts is not more than four.</p>

<p>Previously to the construction of this aqueduct the town of
Santa Cruz was very badly supplied with water, indeed so much so
that the inhabitants were, at some periods of the year, compelled
to send upwards of three miles for it; but no want of this nature
has ever been experienced since its completion. The expenses of
its construction as also of keeping it in repair are principally
defrayed by a tax upon all wine and spirits actually consumed in
the town.</p>

<p>The scenery of the country I walked through was bold and
romantic but by no means rich; fig-trees grew wild about the
mountains, and it seemed singular that, whenever I approached
one, the peasants on the adjacent hills shouted out in loud
tones. As far as I could understand the guide, this was done to
deter us from eating the fruits now just ripe, and, upon my
return to the town and making further enquiries, I found that
such was their custom.</p>

<p>EXCURSION TO ORATAVA.</p>

<p>July 20th.</p>

<p>I started at six o'clock with Mr. Lushington for Oratava,
distant about 30 miles from Santa Cruz. We were mounted on small
ponies, admirably adapted to the wretched roads of the country,
and accompanied by two guides who carried our carpet bags.</p>

<p>CAMELS, MATANZAS, THE GUANCHES.</p>

<p>The first town we came to was Laguna, which appeared to be of
some importance; it is distant about four miles from Santa Cruz.
On this road we passed many camels laden with heavy burdens; a
circumstance which rather surprised me for I had always imagined
that, owing to the peculiar formation of its foot, the camel was
only fitted for travelling over sandy ground, whilst the way from
Santa Cruz to Laguna is one continued mass of sharp rocks,
utterly unworthy of the name of a road; yet these animals
appeared to move over it without the least inconvenience.</p>

<p>After leaving Laguna the country for some miles bore a very
uninteresting appearance; for, although apparently fertile, it
was quite parched up by the extreme heat of the sun; our guides,
who were on foot carrying our carpet bags, kept up with us by
running, and, occasionally when tired, catching hold of the
horses' tails to assist themselves along.</p>

<p>We halted for breakfast at Matanzas (or the place of
slaughter) so called from a dreadful slaughter of the Spaniards
which was here made by the Guanches, the aborigines of the
island. I examined the spot where this occurred; it is a narrow
defile, formed by a precipice on one hand, and perpendicular
rocks on the other, and lies on the only route by which you can
pass across the island from east to west; it was therefore well
adapted for the purposes of savage warfare, and the Guanches here
made the Spaniards pay dearly for the cruelties practised on
themselves.</p>

<p>All traces of this interesting people, who were eventually
extirpated by the Spaniards, have long since vanished, and,
although I spared no pains, I could glean but little information
about them, but to this subject I will advert again.</p>

<p>Before breakfast I made a set of magnetic observations, and
then, swallowing a hasty meal, prepared to start. A difficulty
however arose here, for neither Mr. Lushington nor myself spoke a
word of Spanish, although we understood tolerably well what
others said to us; the paying our bill became therefore rather a
matter of embarrassment. One of the guides saw our distress and
made signs that he would arrange matters for us; we accordingly
gave him a dollar. With this he paid the bill and I saw him
receive some change, which he coolly pocketed; I afterwards asked
him for it, but he pretended with the utmost nonchalance not to
understand me; so we saw no more of it.</p>

<p>SCENERY NEAR ORATAVA.</p>

<p>In the ride from Matanzas to Oratava the road is wretched but
the scenery compensates for this. Upon arriving at the brow of
the hill above Oratava, a beautiful prospect bursts upon the
sight; directly in front rises the lordly Peak, whilst in the
foreground are vineyards, cottages, and palm-trees; in the centre
stands La Villa, the upper town of Oratava, encircled with
gardens; on the right lies a rich slope running down to the sea
which bounds the prospect on that side; and on the left rise
rocky mountains, for the greater part clothed with wood.</p>

<p>We now spurred our horses on and, leaving the guides behind,
soon reached La Villa, accompanied by a countryman who had joined
us upon a pony; but, on getting into the town, the melancholy
truth rushed upon my recollection that we could not speak
Spanish: had we remained with our guides this would not much have
signified, for they had been told at Santa Cruz to take us to a
hotel.</p>

<p>EMBARRASSMENTS ON ARRIVAL THERE.</p>

<p>Nothing remained now but to do our best to open a
communication; we accordingly accosted a variety of individuals
in English, French, Italian, German--but in vain. Spanish alone
was understood or spoken here; our friend, the countryman, stuck
to us most nobly, he understood us not a bit better than the rest
but saw that we were in distress and would not desert us.</p>

<p>We at last deliberately halted under a house where we could
get a little shade, for the sun was intensely hot and, a crowd
having soon collected, we harangued them alternately and received
long answers in reply; but, although able to make out a great
deal of what they said, we could not get them to understand a
single word on our part. At length kind fate sent the guides to
our rescue and they led us off direct to the hotel.</p>

<p>This however brought only partial relief to our wants; we
opened our mouths, and pointed down our throats. So much was
understood and a chicken instantly killed. We laid our heads upon
a table, feigning sleep, and were shown to a wretched room; but
here all converse terminated. Mr. Lushington desired to ascend
the Peak therefore it became necessary that we should hit upon
some means of making them comprehend this; but all efforts were
in vain. At length they proposed to send for an interpreter,
which was accordingly done; but he was at dinner, and could not
then come.</p>

<p>At last the interpreter arrived, a Spanish Don who had been
for some years resident in a mercantile house in New York; he was
very dirty, but good-natured, and soon made the necessary
arrangements for Mr. Lushington; who for eight dollars was to be
provided with a pony, a sumpter mule, provisions and guides,
taken safely to the top of the Peak and brought back again; which
I thought reasonable enough.</p>

<p>After these arrangements I managed to scrape some acquaintance
with this Spanish gentleman, who told me to my great edification
that I was in a notorious gambling house. I had been informed at
Santa Cruz that the inhabitants of those islands were dreadfully
addicted to that vice, and I now, from personal observation,
found this was too true.</p>

<p>After dinner I started to walk to the Port of Oratava, distant
about three miles; there was beautiful scenery the whole way, and
a tolerable road for the island. I called on Mr. Carpenter, the
British Consul, to whom I had a letter, and he made arrangements
for my being admitted to the botanical gardens at six o'clock the
next morning.</p>

<p>On my return to La Villa all the roues of the town were
assembled at our hotel to eat ices and gamble: I joined them in
the former but not in the latter amusement.</p>

<p>SPANISH INTERPRETER. MANNERS.</p>

<p>The gentleman who had acted as interpreter for us was also
there, but I could gain very little further information from him.
He told me that they had just heard George the Eighth, the King
of England, was dead (William the Fourth had just died) and his
knowledge of the other European countries was much upon the same
scale. I found that gambling was here carried on to an extent
which was really deplorable.</p>

<p>July 21.</p>

<p>I started at half-past five for the botanic gardens,
diligently inspected them, and afterwards made a set of magnetic
observations; this occupied a large portion of the morning. I
however still had time to geologise for about three hours, and
then rode back to Santa Cruz, where I did not arrive till late at
night.</p>

<p>STATISTICS OF THE CANARY ISLANDS. TABLES.</p>

<p>July 22.</p>

<p>In the morning I renewed my magnetic observations and, having
dined at the table d'hote, I passed the afternoon in calling upon
several persons, and collecting such information regarding the
group of islands as I could pick up. Two statistical tables then
given to me I have here inserted.</p>

<p>The first shows the extent of the seven larger islands and the
average number of inhabitants in each. On these numbers I think
dependence may be placed, as they nearly agree, in the total,
with that given by Tarrente in the Geografia Universal (1828) who
makes it 196,517, being about 12,000 above the number given by
Humboldt for the gross population at the end of the last
century.</p>

<p>The second table gives the quantity of the most important
products raised annually in each island.</p>

<p><b>TABLE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PRODUCTS OF EACH

<p>To these I have added a short table showing the mean heat of
every month at Tenerife, as deduced from a continued series of
daily observations by Dr. Savignon and Mr. Richardson, at Laguna
between the years 1811 and 1818, to which is annexed another of
the quantity of rain which fell during some months of the years
1812 and 1813.</p>

<p>The two gentlemen who had made these observations having since
died, I was not able to obtain any of the actual thermometrical
observations, but to the son of Mr. Richardson I am obliged for
having allowed me to copy the results contained in these
tables.</p>

<p><b>METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS AT ORATAVA AND SANTA
CRUZ.</b></p>
</center>

<p>A few observations taken on board the Beagle during the five
days it lay at Santa Cruz seemed to give a mean heat of about 76
degrees; but it must be remembered that these observations were
made in a vessel lying only about a quarter of a mile from the
shore and exposed to the constant rays of the sun during six days
of a season considered by the inhabitants to be a very warm one.
I do not therefore think that the observations of Dr. Savignon
and Mr. Richardson, taken under such very different circumstances
at Laguna, which Von Buch estimates at 264 toises above the sea,
could be far from the truth.</p>

<p>The annual mean temperature of Santa Cruz according to Von
Buch is 71 degrees 8' Fahrenheit, or 21 degrees 8' of the
centigrade scale.</p>

<p>OCCASIONAL VIOLENT STORMS.</p>

<p>From Mr. Cochrane, a very intelligent English merchant whom I
met there, I obtained much information on various points, and he
brought to my notice the violent storms of wind and rain which
occur on the island occasionally during the rainy season, and
cause great destruction and damage.</p>

<p>DAMAGE BY STORM OF 1826.</p>

<p>One had passed over in the month of March of the year I was
there (1837) and I was fortunate enough to obtain an official
account of the damage occasioned by another in November 1826,
which is here annexed. A similar one was experienced, as will be
seen by the table, in January 1812, when 5.24 inches of rain fell
in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>En la noche del 7 al 8 de Novembre 1826, se experimento un

<p>VOCABULARY OF THE CANARIAN DIALECTS.</p>

<p>Sunday July 23.</p>

<p>I procured a few words of the original languages of the
Guanches from in old government manuscript, and as from this
circumstance no doubt can exist as to its authenticity, I have
inserted them.</p>

<p>Several of these will be found already published in the
History of the Canary Islands by Glas (page 174) with occasional
slight differences of spelling, whilst the rest, though few in
number, are, as far as I am aware, now first given.</p>

<p>VOCABULARY OF TENERIFE, OF CANARY AND PALMA.</p>

<p>Such scanty vocabularies and some mummies from Tenerife,
scattered through the cabinets of the curious in various parts of
Europe, are the only existing records of the race which held
possession of these islands on the descent of John de Betancourt,
about the year 1400, and who were nearly exterminated within
little more than a century after.</p>

<p>GUANCHE BONE CAVE. AND REMARKS. MARINE BLOWING STONE. It was
in the course of my enquiries for words of the Guanche language
that I accidentally heard yesterday, from an old inhabitant, of
the existence of a cave in the rocks, about 3 miles to the
north-east of Santa Cruz, which it was impossible to enter, but
which, when examined from the sea, could be observed to be full
of bones. This cave, he said, was known to the old inhabitants by
the name of La Cueva de los Guanches; and according to
traditionary report it had been the burying-place of the original
inhabitants of this island. Several English merchants of whom I
made enquiries knew nothing of it, even by report, but the master
of the hotel was aware of its existence and promised to procure
me guides to it. Although this day was Sunday, yet, as I was to
sail in the afternoon, the inducement was too strong to resist,
and I started in a boat at 6 o'clock with Mr. Walker our surgeon,
taking my geological hammer as I intended to return overland.</p>

<p>When we had proceeded about a mile and a half from Santa Cruz
I was astonished to hear, from the rocks on the shore, a loud
roaring noise, and to see large clouds apparently of ascending
smoke. I landed to ascertain the cause of this, and found it
arose from one of those hollow rocks which are sometimes seen on
our own coast and are known by various names, such as blowing
stones, boiling kettles, etc. etc. I had however never seen one
at all to be compared to this in size. It was formed by a hole in
the rocks through which the water is first poured as the waves
rush in; and then is partly driven out with a loud noise through
a hole far up, and partly returns, in the form of spray, by the
opening through which it was at first impelled. By assuming a
proper position with regard to the sun a most beautiful rainbow
is seen in this spray as it is dashed high into the air, and the
whole is well worthy of a visit. Having collected some shells and
geological specimens we again embarked for the cave.</p>

<p>On reaching the spot we distinctly observed, from the shore,
the mouths of two caves full of bones. As the Guanches were in
the habit of embalming their dead I entertained hopes of
obtaining from them a mummy, of which there are several preserved
in the Canary Islands. Upon landing however I found that they
were utterly inaccessible, being situated in a perpendicular rock
about 150 feet above the level of high water mark, and a
considerable distance beneath the summit of the cliff. I had
indulged a hope of being able to swing into one of the caves by
means of a rope suspended from the top, but, owing to a large
rock which projects from above quite over their mouths, this
would be very difficult. Several bones had been blown out of the
apertures, which I collected and found them to have belonged to
man, but otherwise displaying nothing remarkable.</p>

<p>I can scarcely entertain a doubt but these caves really were
the burying-places of the ancient Guanches, yet how they were
approached I cannot conceive; probably there might have been an
entrance to them from the interior of the country. I searched but
my time was short and I could find no traces of such. An
interesting question here remains to be solved and I trust some
future traveller may be induced to attempt it.</p>

<p>There is only one other supposition I could frame on this
subject, and to this I am led from the fact of the bones lying so
immediately in the caves' mouths. Could a party of the Guanches,
when so oppressed and so cruelly treated by the Spaniards, have
taken refuge by some means in these caverns, and afterwards, from
their retreat being cut off, have found themselves unable to
escape and have here perished miserably; looking out of the
cavern to the last for that assistance they were never doomed to
receive? If they had managed to enter these caves by a narrow
pathway running along the face of the cliffs, which the Spaniards
afterwards destroyed, such an occurrence might readily have taken
place.</p>

<p>Having completed my examination I dismissed the boat and
walked back to Santa Cruz, from whence we sailed at five o'clock
this evening.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 2. TO BAHIA AND THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.</h2>

<p>ATMOSPHERICAL PHENOMENON AT SEA.</p>

<p>Nothing important occurred during the voyage from Tenerife to
Bahia; but one atmospherical phenomenon I think is worthy at a
future day of further enquiry.</p>

<p>I remarked constantly, just at sunset, in these latitudes,
that the eastern horizon was brilliantly illuminated with a kind
of mock sunset. This in a short time disappeared, to be soon
succeeded by another similar in character, but more faint. I
observed at the same time, in the western horizon, the regular
sunset, and then two appearances, like those seen in the east;
perhaps this may be fully accounted for by a triple reflection,
as in the common theory of the rainbow.</p>

<p>LAND AT BAHIA.</p>

<p>August 17.</p>

<p>We came in sight of the coast of South America about noon, and
dropped anchor in the harbour of Bahia at four P.M.; and about
half an hour after I went on shore with Mr. Lushington, a person
of the name of Wilson taking us in his boat: there was a slave in
the boat, and, not knowing that he understood English, I asked
Mr. Wilson several questions about slaves in general, and he gave
me a good deal of information on this subject, mentioning among
other things that the price of a good slave here varied from 90
to 100 pounds, he happened to state that the slaves were wretched
in their own country, and that frequently large numbers were
sacrificed to their gods. I never saw so fine a burst of natural
indignation as the slave in the boat evinced at this statement;
his lip curled up with scorn, his dark eye grew vividly bright,
and his frame quivered as he made an impassioned reply in
Portuguese; I could not understand all that he said, but caught
enough to know the tenor of it, that "this was not the case;
Englishmen or foreigners never visited his country, so how could
they know." It was not so much what he said but the scornful
bitterness of his manner that made an impression on me, not
easily to be effaced.</p>

<p>NIGHT WALK.</p>

<p>I took a night walk in the country this evening and
experienced those wild and undescribable feelings which accompany
the first entrance into a rich tropical country. I had arrived
just towards the close of the rainy season, when everything was
in full verdure, and new to me. The luxuriant foliage expanding
in magnificent variety, the brightness of the stars above, the
dazzling brilliancy of the fireflies around me, the breeze laden
with balmy smells, and the busy hum of insect life making the
deep woods vocal, at first oppress the senses with a feeling of
novelty and strangeness till the mind appears to hover between
the realms of truth and falsehood.</p>

<p>THE TOWN OF BAHIA.</p>

<p>The town of Bahia looks very beautiful from the sea; but on
entering you find it dreadfully filthy. The stench of the lower
town is horrible. Even the President's palace is a dirty and
wretched-looking building: his salary, I understand, is 600
pounds a year. By the last returns the population of the town was
120,000, 100,000 of whom were blacks. All the burdens here are
carried by slaves as there are no carts and the breed of horses
is small, being perfect ponies.</p>

<p>The exports are cotton and sugar--the cotton chiefly to
Liverpool, the sugar to all European countries but England. Their
imports are English cotton goods and hardware, also various
manufactured goods from Germany. The nuns are famed for the
manufacture of artificial feathers and flowers.</p>

<p>The fruit here is excellent, the oranges are particularly
fine.</p>

<p>The merchants in the town are principally English and German.
There is no American house. Several have started but all who made
the attempt have failed.</p>

<p>You cannot penetrate any great distance into the interior as
there are no roads but only little pathways through the woods.
The Indians are frequently seen very near the town.</p>

<p>STATE OF SOCIETY.</p>

<p>This part of Brazil offered the curious spectacle of a great
evil, which has been long suffered to exist and is now advancing,
gradually yet surely, to that state which must entail inevitable
destruction on the existing Government of the country. I allude
to the immense slave population which, owing to a short-sighted
policy, has been allowed to increase so rapidly from the frequent
and numerous importations that at the present moment they are in
the ratio of 10 to 1 to the white population, to whom they are
also, individually, immensely superior in physical strength; the
Brazilians being the most insignificant and feeble race of men I
have ever yet seen.</p>

<p>DANGERS FROM SLAVE POPULATION.</p>

<p>The blacks are perfectly aware of their own power, and about
two years ago had arranged a plan for seizing the town and
murdering all the whites with the exception of foreigners; which
miscarried only by the affair being discovered a few hours before
it broke out. This plan was however so wisely and boldly
conceived, both as a whole and in detail, that it alone affords
the most conclusive evidence that the slave population in this
country are by no means deficient either in mental powers or
personal courage.</p>

<p>The Brazilians themselves are aware of the danger which
threatens them, and yet evince an extraordinary degree of
supineness with regard to it. They have indeed framed certain
regulations as to the slaves being all within their houses at an
early hour of the evening, etc. etc., and these they deem
sufficient for their protection; yet to an unprejudiced observer
it would appear that, unless some much more effective measures
are adopted, within a few years from the present time the whole
of this fine country will be in the hands of the blacks: and
indeed I think one would be justified in concluding that the
moment which produces a person sufficiently intriguing again to
stir up the slaves, and endowed with the firmness and talent
necessary to conduct an emeute of this nature, will be the last
of the Brazilian Empire.</p>

<p>POLITICAL CONDITION OF THE STATE.</p>

<p>It is evident from what I have before stated that the only
hope the white population can reasonably entertain of retaining
their present position must be in the most perfect union and
concord amongst themselves, and that, when a unity of design and
action ceases to exist between the different provinces, their
fate is sealed. Yet this circumstance never appears to enter into
their calculations; and at this instant each state is plotting
its separation from the Empire. The inhabitants here openly state
their intention of revolting and declaring their independence,
and Sunday next is even mentioned as the day for the commencement
of the rising.*</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. The revolt broke out on the 7th November
1837 but was suppressed the following month. Great alarm existed
lest the Negro slaves should be induced to take their part
likewise in the conflict between the contending factions. Annual
Register for 1837.)</blockquote>

<p>It is really strange to one who stands by, a calm unconcerned
spectator, to observe men hurried on by the violence of faction
to their own certain destruction, and to behold them so entirely
blinded by party spirit as not to see that danger which stares
them so openly in the face, that a child could scarcely fail to
detect it.</p>

<p>The Slave Trade, though nominally abolished, is actively
pursued here, eighty-three slaves having been landed just before
my arrival, and another cargo during my stay.</p>

<p>The slaves are not only a very superior race of men in point
of physical powers, but, as far as my experience of their habits
went, I found them very moral and honest. Their notions of
religion were however curious. Several were Christians nominally,
but their Christianity consisted in wearing a string of beads
round the neck; and they seriously assured me that those who wore
beads went up to heaven after death, and that those who did not
went down under the waters.</p>

<p>I talked to many of them about their own land. None had
forgotten it, but they all expressed the most ardent desire to
see it again. They call themselves captives, not slaves, and are
very punctilious upon this point. They labour very hard here,
generally in the town, paying their masters eighteen-pence a day,
and keeping the rest of their earnings for themselves. The rate
of labour must therefore be high; but they wear scarcely any
clothes, and their subsistence, which is jerked beef and beans,
costs but little. The slaves in the country are however all
obliged to work on their owners' plantations.</p>

<p>All the principal people in the town are concerned in the
slave trade, and their chief wealth consists in the number of
slaves they possess; therefore there is little chance of the
trade being, for many years, totally abolished.</p>

<p>With regard to the execution of the laws this country is much
in the same state as certain parts of Ireland. Homicide, and
attempts at homicide, by shooting, are frequent; but it is
difficult, if not impossible, to convict the offenders, for he
who renders himself conspicuous in prosecuting parties concerned
in a murder assuredly gets shot at in his turn.</p>

<p>IMPRESSIONS AND OBSERVATIONS AT SEA. REMARKS ON VOYAGE FROM
BAHIA TO THE CAPE.</p>

<p>August 25.</p>

<p>Re-embarked in the Beagle and sailed for the Cape of Good
Hope.</p>

<p>September 10.</p>

<p>We had yesterday and all last night a gale of wind, succeeded
this day by a heavy fall of rain. The wind had raised a very high
sea, but when the rain began to fall I heard the captain and
several of the officers remark that the rain would lay the sea;
for the result of their experience was, "that a fall of rain
always beats the sea down." What they had stated would occur took
place in this instance within two or three hours. This shows
forcibly what great results a slight force, continued for a long
time, will produce.</p>

<p>September 15.</p>

<p>Whilst standing on the deck of the Beagle this evening we
remarked large luminous spots in the water. They appeared to be
about 12 inches in circumference, were very numerous, and
perfectly stationary. The light they emitted was phosphorescent,
but far brighter than I had ever before witnessed; it was so
vivid as to be distinctly visible for nearly a quarter of a
mile.</p>

<p>September 16.</p>

<p>We saw this morning an immense number of fin-backed whales,
some of which were quite close to the vessel. In the course of
half an hour I counted thirty of them. Could they have been
feeding on the phosphorescent animals we saw last night?</p>

<p>We are today about 600 miles from the Cape, and there is a
strange discordance amongst the elements. From the south-west
comes a long and heavy swell; a strong breeze is blowing from the
east, and threatening clouds spring upwards from the north. These
omens have a meaning. Down to the southward, somewhere off Cape
Horn, there blows a furious gale. The wind will draw round
shortly to the northward. That is the interpretation and the
reading.</p>

<p>A swell like this one can only witness off the Cape of Good
Hope. It was to me a novel and magnificent sight. Uniform and
lofty ridges of waves advancing in rapid succession, and yet with
so regular and undisturbed a motion that one might easily fancy
these great walls of water to be stationary: yet onward they
moved in uniform and martial order; whilst as the ship rose upon
their crests she seemed to hover for a moment over the ocean in
mid air. And now the wind drew round to the northward and it blew
almost a gale. The vessel felt its power and bent before it. It
was beautiful to watch the process of hand-reefing topsails and
making the vessel snug--the ready obedience to the word of
command and the noiseless discipline with which each duty was
fulfilled. First had the men clustered on the rigging like bees;
then at the word to lay out they fearlessly extended themselves
along the yard-arm, and whilst they took in the reefs the ship
pitched and rolled so heavily that one felt anxious for their
safety: but there they swung securely between high heaven and the
sea.</p>

<p>SEA-BIRDS.</p>

<p>The sea-birds held their holiday in the stormy gale. The
lordly and graceful Albatross, whose motion is a very melody,
swept screaming by upon the blast. The smaller Cape pigeons
followed us fast, passing and repassing across the vessel's
track. At last one of them spies a fragment on the waters, which
has been thrown overboard: a moment it hovers above, then plunges
down. But the other birds have seen it too; and all, pouncing on
the spot, move their wings confusedly and seem to run along the
waters with a rapid and eager motion. Now is there discord wild
amongst them. A screaming and diving, swimming and running,
mingled with a chattering noise. No sooner does one gain the
morsel than another tears it from him. Who will be the victor
here? The Albatross; for he sweeps triumphantly over all, swoops
down, and with a scream scares off the timid little multitude;
whilst high above his head he holds his arching wings; and now in
pride and beauty he sits upon the waters and, drifting fast
astern, gradually fades in the twilight.</p>

<p>What wonder that a sailor is superstitious! Separated in early
youth from his home ere he has forgotten the ghost stories of
childhood, and whilst the young and simple heart still loves to
dwell upon the marvellous, he is placed in such scenes as these:
in the dark night, amidst the din of waves and storms, he hears
wild shrieks upon the air, and by him float huge forms, dim and
mysterious, from which fancy is prone to build strange phantoms;
and oft from aged sailors he gathers legends and wondrous tales
suited to his calling; whilst the narrator's mysterious tone and
earnest voice and manner attest how firmly he himself believes
the story.</p>

<p>ARRIVAL AT THE CAPE. HIRE THE LYNHER.</p>

<p>September 21.</p>

<p>We came in sight of land yesterday evening, and spent the
greater part of the day in beating up False Bay to Simonstown,
where we arrived about half-past six P.M. I instantly landed in a
shore-boat with Lieutenant Lushington and Mr. Walker; and, having
first hurried to Admiral Sir P. Campbell with some letters I had
to him, we forthwith started to ride to Cape Town. Finding that a
vessel for our expedition could be procured here more readily and
economically than at Swan River I determined on making this my
point of departure, and after diligent enquiry I finally hired
the Lynher, a schooner of about 140 tons, Henry Browse master,
and subsequently found every reason to be satisfied, both with
the little vessel and her commander.</p>

<p>EQUIPMENT AND PLANS. SAIL FOR HANOVER BAY.</p>

<p>My time was now wholly occupied in completing the preparations
for our future proceedings. I increased my party by a few
additional hands of good character, and thought myself fortunate
in engaging amongst them Thomas Ruston, a seaman who had already
served on the Australian coast under Captain King. On the 12th
October I with great difficulty got my affairs at Cape Town so
arranged as to be able to embark in the evening, and on the
morning of the 13th we hove anchor and made sail.</p>

<p>The party now embarked consisted of:</p>

<p>Lieutenant Grey.<br>
Lieutenant Lushington.<br>
Mr. Walker, our Surgeon.<br>
Mr. Powell, Surgeon.<br>
Corporal R. Auger, Corporal John Coles, and Private Mustard of
the Corps of Sappers and Miners.<br>
J.C. Cox, a Stock-Keeper.<br>
Thomas Ruston, a Sailor who had been on the coast of Australia in
the Mermaid with Captain King.<br>
Evan Edwards, a Sailor.<br>
Henry Williams and R. Inglesby, Shoemakers.</p>

<p>There were besides on board a captain, a mate, seven men, and
a boy.</p>

<p>The livestock I took from the Cape consisted altogether of
thirty-one sheep, nineteen goats, and six dogs. The dogs were as
follows: one greyhound; one dog bred between a greyhound and a
foxhound; one between a greyhound and a sheepdog; a bull-terrier;
a Cape wolf-dog; and a useful nondescript mongrel.</p>

<p>RE-EMBARKATION FOR HANOVER BAY.</p>

<p>The plan that I had finally resolved on adopting was:</p>

<p>To proceed in the first instance to Hanover Bay, there to
select a good spot on which to form a temporary encampment; and,
having landed the stock, to despatch Lieutenant Lushington with
Cox and Williams in the vessel to Timor for ponies.</p>

<p>PLANS ON LANDING.</p>

<p>I selected Cox and Williams for this service because the
former was used to the management of horses on board vessels, and
the latter understanding Dutch was well calculated to act as
interpreter at Timor. During their absence I intended to practise
the party in making short explorations in different
directions.</p>

<p>Upon the return of the vessel I intended to move the whole
party to some convenient spot to be chosen during their absence,
then to advance, attended only by Coles, and to fix upon the next
spot on our route which I designed to halt at. This plan I
intended to adhere to as much as possible throughout the whole
expedition, namely, never to move the party from one place of
halt until I had chosen the next one. We bore with us tools and
instruments of every description; so that we not only were fully
capable of maintaining ourselves but could literally, if occasion
had required it, have founded the nucleus of a colony.</p>

<p>Great then was my joy when all my preparations were completed
and I felt the vessel gliding swiftly from Table Bay into that
vast ocean at the other extremity of which lay the land I so
longed to see, and to which I was now bound with the ardent hope
of opening the way for the conversion of a barren wilderness into
a fertile garden.</p>

<p>Part of my plan was not only to introduce all useful animals
that I possibly could into this part of Australia, but also the
most valuable plants of every description. For this purpose, a
collection had been made at Tenerife by Mr. Walker, under my
direction, and another in South America,* including the seeds of
the cotton plant. From the Cape and from England I had also
procured other useful plants, and had planned that the vessel, on
quitting Timor with the horses, should be filled in every vacant
space with young cocoa-nut trees and other fruits, together with
useful animals such as goats and sheep, in addition to the stock
we conveyed from the Cape.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. We had been able to introduce several
useful plants into the Cape; amongst others the South American
Yam, which, owing to the quality of the potatoes and their great
fluctuations in price, will eventually be very serviceable to the
colonists, more especially for the use of whalers.)</blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER 3. FROM THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE TO HANOVER BAY.</h2>

<p>NATURAL HISTORY.</p>

<p>FORSTER'S PACHYPTILA (Pachyptila vittata.)</p>

<p>October 16.</p>

<p>I shot a female petrel; it had a nail planted in the heel, but
no thumb; the bill was hooked at the end, the extremity of which
seemed to consist of a distinct piece, articulated with the
remainder; the nostrils were united, and formed a tube laid on
the back of the upper mandible, hence it belonged to the family
of Petrels (Procellariae.)</p>

<p>Its temperature was 94 degrees.<br>
Length from tip to tip of wing, 2 feet 3 inches.<br>
Length from tip of beak to tip of tail, 1 foot 2.4 inches.<br>
Length from root to tip of tail, 4 inches.<br>
Length of beak, 1.45 inches.<br>
Length of foot, 1.55 inches.<br>
Breadth across body, 2.3 inches.</p>

<p>Colour of beak and legs black; body white underneath; general
colour above, a light bluish slate, which grows darker in the
head and wing covers; tail tipped with black; the four first wing
feathers tinged with black.</p>

<p>CAPE PIGEONS.</p>

<p>I also shot this afternoon three Cape pigeons (Procellaria
capensis) white underneath, spotted black and white above.</p>

<p>FIRST SPECIMEN--Female.</p>

<p>Temperature, 98 1/2 degrees.<br>
Length from tip to tip of wing, 2 feet 11.3 inches.<br>
Length from tip of tail to tip of beak, 1 foot 6 inches.<br>
Length from tip of beak, 1.5 inches.<br>
Length from root to tip of tail,4.1 inches.<br>
Length of foot, 2.3 inches.<br>
Breadth across body, 3.2 inches.</p>

<p>SECOND SPECIMEN.</p>

<p>Length from tip to tip of wing, 2 feet 5 inches.<br>
Length from tip of tail to tip of beak, 1 foot 5 inches.<br>
Length from tip of beak, 1.5 inches.<br>
Length from root to tip of tail, 4 inches.<br>
Length of foot, 2.3 inches.<br>
Breadth across body, 3 inches.</p>

<p>THIRD SPECIMEN--Female.</p>

<p>Length from tip to tip of wing, 2 feet 5.5 inches.<br>
Length from tip of tail to tip of beak, 1 foot 4.6 inches.<br>
Length from tip of beak, 1.3 inches.<br>
Length from root to tip of tail, 4.6 inches.<br>
Length of foot, 2.2 inches.<br>
Breadth across body, 3.4 inches.</p>

<p>Two species of insects were found in these Cape pigeons.</p>

<p>The only difference I have been able to observe between the
male and female of these birds is, that the male has the black
spots of rather a deeper hue.</p>

<p>October 21. Latitude 38 degrees 15 south; longitude 35 degrees
53 minutes east.</p>

<p>From a variety of observations I am able to bear testimony to
the correctness of a fact that has been before noticed, namely,
that the Medusae invariably live in families. This single
circumstance is remarkable in connection with other points of
natural history since it will tend to explain the reason of
certain classes of Petrels (Procellariae) only visiting
particular parts of the ocean.</p>

<p>Sunday October 22. Latitude 37 degrees 44 minutes south;
longitude 38 degrees 00 east.</p>

<p>Caught two small animals, one closely resembling a small
shrimp (Penaeus) but having the head covered with a most
beautiful purple shield. I kept this alive in a jug. The other in
size and appearance exactly like a purple grape (Hyalea) with a
greenish tinge at one extremity surrounding an aperture, and a
distinct aperture at the other extremity. It was 0.4 inches in
diameter, and had the power of emitting a phosphorescent light. I
have since this period found several varieties of this animal;
which, when it expands itself, closely resembles an insect, and
has little wings. Further on will be found a sketch of these
animals in their expanded state. (See illustration, Hyalea figure
1.)</p>

<p>THE ALBATROSS (Diomedea exulans).</p>

<p>We caught four of these birds yesterday, from which I made the
following measurements:</p>

<p>FIRST SPECIMEN. Weight, 19 1/2 pounds.</p>

<p>Length from tip of wing to tip of wing, 10 feet 2 inches.<br>
Length from tip of beak to tip of tail, 4 feet 0.5 inches.<br>
Length of beak, 6.8 inches.<br>
Length from root to tip of tail, 10.0 inches.<br>
Length of foot, 7.6 inches.<br>
Length of wing, 4 feet 8 inches.<br>
Height from ground, 2 feet 10 inches.<br>
Temperature 98 degrees, the thermometer placed under the tongue
during life. These measurements were all made during the lifetime
of the bird.</p>

<p>SECOND SPECIMEN. Weight, 15 1/2 pounds.</p>

<p>Length from tip of wing to tip of wing, 10 feet.<br>
Length from tip of beak to tip of tail, 3 feet 11 inches.<br>
Length of beak, 6.6 inches.<br>
Height from ground to top of head, 2 feet 4 inches.<br>
Temperature 98 degrees.</p>

<p>THIRD SPECIMEN. The largest bird of the kind I have hitherto
seen.</p>

<p>Length from tip of wing to tip of wing, 10 feet 8 inches.<br>
Length from tip of beak to tip of tail, 4 feet 6 inches.<br>
Breadth across the body, 8 inches.<br>
Length of bill, 6.7 inches.<br>
Length of foot, 7.5 inches.</p>

<p>FOURTH SPECIMEN. The same size as the second.</p>

<p>Length of beak, 6.3 inches.<br>
Length of foot, 6.9 inches.</p>

<p>The beak of each of these birds during lifetime was of a
beautiful light rose colour; their voice was something like that
of a goose, but rather louder, deeper, and hoarser. If during
life the beak was pressed with the finger it became quite white,
and it was not until the pressure had for some time been removed
that the colour returned. The specimens I have described above
(all males) were quite white underneath; the white above being
speckled with black spots and streaks, sometimes changing to a
brownish hue; the wings were black. We obtained also a female
bird with the following measurements, which has been described as
a distinct species: Length from tip to tip of wing, 7 feet 2
inches.<br>
Length from tip of tail to tip of beak, 3 feet 5.5 inches.<br>
Length from root to tip of tail, 9 inches.<br>
Length of beak, 4.5 inches.<br>
Length of foot, 5 inches.</p>

<p>Legs pale flesh colour; beak, black, with a brown-coloured
streak on each side of the lower mandible; the whole body of a
dirty black colour, acquiring a lighter tinge underneath.</p>

<p>October 30.</p>

<p>I shot two male specimens of this last bird: the only
distinction between them and the female was that they were rather
smaller, and had a white streak instead of a light brown one on
each side of the lower mandible.</p>

<p>FIRST SPECIMEN--Male. Weight, 5 1/2 pounds. Length from tip of
wing to tip of wing 6 feet 6 inches.<br>
Length from tip of beak to tip of tail, 2 feet 6 inches.<br>
Length from root to tip of tail, 11 inches.<br>
Length from root to tip of beak, 4 inches.<br>
Length from root to tip of foot, 5 inches.<br>
Length from root to tip of wing, 2 feet 10 inches.</p>

<p>SECOND SPECIMEN--Male. Weight 7 pounds.</p>

<p>Length from tip to tip of wing, 6 feet 9 inches.<br>
Length from tip of beak to tip of tail, 2 feet 10 inches.<br>
Length of tail, 10.6 inches.<br>
Length of beak, 4.7 inches.<br>
Length of foot, 5 inches.<br>
Length of wing, 3 feet.</p>

<p>All the three specimens of this species had a distinct
although minute claw, representing a thumb, upon one leg, thus
apparently forming a link between the genus Procellaria and the
genus Diomedea.</p>

<p>PACHYPTILA VITTATA.</p>

<p>Ash-grey above; white in the under parts; quills,
tail-feathers at the tip, and band on the wings when expanded,
brownish-black.</p>

<p>Length from tip to tip of wing, 2 feet.<br>
Length from tip of beak to tip of tail, 10 inches.<br>
Length from root to tip of tail, 4.3 inches.<br>
Length of beak, 1 inch.<br>
Length of foot, 1.5 inches.<br>
Length of wing, 10.5 inches.</p>

<p>This bird is of the same species as the one I procured on the
16th of October. I shot it about nine A.M. They are very numerous
in these latitudes; their flight resembles much that of a snipe.
The name by which they are known to the sailors is the
whale-bird; they appear to take their food upon the wing, for I
have never yet seen them sit upon the waters even for a single
second, although I have observed them frequently, and at all
hours; but night and day they hurry on with the same restless,
rapid flight, sometimes going in large flocks; and I have never
upon shore seen so many birds assembled upon a few square miles
as I have sometimes here observed in the open ocean. I never
heard them utter any cry or sound.</p>

<p>I saw but few Cape pigeons (Procellaria capensis) after
passing the 40th degree of longitude, and neither Cape pigeons
nor albatrosses after passing the 95th degree of longitude, and
32nd parallel of latitude. I have never seen a petrel or bird of
the family Longipennes discharge its oily fluid at anyone who
worried or attacked it; but have almost invariably seen it
involuntarily eject it,when hurt or frightened.</p>

<p>THE ALBATROSS.</p>

<p>November 9.</p>

<p>I caught four albatrosses with a fishing-line; one of them was
a female, the first I had seen. I observed no marked difference
between her and males of the same species, for I have found them
vary much in the dark shades upon their feathers.</p>

<p>I have yet found no bird of this family whose foot was not
longer than its beak.</p>

<p>DIOMEDEA EXULANS--Female.</p>

<p>Length from tip of wing to tip of wing,10 feet 10 inches.<br>
Length from tip of wing, 4 feet 10 inches.<br>
From tip of beak to tip of tail, 4 feet 9 inches.<br>
Length of beak, 7.2 inches.<br>
Length of tail, 9 inches.<br>
Length of foot, 7.5 inches.</p>

<p>The black and brown marks on this bird were darker than the
corresponding ones on the males.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think that the chief characteristic that
distinguishes the females from the males in the family
Longipennes is their greater size: my opinion is grounded upon
the following tables, drawn up from careful measurements, made by
myself.</p>

<p>(TABLE OF FAMILY LONGIPENNES)</p>

<p>In each of these three instances the female is larger than the
males; they are the only ones I am able to adduce which bear upon
this point.</p>

<p>November 11. South latitude 30 degrees 47 minutes; east
longitude 100 degrees 21 minutes 15 seconds.</p>

<p>Being a calm, I gave the men leave to bathe this afternoon,
and was one of the first overboard myself. Within an hour and a
half after we had done bathing, a cry of a shark was raised, and
in truth there was the monster (the first we had seen). I mention
this fact as tending to support what I have often heard stated,
namely, that a shark's sense of smell is so keen that, if men
ever bathe in seas where they are found, a shark is almost sure
to appear directly afterwards. This really occurred in the
present instance.</p>

<p>We repeatedly caught many little animals which I believe are
the VELELLA of Lamarck. They consist of a flat oval cartilage, on
which they float; there is a mouth in the inferior surface of
this surrounded with many tentacula; on its superior surface is a
crest which remains above water, and the wind blowing against it
turns the animal round; they thus swim with a rotatory motion;
the crest is placed obliquely to the length of the oval
cartilage, and this position of it perhaps assists in producing
the motion; the crest is perfectly transparent, but marked with
little striae; the oval cartilage is marked with concentric
striae, which indicate the lines of its growth; in some this
cartilage is transparent, in others quite blue.</p>

<p>November 12. South latitude 30 degrees 11; east longitude 100
degrees 31 minutes 30 seconds.</p>

<p>We caught several beautiful animals this day, of the Medusae
kind (Diphya). (See Illustration 3, Diphya, Sp.)</p>

<center>
<p><a name="grey1-05"></a><img alt="" src="/ebooks/e00054-images/grey1-05.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Diphya, Sp.</b></p>

Figure 1 represents a section through one of them, the size of
life: the bag (1) is of a delicate bright amber colour. The long
tentacula issuing out are upwards of a foot in length and of a
bright flesh colour.

<p>Figure 2 is a section across the animal.</p>

<p>Figure 3 represents the mouth of the large opening at c, d, as
if one was looking down into it.</p>

<p>Figure 4 upper part; Figure 5 lower; and Figure 6 the perfect
animal.</p>

<p>Between c d apparently lay the entrance to its mouth; in the
little bag marked (3) its long tentacula were concealed, and
below these lay a little gut marked (4) which communicated with
the point (L) by a small canal: (1) was its swimming apparatus,
and by alternate contractions and expansions of this, it took in
and expelled water, and thus acquired a rapid motion, the pointed
end (L) moving forwards.</p>

<p>Its length was 1.7 inches.<br>
Breadth, 0.7 inches.<br>
Thickness, 0.35 inches.<br>
Temperature the same as the water, 65 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>The sketch Illustration 4, Diphya, Sp. gives a faint idea of
the most beautiful animal of this kind which I have ever seen. It
was so delicate that, with the slightest touch, portions of it
came off, hence the specimen we obtained is I fear useless. The
body consisted only of a central canal, to which were attached a
number of gelatinous bags, with large lateral openings, so large
that other zoophytes were caught in them, and apparently annoyed
the animal; who continued throwing water out until it expelled
them. The whole was surmounted by a number of the most beautiful
rose-coloured tentacula: I counted eleven on it, and found four
more that were torn off, but there may have been more. Its top,
when looked into closely, resembled some of the sea anemones; and
inside of the large bright orange-coloured tentacula were placed
circular rows of smaller ones. Its body was quite transparent,
with the exception of the central canal, which was of a
milk-white colour, and terminated in a small sac of the same
hue.</p>

<p>It moved in a direction opposite to the tentacula, by taking
in water at the lateral openings of the bags, in the position in
which it is represented; then bending these towards the
tentacula, and expelling it with great violence.</p>

<p>Temperature the same as the water, 65 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>Length of body (to tentacula from root of tail-like canal) 1.8
inches.<br>
Length of tentacula, 1.2 inches.<br>
Length of tail-like canal, 0.45 inches.<br>
Breadth, 1.1 inches.<br>
Thickness, 0.8 inches.</p>

<p>Long tentacula, flesh-coloured; large tentacula,
rose-coloured; lateral bags, tinged with clear amber; the rest of
the animal perfectly transparent.</p>

<p>We this evening caught several curious little animals (Clio ?)
which when taken out of the water appeared like small balls of
the same matter as that of which a slug is composed. Presently a
little head peered out, then the body expanded itself, and
finally two little things like wings were spread forth, formed of
a fine membrane; they moved these very rapidly, and swam with
great velocity.</p>

<p>We caught several small crabs, and two kinds of shells, of a
beautiful purple colour. (Janthina exigua.) These were very
small; I have preserved several of them.</p>

<p><b>8. Erichthus vitreus.</b></p>
</center>

<p>Figure 3. A little shrimp-like animal (Erichthus vitreus)
caught on the 14th November, latitude 29 degrees 26 minutes
south; longitude 101 degrees 32 minutes east. Its head was
protected by a shield, such as is shown in the figure.</p>

<p>We caught this day several other Acalepha, two of which were
of the wonderful genus DIPHYA. I yesterday drew a coloured figure
of the lower part of one of these animals.</p>

<p>This animal in its perfect state (such as we found it in
today) consists of two individuals, the part of one being encased
in a cavity of the other. Figures 4 and 5 Illustration 4 will
give a correct idea of the way in which this junction is
effected. The least motion separates these two parts, and each
forms a perfect animal, which performs all the functions of life.
This is the more extraordinary, as the containing animal is
furnished with an organ not possessed by the contained, and which
in their united state is used by both. Figure 5. From the little
bag (f) at the bottom of the cavity (g) the receiver produces a
chaplet, which traverses the canal in the received marked (2) in
Figure 6, and which is here drawn the size of life, was sometimes
expanded to the length of one foot eight inches. This organ,
according to M. Cuvier, is composed of ovaries, tentacula, and
suckers.</p>

<p>The swimming apparatus, marked (1) and (4) in Figure 6, act
simultaneously; they are of a bright amber colour, and their
mouth (a) and (h) are closed with little valves, nearly invisible
even when in motion; the points round their upper aperture seem
to form the hinges for these. In twenty seconds I counted seventy
expansions and dilatations of this apparatus. The chaplet and the
bag that holds it are flesh-coloured; the rest of the body is
gelatinous and diaphanous. They live in families, and swim with
great rapidity in the same manner as the other Acalepha.</p>

<p>Caught also shells and crabs of the same kind as
yesterday.</p>

<p>November 14. Latitude 29 degrees 26 minutes south; longitude
101 degrees 2 minutes east.</p>

<p>Physsophora rosacea, Cuvier, see below. We caught another
animal of the same kind as the one taken on the 12th of November,
and figured in Illustration 7. It was so delicate that I did not
measure it for fear of its falling to pieces, but it appeared to
be exactly the same size as the former one.</p>

<p>Its circle of large tentacula were of a bright pink, and were
fifteen in number; inside this circle was a smaller one of the
same number of shorter tentacula, which were not quite so bright
a pink colour; in the centre of these were placed organs of a
very extraordinary nature, apparently quite round, and not
thicker than the very finest silk; they were arranged exactly in
the form of a corkscrew, and from the beauty of their mechanism,
the animal could press fold against fold, and thus render them
less than a quarter of an inch in length, and I watched it almost
instantaneously expand them to the length of nine inches. After
having observed the animal closely for an hour I am writing this
with it before me, alive in a large glass bottle of salt water,
and measuring what I put down. The manner in which it expands
these organs is by first uncoiling those folds nearest the body,
and afterwards those most remote; so that when folded up it looks
like a corkscrew with the folds pressed close together, and when
expanded, like a long straight thin bit of flesh-coloured silk,
with a little corkscrew of the same material at the end. The
larger tentacula are shaped like the trunk of an elephant, and
their extremity is furnished with a very delicate organ with
which they can catch anything, and, if touched, they instantly
turn some of these tentacula, which they have the power of moving
in any direction, to the point so touched. They are not
electrical: the lateral bags have a slight tinge of a bright
amber colour. These animals sustain themselves in the water by
means of the little bag marked (a) in the figure, which floats on
the surface full of air, they there swim in the manner before
described. I afterwards observed very minute globules, or lumps,
in the long silk-like tentacula. When expanded these were very
distinct.</p>

<p><b>9. Janthina exigua.</b></p>
</center>

<p>We caught several small shells (Janthina exigua) this
afternoon: Illustration 9 represents one of them, with the string
of air bubbles attached, by means of which they swim on the
water. They appear not to be able to free themselves from this
mass of bubbles: every shell I have yet found floating in the
Indian Ocean possesses these bubbles in a greater or less degree;
they were of a purple colour. I have seen the common garden snail
in England emit a nearly similar consistency: they also emit a
blue or purple liquid, which colours anything it touches.</p>

<p>The animals of the barnacles (Pentalasmis) attached to these
shells assume their purple colours, while the shell remains
nearly pure white.</p>

<p>This afternoon we caught an animal (Glaucus, Illustration 10)
I had not before seen. It seemed to represent the order reptilia
in the Mollusca, being sluggish in movement, its eyes distinct,
sensitive to the touch, its head much resembling a lizard in
appearance, and having a very strong unpleasant smell when taken
out of the water. During the hour I observed it in a bucket it
remained sluggishly floating on the top, and occasionally
swimming by moving its arms slowly along the surface. The first
three that I saw pass the vessel I imagined to be feathers
floating on the water.</p>

<p><b>10. Glaucus, Sp.</b></p>

<p>Its description is as follows:</p>

<p>Length from head to tail, a c 1.8 inches.<br>
Length from head to root of tail, a b 0.85 inches.<br>
Length from head to first arm 0.2 inches.<br>
Length from head to second arm 0.45 inches.<br>
Length from head to third arm 0.7 inches.</p>

<p>1st arm.<br>
From centre of back to end of round part, d e 0.3 inches.<br>
From e to the end of short tentacula, e f 0.3 inches.<br>
Ditto to long ditto, e g 0.75 inches.<br>
Diameter of round part and attached tentacula 0.4 inches.</p>

<p>2nd arm.<br>
From centre of back to end of tentacula. 0.4 inches.</p>

<p>3rd arm, do. do. 0.25 inches.<br>
Breadth of body between the two first arms 0.13 inches.<br>
Thickness 0.25 inches.</p>

<p>General colour of body, indigo blue, of a darkish tinge; down
the centre of the back a white streak, terminating at the root of
the tail; sides blue, tail blue, quite white underneath, its
belly altogether resembling that of a frog; tail tapering to a
point.</p>

<p>1st arm. 26 tentacula attached to the rounded paddle-shaped
part of this arm, the centre tentacle more than twice the length
of the others. These tentacula were so delicate that at the
slightest touch they fell off. Those nearest the body were so
small as to be almost imperceptible, gradually increasing in
length as they approach the centre, and then decreasing to the
other side. Centre of paddle-shaped part white, tentacula blue
and white, fringed with dark blue at the extremity.</p>

<p>2nd arm. 18 tentacula to this, centre ones the largest. Same
colour as first arm.</p>

<p>3rd arm. 12 tentacula, not forming such a regular circle as on
the two first arms, and apparently issuing directly from a very
short limb attached to the body.</p>

<p>The general appearance of the skin was that of a frog. It had
the power of contracting itself considerably.</p>

<p>Caught a slug-like animal (Holothuria) this evening, or rather
more closely resembling a caterpillar.</p>

<p>Length from head to root of tail 0.7 inches. Length of tail
(or rather gelatinous protuberance) 0.25 inches. Breadth
(broadest part at root of tail) 0.22 inches. Narrowest part (near
head) 0.15 inches. Length of head 0.12 inches.</p>

<p>Head of light red colour, mouth apparent, motion of head like
a caterpillar's when touched, shape cylindrical, body gelatinous,
intestines apparent and full.</p>

<p>November 16. Longitude 102 degrees 40 minutes east; latitude
28 degrees 5 to 6 minutes south.</p>

<p>Since we have passed the 95th parallel of longitude, and 32nd
of latitude up to the present moment we have been out of the
region of birds, for during the whole of this period I have seen
but two, one of which, a Petrel, has this moment visited us. We
have however seen more Sea-jellies, Acalepha and Mollusca than
before, and those of a much more beautiful kind. Thus nature has
made up for the deficiency of one tribe of animals by the
profuseness with which she has distributed another.</p>

<p>November 18. Latitude 26 degrees 57 minutes south; longitude
105 degrees 22 minutes east.</p>

<p>We caught a crustaceous animal (Phyllosoma, see Illustration
11) which was perfectly transparent; it was furnished with twelve
legs on what I considered the hinder part of its body, and four
antennae in front, which have their tips of a bright pink colour,
and two eye peduncles by their side, which terminate in little
bags containing some blue matter (their eyes). It was furnished
also with two legs underneath. These are just shown in the figure
near the centre of the body, and between those underneath the
insect there was a slight projection, with two little lumps on
each side. In this projecting part there appeared to be an
opening. When it was taken out of the water it stood upright on
its legs and crawled a little like a large beetle, but soon died.
In the water it swam with the legs, and the last joint appeared
to be feathered. It will be seen that there is a great
irregularity in the position of the legs of this insect. The
specimen appeared to me to be in some respects imperfect; but I
figured it exactly as it was, without blindly guessing at its
perfect state. It was not thicker than the thinnest wafer. The
back was marked with curved lines, exactly in the manner I have
represented. It shrank instantly when touched. The two last
joints of the long legs were furnished with thorn-like
spikes.</p>

<p><b>11. Phyllosoma, Sp.</b></p>

<p>Length of tail 0.37 inches.<br>
of the body 0.2 inches.<br>
of the thorax and head 0.3 inches.<br>
of the entire animal 1.4 inches.<br>
Breadth of body 0.62 inches.<br>
Ditto of thorax 0.51 inches.<br>
Length of third leg 1.9 inches.<br>
Length of second leg 1.7 inches.<br>
Length of hindermost leg 0.6 inches.<br>
Length of eyes, peduncles 0.4 inches.</p>

<p>We caught a second animal of exactly the same size as the one
figured, but apparently much more perfect. Each of its tentacula
terminates in a small feathering tip when it is in the water,
like the little figures at the side, and by the help of which
they swim; these have a horny feel to the touch, are destitute of
smell, and look like a transparent scale when they lie in your
hand.</p>

<p>We also caught this day some little transparent shells
(Cuvieria) of a cylindrical form, and blunt at the end; they put
out two little fins with which they swam.</p>

<p>I was unfortunately too unwell this day to describe all the
other specimens we caught, which were numerous. The sea was full
of small acalepha, and in the midst of a shoal of these a whale
was seen.</p>

<p>November 19. Latitude 25 degrees 50 minutes south; longitude
106 degrees 22 minutes east.</p>

<p>Birds first re-appeared again. I saw a large flock of two
kinds, but was not near enough to ascertain what they were. I
have before noted the fact that almost at the exact point where
the southern birds of the family Longipennes disappeared those
sea-jellies (acalepha) which have the power of stinging, began to
show themselves; previously to our passing this point I had not
seen one: I saw several however today at no great distance from
this flock of birds.</p>

<p>We saw float by this afternoon one of the acalepha, apparently
about two feet long and shaped generally like a water snake; its
tail had fins like that of an eel, of a purplish tinge; I could
distinctly see its head and various vessels in its interior for
it was quite transparent. We had no net ready but threw a stick
with a piece of string attached to it, the string passed under it
but in pulling up cut through it as though it had been jelly.</p>

<p>Caught an animal (Cymothoa) shaped exactly like a
woodlouse:</p>

<p>Length 0.4 inches.<br>
Length of antennae 0.15 inches.<br>
Breadth of body 0.12 inches.</p>

<p>It had six legs, and a tail-like fin behind on each side, and
nine rings on its back so that it could roll itself almost into a
ball, these rings extended no farther than from its head to
within 0.12 inches of its hinder extremity; colour very pale blue
down the back, bright prussian blue on each side; it crawled
about when taken out of the water, and lived for some time; its
fins, or fin-like legs, when it thus crawled about, were folded
under its tail; eyes distinct.</p>

<p>MOLLUSCA.</p>

<p>November 20. Latitude 25 degrees 14 minutes south; longitude
106 degrees 49 minutes east.</p>

<p><b>9. Janthina exigua.</b></p>
</center>

<p>A shell, Janthina exigua, was caught this evening, 8 hours 30
minutes P.M.; when brought directly out of the water into a room
the temperature of the animal was 80 degrees 5'; of room 76
degrees; colour, dark violet purple over half the opening and
lower part of the shell, so that it gives the animal the
appearance of having been upon a purple-coloured place; this
colour then dies gradually away, and in the smallest whorl of the
shell becomes almost white. They had the power of emitting drops
of a violet colour, and when put into spirits a great quantity of
this issued from the mouth of the shells. We had one evening
before caught a pair of shells of the same species, but much
smaller, at exactly the same hour; in both instances each pair
were caught at the same haul of the net.</p>

<p>November 23. Latitude 21 degrees 43 minutes south; longitude
109 degrees 43 east. 8 1/2 P.M.</p>

<p>FLYING FISH.</p>

<p>A flying-fish (Exocetus) flew on board. Its temperature was 74
degrees. The colour of its iris was black.</p>

<p>Length from mouth to end of curve between forks of tail 10
inches.<br>
From mouth to commencement of wing-like fin 2.7 inches.<br>
Length of wing fin 6.7 inches.<br>
of dorsal fin 2.0 inches.<br>
of pectoral fin 2.2 inches.<br>
of anal fin 1.3 inches.<br>
of upper fork of tail 2.2 inches.<br>
of lower ditto 3.2 inches.<br>
Length from mouth to end of gill 2.2 inches.<br>
Breadth of wing fin 6 inches.<br>
13 spines in each of these wings.<br>
Breadth between eyes 0.11 inches.<br>
Depth of fish 1.6 inches.<br>
Breadth of thickness 1.6 inches.<br>
Diameter of the eye 0.65 inches.</p>

<p>Under-jaw projecting; sides, pale green; back, blackish-green;
belly, white; five first spines in wing fin, greenish; others
white; wing-fin dark green with a transparent band running nearly
up the centre from the back; pectoral fin, transparent, with a
dark green spot, nearly an inch square, about the centre of its
lowest extremity; tail, dark green, edges light.</p>

<p>November 26. Latitude 16 degrees 32 south; longitude 117
degrees east.</p>

<p>After crossing about the 22nd parallel of south latitude we
fairly entered into the region of flying fish, and dolphins as
they are commonly called; tropic birds were now also frequently
seen, which had not up to this moment been the case; we often
also met hereabouts with a dark-coloured bird with bronzed wings,
having a cry precisely like a Snipe. I know not the name of this
bird. The more beautiful and largest Sea-jellies (acalepha) had
now disappeared, although the more minute ones were as numerous
as ever.</p>

<p>REMARKS.</p>

<p>It therefore appears to me that we have, in coming from the
southward to this point, passed through three great regions, or
zones, of animal life, one extending from as far to the southward
as I have yet been, namely 36 degrees south latitude to 31
degrees south latitude; this zone was inhabited by numerous
Sea-jellies (acalepha) of the smaller kind, by porpoises and
whales, as well as by immense varieties of the Petrels or
Procellariae.</p>

<p>The second zone extending from 31 degrees south to 22 degrees
south latitude was inhabited by immense numbers of the larger and
more beautiful kind of Sea-jellies (acalepha) particularly by
those that have the power of stinging. Within this zone I saw but
one whale, one shoal of porpoises, and not a single one of the
long-winged water birds or Petrels; in fact I but once in the
whole of this distance saw any birds; there were also here a
great variety and numbers of Sea-jellies (acalepha) of the
smaller kinds. Do then the larger acalepha in this zone perform
the office of the birds in the more southern one, and prey upon
the smaller species of their own kind?</p>

<p>The third zone is the one with which I have commenced the
journal of this day.</p>

<p>WATER SNAKES.</p>

<p>November 29. Latitude 15 degrees 26 minutes 32 seconds south;
longitude 122 degrees 3 minutes east.</p>

<p>We saw six or seven water snakes (Hydrus) this day, all about
three feet long, of a dirty yellow colour, with black stripes,
the head black, they were furnished with fins like an eel, were
of a very graceful form, and moved on the water exactly like a
snake, with the head a little elevated; when they dived they
turned up on their backs before they sank: we caught one of these
snakes, also a moth and butterfly. A large bat (Pteropus ?) flew
about the vessel this evening and pitched several times on the
boat astern. I once struck it as it passed me, it appeared much
fatigued; we were 150 miles from the main and thirty from the
nearest small sandy island.</p>

<p>SHARKS.</p>

<p>We caught two sharks today; the sailors said that they saw
fourteen or fifteen little sharks swimming round one of these,
and that when the bait was thrown into the water and made a noise
some of these swam into her mouth: directly after they had told
me this the shark was caught. I had it opened and four young ones
were found inside, two had never left the uterus, for they were
attached to it at the time, the other two were not so attached,
and were larger than the former, and swam well and strongly when
put into the water: whether or not they had ever left the mother
I cannot of course say. I have preserved two in spirits, one that
was attached and one that was not; two intestinal worms were
found in the stomach of one of the sharks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 4. HANOVER BAY.</h2>

<p>NEW AND DANGEROUS SHOAL.</p>

<p>November 29.</p>

<p>This morning at twenty minutes after nine, when in latitude 15
degrees 26 minutes 32 seconds and longitude 121 degrees 55 east,
we suddenly made the very unpleasant discovery that we were in
the midst of shoals, owing to some negligence in our lookout.
This was not found out until we were hemmed in between two, one
lying not more than fifty fathoms from our larboard quarter, and
the other about three times the distance on the starboard beam. I
went up to the mast-head, and distinctly saw the rocks, not more
than two or three feet under water on the larboard side. We
fortunately passed through this danger without accident; and,
directly we cleared it, found bottom at twenty-five fathoms,
coarse sand and shells.</p>

<p>RED ISLAND.</p>

<p>December 2.</p>

<p>I was called at four A.M. to keep my watch, and, as soon as I
had ascertained that the men composing it were all present and at
their stations, I went up aloft, and as I anticipated a speck of
land soon appeared above the horizon. This was Red Island. Other
points shortly rose behind it: hill after hill came up into view,
at a distance looking like islands, which indeed many of them
were; but, on a nearer approach, the parts connecting the others
became visible, and the mainland of this vast insular continent
gradually revealed itself to our anxious eyes.</p>

<p>MAKING THE LAND.</p>

<p>We stood on until eleven A.M.; but in making land there always
rests a certain degree of anxiety upon the mind of the seaman and
traveller, more especially when that land is imperfectly known.
As there appeared to be every chance of our losing the
sea-horizon, and consequently our noon observation, if we stood
on and the breeze continued, our course was changed to the other
tack until that hour; and then having correctly ascertained our
position, Red Island bearing south-east by east, distance 8
miles, we once more stood in for the land.</p>

<p>Red Island is small, rocky, and of no great elevation; its
colour is a very dark red; the sides are precipitous, and in its
centre is a clump of trees which cannot be seen until you have
run by the island, as it falls gradually from the south-west to
the north-east, so that the north-east side is the least
elevated. We sounded when about seven miles to the north-west of
it, and found bottom at twenty-five fathoms, of green sandy
mud.</p>

<p>The sandbank laid down on the Admiralty charts to the
north-east of Red Island is small and barren; it is very low, and
at some distance looks like a white rock in the water; being
apparently an island formed of the same rock as the former, and
topped with quartz or white sand. In entering Hanover Bay, or
Port George the Fourth, a good course is to run nearly midway
between this and Red Island. At sunset we anchored off Entrance
Island (Port George the Fourth) in twenty-five fathoms water.</p>

<p>ARRIVAL OFF THE COAST OF AUSTRALIA. ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY FROM
SHIP-BOARD.</p>

<p>At the first streak of dawn I leant over the vessel's side to
gaze upon those shores I had so longed to see. I had not
anticipated that they would present any appearance of inviting
fertility; but I was not altogether prepared to behold so arid
and barren a surface as that which now met my view. In front of
me stood a line of lofty cliffs, occasionally broken by sandy
beaches; on the summits of these cliffs and behind the beaches
rose rocky sandstone hills, very thinly wooded. Whilst I mused on
this prospect, all hands were busied in getting the vessel under
weigh, which was soon accomplished; but there was little or no
wind, and the ship lay almost motionless upon the waters.</p>

<p>LAND AT HIGH BLUFF POINT. WALK TO HANOVER BAY.</p>

<p>By ten o'clock however we were abreast of High Bluff Point
and, as there appeared to be little chance of our having even a
gentle breeze for some time, I determined to land with a party at
the Point, and to walk from thence to Hanover Bay, where on our
arrival we could make a signal to the vessel for a boat to
reconvey us on board. By the adoption of this course I hoped to
be able at once to select a spot affording water and forage, in
the neighbourhood of which the sheep and stores might be landed;
the vessel could then proceed without delay to the Island of
Timor to procure the requisite number of ponies for our
expedition, and, if she made a quick passage there and back, I
trusted, notwithstanding the numerous unforeseen delays that had
arisen, we might yet be able to start for the interior before the
rainy season set in.</p>

<p>LANDING AND DISTRESS FOR WANT OF WATER ON THE ROUTE.</p>

<p>The necessary orders were soon given: the boat was lowered
and, whilst the party prepared themselves, I went below to
arrange with the master the precise spot at which the vessel was
to anchor in order that no mistake might occur upon so vital a
point. This done, I returned once more on deck, and found all
ready for departure.</p>

<p>The party to land consisted of Mr. Lushington, Mr. Walker, and
three men who were selected to accompany us. I also brought away
three of the dogs, to whom I was anxious to give a run after
their long confinement on board.</p>

<p>The shore for which we pulled was not more than half a mile
distant, and we soon gained the edge of a sandy beach, on which I
sprang, eagerly followed by the rest; every eye beaming with
delight and hope, unconscious as we were how soon our trials were
to commence.</p>

<p>DISTRESSING MARCH.</p>

<p>I soon found that we had landed under very unfavourable
circumstances. The sun was intensely hot. The long and close
confinement on board a small vessel had unfitted us all for
taking any violent or continued exercise without some previous
training, and the country in which we had landed was of a more
rocky and precipitous character than any I had ever before seen;
indeed I could not more accurately describe the hills than by
saying that they appeared to be the ruins of hills; composed as
they were of huge blocks of red sandstone, confusedly piled
together in loose disorder, and so overgrown with spinifex and
scrub that the interstices wore completely hidden, and into these
one or other of the party was continually slipping and
falling.</p>

<p>The trees were small, and their foliage so scant and slight
that they afforded no shelter whatever from the burning rays of
the sun; which appeared to strike up again from the sandstone
with redoubled heat, so that it was really painful to touch or to
stand upon a bare rock: we therefore kept moving onwards in the
hope of meeting with some spot favourable for a halting place;
but the difficult nature of the ground which we had to cross
rendered our progress slow and oppressively laborious.</p>

<p>A feeling of thirst and lassitude such as I had never before
experienced soon began to overcome all of us; for such a state of
things we had unfortunately landed quite unprepared, having only
two pints of water with us, a portion of which it was necessary
to give to the dogs; who apparently suffered from the heat in an
equal degree with ourselves. These distressing symptoms I can
only ascribe to the extreme heat of the sun reflected from the
sandstone rocks, and our previous long confinement on board.</p>

<p>LOSS OF OUR THREE DOGS.</p>

<p>Our small supply of water, although but sparingly used, was
soon exhausted; and the symptoms of lassitude, before so
excessive, now became far worse. As usual, the endurance of the
animals gave way before that of the men. We had not completed
more than a mile of our route (although it was far more if the
ascents and descents were taken into account) when Ranger, a very
fine young dog, dropped behind some rocks, and although we turned
back to look for him directly he was missed he could not be
found.</p>

<p>The next to give way was Ringhalz, a fine Cape buck-hound; he
fell amongst the rocks, and died almost instantly. The only dog
now left was a greyhound, who manifested his extreme distress by
constantly lying down. For some time we dragged him along, but he
was at last from necessity abandoned. The cry of water was at
length raised by one of the party, and immediately afterwards we
found ourselves on the edge of a deep ravine, the precipitous
sides of which were composed of nearly horizontal layers of red
sandstone. Down these some of us contrived to scramble, although
not without difficulty; but on reaching the bottom we had the
mortification to find the water salt; and as it would have been
very laborious to follow its course along the bottom of the
ravine over the mud, mangroves, and rocks which filled it, we had
the pleasure of scrambling up again as we best could.</p>

<p>For some short time we remained seated on the edge of the
cliffs above the ravine; but as there was no shelter here from
the sun's rays, and the pangs of thirst were pressing, I roused
the men at last, and moved on again, following the course of the
ravine upwards. We had not walked more than half a mile when the
salt water inlet terminated and the bed of the ravine became
thickly wooded. At the moment we gained this point some white
cockatoos came soaring upwards from beneath our feet; and, as we
knew that this was an infallible sign of the presence of water,
we descended again to renew our search for it.</p>

<p>WATER DISCOVERED.</p>

<p>Our efforts this time were successful: in a few minutes we
found a pool of brackish water which appeared, under the present
circumstances, to afford the most delicious draughts, and, having
drunk, we lay down by the pool to rest ourselves. Being however
doubtful as to which was the best route to lead us out of the
ravine we were now in, I walked up its course, accompanied by
Corporal Coles, leaving the others to rest themselves, and soon
reached its head; when we found ourselves in a small but fertile
valley, surrounded on all sides by rocky hills. Here were many
tracks of natives, and we came upon one of their regular haunts,
where they had arranged a circle of large flat stones round a
fireplace occupying the centre; on each of these stones was laid
a smaller one, evidently used for the purpose of breaking small
shellfish, for the remains of the shells were lying scattered
about in all directions;* kangaroo bones were also plentifully
strewed about, and beside each pair of stones was laid a large
shell, probably used as a drinking cup.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. We found the marks of an encampment of a
tribe of natives. Eight or nine spots were cleared away amongst
the grass, and in the centre of each were the ashes of a small
fire, close to which we noticed some loose flattened stones with
a smaller one lying upon them, which the natives probably used
for the purpose of bruising or grinding the seeds of plants and
breaking shellfish. King's Survey of Australia volume 1 page
302.)</blockquote>

<p>TRACES OF NATIVES. THEIR HUTS.</p>

<p>Natives had been at this spot within the last day or two, and
we followed their traces, which were quite recent, across a dry
watercourse till they led to a hut built of a framework of logs
of wood, and in shape like a beehive, about four feet high and
nine in diameter. This hut was of a very superior description to
those I found afterwards to be generally in use in South-Western
Australia, and differed from them altogether in that its low and
narrow entrance rendered access impossible without stooping; and
with the exception of this aperture the hut was entirely
closed.</p>

<p>PROGRESS TOWARDS HANOVER BAY. ALARMING INCREASING DEBILITY OF
THE MEN. EFFORTS TO REACH THE VESSEL.</p>

<p>Considering that the best route out of these ravines would be
by this valley, I returned with Coles to the party, whom we found
much refreshed and, having consulted with Mr. Lushington as to
the route we should follow to the vessel after reaching the
valley, we once more moved on; but the same symptoms of lassitude
and thirst began very soon again to afflict us in an aggravated
form; probably from the brackish water we had all swallowed. In
less than two hours more these symptoms became so distressing
that I could scarcely induce the men to move, and we therefore
halted under the shade of some high rocks.</p>

<p>It was now growing late, and the nature of the country was so
rocky and difficult that I thought it would be impossible for us
to attempt to march in the night-time; whilst on the other hand
the men seemed so completely worn out that I feared another day
without fresh water would be more than they could bear. I
therefore became anxious to make the sea coast before nightfall,
considering that we could easily walk along the shore after dark
and fire a gun as a signal to the schooner to send a boat for us.
With this view therefore I moved on towards the sea, requesting
Mr. Lushington, when I fired, to follow my course with the
men.</p>

<p>As I walked ahead I found the country very rocky, with lofty
bare pinnacles standing up every here and there in the forest,
one or two of which I climbed, but could see nothing of the
vessel. I now fired a signal shot which, being answered by
another from the party, I knew that they were on my traces, and
again moved on towards the sea. I presently fired again, as I
thought that they might augur favourably from the report, and
continued occasionally to do so until I had reached the
shore.</p>

<p>The cliffs were so steep that I found some difficulty in
descending, but directly I had gained the sea beach I pulled off
my clothes and plunged into the water: the quantity of moisture
taken into the system by absorption as I lay in the sea soon
relieved my burning thirst, and by the time that the first of the
party (Corporal Coles) came up I was quite recovered. He followed
my example and soon began to revive also. The remainder of the
party now arrived with Mr. Lushington, who had found much
difficulty in getting them along. Of his exertions under these
trying circumstances I cannot speak too highly. But for his
persuasion and example I think two of the men were so exhausted
that they would before this have given up in despair.</p>

<p>Corporal Coles being now nearly recovered I left the rest of
the party under Mr. Lushington to follow the plan of refreshing
themselves by immersion in the sea and, as two men appeared to me
to be very ill, I arranged with him that he should keep the whole
together and, as soon as he considered them sufficiently
recovered, they should follow myself and Coles; whilst we
preceded them along the beach for the purpose of sending a boat
back from the Lynher to pick them up.</p>

<p>FURTHER COURSE OBSTRUCTED.</p>

<p>I accordingly started with Coles and had not proceeded more
than a mile when we found two huts (one in ruins and the other
complete) of exactly the same size and form as that which we had
seen in the morning: the recent track of a native along the beach
close to these was also visible. In another half mile our
progress was arrested by an arm of the sea, about four or five
hundred yards across, from which the tide was running out with
fearful rapidity; and on the opposite cliffs we observed a native
watching our movements.</p>

<p>As night was coming rapidly on it was necessary for me to
decide at once what I should do. Coles was unable to swim. If
therefore I crossed the stream it must be alone: to do so with
natives on the opposite bank, of whose intentions towards us we
were entirely ignorant, was not without considerable danger; yet
I was very unwilling to leave the men in such a state of
suffering from thirst when I was so near the schooner, from
whence their wants could be supplied. Whilst I was debating what
to do Coles kept firing his gun in hopes that they might hear the
report on board and send a boat to our relief; in vain however we
strained our ears, the report of Coles's gun was reverberated
from cliff to cliff and from hill to hill, but no answering sound
came back across the tranquil water.</p>

<p>In the meantime I felt more and more anxious about the portion
of the party who were with Mr. Lushington, having left with them
certain orders and promised to send a boat up to them; on which
promise all their further movements would be regulated. The beach
near us afforded no wood wherewith to make a fire as a signal to
the schooner; the cliffs hereabouts were too precipitous to
climb; and it was evident that but very few of the party could
swim so broad a space of water; granting that they ever reached
so far as the point where Coles and myself now were.</p>

<p>SWIM AN INLET OF THE SEA. DANGER IN THE PASSAGE ACROSS AND
AFTER LANDING.</p>

<p>I therefore determined to run all risks, and swim the arm of
the sea which stopped our way.</p>

<p>I directed Coles to wait until the others came up and then to
remain with them until I returned in a boat. From the rugged
nature of the shore I could not have walked a yard without shoes,
so I kept them on, as well as my shirt and military cap, and I
took a pistol in one hand as a means of defence against the
natives, or else to fire it when I reached a spot where it could
be seen or heard from the vessel.</p>

<p>I plunged in and very soon found myself caught in a tideway so
violent that resistance to its force, so as either to get on or
return, appeared at the moment hopeless.* My left hand, in which
I held the pistol, was called into requisition to save my life;
for the stream washed the cap from my head and, the cap then
filling with water, and being carried down by the strong current,
the chin-strap caught round my neck and nearly throttled me as I
dragged it after me through the water; whilst the loose folds of
my shirt, being washed out to seawards by the tide, kept getting
entangled with my arm. I grew weak and faint but still swam my
best, and at last I providentially reached a reef of rocks which
projected from the opposite shore, and to which I clung until I
had somewhat regained my strength.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. I should state that the rise and fall of
tide here is thirty-eight feet.)</blockquote>

<p>DANGER FROM NATIVES.</p>

<p>I then clambered up on the rocks, and from thence made my way
to the beach; but no sooner had I gained it than I heard a native
call from the top of the cliffs, and the answering cries of his
comrades rang through the wood as they followed me along; my
pistol was so thoroughly soaked in my passage across the inlet
that it was quite useless except as a club. To attempt to swim
back again after the narrow escape I had just had would have been
madness; besides which if I had succeeded I should have lost the
object for which I had put my life at hazard. Nothing therefore
was left but to walk along shore to the schooner, trusting, in my
defenceless state, that I might not fall in with any natives. It
was now dark and the shore was so broken and rocky that I got
terribly cut and bruised, and was, moreover, so weak from my
exertions in swimming that when I arrived opposite the vessel I
could scarcely hail. Some of those on board however heard me (as
I found afterwards) and shouted in reply; but their voices never
reached my ears, and I imagined they were too far for I could not
now see the vessel.</p>

<p>I made one or two more efforts to hail the Lynher, but the
noise I made had now attracted the notice of the natives and I
heard their cries in several directions round me; this rendered
my situation an unpleasant one for I was worn out, naked, and
defenceless: at first I thought to return and rejoin my party,
and even turned back for a short distance with this intention,
but I found myself too weak for such an undertaking and changed
my plans; resolving to remain nearly opposite to the vessel until
the morning, and resting my chance of safety upon being
discovered from it before the natives found me.</p>

<p>TAKEN UP BY THE LYNHER'S BOAT.</p>

<p>With this intent I returned to the position from which I had
lately hailed, and crept into a hole in the rocks whence I could
still occasionally hear the calls of the natives; but, being
thoroughly worn out, I soon forgot my toils and dangers in a very
sound and comfortable sleep. I might have slept for some two
hours when I was roused by hearing a voice shout "Mr. Grey;"
still however feeling rather distrustful of the truth of my
mental impressions, and unwilling to betray my whereabouts to the
natives, I returned no answer, but, putting out my head from my
secret place of rest, I waited patiently for a solution of my
doubts. But again I certainly heard the same voice shout "Mr.
Grey," and I moreover now distinctly recognised the noise of oars
working in the rowlocks; I therefore hailed "Lynher, ahoy," and
all my doubts were completely put at rest by the hearty cheers
which greeted my ear as Mr. Smith, the mate of the schooner,
called out, "Where shall we pull in, Sir?"</p>

<p>FORTUNATE DELIVERY AND THE PARTY REGAIN THE LYNHER.</p>

<p>In a few minutes more I was in the boat, and rejoiced to find
all the party safely there before me. My next question was, "Have
you a little water here?" "Plenty, Sir," answered Corporal Cole
as he handed me a little, which I greedily swallowed.</p>

<p>Their adventures were soon related to me. The party under Mr.
Lushington, being on an exposed part of the coast, the flash of
their guns had been seen after dark, and the Captain despatched a
boat from the schooner to pull along shore. This boat first of
all found Coles near where I had quitted him, and he directed
them to the others; the boat, having picked them up, then
returned for Coles, and heard from him the intentions with which
I had attempted to swim the arm of the sea; but as he had never
seen me reach the opposite bank, and the inlet was of very
considerable width, they had, up to the moment of finding me,
felt very serious misgivings as to my fate.</p>

<p>I did not know till afterwards that the water Corporal Coles
had handed to me on entering the boat was all they had on board
when he was picked up, and that, although suffering severely from
thirst, Coles would not touch a drop as long as he retained any
hope that I might be found and be in want of it.</p>

<p>RETURN OF ALL ON BOARD.</p>

<p>We were now however safe again, and as all had borne
themselves well under the difficulties to which they had been
exposed, more particularly Mr. Lushington, to whom the credit is
due of having, by his personal example and influence,
successfully brought on the party to the point of their
embarkation, it was now pleasant to revert to the trials we had
passed, and to recall to one another's recollection each minute
circumstance of our day's adventures; and when we were again on
board and had turned in for the night I could not help feeling a
deep sense of gratitude to that Providence who, in so brief a
space, had preserved me through so many perils.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 5. AT HANOVER BAY.</h2>

<p>PLAGUE OF FLIES.</p>

<p>December 4.</p>

<p>To sleep after sunrise was impossible on account of the number
of flies which kept buzzing about the face. To open our mouths
was dangerous. In they flew, and mysteriously disappeared, to be
rapidly ejected again in a violent fit of coughing; and into the
eyes, when unclosed, they soon found their way and, by inserting
the proboscis and sucking, speedily made them sore; neither were
the nostrils safe from their attacks, which were made
simultaneously on all points, and in multitudes. This was a very
troublesome annoyance, but I afterwards found it to be a very
general one throughout all the unoccupied portions of Australia;
although in general the further north you go in this continent
the more intolerable does the fly nuisance become.</p>

<p>Sunrise offered a very beautiful spectacle; the water was
quite unruffled, but the motion communicated by the tides was so
great that, although there was not a breath of air stirring, the
sea heaved slowly with a grand and majestic motion. On two sides
the view was bounded by lofty cliffs, from three to four hundred
feet high, lightly wooded at their summits, and broken by wide
openings, into which ran arms of the sea, forming gloomy channels
of communication with the interior country; whilst on each side
of their entrances the huge cliffs rose, like the pillars of some
gigantic portal.</p>

<p>In front of us lay a smooth sandy beach, beyond which rose
gradually a high wooded country, and behind us was the sea,
studded with numerous islands of every variety of form.</p>

<p>ENTRANCE TO PRINCE REGENT'S RIVER.</p>

<p>I was too much tired by the fatigues of the night before to
enjoy the scene with the full delight I should otherwise have
done; the bruises I had received made me feel so stiff and sore
that the slightest movement was painful; the rainy season was
however now so near that it would not do to lose a single day of
preparation. Directly after breakfast therefore, whilst one boat
went off to search for fresh water and a convenient spot to land
the stores at, I accompanied the Captain of the vessel in another
up Prince Regent's River.</p>

<p>EFFECT OF TIDES.</p>

<p>In general the openings to these rivers from the sea are very
narrow, forming gorges which terminate in extensive basins, some
fifteen or twenty miles inland; the levels of these reservoirs
are subject to be raised thirty-seven feet by every tide through
their funnel-like entrances, along which the waters consequently
pour with a velocity of which it is difficult to form any
adequate idea. By such a tide were we swept along as we entered
this river by its southern mouth.</p>

<p>On each side of us rose lofty red sandstone cliffs; sometimes
quite precipitous, sometimes, from ancient landslips, shelving
gradually down to the water, and at these points covered with a
dense tropical vegetation.</p>

<p>GREEN ANTS.</p>

<p>At several such places we landed, but always found the ascent
to the interior so covered with large loose rocks that it would
have been impossible to have disembarked stores or stock on any.
The thickness of the vegetation made it difficult to force a way
through, and whenever, in attempting so to do, a tree was shaken,
numbers of a large green sort of ant fell from the boughs on the
unhappy trespasser and, making the best of their way to the back
of his neck, gave warning by a series of most painful bites that
he was encroaching on their domain. Yet it was sometimes
ludicrous to see one of the party momentarily stamping and
roaring with pain, as he cried out to a companion to hasten and
assist him in getting rid of an enemy at once so diminutive and
so troublesome.</p>

<p>PARRAKEETS.</p>

<p>We saw a great number of beautiful parakeets, as well as a
remarkable hawk of a bright cinnamon colour, with a milk-white
head and neck. As there was no apparent probability of our
finding hereabouts a spot suited to land our stock and stores at
we returned in the afternoon to the schooner, and found that the
party in the other boat had been as unsuccessful as
ourselves.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION OF LANDING-PLACE, AND ENCAMPMENT AT HANOVER
BAY.</p>

<p>December 5.</p>

<p>The long-boat was this morning despatched to the ravine where
we had procured water on the first day of our landing to bring a
few casks for immediate use, and to examine the country again in
that direction; whilst I accompanied the Captain to examine the
inlet at which Captain King had watered in his visit to these
parts, in 1821.</p>

<p>WATERING PLACE AT HANOVER BAY.</p>

<p>The approach to this watering-place was through a deep narrow
channel, bounded on each side by high cliffs, against which our
voices echoed and sounded strangely; whilst from the quantity of
light which the cliffs excluded a solemn sombre hue was imparted
to the scene. Channels similar to the main one branched off on
each side; they were however so narrow that the dense vegetation
which grew on their sides nearly met in the centre, giving them
an appearance of dark and refreshing coolness; most of these
terminated in cascades, now dry, but down which the water in the
rainy seasons pours in torrents: at the foot of some of these
cascades were deep cavities, or natural basins, worn in the solid
rock by the falling of the water, and these were still full of
the clearest cool water, in which sported small insects and
animals of kinds quite unknown to me.</p>

<p>As we were swept up the main opening by the tide and
sea-breeze its width gradually contracted, till at last we came
to a small island bearing a single large mangrove tree, which we
named One Tree Island. The shores now became thickly wooded with
mangroves, from the boughs of which depended in clusters small
but well-flavoured oysters, and soon after passing the island we
found our farther progress arrested by large rounded blocks of
sandstone, from amongst which fresh water came pouring in a
hundred little cascades.</p>

<p>BEAUTIFUL RAVINE.</p>

<p>We here quitted the boat to enter a deep and picturesque
ravine, of which the mean breadth was only one hundred and
forty-seven feet, bounded on each side by perpendicular cliffs
from one hundred and fifty to two hundred feet high; in the
centre ran a clear stream, sometimes forming deep and extensive
pools, sometimes divided into innumerable little rills which
gurgled along through a dense and matted vegetation; and bordered
on each side of the main bed by a lofty species of Eucalyptus,
with a bark resembling layers of coarse white paper, and a
foliage pendant and graceful; whilst the great height of these
trees for they raised their heads above the cliffs, contrasted
strangely with the narrowness of the ravine in which they grew.
The space between these trees and the cliffs was filled by a
dense forest, principally composed of the Pandanus and wild
nutmeg trees. Rich grasses and climbing plants occupied the
interval and twined around the trees, whilst parakeets of the
most vivid colours filled the wood with their cries. Nothing
could be more striking than this singular and novel scene; and we
were all delighted as we wound our way up the beautiful
ravine.</p>

<p>The same character continued for the next mile or two, whilst
occasionally branch valleys of similar character ran off from a
main one, giving it at these points a much greater width. The
summit of the cliffs was found to be generally a rocky sandy
tableland, thinly wooded; and from what I had seen it appeared to
me that I was not likely to find a place better adapted for
landing the stores than the main ravine.</p>

<p>On embarking to return we could perceive no sign of One Tree
Island; and as we swept down towards the sea the leafy top of a
tree seen in the clear water under the boat was the only evidence
of its existence; though a few hours ago it had formed so
prominent an object.</p>

<p>FATE OF TWO OF THE DOGS.</p>

<p>The long-boat returned to the vessel half an hour after us and
brought eighty gallons of water; but the spot whence it was
obtained had been found very inconvenient for the purpose. At the
waterhole they had met Ranger, the dog we lost the first day; but
he appeared quite mad, and without recognising any of them ran
wildly away into the woods. The body of poor Ringhalz was also
found, who had died on the spot where he fell.</p>

<p>LABOUR OF DISEMBARKING STORES.</p>

<p>December 6.</p>

<p>A party landed with me soon after dawn at the same point as
yesterday, for the purpose of selecting the spot at which to fix
our temporary encampment. We traced the valley for about four
miles through scenery precisely similar to that which we had
found before; many branch valleys ran of from the main one and
differed from it in no other respect but that they were much
narrower. The most favourable spot I could find for our purpose
was distant about half a mile from the landing-place and situated
at the junction of two valleys, upon a neck of land which ran out
from the base of the cliffs. This was the nearest point to the
sea at which we should have been safe from any sudden inundation;
it combined, moreover, the advantages of affording a good supply
of food and water for the stock, of not being within reach of
missiles thrown from the cliffs, and at the same time of being
situated close to an easy ascent to their summit. I should have
preferred pitching the encampment on the tableland at the top,
but the labour of carrying the stores up so precipitous an ascent
would have been too great for the men, and would have delayed our
movements for a longer time than I thought prudent.</p>

<p>PREPARATIONS FOR ENCAMPING.</p>

<p>Having selected the point for our encampment the next task was
to form a pathway to and from the landing-place; and this, on
account of the rocky, broken nature of the ground, was one of no
slight difficulty. We first set fire to the bush, and being thus
enabled to see our way a little we commenced moving the rocks and
stones, and continued this operation until near sunset, when we
returned on board.</p>

<p>NATIVES SEEN.</p>

<p>December 7.</p>

<p>We landed again early this morning and went on working at the
pathway. The men dined on shore at noon, about which time it was
nearly low-water. We had repeatedly seen footmarks of the natives
in the mud, and this probably was a favourite fishing resort of
theirs, for this day they came upon the cliffs over our heads and
shouted at us, as if to try and frighten us away. Finding however
that this produced no effect, they threw down some large stones
at us and then decamped.</p>

<p>In the course of the night (2 A.M.) we had one of those sudden
heavy squalls from off the land which are so common on this
coast. I slept on deck and was called to hear a loud roaring on
the shore: this was evidently the noise of a rushing wind, which
gradually drew nearer and nearer and at last reached us,
accompanied by lightning, thunder, and heavy rain; it did not
however last for more than twenty minutes, and we received no
damage from it.</p>

<p>December 8.</p>

<p>Whilst the party continued the pathway I landed on the sandy
beach and explored the interior of the country for several miles.
We found but very little fresh water and the country was
dreadfully burnt up; the heavy rain which had fallen last night
however gave signs of the approach of the wet season. We passed
several dry watercourses, in many of which we dug for it, but all
that we obtained was brackish. We had another squall this
afternoon, similar to last night's.</p>

<p>LANDING STOCK. LABOUR IN LANDING STORES.</p>

<p>December 9.</p>

<p>This day we pitched the tents, disembarked the sheep and
goats, and some of the stores. It was no slight pleasure to see
for the first time those animals landed on a new country, and
they appeared themselves to rejoice in their escape from the
close confinement on shipboard.</p>

<p>We here first hoisted the British flag, and went through the
ceremony of taking possession of the territory in the name of Her
Majesty and her heirs for ever.</p>

<p>The next few days were passed in moving the stores from the
landing-place to the tent; as it was necessary that before I
allowed the schooner to start we should be amply provided with
all necessaries so as to be able to maintain ourselves for some
time, in the event of anything happening to the vessel: this was
very fatiguing work for the whole party but they all exerted
themselves with the most strenuous energy, especially Mr.
Lushington; and our labours were varied by several amusing
novelties which relieved the monotony of the employment.</p>

<p>REMARKABLE FISHES.</p>

<p>Sometimes as we sat at our dinner near the landing-place we
watched a strange species of fish (genus Chironectes, Cuvier).
These little animals are provided with arms, at least with
members shaped like such as far as the elbow, but the lower part
resembles a fin; they are amphibious, living equally well on the
mud or in the water; in moving in the mud they walk, as it were,
on their elbows, and the lower arm or fin then projects like a
great splay foot; but in swimming the whole of this apparatus is
used as a fin. They have also the property of being able to bury
themselves almost instantaneously in the soft mud when disturbed.
The uncouth gambols and leaps of these anomalous creatures were
very singular.</p>

<p>Another remarkable fish was a species of mullet which, being
left by the retreat of the high tides in the pools beyond the
rounded rocks at the head of the landing-place, was obliged to
change its element from salt to fresh water, which by a very
remarkable habit it appeared to do without suffering any
inconvenience. The natural hue of this fish was a very pale red,
but when they had been for some time in the fresh water this
reddish tinge became much deeper, and when of this colour I have
found them in streams a considerable distance from the sea, as
if, like our salmon, they had quitted it for the purpose of
spawning. Indeed birds, insects, and all things we saw, were so
new and singular that our attention was kept constantly excited
by the varied objects which passed before us.</p>

<p>December 11.</p>

<p>I went on board in the morning for the purpose of preparing my
letters, and about 10 A.M. it was reported to me that a party of
natives had come down to one of the sandy beaches and were
fishing there. I immediately went upon deck and saw four natives
in the sea opposite to the beach, running about and fishing.
Captain Browne went on shore at once with me to try and parley
with them, but as we approached the land they ran away; we
remained for some time on the beach and tried to follow their
tracks up into the country, but could see nothing more of
them.</p>

<p>This night at 8 P.M. we had another sudden squall from off the
land, accompanied with thunder, lightning, and heavy rain; it
blew so hard that we were obliged to let go the best bower
anchor, but as usual it only lasted twenty minutes.</p>

<p>PREPARATIONS FOR SENDING THE VESSEL TO TIMOR.</p>

<p>As Mr. Lushington was to accompany the schooner to Timor, and
I was anxious to ascertain which would be the best direction for
us to move off in on his return, I determined to commence my
exploring trips as soon as possible. All hands still continued
busily engaged in landing the stores and conveying them to the
tents; but though the men worked hard our progress was slow.
Everything had to be carried on the men's shoulders, for the
path, after the great trouble and labour we had bestowed on it,
was still so intricate and rocky that it was impossible to use
even a hand-barrow. The intense heat of the sun, too, incommoded
the men very much at first; but by the 16th of December all the
stores were landed, and a considerable supply of water was taken
off to the vessel. I determined therefore now to start in my
first exploring excursion, leaving to Mr. Lushington the task of
seeing the watering of the schooner completed before he left for
Timor.</p>

<p><a name="chapter6"></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER 6. HANOVER BAY AND ITS VICINITY.</h2>

<p>NATIVES SEEN.</p>

<p>Sunday December 17.</p>

<p>This morning directly after breakfast I read prayers to the
men, and then commenced my preparations for the excursion on
which I intended to start in the evening. Whilst I was occupied
in arranging my papers Mr. Lushington observed two natives
sitting on the rocks on the top of the cliffs which overlooked
the valley, and gazing down intently on us. The instant that he
made friendly signs to them they rose from their seats and began
to retreat. Some of the party then called to them and one of the
natives answered; but they still moved rapidly away. I would not
allow them to be followed for fear of increasing their alarm, and
in the hope that they would return, but was disappointed. It must
have awakened strange feelings in the breast of these two
savages, who could never before have seen civilized man, thus to
have sat spectators and overlookers of the every action of such
incomprehensible beings as we must have appeared; and the
relation to their comrades of the wonders they had witnessed
could not have been to them a whit less marvellous than the tales
of the grey-headed Irish peasant, when he recounts the freaks of
the fairies, "whose midnight revels by the forest side or
fountain" he has watched intently from some shrub-clad hill.</p>

<p>COMMENCEMENT OF FIRST EXCURSION.</p>

<p>I started in the evening, accompanied by Corporal John Coles
and Private R. Mustard, both of the corps of Royal Sappers and
Miners, and for a short distance by two or three others of the
party from the camp. We moved up the ravine in which we were
encamped in a nearly due south direction, and after following
this course about a mile turned up a branch ravine to the left,
bearing 87 degrees from the north.</p>

<p>CHARACTER OF THE SCENERY. GEOLOGICAL PHENOMENA.</p>

<p>The romantic scenery of this narrow glen could not be
surpassed. Its width at bottom was not more than forty or fifty
feet, on each side rose cliffs of sandstone between three and
four hundred feet high and nearly perpendicular; lofty paper-bark
trees grew here and there, and down the middle ran a beautiful
stream of clear, cool water, which now gushed along, a murmuring
mountain torrent, and anon formed a series of small cascades. As
we ascended higher the width contracted; the paper-bark trees
disappeared; and the bottom of the valley became thickly wooded
with wild nutmeg and other fragrant trees. Cockatoos soared, with
hoarse screams, above us, many-coloured parakeets darted away,
filling the woods with their playful cries, and the large white
pigeons which feed on the wild nutmegs cooed loudly to their
mates, and battered the boughs with their wings as they flew
away.</p>

<p>The spot I chose to halt at for the night was at the foot of a
lofty precipice of rocks, from which a spring gushed forth. Those
who had accompanied us from the camp now returned, leaving me and
the two soldiers alone and about to penetrate some distance into
an utterly unknown country. We were each provided with ten days'
provisions and, confident in the steadiness and courage of my
men, I had not the slightest anxiety--feeling that as long as we
maintained a cool and determined bearing the natives would make
no attacks upon us that we could not repel.</p>

<p>We soon erected a little hut of bark, then kindled a fire and
cooked our supper, consisting of tea and two white pigeons which
we had shot; and by the time our repast was finished it was
nearly dark. My companions laid down to sleep: I remained up for
a short time to think alone in the wilderness, and then followed
their example.</p>

<p>ASCENT OF A GLEN.</p>

<p>December 18.</p>

<p>At break of day we were again upon our route, which lay up the
valley we had slept in; but, as each of us carried ten days'
provisions and a day's water, besides our arms, the progress we
made in a tropical climate, when thus laden, was necessarily slow
and laborious; but the beauty of the landscape and the solicitude
we all felt to see more of this unexplored land cheered us
on.</p>

<p>TABLELAND AT THE SUMMIT.</p>

<p>Having at length reached the tableland which this valley
drained we found ourselves in the midst of a forest, differing
widely from anything we had before seen. The soil beneath our
feet was sandy and thickly clothed with spinifex (a prickly
grass) which in spite of our thick trousers slightly but
continually wounded our legs. The trees were lofty and some of
them of considerable circumference; but the trunks of all were
charred and blackened by constant fires: this circumstance, and
their slight and thin, yet strikingly graceful foliage, gave them
a most picturesque appearance.</p>

<p>Every here and there in the wood rose lofty and isolated
pinnacles of sandstone rock, fantastic in form, and frequently
overgrown with graceful creeping and climbing plants which
imparted to them a somewhat of mystery and elegance. In other
parts rose the gigantic ant-hills so much spoken of by former
visitors of these shores; and in the distance we saw occasionally
the forms of the timid kangaroos, who stole fearfully away from
the unknown disturbers of their solitude.</p>

<p>ANOTHER VALLEY.</p>

<p>But when we arrived at the extremity of the tableland I felt
somewhat disappointed at beholding a deep narrow ravine at my
feet, precisely resembling in character the one we had left, and
beyond this a second sandstone range, wooded as that on which we
stood; in about half an hour we gained the bottom of the ravine
and found that a rapid stream ran through it, which, being the
first we had discovered, I named the Lushington, after the father
of my associate in this expedition, and in accordance with a
determination I had made before starting.</p>

<p>Mustard (one of the men with me) being ill, I determined to
halt here for breakfast and, having completed this meal, I was
sorry to find that he was still too unwell to proceed; such
however being the case I was compelled to halt for the day:
leaving Coles therefore to take care of him, I strolled off to
explore the valley alone. Except in being much larger it differed
in no respect from the first in which we encamped, and I found
that within about half a mile below the spot where I had left the
men it terminated in a salt-water inlet, nearly choked up with
mangroves. On returning to them I found Mustard somewhat better;
to our annoyance however heavy rain set in, accompanied by
thunder and lightning; and as we had no shelter but what some
overhanging rocks afforded us we passed a very uncomfortable
night.</p>

<p>December 19.</p>

<p>Mustard was still not quite well; we therefore started late
and travelled slowly, keeping nearly in a south-east direction.
We thus gradually ascended the second sandstone range, the summit
of which was a tableland, at this point about half a mile
wide.</p>

<p>GEOLOGICAL PHENOMENA.</p>

<p>We here remarked a very curious circumstance. Several acres of
land on this elevated position were nearly covered with lofty
isolated sandstone pillars of the most grotesque and fantastic
shapes, from which the imagination might easily have pictured to
itself forms equally singular and amusing. In one place was a
regular unroofed aisle, with a row of massive pillars on each
side; and in another there stood upon a pedestal what appeared to
be the legs of an ancient statue, from which the body had been
knocked away.</p>

<p>Some of these time-worn columns were covered with
sweet-smelling creepers, while their bases were concealed by a
dense vegetation, which added much to their very singular
appearance. The height of two or three which I measured was
upwards of forty feet; and, as the tops of all of them were
nearly upon the same level, that of the surrounding country must
at one period have been as high as their present summits,
probably much higher.</p>

<p>From the top of one of these pillars I surveyed the
surrounding country and saw on every side proofs of the same
extensive degradation--so extensive, indeed, that I found it very
difficult to account for; but the gurgling of water, which I
heard beneath me, soon put an end to the state of perplexity in
which I was involved, for I ascertained that streams were running
in the earth beneath my feet; and, on descending and creeping
into a fissure in the rocks, I found beneath the surface a cavern
precisely resembling the remains that existed above ground, only
that this was roofed, whilst through it ran a small stream which
in the rainy season must become a perfect torrent. It was now
evident to me that ere many years had elapsed the roof would give
way, and what now were the buttresses of dark and gloomy caverns
would emerge into day and become columns clad in green, and
resplendent in the bright sunshine.</p>

<p>GRADUAL DEGRADATION OF THE LAND.</p>

<p>In this state they would gradually waste away beneath the
ever-during influence of atmospheric causes, and the material
being then carried down by the streams, through a series of
caverns resembling those of which they once formed a portion,
would be swept out into the ocean and deposited on sandbanks, to
be raised again, at some remote epoch, a new continent, built up
with the ruins of an ancient world.</p>

<p>I subsequently, during the season of the heavy rains, remarked
the usual character of the mountain streams to be that they rose
at the foot of some little elevation which stood upon a lofty
tableland composed of sandstone, then flowed in a sandy bed for a
short distance and afterwards mysteriously sank in the cracks and
crevices made in the rocks from atmospheric influences, and did
not again reappear until they had reached the foot of the
precipice which terminated the tableland whence they sprang; here
they came foaming out in a rapid stream which had undoubtedly
worked strange havoc in the porous sandstone rocks among which it
held its subterraneous course.</p>

<p>What the amount of sand annually carried down from the
north-western portion of Australia into the ocean may be we have
no means whatever of ascertaining; that it is sufficient to form
beds of sand of very great magnitude is attested by the existence
of numerous and extensive sandbanks all along the coast. One
single heavy tropical shower of only a few hours' duration washed
down, over a plot of ground which was planted with barley, a bed
of sand nearly five inches deep, which the succeeding showers
again swept off, carrying it further upon its way towards the
sea.</p>

<p>The space of ground covered with these columns gradually
contracted its dimensions as we proceeded; the columns themselves
became nearer and nearer to each other until they at length
formed walls of cliffs on each side of us, and we finally reached
a point where a single lofty pillar, standing in front of a dry
cascade, formed the centre of an amphitheatre of sandstone. There
was some water in a little natural basin at the base of the
cliffs. I determined therefore to halt here for breakfast and,
leaving the men at the foot of the cascade to prepare some tea, I
clambered to its summit, and found myself on another tableland
similar to that which I had just left, and covered in the same
manner with natural columns.</p>

<p>SANDSTONE CAVERNS.</p>

<p>Some distance from the top of the cascade I discovered a
cavern, or rather huge hole in the water-course, into which,
thinking it might contain fossil bones, I descended as far as the
first ledge, and I then perceived that the water pouring through
this cavern in the rainy season was cutting off another rock of
sandstone similar to the remarkable pillar in front of the
cascade. The water in the basin below must have filtered out from
this cavern. On a further examination I found that a precisely
similar series of operations was going on throughout the whole
amphitheatre of cliffs which bounded the tableland we had been
traversing during the morning.</p>

<p>In the rainy season (March 7th) I again passed this spot and
found the watercourse full of water, which was also falling
abundantly from the cascade. From this circumstance I inferred
that the subterraneous outlets for the water were all filled,
consequently the large body which these caverns would contain
must have been then endeavouring to force its way through the
fissures in the porous sandstone rocks.</p>

<p>CONTINUATION OF ROUTE. HALT IN A VALLEY.</p>

<p>After breakfast we continued on our route through a sandstone
country precisely resembling the one which I have now described,
and in the course of the day, having completed fifteen miles in a
straight line, we halted for the night in a fertile valley
affording plenty of fresh water, and so densely wooded with the
dwarf pandanus and other prickly trees that we could scarcely
make our way through the underwood. In this valley we saw several
sorts of cranes, principally Ardea antigone, and Ardea
scolopacia, and I shot one of the former kind and laid it by,
intending to eat it in the morning. We could not find any holes
in the rocks large enough to protect us from the rain, which fell
throughout the night, accompanied by thunder and lightning.</p>

<p>December 20.</p>

<p>Just as we turned out this morning a large kangaroo came close
to us to drink at a waterhole; the effect as it stole along
through the thick bushes in the morning twilight was very
striking. I could not succeed in getting a shot at it; but, as I
was determined to have a meat breakfast, I desired Mustard to
cook the crane, the rats however had eaten the greater part of
it; we therefore at once moved on and, after travelling four
miles in a south-east direction over good land, we reached a
valley, the largest and best I had yet seen, containing trees and
birds such as we had not before met with; kangaroos were more
plentiful, and, for the first time, we saw the opossum. The
valley was more than a mile in width at the point where we first
made it, and we had but just time to cross it and to gain the
partial shelter of some rocks when heavy rain again set in. We
could keep no fire and, being soon wet through, passed a wretched
night.</p>

<p>December 21.</p>

<p>We all today began to feel the want of food; since Sunday
night we had subsisted on nothing but rice and tea, and only in
very small quantities at a time, as the heavy rain had materially
interrupted our cooking. As there was plenty of game in this
valley I determined to halt for a day previously to my return to
the party, for the double purpose of exploring the valley and of
shooting game.</p>

<p>CUCKOO-PHEASANT.</p>

<p>The large bird which was the most abundant here was the
Cuculus phasianus or pheasant cuckoo. This bird in colour, in
length of tail, in its size, and general appearance so closely
resembles the hen pheasant of England that, when it is on the
wing, it is almost impossible to tell the difference; its habits
and food are also identical with that of the English pheasant.
The chief point of distinction is that its toes point two before
and two behind, in the same manner as those of a parrot; but what
is very remarkable about this bird is that, although, like the
other Scansores, it delights in climbing and running up trees, it
is equally fond of running along the ground in the manner a
pheasant does.</p>

<p>SPORTING.</p>

<p>This day I found plenty of these birds in a cover of long dry
grass and bushes about half my height. From this kind of ground I
descended to deep lagoons in the bottoms, with rushes, reeds, and
dense tropical vegetation around them, amongst which the bamboo
and pandanus bore a conspicuous figure; as I beat this cover the
pheasants, with their whirring noise, rose on all sides of me,
and my Westley Richards was kept in constant operation. I never
enjoyed a better day's pheasant shooting in any preserve in
England; and I may here remark that North-Western Australia is as
good a country for sport in the shooting way as I am acquainted
with; whilst for every kind of sport except wild-fowl shooting
the southern part of Australia is the worst country in the world.
My bag being full, and my companions very hungry, I had no excuse
for staying longer away from them, and therefore returned,
although very loth to leave such beautiful scenery and such
excellent sport.</p>

<p>FERTILE COUNTRY DESCRIED.</p>

<p>In the interval between the showers, and whilst the men were
trying to kindle a fire, I ascended a sandstone range under the
shelter of some rocks near the summit of which we were encamped;
from this elevated position I saw a far better country to the
south of us than any we had yet traversed; and the prospect was
so cheering in this direction that I felt assured, when it was
once gained with the horses, we should be able to travel on with
comparative rapidity and facility.</p>

<p>NATIVE HAUNTS.</p>

<p>Having emptied my bag I started again to commence the
exploration of the valley we were in. It sloped first in a
north-easterly and then in a nearly easterly direction; the river
that ran through it was in some places almost dry, or was rather
a chain of large ponds than a river, several of these ponds being
more than a hundred yards across. I followed the valley down for
about five miles in the direction of Prince Regent's River and
found to my surprise that this part was by no means thinly
inhabited by natives; still, as none of the traces I had yet seen
were very recent, I trusted that we should not fall in with any
considerable body.</p>

<p>TRACES OF NATIVES.</p>

<p>At length however I came upon a spot which a number of them
appeared to have quitted only an hour or two before, and where
they had been sitting under a large tree at the edge of one of
these ponds; their recent fire had been first slaked with water
and sand then thrown over it. I knew therefore that they had been
disturbed, and most probably by my gun; but not before they had
made a hearty meal of roasted fresh-water mussels (unios) and
nuts of a kind which grew on a large shady tree in pods, like a
tamarind pod, the kernel being contained in a shell, of which
each pod held several, and the fruit tasting exactly like
filberts. The spot was admirably suited for their purpose; their
bark beds were placed under the shelter of this tree and only a
few yards distant from the pond, which contained abundance of
large unios.</p>

<p>ATTACK OF NATIVES.</p>

<p>I sat down under the nut tree to consider what was my best
plan to adopt. From the signs around us the natives were
evidently much more numerous than I had expected: in the event of
anything happening to one of the three our return to the main
party might be considerably impeded, if not altogether prevented;
and although, from the superiority of our weapons over theirs, I
entertained but little doubt as to the issue of any contest we
might be forced into, the calls of humanity as well is of
personal interest warned me to do my utmost to avoid an
affray.</p>

<p>RETURN TOWARDS HANOVER BAY.</p>

<p>I returned therefore to the party and, having made our dinner
from pheasant soup and birds which had been first split in two
and then nicely roasted on the ashes, we commenced our journey
homewards, cautiously and circumspectly, that we might run no
risk of being surprised. Until the evening began to close upon us
we pursued our route through scenery similar to that we had
passed the day before, our course laying several miles to the
northward of our former track; and when we halted for the night I
carefully chose a good position and, mentioning my apprehensions
concerning the natives to the men in such a way as to put them on
their guard without exciting their alarm, we bivouacked for the
night. Soon after sunset the thunderstorms of the previous
evening were renewed, accompanied by tremendous rain. This was
unfortunate as it rendered it nearly impossible for us to keep
our arms in an efficient state.</p>

<p>December 22.</p>

<p>After passing a wretched and uncomfortable night we started
before dawn, pursuing a direction about west by north, and passed
one of the openings from Prince Regent's River laid down in
Captain King's chart, and there left without a termination, which
I had thus an opportunity of fixing. Having completed about six
miles I halted for breakfast. No signs whatever of the natives
had been again seen; this restored my confidence and, as the sun
was intensely hot and we were much fatigued, we lay about in
rather a careless and imprudent way. Fortunately the gathering
clouds prognosticated that we should soon have rain; and, as we
could get no good shelter where we were, I ordered the men to
move on: we had just gained the top of the range when a violent
storm of rain overtook us, I therefore doubled back about a
hundred yards to the left of our former track to gain some rocks
forming a portion of a detached group upon a tableland, and which
I had observed as we passed them.</p>

<p>ATTACKED BY NATIVES.</p>

<p>Scarcely had we reached these rocks, and sheltered ourselves
under the overhanging projections, when I saw a savage advancing
with a spear in his right hand, and a bundle of similar weapons
in his left; he was followed by a party of thirteen others, and
with them was a small dog not of the kind common to this country.
The men were curiously painted for war, red being the predominant
colour, and each man carried several spears, a rowing stick, and
a club. Their chief was in front, and distinguished by his hair
being of a dark red colour from some composition with which it
was smeared; the others followed him close, noiselessly, and with
stealthy pace, one by one, whilst he, crouching almost to the
earth, pricked off our trail.</p>

<p>We remained concealed and motionless until they had all
passed, but the moment they came to where we had turned off they
discovered our retreat, and raised loud shouts of triumph, as,
forming themselves into a semicircle, they advanced upon us,
brandishing their spears and bounding from rock to rock. It was
in vain that I made friendly signs and gestures, they still
closed upon us, and to my surprise I heard their war-cry answered
by a party who were coming over the high rocks in our rear, which
I had flattered myself protected us in that direction.</p>

Place.</b></p>
</center>

<p>Our situation was now so critical that I was compelled to
assume a hostile attitude. I therefore shouted in answer to their
cries and, desiring the men to fire one at a time if I gave the
word, I advanced rapidly, at the same time firing one barrel over
their heads. This had the desired effect. With the exception of
one more resolute than the rest they fled on all sides, and he,
finding his efforts unavailing, soon followed their example.</p>

<p>RETURN TO THE ENCAMPMENT. HANOVER BAY.</p>

<p>Feeling however that the neighbourhood we were in was a
dangerous one, and being anxious to know whether the party I had
left at the encampment--only six in number--had seen these
natives, I hurried our march, although the rain fell in torrents
all day; and we that night made the camp.</p>

<p>PROCEEDINGS THERE DURING MY ABSENCE.</p>

<p>I found the party all in good health and spirits: they had
seen nothing whatever of the natives during my absence. The
sailing of the Lynher had been unfortunately delayed until the
21st of December. On the 18th and 19th the tides had been so low
that, although Mr. Lushington had done his utmost, the schooner
made little or no progress in her watering. On the 20th the crew
and whole party were employed; yet they only succeeded in getting
off 280 gallons for they were obliged to carry the water in small
baricos to the boat, over slippery rocks and deep mud: and on the
21st, thinking it better to complete their water at Timor, they
set sail. This difficulty of watering only arose from the lowness
of the tides (neap) and our ignorance of the country.
Subsequently we found no difficulty in procuring it; indeed no
country in the world is better watered than this portion of
Australia.</p>

<p>Since the sailing of the Lynher the party had been actively
engaged in building a shed for the stores. This labour was still
continued, after my arrival, and completed on Christmas eve.</p>

<p>CHRISTMAS DINNER.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day we all dined together in a little booth made
of boughs, which we dressed up as gaily as we could. I could not
but feel considerable pleasure in seeing the happy countenances
of the men ranged round the rough plank that formed our table. We
sat down, a little band of nine, bound upon an adventure of which
the issue to any and all of us was very uncertain: yet no
forebodings appeared to damp the pleasure of the present moment;
and as I anxiously looked round I could not detect the slightest
trace of a gloomy thought in any of the cheerful faces that
surrounded me. After dinner we drank the Queen's health, the
first time such a toast had been given in these regions; and
then, Mr. Walker and myself retiring to talk alone, left the rest
to their own amusements.</p>

<p>1838.</p>

<p>PLANTING USEFUL SEEDS.</p>

<p>The interval between that and New Year's Day found and left us
full of occupation. On this latter day I had resolved to do
homage to the country by a seasonable gift; and therefore, rising
with the earliest dawn, spent the whole day in planting, in
various positions, seeds of the most useful fruits and
vegetables. Those we had already planted were doing well, and I
hoped that this benefaction might prove one of no small value,
perhaps to civilized man, or at least to the natives of the
vicinity.</p>

<p>WALK TO MUNSTER WATER.</p>

<p>January 4.</p>

<p>A party of us this day walked to Hanover Bay for the purpose
of making some observations on the sandy beach there, after which
we went over to Prince Regent's River, near Munster Water. The
country until near the bank of the river at this point was of the
same sandy nature as that about the beach: there however it
improves; and from the circumstance of my finding a regular haunt
of the natives I feel sure that there is plenty of fresh water in
the neighbourhood. This place of their sojourn resembled one
before described, and many others I had seen. An extensive circle
was formed by laying a large flat stone upon the ground, and on
each of these a smaller one; between the two they evidently
crushed the shellfish and nuts which formed their food. Near some
of the stones were laid huge shells for the purpose of drinking
from; and in the centre of the circle were the marks of frequent
fires. We heard the natives calling to one another in the woods,
but saw none of them; and in the evening returned to our
encampment.</p>

<p>ISTHMUS NEAR HANOVER BAY.</p>

<p>January 6.</p>

<p>I made an excursion this day for the purpose of examining the
land lying between Port George the Fourth and Hanover Bay: it
consists of a low neck which connects the peninsula terminating
in High Bluff Point with the main. Thus it is bounded on two
sides by the sea, and on the other two by rocky hills which are
perfectly precipitous, both towards the main and the peninsula;
but a natural terrace runs along under the cliff in the direction
of Camden Sound, which I believe would form a good road to that
harbour. The tract thus enclosed appears to be very fertile.
Porphyry and basalt are the common rocks. The soil is rich
vegetable mould, mixed with gravel and covered with the most
luxuriant grass. The trees were in general small. We only found
three springs here; these however were sufficient to prove that
it was well supplied in this respect. A species of plant was
observed here, which in appearance and smell exactly resembled
the jasmine of England: and it would be difficult to give any
adequate impression of the singular sensation of pleasure derived
from the sight of this simple emblem of home. Here were regular
beaten tracks of the natives, as completely pathways as those we
find in England leading from a village to a farmhouse.</p>

<p>HILL OF SHELLS.</p>

<p>Near the sea we also came upon a complete hill of broken
shells, which it must have taken some centuries to form, for it
covered nearly, if not quite, half an acre of ground, and in some
places was ten feet high: it was situated just over a bed of
cockles, and was evidently formed from the remains of native
feasts, as their fireplaces, and the last small heaps of shells
were visible on the summit of the hill.* This neck of land is
undoubtedly of the first importance; for, lying as it does
between Port George the Fourth and Hanover Bay, it commands two
excellent harbours, and its soil is moreover highly fertile. I
conceive that a point nearer Camden Bay would be of greater
consequence to the mother country; but, after such a spot, this
neck of land is the most important position on the North-west
coast of Australia.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. A similar mass of shells, though of
smaller dimensions, is spoken of by Captain King, at Port
Essington: A curious mound, constructed entirely of shells,
rudely heaped together, measuring thirty feet in diameter, and
fourteen feet high, was also noticed near the beach, and was
supposed to be a burying-place of the Indians. King's Australia
volume 1 page 87.)</blockquote>

<p>For some days after our return from this excursion all hands
were occupied in drying the stores, which had suffered a little
from the late rains; in planting barley and potatoes; and in a
variety of occupations of the same nature.</p>

<p>EXCURSION TO COUNTRY ABOUT PRINCE REGENT'S RIVER.</p>

<p>As all the necessary magnetic and astronomical observations
were now completed I seized the opportunity offered by the first
favourable day and started with a party of three in the direction
of Prince Regent's River.</p>

<p>We made the river about Halfway Bay, and then followed its
course, keeping about a mile or two inland. A considerable
portion of the land in the neighbourhood of the river was most
excellent, consisting of rich meadow plains. The general
proportion of good country compared with the bad was still
however but small.</p>

<p>GOUTY-STEMMED TREES.</p>

<p>There was a very remarkable feature in the appearance of this
part of the country, caused by the number of gouty stemmed trees
(a species of Capparis ?) These trees grow to a considerable
height, and had the appearance of suffering from some disease,
but, from the circumstance of all of them being affected in the
same way, this was undoubtedly their natural state. I measured
one of the largest I here saw, and found that at eighteen inches
above the ground its circumference was about twenty-eight feet
six inches.</p>

<p>The foliage of this tree was slight but graceful, and it was
loaded with a fruit of an elliptical form, as large as a coconut.
This fruit was enclosed in a rind, closely resembling that of the
almond, and inside the rind was a shell containing a soft white
pulp, in which were placed a species of almond, very palatable to
the taste, and arranged in this pulp much in the manner in which
the seeds are placed in the pomegranate. Upon the bark of these
trees being cut they yielded in small quantities a nutritious
white gum, which both in taste and appearance resembles macaroni;
and upon this bark being soaked in hot water an agreeable
mucilaginous drink was produced.</p>

<p>This tree is, from this combination of useful qualities, a
vegetable production of no slight value, and probably comes near
the cocoa-nut tree in value. Its worth is well known to the
natives for its vicinity is one of their favourite haunts. Around
nearly all of them I have found marks of their fires, and on many
of these trees were several successive rows of notches, formed in
this manner:</p>

<center>
<p><a name="grey1-14"></a><img alt="" src="/ebooks/e00054-images/grey1-14.jpg"></p>

<p><b>13. Three rows of notches made by people on the Gouty-Stem
Tree.</b></p>
</center>

<p>All but the last row being invariably scratched out. These
rows of notches were evidently of different ages, and I imagine
must indicate the number of nuts taken each year from the tree.*
I often also found rude drawings scratched upon the trees, but
none of these sketches indicated anything but a very ordinary
degree of talent, even for a savage: some were so imperfect that
it was impossible to tell what they were meant to represent.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. This tree was also observed on this part
of the continent by Captain King, who met with it both at
Cambridge Gulf and Careening Bay, and describes it as follows:
Mr. Cunningham was fortunate in finding the fruit of the tree
that was first seen by us at Cambridge Gulf, and had for some
time puzzled us from its immense size and peculiar appearance. It
proved to be a tree of the Natural Order Capparides, and was
thought to be a Capparis; the gouty habit of the stem, which was
soft and spongy, gave it an appearance of disease; but as all the
specimens, from the youngest plant to the full-grown tree,
possessed the same deformed appearance, it was evidently the
peculiarity of its habit. The stem of the largest of these trees
measured twenty-nine feet in girt, whilst its height did not
exceed twenty-five feet. It bore some resemblance to the
Adansonia figured in the account of Captain Tuckey's expedition
to Congo. King's Australia volume 1 page 423.)</blockquote>

<p>SINGULAR PIECES OF SANDSTONE.</p>

<p>I this day again remarked a circumstance which had before this
period elicited my attention; which was that we occasionally
found fixed in the boughs of trees, at a considerable height from
the ground, pieces of sandstone, nearly circular in form, about
an inch and a half in thickness, and from four to five in
diameter, so that they resembled small millstones. What was the
object in thus fashioning and placing these stones I never could
conceive, for they were generally in the least remarkable spots:
they cannot point out burial places, for I have made such minute
searches that in such a case I must have found some of the bones;
neither can they indicate any peculiar route through the country,
for two never occur near one another.</p>

<p>PREPARATION TO BUILD A BOAT.</p>

<p>On my return to the camp I found that the schooner had not yet
arrived; I now began to fear that some accident had occurred, and
made my preparations accordingly. The party was fully prepared to
meet such a misfortune and, as we had the means of constructing a
boat large enough to take us to Swan River, I felt more anxious
for the safety of those in the vessel than for our own. That no
time however might be lost I examined the neighbourhood of the
encampment and found that within our immediate vicinity were
plenty of trees well adapted for the purpose, which I marked, and
had some of them felled.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 7. HANOVER BAY AND ITS VICINITY.</h2>

<p>OCCUPATION AT THE CAMP.</p>

<p>During the absence of the schooner we had our attention fully
engaged in forming a garden, collecting specimens, and building
sheds for the stores. So difficult and rocky was the country we
were in that I was employed for several days in finding a route
by which unloaded horses could travel from the beach in Hanover
Bay to the point where we were encamped, for the landing-place at
the end of the ravine was so rocky as to be impracticable for
that purpose. Mr. Walker at length discovered a pass in the
cliffs, and by constructing a winding path in this he thought
that we should be able to get loaded horses out of the valley. I
feared that he was too sanguine, and therefore daily renewed my
search in all directions. I travelled up the entire length of the
ravine that we were encamped in but found that, even granting it
was not flooded, we should find great difficulty in emerging by
this route.</p>

<p>These circumstances made me resolve upon the return of the
schooner to re-embark the stores, and land them again either upon
a point I had fixed upon on the south bank of Prince Regent's
River, or upon the neck of land I have before mentioned, which
lay between Port George the Fourth and Hanover Bay; but I could
not finally decide upon either of the points until the return of
the vessel should enable me to examine the coast between Port
George the Fourth and Camden Sound; for my party only consisted
of nine men, of whom with the exception of three or four I knew
nothing, and after what I had seen of the treacherous disposition
of the natives I did not think, in my position, it would be
prudent to absent myself from them for any length of time.</p>

<p>RETURN OF THE LYNHER.</p>

<p>Amidst such exciting and busy scenes, the time flew rapidly
away until the 17th of January, when about 11 A.M. the report of
a carronade came echoing up the valley. This was the preconcerted
signal which was to announce to us that the vessel was safely at
anchor in Hanover Bay. We were of course all anxiety to hear an
account of their adventures, and to ascertain whether the horses
were safe. I hastened directly to the landing-place, where I met
Mr. Lushington and a party coming ashore from the schooner.</p>

<p>RELATION OF PROCEEDINGS AT KUPANG TIMOR AND ROTI.</p>

<p>The following outline of their transactions was soon
given:</p>

<p>They had quitted Hanover Bay on the 21st December at 9 A.M.,
and reached Kupang in the Island of Timor on the 1st of January.
For the first three days until they got clear of the land they
had every evening, soon after sunset, heavy squalls from the
north-east, accompanied with thunder, lightning, and rain; the
prevalent wind was however from the north-west. The Lynher
remained at Kupang until the 7th, during which time they
completed their water and collected coconuts, bread-fruit trees,
etc., to be planted in Australia; but as Mr. Lushington found
that he should be able more easily to obtain ponies at the island
of Roti than at Kupang, they sailed on the morning of the 7th for
that place, and at 7 P.M. came to in the harbour of Rougun in
eleven fathoms water, with muddy bottom.</p>

<p>They were enabled to procure at Roti the requisite number of
horses by the evening of the 11th of January. The people of this
island appeared to be excessively ignorant, knew but little of
the nature and value of money, and were much astonished when they
were shown a watch. Their favourite mode of disposing of their
property was by barter; the articles they prized most were
muskets and coarse gunpowder, but they preferred having the
gunpowder in a claret bottle, as if this was considered by them
to be some definite measure which bore a certain value. They were
not very particular about the quality of the muskets provided
their outward form and appearance were tolerably good. I have
since ascertained that the natives of the little-frequented
islands of the Archipelago invariably prefer an old musket to a
new one, as they conceive a totally new one may be unsafe, from
having been made merely for the purpose of sale; whilst one which
has seen service has been indisputably manufactured for use. If
they entertain any doubt about the goodness of a musket they
generally insist upon the seller's firing it off.</p>

<p>MODE OF BARTER AT ROTI.</p>

<p>The people of Roti are not allowed to fix themselves what is
to be the price of their horses; all the details of the sale are
settled by an assemblage of chiefs: their constant cry in
bartering (if anything else is offered to them) is "schnapper,
schnapper" (a musket, a musket). They refused at first to take
percussion guns in exchange, but when they saw Captain Browse
cock one of these, pour a quantity of water over the lock, and
fire it off, their astonishment knew no bounds, and they then
eagerly bartered for them. When they found that all the muskets
were exhausted they were content to take money and other articles
in lieu: an old dress waistcoat of mine and a regulation
breastplate procured eight small sheep; and Captain Browse got
fourteen goats for a pair of old pistols. The authorities give
every encouragement to the trader; but the duties exacted are
high, for at Kupang and Roti they demand six rupees duty for
every horse exported, or musket imported. Arms and gunpowder are
no longer considered contraband.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Roti were described as being so indolent
that it was almost impossible to induce them to do anything:
although every means were used to tempt them to cut a sufficient
quantity of fodder for the ponies on their passage they
constantly delayed doing so and, Mr. Lushington's patience being
at last worn out, the vessel put to sea on the 12th of January
1838.</p>

<p>NEW ISLAND DISCOVERED.</p>

<p>On the 13th they sighted the Hibernian shoal which they made
in 11 degrees 57 minutes south latitude and 123 degrees 22
minutes 30 seconds east longitude. On Monday 15th of January at
10 P.M. they discovered an island, thus described in the log of
the Lynher:</p>

<p>At 10 hours 30 minutes P.M. saw land about a quarter of a mile
ahead; hauled our wind to west by south; sounded in 12 fathoms
water, rocky bottom; it appeared to be about one mile in extent,
and about twenty feet above the water. After running west by
south one mile, got no bottom with 40 fathoms of line. Kept our
course south by east: it (the island) appeared to be quite level
with rocks extending to north-west, with heavy breakers. Made it
by observation south latitude 14 degrees 4 minutes; east
longitude 123 degrees 31 minutes by good chronometer rated at
Roti.</p>

<p>TROUBLE WITH THE HORSES.</p>

<p>At 6 A.M. on the morning of the 16th they experienced heavy
squalls of wind off Red Island, and this prevented them from
getting into Hanover Bay on that day; but on the morning of the
17th they anchored safely, without having lost a single pony, or
without having experienced any serious misfortune, having made
the passage from Roti in five days.</p>

<p>UNFORESEEN EMBARRASSMENTS.</p>

<p>Some short time was occupied in narrating the adventures we
had respectively encountered since we had last seen one another,
and in giving way to the pleasure arising from meeting again in
so distant a land, and under such circumstances: at last came the
unpleasant announcement that there was not an atom of forage on
board, so that the ponies must of necessity be landed tomorrow;
and my plans of disembarking them at a more eligible site were
thus at once overthrown. Being the only person who knew the route
to Hanover Bay from the encampment, I was obliged to remain on
shore to guide the party over there the next morning. Mr.
Lushington and the Captain however returned on board to make
preparations for landing the horses at daybreak.</p>

<p>LANDING THE HORSES.</p>

<p>I lay down to sleep this night oppressed with very uneasy
thoughts. I was thoroughly convinced that the position we
occupied was a bad one to make a start from; but we had already
approached too near the season of the heaviest rains (the
beginning of February) to allow of longer delay, so that to have
landed the horses, then to cut grass for them, and afterwards to
have re-embarked them and the stores, would, in my opinion, have
been a tedious and wrong course to adopt. Unforeseen
difficulties, and against which we could not have guarded, had
already completely encompassed us, so that, considering the
scanty means at our disposal, the remote and unknown region in
which we were situated, and the impossibility of our receiving
further aid from any quarter, I saw no way of overcoming them.
All therefore that was now left us was to make the most of our
actual means, to acquit ourselves like men, and do our
utmost.</p>

<p>EXCURSION BY WATER TO PRINCE REGENT'S RIVER.</p>

<p>January 18.</p>

<p>Fortune smiled on us this morning in as far as she gave us a
fine daybreak, and at dawn we started for Hanover Bay, leaving a
small party at the encampment. After all the trouble I had taken
to find a good route for the horses, we still had a great deal to
do to render it at all practicable; we however all worked
cheerfully and sturdily away at burning the grass, moving rocks
and fallen trees, etc., and thus, as it were, fought our way
through opposing obstacles to Hanover Bay, over a distance of
about four miles.</p>

<p>TROUBLE IN GETTING THE HORSES TO THE CAMP.</p>

<p>On arriving there I found Mr. Lushington already on shore and
some of the horses disembarked. They were not only well selected
for the purpose, but were generally in good condition. They had
however two faults which could not have been avoided, and these
were that they were very small and perfectly wild. By about two
o'clock in the afternoon the whole twenty-six had been swum
ashore, and we started for the huts.</p>

<p>Our progress was however slow; for, as there were only a few
of us, each person was obliged to take charge of three or four of
these untamed, unbroken brutes. The mode we adopted was to fasten
them together by long ropes so that the number each man led could
follow in a line; but, being wholly unused to this kind of
discipline, they strenuously resisted it, biting and kicking at
one another with the greatest ferocity; and as they were chiefly
very courageous little entire horses, a variety of spirited
contests took place, much to their own satisfaction, but to my
infinite chagrin. Some of the men who were not much accustomed to
horses regarded these wild ponies as being but little better than
savage monsters, with whom it was dangerous to have anything to
do; and, being thus rather afraid of them, treated them very
cruelly, kicking them often with great violence whenever I for a
moment looked away, and thus naturally rendering the ponies still
more wild.</p>

<p>But even when we did induce these brutes to move along
pacifically they would not follow one another in a line, but all
strove to go in different directions, and, as our road lay
through a rocky forest, the consequence of this pulling was that
the connecting ropes kept on getting entangled in rocks and
trees; indeed there was scarcely an instance of two of them
passing on the same side of a tree or rock at the first attempt,
so that we were continually halting to clear their tether ropes;
again, one of the beasts would now and then become obstinate,
refuse to move, and this delayed us all; for I would not allow
the party to separate for fear of the natives. In consequence of
all these adverse circumstances at sunset we had scarcely got
half-way to the encampment; and just at this period one pony
became and remained so obstinate that, in despair, I had it tied
up to a tree alone. We now moved on again as fast as we could,
but night soon surprised us, and, when it became too dark to see
our course, we tethered our horses and laid down in the forest by
them; but as it rained, and we had neither warm clothes nor
covering, and many of the party had tasted nothing since dawn,
our situation was not very pleasant; indeed, the combined
circumstances of cold, hunger, and obstinate ponies had rendered
some of the men more crabbed than I had ever before seen
them.</p>

<p>January 19.</p>

<p>As soon as it was light enough to find the ponies we
recommenced our march; and, all our annoyances of yesterday being
repeated, did not succeed in arriving at the ravine until
noon--it took us much care and a great deal of time to reach the
bottom of this in safety; when however we had done so, we
knee-haltered the ponies and let them loose amidst very good
feed, of which they now stood much in need, for there was no
grass whatever between the encampment and Hanover Bay; the whole
of the intervening country being a mass of rock, scrub, and
spinifex. I now sent a party back to bring on the refractory
pony, which I had yesterday been obliged to tie up to a tree, and
the long fast it had been subjected to appeared to have produced
a very beneficial effect on its temper, for it now was perfectly
docile.</p>

<p>EXCURSION UP PRINCE REGENT'S RIVER. PREPARATIONS FOR
MOVING.</p>

<p>For the next few days all was bustle and preparation. The
ponies being so much smaller than I had expected, all our
packsaddles had to be altered, and fourteen of them, which the
party had made during the absence of the schooner, still had to
be put together. Mr. Walker undertook the task of constructing a
pathway up the cliffs, by means of which the loaded ponies could
ascend; he laboured personally at making this path, occasionally
assisted by two or three others; and it would be impossible for
anyone who had not seen it at all to comprehend the obstacles he
met with, and the perseverance with which he contended against
and finally overcame them. We were obliged to complete everything
in a hurried and unsatisfactory manner, for our departure had
been so long delayed that we were every day in expectation of the
setting in of the heavy rains and the consequent flooding of the
ravine in which we were encamped; and in the event of this taking
place before we made a start it was impossible to foresee for how
long a period our movements might be delayed.</p>

<p>CHARACTER OF ITS SHORES.</p>

<p>On Monday the 22nd Captain Browse and Mr. Walker accompanied
me in the jolly-boat up Prince Regent's River; we went up with
the flood-tide, entering the river by its northern mouth; I had
thus an opportunity of examining the island which lies at the
entrance to this great arm of the sea, and landed upon it in
several places, but found only bad sandy land, occasionally
covered with rocks; it was however well wooded and abounded with
birds. After we had passed the mouth of Rothsay Water the tide
swept us along with great rapidity, and we soon found ourselves
in St. George's Basin. I kept close along the northern shore,
where we saw but little good land after entering the basin; but
there was one fertile island, of a small conical shape, bearing
nearly due east as you enter. From the appearance of this island
there can be no doubt whatever that it is of volcanic origin; as
it in all respects resembles Mount Lyell and the other basaltic
conical hills which we afterwards found in the fertile district
of Glenelg; we did not however land on it, but merely ran close
by, and then continued our route up the river.</p>

<p>St. George's Basin is a noble sheet of water some ten or
twelve miles across. On its southern side deep inlets run up into
a low and marshy country, leading to fertile districts, and the
main object of my present excursion was to endeavour to identify
these inlets with some I had seen on my first trip to the
southward.</p>

<p>SCENERY AND THUNDERSTORM.</p>

<p>On the northern bank lofty mountains, crowned with castellated
summits, rear their sterile heads over the broad waters, and
fling their giant shadows on the bosom of the basin, forming a
scene of surpassing beauty.</p>

<p>We had entered the more contracted channel of the river, when
there came on a tremendous squall of wind, rain, thunder, and
most vivid lightning. The pealing echoes of the thunder as they
bounded from height to height and from cliff to cliff was awfully
magnificent; whilst the rugged mountains which had just before
looked golden in the bright light of the setting sun were now
shrouded in gloomy mists, and capped with dark clouds from which
issued incessant and dazzling flashes of lightning.</p>

<p>During this grand and terrific elemental convulsion our little
boat was driven powerless before the blast. The impenetrable
forests of mangroves which clothed the riverbanks obliging us to
run far up the stream until at last a convenient opening enabled
us to land upon the southern shore.</p>

<p>DELUSIVE APPEARANCE ON THE ROCKS.</p>

<p>We had not long landed when the rain ceased and, as we found
several natural caverns in the rock and plenty of dead mangrove
trees, we proceeded to make ourselves comfortable for the night;
but the men soon reported that they saw the smoke of a native
fire close to us, and Captain Browse and myself, under the
conviction that such was the case, darted with Mr. Walker to
endeavour to gain an interview. But, as we proceeded over the
rocks, the smoke appeared gradually to retire, always keeping
about the same distance from us: and we at last ascertained that
what had appeared to us to be smoke was nothing but the rising
vapour occasioned by the cold rain falling on sandstone rocks,
which had during the whole day been exposed to the burning rays
of a tropical sun.</p>

<p>We had now become so much accustomed to sleeping without any
covering, and upon hard rocks, that we should not have minded our
exposure had it not been for the rain which fell during the night
and beat in under the rocks, beneath which we had crept for
shelter. The cold air of the morning awoke us long before
daylight; and Mr. Walker and myself, having explored the country
to the southward and climbed a high hill from which we had an
extensive view, we started on our return to the schooner. In
proceeding down the river we landed on an island, situate at the
south-eastern extremity of St. George's Basin, just where the
river runs into it. The presence of large dead trees on this
island, which had evidently been swept down the river in the time
of floods and washed up far above the usual water-mark, showed
that Prince Regent's River is subject to the same sudden
inundations as all other rivers in Australia which I have seen.
During our passage down the river we saw no extent of good land
in any one place.</p>

<p>STATE OF THE STOCK.</p>

<p>For the next few days we had almost uninterrupted bad weather.
The party were all occupied in preparing the saddles, etc. The
ponies having eaten off the grass in the ravine, we were
compelled, about the 28th, to move them to the higher grounds.
These at our first arrival on this coast were perfectly dry and
burnt up; but since the heavy rains had set in they teemed with
running springs, along the margins of which grew a scanty coating
of grass. Being obliged to send the horses to a distance to graze
delayed us a great deal for one portion of our party was occupied
in attending upon them. Our sheep also now began to die off: they
had up to this time improved rapidly and were doing very well,
having, during the absence of the vessel, been regularly tended
and driven to the high dry ground to feed; but now the pressure
of business was so great that we were compelled in some degree to
neglect them, and from this they suffered. The goats had from
some cause never succeeded well.</p>

<p>From the period of their being landed many of the horses had
declined very much, and several of them were by this time reduced
to a very weakly state. This originated from the heavy rains and
the excessive cold which accompanied them, as well as from some
food they had eaten which had not agreed with them. On the 28th
and 29th the rains increased in violence and duration; but we
still continued our occupations of completing the packsaddles and
arranging the stores in such small packages that they could
easily in case of necessity be transported on men's
shoulders.</p>

<p>FINAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MARCH.</p>

<p>Having provided every requisite for the party, such as food,
working utensils, soap, tobacco, etc., all of which were arranged
in their respective packages, I issued an order that nothing but
certain articles of clothing for each individual were to be put
upon the ponies. This step was rendered the more necessary from
their weakness and their diminutive size having greatly abridged
our intended means of transport. Numerous requests were now made
to me to be allowed to put various articles upon the horses, all
of which I felt myself obliged to meet by a steady refusal; but
this refusal, dictated entirely by the necessity of the case,
raised angry and discontented feelings, tending to diminish
materially the individual zeal and energy which were so much
required at this juncture to ensure our success.</p>

<p>DEPARTURE FOR THE INTERIOR. DIFFICULTIES OF THE ROUTE.</p>

<p>On the 29th we began in the afternoon to load our horses. Mr.
Walker's pathway was completed by means of a number of circuitous
and sharp turnings: it led directly up the face of cliffs which
were almost precipitous and 180 feet in height. To commemorate
the completion of this really laborious undertaking I named the
valley Walker's Valley.</p>

<p>TROUBLESOME ASCENT FROM THE VALLEY. SICKNESS AND MORTALITY
AMONG THE HORSES AND STOCK.</p>

<p>The ponies, though weak, bore their burdens and submitted to
the packsaddles better than I had hoped. The first horse was led
up by the stock-keeper in safety, with its saddle and load on it;
I followed with the second, but was not so fortunate. I had
accomplished about three-fourths of the ascent when, turning one
of the sharp corners round a rock, the load struck against it and
knocked the horse over on its side. I thought for a moment that
the poor beast would have fallen down the precipice, but luckily
its roll was checked in time to prevent this. There it lay
however on a flat rock, four or five feet wide, a precipice of
150 feet on one side of it, and the projecting rock against which
it had struck on the other, whilst I sat upon its head to prevent
it from moving. Its long tail streamed in the wind over the
precipice; its wild and fiery eye gleamed from its shaggy mane
and forelock; and, ignorant of its impending danger, it kicked
and struggled violently, whilst it appeared to hang in mid-air
over the gloomy depth of this tropical ravine. Anxious as I felt
for the safety of my pony I could not be unconscious of the
singular beauty of the scene during the few minutes that elapsed
whilst I was repressing its struggles on a narrow ledge of rock,
of which the dark brow projected threateningly above me, whilst
the noise of a rushing torrent was audible far below. I cut the
girths of the saddle, which then with its load rolled over the
precipice, and pitched with a heavy crash on a rock far down.
Even then, if the brute had not been a denizen of a wild and
mountainous country, it must have been lost; but now it no sooner
felt itself freed from its encumbrance than, looking sagaciously
around and then raising itself cautiously up, it stood trembling
by my side upon the narrow terrace.</p>

<p>Warned by this misfortune we managed to make another turn in
the path, by which this awkward rock was avoided, and the
remainder of the horses, with their loads, reached the tableland
in safety. But so rocky was this country that, even after having
mastered the ascent, we found great difficulty in getting the
loaded ponies half a mile further to a point I had fixed on for
our camp. We had this night a continued succession of heavy
showers, accompanied with thunder and lightning.</p>

<p>January 30.</p>

<p>This morning it was reported to me that several sheep were
dead, and that the horses were beginning to suffer much from
constant exposure to the heavy cold rains, for the trees were so
small, and their foliage so slight, that they afforded no shelter
whatever from tropical showers. On repairing to the ravine I
found that the stream which even yesterday was much swollen had
now become an impetuous torrent, so much so that even to swim
across it was not an easy matter. A tree was soon felled and a
temporary foot-bridge thus formed; and as the rain cleared off a
little towards the afternoon we managed, in this interval of fine
weather, to load the ponies and carry some stores up the cliffs,
but the poor beasts were so much weakened since yesterday that we
were obliged to diminish their loads considerably. They all
appeared to be gradually declining in health, strength, and
condition, but from what cause except exposure I could not
tell.</p>

<p>IMPEDIMENTS FROM BAD WEATHER.</p>

<p>January 31.</p>

<p>During last night we had heavy storms, the torrent was still
more swollen and, although we laboured hard all day, we
accomplished very little; several sheep died during the day, and
the ponies appeared to be worse. I became now very anxious as to
the result of the expedition; my worst apprehensions as to the
rainy season setting in before we had got clear of the sandstone
ranges had already been fully realized; every endeavour to hasten
our preparations and to prevent this occurrence had been used,
though unsuccessfully; it appeared now the better course to bear
up against evils that could not be avoided than to lose time in
murmuring; I therefore kept all hands constantly employed in
doing something which might tend to accelerate our departure.</p>

<p>HEAVY RAINS.</p>

<p>February 1.</p>

<p>We again had heavy and incessant rain throughout Wednesday
night, accompanied by thunder and lightning. At daylight the
stock-keeper came to report to me that two horses, three sheep,
and one goat were dead, and that several other horses appeared to
be in a very dangerous state. All our stores with the exception
of a few articles had now been removed from the valley in which
we had first encamped; some of our goats were still left there,
but the torrent had become so rapid and impetuous that it had
swept away the bridge and was now impassable. Heavy rains fell
throughout the greater portion of the day, and produced a
beautiful effect in the ravines, for cascades were pouring over
the cliffs on each side, sweeping every now and then before them
massive pieces of rock, the crash of which in their fall echoed
loudly through the valleys.</p>

<p>FURTHER LOSS OF STOCK.</p>

<p>February 2.</p>

<p>Bad news came again this morning--the stock-keeper met me with
a very rueful countenance to report that another horse and two
sheep had just been found dead, and that several more sheep were
missing. It still rained so heavily that we could not attempt to
move, for already a considerable portion of our stores was
damaged by the water which had filled the ditch, and regularly
flooded the tent in which they were placed.</p>

<p>Mr. Walker started with me for the purpose of marking off a
road to the place we next intended to halt at, for the country
was so rocky that it was necessary to choose a path with the
greatest caution, or we should soon have become embarrassed in
precipitous places which the horses could not have traversed.
Whilst I was thus engaged Mr. Lushington and two men made another
unsuccessful attempt to get the goats and remaining stores across
the stream.</p>

<p>WEAKNESS AND OBSTINACY OF THE PONIES.</p>

<p>February 3.</p>

<p>This morning the rain had somewhat abated: the remaining
stores were brought from the ravine, and the goats were swum
across; in the meantime the ponies were brought up and loaded,
and all preparations were at last made for a start: but a host of
new difficulties arose; many of the ponies were found to be in
such a weakly state that they could with great difficulty carry
any weight at all. We were obliged to make a totally new division
of the stores, and to select and put aside what articles we could
best leave behind. These preparations occupied a considerable
time, but we at last moved off in a south-east direction. Our
progress was however very slow and tedious; the ponies, though
lightly loaded, were so reduced that the slightest obstacle made
many fall from weakness, whilst others laid down from obstinacy,
and the men being inexperienced in re-fixing the loads, each
horse that fell delayed us considerably. At last so many were
down at one time that I advanced with such as were able to move
to a point distant not more than half a mile, where I halted for
the night; and, having unloaded and tethered these horses, we
returned to assist the others, and after a great deal of
difficulty got the remainder of the weak ponies safe to the
encampment.</p>

<p>I slept but little this night for I doubted whether, with our
cattle so enfeebled and so out of condition, we should ever
succeed in penetrating any distance into the country. We were
still a considerable way from the fertile plains I had seen to
the southward, whilst the intervening ground was very difficult
to travel across and afforded no good feed for the ponies. All my
meditations however only terminated in the conviction that it was
my duty to continue to use my best exertions under such adverse
circumstances.</p>

<p>February 4.</p>

<p>There being no good grass for the horses where we were, I was
obliged to move the party and commenced by using every method I
could to lighten the loads and to rid the expedition of all
encumbrances. I left here a male and female goat who, by their
obstinacy, delayed our movements; thinking also that, if they
escaped the natives, their offspring might become a valuable
acquisition to this land.</p>

<p>We also left here 28 pounds of gunpowder, 10 pounds of ball
cartridges, 70 pounds of shot, 200 pounds of preserved meat, some
carpenters' tools, and many other useful articles; yet,
notwithstanding this decrease in the loads of the ponies, the
country we had to travel through was so bad that we only
completed two miles in the course of the day; and yet to find the
track by which we did succeed in crossing the range had cost me
many successive hours' walking under a burning sun. The character
of the country we passed through was the same as these sandstone
ranges always present; namely, sandy scrubby plains, and low
ranges of ruinous, rocky hills, in trying to scramble over which
the ponies received numerous and severe falls. We however had a
very beautiful halting-place, shaded by lofty pines and affording
fair feed for the animals.</p>

<p>NEW PLAN OF MOVEMENTS.</p>

<p>February 5.</p>

<p>On this morning it was reported to me that several of the
ponies were in a dying state, and that none of them would be
again able to carry even such light loads as they had hitherto
done; the quantity of stores they could now convey was quite
inadequate to supply a party of the strength we were obliged to
move with for any great length of time. A new plan of operations
was thus forced upon me, and I now resolved to proceed as
follows:</p>

<p>To advance with half our stores to a convenient place for
encamping at, and then, on the succeeding day, to send back some
of the party with the ponies for the remaining portion of the
provisions; whilst, accompanied by two men, I marked off the road
by which we were to move on the following day. This mode of
proceeding would not very much delay our movements; for the
country we were at present in was of so intricate a nature that
it was impossible to move loaded horses without previously
marking a road for them; and by its adoption I trusted to be able
to establish a depot of provisions at some point distant from the
coast and whence we could yet make a good start in a southerly
direction.</p>

<p>LABOUR OF TRACING ROUTE.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this plan Mr. Lushington returned this day to
our last camp to bring up the provisions we had abandoned; whilst
I went off with two men to endeavour to pick out a route by which
the ponies could travel. A more toilsome day's work than we had
could not be imagined. For eleven hours I was incessantly
walking, exposed during the greater part of the time to the
burning rays of a tropical sun; and we found nothing but rocky,
almost impassable sandstone ranges and precipitous ravines. I
however at last succeeded in discovering a path along which it
was just possible we might be able, by using great care, to lead
loaded horses; and on my return to the camp I found that all the
remaining stores had been brought up.</p>

<p>DESCENT INTO A VALLEY.</p>

<p>February 6.</p>

<p>We began our descent this morning from the tableland into a
deep valley, following the track we had yesterday marked off,
which was still however so rugged and rocky as to be very
difficult to get along. Heavy rains set in, and these were always
so cold that the large drops falling upon us Occasioned quite a
painful sensation. The valleys being all flooded there was no
feed in them for the horses and sheep; I therefore was obliged to
send them back under charge of Mr. Lushington to the camp, which
we had this morning quitted.</p>

<p>I retained three men with me; and after the remainder of the
party had moved off I left two of them in charge of the stores,
and started with Corporal Coles, again to explore the country in
front of us.</p>

<p>CHARACTER OF THE COUNTRY. FLOODED RAVINE.</p>

<p>About half a mile to the south there was a deep ravine,
bounded on each side by lofty cliffs. This ravine resembled in
many respects the one we had first encamped in, but it was
larger; and it was now impossible to travel either up or down in
it on account of the great body of water which occupied its bed.
Just opposite to where we were this ravine separated into three
smaller ones, running up into the sandstone ranges along which I
had previously sought for a route whereby to turn and travel
round their heads; but I had found the country so rocky, so
impracticable, and devoid of forage that I felt sure it was
useless to attempt to traverse it.</p>

<p>My next object was to find a passage out of the main ravine,
between the points where the subsidiary ravines ran into it, and
where it joined the sea. If I could succeed in doing this our
difficulties would, in a great measure, have terminated, for no
other main ravine lay between us and the fertile plains which I
had seen to the southward; and I knew that we should find no
difficulty in traversing the intervening sandstone range, which
consisted of a series of elevated plains or terraces, rising one
behind the other.</p>

<p>With this view Coles and myself searched until after sunset,
but without success. We found the ravine bounded throughout its
southern side by inaccessible cliffs. Occasionally little branch
ravines ran into it; but on penetrating for some distance up
these they invariably terminated in precipitous cascades. A great
portion of this afternoon was spent up to our middles in water as
we waded about the flooded valley; and the only thing we had to
compensate us for the fatigue and suffering we underwent was the
wild beauty of the scenery, which was as lovely and picturesque
as impetuous torrents, foaming cascades, lofty rocks, and a rich
tropical vegetation could render it.</p>

<p>NATIVES.</p>

<p>On our return homewards, wearied and disappointed, we came
close upon a large party of natives before they were aware of our
presence. Coles had followed me up the northern bank of the
ravine, and we thus occupied a good position; the natives had, I
suppose, wished to avoid us, for we saw no more of them, but
merely heard the sound of their retiring voices as they moved up
the centre of the valley. We now returned to the men we had left
in charge of the stores, and reached the tent soon after
dark.</p>

<p>LABOUR OF TRACING AND FORMING A PATH.</p>

<p>February 7.</p>

<p>This day was passed in constructing the pathway which was to
lead us down into the deep ravine in our front. Whilst the men
were thus engaged I traversed the country I had yesterday visited
in the hope that I might yet find some outlet into the good
country which would take us clear of the others; but my searches
were in vain. Only one man accompanied me, and I completely
knocked him up ere the evening closed in upon us. We then were
obliged to retrace our steps to the camp, and I now found myself
perfectly worn out by the fatigue consequent on such continued
and violent walking exercise under a tropical sun.</p>

<p>It was however cheering to me to see how constantly some of
the men had laboured at forming the road down the valleys which
led into the ravine. The horses had been brought down thus far;
but three more of them had died, so that our twenty-six ponies
were reduced to nineteen, many of whom were in wretched
condition.</p>

<p>CONTINUED DIFFICULTIES OF ROUTE.</p>

<p>February 8.</p>

<p>We again resumed our journey towards the interior; but the
pathway, which ran through the valleys leading to the summit of
the ravine, was still so broken and difficult that the ponies
could only carry half loads along it; and the descent down the
clifTs was so steep that they were obliged to be unladen and led
into the ravine without their burdens, which were carried down
upon the men's shoulders. Men could not have behaved better than
they all did on this occasion, particularly Corporal Auger who,
possessing the power of carrying on his back very heavy burdens,
took every occasion of exercising it in such a way as to
stimulate the others, and very much to accelerate our
movements.</p>

<p>But even when we had with so much labour got ponies, stores,
etc. to the bottom of the ravine, our troubles had, as it were,
only commenced, for we now had to get out of it on the other
side. In the course of the afternoon however a path had been
made, and most of the stores were safely stowed upon an elevated
tableland where we had pitched the tents. The place I had chosen
for our camp was a pretty spot; a sweet, short herbage had been
raised by the heavy rains from the sandy soil, and amongst this
the beauteous flowers, for which Australia is deservedly
celebrated, were so scattered and intermixed that they gave the
country an enamelled appearance. A lofty species of Casuarina was
intermingled with trees of a denser foliage, and on each side we
looked down into two deep ravines; through the dense dark foliage
of which could be seen the white foaming waters brawling on their
way far below.</p>

<p>The next day was occupied in bringing up the remainder of the
stores from the ravine and repairing the damages which had
resulted from the bursting of bags and other mischief in their
transit over such rough ground. Early in the morning we all had a
good bathe, and only those who have been so constantly engaged
under a burning sun, and for upwards of a week without regularly
washing or undressing, can at all estimate the pleasure with
which I plunged into the clear and rapid stream.</p>

<p>ASCENT FROM THE RAVINE.</p>

<p>After thus performing our ablutions we breakfasted, and then,
whilst the stores were being conveyed to the tableland, I
started, accompanied by one man, to explore a route for our line
of march next day. After continuing on the tableland for about a
mile I traced a good route both into and out of another ravine;
the stream which occupied the bed of this was so swollen that I
had some difficulty in finding a ford across it; but after a few
rather ludicrous plunges and falls upon the green slippery rocks
I succeeded in detecting a tolerably good one. Our line of route
now lay across some elevated open plains, clothed with spinifex,
and thinly wooded with a large species of Eucalyptus. We saw here
numerous signs of the natives, who had been cutting steps in the
trees for the purpose of hunting opossums. These open plains
extended for about two miles, and we then reached another small
ravine, with a rapid stream running through it. A very good route
brought us across this slight descent and stream; and from this
point no further impediment of any consequence appeared to lie in
our way. The direction in which I now wished to travel presented
a series of rocky, sandy plains, thinly wooded, and affording a
scanty sufficiency of food for the ponies.</p>

<p>EXHAUSTION FROM FATIGUE. COLD RAINS.</p>

<p>During the time I was searching for this route the rain had
fallen in torrents, and the quantity of ground I had walked over
was so considerable that I was exhausted; riding was quite
impossible in these excursions as, in many places where the
ground was covered with loose rocks overgrown with a vegetation
which concealed treacherous cavities, it was necessary to pass
across it two or three times before I could determine whether a
horse could move over it or not. Today I found myself completely
knocked up, and felt certain that I could not for many days
longer bear up against such continued fatigues. On my return to
the camp I found all prepared for a start tomorrow; but many of
the horses were so ill as to be incapable of carrying more than
half a load.</p>

<p>February 10.</p>

<p>We moved off at daybreak and, having reached the ravine, set
to work to form a pathway down the descent, and up the ascent on
the other side, under the additional disadvantage of heavy rain.
The sudden transition from the rays of a burning sun to this cold
bath made my teeth chatter as if I had a tertian ague. When half
our work was completed we breakfasted in the beautiful ravine
amidst the dark luxuriant vegetation of the tropics, formed by
the pandanus, bamboo, and palm.</p>

<p>After breakfast the men recommenced their labour on the road.
About two P.M. it was completed, and we then loaded the ponies
and set out. The poor animals were however so weak that it was
almost impossible to get them to move; they stumbled and fell
repeatedly, and thus thereby not only injured themselves but so
delayed our movements that we only made three miles and a half
during the day, and then halted for the night on very elevated
land, and in a good position, for we were on a little sandy rise,
along the base of which ran a stream, distant about one hundred
yards.</p>

<p>WORST DIFFICULTIES SURMOUNTED.</p>

<p>Having thus gained the elevated plains I laid down to sleep,
satisfied that the worst of our labours were over; yet I could
not but recollect that it had taken us ten days to reach a spot
which by the proper route was only a short day's journey from the
valley we were first encamped in, and that in our march through
the country we had been compelled to traverse we had lost seven
ponies, and injured many of those remaining; all these
difficulties arose from our departure having been delayed so long
that the rains had set in and so flooded the country that we
could not proceed by the proper route.</p>

<p><a name="chapter8"></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER 8. TO THE GLENELG RIVER.</h2>

<p>MEETING AND ENCOUNTER WITH THE NATIVES.</p>

<p>February 11.</p>

<p>The stores we had left behind yesterday were so necessary to
us that I was fearful they might be injured or destroyed if left
exposed in the bush beyond today, and therefore despatched a
party under Mr. Lushington for them.</p>

<p>Some time after they were gone I started from the encampment
on foot, with the intention of choosing a track for our route
next day, as well as of endeavouring to fall in with my former
track in this direction; for by so doing I should be enabled to
get the party on the good land without further impediment, and at
the same time to complete my map of this part of the country.</p>

<p>GATHERING OF NATIVES ABOUT THE CAMP.</p>

<p>I was accompanied by Corporal Coles and a fine-looking young
man about twenty years of age, from the Cape of Good Hope,
leaving three men at the camp. Soon after my departure these men
heard the voices of natives in the woods, and presently they
appeared themselves in numbers which rapidly increased until
there were collected together about two hundred men, women, and
children. The party at the tents instantly got under arms, and
posted themselves on the brow of the hill on which our tents
stood; whilst at some distance from its base, and on the opposite
side of the stream, the natives were assembled.</p>

<p>The advance of a large armed body from the woods seemed now to
indicate that a hostile movement was about to be made; one of my
party therefore shouted out to them in a threatening tone,
motioning to them at the same time to go away. The natives
immediately answered the shout, then halted, and, after
apparently consulting together for some time, retired a little.
The party at the tents simultaneously took counsel together and,
agreeing that it would be imprudent in their small number to hold
intercourse, under the existing circumstances, with so large a
body of natives, it was resolved not to allow them to approach
beyond a certain point, and, in the event of any armed portion
passing the stream towards the tents in disregard of their
signals, then to fire on them one by one.</p>

<p>PROCEEDINGS AT THE CAMP.</p>

<p>In the meantime the women and little children moved round the
hill, examining everything with the most intense delight: a pony
which was in front of the camp more particularly excited their
attention; the little children laughed loudly at it, and appeared
also to laugh at the party themselves, regarding them much the
same way that little boys do a stranger in foreign costume when
he appears in the streets of a country village in England. The
native men regarded the pony more seriously; they walked round
and round, examining it carefully, and when the little stallion,
becoming playful from these marks of attention, neighed, put down
his head, and prepared to fight and kick vigorously, they all
beat a precipitate retreat.</p>

<p>The party at the tents overlooked all their movements and
heard every word that was uttered. They describe the language
this people spoke as clear, distinct, and agreeable to the ear;
the men they observed to be a fine race, tall and athletic: two
were remarked in particular, one of whom was very tall, and had
his forehead and face painted with white (their sign of mourning,
and that there is a death to avenge) whilst the other was of a
far lighter shade of colour than the rest, and these two appeared
to direct the general movements.</p>

<p>After some time distant shouts were heard from other natives
in the direction in which my party had seen me go; and a large
body of the native men instantly hurried off in that quarter,
headed by the tall man and the light-coloured one I have just
mentioned. Then ensued a pause of about two hours, during which
the native women and children wandered about in the distance,
conversing in groups: suddenly was heard shouts, as of distress,
from the same quarter, which were answered by the natives in
front of the camp, when all moved off in a hurried manner and
were seen there no more. But in the interim another scene
connected with this had been passing at a distance.</p>

<p>EVENTS IN TRACING A ROAD.</p>

<p>On quitting the camp in the morning I and my two companions
traversed for some time portions of the elevated sandstone plains
which I had passed on a former occasion; and, after an hour's
walking through the gloomy stringy-bark forest which covered
them, we reached a stream of water running in a shallow valley;
and as there was a bad route down to this I halted to make a road
which the ponies could traverse. There was plenty of water and
forage hereabouts, and a fine level country for our proceedings,
so that we were all in high hopes and spirits, and, as I then
believed, our principal difficulties were at an end.</p>

<p>Whilst at work at the road we all thought that we heard a
native call, and that others answered him; having listened for a
repetition of these sounds we again heard them, but they were so
indistinct in character that none of us this time agreed as to
what they were. I imagined that it was the call of a bird and,
when I again heard the same sound very faintly in the distance, I
felt convinced it was not a human voice, and proceeded on my way
perfectly at ease.</p>

<p>My attention was soon occupied by other objects. I saw from a
hill I ascended some remarkable blue peaks to the south: this
gave us fresh hopes; and nothing occurred till about
three-quarters of an hour after we had first heard the native
call, when we arrived at a short descent covered with rocks, from
which started a large kangaroo; I got a fair shot at, and knocked
it over, but it sprang up again and hopped away; we then tried to
track it but soon lost its footsteps in the scrubby vegetation of
the gloomy forest,</p>

<p>It was the duty of the Cape man who accompanied me to mark a
tree every here and there by chipping the bark, so that the party
might the next day easily recognise the route which they had to
pursue; upon looking back I now perceived that he had neglected a
very remarkable tree about twenty or thirty yards behind us, and
which stood close to the spot where I had fired at the kangaroo.
I desired him to go back and chip it, and then to rejoin us; in
the meantime I stood musing as to the best means of avoiding the
little rocky ravine in our front.</p>

<p>SUDDEN SURPRISE BY NATIVES.</p>

<p>Finding that the man remained absent longer than I had
expected I called loudly to him, but received no answer, and
therefore passed round some rocks which hid the tree from my view
to look after him. Suddenly I saw him close to me breathless and
speechless with terror, and a native with his spear fixed in a
throwing-stick in full pursuit of him; immediately numbers of
other natives burst upon my sight; each tree, each rock, seemed
to give forth its black denizen, as if by enchantment.</p>

<p>A moment before, the most solemn silence pervaded these woods.
We deemed that not a human being moved within miles of us, and
now they rang with savage and ferocious yells, and fierce armed
men crowded round us on every side, bent on our destruction.</p>

<p>CONTEST WITH THEM. UNFORTUNATE RESULTS.</p>

<p>There was something very terrible in so complete and sudden a
surprise. Certain death appeared to stare us in the face: and,
from the determined and resolute air of our opponents, I
immediately guessed that the man who had first seen them, instead
of boldly standing his ground, and calling to Coles and myself
for assistance, had at once, like a coward, run away; thus giving
the natives confidence in themselves, and a contempt for us: and
this conjecture I afterwards ascertained was perfectly true.</p>

<p>We were now fairly engaged for our lives; escape was
impossible, and surrender to such enemies out of the
question.</p>

<p>As soon as I saw the natives around me I fired one barrel of
my gun over the head of him who was pursuing my dismayed
attendant, hoping the report would have checked his further
career. He proved to be the tall man seen at the camp, painted
with white. My shot stopped him not: he still closed on us and
his spear whistled by my head; but, whilst he was fixing another
in his throwing stick, a ball from my second barrel struck him in
the arm and it fell powerless by his side. He now retired behind
a rock, but the others still pressed on.</p>

<p>IMMINENT DANGER.</p>

<p>I now made the two men retire behind some neighbouring rocks,
which formed a kind of protecting parapet along our front and
right flank, whilst I took post on the left. Both my barrels were
now exhausted; and I desired the other two to fire separately,
whilst I was reloading; but to my horror, Coles, who was armed
with my rifle, reported hurriedly that the cloth case with which
he had covered it for protection against rain had become
entangled. His services were thus lost at a most critical moment
whilst trying to tear off the lock cover; and the other man was
so paralysed with fear that he could do nothing but cry out, "Oh,
God! Sir, look at them; look at them!"</p>

<p>In the meantime our opponents pressed more closely round;
their spears kept whistling by us, and our fate seemed
inevitable. The light coloured man, spoken of at the camp, now
appeared to direct their movements. He sprang forward to a rock
not more than thirty yards from us and, posting himself behind
it, threw a spear with such deadly force and aim that, had I not
drawn myself forward by a sudden jerk, it must have gone through
my body, and as it was it touched my back in flying by. Another
well-directed spear, from a different hand, would have pierced me
in the breast, but, in the motion I made to avoid it, it struck
upon the stock of my gun, of which it carried away a portion by
its force.</p>

<p>All this took place in a few seconds of time, and no shot had
been fired but by me. I now recognized in the light-coloured man
an old enemy who had led on the former attack against me on the
22nd of December. By his cries and gestures he now appeared to be
urging the others to surround and press on us, which they were
rapidly doing.</p>

<p>FALL OF THE NATIVE CHIEF.</p>

<p>I saw now that but one thing could be done to save our lives,
so I gave Coles my gun to complete the reloading, and took the
rifle which he had not yet disengaged from the cover. I tore it
off and, stepping out from behind our parapet, advanced to the
rock which covered my light-coloured opponent. I had not made two
steps in advance when three spears struck me nearly at the same
moment, one of which was thrown by him. I felt severely wounded
in the hip, but knew not exactly where the others had struck me.
The force of all knocked me down, and made me very giddy and
faint, but as I fell I heard the savage yells of the natives'
delight and triumph; these recalled me to myself, and, roused by
momentary rage and indignation, I made a strong effort, rallied,
and in a moment was on my legs; the spear was wrenched from my
wound, and my haversack drawn closely over it, that neither my
own party nor the natives might see it, and I advanced again
steadily to the rock. The man became alarmed and threatened me
with his club, yelling most furiously; but as I neared the rock
behind which all but his head and arm was covered he fled towards
an adjoining one, dodging dexterously, according to the native
manner of confusing an assailant and avoiding the cast of his
spear; but he was scarcely uncovered in his flight when my rifle
ball pierced him through the back between the shoulders, and he
fell heavily on his face with a deep groan.</p>

<p>DISPERSION OF HIS FOLLOWERS.</p>

<p>The effect was electrical. The tumult of the combat had
ceased: not another spear was thrown, not another yell was
uttered. Native after native dropped away and noiselessly
disappeared. I stood alone with the wretched savage dying before
me, and my two men close to me behind the rocks, in the attitude
of deep attention; and as I looked round upon the dark rocks and
forests, now suddenly silent and lifeless but for the sight of
the unhappy being who lay on the ground before me, I could have
thought that the whole affair had been a horrid dream.</p>

<p>For a second or two I gazed on the scene and then returned to
my former position. I took my gun from Coles, which he had not
yet finished loading, and gave him the rifle. I then went up to
the other man, and gave him two balls to hold, but when I placed
them in his hands they rolled upon the earth--he could not hold
them, for he was completely paralysed with terror, and they fell
through his fingers; the perspiration streamed from every pore;
he was ghastly pale and trembled from head to foot; his limbs
refused their functions; his eyes were so fixed in the direction
in which the natives had disappeared that I could draw his
attention to nothing else; and he still continued repeating,
"Good God, sir! look at them, look at them."</p>

<p>The natives had all now concealed themselves, but they were
not far off. Presently the wounded man made an effort to raise
himself slowly from the ground: some of them instantly came from
behind the rocks and trees, without their spears, crowding round
him with the greatest tenderness and solicitude; two passed their
arms round him, his head drooped senselessly upon his chest, and
with hurried steps the whole party wound their way through the
forest, their black forms being scarcely distinguishable from the
charred trunks of the trees as they receded in the distance.</p>

<p>To have fired upon the other natives when they returned for
the wounded man would, in my belief, have been an unnecessary
piece of barbarity. I already felt deeply the death of him I had
been compelled to shoot: and I believe that when a
fellow-creature falls by one's hand, even in a single combat
rendered unavoidable in self-defence, it is impossible not
sincerely to regret the force of so cruel a necessity.</p>

<p>RETURN WOUNDED.</p>

<p>I had now time to attend to my own state and that of my men,
and found that they were uninjured. I had been severely wounded
in the hip; another spear had just cut my right arm, and a third
had deeply indented my powder-flask, whilst lying in a haversack,
immediately over my stomach. The men were not, up to this moment,
aware of my being wounded, as I had thought it better to conceal
this circumstance from them as long as I could. The natives had
gone off in the direction of the tents; and as I felt doubtful
whether they might seize upon a favourable opportunity to
surprise the party there, and thus revenge their defeat, I was
anxious to reach the encampment as soon as possible. We therefore
bound up my wound as well as we could, picked up the spear which
I had drawn out from my hip, and started homewards.</p>

<p>We did not take with us any of the other spears or native
weapons which were lying about in abundance; for I still wished
to show this people that I was actuated by no ill will towards
them. They did not however deal so generously with us; for Coles
unfortunately forgot a notebook which he was carrying for me,
containing many observations of great value; and I sent back a
party to look for it, but the natives had returned to the place
and carried off all their own spears, and other weapons, and my
notebook likewise.</p>

<p>The first part of our march homewards was managed tolerably
well. We saw the tracks of the natives, as if they were still
retiring in the direction of the tents; and at one place, close
to a group of detached rocks, were several tame native dogs, near
which I have no doubt a party of men or women were concealed, as
these animals seldom wander far from their masters. We did not
however see any natives, and continued our route unmolested.</p>

<p>My wound began by degrees to get very stiff and painful, and I
was moreover excessively weak and faint from loss of blood;
indeed I grew so dizzy that I could scarcely see, and neither of
the others were capable of leading the party back to the tents;
yet I was afraid to halt and rest for I imagined that if I
allowed my wound to grow cold and benumbed I should then be
unable to move; leaning therefore on Coles's arm, I walked on as
rapidly as I could, directing the men which way to go.</p>

<p>MISTAKE OF THE ROUTE.</p>

<p>Unfortunately however we lost our track and, after walking for
nearly two hours, I found that we were far from the encampment,
whilst my sight and strength were momentarily failing. Under
these circumstances I told Coles to walk in a direction which I
gave him, and which led directly across the beaten track of the
party; having reached which he could easily make out the
encampment, and, leaning on his arm more heavily than before, we
again moved on.</p>

<p>INABILITY TO PROCEED.</p>

<p>Having reached the track of the party and turned southward to
follow it I still pushed on until we were within two miles of the
tent, when, as I tried to cross a stream, I strained my wounded
hip severely, just reached the opposite shore, and fell utterly
unable to rise again. Coles, with his usual courage and devotion
to me, volunteered to go on alone to the party and send
assistance; the other man was to remain with me and keep a
lookout for the natives, and, had they again attacked us, I
should still have had strength enough to have shot two of them,
and thus have sold my life dearly. I desired Coles to say that a
tent, stores, the surgeon, and two men were to be sent to me, for
that I was not well enough to be moved.</p>

<p>REFLECTIONS.</p>

<p>The water of the stream revived me considerably. My wound
however was very painful, and the interim between Corporal Coles
leaving me, and assistance arriving from the tent was spent in
meditations, arising naturally from my present circumstances. I
sat upon the rocky edge of a cool clear brook, supported by a
small tree. The sun shone out brightly, the dark forest was alive
with birds and insects. On such scenery I had loved to meditate
when a boy, but now how changed I was; wounded, fatigued, and
wandering in an unknown land. In momentary expectation of being
attacked my finger was on the trigger, my gun ready to be raised,
my eyes and ears busily engaged in detecting the slightest
sounds, that I might defend a life which I at that moment
believed was ebbing with my blood away; the loveliness of nature
was around me, the sun rejoicing in his cloudless career, the
birds were filling the woods with their songs, and my friends far
away and unapprehensive of my condition, whilst I felt that I was
dying there.</p>

<p>And in this way very many explorers yearly die. One poor youth
(Mr. Frederick Smith) my own friend and companion, has thus
fallen since the circumstances above described took place; others
have, to my knowledge, lately perished in a similar way. A
strange sun shines upon their lonely graves; the foot of the wild
man yet roams over them: but let us hope when civilization has
spread so far that their graves will be sacred spots that the
future settlers will sometimes shed a tear over the remains of
the first explorer, and tell their children how much they are
indebted to the enthusiasm, perseverance, and courage of him who
lies buried there.</p>

<p>Mr. Walker was by my side within an hour after the time that
Coles had left me; he had come on alone ahead of the others, not
knowing but that I might be in immediate danger, and therefore
running a risk on my account that I can never forget.</p>

<p>He dressed my wound and told me that assistance was at hand to
convey me to the tents. Mr. Lushington soon arrived with a pony.
It was now growing very late in the day. I therefore did not like
to remonstrate against being moved on horseback although, from
the position of my wound, I feared that it was an injudicious
mode of conveyance in my state. I was placed upon the pony and,
supported by my comrades, moved onwards to the tent.</p>

<p>REACH THE CAMP. CONSEQUENCES OF THE WOUND.</p>

<p>I cared but little for the want of comforts I must now be
subject to. Therein I only shared the lot of many a worthy
soldier; but one thing made the night very wretched, for then
through the woods came the piercing shrieks of wailing women and
the mournful cries of native men, sorrowing over him who had that
day fallen by my hand. These cries rang on my ears all night,
startling me at every moment from my feverish and fitful
slumbers.</p>

<p>Early next morning the natives moved off in a westerly
direction without having again attempted in any way whatever to
molest us. My wound was not today so painful as I had
anticipated. Mr. Walker, at my request, attempted to heal it by
union by the first intention, as I hoped to be thus only
compelled to delay the party for a few days.</p>

<p>My pain and suffering were, after the first day, so great,
owing to an abscess having formed in my hip, that I was unable to
keep a regular journal, and will therefore give a short narrative
of the events which occurred, recommencing my journal on the 27th
of February, the day on which I was sufficiently recovered to
enable me to proceed with the party.</p>

<p>CAPE MAN SENT BACK TO THE VESSEL.</p>

<p>Two or three days after I had been wounded the man from the
Cape, who had been with me at the time, came to request that he
might be allowed to leave the party and return to the vessel. He
stated very fairly that his horror and dread of the natives were
so great he should never be able to face them; that he had never
been before placed in circumstances of danger; and felt himself
quite unable to cope with them; that if his own father had been
with him when they attacked us he could not have helped him; and
that he was sure he should die of fright if ever he saw them
again.</p>

<p>I thought it would be cruel to compel him to remain with the
party, and it was moreover impossible to tell what evil effect
his cowardice might produce upon the others; when already he had,
by running away from the natives, induced them to attack us. The
only account he gave of this transaction was that he saw a native
sitting on a rock with a spear and, feeling alarmed, immediately
ran away. No one after this could feel in the least surprised at
the consequences. The peculiar characteristic of this savage race
appears to be that they in all cases act upon first impulses and
impressions. I have repeatedly remarked this trait in their
character; and undoubtedly when they found an unknown being in
their native wilds, who fled from them in evident fear, it was to
be expected that they would, in the first instance, feel very
much inclined to run after, and throw a spear at him.</p>

<p>On the 21st of February I sent a party under Mr. Walker back
to the schooner for the purpose of escorting this man, as well as
to direct the Captain to delay her departure from the bay until
the 2nd day of May; which delay would allow time for us to
complete the exploration of this part of the country, and I could
then decide upon what course I had better adopt.</p>

<p>EVENTS DURING PERIOD OF HALT.</p>

<p>Mr. Walker returned on the 22nd, having executed both these
commissions; and his party brought back for me a little sugar,
arrowroot, and wine. All of these were articles of which, in my
present state, I stood much in need.</p>

<p>My recovery was a good deal delayed by the circumstances in
which I was placed. The heat in the store-tent, a portion of
which I occupied, was sometimes as high as 136 degrees of
Fahrenheit, and until the return of Mr. Walker I had been able to
obtain nothing to eat or drink but damper and tea without sugar;
I also reclined upon the ground, until sores broke out from lying
on so hard a surface in one position. Corporal Auger latterly
however made a sort of low stretcher, which gave me a little more
ease. Added to these bodily ills were many mental ones--but I
will not dwell longer on times so replete with painful
recollections.</p>

<p>ANECDOTE OF RUSTON.</p>

<p>During the time I was lying in my tent, in great pain and very
low spirits, I was attended with every care and kindness by
Ruston, the sailor I had brought from the Cape, who occasionally
suggested such odd topics of comfort as his philosophy could
supply; and one day, either from some expressions I had dropped,
or other circumstance, he conceived that the death of the native
I had shot was preying most upon my mind; under this impression
he came into the tent, seated himself on a flour-bag near me, and
made his usual inquiries as to my wants and desires; then,
glancing at recent events, proceeded to say: "Well, Sir, I'm sure
if I were you, I shouldn't think nothing at all of having shot
that there black fellow; why, Sir, they're very thick and
plentiful up the country." I did not exactly see the consolation
to be derived from this argument of Ruston's, but I could not
forbear smiling at its quaintness, and feeling grateful for the
kindness with which it was intended.</p>

<p>TRACK FOUND.</p>

<p>During my illness Mr. Lushington explored a track to the
westward of the one I had formerly taken, and of which he
reported so favourably that I determined to pursue it. According
to his account, by following it for seven or eight miles, we
should get altogether clear of the sandstone ranges, and enter a
tract of country of great fertility. On the 26th Mr. Walker
reported me to be so much better that he thought I might with
safety move on the next day on horseback, and preparations were
accordingly made for a start.</p>

<p>A very serious change had taken place in our resources in one
respect, for only fourteen ponies now remained alive out of
twenty-six, and many of these were so weak and in such bad
condition as to be almost useless. On opening one of those which
had died about a hat-full of sand was found in its inside, and it
therefore appeared very probable that the ponies, having been
landed in the first instance on loose sandy soil producing only a
short and scanty vegetation, had taken up so much sand with their
food as to interfere with the functions of the stomach, and hence
had arisen their gradual wasting away and ultimate death. I
indeed entertain no doubt that the great loss of ponies we
sustained arose from this cause.</p>

<p>CHANGE OF PLANS.</p>

<p>This reduction in the number of our beasts of burden prevented
me from entertaining further hope of being able to proceed for
any great distance parallel to the coast in a southerly
direction. I therefore formed a depot at our present encampment,
burying all such stores as the remaining ponies were unable to
carry on. My intentions being merely to proceed as far as the
supply of provisions we could carry with us would last, then to
return to our position, and from thence to the schooner.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION OF A NEW VOLCANIC COUNTRY.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 27th of February I was, in pursuance of
this plan of operations, lifted on my horse, and we moved on in a
south-west direction, across sandy plains covered with scrub and
a species of stringy-bark; but on travelling for about a mile and
a half the character of the country became more rocky and
difficult. After moving down a slight descent, we came to a rapid
stream, the same one on the banks of which I had heard the
natives' calls on the day I was wounded; the banks afforded good
food for the horses and trees which offered some shelter to the
men from the burning heat of the sun. I determined therefore to
halt here for breakfast; indeed the horses were so completely
knocked up that they were incapable of travelling any further. We
had already been compelled to abandon one of them in a dying
state since we had started in the morning.</p>

<p>We halted for about an hour and a half and then recommenced
our journey, but were unfortunate enough to miss the marked
trees, and therefore wandered a good deal in our attempts to find
the right track. Whilst thus roaming in the wood we passed two
spots about one hundred yards distant from each other, which I
imagined to be native burying-places: they consisted of piles of
small loose stones so heaped together as to form a large mound;
these mounds were placed on flat bare rocks, one of them, the
smaller, had been recently made, the other was larger and much
older, for it was partly overgrown with plants.</p>

<p>VIEW FROM THE SANDSTONE RANGE.</p>

<p>About 2 P.M. we reached the extremity of the sandstone ridges
and a magnificent view burst upon us. From the summit of the
hills on which we stood an almost precipitous descent led into a
fertile plain below; and from this part, away to the southward,
for thirty to forty miles, stretched a low luxuriant country,
broken by conical peaks and rounded hills which were richly
grassed to their very summits. The plains and hills were both
thinly wooded, and curving lines of shady trees marked out the
courses of numerous streams. Since I have visited this spot I
have traversed large portions of Australia but have seen no land,
no scenery to equal it. We were upon the confines of a great
volcanic district, clothed with tropical vegetation, to which the
Isle of France bears a greater resemblance than any other portion
of the world which I am acquainted with. The rocks in both places
are identical; many of the trees are also the same; and there are
several other close and striking points of similarity.</p>

<p>DESCENT FROM THE SANDSTONE RANGE INTO THE LOW COUNTRY.</p>

<p>The descent into the lowlands, being very difficult, occupied
us nearly two hours; we then gained the bed of a ravine, in which
ran a clear stream: the ravine gradually widening out as we
reached the plains. I proceeded directly down it in the direction
of a lofty peaked hill which bore to the westward of south; and,
having gained a shoulder of this hill, we halted for the
night.</p>

<p>Immediately above us a perfectly conical peak raised its head
to the height of at least five hundred feet;* this hill was
covered with rich grass, and there could be no doubt that it was
of volcanic origin, for the rock of which it was composed was a
vitrified lava resembling that of Ascension. It is from this lava
that the natives form their most deadly spears, for which purpose
it answers well, as it fractures easily, and the fracture
resembles that of the coarse green glass of England; indeed a
lump of this rock might readily be taken for a part of a glass
bottle.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. This hill may be easily recognized by a
precipitous cavity near the summit on its southern side, which
may be seen at some distance.)</blockquote>

<p>The horses and sheep revelled in the luxuriant pasture. The
hill we had encamped on formed a sort of plateau; behind us stood
dark mountains, and in our front lay fertile plains, from which
green hills rose one behind the other until they were lost in the
distance, without any perceptible change in the character of the
country. To the eastward the prospect was similar, as well as to
the westward, except that in this direction the hills were more
lofty, and behind these the tropical sun was hurrying down with a
rapidity of movement never witnessed by those who live in the
gloomy climes of the north. The men all looked healthy and full
of hope; the cool sea-breeze refreshed my feverish frame: I
painted in fancy the rapid progress that this country would ere
long make in commerce and civilization, and my weakness and
fatigues were all forgotten.</p>

<p>DISTANT EXPANSE OF WATER.</p>

<p>February 28.</p>

<p>At dawn this morning the sheep could not be found; tempted by
the goodness of the feed they had broken out from the little
enclosure we had made for them and had wandered off. The
stock-keeper and two of the men, having ascended the conical hill
behind us to try if they could see them from it, reported on
their return that they could descry a large lake or expanse of
water, which bore about south by west from us.</p>

<p>VEXATIOUS DELAYS.</p>

<p>Whilst the search for the sheep was continued I sent another
party up the hill to observe more particularly this sheet of
water, who returned with a report similar to that of the
stock-keeper, and I therefore determined, as soon as everything
had been prepared for starting, to move off in the direction
pointed out; unfortunately the sheep were not found till near
noon but, as I was afraid we should consequently lose a whole
day, I started directly after they were brought in. We had not
proceeded more than half a mile ere I had cause to repent this
measure, for two or three of the men suffered severely from
exposure to the sun, and one of them became so unwell that I was
obliged to halt the party.</p>

<p>The spot I chose was the bank of a stream, shaded over by
dense trees and, if anything could have atoned for the
mortification of being compelled to halt when so anxious to get
on, the cool beauty of this spot would have done so.</p>

<p>When the sun began to fall we again moved on, following the
course of the stream, which ran through a fertile valley about
two miles wide and bounded on either side by gently sloping
hills, extending through a country thinly wooded. We did not halt
until after sunset.</p>

<p>March 1.</p>

<p>This morning we resumed our route along the banks of the
stream, which continued gradually to increase in size. The marshy
ground now extended further from its banks and, in order to free
ourselves from this, I ascended some rising ground to the
eastward, along which we pursued our route until we fell in with
another rapid stream running from the eastward, and were again
involved in marshy land, which delayed us for some time ere we
found a point where loaded ponies could pass. At length however,
having succeeded in getting clear of these obstructions, we
continued our southerly course till we came to a deep stream
running from south-south-east; but, not being able to cross it
there, we travelled along its banks until a ford was found; and
as soon as we had passed over I halted for breakfast.</p>

<p>BEAUTIFUL BASALTIC COUNTRY.</p>

<p>We had traversed a most beautiful country this morning,
composed of basaltic rocks and fine alluvial soil, whilst, from
the size and number of the streams, it must be as well watered as
any region in the world. Before we had completed our breakfast
violent tropical rains set in; these were so cold that some of
the men got into the stream, the waters of which were
comparatively warm, and they thus saved themselves from the
painful feeling caused by very cold water falling on the pores,
which had been previously opened by profuse perspiration. The
heavy rains continued without intermission for the remainder of
the day and night, and two of the men were, on this occasion,
attacked with dysentery, caused, I believe, by cold and
exposure.</p>

<p>DISCOVERY AND CHARACTER OF THE GLENELG RIVER.</p>

<p>March 2.</p>

<p>We started at dawn, crossing a series of low ridges which ran
out from a chain of hills to the eastward of us, and increased in
elevation as we proceeded to the south. We passed numerous
streams, and the country generally continued of a very rich and
fertile character: at last, from the top of one of these ridges,
there burst upon the sight a noble river, running through a
beautiful country, and, where we saw it, at least three or four
miles across, and studded with numerous verdant islands. I have
since seen many Australian rivers, but none to equal this either
in magnitude or beauty.</p>

<p>I at once named it the Glenelg in compliment to the Right
Honourable Lord Glenelg, to whom we were all under great
obligations.</p>

<p>IMPEDIMENTS FROM MARSHES AND STREAMS. INEFFECTUAL ATTEMPT TO
REACH IT.</p>

<p>My anxiety to reach this stream was too great to allow me to
pass much time in looking at it, so, after I had taken a few
bearings to the most remarkable points in the neighbourhood, we
wound down the steep descent in front, and continued our advance
towards the river, but were still at least five miles from it
when we became involved in low marshy ground, traversed by deep
sluggish streams, the banks of which were encumbered by a dense
vegetation. Such a country, though admirably adapted both for
commerce and agriculture, offered almost insurmountable
difficulties to first explorers, at least to such as were
compelled to move rapidly. We at last became so completely
entangled in a marsh that further progress was hopeless, and we
halted to prepare breakfast whilst a party searched for a path by
which we might be enabled to proceed.</p>

<p>My wound was still open and my sufferings from it were great;
whenever we moved on I was lifted on the pony, and when we halted
I was lifted off again and laid on the ground, where weakness
compelled me to remain during the whole period of our halt; and
on occasions like the present, when most anxious myself to search
for a route, I was obliged to lie still like a helpless child. My
mind was as active and as ready for exertion as ever, yet the
weak frame, of which it felt perfectly independent, was incapable
of seconding my most moderate wishes; and the annoyance I
experienced at finding myself in this state long retarded my
recovery and rendered me weaker every day.</p>

<p>At length a route was found, and until sunset we continued our
journey over a very difficult but fertile country, and then
halted for the night on a small elevation, embosomed amidst
conical hills which rose from verdant meadows, watered by several
streams. The country was thinly timbered.</p>

<p>The spot we had halted at was so thickly tenanted with
mosquitoes that it was impossible to sleep. I therefore laid
awake, listening to the cries of the sea-birds and watching the
brilliant fire-flies moving about in the dark foliage of the
trees.</p>

<p>PROGRESS TOWARDS THE UPPER PART OF THE GLENELG.</p>

<p>March 3.</p>

<p>Before the first dawn I called some of the party and we
started off to visit the banks of the river. The first part of
our journey lay across rich grassy flats, thinly wooded with
large shady trees, or over gently rising grounds, on which grew
an abundance of young grass which appeared to be a species of
oat. These rising grounds were thinly wooded with a small sort of
gum tree, called in the Isle of France the Bois noir.</p>

<p>We soon reached low marshy land intersected with large dry mud
flats and, as it was impossible, from the nature of the country,
to get the pony further, I tethered it, and we tried to make the
river on foot. The position which we had selected was however so
unfavourable that we did not succeed in reaching the river, and
my wound became so painful that I was scarcely able to crawl back
to the pony.</p>

<p>We then returned to the tents, which we reached in the
afternoon, and I sent another party out to examine the country
and to see if they could find a more favourable position for the
tent where we might be less exposed to the mosquitoes. The
remainder of the men were employed in repairing the packsaddles
and in mending our shoes, which were in a very dilapidated
condition. The detached party, on their return, reported that
they could not find a more favourable position for the tents; and
that we appeared to be on a low marshy tongue of land which the
river nearly flowed round. We this day saw the tracks of an emu,
and of several large dogs, and kangaroos.</p>

<p>ASCEND A HILL.</p>

<p>March 4.</p>

<p>By sunrise I had gained the foot of the highest hill near our
encampment. It is a very remarkable rocky eminence; in height
above the immediate base it was only 250 feet, but it rose by a
regular steep slope from the river, which was distant about four
miles. I do not think therefore that its height above the level
of the sea was less than 800 feet. I was unable to ride up this
hill, from the rocky nature of the ground, which was composed of
a basalt resembling that of the Isle of France; its sides were
slightly wooded and clothed with a fine grass nearly as high as
myself. From the heaviness of the dew, walking through a river
would have been about as agreeable as walking through this grass;
but when I had reached the summit the view amply repaid me for
the trouble of the ascent.</p>

<p>VIEW OF THE GLENELG FROM IT.</p>

<p>The river flowed through a rich and fertile country at the
base of the hill, having in some places hereabouts a triple
channel formed by large and apparently fertile islands, and its
width must have been at least three or four miles; it however ran
away so much to the north-eastward that I began to fear it might
be a great salt-water inlet, communicating in some manner with
Prince Regent's River, and that we might thus find ourselves upon
a large island. I had a good view of the valley for 10 or 12
miles in an easterly direction over a country still very fertile,
but all that I saw tended to make me believe that the river had
some communication with the sea, somewhere towards the
north-east.</p>

<p>We reached the camp before breakfast; and, as this was Sunday
and our ponies were rapidly improving from the goodness of their
feed, I determined to halt here for a day or two whilst a
detachment examined the country to ascertain, if possible,
whether we were on an island or not, and whether it was possible
to cross the river near our present position.</p>

<p>March 5.</p>

<p>This morning accordingly an exploring party started; and, as
it was necessary that they should traverse the country on foot so
as to be able to cross the low marshy grounds near the river, I
was, on account of my wound, unable to accompany them, and
therefore occupied myself in making a set of magnetic
observations.</p>

<p>March 6.</p>

<p>This afternoon Mr. Lushington and the party returned, having
found the northern bank of the river to consist of low marshy
ground covered with a luxuriant vegetation, and in some places
with such forests of mangrove trees that it was impossible to
approach the stream. They however succeeded in reaching one of
the channels of the river, which was upwards of 400 yards wide;
the rise and fall of tide was here about twenty feet, and the
current, of course, extremely rapid. They reported the river as
being, to all appearance, navigable, and that the tide only set
in from the westward.</p>

<p>THE RIVER.</p>

<p>As the southern bank of the river was bordered by high rocky
hills they saw nothing of the country in that direction. Their
report was on the whole satisfactory, for it appeared that the
good country still extended along the northern bank, and that we
were upon the mainland.</p>

<p>PORPOISES SEEN.</p>

<p>A good idea may be formed of the size of the river where the
party made it from the circumstance of their seeing a large shoal
of porpoises.</p>

<p>IGUANA. DENSENESS OF VEGETATION.</p>

<p>March 7.</p>

<p>This morning we started early in a north-easterly direction
and travelled all day through a very fertile and picturesque
country. On our left lay hills covered with grass, and on our
right extensive plains, through which ran the Glenelg. The
vegetation in these was so luxuriant that it choked the fresh
water up; and whole plains were sometimes thus inundated ankle
deep. The country was thinly timbered, but in general the trees
were of a very great size: one particularly took my fancy, having
very large leaves about the colour of those of the
horse-chestnut, and which cast more shade around them than any
other which I have seen in Australia.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, as we were passing through a densely
vegetated bottom, we saw a very large iguana run up a tree. This
brute was of a beautiful green colour and five or six feet long;
it sat on the tree, making a noise somewhat like a snake, and was
the largest and ugliest of the lizard tribe which I have ever
seen on land. As we could make no use of it I thought it would be
wanton to kill it; so, after examining it as well as we could, we
moved on, leaving it undisturbed.</p>

<p>The black flies on this day changed their character, and
became much smaller than those I had hitherto seen.</p>

<p>March 8.</p>

<p>We made but little progress today on account of the denseness
of the vegetation, which was so luxuriant that we found great
difficulty in forcing our way through it; in several instances
indeed it was wholly impassable; and, after making an attempt to
penetrate through a jungle, we were obliged to turn about and
coast round it. The numerous streams we met with were also a
serious impediment, for many of these were so muddy and deep that
we had great difficulty in finding a place where we could
cross.</p>

<p>SIGNS OF NATIVES.</p>

<p>We halted for breakfast near a stream of this kind, under the
shade of a large group of the pandanus. This was evidently a
favourite haunt of the natives, who had been feeding upon the
almonds which this tree contains in its large complex fruit, and
to give a relish to their repast had mingled with it roasted
unios, or fresh-water mussels, which the stream produced in
abundance. The remains of some old spears were also lying about,
but the natives themselves were not visible.</p>

<p>Immediately after breakfast I ascended a hill to see if we
could in any way get clear of the deep stream on the banks of
which we had breakfasted. The Glenelg was distant about three
miles to the south, and I found that, in order to disengage
ourselves from the waters which almost encompassed us, we must
turn off to the north-west, and thus almost double back on our
former track, as there was no other resource. I returned at once
to the party, and we spent the rest of the day in crossing two
deep streams, and then proceeded about a mile to the eastward,
where we halted for the night on the bank of a rocky watercourse,
but not containing a drop of water. The timber today was larger
than I had yet seen it, affording many new kinds, and one in
particular, resembling in appearance and quality the English
ash.</p>

<p>March 9.</p>

<p>We moved through a low country, densely vegetated, and still
abounding in deep sluggish streams, almost unapproachable, on
account of a dwarf bamboo and other tropical plants which clothed
their margins. Some of these streams were twenty feet deep and
upwards, and looked more like canals than natural
watercourses.</p>

<p>CASCADE OF THE RIVER.</p>

<p>The point where we halted for the night was not very distant
from the river, for its roaring, as it forced itself over a
rapid, could be distinctly heard. As it was important to
ascertain if it ceased to be navigable at this point, as well as
whether it could be here forded or not, I ordered a party to
proceed at daylight and examine it, and in the interim we laid
down to enjoy such repose as myriads of mosquitoes would allow
us.</p>

<p>March 10.</p>

<p>The party started at dawn and did not return until the
afternoon. They arrived at low-water at a point where the river
formed a series of rapids and was apparently broken into several
channels; the one which they reached was not more than fifty or
sixty yards wide, the tide at low water being full seven or eight
feet below the level of the rocks which formed the rapids, but at
high-water it rose, judging from the marks on the rocks, as many
feet above them. This channel would therefore cease to be
navigable for vessels at this point, but large boats could
proceed up it at high-water. There was no apparent possibility of
our being able to pass it hereabouts on account of the great
rapidity of the current. The river continued fresh below the
rapids, and their account of the character of the country they
saw was most satisfactory.</p>

<p>INCONVENIENT HALTING PLACE.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after they had entered the camp the rain
began to fall in such torrents that it was impossible for us to
move; this was unfortunate for where we were halted was unfit for
a day's resting-place, and we should consequently be compelled to
move on Sunday morning instead of making it a day of perfect
rest. The point where the party made the river today was about
south latitude 15 degrees 41 minutes; east longitude 124 degrees
53 minutes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 9. TO THE UPPER GLENELG.</h2>

<p>WORKS OF NATIVE INDUSTRY.</p>

<p>March 11.</p>

<p>The country we traversed this morning was still marshy, and
intersected by deep streams. The party had yesterday fixed upon a
point for us to encamp at; but, a sudden inundation having taken
place, we could not cross a stream which lay between us and the
spot selected, so that we were compelled about noon to halt at a
position very ill adapted for our purpose.</p>

<p>VARIOUS TRACES OF NATIVES.</p>

<p>Close to our camp was a large mass of basaltic rocks, on which
the natives had lately been, and had left behind them a few old
spears: some drawings were also scratched upon the rocks,
representing heads, hands, and other parts of the human frame:
they were however indifferently executed.</p>

<p>Another branch of industry which had engaged their attention
was the manufacture of stone spearheads, the chips and remnants
of which were lying about on every side. As this looked very like
a preparation to give us a warm reception I kept upon the alert.
From constantly sleeping on the wet ground, and the exposure I
was obliged to undergo, such an attack of rheumatism had been
produced in my left hip and knee that I was not only crippled but
suffered such dreadful agony from my wounded limb that I was able
to pay but little attention to passing events.</p>

<p>I crept about however as well as I could, and found that we
were in a very populous neighbourhood. At one place a large party
of natives appeared to have lived for some time, twelve bark beds
having been left in a circle round a fire. In this respect they
differ in custom from the natives of the southern parts of
Australia, who generally sleep all of a heap, or, at least, four
or five persons together, whereas each individual here appeared
to occupy his own little bark bed. In the course of the morning's
march we had passed a very neat native oven, or fireplace, much
more carefully constructed than anything of the kind I have since
seen; it consisted of a hole sunk eight inches deep in the earth,
which was quite circular, three feet in diameter, and very neatly
paved and lined with flat stones; the last article cooked here
had been a large quantity of turtles' eggs, the remnants of which
were lying scattered all around. This is a dish by no means to be
despised; and the discovery was rather interesting to me as it
proved that turtle came so far up the river. It rained hard
during the greater part of the day.</p>

<p>March 12.</p>

<p>As we were preparing to start this morning one of the ponies
was found to be so knocked up as to be unable to proceed; I
therefore abandoned it, though, I fear, in a state too far gone
to recover; but if perfect rest and abundance of good feed and
water could effect a restoration it had still a fair chance.</p>

<p>DIFFICULTIES OF THE ROUTE.</p>

<p>A ford over the stream had yesterday been found between the
Glenelg and our encampment, which we now succeeded in getting the
ponies over, and, in order to avoid another stream, which had
been seen to the eastward, we turned north-east, but in about
three miles were again at fault, on the banks of a deep brook. I
now turned due north and, after tracing the stream for about a
mile, discovered a ford across which, after a due proportion of
sticking in the mud and falling with their loads in the deep
water, we led all the ponies, and found ourselves happily
established in a jungle on the other side of it. The vegetation
here consisted of grass and reeds which rose so high and thick
that I could see nothing over them, although there was rising
land within a mile of us.</p>

<p>We first endeavoured to push through this jungle in an
easterly direction; but, after having very resolutely made our
way onwards for about an hour, I saw some very high land to the
south-east of us, distant four or five miles, and therefore
changed the direction of our march to make for these hills; as
soon as we had gained a clear place in the jungle I halted for
breakfast, and, after resting for an hour, we continued,
notwithstanding the dreadful heat of the day, to move on, but
soon again came to a deep, sluggish stream which obliged us to
turn off to the north-east; and it was not until near nightfall
that we found a place where we could cross it.</p>

<p>MOUNT LYELL.</p>

<p>Having traversed the stream we proceeded to the foot of a very
lofty peak, the most remarkable hill in this part of the country,
and which I named Mount Lyell, after C. Lyell, Esquire. We here
pitched the tents, and scarcely was this operation performed ere
the rain fell in such torrents that the water stood even under
them to the depth of two or three inches, and yet the tents were
fixed in the best position that could be found. The night was
dark and stormy so that, even had a better place offered, it
would now have been useless to move; we therefore resigned
ourselves to our fate and lay down on our watery beds, which
possessed at least one merit, that they were free from
mosquitoes.</p>

<p>March 13.</p>

<p>Before the mists of morning had cleared away from the lofty
hills to the north-east of our encampment I had commenced their
ascent with a party of three men. To my great vexation, on taking
out the barometer at the bottom of the hill, it was broken, and I
could therefore no longer hope to be able to obtain the height of
remarkable elevations. I managed to ride the pony up the hill for
some time, but the broken and rocky nature of the ground obliged
me at last to walk, and I left the animal tethered in rich grass
higher than itself.</p>

<p>VIEW FROM IT. MAGNIFICENT PROSPECT.</p>

<p>When we gained the summit of the hill I found that in the
mists of the morning we had ascended the wrong peak. The one we
stood on was composed of basalt and at least twelve hundred feet
high; but Mount Lyell, another peak springing from the same
range, and not more than a mile to the eastward, must have been
four or five hundred feet higher. It was moreover distinguished
by a very remarkable feature, namely, a regular circle, as it
were, drawn round the peak, some two hundred feet below the
summit, and above this ring no trees grew; the conical peak which
reared its head above the region of trees being only clothed with
the greenest grass, whilst that on which I stood and all the
others I could see were thinly wooded to their very summits.</p>

<p>The peak we had ascended afforded us a very beautiful view: to
the north lay Prince Regent's River, and the good country we were
now upon extended as far as the inlets which communicated with
this great navigable stream; to the south and south-westward ran
the Glenelg, meandering through as verdant and fertile a district
as the eye of man ever rested on. The luxuriance of tropical
vegetation was now seen to the greatest advantage, in the height
of the rainy season. The smoke of native fires rose in various
directions from the country, which lay like a map at our feet;
and when I recollected that all these natural riches of soil and
climate lay between two navigable rivers, and that its sea-coast
frontage, not much exceeding fifty miles in latitude, contained
three of the finest harbours in the world, in each of which the
tide rose and fell thirty-seven and a half feet, I could not but
feel we were in a land singularly favoured by nature.</p>

<p>CONTINUATION OF ROUTE. TORRENTS OF RAIN.</p>

<p>I remained for some time on the summit of this hill, enjoying
the prospect, and taking bearings. When this operation was
completed we returned to the camp and prepared once more to
proceed upon our route; but, to our misfortune, had not made more
than two or three miles through a fertile country when the rain
again fell in such torrents that we were compelled to halt.
Indeed none but those who have been in tropical countries can at
all conceive with what suddenness and force these storms burst
upon us.</p>

<p>March 14.</p>

<p>We this morning made an attempt to get clear of the marshes by
following a south-easterly course, and were thus forced up into a
range of lofty basaltic mountains, the slopes of which were of
the richest description. Had our ponies been provided with shoes
we could have travelled here with great speed and facility, but
the higher land was invariably covered with sharp pebbles over
which the unshod ponies could only move with pain and difficulty.
When however we had gained the summit of the range the view from
it was similar to that which I have just described. Mount
Wellington and Mount Trafalgar formed splendid objects, rearing
their bold rocky heads over St. George's Basin, which now bore
the appearance of being a vast lake. The pleasure of the prospect
was however in my eyes somewhat diminished from seeing on the
other side of the range so considerable a stream that I
anticipated great difficulty in crossing it; I therefore steered
a course somewhat more southerly than our former route and,
having reached the extremity of the range, we once more descended
into the fertile lowlands.</p>

<p>GLENELG RIVER.</p>

<p>Along these our course continued through an uninterrupted
succession of rich flats, thinly wooded but luxuriantly grassed,
until near sunset, when, as we were about descending the brow of
a low hill, I found that the Glenelg, having made a sudden turn,
was close to us, whilst in our front, and completely blocking up
our passage, there was a very large tributary which joined the
river from the north-east; I therefore halted the party here for
the night, and at once proceeded down to the river.</p>

<p>It was quite fresh and running at the rate of more than five
knots an hour; the bed was composed of fine white sand, and even
close to the margin it was 2 1/2 fathoms in depth. The trees
which bordered it were of a gigantic height and size, I think the
largest that I have seen in Australia; whilst it was almost
impossible to get down to the stream, from the denseness of the
vegetation on its banks. Before we reached the main channel of
the river we had several smaller ones to cross, but of very
insignificant depth.</p>

<p>I stood for some time watching this dark turbid stream
sweeping rapidly along, and could not but wonder where so great a
body of water could have its source. I had then seen no other
Australian rivers, but judging from description this differed
widely from them all.</p>

<p>I have since visited many of the most noted Australian streams
and found this distinguished by many peculiar characteristics;
nor would I hesitate to say that, with exception perhaps of the
Murray, it will be found the most important on that continent;
and, taking into consideration its geographical position, the
fertility of the country on its banks, as far as it is yet known,
and the rise and fall of tide, it may perhaps not yield in
consideration even to the Murray.</p>

<p>TORRENTS OF RAIN.</p>

<p>I now examined the tributary stream which here joined the
Glenelg, and to my chagrin found that it was so much swollen by
the late rains as to be utterly impassable. To attempt to
construct a bridge over it would have been useless for the
adjacent ground was now so swampy the horses were bogged before
we got them near it. I wandered up its banks as far as I could
before nightfall, but could not succeed in finding any place in
our vicinity at which we might hope to effect our passage. Just
as it got dark the rain again began to pour in torrents; thus, if
possible, rendering our position worse than before, and I
returned late to the tents much dispirited at the unfavourable
weather we had encountered.</p>

<p>RISE OF THE WATERS. MARKS OF INUNDATIONS.</p>

<p>On going down to the Glenelg the next morning I found it so
swollen by the heavy rain of the preceding night as to render it
impossible to get near the main bed. The river was now far beyond
its banks, and in the forks of the trees above our heads we saw
driftwood, reeds, dead grass, etc., lodged at least fifteen feet
higher than the present level; and which could only have been
left there during some great flood. Whether these had frequently
recurred we had of course no means of judging, but during such
floods the whole of the very low country which we here saw to the
south-west of us must be inundated. I need scarcely add that in a
tropical country no ground could be conceived better adapted to
the growth of rice than the extensive levels which border the
Glenelg.</p>

<p>A detached party now went of to search for a route by which we
could proceed. The stock-keeper came and reported that the sheep
were suffering greatly from the continued rain and exposure to
wet, several of them having died during the night; only five were
thus left alive out of the number we started with, and, one of
these being in a drooping state, I had it killed that we might
not lose the advantage of it altogether.</p>

<p>NATIVES.</p>

<p>Immediately on the other side of the tributary stream which
lay to the south of us there rose a high precipitous sandy range,
similar to those we had fallen in with on first landing. This
range completely overlooked our encampment from a distance, and
on it a party of natives had posted themselves. We saw the smoke
of their fires and heard their own cries and the yelling of their
dogs; and with the help of my telescope I once distinguished
their dusky forms moving about in the bush.</p>

<p>COCKATOOS.</p>

<p>A large flight of cockatoos which lay between us and them were
kept in a constant state of screaming anxiety from the movements
of one or the other party, and at last found their position so
unpleasant that they evacuated it and flew off to some more quiet
roosting-place. Their departure however was a serious loss to us,
as they played somewhat the same part that the geese once did in
the Capitol; for whenever our sable neighbours made the slightest
movement the watchful sentinels of the cockatoos instantly
detected it and, by stretching out their crests, screaming,
standing on their toes on the highest trees, with their wings
spread abroad to support them, and peering eagerly in the
direction where the movement was made, they gave us faithful
intimation of every motion.</p>

<p>When therefore this advanced guard took unto themselves wings
and flew away I was obliged to keep all hands on the alert to
prevent a surprise. Whilst we were thus occupied our detachment
returned and reported the country to be utterly impracticable. I
determined however to examine it myself the next morning in order
to be quite satisfied upon so important a point.</p>

<p>March 16.</p>

<p>I moved off at dawn this morning with a party, but after
following the direction of the stream for several miles I found
that the whole of the land between it and the foot of the hills
had been rendered by the heavy rains a marsh quite impassable for
horses, which was rendered the more annoying as the swamp was not
more than a mile in width, so that this slight space alone
prevented us from pursuing our desired route. Nothing however was
now left us but to turn once more to the north-west, and thus to
endeavour to head the marsh.</p>

<p>DANGER FROM NATIVES.</p>

<p>Just as we had prepared to return home the cries of the
natives arose close to us; their fire was about half a mile away,
and their calls had already several times been heard. Now that
they were so near us I thought it better to load my second barrel
with ball, for I did not like their hanging about us in the way
they had done for several days. On putting my hand into my
haversack in order to prepare some ammunition I found, to my
great dismay, that I had taken in mistake one which belonged to
another man and which contained no ammunition; nor was there a
ball in possession of any person with me which would fit my gun
and, as I knew that the aim of those with me was not much to be
depended on, even under the coolest and most favourable
circumstances, I thought that in the moment of a desperate attack
it might be still less sure; this, added to the want of
confidence incident on finding oneself unarmed and dependent on
the protection of others, made me feel very uncomfortable until
we once more reached the tents.</p>

<p>RAINS CONTINUE. TORRENTS OF RAIN.</p>

<p>During the early part of the day the rain fell in torrents;
but, as it cleared off a little soon after our arrival, we
started in a north-westerly direction. Such violent storms of
thunder, lightning, and rain set in when we had made about two or
three miles that I was again obliged to halt; and as it continued
to rain heavily throughout the night, our situation, which was
already bad, might now be said to be hourly growing worse; and it
can readily be conceived that, between rheumatism in my wounded
limb, lying in water, and vexation at the constant difficulties
we experienced, I was too much harassed to be able to sleep.</p>

<p>SWAMPS.</p>

<p>The continued rain during the night had necessarily rendered
the marsh far more impracticable than before; but, as no other
route to the southward could be found on account of the river
which lay upon either hand, I was compelled to wait until the
ground again in some measure dried. But it would have been
equally as impossible to beat a retreat as it was to get forward,
for we were in a manner surrounded by swampy land, and when the
loads were placed upon the ponies they sank nearly up to the
shoulders in a bog in whichever direction we attempted to move;
but as our present position would have been unsafe in the event
of an extensive inundation taking place I judged it necessary at
all events to reach a somewhat elevated outlying hill of
sandstone which was distant about two miles. This point we
succeeded at last in gaining, although not without severely
injuring and straining some of the ponies in effecting it. This
rising ground was however well situated for our camp under
present circumstances: it was composed of porous sandstone, which
in these climates dries almost immediately after rain. There was
plenty of dead wood upon it and it was surrounded by
richly-grassed flats, whilst from the base gushed forth a clear
spring, which then murmured along a purling brook, traversing the
flat on which the ponies were tethered.</p>

<p>SNAKE AND KANGAROO.</p>

<p>Close to this spot the attention of Mr. Lushington was drawn
to a curious misshapen mass which came advancing from some bushes
with a novel and uncouth motion. He fired and it fell, and on
going up to it he found that it was a small kangaroo enveloped in
the folds of a large snake, a species of Boa. The kangaroo was
now quite dead, and flattened from the pressure of the folds of
the snake which, being surprised at the disturbance it met with,
was beginning to uncoil itself, when Mr. Lushington drew out a
pistol and shot it through the head. It was of a brownish yellow
colour and eight feet six inches long. The kangaroo we found very
good eating; and Mr. Walker, who ate a portion of the snake,
considered it to be as great a delicacy as an eel, but rather
tougher.</p>

<p>There fortunately was an elevated pinnacle of rocks on the
rising ground upon which we were encamped; and from the top of
these I was able in the course of the day to get bearings and
angles to many important objects; I could also see many fixed
points in my survey, so that the day could not be considered as
altogether a lost one.</p>

<p>CONDITION OF THE PONIES.</p>

<p>March 18.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of this day the rain poured in torrents
so that the ponies, notwithstanding the goodness of the feed,
began again to suffer from cold and exposure to the weather. They
were so wild that we could not venture to let them run loose,
and, as it was impossible to tether all of them under trees, the
majority were left exposed to the pitiless pelting of the storms;
and they certainly made a very wretched appearance as they stood
with their sterns presented to the blast, and the water pouring
from their sides in perfect streams. I do not know whether this
was a very extraordinary season, but it is certain that if all
rainy periods in North-West Australia resemble it, to attempt to
explore the country at this time of the year would be fruitless.
Such a good supply of rain is a great advantage to an occupied
country through which regular lines of communication exist; as it
then raises but slight impediments to travellers; but the case is
very different to first explorers who have to find a ford over
every stream and a passage across every swamp, and who constantly
run the risk of involving themselves in a perfectly impassable
region.</p>

<p>NATIVES NEAR THE CAMP.</p>

<p>March 19.</p>

<p>This morning was also ushered in with torrents of rain,
chequered by occasional intervals of fine weather of perhaps half
an hour's duration. Another sheep died and several of the ponies
were very unwell. The men who had been shifting the tethers of
the horses at noon returned with the intelligence that, during
the period of their absence from the encampment, a party of
natives must have been close to us, watching our movements, for
that when they went out there were no traces of them near the
camp, which were now discernible in nearly every direction around
us.</p>

<p>I selected the best bushman of my party and went off to see
whether anything was to be apprehended from these natives, but I
soon found that the report was in some degree exaggerated. Some
natives had crept up to within about a hundred yards of us,
probably with the intention of making a reconnaissance, and of
then framing their future plans; they had however been disturbed
by the return of the men from the horses, and then made off. It
appears that they had approached us by walking up a stream of
water so as to conceal their trail, and then turned out of the
stream up its right bank; and although they had carefully trod in
one another's foot-marks, so as to conceal their number, we could
make out the traces of at least six or seven different men, which
we followed to the spot where, whilst creeping about to watch us,
they had been disturbed. From this point these children of the
bush had disappeared, as it were by magic: not a twig was broken,
not a stone was turned, and we could not perceive that the heavy
drops of rain had been shaken from a single blade of grass. We
made wide casts in different directions but, not being able to
hit on their trail, I returned to the tents, more than ever
convinced of the necessity of being constantly on the watch
against beings who were often near us when we least dreamt of
their presence, and, in an unguarded moment, might so easily
surprise and spear some of the party.</p>

<p>APPEARANCE OF THE COUNTRY.</p>

<p>The rain continued to fall throughout the 20th, rendering our
condition every hour worse. Towards noon however the weather
cleared a little, and in a fine interval I mounted a high range
of basaltic hills which lay about a mile and a half to the
westward. These hills were the highest which I had yet ascended;
and from them I gained a very extensive view. The farthest
extremity of the sandstone range which lay to the southward and
eastward did not appear to be more than ten or twelve miles
distant. Behind this barren range there again rose the conical
tops of basaltic hills, clothed in the greenest grass; and beyond
these, in the far south-east, I made out with the telescope a
range of very lofty hills, which, stretching their heads high
into the clouds, left me without means of forming any idea of
their elevation: but even the portion of them which met my view
must have had a very considerable altitude. I took a set of
angles from this point but the mistiness of the day rendered it
very unfit for my purpose. Whilst I was thus occupied, we heard
the cries and calls of a party of natives between us and the
tents. From the loudness and proximity of these I augured badly
and therefore hurried my return; but we neither saw the natives
themselves nor their tracks, and were quite in ignorance as to
what had been their intentions. Soon after sunset the weather
cleared up a little, and the stars, which came peeping out,
promised well for the next day.</p>

<p>NATIVES NEAR THE CAMP AGAIN.</p>

<p>March 21.</p>

<p>Although it had rained during the night and the sun this
morning rose bright and clear the country was still impassable
owing to the late continued torrents. I therefore went out with a
detachment for the purpose of exploring a route by which we could
proceed the next day, as well as to define some more points in
the country we were about to enter. In the course of our walk we
crossed the track of the natives we had heard yesterday. Their
party must have been large, for they approached to within about
three hundred yards of the tents, leaving a trail as broad and
large as was made by our ponies and party together. I did not
much like their hanging about us for so many days as I rather
mistrusted their intentions; their object however appeared to
have been to examine the ponies, for they had only come as far as
the tethering ground and, after wandering about there a little,
had again retired. We were unfortunate in our search for a good
line of country by which to proceed, but I made some important
additions to my map.</p>

<p>MARSH AND SANDSTONE RANGE.</p>

<p>March 22.</p>

<p>As fine weather had apparently set in again we this morning
resumed our journey. The poor ponies looked very weak and
wretched when they were brought up to start, and we were all
ragged, dirty, and worn out from the constant exposure to wind
and rain; indeed our appearance was altogether very miserable on
moving off, and our progress, too, very slow and fatiguing, both
to ourselves and the horses, on account of the swampy nature of
the ground; but we strenuously persevered until near noon, when I
halted for breakfast at the foot of some lofty hills, at the base
of which ran the stream which was giving us so much trouble. As
soon as we had despatched our scanty breakfast I tried with a
party to find a passage across the marsh, but our search was in
vain and, on examining the sandstone range on the other side of
the stream, I found it so precipitous that our weak ponies could
not possibly have clambered up it.</p>

<p>NATIVE BRIDGE.</p>

<p>Whilst on our return we found a native bridge, formed of a
fallen tree, which rested against two others and was secured in
its position by forked boughs.</p>

<p>PRECIPITOUS PASS.</p>

<p>I was thus obliged to continue to travel in a north-east
direction for the remainder of the afternoon, when we found, at
last, a passage over the marsh, but made vain attempts to cross
the sandstone range in no less than four different places; the
ponies were so weak and the route so precipitous that each time
we were obliged to return. At length we reached the watershed,
from one side of which the streams ran down to Prince Regent's
River, and from the other to the Glenelg; the rocks on the south
side were ancient sandstone resting on basalt, and on the
opposite the basalt crept out, forming elevated hills. This
position was remarkable both in a geological and geographical
point of view; and, the sandstone range over against us looking
rather more accessible than it had previously done, I determined
to halt here for the night and examine the country; but my
resolution was scarcely formed ere such heavy storms of rain,
accompanied by thunder and lightning, came on as totally to
prevent me from seeing to any distance or taking any
bearings.</p>

<p>On entering the old red sandstone district again the parakeets
became once more common, and the green ants reappeared. These
last seem to be solely confined to the sandstone, for I did not
see one without its limits.</p>

<p>ASCENT OF THE SANDSTONE RANGE.</p>

<p>March 23.</p>

<p>This morning we made a more fortunate effort to ascend the
sandstone range which had yesterday so baffled our efforts; and
having commenced the ascent at 6 A.M. reached the summit at 10,
but the poor little ponies were dreadfully exhausted. Having now
established ourselves upon this narrow elevated tableland the
next thing was to descend on the other side. The prospect to the
southward and eastward was not very cheering, for before we could
make any further progress in either of those directions we had a
perfect precipice to get down, at the foot of which lay a
beautiful and verdant valley about three miles wide, diversified
with wood and water; whilst a large cascade which could be seen
falling in a dark forest on the other side added much to the
scenery. Beyond the valley rose again rocky sandstone ranges, but
I knew that the width of these was inconsiderable.</p>

<p>DESCENT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE.</p>

<p>After a very tedious search we discovered a sort of pass
leading diagonally down the face of the precipice; but before
attempting to take the ponies over this it was necessary to move
many large rocks and stones, to cut down trees, and otherwise
make it practicable for them. All hands however set cheerfully to
work, and by 1 P.M. the whole party had safely reached the bottom
of the precipice. The valley that we were in was very fertile
but, from the incessant rain which had lately fallen, the centre
part of it had become an impassable swamp, and we were thus once
more obliged to turn to the northward in order to travel round
it: but as rest and food were necessary both for horses and men
we halted at the foot of the sandstone range for breakfast.</p>

<p>REMARKABLE FRILLED LIZARD. BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY.</p>

<p>As we were pursuing our route in the afternoon we fell in with
a specimen of the remarkable frilled lizard (Chlamydosaurus
kingii); this animal measures about twenty-four inches from the
tip of the nose to the point of its tail, and lives principally
in trees, although it can run very swiftly along the ground: when
not provoked or disturbed it moves quietly about, with its frill
lying back in plaits upon the body: but it is very irascible and,
directly it is frightened, elevates the frill or ruff and makes
for a tree; where if overtaken it throws itself upon its stern,
raising its head and chest as high as it can upon the forelegs,
then doubling its tail underneath the body and displaying a very
formidable set of teeth. From the concavity of its large frill it
boldly faces any opponent, biting fiercely whatever is presented
to it, and even venturing so far in its rage as to fairly make a
fierce charge at its enemy. We repeatedly tried the courage of
this lizard, and it certainly fought bravely whenever attacked.
From the animal making so much use of this frill as a covering
and means of defence for its body this is most probably one of
the uses to which nature intended the appendage should be
applied.</p>

<p>We at length reached the watershed connecting the country we
had left with that we were entering upon, and were now again
enabled to turn to the eastward and thus to travel round the
swamp. This watershed consisted principally of a range of
elevated hills from which streams were thrown off to the Glenelg
and to Prince Regent's River. The scenery here was very fine, but
I have so often before described the same character of landscape
that it will be sufficient to say we again looked down from high
land on a very fertile country, covered with a tropical
vegetation and lying between two navigable rivers. I can compare
this to no other Australian scenery, for I have met with nothing
in the other portions of the continent which at all resembles it.
When we had nearly headed the valley the night closed in so
rapidly on us that I was obliged to halt the party; and by the
time the arrangements for security and rest were completed it was
quite dark.</p>

<p>CURIOUS NEST.</p>

<p>March 24.</p>

<p>This morning we started as soon as it was light and,
continuing our route round the valley, passed the beautiful
cascade seen yesterday and, after fording a clear running brook
like an English trout stream, we began to ascend the next
sandstone range. On gaining the summit we fell in with a very
remarkable nest, or what appeared to me to be such, and which I
shall describe more particularly when I advert to the natural
history of this part of the country. We had previously seen
several of them, and they had always afforded us food for
conjecture as to the agent and purpose of such singular
structures.</p>

<p>DEEP VALLEY.</p>

<p>Soon after quitting this nest we found a very convenient pass
through a deep and fertile valley, which led directly up into the
heart of the sandstone range; a fine stream ran through it in
which were several large reservoirs of fresh water; the hills on
each side were lofty, being at times of a rounded character, and
at others broken into precipitous and fantastic cliffs; the
country was thinly wooded with large timber, and the varied
scenery, the facility which the country afforded for travelling,
and the pleasure incident on finding ourselves clear of the
marshy ground which had so long encumbered our movements,
combined to make me push along as fast as possible; the only
check was the heat of the sun; and it should always be borne in
mind that no parallel whatever can be instituted between travels
in tropical and extra-tropical Australia, for in the former the
more exhausting nature of the climate unfits both men and horses
for making long journeys, and indeed renders it almost impossible
to travel during the heat of the day, whilst the difficult nature
of the ground caused by the dense vegetation, the jungles, the
ravines, and marshes, render it altogether impracticable to move
at night through an unknown country.</p>

<p>WILD OATS.</p>

<p>We crossed during the day several recent tracks of natives but
did not fall in with the natives themselves; we also saw many
kangaroos, and halted for the night on an elevated basaltic
ridge, at a point close to which there was a large crop of the
grain which we called wild oats. This is a remarkable vegetable
production, growing to the height of from five to six feet; in
the stalk, the shape, and mode of insertion of the leaves it is
similar to the oat of Europe; the manner in which the seeds grow
in the two plants is also the same, and the seeds are nearly of
the same size, but the Australian oat is furnished with a beard
like the barley. When hungry I have repeatedly eaten these oats,
which in some parts grow in such abundance that several acres of
them might be mown at once; and I have little doubt that this
plant would with cultivation turn out to be a very great addition
to our tropical grains.*</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. I am informed that the seeds of it which
I introduced into the Isle of France in 1838 have greatly
multiplied and that the plants are in a very flourishing
state.)</blockquote>

<p>March 25.</p>

<p>This morning we resumed our journey, crossing a succession of
basaltic valleys. The vegetation was luxuriant beyond
description; and it was ludicrous to see the heavy-tailed
kangaroos leaping and floundering about in the long grass when
they had quitted their beaten pathways and were suddenly
disturbed by our approach.</p>

<p>CURIOUS BIRDS.</p>

<p>In crossing the second of these large valleys we saw two large
white and black birds, more like pelicans than any other kind I
am acquainted with; they had webbed feet, and the colour and form
of their body resembled that of the pelican, but the head and
beak were very different; after flying two or three times round
our heads, well out of shot, so as to have a good peep at us,
they flew away, and for the first and last time I saw this
curious bird.</p>

<p>We now ascended a ridge of sandstone tableland which crossed
our route: this was about three miles in width, and at its
southern extremity were two lofty basaltic hills, from between
which a small valley led down into another very large one that
was the general receptacle of the streams which came pouring in
from all directions. This last might be considered as a good type
of the valleys in this portion of the country: at its northern
extremity it was about four miles wide, being bounded on all
sides by rocky wooded ranges with dark gullies from which
numerous streams and springs poured forth their watery
contributions to the main one. This last ran nearly down the
centre of the principal valley, the width of which gradually
contracted towards the south, where it terminated almost in a
point, having a narrow lateral opening at the south-west end of
not more than a quarter of a mile wide, and bounded by steep
cliffs on each side, so as to form a perfect gorge, the direction
of which was due west. In about a mile and a half this gorge met
a cross valley, running from the south to the north, down which
the waters were poured, so as to run back as it were upon their
former course.</p>

<p>BASALTIC VALLEY.</p>

<p>We halted for the day in the main valley, which from the run
of the waters above described must necessarily have been very
elevated; it was, moreover, nearly level, forming indeed a sort
of enclosed plateau, so that the streams, which both on entering
and quitting it ran bubbling merrily along, preserved whilst in
it a sluggish and scarcely perceptible course. When to this I add
that it was composed of basaltic rocks and received the deposit
of such an extent of elevated basaltic land I need scarcely add
that it was highly fertile. I believe that these valleys, which
are very common in North-Western Australia and contain from four
to five thousand acres each, are as rich as any other spots upon
the globe, and moreover possess the great advantage of being
situated close to navigable rivers.</p>

<p>March 26.</p>

<p>This morning we moved down the valley in which we had been
encamped yesterday and, as it was thinly wooded, we experienced
no difficulty whatever until the main stream suddenly turned off
from south to due west; this was a sufficient proof that the
gorge of the valley was on its western side, but I was not
anxious to follow the course of the water, from the apprehension
of being led into low and marshy land; I thought also that a low
ridge which I saw to the south could easily be crossed, and that
we should thus gain access to a valley similar to that we were
in. I therefore resolved to cross the stream at the first ford we
could find, and after a little trouble we discovered one suited
to our purpose through which the ponies passed in safety.</p>

<p>IMPASSABLE SANDSTONE RANGE.</p>

<p>We then continued our route in a due southerly direction until
we reached the low range which I had before seen; this range
turned out to be composed of sandstone, and where we made it it
was so rocky and precipitous as to be quite impracticable. We
therefore travelled along it in an easterly direction for about
three miles, but throughout this distance it presented no single
pass through which I could hope to penetrate. The sun having now
become very powerful we halted for breakfast; and whilst this
meal was preparing, I sent out a detached party to search for a
road, which soon returned to report that they were able to find
no path by which we could proceed.</p>

<p>I did not however like to retrace our footsteps without having
made a careful search; and although my wound was still open and
very painful I rapidly swallowed a portion of my allowance of
damper and started with another detachment on foot to examine the
country. The sandstone range, which ran nearly east and west, was
terminated everywhere throughout its southern side by perfectly
precipitous rocks, at the foot of which lay a fertile valley,
resembling the one in which we had encamped yesterday except that
it was on a much lower level. The position that we were in
appeared to be the pass by which the natives communicated with
the country to the south of us, for marks of them were visible
everywhere about, but they could easily clamber about these
precipitous rocks, though it was quite impossible to get the
ponies down, even by forming a path, as we had often previously
done.</p>

<p>PAINTED CAVE. DRAWING ON ROOF OF A CAVE.</p>

<p>Finding that it would be useless to lose more time in
searching for a route through this country I proceeded to rejoin
the party once more; but whilst returning to them my attention
was drawn to the numerous remains of native fires and encampments
which we met with, till at last, on looking over some bushes at
the sandstone rocks which were above us, I suddenly saw from one
of them a most extraordinary large figure peering down upon me.
Upon examination this proved to be a drawing at the entrance to a
cave, which on entering I found to contain, besides, many
remarkable paintings.</p>

<p>The cave appeared to be a natural hollow in the sandstone
rocks; its floor was elevated about five feet from the ground,
and numerous flat broken pieces of the same rock, which were
scattered about, looked at a distance like steps leading up to
the cave, which was thirty-five feet wide at the entrance and
sixteen feet deep; but beyond this several small branches ran
further back. Its height in front was rather more than eight
feet, the roof being formed by a solid slab of sandstone about
nine feet thick and which rapidly inclined towards the back of
the cave, which was there not more than five feet high.</p>

<p><b>15.1. Figure drawn on the roof of Cave, discovered March
26th.</b></p>
</center>

<p>On this sloping roof the principal figure (Number 1) which I
have just alluded to, was drawn; in order to produce the greater
effect the rock about it was painted black and the figure itself
coloured with the most vivid red and white. It thus appeared to
stand out from the rock; and I was certainly rather surprised at
the moment that I first saw this gigantic head and upper part of
a body bending over and staring grimly down at me.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to convey in words an adequate idea of
this uncouth and savage figure; I shall therefore only give such
a succinct account of this and the other paintings as will serve
as a sort of description to accompany the annexed plates. The
dimensions of the figure were:</p>

<p>Length of head and face 2 feet.<br>
Width of face 17 inches.<br>
Length from bottom of face to navel 2 feet 6 inches.</p>

<p>Its head was encircled by bright red rays, something like the
rays which one sees proceeding from the sun when depicted on the
sign-board of a public house; inside of this came a broad stripe
of very brilliant red, which was coped by lines of white, but
both inside and outside of this red space were narrow stripes of
a still deeper red, intended probably to mark its boundaries; the
face was painted vividly white, and the eyes black, being however
surrounded by red and yellow lines; the body, hands, and arms
were outlined in red, the body being curiously painted with red
stripes and bars.</p>

<p>DRAWING OF FOUR HEADS.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="grey1-17"></a><img alt="" src="/ebooks/e00054-images/grey1-17.jpg"></p>

<p><b>15.2. Figure drawn on side of Cave, discovered March
26th.</b></p>
</center>

<p>Upon the rock which formed the left hand wall of this cave,
and which partly faced you on entering, was a very singular
painting (Number 2) vividly coloured, representing four heads
joined together. From the mild expression of the countenances I
imagined them to represent females, and they appeared to be drawn
in such a manner and in such a position as to look up at the
principal figure which I have before described; each had a very
remarkable head-dress, coloured with a deep bright blue, and one
had a necklace on. Both of the lower figures had a sort of dress
painted with red in the same manner as that of the principal
figure, and one of them had a band round her waist. Each of the
four faces was marked by a totally distinct expression of
countenance, and, although none of them had mouths, two, I
thought, were otherwise rather good looking. The whole painting
was executed on a white ground, and its dimensions were:</p>

<p>Total length of painting 3 feet 6 3/4 inches.<br>
Breadth across two upper heads 2 feet 6 inches.<br>
Ditto across the two lower ones 3 feet 1 1/2 inches.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="grey1-18"></a><img alt="" src="/ebooks/e00054-images/grey1-18.jpg"></p>

<p><b>15.3. Oval drawing in Cave, discovered March 26th.</b></p>
</center>

<p>The next most remarkable drawing in the cave (Number 3) was an
ellipse, three feet in length and one foot ten inches in breadth:
the outside line of this painting was of a deep blue colour, the
body of the ellipse being of a bright yellow dotted over with red
lines and spots, whilst across it ran two transverse lines of
blue. The portion of the painting above described formed the
ground, or main part of the picture, and upon this ground was
painted a kangaroo in the act of feeding, two stone spearheads,
and two black balls; one of the spearheads was flying to the
kangaroo, and one away from it; so that the whole subject
probably constituted a sort of charm by which the luck of an
enquirer in killing game could be ascertained.</p>

<p>TWO OTHER DRAWINGS.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="grey1-19"></a><img alt="" src="/ebooks/e00054-images/grey1-19.jpg"></p>

<p><b>15.4. Figure drawn in Cave, discovered March 26th.</b></p>
</center>

<p>There was another rather humorous sketch (Number 4) which
represented a native in the act of carrying a kangaroo; the
height of the man being three feet. The number of drawings in the
cave could not altogether have been less than from fifty to
sixty, but the majority of them consisted of men, kangaroos,
etc.; the figures being carelessly and badly executed and having
evidently a very different origin to those which I have first
described. Another very striking piece of art was exhibited in
the little gloomy cavities situated at the back of the main
cavern. In these instances some rock at the sides of the cavity
had been selected, and the stamp of a hand and arm by some means
transferred to it; this outline of the hand and arm was then
painted black, and the rock about it white, so that on entering
that part of the cave it appeared as if a human hand and arm were
projecting through a crevice admitting light.</p>

<p>After having discovered this cave I returned to the party and,
directing them to prepare for moving on, I ordered that as soon
as all was ready they should proceed past the cave, so that all
would have an opportunity of examining it, and in the meantime I
returned in order to make sketches of the principal paintings.
The party soon arrived and, when my sketches and notes were
completed, we retraced a portion of our route of this morning,
moving round the sandstone ridge through one portion of which I
saw a sort of pass which I thought might perhaps afford us a
means of egress. I therefore halted the party and moved up with
Corporal Auger to examine it. After proceeding some distance we
found a cave larger than the one seen this morning; of its actual
size however I have no idea, for being pressed for time I did not
attempt to explore it, having merely ascertained that it
contained no paintings.</p>

<p>INTAGLIO CUT IN A ROCK.</p>

<p>I was moving on when we observed the profile of a human face
and head cut out in a sandstone rock which fronted the cave; this
rock was so hard that to have removed such a large portion of it
with no better tool than a knife and hatchet made of stone, such
as the Australian natives generally possess, would have been a
work of very great labour. The head was two feet in length, and
sixteen inches in breadth in the broadest part; the depth of the
profile increased gradually from the edges where it was nothing,
to the centre where it was an inch and a half; the ear was rather
badly placed, but otherwise the whole of the work was good, and
far superior to what a savage race could be supposed capable of
executing. The only proof of antiquity that it bore about it was
that all the edges of the cutting were rounded and perfectly
smooth, much more so than they could have been from any other
cause than long exposure to atmospheric influences.</p>

<p>ROUTE CONTINUED. HIGH GRASS.</p>

<p><b>16. Head cut in Sandstone Rock. Captain Grey, delt. G.

</center>

<p>After having made a sketch of this head (see the accompanying
plate) I returned to the party and, as I had not been able to
find a path which would lead us across the sandstone ridge, we
continued our course round it, retracing our steps until we
reached the stream which had been crossed this morning, and then
moved westward, keeping along its southern bank until we had
turned the sandstone range and reached another stream running
from the south, which we traced up in the direction of its
source, travelling through a series of basaltic valleys of so
luxuriant a character that those of the party who were not very
tall travelled, as they themselves expressed it, between two high
green walls, over which they could not see; and these green walls
were composed of rich grass which the ponies ate with avidity. On
a subsequent occasion when we visited this valley we had to call
to one another in order to ascertain our relative positions when
only a few yards apart; and yet the vegetation was neither rank
nor coarse, but as fine a grass as I have ever seen.</p>

<p>REFLECTIONS.</p>

<p>We halted for the night in one of these lovely valleys; a
clear stream bubbled along within about fifty yards of us and,
about a mile beyond, two darkly-wooded basaltic hills raised
their heads, and between these and the stream our ponies were
feeding in grass higher than themselves. I sat in the fading
light, looking at the beautiful scenery around me, which now for
the first time gladdened the eyes of Europeans; and I wondered
that so fair a land should only be the abode of savage men; and
then I thought of the curious paintings we had this day seen, of
the timid character of the natives, of their anomalous position
in so fertile a country, and wondered how long these things were
to be. With so wide a field of conjecture before me, thought
naturally thronged on thought, and the night was far advanced ere
I laid down to seek repose from the fatigues of the day.</p>

<p>DEEP STREAM.</p>

<p>March 27.</p>

<p>The ponies having been routed out of their long and excellent
feed, amongst which indeed it was no easy matter to find them, we
moved on. I could not but reflect how different our position and
the condition of the ponies would have been had we known as much
of the country at first starting as we did at present; but these
reflections were now useless. With the exception of one small
rocky valley, the whole of our morning's journey was through a
rich and fertile country until we reached a deep stream, thirty
or forty yards wide and apparently navigable for large boats up
to this point; it ran away to the westward, but with a current
scarcely perceptible.</p>

<p>DIFFICULT APPROACH TO IT.</p>

<p>It was very difficult to approach this stream on account of
the marshy nature of its banks, which were overgrown with bamboo
and, even if we could have got the ponies to it, it was not
fordable here. We therefore turned up it in an easterly direction
to look for a passage over it; and in so doing were necessarily
compelled to cross many smaller streams and a great deal of
swampy ground in which some of the most weakly of the ponies got
bogged and were only extricated with great difficulty. However
annoying this was I could not but smile at the distress of some
of the men, who had contracted a friendship for the animals they
had so long led, when one of their favourites got into a
difficulty. The exclamations of Ruston the old sailor were
particularly amusing, as, according to the position in which the
animal got bogged, he used to roar out for someone "to come and
give his pony a heave upon the starboard or larboard quarters;"
and once, when violently alarmed at the danger he imagined his
pet pony to be in, he shouted amain, "By G---, Sir, she'll go
down by the stern." At last however we got clear of the marsh,
and reached a rocky gorge where this stream issued from the
hills, and here we stopped for breakfast</p>

<p>This spot was very picturesque. The river as it issued from
the gorge in the high wooded hills first formed a series of
cascades, and then at the mouth of the gorge expanded into a
large pool. It was at this point, although only a secondary
stream in this country, far larger than any of the rivers of
South-Western Australia. At the gorges, where they issue from the
hills, its banks were clothed with the pandanus, lofty gum trees,
and a very luxuriant vegetation. We first sought for a ford up
the river in the direction of the rapids, but our search was
fruitless. On returning to breakfast I found that the men had
caught three fish and one of the long-necked fresh-water turtle
which are common over the whole of this continent. Mr. Lushington
had also shot several black cockatoos so that we were supplied
with a meal of meat, a luxury we had not enjoyed for a long
time.</p>

<p>CROSS A LARGE RIVER.</p>

<p>After breakfast Corporal Auger started alone and returned in
about an hour to report that he had found a ford across the river
close to us. I therefore ordered the ponies to be brought up and
we at once moved on. The river where we crossed it in south
latitude 15 degrees 49 minutes, east longitude 125 degrees 6
minutes, was about a hundred yards wide. It was however nowhere
more than knee deep as we wound through it, following a
circuitous course; but we passed very deep parts on each side,
and I could not but admire the perseverance of Auger in having
discovered so very intricate a ford as this was. There were
several minor channels to the stream not much wider than an
English ditch; they were however very deep and went winding along
through groves of the pandanus and lofty reeds, which formed
leafy tunnels above them. It was some time before we got rid of
the main stream, and we then found ourselves on a narrow terrace
of land which was bounded on the left by rocky cliffs, and on the
right by a large tributary of the stream we had just crossed.
This tributary was not fordable here so we were compelled to
travel up the terrace where our way was much impeded by the
luxuriant vegetation and by fallen trees of great magnitude;
indeed of a size which those alone who have traversed tropical
virgin forests can conceive.</p>

<p>That we could not get off this terrace was the more provoking
from seeing, immediately on the other side of the stream, one of
those wide open basaltic valleys which I have so often mentioned.
We at length reached the point where the stream issued from the
high land and, having here forded it, entered the large valley,
but in its centre we found another impassable stream and, in
order to turn this, were obliged to travel round the valley; but
before we could gain the head of it we had to cross two streams
which ran into it on the eastern side. These however gave us but
little trouble.</p>

<p>NATIVE HUT.</p>

<p>On the tongue of land between them we found a native hut which
differed from any before seen, in having a sloping roof. After
passing this hut we began to wind up a rocky ascent, and just at
sunset reached the watershed, which threw off streams to the
north and south: the valley which lay immediately to the south of
us appearing as fertile as that which we had been travelling
through for the whole day.</p>

<p>March 28.</p>

<p>The first part of our journey was through a fertile valley,
about four miles in length, through which wound a rapid stream.
It was clothed with the richest grass, abounded in kangaroos, and
was marked at its southern extremity by a very remarkable
precipitous hill. The heights to the westward were all composed
of basalt, whilst those to the eastward were sandstone. On
passing the ridge of hills which bounded this valley to the south
we entered on a sandstone district, although the hills to the
westward were still basaltic.</p>

<p>NATURAL GRAPERY. GRAPE-LIKE FRUIT.</p>

<p>I here halted the party for breakfast by the side of a stream
and, on casting my eyes upwards, I found that I was in a sort of
natural grapery, for the tree under which I lay was covered with
a plant which bears a sort of grape and I believe is a species of
cissus.</p>

<p>We met altogether with three varieties of this plant, all of
which were creepers but differing from each other in their habits
and in the size of their fruit. Two of them generally ran along
the ground or amongst low shrubs and the third climbed high
trees; this latter kind bore the finest fruit, and it was a plant
of this description which I today found. Its fruit in size,
appearance, and flavour resembled a small black grape, but the
stones were different, being larger, and shaped like a coffee
berry. All three produced their fruit in bunches, like the vine,
and, the day being very sultry, I do not know that we could have
fallen upon anything more acceptable than this fruit was to
us.</p>

<p>FORD THE GLENELG. ANOTHER RIVER.</p>

<p>After breakfast we continued our route through a barren, sandy
district, heavily timbered; and in the course of the afternoon
met either the Glenelg or a very considerable branch of that
stream in south latitude 15 degrees 56 minutes, east longitude
125 degrees 8 minutes: it was 250 yards across and formed a
series of rapids at this point, where it emerged from a rocky
gorge. Just above the rapids we found a good ford, the average
depth of which was not more than three feet. After crossing, the
banks on the other side were clothed with a species of Casuarina
which I did not observe elsewhere. The country on that side of
the stream was sandy and, as I found by the time we had proceeded
two or three miles that we were getting embarrassed in a
sandstone range, I halted the party for the night and went on to
try if I could find a pass across it. My exertions were not
however very successful: I came upon a path which I thought might
be rendered practicable for the ponies over the first part of the
range, but found no line by which we could proceed without making
a road.</p>

<p>WEAKNESS OF THE MEN.</p>

<p>March 29.</p>

<p>At dawn this morning the men were at work forming the road;
the poor fellows were however so much enfeebled from constant
fatigue and very inefficient nutriment, whilst exposed to the
great heat of a tropical climate, that they were unable to exert
the same energy as formerly, and I could not but be struck with
the great difference in their strength as evinced in their
incapacity to move stones and other obstacles, which a few weeks
ago they would have had little difficulty in lifting. The path
was however soon made as passable as our abilities permitted, and
we started along it with the ponies; some of them were however no
less reduced than the men and, in endeavouring to lead one of
them up a rocky hill, it fell, and from weakness sank under its
light load without making an effort to save itself; the spine was
thus so severely injured as to render it unable to move the
hinder extremities; we therefore killed the poor creature and
moved on.</p>

<p>SANDSTONE CAVE.</p>

<p>Throughout the day we continued gradually the ascent of the
range which we had yesterday commenced. The large valley we were
in led us by a gentle slope winding higher and higher amongst the
rocky hills; at first it had been so wide as to appear like a
plain, but by degrees it contracted its dimensions, until,
towards the afternoon, it suddenly assumed almost the character
of a gorge. Just at this point we saw in the cliffs on our left
hand a cave, which I entered in the hope of finding native
paintings.</p>

<p>Nor was I disappointed for it contained several of a very
curious character. This cave was a natural chasm in the sandstone
rocks, elevated at its entrance several feet above the level of
the ground, from which the ascent to it was by a natural flight
of sandstone steps, irregular, of course, but formed of
successive thin strata, resting one upon another, and thus
constituting an easy ascent; these successive layers continued
into the body of the cave, quite to the end, where was a central
slab, more elevated than the others, and on each side of this two
other larger ones which reached the top of the cave and partly
served to support the immense sandstone slab that formed the
roof.</p>

<p>ANOTHER PAINTED CAVE.</p>

<p>The cave was twenty feet deep and at the entrance seven feet
high and about forty feet wide. As before stated the floor
gradually approached the roof in the direction of the bottom of
the cavern, and its width also contracted, so that at the
extremity it was not broader than the slab of rock, which formed
a natural seat.</p>

<p>FIGURE DRAWN ON THE ROOF.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="grey1-21"></a><img alt="" src="/ebooks/e00054-images/grey1-21.jpg"></p>

<p><b>17. Figure drawn on roof of Cave, discovered March
29th.</b></p>
</center>

<p>The principal painting in it was the figure of a man, ten feet
six inches in length, clothed from the chin downwards in a red
garment which reached to the wrists and ankles; beyond this red
dress the feet and hands protruded and were badly executed.</p>

<p>The face and head of the figure were enveloped in a succession
of circular bandages or rollers, or what appeared to be painted
to represent such. These were coloured red, yellow, and white;
and the eyes were the only features represented on the face. Upon
the highest bandage or roller a series of lines were painted in
red, but, although so regularly done as to indicate that they
have some meaning, it was impossible to tell whether they were
intended to depict written characters or some ornament for the
head. This figure was so drawn on the roof that its feet were
just in front of the natural seat, whilst its head and face
looked directly down on anyone who stood in the entrance of the
cave, but it was totally invisible from the outside. The painting
was more injured by the damp and atmosphere, and had the
appearance of being much more defaced and ancient, than any of
the others which we had seen.*</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. This figure brings to mind the
description of the Prophet Ezekiel: Men portrayed upon the wall,
the images of the Chaldeans portrayed in vermilion, girded with
girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their
heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the
Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity. Chapter
23:14, 15.)</blockquote>

<p>OTHER PAINTINGS.</p>

<p>There were two other paintings, one on each of the rocks which
stood on either side of the natural seat; they were carefully
executed and yet had no apparent design in them; unless they were
intended to represent some fabulous species of turtle; for the
natives of Australia are generally fond of narrating tales of
fabulous and extraordinary animals such as gigantic snakes,
etc.</p>

<p>One of the party who appeared much amused at these different
paintings walked straight up the cavern, gradually ascending the
steps until he reached the slab at the end, and then, taking his
hat off with a solemn air, seated himself; to his own, and our
surprise, his bare head just touched the roof of the cave, and on
examining this part of it we found it fairly polished, and very
greasy, from all appearance caused by the constant rubbing
against it of the head of a person whilst seated on the rock.
This and other circumstances led us to conjecture that the cave
was frequented by some wise man or native doctor who was resorted
to by the inhabitants in cases of disease or witchcraft. We saw
many footmarks about, and found other signs of the close presence
of the natives, but they themselves remained invisible.</p>

<p>BEAUTIFUL SCENERY.</p>

<p>The cave was situated in an exceedingly picturesque position,
it occupied the corner leading from a wide valley to a narrow
ravine, down which came bubbling along a clear deep stream, which
passed within a few yards of the cave's mouth. After making
sketches of the paintings and for a few minutes admiring this
romantic spot we moved up the ravine, which appeared to lead by a
gradual ascent to the summit of the mountain range that now
completely hemmed us in both to the southward and eastward.</p>

<p>This ravine, in the luxuriance of its vegetation and the great
size of the trees, as well as in its rapid stream, at times
leaping in cascades or foaming in rapids, resembled those we had
before seen in the sandstone ranges, but it differed from them in
the greater height of the surrounding hills and cliffs which,
being overshadowed with hanging trees and climbing plants,
presented as rich a painting as the eye could behold: and, as
these grew golden with the rays of the setting sun or were thrown
into deep and massive shadows, I could not but regret that no
Claude of the tropics had arisen to transfer to canvas scenes
which words cannot express.</p>

<p>But however beautiful the scenery was the road we had to
travel was so extremely inconvenient that the view scarcely made
amends for it; we were continually compelled from old land-slips
to cross from one side of the stream to the other, and this, from
the depth of the ford and the slipperiness of the rocky bottom,
was sometimes no easy task; moreover the ravine continued rapidly
to contract in width and to become more rugged and precipitous; I
therefore turned off to the right into a rocky amphitheatre which
seemed well suited for encamping, and halted the party for the
night; then, taking one of my men with me, I ascended the cliffs
to see if I could make out any line by which to get clear of the
precipices which embarrassed us, but on all sides I could descry
nothing but lofty hills and frowning crags, except in the
direction of the ravine which appeared to run directly into the
heart of the mountain chain; I therefore turned about to rejoin
the party, with the intention of continuing the same course the
ensuing morning as we had done this evening.</p>

<p>NARROW ESCAPE.</p>

<p>Both myself and the man who was with me had however a narrow
escape of being shot, for, as we were returning he let his rifle
fall and it exploded, the ball striking the rocks close to us
before it glanced into the air.</p>

<p>OTHER CAVES.</p>

<p>March 30.</p>

<p>At the earliest dawn we continued our course up the valley,
which rapidly became narrower and more inclined so that it
formed, as it were, a series of elevated terraces, at the edge of
each of which was a little cascade. We found two caves in the
cliffs on the right hand, both of which were painted all over but
with no regularity of pattern: the only colours used were red,
yellow, and white. The largest of the caves exceeded in breadth
and depth any others I had seen, but it was only three feet high;
in this one there were several drawings of fish, one of which was
four feet in length; these I copied, although they were badly
executed. The caves themselves cannot be considered as at all
analogous to those I have before described.</p>

<p>INCREASING DIFFICULTIES OF ROUTE. IMPASSABLE SANDSTONE
RANGES.</p>

<p>The difficulties of the road continued to increase rapidly,
and the dimensions of the ravine became so contracted that I
hesitated whether I should not turn up another which branched off
to the right; previously however to taking this step I sent a man
forward to examine the one we were in; he soon returned and
reported that it terminated in a high cascade a few hundred yards
further on. This intelligence confirming my previous opinion, I
now moved up the ravine which came from the westward, but we had
not proceeded for more than half a mile when the rugged nature of
the country brought us to a complete stand; we found ourselves in
a rocky area, bounded on all sides by cliffs, the only outlet
from which was the path by which we had entered. I therefore
halted the party for breakfast whilst I prepared to ascend some
lofty pinnacles which lay to the south of us.</p>

<p>The state of my wound rendered this exertion one of great pain
and difficulty; I however accomplished it, and found myself on
the top of a high rocky eminence which bore the appearance of
having fallen into ruins; the prospect from it was cheerless in
the extreme; to the north lay the rich valley country far below
us, and to the south and east nothing could be seen but barren
sandstone rocks and ranges rising one above the other until they
met the horizon at no great distance from the eye; the only
outlet, except the ravine by which we had approached, appeared to
be by the westward, and I descended to the party in this
direction to see if I could find a route from where they were to
the terrace leading to that point. I struck on a place up the
cliffs where I imagined it possible to construct a road by which
the ponies could ascend, and then returned to breakfast.</p>

<p>COUNTRY INACCESSIBLE FOR HORSES.</p>

<p>As soon as our scanty meal had been concluded all hands were
employed in making this road; and sincerely did I pity the feeble
men, whom I saw in the burning heat of a tropical sun, which was
reflected with redoubled intensity from the bare sandstone rocks,
toiling to displace large stones and obstacles which they had
hardly sufficient strength to move; not a murmur however escaped
them; they saw the necessity of the case and exerted their
failing energies as readily as they had done when these were in
full strength and vigour. The road was at last made and we moved
on to the westward, toiling for the remainder of the day amongst
steep precipices of barren sandstone rocks and hills, utterly
inaccessible to horses, till, finding our efforts to proceed
useless, I at last turned the party about and halted them for the
night just above where we had breakfasted; intending with the
earliest dawn to renew my search for a pass by which we might
cross this mountain range.</p>

<p><a name="chapter10"></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER 10. RETURN TO HANOVER BAY.</h2>

<p>UNSUCCESSFUL SEARCH FOR A PASS.</p>

<p>March 31.</p>

<p>This day at dawn I sent out a party under Mr. Lushington and
Mr. Walker to try if any pass through the mountains could be
found, but they returned in four or five hours to report that it
was utterly impossible for horses to proceed further in the
direction we desired. During their absence I had made a careful
examination of the stores and found that, even at our reduced
allowance, we had only provisions left for twenty days; our
horses were also reduced in number to twelve, but these,
excepting that their feet were sore, were rather improved in
condition than otherwise since the commencement of the
journey.</p>

<p>CAUSES FOR RETURNING.</p>

<p>My intention had always been, when I found myself reduced to
such an extremity as the present, to proceed for a few days by
forced marches towards the interior, accompanied by four men, and
then, returning to the remainder of the party, to have taken all
together back to the vessel; when there I knew I could have got
four volunteers to accompany me and, having loaded the horses
with ammunition and provisions, I had it in contemplation to have
started with them again for Swan River. But these projects became
now impracticable from the declining state of my health,
consequent on having started too soon after having received my
wound, to the exertions I was obliged daily to make whilst
labouring under its effects, and to the want of those comforts
which contribute so materially to restore an invalid to health.
Our allowance of food too had been but scanty, and, whilst I
fared as my men, who, unshattered in health, had yet grown thin
and weak under privation, I, in proportion, had suffered far
more.</p>

<p>PREPARATIONS TO RETURN.</p>

<p>Mr. Walker, who was aware of my design, came to me today and
said he felt it his duty to recommend me without delay to return
to the vessel; that as long as he thought the risk I ran was no
more than he considered a man who had undertaken such a service
should be prepared to incur, he had refrained from pressing this
advice upon me, but in my present debilitated state exposure even
for a single night might very probably cost me my life. To this
opinion I felt constrained to yield, and Mr. Walker, having at my
desire repeated it in a letter this afternoon, I arranged my
plans accordingly.</p>

<p>LIGHT EXPLORING PARTY SENT FORWARD UNDER LIEUTENANT
LUSHINGTON.</p>

<p>The march in advance, which, had my health permitted, I had
intended to make myself, was now deputed to Mr. Lushington: four
of those men who remained the strongest of our enfeebled band
were selected for an excursion of three days under him; after
which we were to return to the vessel.</p>

<p>April 1 and 2.</p>

<p>At dawn on Sunday the 1st the party started; and these two
days I occupied myself in making magnetic and astronomical
observations. Our latitude I found by two meridian altitudes of
the moon to be 16 degrees 0 minutes 45 seconds south, and our
longitude by chronometer 125 degrees 11 minutes east.</p>

<p>REPORT OF ADVANCED PARTY.</p>

<p>April 3.</p>

<p>Mr. Lushington's party came in at 12 o'clock this day,
reporting as follows: That they proceeded about eighteen miles
from the camp upon a course of 195 degrees from the north, and
the remaining half upon a course of 155 1/2 degrees; that the
whole of their route lay over a country utterly impassable for
horses owing to the steepness of the hills; that they crossed a
great number of under-features at right angles to their route,
between which lay small streams flowing away to the westward, and
which under-features were so steep in their descent to the
southward that, in going down, the men repeatedly fell: both
grass and water were however everywhere abundant; and they saw,
in the spots where the grass was most luxuriant, the root which I
found on the hill at our first encampment on the good land. The
last point they attained was a lofty hill which ran out from a
range to the eastward, from which range sprang also all the
under-features that they had crossed. From this hill they had an
extensive view to the northward, eastward, and westward. The land
they saw to the northward is laid down upon my map.</p>

<p>THEIR DESCRIPTION OF THE COUNTRY.</p>

<p>To the eastward they saw nothing but ranges of hills,
precisely resembling those that we had crossed since entering
this mountainous district; and to the westward others of the same
nature, but gradually falling in that direction, whilst on the
other hand the land seemed to rise gently to the eastward, though
they saw no very high hills in an easterly direction. To the
southward their view was impeded by a very high bluff point,
distant six or seven miles, and a line of cliffs under which they
conceived that a river or an opening of the sea may run, but if
so, it could not be a stream of great magnitude. Their view of
the base of the cliff was however impeded by the under-features
of the hill on which they stood. They also noticed, as a very
remarkable circumstance, that there were no signs of these
mountains having been visited by the natives. The first part of
their route lay over an extensive plain, four miles in width,
which bore no appearance of the great native conflagrations
having ever reached it. This was so generally the case that, when
they halted, they were unable to obtain a sufficiency of
firewood. They saw a native dog of the regular Australian breed;
kangaroos were abundant, but these as well as all other game were
much less wild than any of the party had before observed.</p>

<p>The foregoing summary of the information brought back rests
not on the report of any one individual but expresses the
opinions of the party with regard to those points on which they
were all agreed; and the only one as to which I have any distrust
is that of the distance they went, which I believe to be
overrated; having always found the estimates of every one of the
party as to the daily distance travelled very erroneous, and
sometimes more than doubled. This indeed is a mistake well known
to be of common occurrence, and very difficult to guard against
in a new and wild country, and when I consider the diminished
strength of the men's pedestrian powers, and the weights they had
to carry, I am disposed to calculate that the total direct
distance they made did not exceed, if it equalled, twelve
miles.</p>

<p>WANT OF FIREWOOD.</p>

<p>Their report of want of firewood is singular as, in all other
parts which we passed over, even upon plains of a similar
character though not so highly elevated or so difficult of
access, we had always found the ground thickly covered with trees
which had fallen from the effects of the native fires.</p>

<p>The only remarkable circumstances about the spot we were
encamped in were the great coldness of the nights and mornings;
and moreover that exactly at nine o'clock every morning a cold
breeze, in character precisely resembling a sea-breeze, set in
from the south-east and lasted until about half-past three in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>RETURN. COMMENCEMENT OF MARCH BACK.</p>

<p>April 4.</p>

<p>We this day started on our march homewards. I was afraid, from
the appearance of the weather, that we might soon have rain, and,
as a continuance of it for even three or four days might have
prevented our passing the rivers for several weeks, it became
necessary that this part of our march should be accomplished with
the utmost celerity. I therefore made the first river before I
allowed a halt for breakfast. On our route we passed the spot
where, on the 29th ultimo, we had been compelled to kill the
horse; the native dogs had already made it a perfect skeleton and
scattered its bones about.</p>

<p>NATIVE AND HIS DOG.</p>

<p>I committed unintentionally this day what must have appeared
to the natives a very wanton act of aggression: as we were
passing the river, a dog, not of the Australian breed, came from
a pass in the rocks on the opposite side, moving quietly towards
us over some flat rocks; when he had advanced a few yards from
the pass he stopped and looked back, so that from his manner I
might have known that his master was near, but without reflection
I fired and struck the ground close to him; he became alarmed and
ran back in the same line he had come; I now took up my own rifle
and just as he turned a point in the rocks I fired, and, although
a very long shot, I struck him far forward in the shoulder. For a
moment he staggered, then turned round and limped up a glen in
the hills in quite a different direction. I had neither time nor
strength to follow him, but on passing the river I found from the
tracks that minute made that a single native had been coming down
to the river with the dog, and had (probably from hearing the
shots) turned sharp off to the right and made his escape into
some bushes. This day the weakness of our last sheep obliged us
to kill it.</p>

<p>CONTINUATION OF ROUTE BACK. CHANGE OF TRACK.</p>

<p>April 5.</p>

<p>I continued on our old track this morning until I had passed
the other river, and then, quitting our former route, made a push
straight over the sandstone ridge for our old enemy the marsh, as
I felt sure after the present long continuance of fine weather
that it would be now quite passable. We encamped this night on
the sandstone range under a group of lofty firs, or rather
pines.</p>

<p>April 6.</p>

<p>I found a very easy route over the sandstone, quite passable
in fine weather, but after rains, I think, from the marshy nature
of the ground, that it would present some difficulty. The marsh
itself was perfectly passable, could without any difficulty be
drained, and consisted of good and fertile land. A remarkable
circumstance connected with it was the great depth of the beds of
its streams, the banks in some places being fourteen feet above
the existing water level, whilst I could observe no signs of the
water having ever risen to that height. In the afternoon I once
more struck our old track, which I quitted again in the evening.
We halted a few hundred yards from two remarkable heaps of stones
of the same kind as those I have before mentioned.</p>

<p>CURIOUS NATIVE MOUNDS OR TOMBS OF STONES.</p>

<p>April 7.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="grey1-22"></a><img alt="" src="/ebooks/e00054-images/grey1-22.jpg"></p>

<p><b>18. Supposed Native Tombs. Discovered on the North-Western
Coast of New Holland, 7 April 1838. Published by T. &amp; W.
Boone, London.</b></p>
</center>

<p>This morning I started off before dawn and opened the most
southern of the two mounds of stones which presented the
following curious facts:</p>

<p>1. They were both placed due east and west and, as will be
seen by the annexed plates, with great regularity.</p>

<p>2. They were both exactly of the same length but differed in
breadth and height.</p>

<p>3. They were not formed altogether of small stones from the
rock on which they stood, but many were portions of very distant
rocks, which must have been brought by human labour, for their
angles were as sharp as the day they were broken off; there were
also the remains of many and different kinds of seashells in the
heap we opened.</p>

<p>My own opinion concerning these heaps of stones had been that
they were tombs; and this opinion remains unaltered, though we
found no bones in the mound, only a great deal of fine mould
having a damp dank smell. The antiquity of the central part of
the one we opened appeared to be very great, I should say two or
three hundred years; but the stones above were much more modern,
the outer ones having been very recently placed; this was also
the case with the other heap: can this be regarded by the natives
as a holy spot?</p>

<p>We explored the heap by making an opening in the side, working
on to the centre, and thence downwards to the middle, filling up
the former opening as the men went on; yet five men provided with
tools were occupied two hours in completing this opening and
closing it again, for I left everything precisely as I had found
it. The stones were of all sizes, from one as weighty as a strong
man could lift, to the smallest pebble. The base of each heap was
covered with a rank vegetation, but the top was clear, from the
stones there having been recently deposited.</p>

<p>PASS IN MOUNTAIN RANGE.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we proceeded on our route, travelling nearly
north. After marching some distance we traversed at right angles
a variety of under-features terminating in sandstone cliffs, but
the hills on our right were composed of the same black rock as
the chain in which Mount Lyell lies. Private Mustard being ill, I
gave him my horse and tried to walk, but injured myself
materially by so doing. We were obliged to encamp at the head of
a large mangrove inlet.</p>

<p>April 8.</p>

<p>It being Sunday I halted all the morning and only started late
in the afternoon. Our route lay through a mountainous country and
consequently our progress was slow. Quartz was here largely
developed in rocks. We halted this evening in a valley surrounded
by mountains.</p>

<p>PASS MOUNT LYELL.</p>

<p>April 9.</p>

<p>We started at dawn and soon found that the valley we had
encamped in was the true pass across the range of mountains. It
ran in nearly a south-west direction to the foot of Mount Lyell.
Here I halted for breakfast; and, on finding my position by cross
bearings, which I was now able to do, and comparing it with my
position by dead reckoning, was glad to find that the error only
amounted to 150 yards. The valley we travelled up in the morning
was fertile, connected with several other large ones of similar
character, and contained two small lakes, or large ponds of
water, the least of which was elevated considerably above the low
ground in the neighbourhood. In the afternoon we crossed the
mountains by a narrow neck, which is the best pass over this
range of hills for anyone travelling to the south and east. We
crossed our old track twice in the afternoon and encamped in the
evening under a conical hill.</p>

<p>April 10.</p>

<p>Started at dawn, travelling nearly north-west, and crossed the
heads of all the streams which I had before seen emptying
themselves into the river Glenelg in the opening lying between
Mount Sturt and Mount Eyre. Just under the point where we
encamped for the night was a large marsh in which my horse got
bogged and I had a severe fall.</p>

<p>CONTINUATION OF ROUTE.</p>

<p>April 11.</p>

<p>On starting this morning all the party insisted that they saw
a hill, under which our old track had passed. I felt convinced
that such could not be the case; and, had it been so, an error of
four miles must have existed in my map: yet all were so positive
of their correctness that I felt it would appear like obstinacy
in me not to yield to the general opinion. I therefore quitted
our direct course to make for the foot of this hill, and there
convinced myself that I was right; yet, even when we had now
passed it, proceeding on our route, I heard several remark, "We
shall soon march back here again." But this evening I had the
pleasure of halting under the sandstone range, and the very hill
we had wished to gain.</p>

<p>RECOVERY OF BURIED STORES.</p>

<p>April 12.</p>

<p>We marched early, and on the way passed more native tombs;
when we came to the place where the horse had been left I found
that, through inadvertence on the part of the man who led him, he
had been starved to death, having been left tethered. This
discovery shocked me much. Some of the stores which had been left
where he fell and covered with a tarpaulinremained uninjured. We
proceeded onwards to the camp where I had lain so long wounded,
and, on arriving found all our provisions in good order, the
natives apparently not having since visited the spot. We were not
a little glad to find our preserved meats which had been left
buried here. Halted for the night, and enjoyed our repast.</p>

<p>PRECAUTIONS ON REACHING HANOVER BAY.</p>

<p>April 13.</p>

<p>After digging up our supply of preserved meats yesterday we
had made rather more free with them than was prudent in men who
had been for so long a time compelled to subsist upon very scanty
fare, and in consequence had been nearly all affected with
violent sickness; and, as six of the party, including Mr.
Lushington and myself, were now ill, we did not start very early;
the remaining ponies were also so weak that they could scarcely
carry themselves, and we therefore were only able to place very
light loads upon them.</p>

<p>I have already described the very difficult nature of the
country we had to traverse; but the roads we had previously
constructed through it proved extremely serviceable. So little
had they been injured that they formed a very fair and passable
line of communication. Early in the evening we crossed the
Lushington and halted at the summit of the cliffs which formed
its northern bank.</p>

<p>April 14.</p>

<p>I sent the most efficient of the party back with the horses
for the remaining stores whilst with four men I remained in
charge of the tents.</p>

<p>ANXIETY ON APPROACHING HANOVER BAY.</p>

<p>Sunday April 15.</p>

<p>Our anxiety to ascertain if any accident had happened to the
schooner now became very great: since such a circumstance was of
course by no means impossible. As our position would then have
been very precarious, and our only chance of ultimate safety have
rested on the most exact discipline and cautious rules of conduct
being observed from the very first, I thought it would be most
prudent not to allow such a calamity (had it occurred) to burst
too suddenly upon the men when they were quite unprepared for
it.</p>

<p>Two of them were therefore selected and, accompanied by these,
I started before daylight for the sandy beach in Hanover Bay;
leaving the party to make the best of their way to the heights
above the valley where we had first encamped, and where plenty of
food and water could be found for the ponies; these, in the event
of anything having happened to the schooner, would become the
mainstay of our hopes.</p>

<p>These arrangements having been made we moved off through the
rocky difficult country we had first encountered: every step we
took was over well-known ground, in which no change had taken
place save that there were evident marks of bodies of natives
having been in the neighbourhood since our departure.</p>

<p>As I proceeded nearly in a direct line to Hanover Bay we
encountered some difficulty from the broken character of the
ground, but about eleven o'clock had gained the hilly country at
the back of the beach, from whence however we could not obtain a
view of the spot where the vessel lay. On emerging from the
mangroves upon the beach we saw painted upon the sandstone
cliffs, in very large letters, "Beagle Observatory, letters
south-east 52 paces."</p>

<p>REJOIN THE LYNHER. MEETING WITH THE BEAGLE.</p>

<p>No one who has not been similarly situated can at all conceive
the thrill which went through me when these letters first met my
eye; even had anything happened to the schooner, friends were
upon the coast, and I knew that Captain Wickham, who had passed a
great portion of his life in adventures of this kind, would leave
nothing undone which was in his power to ensure our safety. We
now hurried across the beach, and on gaining the highest part of
it saw the little schooner riding safely at anchor. A gun being
fired all became life and expectation on board the vessel; and
whilst the boat pulled ashore we searched for our letters. These
had however not yet been deposited at the spot indicated, and I
therefore conjectured that we should find them on board.</p>

<p>On reaching the vessel we learnt that the mate was gone to the
Beagle, now lying in Port George the Fourth but expected to sail
this very day. It appeared that at 7 o'clock on the morning of
the 8th the report of four carronades was heard on board the
schooner; this was conjectured by all to denote the presence of
the Beagle on the coast, but the echo ran from cliff to cliff
with so many reverberations that none could tell from what
direction the sound had originally proceeded. The silence of the
night was not again disturbed; and those on board the schooner
felt no small solicitude to know if their conjectures were
correct, and if so in what direction the Beagle lay.</p>

<p>ARRIVAL OF THE BEAGLE.</p>

<p>The next morning the mystery was cleared up. Before noon a
yawl was seen to round the headland and to stand across the bay
in the direction of the mouth of Prince Regent's River. As soon
as the schooner was recognised the yawl altered her course, and
Captain Wickham was soon on board the Lynher, making anxious
enquiries for us and ascertaining what steps could be taken to
assist us and promote our views.</p>

<p>From that time up to the present date the Beagle had lain in
Port George the Fourth to take in wood, water, etc., and to await
the return of Mr. Stokes, who was absent exploring the coast
between Collier's Bay and Port George the Fourth.</p>

<p>As there was no time to lose I at once started in a boat for
the Beagle, and it was late in the evening when we drew near it.
I could see anxious groups looking eagerly at the little boat as
it drew near, and when at length we were recognised the hearty
cheers that greeted us as we came up alongside plainly showed
that the pleasure of meeting was not confined to ourselves.</p>

<p>RESULTS OF HER SURVEY.</p>

<p>As Mr. Stokes was hourly expected to return, and I was very
anxious to know if he had discovered the mouth of the Glenelg, I
remained on board the Beagle and, as all had much to hear and
much to communicate, the evening wore rapidly away. The next day
Mr. Stokes arrived, having seen nothing of the mouth of the
river; this however in my apprehension arose from the greater
portion of the time they were absent having been spent in the
examination of Collier's Bay, which was the point of by far the
greatest interest and promise; and that consequently they were
compelled, from want of time and supplies, to examine the
intervening coastline less narrowly than its irregular character
rendered necessary. What rather confirms this opinion is, that
Captain King, in his survey of this part, states his belief,
drawn from observation, that it is indented with inlets similar
to Prince Regent's River, now this is exactly the character of
the Glenelg.</p>

<p>Mr. Stokes described Camden Sound as being one of the finest
harbours he had seen; and, such being the case, it must
undoubtedly be the most important position on this part of the
coast. It lies close to the Glenelg and Prince Regent's River,
two large navigable streams; and I have already declared my
opinion that I have never seen a richer tract of country than the
extensive alluvial and basaltic districts in the neighbourhood of
the Glenelg, and under the rare circumstance of lying between two
navigable rivers which are separated from each other by so short
an interval.</p>

<p>PREPARATIONS FOR REEMBARKING.</p>

<p>Soon after Mr. Stokes's arrival I started for the Lynher, and
the next morning repaired on shore. During my absence on board
the Beagle fourteen natives had made their appearance near the
encampment on the cliffs above the valley; they appeared however
to have been solely attracted from motives of curiosity and a
desire to visit our former huts. From the fearful disposition
which had hitherto been evinced by the natives of these parts it
was necessary however that every precaution should be observed.
This was most carefully done by Mr. Lushington; and as soon as
the natives saw that they were watched they moved off and were
not again observed, although the smokes of their fires were
visible in several points.</p>

<p>On the 17th we commenced our preparations for leaving this
part of the coast. The stores remaining were all carried on
board. We had but eleven ponies left, the greater number of which
were so marked and scarred from falls amongst the rocks that they
would have been valueless if brought to sale; besides which, to
have cut and dried a quantity of grass sufficient for them until
we reached the Isle of France would, in the burnt up state of the
country, have delayed us many days, had we even succeeded at
last. On the other hand, if left free in the bush, two good mares
which were amongst them might possibly be the means of giving a
very valuable race of horses to this country. These
considerations determined me; and the companions of our weary
wanderings were turned loose--a new race upon the land; and, as
we trusted, to become the progenitors of a numerous herd.</p>

<p>STATE OF THE PLANTS AND SEEDS LEFT AT THE ENCAMPMENT.</p>

<p>Our whole residence in this country had been marked by toils
and sufferings. Heat, wounds, hunger, thirst, and many other
things had combined to harass us. Under these circumstances it
might have been imagined that we left these shores without a
single regret; but such was far from being the case: when the
ponies had wandered off, when all the remaining stores had been
removed, and the only marks of our residence in this valley were
a few shattered bark huts, young coconut plants, a bread-fruit,
and some other useful trees and plants, I felt very loth to leave
the spot. I considered what a blessing to the country these
plants must eventually prove if they should continue to thrive as
they had yet done and, as I called to mind how much forethought
and care their transport to their present position had
occasioned, I would very gladly have passed a year or two of my
life in watching over them and seeing them attain to a useful
maturity. One large pumpkin plant in particular claimed my
notice. The tropical warmth and rains, and the virgin soil in
which it grew, had imparted to it a rich luxuriance: it did not
creep along the ground, but its long shoots were spreading
upwards amongst the trees. The young coconuts grew humbly amidst
the wild plants and reeds, their worth unknown. Most of these
plants I had placed in the ground myself, and had watched their
early progress: now they must be left to their fate.</p>

<p>REEMBARKATION.</p>

<p>Amidst such thoughts we resumed our course down the valley and
embarked in the boats; but had not proceeded far when a dog
belonging to one of the men was missed and, as we could not
abandon so faithful a companion, a party returned to search for
it, and the dog was brought safely on board.</p>

<p>SAIL FOR THE MAURITIUS.</p>

<p>We then weighed and sailed for the Isle of France, where we
arrived on the 17th May without having met with any circumstance
on our voyage worthy of record.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 11. NATURAL HISTORY. CLIMATE. ABORIGINES.</h2>

<p>NATURAL HISTORY.</p>

<p>North-Western Australia seems to be peculiarly prolific in
birds, reptiles, and insects, who dwell here nearly unmolested,
mutually preying upon each other, and thus, by a wise provision,
setting the necessary check to their own multiplication.</p>

<p>DISTRIBUTION OF ANIMALS.</p>

<p>Of quadrupeds there are but few species, and of these the
individuals, considered in proportion to the surface they roam
over, are rare. The only species I observed during a residence of
five months were four of kangaroos, namely the large Macropus
giganteus ? of Shaw, two smaller kinds, one of which is the
Petrogale brachyotis of Gould, and a kangaroo rat, which last is
always seen amongst the rocks on the sea coast. One species of
opossum, a flying squirrel (Petaurista) two kinds of dog, of
which one is new, rats, and a fieldmouse. Of these the kangaroos
are alone numerous, and only in particular spots.</p>

<p>NEW KANGAROO.</p>

<p>I shot a female kangaroo of the Petrogale brachyotis near
Hanover Bay, and by the preservation of the skin and other parts
enabled Mr. Gould to identify it as a new species.</p>

<p>This graceful little animal is excessively wild and shy in its
habits, frequenting, in the daytime, the highest and most
inaccessible rocks, and only descending into the valleys to feed
early in the morning and late in the evening. When disturbed in
the daytime amongst the roughest and most precipitous rocks, it
bounds along from one to the other with the greatest apparent
facility, and is so watchful and wary in its habits that it is by
no means easy to get a shot at it. One very surprising thing is,
how it can support the temperature to which it is exposed in the
situations it always frequents amongst the burning sandstone
rocks, the mercury there during the heat of the day being
frequently at 136 degrees. I have never seen these animals in the
plains or lowlands, and believe that they frequent mountains
alone.</p>

<p>NEW DOMESTIC DOG.</p>

<p>The new species of dog differs totally from the Dingo or Canis
australiensis. I never saw one nearer than from twenty to thirty
yards, and was unable to procure a specimen. Its colour is the
same as that of the Australian dog, in parts however having a
blackish tinge. The muzzle is narrow, long, thin, and tapers
much, resembling that of a greyhound, whilst in general form it
approaches the English lurcher. Some of the party who went to
Timor stated it to resemble precisely the Malay dog common to
that island, and considered it to be of the same breed; which I
think not improbable, as I cannot state that I ever saw one wild,
or unless in the vicinity of natives; in company with whom they
were generally observed in a domesticated state. On the other
hand the Canis australiensis was common in some parts in a state
of nature: of these I saw several myself and, from the
descriptions given by other individuals of the party of dogs they
had observed, I recognised their identity with the same species.
We heard them also repeatedly howling during the night and,
although they never attacked our sheep or goats, many portions of
dead animals were carried off by them. I saw but two flying
squirrels and know not to which species of Petaurista they are to
be referred.</p>

<p>OTHER ANIMALS.</p>

<p>Both mice and rats are common, the former precisely resembling
in appearance the English fieldmouse. The rats on one occasion
ate up a live pet parakeet, leaving the bones gnawed and strewed
about; and on another, when I had shot a crane (Ardea scolopacea)
intending it for breakfast, they in the night devoured nearly the
whole of it.</p>

<p>CHECKS ON INCREASE OF ANIMALS.</p>

<p>The multiplication of kangaroos, opossums, rats, etc. may be
checked by various causes; but man, I imagine, is the most deadly
enemy they have to contend with. The numerous remains of these
animals that I have seen about the native fires attest the number
destroyed. In all those caves in which I found native paintings
were representations either of kangaroo hunts, or of men bringing
down these animals dead on their shoulders; and many a hollow
tree bore witness of its having been smoked in order to drive
forth to certain death the trembling opossum or bandicoot rat
which had taken refuge in it.</p>

<p>INFLUENCE OF MAN ON THEIR HABITS.</p>

<p>A convincing proof of the dread in which man is held by the
various kinds of kangaroos is given by their extreme shyness. I
never but on two or three occasions got within shot of the larger
kangaroos as they were always so wary; and, although I at
different times wounded two, I never could succeed in actually
capturing either. Now, when the detached party sent forward just
before we commenced our return to Hanover Bay crossed a range of
mountains on which were neither traces of the natives or their
fires, they found the direct reverse of this to be the case, and
were all surprised at the tameness of the kangaroos compared with
those they had previously seen.</p>

<p>In the same way, when I entered a new district, the birds
merely flew up into a lofty tree without attempting to go farther
away, and it was not until I had shot for a day or two in the
neighbourhood of a place that the birds there became at all
wild.</p>

<p>The native dog, doubtless being dependent for subsistence upon
the game he can procure, must contribute to thin the numbers of
the lesser animals, who also, together perhaps with the rapacious
dog himself, frequently fall a prey to the various snakes that
inhabit the country; as was evinced in the event narrated on the
16th of March of the destruction, by Mr. Lushington, of the boa
with a small kangaroo compressed in its folds.</p>

<p>The manner, too, in which I have seen the rapacious birds of
prey soar over plains where the small kangaroos abound, convinces
me that they also bear their part in the destruction of this
harmless race.</p>

<p>TRACES OF AN ANIMAL WITH A DIVIDED HOOF.</p>

<p>I have already alluded to the paucity of quadrupeds, both in
species and in number, but I have still to record the remarkable
fact of the existence in these parts of a large quadruped with a
divided hoof: this animal I have never seen, but twice came upon
its traces. On one occasion I followed its track for above a mile
and a half, and at last altogether lost it in rocky ground. The
footmarks exceeded in size those of a buffalo, and it was
apparently much larger, for, where it had passed through
brushwood, shrubs of considerable size in its way had been broken
down and, from the openings there left, I could form some
comparative estimate of its bulk. These tracks were first seen by
a man of the name of Mustard, who had joined me at the Cape, and
who had there been on the frontier during the Kaffir war; he told
me that he had seen the spoor of a buffalo, imagining that they
were here as plentiful as in Africa. I conceived at the time that
he had made some mistake, and paid no attention to him until I
afterwards twice saw the same traces myself.</p>

<p>BIRDS.</p>

<p>To describe the birds common to these parts requires more time
than to detail the names of the few quadrupeds to be found;
indeed in no other country that I have yet visited do birds so
abound. Even the virgin forests of South America cannot, in my
belief, boast of such numerous feathered denizens; yet I cannot,
after all, assert that the number of genera and species is at all
proportionate to that of individual birds. The contrary is
probably the real case.</p>

<p>BEAUTY OF THE BIRDS.</p>

<p>The birds of this country possess in many instances an
excessively beautiful plumage; and he alone who has traversed
these wild and romantic regions, who has beheld a flock of
many-coloured parakeets sweeping like a moving rainbow through
the air whilst the rocks and dells resounded with their playful
cries, can form any adequate idea of the scenes that there burst
on the eyes of the wondering naturalist.</p>

<p>The beginning of the month of February, or the end of January,
is the season in which the birds in these parts pair. In the
beginning of March I found many nests with eggs in them; and in
the end of that month eggs nearly hatched were observed in most
of the nests, as well as young birds occasionally.</p>

<p>RAPACIOUS BIRDS.</p>

<p>Of rapacious birds I saw but four kinds, but these are by no
means common:</p>

<p>The first species was a very large bird, of a dark colour
(Aquila fucosa, Cuvier) in size, appearance, and flight closely
resembling the golden eagle which I have often seen, and have
once shot on the north-west coast of Ireland. I have approached
these birds closely--so closely indeed that I have on two
occasions shot them, but each time they fell into a thick
mangrove inlet and I was not fortunate enough to procure either
of them; they appeared to me always to frequent the shores, for I
never saw them further inland than a mile from the sea. The large
nests Captain King mentions as having been found upon the coast I
imagine must have belonged to this species.</p>

<p>The second species was a sort of hawk (Haliaeetus
leucosternus, Gould) rather larger than the sparrow-hawk, of a
light cinnamon colour, with a perfectly white head. They also
frequent the shores, but I never shot one.</p>

<p>The third species was a Peregrine falcon (Falco melanogenys,
Gould) which is nearly allied to that of Europe. I was not
fortunate enough to procure a specimen of this bird.</p>

<p>The fourth was the Athene Boobook. Belly brown and white;
wings brown, with white spots; third quill-feather, longest; legs
feathered, lightish brown colour; tail brownish white, marked
with transverse bars of a darker brown; eye prominent; iris blue.
The only difference I could observe between the male and female
is that the female is rather larger than the male, and her
colours somewhat lighter. These birds inhabit the whole of that
part of North-western Australia lying between the Prince Regent
and Glenelg Rivers, and probably may be distributed over the
greater portion of the Continent. They feed on insects, reptiles,
and birds of the smaller kind. I have always found them seated in
holes in the rocks, or in shady dells, and have never seen them
fly in the daytime unless compelled by fear; they are very stupid
when disturbed, and in flight and manner closely resemble the
common English owl. I cannot however recollect having ever seen
one on the wing during the night.</p>

<p>Upon describing the two singular birds mentioned above in
Chapter 9 to Mr. Gould he informed me that they were most
probably of the rare species Anas semipalmata.</p>

<p>REMARKABLE NEST.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="grey1-23"></a><img alt="" src="/ebooks/e00054-images/grey1-23.jpg"></p>

<p><b>19. Nest or Bower of the Chalmydera nuchalis.</b></p>
</center>

<p>I have already spoken in the 9th chapter of a very curious
sort of nest which was frequently found by myself and other
individuals of the party, not only along the seashore, but in
some instances at a distance of six or seven miles from it. This
nest, which is figured in Illustration 19, I once conceived must
have belonged to the kangaroo rat I have above mentioned, until
Mr. Gould, who has lately returned from Australia, informed me
that it is the run or playing ground of the bird he has named
Chalmydera nuchalis.</p>

<p>These nests were formed of dead grass, and parts of bushes,
sunk a slight depth into two parallel furrows, in sandy soil, and
then nicely arched above. But the most remarkable fact connected
with them was that they were always full of broken shells, large
heaps of which protruded from each extremity of the nest. These
were invariably seashells. In one instance, in the nest most
remote from the sea that we discovered, one of the men of the
party found and brought to me the stone of some fruit which had
evidently been rolled in the sea; these stones he found lying in
a heap in the nest, and they are now in my possession.</p>

<p>EMUS.</p>

<p>I have seen no Emus in North-western Australia, but on two
occasions their tracks were impressed in the mud on some plains
lying on the banks of Glenelg River; and Mr. Dring, of H.M.S.
Beagle, informed me that, whilst that vessel was employed in the
survey of Fitzroy River, about seventy miles to the southward of
the former, he not only several times saw traces of them but
that, on one occasion when he was in the bush, two of them passed
within a few yards of him. They may, I conceive, therefore be
considered as inhabitants of this part of the continent.</p>

<p>ALLIGATORS.</p>

<p>No alligators were seen by the land party in any of the rivers
of North-western Australia, but the crew of the schooner saw one
in Hanover Bay. I can however safely assert from my own
experience that they are by no means numerous upon this coast. At
the islands of Timor and Roti however they abound.</p>

<p>TURTLES.</p>

<p>Turtles were abundant on the coast, and a freshwater tortoise
was found inland.</p>

<p>PLANTS.</p>

<p>Amongst the vegetable kingdom I shall only observe generally
that the Calamus, or rattan, which in King's voyage* is
considered to be peculiar to the primary granitic formation on
the east coast, is abundant in the interior of the north-west
between latitude 15 and 17 degrees south.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Appendix, volume 2.)</blockquote>

<p>I found a dwarf cabbage-palm between 15 and 16 degrees south
latitude, always in moist situations in the neighbourhood of
streams, although not immediately on the banks.</p>

<p>Of the family of Urticeae many species of Ficus were
observed.</p>

<p>The Banksia, common to Swan River, and bearing a yellow
flower, is to be found in many of the valleys on the north-west
coast; thus appearing to form an exception to Mr. Cunningham's
observation inserted in Captain King's voyage,* wherein he
says:</p>

<p>Viewing the general distribution of Banksia, it is a singular
fact in the geographical distribution of this genus that its
species, which have been traced through almost every meridian of
the south coast, upon the islands in Bass Strait, in Van Diemen's
Land, and widely scattered throughout the whole extent of New
South Wales to the north coast, at which extreme Banksia dentata
has been observed as far west as longitude 136 degrees south,
should be wholly wanting on the line of the north-west coast.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Ibid.)</blockquote>

<p>I observed a great variety of plants of the order
Leguminosae.</p>

<p>Of the extraordinary Capparis resembling the African Adansonia
I have already spoken in Chapter 6.</p>

<p>A species of Callitris (Pine) was common, as was the Pandanus;
and the Araucaria excelsa was found on the heights, both near the
sea coast and further inland.</p>

<p>CLIMATE. ITS HEALTHINESS.</p>

<p>I conceive the climate of North-western Australia to be one of
the finest in the world, and my reasons for thus thinking are
grounded upon the following circumstances.</p>

<p>PROOFS OF ITS SALUBRITY.</p>

<p>I was resident there from the beginning of the month of
December 1837 to the middle of the month of April 1838; a period
of four months and a half: and during the whole of this time the
men under my command were exposed to great hardships and
privations. On one occasion three of us slept in the open air
without any covering or warm clothes for five successive nights,
during three of which we had constant showers of heavy rain, and
yet did not in any way suffer from this exposure.</p>

<p>Other detached parties were on various occasions subjected for
a shorter period to exposure of a similar nature, and no instance
occurred of any individual suffering in the least from it. One or
two cases of slight diarrhoea occurred, but they could be always
traced to some food that had been eaten the day before, and never
were sufficiently violent to delay us for a single hour.</p>

<p>Whilst this perfect freedom from disease existed amongst the
party they had not only to bear exposure of the nature above
stated, but the provisions with which I was enabled to supply
them were sometimes very insufficient for their wants. During the
whole month of March and part of April their daily full allowance
of food was about 1 3/4 pounds of flour, first made into dough
and then baked in the form of a flat cake upon a large stone.</p>

<p>This low diet, at the same time that they were compelled to
work very hard, naturally rendered some of them extremely weak,
and several were, on our return to the coast, in a very reduced
state.</p>

<p>I should here state that we were (perhaps fortunately) unable
to carry more than one pint of brandy with us, hence no spirits
were issued to the men, and the non-appearance of diseases of an
inflammatory nature may perhaps in some measure be attributed to
this circumstance.</p>

<p>The opinion of Captain Wickham, R.N. commanding H.M. ship
Beagle, is perfectly in accordance with my own. He was upon the
coast at the same time that we were, and in a letter to me writes
thus: "Our cruise has been altogether a fortunate one, as we have
been enabled to examine the whole coast from Cape Villaret to
this place (Port George the Fourth) without any accident, and the
climate is so good that we have had no sick."</p>

<p>THERMOMETRICAL OBSERVATIONS. RAIN AND TEMPERATURE.</p>

<p>I have annexed a short statement of the weather and range of
the thermometer during some parts of the months of December,
January, and February. It will be seen from this that the heat
was on some occasions great, even as high as to 136 degrees of
Fahrenheit in the sun; yet, by not exposing ourselves to its
influence in the heat of the day more than we could help, we
suffered no inconvenience from this circumstance: indeed in other
tropical countries where the heat has not been so great I have
suffered much more than I did in North-western Australia.</p>

<p>NUMBER OF DAYS IN WHICH RAIN FELL:</p>

<p>December: 6 days.<br>
January: 19 days, namely, 12, to January 19th, 4 between 19th and
28th, 3 to end of month.<br>
February: 7 days.<br>
March: 12 days.<br>
To 12th April: 2 days.</p>

<p>In January the greatest quantity of rain fell between the 15th
and 30th, accompanied by storms of thunder and lightning.</p>

<p>In February the greatest quantity of rain fell in the
commencement of the month. For several nights in the middle of
February we had thunder, lightning, and strong gusts of wind,
seldom accompanied by rain.</p>

<p>In March the greatest quantity of rain fell from the 17th to
the 23rd.</p>

<p>The mean temperature of the different periods of the day for
the month of December 1838 at Hanover Bay, determined by
observations for only six successive days from the 26th to the
31st inclusive (thermometer in the shade) are as follows:</p>

<p>6 A.M. 82.2.<br>
9 A.M. 85.3.<br>
12 m. 91.3.<br>
3 P.M. 90.2.<br>
6 P.M. 85.8.<br>
9 P.M. 83.5.</p>

<p>The same for the month of January 1838, determined by
observations made from the 1st to the 19th inclusive, was:</p>

<p>6 A.M. 78.2.<br>
9 A.M. 84.3.<br>
12 M. 83.1.<br>
3 P.M. 85.7.<br>
6 P.M. 80.7.<br>
9 P.M. 83.4.</p>

<p>I should observe that the mean temperature for 9 P.M. for this
month is deduced from only seven days observation.</p>

<p>The same as the above for the month of February, taken twelve
miles to the south of Hanover Bay, from the 19th to the 26th
February inclusive, is as follows:</p>

<p>6 A.M. 77.0.<br>
9 A.M. 86.0.<br>
12 A.M. 92.7.<br>
3 P.M. 94.0.<br>
6 P.M. 83.3.</p>

<p>ABORIGINES, THEIR HABITS AND MANNERS.</p>

<p>I was never fortunate enough to succeed in obtaining a
friendly interview with the natives of these parts; but I have
repeatedly seen them closely, was twice forced into dispute with
them and, in one of these instances, into deadly conflict. My
knowledge of them is chiefly drawn from what I have observed of
their haunts, their painted caves, and drawings. I have moreover
become acquainted with several of their weapons, some of their
ordinary implements, and I took some pains to study their
disposition and habits as far as I could.</p>

<p>In their manner of life, their roving habits, their weapons,
and mode of hunting, they closely resemble the other Australian
tribes with which I have since become pretty intimately
acquainted; whilst in their form and appearance there is a
striking difference. They are in general very tall and robust,
and exhibit in their legs and arms a fine full development of
muscle which is unknown to the southern races.</p>

<p>They wear no clothes, and their bodies are marked by scars and
wales. They seem to have no regular mode of dressing their hair,
this appearing to depend entirely on individual taste or
caprice.</p>

<p>They appear to live in tribes subject, perhaps, to some
individual authority; and each tribe has a sort of capital, or
headquarters, where the women and children remain whilst the men,
divided into small parties, hunt and shoot in different
directions. The largest number we saw together amounted to nearly
two hundred, women and children included.</p>

<p>THEIR WEAPONS AND IMPLEMENTS.</p>

<p>Their arms consist of stone-headed spears (which they throw
with great strength and precision) of throwing sticks, boomerangs
or kileys, clubs, and stone hatchets. The dogs they use in
hunting I have already stated to be of a kind unknown in other
parts of Australia, and they were never seen wild by us.</p>

<p>The natives manufacture their water-buckets and weapons very
neatly; and make from the bark of a tree a light but strong cord.
Their huts, of which I only saw those on the sea-coast, are
constructed in an oval form of the boughs of trees, and are
roofed with dry reeds. The diameter of one which I measured was
about fourteen feet at the base.</p>

<p>LANGUAGE.</p>

<p>Their language is soft and melodious, so much so as to lead to
the inference that it differs very materially, if not radically,
from the more southern Australian dialects which I have since had
an opportunity of enquiring into. Their gesticulation is
expressive, and their bearing manly and noble. They never speared
a horse or sheep belonging to us and, judging by the degree of
industry shown in the execution of some of their paintings, the
absence of anything offensive in the subjects delineated, and the
careful finish of some articles of common use, I should infer
that under proper treatment they might easily be raised very
considerably in the scale of civilization.</p>

<p>INDIVIDUALS OF AN ALIEN WHITE RACE.</p>

<p>A remarkable circumstance is the presence amongst them of a
race, to appearance, totally different, and almost white, who
seem to exercise no small influence over the rest. I am forced to
believe that the distrust evinced towards strangers arose from
these persons, as in both instances, when we were attacked, the
hostile party was led by one of these light-coloured men.</p>

<p>SIMILARITY OF CUSTOMS WITH OTHER AUSTRALIAN TRIBES.</p>

<p>Captain King, who had previously experienced the same feelings
of ill-will in the natives of Vansittart Bay, attributed them to
the periodical visits of the Malays during the season of the
trepang fishery. He says (volume 1 page 320):</p>

<p>On this beach (of Vansittart Bay) we found a broken earthen
pot, which decidedly proved the fact of the Malays visiting this
part of the coast, and explained the mischievous disposition of
the natives.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>I saw but three men of this fair race myself, and thought they
closely resembled Malays; some of my men observed a fourth.</p>

<p>NATIVES AT ROEBUCK BAY.</p>

<p>An individual differing in appearance and colour from his
aboriginal associates was also seen amongst a native tribe whilst
the boats of the Beagle were surveying in Roebuck Bay, and is
thus ably described by Mr. Usberne, the master of the vessel; who
was in command of the boat at the time he was observed, and who
thus narrates the interview:*</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Nautical Magazine for 1840 page
576.)</blockquote>

<p>To prevent interruption during dinner the things were removed
to the boat, and she was then shoved a few yards off the beach,
and we commenced our repast.</p>

<p>As we took to the water they (the natives) rose and followed
us close; but in the act of shoving off, the boat-hook being
pointed over the bow, they one and all involuntarily stepped back
a couple of paces, thinking no doubt that it was one of our
spears, which to them must have appeared a formidable weapon;
but, seeing no harm was intended, they remained at the water's
edge, watching us whilst at dinner.</p>

<p>At this time I had a good opportunity of examining them. They
were about the middle age, about five feet six inches to five
feet nine in height, broad shoulders, with large heads and
overhanging brows; but it was not remarked that any of their
teeth were wanting (as we afterwards observed in others); their
legs were long and very slight, and their only covering a bit of
grass suspended round the loins. There was an exception in the
youngest, who appeared of an entirely different race: his skin
was a copper colour, whilst the others were black; his head was
not so large, and more rounded; the overhanging brow was lost;
the shoulders more of a European turn, and the body and legs much
better proportioned; in fact he might be considered a well-made
man at our standard of figure. They were each armed with one, and
some with two, spears, and pieces of stick about eight feet long
and pointed at both ends. It was used after the manner of the
Pacific Islanders, and the throwing-stick so much in use by the
natives of the south did not appear known to them.</p>

<p>After talking loud, and using very extravagant gestures,
without any of our party replying, the youngest threw a stone,
which fell close to the boat.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>COINCIDENCE OF CUSTOMS.</p>

<p>It appears to me very probable that the same dark-coloured
race inhabit the whole of Northern Australia, and perhaps extend
over the islands in Torres Strait.</p>

<p>In order to support this opinion I shall first give an extract
from the journal of Dr. Duncan, from Wilson's Voyage round the
World, page 148, which contains a detail of the customs of
Flinders Islands and part of Northern Australia, and displays two
or three remarkable customs coinciding with those observed by
myself and others to exist in Northwest Australia:</p>

<p>At 8 hours 40 minutes P.M. the colonial brig Mary arrived,
bringing along with her a native of India, whom she picked up on
one of Flinders Islands.</p>

<p>On the 18th July the Lascar came on board the Success, and
from him I learned the following particulars: That he belonged to
the ship Fame, which was wrecked in the Straits; that he and a
few others escaped in a leaky boat after rowing for forty-eight
hours. On landing the natives stripped them of their clothes,
etc., but otherwise behaved very kindly to them. His companions
in misfortune died the first year of his residence amongst the
natives, which in all amounted, he said, to six or seven
years.</p>

<p>The men in that part of Australia have from five to ten wives,
of whom they are rather jealous at times. The tribes are
continually at war with one another, and have regular pitched
battles; but the moment that one is killed on either side, the
battle ceases, until they carry off their dead, and mourn for
certain days, according to their custom; bedaubing themselves
over with black earth, and on another day the fight begins and
ends in a similar way.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>DISPOSAL OF THEIR DEAD.</p>

<p>This is singularly analogous to what occurred on our encounter
with them on the 11th February. Dr. Duncan continues:</p>

<p>When one dies or is killed they bury the body in the earth,
but at the end of five days dig it up again and wrap up the
bones, etc., in bark of trees, and carry them along with them.
When the women fight, which is very often, they use a short kind
of club. The natives paint their bodies over with red clay to
prevent the mosquitoes from biting them. When they paint their
bodies white it is a sign of war with some other tribe.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>A very remarkable instance of coincidence in this custom with
regard to the dead will be found in a subjoined extract from a
letter sent to me by an officer of the Beagle, together with a
skeleton which he had found at Cygnet Bay. The skeleton has been
presented to the Royal College of Surgeons:</p>

<p>The skeleton was found enveloped in three pieces of papyrus
bark, on a small sandy point in Cygnet Bay. All the bones were
closely packed together, and the head surmounted the whole. It
did not appear to have been long interred. They had evidently
been packed with care. All the long bones were undermost, and the
small ones were strewed in among them. The head was resting on
its base, face across.</p>

<p>Three natives were close to the place when we first landed:
the eldest of the party went up to the spot immediately after I
had removed the bones; he turned up the bark with his foot, and
did not appear to show the slightest symptom of uneasiness. They
were for some days among the watering party on very friendly
terms.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>CAVES. DRAWINGS. TOMBS.</p>

<p>As I never, during my subsequent travels in Australia, saw
anything at all resembling the painted caves which I have
described in the ninth chapter, I shall here add some
observations on the subject, which I could not have there
detailed without too great an interruption to the narrative.</p>

<p>Two other instances of Australian caves which contain
paintings have been recorded. The first is by Captain Flinders
and the second by Mr. Cunningham in King's voyage.</p>

<p>PAINTINGS AT CHASM ISLAND.</p>

<p>The caves found by Flinders were in Chasm Island, in the Gulf
of Carpentaria, and are thus described:*</p>

<p>In the steep sides of the chasms were deep holes or caverns
undermining the cliffs; upon the walls of which I found rude
drawings, made with charcoal, and something like red paint, upon
the white ground of the rock. These drawings represented
porpoises, turtles, kangaroos, and a human hand; and Mr. Westall,
who went afterwards to see them, found the representation of a
kangaroo, with a file of thirty-two persons following after it.
The third person of the band was twice the height of the others,
and held in his hand something resembling the waddy or wooden
sword of the natives of Port Jackson.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Flinders' Voyages volume 2 page
158.)</blockquote>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>PAINTINGS AT CLACK'S ISLAND.*</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. North-east coast of
Australia.)</blockquote>

<p>The second instance is taken from Mr. Cunningham's manuscripts
and is contained in the following extract:*</p>

<p>The south and south-eastern extremes of Clack's Island
presented a steep, rocky bluff, thinly covered with small trees.
I ascended the steep head, which rose to an elevation of a
hundred and eighty feet above the sea.</p>

<p>The remarkable structure of the geological features of this
islet led me to examine the south-east part, which was the most
exposed to the weather, and where the disposition of the strata
was of course more plainly developed. The base is a coarse,
granular, siliceous sandstone, in which large pebbles of quartz
and jasper are imbedded: this stratum continues for sixteen to
twenty feet above the water: for the next ten feet there is a
horizontal stratum of black schistose rock which was of so soft a
consistence that the weather had excavated several tiers of
galleries; upon the roof and sides of which some curious drawings
were observed, which deserve to be particularly described. They
were executed on a ground of red ochre (rubbed on the black
schistus) and were delineated by dots of a white argillaceous
earth, which had been worked up into a paste. They represented
tolerable figures of sharks, porpoises, turtles, lizards (of
which I saw several small ones among the rocks) trepang,
starfish, clubs, canoes, water gourds, and some quadrupeds, which
were probably intended to represent kangaroos and dogs. The
figures, besides being outlined by the dots, were decorated all
over with the same pigment in dotted transverse belts. Tracing a
gallery round to windward, it brought me to a commodious cave or
recess, overhung by a portion of the schistus, sufficiently large
to shelter twenty natives whose recent fire places appeared on
the projecting area of the cave.</p>

<p>Many turtles' heads were placed on the shelves or niches of
the excavation, amply demonstrative of the luxurious and profuse
mode of life these outcasts of society had, at a period rather
recently, followed. The roof and sides of this snug retreat were
also entirely covered with the uncouth figures I have already
described.</p>

<p>As this is the first specimen of Australian taste in the fine
arts that we have detected in these voyages it became me to make
a particular observation thereon: Captain Flinders had discovered
figures on Chasm Island, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, formed with
a burnt stick; but this performance, exceeding a hundred and
fifty figures, which must have occupied much time, appears at
least to be one step nearer refinement than those simply executed
with a piece of charred wood. Immediately above this schistose is
a superincumbent mass of sandstone which appeared to form the

<p>PAINTINGS IN THE YORK DISTRICT.</p>

<p>There is a third instance of a cave with a figure in it in the
district of York, in the settlement of Swan River; but in this
case the species of circle which is drawn on the cave, or rather
scraped into it with a piece of stone, may represent anything or
nothing; in fact it is no more than any idle or thoughtless
savage might have executed, without any fixed design whatever.
The only other vestige of drawing contained in the cave is
evidently the mere impression of a hand, which has been rubbed
over with the red paint with which the natives are in the
constant habit of bedaubing themselves, and has then been pressed
in on the wall.</p>

<p>NATIVE TRADITIONS.</p>

<p>I had been told that the natives had some very curious
traditions current amongst them with regard to this last cave
and, after having visited it and satisfied myself that there was
no analogy between it and the caves on the north-west continent
of Australia, I set about collecting some of the native stories
that related to it. These legends nearly all agreed in one point,
that originally the moon, who was a man, had lived there; but
beyond this there was nothing common to them all, for every
narrator indulged his own powers of invention to the greatest
possible degree, scarcely ever relating the same story twice, but
on each occasion inventing a new tradition; and the amount of
marvels and wonders which he unfolded in this revelation were
exactly proportioned to the quantity of food which I promised to
give him. I once or twice charged them with attempting to impose
upon my credulity and, far from denying the charge, they only
laughed and said, "that was a very good thing which they told me,
and that the Djanga (white men) liked it very much."</p>

<p>COLOURS USED IN PAINTING.</p>

<p>In the painted caves on the north-western coasts five colours
were used: red, several shades; yellow; blue; black, and white.
With the exception of blue these colours are all known to the
natives of the whole continent. The red they either dig up from
the earth, fit for use, in the form of red earthy pebbles, or
they find it in the form of a brilliant yellow clay, which they
beat, clean, and dry, leaving it exposed to the air for several
days, when they bake it in a bark basket, and then, if the clay
is good and it has been well prepared and burnt, it is nearly as
bright as vermilion. In some parts of the continent however no
good clay can be found; and in this case, at their annual fair,
where they meet to exchange certain commodities only locally
produced, this brilliant red ochre is considered a very valuable
article of traffic.</p>

<p>Yellow they obtain from several sources: the most common is
the yellow clay from which the red is afterwards produced, but
they also procure it from a stone which is traversed by veins of
yellow earth; from the interior of the nest of a species of ant
which collects a yellow dust; and from a sort of fungus from
which a similar dust is also obtained.</p>

<p>The black is nothing but finely pounded charcoal.</p>

<p>The white is a very fine greasy species of pipe-clay, common
all over Australia, and which they use either wet or dry.</p>

<p>How the blue colour used in the caves on the north-west was
obtained I do not know; it is very dark and brilliant, and
closely resembles the colour obtained from the seed-vessel of a
plant very common there, and which, on being broken, yields a few
drops of a brilliant blue liquid. I therefore imagined that it
was procured from this source.</p>

<p>AGE AND MOTIVE OF DRAWINGS.</p>

<p>With regard to the age of these paintings we had no clue
whatever to guide us. It is certain that they may have been very
ancient, for, although the colours were composed of such
perishable materials, they were all mixed with a resinous gum,
insoluble in water, and, no doubt, when thus prepared, they would
be capable of resisting, for a long period, the usual atmospheric
causes of decay. The painting which appeared to me to have been
the longest executed was the one clothed in the long red dress,
but I came to this conclusion solely from its state of decay and
dilapidation, and these may possibly have misled me very much;
but, whatever may have been the age of these paintings, it is
scarcely probable that they could have been executed by a
self-taught savage. Their origin therefore I think must still be
open to conjecture.</p>

<p>But the art and skill with which some of the figures are
drawn, and the great effect which has been produced by such
simple means, renders it most probable that these paintings must
have been executed with the intention of exercising an influence
upon the fears and superstitious feelings of the ignorant and
barbarous natives: for such a purpose they are indeed well
calculated; and I think that an attentive examination of the
arrangement of the figures we first discovered, more particularly
of that one over the entrance of the cave, will tend considerably
to bear out the conclusion I have here advanced.</p>

<p>SINGULARITY REGARDING THEM.</p>

<p>It is a singularity worthy of remark that the drawings we
found in the vicinity of the coast were nothing but the rudest
scratches; that they gradually improved until we reached the
farthest point we attained from the sea; and that it was in the
vicinity of this point that some of the best productions were
found.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 12. PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. COMMERCIAL PROSPECTS.</h2>

<p>PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. MOUNTAIN RANGES.</p>

<p>The most remarkable geographical feature in North-Western
Australia is a high range of mountains running north-north-east
and south-south-west, named by me Stephen's Range after James
Stephen, Esquire, Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. From
this primary range several branches are thrown off: 1. One
between Roe's River on the north and Prince Regent's River on the
south. 2. Macdonald's Range that throws off streams to Prince
Regent's River on the north and to Glenelg River on the south. 3.
Whateley's Range which gives forth streams to Glenelg River on
the north, and to the low country behind Collier's Bay and
Dampier's Land on the south.</p>

<p>These branch ranges as well as the principal one are all
composed of ancient sandstone, deposited in nearly horizontal
strata, or of basaltic rocks which are only visible in certain
places, and are most fully developed in that part of Stephen's
Range which lies behind Collier's Bay, and in the low ground near
Glenelg River.</p>

<p>With the extent of Stephen's Range I am unacquainted; but I
have no doubt that the high land whence the Fitzroy River takes
its rise is merely an under-feature again thrown off from it, and
which I propose to call Wickham's Range after Captain Wickham,
R.N., the discoverer of the Fitzroy.</p>

<p>We may form some idea of the limits of Stephen's Range in a
north and east direction from the following passage extracted
from Captain King's survey of these coasts:*</p>

<p>Lacrosse Island is situated in the entrance of a deep opening
trending to the south-south-west towards some steep, rugged
hills. The character of the country is here entirely changed.
Irregular ranges of detached rocky hills of sandstone formation,
very slightly clothed with small shrubs and rising abruptly from
extensive plains of low, level land, seem to have superseded the
low wooded coasts that almost uninterruptedly prevails between
this and Cape Wessel, a distance of more than six hundred
miles!</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. King's Australia volume 1 page
291.)</blockquote>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>It appears therefore that this main range contains within it
the sources of Roe's River, Prince Regent's and Glenelg Rivers,
most probably the Fitzroy, and those that run into Cambridge Gulf
and perhaps others that have their embouchures between this last
and Admiralty Gulf.</p>

<p>From an accident having occurred to the only barometer we
could carry with us I am unable to state the elevation of the
highest land we reached above the level of the sea; but the
appearance of the country on the coast does not give the
impression of any very elevated ground existing near it. This
however is owing to the great height of the shore cliffs and the
gradual rise of the land towards the interior. The following
observations, made with the barometer before it was broken, will
show however that the altitude of the country at no great
distance from the coast is considerable.</p>

<p>MACDONALD'S RANGE.</p>

<p>Our first encampment was on the banks of a small river at a
spot 2,640 feet from the sea. This river ran through a deep and
narrow valley, descending with a nearly regular slope from a
tableland of sandstone, in which it took its rise about seven
miles inland. At this encampment the height of the bed of the
river above the level of the sea was 188.76 feet, as found by the
mean of several very accordant observations, which, at the same
average slope, gives an elevation of about 377 feet for the
height of a spot on its banks distant only one mile from the sea;
and if we conceive the average increase of elevation to the
sandstone tableland to be only 200 feet in every mile (and I
believe it to have been more) we shall have 1400 feet for the
elevation of the tableland which formed one of the highest parts
of Macdonald's Range.</p>

<p>ELEVATION OF HILLS.</p>

<p>After passing across this range we again descended rapidly
into the low country, the face of which is much broken by conical
hills composed of basalt. The heights of some of these hills
above their base, which had a considerable elevation above the
sea level, were in three instances as follows:</p>

<p>February 28.</p>

<p>The measured height of a hill above its base was 331 feet.</p>

<p>March 4.</p>

<p>Measured the altitude of a hill above its base and found it to
be 222 feet.</p>

<p>March 8.</p>

<p>Measured the altitude of a hill above its base and found it to
be 229.5 feet.</p>

<p>None of these hills had apparently near so great an elevation
as the sandstone range of which they were under-features. At this
period our barometer was unfortunately broken. We now proceeded
up the banks of the Glenelg and arrived at many hills and conical
peaks, apparently much higher than those I had measured; yet on
afterwards passing the river and attaining the summit of the
opposite sandstone range, we looked down upon them as hills of
far inferior elevation to those on which we stood. From this
circumstance, and from the very perceptible change of temperature
we experienced, I should think the altitude of the farthest point
of Stephen's Range which we reached must have been 2,500 or 3,000
feet above the sea.</p>

<p>CHARACTER OF THE RIVERS.</p>

<p>The rivers in North-western Australia much resemble in
character those of the south-eastern parts of the continent. They
rise at no very great distance from the sea. Near their sources
they are mountain torrents, but in the lowlands they become
generally streams with slow currents, winding through fertile and
extensive valleys or plains which are liable to sudden and
terrific inundations, caused, I conceive, by the rain which falls
in that part of the mountains where the rivers take their rise;
for at one period, when we had our encampment on the bank of the
small stream near the sea at Hanover Bay, I was myself distant
about fourteen miles in the interior in the direction of its
source, where we had heavy rain; and on my return I found that
the party at the station had been surprised by a sudden rising of
the water for which there was no apparent cause as there had been
no rain where they were.</p>

<p>The Glenelg River, in like manner, is subject to sweeping
inundations, rising sometimes to the height of fourteen to
fifteen feet above its usual level, as was evinced by the weeds
and other substances we saw in the trees on its banks.</p>

<p>To show that these are characteristics of the Fitzroy River I
shall quote the authority of Captain Wickham from a letter
addressed to me just before our meeting at Hanover Bay:</p>

<p>It (the Fitzroy) appears to be very similar to the rivers on
the south-east side of New Holland, subject to dreadful
inundations, caused by heavy floods in the interior, and in no
way connected with the rainy season on the coast. Our visit to it
being in February and March, immediately after the rainy season
on the coast, without our seeing any indication of a recent
flooding, although there were large trunks of trees and
quantities of grass and weeds lying on the bank and suspended
from the branches of trees from ten to twelve feet above the
level of the river. The bed is entirely of sand.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>INUNDATIONS.</p>

<p>It will be clearly seen how nearly this corresponds with what
we observed about the same season on the banks of the Glenelg. I
have therefore little doubt that the Fitzroy takes its origin
from the same mountain chain, and that the inundations described
by Captain Wickham originate in the causes which I have here
assigned.</p>

<p>To demonstrate more clearly the similarity of character of
these rivers with those of New South Wales I shall quote two
passages from the British Colonies of Mr. Montgomery Martin,
regarding the Hawkesbury and Hunter Rivers of that colony:</p>

<p>The Hawkesbury, which is a continuation of the Nepean River,
after the junction of the latter with a considerable stream,
called the Grose, issues from a remarkable cleft in the Blue
Mountains in the vicinity of the beautiful town of Richmond,
about forty miles from Sydney. Along the base of these mountains
the Hawkesbury flows in a northerly direction, fed by numerous
tributary mountain torrents, descending from narrow gorges,
which, after heavy rains, cause the Hawkesbury to rise and
overflow its banks as it approaches the sea. In one instance it
rose near the town of Windsor ninety-seven feet above its
ordinary level. Volume 4 page 257.</p>

<p>Again he says, page 258:</p>

<p>Hunter's River, about seventy miles to the northward of Port
Jackson, disembogues into the sea at the harbour of
Newcastle.</p>

<p>There are three branches to the Hunter, called the upper, the
lower, and the middle: the two former are navigable for boats for
about 120 miles, and the latter for about 200 miles; but the
branches are all subject to sudden and terrific inundations owing
to the rapid descent of torrents from the Blue Mountains.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>MOUTH OF THE GLENELG.</p>

<p>In concluding my remarks on the rivers of the north-west I
should state that Mr. Stokes, the surveyor of the Beagle, after a
careful examination of the coast did not succeed in finding the
mouth of the Glenelg; and he imagines that it has several
openings, consisting of large mangrove creeks, which fall into
Stokes Bay; whilst it is my impression that it will be found to
run out somewhere between Camden Sound and Collier's Bay, and
that by some accidental circumstance its mouth was missed. That
it joins the sea in a considerable body I should infer from a
shoal of porpoises having been seen high up the river, and from
the rise and fall of tide, which was twenty feet at the direct
distance of thirty miles from the coast.</p>

<p>VALLEYS.</p>

<p>The valleys in this country are of two kinds: those which are
almost ravines, bordered on each side by nearly inaccessible
cliffs; and valleys of great width, bordered by fertile plains,
often extensive, and which occur where the basaltic rocks are
developed; although ravines of this formation are also of
frequent occurrence in the mountainous parts.</p>

<p>CHARACTER OF THE VALLEYS. SOIL.</p>

<p>The soil found in the valleys of the former kind is extremely
rich, but they are all subject to very heavy inundations. As an
example of this kind of valley I may cite the one in which we
first encamped. Its mean width was only 147 feet, and the rocky
precipitous cliffs at half a mile from the sea rose above their
base 138 feet. These deep valleys undoubtedly afford water at all
seasons of the year.</p>

<p>The sandstone formation is intersected in all directions by
valleys of this kind, which are seldom more than from two to
three miles apart, while the top of the range between them is a
tableland, divided by lateral valleys and gently rising towards
the interior. Seawards they all terminate in saltwater creeks,
having the same narrow, rocky, and precipitous character as they
present themselves.</p>

<p>These tablelands afford good timber, particularly pine. Sheep
thrive upon the food there produced, but we found goats did not
answer so well.</p>

<p>The richest land in this part of the country is found in the
valleys of the second class. The streams flowing through these
valleys have generally almost imperceptible currents and often
form wide reaches. The land upon their margins is thinly wooded;
and I have often seen exposed fine vegetable mould of ten or
twelve feet in thickness, through which these streams had worn
their way. Good examples of this kind of valley are those through
which run the Fitzroy and Glenelg rivers.</p>

<p>The northern banks of Prince Regent's River I conceive to
offer no inducement whatever for the formation of a settlement,
the whole of the country in that direction, as far as I have
seen, consisting entirely of sandstone ridges. These ridges are
continually intersected by valleys, or rather ravines of great
fertility, but they are so narrow, and the good land contained in
them is so very limited in extent, that from the first moment of
the establishment of a colony here the individuals composing it
must necessarily be scattered over a large space of country. They
would thus be separated from one another by considerable
intervals, which separation would not only render them more
liable to disagreements with the natives, but would for many
other reasons be highly detrimental to the interests of an infant
colony.</p>

<p>The same objection holds good with regard to the south bank of
this river, as far as the longitude of 125 degrees 3 minutes
east, and even after passing this point the land immediately
bordering the river is of the same sterile character; however a
creek which trends nearly south runs up from thence into one of
the most fertile countries I have ever seen.</p>

<p>HARBOURS.</p>

<p>The coastline to the south of Prince Regent's River is
indented, as shown upon Captain King's chart, by numerous deep
bays, many of which afford excellent anchorage; indeed I believe
that there is no other part of the world in which an example
occurs of three such fine harbours as Port George the Fourth,
Hanover Bay, and Camden Sound, lying so close to one another.</p>

<p>These harbours alone render this a point of considerable
consequence to Great Britain; but when viewed in connexion with
the fine tract of country lying behind them its importance is
very materially increased.</p>

<p>COMMERCIAL ADVANTAGES.</p>

<p>Should this part of Australia be found eligible for
colonization its commercial importance is well worthy of
consideration.</p>

<p>PRODUCTIONS SUITED FOR CULTIVATION. COTTON TRADE.</p>

<p>The cultivated productions for the growth of which the country
and climate seem best adapted are cotton, sugar, indigo, and
rice.</p>

<p>A species of cotton plant grows wild in the greatest
abundance, and if a colony was established and the proper
cotton-plant introduced the following advantages would be
obtained:</p>

<p>Great Britain would possess in Northern Australia a colony
standing in the same relation to her manufacturies for cotton
that her colonies in the south do to her wool-market.</p>

<p>This colony would also form a sort of entrepot to which the
manufactured cotton would again be exported for the purpose of
sale in the islands of the Indian Archipelago or its vicinity,
and other parts where we have at present no trade, and where
printed cottons now are, and from the nature of these countries
must constantly be, in great demand.</p>

<p>Thus a fresh supply of cotton for our markets would be
obtained, which, coming from an English colony, would give
employment to British vessels alone, and the industry of our
manufacturers would be called into operation by an entirely new
market for cotton goods being thrown open to them, in which the
demand for these articles is far greater than the supply could be
for many years.</p>

<p>ARTICLES OF EXPORT.</p>

<p>The natural productions that are at present found in
North-west Australia and might be available for exportation
consist chiefly of timber, gum, lichens, and mimosa bark; all of
which are abundant, and might be collected with a trifling degree
of labour.</p>

<p>There are many varieties of useful timber. Among others, pine,
fit for the purposes either of building or making spars for
vessels, is abundant and good, and could be readily and cheaply
exported if they were cut in the vicinity of the streams and
floated down to the sea in the rainy season, whereby all land
carriage would be avoided.</p>

<p>I sent to England specimens of five different gums in order
that they might be examined. These consist of an elastic gum,
closely resembling Indian rubber, gum tragacynth, another gum
yielded by a sort of capparis and which I believe to be hitherto
unknown, and two kinds of gum resin.</p>

<p>The mosses are of various kinds, many of which would afford
useful dyes; and these, together with the gums, would probably be
found valuable articles of export; for the collecting of them is
a species of labour in which the native tribes would more
willingly engage than any other I am acquainted with.</p>

<p>Immediately off North-West Cape is good whaling ground. The
schooner employed on the expedition fell in with two vessels--the
Favourite, Captain White, and the Diana, Captain Hamott, whalers
belonging to Messrs. Bennett &amp; Co., of London, and then
fishing between North-West Cape and the position usually assigned
to the Tryal Rocks. Both these vessels had been very
successful.</p>

<p>COMMERCIAL PROSPECTS. TRADE WITH THE ASIATIC ARCHIPELAGO.</p>

<p>With regard to the commerce that might be carried on by
Northern Australia with the islands of the Indian Archipelago I
have made many enquiries, and have gained from the most authentic
sources some important facts.</p>

<p>The points upon which I first endeavoured to obtain
information were:</p>

<p>1. What desire was evinced by the inhabitants of the islands
of the Indian Archipelago and the China Sea to become possessed
of articles of British manufacture; and,</p>

<p>2. If they were able to pay a fair price, either in money, or
by giving goods for which there would be a demand in European
markets, in exchange for such articles of British manufacture as
might be introduced amongst them.</p>

<p>Upon both of these points I received very satisfactory
information. In some instances most respectable merchants
detailed to me the result of speculations of this kind in which
they had been engaged; in others mercantile letters were placed
in my hands, fully corroborating what had been told me; but the
information I thus obtained bore reference also to the following
points:</p>

<p>1. The degree of labour necessarily required to transport
articles of British manufacture to such a distant mart as the one
here contemplated for their consumption.</p>

<p>2. The length of time during which wages must be paid to and
food provided for the individuals engaged in this labour.</p>

<p>3. The duties to which the articles will become liable in the
various ports; and,</p>

<p>4. The danger of loss or injury that may be incurred in their
transport thither.</p>

<p>With regard to the two first of the above heads it appears
that the profit that may be realized by the trader is so
considerable as not only to cover the expenses that they would
necessarily entail upon him; but after these expenses have been
defrayed the residue of profit that would remain in his hands
would be so large as to render this commerce one of the most
lucrative in which capital could be embarked.</p>

<p>METHOD OF BARTER.</p>

<p>This will be readily conceived when it is considered that the
mode of barter is that which is most usual amongst the
inhabitants, and that the trader puts his own valuation upon the
articles he exchanges with them. One of the oldest and most
respectable merchants at the Cape made a voyage through these
islands for the purpose of procuring gold dust, and he detailed
to me the mode in which he conducted the traffic. A Spanish
doubloon was placed in one of the scales, and gold dust in the
other; when the quantity of gold dust was equal in weight to the
doubloon, he gave a doubloon's worth of goods they required, at
his own valuation; the profit realized was large.</p>

<p>One great drawback to this commerce at present is the
necessity of coasting from place to place in order to obtain a
full cargo. The same inconvenience was felt along the coasts of
Africa and Madagascar until some enterprising London and
Liverpool mercantile houses established the system of receiving
vessels, which remained stationary at one point whilst smaller
vessels collected cargoes for them. Now a colony in some northern
part of Australia would in the same manner totally obviate this
inconvenience by affording a place in which cargoes could be
collected from small vessels, and to which the British
manufactures to be exchanged could be brought. Kupang in Timor at
the present moment is used for this purpose by the Dutch.</p>

<p>DUTIES LEVIED AT THE ISLANDS.</p>

<p>With regard to the third point I find that at the native
ports, in general, no duty is required; but where there is a
Rajah it is politic to make him a present in goods. The duties
levied by the Portuguese at Dili in the month of June 1838 was 10
per cent. With regard to the duties levied by the Dutch on
British merchant vessels I know but little; but the duty demanded
at Kupang and Roti on each horse exported, or each musket
imported, was six rupees, being almost equal to their original
value. Arms or ammunition are no longer contraband either in the
Dutch or Portuguese possessions.</p>

<p>In considering the danger of loss or injury that may be
incurred in the transport of merchandise to these parts it is
unnecessary to compute the ordinary dangers to which the merchant
is more or less liable in all quarters of the world; but two
distinct drawbacks to commercial enterprise at present exist in
these countries, which are peculiar to them, these are the
prevalence of piracy, and the constant occurrence of political
commotions in the native states. The establishment of a
settlement on the north or north-west coast of New Holland would
have however the effect of diminishing both these evils in so
great a degree that a very few years would probably suffice for
their complete annihilation.</p>

<p>SUCCESS OF AMERICAN VESSELS. CAUSES OF IT.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the drawbacks occasioned to commercial
enterprise by the circumstances above detailed, there at this
moment exists a very considerable trade in the Indian
Archipelago, which is, with the exception of the few vessels that
sometimes bring ponies to the Isle of France and the British
settlements, almost wholly in the hands of the Americans. Indeed
no fact which I have met with has so much surprised me as the
extraordinary diffusion of the American commerce, and the great
spirit of enterprise exhibited by them. For in many places where
the British merchants can find no commerce apparently worth their
attention the Americans carry on a lucrative and prosperous
trade, and in half-civilized countries, where the largest profits
are always realized, the Americans are so eminently successful
that the British merchant cannot attempt to compete with
them.</p>

<p>This appears to arise from the following circumstance. The
masters of the American vessels engaged in this kind of trade
are, in many instances, whole, and in all other instances, part
owners of the vessel and cargo; whereas masters of English
vessels have frequently little or no interest in the vessel and
cargo, and are moreover frequently tied down by directions issued
from the firm for which they act.</p>

<p>The difference between these two cases is very great; the
American can turn every circumstance that occurs to account: he
can instantly enter into any speculation that holds out a
prospect of success; and can act with rapidity and decision on
his own responsibility. The English master, on the contrary, has
usually a certain prescribed line of duty to fulfil, from which
he cannot vary.</p>

<p>Hence it is that we often see the American whalers with arms,
ammunition, and other articles for barter on board. They whale
off Madagascar, and, whenever an opportunity offers, carry on a
lucrative trade with the natives. From thence their course is
directed to St. Paul's and Amsterdam, and afterwards along the
coast of New Holland; and when it again becomes necessary for
them to refresh they touch at some island in the Archipelago, and
the scene of barter is once more renewed. Their cargo eventually
consists of sperm oil, gum copal and other gums, ebony,
tortoiseshell, gold dust, seal-skins, shells, and curiosities;
yet they originally started upon a whaling voyage.</p>

<p>INSTANCES.</p>

<p>During the years 1824 and 1825, when the port of Mombas upon
the East Coast of Africa was temporarily ceded to the British
Government, Lieutenant Emery, R.N., who was stationed there as
commander, was witness to a curious instance of this nature.</p>

<p>Whilst this port was in the possession of the English but one
British merchant vessel arrived there, yet three American vessels
entered the harbour. The master of the English vessel was not a
part owner; the American masters were all part owners and carried
on a very lucrative trade, shipping a large quantity of ivory,
whereas the English master was placed in a very unpleasant
position, for, owing to the orders he had received from his
owners (Messrs Tobin and Co. of Liverpool) he had not been able
to ship a cargo suited to the market of Mombas, and if Lieutenant
Emery had not kindly cashed a bill for him the speculation would
have been a total failure.</p>

<p>The cargo these American vessels brought to Mombas was
principally muskets and ammunition, which they bartered with the
natives for ivory; and this is the cargo they always ship for
trade with the inhabitants of the Indian Archipelago, and, as
muskets and ammunition are there of great value, the profit they
realize is enormous.</p>

<p>As an instance of the kind of persons these American masters
often are I may state the following circumstance.</p>

<p>Captain Wickham, R.N., was at Valparaiso in South America in
the year 1836, where he met a purser in the American navy who had
realized about 3000 pounds sterling; this person here quitted the
American service and laid out his capital in the purchase of a
small vessel in which, having embarked a cargo suited to the
trade of the country, he started for the coast of California; in
a short period he returned to Valparaiso, having in this single
trip more than doubled his capital; this Captain Wickham also
stated was by no means a rare instance.</p>

<p>TRADING PRODUCTS OF THE SEVERAL ISLANDS.</p>

<p>Having bestowed some attention on the state of trade in the
Indian Archipelago, and collected considerable information from
various individuals who had been engaged in it, I shall here
subjoin a summary of such of the principal facts as I think may
be depended on.</p>

<p>TRADE WITH TIMOR.</p>

<p>In all the ports of the natives, as well as those under the
Dutch and Portuguese authorities, the produce is much the same.
It consists chiefly of goats, pigs, poultry, maize, paddy, yams,
plantains, fruit, sandalwood, beeswax, and tortoiseshell in small
quantities.</p>

<p>At Dili duties of 10 per cent are exacted and produce is
rather dear. Sandalwood is to be had at from 2 to 4 dollars the
picul of 125 catties; wax is generally from 30 to 35 dollars
(Spanish) the picul of 110 catties.</p>

<p>The ports of Timor furnish a little gold dust at times. Good
water and firewood are to be had at most of them; that of Dili is
a good and safe one.</p>

<p>Gold dust, I understand, is also procurable at Sandalwood
Island and New Hebrides.</p>

<p>For vessels the good season on the coast is from about the
10th of April to the 15th of October.</p>

<p>Cootababa affords horses and all the produce of the other
places. No duties are levied here, the place not being subject to
the Portuguese. It is a small port and should be entered with
caution.</p>

<p>The best ports of Timor for wax are Dili, Cootababa, Ocussi,
Sitranny, Nilow, and Manatronto. It is gathered in June, cleaned
in July, and sold principally in that and the two following
months; but a vessel should be active, as enterprising people go
along the coast and buy it up for the Kupang merchants, who send
it to Batavia where it is said to sell for 120 rupees the picul;
the price at Cootababa, being lately about 80 rupees at 2 1/2 to
the Spanish dollar.</p>

<p>Sandalwood can be had from March to October, the usual trading
season; but from March to May is the best time as vessels from
Kupang and Macao are on the coast early, buying it up in time to
return to Macao and China in the favourable monsoon. The best
ports for sandalwood are, Cootababa, Ocussi, and Sitranny, but it
is to be had most abundantly at Ata-poopa.</p>

<p>ARTICLES IN REQUEST.</p>

<p>Spanish dollars, muskets, and gunpowder are the essentials for
procuring wax or sandalwood, but if you wish to have a greater
assortment, small quantities may be added of any articles from
the following list.</p>

<p>Doubloons (Spanish).<br>
Sovereigns (English).<br>
blue cloth of Pondicherry of good quality.<br>
ditto English (if cheap) of dark colour for officers.<br>
white shirting or good calico for men and women.<br>
handkerchiefs of colours and sorts.<br>
white cotton stockings.<br>
men and women's gown pieces of sorts and colours.<br>
silk stockings, plain and ribbed.<br>
shoes for men and women.<br>
brandy, rum, gin, lead and flints.<br>
quart-glass decanters, cruet stands, dress swords, wine glasses
and rummers, knives and forks, razors, needles, scissors,
earrings, bracelets, shawls of sorts, mock jewellery, sugar,
soap, biscuits.</p>

<p>Bally and Surabaya are good places for rice, but more
especially the former, as it is to be had cheap, especially if
bartered for opium. The rice can be carried to Macao where a good
price can always be obtained for it.</p>

<p>Puloo, Batao, and Ocussi on the coast of Timor are good places
for obtaining tortoiseshell at all times, as well as the islands
in front of Timor, from October to December. The price is about
800 Spanish dollars per picul in cash; but in exchange for blue
or white cloth, powder, arms, flint, etc., it would be obtained
for much less.</p>

<p>Roti and Bally are both good places for ponies in exchange for
cash or goods.</p>

<p>The following is an account of our purchase and barter at the
island of Roti in January 1838:</p>

<p>10 horses for 10 muskets (old).<br>
4 horses for 2 fowling-pieces (old).<br>
9 horses for 27 1/2 rupees each.<br>
3 mares for 22 rupees each.<br>
8 sheep for an old regimental breastplate.<br>
14 goats for a pair of pistols (old).<br>
The duty on each horse was six rupees.</p>

<p>In Mr. Earle's translation of the account of the voyage of the
Dutch colonial brig Dourga, which, it is stated, left Amboyna May
26th 1825 and visited the islands of Kissa, Lettee, Mon, Damma,
Lakor, and Luan,* it is said, in speaking of them:</p>

<p>The clothing of those who cannot obtain European or Indian
cotton cloth is pieces of prepared bark fastened round their
waists.</p>

<p>The productions of these islands are sandalwood, beeswax,
pearls, tortoiseshell, trepang, edible birds' nests, Indian corn,
rice, vegetables, with abundance of livestock. As the use of
money is scarcely known these are only to be obtained by barter
in exchange for cotton cloths, brass wire, iron chopping knives,
and coarse cutlery. The first article, cotton cloth, is most in
demand and M. Kolff suggests that a European merchant might carry
on an advantageous trade here. The value of an ox is from 8
shillings and 4 pence to 10 shillings; of a sheep from 3
shillings and 4 pence to 5 shillings. Beeswax can be obtained in
abundance at Roma at the rate of 2 pounds 7 shillings per
hundredweight. The trade with the islands is carried on solely by
natives, those of Macassar, Amboyna, and the Arru Islands being
the chief purchasers; and Chinese brigs from Java occasionally
visit Kissa.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. The Serwatty Islands to the east of Timor
see the map of the Asiatic Archipelago by Mr. John
Arrowsmith.)</blockquote>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>Geby, an island in the Gellola passage, has a fine harbour; a
large quantity of tortoiseshell can be obtained there for trade
with the natives. The Asia's Islands, lying a short distance to
the northward, are not inhabited but abound in turtle.</p>

<p>TRADE WITH THE ISLANDS OF THE ASIATIC ARCHIPELAGO.</p>

<p>The following points of information concerning the Indian
Archipelago were furnished by Captain Brodie, formerly in command
of a Dutch vessel of 326 tons:</p>

<p>In case of a necessity for repairing or coppering a vessel
Surabaya is the best place as it can be done well and cheap. Wood
for ship-building is abundant; and good carpenters can be had at
the rate of 20 copper doits per diem, that is to say, three men
for a rupee a day.</p>

<p>The Malaccas are under Dutch government, of which Ternate
forms a part. It is said to be a good place to dispose of odds
and ends,* and for getting a little shell. It is also a good
place for refreshments.</p>

<p>Banda is not so good a place to go to, if another is at hand,
as it is for a merchant vessel a strictly prohibited port. In
fact the Spice islands, or Malaccas, can be entered for water and
refreshments.</p>

<p>At Timor (Kupang) you can get sandalwood, wax, and a little
shell, but dear.</p>

<p>At the north-east end of Celebes there are two other places,
Monado and Keema, where the best gormootip or black coir rope can
be obtained at about 7 rupees per picul. These two places are
under the Dutch government. Some little business might be done
there: stock in particular is cheap.</p>

<p>At the island of Ceram the inhabitants are said to be
favourable to the English, but Dutch vessels of war cruise often
about there, and are very jealous.</p>

<p>Bouton, a small island with a Rajah under Dutch protection,
situate at the south-east end of Celebes, and off the bay of
Boni, is a place where prows assemble and get vast quantities of
shells and beche-de-mer. Nearly all these prows proceed with
their cargoes to Singapore for a Chinese market.</p>

<p>Fine cattle are to be had at about four dollars a head at the
town of Bally, in the Straits of Allass, between Lombok and
Sumbawa.</p>

<p>New Guinea produces good beeswax, pearls, tortoise-shell,
trepang, birds-of-paradise, etc.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Another authority says: Tidore near
Ternate is a good friendly place. Articles for trade are
looking-glasses of a better kind, knives and forks, beads,
watches, printed calicos, blue Pondicherry cloth, Salimpores,
arms, powder, flints, lead or shot, razors, scissors,
handkerchiefs; in return for which you may get pearls,
pearl-shell, tortoiseshell, birds-of-paradise, nutmegs,
etc.)</blockquote>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>FIELD FOR ENTERPRISE.</p>

<p>I shall conclude this subject with some remarks of Mr. John
Sullivan. R.N., a gentleman who possesses a vast fund of
information regarding the Indian Archipelago, and to whom I am
indebted for many details regarding its commerce. He says:</p>

<p>To suppose that the almost countless islands in the ocean
before-named (the Pacific) do not give many valuable articles,
and particularly tortoiseshell and pearl, would be no less an
error than to doubt the existence of the islands altogether.</p>

<p>No, the case is otherwise; and it is needless to say that in
the quarter alluded to there are already a few American
merchants, who have discovered by their China, whaling, and
sealing voyages many sources of wealth, and who are at this
moment reaping rich rewards for their toil, while 999 out of
every thousand of the European world know nothing at all about
it. Nevertheless there is yet a vast field open to the
speculator, which must ever promise ample recompense for his
confidence and outlay.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 13. AT SWAN RIVER.</h2>

<p>PLAN FOR RETURNING TO THE NORTH-WEST COAST. WHY ABANDONED.</p>

<p>On arriving at the Mauritius I found that my stay would be
unavoidably protracted from the state of my wound, which the want
of rest and attention had prevented from healing during the
expedition, whilst my men were still suffering under the effects
of the hardships and privations they had recently been subjected
to; my first step therefore was to discharge the Lynher, and the
next to consider a plan for future operations.</p>

<p>The rivers Fitzroy and Glenelg, simultaneously discovered by
Captain Wickham and myself, although of considerable magnitude,
were only sufficient to account for the drainage of a small
portion of the vast continent of Australia, and this interesting
question, far from being placed in a clearer point of view by our
expeditions, was if possible involved in deeper obscurity than
ever. I was therefore anxious to return to the north-west coast
and solve the mystery that still hung over those regions; but,
after considering various plans and suggestions, in which I was
kindly assisted by the advice and opinions of Sir William
Nicolay, then Governor of the Mauritius, I was induced to forego
the intention of proceeding again direct to the north-west, and
to bend my course in the first instance to Swan River. There I
could consult Sir James Stirling, the Governor, who had been
instructed on our departure from England to afford us every
assistance; and, according to the means which could then be
obtained, I might either proceed again by sea to the vicinity of
the Glenelg or the Fitzroy; or, if a proper vessel and equipments
could not be had, I might endeavour to pass the range to the
north-east of that colony, ascertain the direction of the streams
which must be thrown off by it to the interior, and trace the
main river into which they fell (if such there was) to its
outlet.</p>

<p>PROCEED TO SWAN RIVER.</p>

<p>I accordingly embarked my party and the stores in my
possession at Port Louis on the 21st August 1838, and arrived on
the 18th September at Swan River, where I lost no time in
communicating my views to Sir James Stirling, who concurred in
the plan for returning to the north-west; and it was arranged
that as soon as the colonial vessel Champion, then absent on a
voyage to St. George's Sound, should come back to the Swan, it
should be prepared for the conveyance to Camden Bay of myself and
party, reinforced by such additional persons as might feel
disposed to proceed there at their own cost for speculative
purposes.</p>

<p>RETURN TO THE NORTH-WEST FRUSTRATED.</p>

<p>It was not however until the month of December following that
the Colonial schooner became disposable, and then new impediments
arose from her being found so much in want of repair as to be, in
Sir James Stirling's opinion, scarcely in a condition to proceed
on such a voyage as we contemplated, whilst the repairs required
were of a nature which could not be effected in the Colony. From
these and other considerations, more especially the danger and
disappointment likely to be experienced for want of proper
equipment, which it was found very difficult to supply at the
Swan in an effective and satisfactory manner, the expedition to
the North-west was deemed unadvisable and for the present given
up.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary here to dwell on the mortification I felt at
being obliged thus to abandon my long-cherished projects. The
delays I had already experienced were sufficiently vexatious, but
I had endeavoured to turn the time thus lost to some profit by
endeavouring to acquaint myself with the resources of the
country, as well as in acquiring information of a scientific
nature, and I had attained such a knowledge of the language of
the natives as enabled me to form a vocabulary of the different
dialects spoken in these parts, which was printed and forwarded
to England at the close of the year.</p>

<p>My excursions into the country from Perth whilst awaiting the
arrival and fitting out of the Champion were necessarily short,
but the journal of one to the northward, made in company with my
young friend Mr. Frederick Smith, who afterwards fell a sacrifice
in the expedition to Shark Bay, will I think be interesting
enough to be inserted here.</p>

<p>EXCURSION TO THE NORTH OF PERTH.</p>

<p>November 30.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith and myself started at noon this day, accompanied by
Corporal Auger and two natives, upon a trip in a northerly
direction; about 5 P.M. we reached a lake distant about fifteen
miles from Perth, and called by the natives Mooloore: we halted
here for the night.</p>

<p>The horses were scarcely tethered and our fire made when four
more natives joined the party; their names were Noogongoo,
Kurral, Jeebar, and Dudemurry; they brought us a present of
twenty-seven freshwater tortoises, the average weight of each of
which was half a pound. They said that, although the lake was
called Mooloore, the name of the land we were sitting on was
Doondalup.</p>

<p>STORY-TELLING.</p>

<p>As soon as supper was finished they became very talkative,
and, in a sort of recitative, recounted various adventures; and,
when they conceived that they had sufficiently entertained me,
they requested me to give them an account of my adventures in the
northern part of the country, where they had heard from other
natives that I had been for some time.</p>

<p>Having now acquired some knowledge of their language, I was
able to make myself tolerably intelligible to them, and they
listened with the greatest anxiety and interest to the various
misfortunes that befel me. When they heard that I had been
wounded by the natives to the north no persuasions or
protestations upon my part could convince them that my object in
now proceeding in that direction again was merely to gratify
curiosity, and not from motives of revenge; but they kept
continually requesting me not to attempt to kill anybody until I
had passed a spot named Yalgarrin, about ten days journey to the
north, and they then advised me indiscriminately to shoot
everybody I saw; and were the more urgent in pressing the
adoption of this course upon me from the fact of a quarrel
existing between some of their relatives and the tribe dwelling
there.</p>

<p>After I had exhausted the theme of my northern journey they
desired me to give them some information with regard to England;
I therefore related various circumstances which I thought would
amuse them. Amongst other things I described the track of the sun
in the heavens in those northern latitudes; this they fully
understood, and it excited their most unqualified admiration. I
now spoke to them of still more northern latitudes; and went so
far as to describe those countries in which the sun never sets at
a certain period of the year.</p>

<p>ITS IMPRESSION ON THE NATIVES.</p>

<p>Their astonishment now knew no bounds: "Ah I that must be
another sun; not the same as the one we see here," said an old
man; and in spite of all my arguments to the contrary, the others
adopted this opinion. I wound up the night's conversation by an
account of the diminutive Laplanders, clothed in skins of the
seal instead of kangaroo; and amidst the shouts of applause that
this account excited I laid down to rest. I this night observed a
circumstance which had often before struck me, namely, that
savages care but little for narratives concerning civilized man,
but that anything connected with other races in the same state is
most greedily received by them.</p>

<p>December 1.</p>

<p>Before sunrise this morning the two natives Yenmar and
Nganmar, who had accompanied us from Perth, came to me and said
that, from what I had told them last night, it appeared that some
cause of quarrel existed between myself and the natives to the
north; and that, however pacifically I might now express myself,
they felt convinced that, if a fair opportunity offered, I should
revenge myself upon some northern native. Now they, being
southern men, had nothing whatever to do with these quarrels and
disputes, and therefore they should at once return to Perth.</p>

<p>I did my utmost by means of protestations and promises to
induce them to forego this resolution, but in vain; and the only
boon I could gain from them was that they would accompany me to
another tribe, distant about five miles, some of whom would
probably go on with me; they, at the same time, assured me that
they would preserve the most profound secrecy as to the fact of
my having any cause of quarrel to the northward; and advised me
to hold my tongue upon this point and quietly shoot the first man
I saw there.</p>

<p>MEETING WITH OTHER NATIVES.</p>

<p>Finding that the arrangement pointed out by these natives was
the only one I could adopt I was obliged to follow their advice,
and we accordingly moved off in a north-east, and then north-east
by east direction. After travelling over about four miles of
country we heard the distant cries of natives, and soon after
came up with and found them engaged in the pleasant occupation of
carrying two wounded men on their shoulders into Perth. These men
had quarrelled and had settled the dispute to their mutual
satisfaction, as well as to that of their friends, by spearing
each other through their respective thighs. One of the poor
fellows was very ill and told me that his intention was to sit
down at my house in Perth until he was well--and he kept his
promise.</p>

<p>I had many friends amongst these natives and soon selected
four to accompany me, their names were Warrup, Jenna, Dwer, and
Ugat. There were five northern natives with the tribe who had
never seen white men; they seemed to view us with great suspicion
at first, but the present of a little bread soon placed us on the
most friendly terms; and, after about half an hour's halt, we
separated, they proceeding to Perth whilst we pursued a northerly
course. After having made about four miles in this direction we
halted for the day at the head of the Lake Moolore.</p>

<p>LAKE COUNTRY.</p>

<p>December 2.</p>

<p>We started before dawn, travelling in nearly a straight line
across the country, our compass course being 329 degrees from the
north. After we had made about three miles we reached a swampy
lake, called Nirrooba, covered with wild-fowl. We here halted and
prepared our breakfast whilst the natives went out to hunt. I
soon shot a brace of wild ducks, and they speared nine; I now
gave little Ugat my gun, and he brought in four more ducks,
making a total of fifteen. Part of these we cooked, and kept the
remainder for our dinner. I forgot to mention that we yesterday
shot twelve parakeets.</p>

<p>I wandered for some distance about the eastern side of this
lake and saw some very good land, I should say at least fifty
acres; and, in addition to this land of the best quality, there
was plenty of good feed for cattle all round the lake.</p>

<p>DELAY, AND BIVOUACK.</p>

<p>At 2 P.M. we started again in a due north direction and,
having proceeded about four miles, reached a lake called
Nowoorgoop. We now changed our course to north and by west, and,
after travelling six miles more, came to a lake called, by the
natives, Beeulengurrinyup; the water was however so thick and
muddy that I determined, although it was getting late, to proceed
further; we therefore changed our course to north and by east,
and after travelling for about four miles more reached another
lake, called Maubeebee. This lake was about three-quarters of a
mile long. Mr. Smith's feet had latterly become so sore that he
had been compelled to tie pieces of kangaroo skin over them, and
thus equipped to walk without his half-boots; and, on coming in
to our bivouac, I had the mortification to hear that, having been
put carelessly on the horses, one of these boots had fallen down;
I saw therefore that it would be necessary to let him and a
native go back the next day upon the two horses we had with us
for the purpose of finding it. To Europeans it would seem rather
a visionary task to travel twelve or fourteen miles in a
trackless forest in the hope of recovering a boot, but the
natives' eyes are so keen that their finding it amounted to a
matter of certainty.</p>

<p>LOVELY BIVOUACK.</p>

<p>Our bivouac this night had a beauty about it which would have
made anyone possessed with the least enthusiasm fall in love with
a bush life. We were sitting on a gently-rising ground which
sloped away gradually to a picturesque lake surrounded by wooded
hills, whilst the moon shone so brightly on the lake that the
distance was perfectly clear, and we could distinctly see the
large flocks of wildfowl as they passed over our heads and then
splashed into the water, darkening and agitating its silvery
surface; in front of us blazed a cheerful fire, round which were
the dark forms of the natives, busily engaged in roasting ducks
for us; the foreground was covered with graceful grass trees and,
at the moment we commenced supper, I made the natives set fire to
the dried tops of two of these, and by the light of these
splendid chandeliers, which threw a red glare over the whole
forest in our vicinity, we ate our evening meal; then, closing
round the fire, rolled ourselves up in our blankets and laid down
to sleep.</p>

<p>December 3.</p>

<p>At dawn this morning Mr. Smith and Warrup started on the
horses in search of his boot; and I spent the day in shooting
wildfowl and various kind of game, as well as in collecting words
from the natives for my vocabulary. About 4 P.M. Mr. Smith
returned with his boot and we all retired early to rest.</p>

<p>December 4.</p>

<p>We started at sunrise and travelled about six miles in the
direction of 17 degrees, and then halted for breakfast at a lake
called Boongarrup. The whole of the country we passed over this
morning was sandy and bad, being thinly clothed with Banksia
trees; but immediately about the lake there was, as usual, good
land. We started immediately after breakfast as the natives told
us we had a long journey to make. Our course now lay in the
direction of 13 degrees. The country we passed over was still of
the same sandy nature; and after travelling about ten miles we
made another lake.</p>

<p>STRANGER TRIBE. NATIVE TOILETTE.</p>

<p>The natives here saw the recent signs of strange blacks and
insisted upon my coming to a halt whilst they painted themselves
and made sundry additions to their toilette. I urged my
remonstrances upon this head, but it was in vain. They said that
we should soon see some very pretty girls; that I might go on if
I liked, but that they would not move until they had completed
their preparations for meeting their fair friends. I therefore
made the best of it and sat myself down whilst they continued
adorning themselves. This being done to their satisfaction, they
came and requested my opinion as to their appearance; and as I
intimated my most unqualified approval they became in high
spirits, and gave a very animated description of the conquests
they expected to make.</p>

<p>This weighty affair having been completed we again moved on,
the natives keeping a careful lookout for the friends they
expected to see. They at length espied one sitting in the rushes
looking for small fish; but no sooner did he see the approaching
party than he took to his heels as hard as he could, and two
others whom we had not before observed followed his example.</p>

<p>MEETING WITH A NEW TRIBE.</p>

<p>Our native comrades now commenced hallooing to the fugitives,
stating that I had come from the white people to bring them a
present of rice and flour. Moreover Jenna shouted out to his
uncle, "Am not I your nephew--why then should you run away?" This
and similar speeches had, at length, the desired effect. First
one of them advanced, trembling from head to foot, and when I
went forward to meet him and shook hands with him it reassured
the others, and they also joined our party, yet still not without
evident signs of fear. An old man now came up who could not be
induced to allow me to approach him, appearing to regard me with
a sort of stupid amazement; neither horses or any other of those
things which powerfully excited the curiosity of the others had
the least charm for him, but his eyes were always fixed on me
with a look of eagerness and anxiety which I was unable to
account for.</p>

<p>We explained to the strange natives that we intended to halt
for the night in this neighbourhood, and asked them to show us a
good spot with plenty of water and grass. At the same time those
I had with me stated to the others that unless the women and
children came in I would give no rice or flour. This declaration
was however wholly unauthorised by my sanction, and arose from
their desire of exhibiting their personal attractions to the
ladies of these parts; but, feeling rather disposed to see a
little savage flirtation, I raised no objection to it.</p>

<p>The oldest of the natives, who appeared to regard me with so
much curiosity, went off for the purpose of collecting the women
whilst we proceeded to our place of halt. After going about three
miles in a due north direction we made a river coming from an
east and by south direction, and here called by the natives
Goonmarrarup; it lies in rather a deep valley, and at this point
consisted of large pools connected by a running stream about 20
yards wide. There was plenty of wildfowl upon these pools and
Ugat soon shot some for us.</p>

<p>SCENERY.</p>

<p>The scenery here was very picturesque: high wooded hills were
upon each side of us, and the valley was open and rather thinly
timbered; but the few trees it contained were of considerable
size and beauty. Beneath one of these we prepared our bivouac,
the strange natives doing their utmost to render themselves
useful. They had never before seen white people, and the
quickness with which they understood our wants and hastened to
gratify them was very satisfactory.</p>

<p>MEETING WITH NATIVE WOMEN.</p>

<p>After we had tethered the horses and made ourselves tolerably
comfortable we heard loud voices from the hills above us: the
effect was fine for they really almost appeared to float in the
air; and as the wild cries of the women, who knew not our exact
position, came by upon the wind, I thought it was well worth a
little trouble to hear these savage sounds under such
circumstances. Our guides shouted in return, and gradually the
approaching cries came nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>CURIOUS SUPERSTITION. CEREMONIES.</p>

<p>I was however wholly unprepared for the scene that was about
to take place. A sort of procession came up, headed by two women
down whose cheeks tears were streaming. The eldest of these came
up to me and, looking for a moment at me, said, "Gwa, gwa, bundo
bal," "Yes, yes, in truth it is him;" and then, throwing her arms
round me, cried bitterly, her head resting on my breast; and,
although I was totally ignorant of what their meaning was, from
mere motives of compassion I offered no resistance to her
caresses, however disagreeable they might be, for she was old,
ugly, and filthily dirty; the other younger one knelt at my feet,
also crying.</p>

<p>At last the old lady, emboldened by my submission,
deliberately kissed me on each cheek, just in the manner a French
woman would have done; she then cried a little more and, at
length relieving me, assured me that I was the ghost of her son
who had some time before been killed by a spear-wound in his
breast. The younger female was my sister; but she, whether from
motives of delicacy or from any imagined backwardness on my part,
did not think proper to kiss me.</p>

<p>My new mother expressed almost as much delight at my return to
my family as my real mother would have done had I been
unexpectedly restored to her. As soon as she left me my brothers
and father (the old man who had previously been so frightened)
came up and embraced me after their manner, that is, they threw
their arms round my waist, placed their right knee against my
right knee, and their breast against my breast, holding me in
this way for several minutes. During the time that the ceremony
lasted I, according to the native custom, preserved a grave and
mournful expression of countenance.</p>

<p>This belief, that white people are the souls of departed
blacks, is by no means an uncommon superstition amongst them;
they themselves, never having an idea of quitting their own land,
cannot imagine others doing it; and thus, when they see white
people suddenly appear in their country, and settling themselves
down in particular spots, they imagine that they must have formed
an attachment for this land in some other state of existence; and
hence conclude the settlers were at one period black men, and
their own relations. Likenesses either real or imagined complete
the delusion; and from the manner of the old woman I have just
alluded to, from her many tears, and from her warm caresses, I
feel firmly convinced that she really believed I was her son,
whose first thought upon his return to earth had been to re-visit
his old mother, and bring her a present. I will go still farther
and say that, although I did not encourage this illusion, I had
not the heart to try to undeceive the old creature and to dispel
her dream of happiness. Could I have remained long enough to have
replaced this vain impression by a consoling faith I would gladly
have done it; but I did not like to destroy this belief and leave
her no other in the place of it.</p>

<p>The men next proceeded to embrace their relation Jenna in the
same manner they had before done me; and this part of the
ceremony was now concluded.</p>

<p>The women, who had retired after having welcomed me, again
came in from behind some bushes, where the children all yet
remained and, bringing several of them up to me, insisted on my
hugging them. The little things screamed and kicked most lustily,
being evidently frightened out of their wits; but the men seized
on and dragged them up. I took the youngest ones in my arms, and
by caresses soon calmed their fears; so that those who were
brought afterwards cried to reach me first, instead of crying to
be taken away.</p>

<p>A POINT OF HONOUR.</p>

<p>A considerable time had been occupied by these various
occurrences, which to me had been most interesting; but one of a
more painful character was now to follow. It appears that a
sister of the native Jenna had been speared and killed by a man
who at present was resident with this tribe; and, although most
of them were on friendly terms with this native, they conceived
that Jenna was bound to revenge her death in fair and open fight.
The old lady (my mother) went up to him and, seizing his merro,
or throwing-stick, told him that the man who had killed his
sister was at a little distance; "and if," said she, "you are not
a man, and know not how to use this, let a woman's hand try what
it can do," at the same time trying to force it from him. All the
time that she was thus pretending to wrench his merro away she
indulged in a most eloquent speech to endeavour to rouse his
courage. I do not know enough of the language to translate it
with proper spirit or effect, as I only caught the general
meaning: it had however a great effect on Jenna; and some young
ladies coming in at the conclusion, his mind was instantly made
up; indeed the certainty that bright eyes were to look upon his
deeds appeared to have much the same effect upon him that it had
upon the knights of old and, jumping up, he selected three good
spears (all the men being willing to lend him theirs) and hurried
off to an open space where his antagonist was waiting for
him.</p>

<p>NATIVE MODE OF COMBAT.</p>

<p>The combats, one of which was now about to take place, much
resemble the ancient tournaments. They are conducted with perfect
fairness. The combatants fight in an open space, their friends
all standing by to see fair play, and all the preliminaries as to
what blows are to be considered foul or fair are arranged
beforehand, sometimes with much ceremony.</p>

<p>Taking into account the fantastic ornaments and paintings of
the natives, the graceful attitudes they throw themselves into
either when trying to avoid the spears of their enemy, or about
to throw their own; and the loud cries and wild motions with
which they attempt to confuse and terrify their adversaries, I
must confess that if any exhibition of this nature can be
considered showy or attractive, this has no ordinary claims to
admiration.</p>

<p>NATIVE DUEL. REVENGEFUL COMBAT AND MURDER PREVENTED.</p>

<p>I am however not fond of shows in which the safety of my
fellow-creatures is concerned, and on the present occasion was
very anxious that nothing of the kind should take place; for
before I could induce Jenna to come with me, I had passed my word
for his safety, and I could not bear the thought of his being now
either killed or wounded. When therefore the natives came to
request our attendance at this spectacle, which they evidently
expected would afford us great amusement, I intimated my decided
disapproval of it: at first they imagined that this reluctance
arose from some apprehension of a quarrel upon our parts, and to
remove this the greater part of the men, who now amounted to
sixteen, laid down their spears by our stores. I still however
would not sanction the combat and, taking up my gun, intimated my
intention of seeing that nothing was done to injure Jenna; upon
this my brothers proceeded in a friendly way to hold me: which is
exactly what one sees in England when two men, who have not the
least intention in the world of hurting one another, declare in a
loud tone their fixed determination of proceeding to the most
desperate extremities; whilst mutual friends stand by and appear
with the utmost difficulty to prevent them from putting their
threats in execution. It was just in this manner that my
soi-disant brothers held me, apparently not entertaining the
least doubt but that I would easily allow myself to be persuaded
not to interfere. I had now recourse to another expedient, and
this was to declare to those about me that, if either of the
combatants was wounded, I should instantly pack up the flour and
rice and proceed to the white men's fires. This had the desired
effect: those around me started off and put the holding system so
effectually in force that the other natives and the two
combatants soon came in.</p>

<p>Some of the natives who now approached told Mr. Smith that a
cannon had been heard that morning in the direction of Fremantle;
we therefore knew that a vessel had arrived, and this made me
anxious to return to Perth; for, in the event of our obtaining
canvas for the Champion's sails, I expected that vessel would be
ready to take us in a few days to the north-west coast.</p>

<p>RETURN TO PERTH.</p>

<p>My anxiety to return was also increased by other reasons. Mr.
Smith had, with the exception of the first few miles, walked the
whole distance from Perth in pieces of kangaroo skin, and his
feet were now in a dreadful state from the joint effect of thorns
and bruises; he however never complained, and so much did I
admire the quietness and perseverance with which he had borne up
against so serious an inconvenience, that I was the more anxious
to put an end to it as soon as possible. Besides it was evident
that very deadly feelings existed between Jenna and the murderer
of his sister, for he (Jenna) came and requested me to call this
native my friend, at the same time to give him plenty of flour
and rice, "And," added he, "by-and-bye, ask him to sleep at your
fire; then, in the night, whilst he is asleep, I can easily spear
him; and I will off, and walk to Perth." I however cooled Jenna's
ardour by whispering to him that, if any quarrel was brought
about by his attempting to spear this native, I should instantly
shoot him; as I had no idea of running a risk of losing all our
lives through his imprudence. This declaration had a very
salutary effect, and my now giving the promised present of rice
and flour entirely put a stop to all further differences.</p>

<p>The natives I had with me employed themselves in teaching the
others, to whom flour was an unknown commodity, the art of making
dampers; whilst Mr. Smith and myself, having arranged to start
for Perth early the next morning, mixed with the groups and
visited their fires; the little children now crawled to our feet
and, all fear being laid aside, regarded our movements with the
greatest curiosity. After various amusing conversations and
recountals of former deeds the natives gradually, one by one,
dropped off to sleep; and we in turn, one always remaining on the
watch, followed their example.</p>

<p>INVITATION TO A NATIVE FEAST.</p>

<p>December 5.</p>

<p>I should have stated, in justice to the natives, that they
last night brought me the head and forequarters of a kangaroo,
being the only game they had with them; and of this they offered
to make me a present, which however I did not accept. They were
again this morning very anxious that we should delay our journey
for a day or two, promising upon their part, if we acceded to the
request, to give us a grand entertainment at which all their
young men would dance, and that we should have abundance of
kangaroos if we would give flour in return. I deemed it however
most prudent to hasten my return to Perth to see what vessel had
arrived; therefore, after taking a cordial farewell of our
friends, we moved off on our homeward route and reached
Boongarrup about the middle of the day following, by a route
rather to the westward of that by which we had come out.</p>

<p>December 6.</p>

<p>This morning we started at daybreak and breakfasted at
Manbeebee, and immediately after breakfast resumed our route. I
left the main party with two natives and travelled up a swampy
valley running nearly in the same line as the chain of lakes we
had followed in going. The natives insisted on it that these
lakes were all one and the same water; and when, to prove to the
contrary, I pointed to a hill running across the valley, they
took me to a spot in it, called Yundelup, where there was a
limestone cave, on entering which I saw, about ten feet below the
level of the bottom of the valley, a stream of water running
strong from south to north in a channel worn through the
limestone. There were several other remarkable caves about here,
one of which was called the Doorda Mya, or the Dog's House.
Probably therefore the drainage of this part of the country is
affected by the chain of lakes, which must afterwards fall into
the river I saw to the northward. We slept at Nowoorgoop.</p>

<p>RETURN TO PERTH.</p>

<p>December 7.</p>

<p>We slept at Mooloore, and on the morning of the 8th we entered
Perth and found that the native's information was true, for the
Britomart had arrived from England.</p>

<p>I have already stated that on the arrival of the Champion her
condition did not enable us to proceed in her, and all prospect
of being able to conduct another expedition to the north-west
coast being, for the present, abandoned, I could only await
further instructions from the Government at home, and in the
meantime resolved to employ the interval in some scheme of
exploration from the Swan which did not present the same
obstacles. Having again consulted Sir James Stirling, it was
first arranged that I should endeavour to explore overland in the
direction of Shark Bay; but this was soon abandoned on account of
the difficulty of procuring horses; and, to enable me to attempt
this scheme with any hope of success, I should consequently be
obliged to incur a much greater expense than I felt warranted in
doing.</p>

<p>The same objection did not however exist to the plan of
exploring the coast towards Shark Bay in boats; and I imagined,
if I could obtain two good ones qualified for the purpose, that I
might at a small expense have some chance of making a successful
trip. But there still existed a difficulty in getting boats which
occasioned a further delay.</p>

<p>Sir James Stirling had now (January 1839) quitted the colony,
having been succeeded in the government by John Hutt, Esquire,
and, as no immediate prospect was apparent of accomplishing my
present design, I readily acceded to a request made to me which
led to another excursion to the southward of Perth, the principal
circumstances of which are narrated in the following short
journal.</p>

<p>EXCURSION IN SEARCH OF MR. ELLIOTT. CAUSE OF IT.</p>

<p>In consequence of a conversation I had with his Excellency the
Governor on the morning of the 8th of January I received, in the
afternoon of that day, a letter from the Colonial Secretary
stating that:</p>

<p>From accounts which had been received from the Williams and
Leschenault, there appeared every reason to believe that Mr.
George Elliott, who left the former place for the latter on the
17th December, had lost his way, as no accounts of his arrival
have been received from the Leschenault, the Williams, or any
other place.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances His Excellency the Governor is
anxious that a party in search of him should be despatched from
Perth, and he has instructed me to inform you that, if you could
form such a party from your own establishment, you would be
rendering a service to the local government, etc. etc.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>As I had at this moment no matter of importance to occupy the
party I resolved to follow that course which the calls of
humanity pointed out to me, and within an hour from the receipt
of this letter Mr. Walker, myself, and the two non-commissioned
officers of the Sappers and Miners were ready to proceed. It was
found however impossible to procure the necessary horses for us
before the next day, and our departure was consequently delayed
until the morning of the 9th.</p>

<p>Before entering into the details of this expedition it is
requisite to give a short outline of the circumstances under
which we started. The Williams River, from which Mr. Elliott had
proceeded, is distant about seventy miles from Leschenault in a
direct line. The Williams is in the interior, and the Leschenault
on the sea-coast, and between the two places lies the Darling
Range, a high chain of mountains which had never before been
crossed at this point. Now, under ordinary circumstances Mr.
Elliott might have been expected to have reached Leschenault in
three or four days. He had therefore only carried with him a
supply of provisions calculated to last for that period. His
party consisted of two men besides himself, and he had with him a
mare and filly.</p>

<p>His absence had however now unaccountably extended to a period
of twenty days; and the only rational conclusion that could be
arrived at was that he had either been murdered by the natives or
had lost his way.</p>

<p>The Williams is distant from Perth in a direct line about one
hundred and twenty miles, and I had thus a considerable journey
to perform before I could get upon Mr. Elliott's tracks; and as
this was the bad season of the year there was but little hope
that we should be able to follow them for any great distance, if
we ever succeeded in finding them.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these various discouraging circumstances I
still however felt warm hopes for his ultimate safety. He was
well acquainted with the bush, having been ten years in the
colony; and the same articles of food which formed the
subsistence of the natives would at least enable him to maintain
life for a considerable period. He had moreover with him two
horses, which past experience had taught me not only to be a
nutritious, but even an agreeable article of food. I imagined
therefore that no immediate danger of starvation need be
apprehended; and in order that I might have the best possible
chance of finding his traces three intelligent natives, Miago,
Denmar, and Ninda, were engaged to accompany me.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 9th however, when the party were all
ready to start, these natives were not forthcoming. The length of
the journey and the danger of falling in with hostile tribes had
frightened them, and they therefore kept themselves aloof from
us; but Kaiber, one of the most intelligent natives of these
parts, volunteered to supply their place. Our three horses were
soon swum across the estuary of the Swan; and with no slight
anxiety I started on an expedition upon the proper conduct of
which would probably depend the lives of three of my
fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>ROUTE TO THE MURRAY.</p>

<p>Our proceedings until we had reached Pinjarra on the banks of
the Murray offer little or no interesting matter; I shall
therefore pass them over in silence. We arrived in Pinjarra on
the morning of the 11th, having been somewhat delayed by the
weakness of a young horse; as there was however no possibility of
obtaining another in its place I was obliged to take it on with
us. On the afternoon of the 11th we made little more than four
miles in a southerly direction along the banks of the Murray.</p>

<p>THE MURRAY RIVER.</p>

<p>On the 12th we started before dawn and travelled about eight
miles in a south by east direction; we then halted for breakfast
on the banks of the same river, which here issues out of the
Darling Range after having found a passage through that chain of
mountains. Whilst breakfast was preparing I walked up into the
mouth of the gorge, which was replete with most wild and
beautiful scenery at this point. The river comes streaming out
from a rocky mountain pass, forming in its course a series of
small cataracts. The vale in which it runs offers an interesting
specimen of woodland scenery, and the high, bold, and partially
bare granite mountains which rear their heads above it differ
much in character from the tame mountain scenery that lies
between Perth and York: this place is a favourite resort of the
wild cattle, and we saw everywhere numerous recent traces of
them.</p>

<p>WILD CATTLE.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we again started in a south by east
direction. About a mile after leaving the Murray we came suddenly
upon four head of wild cattle; two, which were distant from us,
made off to the mountains, but a noble white bull and a cow
followed a line lying exactly in the course we were pursuing. As
we had one saddle-horse, which I was then on, I could not resist
having a gallop after them. I soon brought the bull to bay, but
when he had taken breath he turned and made off again and, as I
had no time to spare, I gave him no further interruption; on
however wishing to ascertain the hour I found that my watch had
fallen from my pocket during the course of the gallop.</p>

<p>NATIVE TRACKING.</p>

<p>I now waited until the party came up, when I requested Kaiber
the native to walk back and find the watch. This he assured me
was utterly impossible, and I really at the time agreed in this
opinion; however as it was a watch I much valued I determined to
make one effort. "Well, Kaiber," I said to him, "your people had
told me you could see tracks well, but I find they are mistaken;
you have but one eye, something is the matter with the other
(this was really the case) no young woman will take you, for if
you cannot follow my tracks and find a watch I have just dropped
how can you kill game for her." This speech had the desired
effect, and the promise of a shilling heightened his diligence,
and I returned with him. The ground we had passed over was badly
suited for the purpose of tracking and the scrub was thick;
nevertheless, to my delight and surprise, within the period of
half an hour my watch was restored to my pocket. This feat of
Kaiber's surpassed anything of the sort I had previously seen
performed by the natives.</p>

<p>We completed about eight miles and then halted for the night
on the banks of a running stream issuing from a gorge in the
hills. There was a considerable portion of good land in its
neighbourhood and the horses appeared not a little pleased with
the excellence of the feed.</p>

<p>The 13th we spent in passing a portion of the Darling Range.
After travelling for eleven miles over a hilly country we came
upon a beautiful valley between two steep and high hills. Two
streams poured down into this valley and there formed a small
freshwater lake. The scenery here was so green and verdant, the
tranquil little lake was so covered with broad-leaved
waterlilies, and the whole wore such an air of highland mountain
scenery that I could readily have imagined I was once more in
Scotland. About this lake there was also much good feed.</p>

<p>CROSS THE DARLING RANGE.</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon we travelled eight miles
further in an easterly direction, and were then obliged to halt
without water, which we did not again succeed in finding after we
left the lake.</p>

<p>TO THE HOTHAM RIVER.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 14th we had only travelled six miles in
a due easterly direction when I found we had crossed the Darling
Range; our course now lay along a level fertile plain, well
fitted for pastoral purposes. We travelled across this a distance
of about five miles when we came upon the river Bannister, which
here was nothing but a series of large pools with good feed for
cattle about them. We halted for breakfast and afterwards
continued in an easterly direction, when, after travelling for
another six miles, we reached the Hotham. The land we passed over
between the Bannister and Hotham was equal in goodness to any I
have seen in Western Australia.</p>

<p>The circumstance of both water and feed abounding at the
Hotham induced me to halt here for the night, and on the morning
of the 15th we commenced our toilsome march from the Hotham to
the Williams; the distance is about twenty-eight miles in a
direct line; the country consisting of rocky hills, difficult to
cross; and throughout the whole of this distance we could find no
water: we were thus for eleven hours exposed to the sun in one of
the hottest days I have ever felt, and we were not a little glad
when just at sunset we found ourselves on the banks of the
Williams.</p>

<p>CONDITION OF DISTANT SETTLERS.</p>

<p>We here found the establishment of an out-settler, of which it
would be difficult to convey an adequate idea: the house
consisted of a few upright poles, one end of each resting on the
ground, whilst the other met a transverse pole, to which they
were tied; cross-poles then ran along these, and to complete the
building a sort of rude thatch was tied on it. It was open at
both ends and exposed to the land wind, which, as the situation
was high, I found a very unpleasant visitor during the night.
Here we found a very large flock of sheep in fair condition, also
a well-supplied stockyard, and cattle in beautiful order; upwards
of twenty kangaroo dogs completed the establishment.</p>

<p>These settlers were, at the time I visited the Williams, four
in number; consisting of one young man, two youths, and a little
boy. Four soldiers were quartered about sixteen miles from them,
and there was no other European within fifty miles of the spot.
The distance they had to send for all stores and necessaries was
one hundred and twenty miles, and this through a country
untraversed by roads and where they were exposed to the hostility
of the natives in the event of any ill-feeling arising on their
part.</p>

<p>Nothing can give a more lively notion of the difficulties and
privations undergone by first settlers than the fact that, when I
left this hut, they had no flour, tea, sugar, meat, or any
provision whatever except their livestock and the milk of the
cattle, their sole dependence for any other article of food being
the kangaroo dogs, and the only thing I was able to do in order
to better their situation was to leave them some shot.</p>

<p>All other circumstances connected with their position were on
the same scale. They had but one knife, an old clasp one; there
was but one small bed for one person, the others sleeping on the
ground every night, with little or no covering; they had no soap
to wash themselves or their clothes, yet they submitted
cheerfully to all these privations, considering them as necessary
attendants upon their situation. Two of these out-settlers were
gentlemen, not only by birth but also in thought and manner, and,
to tell the truth, I believe they were far happier than many an
idle young man I have seen lounging about in England, a burden to
himself and his friends; for it must be borne in mind that they
were realizing a future independence for themselves.</p>

<p>THEIR PRIVATIONS.</p>

<p>Many of the ills and privations which they endured were
however unnecessary, and were entailed upon them by the mistaken
system that has been pursued at Swan River of spreading to the
utmost their limited population. I trust however that a wiser
line of policy will now be pursued, and that settling will
consequently become an easier, less dangerous, and far more
agreeable task.</p>

<p>ROUTE ALONG MR. ELLIOTT'S TRACKS. TRACKING MR. ELLIOTT.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 16th Mr. Walker went to the Upper
Williams, where the soldiers were quartered, for a further supply
of provisions, whilst the native and myself tried to make off Mr.
Elliott's tracks, in doing which we were not however successful.
The next morning, previously to Mr. Walker's return, I renewed my
search with Kaiber for the tracks with a little more success, as
amidst the numerous traces of cattle and horses along the bed of
the river the native was able by his acute eye to discover the
footsteps of a colt. When Mr. Walker returned the little boy
belonging to the establishment came back with him. He had seen
Mr. Elliott start and assured me that he had heard him express
his determination of keeping the bed of the river for eighteen
miles. With this piece of information we moved on down the river
on the tracks which we were able to distinguish for about two
miles and a half, when they quitted it in a south-south-west
direction; and from the hard nature of the ground the tracking
from thence became excessively difficult. If the colt had
traversed this route, its little foot had made no impression on
the soil; and when we got on the ironstone hills, we altogether
lost the traces of the horse. Both the native and myself
imagined, from our seeing no tracks of the colt, from the
indistinctness of those of the horse, and from the circumstance
of the boy's telling us that Mr. Elliott intended to proceed
eighteen miles down the river, that we had followed the wrong
marks; just therefore as night began to fall I moved back to the
river.</p>

<p>January 18.</p>

<p>We started at dawn, following down the river, but could see
nothing of Mr. Elliott's tracks: and our evening journey was
equally unsuccessful. I now became very anxious and indeed rather
alarmed for the safety of the missing party, but resolved, as the
best plan I could pursue, to strike across the mountains to
Leschenault, making a due west course my true line of route, but
constantly diverging two or three miles to the south of this, and
again returning to it by another route. I should thus have every
chance of falling in with the track I wished to find; and in the
event of my not succeeding I should be certain, if on my arrival
at Leschenault no tidings had been received of Mr. Elliott, that
his party must be somewhere to the southward and eastward of the
course I had taken, and that I might still, by the assistance of
the Leschenault natives to whom this country was known, succeed
in finding him before such a period had elapsed as would render
assistance useless.</p>

<p>KILLING A KANGAROO.</p>

<p>On the 19th, in pursuance of this determination, we made a
rapid push of nearly twenty miles in a westerly direction without
reckoning our divergencies to the southward. Nothing however but
toil and disappointment rewarded our exertions. We killed a large
Boomer, or old male kangaroo, the largest indeed I had ever seen;
the dogs were unable to master him he fought so desperately, and
it was not until after he had wounded two of them that I
succeeded in dispatching it by a sort of personal encounter in
which a club was the weapon I used. The native who was carrying
my gun had dropped it the instant the kangaroo was started, and I
was thus unable to shoot it. We cut off as much of the flesh as
the dogs and ourselves required for two days and left the rest in
the forest. We halted for the night on a small stream, the only
one I had seen since we quitted the Williams.</p>

<p>COUNTRY UPON THE HARVEY RIVER.</p>

<p>Our departure was delayed on the morning of the 20th for about
an hour from being unable to find one of the horses which had
strayed away in the night, but, the fugitive being at length
discovered and brought back, we started and made nine miles
before breakfast. We then travelled nine and a half miles more,
when we came upon the river Harvey near its source. The character
of the country we had travelled over since entering the mountains
was monotonous in the extreme. It consisted of an elevated
tableland composed of ironstone and granite occasionally
traversed by veins of whinstone. On this tableland there was
little or no herbage; the lower vegetation consisting principally
of a short prickly scrub, in some places completely destroyed by
the native fires; but the whole country was thickly clothed with
mahogany trees, so that in many parts it might be called a dense
forest. These mahogany trees ascended, without a bend or without
throwing off a branch, to the height of from forty to fifty feet,
occasionally much more, and the ground was so encumbered by the
fallen trunks of these forest trees that it was sometimes
difficult to pick a passage between them. Even at midday the
forest wore a sombre aspect, and a stillness and solitude reigned
throughout it that was very striking. Occasionally a timid
kangaroo might be seen stealing off in the distance, or a
kangaroo-rat might dart out from a tuft beneath your feet; but
these were rare circumstances. The most usual disturber of these
wooded solitudes were the black cockatoos; but I have never in
any part of the world seen so great a want of animal life as in
these mountains.</p>

<p>Upon our gaining the Harvey however the scene somewhat
changed; the river here bore the appearance of a mountain
trout-stream, sometimes gurgling along with a rapid current, and
sometimes forming large pools. The tableland could no longer be
distinguished as it here changed to a broken chain of hills
traversed by deep valleys; the scrub was higher and entwined by a
variety of climbing plants, which rendered it very difficult to
traverse; the mahogany trees became less frequent, and various
others were mingled with them, whilst on the banks of the river
good forage abounded. We made about five miles more through a
country of this description and then halted for the night.</p>

<p>LOSE THE TRACKS. NATIVE GRAVE.</p>

<p>January 21.</p>

<p>We did not make more than seven miles before breakfast this
morning, being embarrassed both by high and tangled underwood and
rocky hills. We then halted on the banks of the Harvey, where
there was some beautiful grass. We had still been able to find
nothing of Mr. Elliott's tracks, and had in vain looked for
natives: but this evening, soon after starting again, for the
first time signs of them appeared, for we found a newly-made
grave, carefully constructed, with a hut built over it to protect
the now senseless slumberer beneath from the rains of winter. All
that friendship could do to render his future state happy had
been done. His throwing stick was stuck in the ground at his
head; his broken spears rested against the entrance of the hut,
the grave was thickly strewed with wilgey or red earth; and three
trees in front of the hut, chopped with a variety of notches and
uncouth figures and then daubed over with wilgey, bore testimony
that his death had been bloodily avenged.</p>

<p>KAIBER'S FEARS.</p>

<p>The native Kaiber gazed with a degree of concern and
uneasiness on this scene. "A man has been slain here," he said.
"And what, Kaiber," I asked him, "is the reason that these spears
are broken, that the trees are notched, and that wilgey is
strewed on the grave?" His answer was, "Neither you nor I know:
our people have always done so, and we do so now." I then said to
him, "Kaiber, I intend to stop here for the night, and sleep."
"You are deceiving me," he said: "I cannot rest here, for there
are many spirits in this place." I laughed at his fears, and we
again moved on.</p>

<p>WANT OF WATER.</p>

<p>We now soon got clear of the hills and came out upon a plain
of good land, thickly covered with grass-trees. This plain was
about three miles in width and, having traversed it, we found
ourselves in a sandy country abounding with Banksia trees. We
crossed several swamps, now completely dried up, and having made
ten miles halted for the night without water. Mr. Walker scraped
a hole in one of these swamps and obtained a little putrid and
muddy water which, not being very thirsty, I did not drink, more
especially as we had now, or indeed for several days, had no tea
or anything else to mix with it.</p>

<p>January 22.</p>

<p>We started again at dawn this morning and travelled rapidly,
for we were anxious to obtain water. In six miles we came out
upon the sea. If my reckoning was right we ought now to have been
about ten miles to the north of Leschenault; I therefore turned
due south. Kaiber however now came up and remonstrated against
this, assuring me that I was wrong and that we were, at this
moment, two or three miles to the south of Leschenault, and that
if I persisted in going on in this direction we should all die
for want of water. As I put great faith in his knowledge of the
country I halted and ascended a hill to try and get a view along
the coast; I could not however succeed on account of the haze;
and believing then that I must be in error I turned north. We
trudged on, hour after hour; the sun got higher and more
intensely hot, whilst, having been four-and-twenty hours without
water, the greater part of which time had been spent in violent
exercise under a burning sun, the pangs of thirst became very
annoying. A short period more convinced me that I was right, and
that Kaiber was in error; and, as we soon after fell in with two
native wells now dried up, we dug another in a promising-looking
spot near them, and obtained a little water, very muddy and
stinking; but I never enjoyed a draught more in my life. We here
halted for breakfast and by degrees obtained water enough for the
horses as well as ourselves.</p>

<p>ESTUARY OF THE LESCHENAULT.</p>

<p>The evening was consumed in retracing our steps of the
morning, and at night we halted near the head of the Leschenault
estuary, being again without water.</p>

<p>January 23.</p>

<p>Our route this morning was along the estuary of the
Leschenault. About five miles from this place we fell in with a
party of natives, who informed us that a few days before Mr.
Elliott and those with him had arrived there in perfect safety,
and my anxiety on this point was therefore set at rest. We passed
the mouth of the river Collie at the bar, which was almost dry,
and halted for breakfast on the banks of the Preston, about one
mile from the house where I expected to find Mr. Elliott.</p>

<p>MEET WITH MR. ELLIOTT. MR. ELLIOTT'S ADVENTURES.</p>

<p>No sooner was breakfast despatched than I set off to see Mr.
Elliott in order to hear the history of his adventures, which
were not a little surprising. He had, as I before related,
started on the 17th of December from the Williams, with only
three days' provisions and, owing to some mistake, had taken a
south-south-west course and gone off in the direction where we
first saw his tracks, and had pursued this route for three days,
when, seeing nothing of the coast, he suspected he must be wrong,
and endeavoured to make a due west course; but from the
impassable nature of the mountain range at this point was unable
to do so. About this period also, owing to his powder-horn having
been placed too near the fire, it was accidentally blown away,
and he was thus left totally without protection in the event of
any attack being made on them by the natives. His own courage and
resolution however never failed, and he still made the best of
his way to the southward, seizing every opportunity of making
westing. For twelve days he pursued this course, subsisting on
native roots and boiled tops of grass trees. About the sixth day
he fell in with some natives; but they ran away, being frightened
at the appearance of white men, and he thus could obtain no
assistance from them. At this period the filly strayed away from
the mare and was lost. His men behaved admirably; and on the
fourteenth day the party succeeded in reaching Augusta, having
previously made the coast at the remarkable white-sand patch
about fifty miles to the eastward of it.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the hardships and sufferings they had
undergone this party were but very little reduced in strength
and, after recruiting for a few days at Augusta, returned along
the coast to Leschenault, where I had the pleasure of seeing them
all in good health and spirits.</p>

<p>THE VASSE DISTRICT.</p>

<p>January 21.</p>

<p>Whilst the party reposed themselves this day at Leschenault I
hired a horse and rode along the shores of Geographe Bay for the
purpose of seeing the Vasse district. The country between
Leschenault and the Vasse differs from those other parts of
Western Australia that I have yet seen in the circumstance that
in several parts, between the sea and the recent limestone
formation, basaltic rocks are developed. A long chain of marshy
lakes lie between the usual coast sandhills and the ordinary sand
formations, about which there is some good land and good feed.
About the river Capel also there is a great deal of good land.
The mouths of two estuaries that occur between the inlet of
Leschenault and the bottom of Geographe Bay are both fordable.
The district near the bottom of Geographe Bay contains much good
land, consisting of level plains thickly covered with wattle
trees; there are also at this season of the year extensive plains
of dry sand, which bear exactly the appearance of a desert.</p>

<p>I passed the night at the house of Mr. Bussel, a settler who
has the best and most comfortable establishment I have seen in
the colony, and returned the next day to Leschenault with the
intention of starting the following one for Perth.</p>

<p>RETURN TO PERTH. RIVER ABSORBED IN SANDY PLAINS.</p>

<p>January 26.</p>

<p>Mr. Elliott this day joined us on our route to Perth, which
was attended with no circumstance worthy of notice until our
arrival at Pinjarra. We travelled over extensive plains which in
the rainy season of the year must be completely flooded, but in
vain looked for the Harvey River and the other stream which
flowed from the hills to the sea. I could find no watercourse in
which they might probably flow, yet we had left them both running
strongly at not more than ten miles from the point where we then
stood. The truth was that they were absorbed in these marshy
plains before they came within several miles of the sea; and what
threw a still further light upon the subject was that, although
these marshes were perfectly dried up and had a hard-baked
appearance at the surface, yet if a hole about two or three feet
deep was scraped in them water directly came pouring into it.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 29th we reached Pinjarra; on the 30th
Mr. Elliott and myself rode as far as the Canning; and early on
the 31st we had the pleasure of entering Perth together. [20. Map

<h2>CHAPTER 14. FROM SWAN RIVER TO THE SHORES OF SHARK BAY.</h2>

<p>PLAN OF EXPEDITION.</p>

<p>At length, in the middle of February, after a mortifying delay
of nearly five months, an opportunity occurred which held out
every prospect of enabling me to complete the examination of the
most interesting portion of the north coast, together with the
country lying behind it.</p>

<p>Three whale-boats having been procured, an engagement was made
with Captain Long of the American whaler Russel, of New Bedford,
to convey my party and the boats to some point to the northward
of Shark Bay, and there land us, together with a supply of
provisions sufficient for five months. My intention was to form a
provision depot in some island, and from that point to commence
operations by the examination of the undiscovered portions of the
bay; and, should circumstances occasionally render it desirable,
I proposed to explore more minutely parts of the country as we
coasted along, or to make excursions to such a distance inland as
we might be able to penetrate.</p>

<p>Having completed the examination of the bay as far as we could
with the provisions we carried from the depot, I intended to
return to it and, after recruiting our stock, to make my way
along the coast in the direction of North-West Cape; making
excursions inland as before at such points as might seem to merit
attention, and thus to continue to go northward until our
provisions were so far exhausted as to compel us to return again
to the depot; whence I finally proposed to continue my
examination to the portion of the coast left unvisited to the
southward of the depot, as far as Gantheaume Bay.</p>

<p>Several of the individuals who were to compose my party being
now much experienced in the difficulties that attend explorations
both on the coast and in the interior of the country, I felt that
our enterprise was not so hazardous as at first it might appear
to be, especially as Mr. Hutt had arranged with me as to a spot,
to which, in the event of our not returning to Swan River within
a certain period the Colonial schooner would be sent to look for
us; and moreover the captain of another American whaler had
promised to visit North-West Cape at the end of July, as it was
his intention to remain in Exmouth Gulf during the season of the
bay fishing. We had thus two chances of being discovered in case
of any accident preventing us from effecting our previous return
to the Swan River.</p>

<p>The unfortunate occurrence which frustrated my expectations of
completing this design, and which threatened the eventual
destruction of the whole party, will be narrated in its
place.</p>

<p>FROM SWAN RIVER FOR SHARK BAY.</p>

<p>I had taken three whale-boats in order to have a spare one
should any accident reduce the number; and everything being
arranged I sailed in the Russel from Fremantle on Sunday February
the 17th 1839 at 3 P.M. with the following party:</p>

<p>Mr. Walker, the Surgeon of the former expedition.</p>

<p>Mr. Frederick Smith, the young gentleman who had accompanied
me on a former tour.</p>

<p>Corporal Auger and Corporal Coles, Sappers and Miners.</p>

<p>Thomas Ruston, Sailor.</p>

<p>The last three, together with Mr. Walker, had been with me on
the first expedition, and to these were added:</p>

<p>H. Wood and C. Wood, Seamen.</p>

<p>Clotworthy, Stiles, and Hackney, taken as volunteers at Swan
River.</p>

<p>And lastly, Kaiber, an intelligent native of the Swan.</p>

<p>Making in all twelve persons.</p>

<p>Our time during the voyage was occupied principally in getting
the three whale-boats in order and making other similar
preparations. Poor Kaiber the native was dreadfully sick from the
first.</p>

<p>Sunday February 24 1839.</p>

<p>This evening we Sighted the centre of Dorre Island, and stood
in to within about two miles of the shore, which we found steep
and rocky with a heavy surf breaking on it; we then tacked and
stood off for the night.</p>

<p>LAND AT BERNIER ISLAND.</p>

<p>February 25.</p>

<p>Soon after daybreak we made the north-western part of Bernier
Island and, doubling the point at Kok's Island, stood in to Shark
Bay. Kok's Island is very remarkable: it is nearly a tableland,
about a quarter of a mile in length, terminating in low cliffs at
each extremity; and on the summit of this tableland are several
large rocks which look like the remains of pillars. The land is
low. By noon we were all disembarked on Bernier Island. The point
I had selected for landing on was a sandy beach in a little bay,
the southern extremity of which was sheltered from the south-east
by a reef running off the point. Captain Long of the Russel made
the shore rather to the northward of the point I had chosen and,
owing to his boat getting broadside on whilst they were landing
the goods, he was knocked down under it and nearly drowned.</p>

<p>He had scarcely left us (though the Russel was then more than
six miles off) when we found that our keg of tobacco had been
left on board; the vessel was soon out of sight, and this
article, so necessary in hardships where men are deprived of
every other luxury, was lost to us. Everything else was however
found correct. Whilst the men under Mr. Walker's direction were
arranging the stores Mr. Smith, Kaiber, and myself started to
search for water but were unsuccessful. Whilst on our return we
saw three large turtles among some seaweeds in shoal water; and,
after a good deal of floundering about and some tumbles amongst
the breakers, we succeeded in turning them, and then brought a
party armed with axes, etc. and cut them up. One part we
immediately converted into soup, and the remainder was immersed
in a cask of pickle as a store against unforeseen misfortunes.
When these portions of the turtle were put into the brine long
after the death of the animals, they quivered for several
minutes, as if still endowed with the sense of feeling.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION OF IT.</p>

<p>Bernier Island consists of recent limestone of a reddish
tinge, containing many recent fossil shells, and having a coating
of sand and sandy dunes which are arranged in right lines, lying
south-east and north-west, the direction of the prevailing winds.
The island does not afford a tree or a blade of grass, but only
wretched scrubby bushes. Between the dunes regular beds of shells
are forming which, when dried and light, are drifted up by the
wind. The only animals we saw were kangaroo-rats, one pigeon, one
small land- and many seabirds, a few lizards, mosquitoes, ants,
crabs, oysters and turtle.</p>

<p>BURY THE STORES. INEFFECTUAL SEARCH FOR WATER.</p>

<p>February 26.</p>

<p>Early this morning we had finished burying our stores. The
wind had freshened considerably about daylight, and throughout
the day it blew nearly a gale from the south-east; it now looked
so foul that I feared a long period of bad weather was about to
commence. My own party, as well as the crews of the boats which
came off from the whaler, had during the hurry and confusion
incident on landing made very free with our supply of water, and
as, from the appearance of the island, I felt very doubtful
whether we should find any more, I put all hands on an allowance
of two pints and a half a day, and then employed the men thus:
one party under the direction of Mr. Walker worked at
constructing a still, by means of which we might obtain fresh
water from salt; another made various attempts to sink a well;
whilst the native, another man, and myself traversed the island
in search of a supply from the surface.</p>

<p>At night the result of our efforts were recounted, when it
appeared that Mr. Walker had, by an ingenious contrivance,
managed to have such a still constructed that we might hope, by
means of it, if kept constantly working, to obtain just water
enough to keep us alive. The party who had tried to sink a well
had invariably been stopped by hard limestone rock in every place
they had tried, and all their attempts to penetrate it by means
of a cold chisel and pickaxe had proved abortive. The party which
had been out with me searching for water had not seen the
slightest sign which indicated its presence on the island: we had
taken a spade with us, but wherever we dug had come down upon the
solid rock. Under these circumstances I reduced the allowance to
two pints a day.</p>

<p>February 27.</p>

<p>This morning it still blew nearly a gale of wind from the
south-east. The men were occupied in the same manner as
yesterday; but towards noon the wind moderated a little, and as
we could find no water I resolved to make an effort to creep
along shore to the southward.</p>

<p>LOSS OF A BOAT IN REEMBARKING.</p>

<p>My boat was soon launched in safety, but the Paul Pry, Mr.
Walker's boat, was not so fortunate; the water in the bay
deepened rapidly from the steepness of the bank, and the
steersman, who was keeping her bow on whilst the crew were
launching, got frightened from the depth of water and the
violence of the surf, and let go his hold; when the next surf
threw the boat broadside on to the sea and, there being nearly
half a ton weight of stores in her, and the wind at this juncture
unfortunately freshening, she was in the course of two or three
minutes knocked completely to pieces. By this mischance all the
stores in the boat were lost, and nothing but a few planks and
some articles of clothing were recovered. I placed my own boat at
anchor in a little cove for the night and, leaving two men in her
as keepers, the rest of us swam ashore through the surf to render
what assistance we could.</p>

<p>The loss of this boat was a very heavy misfortune to commence
with; but as I had taken the precaution in case of such an
accident to provide a spare one it was by no means irremediable;
the other boat was all ready for launching within half an hour,
for by not allowing the men to remain in a state of inactivity,
and by treating the matter lightly, I hoped to prevent their
being dispirited by this unlucky circumstance.</p>

<p>The wind however continued freshening rapidly, and during the
evening and night we had heavy squalls accompanied by rain from
all quarters, and much thunder and lightning. During the night we
collected a few quarts of water in the sails.</p>

<p>February 28.</p>

<p>About ten A.M. the wind moderated so much that we ventured to
launch our remaining boat, now become the second, and in a few
minutes both were riding alongside one another in the little
cove. We then commenced pulling along the shore of the island,
making about a south by east course. Having the wind very nearly
right ahead, and a heavy head-sea, and about half a ton of stores
in each of the boats, it was no very enviable position that we
were in; but anything appeared preferable to dying of thirst on
Bernier Island; my dislike to which was much increased from the
fact of Mr. Smith and myself, who slept side by side, having been
nearly tormented to death in the night by myriads of minute ants
crawling over us, by mosquitoes stinging us, and by an odious
land-crab every now and then running over us and feeling with his
nippers for a delicate morsel.</p>

<p>PULL FOR DORRE ISLAND.</p>

<p>It was nearly three P.M. when we reached the north-eastern
extremity of Dorre Island and found a most convenient little boat
harbour, sheltered by a reef from all winds. We therefore stepped
out from the boats upon the reef and left them lying comfortably
at anchor: a search for water was instantly commenced; Mr.
Walker's party brought some in and we were not a little glad to
get it, although we heard that it had been collected by suction
from small holes in the rock and then spitting it into the keg. I
laid up in store this precious draught, and those who had been
otherwise employed now accompanied me, in order that each might
suck from the holes in the rock his own supply of water. The
point on which we had landed was a flat piece of land covered
with sandy dunes which appeared to have been recently gained from
the sea, and on all the landward sides of the flat rose steep
rocky cliffs, which is the character of the shores of this
island. After climbing these cliffs you arrive at a flat
tableland which forms the general level of the surface. It was
evident that at no very distant time the sea had washed the foot
of these cliffs.</p>

<p>DORRE ISLAND. ITS CHARACTER.</p>

<p>This island is exactly of the same nature as Bernier Island,
the only difference being that the land here was rather higher
than on the former. From the top of the cliffs the prospect was
not at all inviting; to the westward lay the level and almost
desert land of Dorre Island, which we were on; we had the same
prospect to the southward; to the northward we looked over a
narrow channel which separated us from the barren isle of Bernier
and was blocked up by fearful-looking reefs, on which broke a
nasty surf; to the north-eastward lofty bare sandhills were
indistinctly visible on the main; whilst to the eastward we could
see nothing but the waters of the bay, which were tossed wildly
to and fro as if by a coming storm; yet the wind had fallen
perceptibly, and the only alarming sign was the peculiar look of
the sky. After having made these observations, and sucked up as
much bitter dirty water as I could contrive to do, I returned
with the others to the boats.</p>

<p>WANT OF WATER.</p>

<p>The holes we found the water in were so small that we could
only dip a spoon into a few of them; the men however got plenty
to drink and then commenced hunting a small species of
kangaroo-rat which is found on these islands, and searching for
turtle's eggs, in both of which pursuits they were very
successful. We then made blazing fires from driftwood which we
found about, and retired early to rest.</p>

<p>A HURRICANE.</p>

<p>About eleven o'clock I heard a cry of one in great distress,
"Mr. Grey, Mr. Grey!" I instantly sprung up and answered the
call, when Ruston, the boatkeeper in my boat, said, "I must heave
all overboard, Sir, or the boat will be swamped." "Hold on for a
minute or two," was my answer, whilst I stripped my clothes off.
I found that it was blowing a terrific gale of wind which
increased every moment in a most extraordinary manner; the wind
was from the south-east, and the breakers came pouring over the
reef as if the bay was going to empty bodily all its waters into
the little cove in which the boats were anchored. I now called
Mr. Walker and Mr. Smith and desired them to follow me off to the
boats with two or three hands, and then swam out to my own, which
I found nearly full of water, and it was all that the boat-keeper
could do to keep her head on to the sea. In a minute or two Mr.
Walker and Mr. Smith, who were ever foremost in difficulties and
dangers, swam off to assist me, but they could not induce any of
the men to face the sea and storm, which was now so terrible that
they were all quite bewildered. Mr. Walker swam to his own boat;
Mr. Smith came to mine. We made fast a line to all the stores,
etc. and Mr. Smith boldly plunged in again amongst the breakers
and returned ashore with it, a service of no ordinary danger, for
the shore was fronted with a sharp coral reef, against which he
was certain to be dashed by the waves, and, after having got on
it, the breakers would keep knocking him down and thus cutting
his legs to pieces against the rocks. Mr. Smith however reached
the shore with the line, receiving sundry severe cuts and
bruises; and, to my great surprise, in a few minutes more he was
again by my side in the boat, baling away: it was still however
all we could do to keep the boat afloat.</p>

<p>BOATS DRIVEN ASHORE.</p>

<p>Mr. Walker now called out to me that his boat was drifting,
and in a moment more she went ashore. For one second we saw her
dancing wildly in over the breakers, and then she disappeared
from us, and we were left in uncertainty as to her fate; for,
although we were close to the beach, it was impossible, amidst
the din of elements, to hear what was taking place there. An
occasional vivid flash of lightning showed us dark figures
hauling about some huge object, and then again all was wrapped in
roar and darkness. Mr. Smith and myself in the meanwhile were
baling away, and Ruston was striving with the steer oar to keep
her head to sea, for the instant she got the least broadside on
the waves broke over her and she filled again.</p>

<p>SERIOUS DANGER OF LOSING THE BOATS.</p>

<p>Mr. Walker, nothing daunted by the conduct of the men, having
had his own boat hauled up, again swam off to us, and for the
next hour or two we kept the other one not more than half full;
but the gale, which had been gradually increasing, now became a
perfect hurricane, and it was evident that this boat must also go
ashore. We imagined that Mr. Walker's must be stove in several
places; and, as to have been left without a boat would have been
certain destruction to us, I swam ashore to have the party ready
to try and save mine by hauling her over the reef the instant she
grounded.</p>

<p>I arrived there with a few cuts and bruises, and found the men
on shore in a most miserable state; many of them were perfectly
appalled by the hurricane, never having seen anything of the kind
before, and were lying under the lee of the bow of Mr. Walker's
boat, which, although he had drawn it up high and dry upon the
sandhills, far above the usual high-water mark, was again more
than half full of water and seaweed from the waves every now and
then breaking over her stern. It was with great difficulty I
roused the men and got them to clear out the seaweed, which
lightened her somewhat; we then hauled her up a little at a
favourable opportunity, and advanced her so far that we rather
gained upon the water by baling, and thus, by degrees, got her
quite on land. But as the storm continued the waves still
continued to encroach upon the shore, and we were obliged to
repeat this operation of hauling up three successive times in the
night, which was one of the most fearful I have ever passed. I
lay drenched through, my wet shirt sticking close to me and my
blanket soaked with water, for I could not find my clothes again
after I came ashore. Whenever a flash of lightning broke I looked
if the boat was drifting in, and there I saw it still dancing
about upon the waves, whilst the elements were so mighty in their
power that I felt shrunk up to nothing, and tremulous in my own
insignificance.</p>

<p>The grey dawn stole on and the boat gradually became visible;
she had drifted somewhat nearer shore, but there still were the
three figures discernible in her, Ruston working away at the
steer-oar, and Mr. Smith and Mr. Walker alternately baling. The
storm now appeared to lull a little and in a few minutes (about
half-past five A.M.) it suddenly dropped. The men now looked out
again and I could hear Ruston saying, "I believe we are now safe,
Sir;" and I immediately ordered that two men should go off and
relieve Mr. Smith and Mr. Walker. They evidently feared to make
the attempt and said they could not swim, which was true as far
as some of them were concerned. I then ordered successively three
men who I knew could swim to take advantage of the lull and gain
the boat: they all attempted it, but before they got clear of the
reef their hearts failed them, and they declared they could not
contend with the waves.</p>

<p>RENEWAL OF THE STORM.</p>

<p>Just as the last man had failed, the wind, which had hitherto
been from the south-east, shifted instantaneously to the
north-west. We all quailed or fell before it, for it came with
sudden and indescribable violence; the boat appeared to hesitate
for one moment, in the next she came dancing wildly in on the
shore. The men reached her as well as they could and we dragged
her up. The storm now became so violent that even Mr. Walker, who
was a heavy man, was blown about by it like a child; there was
not a tree on the island, but the bushes were stripped from the
ground, and I found it impossible to keep my legs.</p>

<p>The sea all this time kept rising, being heaped up by the wind
against the shore, but whenever a momentary lull came we took
advantage of it to drag the boat a little further up; indeed the
sea gained on us so much that I had made up my mind it would
sweep away the intervening sandhills and once more wash the face
of the cliffs. In this case we should to a certainty have all
perished.</p>

<p>DISTRESS FOR WATER.</p>

<p>At two P.M. the storm lulled considerably, and I immediately
despatched men in all directions to collect water from holes in
the rocks, and made the native and an old bushman try to light a
fire; for those of us who had been all the night and morning in
the pelting rain, with nothing but our shirts on, were benumbed
and miserable from cold.</p>

<p>March 1.</p>

<p>The men who had gone out for water soon returned and reported
that they had been able to find very little which was not
brackish from the spray having dashed over the island; I
therefore again reduced the allowance to one pint a day and
proceeded to inspect damages. Yesterday we had started in good
boats, with strong men, plenty of provisions, everything in the
best order; today I found myself in a very different position,
all the stores we had with us, with the exception of the salt
provisions, were spoilt; our ammunition damaged; the chronometers
down; and both boats so stoved and strained as to be quite beyond
our powers of repairing them effectually. Moreover from want of
water we were compelled to make for the main before we could
return back to Bernier Island to recruit from our ample stores
there.</p>

<p>REPAIR OF THE BOATS.</p>

<p>Nothing however could be done but to have the boats rendered
as seaworthy as possible and, having given this order, the want
the men experienced for water was the best guarantee that they
would execute this task with the utmost diligence. As soon as I
saw them at their work I started with a party in search of water
whilst another party under Mr. Smith dug for it; and Mr. Walker
superintended the rearrangement of the stores and the digging up
the seaweed for the purpose of recovering lost articles. I
returned just before nightfall from a vain search; Mr. Smith had
been equally unsuccessful in his digging operations, and we thus
had to lie down upon the sand parched with thirst, our only
chance of forgetting our misfortunes being a few minutes
sleep.</p>

<p>THE BOATS NEARLY READY.</p>

<p>March 2.</p>

<p>The men continued working hard at the boats, and it appeared
that their task would be concluded this day. I once more started
to look for water and to examine the island; but our search was
again unsuccessful. On measuring the distance that the sea had
risen I found that it had spread up in the direction of our boats
fifty-three yards above high water mark; but what will give a
better idea of the hurricane is the circumstance of my catching a
cormorant on the beach, about seven o'clock on the morning of the
1st, and during the height of the storm, the bird not even
attempting to fly, being in appearance completely appalled at the
violence of the wind. It was reported to me at night that another
hour's work in the morning would render the boats fit for
sea.</p>

<p>Sunday March 3.</p>

<p>The men had slept but little during the night for they were
oppressed with thirst; and when I rose in the morning I saw
evident symptoms of the coming of another roasting day. They were
busy at the boats as soon as they could see to work, whilst Mr.
Smith and myself ascended the cliffs to get a view towards the
main. When I looked down upon the calm and glassy sea I could
scarcely believe it was the same element which within so short a
period had worked us such serious damage. To the north-east we
could see the lofty white sandhills in Lyell's Range; to the
eastward nothing was visible; yet this was the point to which I
had determined to steer, for several reasons. In the first place,
the land in that direction had never been visited; and secondly,
I had found the shores of Dorre Island covered with great forest
trees, which must have been washed across the bay, and which from
their size could only have been brought out from the continent by
some large and rapid stream, which we at this moment would gladly
have seen as there was only about a pint and half of water per
man left.</p>

<p>SAIL FOR THE MAIN.</p>

<p>When we returned to breakfast I found the boats nearly ready
for sea, and about eleven o'clock they had been all hauled down,
the stores stowed away, and everything made ready for launching,
and off we went, not a little rejoiced at the prospect of soon
having an abundant supply of that liquid on which our lives
depended. There was scarcely any wind but that little was right
aft so that between sailing and pulling we made about five knots
an hour. The boats were however so heavily laden that the men
found it very laborious work, for they were exposed to the rays
of a burning sun and had nothing to drink but half a pint of
water, which was all I could allow them.</p>

<p>We however persevered from soon after eleven A.M. until five
P.M., when the men began to get disheartened from seeing no signs
whatever of land, and I ordered my boat's crew to knock off
pulling for a little, and in Mr. Walker's boat, which was about a
mile astern, they did the same. In twenty minutes time I made my
crew again take to their oars, but the other boat did not in this
instance follow our example, so that we kept dropping her rapidly
astern. This was very annoying; but as I was anxious at all
events to get a glimpse of the land before sundown we still
pulled away, trusting that the other boat would soon follow in
our wake.</p>

<p>GROUND ON A SANDBANK.</p>

<p>About half an hour before sunset we sighted the land: several
low rounded hills were the first things seen; then what I
conceived to be very lofty trees rose in sight, and almost at the
same moment the boat grounded on a sandbank.</p>

<p>EXTENSIVE SHALLOWS.</p>

<p>I had observed this shoal several miles before we came to it
and it appeared to extend as far as I could see both north and
south, but, as I had no doubt that we should find sufficient
water on it to enable us to cross, I had given it no attention. I
now however on looking more carefully could perceive no limit to
its extent in those directions and, as I thought I saw deep water
immediately to the eastward of us, I ordered the men to jump out
and track the boat over. This they did; but on coming to what
appeared to be deep water we found it was only a continuation of
the same sandbank, covered with seaweed, which gave the water a
darker appearance. The men now alternately tracked or pulled the
boat for about five miles over a continuation of the sandbank; a
work very fatiguing to those who were already exhausted by
several days' continuous exertion on a very short allowance of
water in a tropical climate. It had now been for some time night,
and we had taken a star for our guide which just before sunset I
had seen rising over the main. I thought we had at last gained
the shore, at least the boat was close to a dark line rising
above the water which appeared like a wooded bank; two of the men
now waded onwards to find out the best place for landing and to
light a fire that the crew of the other boat might know where we
were. I saw them to my surprise not ascend a wooded bank but
disappear amongst the trees; and still through the silence of the
night I heard the splash of men walking through water, and in a
minute or two afterwards the cries and screams of innumerable
startled waterfowl and curlews, who came flying in flocks from
amongst the mangrove trees.</p>

<p>FAIL IN MAKING THE LAND.</p>

<p>The men returned and reported that there was no land or any
sign of land hereabouts; that the mangroves were a belt of trees
upon a sandbank and that the water deepened inside; that the tide
evidently rose very high, from the tufts of seaweeds in the
bushes; that it was then rapidly coming in (which was evident
enough, for the boat was afloat) and that the other side of the
mangrove bushes was an open sea.</p>

<p>This was unpleasant intelligence. That it was untrue I felt
assured; but one man, who certainly could not have seen more than
a hundred yards ahead of him on so dark a night, spoke as
confidently as if he had seen fifty miles, and this discouraged
the others: so by way of keeping their minds occupied I got under
weigh again and stood off a little to the southward in the hopes
of falling in with the other boat. We cheered at intervals of a
few minutes, and fired a gun, whereupon ensued a great screaming,
whistling, and flapping of wings amongst the waterfowl, but no
human voices were heard in reply.</p>

<p>ANCHOR OFF MANGROVE CREEK FOR THE NIGHT.</p>

<p>When we had gone as far to the southward as I thought prudent
I stood out from the shore for about a mile so as to have a good
peep in amongst the mangrove bushes in the morning for the other
boat, and having dropped our anchor we laid down as we best could
for the night; and, speculating upon what explanation the native
wise men would give to their fellows of the unknown and novel
sounds they had this night heard upon the coast, I soon fell
asleep.</p>

<p><a name="chapter15"></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER 15. THE GASCOYNE RIVER.</h2>

<p>REACH AND ENTER A MANGROVE CREEK.</p>

<p>March 4.</p>

<p>Early in the morning I had a good lookout kept for the other
boat, which I was very anxious to see in order that I might have
a sufficiently numerous party for the purpose of landing and
looking for water; as I always held it to be better, upon first
appearing amongst natives who had never before seen Europeans, to
show such strength as might impress them with a certainty that we
were well able to resist any attack which they might naturally
feel inclined to make on such strange and incomprehensible
intruders as white men must necessarily appear to them. Soon
after the sun rose we descried the other boat about three miles
to the southward of us; and I despatched two men to wade along
the flats and communicate with Mr. Walker: they were to direct
him to get under weigh and to make the best of his course, either
by tracking, pulling, or sailing, until he reached the point
where I might land.</p>

<p>The men whom I sent quickly made his boat, which I perceived
moving slowly up the flats; and as soon as the men rejoined me we
started. The wind was fair, being from the southward, and I
wished to reach some gently elevated hills which I saw about
eight miles to the north by east of our present position.</p>

<p>SEARCH FOR AND COMPLETE OUR WATER.</p>

<p>We soon came to a very promising opening which proved to be a
creek, with a mouth of about two hundred yards wide, running up
in a north-east direction, and having five fathoms of water
inside, but with a bar entrance. When we had proceeded up it
about two miles it became so narrow that there was not sufficient
space left for the men to use their oars; therefore, making fast
the two boats, I landed with a party to look for water.</p>

<p>I stepped very gingerly and cautiously on the mud, for shore
there was none; and I had the satisfaction of descending at once,
mid-leg deep in the odious slime; but this being endured the
worst was over, and, at the head of my sticking and floundering
party, I waded on, putting to flight whole armies of crabs who
had taken up their abode in these umbrageous groves, for such
they certainly were. The life of a crab in these undisturbed
solitudes must be sweet in the extreme; they have plenty of
water, mud, and shade; their abodes are scarcely approachable by
the feet of men, and they can have but little to disturb their
monotonous existence save the turmoils of love and domestic
war.</p>

<p>After about two miles of wading of this description, which we
considerably increased by turning and winding about to avoid soft
places, we at length fairly stepped on terra firma and found
ourselves at the base of some almost imperceptibly-sloping ground
which gradually rose into low, red, sandy, loamy hills, thinly
covered with grass, bushes, and stunted trees. Across these we
bent our steps in a south-east direction, no change whatever
taking place in the character of the country as far as we went or
as far as we could see. But our travels in this line only
extended for about three miles, when we suddenly came upon a
lagoon of fresh water lying between two of the hills. All bent
the knee at once, at this discovery, to plunge their faces deep
in the pool, and, presently raising them up again, a black watery
line, extending round the countenance, showed plainly how deeply
each one had dipped.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith and myself laughed heartily at our dirty-faced
companions, who knelt on their hands and knees round the pool;
and whilst they were filling the beakers with water we rested
under the shade of the bush for a few minutes, and then walked
off towards the interior; but from the undulating low nature of
the ground our view was very limited, and as far as we could see
there was no sign whatever of any change in the character of the
country. On returning again to the party we found the beakers and
men equally full of water and ready for a start to the boats.</p>

<p>WADING THROUGH THE MUD.</p>

<p>When we reached again the mangrove flats a most amusing scene
commenced; wading through the mud was bad enough before, but now
that each man had a heavy keg of water upon his shoulders the
movements became truly ludicrous, more especially as both
landsmen and sailors were equally out of their element. Each
desperate plunge elicited from the sufferers oaths and
expressions which only those who have seen sailors completely at
a nonplus on shore can conceive. They were half humorous, half
pathetic, and never did I see men more thoroughly woebegone and
bedaubed with mud than the party when we made the boats
again.</p>

<p>Those whom I had left behind now greedily drank the water of
which they were so much in want, and, as it was necessary to
complete our stock of it here, after we had dined I despatched
all hands but Mr. Smith and one man back to the lagoon. Mr. Smith
was too unwell to go again and I remained with him. This party
took their rations with them as they were to remain by the lagoon
all night in order, as they termed it, "to have a good bouse out
of water, and a good wash," and were to return to the boats as
soon after daylight as possible.</p>

<p>We had remarked tracks of natives on shore but, as I saw by
their fires that they were now at least eight or ten miles from
us, I was under no apprehension of an attack from them. The
mosquitoes however threatened to be very troublesome, and when I
say that just about sunset we were completely blackened from the
numbers that covered us I do not in the least exaggerate; we
could not make a fire to keep them away, and I therefore quietly
resigned myself to my fate. Poor Smith, who was already very
feverish, passed a night of perfect torment, and awoke in the
morning seriously ill. We soon heard the voices of the party
returning and, having helped them and their loads of water out of
the mud, we returned down the creek.</p>

<p>COAST THE LAND TO THE NORTHWARD.</p>

<p>March 5.</p>

<p>On standing out there was a fresh breeze blowing from the
south-east, and when we were about half a mile from the shore the
water to the northward deepened a great deal, for although it was
now nearly low tide we had here two and a half fathoms with sandy
bottom. All along the shoals we had met with abundance of shell
and other fish, and the pearl oyster was very abundant; indeed
the shellfish along these banks were more numerous and varied
than I had ever before found them. I saw but few shells which I
recognised as belonging to the southern portions of Australia,
whilst many were identical with those which occur to the
north-west.</p>

<p>EXAMINE ANOTHER MANGROVE CREEK. CHARACTER OF THEIR
SCENERY.</p>

<p>There was no high land whatever in sight; but one low hill,
which just appeared above the mangrove tops, bore north by east.
After running north-east for about two miles with the same depth
of water we came to another opening in the mangroves of a more
promising character than several small ones which we had
previously passed, and as, from the greater depth of the water,
the extraordinary low character of the coast, and the
circumstance of the driftwood upon Dorre Island, I expected to
find a large river hereabouts, I determined to examine even the
smallest openings most narrowly; we therefore ran straight for
this one, and found that it had a shoal mouth with only four feet
water at the entrance. The opening ran east 1/2 north, and after
we had followed it up for about half a mile it became very narrow
and shoaled to two feet, so we turned about and again pulled away
to sea. This opening, as well as the first we had entered,
appeared rather like a canal running through a woody grove than
an arm of the sea; the mangrove trees afforded an agreeable
shade, and were of the most brilliant green, whilst the blue
placid water not only washed their roots but meandered through
the sinuosities of the forest like a quiet lake till sight of it
was lost in the distance.</p>

<p>We now stood north-north-west parallel to the shore, which was
fronted by mangroves; and here we again had only two and a half
feet of water. A very low chain of hills extended parallel to the
shore and about two miles behind the mangroves. We thus continued
running along the coast until we made a large opening which was
about three-quarters of a mile across at the mouth. On either
side of the entrance was a sandy point, covered with pelicans and
wild-fowl who seemed to view our approach with no slight degree
of surprise. As yet we did not know the proper entrance to the
river (for such it was) so that where we ran into it we had only
two feet of water. Three low hills were immediately in front of
us, and I afterwards ascertained that the proper course for
entering was to steer so as to keep the centre of the opening and
the middle hill in the same line.</p>

<p>DISCOVER ONE MOUTH OF THE GASCOYNE RIVER, AND EXPLORE THE
COUNTRY IN ITS VICINITY.</p>

<p>The opening now widened into a very fine reach, out of which
the water was running rapidly, and when we had ascended about a
mile I saw large trees, or snags (as they are called by the
Americans) sticking up in the bed of the river; as these trees
were of a very large size, and evidently had come from a
different country to the one we saw upon the river banks, I felt
assured that we had now discovered a stream of magnitude, and,
the eager expectations which these thoughts awoke in our breasts
rendering us all impatient, we hauled down our sail and took to
the oars. The bed of the river however became choked with
shallows and sandbanks, and when we had ascended it about three
miles, the water having shoaled to about six inches, I selected a
suitable place for our encampment and prepared to start and
explore the country on foot.</p>

<p>SURVEY OF MOUTHS OF THIS RIVER AND BABBAGE ISLAND.</p>

<p>As soon as all had been made snug I moved up the river with
three men. Its banks were here about five feet high; the bed of
white sand, and about half a mile across; the centre of the
channel was full of salt water, and in breadth about a quarter of
a mile. We had not proceeded more than a few hundred yards when
we unexpectedly came upon another mouth of the river as large as
that upon which we stood, and which ran off nearly west. The
river itself appeared to come from the north-east, and we saw
salt water still further up than where we were.</p>

<p>NATIVES AND A SHARK.</p>

<p>Just on the eastern bank of the stream was a clump of small
trees and reeds which I walked up to examine with a desire to
recognise any trees belonging to known species, but to my horror,
on looking into the reeds, I saw what appeared to be a huge
alligator fast asleep. The men now peeped at it and all agreed
that it was an alligator. I therefore retreated to a respectful
and suitable distance and let fly at it with a rifle; it gave, as
we thought, a kind of shake, and then took no further notice of
us. I therefore took a double-barrelled gun from one of the men
and drove two balls through the beast, and now feeling sure it
must be dead (for it never moved) I walked up to it, when, upon
examination, it turned out to be a huge shark, of a totally new
species, which had been left in some hole by the tide where the
natives had found and killed it, and, being disturbed by our
approach, had run away, first hiding it in this clump of reeds.
There were two natives and they had made off right up the bed of
the river, taking the precaution to step in one another's tracks
so as to conceal if possible their number.</p>

<p>CHARACTER OF THE RIVER.</p>

<p>To those who have never seen a river similar to the one we
were now upon it is difficult to convey a true idea of its
character. It consisted of several channels or beds divided from
each other by long strips of land, which, in times of flood,
become islands; the main channel had an average breadth of about
two hundred and seventy yards; the average height of the bank at
the edge of it was about fifteen feet, and the bed of the river
was composed of porous red sand apparently incapable of
containing water unless when previously saturated with it. After
passing the highest point reached by the sea this huge river bed
was perfectly dry, and looked the most mournful, deserted spot
imaginable. Occasionally we found in this bare sandy channel
waterholes of eighteen or twenty feet in depth, surrounded with
tea trees and vegetation, and the driftwood, washed high up into
these trees, sufficiently attested what rapid currents sometimes
swept along the now dry channel. Even the waterholes were nearly
all dried up, and in the bottom of these the natives had scooped
their little wells.</p>

<p>The river channel ran up in a due north-east direction for
about four miles without in the least altering its character. It
was in vain that we walked over the intervening slips of land
into the side channels; these in all respects except in being
narrower exactly resembled the main one; and, after ranging
across from bank to bank in this way, the only general conclusion
I could arrive at was that the country upon the northern bank of
the river appeared scrubby and covered with samphire swamps,
whilst that upon its southern bank seemed rich and promising.</p>

<p>EXPLORE THE COUNTRY INLAND TO THE NORTH OF THE RIVER.</p>

<p>The river now made a sudden turn to the east by north, and we
followed it in this direction for three miles and a half without
finding the slightest change in its character or appearance. No
high land whatever was in sight, and from a low rounded hill,
which was the highest point we could see, the rise of the country
towards the interior was scarcely perceptible; indeed it
presented the appearance of being a vast delta; and such I then
and subsequently conjectured it to be.</p>

<p>During our walk up the bed of the river we had seen many
cockatoos, some wildfowl, and numerous tracks of natives; these
all appeared to me to be indications of a well watered and
fertile tract of country.</p>

<p>I now turned off west by south, quitting the bed of the river,
which I named the Gascoyne in compliment to my friend, Captain
Gascoyne, and found that we were in a very fertile district,
being one of those splendid exceptions to the general sterility
of Australia which are only occasionally met with: it apparently
was one immense delta of alluvial soil covered with gently
sloping grassy rises, for they could scarcely be called hills;
and in the valleys between these lay many freshwater lagoons
which rested upon a red clay soil that tinged the water of its
own colour and gave it an earthy taste.</p>

<p>The country here was but very lightly timbered and well
adapted for either agricultural or pastoral purposes, but
especially for the growth of cotton and sugar, should the climate
be sufficiently warm; and of this I think there can be no doubt
whatever. I was so won by the discovery of this rich district
that I wandered on unconscious of the fatigue of the party,
roaming from rising ground to rising ground, and hoping from each
eminence to gain a view of high land to the eastward, but on all
sides I could see nothing but the same low fertile country. I
however felt conscious that within a few years of the moment at
which I stood there a British population, rich in civilization
and the means of transforming an unoccupied country to one
teeming with inhabitants and produce, would have followed my
steps and be eagerly and anxiously examining my charts; and this
reflection imparted a high degree of interest and importance to
our present position and operations.</p>

<p>RETURN TO THE RIVER.</p>

<p>The darkness of night was now closing round us and Kaiber the
native, with his long thin legs, put himself at the head of the
party and, taking a star for his guide, led us with rapid and
lengthy paces across the plains to the encampment, where we found
the party anxiously waiting to hear what success we had met with.
Poor Mr. Smith was very unwell tonight with a feverish attack.
Mr. Walker had prescribed for him and ordered him to be kept
quiet. I got a meridian altitude of Procyon which put us in 24
degrees 56 minutes 57 seconds south latitude.</p>

<p>March 6. Mr. Smith was if anything worse this morning, and I
learned from some of the men that he had been wandering about all
night, and had bathed several times in the river. I remonstrated
with him about having done so, but he excused himself, and I
determined to remain stationary at this point for a day or two to
give him plenty of rest before we again started on our cruise
along the coast.</p>

<p>PLAN OF FUTURE PROCEEDINGS.</p>

<p>After the discovery of the Gascoyne the plan I made up my mind
to follow was to examine rapidly the coast as far as Cape Cuvier,
to return from that point to Bernier Island and refit; then once
more to visit the Gascoyne properly equipped, and thoroughly
explore the adjacent district to the distance of fifty or sixty
miles inland; and lastly to examine the unknown portion of Shark
Bay which lay to the southward of us.</p>

<p>At 6 A.M. the thermometer stood at 76 degrees Fahrenheit in
the shade, and this and the temperature during our stay in Shark
Bay proves that the climate there is very warm. Before breakfast
I had wells sunk in several places at some little distance inland
in order to ascertain the nature of the subsoil, for we were
abundantly supplied with water from the lagoons. In every
instance, after digging down to the depth of from six to seven
feet through a rich loam, we reached a regular sandy sea beach
and salt water (it must however be recollected that we dug in the
deepest hollows) so that it appeared as if the whole of this flat
country was a formation left upon the shoals with which the coast
is bounded; and it almost seemed as if the sea still flowed in
upon its old bed and under this recent freshwater deposit.</p>

<p>Directly after breakfast I got ferried across the river to the
island lying between its two mouths, which I called Babbage
Island after C. Babbage, Esquire. This island is low and sandy in
all parts except where it fronts the sea; but on that side a row
of high sandy dunes have been thrown up. There is no very good
land on it, it being almost covered with samphire swamps and
intersected by deep channels into which the sea runs; these are
nearly concealed in some places by the vegetation, which rendered
it impossible to avoid sundry falls and wettings in crossing it.
It bears a few mangroves but I saw no other trees.</p>

<p>The men throughout the day were occupied in watering and in
making canvas cloths for my boats to prevent the water from
pouring in over the gunwales, which were very low; and my own
time was sufficiently occupied in surveying. On my return in the
evening I found Mr. Smith so much wore cheerful and so much
better that I determined to start about noon the next day for the
northward.</p>

<p>EXCURSION TO THE NORTH OF THE RIVER.</p>

<p>March 7.</p>

<p>I went off with a party before dawn to explore the country to
the northward of the Gascoyne. We crossed the river just above
the point where it separates into two mouths, and then struck off
in a north by east direction. Travelling about a mile after we
had crossed the river we came to seven native huts, built of
large-sized logs, much higher and altogether of a very superior
description to those made by the natives on the south-western
coast. Kaiber examined them very carefully and then proposed that
we should go no farther, as he thought that the natives must be
very large men from their having such large huts. We however
pushed forward and, as I had none but good walkers with me, we
made about nine miles in two hours and a half: throughout the
whole of this distance we saw nothing that could be called a
hill, the whole country being evidently at times flooded up to
the foot of a gently-rising land which we distinguished to the
eastward. We did not notice a single tree but plenty of low
prickly bushes, samphire, and a small plant somewhat resembling
the English heath. The weather was very hot, and at the end of
the nine miles we reached a saltwater inlet so broad and deep
that we could not cross it. We here halted and rested a little
and then made our way back to the boats.</p>

<p>APPROACH OF NATIVES.</p>

<p>I found Mr. Smith much better and, there being now nothing to
delay us, we started. When we had got about half a mile down the
river we saw two natives following us along the shore, jumping
about in the most extraordinary way, and, from their
gesticulations and manner, evidently ordering us to quit the
coast. From the mountebank actions of these fellows I guessed
that they were two of the native sorcerers, who were charming us
away but, as I was not disposed to be so easily got rid of, we
pulled near the shore and lay upon our oars to give them an
opportunity of coming up to us.</p>

<p>ATTEMPT AT A CONFERENCE. INTERVIEW WITH NATIVES.</p>

<p>Upon this they mounted a little eminence, blew most furiously
at us, and performed other equally efficacious ceremonies. I
however felt just as well after we had been subjected to this
dire sorcery as I did before; and we continued to pull gently
along the shore, still trying to induce them to approach, which
they at last did, having nothing but a fishing-spear in their
hands. To entice them towards us I had made Kaiber strip himself
and stand up in the boat; and now that they were near enough to
us I told him to call out to them and say that we were friends.
He hereupon shouted out, "Come in, come in; Mr. Grey sulky
yu-a-da;" by which he intended to say, "Come here, come here; Mr.
Grey is not angry with you." The two sorcerers, utterly confused
by this mode of address, committed more overt acts of witchcraft
towards us than they had even hitherto done; and Kaiber, turning
round to me, said, "Weak ears have they and wooden foreheads;
they do not understand the southern language." But as I was
dissatisfied with his proof of their knowledge of the southern
language I desired him to wade ashore and speak to them.</p>

<p>KAIBER'S DREAD OF THEM.</p>

<p>This order of mine was a perfect thunderbolt to Kaiber. He, in
common with all the aboriginal inhabitants of Australia, had an
utter aversion to all strange natives; and to this he joined a
sort of religious horror of witches, buck-witches, warlocks, and
uncanny persons generally. King James the First could never have
found a more zealous and participating partner of his fears than
Kaiber; he gave me a blank look of horror and assured me that
these were actual sorcerers, "northern sorcerers;" and as he
repeated these last words there was a mysterious, deep meaning in
his tone, as if he expected to see me thrill with terror.</p>

<p>From his earliest infancy he had been accustomed to dread
these men; every storm that occurred he had been taught to
consider as arising from their incantations: if one of his
friends or relatives died a natural death he had attributed that
death to the spells and unholy practices of these very people
with whom he was now directed to go and hold converse. I thought
of all this and pitied him; for even for a native he was
excessively superstitious. But I was extremely anxious to
establish friendly relations with them; therefore I was positive
and repeated to him my former directions that he should wade
ashore, coax them up, and speak to them.</p>

<p>In as far as a native can turn white from fear Kaiber did turn
white, and then stepping into the water he waded ashore and the
two natives cautiously approached him. As soon as they were close
to him I joined the party with a large piece of damper in one
hand and a piece of pork in the other. The natives were
dreadfully frightened; they stood in the presence of unknown and
mysterious beings. No persuasions could induce them to take my
hand or to touch me; and they trembled from head to foot.</p>

<p>FRIENDLY COMMUNICATION ESTABLISHED.</p>

<p>For a time they were nearly unintelligible to Kaiber and
myself, but as they gained confidence I found that they spoke a
dialect very closely resembling that of the natives to the north
of the Swan River. They addressed many questions to us, such as,
Whence we had come? where we were going to? was the boat a dead
tree? but they evaded giving any direct answers to our questions.
Being anxious to start I now left them to bear to their
companions the strange food I had bestowed, and to recount to
eager listeners the mysterious tale of their interview with
beings from another world, and who were of an unknown form and
colour.</p>

<p>SAIL FROM THE GASCOYNE.</p>

<p>Whilst they hurried off with some such thoughts passing
through their minds we pulled down the Gascoyne in search of new
lands and new adventures.</p>

<p>AFFINITY OF DIALECTS.</p>

<p>The result of this conference affords an example of the
grounds upon which any similarity of the language in different
portions of the continent of Australia has been denied. In this
instance, had I at first taken the word of Kaiber for it, I
should have left the Gascoyne with a firm conviction that the
natives of that part of Australia spoke a radically different
language from the natives near the Swan River; and this would
have been proved by the fact of a native from the south not
understanding them: whereas there is a great affinity between the
two dialects, to discover which requires however an acquaintance
with the general principles of language, some knowledge of the
one in question, and due patience. I can only say that wherever I
have been in the southern portions of the continent I could soon
understand the natives.</p>

<p><a name="chapter16"></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER 16. TO KOLAINA AND BACK TO THE GASCOYNE.</h2>

<p>EXAMINE THE COAST TO THE NORTH OF THE GASCOYNE.</p>

<p>March 7.</p>

<p>When we got outside the mouth of the Gascoyne a fresh breeze
was blowing from the south-east. We ran along the shore west by
north, keeping about a quarter of a mile from it; and after
having made about three miles and a half we reached the southern
extremity of the other mouth of the river. The mean depth in our
course along Babbage Island had been from two and a half fathoms
to three fathoms; and this opening had a bar which we then
conceived to run right across the mouth of the river. The
northern extremity of Babbage Island is a very remarkable low
point of land which I called Mangrove Point. It cannot fail to be
recognised for it is the first point from the northward along the
eastern shores of Shark Bay where mangroves are found, and from
that point they extend almost uninterruptedly down the eastern
coast of this bay to the south, as far as I have seen it.</p>

<p>CONTINUE THE COURSE TO THE NORTHWARD.</p>

<p>The coast now trended north by west and we continued to run
along it. After passing Mangrove Point the sandy dunes along the
shore ceased, and the land appeared to be scarcely elevated above
the level of the sea: not a hill or tree could be perceived, and
a low black line almost level with the water's edge was the only
indication that we had of being near land.</p>

<p>LYELL'S RANGE.</p>

<p>This kind of shore continues for about nine miles, when low
sandhills begin to rise parallel to the coast, and these
gradually increase in altitude until they form that remarkable
range of dunes which I have called Lyell's Range. When it wanted
about an hour to sunset we had made about twenty-five miles, and
then ran in closer along the coast to look either for a boat
harbour or some spot at which we could beach them. But nothing
suited to our purpose could we see: the coast was straight,
sandy, exposed and lashed by a tremendous surf; the wind now
freshened considerably and the sky looked very threatening; we
had therefore no resource left but either to run to the northward
before the breeze or to beach the boats. I chose the first
alternative; and we coasted within about a quarter of a mile of
the shore, just outside the surf, looking out for any spot which
gave us the least hope of beaching in safety.</p>

<p>BEACH THE BOATS.</p>

<p>As the sun sank so freshened the breeze, until it blew a good
half gale of wind, and everything gave indications of approaching
foul weather. This was no coast to be on during a stormy night in
heavily laden whale-boats; and as it now began to grow dark I
determined at all hazards to beach rather than be driven out to
sea in a gale of wind. I accordingly ran my boat in through the
surf, leaving the other one outside to see what success we had
before they made the attempt.</p>

<p>BOAT SWAMPED IN BEACHING.</p>

<p>The surf was very heavy but the men behaved steadily and well;
and through it we went, dancing along like a cork in a mill-pond;
at last one huge roller caught us, all hands gave way, and we
were hurried along on the top of the swelling billow, which then
suddenly fell under us and broke; in a moment after we had
grounded, and although still upwards of two hundred yards from
the shore, we all jumped out to haul the boat up, but ere we
could move our heavily laden whaler beyond a few yards breaker
after breaker came tumbling in and completely swamped it. We
continued to haul away and presently found ourselves swimming. In
fact the whole coast hereabouts was fronted by a kind of bar of
sand, distant about two hundred yards from the shore, with not
more than two feet water on it. Between this and the shore the
water was tolerably smooth and two fathoms deep. It was upon this
outer bar that we had struck, and the other boat experienced the
same fate as ourselves. We of course passed a miserable night in
our drenched and wretched state; but it was at all events some
comfort, when we heard during the night the boisterous wind
blowing outside, to feel that we were safe ashore.</p>

<p>DAMAGE TO OUR PROVISIONS.</p>

<p>March 8.</p>

<p>As soon as we had sufficient light for the purpose I proceeded
to examine the stores. The flour was not very good at starting;
it had been packed in small bags, that being the most convenient
form to have it in both for stowing and transporting it on men's
shoulders; and in the hurricane which we had experienced on Dorre
Island this flour had got thoroughly soaked: from that period to
the present time it had been constantly wet with salt water; last
night's adventures completed its disasters and it was now quite
spoilt and an unwholesome article of food; but having nothing
else to eat we were forced to satisfy ourselves with it, and I
directed it to be dried in the sun and then carefully repacked.
The wind was from the south-south-west, about half a gale, and
there was such a tremendous surf on the shore that to launch the
boats was impossible. I therefore started to look for water and
to explore the country.</p>

<p>SEARCH FOR WATER.</p>

<p>The point we had landed at was immediately at the base of some
bare sandhills, about four hundred feet high. These are the hills
which are visible from the high land of Dorre Island on the
opposite side of the bay: it struck me that from their great
height and their porous nature there was a probability of our
finding water by digging, even in this apparently sandy desert; I
therefore selected a spot at the foot of the highest hill, in the
bare sand, and ordered a well to be opened. Our efforts were
crowned with success; the well had not been sunk more than four
or five feet when we came to a coarse gravelly sand, saturated
with water, which was perfectly sweet and good; and when the well
was sunk about two or three feet deeper the water poured in so
fast that there would have been no difficulty in watering a ship
at this point.</p>

<p>APPEARANCE OF A LAKE. EXAMINATION OF IT.</p>

<p>Whilst the men were engaged in filling the water kegs I
ascended the highest sandhill, the summit of which was not
distant more than a mile from the well. When I gained this a most
splendid sight burst upon my view: to the westward stretched the
boundless sea, lashed by the wind into white and curling waves;
whilst to the east of me lay a clear calm unruffled lake, studded
with little islands. To the north or north-east I could, even
with a good telescope, see no limits to this lake, and, with the
exception of the numerous beautiful islands with which it was
studded, I could, even from the commanding position which I
occupied, distinguish nothing like rising land anywhere between
north by east and south-east. The lake had a glassy and
fairy-like appearance, and I sat down alone on the lofty eminence
to contemplate this great water which the eye of European now for
the first time rested on. I looked seaward, and it appeared as if
nature had heaped up the narrow and lofty sandy barrier on which
I stood to shut out from the eyes of man the lovely and
fairy-like land which lay beyond it.</p>

<p>At length I rose and returned to the party. The news of my
discovery filled all with hope; and, our miserable breakfast
having been hurriedly despatched, I selected three men to
accompany me in my first examination of the shores of this inland
sea. When we had gained the top of the sandhills the surprise of
these men was as great as my own, and they begged me to allow
them to return and endeavour by the united efforts of the party
to carry one of the whale-boats over the intervening range, and
at once to launch it on this body of water.</p>

<p>I however deemed it more prudent in the first instance to
select the best route along which to move the whale-boat, as well
as to choose a spot which afforded facilities for launching it.
In pursuance of this determination we descended the eastern side
of the sandhills which abruptly fell in that direction with a
slope certainly not much exceeding an angle of 45 degrees. I now
found that the water did not approach so near the foot of the
hills as I had imagined, but that immediately at their base lay
extensive plains of mud and sand, at times evidently flooded by
the sea; for on them lay dead shells of many kinds and sizes, as
well as large travelled blocks of coral. The water here appeared
to be about a mile distant; it was also apparently boundless in
an east and north-east direction: and was studded with
islands.</p>

<p>REMARKABLE PLAINS. DELUSION FROM MIRAGE.</p>

<p>We still all felt convinced that it was water we saw, for the
shadows of the low hills near it, as well as those of the trees
upon them, could be distinctly traced on the unruffled surface.
As we continued to advance, the water however constantly
retreated before us and at last surrounded us. I now found that
we had been deceived by mirage; the apparent islands being really
such only when these plains are covered by the sea. In many
places the sandy mud was so moist that we sank deeply into it,
and after travelling for fifteen miles on a north-east course I
could still see no limit to these plains in that direction, nor
could I either then or on any subsequent occasion find the
channel which connected them with the sea. The only mode of
accounting for their being flooded is to suppose that the sea at
times pours in over the low land which lies to the north of the
Gascoyne, and flows northward through channels which will be seen
in the chart of this part of the country; but I then believed,
and still consider, that there is hereabouts a communication with
some large internal water.</p>

<p>We saw no tracks of natives and only a few of emus and native
dogs. The few portions of rising ground which lay near the edge
of these extensive plains were sandy, scrubby, and unpromising;
but what we saw was so little that no opinion of the country
could fairly be deduced from it. We dug in several places on the
flats and in their vicinity but all the water we could find was
salt; whereas in the narrow range of sandhills separating them
from the sea we had discovered abundance of fresh water only four
or five feet below the surface of the valleys lying between these
hills. As this range of more than thirty miles in length offered
many geological phenomena I called it Lyell's Range in compliment
to the distinguished geologist of that name; the plains
themselves I named the Plains of Kolaina (Deceit).</p>

<p>INDISPOSITION OF SEVERAL OF THE PARTY. SICKNESS FROM DELAY AND
DISAPPOINTMENT.</p>

<p>On my return to the boats I found that Mr. Smith was still
unwell; several other men were also complaining; I myself was
wearied from exertion and disappointment that my great discovery
had dwindled away: the place where we were was infested by
land-crabs who kept running over us continually, and the sand
which drifted before the wind got into the pores of the skin, and
kept most of us in a constant state of painful irritation. The
night was therefore not a pleasant one.</p>

<p>March 9.</p>

<p>Throughout the night the winds had howled loudly and the surf
broke hoarsely upon the shore. The grey dawn of morning brought
no comfort with it: far out to seaward nothing but broken water
could be seen, and half a gale of wind blew from the south by
east. The bad and insufficient food I had been compelled to eat
had brought on violent sickness and other evil effects, and I
found myself very ill. As the daylight advanced report after
report came to me that some one of the party had been attacked by
the same diseases experienced by Mr. Smith and myself.</p>

<p>EXAMINATION OF THE SHORE TO THE NORTHWARD, AND OF THE COUNTRY
TO THE SOUTH-EAST.</p>

<p>I was only well enough to write and survey a little, but I
sent off a party to a point which lay about six miles to the
north of us, and they on their return reported that there was a
continuation of a similar shore for the next fourteen or fifteen
miles, bordered in like manner by sandy muddy plains similar to
those behind the hills where we were.</p>

<p>This party found one of the yellow and black water-snakes
asleep upon a piece of dry seaweed on the beach and killed it.
The fact of this animal being found on shore proves its
amphibious character. I saw them in one instance, in December
1837, so far out at sea as to be distant 150 miles from land.</p>

<p>Sunday March 10.</p>

<p>I spent a wretched night from illness and foul weather; the
roaring of the surf on the shore was so loud and incessant that
to one feverish and in want of quiet and rest it was a positive
distress, and both Mr. Smith, myself, and half the men were at
this time seriously indisposed. We had strong gales of wind all
day from south by east, but in the afternoon I walked out for
five miles in an east-south-east direction with such of the men
as were able to move; nothing however could be seen but a
continuation of the same barren, treeless country; we observed no
signs of natives except tracks in the mud of a single man who had
passed some months ago.</p>

<p>It annoyed me now to find that the silvering of the glasses of
my large sextant was so much injured from the constant wettings
it had experienced that this day it was almost useless. I had
hoped in the course of our walk to have fallen in with some game,
but we did not see a single bird with the exception of some small
ones, about the size of tomtits, which flew from bush to bush
along the sandhills.</p>

<p>SUFFERINGS FROM HEAT AND PRIVATION.</p>

<p>We had a small quantity of portable soup with us, nearly all
of which we used, and it in some degree restored us, but another
miserable night was passed by us all and in the morning I was
grieved to see how ill many of the men looked. Their situation
was really deplorable and I had with me neither medicines nor
proper food to give them. Abundance of these lay at our depot not
more than forty miles from us, yet to reach it was impossible;
and dawn this morning had only revealed to us a heavier surf and
stronger gale from the southward than we had yet experienced.
None of the men were well enough to undergo the fatigue of
another day's walking, so I busied myself with making
observations and taking bearings, and thus the forenoon wore
away. The point of the coast on which we were lay in 24 degrees
30 minutes south latitude, and the mean temperature up to this
period had been:</p>

<p>6 A.M. 76.<br>
12 M. 83.<br>
3 P.M. 87.<br>
6 P.M. 78 degrees.</p>

<p>At noon a portion of some disgusting damper and a small piece
of pork was served out to each of us and, having soon disposed of
this, the men lay down under the side of the boats, seeking some
shelter from the burning rays of a tropical sun which, being
reflected back from the white sand, were very oppressive.</p>

<p>AFFRAY WITH THE NATIVES.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="grey1-24"></a><img alt="" src="/ebooks/e00054-images/grey1-24.jpg"></p>

<p><b>21. Attack of Natives near Kolaina Plains. Drawn on stone
by George Barnard from a sketch by Frederick C. Smith, Esquire.
M. and N. Hanhart, Lithographic Printers, 64 Charlotte Street,
Rathbone Place.</b></p>
</center>

<p>I was occupied in sketching in a portion of the coastline, and
whilst thus engaged I thought I saw the figures of two natives
moving upon a hill a few hundred yards to the north of us; they
appeared to me to be behind some low bushes which were close to
the summit of this hill. I watched the bushes narrowly and felt
nearly confident I saw them; but however to be sure beyond a
doubt I got up and took my eyes from the spot for a few seconds
whilst I walked to get my telescope. I then carefully examined
the hill with the glass and could see nothing but the low bushes
on it. "A pretty bushman I am," I thought to myself, "to be thus
deceived with two old shrubs; I should have known a native
better;" and with a feeling almost of annoyance at my mistake I
resumed my seat on an inverted water-keg and went on with my
drawing. Within a minute's time an alarm of natives was given,
and starting up I saw from twenty to thirty on some sandhills to
the north of us, distant about two hundred yards; their spears
were fixed in their throwing-sticks and they evidently were
prepared for a fray. I therefore ran to the boat for my gun,
which Ruston tried to get out for me; and at this moment, on
casting my eyes upwards, I saw a native start up on the sandbank
not more than fifteen yards from Ruston and myself; he poised his
spear for one second, and it then came whistling at us. I dodged
and the spear flew past without my seeing what became of it. I
instantly gave the order to watch the bank and to fire at
anything that showed itself above it; and Mr. Walker now had got
hold of his gun and very gallantly ran up the bank and occupied
it: in the meantime the native who had thrown the spear caught up
a bag in each hand and ran off. Several shots which were fired at
the distant natives scraped up the sand so near them that they
found it prudent to decamp as speedily as they could.</p>

<p>CHASE AFTER STOLEN GOODS.</p>

<p>I found that Ruston was wounded slightly in the knee by the
spear which the native had thrown, and we had also sustained a
severe loss in the bags which they had carried off as one of them
contained fourteen fishing-lines and several other articles of
great value to us in our present position. I therefore determined
upon a pursuit in the hopes of recovering these, and taking four
or five men I gave chase. The long-legged natives had however
considerably the advantage of us both in bottom, wind, and
cunning; and whenever they found we gained at all upon them they
strewed a few articles out of the bags upon the ground, and these
it took us some time to collect; and in this manner, alternately
running and stopping to pick things up, I continued the pursuit
until near sunset. At this time three of us had completely outrun
the rest of our party, who were far behind; the natives had also
latterly made great headway, so that they were rapidly dropping
us astern; we also had recovered everything but the fishing-lines
(which however we could but ill spare). I therefore determined to
collect my forces and return to the boats. In the ardour of
pursuit I found we had come five or six miles, and it had been
for some time dark when we again reached the encampment.</p>

<p>The natives in this attack were far too few in number to
render it a very formidable affair for from five-and-twenty to
thirty savages, armed alone with spears, could have availed very
little against eleven resolute Europeans with fire-arms in their
hands. The native who had stolen so near us was however most
decidedly a noble and daring fellow: their object evidently was
to possess themselves of our property; and we had had one man
wounded in the fray, and had lost some fishing-lines, without
gaining any reparation. I therefore felt well assured that they
would pay us another visit; and thus, to the misfortunes we were
already suffering under, we had the new one added of being on
hostile terms with the surrounding aborigines. It moreover set in
to rain hard and to blow fresher than ever just as we reached the
boats. I saw that all that could be done for Ruston had been
attended to, and then, lying down, tried to forget my troubles in
sleep.</p>

<p>CONTINUED DETENTION FROM FOUL WEATHER. DESOLATE AND GLOOMY
SITUATION.</p>

<p>From this period up to Friday the 15th of March the wind blew
strong from the southward, accompanied with such a heavy sea and
tremendous surf that to move was impossible. Our position was
very trying; inactivity, under the circumstances in which we were
situated, was most difficult to support; for the mind, ever prone
to prey upon itself, does so far more when you are compelled to
sit down and patiently submit to misfortunes against which there
are no means of resistance. Such was the state to which we were
now reduced, on a barren and unknown coast which the foot of
civilized man had never before trodden: many of my party were
suffering acute bodily pain from the badness of the provisions on
which they were compelled to subsist; the weakness of most of
them, and myself amongst the number, precluded the possibility of
any distant explorations being made, and we were kept in a
constant state of watchfulness in order to prevent the natives
from again surprising us; for they repeatedly showed themselves
in our vicinity, hovering about with no friendly intentions. All
that was left therefore for us was to sit upon the lonely beach,
watching the winds and the waters until some favourable moment
might enable us to get off and once more engage in that task of
which so small a portion was as yet accomplished.</p>

<p>Day after day did we sit and wait for this favourable moment
until the noise of the hoarse breaking surf had become a familiar
sound to our ears; but the longer the men watched the more
dispirited did they become; each returning day found them more
weak and wan, more gloomy and petulant, than the preceding one;
and when the eighth day of constant and fruitless expectation
slowly closed upon us I felt a gloomy foreboding creeping over
me.</p>

<p>By making observations, drawing, writing up my journal, etc. I
had managed hitherto to keep my mind employed. I had also tasked
my ability to the utmost to constantly invent some occupation for
the men, but my resources of this nature were now all exhausted;
and on Friday night I stretched myself on the sand, not to sleep,
but to brood, throughout the weary night, on our present
position.</p>

<p>CONSOLATIONS OF RELIGION.</p>

<p>It may be asked if, during such a trying period, I did not
seek from religion that consolation which it is sure to afford?
My answer is, Yes; and I farther feel assured that, but for the
support I derived from prayer and frequent perusal and meditation
of the Scriptures, I should never have been able to have borne
myself in such a manner as to have maintained discipline and
confidence amongst the rest of the party: nor in all my
sufferings did I ever lose the consolation derived from a firm
reliance upon the goodness of Providence. It is only those who go
forth into perils and dangers, amidst which human foresight and
strength can but little avail, and who find themselves, day after
day, protected by an unseen influence, and ever and again
snatched from the very jaws of destruction by a power which is
not of this world, who can at all estimate the knowledge of one's
own weakness and littleness, and the firm reliance and trust upon
the goodness of the Creator which the human breast is capable of
feeling. Like all other lessons which are of great and lasting
benefit to man this one must be learnt amid much sorrowing and
woe; but, having learnt it, it is but the sweeter from the pain
and toil which are undergone in the acquisition.</p>

<p>PUT TO SEA.</p>

<p>March 16.</p>

<p>A great portion of Friday night was passed by me in walking up
and down the beach, anxiously looking out seaward; and it
appeared to me about three o'clock that the wind had much abated;
from this period until dawn it continued gradually to subside:
and as daylight stole in I saw that the surf had somewhat fallen.
I resolved at all events to lose no single chance that offered
itself in our favour, so I turned all hands out, and in a few
minutes the boats rode triumphantly beyond the surf, which was
indeed much heavier than I expected to have found it, and my boat
was nearly filled in passing the outer bar: but now the surf was
behind us, and it is the nature of man to laugh at perils that
are past. Our thoughts too were soon called to present
difficulties, for a tremendous sea was running outside, the wind
directly in our teeth, and every moment freshening again.
Throughout the whole of Saturday the men toiled incessantly at
their oars, and when it wanted about an hour to sunset we had
only made about seven miles and a half of southing.</p>

<p>COMPELLED AGAIN TO BEACH THE BOATS.</p>

<p>The wind had again increased to such a degree as to endanger
our safety, and it appeared to freshen as the night came on. I
therefore had no resource left but again to beach the boats on
this dangerous coast. Once more, then, was the scene repeated of
dancing in a boat with maddening speed upon furious rollers,
until these break and it is borne in, followed by a mass of foam
far higher than the stern, which appears eagerly to pursue for
the purpose of engulfing it.</p>

<p>BEACHING BOATS.</p>

<p>There is no scene in nature more exciting or which in a
greater degree calls forth one's energy than the beaching of a
boat in a dangerous surf. Never did I on such occasions take the
steer-oar for the purpose of running the boat in but many
contending feelings rushed through my mind, and after a few
moments settled down into the calm which springs from the
conviction that the general safety in coming dangers depends
altogether upon the coolness and resolution with which they are
met, and never more so than in beaching a boat when once you are
among the foaming waters; in you must go; to retreat is
impossible, and nothing is left but that each one silently and
steadily do his duty, regardless of the strife and din of raging
waves around. The only plan to adopt is for all to give way
strongly and steadily, let what will take place, whilst the
boat-steerer keeps her head straight for the beach. A huge roller
breaks right into the boat and almost swamps it, a man is knocked
over and loses his oar, heed not these things; let each man mind
his own oar and nought else, and give way give way strongly,
until the boat grounds, then in a moment each quits his oar and
springs into the water, and ere the wave has retired the boat is
partially run up; another wave succeeds, and the operation of
running up is repeated until she is high and dry. Had our boats
been swamped in the surf, even if we had escaped with our lives,
our position would have been fearful; left without food or
resources in an unknown and savage country so far beyond the
reach of man's assistance. When therefore I again saw the boats
safely beached, and my little party drying themselves over a
fire, my breast filled with thankfulness to that Providence who
had again watched over our safety.</p>

<p>ADJACENT COUNTRY EXPLORED.</p>

<p>Sunday March 17.</p>

<p>It blew half a gale of wind from the southward all night, and
next morning such a surf was breaking upon the beach that to have
attempted to move would have been madness. Here we were therefore
once more kept prisoners upon this dreary coast; the country was
exactly similar to that lying immediately to the north of it,
with these two exceptions, that the range of sandhills was less
elevated, and that we could not here find fresh water. The
morning was passed in searching for it; in the middle of the day
I read a few appropriate chapters in the Bible to the men, and in
the afternoon I explored the country but discovered nothing
whatever of an interesting nature.</p>

<p>LAUNCH THE BOATS, AND ENTER NORTHERN MOUTH OF THE GASCOYNE.
CHARACTER OF THE COUNTRY.</p>

<p>March 18.</p>

<p>The wind was much lighter this morning and the surf not so
heavy; we made a successful attempt to launch the boats just
before sunrise. The wind still blew from the southward, and we
found a heavy sea running outside. The men however exerted all
their energies and just before sunset we reached the northern
mouth of the Gascoyne, and found a very good passage into it with
twelve feet water at low ebb-tide; but the other boat, not
following our track, stuck fast on a sandbank, where she was soon
left high and dry, and the tide fell so fast that we had a great
deal of trouble in getting her afloat again.</p>

<p>BABBAGE ISLAND.</p>

<p>The bar once passed there are three and three and a half
fathoms in this land-locked creek even at low water; the portion
of Babbage Island which is between it and the sea appears to be
nothing but a shifting bed of sand, and the mainland a delta,
covered with mangrove swamps and brackish lagoons, at least for
about a mile back.* We lay down upon the sand close to the boats,
which were left at anchor with a boat-keeper in each, and found
great difficulty in collecting driftwood enough to make our
fires.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. In the year 1667 the Dutch Commodore
Vlaming appears to have visited these coasts and to have ascended
a river which might have been the Gascoyne. The account of his
exploration is thus briefly given by Flinders (Terra Australis
volume 1 Introduction page 61) After relating the arrival of his
two ships off Cape Inscription at the north end of Dirk Hartog's
Island he proceeds:<br>
 No mention is made by Valentyn of the ships entering the road,
nor of their departure from it; but it should seem that they
anchored on February 4th. On the 5th Commodore Vlaming and the
commander of the Nyptang went with three boats to the shore,
which proved to be an island. They found also a river, and went
up it four or five leagues, amongst rocks and shoals, when they
saw much water inland, as if the country were drowned, but no
men, nor anything for food, and wherever they dug the ground was
salt. They afterwards came to another river, which they ascended
about a league, and found it to terminate in a round basin, and
to be entirely salt water. No men were seen, nor any animals,
except divers, which were very shy; and the country was destitute
of grass and trees. Returning downward on the 10th, they saw
footsteps of men and children of the common size, and observed
the point of entrance into the river to be a very red
sand.)</blockquote>

<p>March 19.</p>

<p>The wind still blew pretty fresh from the southward; we
however had no surf to impede us and therefore got under weigh
soon after dawn. The men pulled away cheerfully and, although
this was very hard work on account of the headwind and sea, we
experienced no great difficulty until we had rounded Point
Whitmore, at the north of Babbage Island, where we all at once
found ourselves in broken water, so very shoal that between each
breaker the boat was bumped with great violence against the
bottom, and must have been very soon stove in had we not speedily
got into deeper soundings.</p>

<p>ANCHOR IN SOUTHERN ENTRANCE OF THE RIVER.</p>

<p>About 2 P.M. we neared the southern mouth of the Gascoyne,
pulled two miles up it, and anchored about a mile and a half to
the south of our former position. The men, although it was very
warm and they had been pulling hard all day, had as yet only had
about a wine-glass full of water each, I therefore lost no time
in sending off a watering party; and the remainder of us
collected samphire which grew abundantly hereabouts and forms a
fair article of food for hungry men.</p>

<p>The remainder of the evening was occupied in completing our
water and in endeavouring to get a shot at some pelicans, but
although numerous they were too wary, and my feet were covered
with such dreadful sores from bad diet and being constantly in
the salt water that I could not walk to any great distance in
search of game.</p>

<p>COMPLETE OUR WATER.</p>

<p>The completion of our supply of water was a very great matter
and, as we had now got so far to the southward as to make our
fetching the northern extremity of Bernier Island almost a matter
of certainty, however strongly it might blow, I determined to
effect the passage the next day. Indeed I could not have delayed
it for our provisions, bad as they were, were almost exhausted,
and the men were already much reduced from the scarcity and bad
quality of their food.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 17. FROM THE GASCOYNE TO GANTHEAUME BAY.</h2>

<p>SAIL FROM THE GASCOYNE.</p>

<p>March 20.</p>

<p>When we pulled out of the Gascoyne this morning the first
streak of dawn had not lit up the eastern horizon, we however
managed by creeping along the southern shore to get out to sea,
and there anchored until it was light enough to see the compass.
I found a very heavy sea running outside and a strong breeze
blowing from the southward; at this time however there was
nothing which in my opinion rendered it too hazardous to risk the
passage, more especially being pressed as we were by the want of
food. The distance across to Bernier Island from the point of the
main where we were was about ten miles further than it is from
Dover to Calais. Our boats were in very bad repair, and the
landing on the other side was by no means good. I therefore
certainly would not have ventured to make the passage in a gale
of wind; but the weather did not seem threatening and it had been
for many successive days blowing as hard as it was when we
started.</p>

<p>CAUGHT IN A GALE OF WIND.</p>

<p>We might have gone nine or ten miles when the wind suddenly
increased, and ere we had made five more it had become a perfect
gale and we were obliged to keep the boats close hauled, for had
we run ever so little before the wind we should not have fetched
Bernier Island, and consequently should have been blown right out
to sea. We had nothing therefore now to do but to struggle for
it, and to use every energy to save ourselves. Sea after sea
broke into the boat but the water was as rapidly baled out: none
could have behaved better than the crews of both boats did, and
the whole scene was one of such constant, cheerful, and
successful exertion that, great as our danger was, I do not
recollect ever having a keener perception of the pleasure of
excited feelings, or a more thorough revelry of joyous emotions,
than I had during this perilous passage.</p>

<p>REACH BERNIER ISLAND.</p>

<p>Bernier Island at last rose in sight and amidst the giant
waves we occasionally caught a peep of its rocky shores; but we
were so tossed to and fro that it was only now and then that from
the summit of some lofty sea we could sight a high shore which
was not more than four or five miles from us. We had made the
island about five miles from its northern extremity, and I ran
along the shore until I found a convenient landing-place about a
mile and a half to the south of our old one.</p>

<p>CHANGE IN THE LAND.</p>

<p>It was perfectly sheltered by reefs and an island, but it
surprised me that I had not remarked this cove on my previous
visit to the island, and I was still further astonished to see
now three new small rocky islands, of which I had no recollection
whatever. Indeed the men all for a long time stoutly denied that
this was Bernier Island and, had we not now sighted Kok's Island,
I should have doubted my skill in navigation and made up my mind
that I had fallen into some strange error; but as it was
forebodings shot across my wind as to what pranks the hurricane
might have been playing upon the island, which consisted of
nothing but loose sand heaped upon a bed of limestone rock of
very unequal elevation.</p>

<p>I ran in my own boat upon a convenient point of the beach and
the other boat followed in safety, for I did not like, in such
foul weather, to leave them at anchor on a lee shore, which had
previously proved so unsafe a position. A most awkward question
now presented itself to my consideration: from the altered
appearance of the coast I felt very considerable doubts as to the
state in which the depot might be found; supposing anything had
occurred to it I felt that it would be unadvisable that such a
discovery should be made in the presence of many persons; as
future discipline would in a great measure depend upon the first
impression that was given. Who, then, had I better select for the
purpose of visiting the depot in the first instance? After some
deliberation I made choice of Mr. Smith and Corporal Coles, in
the courage, disinterestedness, and self-possession of both of
whom I placed great confidence. I directed Mr. Walker to see
certain little alterations made in the boats before the men were
allowed to straggle; these I knew would occupy them for some time
and leave me therefore during this interval free to think and act
according to circumstances. I now called Mr. Smith and Corporal
Coles to accompany me, and told Coles to bring a spade with
him.</p>

<p>DESTRUCTION OF THE DEPOT OF PROVISIONS. SYMPTOMS OF
CALAMITY.</p>

<p>Before we had gone very far alarming symptoms met my eyes in
the form of staves of flour casks scattered about amongst the
rocks, and even high up on the sandhills. Coles however persisted
that these wore so far inland that they could only have come from
the flour casks which we had emptied before starting. I knew they
were far too numerous for such to be the case, but I suppressed
my opinion and made no remarks. We next came to a cask of salt
provisions, washed high and dry at least twenty feet above the
usual high-water mark: the sea had evidently not been near this
for a long period as it was half covered with drift sand which
must have taken some time to accumulate. This Coles easily
accounted for, it was merely the cask which had been lost from
the wreck of the Paul Pry. I still thought otherwise but said
nothing.</p>

<p>At length we reached the spot where the depot had been made:
so changed was it that both Mr. Smith and Coles persisted it was
not the place; but on going to the shore there were some very
remarkable rocks, on the top of which lay a flour cask more than
half empty, with the head knocked out, but not otherwise injured;
this also was washed up at least twenty feet of perpendicular
elevation beyond high water mark. The dreadful certainty now
flashed upon the minds of Mr. Smith and Coles, and I waited to
see what effect it would have upon them. Coles did not bear the
surprise so well as I had expected; he dashed the spade upon the
ground with almost ferocious violence, and looking up to me he
said, "All lost, Sir! we are all lost, Sir!" Mr. Smith stood
utterly calm and unmoved; I had not calculated wrongly upon his
courage and firmness. His answer to Coles was, "Nonsense, Coles,
we shall do very well yet; why, there is a cask of salt
provisions and half a cask of flour still left."</p>

<p>I now rallied Coles upon his conduct; compared it with that of
Mr. Smith, and told him that when I had taken him on to the depot
in preference to the other men it had been in the expectation
that, if any disaster had happened, he would, by his coolness and
courage, have given such an example as would have exercised a
salutary influence upon the others. This had the desired effect
upon him; he became perfectly cool and collected and promised to
make light of the misfortune to the rest, and to observe the
strictest discipline. I then requested Mr. Smith to see the
little flour that was left in the barrel and on the rocks
carefully collected by Coles, and, leaving them thus engaged, I
turned back along the sea shore towards the party; glad of the
opportunity of being alone as I could now commune freely with my
own thoughts.</p>

<p>ALARMING POSITION AND PROSPECTS. REPAIR DAMAGES, AND RETURN TO
THE MAIN.</p>

<p>The safety of the whole party now depended upon my forming a
prompt and efficient plan of operations, and seeing it carried
out with energy and perseverance. As soon as I was out of sight
of Mr. Smith and Coles I sat down upon a rock on the shore to
reflect upon our present position. The view seawards was
discouraging; the gale blew fiercely in my face and the spray of
the breakers was dashed over me; nothing could be more gloomy and
drear. I turned inland and could see only a bed of rock, covered
with drifting sand, on which grew a stunted vegetation, and
former experience had taught me that we could not hope to find
water in this island; our position here was therefore untenable,
and but three plans presented themselves to me: first, to leave a
notice of my intentions on the island, then to make for some
known point on the main and there endeavour to subsist ourselves
until we should be found and taken off by the Colonial schooner;
secondly, to start for Timor or Port Essington; thirdly, to try
to make Swan River in the boats.</p>

<p>CONSOLATIONS OF RELIGION.</p>

<p>I determined not to decide hastily between these plans and, in
order more fully to compose my mind, I sat down and read a few
chapters in the Bible.</p>

<p>By the influence these imparted I became perfectly contented
and resigned to our apparently wretched condition and, again
rising up, pursued my way along the beach to the party. It may be
here remarked by some that these statements of my attending to
religious duties are irrelevant to the subject, but in such an
opinion I cannot at all coincide. In detailing the sufferings we
underwent it is necessary to relate the means by which those
sufferings were alleviated; and after having, in the midst of
perils and misfortunes, received the greatest consolation from
religion, I should be ungrateful to my Maker not to acknowledge
this, and should ill perform my duty to my fellow men did I not
bear testimony to the fact that, under all the weightier sorrows
and sufferings that our frail nature is liable to, a perfect
reliance upon the goodness of God and the merits of our Redeemer
will be found a sure refuge and a certain source of
consolation.</p>

<p>In pursuing my route along the beach I carefully examined
every heap of seaweed which the waves had thrown up, and was
fortunate enough to find a bag of flour which had been washed up
by the tide and held there by some rocks; though from daily
soaking in salt water for several weeks it was quite spoilt and
fermented, and smelt like beer; yet this, under present
circumstances, was more valuable than its weight in gold. Just
after I had found this bag, I met Ruston and another man coming
from the boats to the depot; I at once told them exactly how
matters stood; they bore the announcement better than I could
have hoped for, and when I showed them that their safety
altogether depended on their good conduct they promised the most
implicit obedience and a ready cheerful demeanour. I must do
Ruston the justice to say that under every trial he most
scrupulously adhered to the promise he then made, and never
infringed upon it in the slightest degree.</p>

<p>CONDUCT OF THE MEN.</p>

<p>When I reached the party and told the tale of the total
disappearance of all we had left at the depot blank and dismayed
faces met me on all sides. Mr. Walker and Corporal Auger set an
excellent example to the others; but two men, of the names of
Harry and Charley Woods, seized the first convenient opportunity
of walking off to the place where our miserable remnant of damper
was deposited with the intention of appropriating it to
themselves. I only waited till they actually laid their hands
upon it, when I stopped them, placed a sentry over what
provisions were left, ordered a survey of all stores to be held,
and a report to be made to me; and then went off with a party to
search the shore in the hope of finding any other things which
might have been washed up: our search however proved quite
unsuccessful.</p>

<p>CHOICE OF PLANS.</p>

<p>I had warned the men that at sunset I would inform them what
my intentions were with regard to our future movements; and in
the meantime all hands were employed in searching for provisions
or in preparing the boats for sea. A very gloomy prospect was
before us: the men were already much reduced from illness, from
using damaged provisions, and from hard work and exposure
combined: our boats were in a very leaky unsound state, whilst
all means of efficiently repairing them had been swept away in
the hurricane. Add to this that the only provisions we had left
really fit to eat were about nine days' salt meat, at the rate of
a pound a man per diem, and about sixty pounds of tolerably good
flour.</p>

<p>It would be useless to detail the different reasons which
induced me to adopt the plan of endeavouring to make Swan River
in the whale boats; this was however the course I resolved to
pursue. Its principal advantages were that we should be
constantly approaching home; and that if any accident should
happen to the boats we might always hope to reach Perth by
walking: the principal objection to it was the prevalence of
strong south-east winds. At sunset the party assembled. I
detailed to them at considerable length the three most feasible
plans which had offered themselves to me, the reasons which had
made me reject two of them, as well as those which led me to
adopt the third; and as I knew that there were two or three
insubordinate characters amongst the men, whom I had picked up at
Fremantle, I further told them that, if a sufficient number to
man one of the boats objected to follow me, they could go their
own way; as the success of my scheme would altogether depend upon
the courage and subordination with which it was carried out. No
dissentient voice was however raised, but they all promised to
follow me wherever I might lead. We now made arrangements for
searching for turtle during the night, and then stretched
ourselves on the sand to try and sleep.</p>

<p>March 21.</p>

<p>We were unfortunate in not catching a turtle during the night;
the season for them had however now passed away, so that we could
only hope to cut off a stray one which might have lingered behind
its fellows. The next day was occupied in sticking up a steer-oar
with a tin canister attached to it, containing a letter in which
was detailed the plan I intended to follow, so that in the event
of any accident occurring, and our remaining on the coast, we
might still have the chance of a vessel being sent to search for
us. The men were occupied in looking for shellfish, drying the
flour, and preparing the boats. It blew nearly a gale of wind
from the south throughout the day.</p>

<p>RETURN TO THE MAIN.</p>

<p>March 22.</p>

<p>This day at two P.M., all our preparations having been
completed and the wind somewhat moderated, we stood across the
bay, and soon after nightfall made the main about twelve miles to
the north of the northern mouth of the Gascoyne. The wind
freshened a great deal during the night; but as it was impossible
to beach boats on so dangerous a coast in the dark we were
obliged to trust to the goodness of our anchors, and they did not
disappoint us.</p>

<p>March 23.</p>

<p>Before dawn this morning we were under weigh and pulling dead
to windward against a strong breeze and heavy sea; the men rowed
almost without intermission until noon when, finding them
completely exhausted, I made sail and stood in towards the shore.
When we had approached the land about four miles to the north of
the Gascoyne a party of natives came down, without their spears,
in the most friendly manner, making signs to us to land. We had
however but little time to spare, and could not afford to give
them any provisions: knowing also the small dependence that can
be placed upon them in a first interview, I thought it most
prudent to decline their invitation.</p>

<p>COMPLETE OUR WATER.</p>

<p>We accordingly continued our route and in the course of the
evening made the river, where we completed our water, and halted
for the night. We saw nothing more of the natives here, but I
feel convinced that in the event of a settlement being formed at
this point no difficulty would be found in establishing and
maintaining the most friendly relations with them.</p>

<p>ANCHOR TO THE NORTH OF THE GASCOYNE.</p>

<p>March 24.</p>

<p>The morning did not promise very well, but soon after sunrise
the wind shifted so much to the westward that we were able to run
along shore, and in the course of the day we made altogether
about forty-five miles, tracing the greater part of the remaining
unknown portion of the shores of Shark Bay. On leaving the
Gascoyne, a low point bore due south of us, distant about twelve
miles, which I named Point Greenough after George Bellas
Greenough, Esquire, the president of the Royal Geographical
Society; and between this point and the river lay a deep bay, the
shores of which were low and thickly studded with mangroves,
through which many saltwater creeks ran up into the country. Two
of these creeks I had examined on a previous occasion, and
therefore now paid no attention to them.</p>

<p>EXAMINE THE COAST TO THE SOUTHWARD. ITS CHARACTER.</p>

<p>After passing Point Greenough the shore trended south by east
and for the next eight miles preserved its low character, being
still thickly wooded with mangroves; but at this point a
remarkable change takes place as the mangroves suddenly cease,
and the low range of hills which extends southward along the
coast parallel to the shore increases a little in height. In
about another mile the mangroves again commence, the coast now
trending south-east; and about five miles further it runs
south-east by east, forming a bay about four miles deep, the
bottom of which is tolerably clear of mangroves.</p>

<p>CONTINUE OUR COURSE TO THE SOUTHWARD.</p>

<p>Having crossed this bay we ran south-east by south parallel to
the shore; the mangroves now became less continuous and numerous,
at least they appeared to us to be so, and the range of hills
seemed also to approach much nearer to the sea. We continued on
this course until sunset, when I selected a snug little bay in
the mangroves, where we anchored at the distance of a few yards
from the shore and made ourselves as comfortable as we could for
the night.</p>

<p>CHARACTER OF THE COAST AND SEA.</p>

<p>There was great beauty in the scenery which we saw during the
day's sail; the waters and the sky had that peculiar brilliancy
about them which is only seen in fine weather and in a tropical
climate. To the west of us lay an apparently boundless expanse of
sea, whilst to the eastward we had a low shore fringed with
trees, not only down to the water's edge but forming little green
knolls of foliage in the ocean itself; behind these trees lay low
wooded hills, and in front of them stalked and swam about
pelicans and waterfowl in countless numbers. We had only about
three feet depth of clear transparent water, through which we saw
that the flats beneath us were covered with vivid coloured shells
of many genera, some of which were of a very large size;
strange-looking fish of a variety of kinds were also sporting
about; more particularly sharks of a new species (of that kind
which I shot at in mistake for an alligator) and stingrays.
Whenever a lull occurred the men, unable to resist the chance of
getting a meal, would jump out of the boat, and give chase to one
of these sting-rays, boat-hook in hand, and then loud peals of
laughter rose from the others as the pursuer, too anxious to
attain his object, missed his stroke or, stumbling, rolled
headlong in the water. The fineness of the day, the novelty of
the scenery, and the rapid way we were making made the poor
fellows forget past dangers, as well as those they had yet to
undergo. My own meditations were of a more melancholy character,
for I feared that the days of some of the light-hearted group
were already numbered and would soon be brought to a close.
Amidst such scenes and thoughts we were swept along, whilst this
unknown coast, which so many had anxiously yet vainly wished to
see, passed before our eyes like a panorama or a dream, and, ere
many years have hurried by it is probable that the recollection
of this day will be as such to me.</p>

<p>BOAT LEFT AGROUND BY THE TIDE.</p>

<p>March 25.</p>

<p>This morning I was up early in order that we might lose no
time in getting under weigh; I was much surprised however to find
both boats aground, and when the day had dawned sufficiently to
enable me to distinguish surrounding objects I could not make out
the sea, but found that we were lodged in a regular mangrove
bush. I walked a few yards to get a clear view to the westward
and found that we were at least a mile inland, so far does the
tide run in over this low level shore. My eyes were so sore that
I could scarcely see and I therefore did not attempt to make an
excursion into the country, but sent a party for this purpose,
who ascended the first low range of hills and reported that the
country as far as they could see to the eastward was a succession
of low mud flats subject to the overflowings of the sea. There
was a promising-looking creek immediately to the south of us.</p>

<p>The tide came very slowly in until ten o'clock, which was
about the time of high-water: but here it had only half risen and
remained stationary for some time, when it began to ebb again,
but soon meeting the second flood, now came pouring rapidly in,
and just before sunset there was water enough for us to get off.
We pulled to a low point, distant about two miles, and which bore
south by east from us; and having anchored off this waited for
the morning dawn to pursue our voyage.</p>

<p>CONTINUE A SOUTHERLY COURSE.</p>

<p>March 26.</p>

<p>In the morning I found that the point we were anchored off ran
south-east and north-west: it was about two miles long and formed
a low spit of land whence the coast trended due south. I debated
for a few minutes whether I should explore the creek which lay to
the south of us, but decided in the negative. Had I followed my
own wishes I should have done so, but the lives of others now
depended on my incurring no unjustifiable delay, and it did not
therefore appear to be of importance; besides, as we had now
traced the unknown portions of this great bay, and had moreover
discovered in it a country in every way fitted for immediate
occupation, and which indeed appeared from its soil and position
to be one of the most valuable portions of the western side of
the Continent, I thought that everything worthy of any great risk
or danger had been accomplished, and resolved to hurry
homewards.</p>

<p>STEER FROM THE MAIN.</p>

<p>After following the coast for a few miles further to the south
I considered we were now far enough to windward to fetch
somewhere near the centre of Perron's Peninsula; I therefore made
sail and steered for that point.</p>

<p>ANOTHER GALE OF WIND.</p>

<p>Our passage across was a long and tedious one, and when at
last towards evening we sighted Perron's Peninsula it was very
evident that my boat would not do more than fetch the very
northern point, but the other boat, which was a much better
sailer, was nearly a mile to windward of us. The weather had been
for the last hour or two very threatening, and we had reached to
within two miles of the shore when the wind suddenly shifted to
the south-west and began to blow a terrific gale. We had just
time to down sail and take to the oars, and as every one of the
crew saw that his life depended on it they gave way strenuously.
We were under the lee of the Peninsula and had it not been for
this circumstance must undoubtedly have been lost. That gale of
wind was a terrible and magnificent sight. I stood at the steer
oar; the waves lifted the boat each time nearly broadside on, and
it was all I could do to bring her head round in time to meet the
next sea, but the men pulled steadily. "Now men, give way for
your lives," I called out if they flagged, and renewed energy was
instantly infused into all of them. At times we could not hold
our own against the wind and waves, and at the most favourable
moments seemed merely to stand still. I looked at the shore until
my eyes ached; but no nearer did it appear to be than at first,
and gradually grew less distinct as the daylight faded. We could
only see the other boat now and then; but although she was
evidently in imminent peril they were much nearer in shore than
we were. The danger we underwent on this occasion was great; but
the excitement of so wild and grand a scene was highly
pleasurable, and when success at last crowned our exertions, and
we went dancing wildly in through the surf and spray upon a rocky
unknown shore, and found the other crew on the beach ready to
help us in hauling up, I felt that there is a charm attached to
scenes like these which can only be fully estimated by those who
have experienced it. Having in our turn assisted to haul up the
other boat we lighted our fires and laid down for the night.</p>

<p>PERRON'S PENINSULA.</p>

<p>March 27.</p>

<p>This morning I found that all our hands were so fatigued by
the exertions of the previous day that a few hours of comparative
rest was absolutely necessary. I therefore directed them to
stroll about the beach for an hour or two and to collect oysters
or shellfish. The part of Perron's Peninsula which we were on
consists of abrupt cliffs of the height of about two hundred
feet; at the base of these and between them and the sea there is
a narrow strip of sandy land and dunes, and at their summit is a
barren sandy tableland, gently sloping away to the southward and
appearing to extend throughout the whole length of the
peninsula.</p>

<p>As soon as I thought the men were sufficiently rested we
launched the boats, but on rounding the northern extremity of the
peninsula met a heavy sea running from the southward and were
obliged to take to the oars. We had not got more than two miles
to the southward of Cape Leseuer when I saw so many indications
of an approaching gale that I ran in again and beached the boats;
and this operation was hardly accomplished ere it blew with
terrific violence from the south-south-west. Both here and at our
last night's encampment we saw numerous signs of natives, and now
found several native wells in the sandhills, but had no occasion
to use them as we had regular tropical rain for the rest of the
day. The men here brought me the bones of a very large marine
animal which they had found at the natives' fire, but I could not
recognise them as belonging to any that I was acquainted with. At
this period, from bad food and being constantly wet with salt
water, we were all afflicted with sores of the most painful and
annoying character, and these much increased the unpleasantness
of our situation.</p>

<p>ANOTHER GALE.</p>

<p>March 28.</p>

<p>This morning the weather looked tolerably fine; I therefore
ordered the boats to be launched and, after pulling a few miles
to windward along Perron's Peninsula, we struck across for Dirk
Hartog's Island; our former ill-luck however still attended us,
for just as we were making the land another fearful gale from the
south-south-west came on, and had we not had the good luck to
have got under the lee of the Coin de Mire of the French we must
infallibly have been wrecked; as it was we pulled along under
this promontory and beached the boats in a little bay at its
north-west extremity. Nothing but absolute necessity could
however have induced me to take such a step, for the place was
rocky and difficult of access, with a heavy surf breaking on the
beach. The rain fell in torrents during the greater part of the
evening, and the men spent the time in searching for oysters and
shellfish with which to appease their hunger. The rain which had
fallen during the last two days had a very injurious effect upon
some of us, for, our clothes having been lost with the other
things which were swept away from the depot during the hurricane
of the first of March, we were very insufficiently clad.</p>

<p>DIRK HARTOG'S ISLAND.</p>

<p>March 29.</p>

<p>The weather this morning being very foul I occupied myself in
making a survey of a portion of Dirk Hartog's Island, which is of
a very barren nature, though rather better than either Bernier or
Dorre Islands, but for many years to come it must be utterly
useless. It looks exactly like a Scottish heath; and I have no
doubt whatever that water would be found by digging on it; but as
we could have obtained plenty from large holes in the rocks we
did not make the attempt. Whilst I was occupied in this
examination of the island the wind shifted suddenly to the
north-west and I hurried back to the party in order not to lose
so favourable an opportunity.</p>

<p>On arriving at the boats I found that the water had not been
completed, nor had three days' provisions (such as they were)
been cooked, although I had left orders when I went away that
these necessary preparations for our moving should immediately be
made; this gave me another reason to suspect that, during my
temporary absence from the party, discipline was now altogether
neglected, and indeed treated as an unnecessary restraint under
existing circumstances. Mr. Smith had warned me that such was the
case, and I therefore never separated myself from any portion of
the party without great anxiety; for I well knew that the safety
of all depended upon preserving the strictest subordination.</p>

<p>In this instance however I merely ordered the boats to be
instantly launched; for I knew that to lose a fair wind in our
present situation would be rashness; and we were soon bounding
before the breeze. The wind now continued fair and at nightfall
we landed on the main in such a position as to look out to the
open sea, through the passage between Steep Point and Dirk
Hartog's Island.</p>

<p>PERILOUS COASTING.</p>

<p>March 30.</p>

<p>This morning we pulled up the opening and found a perfect
bubble of a sea running into it and breaking on the various reefs
which lie in its mouth. We then made an attempt to pull round
Steep Point and succeeded in getting out to sea; but there was a
formidable swell setting dead on the shore and drifting us
rapidly in towards it, whilst in the event of being stranded
nothing could have saved our lives for the surf was so tremendous
that the boat must instantly have gone to pieces, and the lofty
limestone cliffs were perfectly inaccessible, being hollowed out
into deep caverns by the action of the waves. The attempt to get
along this coast appeared indeed to be so hazardous that even the
old sailors who were with me begged me not to risk it, but rather
to allow them to endeavour to walk overland to Perth. I was well
aware that had I attempted to do this at least half the party
would have been lost; for but few men can support the fatigue of
making long and continuous marches in a very warm climate in
which a great scarcity of water prevails.</p>

<p>SHELTER UNDER A REEF.</p>

<p>I however humoured them so far as to put back for the mouth of
the opening, where, under the shelter of a reef, we could lie at
anchor for a few hours in the hope that the sea would lull a
little; we however only just cleared Steep Point, and whilst
doing so I felt certain for two or three minutes that we must
have gone ashore, for each breaker lifted the boat bodily towards
the cliffs; as it was however it pleased Providence to bring us
safe to our anchorage.</p>

<p>We were now about to enter on the most perilous part of our
journey homewards. For the next one hundred and twenty miles
along the coast I could not hope to find a place whereon to beach
the boats, in the event of our meeting with those unfavourable
winds which we had hitherto found so prevalent. It would, in the
present weak state of the party, take us many successive days to
make this passage; and, should the weather be really foul,
accompanied by strong gales from the south-west, our fate would
soon have been decided. Nevertheless our hope of ultimate safety
rested altogether upon the accomplishment of the difficult task
we were about to commence.</p>

<p>INSUBORDINATION CHECKED.</p>

<p>I soon found that remaining in a state of inactivity would but
increase our difficulties; for as the men talked over them to one
another, they grew wore and more gloomy, and when at length I
gave a particular order to a man of the name of Woods he quietly
refused to obey it, saying that he now considered that his life
was altogether lost, and that he would therefore knock off work.
I was rather puzzled for a minute or two as to how I ought to act
under these circumstances, for such an example as he had set
necessarily exercised a bad influence over the others; yet there
was no use in threatening to punish where I had not the means to
do so; I therefore merely turned round to the man who had the
charge of sharing out our scanty allowance of provisions and
desired him to divide Woods' portion of water and provisions
amongst the rest of us today, as I intended for the future that
he should have none, at all events not until he did his fair
share of work. This had the desired effect; he soon came to his
senses and told me that I might as well throw him overboard at
once as starve him, to which I replied that unless he overcame
his cowardice and bore his proportion of the toil we all had to
go through I should in no way whatever interfere with his
starving, being thrown overboard, or anything else; but that I
would take very good care that he had neither a morsel to eat or
a drop of water to drink; whereupon he again resumed his duty and
from that time forward proved to be one of the best men I had
with me; indeed I never again had occasion to find fault with
him.</p>

<p>Seeing however what a pernicious effect this delay was likely
to produce I determined at once to cope with those difficulties,
which we must either overcome or perish; and accordingly round
Steep Point we again went, and for the rest of this evening and
night contended with the heavy sea as well as we could, keeping
about a mile from the shore, sometimes pulling and sometimes
getting a favourable slant of wind.</p>

<p>March 31.</p>

<p>This day we continued our course, tracing out the shore. A
small piece of raw pork was served out to each man; and I found
this to be a very nice and palatable morsel; it however increased
our thirst, which, as we were upon very short allowance of water,
was rather a disadvantage; but it was absolutely necessary that
we should take some nourishment.</p>

<p>CHARACTER OF THE SHORE.</p>

<p>The country hereabouts is very uninviting, consisting of a
high range of barren limestone hills, ascending gradually from
steep cliffs which form the coastline. These hills are of such
equal elevation that they have a monotonous as well as barren
appearance, and are rent in places by deep rocky gullies which
run down into the sea. No change whatever took place in the
character of the coast throughout our day's ruin, nor did I see a
spot where a boat could land. I did not close my eyes during
Sunday night, for we were still in a most perilous position, and
I felt that whilst we were on so dangerous a coast with a foul
wind it was my duty to keep upon the alert as long as wearied
nature would admit of my so doing.</p>

<p>As soon as there was sufficient light for me to distinguish
the coastline I found that it was somewhat losing its monotonous
character by breaking into more detached hills; and about ten
A.M., we reached the northern extremity of Gantheaume Bay.</p>

<p>TO GANTHEAUME BAY.</p>

<p>The men being now completely worn out by want of rest,
incessant exertion, and the mental anxiety they had undergone in
the last fifty-six hours, during the whole of which time they had
been in actual danger, I determined to attempt a landing in
Gantheaume Bay, and therefore pulled along shore with the
intention of finding a spot where we could easily land and yet be
near a place likely to afford us water; for notwithstanding the
economy we had practised none now was left. I soon came to an
opening in the bay which I thought would suit our purpose, but
Ruston, on whose opinion in such matters I placed great reliance,
reported it to be utterly impracticable; we still therefore
pulled along the shore, and found it lashed throughout its whole
extent by a fearful surf. The south end of the bay, although
protected by a reef, had just as heavy a surf breaking on it as
any other part of the shore and was also very rocky, we therefore
turned back to a sandy beach which we had passed in pulling round
the bay and, having carefully examined this, it appeared in every
way suited to our purpose, so we committed ourselves to the mercy
of the breakers and in we went. As I stood at the steer-oar I saw
that this was a heavier surf than we had ever yet been in. We
were swept along at a terrific rate, and yet it appeared as if
each following wave must engulf us, so lofty were they, and so
rapidly did they pour on.</p>

<p>WRECK OF ONE OF THE BOATS.</p>

<p>At length we reached the point where the waves broke; the
breaker that we were on curled up in the air, lifting the boat
with it, and when we had gained the summit I looked down from a
great height, not upon water, but upon a bare, sharp, black rock.
For one second the boat hung upon the top of the wave; in the
next I felt the sensation of falling rapidly, then a tremendous
shock and crash which jerked me away amongst rocks and breakers,
and for the few following seconds I heard nothing but the din of
waves whilst I was rolling about amongst men, and a torn boat,
