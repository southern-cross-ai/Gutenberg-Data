  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Preface"></a>Preface</b></h2>
  <p>Damocles,  one of the courtiers of Dionysius, was perpetually extolling with rapture that  tyrant&rsquo;s treasures, grandeur, the number of his troops, the extent of his  dominions, the magnificence of his palaces, and the universal abundance of all  good things and enjoyments in his possession; always repeating, that never man  was happier than Dionysius. &ldquo;Since you are of that opinion,&rdquo; said the tyrant to  him one day, &ldquo;will you taste and make proof of my felicity in person?&rdquo; The  offer was accepted with joy; Damocles was placed upon a golden couch, covered  with carpets richly embroidered. The side-boards were loaded with vessels of  gold and silver. The most beautiful slaves in the most splendid habits stood  around, ready to serve him at the slightest signal. The most exquisite essences  and perfumes had not been spared. The table was spread with proportionate  magnificence. Damocles was all joy, and looked upon himself as the happiest man  in the world; when unfortunately casting up his eyes, he beheld over his head  the point of a sword, which hung from the roof only by a single horse-hair.</p>

    A Wanderer</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  no such word.&rdquo;&mdash;BULWER.</p>
  <p>A  wind was blowing through the city. Not a gentle and balmy zephyr, stirring the  locks on gentle ladies&rsquo; foreheads and rustling the curtains in elegant  boudoirs, but a chill and bitter gale that rushed with a swoop through narrow  alleys and forsaken courtyards, biting the cheeks of the few solitary wanderers  that still lingered abroad in the darkened streets.</p>
  <p>In  front of a cathedral that reared its lofty steeple in the midst of the squalid  houses and worse than squalid saloons of one of the dreariest portions of the  East Side, stood the form of a woman. She had paused in her rush down the  narrow street to listen to the music, perhaps, or to catch a glimpse of the  light that now and then burst from the widely swinging doors as they opened and  shut upon some tardy worshipper.</p>
  <p>She  was tall and fearful looking; her face, when the light struck it, was seared  and desperate; gloom and desolation were written on all the lines of her rigid  but wasted form, and when she shuddered under the gale, it was with that force  and abandon to which passion lends its aid, and in which the soul proclaims its  doom.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  the doors before her swung wide and the preacher&rsquo;s voice was heard: &ldquo;Love God  and you will love your fellow-men. Love your fellow-men and you best show your  love to God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  heard, started, and the charm was broken. &ldquo;Love!&rdquo; she echoed with a horrible  laugh; &ldquo;there is no love in heaven or on earth!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  she swept by, and the winds followed and the darkness swallowed her up like a  gulf.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
    A Discussion</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Young  men think old men fools, and old men know young men to be so.&rdquo;&mdash;Ray&rsquo;s Proverbs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you are actually in earnest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  first speaker, a fine-looking gentleman of some forty years of age, drummed  with his fingers on the table before him and eyed the face of the young man who  had repeated this assent so emphatically, with a certain close scrutiny  indicative of surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is an unlooked-for move for you to make,&rdquo; he remarked at length. &ldquo;Your success  as a pianist has been so decided, I confess I do not understand why you should  desire to abandon a profession that in five years&rsquo; time has procured you both  competence and a very enviable reputation&mdash;for the doubtful prospects of Wall  Street, too!&rdquo; he added with a deep and thoughtful frown that gave still further  impressiveness to his strongly marked features.</p>
  <p>The  young man with a sweep of his eye over the luxurious apartment in which they  sat, shrugged his shoulders with that fine and nonchalant grace which was one  of his chief characteristics.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  such a pilot as yourself, I ought to be able to steer clear of the shoals,&rdquo;  said he, a frank smile illumining a face that was rather interesting than  handsome.</p>
  <p>The  elder gentleman did not return the smile. Instead of that he remained gazing at  the ample coal-fire that burned in the grate before him with a look that to the  young musician was simply inexplicable. &ldquo;You see the ship in haven,&rdquo; he  murmured at last; &ldquo;but do not consider what storms it has weathered or what  perils escaped. It is a voyage I would encourage no son of mine to undertake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  you are not the man to shrink from danger or to hesitate in a course you had  marked out for yourself, because of the struggle it involved or the  difficulties it presented!&rdquo; the young man exclaimed almost involuntarily as his  glance lingered with a certain sort of fascination on the powerful brow and  steady if somewhat melancholy eye of his companion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  but danger and difficulty should not be sought, only subdued when encountered.  If you were driven into this path, I should say, &lsquo;God pity you!&rsquo; and hold you  out my hand to steady you along its precipices and above its sudden quicksands.  But you are not driven to it. Your profession offers you the means of an ample  livelihood while your good heart and fair talents insure you ultimate and  honorable success, both in the social and artistic world. For a man of  twenty-five such prospects are not common and he must be difficult to please  not to be satisfied with them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said the other rising with a fitful movement but instantly sitting again; &ldquo;I  have nothing to complain of as the world goes, only&mdash;Sir,&rdquo; he exclaimed with a  sudden determination that lent a force to his features they had hitherto  lacked, &ldquo;you speak of being driven into a certain course; what do you mean by  that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean,&rdquo; returned the other; &ldquo;forced by circumstances to enter a line of business  to which many others, if not all others are preferable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  speak strongly, speculation evidently has none of your sympathy, notwithstanding  the favorable results which have accrued to you from it. But excuse me, by  circumstances you mean poverty, I suppose, and the lack of every other opening  to wealth and position. You would not consider the desire to make a large  fortune in a short space of time a circumstance of a sufficiently determining  nature to reconcile you to my entering Wall Street speculation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  elder gentleman rose, not as the other had done with a restless impulse quickly  subsiding at the first excuse, but forcibly and with a feverish impatience that  to appearance was somewhat out of proportion to the occasion. &ldquo;A large fortune  in a short space of time!&rdquo; he reiterated, pausing where he had risen with an  eagle glance at his companion and a ringing tone in his voice that bespoke a  deep but hitherto suppressed agitation. &ldquo;It is the alluring inscription above  the pitfall into which many a noble youth has fallen; the battle-cry to a  struggle that has led many a strong man the way of ruin; the guide-post to a  life whose feverish days and sleepless nights offer but poor compensation for  the sudden splendors and as sudden reverses attached to it. I had rather you  had accounted for this sudden freak of yours by the strongest aspiration after  power than by this cry of the merely mercenary man who in his desire to enjoy  wealth, prefers to win it by a stroke of luck rather than conquer it by a life  of endeavor.&rdquo; He stopped. &ldquo;I am aware that this tirade against the ladder by  which I myself have risen so rapidly, must strike you as in ill-taste. But  Bertram, I am interested in your welfare and am willing to incur some slight  charge of inconsistency in order to insure it,&rdquo; and here he turned upon his  companion with that expression of extreme gentleness which lent such a peculiar  charm to his countenance and explained perhaps the almost unlimited power he  held over the hearts and minds of those who came within the circle of his  influence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are very good, sir,&rdquo; murmured his young friend, who to explain matters at once  was in reality the nephew of this Wall Street magnate, though from the fact of  his having taken another name on entering the musical profession, was not  generally known as such. &ldquo;No one, not even my father himself, could have been  more considerate and kind; but I do not think you understand me, or rather I  should say I do not think I have made myself perfectly intelligible to you. It  is not for the sake of wealth itself or the eclat attending its possession that  I desire an immediate fortune, but that by means of it I may attain another  object dearer than wealth, and more precious than my career.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  elder gentleman turned quickly, evidently much surprised, and cast a sudden  inquiring glance at his nephew, who blushed with a modest ingenuousness  pleasing to see in one so well accustomed to the critical gaze of his  fellow-men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said he, as if in answer to that look, &ldquo;I am in love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  deep silence for a moment pervaded the apartment, a sombre silence almost  startling to young Mandeville, who had expected some audible expression to  follow this announcement if only the good-natured &ldquo;Pooh! pooh!&rdquo; of the matured  man of the world in the presence of ardent youthful enthusiasm. What could it  mean? Looking up he encountered his uncle&rsquo;s eye fixed upon him with the last  expression he could have anticipated seeing there, namely that of actual and  unmistakable alarm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are displeased,&rdquo; Mandeville exclaimed. &ldquo;You have thought me proof against such  a passion, or perhaps you do not believe in the passion itself!&rdquo; Then with a  sudden remembrance of the notable if somewhat indolent loveliness of his uncle&rsquo;s  wife, blushed again at his unusual want of tact, while his eye with an  involuntary impulse sought the large panel at their right where, in the full  bloom of her first youth, the lady of the house smiled upon all beholders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not believe in that passion influencing a man&rsquo;s career,&rdquo; his uncle replied  with no apparent attention to the other&rsquo;s embarrassment. &ldquo;A woman needs be  possessed of uncommon excellences to justify a man in leaving a path where  success is certain, for one where it is not only doubtful but if attained must  bring many a regret and heart-ache in its train. Beauty is not sufficient,&rdquo; he  went on with sterner and sterner significance, &ldquo;though it were of an angelic  order. There must be worth.&rdquo; And here his mind&rsquo;s eye if not that of his bodily  sense, certainly followed the glance of his companion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe there is worth,&rdquo; the young man replied; &ldquo;certainly, it is not her  beauty that charms me. I do not even know if she <i>is</i> beautiful,&rdquo; he  continued.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you believe you love!&rdquo; the elder exclaimed after another short pause.</p>
  <p>There  was so much of bitterness in the tone in which this was uttered, that  Mandeville forgot its incredulity. &ldquo;I think I must,&rdquo; returned he with a certain  masculine na&iuml;vet&eacute; not out of keeping with his general style of face and manner,  &ldquo;else I should not be here. Three weeks ago I was satisfied with my profession,  if not enthusiastic over it; to-day I ask nothing but to be allowed to enter  upon some business that in three years&rsquo; time at least will place me where I can  be the fit mate of any woman in this land, that is not worth her millions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  woman for whom you have conceived this violent attachment is, then, above you  in social position?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir, or so considered, which amounts to the same thing, as far as I am  concerned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertram,  I have lived longer than you and have seen much of both social and domestic  life, and I tell you no woman is worth such a sacrifice on the part of a man as  you propose. No woman of to-day, I should say; our mothers were different. The  very fact that this young lady of whom you speak, obliges you to change your  whole course of life in order to obtain her, ought to be sufficient to prove to  you&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped suddenly, arrested by the young man&rsquo;s lifted hand. &ldquo;She does  not oblige you, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  on her own account, sir. This lily,&rdquo; lifting a vase of blossoms at his elbow, &ldquo;could  not be more innocent of the necessities that govern the social circle it  adorns, than the pure, single-minded girl to whom I have dedicated what is best  and noblest in my manhood. It is her father&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  her father!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; the young man pursued, more and more astonished at the other&rsquo;s tone. &ldquo;He  is a man who has a right to expect both wealth and position in a son-in-law.  But I see I shall have to tell you my story, sir. It is an uncommon one and I  never meant that it should pass my lips, but if by its relation I can win your  sympathy for a pure and noble passion, I shall consider the sacred seal of  secrecy broken in a good cause. But,&rdquo; said he, seeing his uncle cast a short  and uneasy glance at the door, &ldquo;perhaps I am interrupting you. You expect some  one!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said his uncle, &ldquo;my wife is at church; I am ready to listen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man gave a hurried sigh, cast one look at his companion&rsquo;s immovable face,  as if to assure himself that the narrative was necessary, then leaned back and  in a steady business-like tone that softened, however, as he proceeded, began  to relate as follows:</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
    A Mysterious Summons</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Without  unspotted, innocent within,<br>
  She feared no danger, for she knew no sin.&rdquo;&mdash;Dryden. </p>
  <p>It  was after a matin&eacute;e performance at &mdash; Hall some two weeks ago that I stopped to  light a cigar in the small corridor leading to the back entrance. I was in a dissatisfied  frame of mind. Something in the music I had been playing or the manner in which  it had been received had touched unwonted chords in my own nature. I felt  alone. I remember asking myself as I stood there, what it all amounted to? Who  of all the applauding crowd would watch at my bedside through a long and  harassing sickness, or lend their sympathy as they now yielded their praise, if  instead of carrying off the honors of the day I had failed to do justice to my  reputation. I was just smiling over the only exception I could make to this  sweeping assertion, that of the pale-eyed youth you have sometimes observed  dogging my steps, when Briggs came up to me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is a woman here, sir, who insists on seeing you; she has been waiting through  half the last piece. Shall I tell her you are coming out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  woman!&rdquo; exclaimed I, somewhat surprised, for my visitors are not apt to be of  the gentler sex.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  sir, an old one. She seems very anxious to speak to you. I could not get rid of  her no how.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  hurried forward to the muffled figure which he pointed out cowering against the  wall by the door. &ldquo;Well, my good woman, what do you want?&rdquo; I asked, bending  towards her in the hopes of catching a glimpse of the face she held partly  concealed from me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you Mr. Mandeville?&rdquo; she inquired in a tone shaken as much by agitation as age.</p>
  <p>I  bowed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  one who plays upon the piano?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  very same,&rdquo; I declared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are not deceiving me,&rdquo; she went on, looking up with a marked anxiety plainly  visible through her veil. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you play and couldn&rsquo;t contradict you,  but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo;  said I calling to Briggs with a kindly look at the old woman, &ldquo;help me on with  my coat, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  &ldquo;Certainly, Mr. Mandeville,&rdquo; with which he complied seemed to reassure her, and  as soon as the coat was on and he was gone, she grasped me by the arm and drew  my ear down to her mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you are Mr. Mandeville, I have a message for you. This letter,&rdquo; slipping one  into my hand, &ldquo;is from a young lady, sir. She bade me give it to you myself. She  is young and pretty,&rdquo; she pursued as she saw me make a movement of distaste, &ldquo;and  a lady. We depend upon your honor, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  acknowledge that my first impulse was to fling her back the note and leave the  building; I was in no mood for trifling, my next to burst into a laugh and  politely hand her to the door, my last and best, to open the poor little note  and see for myself whether the writer was a lady or not. Proceeding to the  door, for it was already twilight in the dim passage way, I tore open the envelope  which was dainty enough and took out a sheet of closely written paper. A  certain qualm of conscience assailed me as I saw the delicate chirography it  disclosed and I was tempted to thrust it back and return it unread to the old  woman now trembling in the corner. But curiosity overcame my scruples, and  hastily unfolding the sheet I read these lines:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know if what I do is right; I am sure aunty would not say it was; but  aunty never thinks anything is right but going to church and reading the papers  to papa. I am just a little girl who has heard you play, and who would think  the world was too beautiful, if she could hear you say to her just once, some  of the kind things you must speak every day to the persons who know you. I do  not expect very much&mdash;you must have a great many friends, and you would not care  for me&mdash;but the least little look, if it were all my own, would make me so happy  and so proud I should not envy anybody in the world, unless it was some of  those dear friends who see you always.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not come and hear you play often, for aunty thinks music frivolous, but I am  always hearing you no matter where I am, and it makes me feel as if I were far  away from everybody, in a beautiful land all sunshine and flowers. But nurse  says I must not write so much or you will not read it, so I will stop here. But  if you <i>would</i> come it would make some one happier than even your  beautiful music could do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That  was all; there was neither name nor date. A child&rsquo;s epistle, written with a  woman&rsquo;s circumspection. With mingled sensations of doubt and curiosity I turned  back to the old woman who stood awaiting me with eager anxiety.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  this written by a child or woman?&rdquo; I asked, meeting her eye with as much  sternness as I could assume.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  ask me&mdash;don&rsquo;t ask me anything. I have promised to bring you if I could, but I  cannot answer any questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  stepped back with an incredulous laugh. Here was evidently an adventure. &ldquo;You  will at least tell me where the young miss lives,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;before I undertake  to fulfil her request.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  shook her head. &ldquo;I have a carriage at the door, sir,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;All you have  got to do is to get into it with me and we shall soon be at the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  looked from her face to the letter in my hand, and knew not what to think. The  spirit of simplicity and ingenuousness that marked the latter was scarcely in  keeping with this air of mystery. The woman observing my hesitation moved  towards the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you come, sir?&rdquo; she inquired. &ldquo;You will not regret it. Just a moment&rsquo;s talk  with a pretty young girl&mdash;surely&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo;  said I, hearing a hasty step behind me. And sure enough just then my intimate  friend Selby came along and grasping me by the arm began dragging me towards  the door. &ldquo;You are my property,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve promised, on my word of honor  as a gentleman and a musician, to bring you to the Handel Club this afternoon.  I was afraid you had escaped me, but&mdash;&rdquo; Here he caught sight of the small black  figure halting in the door-way, and paused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s  this?&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>I  hesitated. For one instant the scale of my whole future destiny hung trembling  in the balance, then the demon of curiosity got the better of my judgment, and  with the rather unworthy consideration that I might as well enjoy my youth  while I could, I released myself from my friend&rsquo;s detaining hand and replied, &ldquo;Some  one with whom I have very particular business. I cannot go to the Handel Club  to-day,&rdquo; and darting out without further delay, I rejoined the old woman on the  sidewalk.</p>
  <p>Without  a word she drew me towards a carriage I now observed standing by the curbstone  a few feet to the left. As I got in I remember pausing a moment to glance at  the man on the box, but it was too dark for me to perceive anything but the  fact that he was dressed in livery. More and more astonished I leaned back in  my seat and endeavored to open conversation with my mysterious companion. But  it did not work. Without being actually rude, she parried my questions in such  a way that by the end of five minutes I found myself as far from any knowledge  of the real situation of the case as when I started. I therefore desisted from  any further attempts and turned to look out, when I made a discovery that for  the first time awoke some vague feelings of alarm within my breast. This was,  that the window was not covered by a curtain as I supposed, but by closed  blinds which when I tried to raise them resisted all my efforts to do so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is very close here,&rdquo; I muttered, in some sort of excuse for this display of  uneasiness. &ldquo;Cannot you give us a little air?&rdquo; But my companion remained  silent, and I felt ashamed to press the matter though I took advantage of the  darkness to remove to a safer place a roll of money which I had about me.</p>
  <p>Yet  I was far from being really anxious, and did not once meditate backing out of  an adventure that was at once so piquant and romantic. For by this time I  became conscious from the sounds about me that we had left the side street for  one of the avenues and were then proceeding rapidly up town. Listening, I heard  the roll of omnibuses and the jingle of car-bells, which informed me that we  were in Broadway, no other avenue in the city being traversed by both these  methods of conveyance. But after awhile the jingle ceased and presently the  livelier sounds of constant commotion inseparable from a business thoroughfare,  and we entered what I took to be Madison Avenue at Twenty-third Street.</p>
  <p>Instantly  I made up mind to notice every turn of the carriage, that I might fix to some  degree the locality towards which we were tending. But it turned but once and  that after a distance of steady travelling that quite overthrew any calculation  I was able to make at that time of the probable number of streets we had passed  since entering the avenue. Having turned, it went but about half a block to the  left when it stopped. &ldquo;I shall see where I am when I get out,&rdquo; thought I; but  in this I was mistaken.</p>
  <p>First  we had stopped in the middle of a block of houses built, as far as I could  judge, all after one model. Next the fact of the front door being open, though  I saw no one in the hall, somewhat disconcerted me, and I hurried across the  sidewalk and up the stoop in a species of maze hardly to be expected from one  of my naturally careless disposition. The next moment the door closed behind me  and I found myself in a well-lighted hall whose quiet richness betokened it as  belonging to a private dwelling of no mean pretensions to elegance.</p>
  <p>This  was the first surprise I received.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Follow  me,&rdquo; said the old woman, hurrying me down the hall and into a small room at the  end. &ldquo;The young lady will be here in a moment,&rdquo; and without lifting her veil or  affording me the least glimpse of her features, she retired, leaving me to face  the situation before me as best I might.</p>
  <p>It  was anything but a pleasant one as it appeared to me at that moment, and for an  instant I seriously thought of retracing my steps and leaving a domicile into  which I had been introduced in such a mysterious manner. Then the quiet aspect  of the room, which though sparsely furnished with a piano and chairs was still  of an order rarely seen out of gentlemen&rsquo;s houses, struck my imagination and  reawakened my curiosity, and nerving myself to meet whatever interview might be  accorded me, I waited. It was only five minutes by the small clock ticking on  the mantel-piece, but it seemed an hour before I heard a timid step at the  door, and saw it swing slowly open, disclosing&mdash;well, I did not stop to inquire  whether it was a child or a woman. I merely saw the shrinking modest form, the  eager blushing face, and bowed almost to the ground in a sudden reverence for  the sublime innocence revealed to me. Yes, it did not take a second look to  read that tender countenance to its last guileless page. Had she been a woman  of twenty-five I could not have mistaken her expression of pure delight and  timid interest, but she was only sixteen, as I afterwards learned, and younger  in experience than in age.</p>
  <p>Closing  the door behind her, she stood for a moment without speaking, then with a  deepening of the blush which was only a child&rsquo;s embarrassment in the presence  of a stranger, looked up and murmured my name with a word or so of grateful  acknowledgment that would have called forth a smile on my lips if I had not  been startled by the sudden change that passed over her features when she met my  eyes. Was it that I showed my surprise too plainly, or did my admiration  manifest itself in my gaze? an admiration great as it was humble, and which was  already of a nature such as I had never before given to girl or woman. Whatever  it was, she no sooner met my look than she paused, trembled, and started back  with a confused murmur, through which I plainly heard her whisper in a low  distressed tone, &ldquo;Oh, what have I done!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Called  a good friend to your side,&rdquo; said I in the frank, brotherly way I thought most  likely to reassure her. &ldquo;Do not be alarmed, I am only too happy to meet one who  evidently enjoys music so well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the hidden chord of womanhood had been struck in the child&rsquo;s soul, and she  could not recover herself. For an instant I thought she would turn and flee,  and struck as I was with remorse at my reckless invasion of this uncontaminated  temple, I could not but admire the spirited picture she presented as, with form  half turned and face bent back, she stood hesitating on the point of flight.</p>
  <p>I  did not try to stop her. &ldquo;She shall follow her own impulse,&rdquo; said I to myself,  but I felt a vague relief that was deeper than I imagined, when she suddenly  relinquished her strained attitude, and advancing a step or so began to murmur:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not know&mdash;I did not realize I was doing what was so very wrong. Young ladies  do not ask gentlemen to come and see them, no matter how much they desire to  make their acquaintance. I see it now; I did not before. Will you&mdash;can you  forgive me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  smiled; I could not help it. I could have taken her to my heart and soothed her  as I would a child, but the pallor of womanhood, which had replaced the blush  of the child, awed me and made my own words come hesitatingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forgive  you? You must forgive me! It was as wrong for me,&rdquo; I went on with a wild idea  of not mincing matters with this pure soul, &ldquo;to obey your innocent request, as  it was for you to make it. I am a man of the world and know its <i>convenances</i>;  you are very young.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sixteen,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>The  abrupt little confession, implying as it did her determination not to accept  any palliation of her conduct which it did not deserve, touched me strangely. &ldquo;But  very young for that,&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  aunty says, but no one can ever say it any more,&rdquo; she answered. Then with a sudden  gush, &ldquo;We shall never see each other again, and you must forget the motherless  girl who has met you in a way for which she must blush through life. It is no  excuse,&rdquo; she pursued hurriedly, &ldquo;that nurse thought it was all right. She  always approves of everything I do or want to do, especially if it is anything  aunt would be likely to forbid. I have been spoiled by nurse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  nurse the woman who came for me?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>She  nodded her head with a quick little motion inexpressibly charming. &ldquo;Yes, that  was nurse. She said she would do it all, I need only write the note. She meant  to give me a pleasure, but she did wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  thought I, &ldquo;how wrong you little know or realize.&rdquo; But I only said, &ldquo;You must  be guided by some one with more knowledge of the world after this. Not,&rdquo; I made  haste to add, struck by the misery in her child eyes, &ldquo;that any harm has been  done. You could not have appealed to the friendship of any one who would hold  you in greater respect than I. Whether we meet again or not, my memory of you  shall be sweet and sacred, I promise you that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  she threw out her hand with a quick gesture. &ldquo;No, do not remember me. My only  happiness will lie in the thought you have forgotten.&rdquo; And the last remnants of  the child soul vanished in that hurried utterance. &ldquo;You must go now,&rdquo; she  continued more calmly. &ldquo;The carriage that brought you is at the door; I must  ask you to take it back to your home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo;  I exclaimed with a wild and unbearable sense of sudden loss as she laid her  hand on the knob of the door, &ldquo;are we to part like this? Will you not at least  trust me with your name before I go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  hand dropped from the knob as if it had been hot steel, and she turned towards  me with a slow yearning motion that whatever it betokened set my heart beating  violently. &ldquo;You do not know it, then?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know nothing but what this little note contains,&rdquo; I replied, drawing her letter  from my pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that letter! I must have it,&rdquo; she murmured; then, as I stepped towards her,  drew back and pointing to the table said, &ldquo;Lay it there, please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  did so, whereupon something like a smile crossed her lips and I thought she was  going to reward me with her name, but she only said, &ldquo;I thank you; now you know  nothing;&rdquo; and almost before I realized it she had opened the door and stepped  into the hall.</p>
  <p>As  I made haste to follow her, the sound of a low, &ldquo;He is a gentleman, he will ask  no questions,&rdquo; struck my ear, and looking up, I saw her just leaving the side  of the old nurse who stood evidently awaiting me half down the hall. Bowing  with formal ceremony, I passed her by and proceeded to the front door. As I did  so I caught one glimpse of her face. It had escaped from all restraint and the  expression of the eyes was overpowering. I subdued a wild impulse to leap back  to her side, and stepped at once over the threshold. The nurse joined me, and  together we went down the stoop to the street.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I inquire where you wish to be taken?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>I  told her, and she gave the order to the coachman, together with a few words I  did not hear; then stepping back she waited for me to get in. There was no help  for it. I gave one quick look behind me, saw the front door close, realized how  impossible it would ever be for me to recognize the house again, and placed my  foot on the carriage step. Suddenly a bright idea struck me, and hastily  dropping my cane I stepped back to pick it up. As I did so I pulled out a bit  of crayon I chanced to have in my pocket, and as I stooped, chalked a small  cross on the curbstone directly in front of the house, after which I recovered  my cane, uttered some murmured word of apology, jumped into the carriage and  was about to shut the door, when the old nurse stepped in after me and quietly  closed it herself. By the pang that shot through my breast as the carriage  wheels left the house, I knew that for the first time in my life, I <i>loved</i>.</p>

  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Patience,  and shuffle the cards.&rdquo;&mdash;Cervantes.</p>
  <p>If  I had expected anything from the presence in the carriage of the woman who had  arranged this interview, I was doomed to disappointment. Reticent before, she  was absolutely silent now, sitting at my side like a grim statue or a frozen  image of watchfulness, ready to awake and stop me if I offered to open the door  or make any other move indicative of a determination to know where I was, or in  what direction I was going. That her young mistress in the momentary  conversation they had held before our departure had succeeded in giving her  some idea of the shame with which she had felt herself overwhelmed and her  present natural desire for secrecy, I do not doubt, but I think now, as I  thought then, that the unusual precautions taken both at that time and before,  to keep me in ignorance of the young lady&rsquo;s identity, were due to the elderly  woman&rsquo;s own consciousness of the peril she had invoked in yielding to the  wishes of her young and thoughtless mistress; a theory which, if true, argues  more for the mind than the conscience of this mysterious woman. However, it is  with facts we have to deal, and you will be more interested in learning what I  did, than what I thought during that short ride in perfect darkness.</p>
  <p>The  mark which I had left on the curbstone behind me sufficiently showed the nature  of my resolve, and when we made the first turn at the end of the block I leaned  back in my seat and laying my finger on my wrist, began to count the pulsations  of my blood. It was the only device that suggested itself, by which I might  afterward gather some approximate notion of the distance we travelled in a  straight course down town. I had just arrived at the number seven hundred and  sixty-two, and was inwardly congratulating myself upon this new method of  reckoning distance, when the wheels gave a lurch and we passed over a car  track. Instantly all my fine calculations fell to the ground. We were not in  Madison Avenue, as I supposed; could not be, since no track crosses that avenue  below Fifty-ninth Street, and we were proceeding on as we could not have done  had we gained the terminus of the avenue at Twenty-third Street. Could it be  that the carriage had not been turned around while I was in the house, and that  we had come back by way of Fifth Avenue? I could not remember&mdash;in fact, the more  I tried to think which way the horses&rsquo; heads were directed when we went into  the house, the more I was confused. But presently I considered that wherever we  were, we certainly had not passed over the narrow strip of smooth pavement in  front of the Worth monument, and therefore could not have reached Twenty-third  Street by way of Fifth Avenue. We must be up town, and that track we crossed  must have been at Fifty-ninth Street. And soon, as if to assure me of this, we  took a turn, quickly followed at a block&rsquo;s length by another, after which I had  no difficulty in recognizing the smooth pavement of the entrance to the Park or  the roll down Fifth Avenue afterwards. &ldquo;They have thought to confuse me by an  extra mile or so of travel,&rdquo; thought I, with some complacency, &ldquo;but the streets  of New York are too simply laid out to lend themselves to any such easy mode of  mystification.&rdquo; Yet I have thought since then how, with a smarter man on the  box, the affair might have been conducted so as to have baffled the oldest  citizen in any attempt at calculation.</p>
  <p>When  we stopped in front of the Albemarle I quietly thanked the woman who had  conducted me, and stepped to the ground. Instantly the door shut behind me, the  carriage drove off, and I was left standing there like a man suddenly awakened  from a dream.</p>
  <p>Entering  my hotel, I ordered supper, thinking that the very practical occupation of  eating would serve to divert my mind into its ordinary channels. But the dream,  if dream it was, had made too vivid an impression to be shaken off so easily.  It followed me to the hall in the evening and mingled with every chord I  struck.</p>
  <p>I  could scarcely sleep that night for thinking of the sweet child&rsquo;s face that had  blossomed into a woman&rsquo;s before my eyes, and what a woman! With the first hint  of daylight I rose, and as soon as it was in any degree suitable to be out,  hired a cab and proceeded to the corner of Fifty-ninth Street and Madison  Avenue, where, according to my calculations of the evening before, we had  crossed the car track which had first interrupted me in that very original  method of computing distance of which I have already spoken, a method by the  way, which you must acknowledge is an improvement on the boy&rsquo;s plan of finding  his way back from the woods by means of the bread-crumbs he had scattered  behind him, forgetting that the birds would eat up his crumbs and leave him  without a clew. Bidding the driver proceed at the ordinary jog trot down the  avenue, I laid my finger on my wrist, and counted each throb of my pulse till I  had reached the magical number seven hundred and sixty-two. Then putting my  head out of the window, I bade him stop. We were in the middle of a block, but  that did not disconcert me. I had not expected to gain more than an approximate  idea of the spot where we had first turned into the avenue, it being impossible  to regulate the horses&rsquo; pace so as to tally with that taken by the span of the  night before, even if the pulsations in my wrist were to be absolutely relied  upon. Noting the streets between which we had paused, I bade the driver to turn  down one and come back by the other, occupying myself in the meanwhile, in  searching the curbstone for the small mark I had left in front of her door the  night before. But though we drove slowly and I searched carefully, not a trace  did I perceive of that tell-tale sign, and forsaking those two streets, I  ordered my obedient Jehu to try the two outlying ones below and above. He did  so, and I again consulted the curbstone, but with no better success. No mark or  remnants of a mark was to be found anywhere. Nor, though we travelled through  three or four other streets in the same way, did we come upon any clew liable  to assist me in my search. Clean discouraged and somewhat out of temper with  myself for my pusillanimity of the evening before in not having braved the  anger of my companion by opening the carriage door at the first corner and  leaping out, I commanded to be taken back to the hotel, where for a whole  miserable day I racked my brain with devices for acquiring the knowledge I so  much desired. The result was futile, as you may imagine; nor will I stop to  recount the various expedients to which I afterwards resorted in my vain  attempt to solve the mystery of this young girl&rsquo;s identity.</p>
  <p>Enough  that they all failed, even the very promising one of searching the various  photographic establishments of the city, for the valuable clew which her  picture would give me. And so a week passed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is time this mad infatuation was at an end,&rdquo; said I to myself one morning as I  sat down to write a letter. &ldquo;There is no hope of my ever seeing her again, and  I am but frittering away the best emotions of my life in thus indulging in a  dream that is not the prelude to a reality.&rdquo; But in spite of the wise  determination thus made, I soon found my thoughts recurring to their old  channel, and seized with sudden impatience at my evident weakness, took up the  letter I had been writing and was about to read it, when to my great amazement  I perceived that instead of inditing the usual words of a business  communication, I had been engaged in scribbling a certain number up and down the  page and even across the bottom where my signature should have been.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I a fool?&rdquo; I exclaimed, and was about to tear the sheet in two, when glancing  again at the number, which was a simple thirty-six, I asked myself where I had  got those especial figures. Instantly there arose before my mind&rsquo;s eye the  vision of a brown-stone front with its vestibule and door. It was, then, the  number of a house; but what house? a <i>chateau en Espagne</i> or a <i>bona  fide</i> New York dwelling, which for some reason had unconsciously impressed  itself upon my memory? I could not answer. There on the page was the number  thirty-six, and equally plain in my mind was the look of the brown-stone front  to which that number belonged&mdash;and that was all.</p>
  <p>But  it was enough to awaken within me the spirit of inquiry. The few houses thus  numbered in that quarter of the city where I had lately been, were not so hard  to find but that a morning given to the business ought to satisfy me whether  the vision in my mind had its basis in reality. Taking a cab, I rode up town  and into that region of streets I had traversed so carefully a week before. For  I was assured that if the impression had been made by an actual dwelling it had  been done at that time. Following the same course I then took, I consulted the appearance  of the various houses to which that number was assigned. The first was built of  brick; that was not it. The next one had pillars to the vestibule; and that was  not it. The third, to use an Irish bull, was no house at all, but a stable,  while the fourth was an elegant structure of much more pretension than the  plain and simple front I had in my mind or memory. I was about to utter a curse  upon my folly and go home, when I remembered there was yet a street or two  taken in my zig-zag course of the week before, which I had not yet tested. &ldquo;Might  as well be thorough,&rdquo; I muttered, and bade my driver proceed down &mdash; Street.</p>
  <p>What  was there in its aspect that dimly excited me at the first glance? A dim  remembrance, a certain ghostly assurance that we had reached the right spot? As  we neared the number I sought, I could not suppress an exclamation of surprise.  For there before me to its last detail, stood the house which involuntarily  presented itself to my mind, when my eye first fell upon that mysterious number  scribbled at the foot of the page I was writing.</p>
  <p>It  was, then, no chimera of an overwrought brain, this vision of a house-front  which had been haunting me, but a distinct remembrance of an actual dwelling  seen by me in my former journey through this street. But why this house-front  above all others; what was there in it to make such an impression? Looking at  it I could not determine, but after we had passed, something, I cannot tell  what, brought back another remembrance, trivial in itself, but yet a link in  the chain that was destined sooner or later to lead me out of the maze into  which I had stumbled. It was merely this; that as I rode along the streets on  that memorable morning, searching for that mark on the curbstone from which I  hoped so much, I had come upon a spot where the pavement had been freshly  washed. With that unconscious action of the brain with which we are familiar, I  looked at the sidewalk a moment, running even then with the water that had been  cast upon it, and then gave a quick glance at the house. That glance, account  for it as you will, took in the picture before it as the camera catches the  impression of a likeness, and though in another instant I had forgotten the  whole occurrence, it needed but a certain train of thought or perhaps a certain  state of emotion to revive it again.</p>
  <p>A  noble cause for such an act of unconscious cerebration you will say, a freshly  washed pavement: <i>Le jeu ne faut pas la chandelle.</i> And so I thought too,  or would have thought if I had not been so interested in the pursuit in which I  was engaged, and if the idea had not suggested itself that water and a broom  might obliterate chalk-marks from curbstones, and that the imps that preside  over our mental forces would not indulge in such a trick at my expense unless  the play <i>was</i> worth the candle. At all events, from the moment I made  this discovery, I fixed my faith on that house as the one which held the object  of my search, and though I contented myself with merely noting the number of  the street as we left it, I none the less determined to pursue my  investigations, till I had learned beyond the possibility of a doubt whether my  conjectures were not true.</p>
  <p>A  perseverance worthy of a better cause you will say, but you are no longer  twenty-five and under the influence of your first passion. I own I was  astonished at myself and frequently paused in the pursuit I had undertaken, to  ask if I were the same person who but a fortnight before laughed at the story  of a man who had gone mad over the body of an unknown woman he had saved from a  wreck only to find her dead in his arms.</p>
  <p>The  first thing I did was to ascertain the name of the gentleman occupying the  house I have specified. It was that of one of our wealthiest and most  respectable bankers, a name as well known in the city&mdash;as your own for instance.  This was somewhat disconcerting, but with a dogged resolution somewhat foreign  to my natural disposition, I persevered in my investigations, and learning in  the next breath that the gentleman alluded to was a widower with an only child,  a young daughter of about sixteen or so, recovered my assurance, though not my  equanimity. Seeking out my friend Farrar, who as you know is a walking gazette  of New York society, I broached the subject of Mr.&mdash;excuse me if I do not  mention his name; allow me to say, Preston&rsquo;s domestic affairs, and learned that  Miss Preston, &ldquo;A naive little piece for so great an heiress,&rdquo; I remember Farrar  called her, had left town within a day or two for a visit to some friends in  Baltimore. &ldquo;I happen to know,&rdquo; said he with that careless sweep of his hand at  which you have so often laughed, &ldquo;because my friend Miss Forsyth met her at the  depot. She was intending to be gone&mdash;two weeks, I think she said. Do you know  her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That  last question sprung upon me unawares, and I am afraid I blushed. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I  returned, &ldquo;I have not that honor but an acquaintance of mine has&mdash;well&mdash;has met  her and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see, I see,&rdquo; broke in Farrar with his most disagreeable smile. Then with a  short laugh, meant to act as a warning, I suppose, added as he walked off, &ldquo;I  hope your friend is in fair circumstances and not connected with the fine arts.  Music is Mr. Preston&rsquo;s detestation, while Miss Preston though too young to be  much sought after yet, will in two years&rsquo; time have the pick of the city at her  command.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo;  thought I to myself; &ldquo;my little innocent charmer is an embryo aristocrat, eh?  Well then, I was a greater fool than I imagined.&rdquo; And I walked out of the hotel  where I had met Farrar, with the very sensible conclusion to drop a subject  that promised nothing but disappointment.</p>
  <p>But  the fates were against me, or the good angels perhaps, and at the next comer I  met an old acquaintance, the very opposite of Farrar in character, who with a  long love story of his own fired, my imagination to such an extent that in  spite of myself I turned down &mdash; Street, and was proceeding to pass her house,  when suddenly the thought struck me, &ldquo;How do I know that this unapproachable  daughter of one of our most prominent citizens is one and the same person with  my dainty little charmer? Widowers with young daughters are not so rare in this  great city that I need consider the question as decided, because by a half  superstitious freak of my own I have settled upon this house as the one I was  in the other night. My inamorata may be the offspring of a musician for all I  know.&rdquo; And inflamed at the thought of this possibility&mdash;I remembered the piano,  you see&mdash;I gave to the winds all my fine resolutions and only asked how I could  determine for once and all, whether I had ever crossed the threshold of the  house before me. Some men would have run up the stoop, rung the bell and asked  to see Mr. Preston on some pretended business he could easily conjure up to  suit the occasion, but my face is too well known for me to risk any such  attempt, besides I was too anxious to win the confidence of the young girl to  shock her awakened sense of propriety by seeming to seek her where she did not  wish to be found. And yet I must enter that house and see for myself if it was  the one that held her on that memorable evening.</p>
  <p>Pondering  the question, I looked back at the door so obstinately closed against my  curiosity, when to my satisfaction and delight it suddenly opened and a man  stepped out, whom I instantly recognized as a business agent for one of the  largest piano-forte manufactories in the city. &ldquo;The heavens smile upon my  enterprise,&rdquo; thought I, and waited for the man to come up with me. He was not  only a friend of mine but largely indebted to me in various ways, so that I  knew I had only to urge a request for it to be immediately granted, and that,  too, without any questions or gossip.</p>
  <p>You  will not be interested in anything but the result, which was somewhat out of  the usual course, and may therefore shock you. But you must remember that I am  telling you of matters which young men usually keep to themselves, and that  whatever I did, was accomplished in a spirit of respect only a shade less  constraining in its power than the love that was at once my impelling force,  and my constant embarrassment.</p>
  <p>To  come, then, to the point, a piano was to be set up in that house on that very  day, Mr. Preston having yielded to the solicitations of his daughter for a new  instrument. My friend was to be engaged in the transfer, and at my solicitation  for leave to assist in the operation, gave his consent in perfect confidence as  to my possessing good and sufficient reasons for such a remarkable request, and  appointed the hour at which I was to meet him at the ware-rooms.</p>
  <p>Behold  me, then, at half-past two that afternoon, assisting with my own hands in  carrying a piano up the stoop of that house which, four hours before, I had  regarded as unapproachable. Dressed in a workman&rsquo;s blouse and with my hair well  roughened under a rude cap that effectually disguised me, I advanced with but  little fear of detection. And yet no sooner had I entered the house and seen at  a glance that the aspect of the hall coincided with my rather vague remembrance  of that through which I had been ushered a week before, than I was struck by a  sudden sense of my situation, and experiencing that uncomfortable consciousness  of self-betrayal, which a blush always gives a man, stumbled forward under my  heavy burden, feeling as if a thousand eyes were fixed upon me and my cherished  secret, instead of the two sharp but totally unsuspicious orbs of the elderly  matron that surveyed us from the top of the banisters. &ldquo;Be careful there, you&rsquo;ll  knock a hole through that glass door!&rdquo; though a natural cry under the  circumstances, struck on my ears with the force and mysterious power of a  secret warning, and when after a moment of blind advance I suddenly lifted my  eyes and found myself in the little room, which like a silhouette on a white  ground, stood out in my memory in distinct detail as the spot where I had first  heard my own heart beat, I own that I felt my hands slipping from my burden,  and in another moment had disgraced my character of a workman if I had not  caught the sudden ring of a well known voice in the hall, as nurse answered  from above some question propounded by the elderly lady with the piercing eyes.  As it was, I recovered myself and went through my duties as promptly and deftly  as if my heart did not throb with memories that each passing hour and event  only served to hallow to my imagination.</p>
  <p>At  length the piano was duly set up and we turned to leave. Will you think I am  too trivial in my details if I tell you that I lingered behind the rest and for  an instant let my hand with all its possibilities for calling out a soul from  that dead instrument, lie a moment on the keys over which her dainty fingers  were so soon to traverse?</p>

    The Rubicon</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  stake my life upon her faith.&rdquo;&mdash;Othello.</p>
  <p>Once  convinced of the identity of my sweet young friend with the Miss Preston at  whose feet a two year hence, the wealth and aristocracy of New York would be  kneeling, I drew back from further effort as having received a damper to my  presumptuous hopes that would soon effectually stifle them. Everything I heard  about the family&mdash;and it seemed as if suddenly each chance acquaintance that I  met had something to say about Mr. Preston either as a banker or a man, only  served to confirm me in this view. &ldquo;He is a money worshipper,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;The  bluest of blue Presbyterians,&rdquo; declared another. &ldquo;The enemy of presumption and  anything that looks like an overweening confidence in one&rsquo;s own worth or  capabilities,&rdquo; remarked a third. &ldquo;A man who would beggar himself to save the  honor of a corporation with which he was concerned,&rdquo; observed a fourth &ldquo;but who  would not invite to his table the most influential man connected with it if  that man was unable to trace his family back to the old Dutch settlers to which  Mr. Preston&rsquo;s own ancestors belonged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  latter statement I have no doubt was exaggerated for I myself have seen him at  dinners where half the gentlemen who lifted the wine glass were self-made in  every sense of the term. But it showed the bent of his mind and it was a bent  that left me entirely out of the sweep of his acquaintanceship much less that  of his exquisite daughter, the pride of his soul if not the jewel of his heart.</p>
  <p>But  when will a man who has seen or who flatters himself that he has seen in the  eyes of the woman he admires, the least spark of that fire which is consuming  his own soul, pause at an obstacle which after all has its basis simply in  circumstances of position or will. By the time the two weeks of her expected  absence had expired, I had settled it in my own mind that I would see her again  and if I found the passing caprice of a child was likely to blossom into the  steady regard of a woman, risk all in the attempt to win by honorable endeavor  and persistence this bud of loveliness for my future wife.</p>
  <p>How  I finally succeeded by means of my friend Farrar in being one evening invited  to the same house as Miss Preston it is not necessary to state. You will  believe me it was done with the utmost regard for her feelings and in a way  that deceived Farrar himself, who if he is the most prying is certainly the  most volatile of men. In a crowded parlor, then, in the midst of the flash of  diamonds and the flutter of fans Miss Preston and I again met. When I first saw  her she was engaged in conversation with some young companion, and I had the  pleasure of watching for a few minutes, unobserved, the play of her ingenuous  countenance, as she talked with her friend, or sat silently watching the  brilliant array before her. I found her like and yet unlike the vision of my  dreams. More blithesome in her appearance, as was not strange considering her  party attire and the lustre of the chandelier under which she sat, there was  still that indescribable something in her expression which more than the flash  of her eye or the curve of her lip, though both were lovely to me, made her  face the one woman&rsquo;s face in the world for me; a charm which circumstances  might alter, or suffering impair, but of which nothing save death could ever  completely divest her and not death either, for it was the seal of her  individuality, and that she would take with her into the skies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I might but advance and sit down by her side without a word of explanation or  the interference of conventionalities how happy I should be,&rdquo; thought I. But I  knew that would not do, so I contented myself with my secret watch over her  movements, longing for and yet dreading the advance of my hostess, with its  inevitable introduction. Suddenly the piano was touched in a distant room and  not till I saw the quick change in her face, a change hard to explain, did I  recognize the selection as one I was in the habit of playing. <i>She</i> had  not forgotten at least, and thrilled by the thought and the remembrance of that  surge of color which had swept like a flood over her cheek, I turned away,  feeling as if I were looking on what it was for no man&rsquo;s eyes to see, least of  all mine.</p>
  <p>My  hostess&rsquo; voice arrested me and next moment I was bowing to the ground before  Miss Preston.</p>
  <p>I  am not a boy; nor have I been without my experiences: life with its  vicissitudes has taught me many a lesson, subjected me to many a trial, yet in  all my career have I never known a harder moment than when I raised my eyes to  meet hers after that lowly obeisance. That she would be indignant I knew, that  she might even misinterpret my motives and probably withdraw without giving me  an opportunity to speak, I felt to be only too probable, but that she would  betray an agitation so painful I had not anticipated, and for an instant I felt  that I had hazarded my life&rsquo;s happiness on a cast that was going against me.  But the necessity of saving her from remark speedily restored me to myself, and  following the line of conduct I had previously laid out, I addressed her with  the reserve of a stranger, and neither by word, look or manner conveyed to her  a suggestion that we had ever met or spoken to each other before. She seemed to  appreciate my consideration and though she was as yet too much unused to the  ways of the world to completely hide her perturbation, she gradually regained a  semblance of self-possession, and ere long was enabled to return short answers  to my remarks, though her eyes remained studiously turned aside and never so  much as ventured to raise themselves to the passing throng much less to my  face, half turned away also.</p>
  <p>Presently  however a change passed over her. Pressing her two little hands together, she  drew back a step or two, speaking my name with a certain tone of command.  Struck with apprehension, I knew not why, I followed her. Instantly like one  repeating a lesson she spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is very good in you to talk to me as though we were the strangers that people  believe us. I appreciate it and thank you very much. But it is not being just  true; that is I feel as if I were not being just true, and as we can never be  friends, would it not be better for us not to meet in this way any more?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why,&rdquo; I gently asked, with a sense of struggling for my life, &ldquo;can we never be  friends?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  answer was a deep blush; not that timid conscious appeal of the blood that is  beating too warmly for reply, but the quick flush of indignant generosity  forced to do despite to its own instincts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is a question I would rather not answer,&rdquo; she murmured at length. &ldquo;Only it is  so; or I should not speak in this way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo;  I ventured, resolved to know on just what foundations my happiness was  tottering, &ldquo;you will at least tell me if this harsh decree is owing to any  offence I myself may have inadvertently given. The honor of your acquaintance,&rdquo;  I went on, determined she should know just what a hope she was slaying, &ldquo;is  much too earnestly desired, for me to wilfully hazard its loss by saying or  doing aught that could be in any way displeasing to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have done nothing but what was generous,&rdquo; said she with increasing womanliness  of manner, &ldquo;unless it was taking advantage of my being here, to learn my name  and gain an introduction to me after I had desired you to forget my very  existence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  recoiled at that, the chord of my self-respect was touched. &ldquo;It was not here I  learned your name, Miss Preston. It has been known to me for two weeks. At the  risk of losing by your displeasure what is already hazarded by your prudence, I  am bound to acknowledge that from the hour I left your father&rsquo;s house that  night, I have spared no effort compatible with my deep respect for your  feelings, to ascertain who the young lady was that had done me such an honor,  and won from me such a deep regard. I had not intended to tell you this,&rdquo; I  added, &ldquo;but your truth has awakened mine, and whatever the result may be, you  must see me as I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are very kind,&rdquo; she replied governing with growing skill the trembling of her  voice. &ldquo;The acquaintance of a girl of sixteen is not worth so much trouble on  the part of a man like yourself.&rdquo; And blushing with the vague apprehension of  her sex in the presence of a devotion she rather feels than understands, she  waved her trembling little hand and paused irresolute, seemingly anxious to  terminate the interview but as yet too inexperienced to know how to manage a  dismissal requiring so much tact and judgment.</p>
  <p>I  saw, comprehended her position and hesitated. She was so young, uncle, her  prospects in life were so bright; if I left her then, in a couple of weeks she  would forget me. What was I that I should throw the shadow of manhood&rsquo;s deepest  emotion across the paradise of her young untrammelled being. But the old Adam  of selfishness has his say in my soul as well as in that of my fellow-men, and  forgetting myself enough to glance at her half averted face, I could not  remember myself sufficiently afterwards to forego without a struggle, all hope  of some day beholding that soft cheek turn in confidence at my approach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Preston,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the promise of the bud atones for its folded leaves.&rdquo; Then  with a fervor I did not seek to disguise, &ldquo;You say we cannot be friends; would  your decision be the same if this were our first meeting?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  that flush of outraged feeling. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;yes I think&mdash;I fear it would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  strove to help her. &ldquo;There is too great a difference between Bertram Mandeville  the pianist, and the daughter of Thaddeus Preston.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  turned and looked me gently in the eye, she did not need to speak. Regret,  shame, longing flashed in her steady glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  not answer,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I understand; I am glad it is circumstances that stand in  the way, and not any misconception on your part as to my motives and deep  consideration for yourself. Circumstances can be changed.&rdquo; And satisfied with  having thus dropped into the fruitful soil of that tender breast, the seed of a  future hope, I bowed with all the deference at my command and softly withdrew.</p>
  <p>But  not to rest. With all the earnestness with which a man sets himself to decide  upon the momentous question of life or death, I gave myself up to a night of  reflection, and seated in my solitary bachelor apartment, debated with myself  as to the resolution at which I had dimly hinted in my parting words to Miss  Preston.</p>
  <p>That  I am a musician by nature, my success with the public seems to indicate.  That by following out the line upon which I had entered I would attain a  certain eminence in my art, I do not doubt. But uncle, there are two kinds of  artists in this world; those that work because the spirit is in them and they  cannot be silent if they would, and those that speak from a conscientious  desire to make apparent to others the beauty that has awakened their own admiration.  The first could not give up his art for any cause, without the sacrifice of his  soul&rsquo;s life; the latter&mdash;well the latter could and still be a man with his whole  inner being intact. Or to speak plainer, the first has no choice, while the  latter has, if he has a will to exert it. Now you will say, and the world at  large, that I belong to the former class. I have risen in ten years from a  choir boy in Trinity Church to a position in the world of music that insures me  a full audience wherever and whenever I have a mind to exert my skill as a  pianist. Not a man of my years has a more promising outlook in my profession,  if you will pardon the seeming egotism of the remark, and yet by the ease with  which I felt I could give it up at the first touch of a master passion, I know  that I am not a prophet in my art but merely an interpreter, one who can speak  well but who has never felt the descent of the burning tongue and hence not a  sinner against my own soul if I turn aside from the way I am walking. The question  was, then, should I make a choice? Love, as you say, seems at first blush too  insecure a joy, if not often too trivial a one, to unsettle a man in his career  and change the bent of his whole after life; especially a love born of surprise  and fed by the romance of distance and mystery. Had I met her in ordinary  intercourse, surrounded by her friends and without the charm cast over her by  unwonted circumstances, and then had felt as I did now that of all women I had  seen, she alone would ever move the deep springs of my being, it would be  different. But with this atmosphere of romance surrounding and hallowing her  girl&rsquo;s form till it seemed almost as ethereal and unearthly as that of an angel&rsquo;s,  was I safe in risking fame or fortune in an attempt to acquire what in the  possession might prove as bare and common-place as a sweep of mountain heather  stripped of its sunshine. Curbing every erratic beat of my heart, I summoned up  her image as it bloomed in my fancy, and surveying it with cruel eyes, asked what  was real and what the fruit of my own imagination. The gentle eye, the  trembling lip, the girlish form eloquent with the promise of coming  womanhood,&mdash;were these so rare, that beside them no other woman should seem to  glance or smile or move? And her words! what had she said, that any  simple-minded, modest yet loving girl might not have uttered under the  circumstances. Surely my belief in her being the one, the best and the dearest  was a delusion, and to no delusion was I willing to sacrifice my art. But straight  upon that conclusion came sweeping down a flood of counter-reasons. If not the  wonder she seemed, she was at least a wonder to me. If I had seen her under  romantic circumstances, and unconsciously been influenced by them, the  influence had remained and nothing would ever rob her form of the halo thus  acquired. Whether I ever won her to my fireside or not, she must always remain  the fairy figure of my dreams, and being so, the gentle eye and tender lip  acquired a value that made them what they seemed, the exponent of love and  happiness. And lastly if love well or illy founded was an uncertain joy, and  the passion for a woman a poor substitute for the natural incentive of talent  or ambition, <i>this</i> love had within it the beginning of something deeper  than joy, and in the passion thus cheaply characterized, dwelt a force and  living fire that notwithstanding all I have hitherto achieved, has ever been  lacking from my dreams of endeavor.</p>
  <p>As  you will see, the most natural question of all did not disturb me in these  cogitations: And that was, whether in making the sacrifice I proposed, I should  meet with the reward I had promised myself. The fancies of a young girl of  sixteen are not usually of a stable enough character to warrant a man in  building upon them his whole future happiness, especially a young girl situated  like Miss Preston in the midst of friends who would soon be admirers, and  adulators who would soon be her humble slaves. But the doubt which a serious  contemplation of this risk must have presented, was of so unnerving a  character, I dared not admit it. <i>If</i> I made the sacrifice, I must meet  with my reward. I would listen to no other conclusion. Besides, something in  the young girl herself, I cannot tell what, assured me then as it assures me  now, that whatever virtues or graces she might lack, that of fidelity to a  noble idea was not among them; that once convinced of the purity and value of  the flame that had been lit in her innocent breast, nothing short of the  unworthiness of the object that had awakened it, would ever serve to eliminate  or extinguish it. That I was not worthy but would make it the business of my  life to become so, was certain; that she would mark my endeavors and bestow  upon me the sympathy they deserved, I was equally sure. No one would ever make  such a sacrifice to her love as I was willing to do, and consequently in no one  would I find a rival.</p>
  <p>The  morning light surprised me in the midst of the struggle, nor did I decide the  question that day. Mr. Preston might not be as determined in his prejudices  against musicians as my friends or even his daughter had imagined. I resolved  to see him. Taking advantage of his connection with the &mdash; Club, I procured an  introducer in the shape of a highly respected person of his own class, and went  one evening to the Club-rooms with the full intention of making his  acquaintance if possible. He was already there and in conversation with some  business associates. Procuring a seat as near him as possible, I anxiously  surveyed his countenance. It was not a reassuring one, and studied in this way,  had the effect of dampening any hopes I may have cherished in the outset. He  soften to the sounds of sweet strains or the voice of youthful passion! As soon  as the granite rock to the surge of the useless billow. His very necktie spoke  volumes. It was an old fashioned stock, full of the traditions of other days,  while his coat, shabbier than any I would presume to wear, betrayed in every  well-worn seam the pride of the aristocrat and millionaire who in his native  city and before the eyes of his fellow magnates does not need to carry the  evidences of his respectability upon his back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would be worse than folly for me to approach him on such a subject,&rdquo; I mentally  ejaculated. &ldquo;If he did not stare the musician out of countenance he would the  newly risen man.&rdquo; And I came very near giving up the whole thing.</p>
  <p>But  the genius that watches over the affairs of true love was with me  notwithstanding the unpropitious state of my surroundings. In a few minutes I  received my expected introduction to Mr. Preston, and I found that underneath  the repelling austerity of his expression, was a kindly spark for youth, and a  decided sympathy for all instances of manly endeavor if only it was in a  direction he approved; further that my own personality was agreeable to him and  that he was disposed to regard me with favor until by some chance and very  natural allusion to my profession by the friend standing between us, he learned  that I was a musician, when a decided change came over his countenance and he  exclaimed in that blunt, decisive way of his that admits of no reply:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  jingler on the piano, eh? Pretty poor use for a man to put his brains to, I  say, or even his fingers. Sorry to hear we cannot be friends.&rdquo; And without  waiting for a reply, took my introducer by the arm and drew him a step or so to  one side. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say at once he was Mandeville the musician,&rdquo; I  overheard him ask in somewhat querulous tones. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know I consider the  whole race of them an abomination. I would have more respect for my bank clerk  than I would for the greatest man of them all, were it Rubenstein himself.&rdquo;  Then in a lower tone but distinctly and almost as if he meant me to hear, &ldquo;My  daughter has a leaning towards this same fol-de-rol and has lately requested my  permission to make the acquaintance of some musical characters, but I soon  convinced her that manhood under the disguise of a harlequin&rsquo;s jacket could  have no interest for her; that when a human being, man or woman has sunk to be  a mere rattler of sweet sounds, he has reached a stage of infantile development  that has little in common with the nervous energy and business force of her  Dutch ancestry. And my daughter stoops to make no acquaintances she cannot bid  sit at her father&rsquo;s table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  daughter is a child yet, I thought,&rdquo; was ventured by his companion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Preston is sixteen, just the age at which my mother gave her hand to my  respected father sixty-seven years ago.&rdquo; And with this drop of burning lead let  fall into my already agitated bosom they passed on.</p>
  <p>He  would have more respect for his bank clerk! Would his bank clerk or what was  better, a young man with means at his command, working in a business capacity  more in consonance with the tastes he had evinced, have a chance of winning his  daughter? I began to think he might. &ldquo;The way grows clearer!&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
  <p>But  it was not till after another interview with him ten minutes later in the lobby  that I finally made up my mind. He was standing quite alone in an obscure  corner, fumbling in an awkward way with his muffler that had caught on the  button of his coat. Seeing it, I hastened forward to his assistance and was  rewarded by a kind enough nod to embolden me to say,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have been introduced to you as a musician; would my acquaintance be more  acceptable to you if I told you that the pursuit of art bids fair in my case to  yield to the exigencies of business? That I purpose leaving the concert-room  for the banker&rsquo;s office and that henceforth my only ambition promises to be  that of Wall Street?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  most certainly would,&rdquo; exclaimed he, holding out his hand with an unmistakable  gesture of satisfaction. &ldquo;You have too good a countenance to waste before a  piano-top strumming to the smirks of women and the plaudits of weak-headed men.  Let us see you at the desk, my lad. We are in want of trustworthy young men to  take the place of us older ones.&rdquo; Then politely, &ldquo;Do you expect to make the  change soon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do,&rdquo; said I.</p>
  <p>And  the Rubicon was passed.</p>

    A Hand Clasp</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;<i>Fer.</i>&mdash;Here&rsquo;s  my hand. <br>
<i>Mir.</i>&mdash;And mine with my heart in it.&rdquo;&mdash;Tempest. </p>
  <p>Once  arrived at a settled conclusion, I put every thought of wavering out of my  mind. Deciding that with such a friend in business circles as yourself, I  needed no other introducer to my new life, I set apart this evening for a  confab with you on the subject. Meanwhile it is pretty generally known that I  make no more engagements to appear through the country.</p>
  <p>I  have but one more incident to relate. Last Sunday in walking down Fifth Avenue  I met her. I did not do this inadvertently. I knew her custom of attending  Bible class and for once put myself in her way. I did not give her time to  remonstrate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  not express your displeasure,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;this shall never be repeated. I merely  wish to say that I have concluded to leave a profession so little appreciated  by those whose esteem I most desire to possess; that I am about entering a  banker&rsquo;s office where it shall be my ambition to rise if possible, to wealth  and consequence. If I succeed&mdash;you shall then know what my incentive has been.  But till I succeed or at least give such tokens of success as shall insure  respect, silence must be my portion and patience my sole support. Only of one  thing rest assured, that until I inform you with my own lips that the hope  which now illumines me is gone, it will continue to burn on in my breast,  shedding light upon a way that can never seem dark while that glow rests upon  it.&rdquo; And bowing with the ceremonious politeness our positions demanded, I held  out my hand. &ldquo;One clasp to encourage me,&rdquo; I entreated.</p>
  <p>It  seemed as if she did not comprehend. &ldquo;You are going to give up music, and  for&mdash;for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo;  said I. &ldquo;Yes, don&rsquo;t forbid me,&rdquo; I implored; &ldquo;it is too late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Like  a lovely image of blushing girlhood turned by a lightning flash into marble, she  paused, pallid and breathless where she was, gazing upon me with eyes that  burned deeper and deeper as the full comprehension of all that this implied  gradually forced itself upon her mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  make a chaos of my little world,&rdquo; she murmured at length.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said I, &ldquo;<i>your</i> world is untouched. If it should never be my good fortune  to enter it, you are not to grieve. You are free, Miss Preston, free as this  sunshiny air we breathe; I alone am bound, and that because I must be whether I  will or no.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  I saw the woman I had worshipped in this young fair girl shine fully and fairly  upon me. Drawing herself up, she looked me in the face and calmly laid her hand  in mine. &ldquo;I am young,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and do not know what may be right to say to  one so generous and so kind. But this much I can promise, that whether or not I  am ever able to duly reward you for what you undertake, I will at least make it  the study of my life never to prove unworthy of so much trust and devotion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  with the last lingering look natural to a parting for years, we separated then  and there, and the crowd came between us, and the Sunday bells rang on, and  what was so vividly real to us at the moment, became in remembrance more like  the mist and shadow of a dream.</p>

  <p>Young  Mandeville having finished his story, looked at his uncle. He found him sitting  in an attitude of extreme absorption, his right arm stretched before him on the  table, his face bent thoughtfully downwards and clouded with that deep  melancholy that seemed its most natural expression, &ldquo;He has not heard me,&rdquo; was  the young man&rsquo;s first mortifying reflection. But catching his uncle&rsquo;s eye which  at that moment raised itself, he perceived he was mistaken and that he had  rather been listened to only too well.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must forgive me if I have seemed to rhapsodize,&rdquo; the young man stammered. &ldquo;You  were so quiet I half forgot I had a listener and went on much as I would if I  had been thinking aloud.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  uncle smiled and throwing off the weight of his reflections whatever they might  be, arose and began pacing the floor. &ldquo;I see you are past surgery,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;any  wisdom of mine would be only thrown away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Young  Mandeville was hurt. He had expected some token of approval on his uncle&rsquo;s  part, or at least some betrayal of sympathy. His looks expressed his disappointment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  expected to convert me by this story,&rdquo; continued the elder, pausing with a  certain regret before his nephew; &ldquo;nothing could convert me but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;  inquired Mandeville after waiting in vain for the other to finish.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something  which we will never find in the whirl of New York fashionable life. A woman  with faith to reward and soul to understand such unqualified trust as yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I believe Miss Preston is such a girl and will be such a woman. Her looks, her  last words prove it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  proves it but time and as for your belief, I have believed too.&rdquo; Then as if  fearing he had said too much, assumed his most business-like tone and observed,  &ldquo;But we will drop all that; you have resolved to quit music and enter Wall  Street, your object money and the social consideration which money secures.  Now, why Wall Street?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I can think of no other means for attaining what I desire, in the space of time  I would consent to keep a young lady of Miss Preston&rsquo;s position waiting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  and you have money, I suppose, which you propose to risk on the hazard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some!  enough to start with; a small amount to you, but sufficient if I am fortunate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  if you are not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man opened his arms with an expressive gesture, &ldquo;I am done for, that is  all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertram,&rdquo;  his uncle exclaimed with a change of tone, &ldquo;has it ever struck you that Mr.  Preston might have as strong a prejudice against speculation as against the  musical profession?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  that is, pardon me but I have sometimes thought that even in the event of  success I should have to struggle against his inherited instincts of caste and  his natural dislike of all things new, even wealth, but I never thought of the  possibility of my arousing his distrust by speculating in stocks and engaging  in enterprises so nearly in accord with his own business operations.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  if I guess aright you would run greater risk of losing the support of his  countenance by following the hazardous course you propose, than if you  continued in the line of art that now engages you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know nothing, but I fear the chances, Bertram.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I am already defeated and must give up my hopes of happiness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  smile thin and indefinable crossed the other&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;not  necessarily.&rdquo; And sitting down by his nephew&rsquo;s side, he asked if he had any  objections to enter a bank. &ldquo;In a good capacity,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  indeed; it would be an opportunity surpassing my hopes. Do you know of an  opening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;under the circumstances I will let you into the secret of my own  affairs. I have always had one ambition, and that was to be at the head of a  bank. I have not said much about it, but for the last five years I have been  working to this end, and to-day you see me the possessor of at least  three-fourths of the stock of the Madison Bank. It has been deteriorating for  some time, consequently I was enabled to buy it low, but now that I have got it  I intend to build up the concern. I am able to throw business of an important  nature in its way, and I dare prophesy that before the year is out you will see  it re-established upon a solid and influential footing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no doubt of it, sir; you have the knack of success, any thing that you  touch is sure to go straight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unhappily  yes, as far as business operations go. But no matter about that;&mdash;&rdquo; as if the  other had introduced some topic incongruous to the one they were considering&mdash;&ldquo;the  point is this. In two weeks time I shall be elected President of the Bank; if  you will accept the position of assistant cashier,&mdash;the best I can offer in  consideration of your total ignorance of all details of the business,&mdash;it is  open to you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle!  how generous! I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!  your duties will be nominal, the present cashier is fully competent; but the  leisure thus afforded will offer you abundant opportunity to make yourself  acquainted with all matters connected with the banking system as well as with  such capitalists as it would be well for you to know. So that when the occasion  comes, I can raise you to the cashier&rsquo;s place or make such other disposal of  your talents as will best insure your rapid advance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man&rsquo;s eyes sparkled; with a sudden impetuous movement he jumped to his  feet and grasped his uncle&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I can never thank you enough; you have made  me your debtor for life. Now let any one ask me who is my father, and I will  say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was Edward Sylvester&rsquo;s brother. But come, come, this extreme gratitude is  unnecessary. You have always been a favorite with me, Bertram, and now that I  have no child, you seem doubly near; it is my pleasure to do what I can for  you. But&mdash;&rdquo; and here he surveyed him with a wistful look, &ldquo;I wish you were  entering into this new line from love of the business rather than love of a  woman. I fear for you my boy. It is an awful thing to stake one&rsquo;s future upon a  single chance and that chance a woman&rsquo;s faith. If she should fail you after you  had compassed your fortune, should die&mdash;well you could bear that perhaps; but if  she turned false, and married some one else, or even married you and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;  came in silvery accents from the door, and a woman richly clad, her trailing  velvets filling the air at once with an oppressive perfume, entered the room  and paused before them in an attitude meant to be arch, but which from the  massiveness of her figure and the scornful carriage of her head, succeeded in  being simply imperious.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester rose abruptly as if unpleasantly surprised. &ldquo;Ona!&rdquo; he exclaimed,  hastening, however, to cover his embarassment by a courteous acknowledgement of  her presence and a careless remark concerning the shortness of the services  that had allowed her to return from church so early. &ldquo;I did not hear you come  in,&rdquo; he observed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I judge not,&rdquo; she returned with a side glance at Mandeville. &ldquo;But the services  were not short, on the contrary I thought I should never hear the last amen.  Mr. Turner&rsquo;s voice is very agreeable,&rdquo; she went on, in a rambling manner all  her own, &ldquo;it never interferes with your thoughts; not that I am considered as  having any,&rdquo; she interjected with another glance at their silent guest, &ldquo;a  woman in society with a reputation for taste in all matters connected with  fashionable living, has no thoughts of course; business men with only one idea  in their heads, that of making money, have more no doubt. Do you know, Edward,&rdquo;  she went on with sudden inconsequence, which was another trait of this amiable  lady&rsquo;s conversation, &ldquo;that I have quite come to a conclusion in regard to the  girl Philip Longtree is going to marry; she may be pretty, but she does not  know how to dress. I wish you could have seen her to-night; she had on mauve  with old gold trimmings. Now with one of her complexion&mdash;But I forget you haven&rsquo;t  seen her. Bertram, I think I shall give a German next month, will you come? Oh,  Edward!&rdquo; as if the thought had suddenly struck her, &ldquo;Princess Louise <i>is</i> the sixth child of Queen Victoria; I asked Mr. Turner to-night. By the way, I  wonder if it will be pleasant enough to take the horses out to-morrow? Bird has  been obliging enough to get sick just in the height of the season, Mr.  Mandeville. There are a thousand things I have got to do and I hate hired  horses.&rdquo; And with a petulant sigh she laid her prayer-book on the table and  with a glance in the mirror near by, began pulling off her gloves in the slow  and graceful fashion eminently in keeping with her every movement.</p>
  <p>It  was as if an atmosphere of worldliness had settled down upon this room  sanctified a moment before by the utterances of a pure and noble love. Mr.  Sylvester looked uneasy, while Bertram searched in vain for something to say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  seem to have brought a blight,&rdquo; she suddenly murmured in an easy tone somewhat  at variance with the glance of half veiled suspicion which she darted from  under her heavy lids, at first one and then the other of the two gentlemen  before her. &ldquo;No, I will not sit,&rdquo; she added as her husband offered her a chair.  &ldquo;I am tired almost to death and would retire immediately, but I interrupted you  I believe in the utterance of some wise saying about matrimony. It is an  interesting subject and I have a notion to hear what one so well qualified to  speak in regard to it&mdash;&rdquo; and here she made a slow, half lazy courtesy to her  husband with a look that might mean anything from coquetry to defiance&mdash;&ldquo;has to  say to a young man like Mr. Mandeville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Edward  Sylvester who was regarded as an autocrat among men, and who certainly was an  acknowledged leader in any company he chose to enter, bowed his head before  this anomalous glance with a gesture of something like submission.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  is not called upon to repeat every inadvertent phrase he may utter,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Bertram  was consulting me upon certain topics and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  answered him in your own brilliant style,&rdquo; she concluded. &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;  she asked in another moment in a low unmoved tone which the final act of smoothing  out her gloves on the table with hands delicate as white rose leaves but firm  as marble, did not either hasten or retard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  if you insist,&rdquo; he returned lightly, &ldquo;and are willing to bear the reflection my  unfortunate remark seems to cast upon the sex, I was merely observing to my  nephew, that the man who centered all his hopes upon a woman&rsquo;s faith, was  liable to disappointment. Even if he succeeded in marrying her there were still  possibilities of his repenting any great sacrifice made in her behalf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;  and for once the delicate cheek flushed deeper than its rouge. &ldquo;And why do you  say this?&rdquo; she inquired, dropping her coquettish manner and flashing upon them  both, the haughty and implacable woman Bertram had always believed her to be,  notwithstanding her vagaries and fashion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I have seen much of life outside my own house,&rdquo; her husband replied with  undiminished courtesy; &ldquo;and feel bound to warn any young man of his probable  fate, who thinks to find nothing but roses and felicity beyond the gates of  fashionable marriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah  then, it was on general principles you were speaking,&rdquo; she remarked with a soft  laugh that undulated through an atmosphere suddenly grown too heavy for easy  breathing. &ldquo;I did not know; wives are so little apt to be appreciated in this  world, Mr. Mandeville, I was afraid he might be giving you some homely advice  founded upon personal experience.&rdquo; And she moved towards their guest with that  strange smile of hers which some called dangerous but which he had always  regarded as oppressive.</p>
  <p>She  saw him drop his eyes, and smiled again, but in a different way. This woman,  whom no one accused of anything worse than levity, hailed every tribute to her  power, as a miser greets the glint of gold. With a turn of her large but  elegant figure that in its slow swaying reminded you of some heavy tropical  flower, hanging inert, intoxicated with its own fragrance, she dismissed at  once the topic that had engaged them, and launched into one of her choicest  streams of inconsequent talk. But Mandeville was in no mood to listen to  trivialities, and being of a somewhat impatient nature, presently rose and  excusing himself, took a hurried leave. Not so hurried however that he did not  have time to murmur to his uncle as they walked towards the door:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  would make comparison between the girl I worship and other women in fashionable  life. Do not I pray; she is no more like them than a star that shines is like a  rose that blooms. My fate will not be like that of most men that we know, but  better and higher.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  his uncle standing there in the grand hall-way, with the fresh splendors of  unlimited wealth gleaming upon him from every side, looked after the young man  with a sigh and repeated, &ldquo;Better and higher? God in his merciful goodness  grant it.&rdquo;</p>

    Shadows Of The Past</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Memory,  the warder of the brain.&rdquo;&mdash;Macbeth.</p>
  <p>It  was long past midnight. The fire in the grate burned dimly, shedding its  lingering glow on the face of the master of the house as with bowed head and  folded hands he sat alone and brooding before its dying embers.</p>
  <p>It  was a lonesome sight. The very magnificence of the spacious apartment with its  lofty walls and glittering works of art, seemed to give an air of remoteness to  that solitary form, bending beneath the weight of its reflections. From the  exquisitely decorated ceiling to the turkish rugs scattered over the polished  floor, all was elegant and luxurious, and what had splendors like these to do  with thoughts that bent the brows and overshadowed the lips of man? The very  lights burned deprecatingly, illuminating beauties upon which no eye gazed and  for which no heart beat. The master himself seemed to feel this, for he  presently rose and put them out, after which he seated himself as before, only  if possible with more abandon, as if with the extinguishing of the light some  eye had been shut whose gaze he had hitherto feared. And in truth my lady&rsquo;s  image shone fainter from its heavy panel, and the smile which had met with  unrelenting sweetness the glare of the surrounding splendor, softened in the  mellow glimmer of the fire-light to an etherial halo that left you at rest.</p>
  <p><i>One,  two</i>, THREE, the small clock sounded  from the mantel and yet no stir took place in the sombre figure keeping watch  beneath. What were the thoughts which could thus detain from his comfortable  bed a man already tired with manifold cares? It would be hard to tell. The  waters that gush at the touch of the diviner&rsquo;s rod are tumultuous in their flow  and rush hither and thither with little heed to the restraining force of rule  and reason. But of the pictures that rose before his eyes in those dying  embers, there were two which stood out in startling distinctness. Let us see if  we can convey the impression of them to other eyes and hearts.</p>
  <p>First,  the form of his mother. Ah grey-bearded men weighted with the cares of life and  absorbed in the monotonous round of duties that to you are the be all and end  all of existence, to whom morning means a jostling ride to the bank, the store  or the office, and with whom night is but the name for a worse unrest because  of its unfulfilled promises of slumber, what soul amongst you all is so callous  to the holy memories of childhood, as not to thrill with something of the old  time feeling of love and longing as the memory of that tender face with its  watchful eye and ready smiles, comes back to you from the midst of weary years!  Your mother!</p>
  <p>But  Edward Sylvester with that black line across his life cutting past from  present, what makes him think of his mother to-night; and the cottage door upon  the hillside where she used to stand with eager eyes looking up and down the  road as he came trudging home from school, swinging his satchel and shouting at  every squirrel that started across the road or peeped from the branches of the  grand old maples overhead! And the garret-chamber under the roof, the scene of  many a romp with Elsie and Sonsie and Jack, neighbors&rsquo; children to whom the man  of to-day would be an awe and a mystery! And the little room where he slept  with Tom his own blue-eyed brother so soon to die of a wasting disease, but  full of warm blood then and all alive with boyish pranks. He could almost hear  the wild clear laugh with which the mischievous fellow started upon its  travels, the rooster whose legs he had tied a short space apart with one of  Sonsie&rsquo;s faded ribbons, a laugh that became unrestrained when the poor creature  in attempting to run down hill, rolled over and over, cutting such a figure  before his late admirers, the hens, that even Elsie smiled in the midst of her  gentle entreaties. And Jocko the crow, whom taming had made one of the boys!  poor Jocko! is it nearly thirty years since you used to stalk in majesty  through the village streets, with your neat raven coat closely buttoned across  your breast and your genteel caw, caw, and condescending nod for old  acquaintances? The day seems but as yesterday when you marred the stolen picnic  up in the woods by flying off with a flock of your fellow black-coats, nor is  it easy to realize that the circle of tow-headed fellows who hailed with shouts  your ignominious return after a day or so&rsquo;s experience of the vaunted pleasures  of freedom, are now sharp featured men without a smile for youth or a thought  beyond the hard cold dollar buried deep in their pockets.</p>
  <p>And  the church up over the hills! and the long Sunday walk at mother&rsquo;s side with  the sunshine glowing on the dusty road and beating on the river flowing far  beyond! The same road, the same river of Monday and Tuesday but how different  it looked to the boy; almost like another scene, as if Sunday clothes were on  the world as well as upon his restless little limbs. How he longed for it to be  Monday though he did not say so; and what a different day Saturday would have  been if only there was no long, sleepy Sunday to follow it.</p>
  <p>But  the mother! She did not dread that day. Her eyes used to brighten when the bell  began to ring from the old church steeple. Her eyes! how they mingled with  every picture! They seemed to fill the night. What a sparkle they had, yet how  they used to soften at his few hurried caresses. He was always too busy for  kisses; there were the snares in the north woods to be looked after; the nest  in the apple-tree to be inquired into; the skates to be ground before the river  froze over; the nuts to be gathered and stored in that same old garret chamber  under the eaves. But now how vividly her least look comes back to the tired  man, from the glance of wistful sympathy with which she met his childish  disappointments to the flash of joy that hailed his equally childish delights.</p>
  <p>And  another scene there is in the embers to-night; a remembrance of later days when  the mother with her love and yearning was laid low in the grave, and manhood  had learned its first lessons of passion and ambition from the glance of  younger eyes and the smile of riper lips. Not the picture of a woman, however;  that was already present beside him, shining from its panel with an insistence  that not even the putting out of the lights could quite quench or subdue, but  of a child young, pure and beautiful, sitting by the river in the glow of a  June sunshine, gazing at the hills of his boyhood&rsquo;s home with a look on her  face such as he had never before seen on that of child or woman. A simple  picture with a simple villager&rsquo;s daughter for its centre, but as he mused upon  it to-night, the success and triumph of the last ten years faded from his sight  like the ashes that fell at his feet, and he found himself questioning in vain  as to what better thing he had met in all the walks of his busy life than that  young child&rsquo;s innocence and faith as they shone upon him that day from her soft  uplifted eyes.</p>
  <p>He  had been sitting the whole warm noontide at the side of her whose half  gracious, half scornful, wholly indolent acceptance of his homage, he called  love, and enervated by an atmosphere he was as yet too inexperienced to  recognize as of the world, worldly, had strolled forth to cool his fevered brow  in the fresh autumn breeze that blew up from the river. He was a gay-hearted  youth in those days, heedless of everything but the passing moment; nature  meant little to him; and when in the course of his ramble he came upon the form  of a child sitting on the edge of the river, he remembers wondering what she  saw in a sweep of empty water to interest her so deeply. Indeed he was about to  inquire when she turned and he caught a glimpse of her eyes and knew at once  without asking. Yet in those days he was anything but quick to recognize the  presence of feeling. A face was beautiful or plain to him, not eloquent or  expressive. But this child&rsquo;s countenance was exceptional. It made you forget  the cotton frock she wore, it made you forget yourself. As he gazed on it, he  felt the stir of something in his breast he had never known before, and half  dreaded to hear her speak lest the charm should fail or the influence be lost.  Yet how could he pass on and not speak. Laying his hand on her head, he asked  her what she was thinking of as she sat there all alone looking off on the  river; and the wee thing drew in her breath and surveyed him with all her soul  in her great black eyes before she replied, &ldquo;I do not know, I never know.&rdquo; Then  looking back she dreamily added, &ldquo;It makes me want to go away, miles away,&rdquo;&mdash;and  she held out her tiny arms towards the river with a longing gesture; &ldquo;and it makes  me want to cry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  he understood or thought he did and for the first time in his life looked upon  the river that had met his gaze from childhood, with eyes that saw its  exceeding beauty. Ah it was an exquisite scene, a rare scene, mountain melting  into mountain and meadow vanishing into meadow, till the flow of silver waters  was lost in a horizon of azure mist. No wonder that a child without snares to  set or nuts to gather, should pause a moment to gaze upon it, as even he in the  days gone by would sometimes stop on Sabbath eves to snatch a kiss from his  mother&rsquo;s lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is like a fairy land, is it not?&rdquo; quoth the child looking up into his face with  a wistful glance. &ldquo;Do you know what it is that makes me feel so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  smiled and sat down by her side. Somehow he felt as if a talk with this  innocent one would restore him more than a walk on the hills. &ldquo;It is the spirit  of beauty, my child, you are moved by the loveliness of the scene; is it a new  one to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  oh no, but I always feel the same. As if something here was hungry, don&rsquo;t you  know?&rdquo; and she laid her little hand on her breast.</p>
  <p>He  did not know, but he smiled upon her notwithstanding, and made her talk and  talk till the gush of the sweet child spirit with its hidden longings and but  half understood aspirations, bathed his whole being in a reviving shower, and  he felt as if he had wandered into a new world where the languors of the  tropics were unknown, and passion, if there was such, had the wings of an eagle  instead of the siren&rsquo;s voice and fascination.</p>
  <p>Her  name was Paula, she said, and before leaving he found that she was a relative  of the woman he loved. This was a slight shock to him. The lily and the cactus  abloom on one stalk! How could that be? and for a moment he felt as if the  splendors of the glorious woman paled before the lustre of the innocent child.  But the feeling, if it was strong enough to be called such, soon passed. As the  days swept by bringing evenings with light and music and whispered words  beneath the vine-leaves, the remembrance of the pure, sweet hour beside the  river, gradually faded till only a vague memory of that gentle uplifted face  sweet with its childish dimples, remained to hallow now and then a passing  reverie or a fevered dream.</p>
  <p>But  to-night its every lineament filled his soul, vying with the memories of his  mother in its vividness and power. O why had he not learned the lesson it  taught. Why had he turned his back upon the high things of life to yield  himself to a current that swept him on and on until the power of resistance  left him and&mdash;O dwell not here wild thoughts! Pause not on the threshold of the  one dark memory that blasts the soul and sears the heart in the secret hours of  night. Let the dead past bury its dead and if one must think, let it be of the  hope, which the remembrance of that short glimpse into a pure if infantile soul  has given to his long darkened spirit.</p>
  <p>One,  two, three, FOUR; and the fire is dead and the night has grown chill, but he  heeds it not. He has asked himself if his life&rsquo;s book is quite closed to the  higher joys of existence? whether money getting and money holding is to absorb  him body and soul forever; and with the question a great yearning seizes him to  look upon that sweet child again, if haply in the gleam of her pure spirit, something  of the noble and the pure that lay beneath the crust of life might be again  revealed to his longing sight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  must be a great girl now,&rdquo; murmured he to himself, &ldquo;as old as if not older than  she whom Bertram adores so passionately, but she will always be a child to me,  a sweet pure child whose innocence is my teacher and whose ignorance is my  better wisdom. If anything will save me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  here the shadow settled again; when it lifted, the morning ray lay cool and  ghostly over the hearthstone.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
    Paula</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;The  stars of midnight shall be dear<br>
  To her; and she shall lean her ear<br>
  In many a  secret place <br>
  Where rivulets dance their wayward round, <br>
  And beauty born of  murmuring sound <br>
  Shall pass into her face.&rdquo;&mdash;Wordsworth. </p>
  <p>A  wintry scene. Snow-piled hills stretching beyond a frozen river. On the bank a  solitary figure tall, dark and commanding, standing with eyes bent sadly on a  long narrow mound at his feet. It is Edward Sylvester and the mound is the  grave of his mother.</p>
  <p>It  is ten years since he stood upon that spot. In all that time no memories of his  childhood&rsquo;s home, no recollection of that lonely grave among the pines, had  been sufficient to allure him from the city and its busy round of daily cares.  Indeed he had always shrunk at the very name of the place and never of his own  will alluded to it, but the reveries of a night had awakened a longing that was  not to be appeased, and in the face of his wife&rsquo;s cold look of astonishment and  a secret dread in his own heart, had left his comfortable fireside, for the  scenes of his early life and marriage, and was now standing, in the bleak  December air, gazing down upon the stone that marked his mother&rsquo;s grave.</p>
  <p>But  tender as were the chords that reverberated at this sight, it was not to  revisit this tomb he had returned to Grotewell. No, that other vision, the  vision of young sweet appreciative life has drawn him more strongly than the  memory of the dead. It was to search out and gaze again upon the innocent girl,  whose eloquent eyes and lofty spirit had so deeply moved him in the past, that  he had braved the chill of the Connecticut hills and incurred the displeasure  of his wife.</p>
  <p>Yet  when he turned away from that simple headstone and set his face towards the  village streets it was with a sinking of the heart that first revealed to him  the severity of the ordeal to which he had thus wantonly subjected himself. Not  that the wintry trees and snow covered roofs appealed to him as strongly as the  same trees and homes would have done in their summer aspect. The land was bright  with verdure when that shadow fell whose gloom resting upon all the landscape,  made a walk down this quiet road even at this remote day, a matter of such pain  to him. But scenes that have caught the reflection of a life&rsquo;s joy or a heart&rsquo;s  sorrow, lose not their power of appeal, with the leaves they shake from their  trees, and nothing that had met the eyes of this man from the hour he left this  spot, no, not the glance of his wife as his child fell back dead in his arms,  had shot such a pang to his soul as the sight of that long street with its  array of quiet homes, stretching out before him into the dim grey distance.</p>
  <p>But  for all that he was determined to traverse it, ay to the very end, though his  steps must pass the house whose ghostly portals were fraught with memories  dismal as death to him. On then he proceeded, walking with his usual steady  pace that only faltered or broke, as he met the shy eyes of some hurrying  village maiden, speeding upon some errand down the snowy street, or encountered  some old friend of his youth who despite his altered mien and commanding  carriage, recognized in him the slim young bank cashier who had left them now  ten long years ago to make a name and fortune in the great city.</p>
  <p>It  was noon by the time he gained the heart of the village, and school was out and  the children came rushing by with just the same shout and scamper with which he  used to hail that hour of joyous release. How it carried him back to the days  when those four red walls towered upon him with awful significance, as with  books on his back and a half eaten apple in his pocket he crept up the walk,  conscious that the bell had rung its last shrill note a good half hour before.  He felt half tempted to stop and make his way through the crowd of shouting  boys and dancing girls to that same old door again, and see for himself if the  huge LATE which in a fit of childish revenge he had cut on its awkward panels,  was still there to meet the eyes of tardy boys and loitering girls. But the  wondering looks of the children unused to behold a figure so stately in their  simple streets deterred him and he passed thoughtfully on. So engrossed was he  by the reminiscences of Tom and Elsie which the school house had awakened, that  he passed the ominous mansion which had been his dread, and the bank where he  had worked, and the arbor by the side of the road where he had sat out the  first hours of his fatal courtship, almost without realizing their presence,  and was at the end of the street and in full view of the humble cottage which  the little Paula had pointed out as her home on that day of their first  acquaintance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  heaven! and I do not even know if she is alive,&rdquo; he suddenly ejaculated,  stopping where he was and eying the lowly walls before him with a quick  realization of the possibilities of a great disappointment. &ldquo;Ten years have  strown many a grave on the hillside and Ona would not mention it if she lost  every relative she had in this town. What a fool I have been,&rdquo; thought he.</p>
  <p>But  with the stern resolution which had carried him through many a difficulty, he  prepared to advance, when he was again arrested by seeing the door of the house  he was contemplating, suddenly open and a girlish figure issue forth. Could it  be Paula? With eager, almost feverish interest he watched her approach. She was  a slight young thing and came towards him with a rapid movement almost jaunty  in its freedom. If it were Paula, he would know her by her eyes, but for some  reason he hoped it was not she, not the child of his dreams.</p>
  <p>At  a yard or two in front of him she paused astonished. This grave, tall figure  with the melancholy brow, deep eyes and firmly compressed lips was an  unaccustomed sight in this primitive town. Scarcely realizing what she did she  gave a little courtesy and was proceeding on when he stopped her with a hurried  gesture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  Mrs. Fairchild still living?&rdquo; he asked, indicating the house she had just left.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Fairchild? O no,&rdquo; she returned, surveying him out of the corner of a very  roguish pair of brown eyes, with a certain sly wonder at the suspense in his  voice. &ldquo;She has been dead as long as I can remember. Old Miss Abby and her  sister live there now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  who are they?&rdquo; he hurriedly asked; he could not bring himself to mention Paula&rsquo;s  name.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  Miss Abby and Miss Belinda,&rdquo; she returned with a puzzled air. &ldquo;Miss Abby sews  and Miss Belinda teaches the school. I don&rsquo;t know anything more about them,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  courteous gentleman bowed. &ldquo;And they live there quite alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O  no sir, Paula lives with them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  she does;&rdquo; and the young girl looking at him could not detect the slightest  change in his haughty countenance. &ldquo;Paula is Mrs. Fairchild&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; said he, and allowed the pretty brown-eyed miss to pass on, which she did  with lingering footsteps and many a backward glance of the eye.</p>
  <p>Halting  at the door of that small cottage, Edward Sylvester reasoned with himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  may be just such another fresh-looking, round-faced, mischievous-eyed  school-girl. Spiritual children do not always make earnest-souled women. Let me  beware what hopes I build on a foundation so unsubstantial.&rdquo; Yet when in a  moment later the door opened and a weazen-faced dapper, little woman appeared,  all smiles and welcome, he owned to a sensation of dismay that sufficiently  convinced him what a hold this hope of meeting with something exceptionally  sweet and high, had taken upon his hitherto careless and worldly spirit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Sylvester I am sure! I thought Ona would remember us after a while. Come in  sir, do, my sister will be home in a few moments.&rdquo; And with a deprecatory  flutter comical enough in a woman at least seventy odd years old, she led her  distinguished guest into a large unused room where in spite of his  remonstrances she at once proceeded to build a fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a pleasure sir,&rdquo; she said to every utterance of regret on his part at the  trouble he was causing. And though her vocabulary was thus made to appear  somewhat small, her sincerity was undoubted. &ldquo;We have counted the days, Belinda  and I, since we sent the last letter. It may seem foolish to you, sir; but  Paula is growing so fast and Belinda says is so uncommon smart for her age that  we did think that it was time Ona knew just what a straight we were in. Do you  want to see Paula?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  much,&rdquo; he returned, shocked and embarrassed at the position in which he found  himself put by the reticence of his wife on the subject of her relations. &ldquo;They  think I have come in reply to a letter,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;and I did not even know my  wife had received one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will be surprised,&rdquo; she exclaimed with a complacent nod as the fire blazed up  brightly; &ldquo;every one is surprised who sees her for the first time. Is my niece  well?&rdquo; And thus it was he learned the relation between his wife of ten years  and these simple inhabitants of the little cottage in Grotewell.</p>
  <p>He  replied as in duty bound, and presently by the use of a few dexterous questions  succeeded in eliciting from this simple-minded old lady, the few facts  necessary to a proper understanding of the situation. Miss Abby and Miss  Belinda were two maiden ladies, sisters of Mrs. Fairchild and Ona&rsquo;s mother, who  on the death of the former took up their abode in the little cottage for the  purpose of bringing up the orphan Paula. They had succeeded in this by dint of  the utmost industry, but Paula was not a common child, and Belinda, who was  evidently the autocrat of the house, had decided that she ought to have other  advantages. She had therefore written to Mrs. Sylvester concerning the child,  in the hopes that that lady would take enough interest in her pretty little  cousin to send her to boarding-school; but they had received no reply till now,  all of which was perfectly right of course, Mrs. Sylvester being undoubtedly  occupied and Mr. Sylvester himself being better than any letter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  does Paula herself know what efforts you have been making in her behalf,&rdquo; asked  Mr. Sylvester upon the receipt of this information.</p>
  <p>The  little lady shook her head with vivacity. &ldquo;Belinda advised me to say nothing,&rdquo;  she remarked. &ldquo;The child is contented with her home and we did not like to  raise her expectations. You will never regret anything you may do for her,&rdquo; she  went on in a hurried way with a peep now and then towards the door as if while  enjoying a momentary freedom of speech, she feared an intrusion that would cut  that pleasure short. &ldquo;Paula is a grateful child and never has given us a moment  of concern from the time she began to put pieces of patchwork together. But  there is Belinda,&rdquo; she suddenly exclaimed, rising with the little dip and jerk  of her left shoulder that was habitual to her whenever she was amused or  excited. &ldquo;Belinda,&rdquo; she cried, going to the door and speaking with great  impressiveness, &ldquo;Mr. Sylvester is in the parlor.&rdquo; And almost instantly a tall  middle aged lady entered, whose plain but powerful countenance and dignified  demeanor, stamped her at once as belonging to a very different type of woman  from her sister.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am very glad to see you sir,&rdquo; she exclaimed in a slow determined voice as  dissimilar as possible from the piping tones of Miss Abby. &ldquo;Is not Mrs.  Sylvester with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  returned he, &ldquo;I have come alone; my wife is not fond of travelling in winter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  slightest gleam shot from her bright keen eye. &ldquo;Is she not well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  quite well, but not over strong,&rdquo; he rejoined quietly.</p>
  <p>She  gave him another quick look, settled some matter with herself and taking off  her bonnet, sat down by the fire. At once her sister ceased in her hovering  about the room and sitting also, became to all appearance her silent shadow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula  has gone up stairs to take off her bonnet,&rdquo; the younger woman said in a  straightforward manner just short of being brusque. &ldquo;She is a very remarkable  girl, Mr. Sylvester, a genius I suppose some would call her, a child of nature  I prefer to say. Whatever there is to be learned in this town she has learned.  And in a place where nature speaks and good books abound that is not  inconsiderable. I have taken pride in her talents I acknowledge, and have  endeavored to do what I could to cultivate them to the best advantage. There is  no girl in my school who can write so original a composition, nor is there one  with a truer heart or more tractable disposition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have then been her teacher as well as her friend, she owes you a double debt of  gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  look hard to understand flashed over her homely face. &ldquo;I have never thought of  debt or gratitude in connection with Paula. The only effort which I have ever  made in her behalf which cost me anything, is this one which threatens me with  her loss.&rdquo; Then as if fearing she had said too much, set her firm lips still  firmer and ignoring the subject of the child, astonished him by certain  questions on the leading issues of the day that at once betrayed a truly virile  mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is a study,&rdquo; thought he to himself, but meeting her on the ground she had  taken, replied at once and to her evident satisfaction in the direct and simple  manner that appeals the most forcibly to a strong if somewhat unpolished  understanding, while the meek little Miss Abby glanced from one to the other  with a humble awe more indicative of her appreciation for their superiority  than of her comprehension of the subject.</p>
  <p>But  what with Miss Belinda&rsquo;s secret anxiety and Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s unconscious  listening for a step upon the stair, the conversation, brisk as it had opened,  gradually languished, and ere long with a sort of clairvoyant understanding of  her sister&rsquo;s wishes, Miss Abby arose and with her customary jerk left the room  for Paula.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  child is not timid but has an unaccountable aversion to entering the presence  of strangers alone,&rdquo; Miss Belinda explained; but Mr. Sylvester did not hear  her, for at that moment the door re-opened and Miss Abby stepped in with the  young girl thus heralded.</p>
  <p>Edward  Sylvester never forgot that moment, and indeed few men could have beheld the  picture of extraordinary loveliness thus revealed, without a shock of surprise  equal to the delight it inspired. She was not pretty; the very word was a  misnomer, she was simply one of nature&rsquo;s most exquisite and undeniable  beauties. From the crown of her ebon locks to the sole of her dainty foot, she  was perfect as the most delicate coloring and the utmost harmony of contour  could make her. And not in the conventional type either. There was an  individuality in her style that was as fresh as it was uncommon. She was at  once unique and faultless, something that can be said of few women however  beautiful or alluring.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester had not expected this, as indeed how could he, and for a moment he  could only gaze with a certain swelling of the heart at the blooming loveliness  that in one instant had transformed the odd little parlor into a bower fit for  the habitation of princes. But soon his natural self-possession returned, and  rising with his most courteous bow, he greeted the blushing girl with words of  simple welcome.</p>
  <p>Instantly  her eyes which had been hitherto kept bent upon the floor flashed upward to his  face and a smile full of the wonder of an unlooked for, almost unhoped for  delight, swept radiantly over her lips, and he saw with deep and sudden  satisfaction that the hour which had made such an impression upon him, had not  been forgotten by her; that his voice had recalled what his face failed to do,  and that he was recognized.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is Mr. Sylvester, your cousin Ona&rsquo;s husband,&rdquo; Miss Belinda interposed in a  matter-of-fact way, evidently attributing the emotion of the child to her  astonishment at the imposing appearance of their guest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  it was <i>you</i> who married Ona!&rdquo; she involuntarily murmured, blushing the  next moment at this simple utterance of her thoughts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  dear child,&rdquo; Mr. Sylvester hastened to say. &ldquo;And so you remember me?&rdquo; he  presently added, smiling down upon her with a sense of new life that for the  moment made every care and anxiety shrink into the background.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she simply returned, taking the chair beside him with the unconscious grace of  perfect self-forgetfulness. &ldquo;It was the first time I had found any one to  listen to my childish enthusiasms; it is natural such kindness should make its  impression.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Little  Paula and I met long ago,&rdquo; quoth Mr. Sylvester turning to the somewhat  astonished Miss Belinda. &ldquo;It was before my marriage and she was then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  ten years old,&rdquo; finished Paula, seeing him cast her an inquiring glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  young for such a thoughtful little miss,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;And have those  childish enthusiasms quite departed?&rdquo; he continued, smiling upon her with  gentle encouragement. &ldquo;Do you no longer find a fairy-land in the view up the  river?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  flushed, casting a timid glance at her aunt, but meeting his eyes again seemed  to forget everything and everybody in the inspiration which his presence  afforded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear I must acknowledge that it is more a fairy-land to me than ever,&rdquo; she  softly replied. &ldquo;Knowledge does not always bring disillusion, and though I have  learned one by one the names of the towns scattered along those misty banks,  and though I know they are no less prosaic in their character than our own  humdrum village, yet I cannot rid myself of the notion that those verdant  slopes with their archway of clouds, hide the portals of Paradise, and that I  have only to follow the birds in their flight up the river to find myself on  the verge of a mystery, the banks at my feet can never disclose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  the gates of God&rsquo;s Paradise never recede as those would do, my child, if like  the birds you attempted to pierce them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula  is a dreamer,&rdquo; quoth Miss Belinda in a matter-of-fact tone, &ldquo;but she is a good  girl notwithstanding and can solve a geometrical problem with the best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  sew on the machine and make a very good pie,&rdquo; timidly put in Miss Abby.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is well,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Sylvester, observing that the poor child&rsquo;s head had  fallen forward in maidenly shame at her aunts&rsquo; elogiums as well as at the  length of the speech into which she had been betrayed. &ldquo;It shows that her eyes  can see what is at hand as well as what is beyond our reach.&rdquo; Then with a touch  of his usual formal manner intended to restore her to herself, &ldquo;Do you like  study, Paula?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  an instant her eyes flashed. &ldquo;I more than like it; it feeds me. Knowledge has  its vistas too,&rdquo; she added with an arch look, the first he had seen on her  hitherto serious countenance. &ldquo;I can never outgrow my recognition of the  portals it discloses or the fairy-land it opens up to every inquiring eye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even  geometry,&rdquo; he ventured, more anxious to probe this fresh young mind than he had  ever been to sound the opinions of the most notable men of the day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even  geometry,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;To be sure its portals are somewhat methodical in  shape, allowing no scope to the fancy, but from its triangles and circles have  been born the grandeurs of architecture, and upright on the threshold of its  exact laws and undeviating calculations, I see an angel with a golden rod in  his hand, measuring the heavens.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even  a stone speaks to a poet,&rdquo; said Mr. Sylvester with a glance at Miss Belinda.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Paula is no poet,&rdquo; returned that lady with strict and impartial honesty. &ldquo;She  has never put a line on paper to my knowledge. Have you child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  aunt, I would as soon imprison a falling sunbeam or try to catch the breeze  that lifts my hair or kisses my cheek.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see,&rdquo; continued Mr. Sylvester still looking at Miss Belinda.</p>
  <p>She  answered with a doubtful shake of the head and an earnest glance at the girl as  if she perceived something in that bright young soul, that even she had never  observed before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you ever been away from home?&rdquo; he now asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never,  I know as little of the great world as a callow nestling. No, I should not say  that, for the young bird has no Aunt Belinda to tell of the great cathedrals  and the wonderful music she has heard and the glorious pictures she has seen in  her visits to the city. It is almost as good as travelling one&rsquo;s self to hear  Aunt Belinda talk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was now the turn of the mature plain woman to blush, which she did under Mr.  Sylvester&rsquo;s searching eye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have then been in the habit of visiting New York?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have been there twice,&rdquo; she returned evasively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Since  my marriage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  sir;&rdquo; with a firm closing of her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not know you were there or I should have insisted upon your remaining at my  house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; said she with a quick triumphant glance at her demure little shadow, who  looked back in amaze and was about to speak when Miss Belinda proceeded. &ldquo;My  visits usually have been on business; I should not think of troubling Mrs.  Sylvester.&rdquo; And then he knew that his wife had been aware of those visits if he  had not.</p>
  <p>But  he refrained from testifying to his discovery. &ldquo;You speak of music,&rdquo; said he,  turning gently back to Paula. &ldquo;Have you a taste for it? Would it make you happy  to hear such music as your aunt tells about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O  yes, I can conceive nothing grander than to sit in a church whose every line is  beauty and listen while the great organ utters its song of triumph or echoes in  the wonderful way it does, the emotions you have tried to express and could  not. I would give a whole week of my life on the hills, dear as it is, for one  such hour, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester smiled. &ldquo;It is a rare kind of coin to offer for such a simple  pleasure, but it may meet with its acceptance, nevertheless;&rdquo; and in his look  and in his voice there was an appearance of affectionate interest that  completed the subjugation of the watchful Miss Belinda, who now became doubly  assured that whatever neglect had been shown her by her niece was not due to  that niece&rsquo;s husband.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester recognized the effect he had produced and hastened to complete it,  feeling that the good opinion of Miss Belinda would be valuable to any man. &ldquo;I  have been a boy on these hills,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and know what it is to long for what  is beyond while enjoying what is present. You shall hear the organ my child.&rdquo;  And stopped, wondering to himself over the new sweet interest he seemed to take  in the prospect of pleasures which he had supposed himself to have long ago exhausted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hear  the organ, I? why that means&mdash;O what does it mean?&rdquo; she inquired, turning with a  look of beaming hope towards her aunt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must ask Mr. Sylvester,&rdquo; that uncompromising lady replied, with a  straightforward look at the fire.</p>
  <p>And  he with a smile told the blushing girl that according to his reading, mortals  went blindfold into fairy-land; and she understood what he meant and was  silent, whereupon he turned the conversation upon more common-place subjects.</p>
  <p>For  how could he tell her then of the intention that had awakened in his breast at  the first glimpse of her grand young beauty. To make her his child, to bequeath  to her the place of the babe that had perished in his arms three long years  before&mdash;That meant to give Ona a care if not a rival in his affections, and Ona  shrank from care, and was not a subject for rivalry. And the <i>if</i> which  this implied weighed heavily on his heart as moment after moment flew by, and  he felt again the reviving power of an unsullied mind and an aspiring nature.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
    The Barred Door</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;A  school boy&rsquo;s tale; the wonder of an hour.&rdquo;&mdash;Byron.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you know that your niece was gifted with rare beauty as well as talents?&rdquo; asked  Mr. Sylvester of Miss Belinda as a couple of hours or so later, they sat alone  by the parlor fire, preparatory to his departure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  that is,&rdquo; she hastily corrected herself, &ldquo;I knew she was very pretty of course,  prettier by far than any of her mates, but I did not suppose she was what you  call a beauty, or at least would be so considered by a person accustomed to New  York society.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know of a woman in New York who can boast of any such claims to  transcendent loveliness. Such faces are rare outside of art, Miss Belinda; was  Mrs. Fairchild a handsome woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was my sister and if I may say so, my favorite sister, but she was no more  agreeable to the eye than some others of her family,&rdquo; grimly returned the heavy  browed spinster with a compression of her lips. &ldquo;What beauty Paula has  inherited came from her father. Her chief charm in my eyes, however, springs  from her pure nature and the unselfish impulses of her heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  in mine,&rdquo; rejoined he quietly. Then with a sudden change of tone as he realized  the necessity of saying something definite to this woman in regard to his  intentions toward the child, he remarked, &ldquo;Her great and unusual talents and  manifest disposition to learn, demand as you say, superior advantages to any  she can have in a small country town like this, fruitful as it has already been  to her under your wise and fostering care and such shall she have; but just  when and how I cannot say till I have seen my wife and learned what her wishes  are likely to be in regard to the subject.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are very kind, sir,&rdquo; returned Miss Belinda. &ldquo;I have no doubt as to the  good-will of your intentions, and the child shall be prepared at once for a  change.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  will <i>the child</i>,&rdquo; he exclaimed with a smile as Paula re-entered the room,  &ldquo;be so kind as to give me her company in the walk I must now take to the cars?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; replied her aunt before the young girl could speak, &ldquo;we owe you that  much attention I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  so it was that when he came to retrace his way through the village with its  heavy memories, he had a guardian spirit at his side that robbed them of their  power to sadden and oppress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  shall I say for you to the grim, city streets when I get back?&rdquo; inquired he as  they hastened on over the snow covered road.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say  to them from me? O you may give them my greeting,&rdquo; she responded half shyly,  half confidingly. Evidently for her he was one of those rare persons whose  presence is perfect freedom and with whom she could not only think her best but  speak it also. &ldquo;I should like to make their acquaintance, but indeed they would  have to do well to vie in attraction with these white roads girded by their  silver-limbed trees. The very rush of life must seem oppressive. So many hopes,  so many fears, so many interests jostling you at every step! Yet the thought is  exhilarating too; don&rsquo;t you find it so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was the first question she had asked him and he knew not how to reply. Her eyes  were so confiding, he could not bear to shake her faith in his imagined  superiority. Yet what thoughts had he ever cherished in walking the busy  streets, save those connected with his own selfish hopes and fears, plans and  operations? &ldquo;I have no doubt,&rdquo; said he after a moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;that I have  felt this exhilaration of which you speak. Certainly the hurrying masses in  Broadway awaken a far different sensation in a man, than this solitary stretch  of country road.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  the road has its companionships,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;In the city one thinks most of  men, but in the country, of God. Its very solitude compels you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Compels <i>you</i>,&rdquo; he involuntarily answered. And shuddered as he said it,  remembering days when he trod these very roads with anything but reverence in  his heart for the Creator of the landscape before him. &ldquo;Not every one has the  inner vision, my child, to see the love and wisdom back of the works, or rather  most men have a vision so short it does not reach so far. Yet I think I can  understand what you mean and might even experience your emotions if my eyes had  leisure to explore this space and my thoughts to rise out of their usual  depressing atmosphere of care and anxiety. You did not think I was a busy man,  he continued,&rdquo; observing her gaze of wonder. &ldquo;You thought riches brought ease;  if you ever come to think, &lsquo;most of men&rsquo; you will learn that the wealthy man is  the greatest worker, for his rest comes not night or day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  shook her head with a sudden doubt. &ldquo;It is a problem,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;which my  knowledge of geometry does not help me to solve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  assented he; &ldquo;and one in which even your fanciful soul would fail to find any  poetry. But stop, Paula; isn&rsquo;t this the place where I found you that day, and  you showed me the view up the river?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and it was on that stone I sat; it has a milk-white cushion now; and there is  where you stood, looking so tall and grand to my childish eyes! The gates are  of pearl now,&rdquo; she said, pointing to the snow-covered slopes in the west. &ldquo;I  wish the sky had been clear to-night and you could have seen the effect of a  rosy sunset falling over those domes of ice and snow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would leave me less to expect when I come again,&rdquo; he responded almost gayly. &ldquo;The  next time we will have the sunset, Paula.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  smiled and they hastened on, presently finding themselves in the village  streets. Suddenly she paused. &ldquo;Small towns have their mysteries as well as  great cities,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;we are not without ours, look.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  turned, followed with a glance the direction of her pointing finger and started  in his sudden surprise. She had indicated to him the house whose ghostly and  frowning front bore written across its grim gray boards, such an inscription of  painful remembrance. &ldquo;It is a solitary looking place, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she went on,  innocent of the pain she was inflicting. &ldquo;No one lives there or ever will, I  imagine. Do you see that board nailed across the front door?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  forced himself to look. He did more, he fixed his eyes upon the desolate  structure before him until the aspect of its huge unpainted walls with their  long rows of sealed-up windows and high smokeless chimneys was impressed  indelibly upon his mind. The large front door with its weird and solemn barrier  was the last thing upon which his eye rested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said he, and involuntarily asked what it meant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  do not know exactly,&rdquo; she responded. &ldquo;It was nailed across there by the men who  followed Colonel Japha to the grave. Colonel Japha was the owner of the house,&rdquo;  she proceeded, too interested to observe the shadow which the utterance of that  name had invoked upon his brow. &ldquo;He was a peculiar man I judge, and had  suffered great wrongs they say; at all events his life was very solitary and  sad, and on his deathbed he made his neighbors promise him that they would  carry out his body through that door and then seal it up against any further  ingress or egress forever. His wishes were respected, and from that day to this  no one has ever entered that door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the house!&rdquo; stammered Mr. Sylvester in anything but his usual tone, &ldquo;surely it  has not been deserted all these years!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  said she, &ldquo;now we come to the greatest mystery of all.&rdquo; And laying her hand  timidly on his arm, she drew his attention to the form of a decrepit old lady  just then advancing towards them down the street &ldquo;Do you see that aged figure?&rdquo;  she asked. &ldquo;Every evening at this hour, winter and summer, stormy weather or  clear, she is seen to leave her home up the street and come down to this  forsaken dwelling, open the worm-eaten gate before you, cross the otherwise  untrodden garden and enter the house by a side door which she opens with a huge  key she carries in her pocket. For just one hour by the clock she remains  there, and then she is seen to issue in the falling dusk, with a countenance  whose heavy dejection is in striking contrast to the expression of hope with  which she invariably enters. Why she makes this pilgrimage and for what purpose  she secludes herself for a stated time each day in this otherwise deserted mansion,  no man knows nor is it possible to determine, for though she is a worthy woman  and approachable enough on all other topics, on this she is absolutely mute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester started and surveyed the woman as she passed with an anxious gaze. &ldquo;I  know her,&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;she was a connection of&mdash;of the family, who inhabited  this house.&rdquo; He could not speak the name.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  so they say, and the owner of this house, though she does not live here. Did  you notice how she looked at me? She often does that, just as if she wanted to  speak. But she always goes by and opens the gate as you see her now and takes  out the big key and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  away,&rdquo; cried Mr. Sylvester with sudden impulse, seizing Paula by the hand and  hurrying her down the street. &ldquo;She is a walking goblin; you must have nothing  to do with such uncanny folk.&rdquo; And endeavoring to turn off this irresistible  display of feeling by a show of pleasantry he laughed aloud, but in a strained  and unnatural way that made her eyes lift in unconscious amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are infected by the atmosphere of unreality that pervades the spot,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I  do not wonder.&rdquo; And with the gentle perversity that sometimes affects the most  thoughtful amongst us, she went on talking upon the unwelcome subject. &ldquo;I know  of some folks who invariably cross to the other side of the street at night,  rather than go through the shadows of the two gaunt poplars which guard that  house. Yet there has been no murder committed there or any great crime that I  know of, unless the disobedience of a daughter who ran away with a man her  father detested, could be denominated by so fearful a word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  set gaze with which Mr. Sylvester surveyed the landscape before him quavered a  trifle and then grew hard and cold. &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said he in a tone meant more for himself  than her, &ldquo;even your innocent ears have been assailed by the gossip about Miss  Japha.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gossip!  I have never thought of it as gossip,&rdquo; returned she, struck for the first time  by the change in his appearance. &ldquo;It all happened so long ago it seems more  like some quaint and ancient tale than a story of one of our neighbors.  Besides, the fact that a wilful girl ran away from the house of her father,  with the man of her choice, is not such a dreadful one is it, though she never  returned to its walls with her husband, and her father was so overwhelmed by  the shock, he was never seen to smile again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said he, giving her a hurried glance of relief, &ldquo;I only wondered at the  tenacity of old stories to engage the popular ear. I had supposed even the  remembrance of Jacqueline Japha would have been lost in the long silence that  has followed that one disobedient act.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so it might, were it not for that closely shut house with the sinister bar  across its chief entrance, inviting curiosity while it effectually precludes  all investigation. With that token ever before our eyes of a dead man&rsquo;s  implacable animosity, who can wonder that we sometimes ponder over the fate of  her who was its object.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  no intimations of that fate have been ever received in Grotewell. For all that  is known to the contrary, Jacqueline Japha may have preceded her father to the  tomb.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paula  bowed her head, amazed at the gloomy tone in which this emphatic assertion was  made by one whose supposed ignorance she had been endeavoring to enlighten. &ldquo;You  knew her history before, then,&rdquo; observed she, &ldquo;I beg your pardon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  it is granted,&rdquo; said he with a sudden throwing off of the shadow that had  enveloped him. &ldquo;You must not mind my sudden lapses into gloom. I was never a  cheerful man, that is, not since I&mdash;since my early youth I should say. And the  shadows which are short at your time of life grow long and chilly at mine. One  thing can illumine them though, and that is a child&rsquo;s happy smile. You are a  child to me; do not deny me a smile, then, before I go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  one nor a dozen,&rdquo; cried she, giving him her hands in good-bye for they had  arrived at the depot by this time and the sound of the approaching train was  heard in the distance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God  bless you!&rdquo; said he, clasping those hands with a father&rsquo;s heartfelt tenderness.  &ldquo;God bless my little Paula and make her pillow soft till we meet again!&rdquo; Then  as the train came sweeping up the track, put on his brightest look and added, &ldquo;If  the fairy-godmother chances to visit you during my departure, don&rsquo;t hesitate to  obey her commands, if you want to hear the famous organ peal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no,&rdquo; she cried. And with a final look and smile he stepped upon the train and  in another moment was whirled away from that place of many memories and a  solitary hope.</p>

    Miss Stuyvesant</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;She  smiled; but he could see arise <br>
  Her soul from far adown her eyes.&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs.  Browning. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is a beauty; it is only right I should forewarn you of that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dark  or light?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dark;  that is her hair and eyes are almost oriental in their blackness, but her skin  is fair, almost as dazzling as yours, Ona.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Sylvester threw a careless glance in the long mirror before which she was  slowly completing her toilet, and languidly smiled. But whether at this covert  compliment to her greatest charm or at some passing fancy of her own, it would  be difficult to decide. &ldquo;The dark hair and eyes come from her father,&rdquo; remarked  she in an abstracted way while she tried the effect of a bunch of snow-white  roses at her waist with a backward toss of her proud blonde head. &ldquo;His mother  was a Greek. &lsquo;Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon,&rsquo;&ldquo;  she exclaimed in a voice as nearly gay as her indolent nature would allow. For  this lady of fashion was in one of her happiest moods. Her dress, a new one, fitted  her to perfection and the vision mirrored in the glass before her was not  lacking, so far as she could see in one charm that could captivate. &ldquo;Do you  think she could fasten a ribbon, or arrange a bow?&rdquo; she further inquired. &ldquo;I  should like to have some one about me with a knack for helping a body in an  emergency, if possible. Sarah is absolutely the destruction of any bit of  ribbon she undertakes to handle. Look at that knot of black velvet over there  for instance, wouldn&rsquo;t you think a raw Irish girl just from the other side  would have known better than to tie it with half the wrong side showing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  the habit long ago acquired of glancing wherever her ivory finger chanced to  point, the grave man of the world slowly turned his head full of the weightiest  cares and oppressed by the burden of innumerable responsibilities, and surveyed  the cluster of velvet bows thus indicated, with a mechanical knitting of the  brows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  pay Sarah twenty-five dollars a month and that is the result,&rdquo; his wife  proceeded. &ldquo;Now if Paula&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula  is not to come here as a waiting maid,&rdquo; her husband quickly interposed, a  suspicion of color just showing itself for a moment on his cheek.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  Paula,&rdquo; his wife went on, unheeding the interruption save by casting him a  hurried glance over the shoulder of her own reflection in the glass, &ldquo;had the  taste in such matters of some other members of our family and could manage to  lend me a helping hand now and then, why I could almost imagine I had my  younger sister back with me again, who with her skill in making one look fit  for the eyes of the world, was such a blessing to us in our old home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no doubt Paula could be taught to be equally efficient,&rdquo; her husband  responded, carefully restraining any further show of impatience. &ldquo;She is bright,  I am certain, and ribbon-tying is not such a very difficult art, is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know about that; by the way Sarah succeeds I should say it was about on a  par with the science of algebra or&mdash;what is that horrid study they used to  threaten to inflict me with at the academy whenever I complained of a headache?  Oh I remember&mdash;conic sections.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  well,&rdquo; laughed her husband, &ldquo;she ought soon to to be an expert in it then;  Paula is a famous little mathematician.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  silence followed this response; Mrs. Sylvester was fitting in her ear-rings. &ldquo;I  suppose,&rdquo; said she when the operation was completed, &ldquo;that the snow will  prevent half the people from coming to-night.&rdquo; It was a reception evening at  the Sylvester mansion. &ldquo;But so long as Mrs. Fitzgerald does not disappoint me,  I do not care. What do you think of the setting of these diamonds?&rdquo; she  inquired, leaning forward to look at herself more closely, and slowly shaking  her head till the rich gems sparkled like fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is good,&rdquo; came in short, quick tones from the lips of her husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I don&rsquo;t know, there might be a shade more of enamel on the edge of that ring. I  shall speak to the jeweller about it to-morrow. But what were we talking about?&rdquo;  she dreamily asked, still turning her head from side to side before the mirror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  were talking about adopting your cousin in the place of our child who is dead,&rdquo;  replied her husband with some severity, pausing in the middle of the floor  which he was pacing, to honor her with a steady glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O  yes! Dear me! what an awkward clasp that man has given to these rings after  all. You will have to fasten them for me.&rdquo; Then as he stepped forward with  studied courtesy, yawned just a trifle and remarked, &ldquo;No one could ever take  the place of one&rsquo;s own child of course. If Geraldine had lived she would have  been a blonde, her eyes were blue as sapphires.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  looked in his wife&rsquo;s face and his hands dropped. He thought of the day when  those eyes, blue as sapphires indeed, flashed burning with death&rsquo;s own fever,  from the little crib in the nursery, while with this same cool and  self-satisfied countenance, the wife and mother before him had swept down the  broad stairs to her carriage, murmuring apologetically as she gathered up her  train, &ldquo;O you needn&rsquo;t trouble yourself to look after her, she will do very well  with Sarah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  may have thought of it too, for the least little bit of real crimson found its  way through the rouge on her cheek as she encountered the stern look of his  eye, but she only turned a trifle more towards the glass, saying, &ldquo;I forgot you  do not admire the r&ocirc;le of waiting maid. I will try and manage them myself,  seeing that you have banished Sarah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  exerted his self-control and again for the thousandth time buried that ghastly  memory out of sight, actually forcing himself to smile as he gently took her  hand from her ear and began deftly to fasten the rebellious ornaments.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mistake,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;love can ask any favor without hesitation. I do not object  to waiting upon my own wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  gave him a little look which he obligingly took as a guerdon for this speech,  and languidly held out her bracelets. As he stood clasping them on her arms,  she quietly eyed him over from head to foot. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know of a man who has  your figure,&rdquo; said she with a certain tone of pride in her voice; &ldquo;it is well  you married a wife who does not look altogether inferior beside you.&rdquo; Then as  he bowed with mock appreciation of the intended compliment, added with her  usual inconsequence, &ldquo;I dare say it would give me something to interest myself  in. I don&rsquo;t suppose she has a decent thing to wear, and the fact of her being a  dark beauty would lend quite a new impulse to my inventive faculty. Mrs. Walker  has a daughter with black eyes, but dear me, what a guy she does make of her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a sigh Mr. Sylvester turned to the window where he stood looking out at the  heavy flakes of snow falling with slow and fluctuating movement between him and  the row of brown stone houses in front. Paula considered as a milliner&rsquo;s block  upon which to try the effect of clothes!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even  Mrs. Fitzgerald with all her taste don&rsquo;t know how to dress her child,&rdquo;  proceeded his wife, with a hurried, &ldquo;Be still, Cherry!&rdquo; to the importunate bird  in the cage. &ldquo;Now I should take as much pride in dressing any one under my  charge as I would myself, provided the subject was likely to do credit to my  efforts.&rdquo; And finding the bird incorrigible in his shrill singing, she moved  over to the cage, where she stood balancing her white finger for the bird to  peck at, with a pretty caressing motion of her lip, the little Geraldine of the  wistful blue eyes, had never seen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are welcome to do what you please in such matters,&rdquo; was her husband&rsquo;s reply. He  was thinking again of that same little Geraldine; a fall of snow like the  present always made him think of her and her innocent query as to whether God  threw down such big flakes to amuse little children. &ldquo;I give you <i>carte  blanche</i>,&rdquo; said he with sudden emphasis.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Sylvester paused in her attentions to the bird to give him a sharp little look  which might have aroused his surprise if he had been fortunate enough to see  it. But his back was towards her, and there was nothing in the languidly  careless tone with which she responded, to cause him to turn his head. &ldquo;I see  that you would really like to have me entertain the child; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  paused, pursing up her lips to meet the chattering bird&rsquo;s caress, while her  husband in his impatience drummed with his fingers on the pane.</p>
  <p>&mdash;&ldquo;I  must see her before I decide upon the length of her visit,&rdquo; continued she, as  weary with the sport she drew back to give herself a final look in the glass. &ldquo;Will  you please to hand me that shawl, Edward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  turned with alacrity. In his relief he could have kissed the snowy neck held so  erectly before him, as he drew around it the shawl he had hastily lifted from  the chair at his side. But that would not have suited this calm and languid  beauty who disliked any too overt tribute to her charms and saved her caresses  for her bird. Besides it would look like gratitude, and gratitude would be  misplaced towards a wife who had just indicated her acceptance of his offer to  receive a relative of her own into his house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  might as well come at once,&rdquo; was her final remark, as satisfied at last with  the lay of every ribbon she swept in finished elegance from the room. &ldquo;Mrs.  Kittredge&rsquo;s reception comes off a week from Thursday, and I should like to see  how a dark beauty with a fair skin would look in that new shade of heliotrope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  so the battle was over and the victory won; for Mrs. Sylvester for all her  seeming indifference was never known to change a decision she had once made. As  he realized the fact, as he meditated that ere long this very room which had  been the scene of so much frivolity and the witness to so many secret  heart-burnings, would re&euml;cho to the tread of the pure and innocent child, whose  mind had flights unknown to the slaves of fashion, and in whose heart lay  impulses of goodness that would satisfy the long smothered cravings of his  awakened nature, he experienced a feeling of relenting towards the wife who had  not chosen to thwart him in this the strongest wish of his childless manhood,  and crossing to her dressing table, he dropped among its treasures a costly  ring which he had been induced to purchase that day from an old friend who had  fallen into want. &ldquo;She will wear it,&rdquo; murmured he to himself, &ldquo;for its hue will  make her hand look still whiter, and when I see it sparkle I will remember this  hour and be patient.&rdquo; Had he known that she had yielded to this wish out of a certain  vague feeling of compunction for the disappointments she had frequently  occasioned him and would occasion him again, he might have added a tender  thought to the rich and costly gift with which he had just endowed her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  expect a young cousin of mine to spend the winter with me and pursue her  studies,&rdquo; were the first words that greeted his ears as an hour or so later he  entered the parlor where his wife was entertaining what few guests had been  anxious enough for a sight of Mrs. Sylvester&rsquo;s newly furnished drawing-room, to  brave the now rapidly falling snow. &ldquo;I hope that you and she will be friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Curious  to see what sort of a companion his wife was thus somewhat prematurely  providing for Paula, he hastily advanced towards the little group from which  her voice had proceeded, and found himself face to face with a brown-haired  girl whose appealing glance and somewhat infantile mouth were in striking  contrast to the dignity with which she carried her small head and managed her  whole somewhat petite person.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Stuyvesant! my husband!&rdquo; came in musical tones from his wife, and somewhat  surprised to hear a name that but a moment before had been the uppermost in his  mind, he bowed with courtesy and then asked if he was so happy as to speak to a  daughter of Thaddeus Stuyvesant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it will give you especial pleasure I will say yes,&rdquo; responded the little miss  with a smile that irradiated her whole face. &ldquo;Do you know my father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are but few bankers in the city who have not that pleasure,&rdquo; replied he with an  answering look of regard. &ldquo;I am especially happy to meet his daughter in my  house to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was something in his manner of saying this and in the short inquiring glance  which at every opportunity he cast upon her bright young face with its nameless  charm of mingled appeal and reserve, that astonished his wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Stuyvesant was in the carriage with Mrs. Fitzgerald,&rdquo; said that lady with a  certain dignity she knew well how to assume. &ldquo;I am afraid if it had not been  for that circumstance we should not have enjoyed the pleasure of her presence.&rdquo;  And with the rare tact of which she was certainly a mistress, as far as all  social matters were concerned, she left the aspiring magnate of Wall Street to  converse with the daughter of the man whom all New York bankers were expected  to know, and hastened to join a group of ladies discussing ceramics before a  huge placque of rarest <i>cloissone</i>.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester followed her with his eyes; he had never seen her look more  vivacious; had the hope of seeing a young face at their board touched some  secret chord in her nature as well as his? Was she more of a woman than he  imagined, and would she be, though in the most superficial of ways, a mother to  Paula? Flushed with the thought, he turned back to the little lady at his side.  She was gazing in an intent and thoughtful way at an engraving of Dubufe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prodigal  Son&rdquo; that adorned the wall above her head. There was something in her face that  made him ask:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that a favorite picture of yours?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  smiled and nodded her small and delicate head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  sir, it is indeed, but I was not looking at the picture so much as at the face  of that dark-haired girl that sits in the centre, with that far-away expression  in her eyes. Do you see what I mean? She is like none of the rest. Her form is  before us, but her heart and her interest are in some distant clime or forsaken  home to which the music murmured at her side recalls her. She has a soul above  her surroundings, that girl; and her face is indescribably pathetic to me. In  the recesses of her being she carries a memory or a regret that separates her  from the world and makes certain moments of her life almost holy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  look deep,&rdquo; said Mr. Sylvester, gazing down upon the little lady&rsquo;s face with  strongly awakened interest. &ldquo;You see more perhaps than the painter intended.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no; possibly more than the engraving expresses, but not more than the artist  intended. I saw the original once, when as you remember it was on exhibition  here. I was a wee thing, but I never forgot that girl&rsquo;s face. It spoke more  than all the rest to me; perhaps because I so much honor reserve in one who  holds in his breast a great pain or a great hope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  eye that was resting upon her, softened indescribably. &ldquo;You believe in great  hopes,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>The  little figure seemed to grow tall; and her face looked almost beautiful. &ldquo;What  would life be without them?&rdquo; she answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo;  returned Mr. Sylvester; and entering into the conversation with unusual spirit,  was astonished to find how young she was and yet how thoroughly bright and  self-possessed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lovely  girls are cropping up around me in all directions,&rdquo; thought he; &ldquo;I shall have  to correct my judgment concerning our young ladies of fashion if I encounter  many more as sensible and earnest-hearted as this.&rdquo; And for some reason his  brow grew so light and his tone so cheerful that the ladies were attracted from  all parts of the room to hear what the demure Miss Stuyvesant could have to say  to the grave master of the house, to call forth such smiles of enjoyment upon  his usually melancholy countenance.</p>
  <p>Take  it all together, the occasion though small was one of the pleasantest of the  season, and so Mrs. Sylvester announced when the last carriage had driven away,  and she and her husband stood in the brilliantly lighted library, surveying a  new cabinet of rare and antique workmanship which had been that day installed  in the place of honor beneath my lady&rsquo;s picture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you seemed to enjoy it, Ona,&rdquo; her husband remarked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O,  it was an occasion of triumph to me,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;It is the first time a  Stuyvesant has crossed our threshold, <i>mon cher</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha,&rdquo;  he exclaimed, turning upon her a brisk displeased look. He was proud and  considered no man his superior in a social sense. &ldquo;Do you acknowledge yourself  a parvenue that you rejoice at the entrance of any one special person into your  doors?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought,&rdquo; she replied somewhat mortified, &ldquo;that you betrayed unusual pleasure  yourself at her introduction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  may be; I was glad to see her here, for her father is one of the most  influential directors in the bank of which I shortly expect to be made  president.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  nature of this disclosure was calculated to be especially gratifying to her,  and effectually blotted out any remembrance of the break by which it had been  introduced. After a few hasty inquiries, followed by a scene of quite honest  mutual congratulation, the gratified wife left her husband to put out the  lights himself or call Samuel as he might choose, and glided up stairs to  delight the curious Sarah with the broken soliloquies and inconsequent  self-communings which formed another of her peculiar habits.</p>
  <p>As  for her husband, he stood a few minutes where she left him, abstractedly eying  the gorgeous vista that spread out before him down to the further mirror of the  elaborate drawing-room, thinking perhaps with a certain degree of pride, of the  swiftness with which he had risen to opulence and the certainty with which he  had conquered position in the business as well as in the social world when he  could speak of such a connection with Thaddeus Stuyvesant as a project already  matured. Then with a hasty movement and a quick sigh which nothing in his  prospects actual or apparent would seem to warrant, he proceeded to put out the  lights, my lady&rsquo;s picture shining with less and less importunity as the  flickering jets disappeared, till all was dark save for the faint glimmer that  came in from the hall, a glimmer just sufficient to show the outlines of the  various articles of furniture scattered about&mdash;and could it be the tall figure  of the master himself standing in the centre of the room with his palms pressed  against his forehead in an attitude of sorrow or despair? Yes, or whose that  wild murmur, &ldquo;Is it never given to man to forget!&rdquo; Yet no, or who is this that  calm and dignified, steps at this moment from the threshold? It must have been  a dream, a phantasy. <i>This</i> is the master of the house who with sedate and  regular step goes up flight after flight of the spiral staircase, and neither  pauses or looks back till he reaches the top of the house where he takes out a  key from his pocket, and opening a certain door, goes in and locks it behind  him. It is his secret study or retreat, a room which no one is allowed to  enter, the mystery of the house to the servants and something more than that to  its inquisitive mistress. What he does there no man knows, but to-night if any  one had been curious enough to listen, they would have heard nothing more  ominous than the monotonous scratch of a pen. He was writing to Miss Belinda  and the burden of his letter was that on a certain day he named, he was coming  to take away Paula.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
    Miss Belinda Makes Conditions</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;For  of the soul the body form doth take, <br>
  For soul is form, and doth the body make.&rdquo;&mdash;Spenser. </p>
  <p>Miss  Belinda was somewhat taken aback at the proposal of Mr. Sylvester to receive  Paula into his own house. She had not anticipated any such result to her  efforts; the utmost she had expected was a couple of years or so of instruction  in some state Academy. Nor did she know whether she was altogether pleased at  the turn affairs were taking. From all she had heard, her niece Ona was, to say  the least, a frivolous woman, and Paula had a mind too noble to be subjected to  the deteriorating influence of a shallow and puerile companionship. Then the  child had great beauty; Mr. Sylvester who ought to be a judge in such matters  had declared it so, and what might not the adulation of the thoughtless and the  envy of the jealous, do towards belittling a nature as yet uncontaminated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  ought to think twice,&rdquo; she said to Miss Abby with some bitterness, who on the  contrary never having thought once was full of the most childish hopes  concerning a result which she considered with a certain secret complacency she  would not have acknowledged for the world, had been very much furthered by her  own wise recommendations to Mr. Sylvester in the beginning of his visit. Yet  notwithstanding her doubts Miss Belinda allowed such preparations to be made as  she considered necessary, and even lent her hand which was deft enough in its  way, to the task of enlarging the child&rsquo;s small wardrobe. As for Paula, the  thought of visiting the great city with the dear friend whose image had stood  in her mind from early childhood as the impersonation of all that was noble,  generous and protecting, was more than joyful; it was an inspiration. Not that  she did not cling to the affectionate if somewhat quaint couple who had  befriended her childhood and sacrificed their comfort to her culture and  happiness. But the chord that lies deeper than gratitude had been struck, and  fond as were her memories of the dear old home, the charm of that deep &ldquo;My  child,&rdquo; with its hint of fatherly affection, was more than her heart could  stand; and no spot, no not the realms of fairy-land itself, looked so  attractive to her fancy as that far fireside in an unknown home where she might  sit with cousin Ona and alternately with her exert her wit to beguile the smile  to his melancholy lips.</p>
  <p>When  therefore upon the stated day, Mr. Sylvester made his second appearance at the  little cottage in Grotewell, it was to find Paula radiant, Miss Abby tearfully  exultant and Miss Belinda&mdash;O anomaly of human nature&mdash;silent and severe.  Attributing this however to her very natural regret at parting with Paula, he  entered into all the arrangements for their departure on the following morning  without a suspicion of the real state of her mind, nor was he undeceived until  the day was nearly over and they sat down to have a few minutes of social  conversation before the early tea.</p>
  <p>They  had been speaking on some local topic involving a question of right and wrong,  and Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s ears were yet thrilling to the deep ringing tones with  which Paula uttered the words, &ldquo;I do not see how any man can hesitate an  instant when the voice of his conscience says no. I should think the very  sunlight would daunt him at the first step of his foot across the forbidden  line,&rdquo; when Miss Belinda suddenly spoke up and sending Paula out of the room on  some trivial pretext, addressed Mr. Sylvester without reserve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have something to say to you, sir, before you take from my home the child of my  care and affection.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Could  he have guessed what that something was that he should turn with such a flush  of sudden anxiety to meet her determined gaze.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  rules of our life here have been simple,&rdquo; continued she in a tone of voice  which those who knew her well recognized as belonging to her uncompromising  moods. &ldquo;To do our duty, love God and serve our neighbor. Paula has been brought  up to reverence those rules in simplicity and honor; what will your gay city  life with its hollow devices for pleasure and its loose hold on the firm  principles of life, do for this innocent soul, Mr. Sylvester?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  city,&rdquo; he said firmly but with a troubled undertone in his voice that was not  unnoted by the watchful woman, &ldquo;is a vast caldron of mingled good and evil. She  will hear of more wrong doing, and be within the reach of more self-denying  virtue, than if she had remained in this village alone with the nature that she  so much loves. The tree of knowledge bears two kinds of fruit, Miss Belinda;  would you therefore hinder the child from approaching its branches?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir; I am not so weak as to keep a child in swaddling-clothes after the period  of infancy is past, neither am I so reckless as to set her adrift on an unknown  sea without a pilot to guide her. Your wife&mdash;&rdquo; she paused and fixed an intent  look upon the flames leaping before her. &ldquo;Ona is my niece,&rdquo; she resumed in a  lower tone of voice, &ldquo;and I feel entitled to speak with freedom concerning her.  Is she such a guide as I would choose for a young girl just entering a new  sphere in life? From all I have heard, I should judge she was somewhat  over-devoted to this world and its fashions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester flushed painfully, but seeing that any softening of the truth would  be wholly ineffectual with this woman, replied in a candid tone, &ldquo;Ona is the  same now as she was in the days of her girlhood. If she loves the world too  well she is not without her excuse; from her birth it has strewn nothing but  roses in her path.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;  came from the lips of the energetic spinster. Then with a second stern glance  at the fire, continued, &ldquo;Another question, Mr. Sylvester. Does your wife  consent to receive my niece into her house, for the indefinite length of time  which you mention, from interest in the girl herself or indeed from any motive  I should judge worthy of Paula? It is a leading question I know, but this is no  time for niceties of speech.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Belinda,&rdquo; replied he, and his voice was firm though his fingers slightly  trembled where they rested upon the arms of his chair, &ldquo;I will try and forget  for a moment that Ona is my wife, and frankly confide to you that any such  motive on her part, as would meet with your entire approval, must not be expected  from a woman who has never fully recognized the solemn responsibilities of  life. That she will be kind to Paula I have no doubt, that she may even learn  to take an interest in her for her own sake, is also very possible, but that  she will ever take your place towards her as guide or instructor, I neither  anticipate nor would feel myself justified in leading you to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  look which Miss Belinda cast him was anything but reassuring. &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said  she, &ldquo;you will take away my darling and give her up to an influence that can  not be for good, or your glance would not be so troubled or your lip so  uncertain. You would set her young feet in a path where the very flowers are so  thick they conceal its tendency and obscure its dangers. Mr. Sylvester you are a  man who has seen life with naked eyes, and must recognize its responsibilities;  dare you take this Paula, whom you have seen, out of the atmosphere of truth  and purity in which she has been raised, and give her over to the enervating  influences of folly and fashion? Will you assume the risk and brave the  consequences?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  though an electric shock had touched the nerve of his nature, Mr. Sylvester  hastily rose and moved in a restless manner to the window. It was his favorite  refuge in any time of sudden perplexity or doubt, and this was surely an  occasion for both.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Belinda,&rdquo; he began and then paused, looking out on the hills of his boyhood,  every one of which spoke to him at that moment with a force that almost  sickened his heart and benumbed the faculties of his mind; &ldquo;I recognize the  love which leads you to speak in this way, and I bow before it, but&mdash;&rdquo; here his  tongue faltered again, that ready tongue whose quick and persuasive eloquence  on public occasions had won for him the name of Silver-speech among his friends  and admirers&mdash;&ldquo;but there are others who love your Paula also, love her with a  yearning that only the childless can feel or the disappointed appreciate. I had  hoped&mdash;&rdquo; here he left the window and approached her side, &ldquo;to do more for Paula  than to give her the temporal benefit of a luxurious home and such instruction  as her extraordinary talents demand. If Ona upon seeing and knowing the child  had found she could love her, I had intended to ask you to yield her to us  unreservedly and forever, in short to make her my child in place of the  daughter I have lost. But now&mdash;&rdquo; with a quick gesture he began pacing the floor  and left the sentence unfinished.</p>
  <p>Miss  Belinda&rsquo;s eyes which were of a light grey, wholly without beauty but with  strange flashes of expression in them, left the fire and fell upon his face,  and a tear of real feeling gathered beneath her lids.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had no idea,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that you cherished any such intention as that. If I had  I might have worded my apprehensions differently. The yearning feeling of which  you speak, I can easily understand, also the strength of the determination it  must take on the part of a man like yourself, to give up a hope of this nature.  Yet&mdash;&rdquo; Seeing him pause in his hurried pacing and open his lips as if to speak, she  deferentially stopped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Belinda,&rdquo; said he, in the firm and steadfast way more in keeping with his  features than his agitated manner of a moment before, &ldquo;I cannot give it up. The  injury it would do me is greater than the harm, which one of Paula&rsquo;s lofty  nature would be apt to acquire in any atmosphere into which she might chance to  be introduced. She is not a child, Miss Belinda, though we allude to her as  such. The texture of those principles which you have instilled into her breast,  is of no such weak material as to give way to the first petty breeze that  blows. Paula&rsquo;s house will stand, while mine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  paused and gave way to a momentary struggle, but that over, he set his lips  firmly together and the last vestige of irresolution vanished. Sitting down by  her side, he turned his face upon her, and for the first time she realized the  power which with one exception he had always exerted over the minds of others. &ldquo;Miss  Belinda,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am going to give you an evidence of my trust; I am going  to leave with you the responsibility of Paula&rsquo;s future. She shall go with me,  and learn, if she can, to love me and mine, but she shall also be under  obligations to open her heart to you on all matters that concern her life and  happiness in my house, and the day you see any falling off in her pure and  upright spirit, you shall demand her return, and though it tears the heart from  my breast, I will yield her up without question or parley as I am a gentleman  and a Christian. Does that content you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  certainly ought to, sir. No one could ask more, I am sure,&rdquo; returned the other  in a voice somewhat unsteady for her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is opening my house to the gaze of a stranger,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for I desire you to  command Paula to withhold nothing that seriously affects her; but my confidence  in you is unbounded and I am sure that whatever you may learn in this way, will  be held as sacred by you as though it were buried in a tomb.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  certainly will, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  for the dearer hope which I have mentioned, time and the condition of things  must decide for us. Meanwhile I shall strive to win a father&rsquo;s place in her  heart, if only to build myself a refuge for the days that are to come. You see  I speak frankly, Miss Belinda; will you give me some token that you are not  altogether dissatisfied with the result of this conversation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  the straightforward if somewhat blunt action that characterized all her  movements, she stretched out her hand, which he took with something more than  his usual high-bred courtesy. &ldquo;With you at the wheel,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I think I may  trust my darling, even to the whirl and follies of such a society as I know Ona  loves. A man who can so command himself, ought to be a safe guide to pioneer  others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  the considerate gentleman bowed; but the frank smile that hailed her genial  clasp had somehow vanished, and from the sudden cloud that at that moment swept  over the roseate heavens, fell a shadow that left its impress on his lip long  after the cloud itself had departed.</p>
  <p>An  hour or so had passed. The fire was burning brightly on the hearthstone,  illumining with a steady glow the array of stuffed birds, worsted samplers and  old-fashioned portraits with which the walls were adorned, but reserving its  richest glow and fullest irradiation for the bended head of Paula, who seated  on a little stool in the corner of the hearth, was watching the rise and fall  of the flickering flames.</p>
  <p>She  had packed her little trunk, had said good-bye to all her neighboring friends  and was now sitting on the old hearthstone, musing upon the new life that was  about to open before her. It was a happy musing, as the smile that vaguely  dimpled her cheeks and brightened her eyes beneath their long lashes, amply  testified. As Mr. Sylvester watched her from the opposite side of the hearth  where he was sitting alone with his thoughts, he felt his heart sink with  apprehension at the fervor of anticipation with which she evidently looked  forward to the life in the new home. &ldquo;The young wings think to gain freedom,&rdquo;  thought he, &ldquo;when they are only destined to the confinement of a gilded cage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was so silent and looked so sad, Paula with a certain sort of sensitiveness to  any change in the emotional atmosphere surrounding her, which was one of her  chief characteristics, hastily looked up and meeting his eye fixed on her with  that foreboding glance, softly arose and came and sat down by his side. &ldquo;You  look tired,&rdquo; murmured she; &ldquo;the long ride after a day of business care has been  too much for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was the first word of sympathy with his often over-wearied mind and body, that  had greeted his ears for years. It made his eyes moisten.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have been a little overworked,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for the last two months, but I shall  soon be myself again. What were you thinking of, Paula?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  was I thinking of?&rdquo; repeated she, drawing her chair nearer to his in her loving  confidence. &ldquo;I was thinking what wonders of beauty and art lay in that great  kernel which you call the city. I shall see lovely faces and noble forms. I  shall wander through halls of music, the echo of whose songs may have come to  me in the sob of the river or the sigh of the pines, but whose notes in all  their beauty and power have never been heard by me even in my dreams. I shall  look on great men and touch the garments of thoughtful women. I shall see life in  its fullness as I have felt nature in its mightiness, and my heart will be  satisfied at last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester drew a deep breath and his eyes burned strangely in the glow of the  fire-light. &ldquo;You expect high things,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;did you ever consider that the  life in a great city, with its ceaseless rush and constant rivalries, must be  often strangely petty in despite of its artistic and social advantages?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  life has its petty side,&rdquo; said she, with a sweet arch look. &ldquo;The eagle that  cleaves the thunder-cloud, must sometimes stop to plume its wings. I should be  sorry to lose the small things out of existence. Even we in the face of that  great sunset appealing to us from the west, have to pile up the firewood on the  hearth and set the table for supper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  fashion, Paula,&rdquo; he pursued, concealing his wonder at the maturity of mind  evinced by this simple child of nature, &ldquo;that inexorable power that rules the  very souls of women who once step within the magic circle of her realm! have  you never thought of her and the demands that she makes on the time and  attention even of the worshippers of the good and the true?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sometimes,&rdquo; she returned with a repetition of her arch little smile, &ldquo;when I  put on a certain bonnet I have, which Aunt Abby modeled over from one of my  grandmother&rsquo;s. Fashion is a sort of obstinate step-dame I imagine, whom it is  less trouble to obey than to oppose. I don&rsquo;t believe I shall quarrel with  Fashion if she will only promise to keep her hands off my soul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if&mdash;&rdquo; with a pause, &ldquo;she asks your all, what then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall consider that I am in a country of democratic principles,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;and  beg to be excused from acceding to the tyrannical demands of any autocrat male  or female.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have been listening to Miss Belinda,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;she is also opposed to all and  any tyrannical measures.&rdquo; Then with a grave look from which all levity had  fled, he leaned toward the young girl and gently asked, &ldquo;Do you know that you  are a very beautiful girl, Paula?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  flushed, looked at him in some surprise and slowly drooped her head. &ldquo;I have  been told I looked like my father,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and I know that means something  very kind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  child,&rdquo; said he, with gentle insistence, &ldquo;God has given you a great and  wonderful gift, a treasure-casket of whose worth you scarcely realize the  value. I tell you this myself, first because I prize your beauty as something  quite sacred and pure, and secondly because you are going where you will hear  words of adulation, whose folly and bluntness will often offend your ears,  unless you carry in your soul some talisman to counteract their effect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I know what you mean. I will remember that the most  engaging beauty is nothing without a pure mind and a good heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you will remember too,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;that I blessed your innocent head  to-night, not because it is circled by the roses of a youthful and fresh  loveliness, but because of the pure mind and good heart I see shining in your  eyes.&rdquo; And with a fond but solemn aspect he reached out his hand and laid it on  her ebon locks.</p>
  <p>She  bowed her head upon her breast. &ldquo;I will never forget,&rdquo; said she, and the  fire-light fell with a softening glow on the tears that trembled from her  eye-lashes.</p>

    The End Of My Lady&rsquo;s Picture</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Heaven  from all creatures tides the book of Fate.&rdquo;&mdash;Pope.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Sylvester was spending an evening at home. This was something so unusual for  this august lady of fashion to indulge in, that she found it difficult not to  fall asleep in the huge crimson-backed chair in which she had chosen to  ensconce herself. Not that she had desisted from making every effort known to  mortal woman to keep herself awake and if possible amused till the expected  travellers should arrive. She had played with her bird till the spoiled pet had  himself protested, ducking his head under his wing and proceeding without  ceremony to make up his little feather bed, as cunning Geraldine used to call  the round, fluffy ball into which he rolled himself at night. More than that,  she had looked over her ornaments and taken out such articles as she thought  could be spared for Paula, to say nothing of playing a bar or so from the last  operatic sensation, and laboriously cutting open the leaves of the new  magazine. But it was all of no use, and the heavy white lids were slowly  falling, when the bell rang and Mr. Bertram Mandeville was announced, or rather  Bertram Sylvester as he now chose to be called.</p>
  <p>It  was a godsend to her as she politely informed him upon his entrance; and though  in his secret heart he felt anything but God sent&mdash;he was not of a make to  appreciate his uncle&rsquo;s wife at her very evident value&mdash;he consented to remain  and assist her in disposing of the evening till Mr. Sylvester should return.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is going to bring a pretty girl with him,&rdquo; remarked she, in a tone of some  interest, &ldquo;a cousin of mine from Grotewell. I should like to have you see her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; replied he, his mind roaming off at the suggestion, into the region of a  certain plain little music-room where the clock on the mantel ticked to the  beating of his own heart. And for ten minutes Mrs. Sylvester had the pleasure  of filling the room with a stream of easy talk, in which Grotewell, dark  beauties, the coming Seventh Regiment reception, the last bit of gossip from  London, and the exact situation of the Madison Bank formed the principal  topics.</p>
  <p>To  the one last mentioned, it having taken the form of a question, he was forced  to reply; but the simple locality having been learned, she rambled easily on,  this time indulging him with a criticism upon the personal appearance of  certain business gentlemen who visited the house, ending with the somewhat  startling declaration:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  Edward were not the fine appearing gentleman that he undoubtedly is, I should  feel utterly out of place in these handsome parlors. Anything but to see an  elegant and modern home, decorated with the costliest works of art, and filled  with <i>bijouterie</i> of the most exquisite delicacy, presided over by a plain  and common-place woman or a bald-headed and inferior-looking man. The contrast  is too vivid; works of the highest art do not need such a startling comparison  to bring out their beauty. Now if Edward stood in the throne-room of a palace,  he would somehow make it seem to others as a handsome set off to his own face  and figure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was all very wife-like if somewhat unnecessary, and Bertram could have listened  to it with pleasure, if she had not cast the frequent and side-long glances at  the mirror, which sufficiently betrayed the fact that she included herself in  this complacent conclusion; as indeed she may have considered herself justified  in doing, husband and wife being undoubtedly of one flesh. As it was, he  maintained an immovable countenance, though he admired his uncle as much as she  did, and the conversation gradually languished till the white somnolent lids of  the lady again began to show certain premonitory signs of drooping, when  suddenly they were both aroused by the well known click of a latch-key in the  door, and in another moment Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s voice was heard in the hall,  saying, in tones whose cheery accents made his wife&rsquo;s eyes open in surprise&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Welcome  home, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  have come,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Sylvester rising with a look of undeniable  expectation. Had Paula not been a beauty she would have remained seated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  we have come,&rdquo; was heard in hearty tones from the door-way, and Mr. Sylvester  with a proud look which Bertram long remembered, ushered into their presence a  young girl whose simple cloak and bonnet in no wise prevented Mrs. Sylvester  from recognizing the somewhat uncommon beauty she had been led to expect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula,  this is your cousin Ona, and&mdash;Ah, Bertram, glad to see you&mdash;this is my only  nephew, Mr. Sylvester.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young girl, lost in the sudden glamour of numerous lights, shining upon  splendors such as she may have dreamed of over the pages of Irving&rsquo;s Alhambra,  but certainly had never before seen, blushed with very natural embarrassment,  but yet managed to bestow a pretty enough greeting upon the elegant woman and  handsome youth, while Ona after the first moment of almost involuntary  hesitation, took in hers the two trembling hands of her youthful cousin and  actually kissed her cheek.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not given to caresses as you know,&rdquo; she afterwards explained in a somewhat  apologetic tone to her husband; &ldquo;and anything like an appeal for one on the  part of a child or an inferior, I detest; but her simple way of holding out her  hand disarmed me, and then such a face demands a certain amount of homage, does  it not?&rdquo; And her husband in his surprise, was forced to acknowledge to himself,  that as closely as he had studied his wife&rsquo;s nature for ten years, there were  certain crooks and turns in it which even he had never penetrated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  look dazzled,&rdquo; that lady exclaimed, gazing not unkindly into the young girl&rsquo;s  face; &ldquo;the sudden glare of so much gas-light has bewildered you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not think it is that,&rdquo; returned Paula with a frank and admiring look at the  gorgeous room and the circle of pleasant faces about her. &ldquo;Sudden lights I can  bear, but I have come from a little cottage on the hillside and the  magnificence of nature does not prepare you for the first sudden view of the  splendors of art.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Sylvester smiled and cast a side glance of amusement at Bertram. &ldquo;You admire  our new hangings I see,&rdquo; remarked she with an indulgence of the other&rsquo;s <i>n&auml;ivet&eacute;</i> that greatly relieved her husband.</p>
  <p>But  in that instant a change had come across Paula; the simple country maid had  assimilated herself with the surroundings, and with a sudden grace and dignity  that were unstudied as they were charming, dropped her eyes from her cousin&rsquo;s  portrait&mdash;that for some reason seemed to shine with more than its usual  insistence&mdash;and calmly replied, &ldquo;I admire all beautiful color; it is my  birthright as a Walton, to do so, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Sylvester was a Walton also and therefore smiled; but her husband, who had  marked with inward distrust, the sudden transformation in Paula, now stepped  forward with a word or two of remark concerning his appetite, a prosaic  allusion that led to the rapid disappearance of the ladies upstairs and a short  but hurried conversation between the two gentlemen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have brought you a sealed envelope from the office,&rdquo; said Bertram, who, in  accordance with his uncle&rsquo;s advice, had already initiated himself into business  by assuming the position of clerk in the office of the wealthy speculator.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  returned his uncle hastily opening it. &ldquo;As I expected, a meeting has been held  this day by the board of Directors of the Madison Bank, a vote was cast, my  proxy did his duty and I am duly elected President. Bertram, we know what that  means,&rdquo; smiled he, holding out his hand with an affectionate warmth greatly in  advance of the emotion displayed by him on a former occasion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope so indeed,&rdquo; young Bertram responded. &ldquo;An increase of fortune and honor for  you, though you seem to have both in the fullest measure already, and a start  in the new life for me to whom fortune and honor mean happiness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  smile younger and more full of hope than any he had seen on his uncle&rsquo;s face  for years, responded to this burst. &ldquo;Bertram,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;since our conversation  of a couple of weeks ago something has occurred which somewhat alters the  opinions I then expressed. If you have patience equal to your energy, and a  self-control that will not put to shame your unbounded trust in women, I think  I can say God-speed to your serious undertaking, with something like a good  heart. Women are not all frivolous and foolish-minded; there are some jewels of  simple goodness and faith yet left in the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  God for your conversion,&rdquo; returned his nephew smiling, &ldquo;and if this lovely girl  whom you have just introduced to me, is the cause of it, then thank God for her  also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  uncle bowed with a gravity almost solemn, but the ladies returning at this  moment, he refrained from further reply. After supper, to which unusual meal  Mr. Sylvester insisted upon his nephew remaining, the two gentlemen again drew  apart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you have decided upon buying the shares I have mentioned,&rdquo; said the former, &ldquo;you  had better get your money in a position to handle at once. I shall wish to  present you to Mr. Stuyvesant to-morrow, and I should like to be able to  mention you as a future stockholder in the bank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Stuyvesant!&rdquo; exclaimed Bertram, ignoring the rest of the sentence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  returned his uncle with a smile, &ldquo;Thaddeus Stuyvesant is the next largest  stockholder to myself in the Madison Bank, and his patronage is not an  undesirable one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed&mdash;I  was not aware&mdash;excuse me, I should be happy,&rdquo; stammered the young man. &ldquo;As for the  money, it is all in Governments and is at your command whenever you please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is good, I&rsquo;ll notify you when I&rsquo;m ready for the transfer. And now come,&rdquo; said  he, with a change from his deep business tone to the lighter one of ordinary  social converse, &ldquo;forget for a half hour that you have discarded the name of  Mandeville, and give us an aria or a sonata from Mendelssohn before those hands  have quite lost their cunning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the ladies,&rdquo; inquired the youth glancing towards the drawing-room where Mrs. Sylvester  was giving Paula her first lesson in ceramics.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  it is to see how the charm will act upon my shy country lassie, that I request  such a favor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  she never heard Mendelssohn?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  with your interpretation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without  further hesitation the young musician proceeded to the piano, which occupied a  position opposite to my lady&rsquo;s picture in this anomalous room denominated by  courtesy the library. In another instant, a chord delicate and ringing,  disturbed the silence of the long vista, and one of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s most  exquisite songs trembled in all its delicious harmony through these apartments  of sensuous luxury.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester had seated himself where he could see the distant figure of Paula,  and leaning back in his chair, watched for the first startled response on her  part. He was not disappointed. At the first note, he beheld her spirited head  turn in a certain wondering surprise, followed presently by her whole quivering  form, till he could perceive her face, upon which were the dawnings of a great  delight, flush and pale by turns, until the climax of the melody being reached,  she came slowly down the room, stretching out her hands like a child, and  breathing heavily as if her ecstacy of joy in its impotence to adequately  express itself, had caught an expression from pain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O  Mr. Sylvester!&rdquo; was all she said as she reached that gentleman&rsquo;s side; but  Bertram Mandeville recognized the accents of an unfathomable appreciation in  that simple exclamation, and struck into a grand old battle-song that had always  made his own heart beat with something of the fire of ancient chivalry under  its breastplate of modern broadcloth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the voice of the thunder clouds when they marshal for battle!&rdquo; exclaimed she  at the conclusion. &ldquo;I can hear the cry of a righteous struggle all through the  sublime harmony.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are right; it is a war-song ancient as the time of battle-axes and spears,&rdquo;  quoth Bertram from his seat at the piano.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought I detected the flashing of steel,&rdquo; returned she. &ldquo;O what a world lies  in those simple bits of ivory!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say  rather in the fingers that sweep them,&rdquo; uttered Mr. Sylvester. &ldquo;You will not  hear such music often.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad of that,&rdquo; she cried simply, then in a quick conscious tone explained, &ldquo;I  mean that the hearing of such music makes an era in our life, a starting-point  for thoughts that reach away into eternity; we could not bear such experiences  often, it would confuse the spirit if not deaden its enjoyment. Or so it seems  to me,&rdquo; she added naively, glancing at her cousin who now came sweeping in from  the further room, where she had been trying the effect of a change in the  arrangement of two little pet monstrosities of Japanese ware.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  seems to you?&rdquo; that lady inquired. &ldquo;O, Mr. Mandeville&rsquo;s playing? I beg pardon,  Sylvester is the name by which you now wish to be addressed I suppose. Fine,  isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she rambled on all in the same tone while she cautiously hid an  unfortunate gape of her rosy mouth behind the folds of her airy handkerchief. &ldquo;Mr.  Turner says the hiatus you have made in the musical world by leaving the  concert room for the desk, can never be repaired,&rdquo; she went on, supposedly to  her nephew though she did not look his way, being at that instant engaged in  sinking into her favorite chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad,&rdquo; Bertram politely returned with a frank smile, &ldquo;to have enjoyed the  approval of so cultivated a critic as Mr. Turner. I own it occasions me a pang  now and then,&rdquo; he remarked to his uncle over his shoulder, &ldquo;to think I shall  never again call up those looks of self-forgetful delight, which I have  sometimes detected on the faces of certain ones in my audience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  he relapsed without pause into a solemn anthem, the very reverse of the  stirring tones which he had previously accorded them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  we are in a temple!&rdquo; whispered Paula, subduing the sudden interest and  curiosity which this young man&rsquo;s last words had awakened. And the awe which  crept over her countenance was the fittest interpretation to those noble  sounds, which the one weary-hearted man in that room could have found.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have something to tell you, Ona,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Sylvester shortly after this, as  the music being over, they all sat down for a final chat about the fireside. &ldquo;I  have received notice that the directors of the Madison Bank have this day  elected me their president. I thought you might like to know it to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a very gratifying piece of news certainly. President of the Madison Bank  sounds very well, does it not, Paula?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young girl with her soul yet ringing with the grand and solemn harmonies of Mendelssohn  and Chopin, turned at this with her brightest smile. &ldquo;It certainly does and a  little awe-inspiring too;&rdquo; she added with her arch glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  congratulations are also requested for our new assistant cashier. Arise,  Bertram, and greet the ladies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a blush his young nephew arose to his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  are you going into the banking business?&rdquo; queried Mrs. Sylvester. &ldquo;Mr. Turner  will be more shocked than ever: he chooses to say that bankers, merchants and  such are the solid rock of his church, while the lighter fry such as artists,  musicians, and let us hope he includes us ladies, are its minarets, and  steeples. Now to make a foundation out of a steeple will quite overturn his  methodical mind I fear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester looked genially at his wife; she was not accustomed to attempt the  facetious; but Paula seemed to have the power of bringing out unexpected lights  and shadows from all with whom she came in contact.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  clergyman who rears his church on the basis of wealth must expect some  overturning now and then,&rdquo; laughed he.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  by means of it he turns a fresh side to the sun, it will do him no harm,&rdquo;  chimed in Paula.</p>
  <p>Seldom  had there been so much simple gaiety round that fireside; the very atmosphere  grew lighter, and the brilliance of my lady&rsquo;s picture became less oppressive.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  ought to have a happy winter of it,&rdquo; spoke up Mr. Sylvester with a glance  around him. &ldquo;Life never looked more cheerful for us all, I think; what do you  say, Bertram my boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  certainly looks promising for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  for me,&rdquo; murmured Paula.</p>
  <p>The  complacent way with which Mrs. Sylvester smoothed out the feathers of her fan  with her jewelled right hand,&mdash;she always carried a fan winter and summer, some  said for the purpose of displaying those same jewelled fingers&mdash;was sufficient answer  for her.</p>
  <p>At  that moment there was a hush, when suddenly the small clock on the mantel-piece  struck eleven, and instantly as if awaiting the signal, there came a rush and a  heavy crash which drew every one to their feet, and the brilliant portrait of  my lady fell from the wall, and toppling over the cabinet beneath, slid with  the various articles of bronze and china thereon, almost to the very chair in  which its handsome prototype had been sitting.</p>
  <p>It  was a startling interruption and for an instant no one spoke, then Paula with a  look towards her cousin breathed to herself rather than said, &ldquo;Pray God it be  not an omen!&rdquo; And the pale countenances of the two gentlemen standing face to  face on either side of that fallen picture, showed that the shadow of the same  superstition had insensibly crossed their own minds.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Sylvester was the only one who remained unmoved. &ldquo;Lift if up,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;and  let us see if it has sustained any injury.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Instantly  Bertram and her husband sprang forward, and in a moment its glowing surface was  turned upward. Who could read the meaning of the look that crossed her husband&rsquo;s  face as he perceived that the sharp spear of the bronze horseman, which had  been overturned in the fall, had penetrated the rosy countenance of the portrait  and destroyed that importunate smile forever.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose it is a judgment upon me for putting all the money you had allowed me  for charitable purposes, into that exquisite bit of bronze,&rdquo; observed Mrs.  Sylvester, stooping above the overturned horseman with an expression of regret  she had not chosen to bestow on her own ruined picture. &ldquo;Ah he is less of a  champion than I imagined; he has lost his spear in the struggle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paula  glanced at her cousin in surprise. Was this pleasantry only a veil assumed by  this courtly lady to hide her very natural regret over the more serious  accident? Even her husband turned toward her with a certain puzzled inquiry in  his troubled countenance. But her expression of unconcern was too natural;  evidently the destruction of the picture had awakened but small regret in her  volatile mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is less vain than I thought,&rdquo; was the inward comment of Paula.</p>
  <p>Ah  simple child of the woods and streams, it is the extent of her vanity not the  lack of it, that has produced this effect. She has begun to realize that ten  years have elapsed since this picture was painted, and that people are  beginning to say as they examine it, &ldquo;Mrs. Sylvester has not yet lost her  complexion, I see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  break necessarily followed this disturbance, and before long Bertram took his  leave, not without a cordial pressure from his uncle&rsquo;s hand and a look of  kindly interest from the stranger lassie, upon whose sympathetic and  imaginative mind the hints let fall as to his former profession, had produced a  deep impression. With his departure Mrs. Sylvester&rsquo;s weariness returned, and  ere long she led the way to her apartments up stairs. As Paula was hastening to  follow Mr. Sylvester stopped her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will not allow this unfortunate occurrence,&rdquo; he said, with a slight gesture  towards the picture now standing with its face against the wall, &ldquo;to mar your  first sleep under my roof, will you Paula, my child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  not if you say that you think Cousin Ona will not be likely to connect it with  my appearance here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not think she will; she is not superstitious and besides does not seem to  greatly regret the misfortune.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I will forget it all and only remember the music.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was all you anticipated?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometime  I will tell you about the player and the sweet young girl he loves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  he&mdash;&rdquo; she paused, blushing; love was a subject upon which she had never yet  spoken to any one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  he does,&rdquo; Mr. Sylvester returned smiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought there was a meaning in the music I did not quite understand. Good  night, uncle,&rdquo;&mdash;he had requested her to address him thus though he was in truth  her cousin, &ldquo;and many, many thanks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  he stopped her again. &ldquo;You think you will be happy in these rooms,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you  love splendor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was not yet sufficiently acquainted with his voice to detect the regret  underlying its kindly tone, and answered without suspicion. &ldquo;I did not know it  before, but I fear that I do. It dazzled at first, but now it seems as if I had  reached a home towards which I had always been journeying. I shall dream away  hours of joy before each little ornament that adorns your parlors. The very  tiles that surround the fireplace will demand a week of attention at least.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  ended with a smile, but unlike formerly he did not seem to catch the infection.  &ldquo;I had rather you had cared less,&rdquo; said he, but instantly regretted the seeming  reproach, for her eyes filled with tears and the tones of her voice trembled as  she replied,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think the beauty I have seen has made me forget the kindness that has  brought me here? I love fine and noble objects, glory of color and harmony of  shape, but more than all these do I love a generous soul without a blot on its  purity, or a flaw in its integrity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  had meant to utter something that would show her appreciation of his goodness  and the universal esteem in which he was held, but was quite unprepared for the  start that he gave and the unmistakable deepening of the shadow on his sombre  face. But before she could express her regret at the offence, whatever it was,  he had recovered himself, and it was with a fatherly tenderness that he laid  his hand upon hers while he said, &ldquo;Such a soul may yours ever continue, my  child,&rdquo; and then stood watching her as she glided up the stairs, her charming  face showing every now and then as she leaned on her winding way to the top, to  bestow upon him the tender little smile she had already learned was his solace  and delight.</p>
  <p>It  was the beginning of happier days for him.</p>

    Miss Belinda Has A Question To Decide</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;I  pray you in your letters, <br>
Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate, <br>
Nor set down aught in malice.&rdquo;&mdash;Othello. </p>
  <p>Miss  Belinda sitting before her bedroom fire on a certain windy night in January,  presented a picture of the most profound thought. A year had elapsed since,  with heavy heart and moistened eye, she had bidden good-bye to the child of her  care, and beheld her drift away with her new friend into a strange and untried  life. And now a letter had come from that friend, in which with the truest  appreciation for the feelings of herself and sister, he requested their final  permission to adopt Paula as his own child and the future occupant of his house  and heart.</p>
  <p>Yes,  after a year of increased comfort, Mrs. Sylvester, who would never have  consented to receive as her own any child demanding care or attention, had  decided it was quite a different matter to give place and position to a lovely  girl already grown, whose beauty was sufficiently pronounced to do credit to  the family while at the same time it was of a character to heighten by contrast  her own very manifest attractions. So the letter, destined to create such a  disturbance in the stern and powerful mind of Miss Belinda, had been written  and dispatched.</p>
  <p>And  indeed it was matter for the gravest reflection. To accede to this important  request was to yield up all control over the dear young girl whose affection  had constituted the brightness of this somewhat disappointed life, while to  refuse an offer made with such evident love and anxiety, was to bring a pang of  regret to a heart she hesitated to wound. The question of advantage which might  have swayed others in their decision, did not in the least affect Miss Belinda.  Now that Paula had seen the world and gained an insight into certain studies  beyond the reach of her own attainments, any wishes in which she might have  indulged on that score were satisfied, and mere wealth with its concomitant of  luxuriant living, she regarded with distrust, and rather in the light of a  stumbling-block to the great and grand end of all existence.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  with that energy which characterized all her movements, she rose from her seat,  and first casting a look of somewhat cautious inquiry at the recumbent figure  of her sister, asleep in the heavy old fashioned bed that occupied one corner  of the room, she proceeded to a bureau drawer and took out a small box which  she unlocked on the table. It was full of letters; those same honest epistles,  which, as empowered by Mr. Sylvester, she had requested Paula to send her from  week to week. Some of them were a year old, but she read them all carefully  through, while the clock ticked on the shelf and the wind soughed in the  chimney. Certain passages she marked, and when she had finished the pile, she  took up the letters again and re-read those passages. They were necessarily  desultory in their character, but they all had, in her mind at least, a bearing  upon the question on hand, and as such, I give them to my readers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O  aunty, I have made a friend, a sweet girl friend who I have reason to hope will  henceforth be to me as my other eye and hand. Her name is Stuyvesant&mdash;a name by  the way that always calls up a certain complacent smile on Cousin Ona&rsquo;s  countenance&mdash;and she is the daughter of one of the directors of Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s  bank. I met her in a rather curious way. For some reason Ona had expressed a  wish for me to ride horseback. She is rather too large for the exercise  herself, but thought it looked well, she said, to see a lady and groom ride  from the front of the house; moreover it would keep me in color by establishing  my health. So Mr. Sylvester who denies her nothing, promised us horses and the  groom, and as a preparation for acquitting myself with credit, has sent me to  one of the finest riding academies in the city. It was here I met Miss  Stuyvesant. She is a small interesting-looking girl whose chief beauty lies in  her expression which is certainly very charming. I was conscious of a calm and  satisfied feeling the moment I saw her. Her eyes which are raised with a  certain appeal to your face, are blue, while her lips that break into smiles  only at rare moments, are rosy and delicately curved. In her riding-habit she  looks like a child, but when dressed for the street she surprises you with the  reserved and womanly air with which she carries her proud head. Altogether she  is a sweet study to me, alluring me with her glance yet awing me by her dainty  ladyhood, a ladyhood too unconscious to be affected and yet so completely a  part of her whole delicate being, that you could as soon dissociate the bloom  from the rose, as the air of highborn reserve, from this sweet scion of one of  New York&rsquo;s oldest families.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was mounting my horse when our eyes first met, and I never shall forget her  look of delighted surprise. Did she recognize in me the friend I now hope to become?  Later we were introduced by Mr. Sylvester who had been so kind as to accompany  me that day. The way in which he said to her, &lsquo;This is Paula,&rsquo; proved that I  was no new topic of conversation between them, and indeed she afterwards  explained to me that she had been forewarned of my arrival during an afternoon  call at his house. There was in this first interview none of the unnecessary  gush which you have so often reprobated as childish; indeed Miss Stuyvesant is  not a person with whom one would presume to be familiar, nor was it till we had  met several times that any acknowledgement was made of the mutual interest with  which we found ourselves inspired. Cousin Ona to whom I had naturally spoken of  the little lady, wished me to cultivate her acquaintance more assiduously, but  I knew that if I had excited in her the same interest she had awakened in me,  this would not be necessary; our friendship would grow of itself and blossom  without any hot-house forcing. And so it did. One day she came to the riding-school  with her eyes like stars and her cheeks like the oleanders in your  sitting-room. Her brightness was so contagious, I stepped up to her. But she  greeted me with almost formal reserve, and mounting her horse, proceeded to  engage in her usual exercise. I was not hurt; I recognized the presence of some  thought or feeling which made a barrier around her sensitive nature, and duly  respected it. Mounting my own horse, I rode around the ring which is the  somewhat limited field of my present equestrian efforts, and waited. For I knew  from the looks which she cast me every now and then, that the flower of our  friendship was outgrowing its sheath and would soon burst into the bud of  perfect understanding. At the end of the lesson we approached each other. I do  not know how it was done, but we walked home together, or rather I accompanied  her to the stoop of her house, and before we parted we had exchanged those  words which give emphasis to a sentiment long cherished but now for the first  time avowed. Miss Stuyvesant and I are friends, and I feel as though a new  stream of enjoyment had opened in my breast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  fact that I still call her by this formal title instead of her very pretty name  of Cicely, proves the nature of the respect she inspires even in the breasts of  her girlish associates.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  is it that I frequently hesitate as I go up the stairs and look about me with a  vague feeling of apprehension? The bronze figure of Luxury that adorns the  landing, wears no semblance of terror to the wildest imagination, and yet I  often find myself seized by an inexplicable shudder as I hurry past it; and  once I actually looked behind me with the same sensation as if some one had  plucked me by the sleeve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a folly; for recording which, I make my excuses.&rdquo;</p>

  <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cousin  Ona has decided that I must never wear colors. &lsquo;Soft grays, my dear, dead  blacks and opaque whites are all that you need to bring out the fine contrast  of your hair and complexion; the least hint of blue or pink would destroy it.&rsquo;  So she says and so I must believe, for who else has made such a study of the  all important subject of dress. Behold me, then, arrayed for my first reception  in a colorless robe of rich silk to which Ona after long consideration allowed  me to add some ornaments of plain gold with which Mr. Sylvester has kindly  presented me. But I think more of the people I am going to meet than of  anything else, though I enjoy the home-feeling which a pretty dress gives me,  as well as a violet does its bright blue coat.&rdquo;</p>
 <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have heard a great preacher! What shall I say? At first it seems as if nothing  could express my joy and satisfaction. The sapling that is shaken to its root  by the winds of heaven, keeps silence I imagine. But O Aunty, if my smallness  makes me quake, it also makes me feel. What gates of thought have been opened  to me! What shining tracks of inquiry pointed out! I feel as if I had been  shown a path where angels walked. Can it be that such words have been uttered  every week of my life and I in ignorance of them? It is like the revelation of  the ocean to unaccustomed eyes. Henceforth small things must seem like pebble  stones above which stretch innumerable heavenly vistas. It is not so much that  new things have been revealed to me as that old things have been made strangely  eloquent. The voice of a daisy on the hill side, the breath of thunder in the  mountain gorges, the blossoming of a child&rsquo;s smile under its mother&rsquo;s eye, the  fact that golden portals are opened in every life for the coming and going of  the messengers of God, all have been made real to me, real as the voice of the  Saviour to his disciples as they walked in the fields or started back  awe-stricken from the stupendous vision of the cross. It is a solemn thing to  see one&rsquo;s humble thoughts caught by the imagination of a great mind and carried  on and up into regions you never realized existed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was so burdened with joy that I could not forbear asking Mr. Sylvester if he  did not feel as if the whole face of the world had changed since we entered  those holy doors. He did not respond with the glad &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; for which I hoped, and  though his smile was very kind, I could not help wondering what it was that  sometimes fell between us like a veil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O  Aunty, how my heart does yearn towards Mr. Sylvester at times! As I see him  sitting with clouded brow in the midst of so much that ought to charm and  enliven him, I ask myself if the advantages of wealth compensate for all this  care and anxiety. But I notice he is much more cheerful now than when I first  came. Ona says he is in danger of losing the air of melancholy reserve which  made him look so distinguished, but I think we can spare a little of such  doubtful distinguishment for the sake of the smiles with which he now and then  indulges us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  feel as if a hand had gripped my throat. Cousin Ona spoke to Mr. Sylvester this  morning in a way that made my very heart stand still. And yet it was only a  simple, &lsquo;Follow your own judgment, Mr. Sylvester.&rsquo; But how she said it! Do  these languid women carry venom in their tongues? I had always thought she was  of too easy a disposition to feel anger or display it; but the spring of a  serpent is all the deadlier for his long silent basking in the sun. O pardon me  for making such a frightful allusion. But if you had seen her and heard Mr.  Sylvester&rsquo;s sigh as he turned and left the room!&rdquo;</p>
   <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Bertram Sylvester has awakened my deepest interest. His uncle has told me his  story, which alone of all the things I have heard in this house, I do not feel  at liberty to repeat, and it has aroused in me strange thoughts and very  peculiar emotions. He is devoted to some one we do not know, and the idea  surrounds him in my eyes with a sort of halo that you would perhaps call  fanciful, but which I am nevertheless bound to reverence. He does not know that  I am acquainted with his story. I wish he did and would let me speak the words  that rise to my lips whenever I see him or hear him play.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are moments when I long to flee back to Grotewell. It is when Cousin Ona comes  in from shopping with a dozen packages to be opened and commented upon, or when  Mrs. Fitzgerald has been here or some other of her ultra-fashionable  acquaintances. The atmosphere of the house for hours after either of the above  occurrences is too heavy for breathing. I have to go away and clear my brain by  a brisk walk or a look into Kn&oelig;dler&rsquo;s or Schaus&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
 <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  panel where Cousin Ona&rsquo;s picture used to hang, has been filled by one of  Meissonier&rsquo;s most interesting studies; and though I never thought Mr. Sylvester  particularly fond of the French style of art, he seems very well satisfied with  the result. I cannot understand how Cousin Ona can regard the misfortune to her  portrait so calmly. I think it would break my heart to see a husband look with  complacency on any picture, no matter how exquisite, that took the place of my  own, especially if like her&rsquo;s, it was painted in my bridal days. I sometimes  wonder if those days are as sacred to the memory of husband and wife as I have  always imagined them to be.&rdquo;</p>
 <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  does Cousin Ona never speak of Grotewell, and why, if by chance I mention the  name, does she drop her eyes and a shadow cross the countenance of Mr.  Sylvester?&rdquo;</p>
 <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is a word Mr. Sylvester uses in the most curious way; it is <i>fuss</i>. He  calls everything a fuss that while insignificant in size or character has power  either to irritate or please. A fly is a fuss; so is a dimple in a girl&rsquo;s cheek  or a figure that goes wrong in accounts. I have even heard him call a child, &lsquo;That  dear little fuss.&rsquo; Bertram unconsciously imitates his uncle in this peculiar  mannerism and is often heard alluding to this or that as a <i>fuss of fusses</i>.  Indeed they say this use of the word is a peculiarity of the Sylvester family.&rdquo;</p>
 <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think from the way Mr. Sylvester spoke yesterday, that he must have experienced  some dreadful trouble in his life. We were walking in the wards of a  hospital&mdash;that is, Miss Stuyvesant, Mr. Sylvester and myself&mdash;when some one near  us gave utterance to the trite expression, &lsquo;O it will heal, but the scar will  always remain.&rsquo; &lsquo;That is a common saying,&rsquo; remarked Mr. Sylvester, &lsquo;but how  true a one no one realizes but he who carries the scar.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
 <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may be imagination or simply the effect of increased appreciation on my part,  but it does seem as if Miss Stuyvesant grew lovelier and more companionable each  time that I meet her. She makes me think of a temple in which a holy lamp is  burning. Her very silences are eloquent, and yet she is never <i>distraite</i> but always cheerful and frequently the brightest of the company. But it is a  brightness without glitter, a gentle lustre that delights you but never  astonishes. I meet many sweet girls in the so-called heartless circles of  society, but none like her. She is my white lily on which a moonbeam rests.&rdquo;</p>
 <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  house contains a mystery, as Ona is pleased to designate the room at the top of  the house to which Mr. Sylvester withdraws when he desires to be alone. And  indeed it is a sort of Bluebeard&rsquo;s chamber, in that he keeps it rigidly under  lock and key, allowing no one to enter it, not even his wife. The servants  declare that no one but himself has ever crossed its threshold, but I can  scarcely believe that. Ona has not, but there must surely be some trusty person  to whom he allots the care of its furniture. Am I only proving myself to be a  true member of my sex when I allow that I cannot hinder my own curiosity from  hovering about a spot so religiously guarded? Yet what should we see if its  doors were thrown open? A study surrounded with books it displeases him to see  misplaced, or a luxurious apartment fitted with every appointment necessary to  rest and comfort him when he comes home tired from business.&rdquo;</p>
 <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never saw Mr. Sylvester angry till to-day. By some inadvertence he went down  town without locking the door of his private room, and though he returned immediately  upon missing the key from his pocket, he was barely in time to prevent Cousin  Ona from invading the spot he has always kept so sacred from intrusion. I was  not present and of course did not hear what was said, but I caught a glimpse of  his face as he left the house, and found it quite sufficient to assure me of  his dissatisfaction. As for Ona, she declares he pulled her back as if she had  been daring the plague. &lsquo;I do not expect to find five beautiful wives hanging  up there by their necks,&rsquo; concluded she with a forced laugh, &lsquo;but I shall yet  see the interior of that room, if only to establish my prerogative as the  mistress of this house.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not now feel as if I wished to see it.&rdquo;</p>
 <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is one thing that strikes me as peculiar in Miss Stuyvesant, and that is, that  as much pleasure as she seems to take in my society when we meet, she never  comes to see me in Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s house. For a long time I wondered over this  but said nothing, but one day upon receiving a second invitation to visit her,  I mentioned the fact as delicately as I could, and was quite distressed to  observe how seriously she took the rebuke, if rebuke it could be called. &lsquo;I  cannot explain myself,&rsquo; she murmured in some embarrassment; &lsquo;but Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s  house is closed against me. You must not ask me to seek you there or expect me  to do myself the pleasure of attending Mrs. Sylvester&rsquo;s receptions. I cannot.  Is that enough for me to say to my dearest friend?&rsquo; I hardly knew what to  reply, but finally ventured to inquire if she was restrained by any fact that  would make it undignified in me to seek her society and enjoy the pleasures she  is continually offering me. And she answered with such a cheerful negative I  was quite reassured. And so the matter is settled. Our friendship is to be  emancipated from the bonds of etiquette and I am to enjoy her company whenever  I can. To-morrow we are going to take our first ride in the park. The horses  have been bought, and much to Cousin Ona&rsquo;s satisfaction, the groom has been  hired.&rdquo;</p>
 <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was told something the other day, of a nature so unpleasant that I should not  think of repeating it, if you had not expressly commanded me to confide to you  everything that for any reason produced an effect upon me in my new home. My  informant was Sarah, the somewhat gossiping woman whom Ona has about her as  seamstress and maid. She said&mdash;and she had spoken before I could prevent  her&mdash;that the way Mrs. Sylvester took on about her mourning at the time of  little Geraldine&rsquo;s death was enough to wear out the patience of Job. She even  went so far as to tell the dressmaker that if she could not have her dress made  to suit her she would not put on mourning at all! Aunty, can you wonder that  Mr. Sylvester looks so bitterly sombre whenever mention is made of his child?  He loved it, and its own mother could worry over the fit of a dress while his  bereaved heart was breaking! I confess I can never feel the same indulgence  towards what I considered the idiosyncrasies of a fashionable beauty again. Her  smooth white skin makes me tremble; it has never flushed with delight over the  innocent smiles of her firstborn.&rdquo;</p>
 <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Sylvester is very polite to Cousin Ona and seems to yield to her wishes in  everything. But if I were she I think my heart would break over that very  politeness. But then she is one who demands formality even from the persons of  her household. I have never seen him stoop for a kiss or beheld her even so  much as lay her hand on his shoulder. But I have observed him wait on her at  moments when he was pale from weariness and she flushed with long twilight  reclinings before her sleepy boudoir fire.&rdquo;</p>
 <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are times when I would not exchange my present opportunities for any others  which might be afforded me. General &mdash; dined here to-day, and what a vision of  a great struggle was raised up before me by his few simple words in regard to  Gettysburg. I did not know which to admire most, the military bearing and vivid  conversation of the great soldier, or the ease and dignity with which Mr.  Sylvester met his remarks and answered each glowing sentence. General &mdash; spoke  a few words to me. How gentle these lion-like men can be when they stoop their  tall heads to address little children or young women!&rdquo;</p>
 <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a noble-hearted man Mr. Sylvester is! Mr. Turner in speaking of him the other  night, declared there is no one in his congregation who in a quiet way does so  much for the poor. &lsquo;He is especially interested in young men,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and  will leave his own affairs at any time to aid or advise them.&rsquo; I knew Mr.  Sylvester was kind, but Mr. Turner&rsquo;s enthusiasm was uncommon. He evidently  admires Mr. Sylvester as much as every one else loves him. And he is not alone  in this. Almost every day I hear some remark made of a nature complimentary to  my benefactor&rsquo;s character or ability. Even Mr. Stuyvesant who so seldom appears  to notice us girls, once interrupted a conversation between Cicely and myself  to inquire if Mr. Sylvester was quite well. &lsquo;I thought he looked pale to-day,&rsquo;  remarked he, in his dry but not unkindly way, and then added, &lsquo;He must not get  sick; he is too valuable to us.&rsquo; This was a great deal for Mr. Stuyvesant to  say, and it caused a visible gratification to Mr. Sylvester when I related it  to him in the evening. &lsquo;I had rather satisfy that man than any other I know,&rsquo;  declared he. &lsquo;He is of the stern old-fashioned sort, and it is an honor to any  one to merit his approval.&rsquo; I did not tell him that I had also heard Mr.  Stuyvesant observe in a conversation with some business friend of his, that  Edward Sylvester was the only speculator he knew in whom he felt implicit  confidence. Somehow it always gives me an uncomfortable feeling to hear Mr.  Sylvester alluded to as a speculator. Besides since he has entered the Bank, he  has I am told, entirely restricted himself to what are called legitimate  operations.&rdquo;</p>
 <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Sylvester came home with a dreadful look on his face to-day. We were standing  in the hall at the time the door opened, and he went by us without a nod,  almost as if he did not see us. Even Ona was startled and stood gazing after  him with an anxiety such as I had never observed in her before, while I was  conscious of that sick feeling I have sometimes experienced when he came upon  me suddenly from his small room above, or paused in the midst of the gayest  talk, to ask me some question that was wholly irrelevant and most frequently  sad.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He  has met with some heavy loss,&rsquo; murmured his wife, glancing down the handsome  parlors with a look such as a mother might bestow upon the face of a sick  child. But I was sure she had not sounded his trouble, and in my impetuosity  was about to fly to his side when we saw him pause before the image of Luxury  that stands on the stair, look at it for a moment with a strange intentness,  then suddenly and with a gesture of irrepressible passion, lift his arm as if  he would fell it from its place. The action was so startling, Ona clutched my  sleeve in terror, but he passed on and in another moment we heard him shut the  door of his room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  he be down to dinner? that was the next question. Ona thought not; I did not  dare to think. Nevertheless it was a great relief to me when I saw him enter  the dining-room with that set immovable look he sometimes wears when Ona begins  one of her long and rambling streams of fashionable gossip. &lsquo;It is nothing,&rsquo;  flashed from his wife&rsquo;s eyes to mine, and she lapsed at once into her most  graceful self, but she nevertheless hastened her meal and I was quite prepared  to observe her follow him, as with the polite excuse of weariness, he left the  table before desert. I could not hear what she asked him, but his answer came  distinctly to my ears from the midst of the library to which they had  withdrawn. &lsquo;It is nothing in which you have an interest, Ona. Thank heaven you  do not always know the price with which the splendors you so love are bought.&rsquo;  And she did not cry out, &lsquo;O never pay such a price for any joy of mine! Sooner  than cost you so dear I would live on crusts and dwell in a garret.&rsquo; No, she  kept silence, and when in a few minutes later I joined her in the library, it  was to find on her usually placid lips, a thin cool smile that struck like ice  to my heart, and made it impossible for me to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the hardest trial of the day was to hear Mr. Sylvester come in at eleven o&rsquo;clock&mdash;he  went out again immediately after dinner&mdash;and go up stairs without giving me my  usual good-night. It was such a grief to me I could not keep still, but hurried  to the foot of the stairs in the hopes he would yet remember me and come back.  But instead of that, he no sooner saw me than he threw out his hand almost as  if he would push me back, and hastened on up the whole winding flight till he  reached the refuge of that mysterious room of his at the top of the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  could not go back to Ona after that&mdash;she had been to make a call somewhere with  a young gentleman friend of hers;&mdash;yes on this very night had been to make a  call&mdash;but I took advantage of the late hour to retire to my own room where for a  long time I lay awake listening for his descending step and seeing, as in a  vision, the startling picture of his lifted arm raised against the unconscious  piece of bronze on the stair. Henceforth that statue will possess for me a  still more dreadful significance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the twenty-fifth of February. Why should I feel as if I must be sure of the  exact date before I slept?&rdquo;</p>
 <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>The  next extract followed close on this and was the last which Miss Belinda read.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Sylvester seems to have recovered from his late anxiety. He does not shrink  from me any more with that half bitter, half sad expression that has so long  troubled and bewildered me, but draws me to his side and sits listening to my  talk until I feel as if I were really of some comfort to this great and able  man. Ona does not notice the change; she is all absorbed in preparing for the  visit to Washington, which Mr. Sylvester has promised her.&rdquo;</p>
 <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>Miss  Belinda calmly folded up the letters and locked them again in the little  mahogany box, after which she covered up the embers and quietly went to bed.  But next morning a letter was despatched to Mr. Sylvester which ran thus:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  Mr. Sylvester:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  the present at least you may keep Paula with you. But I am not ready to say  that I think it would be for her best good to be received and acknowledged as  your daughter&mdash;yet. Hoping you will appreciate the motives that actuate this  decision,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  remain, respectfully yours,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Belinda  Ann Walton.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A  ride in the Central Park is an every-day matter to most people. It signifies an  indolent bowling over a smooth road all alive with the glitter of passing  equipages, waving ribbons and fluttering plumes, and brightened now and then by  the sight of a well known face amid the general rush of old and young, plain  and handsome, sad and gay countenances that flash by you in one long and  brilliant procession.</p>
  <p>But  to Paula and her friend Miss Stuyvesant starting out in the early freshness of  a fair April morning, it meant new life, reawakening joy, the sparkle of young  leaves just loosed from the bonds of winter, the sweetness and promise of  spring airs, and all the budding glory of a new year with its summer of  countless roses and its autumn of incalculable glories. Not the twitter of a  bird was lost to them, not the smile of an opening flower, not the welcome of a  waving branch. Youth, joy, and innocence lived in their hearts and showed them  nothing in the mirror of nature that was not equally young, joyous and  innocent. Then they were alone, or sufficiently so. The stray wanderers whom  they met sitting under the flowering trees, were equally with themselves lovers  of nature or they would not be seated in converse with it at this early hour;  while the laugh of little children startled from their play by the prance of  their high-stepping horses, was only another expression of the sweet but  unexpressed delight that breathed in all the radiant atmosphere.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are two birds who have escaped thralldom and are taking our first flight into  our natural ether,&rdquo; cried Miss Stuyvesant gaily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are two pioneers lit by the spirit of adventure, who have left the cosy hearth  of wintry-fires to explore the domains of the frost king, and lo, we have come  upon a Paradise of bloom and color!&rdquo; responded the ringing voice of Paula.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  feel as if I could mount that little white cloud we see over there,&rdquo; continued  Cicely with a quick lively wave of her whip. &ldquo;I wonder how Dandy would enjoy an  empyrean journey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  the haughty bend of his neck I should say he was quite satisfied with his  present condition. But perhaps his chief pride is due to the mistress he  carries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you attempting to vie with Mr. Williams, Paula?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Williams was the meek-eyed, fair complexioned gentleman, whose predilection for  compliment was just then a subject of talk in fashionable circles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  so far as my admiration goes of the most charming lady I see this morning. But  who is this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Stuyvesant looked up. &ldquo;Ah, that is some one with whom there is very little  danger of your falling in love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paula  blushed. The gentleman approaching them upon horseback was conspicuous for long  side whiskers of a decidedly auburn tinge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  name is&mdash;&rdquo; But she had not time to finish, for the gentleman with a glance of  astonished delight at Paula, bowed to the speaker with a liveliness and grace  that demanded some recognition.</p>
  <p>Instantly  he drew rein. &ldquo;Do I behold Miss Stuyvesant among the nymphs!&rdquo; cried he, in those  ringing pleasant tones that at once predispose you towards their possessor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you allude to my friend Miss Fairchild, you certainly do, Mr. Ensign,&rdquo; the  wicked little lady rejoined with a waiving of her usual ceremony that  astonished Paula.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Ensign bestowed upon them his most courtly bow, but the flush that mounted to  his brow&mdash;making his face one red, as certain of his friends were malicious  enough to observe on similar occasions&mdash;indicated that he had been taken a  little more at his word than perhaps suited even one of his easy and  proverbially careless temperament. &ldquo;Miss Fairchild will understand that I am  not a Harvey Williams&mdash;at least before an introduction,&rdquo; said he with something  like seriousness.</p>
  <p>But  at this allusion to the gentleman whose name had been upon their lips but a  moment before, both ladies laughed outright.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have just been accused of attempting the r&ocirc;le of that gentleman myself,&rdquo;  exclaimed Paula. &ldquo;If the fresh morning air will persist in painting such roses  on ladies&rsquo; cheeks,&rdquo; continued she, with a loving look at her pretty companion &ldquo;what  can one be expected to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Admire,&rdquo;  quoth the red bannered cavalier with a glance, however, at the beautiful  speaker instead of the demure little Cicely at her side.</p>
  <p>Miss  Stuyvesant perceived this look and a curious smile disturbed the corners of her  rosy lips. &ldquo;What a fortunate man to be able to do the right thing at the right  time,&rdquo; laughed she, gaily touching up her horse that was beginning to show  symptoms of restlessness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  Miss Stuyvesant will put that in the future tense and then assure us she has  been among the prophets, I should be singularly obliged,&rdquo; said he with a touch  of his hat and a smiling look at Paula that was at once manly and gentle,  careless and yet respectful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  life is too bright for prophesies this morning. The moment is enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it Miss Fairchild?&rdquo; queried Mr. Ensign looking back over his shoulder.</p>
  <p>She  turned just a bit of her cheek towards him. &ldquo;What Miss Stuyvesant declares to  be true, that am I bound to believe,&rdquo; said she, and with the least little  ripple of a laugh, rode on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a pity you have such a dislike for whiskers,&rdquo; Cicely presently remarked with  an air of great gravity.</p>
  <p>Paula  gave a start and cast a glance of reproach at her companion. &ldquo;I did not notice  his whiskers after the first word or two,&rdquo; said she, fixing her eyes on a turn  of the road before them. &ldquo;Such cheerfulness is infectious. I was merry before,  but now I feel as if I had been bathed in sunshine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cicely&rsquo;s  eyes flashed wide with surprise and her face grew serious in earnest. &ldquo;Mr.  Ensign is a delightful companion,&rdquo; observed she; &ldquo;a room is always brighter for  his entrance; and with all that, he is the only young man I know, who having  come into a large fortune, feels any of the responsibilities of his position.  The sunshine is the result of a good heart and pure living, and that is what  makes it infectious, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us canter,&rdquo; said Paula. And so the glad young things swept on, life breaking in  bubbles around them and rippling away into unfathomable wells of feeling in one  of their pure hearts at least. Suddenly a hand seemed to swoop from heaven and  dash them both back in dismay. They had reached one of those places where the  foot path crosses the equestrian and they had run over and thrown down a little  child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O  heaven!&rdquo; cried Paula leaping from her horse, &ldquo;I had rather been killed myself.&rdquo;  The groom rode up and she bent anxiously over the child.</p>
  <p>It  was a boy of some seven or eight years, whose misfortune&mdash;he was lame, as the  little crutch fallen at his side sufficiently denoted&mdash;made appear much younger.  He had been struck on his arm and was moaning with pain, but did not seem to be  otherwise hurt. &ldquo;Are you alone?&rdquo; cried Paula, lifting his head on her arm and  glancing hurriedly about.</p>
  <p>The  little fellow raised his heavy lids and for a moment stared into her face with  eyes so deeply blue and beautiful they almost startled her, then with an effort  pointed down the path, saying,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s  over there in the long tunnel talking to some one. Tell him I got hurt. I want  Dad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  gently lifted him to his feet and led him out of the road into the apparently  deserted path where she made him sit down. &ldquo;I am going to find his father,&rdquo;  said Paula to Cicely, &ldquo;I will be back in a moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  wait; you shall not go alone,&rdquo; authoritatively exclaimed that little damsel,  leaping in her turn to the ground. &ldquo;Where does he say his father is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the tunnel, by which I suppose he means that long passage under the bridge over  there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Holding  up the skirts of their riding-habits in their trembling right hands, they  hurried forward. Suddenly they both paused. A woman had crossed their path; a  woman whom to look at but once was to remember with ghastly shrinking for a  lifetime. She was wrapped in a long and ragged cloak, and her eyes, startling  in their blackness, were fixed upon the pain-drawn countenance of the poor  little hurt boy behind them, with a gleam whose feverish hatred and deep  malignant enjoyment of his very evident sufferings, was like a revelation from  the lowest pit to the two innocent-minded girls hastening forward on their  errand of mercy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  he much hurt?&rdquo; gasped the woman in an ineffectual effort to conceal the evil  nature of her interest. &ldquo;Do you think he will die?&rdquo; with a shrill lingering  emphasis on the last word as if she longed to roll it like a sweet morsel under  her tongue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  are you?&rdquo; asked Cicely, shrinking to one side with dilated eyes fixed on the  woman&rsquo;s hardened countenance and the white, too white hand with which she had  pointed as she spoke of the child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you his mother?&rdquo; queried Paula, paling at the thought but keeping her ground  with an air of unconscious authority.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  mother!&rdquo; shrieked the woman, hugging herself in her long cloak and laughing  with fiendish sarcasm: &ldquo;I look like his mother, don&rsquo;t I? His eyes&mdash;did you  notice his eyes? they are just like mine, aren&rsquo;t they? and his body, poor  weazen little thing, looks as if it had drawn sustenance from mine, don&rsquo;t it?  His mother! O heaven!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nothing  like the suppressed force of this invocation seething as it was with the worst  passions of a depraved human nature, had ever startled those ears before.  Clasping Cicely by the hand, she called out to the groom behind them, &ldquo;Guard  that child as you would your life!&rdquo; and then flashing upon the wretched  creature before her with all the force of her aroused nature, she exclaimed, &ldquo;If  you are not his mother, move aside and let us pass, we are in search of  assistance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  an instant the woman stood awe-struck before this vision of maidenly beauty and  indignation, then she laughed and cried out with shrill emphasis:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  next you look like that, go to your mirror, and when you see the image it  reflects, say to yourself, &lsquo;So once looked the woman who defied me in the Park!&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>With  a quick shudder and a feeling as if the noisome cloak of this degraded being  had somehow been dropped upon her own fair and spotless shoulders, Paula  clasped the hand of Cicely more tightly in her own, and rushed with her down  the steps that led into the underground passage towards which they had been  directed.</p>
  <p>There  were but two persons in it when they entered. A short thickset man and another  man of a slighter and more gentlemanly build. They were engaged in talking, and  the latter was bringing down his right hand upon the palm of his left with a  gesture almost foreign in its expressive energy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  tell you,&rdquo; declared he, with a voice that while low, reverberated through the  hollow vault above him with strange intensity, &ldquo;I tell you I&rsquo;ve got my grip on  a certain rich man in this city, and if you will only wait, you shall see  strange things. I don&rsquo;t know his name and I don&rsquo;t know his face, but I do know  what he has done, and a thousand dollars down couldn&rsquo;t buy the knowledge of me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if you don&rsquo;t know his name and don&rsquo;t know his face, how in the name of all that&rsquo;s  mischievous are you going to know your man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave  that to me! If I once meet him and hear him talk, one more rich man goes down  and one more poor devil goes up, or I&rsquo;ve not the wit that starvation usually  teaches.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  nature of these sentences together with the various manifestations of interest  with which they were received, had for a moment deterred the two girls in their  hurried advance, but now they put away every thought save that of the poor  little creature awaiting his Dad, and lifting up her voice, Paula said,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  either of you the father of a little lame lad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Instantly  and before she could conclude, the taller of the two, who had also been the  chief speaker in the above conversation, turned, and she saw his hand begrimed  though it was with dirt and dark with many a disgraceful trick, go to his heart  in a gesture too natural to be anything but involuntary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  he hurt?&rdquo; gasped he, but in how different a tone from that of the woman who had  used the same words a few minutes before. Then seeing that the persons who  addressed him were ladies and one of them at least a very beautiful one, took  off his hat with an easy action, that together with what they had heard, proved  him to be one of that most dangerous class among us, a gentleman who has gone  thoroughly and irretrievably to the bad.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am afraid he is, sir,&rdquo; said Paula. &ldquo;He was attempting to cross the road, and a  horse advancing hurriedly, struck him.&rdquo; She had not courage to say her horse in  face of the white and trembling dismay that seized him at these words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is he?&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my poor boy?&rdquo; And he bounded up the steps, his hat  still in his hand, his long unkempt locks flying, and his whole form expressive  of the utmost alarm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Down  by the carriage road,&rdquo; called out Paula, finding it impossible for them to keep  up with such haste.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  is he much injured?&rdquo; cried a smooth voice at their side.</p>
  <p>They  turned; it was the short thickset man who had been the other&rsquo;s companion in the  conversation above recorded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  trust not,&rdquo; answered Cicely; &ldquo;his arm received the blow, and he suffers very  much, but we hope it is not serious;&rdquo; and they hurried on.</p>
  <p>They  found the father seated on the grass holding the little fellow in his arms. The  look on his once handsome but now thoroughly corrupt and dissipated face, made  their hearts melt within them. However wicked he might be&mdash;and that sly  treacherous eye, that false impudent lip, that settling of the whole face into  the mould which Vice applies to all her votaries, left no doubt of his complete  depravity&mdash;he dearly loved his child, and love, no matter how it is expressed,  or in what garb it appears, is a sacred and beautiful thing, and ennobles for  the time being any creature who displays it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Twas  a hard knock up, Dad,&rdquo; came from the white lips of the child as he felt his  father&rsquo;s trembling hand feel up and down his arm, &ldquo;but I guess the &lsquo;little  fellar&rsquo; can stand it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Little feller&rdquo; was evidently the name by which his  father was accustomed to address him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are no bones broken,&rdquo; said the father. &ldquo;To be lame and maimed too would be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  did not finish, for a delicately gloved hand was here laid on his sleeve, and a  gentle voice whispered, &ldquo;Money cannot pay for an injury like that, but please  accept this;&rdquo; and Paula thrust a purse into his hand.</p>
  <p>He  clutched it eagerly, but at her next request that he should tell her where he  lived that they might inquire after the boy, he shook his head with a return of  his old emphasis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  haunts of bats and jackals are not for ladies.&rdquo; Then as he caught sight of her  pitiful face bending in farewell over the little urchin, some remembrance  perhaps of the days when he had a right to stoop to the ear of beautiful women  and walk unrebuked at their side, returned to him from the past, and  respectfully lowering his voice, he asked her name.</p>
  <p>She  gave it and he seemed to lay it away in his mind; then as the ladies turned to  remount their horses, rose and began carrying the little fellow off. As he  vanished in the turn of the path that led towards the main entrance, they  perceived a tall dark figure arise from a seat in the distance and stand  looking after him, with a leer on its face and a malicious hugging of itself in  a long black cloak, that proclaimed her to be the same ominous being who had  before so grievously startled them.</p>

  <p>Mrs.  Sylvester reclining on the palest of blue couches, in the slanting sunlight of  an April afternoon, is a study for a painter. Not that such inspiring  loveliness breathed from her person, conspicuous as it was for its rich and  indolent grace, but because in every attitude of her large and well formed  limbs, in every raise of the thick white lids from eyes whose natural  brightness was obscured by the mist of aimless fancies, she presented such an  embodiment of luxurious ease, one might almost imagine they were gazing upon  the favorite Sultana of some eastern court, or, to be for once poetical as the  subject demands, a full blown Egyptian lotos floating in hushed enjoyment on  the placid waters of its native stream. Indeed for all the blonde character of  her beauty, there was certainly something oriental about the physique of this  favored child of fortune. Had the tint of her skin been richened to a magnolia  bloom instead of reminding you of that description accorded to the complexion  of one of Napoleon&rsquo;s sisters, that it looked like white satin seen through pink  glass, she would have passed in any Eastern market, for a rare specimen of  Circassian beauty.</p>
  <p>But  Mr. Sylvester coming home fatigued and harassed, cared little for Circassian  beauties or Oriental odalisques. It was a welcome that he desired, and such  refreshment as a quick eye and ready hand can bestow when guided by a tender  and loving heart; or so thought the watchful Paula as she glided from her room  at the sound of his step in the hall, and met him coming weary and disheartened  from the side of Ona&rsquo;s couch. The sight of her revived him at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  little one, what have you been doing to-day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Instantly  a shade fell over her countenance. &ldquo;I hardly know how to tell you. It has been  a day of great experiences to me. I am literally shaken with them. I have been  wanting to talk to Ona about what I have seen and heard, but thought I had best  wait till you came home, for I could not repeat the story twice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  you look pale. Nothing has happened to frighten you I hope,&rdquo; exclaimed he,  leading her back to Ona&rsquo;s side, who stirred a little, and presently deigned to  take an upright position.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know if it is fear or horror,&rdquo; cried Paula, shuddering; &ldquo;I have seen a  fearful woman&mdash;But first I ought to tell you that I took a ride with Miss  Stuyvesant in the Park this morning&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and persisted in going for that lady on horseback instead of sending the groom  after her, and all starting from the front of our house,&rdquo; murmured Mrs.  Sylvester with lazy chagrin.</p>
  <p>Paula  smiled, but otherwise took no notice of this standing topic of disagreement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was a beautiful day,&rdquo; she proceeded, &ldquo;and we enjoyed it very much, but we were  so unfortunate as to run over a little boy, at that place where the equestrian  road crosses the foot path; a lame child, Mr. Sylvester, who could not get out  of our way; poor too, with a ragged jacket on which seemed to make it all the  worse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ona  gave a shrug with her white shoulders, that seemed to question this. &ldquo;Did you  injure him very much?&rdquo; queried she, with a show of interest; not sufficient  however to impair her curiosity as to the cut of one of her nails.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot say; his little arm was struck, and when I went to pick him up, he lay  back in my lap and moaned till I thought my heart would break. But that was not  the worst that happened. As we went hurrying up the walk to find the child&rsquo;s  father, we were met by a woman wrapped in a black cloak whose long and greasy  folds seemed like the symbol of her own untold depravity. Her glance as she  encountered the child writhing in pain at my feet, made my heart stand still.  It was more than malignant, it was actually fiendish. &lsquo;Is he hurt?&rsquo; she asked,  and it seemed as if she gloated over the question; she evidently longed to hear  that he was, longed to be told that he would die; and when I inquired if she  was his mother, she broke into a string of laughter, that seemed to darken the  daylight. &lsquo;His mother! O yes, we look alike, don&rsquo;t we!&rsquo; she exclaimed, pointing  with a mocking gesture frightful to see, first at his eyes which were very blue  and beautiful, and then at her own which were dark as evil thoughts could make  them. I never saw anything so dreadful. Malignancy! and towards a little lame  child! what could be more horrible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester and his wife exchanged looks, then the former asked, &ldquo;Did she follow  you, Paula?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  after telling me that I&mdash;But I cannot repeat what she said,&rdquo; exclaimed the young  girl with a quick shudder. &ldquo;Since I came home,&rdquo; she musingly continued, &ldquo;I have  looked and looked at my face in the glass, but I cannot believe that what she  declared is true. There is no similarity between us, could never have been any:  I will not have it that she ever saw in all the days of her life such a picture  as that in her glass.&rdquo; And with a sudden gesture Paula started up and pointed  to herself as she stood reflected in one of the tall mirrors with which Ona&rsquo;s  boudoir abounded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  did she dare to make any comparison between you and her own degraded self?&rdquo;  exclaimed Mr. Sylvester, with a glance at the exquisite vision of pure girlhood  thus doubly presented to his notice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  what I am, she was once, or so she said. And it may be true. I have never  suffered sorrow or experienced wrong, and cannot measure their power to carve  the human face with such lines as I beheld on that woman&rsquo;s countenance to-day.  But do not let us talk of her any more. She left us at last, and we found the  child&rsquo;s father. Mr. Sylvester,&rdquo; she suddenly asked, &ldquo;are there to be found in  this city, men occupying honorable positions and as such highly esteemed, who  like Damocles of old, may be said to sit under the constant terror of a falling  sword in the shape of some possible disclosure, that if made, would ruin their  position before the world forever?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester started as if he had been shot. &ldquo;Paula!&rdquo; cried he, and instantly was  silent again. He did not look at his wife, but if he had, he would have  perceived that even her fair skin was capable of blanching to a yet more startling  whiteness, and that her sleepy eyes could flash open with something like  expression in their lazy depths.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean,&rdquo; dreamily continued Paula, absorbed in her own remembrance, &ldquo;that if what  we overheard said by the father of that child to-day is true, some one of our  prominent men, whose life is not all it appears, is standing on the verge of  possible exposure and shame; that a hound is on his track in the form of a  starving man; and that sooner or later he will have to pay the price of an  unprincipled creature&rsquo;s silence, or fall into public discredit like some others  of whom we have lately read.&rdquo; Then as silence filled the room, she added, &ldquo;It  makes me tremble to think that a man of means and seeming honor should be  placed in such a position, but worse still that we may know such a one and be  ignorant of his misery and his shame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is getting time for me to dress,&rdquo; murmured Ona, sinking back on her pillow and  speaking in her most languid tone of voice. &ldquo;Could you not hasten your story a  little Paula?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Mr. Sylvester with a hurried glance at the closing eyes of his wife, requested  on the contrary that she would explain herself more definitely. &ldquo;Ona will  pardon the delay,&rdquo; said he, with a set, strained politeness that called up the  least little quiver of suppressed sarcasm about the rosy infantile lips that he  evidently did not consider it worth his while to notice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  that is all,&rdquo; said Paula. However she repeated as nearly as she could just what  the boy&rsquo;s father had said. At the conclusion Mr. Sylvester rose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  kind of a looking man was he?&rdquo; said that gentleman as he crossed to the window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  as nearly as I can describe, he was tall, dark and seedy, with a shock of black  hair and a pair of black whiskers that floated on the wind as he walked. He was  evidently of the order of decayed gentleman, and his manner of talking,  especially in the profuse use he made of his arms and hands, was decidedly  foreign. Yet his speech was pure and without accent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester&rsquo;s face as he asked the next question was comparatively cheerful. &ldquo;Was  the other man with whom he was talking, as dark and foreign as himself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O  no, he was round and jovial, a little too insinuating perhaps, in his way of  speaking to ladies, but otherwise a well enough appearing man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester bowed and looked at his watch. (Why do gentlemen always consult their  watches even in the face of the clock?) &ldquo;Ona, you are right,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is  time you were dressing for dinner.&rdquo; And concluding with a word or two of  sympathy as to the peculiar nature of Paula&rsquo;s adventures as he called them, he  hastened from the room and proceeded to his little refuge above.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has not asked me what became of the child,&rdquo; thought Paula, with a certain pang  of surprise. &ldquo;I expected him to say, &lsquo;Shall we not try and see the little  fellow, Paula?&rsquo; if only to allow me to explain that the child&rsquo;s father would  not tell me where they lived. But the later affair has evidently put the child  out of his head. And indeed it is only natural that a business man should be  more interested in such a fact as I have related, than in the sprained arm of a  wretched creature&rsquo;s &lsquo;little feller.&rsquo; &rdquo; And she turned to assist Ona, who had  arisen from her couch and was now absorbed in the intricacies of an uncommonly  elaborate toilet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those  men did not mention any names?&rdquo; suddenly queried that lady, looking with an  expression of careful anxiety, at the twist of her back hair, in the small  hand-mirror she held over her shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Paula, dropping a red rose into the blonde locks she was so carefully  arranging. &ldquo;He expressly said he did not know the name of the person to whom he  alluded. It was a strange conversation for me to overhear, was it not?&rdquo; she  remarked, happy to have interested her cousin in anything out of the domains of  fashion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know&mdash;certainly&mdash;of course&mdash;&rdquo; returned Mrs. Sylvester with some incoherence.  &ldquo;Do you think red looks as well with this black as the lavender would do?&rdquo; she  rambled on in her lightest tone, pulling out a box of feathers.</p>
  <p>Paula  gave her a little wistful glance of disappointment and decided in favor of the  lavender.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am bound to look well to-night if I never do so again,&rdquo; said Ona. They were all  going to a public reception at which a foreign lord was expected to be present.  &ldquo;How fortunate I am to have a perfect little hairdresser in my own family,  without being obliged to send for some gossipy, fussy old Madame with her  stories of how such and such a one looked when dressed for the Grand Duke&rsquo;s  ball, or how Mrs. So and So always gave her more than her price because she  rolled up puffs so exquisitely.&rdquo; And stopping to aid the deft girl in  substituting the lavender feather for the red rose in her hair&mdash;she forgot to  ask any more questions.</p>
 <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ona,&rdquo;  remarked her husband, coming into the room on his way down to dinner&mdash;Mrs.  Sylvester never dined when she was going to any grand entertainment; it made  her look flushed she said&mdash;&ldquo;I am not in the habit of troubling you about your  family matters, but have you heard from your father of late?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Sylvester turned from her jewel-casket and calmly surveyed his face. It was  fixed and formal, the face he turned to his servants and sometimes&mdash;to his wife.  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she, with a light little gesture as though she were speaking of the  most trivial matter. &ldquo;In one respect at least, papa is like an angel, his  visits are few and far between.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester&rsquo;s eye-brows drew heavily together. For a man with a smile of strange  sweetness, he could sometimes look very forbidding. &ldquo;<i>When</i> was he here  last?&rdquo; he inquired in a tone more commanding than he knew.</p>
  <p>She  did not appear to resent it. &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; mused she. &ldquo;When was it I lost my  diamond ear-ring? O I remember, it was on the eve of New Year&rsquo;s day a year ago;  I recollect because I had to wear pearls with my garnet brocade,&rdquo; she pettishly  sighed. &ldquo;And papa came the next week, after you had given me the money for a  new pair. I have reason to remember <i>that</i>, for not a dollar did he leave  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ona!&rdquo;  exclaimed her husband, shrinking back in uncontrollable surprise, while his  eyes flashed inquiringly to her ears in which two noble diamonds were  brilliantly shining.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo;  she cried, just raising one snowy hand to those sparkling ornaments, while a  faint blush, the existence of which he had sometimes doubted, swept over her careless  face. &ldquo;I was enabled to procure them in time; but for a whole two months I had  to go without diamonds.&rdquo; She did not say that she had bartered her wedding  jewels to make up the sum she needed, but he may have understood that without  being told.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that is the last time you have seen him?&rdquo; He held her eyes with his, she could  not look away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  very last, sir; strange to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  glance shifted from her face and he turned with a bow towards the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I ask,&rdquo; she slowly inquired as he moved across the floor, &ldquo;what is the reason  of this sudden interest in poor papa?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;  said he, pausing and looking back, not without some emotion of pity in his  glance. &ldquo;I am sometimes struck with a sense of the duty I owe you, in helping  you to bear the burden of certain secret responsibilities which I fear may  sometimes prove too heavy for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  gave a little rippling laugh that only sounded hollow to the image listening in  the glass. &ldquo;You choose strange times in which to be struck,&rdquo; said she, holding  up two dresses for his inspection, with a lift of her brows evidently meant as  an inquiry as to which he thought the most becoming.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Conscience  is the chooser, not I,&rdquo; declared he, for once allowing himself to ignore the  weighty question of dress thus propounded.</p>
  <p>His  wife gave a little toss of her head and he left the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should like Edward very much,&rdquo; murmured she in a burst of confidence to her own  reflection in the glass, &ldquo;if only he would not bother himself so much about  that same disagreeable conscience.&rdquo;</p>
 <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  look unhappy,&rdquo; said Mr. Sylvester to Paula as they came from the dining-room. &ldquo;Have  the adventures of the day made such an impression upon you that you will not be  able to enjoy the evening&rsquo;s festivities?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  lifted her face and the quick smile came.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not like to see your brow so clouded,&rdquo; continued he, smoothing his own to  meet her searching eye. &ldquo;Smiles should sit on the lips of youth, or else why  are they so rosy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  you have me smile in face of my first glimpse of wickedness,&rdquo; asked she, but in  a gentle tone that robbed her words of half their reproach. &ldquo;You must remember  that I have had but little experience with the world. I have lived all my life  in a town of wholesome virtues, and while here I have been kept from contact with  anything low or base. I have never known vice, and now all in a moment I feel  as if I have been bathed in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  took her by the hand and drew her gently towards him. &ldquo;Does your whole being  recoil so from evil, my Paula? What will you do in this wicked world? What will  you say to the sinner when you meet him&mdash;as you must?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know; it&rsquo;s a problem I have never been brought to consider. I feel as if  launched on a dismal sea for which I have neither chart nor compass. Life was  so joyous to me this morning&mdash;&rdquo; a flush swept over her cheek but he did not  notice it&mdash;&ldquo;I held, or seemed to hold, a cup of white wine in my hand, but  suddenly as I looked at it, it turned black and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ah,  the outreach, the dismal breaking away of thought into the unfathomable, that  lies in the pause of an <i>and</i>!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  do you refuse to drink a cup across which has fallen a shadow,&rdquo; murmured Mr.  Sylvester, his eyes fixed on her face, &ldquo;the inevitable shadow of that great  mass of human frailty and woe which has been accumulating from the foundation  of the world?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no, I cannot, and retain my humanity. If there is such evil in the world, its  pressure must drive it across the path of innocence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you accept the cup?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must; but oh, my vanished beliefs! This morning the wine of my life was pure  and white, now it is black and befouled. What will make it clean again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a sigh Mr. Sylvester dropped her hand and turned towards the mantle-piece. It  was April as I have said, and there was no fire in the grate, but he posed his  foot on the fender and looked sadly down at the empty hearthstone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula,&rdquo;  said he after a space of pregnant silence, &ldquo;it had to come. The veil of the  temple must be rent in every life. Evil is too near us all for us to tread long  upon the flowers without starting up the adders that hide beneath them. You had  to have your first look into the cells of darkness, and perhaps it is best you  had it here and now. The deeps are for men&rsquo;s eyes as well as the starry  heavens.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are some persons,&rdquo; he went on slowly, &ldquo;you know them, who tread the ways of  life with their eyelids closed to everything but the strip of velvet lawn on  which they choose to walk. Earth&rsquo;s sighs and deep-drawn groans are nothing to  them. The world may swing on in its way to perdition; so long as their pathway  feels soft, they neither heed nor care. But you do not desire to be one of  these, Paula! With your great soul and your strong heart, you would not ask to  sit in a flowery maze, while the rest of the world went sliding on and down  into wells of destruction, you might have made pools of healing by the touch of  your womanly sympathy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot tell you, I dare not tell you,&rdquo; he went on in a strange pleading voice  that tore at the very roots of her heart, and rung in her memory forever, &ldquo;what  evil underlies the whole strata of life! At home and abroad, on our  hearthstones and within our offices, the mocking devil sits. You can scarcely  walk a block, my little one, without encountering a man or brushing against the  dress of a woman across whose soul the black shadow lies heavier than any words  of his or hers could tell. What the man you saw to-day, said of one unhappy  being in this city, is true, God help us all, of many. Dark spots are easier  acquired than blotted out, my Paula. In business as in society, one needs to  carry the white shield of a noble purpose or a self-forgetting love, to escape  the dripping of the deadly upas tree that branches above all humanity. I have  walked its ways, my darling, and I know of what I speak. Your white robe is  spotless but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O  there is where the pain comes in,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;there, just there, is where the  dagger strikes. She says she was once like me. O, could any temptation, any  suffering, any wrong or misfortune that might befall me, ever bring me to where  she is! If it could&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula!&rdquo;  This time his voice came authoritatively. &ldquo;You are making too much of a  frenzied woman&rsquo;s impulsive exclamation. To her darkened and despairing eyes any  young woman of a similar style of beauty would have called forth the same  remark. It was a sign that she was not entirely given up to evil, that she  could remember her youth. Instead of feeling contaminated by her words, you  ought to feel, that unconsciously to yourself, your fresh young countenance  with its innocent eyes did an angel&rsquo;s work to-day. They made her recall what  she was in the days of her own innocence; and who can tell what may follow such  a recollection.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O  Mr. Sylvester,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you fill me with shame. If I could think that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can, nothing appeals to the heart of crime like the glance of perfect  innocence. If evil walks the world, God&rsquo;s ministers walk it also, and none can  tell in what glance of the eye or what touch of the hand, that ministry will  speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was her turn now to take his hand in hers. &ldquo;O how good, how thoughtful you are;  you have comforted me and you have taught me. I thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a look she did not perceive, he drew his hand away. &ldquo;I am glad I have helped  you, Paula; there is but one thing more to say, and this I would emphasize with  every saddened look you have ever met in all your life. Great sins make great  sufferers. Side by side came the two dreadful powers of vice and retribution  into the world, and side by side will they keep till they sink at last into the  awful deeps of the bottomless pit. When you turn your back on a man who has  committed a crime, one more door shuts in his darkened spirit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  tears were falling from Paula&rsquo;s eyes now. He looked at them with strange  wistfulness and involuntarily his hand rose to her head, smoothing her locks  with fatherly touches. &ldquo;Do not think,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I would lessen by a hair&rsquo;s  breadth your hatred of evil. I can more easily bear to see the shadow upon your  cup of joy than upon the banner of truth you carry. These eyes must lose none  of their inner light in glancing compassionately on your fellow-men. Only  remember that divinity itself has stooped to rescue, and let the thought make  your contact with weary, wicked-hearted humanity a little less trying and a little  more hopeful to you. And now, my dear, that is enough of serious talk for  to-day. We are bound for a reception, you know, and it is time we were  dressing. Do you want me to tell you a secret?&rdquo; asked he in a light mysterious  tone, as he saw her eyes still filling.</p>
  <p>She  glanced up with sudden interest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it is treason,&rdquo; resumed he, &ldquo;I am fully aware of the grave nature of my  offence; but Paula I hate all public receptions, and shall only be able to  enjoy myself to-night just so much as I see that you are doing so. Life has its  dark portals and its bright ones. This is one that you must enter with your  most brilliant smiles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  they shall not be lacking,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;When a treasure-box of thought is given  us, we do not open it and scatter its contents abroad, but lay it away where  the heart keeps its secrets, to be opened in the hush of night when we are  alone with our own souls and God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  smiled and she moved towards the door. &ldquo;None the less do we carry with us  wherever we go, the remembrance of our hidden treasure,&rdquo; she smilingly added,  looking back upon him from the stair.</p>
  <p>And  again as upon the first night of her entrance into the house, did he stand  below and watch her as she softly went up, her lovely face flashing one moment  against the dark background of the luxurious bronze, towering from the platform  behind, then glowing with faint and fainter lustre, as the distance widened  between them and she vanished in the regions above.</p>
  <p>She  did not see the toss of his arm with which he threw off the burden that rested  upon his soul.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
    Grave And Gay</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;No  scandal about Queen Elizabeth I hope.&rdquo;&mdash;Sheridan.</p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Stands  Scotland where it did?&rdquo;&mdash;Macbeth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is that talking with Miss Stuyvesant?&rdquo; asked Mr. Sylvester, approaching his  wife during one of the lulls that will fall at times upon vast assemblies.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Sylvester followed the direction of his glance and immediately responded, &ldquo;O  that is Mr. Ensign, one of the best <i>partis</i> of the season. He evidently  knows where to pay his court.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  inquired because he has just requested me to honor him with a formal  introduction to Paula.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!  then oblige him by all means; it would be a great match for her. To say nothing  of his wealth, he is <i>haut ton</i>, and his red whiskers will not look badly  beside Paula&rsquo;s dark hair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester frowned, then sighed, but in a few minutes Paula observed him  approaching with Mr. Ensign. At once her hitherto pale cheek flushed, but the  young gentleman did not seem to object to that, and after the formal  introduction which he had sought was over, he exclaimed in his own bright  ringing tones,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  fates have surely forgotten their usual r&ocirc;le of unpropitiousness. I did not  dare hope to meet you here to-night, Miss Fairchild. Was the ride all that your  fancy painted?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo;  said she, speaking very low and glancing around, &ldquo;do not allude to it here. We  had an adventure shortly after you parted from us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  adventure! and no cavalier at your side! If I could but have known! Was it so  serious?&rdquo; he inquired in a moment, seeing her look grave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask  Miss Stuyvesant;&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I cannot talk about it any more to-night. Besides  the music carries off one&rsquo;s thoughts. It is like a joyous breeze that whirls  away the thistle-down whether it will or no.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  gave her a short quick look grave enough in its way, but responded with his  usual graceful humor, &ldquo;The thistle-down is too vicious a sprite to be beguiled  away so easily. If I were to give my opinion on the subject, I should say there  was method in its madness. If you have been brought up in the country, as I  suspect from your remark, you must know that the white floating ball is not as  harmless as it would lead you to imagine. It is a meddlesome nobody, that&rsquo;s  what it is, and like some country gossips I know, launches forth from a pure  love of mischief to establish his prickers in his neighbor&rsquo;s field.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>His!</i> I thought it must be feminine at least to fulfill the conditions you mention. A  male gossip, O fie! I shall never have patience with a thistle-ball after this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  laughed he, &ldquo;I did start with the intention of making it feminine, but I caught  a glimpse of your eyes and lost my courage. I did what I could,&rdquo; added he with  a mirthful glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  do the thistles,&rdquo; cried she. Then while both voices joined in a merry laugh,  she continued, &ldquo;But where have we strayed? For a moment it seemed as if we were  on the hills at Grotewell; I could almost see the blue sky.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I,&rdquo; said he, with his eyes on her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure the brooks bubbled.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  distinctly heard a bird singing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was a whippowill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  my name is Clarence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  here both being young and without a care in the world, they laughed again. And  the crowded perfumed room seemed to freshen as with a whiff of mountain air.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  love the country, Miss Fairchild?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;&rdquo;  and her smile was the reflection of the summer-lands that arose before her at  the word. &ldquo;With the right side of my heart do I love the spot where nature  speaks and man is dumb.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  with the left?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  love the place where great men congregate to face their destiny and control it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  latter is the deeper love,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>She  nodded her head and then said, &ldquo;I need both to make me happy. Sometimes as I  walk these city streets, I feel as if my very longing to escape to the heart of  the hills, would carry me there. I remember when I was a child, I was one day  running through a meadow, when suddenly a whole flock of birds flew up from the  grass and surrounded my head. I was not sure but what I should be caught up and  carried away by the force of their flight; and when they rose to mid heaven,  something in my breast seemed to follow them. So it is often with me here, only  that it is the rush of my thoughts that threatens such a Hegira. Yet if I were  to be transported to my native hills, I know I should long to be back again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  mountain lassie has wandered into the courts of the king. The perfume of  palaces is not easily forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  eye turned towards Mr. Sylvester standing near them upright and firm, talking  to a group of attentive gentlemen every one of whom boasted a name of more than  local celebrity. &ldquo;Without a royal heart to govern, there would be no palace;&rdquo;  said she, and blushed under a sudden sense of the possible interpretation he  might give to her words, till the rose in her hand looked pallid.</p>
  <p>But  he had followed her glance and understood her better than she thought. &ldquo;And Mr.  Sylvester has such a heart, so a hundred good fellows have told me. You are  fortunate to see the city from the loop-hole of such a home as his.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is more than a loop-hole,&rdquo; said she.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  that I shall never be satisfied till I see it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  being content with the look he received, he took her on his arm and led her  into the midst of the dancers.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  in a certain corner not far off, two gentlemen were talking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sylvester  shows off well to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  always does. With such a figure as that, a man needs but to enter a room to  make himself felt. But then he&rsquo;s a good talker too. Ever heard him speak?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fine  voice, true snap, right ring. Great favorite at elections. The fact is,  Sylvester is a remarkable man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hum,  ha, so I should judge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so fortunate! He has never been known to run foul in a great operation. Put  your money in his hand and whew!&mdash;your fortune is as good as made.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  other, a rich man, connected heavily with the mining business in Colorado,  smiled with that bland overflow of the whole countenance which is sometimes  seen in large men of great self-importance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a pity he&rsquo;s gone out of Wall Street,&rdquo; continued his companion. &ldquo;The younger fry  feel now something like a flock of sheep that has lost its bell-wether.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  straggle&mdash;eh?&rdquo; returned his portly friend with an increase of his smile that was  not altogether pleasant. &ldquo;So Sylvester has left Wall Street?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  closed his last enterprise two weeks before accepting the Presidency of the  Madison Bank. Stuyvesant is down on speculation, and well&mdash;It looks better you  know; the Madison Bank is an old institution, and Sylvester is ambitious. There&rsquo;ll  be no reckless handling of funds <i>there</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  What was there in that <i>no</i> that made the other look up? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not  acquainted with Sylvester myself. Has he much family?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  wife&mdash;there she is, that handsome woman talking with Ditman,&mdash;and a daughter,  niece or somebody who just now is setting all our young scapegraces by the  ears. You can see her if you just crane your neck a little.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph,  ha, very pretty, very pretty. How much do you suppose Mrs. Sylvester is worth  as she stands, diamonds you know, and all that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  I should say some where near ten thousand; that sprig in her hair cost a clean  five.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So,  so. They live in a handsome house I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  regular palace, corner of Fifth Avenue and &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  his?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s  else I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sports  horses and carriage I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yacht,  opera box?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  reason why he shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is his salary?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  nominal sum, five or ten thousand perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Owns  good share of the bank&rsquo;s stock I presume?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Enough  to control it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Below  par though?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  trifle, going up, however.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And <i>don&rsquo;t</i> speculate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  way this man drawled his words was excessively disagreeable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  that any one knows of. He&rsquo;s made his fortune and now asks only to enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man from the West strutted back and looked at his companion knowingly. &ldquo;What do  you think of my judgment, Stadler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None  better this side of the Pacific.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pretty  good at spying out cracks, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wouldn&rsquo;t like to undertake the puttying up that would deceive you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  Well then, mark this. In two months from to-day you will see Mr. Sylvester rent  his house and go south for his health, or the pretty one over there will marry  one of the scapegraces you mention, who will lend the man <i>who don&rsquo;t engage  in any further ventures</i>, more than one or two hundred thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha,  you know something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  own mines in Colorado and I have my points.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Mr. Sylvester?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  find them too sharp for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  having made his joke, he yielded to the other&rsquo;s apparent restlessness, and they  sauntered off.</p>
  <p>They  did not observe a pale, demure, little lady that sat near them abstractedly  nodding her dainty head to the remarks of a pale-whiskered youth at her side,  nor notice the emotion with which she suddenly rose at their departure and  dismissed her chattering companion on some impromptu errand. It was only one of  the ordinary group of dancers, a pretty, plainly dressed girl, but her name was  Stuyvesant.</p>
  <p>Rising  with a decision that gave a very attractive color to her cheeks, she hastily  looked around. A trio of young gentlemen started towards her but she gave them  no encouragement; her eye had detected Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s tall figure a few feet  off and it was to him she desired to speak. But at her first movement in his  direction, her glance encountered another face, and like a stream that melts  into a rushing torrent, her purpose seemed to vanish, leaving her quivering  with a new emotion of so vivid a character she involuntarily looked about her  for a refuge.</p>
  <p>But  in another instant her eyes had again sought the countenance that had so moved  her, and finding it bent upon her own, faltered a little and unconsciously  allowed the lilies she was carrying to drop from her hand. Before she realized  her loss, the face before her had vanished, and with it something of her  hesitation and alarm.</p>
  <p>With  a hasty action she drew near Mr. Sylvester. &ldquo;Will you lend me your arm for a  minute?&rdquo; she asked, with her usual appealing look rendered doubly forcible by  the experience of a moment before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Stuyvesant! I am happy to see you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Never  had his face looked more cheerful she thought, never had his smile struck her  more pleasantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  little talk with a little girl will not hinder you too much, will it?&rdquo; she  queried, glancing at the group of gentlemen that had shrunk back at her  approach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you call that hindrance which relieves one from listening to quotations of bank  stock at an evening reception?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  shook her head with a confused movement, and led him up before a stand of  flowering exotics.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want to tell you something,&rdquo; she said eagerly but with a marked timidity also,  the tall form beside her looked so imposing for all its encouraging bend. &ldquo;I  beg your pardon if I am doing wrong, but papa regards you with such esteem  and&mdash;Mr. Sylvester do you know a man by the name of Stadler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Astonished  at such a question from lips so young and dainty, he turned and surveyed her  for a moment with quick surprise. Something in her aspect struck him. He  answered at once and without circumlocution. &ldquo;Yes, if you refer to that spry  keen-faced man, just entering the supper-room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know his companion?&rdquo; she proceeded; &ldquo;the portly, highly pompous-looking  gentleman with the gold eye-glasses? Look quickly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;  There was an uneasiness in his tone however that struck her painfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is a stranger in town; has not the honor of your acquaintance he says, but from  the questions he asked, I judge he has a great interest in your affairs. He  spoke of being connected with mines in Colorado. I was sitting behind a curtain  and overheard what was said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester turned pale and regarded her attentively. &ldquo;Might I be so bold,&rdquo; he  inquired after a moment, &ldquo;as to ask you what that was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir, certainly, but it is even harder for me to repeat than it was for me to  hear. He inquired about your domestic concerns, your home and your income,&rdquo; she  murmured blushing; &ldquo;and then said, in what I thought was a somewhat exulting  tone, that in two months or so we should see you go South for your health or&mdash;Is  not that enough for me to tell you, Mr. Sylvester?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  gave her a short stare, opened his lips as if to speak, then turned abruptly  aside and began picking mechanically at the blossoms before him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I,  of course, do not know what men mean when they talk of possessing points. But  the leer and side glance which accompanies such talk, have a universal language  we all understand, and I felt that I must warn you of that man&rsquo;s malice if only  because papa regards you so highly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  shrank as if touched on a sore place, but bowed and answered the wistful appeal  of her glance with a shadow of his usual smile, then he turned, and looking  towards the door through which the two men had disappeared, made a movement as  if he would follow. But remembering himself, escorted her to a seat, saying as  he did so:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are very kind, Miss Stuyvesant; please say nothing of this to Paula.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  bowed and a flitting smile crossed her upturned countenance. &ldquo;I am not much of  a gossip, Mr. Sylvester, or I should have been tempted to have carried my  information to my father instead of to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  understood the implied promise in this remark and gave the hand on his arm a  quick pressure, before relinquishing her to the care of the pale-complexioned  youth who by this time had returned to her side.</p>
  <p>In  another moment Paula came up on the arm of a black-whiskered gentleman all  shirt front and eye-glasses. &ldquo;O Cicely,&rdquo; she cried, (she called Miss  Stuyvesant, Cicely now) &ldquo;is it not a delightful evening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you enjoying yourself so much?&rdquo; inquired that somewhat agitated little lady,  with a glance at the countenance of her friend&rsquo;s attendant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear it would scarcely seem consistent in me now to say no,&rdquo; returned the  radiant girl, with a laughing glance towards the same gentleman.</p>
  <p>But  when they were alone, the gentleman having departed on some of the innumerable  errands with which ladies seem to delight in afflicting their attendant  cavaliers at balls or receptions, she atoned for that glance by remarking,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not find the average partner that falls to one&rsquo;s lot in such receptions all  that fancy paints.&rdquo; And then finding she had repeated a phrase of Mr. Ensign&rsquo;s,  blushed, though no one stood near her but Cicely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fancy&rsquo;s  brush would need to be dipped in but two colors to present to our eye the mass  of them,&rdquo; was Cicely&rsquo;s laughing reply. &ldquo;A streak of black for the coat, and a  daub of white for the shirt front. <i>Voila tout.</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  perhaps a dash of red in some cases,&rdquo; murmured a voice over their shoulders.</p>
  <p>They  turned with hurried blushes. &ldquo;Ah, Mr. Ensign,&rdquo; quoth Cicely in unabashed  gaiety, &ldquo;we reserve red for the exceptions. We did not intend to include our  acknowledged friends in our somewhat sweeping assertion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  I see, the black streak and the white daub are a symbol of, &lsquo;Er&mdash;Miss  Stuyvesant&mdash;very warm this evening! Have an ice, do. <i>I</i> always have an ice  after dancing; so refreshing, you know.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>The  manner in which he imitated the usual languid drawl of certain of the young  scapegraces heretofore mentioned, was irresistible. Paula forgot her confusion  in her mirth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are blessed with a capacity for playing both r&ocirc;les, I perceive,&rdquo; cried Cicely  with unusual abandon. &ldquo;Well, it is convenient, there is nothing like scope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless  it is hope,&rdquo; whispered Mr. Ensign so low that only Paula could hear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I warn you,&rdquo; continued Cicely, with a sweet soft laugh that seemed to carry her  heart far out into the passing throng, &ldquo;that we have no fondness for the model  beau of the period. A dish of milk makes a very good supper but it looks  decidedly pale on the dinner table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Paula, eying the various young men that filed up and down before them,  some pale, some dark, some handsome, some plain, but all smiling and dapper, if  not debonair, &ldquo;some men could be endured if only they were not <i>men</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Ensign gave her a quick look, and while he laughed at the paradox, straightened  himself like one who could be a man if the occasion called. She saw the action  and blushed.</p>
  <p>But  their conversation was soon interrupted. Mr. Sylvester was seen returning from  the supper-room, looking decidedly anxious, and while Paula was ignorant of  what had transpired to annoy him, her ready spirit caught the alarm, and she was  about to rush up to him and address him, when one of the waiters approached,  and murmuring a few words she did not hear, handed him a card upon which she  descried nothing but a simple circle. Instantly a change crossed his already  agitated countenance, and advancing to the ladies with a word or two that while  seemingly cheerful, struck Paula as somewhat forced, excused himself with the  information that a business friend had been so inconsiderate as to importune  him for an interview in the hall. And with just a nod towards Mr. Ensign, who  had drawn back at his advance, left them and disappeared in the crowd about the  door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not like these interruptions from business friends in a time of pleasure,&rdquo;  cried Paula, looking after him with anxious eyes. &ldquo;Did you notice how agitated  he seemed, Cicely? And half an hour ago he was the picture of calm enjoyment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Business  is beyond our comprehension, Paula,&rdquo; returned her friend evasively. &ldquo;It is  something like a neuralgic twinge, it takes a man when he least expects it.  Have you told Mr. Ensign of our adventure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  but I informed Mr. Sylvester, and he said such good, true words to me, Cicely.  I can never forget them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I told papa; but he only frowned and made some observation about the degeneracy  of the times, and the number of scamps thrown to the top by the modern methods  of acquiring instantaneous fortunes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  papa is sometimes hard, is he not, Cicely?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a flush Miss Stuyvesant allowed her eye to rest for a moment on the crowd  shifting before her. &ldquo;He was dug from a quarry of granite, Paula. He is both  hard and substantial; capable of being hewn but not of being moulded. Of such  stuff are formed monuments of enduring beauty and solidity. You must do papa  justice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do, but I sometimes have a feeling as if the granite column would fall and  crush me, Cicely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You,  Paula?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before  she could again reply, Mr. Sylvester returned. His face was still pale, but it  had acquired an expression of rigidity even more alarming to Paula than its  previous aspect of forced merriment. Lifting her by the hand, he drew her  apart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall have to leave you somewhat abruptly,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;An important matter  demands my instant attention. Bertram is somewhere here, and will see that you  and Ona arrive home in safety. You won&rsquo;t allow your enjoyment to be clouded by  my hasty departure, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  if it will make you anxious. But I would rather go home with you now. I am sure  Cousin Ona would be willing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I am not going home at present,&rdquo; said he; and she ventured upon no further  remonstrance.</p>
  <p>But  her enjoyment was clouded; the sight of suffering or anxiety on that face was  more than she could bear; and ere long she said good-night to Cicely, and  accepting the arm of Mr. Ensign, who was never very far from her side,  proceeded to search for her cousin.</p>
  <p>She  found her standing in the midst of an admiring throng to whom her diamonds, if  not her smiles, were an object of undoubted interest. She was in the full tide  of one of her longest and most widely rambling speeches, and to Paula, with  that stir of anxiety at her breast, was an image of self-satisfied complacency  from which she was fain to drop her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Sylvester shares the honors with her husband,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Ensign as they drew  near.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  not the trials, or the pain, or the care?&rdquo; was Paula&rsquo;s inward comment.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Sylvester was not easily wooed away from a circle in which she found herself  creating such an impression, but at length she yielded to Paula&rsquo;s  importunities, and consented to accept young Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s attendance to  their home. The next thing was to find Bertram. Mr. Ensign engaged to do this.  Leaving Paula with her cousin, who may or may not have been pleased at this  sudden addition to her circle, he sought for the young man who as Mr.  Mandeville was not unknown to any of the fashionable men and women of the day.  It was no easy task, nor did he find him readily, but at last he came upon him  leaning out of a window and gazing at a white lily which he held in his hand.  Without preamble, Mr. Ensign made known his errand, and Bertram at once  prepared to accompany him back to the ladies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  Jove! I didn&rsquo;t know the fellow was so handsome!&rdquo; thought the former, and  frowned he hardly knew why. Bertram was not handsome, but then Clarence Ensign  was plain, which Bertram certainly was not.</p>
  <p>It  was to Mr. Ensign&rsquo;s face however that Paula&rsquo;s eyes turned as the two came up,  and he with the ready vivacity of his natural temperament observed it, and took  courage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall soon wish to measure that loop-hole of which I have spoken,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>And  the soft look in her large dark eye as she responded, &ldquo;It is always open to  friends,&rdquo; filled up the measure of his cup of happiness; a cup which unlike  hers, had not been darkened that day by the falling of earth&rsquo;s most dismal shadows.</p>

    In The Night Watches</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Shall  I not take mine ease in mine inn?&rdquo;&mdash;Hen. iv.</p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;What  doth gravity out of his bed at midnight?&rdquo;&mdash;Hen. iv.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  has been the most delightful evening I have ever passed,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sylvester,  as she threw aside her rich white mantle in her ample boudoir. &ldquo;Sarah, two  loops on that dolman to-morrow; do you hear? I thought my arms would freeze.  Such an elegant gentleman as the Count de Frassac is! He absolutely went wild  over you, Paula, but not understanding a word of English&mdash;O there, if that  horrid little wretch didn&rsquo;t drop his spoon on my dress after all! He swore it  never touched a thread of it, but just look at that spot, right in the middle  of a pleating too. Paula, your opinion in regard to the lavendar was correct. I  heard Mrs. Forsyth Jones whisper behind my back that lavendar always made  blondes look <i>fade</i>. Of course I needed no further evidence to convince me  that I had entirely succeeded in eclipsing her pale-faced daughter. Her  daughter!&rdquo; and the lazy gurgle echoed softly through the room, &ldquo;As if every  white-haired girl in the city considered herself entitled to be called a  blonde!&rdquo; She stopped to listen, examining herself in the glass near by. &ldquo;I  thought I heard Edward. It was very provoking in him to leave us in the  cavalier manner in which he did. I was just going to introduce him to the  count, not that he would have esteemed it much of an honor, Edward I mean, but  when one has a good-looking husband&mdash;Sarah, that curtain over there hangs  crooked, pull it straight this instant. Did you try the oysters, Paula? They  were perfection, I shall have to dismiss Lorenzo without ceremony and procure  me a cook that can make an oyster fricassee. By the way did you notice&mdash;&rdquo; and so  on and on for five minutes additional. Presently she burst forth with&mdash;&ldquo;I do  believe I know what it is to be thoroughly satisfied at last. The consideration  which one receives as the wife of the president of the Madison bank is  certainly very gratifying. If I had known I would feel such a change in the  social atmosphere, I would have advocated Edward&rsquo;s dropping speculation long  ago. Beauty and wealth may help one up the social ladder, but only a settled  position such as he has now obtained, can carry you safely over the top. I feel  at last as if we had reached the pinnacle of my ambition and had seen the  ladder by which we mounted thrown down behind us. If I get my costume from  Worth in time, I shall give a German next month.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paula  from her stand at the door&mdash;for some minutes she had been endeavoring to escape  to her room&mdash;surveyed her cousin in wonder. She had never seen her look as she  did at that moment. Any one who speaks from the heart, acquires a certain  eloquence, and Ona for once was speaking from her heart. The unwonted emotion  made her cheeks burn, and even her diamonds, ten thousand dollars worth as we  have heard declared, were less brilliant than her eyes. Paula left her station  on the door-sill and glided rapidly back to her side. &ldquo;O Ona,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if  you would only look like that when&mdash;&rdquo; she paused, what right had she to venture  upon giving lessons to her benefactor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  what?&rdquo; inquired the other, subsiding at once into her naturally languid manner.  Then with a total forgetfulness of the momentary curiosity that had prompted  the question, held out her head to the attendant Sarah, with a command to be  relieved of her ornaments. Paula sighed and hastened to her room. She could not  bring herself to mention her anxiety in regard to the still absent master of  the house, to this lazily-smiling thoroughly satisfied woman.</p>
  <p>But  none the less did she herself sit up in the moonlight, listening with bended  head for the sound of his step on the walk beneath. She could not sleep while  he was absent; and yet the thoughts that disturbed her and kept her from her  virgin pillow could not have been entirely for him, or why those wandering  smiles that ever and anon passed flitting over her cheek, awakening the dimples  that slumbered there, until she looked more like a dreamy picture of delight  than a wakeful vision of apprehension. Not entirely for him&mdash;yet when somewhere  towards three o&rsquo;clock, she heard the long delayed step upon the stoop, she  started up with eager eyes and a nervous gesture that sufficiently betrayed how  intense was her interest in her benefactor&rsquo;s welfare and happiness. &ldquo;If he goes  to Ona&rsquo;s room it is all right,&rdquo; thought she; &ldquo;but if he keeps on upstairs, I  shall know that something is wrong and that he needs a comforter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  did not stop at Ona&rsquo;s room; and struck with alarm, Paula opened wide her door  and was about to step out to meet him, when she caught a sight of his face, and  started back. Here was no anxiety, that she could palliate! The very fact that  he did not observe her slight form standing before him in the brilliant  moonlight, proved that a woman&rsquo;s look or touch was not what he was in search  of; and shrinking sensitively to one side, she sat down on the edge of her  dainty bed, dropping her cheek into her hand with a weary troubled gesture from  which all the delight had fled and only the apprehension remained. Suddenly she  started alertly up; he was coming down again, this time with a gliding muffled  tread. Sliding past her door, he descended to the floor below. She could hear  the one weak stair in the heavy staircase creak, and&mdash;What! he has passed Ona&rsquo;s  room, passed the bronze figure of Luxury on the platform beneath, is on his way  to the front door, has opened it, shut it softly behind him and gone out again  into the blank midnight streets. What did it mean? For a moment she thought she  would run down and awaken Ona, but an involuntary remembrance of how those lazy  eyes would open, stare peevishly and then shut again, stopped her on the  threshold of her door; and sitting down again upon the side of her bed, she  waited, this time with opened eyes eagerly staring before her, and quivering  form that started at each and every sound that disturbed the silence of the  great echoing house. At six o&rsquo;clock she again rose; he had just re-entered and  this time he stopped at Ona&rsquo;s room.</p>

    A Day At The Bank</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  a divinity that shapes our ends, <br>
  Rough-hew them how we will.&rdquo;&mdash;Hamlet. </p>
  <p>There  are days when the whole world seems to smile upon one without stint or  reservation. Bertram Sylvester wending his way to the bank on the morning  following the reception, was a cheerful sight to behold. Youth, health, hope  spake in every lineament of his face and brightened every glance of his  wide-awake eye. His new life was pleasant to him. Bach, Beethoven and Chopin  were scarcely regretted now by the ambitious assistant cashier of the Madison  Bank, with a friend in each of its directors and a something more than that in  the popular president himself. Besides he had developed a talent for the  business and was in the confidence of the cashier, a somewhat sickly man who  more than once had found himself compelled to rely upon the rapidly maturing  judgment of his young associate, in matters oftentimes of the utmost  importance. The manner in which Bertram found himself able to respond to these  various calls, convinced him that he had been correct in his opinion of his own  nature, when he informed his uncle that music was his pleasure rather than his  necessity.</p>
  <p>Entering  the building by way of Pearl Street, he was about to open the door leading into  the bank proper, when he heard a little piping voice at his side, and turning,  confronted the janitor&rsquo;s baby daughter. She was a sweet and interesting child,  and with his usual good nature Bertram at once stopped to give her a kiss.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  likes you,&rdquo; prattled she as he put her down again after lifting her up high  over his head, &ldquo;but I likes de oder one best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope the other one duly appreciates your preference,&rdquo; laughed he, and was again  on the point of entering the bank when he felt or thought he felt a hand laid  on his arm. It was the janitor himself this time, a worthy man, greatly trusted  in the bank, but possessed of such an extraordinary peculiarity in the way of a  pair of protruding eyes, that his appearance was always attended by a shock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Hopgood, what is it?&rdquo; cried Bertram, in his cheery tone.</p>
  <p>The  janitor drew back and mercifully shifted his gaze from the young man&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Nothing  sir; did I stop you? Beg pardon,&rdquo; he continued, half stammering, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dreadful  awkward sometimes.&rdquo; And with a nod he sidled off towards his little one whom he  confusedly took up in his arms.</p>
  <p>Now  Bertram was sure the man had touched him and that, too, with a very eager hand,  but being late that morning and consequently in somewhat of a hurry, he did not  stop to pursue the matter. Hastening into the Bank, he assisted the teller in  opening the safe, that being his especial duty, and was taking out such papers  as he himself required, when he was surprised to catch another sight of those  same extraordinary organs of which I have just spoken, peering upon him from  the door by which he had previously entered. They vanished as soon as he  encountered them, but more than once during the morning he perceived them  looking upon him from various quarters of the bank, till he felt himself  growing seriously annoyed, and sending for the man, asked him what he meant by  this unusual surveillance. The janitor seemed troubled, flushed painfully and  fixed his eyes in manifest anxiety on the cashier who, engaged in some search  of his own, was just handling over the tin boxes that lined the vault before  them. Not till he had seen him shove them back into their place and leave the  spot, did he venture upon his reply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, sir, I&rsquo;m very sorry if I have  annoyed you, but do you think Mr. Sylvester will be down at the usual hour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know of no reason why he should not,&rdquo; returned Bertram.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have something to say to him when he comes in,&rdquo; stammered the man, evidently  taken aback by Bertram&rsquo;s look of surprise. &ldquo;Will you be kind enough to ring the  bell the first moment he seems to be at leisure? I don&rsquo;t know as it is a matter  of any importance but&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped, evidently putting a curb upon himself. &ldquo;Can  I rely on you, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  certainly, I will tell my uncle when he comes in that you want to speak to him.  He will doubtless send for you at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man looked embarrassed. &ldquo;Excuse me, sir, but that&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;d rather you  wouldn&rsquo;t do. Mr. Sylvester is always very busy and he might think I wished to  annoy him about some matters of my own, sir, as indeed I have not been above  doing at odd times. If you would ring when he comes in, that is all I ask.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bertram  thought this a strange request, but seeing the man so anxious, gave the  required promise, and the janitor hurried off. &ldquo;Curious!&rdquo; muttered Bertram. &ldquo;Can  anything be wrong?&rdquo; And he glanced about him with some curiosity as he went to  his desk. But every one was at his post as usual and the countenances of all  were equally undisturbed.</p>
  <p>It  was a busy morning and in the rush of various matters Bertram forgot the entire  occurrence. But it was presently recalled to him by hearing some one remark, &ldquo;Mr.  Sylvester is late to-day,&rdquo; and looking up from some papers he was considering,  he found it was a full hour after the time at which his uncle was in the habit  of appearing. Just then he caught still another sight of the protruding eyes of  Hopgood staring in upon him from the half-opened door at the end of the bank.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  fellow&rsquo;s getting impatient,&rdquo; thought he, and experienced a vague feeling of  uneasiness.</p>
  <p>Another  half hour passed. &ldquo;What can have detained Mr. Sylvester?&rdquo; cried Mr. Wheelock  the cashier, hastily approaching Bertram.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is to be an important meeting of the Directors to-day, and some of the  gentlemen are already coming in. Mr. Sylvester is not accustomed to keep us  waiting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, I am sure,&rdquo; returned Bertram, remembering with an accession of  uneasiness, the abruptness with which his uncle had left the entertainment the  evening before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  I telegraph to the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  that is not necessary. Besides Folger says he passed him on Broadway this  morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Going  down street with a valise in his hand,&rdquo; that gentlemen quietly put in. Folger  was the teller. &ldquo;He was looking very pale and didn&rsquo;t see me when I nodded.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  time was that?&rdquo; asked Bertram.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  twelve; when I went out to lunch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  quick gasp sounded at their side, followed by a hurried cough. Turning, Bertram  encountered for the fifth time the eyes of Hopgood. He had entered unperceived  by the small door that separated the inner inclosure from the outer, and was  now standing very close to them, eying with side-long looks the safe at their  back, the faces of the gentleman speaking, yes, and even the countenances of  the clerks, as they bent busily over their books.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you ring, sir?&rdquo; asked he, catching Bertram&rsquo;s look of displeasure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man seemed to feel the rebuke implied in this short response, and ambled softly  away. But in another moment he was stopped by Bertram.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the matter with you to-day, Hopgood? Can you have anything of real  importance on your mind; anything connected with my uncle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  janitor started, and looked almost frightened. &ldquo;Be careful what you say,&rdquo;  whispered he; then with a keen look at Mr. Wheelock just then on the point of  entering the directors&rsquo; room, he was turning to escape by the little door just  mentioned, when it opened and Mr. Stuyvesant came in. With a look almost of  terror the janitor recoiled, throwing himself as it were between the latter and  the door of the safe; but recovering himself, surveyed the keen quiet visage of  the veteran banker with a rolling of his great eyes absolutely painful to  behold. Mr. Stuyvesant, who was somewhat absorbed in thought, did not appear to  notice the agitation he had caused, and with just a hurried nod followed Mr.  Wheelock into the Directors&rsquo; room. Instantly the janitor drew himself up with  an air of relief, and shortly glancing at the clock which lacked a few minutes  yet of the time fixed for the meeting, slided hastily away from Bertram&rsquo;s  detaining hand, and disappeared in the crowd without. In another moment Bertram  saw him standing at the outer door, looking anxiously up and down the street.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something <i>is</i> wrong,&rdquo; murmured Bertram. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; And for a moment he felt half  tempted to return Mr. Stuyvesant&rsquo;s friendly bow with a few words expressive of  his uneasiness, but the emphasis with which Hopgood had murmured the words, &ldquo;Be  careful what you say,&rdquo; unconsciously deterred him, and concealing his  nervousness as best he might, he entered the Directors&rsquo; office.</p>
  <p>It  was now time for the meeting to open, and the gentlemen were all seated around  the low green baize table that occupied the centre of the room. Impatience was  written on all their countenances. Mr. Stuyvesant especially was looking at the  heavy gold watch in his hand, with a frown on his deeply wrinkled brow that did  not add to its expression of benevolence. The empty seat at the head of the  table stared upon Bertram uncompromisingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  wife gives a reception to-day,&rdquo; ventured one gentleman to his neighbor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I have an engagement at five that won&rsquo;t bear postponement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sylvester  has always been on hand before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  can&rsquo;t proceed without him,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Wheelock looked thoughtful.</p>
  <p>With  a nod of his head towards such gentlemen as met his eye, Bertram hastened to a  little cupboard devoted to the use of himself and uncle. Opening it, he looked  within, took down a coat he saw hanging before him, and unconsciously uttered  an exclamation. It was a dress-coat such as had been worn by Mr. Sylvester the  evening before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does this mean! My uncle has been here!&rdquo; were the words that sprang to his  lips; but he subdued his impulse to speak, and hastily hanging up the coat,  relocked the door. Proceeding at once to the outer room, he asked two or three  of the clerks if they were sure Mr. Sylvester had not been in during the day.  But they all returned an unequivocal &ldquo;no,&rdquo; and that too with a certain stare of  surprise that at once convinced him he was betraying his agitation too plainly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will telegraph whether Wheelock considers it necessary or not,&rdquo; thought he, and  was moving to summon a messenger boy when he caught sight of Hopgood slowly  making his way in from the street. He was very pale and walked with his eyes  fixed on the ground, ominously shaking his great head in a way that bespoke an  inner struggle of no ordinary nature. Bertram at once sauntered out to meet  him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hopgood,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;your evident anxiety is infectious. What has happened to make my  uncle&rsquo;s detention a matter of such apparent import? If you do not wish to  confide in me, his nephew almost his son, speak to Mr. Wheelock or to one of  the directors, but don&rsquo;t keep anything to yourself which concerns his welfare  or&mdash;What are you looking at?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man was gazing as if fascinated at the keys in Bertram&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  sir, nothing. You must not detain me; I have nothing to say. I will wait ten  minutes,&rdquo; he muttered to himself, glancing again at the clock. Suddenly he saw  the various directors come filing out of the inner room, and darted for the  second time from Bertram&rsquo;s detaining hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope nothing has happened to Mr. Sylvester,&rdquo; exclaimed one gentleman to another  as they filed by.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he were given to a loose ends&rsquo; sort of business it would be another thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  looked exceedingly well at the reception last night,&rdquo; exclaimed another; &ldquo;but  in these days&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Suddenly  there was a hush. A telegraph boy had just entered the door and was asking for  Mr. Bertram Sylvester.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  I am,&rdquo; said Bertram, hastily taking the envelope presented him. Slightly  turning his back, he opened it. Instantly his face grew white as chalk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;you will have to excuse my uncle to-day; a great misfortune has  occurred to him.&rdquo; Then with a slow and horror-stricken movement, he looked  about him and exclaimed, &ldquo;<i>Mrs. Sylvester is dead</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  confused murmur at once arose, followed by a hurried rush; but of all the faces  that flocked out of the bank, none wore such a look of blank and helpless  astonishment as that of Hopgood the janitor, as with bulging eyes and nervously  working hands, he slowly wended his way to the foot of the stairs and there sat  down gazing into vacancy.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_20"></a>Chapter 20<br>
    The Dregs In The Cup</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;O  eloquent, just and mightie death! whom none could advise, thou hast persuaded;  what none hath dared, thou hast done; and whom all the world hath flattered,  thou only hast cast out of the world and despised: thou hast drawn together all  the farre stretched greatnesses; all the pride, crueltie and ambition of man  and covered it all over with these two narrow words, <i>Hic jacet</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;Sir  Walter Raleigh.</p>
  <p>Bertram&rsquo;s  hurried ring at his uncle&rsquo;s door was answered by Samuel the butler.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is this I hear?&rdquo; cried the young man, entering with considerable agitation, &ldquo;Mrs.  Sylvester dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  sir,&rdquo; returned the old and trusty servant, with something like a sob in his  voice. &ldquo;She went out riding this morning behind a pair of borrowed horses&mdash;and  being unused to Michael&rsquo;s way of driving, they ran away and she was thrown from  the carriage and instantly killed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Miss Fairchild?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  didn&rsquo;t go with her. Mrs. Sylvester was alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Horrible,  horrible! Where is my uncle, can I see him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; the man returned with a strange look of anxiety. &ldquo;Mr.  Sylvester is feeling very bad, sir. He has shut himself up in his room and none  of his servants dare disturb him, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should, however, like him to know I am here. In what room shall I find him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the little one, sir, at the top of the house. It has a curious lock on the  door; you will know it by that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well. Please be in the hall when I come down; I may want to give you some  orders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  old servant bowed and Bertram hastened with hushed steps to ascend the stairs.  At the first platform he paused. What is there in a house of death, of sudden  death especially, that draws a veil of spectral unreality over each familiar  object! Behind that door now inexorably closed before him, lay without doubt  the shrouded form of her who but a few short hours before, had dazzled the eyes  of men and made envious the hearts of women with her imposing beauty! No such  quiet then reigned over the spot filled by her presence. As the vision of a  dream returns, he saw her again in all her splendor. Never a brow in all the  great hall shone more brightly beneath its sparkling diamonds; never a lip in  the whole vast throng curled with more self-complacent pride, or melted into a  more alluring smile, than that of her who now lay here, a marble image beneath  the eye of day. It was as if a flowery field had split beneath the dancing foot  of some laughing siren. One moment your gaze is upon the swaying voluptuous  form, the half-shut beguiling eye, the white out-reaching arms upon whose satin  surface a thousand loves seem perching; the next you stare horror-stricken upon  the closing jaws of an awful pit, with the flash of something bright in your  eyes, and the sense of a hideous noiseless rush in which earth and heaven  appear to join, sink and be swallowed! Bertram felt his heart grow sick. Moving  on, he passed the bronze image of Luxury lying half asleep on its bed of  crumpled roses. Hideous mockery! What has luxury to do with death? She who was  luxury itself has vanished from these halls. Shall the mute bronze go on  smiling over its wine cup while she who was its prototype is carried by without  a smile on the lips once so vermeil with pride and tropical languors!</p>
  <p>Arrived  at the top of the house, Bertram knocked at the door with the strange lock, and  uttering his own name, asked if there was anything he could do here or  elsewhere to show his sympathy and desire to be of use in this great and sudden  bereavement. There was no immediate reply and he began to fear he would be  obliged to retire without seeing his uncle, when the door was slowly opened and  Mr. Sylvester came out. Instantly Bertram understood the anxiety of the  servant. Not only did Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s countenance exhibit the usual traces of  grief and horror incident to a sudden and awful calamity, but there were  visible upon it the tokens of another and still more unfathomable emotion, a  wild and paralyzed look that altered the very contour of his features, and made  his face almost like that of a stranger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle,  what is it?&rdquo; sprang involuntarily to his lips. But Mr. Sylvester betraying by a  sudden backward movement an instinctive desire to escape scrutiny, he bethought  himself, and with hasty utterance offered some words of consolation that  sounded strangely hollow and superficial in that dim and silent corridor. &ldquo;Is  there nothing I can do for you?&rdquo; he finally asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything  is being done,&rdquo; exclaimed his uncle in a strained and altered voice; &ldquo;Robert is  here.&rdquo; And a silence fell over the hall, that Bertram dared not break.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have help for everything but&mdash;&rdquo; He did not say what, it seemed as if something  rose up in his throat that choked him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertram,&rdquo;  said he at last in a more natural tone, &ldquo;come with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  led him into an adjoining room and shut the door. It was a room from which the  sunshine had not been excluded and it seemed as if they could both breathe more  easily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit  down,&rdquo; said his uncle, pointing to a chair. The young man did so, but Mr.  Sylvester remained standing. Then without preamble, &ldquo;Have you seen her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was no grief in the question, only a quiet respect. Death clothes the most  volatile with a garment of awe. Bertram slowly shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I  came at once up stairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no mark on her white body, save the least little discolored dent here,&rdquo;  continued his uncle, pointing calmly to his temple. &ldquo;She had one moment of fear  while the horses ran, and then&mdash;&rdquo; He gave a quick shudder and advancing towards  Bertram, laid his hand on his nephew&rsquo;s shoulder in such a way as to prevent him  from turning his head. &ldquo;Bertram,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have no son. If I were to call  upon you to perform a son&rsquo;s work for me; to obey and ask no questions, would  you comply?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you ask?&rdquo; sprang from the young man&rsquo;s lips; &ldquo;you know that you have only to  command for me to be proud to obey. Anything you can require will find me  ready.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  hand on his shoulder weighed heavier. &ldquo;It seems a strange time to talk about  business, Bertram, but necessity knows no law. There is a matter in which you  can afford me great assistance if you will undertake to do immediately what I  ask.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you doubt&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,  it is this. On this paper you will find a name; below it a number of addresses.  They are all of places down town and some of them not very reputable I fear.  What I desire is for you to seek out the man whose name you here see, going to  these very places after him, beginning with the first, and continuing down the  list until you find him. When you come upon him, he will ask you for a card.  Give him one on which you will scrawl before his eyes, a circle, so. It is a  token which he should instantly understand. If he does, address him with  freedom and tell him that your employer&mdash;you need make use of no  names&mdash;re-demands the papers made over to him this morning. If he manifests  surprise or is seen to hesitate, tell him your orders are imperative. If he  declares ruin will follow, inform him that you are not to be frightened by  words; that your employer is as fully aware of the position of affairs as he.  Whatever he says, bring the papers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bertram  nodded his head and endeavored to rise, but his uncle&rsquo;s hand rested upon him  too heavily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is a small man; you need have no dread of him physically. The sooner you find  him and acquit yourself of your task, the better I shall be pleased.&rdquo; And then  the hand lifted.</p>
  <p>On  his way down stairs Bertram encountered Paula. She was standing in the hall and  accosted him with a very trembling tone in her voice. All her questions were in  regard to Mr. Sylvester.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you seen him?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Does he speak&mdash;say anything? No one has heard him  utter a word since he came in from down town and saw her lying there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  certainly; he spoke to me; he has been giving me some commissions to perform. I  am on my way now to attend to them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  drew a deep breath. &ldquo;O!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;would that he had a son, a daughter, a  child, some one!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  exclamation following what had taken place above struck Bertram forcibly. &ldquo;He  has a son in me, Paula. Love as well as duty binds me to him. All that a child  could do will I perform with pleasure. You can trust me for that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  threw him a glance of searching inquiry. &ldquo;His need is greater than it seems,&rdquo;  whispered she. &ldquo;He was deeply troubled before this terrible accident occurred.  I am afraid the arrow is poisoned that has made this dreadful wound. I cannot  explain myself,&rdquo; she went on hurriedly, &ldquo;but if you indeed regard him as a  father, be ready with any comfort, any help, that affection can bestow, or his  necessities require. Let me feel that he has near him some stay that will not  yield to pressure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was so much passion in this appeal that Bertram involuntarily bowed his head. &ldquo;He  has two friends,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and here is my hand that I will never forsake him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not need to offer mine,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;He is great and good enough to do  without my assistance.&rdquo; But nevertheless she gave her hand to Bertram and with  a glow of her lip and eye that made her beauty, supreme at all times, something  almost supernatural in its character.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  dared not tell him,&rdquo; she whispered to herself as the front door closed with the  dull slow thud proper to a house of mourning. &ldquo;I dare not tell any one, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What  lay beyond that but?</p>
  <p>When  Mr. Sylvester came in at six o&rsquo;clock in the morning, Paula had risen from the  bed on which she had been sitting, but not to make preparation for rest, for  she could not rest. The vague shadow of some surrounding evil or threatened  catastrophe was upon her, and though she forced herself to change her dress for  a warmer and more suitable one, she did not otherwise break her vigil, though  the necessity for it seemed to be at an end. It was a midwinter morning and the  sun had not yet risen, so being chilly as well as restless, she began to pace  the floor, stopping now and then to glance out of the window, in the hopes of  detecting some signs of awakening day in the blank and solemn east. Suddenly as  she was thus consulting the horizon, a light flashed up from below, and looking  down upon the face of the extension that ran along at right angles to her  window, she perceived that the shades were up in Mrs. Sylvester&rsquo;s boudoir. They  had doubtless been left so the evening before, and Mr. Sylvester upon turning  up the gas had failed to observe the fact. Instantly she felt her heart stand  still, for the house being wide and the extension narrow, all that went on in  that boudoir, or at least in that portion of it which Mr. Sylvester at present  occupied, was easily observable from the window at which she stood; and that  something was going on of a serious and important nature, was sufficiently  evident from the expression of Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s countenance. He was standing  with his face bent towards some one seated out of sight, his wife undoubtedly,  though what could have called her from her dreams&mdash;and was busily engaged in  talking. The subject whatever it was, absorbed him completely. If Paula had  allowed herself the thought, she would have described him as pleading and that  with no ordinary vehemence. But suddenly while she gazed half fascinated and  but little realizing what she was doing, he started back and a fierce change  swept over his face, a certain incredulity, that presently gave way to a glance  of horror and repugnance, which the quick action of his out-thrown palm  sufficiently emphasized. He was pushing something from him, but what? A  suggestion or a remembrance? It was impossible to determine.</p>
  <p>The  countenance of Mrs. Sylvester who that moment appeared in sight sailing across  the floor in her azure wrapper, offered but little assistance in the way of  explanation. Immovable under most circumstances, it was simply at this juncture  a trifle more calm and cold than usual, presenting to Paula&rsquo;s mind the thought  of a white and icy barrier, against which the most glowing of arrows must fall  chilled and powerless.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O  for a woman&rsquo;s soul to inform that breast if but for a moment!&rdquo; cried Paula,  lost in the passion of this scene, while so little understanding its import.  When as if in mockery to this invocation, the haughty form upon which she was  gazing started rigidly erect, while the lip acquired a scorn and the eye a  menace that betrayed the serpent ever in hiding under this white rose.</p>
  <p>Paula  could look no longer. This last revelation had awakened her to the fact that  she was gazing upon a scene sacred to the husband and wife engaged in it. With  a sense of shame she rushed to the bed and threw herself upon it, but the  vision of what she had beheld would not leave her so easily. Like letters of  fire upon a black ground, the panorama of looks and gestures to which she had  just been witness, floated before her mind&rsquo;s eye, awakening a train of thought  so intense that she did not know which was worse, to be there in the awful dawn  dreaming over this episode of the night, or to rise and face again the reality.  The fascination which all forbidden sights insensibly exert over the minds of  the best of us, finally prevailed, and she slowly crept to the window to catch  a parting glimpse of Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s tall form hurrying blindly from the  boudoir followed by his wife&rsquo;s cold glance. The next minute the exposed  condition of the room seemed to catch that lady&rsquo;s attention, and with an  anxious look into the dull gray morn, Mrs. Sylvester drew down the shades, and  the episode was over.</p>
  <p>Or  so Paula thought; but when she was returning up stairs after her solitary  breakfast&mdash;Mrs. Sylvester was too tired and Mr. Sylvester too much engaged to  eat, as the attentive Samuel informed her&mdash;the door of Ona&rsquo;s room swung ajar,  and she distinctly heard her give utterance to the following exclamation:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  give up this elegant home, my horses and carriage, the friends I have had such  difficulty in obtaining, and the position which I was born to adorn? I had  rather die!&rdquo; And Paula feeling as if she had received the key to the enigma of  the last night&rsquo;s unaccountable manifestations, was about to rush away to her  own apartment, when the door swayed open again and she heard his voice respond  with hard and bitter emphasis,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  it might be better that you should. But since you will probably live, let it be  according to your mind. I have not the courage&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  the door swung to.</p>
  <p>An  hour from that Mr. Sylvester left the house with a small valise in his hand,  and Mrs. Sylvester dressed in her showiest costume, entered her carriage for an  early shopping excursion.</p>
  <p>And  so when Paula whispered to herself, &ldquo;I did not dare to tell him; I did not dare  to tell any one, but&mdash;&rdquo; she thought of those terrible words, &ldquo;Die? It might be  better, perhaps, that you should!&rdquo; and then remembered the ghastly look of  immeasurable horror with which a few hours later, he staggered away from that  awful burden, whose rigid lines would never again melt into mocking curves, and  to whom the morning&rsquo;s wide soaring hopes, high reaching ambitions and boundless  luxuries were now no more than the shadows of a vanished world; life, love,  longing, with all their demands, having dwindled to a noisome rest between four  close planks, with darkness for its present portion and beyond&mdash;what?</p>

    Departure</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Forever  and forever, farewell Cassius. <br>
  If we do meet again, why we shall smile; <br>
  If not,  why then, this parting was well made.&rdquo;&mdash;Julius C&aelig;sar. </p>
  <p>Samuel  had received his orders to admit Mr. Bertram Sylvester to his uncle&rsquo;s room, at  whatever hour of the day or night he chose to make his appearance. But evening  wore away and finally the night, before his well-known face was seen at the  door. Proceeding at once to the apartment occupied by Mr. Sylvester, he  anxiously knocked. The door was opened immediately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  Bertram, I have been expecting you all night.&rdquo; And from the haggard appearance  of both men, it was evident that neither of them had slept.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have sat down but twice since I left you, and then only in conveyances. I have  been obliged to go to Brooklyn, to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you have found him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I found him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  uncle glanced inquiringly at his hands; they were empty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall have to sit down,&rdquo; said Bertram; his brow was very gloomy, his words came  hesitatingly. &ldquo;I had rather have knocked my head against the wall, than have  disappointed you,&rdquo; he murmured after a moment&rsquo;s pause. &ldquo;But when I did find  him, it was too late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too  late!&rdquo; The tone in which this simple phrase was uttered was indescribable.  Bertram slowly nodded his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  had already disposed of all the papers, and favorably,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  not only that,&rdquo; pursued Bertram. &ldquo;He had issued orders by telegraph, that it  was impossible to countermand. It was at the Forty Second Street dep&ocirc;t I found  him at last. He was just on the point of starting for the west.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  has he gone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester walked slowly to the window. It was raining drearily without, but he  did not notice the falling drops or raise his eyes to the leaden skies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you meet any one?&rdquo; he asked at length. &ldquo;Any one that you know, I mean, or who  knows you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one but Mr. Stuyvesant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Stuyvesant!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  sir,&rdquo; returned Bertram, dropping his eyes before his uncle&rsquo;s astonished glance.  &ldquo;I was coming out of a house in Broad Street when he passed by and saw me, or  at least I believed he saw me. There is no mistaking him, sir, for any one  else; besides it is a custom of his I am told, to saunter through the down town  streets after the warehouses are all closed for the night. He enjoys the quiet  I suppose, finds food for reflection in the sleeping aspect of our great city.&rdquo;  There was gloom in Bertram&rsquo;s tone; his uncle looked at him curiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  house was it from which you were coming when he passed you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  building where Tueller and Co. do business, shady operators in paper, as you  know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you believed he recognized you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot be sure, sir. It was dark, but I thought I saw him look at me and give a  slight start.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ah,  how desolate sounds the drip, drip of a ceaseless rain, when conversation  languishes and the ear has time to listen!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will explain to Mr. Stuyvesant when I see him, that you were in search of a man  with whom I had pressing business,&rdquo; observed Mr. Sylvester at last.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  murmured Bertram with effort, &ldquo;it might emphasize the occurrence in his mind;  let the matter drop where it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was another silence, during which the drip of the rain on the window-ledge  struck on the young man&rsquo;s ears like the premonitory thud of falling earth upon  a coffin-lid. At length his uncle turned and advanced rapidly towards him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertram,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;you have done me a favor for which I thank you. What you have learned  in the course of its accomplishment I cannot tell. Enough perhaps to make you understand  why I warned you from the dangerous path of speculation, and set your feet in a  way that if adhered to with steadfast purpose, ought to lead you at last to a  safe and honorable prosperity. Now&mdash;No, Bertram,&rdquo; he bitterly interrupted  himself as the other opened his lips, &ldquo;I am in need of no especial  commiseration, my affairs seem bound to prosper whether I will or not&mdash;now I  have one more commission to give you. Miss Fairchild&mdash;&rdquo; his voice quavered and  he leaned heavily on the chair near which he was standing. &ldquo;Have you seen her,  Bertram? Is the poor child quite prostrated? Has this frightful occurrence made  her ill, or does she bear up with fortitude under the shock of this sudden  calamity?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is not ill, but her suffering is undoubted. If you could see her and say a few  words to relieve her anxiety in regard to yourself, I think it would greatly  comfort her. Her main thought seems to be for you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester frowned, raised his hand with a repelling gesture, and hastily opened  his lips. Bertram thought he was about to utter some passionate phrase. But  instead of that he merely remarked, &ldquo;I am sorry I cannot see her, but it is  quite impossible. You must stand between me and this poor child, Bertram. Tell  her I send her my love; tell her that I am quite well; anything to solace her  and make these dark days less dreary. If she wants a friend with her, let a  messenger be sent for whomever she desires. I place no restrictions upon  anything you choose to do for her comfort or happiness, but let me be spared  the sight of any other face than yours until this is all over. After the  funeral&mdash;it nay sound ungracious, but I am far from feeling so&mdash;I shall wish to  be left alone for awhile. If she can be made to understand this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think her instincts, sir, have already led her to divine your wishes. If I am  not mistaken, she is even now making preparations to return to her relatives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester gave a start. &ldquo;What, so soon!&rdquo; he murmured, and the sadness of his  tone smote Bertram to the heart. But in another moment he recovered himself and  shortly exclaimed, &ldquo;Well! well! that is as it should be. You will watch over  her Bertram, and see that she is kindly cared for. It would be a grief to me to  have her go away with any more than the necessary regret at losing one who was  always kind to <i>her</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will look after her as after a sister,&rdquo; returned Bertram. &ldquo;She shall miss no  attention which I can supply.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a look Mr. Sylvester expressed his thanks. Then while Bertram again attempted  to speak, he gave him a cordial pressure of the hand, and withdrew once more to  his favorite spot.</p>
  <p>And  the rain beat, beat, and it sounded more and more like the droppings of earth  upon a nailed down coffin-lid.</p>
 <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>The  funeral was a large one. The largest some said that had ever been seen in that  quarter of the city. If Mrs. Sylvester&rsquo;s position had not been what it was, the  sudden and awful nature of her death, would have been sufficient to draw  together a large crowd. Among those who thus endeavored to show their respect  was Miss Stuyvesant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  could not join you here in your pleasures,&rdquo; she whispered to Paula in the short  interview they had upstairs, preparatory to the services, &ldquo;but I cannot keep  away in the dark hours!&rdquo; And from her look and the clasp of her hand, Paula  gained fresh courage to endure the slow pressure of anxiety and grief with  which she was secretly burdened.</p>
  <p>Moreover  she had the pleasure of introducing her beloved friend to Mr. Bertram  Sylvester, a pleasure which she had long promised herself whenever the opportunity  should arrive, as Miss Stuyvesant was somewhat of an enthusiast as regards  music. She did not notice particularly then, but she remembered afterwards,  with what a blushing cheek and beautiful glance the dainty young girl received  his bow, and responded to his few respectful words of pleasure at meeting the  daughter of a man whom he had learned to regard with so much respect.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester was in a room by himself. The few glimpses obtained of him by his  friends, convinced them all, that this trouble touched him more deeply than  those who knew his wife intimately could have supposed. Yet he was calm, and  already wore that fixed look of rigidity which was henceforth to distinguish  the expression of his fine and noble features.</p>
  <p>In  the ride to Greenwood he spoke little. Paula who sat in the carriage with him  did not receive a word, though now and then his eye wandered towards her with  an expression that drove the blood to her heart, and made the whole day one  awful memory of incomprehensible agony and dim but terrible forebodings. The  ways of the human soul, in its crises of grief or remorse were so new to her.  She had passed her life beside rippling streams and in peaceful meadows, and  now all at once, with shadow on shadow, the dark pictures of life settled down  before her, and she could not walk without stumbling upon jagged rocks, deep  yawning chasms and caves of impenetrable gloom.</p>
  <p>The  sight of the grave appalled her. To lay in such a bed as that, the fair and  delicate head that had often found the downy pillows of its azure couch too  hard for its languid pressure. To hide in such a dismal, deep, dark gap, a form  so white and but a little while before, so imposing in its splendor and so  commanding in its requirements. The thought of heaven brought no comfort. The  beauty they had known lay here; soulless, inert, rigid and responseless, but  here. It was gifted with no wings with which to rise. It owned no attachment to  higher spheres. Death had scattered the leaves of this white rose, but from all  the boundless mirror of the outspread heavens, no recovered semblance of its  perfected beauty, looked forth to solace Paula or assuage the misery of her  glance into this gloomy pit. Ah, Ona, the social ladder reaches high, but it  does not scale the regions where your poor soul could find comfort now.</p>
  <p>Bertram  saw the white look on Paula&rsquo;s face and silently offered his arm. But there are  moments when no mortal help can aid us; instants when the soul stands as  solitary in the universe, as the ship-wrecked mariner on a narrow strip of rock  in a boundless sea. Life may touch, but eternity enfolds us; we are single  before God and as such must stand or fall.</p>
  <p>Upon  their return to the house, Mr. Sylvester withdrew with a few intimate friends  to his room, and Paula, lonely beyond expression, went to her own empty  apartment to finish packing her trunks and answer such notes as had arrived  during her absence. For attention from outsiders was only too obtrusive. Many  whom she had never met save in the most formal intercourse, flooded her now  with expressions of condolence, which if they had not been all upon one pattern  and that the most conventional, might have afforded her some relief. Two or  three of the notes were precious to her and these she stowed safely away, one  contained a deliberate offer of marriage from a wealthy old stock-broker; this  she as deliberately burned after she had written a proper refusal. &ldquo;He thinks I  have no home,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>And  had she? As she paced through the silent halls and elaborately furnished rooms  on her way to her solitary dinner, she asked herself if any place would ever  seem like home after this. Not that she was infatuated by its elegance. The  lofty walls might dwindle, the gorgeous furniture grow dim, the works of beauty  disappear, the whole towering structure contract to the dimensions of a simple  cottage or what was worse, a seedy down-town house, if only the something would  remain, the something that made return to Grotewell seem like the bending back  of a towering stalk to the ground from which it had taken its root. &ldquo;If?&rdquo; she  cried&mdash;and stopped there, her heart swelling she knew not why. Then again, &ldquo;I  thought I had found a father!&rdquo; Then after a longer pause, a wild  uncontrollable; &ldquo;Bless! bless! bless!&rdquo; which seemed to re-echo in the room long  after her lingering step had left it.</p>
 <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  he let me go without a word?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was early morning and the time had come for Paula&rsquo;s departure. She was standing  on the threshold of her room, her hands clasped, her eyes roving up and down  the empty halls. &ldquo;Will he let me go without a word?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O  Miss Paula, what do you think?&rdquo; cried Sarah, creeping slowly towards her from  the spectral recesses of a dim corner. &ldquo;Jane says Mr. Sylvester was up all last  night too. She heard him go down stairs about midnight and he went through all  the rooms like a gliding spectre and into <i>her</i> room too!&rdquo; she fearfully  whispered; &ldquo;and what he did there no one knows, but when he came out he locked  the door, and this morning the cook heard him give orders to Samuel to have the  trunks that were ready in Mrs. Sylvester&rsquo;s room taken away. O Miss, do you  think he can be going to give all those beautiful things to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paula  recoiled in horror. &ldquo;Sarah!&rdquo; said she, and could say no more. The vision of  that tall form gliding through the desolate house at midnight, bending over the  soulless finery of his dead wife, perhaps stowing it away in boxes, came with  too powerful a suggestion to her mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shure,  I thought you would be pleased,&rdquo; murmured the girl and disappeared again into  one of the dim recesses.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  he let me go without a word?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Paula, Mr. Bertram Sylvester is waiting at the door in a carriage,&rdquo; came in low  respectful tones to her ears, and Samuel&rsquo;s face full of regret appeared at the  top of the stairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am coming,&rdquo; murmured the sad-hearted girl, and with a sob which she could not  control, she took her last look of the pretty pink chamber in which she had  dreamed so many dreams of youthful delight, and perhaps of youthful sorrow  also, and slowly descended the stairs. Suddenly as she was passing a door on  the second floor, she heard a low deep cry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  stopped and her hand went to her heart, the reaction was so sudden. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she  murmured, standing still with great heart-beats of joy, or was it pain?</p>
  <p>The  door slowly opened. &ldquo;Did you think I could let you go without a blessing, my  Paula, my little one!&rdquo; came in those deep heart-tones which always made her  tears start. And Mr. Sylvester stepped out of the shadows beyond and stood in  the shadows at her side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not know,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I am so young, so feeble, such a mote in this  great atmosphere of anguish. I longed to see you, to say good-bye, to thank  you, but&mdash;&rdquo; tears stopped her words; this was a parting that rent her leader  heart.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester watched her and his deep chest rose spasmodically. &ldquo;Paula,&rdquo; said he,  and there was a depth in his tone even she had never heard before, &ldquo;are these  tears for me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a strong effort she controlled herself, looked up and faintly smiled. &ldquo;I am an  orphan,&rdquo; she gently murmured; &ldquo;you have been kind and tender to me beyond  words; I have let myself love you as a father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  spasm crossed his features, the hand he had lifted to lay upon her head fell at  his side, he surveyed her with eyes whose despairing fondness told her that her  love had been more than met by this desolate childless man. But he did not  reply as seemed natural, &ldquo;Be to me then as a child. I can offer you no mother  to guide or watch over you, but one parent is better than none. Henceforth you  shall be known as my daughter.&rdquo; Instead of that he shook his head mournfully,  yearningly but irrevocably, and said, &ldquo;To be your father would have been a dear  position to occupy. I have sometimes hoped that I might be so blessed as to  call it mine, but that is all past now. Your father I can never be. But I can  bless you,&rdquo; he murmured brokenly, &ldquo;not as I did that day in your aunt&rsquo;s little  cottage, but silently and from afar as God always meant you should be blessed  by me. Good-bye, Paula.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  all the deeps in her great nature broke up. She did not weep, but she looked at  him with her large dark eyes and the cry in them smote his heart. With a  struggle that blanched his face, he kept his arms at his side, but his lips  worked in agony, and he slowly murmured, &ldquo;If after a time your heart loves me  like this, and you are willing to bear shadow as well as sunshine with me, come  back with your aunt and sit at my hearthstone, not as my child but as a dear  and honored guest. I will try and be worthy&mdash;&rdquo; He paused, &ldquo;Will you come, Paula?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  soon, not now,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;God will show you when.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  with nothing but a look, without having touched her or so much as brushed her  garments with his, he retired again into his room.</p>

  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Give  it an understanding but no tongue.&rdquo;&mdash;Hamlet.</p>
  <p>Hopgood  was a man who could keep a secret, but who made so much ado in the process that  he reminded one of the placard found posted up somewhere out west which reads, &ldquo;A  treasure of gold concealed here; don&rsquo;t dig!&rdquo; Or so his wife used to say, and  she ought to know, for she had lived with him five years, three of which he had  spent in the detective service.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he would only trust the wife of his bosom with whatever he&rsquo;s got on his mind,  instead of ambling around the building with his eyes rolling about like peas in  a caldron of boiling water, one might manage to take some comfort in life, and  not hurt anybody either. For two days now, ever since the wife of Mr. Sylvester  died and Mr. Sylvester has been away from the bank, he&rsquo;s acted just like a  lunatic. Not that that has anything to do with his gettin up of nights and  roamin down five pair of stairs to see if the watchman is up to his duty, or  with his askin a dozen times a day if I remembers how Mr. Sylvester found him  and me, well nigh starvin in Broad Street, and gave him the good word which got  him into this place? O no! O no, of course not! But <i>something</i> has, and  while he persists in shutting out from his breast the woman he swore to love,  honor, and cherish, that woman is not bound to bear the trials of life with  patience. Every time he jumps out of his chair at the sound of Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s  name, and some one is always mentionin&rsquo; it, I plumps me down on mine with an  expression of my views regarding a kitchen stove that does all its drawin&rsquo; when  the oven&rsquo;s empty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  spake Mrs. Hopgood to her special crony and constant visitor, Mrs. Kirkshaw of  Water Street, pursing up a mouth that might have been good-natured if she had  ever given it an opportunity. But Mrs. Kirkshaw who passed for a gossip with  her neighbors, was a philosopher in the retirement of the domestic circle and  did not believe in the blow for blow system.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;La!&rdquo;  quoth she, with a smoothing out of her apron suggestive of her employment as  laundress, &ldquo;show a dog that you want his bone and you&rsquo;ll never get it. Husbands  is like that very stove you&rsquo;ve been a slanderin of. Rattle on coal when the  fire&rsquo;s low and you put it out entirely; but be a bit patient and drop it on  piece by piece, coaxing-like, and you&rsquo;ll have a hot stove afore you know it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Which  suggestion struck Mrs. Hopgood like a revelation, and for a day and night she  resorted to the coaxing system; the result of which was to send Mr. Hopgood out  of the room to sit on the stairs in mortal terror, lest his good nature should  get the better of his discretion. His little daughter, Constantia Maria&mdash;so  named and so called from two grandmothers, equally exacting in their claims and  equally impecunious as regards their resources&mdash;was his sole solace in this long  vigil. Her pretty innocent prattle scarcely disturbed his meditation, while it  soothed his nerves, and with no one by but this unsuspecting child, he could  roll his great eyes to his heart&rsquo;s content without fear of her descrying  anything in them, but the love with which her own little heart abounded.</p>
  <p>On  the morning after the funeral, however, Constantia Maria was restored to his  wife&rsquo;s arms on the plea that she did not seem quite well, and Hopgood went out  and sat alone. In a few minutes, however, he returned, and ambling restlessly  up and down the room, stopped before his persistently smiling wife and said  somewhat tremulously:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  Mr. Sylvester takes a notion to come up and see Constantia Maria to-day, I hope  you&rsquo;ll take the opportunity to finish your ironing or whatever else it is you  may have to do. I&rsquo;ve noticed he seems a little shy with the child when you are  around.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shy  with the child when I am around! well I do declare!&rdquo; exclaimed she, forgetting  her late r&ocirc;le in her somewhat natural indignation. &ldquo;And what have I ever done  to frighten Mr. Sylvester? Nothing but putting on of a clean apron, when he  comes in and a dustin&rsquo; of the best chair for his use. It&rsquo;s a trick of yours to  get a chance of speakin&rsquo; to him alone, and I&rsquo;ll not put up with it. As if it  wasn&rsquo;t bad enough to have a kettle with the nozzle dangling, without living  with a man who has a secret he won&rsquo;t share with his own wife and the mother of  his innocent babe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a start the worthy man stared at her till he grew red in the face, probably  with the effort of keeping his eyes steady for so long a time. &ldquo;Who told you I  had a secret?&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  told me?&rdquo; and then she laughed, though in a somewhat hysterical way, and sat  down in the middle of the floor and shook and shook again. &ldquo;Hear the man!&rdquo; she  cried. And she told him the story of the placard out west and then asked him, &ldquo;if  he thought she didn&rsquo;t remember how he used to act when he was a chasin&rsquo; up of a  thief in the days when he was on the police force.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo;  he cried, quite as pale now as he had been florid the moment before, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not  in the police force now and you are acting quite silly and I&rsquo;ve no patience  with you.&rdquo; And he was making for the door, presumably to sit upon the stairs,  when with a late repentance she seized him by the arm and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;La  now,&rdquo; an expression she had caught from Mrs. Kirkshaw, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean nothin&rsquo;  by my talk. Come back, John; Constantia Maria is not well, and if Mr. Sylvester  comes up to see her, I&rsquo;ll just slip out and leave you alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  upon that he told her she was a good wife and that if he had any secret from  her it was only because he was a poor man. &ldquo;Honesty and prudence are all the  treasures I possess to keep us three from starving. Shall I part with either of  them just to satisfy your curiosity?&rdquo; and being a good woman at heart, she said  &ldquo;no,&rdquo; though she secretly concluded that prudence in his case involved trust in  one&rsquo;s wife first, and disbelief in the rest of the world afterward; and took  her future resolutions accordingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Hopgood, you look anxious; do you want to speak to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  janitor eyed the changed and melancholy face of his patron, with an expression  in which real sympathy for his trouble, struggled with the respectful awe which  Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s presence was calculated to inspire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you please,&rdquo; said he, speaking very low, for more or less of the bank employees  were moving busily to and fro, &ldquo;Constantia Maria is not well and she has been  asking all day for the <i>dear man</i>, as she insists upon calling you, sir,  with many apologies for the freedom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester smiled with a faint far-away look in his dark eye that made Hopgood  stare uneasily out of the window. &ldquo;Sick! why then I must go up and see her,&rdquo; he  returned in a matter-of-fact way that proved his visits in that direction were  of no uncommon occurrence. &ldquo;A moment more and I shall be at liberty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hopgood  bowed and renewed his stare out of the window, with an intensity happily spared  from serious consequences to the passers-by, by the merciful celerity with  which Mr. Sylvester procured his overcoat, put such papers in his pocket as he  required, and joined him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Constantia  Maria, here is Mr. Sylvester come to see you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was a pleasure to observe how the little thing brightened in her mother&rsquo;s arms,  where but a moment before she had lain quite pale and still, and slipping to  the ground rushed up to meet the embrace of this stern and melancholy-faced  man. &ldquo;I am so glad you have come,&rdquo; she cried over and over again; and her  little arms went round his neck, and her soft cheek nestled against his, with a  content that made the mother&rsquo;s eyes sparkle with pleasure, as obedient to her  promise, she quietly left the room.</p>
  <p>And  Mr. Sylvester? If any one had seen the abandon with which he yielded to her  caresses and returned them, he would have understood why this child should have  loved him with such extraordinary affection. He kissed her forehead, he kissed  her cheek, and seemed never weary of smoothing down her bright and silky curls.  She reminded him of Geraldine. She had the same blue eyes and caressing ways. From  the day he had come upon his old friend Hopgood in a condition of necessity  almost of want, this blue-eyed baby had held its small sceptre over his lonely  heart, and unbeknown to the rest of the world, had solaced many a spare five  minutes with her innocent prattle. The Hopgoods understood the cause of his  predilection and were silent. It was the one thing Mrs. Hopgood never alluded  to in her gossips with Mrs. Kirkshaw. But to-day the attentions of Mr.  Sylvester to the little one seemed to make the janitor restless. He walked up  and down the narrow room uneasily surveying the pair out of the corner of his  great glassy eyes, till even Mr. Sylvester noticed his unusual manner and put  the child down, observing with a sigh, &ldquo;You think she is not well enough for  any excitement?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  sir, it is not that,&rdquo; returned the other uneasily, with a hasty look around  him. &ldquo;The fact is, I have something to say to you, sir, about&mdash;a discovery&mdash;I  made the other day.&rdquo; His words came very slowly, and he looked down with great  embarrassment.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester frowned slightly, and drew himself up to the full height of his very  imposing figure. &ldquo;A discovery,&rdquo; repeated he, &ldquo;when?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  day you paid that early visit to the bank, sir, the day Mrs. Sylvester died.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  frown on Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s brow grew deeper. &ldquo;The day&mdash;&rdquo; he began, and stopped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Excuse  me, sir,&rdquo; exclaimed Hopgood with a burst. &ldquo;I ought not to have mentioned it,  but you asked me <i>when</i>, and I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  was this discovery?&rdquo; inquired his superior, imperatively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  much,&rdquo; murmured the other now all in a cold sweat. &ldquo;But I felt as if I ought to  tell you. You have been my benefactor, sir, I can never forget what you have  done for me and mine. If I saw death or bereavement between me and any favor I  could do for you, sir, I would not hesitate to risk them. I am no talker, sir,  but I am true and I am grateful.&rdquo; He stopped, choked, and his eyes rolled  frightfully. Mr. Sylvester looked at him, grew a trifle pale, and put the  little child away that was nestling up against his knee.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have not told me what you have discovered,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  sir, only this.&rdquo; And he took from his pocket a small roll of paper which he  unfolded and held out in his hand. It contained a gold tooth-pick somewhat bent  and distorted.</p>
  <p>A  flush dark and ominous crept over Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s cheek. He glanced sternly at  the trembling janitor, and uttered a short, &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  found it on the floor of the bank just after you went out the other morning,&rdquo;  the other pursued well-nigh inaudibly. &ldquo;It was lying near the safe. As it was  not there when you went in, I took it for granted it was yours. Am I right,  sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  anxious tone in which this last question was uttered, the studied way in which  the janitor kept his eyes upon the floor could not have been unnoticed by Mr.  Sylvester, but he simply said,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have lost mine, that may very possibly be it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  janitor held it towards him; his eyes did not leave the floor. &ldquo;The  responsibility of my position here is sometimes felt by me to be very heavy,&rdquo;  muttered the man in a low, unmodulated tone. It was his duty in those days  previous to the Manhattan Bank robbery, to open the vault in the morning,  procure the books that were needed, and lay them about on the various desks in  readiness for the clerks upon their arrival. He had also the charge of the  boxes of the various customers of the bank who chose to entrust their valuables  to its safe keeping; which boxes were kept, together with the books, in that  portion of the vault to which he had access. &ldquo;I should regret my comfortable  situation here, but if it was necessary, I would go without a murmur, trusting  that God would take care of my poor little lamb.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hopgood,  what do you mean?&rdquo; asked Mr. Sylvester somewhat sternly. &ldquo;Who talks about  dismissing you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one,&rdquo; responded the other, turning aside to attend to some trivial matter. &ldquo;But  if ever you think a younger or a fresher man would be preferable in my place,  do not hesitate to make the change your own necessities or that of the Bank may  seem to require.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester&rsquo;s eye which was fixed upon the janitor&rsquo;s face, slowly darkened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is something underlying all this,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  once and as if he had taken his resolution, the janitor turned. &ldquo;I beg your  pardon,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I ought to have told you in the first place. When I opened  the vaults as usual on the morning of which I speak, I found the boxes  displaced; that was nothing if you had been to them, sir; but what did alarm me  and make me feel as if I had held my position too long was to find that one of  them was unlocked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester fell back a step.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was Mr. Stuyvesant&rsquo;s box, sir, and I remember distinctly seeing him lock it the  previous afternoon before putting it back on the shelf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  arms which Mr. Sylvester had crossed upon his breast tightened spasmodically. &ldquo;And  it has been in that condition ever since?&rdquo; asked he.</p>
  <p>The  janitor shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, taking his little girl up in his arms,  possibly to hide his countenance. &ldquo;As you did not come down again on that day,  I took the liberty of locking it with a key of my own when I went to put away  the books and shut the vault for the night.&rdquo; And he quietly buried his face in  his baby&rsquo;s floating curls, who feeling his cheek against her own put up her  hand and stroked it lovingly, crying in her caressing infantile tones,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  papa! poor tired papa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester&rsquo;s stern brow contracted painfully. The look with which his eye sought  the sky without, would have made Paula&rsquo;s young heart ache. Taking the child  from her father&rsquo;s clasp, he laid her on the bed. When he again confronted the  janitor his face was like a mask.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hopgood,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;you are an honest man and a faithful one; I appreciate your worth and  have had confidence in your judgment. Whom have you told of this occurrence  beside myself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another  question; if Mr. Stuyvesant had required his box that day and had found it in  the condition you describe, what would you have replied to his inquiries?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  janitor colored to the roots of his hair in an agony of shame Mr. Sylvester may  or may not have appreciated, but replied with the straightforward earnestness  of a man driven to bay, &ldquo;I should have been obliged to tell him the truth sir;  that whereas I had no personal knowledge of any one but myself, having been to  the vaults since the evening before, I was called upon early that morning to  open the outside door to you, sir, and that you came into the bank,&rdquo; (he did  not say looking very pale, agitated and unnatural, but he could not help  remembering it) &ldquo;and finding no one on duty but myself,&mdash;the watchman having  gone up stairs to take his usual cup of coffee before going home for the  day&mdash;you sent me out of the room on an errand, which delayed me some little  time, and that when I came back I found you gone, and every thing as I had left  it except that small pick lying on the floor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  last words were nearly inaudible but they must have been heard by Mr.  Sylvester, for immediately upon their utterance, the hand which unconsciously  had kept its hold upon the tooth-pick, opened and with an uncontrollable  gesture flung the miserable tell-tale into the stove near by.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hopgood,&rdquo;  said the stately gentleman, coming nearer and holding him with his eyes till  the poor man turned pale and cold as a stone, &ldquo;has Mr. Stuyvesant had occasion  to open his box since you locked it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  sir, he called for it yesterday afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  who gave it to him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he appear to miss anything from it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you believe, Hopgood, that there was anything missing from it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  janitor shrank like a man subjected to the torture. He fixed his glance on Mr.  Sylvester&rsquo;s face and his own gradually lightened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  sir!&rdquo; said he at last, with a gasp that made the little one lift her curly head  from her pillow and shake it with a slow and wistful motion strange to see in a  child of only two years.</p>
  <p>The  proud man bowed, not with the severity however that might have been expected;  indeed his manner was strangely shadowed, and though his lip betrayed no  uneasiness and his eye neither faltered or fell, there was a vague expression  of awe upon his countenance, which it would take more than the simple  understanding of the worthy but not over subtle man before him, to detect much  less to comprehend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may be sure that Mr. Stuyvesant will never complain of any one having tampered  with his effects while you are the guardian of the vaults,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr.  Sylvester in clear ringing tones. &ldquo;As for his box being open, it is right that  I should explain that it was the result of a mistake. I had occasion to go to a  box of my own in a hurry that morning, and misled by the darkness and my own  nervousness perhaps, took up his instead of my own. Not till I had opened  it&mdash;with the tooth-pick, Hopgood, for I had been to a reception and did not have  my keys with me&mdash;did I notice my mistake. I had intended to explain the matter  to Mr. Stuyvesant, but you know what happened that day, and since then I have  thought nothing of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  janitor&rsquo;s face cleared to its natural expression. &ldquo;You are very kind, sir, to  explain yourself to me,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it was not necessary.&rdquo; But his lightened  face spoke volumes. &ldquo;I have been on the police force and I know how to hold my  tongue when it is my duty, but it is very hard work when the duty is on the  other side. Have you any commands for me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester shook his head, and his eye roamed over the humble furniture and  scanty comforts of this poor man&rsquo;s domicile. Hopgood thought he might be going  to offer him some gift or guerdon, and in a low distressed tone spoke up:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall not try to ask your pardon, sir, for anything I have said. Honesty that  is afraid to show itself, is no honesty for me. I could not meet your eye,  knowing that I was aware of any circumstance of which you supposed me ignorant.  What I know, you must know, as long as I remain in the position you were once  kind enough to procure for me. And now that is all I believe, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester dropped his eyes from the bare walls over which they had been  restlessly wandering, and fixed them for a passing moment on the countenance of  the man before him. Then with a grave action he lifted his hat from his head,  and bowed with the deference he might have shown to one of his proudest  colleagues, and without another look or word, quietly left the room.</p>
  <p>Hopgood  in his surprise stared after him somewhat awe-struck. But when the door had  quite closed, he caught up his child almost passionately in his arms, and  crushing her against his breast, asked, while his eye roamed round the humble  room that in its warmth and comfort was a palace to him, &ldquo;Will he take the  first opportunity to have me dismissed, or will his heart forgive the  expression of my momentary doubts, for the sake of this poor wee one that he so  tenderly fancies?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  question did not answer itself, and indeed it was one to which time alone could  reply.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_23"></a>Chapter 23<br>
    The Poem</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  shot my arrow o&rsquo;er the house And hurt my brother.&rdquo;&mdash;Hamlet. </p>
  <p>When  Miss Belinda first saw Paula, she did not, like her sister, remark upon the  elegance of her appearance, the growth of her beauty, or the evidences of  increased refinement in the expression of her countenance and the carriage of  her form, but with her usual penetration noted simply, the sadness in her eye  and the tremulous motion of her lip.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  had then become fond of your cousin?&rdquo; queried she with characteristic  bluntness.</p>
  <p>Paula  not understanding the motive of this remark, questioned her with a look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Young  faces do not grow pale or bright eyes become troubled without a cause. Grief  for your cousin might explain it, but if you have suffered from no grief&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  cousin was very kind to me,&rdquo; hurriedly interrupted Paula. &ldquo;Her death was very  sudden and very heart-rending.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  it was;&rdquo; returned Miss Belinda, &ldquo;and I expected to see you look worn and sad  but not restless and feverish. You have a living grief, Paula, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young girl started and looked down. For the first time in her life she wished  to avoid that penetrating glance. &ldquo;If I have, I cannot talk of it,&rdquo; she  murmured. &ldquo;I have experienced so much this past week; my coming away was so unexpected,  that I hardly understand my own feelings, or realize just what it is that  troubles me most. All that I know is, that I am very tired and so sad, it seems  as if the sun would never shine again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is then something you have not written me?&rdquo; inquired the inexorable Miss  Belinda.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  experiences of this last week could never be written,&mdash;or told,&rdquo; returned Paula  with a droop of her head. &ldquo;Upon some things our better wisdom places a stone  which only the angels can roll away. The future lies all open before us; do not  let us disturb the past.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  Miss Belinda was forced to be content lest she should seem to be over anxious.</p>
  <p>Not  so the various neighbors and friends to whom the lengthened sojourn of one of  their number in an atmosphere of such wealth and splendor, possessed something  of the charm of a forbidden romance. For months Paula was obliged to endure  questions, that it required all her self-control to answer with calmness and  propriety. But at length the most insatiable gossip amongst them was satisfied;  Paula&rsquo;s figure was no longer a novelty in their streets; curiosity languished  and the young girl was allowed to rest.</p>
  <p>And  now could those who loved her, discern that with the lapse of time and the  daily breathings of her native air, the sad white look had faded from her face,  leaving it a marvel of freshness and positive, if somewhat spiritualized,  beauty. The print of deeper thoughts and holier yearnings was there, but no  sign of blighted hopes or uncomprehended passions. A passing wind had blown the  froth from off the cup, but had not disturbed the sparkle of the wine. She had  looked in the face of grief, but had not as yet been clasped in her relentless  arms. Only two things could vitally disturb her; a letter from Cicely, or a  sudden meeting in the village streets with that elderly lady who haunted the  Japha mansion. The former because it recalled a life around which her fancies  still played with dangerous persistency, and the latter because it aroused vain  and inexplicable conjectures as to that person&rsquo;s strange and lingering look in  her direction. Otherwise she was happy; finding in this simple village-life a  meaning and a purpose which her short but passionate outlook on a broader  field, had taught her, perhaps, both to detect and comprehend. She no longer  walked solitary with nature. The woods, the mountains with all their varying  panoply of exuberant verdure, had acquired a human significance. At her side  went the memories of beloved faces, the thoughts of trusted friends. From the  clouds looked forth a living eye, and in the sound of rustling leaf and singing  streamlet, spake the voices of human longing and human joy.</p>
  <p>Her  aunts had explained their position to Paula and she had responded by expressing  her determination to be a teacher. But they would not hear of that at present,  and while she waited their pleasure in the matter, she did what she could to  assist them in their simple home-life and daily duties, lending her beauty to  tasks that would have made the eyes of some of her quondam admirers open with  surprise, if only they could have followed the action of her hands, after  having once caught a glimpse of the face that brightened above them. And so the  summer months went by and September came.</p>
  <p>There  was to be an entertainment in the village and Paula was to assist. The idea had  come from her aunt and was not to be rejected. In one of the strange  incomprehensible moods which sometimes came upon her at this time, she had  written a poem, and nothing would do but that she must read it before the  assembled company of neighbors and friends, that were to be gathered at the  Squire&rsquo;s house on this gala evening. She did not wish to do it. The sacred  sense of possession passes when we uncover our treasure to another&rsquo;s eyes,  giving way to a lower feeling not to be courted by one of Paula&rsquo;s sensitive  nature. Besides she would rather have poured this first outburst of secret  enthusiasm into other ears than these; but she had given her word and the  ordeal must be submitted to. There are many who remember how she looked on that  night. She had arrayed herself for the occasion, in the prettiest of her  dresses, and mindful of Ona&rsquo;s injunction, did not mar the effect of its soft  and uniform gray with any hint of extraneous color. The result was that they  saw only her beauty; and what beauty! A very old man, an early settler in the  village, who had tottered out to enjoy a last glimpse of life before turning  his aged face to the wall, said it made the thought of heaven a little more  real. &ldquo;I can go home and think how the angels look,&rdquo; said he in his simple,  half-childish way. And no one contradicted him, for there was a still light on  her face that was less of earth than heaven, though why it should rest there  to-night she least of all could have told, for her poem had to do with earth  and its deepest passions and its wildest unrest. It was a clarion blast, not a  dreaming rhapsody, that lay coiled up in the paper she held in her hand.</p>
  <p>My  readers must pardon me if I give them Paula&rsquo;s poem, for without it they would  not understand its effect and consequent result. It was called, &ldquo;The Defence of  the Bride,&rdquo; and was of the old ballad order. As she rose to read, many of the  younger ones in the audience began cautiously to move to one side, but at the  first words, young as well as old paused and listened where they stood, for her  voice was round and full, and the memory of clashing spears and whirling  battle-axes that informed the war-song which she had heard Bertram play, was  with her, to give color to her tones and fire to her glance.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
  <p align="center"><b>The Defence of the Bride </b></p>
  <p class="note">He  was coming from the altar when the tocsin rang alarm, <br>
  With his fair young wife  beside him, lovely in her bridal charm; <br>
  But he was not one to palter with a  duty, or to slight <br>
  The trumpet-call of honor for his vantage or delight. </p>
  <p class="note">Turning  from the bride beside him to his stern and martial train, <br>
  From their midst he  summoned to him the brothers of Germain; <br>
  At the word they stepped before him,  nine strong warriors brave and true, <br>
  From the youngest to the eldest, Enguerrand  to mighty Hugh. </p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Sons  of Germain, to your keeping do I yield my bride to-day. <br>
  Guard her well as you  do love me; guard her well and holily. <br>
  Dearer than mine own soul to me, you  will hold her as your life, <br>
&lsquo;Gainst the guile of seeming friendship and the  force of open strife.&rdquo; </p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;We  will guard her,&rdquo; cried they firmly; and with just another glance <br>
  On the  yearning and despairing in his young wife&rsquo;s countenance, <br>
  Gallant Beaufort  strode before them down the aisle and through the door, <br>
  And a shadow came and lingered  where the sunlight stood before. </p>
  <p class="note">Eight  long months the young wife waited, watching from her bridal room <br>
  For the coming  of her husband up the valley forest&rsquo;s gloom. <br>
  Eight long months the sons of  Germain paced the ramparts and the wall, <br>
  With their hands upon their halberds  ready for the battle-call. </p>
  <p class="note">Then  there came a sound of trumpets pealing up the vale below, <br>
  And a dozen floating  banners lit the forest with their glow, <br>
  And the bride arose like morning when  it feels the sunlight nigh, <br>
  And her smile was like a rainbow flashing from a  misty sky. </p>
  <p class="note">But  the eldest son of Germain lifting voice from off the wall, <br>
  Cried aloud, &ldquo;It is  a stranger&rsquo;s and not Sir Beaufort&rsquo;s call; <br>
  Have you ne&rsquo;er a slighted lover or a  kinsman with a heart <br>
  Base enough to seek his vengeance at the sharp end of the  dart?&rdquo; </p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;There  is Sassard of the Mountains,&rdquo; answered she without guile, <br>
&ldquo;While I wedded at  the chancel, he stood mocking in the aisle; <br>
  And my maidens say he swore there  that for all my plighted vow, <br>
  They would see me in his castle yet upon Morency&rsquo;s  brow.&rdquo; </p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;It  is Sassard and no other then,&rdquo; her noble guardian cried; <br>
&ldquo;There is craft in  yonder summons,&rdquo; and he rung his sword beside. <br>
&ldquo;To the walls, ye sons of  Germain! and as each would hold his life <br>
From the bitter shame of falsehood,  let us hold our master&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo; </p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Can  you hold her, can you shield her from the breezes that await?&rdquo; <br>
  Cried the  stinging voice of Sassard from his stand beside the gate. <br>
&ldquo;If you have the  power to shield her from the sunlight and the wind, <br>
You may shield her from  stern Sassard when his falchion is untwined.&rdquo; </p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;We  can hold her, we can shield her,&rdquo; leaped like fire from off the wall, <br>
  And young  Enguerrand the valiant, sprang out before them all. <br>
&ldquo;And if breezes bring  dishonor, we will guard her from their breath, <br>
Though we yield her to the  keeping of the sacred arms of Death.&rdquo; </p>
  <p class="note">And  with force that never faltered, did they guard her all that day, <br>
  Though the  strength of triple armies seemed to battle in the fray, <br>
  The old castle&rsquo;s rugged  ramparts holding firm against the foe, <br>
  As a goodly dyke resisteth the whelming  billow&rsquo;s flow. </p>
  <p class="note">But  next morning as the sunlight rose in splendor over all, <br>
  Hugh the mighty, sank  heart-wounded in his station on the wall, <br>
  At the noon the valiant Raoul of the  merry eye and heart, <br>
  Gave his beauty and his jestings to the foeman&rsquo;s jealous  dart. </p>
  <p class="note">Gallant  Maurice next sank faltering with a death wound &lsquo;neath his hair, <br>
  But still  fighting on till Sassard pressed across him up the stair. <br>
  Generous Clement  followed after, crying as his spirit passed, <br>
&ldquo;Sons of Germain to the rescue,  and be loyal to the last!&rdquo; </p>
  <p class="note">Gentle  Jaspar, lordly Clarence, Sessamine the doughty brand, <br>
  Even Henri who had  yielded ne&rsquo;er before to mortal hand; <br>
  One by one they fall and perish, while the  vaunting foemen pour <br>
  Through the breach and up the courtway to the very turret&rsquo;s  door. </p>
  <p class="note">Enguerrand  and Stephen only now were left of all that nine, <br>
  To protect the single stairway  from the traitor&rsquo;s fell design; <br>
  But with might as &lsquo;twere of thirty, did they  wield the axe and brand, <br>
  Striving in their desperation the fierce onslaught to  withstand. </p>
  <p class="note">But  what man of power so godlike he can stay the billow&rsquo;s wrack, <br>
  Or with  single-handed weapon hold an hundred foemen back! <br>
  As the sun turned sadly  westward, with a wild despairing cry, <br>
  Stephen bowed his noble forehead and sank  down on earth to die. </p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Ah  ha!&rdquo; then cried cruel Sassard with his foot upon the stair, <br>
&ldquo;Have I come to  thee, my boaster?&rdquo; and he whirled his sword in air. <br>
&ldquo;Thou who pratest of thy  power to protect her to the death, <br>
What think&rsquo;st thou now of Sassard and the  wind&rsquo;s aspiring breath?&rdquo; </p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;What  I think let this same show you,&rdquo; answered fiery Enguerrand, <br>
  And he poised his  lofty battle-ax with sure and steady hand; <br>
&ldquo;Now as Heaven loveth justice, may  this deathly weapon fall <br>
On the murderer of my brothers and th&rsquo; undoer of us  all.&rdquo; </p>
  <p class="note">With  one mighty whirl he sent it; flashing from his hand it came, <br>
  Like the lightning  from the heavens in a whirl of awful flame, <br>
  And betwixt the brows of Sassard  and his two false eyeballs passed, <br>
  And the murderer sank before it, like a tree  before the blast. </p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Now  ye minions of a traitor if you look for vengeance, come!&rdquo; <br>
  And his voice was  like a trumpet when it clangs a victor home. <br>
  But a cry from far below him rose  like thunder upward, <br>
&ldquo;Nay! Let them turn and meet the <i>husband</i> if they  hunger for the fray.&rdquo; </p>
  <p class="note">O  the yell that sprang to heaven as that voice swept up the stair, <br>
  And the  slaughter dire that followed in another moment there! <br>
  From the least unto the  greatest, from the henchman to the lord, <br>
  Not a man on all that stairway lived  to sheath again his sword. </p>
  <p class="note">At  the top that flame-bound forehead, at the base that blade of fire&mdash; <br>
&lsquo;Twas the  meeting of two tempests in their potency and ire. <br>
  Ere the moon could falter  inward with its pity and its woe, <br>
  Beaufort saw the path before him unencumbered  of the foe. </p>
  <p class="note">Saw  his pathway unencumbered and strode up and o&rsquo;er the floor, <br>
  Even to the very  threshold of his lovely lady&rsquo;s door, <br>
  And already in his fancy did he see the  golden beam<br>
  Of her locks upon his shoulder and her sweet eyes&rsquo; happy gleam: </p>
  <p class="note">When  behold a form upstarting from the shadows at his side. <br>
  That with naked sword  uplifted barred the passage to his bride; <br>
  It was Enguerrand the dauntless, but  with staring eyes and hair <br>
  Blowing wild about a forehead pale as snow in  moonlit glare. </p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Ah  my master, we have held her, we have guarded her,&rdquo; he said, <br>
&ldquo;Not a shadow of  dishonor has so much as touched her head. <br>
  Twenty wretches lie below there with  the brothers of Germain, <br>
  Twenty foemen of her honor that I, Enguerrand, have  slain. </p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;But  one other foe remaineth, one remaineth yet,&rdquo; he cried, <br>
&ldquo;Which it fits this hand  to punish ere you cross unto your bride. <br>
It is I, Enguerrand!&rdquo; shrieked he; &ldquo;and  as I have slain the rest, <br>
So I smite this foeman also!&rdquo;&mdash;and his sword plunged  through his breast. </p>
  <p class="note">O  the horror of that moment! &ldquo;Art thou mad my Enguerrand?&rdquo; <br>
  Cried his master,  striving wildly to withdraw the fatal brand. <br>
  But the stern youth smiling sadly,  started back from his embrace, <br>
  While a flash like summer lightning, flickered  direful on his face. </p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Yes,  a traitor worse than Sassard;&rdquo; and he pointed down the stair, <br>
&ldquo;For my heart has  dared to love her whom my hand defended there. <br>
  While the others fought for  honor, I by passion was made strong, <br>
  Set your heel upon my bosom for my soul  has done you wrong. </p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;But,&rdquo;  and here he swayed and faltered till his knee sank on the floor, <br>
  Yet in falling  turned his forehead ever toward that silent door; <br>
  &ldquo;But your warrior hand my  master, may take mine without a stain, <br>
  For my hand has e&rsquo;er been loyal, and  your enemy is slain.&rdquo; </p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>A  short silence followed the last word, then a burst of applause testified to the  appreciation of her audience, and Paula crept away to hide her blushing cheeks  in the comparative darkness of a little vine-covered balcony that jutted out  from the ante-room. What were her thoughts as she leaned there! In the  subsidence of any great emotion&mdash;and Paula had felt every word she uttered&mdash;there  is more or less of shock and tumult. She did not think, she only felt. Suddenly  a hand was laid on her arm and a low voice whispered in her ear,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you write that poem yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Turning,  she encountered the shadowy form of a woman leaning close at her side and  appearing in the dim light that shone on her from the lamps beyond, an eager  image of expectancy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  returned Paula, &ldquo;why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  woman, whoever she was, did not answer. &ldquo;And you believe in such devotion as  that!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;You can understand a man, aye, or a woman either, risking  happiness and fame, life and death, for the sake of a trust! Such things are  not folly to you! You could see a heart spill itself drop by drop through a  longer vigil than the eight months watching on the ramparts, and not sneer at a  fidelity that could not falter because it had given its word? Speak; you write  of faithfulness with a pen of fire, is your heart faithful too?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was something in these words, spoken as they were in a tone of suppressed  passion, that startled and aroused Paula. Leaning forward, she endeavored to  see the face of the woman who thus forcibly addressed her, but the light was  too dim. The outline of a brow covered by some close headgear was all she could  detect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  speak earnestly,&rdquo; said Paula, &ldquo;but that is what I like. Fidelity to a cause, or  fidelity to a trust, demands the sympathy and admiration of all honest and  generous hearts. If I am ever called upon to maintain either, I hope that my  enthusiasm will not have all been expended in words.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  please me,&rdquo; murmured the woman, &ldquo;you please me; will you come and see me and  let me tell you a story to mate the poem you have given us to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  trembling eagerness of her tone it would be impossible to describe. Paula was  thrilled by it. &ldquo;If you will tell me who you are,&rdquo; said Paula, &ldquo;I certainly  will try and come. I should be glad to hear anything you have to relate to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought every one knew who I was,&rdquo; returned the woman; and drawing Paula back  into the ante-room, she turned her face upon her. &ldquo;Any one will tell you where  Margery Hamlin lives,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Do not disappoint me, and do not keep me  waiting long.&rdquo; And with a nod and a deep strange smile that made her aged face  almost youthful, she entered the crowd and disappeared from Paula&rsquo;s sight.</p>
  <p>It  was the woman whose nightly visits to the deserted home of the Japhas had once  been the talk and was still the unsolved mystery of the town.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_24"></a>Chapter 24<br>
    The Japha Mansion</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Ah  what a warning for a thoughtless man, <br>
  Could field or grove, could any spot on  earth <br>
  Show to his eye an image of the pangs <br>
  Which it has witnessed; render back  an echo <br>
  Of the sad steps by which it hath been trod.&mdash;Wordsworth. </p>
  <p>Unexplained  actions if long continued, lose after awhile their interest if not their  mystery. The aged lady who now for many years had been seen at every night-fall  to leave her home, traverse the village streets, enter the Japha mansion,  remain there an hour and then re-issue with tremulous steps and bowed head, had  become so common a sight to the village eye, that even the children forgot to  ask what her errand was, or why she held her head so hopefully when she  entered, or looked so despondent when she came forth.</p>
  <p>But  to Paula, for reasons already mentioned, this secret and persistent vigil in a  forsaken and mysterious dwelling, was fraught with a significance which had never  lost its power either to excite her curiosity or to arouse her imagination.  Many a time had she gone home from some late encounter with the aged lady, to  brood by the hour upon the expression of that restless eye which in its  wanderings never failed to turn upon her own youthful face and linger there in  the manner I have already noted. She thought of it by night, she thought of it  by day. She felt herself drawn to that woman&rsquo;s suffering heart as by invisible  cords. To understand the feelings of this desolate being, she had even studied  the face of that old house, until she knew it under its every aspect. Often in  shutting her eyes at night, she would perceive as in a mirror a vision of its  long gray front, barred door and sealed windows shining in the moon, save where  the deep impenetrable shadows of its two guardian poplars lay black and dismal  upon its ghostly surface. Again she would behold it as it reared itself dark  and dripping in a blinding storm, its walls plastered with leaves from the  immovable poplars, and its neglected garden lying sodden and forlorn under the  flail of the ceaseless storm. Then its early morning face would strike her  fancy. The slow looming of its chimney-tops against a brightening sky; the  gradual coming out of its forsaken windows and solemn looking doors from the  mystery of darkness into the no less mystery of day; the hint of roselight on  its barren boards; the gleam of sunshine on its untrodden threshold; a sunshine  as pure and sweet as if a bride stood there in her beauty, waiting for  admission into the deserted halls beyond. All and everything that could tend to  invest the house and its constant visitor with an atmosphere of awe and  interest, had occurred to this young girl in her daily reveries and nightly  dreams. It was therefore with a thrill deep as her expectation and vivid as her  sympathy, that she recognized in her eager interlocutor and proposed confident,  the woman about whose life and actions rested for her such a veil of  impenetrable mystery. The thought moved her, excited her, and made the rest of  the evening pass like a dream. She was anxious for the next day to come, that  she might seek this Mrs. Hamlin in her home, and hear from her lips the tale of  devotion that should mate her own simple but enthusiastic poem.</p>
  <p>When  the next day did come, it rained, rained bitterly, persistent and with a steady  drive from the north east, that made her going out impossible. The day  following she was indisposed, and upon the succeeding afternoon, she was  engaged in duties that precluded all thought of visiting. The next day was  Sunday, and Monday had its own demands which she could not slight. It was  therefore well nigh a week from the night of the entertainment, before the  opportunity offered for which she was so anxious. Her curiosity and expectation  had thus time to grow, and it was with a determination to allow nothing to  stand in her way, that she set out from home in a flood of mild September  sunshine, to visit Mrs. Hamlin. But alas, for resolutions made in a country village  prior to the opening of a church fair! She had scarcely gone a dozen steps  before she was accosted by one of the managers, a woman who neither observes  your haste, nor pays any attention to your possible preoccupation. Do what she  could, she found it impossible to escape from this persistent individual until  she had satisfied her upon matters which it took a full half hour to discuss,  and when at last she succeeded in doing so, it was only to fall into the hands  of an aged deacon of the church, whose protecting friendship it were a sin to  wound, while his garrulous tongue made it no ordinary trial of patience to  stand and listen. In short the best part of the afternoon was gone before she  found herself at the door of Mrs. Hamlin&rsquo;s house. But she was not to be  deterred by further hesitation from the pursuit of her object. Rapping smartly  on the door, she listened. No stir came from within. Again she rapped and again  she listened. No response came to assure her that her summons had been heard.  Surprised at this, for she had been told Mrs. Hamlin was always at home during  the afternoon, she glanced up at the church clock in plain view from the  doorstep, and blushed to observe that it was six o&rsquo;clock, the hour at which  this mysterious woman always left her house, to accomplish her vigil at the  Japha mansion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  have I done?&rdquo; thought Paula, and felt a strange thrill as she realized that  even at that moment, the woman with the eager but restless eyes, was shut  within the precincts of that deserted dwelling, engaged in prayer, perhaps wet  with tears, who knows? The secret of what she did in that long and quiet  twilight hour had never been revealed. Leaving the little brown house behind,  Paula found herself insensibly taking the road to the Japha mansion. If she could  not enter it and share the watch of the devoted woman who had promised her her  confidence, she could at least observe if the windows were open or the blinds  raised. To be sure she ought to be at home, but Miss Belinda was indulgent and  did not question her comings and goings too closely. An irresistible force drew  her down the street, and she did not hesitate to follow the lead of her  impulse. No one accosted her now, it was the tea hour in most of these houses  and the streets were comparatively deserted. The only house whose chimneys  lacked the rising smoke, was the one towards which her footsteps were tending.  She could descry it from afar. Its gaunt walls from which the paint had long  ago faded, stared uncompromisingly upon her in the autumn sunshine. There was  no welcome in its close shutters with their broken slats from which hung  tangled strips of old rags&mdash;the remnants of some boy&rsquo;s kite. The stiff and  solemn poplars rose grim and forbidding at the gate once swung wide to the  fashion and gallantry of proud ladies and stalwart gentlemen, but now pushed  aside solely by the hand of a tremulous old woman, or the irreverent palm of  some daring school-boy. From the tangled garden looked forth neither flower nor  blossoming shrub. Beauty and grace could not thrive in this wilderness of  decay. A dandelion would have felt itself out of place beneath the eye of that  ghostly door, with the sinister plank nailed across it, like the separating  line between light and darkness, right and wrong, life and death. What loneliness!  what a monument of buried passions outliving death itself!</p>
  <p>Paula  paused as she reached the gate; but remembering that Mrs. Hamlin was accustomed  to enter the house by a side door, hurried around the corner and carefully  surveyed the windows from that quarter. One of the shutters was open, allowing  the flame of the setting sun to gild the panes like gold. She did not know then  nor has she been able to explain since, what it was that came over her at the  sight, but almost before she realized it, she had returned to the gate, opened  it, threaded the overgrown garden, reached the door which she had so frequently  beheld the aged woman enter and knocked.</p>
  <p>Instantly  she was seized with a consciousness of what she had done, and frightened at her  temerity, meditated an immediate escape. Drawing the folds of her mantle about  her form and face, she prepared to fly, when she remembered the look of  entreaty with which this woman had said on that night of their conversation, &ldquo;Do  not disappoint me! Do not keep me long in suspense!&rdquo; and moved by a fresh  impulse, turned and inflicted another resounding knock on the door.</p>
  <p>The  result was unlooked-for and surprising. To the sound from within of a quick  passionate cry, there came a hurried movement, followed by a deep silence, then  another hasty stir succeeded by a longer silence, then a rush which seemed to  bring all things with it, and the door opened and Mrs. Hamlin appeared before  her with a countenance so pallid with expectancy, that Paula instinctively felt  that in some unconscious way, she had loosened the bonds of an uncontrollable  emotion, and was drawing back, when the woman with a quick look in her shrouded  face, exultantly caught her hand in hers, and drawing her over the threshold,  gasped out in a delirium of incomprehensible joy:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew you would come! I knew that God would not let you forget! Fifteen years  have I waited, Jacqueline! fifteen long, tedious, suffering years! But they all  seem like nothing now! You have come, you have come, and all that I ask, is  that God will not let me die till I realize my joy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  emotion with which she uttered these strange words was so overpowering, and her  body seemed so weak to stand the strain, that Paula instinctively put forth her  hand to sustain her. The action loosened her cloak. Instantly the eyes that had  been fixed upon her with such delirious rapture grew blank with dismay, a  frightful shudder ran through the woman&rsquo;s aged frame; she tore at the cloak  that still enveloped the young girl&rsquo;s shoulders, and pulling it off, took one  view of the fresh and beautiful countenance before her, and without uttering a  word, fell back in a deep and deadly swoon upon the floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O  what have I done?&rdquo; cried Paula, flinging herself down beside that pale and  rigid figure; but instantly remembering herself she leaped to her feet and  looked about for some means to resuscitate the sufferer. There was a goblet of  water on a table near by. Seizing it, she bathed the face and hands of the  woman before her, moaning aloud in her grief and dismay, &ldquo;Have I killed her! O  what is this mystery that brings such a doom of anguish to this poor heart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  from those pallid lips came no response, and feeling greatly alarmed, Paula was  about to rush from the house for assistance, when she felt a tremulous pull  upon her skirt, and turning, saw that the glassy eyes had opened at last and  were now gazing upon her with mute but eloquent appeal.</p>
  <p>She  instantly returned. &ldquo;O I am so sorry,&rdquo; she murmured, sinking again upon her  knees beside the suffering woman. &ldquo;I did not know, could not realize that my  presence here would affect you so deeply. Forgive me and tell me what I can do  to make you forget my presumption.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  woman shook her head, her lips moved and she struggled vainly to rise. Paula  immediately lent her the aid of her strong young hand and in a few minutes,  Mrs. Hamlin was on her feet. &ldquo;O God!&rdquo; were her first words as she sank into the  chair which Paula hastily drew forward, &ldquo;that I should taste the joy and she be  still unsaved!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Seeing  her so absorbed, Paula ventured to glance around her. She found herself in a  large square room sparsely but comfortably furnished in a style that bespake it  as the former sitting-room of the dead and buried Japhas. From the walls above  hung a few ancient pictures. A large hair-cloth sofa of a heavy antique shape,  confronted the eye from one side of the room, an equally ancient book-case from  the other. The carpet was faded and so were the curtains, but they had once  been of an attractive hue and pattern. Conspicuous in the midst stood a large  table with a well-trimmed lamp upon it, and close against it an easy chair with  an upright back. This last as well as everything else in the room, was in a  condition of neatness that would have surprised Paula if she had not been acquainted  with the love and devotion of this woman, who in her daily visits to this  house, probably took every pains to keep things freshened and in order.</p>
  <p>Satisfied  with her survey, she again directed her attention to Mrs. Hamlin, and started  to find that person&rsquo;s eyes fixed upon her own with an expression of deep,  demanding interest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are looking at the shadows of things that were,&rdquo; exclaimed the old lady in  thrilling tones. &ldquo;It is a fearful thought to be shut up with the ghost of a  vanished past, is it not? That chair by your side has not been sat in since  Colonel Japha rose from it twelve years ago to totter to the bed where he  breathed his last. It is waiting, everything is waiting. I thought the end had  come to-night, that the vigil was over, the watch finished, but God in his  wisdom says, &lsquo;No,&rsquo; and I must wait a little longer. Alas in a little while  longer the end will be here indeed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  despondency with which she uttered these last words showed where her thoughts  were tending, and to comfort her, Paula drew up a chair and sat down by her  side. &ldquo;You were going to tell me the story of a great love and a great  devotion. Cannot you do so now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  woman started, glanced hastily around, and let her eyes travel to Paula&rsquo;s face  where they rested with something of their old look of secret longing and doubt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are the one who wrote the poem,&rdquo; she murmured; &ldquo;I remember.&rdquo; Then with a sudden  feverish impulse, leaned forward, and stroking back the waving locks from Paula&rsquo;s  brow, exclaimed hurriedly, &ldquo;You look like her, you have the same dark hair and  wonderful eyes, more beautiful perhaps, but like her, O so like her! That is  why I made such a mistake.&rdquo; She shuddered, with a quick low sob, but instantly  subdued her emotion and taking Paula&rsquo;s hand in hers continued, &ldquo;You are young,  my daughter; youth does not enjoy carrying burdens; can I, a stranger ask you  to assist me with mine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may,&rdquo; returned Paula. &ldquo;If it will give you any relief I will help you bear it  willingly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will! Has heaven then sent me the aid my failing spirits demand? Can I count on  you, child? But I will ask for no promise till you have heard my story. To no  one have I ever imparted the secret of my life, but from the first moment I saw  your fair young face, I felt that through you would come my help, if help ever  came to make my final moments easier and my last days less bitter.&rdquo; And rising  up, she led Paula to a door which she solemnly opened. &ldquo;I am glad that you are  here,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I could never have asked you to come, but since you have  braved the dead and crossed this threshold, you must see and know the whole.  You will understand my story better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Taking  her through a dark passage, she threw wide another door, and the parlors of the  vanished Japhas opened before them. It was a ghostly vision. A weird twilight  scene of clustered shadows brooding above articles of musty grandeur. In spite  of the self-command learned by her late experiences, Paula recoiled, saying,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is too sad, too lonesome!&rdquo; But the woman without heeding her, hurried her on  over the worm-eaten carpet and between the time-worn chairs and heavy-browed  cabinets, to the hall beyond.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have not been here, myself, for a year,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hamlin, glancing fearfully  up and down the dusky corridor. &ldquo;It is not often I can brave the memories of  this spot.&rdquo; And she pointed with one hand towards the darkened door at its end,  whose spacious if not stately panels gave no hint to the eye of the dread bar  that crossed it like a line of doom upon the outside, and then turning, let her  eye fall with still heavier significance upon the broad and imposing staircase  that rose from the centre of the hall to the duskier and more dismal regions  above.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  brave, old fashioned flight of steps is it not! But the scene of a curse, my  child.&rdquo; And unheeding Paula&rsquo;s shudder, she drew her up the stairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo;  continued her panting guide as they reached a square platform near the top,  from which some half dozen or more steps branched up on either side. &ldquo;They do  not build like this nowadays. But Colonel Japha believed in nothing new, and  thought more of his grand old hall and staircase, than he did of all the rest  of his house. He little dreamed of what a scene it would be the witness. But  come, it is getting late and you must see her room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was near the top of the staircase and was fully as musty, faded and dismal as  the rest. Yet there was an air of expectancy about it, too, that touched Paula  deeply. From between the dingy hangings of the bed, looked forth a pair of  downy pillows, edged with yellowed lace, and beneath them a neatly spread  counterpane carefully turned back over comfortable-looking blankets, as one  sees in a bed that only awaits its occupant; while on the ancient hearth, a  pile of logs stood heaped and ready for the kindling match.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is all waiting you see,&rdquo; said the old lady in a trembling voice, &ldquo;like  everything else, just waiting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was an embroidery frame in one corner of the room, from which looked a piece of  faded and half completed work. The needle was hanging from it by a thread, and  a skein of green worsted hung over the top, Paula glanced at it inquiringly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is just as she left it! He never entered the room after she went and I would  never let it be touched. It is just the same with the piano below. The last  piece she played is still standing open on the rack. I loved her so, and I  thought then that a few months would bring her back! See, here is her bible.  She never used to read it, but she prized it because it was her mother&rsquo;s. I  have placed it on the pillow where she will see it when she comes to lay her  poor tired head down to rest.&rdquo; And with a reverent hand the aged matron drew  the curtains back from the open bed, and disclosed the little bible lying thick  with dust in the centre of the nearest pillow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O  who was this you loved so well? And why did she leave you?&rdquo; cried Paula with  the tears in her eyes, at sight of this humble token.</p>
  <p>The  aged lady seized her hand and hurried her back into the room below. &ldquo;I will  tell you where I have waited and watched so long. Only be patient till I light  the lamp. It is getting late and any chance wanderer going by and seeing all  dark, might think I had forgotten my promise and was not here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There  are some men that have the appearance of being devoid of family affection, who  in reality cherish it in the deepest and most passionate degree. Such a man was  Colonel Japha. You have doubtless heard from your cradle what the neighbors  thought of this stately, old fashioned gentleman. He was too handsome in his  youth, too proudly reticent in his manhood, too self-contained and unrelenting  in his age, not to be the talk of any town that numbered him among its  inhabitants. But only from myself, a relative of the family and his housekeeper  for years, can you learn with what undeviating faith and love he clung to the  few upon whom he allowed his heart to fasten in affection. When he married Miss  Carey, the world said, &lsquo;He has chosen a beauty, because fine manners and a  pretty face look well behind the Japha coffee-urn!&rsquo; But we, that is, this same  young wife and myself, knew that in marrying her he had taken unto himself his  other half, the one sweet woman for whom his proud heart could beat and before  whom his stately head could bow. When she died, the world exclaimed, &lsquo;He will  soon fill her place!&rsquo; But I who watched the last look that passed between them  in the valley of the shadow of that death, knew that the years would come and  the years would go without seeing Colonel Japha marry again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  little babe whom she left to his care, took all the love which he had left.  From the moment it began to speak, he centered in its tiny life all the hope  and all the pride of his solitary heart. And the Japha pride was nearly as  great as the Japha heart. She was a pretty child; not a beauty like her mother  or like you, my dear, who however so nearly resemble her. But for all that,  pretty enough to satisfy the eyes of her secretly doting father, and her openly  doting nurse and cousin. I say secretly doting father. I do not mean by that  that he regarded her with an affection which he never displayed, but that it  was his way to lavish his caresses at home and in the privacy of her little  nursery. He never made a parade of anything but his pride. If he loved her, it  was enough for her to know it. In the street and the houses of their friends,  he was the strict, somewhat severe father, to whom her childish eyes lifted at  first with awe, but afterwards with a quiet defiance, that when I first saw it,  made my heart stand still with unreasoning alarm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was so reserved a child and yet so deeply passionate. From the beginning I felt  that I did not understand her. I loved her; I have never loved any mortal as I  did her&mdash;and do; but I could not follow her impulses or judge of her feelings by  her looks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  she grew older it was still worse. She never contradicted her father, or  appeared in any open way to disobey his commands, or thwart him in his plans.  Yet she always did what she pleased, and that so quietly, he frequently did not  observe that matters had taken any other direction, than that which he had  himself ordained. &lsquo;It is her mother&rsquo;s tact,&rsquo; he used to say. Alas it was  something more than that; it was her father&rsquo;s will united to the  unscrupulousness of some forgotten ancestor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  with the glamour of her eighteen years upon me, I did not recognize this then,  any more than he. I saw her through the magic glasses of my own absorbing love,  and tremble as I frequently would in the still scorn of her unfathomable  passion, I never dreamed she could do anything that would seriously offend her  father&rsquo;s affection or mortify his pride. The truth is, that Jacqueline did not  love us. Say what you will of the claims of kindred, and the right of every  father to his childrens&rsquo; regard, Jacqueline Japha accepted the devotion that  was lavished upon her, but she gave none in return. She could not, perhaps. Her  father was too cold in public and too warm in his home-bursts of affection. I  was plain and a widow; no mate for her in age, condition or estate. She could  neither look up to me nor lean upon me. I had been her nurse in childhood and  though a relative, was still a dependent; what was there in all that to love!  If her mother had lived&mdash;But we will not dwell on possibilities. Jacqueline had  no mother and no friend that was dear enough to her, to teach her unwilling  soul the great lesson of self-control and sacrifice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will say that is strange. That situated as she was, she ought to have found  friends both dear and congenial; but that would be to declare that Jacqueline  was like others of her age and class, whereas she was single and alone; a  dark-browed girl, who allured the gaze of both men and women, but who cared but  little for any one till&mdash;But wait, child. I shall have to speak of matters that  will cause your cheeks to blush. Lay your head down on my knee, for I cannot  bear the sight of blushes upon a cheek more innocent than hers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a gentle movement she urged Paula to sit upon a little stool at her feet,  pressed the young girl&rsquo;s head down upon her lap, and burying the lovely brow  beneath her aged hands, went hurriedly on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are young, dear, and may not know what it is to love a man. Jacqueline was  young also, but from the moment she returned home to us from a visit she had  been making in Boston, I perceived that something had entered her life that was  destined to make a great change in her; and when a few weeks later, young  Robert Holt from Boston, came to pay his respects to her in her father&rsquo;s house,  I knew, or thought I did, what that something was. We were sitting in this room  I remember, when the servant-girl came in, and announced that Mr. Holt was in  the parlor. Jacqueline was lying on the sofa, and her father was in his usual  chair by the table. At the name, Holt, the girl rose as if it had suddenly  thundered, or the lightning had flashed. I see her now. She was dressed in  white&mdash;though it was early fall she still clung to her summer dresses&mdash;her dark  hair was piled high, and caught here and there with old-fashioned gold pins, a  splendid red rose burned on her bosom, and another flashed crimson as blood  from her folded hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Holt?&rsquo;  repeated the Colonel without turning his head, &lsquo;I know no such man.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He  said he wished to see Miss Jacqueline,&rsquo; simpered the servant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo;  returned the Colonel indifferently. He never showed surprise before the  servants&mdash;and went on with his book, still without turning his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought if he had turned it, he would scarcely sit there reading so quietly;  for Jacqueline who had not stirred from her alert and upright position, was  looking at him in a way no father, least of all a father who loved his child as  he did her, could have beheld without agitation. It was the glance of a tigress  waiting for the sight of an inconsiderate move, in order to spring. It was wild  unconstrainable joy, eying a possible check and madly defying it. I shuddered  as I looked at her eye, and sickened as I perceived a huge drop of blood ooze  from her white fingers, where they unconsciously clutched a thorn, and drop  dark and disfiguring upon her virgin garments. At the indifferent exclamation  of her father, her features relaxed, and she turned haughtily towards the girl,  with a veiling of her secret delight that already bespoke the woman of the  world.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tell  Mr. Holt that I will see him presently,&rsquo; said she, and was about to follow the  girl from the room when I caught her by the sleeve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You  will have to change your dress,&rsquo; said I, and I pointed to the ominous blot  disfiguring its otherwise spotless white.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  started and gave me a quick glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I  have a skin like a spider&rsquo;s web,&rdquo; cried she. &lsquo;I should never meddle with roses.&rsquo;  But I noticed she did not toss the blossom away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who  is this Mr. Holt?&rsquo; now asked the Colonel suddenly turning, the servant having  left the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He  is a gentleman I met in Boston,&rsquo; came from his daughter&rsquo;s lips, in her usual  light and easy tones. &lsquo;He is probably passing through our town on his way to  Providence, where I was told he did business. His call is no more than a  formality, I presume.&rsquo; And with an indifferent little smile and nod, she  vanished from the room, that a moment before had been filled with the threat of  her silent passion. The Colonel gave a short sigh but returned undisturbed to  his book.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the course of a few minutes Jacqueline came back. She had changed her dress for  one as summerlike as the other, but still finer and more elaborate. She looked  elegant, imperious, but the joy had died out from her eyes, and in its place  was another expression incomprehensible to me, but fully as alarming as any  that had gone before. &lsquo;Mr. Holt finds himself obliged to remain in town over  night, and would like to pay his respects to you,&rsquo; said she to her father.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Colonel immediately rose, looking very grand as he turned and surveyed his  daughter with his clear penetrating eye.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You  have a lover, have you not?&rsquo; he asked, laying his hand on her bare and  beautifully polished shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  odd little smile crossed her lip. She looked at her hands on which never a ring  shone, and coquettishly tossed her head. &lsquo;Let the gentleman speak for himself,&rsquo;  said she, &lsquo;I give no man his title until he has earned it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  father laughed. A lover was not such a dreadful thing in his eyes provided he  were worthy. And Jacqueline would not choose unworthily of course&mdash;a Japha and  his daughter! &lsquo;Well then,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;let us see if he can make good his title;  Holt is not a bad name and Boston is not a poor place to hail from.&rsquo; And  without more ado, they hurried from the room. But the light had all died out  from her face! What did it mean?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  tea time I met the gentleman. He had evidently made his title good. I was not only  favorably impressed with him but actually struck. Of all the high-bred,  clear-eyed, polished and kindly gentlemen who had sat about the board since I  first came into the family in Mrs. Japha&rsquo;s lifetime, here was surely the  finest, the handsomest and the best; and surprised in more ways than one, I was  giving full play to my relief and exhilaration, when I caught sight of  Jacqueline&rsquo;s eye, and felt again the cold shudders of secret doubt and  apprehension. Smile upon him as she would, coquet with him as she did, the  flame and the glory that drew her like an inspiration to her feet when his name  was announced, had fled, and left not a shadow behind. Had he failed in his  expressions of devotion? Was he hard or cold or severe, under all that pleasant  and charming manner? Had the hot soul of our motherless child rushed upon ice,  and in the shock of the dreadful chill, fallen inert? No, his looks bespake no  coldness; they dwelt upon Jacqueline&rsquo;s lovely but inscrutable face, with honest  fervor and boundless regard. He evidently loved her most passionately, but  she&mdash;if it had not been for that first moment of unconscious betrayal, I should  have decided that she cared for him no more than she did for the few others who  had adored her, in the short space of her incomprehensible life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  mystery was not cleared up when she came to me that night with a short, &lsquo;How do  you like my lover, Margery?&rsquo; I was forty years her senior, but she always  called me Margery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I  think he is the finest, most agreeable man I ever met,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;Is he your  lover, Jacqueline? Are you going to marry him?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  turned about from the vase which she was denuding of its flowers, and gave me  one of her sphinx-like looks. &lsquo;You must ask papa,&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;He holds the  destinies of the Japhas in his hand, does he not?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Does  he?&rsquo; I involuntarily whispered to myself; following the steady poise of her  head and the assured movements of her graceful form, with a glance of doubt,  but loving her all the same, O loving her all and ever the same!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your  father is not the man to cross you when the object of your affections is as  worthy as this gentleman. He loved your mother too fondly.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He  did?&rsquo; She had turned quick as a flash and was looking me straight in the eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I  never saw such union!&rsquo; I exclaimed, vaguely remembering that her mother&rsquo;s name  had always seemed to have power to move her. &lsquo;There was no parade of it before  the world; but here at their own fireside, it was heart to heart and soul to  soul. It was not love it was assimilation.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  young girl rose upon me like a flame; her very eyes seemed to dart fire; her  lips looked like living coals; she was almost appalling in her terrible beauty  and superhuman passion. &lsquo;Not love!&rsquo; she exclaimed, her every word falling like  a burning spark, &lsquo;not love but assimilation! Yet do you suppose if I told my  father that my soul had found its mate; my heart its other half; that this, <i>this</i> nature,&rsquo; here she struck her breast as she would a stone, &lsquo;had at last found  its master; that the wayward spirit of which you have sometimes been afraid,  was become a part of another&rsquo;s life, another&rsquo;s soul, another&rsquo;s hope, do you  suppose he would listen? Hush!&rsquo; she cried, seeing me about to speak. &lsquo;You talk  of love, what do you know of it, what does he know of it, who saw his young  wife die, yet himself consented to live? Is love a sitting by the fire with  hand locked in hand while the winter winds rage and the droning kettle sings?  Love is a going through the fire, a braving of the winter winds, a scattering  of the soul in sparks that the night and the tempest lick up without putting  out the germ of the eternal flame. Love!&rsquo; she half laughed; &lsquo;O, it takes a soul  that has never squandered its treasure upon every passing beggar, to know how  to love! Do you see that star?&rsquo; It was night as I have said and we were  standing near an open window. &lsquo;It has lost its moorings and is falling; when it  descries the ocean it will plunge into it; so with some natures, they soar high  and keep their orbit well, till an invisible hand turns them from their course  and they fall, to be swallowed up, aye swallowed up, lost and buried in the  great sea that has awaited them so long.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And  you love&mdash;like this&mdash;&rsquo; I murmured, quailing before the power of her passion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Would  it not be strange if I did not,&rsquo; she asked in an altered voice. &lsquo;You say he is  everything noble, handsome and attractive.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes,&rsquo; I murmured, &lsquo;but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  did not wait to hear what lay behind that but. Picking up her flowers, she  hastily crossed the room. &lsquo;Did my young mother shriek from joy, when my father&rsquo;s  horses ran away with them along that deadly precipice at the side of the  Southmore road? To lie for a few maddening moments on the breast of the man you  love, earth reeling beneath you, heaven swimming above you, and then with a cry  of bliss to fall heart to heart, down the hideous gap of some awful gulf, and  be dashed into eternity with the cry still on your lips, that is what I call  love and that is what I&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  paused, turned upon me the whole splendor of her face, seemed to realize to  what an extent her impetuosity had lifted the veil with which she usually  shrouded her bitterly suppressed nature, and calming herself with a sudden  quick movement, gave me a short mocking courtesy and left the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you wonder that for half the night I sat up brooding and alive to the faintest  sounds!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Next  day Mr. Holt called again, and a couple of weeks after&mdash;long enough to enable  Colonel Japha to make whatever inquiries he chose as to his claims as a  gentleman of means and position&mdash;sent a formal entreaty for Jacqueline&rsquo;s hand. I  had never seen Colonel Japha more moved. His admiration for the young man was  hearty and sincere. From a worldly point of view, as well as from all higher  standpoints, the match was one of which he could be proud; and yet to speak the  word that would separate from him the only creature that he loved, was hard as  the cutting off an arm or the plucking out of an eye. &lsquo;Do you think she loves  him?&rsquo; asked he of me with a rare condescension of which he was not often  guilty. &lsquo;You are a woman and ought to understand her better than I. Do you  think she loves him?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  the words I had heard her speak, what could I reply but, &lsquo;Yes, sir; she is of a  reserved nature and controls her feelings in his presence, but she loves him  for all that, with the intensest fervor and passion.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  repeated again, &lsquo;You are a woman and you ought to know.&rsquo; And then called his  daughter to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot tell what passed between them, but the upshot of it was, that the  Colonel despatched an answer to the effect that the father&rsquo;s consent would not  be lacking, provided the daughter&rsquo;s could be obtained. I learned this from  Jacqueline herself who brought me the letter to post.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You  see then, that your father understands,&rsquo; said I.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  rich red lip curled mockingly, but she did not reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naturally  Mr. Holt answered to this communication in person. Jacqueline received him with  a fitful coquetry that evidently puzzled him, for all the distinguishing charm  which it added to a beauty apt to be too reserved and statue-like. She however  took his ring which blazed on her finger like a drop of ice on congealed snow. &lsquo;I  am engaged,&rsquo; she murmured as she passed by my door, &lsquo;and to a Holt!&rsquo; The words  rang long in my ears; why?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  desired no congratulations; she permitted nothing to be said about her  engagement, among the neighbors. She had even taken off her ring which I found  lying loose in one of her bureau drawers. And no one dared to remonstrate, not  even her father, punctillious as he was in all matters of social etiquette. The  fact is, Jacqueline was not the same girl she had been before she gave her  promise to Mr. Holt. From the moment he bade her good-bye, with the remark that  he was going away to get a golden cage for his bride, she began to reveal a  change. The cold reserve gave way to feverish expectancy. She trod these rooms  as if there were burning steels in the floors, she looked from the windows as  if they were prison bars; night and day she gazed from them yet she never went  out. The letters she received from him were barely read and tossed aside; it  was his coming for which she hungered. Her father noticed her restless and  eager gaze, and frequently sighed. I felt her strange removed manner and  secretly wept. &lsquo;If he does not amply return this passion,&rsquo; thought I, &lsquo;my  darling will find her life a hell!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he did return it; of that I felt sure. It was my only comfort.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suddenly  one day the restlessness vanished. Her beauty burst like a flame from smoke;  she trod like a spirit that hears invisible airs. I watched her with amazement  till she said &lsquo;Mr. Holt comes to-night,&rsquo; then I thought all was explained and  went smiling about my work. She came down in the afternoon clad as I had never  seen her before. She wore one of her Boston dresses and she looked superb in  it. From the crown of her head to the sole of her foot, she dazzled like a  moving picture; but she lacked one adornment; there was no ring on her finger. &lsquo;Jacqueline!&rsquo;  cried I, &lsquo;you have forgotten something.&rsquo; And I pointed towards her hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  glanced at it, blushed a trifle as I thought, and pulled it out of her pocket. &lsquo;I  have it,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;but it is too large,&rsquo; and she thrust it carelessly back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  three o&rsquo;clock the train came in. Then I saw her eye flash and her lip burn. In  a few minutes later two gentlemen appeared at the gate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr.  Holt and his brother!&rsquo; were the words I heard whispered through the house. But  I did not need that announcement to understand Jacqueline at last.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_26"></a>Chapter 26<br>
    A Man&rsquo;s Justice And A Woman&rsquo;s Mercy</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Fair  is foul and foul is fair.&rdquo;&mdash;Macbeth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you ever seen a man whose instantaneous effect upon you was electrical; in  whose expression, carriage, or manner, there was concealed a charm that  attracted and interested you, apart from his actual worth and beauty? Such a one  was Mr. Roger Holt, the gentleman I now discerned entering the gate with  Jacqueline&rsquo;s lover. It was not that he was handsome. He could not for one  moment bear any comparison with his brother in substantial attraction, and yet  when they were both in the room, you looked at him in preference to the other,  and was vexed with yourself for doing so. He seemed to be the younger as he was  certainly the smaller; yet he took the lead, even in coming up the walk. Why  had he not taken it in the deeper and more important matter? Was it because he  did not love her?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was not present when Jacqueline greeted her guests and presented Mr. Roger Holt  to her father. But later in the day I spent a half hour with them and saw  enough to be able to satisfy myself as to the falsity of my last supposition.  Never had I seen on a human countenance the evidences of a wilder passion than  that which informed his features, as he sat in the further window of the  parlor, presumably engaged in admiring the autumn landscape, but really occupied  in casting short side-long glances at Jacqueline, who sat listening with a  superb nonchalence, but with a restless gleam in her wandering eye, to the  genial talk between her acknowledged lover and the Colonel. I half feared he  would rise from his seat, and flinging himself before her, demand then and  there an explanation of her engagement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  beyond the impatience of those short burning glances, he controlled himself  well, and it was Jacqueline who moved at last.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw the purpose growing in her eyes long before she stirred. The face which had  been a mystery to me from her cradle, was in the presence of this man, like an  open page which all might read. Its letters were flame, but that did not make  them any less clear. I felt her swaying towards him, before an eyelash trembled  or a quiver shook her tall form.</p>
  <p>He  may have understood her purpose also, for his eye wandered towards the open  piano. She rose like a queen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr.  Roger Holt is a singer,&rsquo; said she in passing her father, &lsquo;I am going to ask him  to give us one of the old ballads you profess to like so much.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  conversation at once ceased. The Colonel who made no secret of his fondness for  music, turned at once towards the stranger, with an expression of great  courtesy. Instantly that gentleman rose, and meeting the request of his hostess  with a profound bow, proceeded at once to the piano. &lsquo;He will not leave it till  he has spoken to her,&rsquo; thought I. Nor did he, for that very moment as they  stood turning her music over, I perceived his lips move in a hurried question,  to which she as briefly responded, whereupon he caught up a sheet of music from  the pile, and flinging back his head with a victorious smile, began to sing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  I known what lay behind his words, I would have braved everything rather than  have allowed him to utter a note in that room which had once rung with the  carols of Jacqueline&rsquo;s mother. But what could I guess of the possible evil  underlying the natural ebullition of unrestrained passion that from some cause  of pride or pique, had met with a strange inexplicable check. So I sat still,  shuddering perhaps, but quiet in my corner; while the haunting tones of his  strange and thrilling voice, rose and fell in the most uncanny of Scottish love  songs. Nor did I do more than wonder with all my agitated soul, when at the  conclusion Jacqueline came back, and pausing beside the man to whom she had  given her troth, looked down in his beaming face and smiled with that overflow  of delight, which she dared not bestow upon his brother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another  little incident of that hour remains engraven upon my memory. She had been  showing to the gentlemen a rare plant that stood in the front parlor window,  and was dilating upon its marvels, when Mr. Robert Holt, her accepted lover,  took in his clasp the small white hand wandering so invitingly among the leaves  of the huge palm, and glancing at the finger which should have worn his ring,  looked inquiringly into her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O,&rsquo;  said she, interrupting her little speech to draw away her hand, &lsquo;you miss your  diamond? I have it, sir. It lies very safe in my pocket; it is a beautiful gem,  but <i>your ring does not fit me</i>.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  way she said those words and the air with which she tossed back her head, must  have made one heart in that room beat joyously, but it did not reassure me or  subdue my secret apprehension.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not  fit!&rsquo; her lover responded; and begged her to allow him to try it on and see,  but she shook her head with wilful coquetry, and turning to the piano,  commenced singing a gay little song that was like silver bells, shaken by a  sudden and mighty tempest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even  the Colonel felt the change in his daughter, though he never guessed the cause,  and came and went during the evening that followed, with certain odd sighs that  made my heart ache with strange forebodings. Only her lover was unconscious, or  if he felt the new and wayward force and fire in her manner, attributed it to  his own presence and unspeakable devotion. Mr. Roger Holt, on the contrary,  thoroughly understood it. Though he was strangely calm, as calm now as he had  previously been alert and fiery, he never lost a gleam of her eye in his  direction, or a turn of her form towards the chair where he sat. But the smile  with which he contemplated her was not pleasant to me. It was informed with  self-consciousness, and a certain hard triumph, that made it almost sinister. &lsquo;She  has given her hand to the true man,&rsquo; I mused, &lsquo;wherever her heart may be. But  had she given it?&rsquo; I began to doubt as I began to muse. With that  uncontrollable will of hers, she was capable of anything; did she intend to  break with Robert, now that she had seen Roger? I detected no signs of it  beyond the evident delight they took in each other&rsquo;s presence. They were guilty  of no further conversation of a secret or intimate character, and when with the  striking of the clock at ten, Mr. Robert Holt rose to leave, his brother  followed without any demur, even preceding him in his departure and limiting  his farewell to a short brotherly pressure of Jacqueline&rsquo;s fair hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  much may be conveyed in a pressure, or so I began to think as I heard the low  laugh that rippled from Jacqueline&rsquo;s lips as she turned to go up to her room;  and if I had been her mother&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  that is not what you want to hear. Enough that I did not follow her, that I did  not even acquaint Colonel Japha with my fears, that indeed I did nothing but  lie awake, praying and asking what I ought to do. There had been so little  said; there had been so little done. A word, a sentence between them, the  interchange of a couple of songs, and&mdash;What else that I could communicate to  another?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  week, two weeks passed, and her look of wilful happiness did not fly. She was  flooded with notes from her accepted lover, whose handwriting I had learned by  this time to distinguish, but not one, so far as I could learn, from any other  source; yet her feet tripped lightly through the house, and her form had a rich  grace in its every movement, that bespoke a mind settled in some deep joy or  quiet determination. I felt the impenetrability of a secretly cherished hope,  whenever I looked at her. If I had not known to the contrary, I should have  said that her prospective marriage had become to her a dream of unfathomable  delight. Whence then came this rapture? Through what communication was born  this secret hope? I could not guess, I could only watch and wait.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meanwhile  some random guesses at the truth had been made by the neighbors. Jacqueline had  a lover. That lover was a gentleman; but the Colonel was critical; he had  refused his consent and the young people had parted. Such was the talk,  begotten perhaps by the persistency with which Jacqueline remained in the  house, and the almost severe look with which Colonel Japha trod the streets of  his native village, which he soon felt would lose all their charm in the departure  of his only child. I scarcely ventured out more than Jacqueline; for I have but  little control over my feelings and did not know what I would do, if any one  should closely press me with questions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  unexpected discovery that our pretty young servant girl was in the habit of  stealing into Jacqueline&rsquo;s room late at night, was the first thing that  startled me into asking whether or not my supposition was true, that Jacqueline  received no messages from Mr. Robert Holt. And scarcely had I become certain  that a clandestine correspondence was being carried on between them through the  medium of this girl, then the climax came, and knowledge on my part and secrecy  on hers availed no longer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was a day in October. The stoves had been put up in the house, and seeing  Jacqueline roaming about the halls, in a renewed fit of that strange  restlessness which had affected her the day before Mr. Roger Holt&rsquo;s visit, I  went into her room to light a fire, and make everything look cheerful before  dusk. I found the atmosphere warm, and going to the stove, discovered that a  fire had been already kindled there, but had gone out for want of fuel. I at  once commenced to rake away the ashes, in order to make preparations for a new  one, when I came upon several scraps of half burned paper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jacqueline  had been burning letters. Do you blame me for picking out those scraps and  hastening with them to another room, when I tell you they were written in a  marked and characteristic hand that bore little or no resemblance to that of her  accepted lover, and that the words which flashed first upon my eye were those  ominous ones of <i>my wife</i>!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  were three in number, and while more or less discolored and irregular, were  still legible. Think child with what a thrill of horror and sharp motherly  anguish, I read such words as &lsquo;Love you! I would press you in my arms if you  were plague-stricken! The least turn of your head makes my blood cringe, as if  a flame had touched me. I would follow you on my knees, if you led me round the  world. Let me see Robert take your hand again and I will&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Forget  you! Do we forget the dagger that has struck us? I am another man since&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I  will have you if Robert goes mad and your father kills me. That I am burdened  with a wife, is nothing. What is a wife that I do not&mdash;&rsquo; &lsquo;You shall be my true  wife, my&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To-night  then, be ready; I will wait for you at the gate. A little resolution on your  part, and then&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  could read no further. The living, burning truth had forced itself upon me,  that Jacqueline, our darling, our pride, the soul of our life, stood tottering  upon the brink of a gulf horrible as the mouth of hell. For I never doubted for  an instant what her answer would be to this entreaty. In all her past life, God  pity us, there had been no tokens of that immovable hold on virtue, that would  save her in such an extremity as this. Nevertheless, to make all sure, I flew  back to her room, and tearing open bureau drawers and closet doors, discovered  that her prettiest things had been sent away. She was going, then, and on that  very night! and her father did not even know she was untrue to her betrothed  lover. The horror of the situation was too much for me; I faltered as I left  her room, her dainty, maidenly room, and actually crouched against the wall  like a guilty thing, as I heard the sound of her voice singing some maddening  strain in the parlors below. What should I do? Appeal to her, or warn her  father of the frightful peril in which his honor and happiness stood? Alas, any  appeal to her would be useless. In the glare of this awful revelation I had  come to a full comprehension of her nature. But her father was a man; he could  command as well as entreat, could even force obedience if all other methods  failed. To him, then, must I go; but I had rather have gone to the rack. He was  so proud a man! Had owned to such undeviating trust in his daughter&rsquo;s honor, as  a Japha and his child! The blow would kill him; or daze him so, he might better  have been killed. My knees shook under me, as I traversed the hall to his little  study over the parlor, and when I came to the door, I rather fell against it  than knocked, so great was my own anguish, and so deep my terror of his. He was  a ready man and he came to the door at once, but upon seeing me, drew back as  if his eye had fallen upon a phantom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hush!&rsquo;  said I, scarcely knowing what I uttered; and going in, I closed the door and  latched it firmly behind me. &lsquo;I have come,&rsquo; said I in a voice that made him  start, &lsquo;to ask you to save your daughter. She is in deadly peril; she&mdash;&rsquo; a strain  of her song came in at that moment from the staircase. She was ascending to her  room. He looked at me in a doubt of my sanity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not  physical peril,&rsquo; I stammered, &lsquo;but <i>moral</i>. She loves madly, unreasonably,  and with a headlong passion that laughs at every obstacle, a man whom neither  you nor heaven can look upon with aught but execration. She&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mrs.  Hamlin!&rsquo;&mdash;How well I remember his cool, calm voice, so deliberate in his  impressive moments, so deliberate now, when perhaps she was donning hat and  shawl for her elopement&mdash;&rsquo;You are laboring under a great mistake. Instead of  execrating Mr. Holt, I admire him most profoundly. Since the time has come for  me to give up my daughter, I know of no one to whom I would rather surrender  her.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But  Mr. Holt is not the man,&rsquo; I cried, half wild in my fear and desperation. &lsquo;Do  you remember the gentleman who came with him on his last visit? He called him  his brother, and he is I believe, but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  way he turned his grand white forehead towards me at that, made every fibre in  my being quiver. &lsquo;Jacqueline does not love <i>him</i>!&rsquo; exclaimed he. How sharp  his voice, how changed his eye! I shrank back, trembling as I bowed my head,  thinking of the word yet to be said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But  he won&rsquo;t compare&mdash;&rsquo; he went on with a severe intonation. &lsquo;Besides her honor is  engaged. You are dealing in fancies, Mrs. Hamlin.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  tore out of my breast the scraps of paper which had enlightened me so horribly,  and held them towards him; then bethought myself, and drew back. &lsquo;I have proof,&rsquo;  said I; &lsquo;but first I must tell you that Jacqueline is not as good a girl as you  have thought her. She is not her mother&rsquo;s child in the qualities of love and  honor. She is destined to bring a great woe upon your head. In her passion for  this man, she has forgotten your trust in her, the incorruptibility of your  name, the honor of your house. Be strong, sir, for God is about to smite you in  your tenderest spot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  with what pride he towered upon me! this white-haired, stately gentleman before  whom I had hitherto held my breath in admiring awe; towered upon me though his  face was ghostly pale and his hand trembled like an aspen as he held it out!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Give  me the papers you hold there,&rsquo; cried he. &lsquo;Either you are gone mad, or else&mdash;Who  wrote these lines?&rsquo; he demanded, glancing down upon the hard, firm scrawl that  blackened the bits of paper I had given him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr.  Roger Holt,&rsquo; I returned unhesitatingly. &lsquo;I found those bits in Jacqueline&rsquo;s  stove. Her clothes have been sent away, sir,&rsquo; I continued as I saw his face  grow fixed above the scraps he consulted. &lsquo;Twilight is coming on and&mdash;Mr. Roger  Holt is a married man!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never saw such a look flash from a human face as that which darted from his at  that terrible moment. I thought he would have fallen, but he only dropped the  papers out of his hand. &lsquo;Heaven forgive us!&rsquo; murmured I, calmed by a sight of  his misery, into some semblance of of self-control, &lsquo;but we have never  understood Jacqueline. She is not to be led, sir, by principles or duty. She  loves this man, and love with her is a stormy wind, capable of sweeping her  into any abyss of contumely or suffering. If you would save her, kill her love;  the death of her lover would only transform her into a demon.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  looked at me as if I had told him the world had come to an end. &lsquo;My Jacqueline!&rsquo;  he murmured in a low, incredulous voice of the tenderest yearning. &lsquo;My  Jacqueline!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo;  I shrieked, torn by my anguish for him and the terror of her escaping while we  were yet talking, &lsquo;God knows I had rather have died than contaminate her by  such words as I have uttered. She is dear to me as my soul; dearer to me than  my life. I have a mother&rsquo;s feeling for her, sir. If to fling myself headlong  from that window, would delay her feet from going down the stairs to meet her  guilty lover, I would gladly do it. It is her danger makes me speak. O sir,  realize that danger and hasten before she has taken the irrevocable step.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  started like a man pricked by a sudden dart. &lsquo;She is going&mdash;you believe she is  going to meet him?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I  do,&rsquo; said I.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  gave me a terrible look and started for the door. I hurriedly picked up the  scraps that had fallen to the floor, and rushed around by an inner passage-way  to my own little room, hiding my head and waiting as for the crash of a falling  avalanche. Suddenly a cry rose in the hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are some sounds that lift you unconsciously to your feet. Dashing out of my  room, I detected the face of the servant-girl whom I have before mentioned,  looking out of her door some distance down the corridor. Hastening towards her,  I uttered some words about her being a busy-body, and thrusting her inside her  room, locked the door upon her. Then I hastened with what speed I might to the  front of the house, and coming out upon the grand staircase, met a sight that  shook me to the very soul. You have been up the stairs; you know how they  branch off to left and right from the platform near the top. The left branch  led in those days to Colonel Japha&rsquo;s room, the right to the apartments occupied  by Jacqueline and myself. Coming upon them, then, as I did from my side of the  house, I found myself in full view of the opposite approach, and there on the  topmost step I beheld Colonel Japha, standing in an attitude of awful  denunciation, while half way down the staircase, I beheld the figure of  Jacqueline, hindered in her gliding course towards the front door by the  terrible, &lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; whose echo had reached me in my room and caused me to rush  quaking and horrified to this spot. I leaned back sick and horror-stricken  against the wall. There was no mercy in his voice: he had awakened to a full  realization of the situation and the pride of the Japhas had made him steel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You  are my child!&rsquo; he was saying. &lsquo;I have loved you and do still; but proceed one  step farther towards the man that awaits you at the gate, and the door that  opens upon you, <i>shuts</i> never to open again!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Colonel!&rsquo;  I exclaimed, starting forward; but he heard me no more than he would a fly  buzzing or a bird singing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I  desire it to shut; I have no wish to come back!&rsquo; issued from the set white lips  of the girl beneath us. &lsquo;There is no such charm for me in this humdrum house,  that I should wish to exchange life with the man I adore, for its droning,  spiritless existence!&rsquo; And she lifted her foot to proceed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jacqueline!&rsquo;  I shrieked, leaning forward in my turn, and holding her by my anguish, as I  never believed she could be held by anything, &lsquo;Think, child, think what you do!  It is not life you are going to but death. A man who can take a young girl from  her father&rsquo;s house, from her lover&rsquo;s arms, from her mother&rsquo;s grave, from the  shrine of all that is pure and holy, to dash her into a pit of all that is  corrupt, loathsome and deadly, is not one with whom you can <i>live</i>. You  say you adore him: can one adore falsehood, selfishness and depravity? Does  hypocrisy win love? Can the embraces of a serpent bring peace? Jacqueline,  Jacqueline, you are yet pure; come back to our love and our hearts, before we  die here in our shame at the head of the stairs, where your mother was carried  out to her grave!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  trembled. I saw the hand that clutched the banister loosen its grip; she cast  one quick look behind her, and her eyes flashed upon her father&rsquo;s face; it was  set like a flint.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If  you come back,&rsquo; cried he, leaning towards her, but not advancing a step from  where he stood, &lsquo;you must come back of your own free will. I will hold no  creature prisoner in my house. I must trust you implicitly, or not at all.  Speak then, which shall it be?&rsquo; And he raised his hand above his head, with a  supreme and awful gesture, &lsquo;a father&rsquo;s blessing or a father&rsquo;s curse?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A  father&rsquo;s curse, then! since you command me to choose,&rsquo; rang out from her lips  in a burst of uncontrollable passion. &lsquo;I want no blessing that separates me  from <i>him</i>!&rsquo; And she pointed towards the door with a look that, defiant as  it was, spoke of a terrible love before which all our warnings and entreaties  were but as empty air.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Curses  then upon your head, slayer of a family&rsquo;s honor, a father&rsquo;s love, and a mother&rsquo;s  memory! Curses upon you, at home and abroad! in the joy of your first passion  and in the agony of your last despair! May you live to look upon that door as  the gateway to heaven, and find it shut! May your children, if you are cursed  with them, turn in your face, as you are turning now in mine! May the lightning  of heaven be your candle, and the blackness of death your daily food and your  nightly drink!&rsquo; And with a look in which all the terrors he invoked, seemed to  crash downward from his reeling brain upon her shrinking terror-crouched head,  he gave one mighty gasp and fell back stricken to the floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;God!&rsquo;  burst from her lips, and she rushed downwards to the door like a creature  hunted to its quarry. I saw her white face gleam marble-like in the fading  light that came in from the chinks about the door. I saw her trembling hand  fumbling with the knob, and rousing from my stupor, called down to her with all  the force of a breaking heart,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jacqueline,  beware!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  turned once more. There was something in my voice she could not withstand. &lsquo;I  do not hope to keep you,&rsquo; cried I, &lsquo;but before you go, hear this. In the days  to come, when the face that now beams upon you with such longing, shall have  learned to turn from you in weariness, if not distaste, when hunger, cold,  contumely and disease shall have blasted that fair brow and seared those soft  cheeks, know, that although a father can curse, a woman who loves like a mother  can forgive. The father cries, &lsquo;Once go out of that door and it shuts upon you  never to open!&rsquo; &lsquo;Once come to <i>that</i> door, say I,&rsquo; pointing in the  direction of the house&rsquo;s other entrance, &lsquo;and if I live and if I move, it shall  open to you, were you as defiled and wretched and forsaken as Magdalen.  Remember! Each day at this hour will I watch for you, kneeling upon its  threshold. In sickness or in health, in joy or in sorrow, in cold or in heat.  The hour of six is sacred. Some one of them shall see you falling weeping on my  breast!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  gave me a quick stare out of her wide black eyes, then a mocking smile curled  her lips, and murmuring a short, &lsquo;You rave!&rsquo; opened the door, and rushed out  into the falling dusk. With a resounding clang like the noise of a stone rolled  upon an open grave, the great door swung to, and I was left alone in that  desolated house with my stricken master.</p>

    The Lone Watcher</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Hark!  to the hurried question of Despair, <br>
  Where is my child?&mdash;and Echo answers&mdash;Where?&rdquo;&mdash;Byron. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Colonel  Japha recovered from his shock, but was never the same man again. All that was  genial, affectionate and confiding in his nature, had been turned as by a  lightning&rsquo;s stroke, to all that was hard, bitter and suspicious. He would not  allow the name of Jacqueline to be spoken in his presence; he would listen to  no allusion made to those days when she was the care and perplexity, but also  the light and pleasure of the house. Men are not like women, my child; when  they turn, it is at an angle, the whole direction of their nature changes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  the news that presently came to us from Boston may have had something to do  with this. It was surely dreadful enough; Jacqueline&rsquo;s perfidy had slain her  lover. Mr. Robert Holt, the cultured, noble, high-souled gentleman, had been  found lying dead on the floor of his room, a few days after the events I have  just related, with a lady&rsquo;s diamond ring in his hand and the remnants of a  hastily burned letter in the grate before him. He had burst a blood-vessel, and  had expired instantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  sudden and tragic ending of a man of energy and will, was also the reason,  perhaps, why Grotewell never arrived at the truth of Jacqueline&rsquo;s history.  Boston was a long way from here in those days, and the story of her lover&rsquo;s  death was not generally known, while the fact of her elopement was.  Consequently she was supposed to have fled with the man who had been seen to  visit her most frequently; a report which neither the Colonel nor myself had  the courage to deny.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  child, you have a brow like snow, and a cheek like roses; you know little of  life&rsquo;s sorrows and little of life&rsquo;s sins. To you the skies are blue, the woods  vernal, the air balmy; the sad looks upon men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s faces, tell but  shallow tales of the ceaseless grinding of grief in their pent up souls. But  you are gentle, and you have an imagination that goes beyond your experience;  perhaps if you pause and think, you can understand what a tale could be told of  the weeks and months and years that now followed, without hint or whisper of  the fate of her who had gone out from amongst us with the brand of her father&rsquo;s  curse upon her brow. At first we hoped, yes, <i>he</i> hoped,&mdash;I could see it in  his eyes when there came a sudden ring at the bell,&mdash;that some sign of her  penitence, or some proof of her existence, would come to relieve the torture of  our fears, if not the shame of our memories. But the door that closed upon her  on that fatal eve, had shut without an echo. While we vainly waited, time had  ample leisure to carve the furrows of age as well as of suffering on the  Colonel&rsquo;s once smooth brow, and to change my daily vigil into a custom of  despair, rather than of hope. Time had also leisure to rob us of much of our  worldly goods and to make our continued living in this grand old house, an act  that involved constant care and the closest economy. That we were enabled to  preserve appearances to the day that beheld the Colonel laid low by the final  stroke of his dread disease, was only due to the secret charity of a certain  gentleman, who, declaring he was indebted to us, secretly supplied me with  means of support.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  of all this you care little.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  had rather hear about the evening watch with its hopeful assurance, &lsquo;Yet  another day and she will be here,&rsquo; to be followed so soon by the despairing  acknowledgement, &lsquo;Yet another day and she has not come!&rsquo; or of those dark hours  when the Colonel lay blank and white upon his pillow, with his eyes fixed on  the door which would never open to the beating of a daughter&rsquo;s heart, while the  gray shadow of an awful resolution deepened upon his immovable face. What that  resolution was I could not know, but I feared it, when I saw what a sternness  it gave to his eye, what a fixedness to his set and implacable lip; and when in  the waning light of a certain December afternoon, the circle of neighbors about  his bed gave way to the stiff and forbidding form of Mr. Phelps, I felt a thrill  of mortal apprehension and only waited to hear the short, &lsquo;It shall be done,&rsquo;  of the lawyer to some slowly whispered command of the colonel, to rise from my  far off corner and stand ready to accost Mr. Phelps as he came from the bedside  of the dying man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What  is it?&rsquo; I asked, rushing up to him as he issued forth into the hall, and  seizing him by the arm, with a woman&rsquo;s unreasoning impetuosity. &lsquo;I have nursed  his daughter on my knee; tell me, then, what it is he has ordered you to do in  this final moment?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Phelps for all his ungainly bearing, is not a hard-hearted man, as you know,  and he doubtless saw the depth of the misery that made me forget myself. Giving  me a look that was not without its touch of sarcasm, he replied, &lsquo;The colonel  has made me promise, to see that a plank is nailed across the front door of  this house, after his body has been carried out to burial.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  board across the front door! His anger then was implacable. The withering curse  that had rung in my ears for ten years, was to outlive his death! With a  horrified groan, I pressed my hands over my eyes and rushed back. My first  glimpse of the Colonel&rsquo;s face showed me that the end was at hand, but that fact  only made more imperative my consuming desire to see that curse removed, even though  it were done with his final breath. Drawing near his bedside, I leaned down,  and waiting till his eye wandered to my face, asked him if there was nothing he  wished amended before his strength failed. He understood me. We had not sat for  so long, face to face across the chasm of a hideous memory, without knowing  something of the workings of each other&rsquo;s mind. Glancing up at his wife&rsquo;s  portrait which ever faced him as he lay upon his pillow, his mouth grew severe  and he essayed to shake his head. I at once pointed to the portrait.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What  will you say to her when she meets you on the borders of heaven?&rsquo; I demanded  with the courage of despair.&rsquo; She will ask, &lsquo;Where is my child?&rsquo; And what will  you reply?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  fingers that lay upon the coverlid moved spasmodically; he eyed me with a  steady deepening stare, awful to meet, fearful to remember. I went on steadily;  &lsquo;She has gone out of this house with your curse; tell me that if she comes  back, she may be greeted with your forgiveness.&rsquo; Still that awful stare which  changed not. &lsquo;I have watched and waited for her every day since her departure,&rsquo;  I whispered, &lsquo;and shall watch and wait for her, every day until I die. Shall a  stranger&rsquo;s love be greater than a father&rsquo;s?&rsquo; This time his lips twitched and  the grey shadow shifted, but it did not rise. &lsquo;I had sworn to do it,&rsquo; I went  on. &lsquo;When you lay there at the top of the stairs, smitten down by your first  shock, I told her, come sickness, come health, I should keep a daily vigil at  that door of the house which your severity had not closed upon her; and I have  kept my word till now and shall keep it to the end. What will you do for this  miserable child of whose being you are the author?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  indescribable anxiety I paused and watched him, for his lips were moving. &lsquo;Do  for her?&rsquo; he repeated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  awful is the voice of the dying! I shivered as I listened, but drew near and  nearer, that I might lose no word that came from his stony lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She  will not come,&rsquo; gasped he, with an effort that raised him up in bed, and  deepened that horrible stare, &lsquo;but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  shall say what he might have uttered if Death&rsquo;s hand had delayed a single  instant, but the inexorable shadow fell, and he never finished the sentence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  child, these are frightful things for you to hear. God knows I would not assail  your pure ears with a tale like this, if it were not for the help and sympathy  I hope to gain from you. Sin is a hideous thing; the gulf it opens is wide and  deep; well may it be said to swallow those who trust themselves above its  flower-hung brink. But we who are human, owe something to humanity. Love stops  not because of the gulf; love follows the sinner with wilder and more  heart-breaking longing, the deeper and deeper he sinks into the illimitable  darkness. Ten years have passed since we laid the Colonel away in the  burying-place of all the Japhas, and dutiful to his last request, nailed up the  front door of his speedily to be forsaken mansion. In all that time my watch  has remained unbroken in this house, which by will he had left to me, but which  I secretly hold in trust for her. The hour of six has found me at my post,  sometimes elate with hope, sometimes depressed with repeated disappointments,  but whether hopeful or sad, always trustful that the great God who Himself so  loved all sinners, that He gave the life of His Son to rescue them, would  ultimately grant me the desire of my heart. But the decrepitude of age is  coming upon me, and each morning I leave my bed, with growing fear lest my  infirmities will increase until they finally overcome my resolution. Child, if  this should happen, if lying in my bed I should some day hear that she had come  back, and failing to find the lamp burning and the welcome ready, had gone away  again&mdash;But the thought is madness. I cannot bear it. A sinner, lost, degraded,  suffering, starving, perhaps, is wandering this way. She is hardened and old in  guilt; she has drunk the cup of life&rsquo;s passions and found them corrupting  poison; all that was lovely and pure and good has withdrawn from her; she  stands alone, shut off by her sin, like a wild thing in a circle of flame. What  shall touch this soul? The preacher&rsquo;s voice has no charm for her; good men&rsquo;s  advice is but empty air. God&rsquo;s love must be mirrored in human love, to strike  an eye so unused to looking up. Where shall she find such love? It is all that  can rescue her; love as great as her sin, as boundless as her degradation, as  persistent as her suffering. Child&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know what you are going to say,&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Paula, rising up and  confronting Mrs. Hamlin with a steady high look of determination. &ldquo;In the day  of your weakness or illness you want some one to unlock the door and light the  lamp. You have found her!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_28"></a>Chapter 28<br>
    Sunshine On The Hills</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;If  I speak to thee in Friendship&rsquo;s name, <br>
  Thou think&rsquo;st I speak too coldly; <br>
  If I  mention Love&rsquo;s devoted flame, <br>
  Thou say&rsquo;st I speak too boldly.&rdquo;&mdash;Moore. </p>
  <p>The  story told by Mrs. Hamlin had a great effect upon Paula, not only on account of  its own interest and the promise it had elicited from her, but because of the  remembrances it revived of Mr. Sylvester and her life in New York. Any vision  of evil or suffering, any experience that roused the affections or awakened the  sensibilities, could not fail to recall to her mind the forcible figure of Mr.  Sylvester as he stood that day by his own hearthstone, talking of the  temptations that assail humanity; and any reminiscence of him must necessarily  bring with it much that charmed and aroused. For a week, then, she felt the  effect of a great unsettlement. Her village home appeared a prison; she longed  to run, soar&mdash;anything to escape; the horizon was full of beckoning hands. A  brooding melancholy settled upon her reveries; the prospect of a life spent in  the narrow circle to which she had endeavored to re-accustom herself, became unendurable.</p>
  <p>Thus  it is with us. We slide in a groove and seem happy, when suddenly a book we  read, a story we hear, an experience we encounter, shakes us out of our  content, and makes continuance in the old course a violation of the most  demanding instincts of our nature.</p>
  <p>In  the full tide of this unrest, Paula went out for a solitary walk on the hills.  Nature can soothe if she cannot satisfy. Then the day itself was one to make  the soul glad and the heart rejoice. As the young girl trod the meadows, she wondered  that she could be sad. Earth and air were so full of splendor. Nature seemed to  be in league with the angels of light. September stood upon the earth like a  goddess of might and glory. Every tint of green that variegated the  mountain-side, wooed the eye with suggestions of unfathomable beauty. A bough  of scarlet flame lit here and there amid the verdure, served to illuminate the  woods as for the passage of a king; and not Solomon in all his glory ever wore  an aspect more sumptuous than the flowers that flecked the meadow and fringed  the hardy roadside with imperial purple. A wind was blowing, a keen but kindly  breeze, laden with sweetness and alert to awaken &AElig;olian airs from the boughs of  whistling beech and alder. Even the low field grasses seemed to partake in the  general cheer, and nodded to each other with a witching and irresistible  abandon. Had a poet been at her side, or any one capable of divining the hidden  things of nature, what a commentary to all their united thoughts she would have  found in the delicious tremble of the laughing leaves, in the restless music of  the runaway brooks, in the lowly crickets with their single song, in the  cloud-haunting birds with their trailing melodies, and in all the roll and  rumble of earth&rsquo;s commingled noises. Alluring as was the book of nature, she  could not read it alone. She felt the lack of a loving hand to turn the page. &ldquo;Is  it that I am lonely!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>The  thought deepened her trouble. Coming down from the hillside, she entered a  skirting of woods that ran along by the river. Here she had always found peace  and some of her richest treasures of thought. Through this opaline archway she  had walked with her fancies, like Saint Catherine with her lily. It was sacred  to all that was sweet and deep and pure within her. &ldquo;Lonely!&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;I  will not be lonely. To some God gives years of happy companionship; to others  but a day. Shall one complain because it has fallen to his portion to have the  lesser share? I will remember my one day and be glad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  one day!&rdquo; She caught herself at the utterance and literally started at the  suggestion it offered. There was but one person whom she had seen but for a  day. Could she have been thinking of him?</p>
  <p>With  a flush deep as the autumn leaves she carried, she was hurrying on, when  suddenly in the opening before her, a shadow fell, and a mellow voice exclaimed  in her ear,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  I meet Miss Fairchild in her native woods?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was Clarence Ensign.</p>
  <p>The  surprise was very great and it took her a moment to steady herself. She had  felt so assured that she should never see him or any other of her New York  friends again. Had not Cicely written that he had gone West, soon after her own  departure from New York. With a deepening of his voice Mr. Ensign repeated the  question.</p>
  <p>At  once the day seemed to acquire all it had hitherto lacked. Looking up, she met  his eye fixed admiringly upon her, and all that was merry, lightsome and gay  within her, leaped at once to the surface. Ignoring his question with smiling  abandon, she exclaimed,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  shall be done to the man who delights in surprises and startles timid maidens  without a cause?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  shall be held in captivity by the hand of his denouncer, until he has sued for  pardon and obtained her generous forgiveness,&rdquo; returned he, holding out his  palm.</p>
  <p>She  barely touched it with her own. &ldquo;I see that your repentance is sincere, so your  pardon shall be speedy,&rdquo; laughed she.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  discrimination is at fault, I never felt more impenitent in my life. I am a  hardened wretch, Miss Fairchild, a hardened wretch! But you do not ask me from  what corner of the earth I have come. You take me too much for granted; like  the chirrup of a squirrel, let me say, or the whistle of a bullfinch. But  perhaps you think I inhabit these woods?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  but a day like this is so full of miracles, why should we be astonished at one  more! I suppose you came on the train, but should not be surprised to hear you  started, like Pluto, from the earth. Anything seems possible in such a  sunshine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are right, and I have sprung from the earth. I have been buried five mortal  months in a law-suit out west, or else I should have been here before. I hope  my delay has made me none the less welcome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was holding back a branch as he spoke, and his eyes were on a level with hers.  She felt caught as in a net, and struggled vainly to keep down her color. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said she, &ldquo;welcome is a guest&rsquo;s due, whether he come early or late. I should be  sorry to be lacking in the duties of a hostess, though my drawing-room is  somewhat more spacious than cosy,&rdquo; she continued, looking around on the fields  into which they had emerged, &ldquo;and my facilities for bespeaking you welcome  greater than my power to make you comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Comfort  is a satisfaction of the mind, rather than of the body. I am not <i>un</i>comfortable,  Miss Fairchild.&rdquo; Then as he stooped to relieve her of half her burden of  trailing leaves and flowers, he exclaimed in a matter-of-fact tone, &ldquo;Your aunt  is a notable woman, Miss Fairchild, I admire her greatly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;  said she, &ldquo;you have been to the cottage? You have seen Aunt Belinda?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; laughed he, &ldquo;or how should I be here? You have been sent for, Miss  Fairchild, and I am the humble bearer of your aunt&rsquo;s commands. But I forget,  the practical has nothing to do with such a day. I am supposed to have sprung  from the ground, and to know by instinct, just in what nook you were hiding  from the sunlight. Very well. I acknowledge that instinct is sometimes capable  of going a great way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  this time her ready answer was lacking. She was wondering what her aunt would  think of this sudden appearance of a stranger whose name she had never so much  as mentioned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a pleasant rest to stand and look at a view like that, after a summer of  musty labor,&rdquo; said he, gazing up the river with a truly appreciative eye. &ldquo;I do  not wonder you carry the charm of the wild woods in your laugh and glance, if  you have been brought up in the sight of such a view as that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  has been my meat and drink from childhood,&rdquo; said she, and wondered why she  wanted to say no more upon her favorite theme.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  you tell me you love the city?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too  much to ever again be happy here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was a slip for which her cheek burned and her lids fell, the moment after. She  had been thinking of Mr. Sylvester, and unconsciously spake as she might have  done, if he had been at her side, instead of this genial-hearted young man.  With a woman&rsquo;s instinctive desire to retrieve herself, she hurriedly continued,  &ldquo;Life is so full and large and deep in a great town, if you are only happy  enough to meet those who are its blood and brain and sinew. One misses the rush  of the great wheel of time in a spot like this. The world moves, but we do not  feel it; it is like the quiet sweep of the stars over our heads. But in the  city, days, weeks and months make themselves felt. The universe jars under the  feet of hurrying masses. The story of the world is being written on pavement,  corridor, and dome, so that he who runs may read. One realizes he is alive; the  unit is part of the multiple. To those who are tired, God gives the rest of the  everlasting hills, but to those who are eager, he holds out the city with its  innumerable opportunities and incentives. And I am eager,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The  flower blooms on the mountain, and its perfume is sweet, but the chariot sings  as it rushes, and the noise of its wheels is music in my ears.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  paused, turned her face to the breeze, and seemed to forget she was not alone.  Clarence Ensign eyed her with astonishment; he had never heard her speak like  this; the earnest side of her great nature had never been turned towards him  before, and he felt himself shrink into insignificance in its presence. What  was he that he should pluck a star from the heavens, to buckle on his breast!  Wealth and position were a match for beauty great as hers, and a kind heart  current coin all the world over, for a gentle disposition and a loving nature;  but for this&mdash;He turned away and in his abstraction switched his foot with his  cane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  it was in New York that I met Cicely,&rdquo; exclaimed Paula.</p>
  <p>He  shook off his broodings, turned with a manful gesture, and met her sweet  unfathomable eye, so brilliant with enthusiasm a moment ago, but at this  instant so softly deep and tender.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the friendship of Miss Stuyvesant is a precious thing to you?&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Few  things are more so,&rdquo; was her reply.</p>
  <p>He  bit his lip and his brow grew lighter. After all, great souls frequently cling  to those of lesser calibre, provided they are true and unflawed. He would not  be discouraged. But his tone when he spoke had acquired a reverence that did  not lessen its music. &ldquo;You are, then, one of the few women who believe in  friendship?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I believe in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Looking  at her, he took off his hat. Her eye stole to his serious countenance. &ldquo;Miss  Stuyvesant is to be envied,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  friends so rare?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such  friends are,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>She  gave him a bright little look. &ldquo;Had you been with Miss Stuyvesant, and she had  expressed herself as I have done, you would have said, &lsquo;Miss Fairchild is to be  envied,&rsquo; and you would have been nearer the truth than now. Cicely&rsquo;s friendship  is to mine what an unbroken mirror is to a little racing brook. It reflects but  one image, while mine&mdash;&rdquo; She could not go on. How could she explain to this  stranger that Cicely&rsquo;s heart was undivided in its regard, while hers owned  allegiance to more than her bosom friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I were with Miss Stuyvesant now,&rdquo; he declared, too absorbed in his own ideas to  notice the break in hers, &ldquo;I should still say in face of this friendship, &lsquo;Miss  Stuyvesant is to be envied.&rsquo; I have no mind for more than one thought to-day,&rdquo;  exclaimed he, with a look that made her tremble.</p>
  <p>There  are some men who never know in what field to stay the current of their  impetuosity: Clarence Ensign did. He said no more than this of all that was  seething in his mind and heart. He felt that he must prove himself a man,  before he exercised a man&rsquo;s privilege. Besides, his temperament was mercurial,  and never remained long under the bondage of a severe thought, or an impressive  tone of mind. He worshipped the lofty, but it was with tabor and cymbal and  high-sounding lute. A climb over the stile at the foot of the hill was enough  to restore him to himself. It was therefore with merry eyes and laughing lips  that they approached the house and entered Miss Belinda&rsquo;s presence.</p>
  <p>There  are some persons whose prerogative it is to carry sunshine with them wherever  they go. Clarence Ensign was one of these. Without an effort, without any  display of incongruous hilarity, he always succeeded by the mere joyousness of  his own nature, in calling forth all that was bright and enjoyable in others.  When therefore they stepped into the quaint old-fashioned parlor, all prepared  to receive them, Paula was not surprised to perceive it brighten, and her aunts&rsquo;  faces grow cheerful and smiling. Who could meet Clarence Ensign&rsquo;s laughing eye  and not smile? What did astonish her, however, was the sight of an elegant  basket of hot-house flowers perched on a table in the centre of the room. It  made her pause, and cast looks of inquiry at the demure countenance of Miss  Abby, and the quietly satisfied expression of her more thoughtful aunt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  remembrance from the city!&rdquo; said Mr. Ensign gracefully. &ldquo;I thought it might  help to recall some happy hours to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a swelling of the heart which she could not understand, she leaned over the  ample cluster of roses and heliotrope. She felt as though she could embrace  them; they were more than flowers, they were the visible emblem of all she had  missed, and for which she had longed these many months.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  seem to receive the whole in the part,&rdquo; said she.</p>
  <p>He  may or may not have understood her, but he saw she was gratified, and that was  sufficient. The afternoon flew by on wings of light. Miss Belinda, who was not  accustomed to holidays, but who thoroughly appreciated them when they came,  entered into the conversation with zest; while Miss Abby&rsquo;s unconscious  expressions of pleasure were too <i>na&iuml;ve</i> not to add to, rather than  detract from the general enjoyment. The twilight, with its good-bye, came all  too soon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have a request to make before I go,&rdquo; said Mr. Ensign. He was standing alone  with Paula in the embrasure of the window, a few moments before his departure. &ldquo;When  we see a flower nodding on a ledge above our heads, we long for it; I have  heard you talk of friendship, and a great desire has seized me. Miss Fairchild  will you be my friend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  gave him a startled glance that, however, soon settled into a mellow radiant  look of sympathy and pleasure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is asking for something which if I hesitate to accord, it is because the word, &lsquo;friend,&rsquo;  carries with it so much,&rdquo; said she, with a sweet seriousness that disarmed her  words of any latent sting they might otherwise have contained.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and I am very bold to ask it upon so slight an acquaintance;  but life is short and real treasure is so scarce. You will not deny me, Miss  Fairchild?&rdquo; Then seeing her look down, hastily continued, &ldquo;I have acquaintances  by the score&mdash;friends who style themselves thus, by the dozen, but no <i>friend</i>.  I want one; I want you for that one. Will you be it? I shall be jealous though,  I warn you,&rdquo; he went on, with a cropping out of his mirthful nature; &ldquo;I shall  not be pleased to observe the circle widened indefinitely. I shall want my own  place and no one else in my place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one else can fill the place once given to a friend. Each one has his own niche.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I am to have mine?&rdquo; His look was firm, his eye steadfast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she breathed.</p>
  <p>With  a proud stooping of his head, he took her hand and kissed it. The action became  him; he was tall and well made, and gallantry induced by feeling, sat well upon  him. In spite of herself, she thought of old-time stories of the Norse  chivalry; he stood so radiant and bent so low.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall prize my friend at her queenly value,&rdquo; said he; and without more ado,  uttered his farewell and took his departure.</p>
 <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young girl started from a reverie which had held her for a long time enchained  at that fast darkening window, and hastily looking up, perceived her Aunt  Belinda standing before her, with her eye fixed upon her face, with a kind but  searching glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  aunt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have not told me who this Mr. Ensign is. In all the letters you wrote me you  did not mention his name, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  aunt. The fact is, I did not meet him until a few days before I left, and then  only for an evening, you might say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!  that one evening seems to have made its impression. Tell me something about  him, Paula.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  own countenance speaks for him better than I can, aunt. He is good and he is  kind; an honest young man, who need fear the eye of no one. He is wealthy, I am  informed, and the son of highly respected parents. He was first presented to me  by Miss Stuyvesant, whose friend he is, afterwards by Mr. Sylvester. His coming  here was a surprise to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Belinda&rsquo;s firm mouth, which had expanded at this dutiful response, twitched  with a certain amused expression over this last announcement. Eying her niece  with unrelenting inquiry, she pursued, &ldquo;You have not been happy for the last  few weeks, Paula. Our life seems narrow to you; you long to fly away to larger  fields and more expansive skies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a guilty droop of her head, Paula stole her hand into that of her aunt&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not wonder,&rdquo; continued Miss Belinda, still watching the flushing cheek and  slightly troubled mouth of the lovely girl before her. &ldquo;I once breathed other  air myself, and know well what charms lie beyond these mountains. In giving you  up for awhile, I gave you up forever, I fear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no,&rdquo; whispered the young girl, &ldquo;I am always yours wherever I go. Not that I am  going away,&rdquo; she hastily murmured.</p>
  <p>Her  aunt smiled and gently stroked her niece&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;When the time comes, I shall  bid you God speed, Paula. I am no ogress to tie my dove&rsquo;s wings to her nest.  Love and the home it provides are the natural lot of women. None feel it more  than those who have missed both.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aunt!&rdquo;  Paula was shocked and perplexed. A breaking wave full of doubts and  possibilities, seemed to dash over her at this suggestion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Young  men of judgment and principle do not come so many miles to see a youthful  maiden, without a purpose,&rdquo; continued her aunt inexorably. &ldquo;You know that, do  you not, Paula?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but the purpose may differ in different cases,&rdquo; returned the young girl  hurriedly. &ldquo;I would not like to believe that Mr. Ensign came here with the one  you give him credit for&mdash;not yet. You trouble me, aunt,&rdquo; pursued she, glancing  tremulously about. &ldquo;It is like opening a great door flooded with sunshine, upon  eyes scarcely strong enough to bear the glimmer sifting through its cracks. I  feel humiliated and&mdash;&rdquo; She did not finish, perhaps her thought itself was  incomplete.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  a light comes sifting through the cracks, I am satisfied,&rdquo; said her aunt in a  lighter tone than common. And she kissed her niece, and went smiling out of the  room, murmuring to herself,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have been over-fearful; everything is coming right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  are moments when life&rsquo;s great mystery overpowers us; when the riddle of the  soul flaunts itself before us unexplained, and we can do no more than stand and  take the rush of the tide that comes sweeping down upon us. Paula was not the  girl she was before she went to New York. Love was no longer a dreamy  possibility, a hazy blending of the unknown and the fancied; its tale had been  too often breathed in her ear, its reality made too often apparent to her eye.  But love to which she could listen, was as new and fresh and strange, as a  world into which her foot had never ventured. That her aunt should point to a  certain masculine form, no matter how attractive or interesting, and say, &ldquo;Love  and home are the lot of women,&rdquo; made her blood rush back on her heart, like a  stream from which a dam has been ruthlessly wrenched away. It was too wild, too  sudden; a friend&rsquo;s name was so much easier to speak, or to contemplate. She did  not know what to do with her own heart, made to speak thus before its time; its  beatings choked her; everything choked her; this was a worse imprisonment than  the other. Looking round, her eye fell upon the flowers. Ah, was not their  language expressive enough, without this new suggestion? They seemed to lose  something in this very gain. She liked them less she thought, and yet her feet  drew near, and near, and nearer, to where they stood, exhaling their very souls  out in delicious perfume. &ldquo;I am too young!&rdquo; came from Paula&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;I will not  think of it!&rdquo; quickly followed. Yet the smile with which she bent over the  fragrant blossoms, had an ethereal beauty in it, which was not all unmixed with  the</p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Light  that never was on land or sea, <br>
  The consecration and the poet&rsquo;s dream.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has asked to be my friend,&rdquo; murmured she, as she slowly turned away. &ldquo;It is  enough; it must be enough.&rdquo; But the blossom she had stolen from the midst of  the fragrant collection, seemed to whisper a merry nay, as it nodded against  her hand, and afterwards gushed out its sweet life on her pure young breast.</p>

    Mist In The Valley</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;The  true beginning of our end.&rdquo;&mdash;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Ensign was not slow in developing his ideas of friendship. Though he did not  venture upon repeating his visit too soon, scarcely a week passed without  bringing to Paula a letter or some other testimonial of his increasing  devotion. The blindest eye could not fail to remark whither he was tending.  Even Paula was forced to acknowledge to herself that she was on the verge of a  flowery incline, that sooner or later would bring her up breathless against the  dread alternative of a decided yes or no. Friendship is a wide portal, and  sometimes admits love; had it served her traitorously in this?</p>
  <p>Her  aunt who watched her with secret but lynx-eyed scrutiny, saw no reason to alter  the first judgment of that mysterious, &ldquo;It is all coming right,&rdquo; with which she  viewed the first symptoms of Paula&rsquo;s girlish appreciation of her lover. If eyes  and lips could speak, Paula was happy. The mournful shadows which of late had  flitted with more or less persistency over her face, had vanished in a living  smile, which if not deep, was cloudlessly radiant; and her voice when not used  in speech, was rippling away in song, as glad as a finch&rsquo;s on the mountain  side.</p>
  <p>Miss  Belinda was therefore very much astonished when one day Paula burst into her  presence, and flinging herself down on her knees, threw her arms about her  waist, crying,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  me away, dear aunt, I cannot, dare not stay here another day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula,  what do you mean?&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Belinda, holding her back and endeavoring to  look into her face. But the young girl gently resisted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have just had a letter from Cicely,&rdquo; she returned in a low and muffled voice. &ldquo;She  has seen Mr. Sylvester, and says he looks both wan and ill. He told her, too,  that he was lonely, and I know what that means; he wants his child. The time  has come for me to go back. He said it would, and that I would know when it  came. Take me, aunt, take me to Mr. Sylvester.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Belinda, to whom self-control was one of the cardinal virtues, leaned back in  her chair and contemplated the eager, tear-stained face that was now raised to  hers, with silent scrutiny. &ldquo;Paula,&rdquo; said she at last, &ldquo;is that your only  reason for desiring to return to New York?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  flush, delicate as it was fleeting, swept over the dew of Paula&rsquo;s cheek. She  rose to her feet and met her aunt&rsquo;s eye, with a look of gentle dignity. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said she, &ldquo;I wish to test myself. Birds that are prisoned will caress any hand  that offers them freedom. I wish to see if the lure holds good when my wings  are in mid-heaven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a dreamy cadence to her voice as she uttered that last phrase, that  startled her aunt. &ldquo;Paula,&rdquo; exclaimed she, &ldquo;Paula, don&rsquo;t you know your own  heart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  does?&rdquo; returned Paula; then in a sudden rush of emotion threw herself once more  at her aunt&rsquo;s side, saying, &ldquo;It is in order to know it, that I ask you to take  me away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  Miss Belinda, as she smoothed back her darling&rsquo;s locks, was obliged to  acknowledge to herself, that time has a way of opening, in the stream of life,  unforeseen channels to whose current we perforce must yield, or else hopelessly  strand upon the shoals.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_30"></a>Chapter 30<br>
    Miss Belinda Presents Mr. Sylvester With A Christmas Gift</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;For,  O; for, O the hobby horse is forgot.&rdquo;&mdash;Hamlet.</p>
  <p>It  was a clear winter evening. Mr. Sylvester sat in his library, musing before a  bright coal fire, whose superabundant heat and blaze seemed to make the  loneliness of the great empty room more apparent. He had just said to himself  that it was Christmas eve, and that he, of all men in the world, had the least  reason to realize it, when the door-bell rang. He was expecting Bertram, whose  advancement to the position of cashier in place of Mr. Wheelock, now thoroughly  broken down in health, had that day been fully determined upon in a late  meeting of the Board of Directors. He therefore did not disturb himself. It was  consequently a startling surprise, when a deep, pleasant voice uttered from the  threshold of the door, &ldquo;I have brought you a Christmas present;&rdquo; and looking  up, he saw Miss Belinda standing before him, with Paula at her side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  child!&rdquo; was his involuntary exclamation, and before the young girl knew it, she  was folded against his breast with a passionate fervor that more than words,  convinced her of the depth of the sacrifice which had held them separate for so  long. &ldquo;My darling! my little Paula!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  felt her heart stand still. Gently disengaging herself, she looked in his face.  She found it thin and wan, but lit by such a pleasure she could not keep back  her smile. &ldquo;You are glad, then, of your little Christmas present?&rdquo; said she.</p>
  <p>He  smiled and shook his head; he had no words with which to express a joy like  this.</p>
  <p>Miss  Belinda meanwhile stood with a set expression on her face, that, to one who did  not know her, would immediately have proclaimed her to be an ogress of the very  worst type. Not a glance did she give to the unusual splendor about her, not a  wavering of her eye betokened that she was in any way conscious that she had  just stepped from the threshold of a very humble cottage, into a home little  short of a palace in size and the splendor of its appointments. All her  attention was concentrated on the two faces before her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  ride on the cars has made Paula feverish,&rdquo; cried she, in sharp clear tones that  rang with unexpected brusqueness through the curtained alcoves of that lordly  apartment.</p>
  <p>They  both started at this sudden introduction of the prosaic into the hush of their  happy meeting, but remembering themselves, drew Miss Belinda forward to the  fire and made her welcome in this house of many memories.</p>
  <p>It  was a strange moment to Paula when she first turned to go up those stairs, down  which she had come in such grief eight months or more ago. She found herself  lingering on its well-remembered steps, and the first sight of the rich bronze  image at the top, struck her with a sense of the old-time pleasure, that was  not unlinked with the old-time dread. But the aspect of her little room calmed  her. It was just as she had left it; not an article had been changed. &ldquo;It is as  if I had gone out one door and come in another,&rdquo; she whispered. All the months  that had intervened seemed to float away. She felt this even more when upon  again descending, she found Bertram in the library. His frank and interesting  face had always been pleasant to her, but in the joy of her return it shone  upon her with almost the attraction of a brother&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I am at home again,&rdquo; she  kept whispering to herself, &ldquo;I am at home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Belinda was engrossed in conversation with Bertram, so that Paula was left free  to take her old place by Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s side, where she sat with such an  aspect of contentment, that her beauty was half forgotten in her happiness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  remembered me, then, sometimes in the little cottage in Grotewell?&rdquo; asked he,  after a silent contemplation of her countenance. &ldquo;I was not forgotten when you  left the city streets?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  answered with a bright little shake of her head, but she was inwardly wondering  as she looked at his strong and picturesque face, with its nobly carved  features and melancholy smile, if he had been absent from her thoughts for so  much as a moment, in all these dreary months of separation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not believe you would forget,&rdquo; he gently pursued, &ldquo;but I scarcely dared  hope you would lighten my fireside with your face again. It is such a dismal  one, and youth is so linked to brightness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  flush that crossed her cheek, startled him into sudden silence. She recovered  herself and slowly shook her head. &ldquo;It is not a dismal one to me. I always feel  brighter and better when I sit beside it. I have missed your counsel,&rdquo; she  said; &ldquo;brightness is nothing without depth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  eyes which had been fixed on her face, turned slowly away. He seemed to hold an  instant&rsquo;s communion with himself; suddenly he said, &ldquo;And depth is worse than  nothing, without it mirrors the skies. It is not from shadowed pools, such  bright young lips should drink, but from the waves of an inexhaustible sea,  smote upon by all the winds and sunshine of heaven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  another moment, however, he was all cheerfulness. &ldquo;You have brought me a  Christmas present,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;and we must make it a Christmas holiday indeed.  Here is the beginning:&rdquo; and with one of his old grave smiles, he handed Bertram  a little note which had been awaiting him on the library table. &ldquo;But Paula and  Miss Belinda must have their pleasure too. Paula, are you too tired for a ride  down town? I will show you New York on a Christmas eve,&rdquo; continued he to Miss  Walton, seeing that Paula&rsquo;s attention was absorbed by the expression of sudden  and moving surprise which had visited Bertram&rsquo;s face, upon the perusal of his  note. &ldquo;It is a stirring sight. Nothing more cheering can be found the wide  world over, for those who have a home and children to make happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  certainly should enjoy a glimpse of holiday cheer,&rdquo; assented Miss Belinda. And  Paula recalled to herself by the sound of her aunt&rsquo;s voice, gayly re-echoed her  assertion.</p>
  <p>So  Samuel was despatched for a carriage, and in a few minutes they were all riding  down Fifth Avenue, <i>en route</i> for Tiffany&rsquo;s, Macy&rsquo;s, and any other store  that might offer special attractions. It was a happy company. As they rolled  along, Paula felt her heart grow lighter and lighter, Mr. Sylvester was almost  gay, while even Aunt Belinda condescended to be merry. Bertram alone was  silent, but as Paula caught short glimpses of his face, while speeding past  some illuminated corner, she felt that it was that silence which is &ldquo;the perfectest  herald of joy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall make you get out and mix with the crowd,&rdquo; said Mr. Sylvester. &ldquo;I want you  to feel the throb of the great heart of the city on such a night as this. It is  as if all men were brothers&mdash;or fathers, I should say. People that ordinarily  pass each other without a sign, nod and smile with pleasing recognition of the  evening&rsquo;s cheer. Grave and reverend seigniors, are not ashamed to be seen  carrying packages by the dozen. Indeed, he who is most laden is considered the  best fellow, and he who is so unfortunate as to show nothing but empty arms,  feels shy if not ashamed; a condition of mind into which I shall soon fall  myself, if we do not presently reach our destination.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paula  never forgot that night. As from the midst of our common-place memories, some  one hour stands out distinct and strange, like a sweet foreigner in a crowd of  village faces, so to Paula, this ride through the lighted streets, with the  ensuing rush from store to store, piloted by Bertram and Miss Belinda, and  protected by Mr. Sylvester, was her one weird glimpse into the Arabian Nights&rsquo;  country. Why, she could not have told; why, she did not stop to think. She had  been to all these places before, but never with such a heart as this&mdash;never,  never with such an overflowing heart as this.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have washed away my reproach,&rdquo; cried Mr. Sylvester, coming out to the carriage  with his arms full of bundles. &ldquo;Aunt Belinda is to blame for this; she set the  example, you see.&rdquo; And with a merry laugh, he tossed one thing after another  into Paula&rsquo;s lap, reserving only one small package for himself. &ldquo;I scarcely  know what I have bought,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I shall be as much surprised as any one,  when you come to undo the bundles. &lsquo;A pretty thing,&rsquo; was all I waited to hear  from the shop girls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is a small printing press for one thing,&rdquo; cried Paula merrily. &ldquo;I saw the man  at Holton&rsquo;s eye you with a certain sort of shrewd humor, and hastily do it up.  You paid for it; probably thinking it one of the &lsquo;pretty things.&rsquo; We shall have  to make it over to Bertram, as being the only one amongst us who by any stretch  of imagination can be said to be near enough the age of boyhood to enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know about that,&rdquo; cried Bertram, with a ringing infectious laugh, &ldquo;my  imagination has been luring me into believing that I am not the only boy in  this crowd.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  so they went on, toying with their new-found joy as with a plaything, and hard  would it have been to tell in which of those voices rang the deeper  contentment.</p>
  <p>The  opening of the packages on the library-table afforded another season of  merriment. Such treasures as came to light! A roll of black silk, which could  only have been meant for Miss Belinda. A casket of fretted silver, just large  enough to hold Paula&rsquo;s gloves; a scarf-ring, to which no one but Bertram could  lay claim; a bundle of confections, a pair of diamond-studded bracelets, a  scarf of delicate lace, articles for the desk, and knick-knacks for the toilet  table, and last, but not least, in weight at least, the honest little  printing-press.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I never dreamed of this,&rdquo; said Paula, &ldquo;when we chose Christmas eve for our  journey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  would you have done right to stay away if you had,&rdquo; returned Mr. Sylvester  gayly.</p>
  <p>But  when the sport was all over, and Paula stood alone with Mr. Sylvester in the  library, awaiting his last good-night, the deeper influences of this holy time  made themselves felt, and it was with an air of gentle seriousness, he told her  that it had been a happy Christmas eve to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  to me,&rdquo; returned Paula. &ldquo;Bertram too, seemed very happy. Would it be too  inquisitive in me to ask what good news the little note contained, to work such  wonders?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  smile such as was seldom seen on Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s face of late, flashed brightly  over it. &ldquo;It was only a card of invitation to dinner,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but it came  from Mr. Stuyvesant, and that to Bertram means a great deal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  surprise in Paula&rsquo;s eyes made him smile again. &ldquo;Will it be a great shock to  you, if I tell you that the name of the woman for whom Bertram made the  sacrifice of his art, was Cicely Stuyvesant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cicely?  my Cicely?&rdquo; Her astonishment was great, but it was also happy. &ldquo;Oh, I never  dreamed&mdash;ah, now I see,&rdquo; she went on naively. &ldquo;That is the reason she refrained  from coming to this house; she was afraid of meeting <i>him</i>. But to think I  should never have guessed it, and she my dearest friend! Oh, I am very happy; I  admire Bertram so much, and it is such a beautiful secret. And Mr. Stuyvesant  has invited him to his house! I do not wonder you felt like making the evening  a gala one. Mr. Stuyvesant would not do that if he were not learning to  appreciate Bertram.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  there is method in all that Mr. Stuyvesant does. More than that, if I am not  mistaken, he has known this beautiful secret, as you call it, from the first,  and would be the last to receive Bertram as a guest to his table, if he did not  mean him the best and truest encouragement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe you are right,&rdquo; said Paula. &ldquo;I remember now that one day when I was  spending the afternoon with Cicely, he came into the room where I was, and  finding me for the moment alone, sat down, and in his quaint old-fashioned  manner asked me in the most abrupt way what I thought of Bertram Sylvester. I  was surprised, but told him I considered him one of the noblest young men I  knew, adding that if a fine mind, a kind heart, and a pure life were open to  regard, Bertram had the right to claim the esteem of all his friends and  associates. The old gentleman looked at me somewhat curiously, but nodded his  head as if pleased, and merely remarking, &lsquo;It is not necessary to mention we  had this conversation, my dear,&rsquo; got up and proceeded slowly from the room. I  thought it was simply a not unnatural curiosity concerning a young man with  whom he had more or less business connection; but now I perceive it had a  deeper significance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  could scarcely have found a more zealous little advocate for Bertram if he had  hunted the city over. Bertram may be more obliged to you than he knows. He has  been very patient, but the day of his happiness is approaching.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Cicely&rsquo;s! I feel as if I could scarcely wait to see her with this new hope in  her eyes. She has kept me without the door of her suspense, but she must let me  across the threshold of her happiness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  look with which Mr. Sylvester eyed the fair girl&rsquo;s radiant face deepened. &ldquo;Paula,&rdquo;  said be, &ldquo;can you leave these new thoughts for a moment to hear a request I  have to make?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  at once turned to him with her most self-forgetful smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have been making myself a little present,&rdquo; pursued he, slowly taking out of his  pocket the single package he had reserved from the rest. &ldquo;Open it, dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  fingers that unconsciously trembled, she hastily undid the package. A little  box rolled out. Taking off its cover, she took out a plain gold locket of the  style usually worn by gentlemen on their watch-chains. &ldquo;Fasten it on for me,&rdquo;  said he.</p>
  <p>Wondering  at his tone which was almost solemn, she quietly did his bidding. But when she  essayed to lift her head upon the completion of her task, he gently laid his  hand upon her brow and so stood for a moment without a word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it?&rdquo; she asked, with a sudden indrawing of her breath. &ldquo;What moves you so,  Mr. Sylvester?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have just taken a vow,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>She  started back agitated and trembling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had reason to,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;pray at nights when you go to bed, that I may be  able to keep it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;  sprang to her lips; but she restrained herself and only allowed her glance to  speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you do it, Paula?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  oh yes!&rdquo; Her whole heart seemed to rush out in the phrase. She drew back as at  the opening of a door in an unexpected spot. Her eye had something of fear in  it and something of secret desperation too. He watched her with a gaze that  strangely faltered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  woman&rsquo;s prayers are a man&rsquo;s best safeguard,&rdquo; murmured he. &ldquo;He must be a wretch  who does not feel himself surrounded by a sacred halo, while he knows that pure  lips are breathing his name in love and trust before the throne of the Most  High.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will pray for you as for myself,&rdquo; she whispered, and endeavored to meet his eyes.  But her head drooped and she did not speak as she would have done a few months  before; and when a few instants later they parted in their old fashion at the  foot of the stairs, she did not turn to give him the accustomed smile and nod  with which she used to mount the stairs, spiral by spiral, and disappear in her  little room above. Yet he did not grieve at the change, but stood looking up  the way she had gone, like a man before whom some vision of unexpected promise  had opened.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_31"></a>Chapter 31<br>
    A Question</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Think  on thy sins.&rdquo;&mdash;Othello.</p>
  <p>The  next morning when Mr. Sylvester came down to breakfast, he found on the  library-table an exquisite casket, similar to the one he had given Paula the  night before, but larger, and filled with flowers of the most delicious odor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  Miss Fairchild,&rdquo; explained Samuel, who was at that moment passing through the  room.</p>
  <p>With  a pang of jealous surprise, that, however, failed to betray itself in his  steadily composed countenance, Mr. Sylvester advanced to the side of the table,  and lifted up the card that hung attached to the beautiful present. The name he  read there seemed to startle him; he moved away, and took up his paper with a  dark flush on his brow, that had not disappeared when Miss Belinda entered the  room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;  was her immediate exclamation, as her eye rested upon the conspicuous offering  in the centre of the apartment. But instantly remembering herself, advanced  with a cheerful good-morning, which however did not prevent her eyes from  wandering with no small satisfaction towards this fresh evidence of Mr. Ensign&rsquo;s  assiduous regard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula  is remembered by others than ourselves,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Sylvester, probably  observing her glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  she has a very attentive suitor in Mr. Ensign,&rdquo; returned Miss Belinda shortly. &ldquo;A  pleasant appearing young man,&rdquo; she ejaculated next moment; &ldquo;worthy in many  respects of success, I should say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  he&mdash;do you mean to say that he has visited you in Grotewell?&rdquo; asked Mr.  Sylvester, his eye upon the paper in his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly;  a few more interviews will settle it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  paper rustled in Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s grasp, but his voice was composed if not  formal, as he observed, &ldquo;She regards his attentions then with favor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  wears his flowers in her bosom, and brightens like a flower herself when he is  seen to approach. If allowed to go her way unhindered, I have but little doubt  as to how it will end. Mr. Ensign is not handsome, but I am told that he has  every other qualification likely to make a gentle creature like Paula happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is a good fellow,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Sylvester under his breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  goodness is the first essential in the character of the man who is to marry  Paula,&rdquo; inexorably observed Miss Belinda. &ldquo;An open, cheerful disposition, a  clear conscience and a past with no dark pages in its history, must mark him  who is to link unto his fate our pure and sensitive Paula. Is it not so, Mr.  Sylvester?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  advertisements in that morning&rsquo;s <i>Tribune</i> must have been unusually  interesting, judging from the difficulty which Mr. Sylvester experienced in  withdrawing his eyes from them. &ldquo;The man whom Paula marries,&rdquo; said he at last, &ldquo;can  neither be too good, too kind, or too pure. Nor shall any other than a good,  kind, and pure man possess her,&rdquo; he added in a tone that while low, effectually  hushed even the slow-to-be-intimidated Miss Belinda. In another moment Paula  entered.</p>
  <p>Oh,  the morning freshness of some faces! Like the singing of birds in a prison, is  the sound and sight of a lovely maiden coming into the grim, gray atmosphere of  a winter breakfast room. Paula was exceptionally gifted with this auroral cheer  which starts the day so brightly. At sight of her face Mr. Sylvester dropped  his paper, and even Miss Belinda straightened herself more energetically. &ldquo;Merry  Christmas,&rdquo; cried her sweet young voice, and immediately the whole day seemed  to grow glad with promise and gaysome with ringing sleigh-bells. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s snowing,  did you know it? A world of life is in the air; the flakes dance as they come  down, like dervishes in a frenzy. It was all we lacked to make the day  complete; now we have everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Miss Belinda, with a significant glance at the table, &ldquo;everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paula  followed her glance, saw the silver box with its wealth of blossoms, and  faltered back with a quick look at Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s grave and watchful  countenance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Ensign seems to be possessed of clairvoyance,&rdquo; observed Miss Belinda easily. &ldquo;How  he could know that you were to be in town to-day, I cannot imagine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wrote him in my last letter that in all probability I should spend the holidays  with Mr. Sylvester,&rdquo; explained Paula simply, but with a slow and deepening  flush, that left the roses she contemplated nothing of which to boast. &ldquo;I did  so, because he proposed to visit Grotewell on Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a short silence in the room, then Mr. Sylvester rose, and remarking with  polite composure, &ldquo;It is a very pretty remembrance,&rdquo; led the way into the  dining-room. Paula with a slow drooping of her head quickly followed, while  Miss Belinda brought up the rear, with the look of a successful diplomat.</p>
  <p>A  meal in the Sylvester mansion was always a formal affair, but this was more  than formal. A vague oppression seemed to fill the air; an oppression which  Miss Belinda&rsquo;s stirring conversation found it impossible to dissipate. In compliance  to Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s request, she sat at the head of the table, and was the only  one who seemed able to eat anything. For one thing she had never seen Ona in  that post of honor, but Paula and Mr. Sylvester could not forget the graceful  form that once occupied that seat. The first meal above a grave, no matter how  long it has been dug, must ever seem weighted with more or less unreality.</p>
  <p>Besides,  with Paula there was a vague unsettled feeling, as if some delicate inner  balance had been too rudely shaken. She longed to fly away and think, and she  was obliged to sit still and talk.</p>
  <p>The  end of the meal was a relief to all parties. Miss Belinda went up stairs,  thoughtfully shaking her firm head; Mr. Sylvester sat down again to his paper,  and Paula advanced towards the dainty gift that awaited her inspection on the  library table. But half way to it she paused. A strange shyness had seized her.  With Mr. Sylvester sitting there, she dared not approach this delicate  testimonial of another&rsquo;s affection. She did not know as she wished to. Her eyes  stole in hesitation to the floor. Suddenly Mr. Sylvester spoke:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you not look at your pretty present, Paula?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  started, gave him a quick glance, and advanced hurriedly towards the table; but  scarcely had she reached it when she paused, turned and hastened over to his  side. He was still reading, or appearing to read, but she saw his hand tremble  where it grasped the sheet, though his face with its clear cut profile, shone  calm and cold against the dark background of the wall beyond.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not care to look at it now,&rdquo; said she, with a hurried interlacing of her  restless fingers.</p>
  <p>He  turned towards her and a quick thrill passed over his countenance. &ldquo;Sit down,  Paula,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I want to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  obeyed as might an automaton. Was it the tone of his voice that chilled her, or  the studied aspect of his fixed and solemn countenance? He did not speak at  once, but when he did, there was no faltering in his voice, that was lower than  common, but deep, like still waters that have run into dark channels far from  the light of day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula,  I want to ask you a question. What would you think of a man that, with  deliberate selfishness, went into the king&rsquo;s garden, and plucking up by the  roots the most beautiful flower he could find there, carried it into a dungeon  to pant out its exquisite life amid chill and darkness?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think,&rdquo; replied she, after the first startled moment of silence, &ldquo;that  the man did well, if by its one breath of sweetness, the flower could comfort the  heart of him who sat in the dungeon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  glance with which Mr. Sylvester regarded her, suddenly faltered; he turned with  quickness towards the fire. &ldquo;A moment&rsquo;s joy is, then, excuse for a murder,&rdquo;  exclaimed he. &ldquo;God and the angels would not agree with you, Paula.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a quivering in his tone, made all the more apparent by its studied  self-possession of a moment before. She trembled where she sat, and opened her  lips to speak, but closed them again, awed by his steady and abstracted gaze,  now fixed before him in gloomy reverie. A moment passed. The clock ticking away  on the mantel-piece seemed to echo the inevitable &ldquo;Forever! never!&rdquo; of  Longfellow&rsquo;s old song. Neither of them moved. At length, in a low and trembling  voice, Paula spoke:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it murder, when the flower loves the dark of the dungeon more than it does the  light of day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a subdued but passionate cry he rose hastily to his feet. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, and  drew back as if he could not bear the sight of her face or the glance of her  eye. &ldquo;Sunshine is the breath of flowers; sweet wooing gales, their natural  atmosphere. He who meddles with a treasure so choice does it at his peril.&rdquo;  Then as she hurriedly rose in turn, softened his whole tone, and assuming his  usual air of kindly fatherhood, asked her in the most natural way in the world,  what he could do to make her happy that day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;  replied she, with a droop of her head; &ldquo;I think I will go and see Cicely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  short sigh escaped him. &ldquo;The carriage shall be ready for you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I hope  your friend&rsquo;s happiness will overflow into your own gentle bosom, and make the  day a very pleasant one. God bless your young sweet heart, my Paula!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  breast heaved, her large, dark, mellow eyes flashed with one quick glance  towards his face, then she drew back, and in another moment left his side and  quietly glided from the room. His very life seemed to go with her, yet he did  not stir; but he sighed deeply when, upon turning towards the library-table, he  found that she had carried away with her the silent testimonial of another and  more fortunate man&rsquo;s love and devotion.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_32"></a>Chapter 32<br>
    Full Tide</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;A  skirmish of wit between them.&rdquo;&mdash;Much Ado About Nothing.</p>
  <p>Man  thinks he is strong, and lays his foundations, raises his walls, and dreams of  his completed turrets, without reckoning the force of the gales or the  insidious inundating of the waters that may bring low the mounting structure  before its time. When with a firm hand, Mr. Sylvester thrust back from his  heart the one delight which of all the world could afford, seemed to him at  that moment the dearest and the best, he thought the struggle was over and the  victory won. It had not even commenced. He was made startlingly alive to this  fact at the very next interview he had with Paula. She had just come from Miss Stuyvesant,  and the reflection of her friend&rsquo;s scarcely comprehended joy was on her  countenance, together with a look he could not comprehend, but which stirred  and haunted him, until he felt forced to ask if she had seen any other of her  old friends, in the short visit she had paid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said she, with a distressed blush. &ldquo;Mr. Ensign was unexpectedly there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  is comparatively easy to restrain your own hand from snatching at a treasure  you greatly covet, but it is much more difficult to behold another and a lesser  one grasp and carry it away before your eyes. He succeeded in hiding the shadow  that oppressed him, but he was constrained to recognize the sharpness of the  conflict that was about to be waged in the recesses of his own breast. A  conflict, because he knew that a lift of his finger, or a glance of his eye  would decide the matter then, while in a week, perhaps, the glamour of a young  sunshiny love, would have worked its inevitable result, and the happiness that  had so unexpectedly startled upon him in his monotonous and sombre path, would  have wandered forever out of his reach. How did he meet its unexpected rush.  Sternly at first, but with greater and greater wavering as the days went by,  each one revealing fresh beauties of character and deeper springs of feeling in  the enchanting girl thus brought in all her varied charm before his eyes. Why  should he not be happy? If there were dark pages in his life, had they not long  ago been closed and sealed, and was not the future bright with promise? A man of  his years was not through with life. He felt at times as he gazed upon her face  with its indescribable power of awakening far-reaching thoughts and feelings in  callous breasts long unused to the holy influence of either, that he had just  begun to live; that the golden country, with its enticing vistas, lay all  before him, and that the youth, which he had missed, had somehow returned to  his prime, fresh with more than its usual enthusiasm and bright with more than  its wonted hopes and projects. With this glorious woman at his side, life would  be new indeed, and if new why not pure and sweet and noble? What was there to  hinder him from making the existence of this sweet soul a walking amongst  gentle duties, satisfied dreams and holy aspirations? A past remorse? Why the  gates could be closed on that! A strain of innate weakness for the world&rsquo;s good  opinion and applause? Ah! with love in his life such a weakness must disappear;  besides had he not taken a vow on her dear head, that ought to hedge him about  as with angel&rsquo;s wings in the hour of temptation? Men with his experience do not  invoke the protection of innocence to guard a degraded soul. Why, then, all  this hesitation? A great boon was being offered to him after years of  loneliness and immeasurable longing; was it not the will of heaven, that he  should meet and enjoy this unexpected grace? He dared to stop and ask, and once  daring to ask, the insidious waters found their way beneath the foundations of  his resolution, and the lofty structure he had reared in such self-confidence,  began to tremble where it stood, though as yet it betrayed no visible sign of  weakness.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  society with its innumerable demands, had drawn the beautiful young girl within  its controlling grasp. She must go here, she must go there; she must lend her  talents to this, her beauty to that. Before she had decided whether she ought  to remain in the city a week, two had flown by, and in all this time Mr. Ensign  had been ever at her side, brightening in her own despite, hours which might  else have been sad, and surrounding her difficult path with proofs of his  silent and wary devotion. A golden net seemed to be closing around her, and,  though as yet, she had given no token of a special recognition of her position,  Miss Belinda betrayed by the uniform complacence of her demeanor, that she for  one regarded the matter as effectually settled.</p>
  <p>The  success which Bertram had met in his first visit at Mr. Stuyvesant&rsquo;s, was not  the least agitating factor in this fortnight&rsquo;s secret history. He was too much  a part of the home life at Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s, not to make the lightest thrill of  his frank and sensitive nature felt by all who invaded its precincts. And he  was in a state of repressed expectancy at this time, that unconsciously created  an atmosphere about him of vague but restless excitement. The hearts of all who  encountered his look of concentrated delight, must unconsciously beat with his.  A strain sweeter than his old-time music was in his voice. When he played upon  the piano, which was but seldom, it was as if he breathed out his soul before  the holy images. When he walked, he seemed to tread on air. His every glance  was a question as to whether this great joy, for which he had so long and  patiently waited, was to be his? Love, living and apotheosized, appeared to  blaze before them, and no one can look on love without feeling somewhere in his  soul the stir of those deep waters, whose pulsing throb even in the darkness of  midnight, proves that we are the children of God.</p>
  <p>Cicely  was uncommunicative, but her face, when Paula beheld it, was like the glowing  countenance of some sculptured saint, from which the veil is slowly being  withdrawn.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  there came an evening when the force of the spell that held all these various  hearts enchained gave way. It was the night of a private entertainment of great  elegance, to be held at the house of a friend of Miss Stuyvesant. Bertram had  received formal permission from the father of Cicely, to act as his daughter&rsquo;s  escort, and the fact had transformed him from a hopeful dreamer, into a man  determined to speak and know his fate at once. Paula was engaged to take part  in the entertainment, and the sight of her daintily-decked figure leaving the  house with Mr. Ensign, was the last drop in the slowly gathering tide that was  secretly swelling in Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s breast; and it was with a sudden outrush  of his whole determined nature that he stepped upstairs, dressed himself in  evening attire, and deliberately followed them to the place where they were  going. &ldquo;The wealth of the Indies is slipping from my grasp,&rdquo; was his passionate  exclamation, as he rode through the lighted streets. &ldquo;I cannot see it go; if  she can care more for me than for this sleek, merry-hearted young fellow, she  shall. I know that my love is to his, what the mighty ocean is to a placid  lake, and with such love one ought to be panoplied as with resisting steel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  stream of light and music met him, as he went up the stoop of the house that  held his treasure. It seemed to intoxicate him. Glow, melody and perfume, were  so many expressions of Paula. His friends, of whom there were many present,  received him with tokens of respect, not unmingled with surprise. It was the  first time he had been seen in public since his wife&rsquo;s death, and they could  not but remark upon the cheerfulness of his bearing, and the almost exalted  expression of his proud and restless eye. Had Paula accompanied him, they might  have understood his emotion, but with the beautiful girl under the care of one  of the most eligible gentlemen in town, what could have happened to Mr.  Sylvester to make his once melancholy countenance blazon like a star amid this  joyous and merrily-laughing throng. He did not enlighten them, but moved from  group to group, searching for Paula. Suddenly the thought flashed upon him, &ldquo;Is  it only an hour or so since I smiled upon her in my own hall, and shook my head  when she asked me with a quick, pleading look, to come with them to this very  spot?&rdquo; It seemed days, since that time. The rush of these new thoughts, the  final making up of this slowly-maturing purpose, the sudden allowing of his  heart to regard her as a woman to be won, had carried the past away as by the  sweep of a mountain torrent. He could not believe he had ever known a moment of  hesitancy, ever looked at her as a father, ever bid her go on her way and leave  the prisoner to his fate. He must always have felt like this; such momentum  could not have been gathered in an hour; she must know that he loved her  wildly, deeply, sacredly, wholly, with the fibre of his mind, his body and his  soul; that to call her his in life and in death, was the one demanding passion  of his existence, making the past a dream, and the future&mdash;ah, he dared not  question that! He must behold her face before he could even speculate upon the  realities lying behind fate&rsquo;s down-drawn curtain.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  fair faces and lovely forms flitted before him, carrying his glance along in  their train, but only because youth was a symbol of Paula. If these fresh young  girls could smile and look back upon him, with that lingering glance which his  presence ever invoked, why not she who was not only sweet, tender, and lovely,  but gifted with a nature that responded to the deep things of life, and the  stern passions of potent humanity. Could a merry laugh lure her while he stood  by? Was the sunshine the natural atmosphere of this flower, that had bloomed  under his eye so sweetly and shed out its innocent fragrance, at the approach  of his solemn-pacing foot? He began to mirror before his mind&rsquo;s eye the startled  look of happy wonder with which she would greet his impassioned glance, when  released from whatever duties might be now pressing upon her; she wandered into  these rooms, to find him awaiting her, when suddenly there was a stir in the  throng, a pleased and excited rush, and the large curtain which he had vaguely  noticed hanging at one end of the room, uplifted and&mdash;was it Paula? this coy,  brilliant, saucy-eyed Florentine maiden, stepping out from a bower of greenery,  with finger on her lip, and a backward glance of saucy defiance that seemed to  people the verdant walks behind her with gallant cavaliers, eager to follow  upon her footsteps? Yes; he could not be mistaken; there was but one face like  that in the world. It was Paula, but Paula with youth&rsquo;s merriest glamour upon  her, a glamour that had caught its radiant light from other thoughts than those  in which he had been engaged. He bowed his head, and a shudder went through him  like that which precedes the falling knife of the executioner. Even the applause  that greeted the revelation of so much loveliness and alluring charm, passed  over him like a dream. He was battling with his first recognition of the  possibility of his being too late. Suddenly her voice was heard.</p>
  <p>She  was speaking aloud to herself, this Florentine maiden who had outstripped her  lover in the garden, but the tone was the same he had heard beside his own  hearthstone, and the archness that accompanied it had frequently met and  encouraged some cheerful expression of his own. These are the words she  uttered. Listen with him to the <i>na&iuml;ve</i>, half tender, half pettish voice,  and mark with his eyes the alternate lights and shadows that flit across her  cheek as she broodingly murmurs:</p>
  <p>He  is certainly a most notable gallant. His &ldquo;Good day, lady!&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Good even  to you!&rdquo; are flavored with the cream of perfectest courtesy. But gallantry  while it sits well upon a man, does not make him one, any more than a feather  makes the cap it adorns. For a Tuscan he hath also a certain comeliness, but  then I have ever sworn, in good faith too, that I would not marry a Tuscan,  were he the best made man in Italy. Then there is his glance, which proclaims  to all men&rsquo;s understandings that he loves me, which same seems overbold; but  then his smile!</p>
  <p>Well,  for a smile it certainly does credit to his wit, but one cannot live upon  smiles; though if one could, one might consent to make a trial of his&mdash;and  starve belike for her pains. (<i>She drops her cheek into her hand and stands  musing.</i>)</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester drew a deep breath and let his eyes fall, when suddenly a hum ran  through the audience about him, and looking quickly up, he beheld Mr. Ensign  dressed in full cavalier costume, standing behind the musing maiden with a half  merry, half tender gleam upon his face, that made the thickly beating heart of  his rival shrink as if clutched in an iron vise. What followed, he heard as we  do the words of a sentence read to us from the judge&rsquo;s seat. The cavalier spoke  first and a thousand dancing colors seemed to flash in the merry banter that  followed.</p>
  <p><i>Martino.</i>&mdash;She muses, and on no other than myself, as I am ready  to swear by that coy and tremulous glance. I will move her to avow it. (<i>Advances.</i>)  Fair lady, greeting! A kiss for your sweet thoughts.</p>
  <p><i>Nita.</i> (<i>With a start</i>).&mdash;A kiss, Signior Martino? You  must acknowledge that were but a sorry exchange for thoughts like mine, so if  it please you, I will keep my thoughts and you your kiss; and lest it should  seem ungracious in me to give nothing upon your asking, I will bestow upon you  my most choice good day, and so leave you to your meditations. (<i>Curtseys and  is about to depart.</i>)</p>
  <p><i>Martino.</i>&mdash;You have the true generosity, lady; you give away  what it costs you the dearest to part from. Nay, rumple not your lip; it is the  truth for all your pretty poutings! Convince me it is not.</p>
  <p><i>Nita.</i>&mdash;Your pardon, but that would take words, and words  would take time, and time given to one of your persuasion would refute all my  arguments on the face of them. (<i>Still retreating.</i>)</p>
  <p><i>Martino.</i>&mdash;Well, lady, since it is your pleasure to be  consistent, rather than happy, adieu. Had you stayed but as long as the bee  pauses on an oleander blossom, you would have heard&mdash;</p>
  <p><i>Nita.</i>&mdash;Buzzing, signior?</p>
  <p><i>Martino.</i>&mdash;Yes, if by that word you would denominate vows of  constancy and devotion. For I do greatly love you, and would tell you so.</p>
  <p><i>Nita.</i>&mdash;And for that you expect me to linger! as though vows  were new to my ears, and words of love as strange to my understanding as  tropical birds to the eyes of a Norseman.</p>
  <p><i>Martino.</i>&mdash;If you do love me, you will linger.</p>
  <p><i>Nita.</i>&mdash;Yet if I do, (<i>Slowly advancing</i>) be assured it  is from some other motive than love.</p>
  <p><i>Martino.</i>&mdash;So it be not from hate I am contented.</p>
  <p><i>Nita.</i>&mdash;To be contented with little, proves you a man of much  virtue.</p>
  <p><i>Martino.</i>&mdash;When I have you, I am contented with much.</p>
  <p><i>Nita.</i>&mdash;That <i>when</i> is a wise insertion, signior; it  saves you from shame and me from anger.&mdash;Hark! some one calls.</p>
  <p><i>Martino.</i>&mdash;None other but the wind; it is a kindly breeze, and  grieves to hear how harsh a pretty maiden can be to the lover who adores her.</p>
  <p><i>Nita.</i>&mdash;Please your worship, I do not own a lover.</p>
  <p><i>Martino.</i>&mdash;Then mend your poverty, and accept one.</p>
  <p><i>Nita.</i>&mdash;I am no beggar to accept of alms.</p>
  <p><i>Martino.</i>&mdash;In this case, he who offers is the beggar.</p>
  <p><i>Nita.</i>&mdash;I am too young to wear a jewel of so much pretension.</p>
  <p><i>Martino.</i>&mdash;Time is a cure for youth, and marriage a happy  speeder of time.</p>
  <p><i>Nita.</i>&mdash;But youth needs no cure, and if marriage speedeth  time, I&rsquo;ll live a maid and die one. The days run swift enough without goading,  Signior Martino.</p>
  <p><i>Martino.</i>&mdash;But lady&mdash;</p>
  <p><i>Nita.</i>.&mdash;Nay, your tongue will outstrip time, if you put not  a curb upon it. In faith, signior, I would not seem rude, but if in your  courtesy you would consent to woo some other maiden to-day, why I would strive  and bear it.</p>
  <p><i>Martino.</i>&mdash;When I stoop to woo any other lady than thee, the  moon shall hide its face from the earth, and shine upon it no more.</p>
  <p><i>Nita.</i>&mdash;Your thoughts are daring in their flight to-day.</p>
  <p><i>Martino.</i>&mdash;They are in search of your love.</p>
  <p><i>Nita.</i>&mdash;Alack, your wings will fail.</p>
  <p><i>Martino.</i>&mdash;Ay, when they reach their goal.</p>
  <p><i>Nita.</i>&mdash;Dost think to reach it?</p>
  <p><i>Martino.</i>&mdash;Shall I not, lady?</p>
  <p><i>Nita.</i>&mdash;&rsquo;Tis hard to believe it possible, yet who can tell?  You are not so handsome, signior, that one would die for you.</p>
  <p><i>Martino.</i>&mdash;No, lady; but what goes to make other men&rsquo;s faces  fair, goes to make my heart great. The virtue of my manhood rests in the fact  that I love you.</p>
  <p><i>Nita.</i>&mdash;Faith! so in some others. &lsquo;Tis the common fault of  the gallants, I find. If that is all&mdash;</p>
  <p><i>Martino.</i>&mdash;But I will always love you, even unto death.</p>
  <p><i>Nita.</i>&mdash;I doubt it not, so death come soon enough.</p>
  <p><i>Martino.</i> (<i>Taps his poiniard with his hand.</i>)&mdash;Would you  have it come now, and so prove me true to my word?</p>
  <p><i>Nita.</i> (<i>Demurely</i>).&mdash;I am no judge, to utter the doom  that your presumption merits.</p>
  <p><i>Martino.</i>&mdash;Your looks speak doom, and your sweet lips hide a sword  keener than that of justice.</p>
  <p><i>Nita.</i>&mdash;Have you tried them, signior, that you speak so  knowingly concerning them? (<i>Retreating.</i>) Your words, methinks, are  somewhat like your kisses, all breath and no substance.</p>
  <p><i>Martino.</i>&mdash;Lady! sweet one! (<i>Follows her.</i>)</p>
  <p><i>Nita.</i>&mdash;Nay, I am gone. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>
  <p><i>Martino.</i>&mdash;I were of the fools&rsquo; fold, did I fail to follow at a  beck so gentle. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>
  <p>That  was not all, but it was all that Mr. Sylvester heard. Hastily retreating, he  went out into the corridor and ere long found himself in the conservatory. He  felt shaken; felt that he could not face all this unmoved. He knew he had been  gazing at a play; that because this Florentine maiden looked at her lover with  coyness, gentleness, tenderness perhaps, it did not follow that she, his Paula,  loved the real man behind this dashing cavalier. But the possibility was there,  and in his present frame of mind could not be encountered without pain. He  dared not stay where men&rsquo;s eyes could follow him, or women&rsquo;s delicate glances  note the heaving of his chest. He had in the last three hours given himself  over so completely to hope. He realized it now though he would not have  believed it before. With man&rsquo;s usual egotism he had felt that it was only  necessary for him to come to a decision, to behold all else fall out according  to his mind. He had forgotten for the nonce the power of a youthful lover,  eager to serve, ready to wait, careful to press his way at every advantage. He  could have cursed himself for the folly of his delay, as he strode up and down among  the flowering shrubs in the solitude which the attractions of the play created.  &ldquo;Fool! fool!&rdquo; he muttered between his teeth, &ldquo;to halt on the threshold of  Paradise till the door closed in my face, when a step would have carried me  where&mdash;&rdquo; He grew dizzy as he contemplated. The goal looks never so fair as when  just within reach of a rival&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <p>A  vigorous clapping, followed by a low gush of music, woke him at last to the  realization that the little drama had terminated. With a hasty movement he was  about to return to the parlors, when he heard the low murmur of voices, and on  looking up, saw a youthful couple advancing into the conservatory, whom at  first glance he recognized for Bertram and Miss Stuyvesant. They were absorbed  in each other, and believing themselves alone, came on without fear, presenting  such a picture of love and deep, unspeakable joy, that Mr. Sylvester paused and  gazed upon them as upon the sudden embodiment of a cherished vision of his own  imaginings. Bertram was speaking ordinary words no doubt, words suited to the  occasion and the time, but his voice was attuned to the beatings of his long  repressed heart, while the bend of his proud young head and the glance of his  yearning eye were more eloquent than speech, of the leaning of his whole nature  in love and protection towards the dainty, flushing creature at his side. It  was a sight to make old hearts young and a less happy lover sick with envy. In  spite of his gratification at his nephew&rsquo;s success, Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s brow  contracted, and it was with difficulty he could subdue himself into the  appearance of calm benevolence necessary to pass them with propriety. Had it  been Paula and Mr. Ensign!</p>
  <p>He  did not know how it was that he managed to find her at last. But just as he was  beginning to realize that wisdom demanded his departure from this scene, he  suddenly came upon her sitting with her face turned toward the crowd and  waiting&mdash;for whom? He had never seen her look so beautiful, possibly because he  had never before allowed himself to gaze upon her with a lover&rsquo;s eyes. She had  exchanged her piquant Roman costume for the pearl gray satin in which Ona had  delighted to array her, and its rich substance and delicate neutral tint  harmonized well with the amber brocade of the curtain against which she sat.</p>
  <p>Power,  passion and purity breathed in her look, and lent enchantment to her form. She  was poetry&rsquo;s unique jewel, and at this moment, thought rather than merriment  sat upon her lips, and haunted her somewhat tremulous smiles. He approached her  as a priest to his shrine, but once at her side, once in view of her first  startled blush, stooped passionately, and forgetting everything but the  suspense at his heart, asked with a look and tone such as he had never before  bestowed upon her, if the play which he had seen that evening had been real, or  only the baseless fabric of a dream.</p>
  <p>She  understood him and drew back with a look almost of awe, shaking her head and  replying in a startled way, &ldquo;I do not know, I dare not say, I scarcely have  taken time to think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  take it,&rdquo; he murmured in a voice that shook her body and soul, &ldquo;for <i>I</i> must know, if <i>he</i> does not.&rdquo; And without venturing another word, or  supplying by look or gesture any explanation of his unexpected appearance, or  as equally unexpected departure, he bowed before her as if she had been a queen  instead of the child he had been wont in other days to regard her, and speedily  left her side.</p>
  <p>But  he had not taken two steps before he paused. Mr. Ensign was approaching.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Sylvester! you are worse than the old woman of the tale, who declaring she  would not, that nothing could ever induce her to&mdash;<i>did</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  utter a deeper truth than you realize,&rdquo; returned that gentleman, with a grave  emphasis meant rather for her ears than his. &ldquo;It is the curse of mortals to  overrate their strength in the face of great temptations. I am no exception to  the rule.&rdquo; And with a second bow that included this apparently triumphant lover  within its dignified sweep, he calmly proceeded upon his way, and in a few  moments had left the house.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Ensign, who for all his careless disposition, was quick to recognize depths in  others, stared after his commanding figure until he had disappeared, then  turned and looked at Paula. Why did his heart sink, and the lights and joy and  promise of the evening seem to turn dark and shrivel to nothing before his  eyes!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_33"></a>Chapter 33<br>
    Two Letters</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;I  have no other but a woman&rsquo;s reason, <br>
  I think him so, because I think him so.&rdquo;&mdash;Two  Gentlemen of Verona. </p>
  <p>A  woman who has submitted to the undivided attentions of a gentleman for any  length of time, feels herself more or less bound to him, whether any special  words of devotion have passed between them or not, particularly if from  sensitiveness of nature, she has manifested any pleasure in his society. Paula  therefore felt as if her wings had been caught in a snare, when Mr. Ensign upon  leaving her that evening, put a small note in her hand, saying that he would do  himself the pleasure of calling for his reply the next day. She did not need to  open it. She knew intuitively the manly honest words with which he would be  likely to offer his heart and life for her acceptance; yet she did open it  almost as soon as she reached her room, sitting down in her outside wraps for  the purpose. She was not disappointed. Every line was earnest, ardent, and  respectful. A true love and a happy cheerful home awaited her if&mdash;the stupendous  meaning latent in an <i>if</i>!</p>
  <p>With  folded hands lying across the white page, with glance fixed on the fire always  kept burning brightly in the grate, she sat querying her own soul and the awful  future. He was such a charming companion; life had flashed and glimmered with a  thousand lights and colors since she knew him; his very laugh made her want to  sing. With him she would move in sunshiny paths, open to the regard of all the  world, giving and receiving good. Life would need no veils and love no check. A  placid stream would bear her on through fields of smiling verdure. Dread hopes,  strange fears, uneasy doubts and vague unrests, would not disturb the heart  that rested its faith upon his frank and manly bosom. A breeze blew through his  life that would sweep all such evils from the path of her who walked in trust  and love by his side. In trust and love; ah! that was it. She trusted him, but  did she love him? At one time she had been convinced that she did, else these  past few weeks would have owned a different history. He came upon her so  brightly amid her gloom; filled her days with such genial thoughts, and drew  the surface of her soul so unconsciously after him. It was like a zephyr  sweeping over the sea; every billow that leaps to follow seems to own the power  of that passing wind. But could she think so now, since she had found that the  mere voice and look of another man had power to awaken depths such as she could  not name and scarcely as yet had been able to recognize? that though the  billows might flow under the genial smile of her young lover, the tide rose  only at the call of a deeper voice and a more imposing presence?</p>
  <p>She  was a thinking spirit and recoiled from yielding too readily to any passing  impulse. Love was a sacrament in her eyes; something entirely too precious to  be accepted in counterfeit. She must know the secret of her inclinations, must  weigh the influence that swayed her, for once given over to earth&rsquo;s sublimest  passion, she felt that it would have power to sweep her on to an eternity of  bliss or suffering.</p>
  <p>She  therefore forced herself to probe deep into the past, and pitilessly asked her  conscience, what her emotions had been in reference to Mr. Sylvester before she  positively knew that love for her as a woman had taken the place of his former  fatherly regard. Her blushing cheek seemed to answer for her. Right or wrong,  her life had never been complete away from his presence. She was lonesome and  unsatisfied. When Mr. Ensign came she thought her previous unrest was  explained, but the letter from Cicely describing Mr. Sylvester as sick and  sorrowful, had withdrawn the veil from the delusion, and though it had settled  again with Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s studied refusal to accept her devotion, was by this  evening&rsquo;s betrayal utterly wrenched away and trampled into oblivion. By every  wild throb of her heart at the sound of his voice in her ear, by every  out-reaching of her soul to enter into his every mood, by the deep sensation of  rest she felt in his presence, and the uneasy longing that absorbed her in his  absence, she knew that she loved Mr. Sylvester as she never could his younger,  blither, and perhaps nobler rival. Each word spoken by him lay treasured in her  heart of hearts. When she thought of manly beauty, his face and figure started  upon her from the surrounding shadows, making all romance possible and poetry  the truest expression of the human soul. While she lived, he must ever seem the  man of men to charm the eye, affect the heart, and move the soul. Yet she  hesitated. Why?</p>
  <p>There  is nothing so hard to acknowledge to ourselves as the presence of a blemish in  the character of those we love and long to revere. It was like giving herself  to the rack to drag from its hiding-place and confront in all its hideous  deformity, the doubt which, unconfessed perhaps, had of late mingled with her  great reverence and admiring affection for this not easily to be comprehended  man. But in this momentous hour she had power to do it. Conscience and  self-respect demanded that the image before which she was ready to bow with  such abandon, should be worthy her worship. She was not one who could carry  offerings to a clouded shrine. She must see the glory shining from between the  cherubim. &ldquo;I must worship with my spirit as well as with my body, and how can I  do that if there is a spot on his manhood, or a false note in his heart. If I  did but know the secret of his past; why the prisoner sits in the dungeon! He  is gentle, he is kindly, he loves goodness and strives to lead me in the paths  of purity and wisdom, and yet something that is not good or pure clings to him,  which he has never been able to shake loose. I perceive it in his melancholy  glance; I catch its accents in his uneven tones; it rises upon me from his most  thoughtful words, and makes his taking of a vow fearfully and warningly  significant. Yet how much he is honored by his fellow-men, and with what  reliance they look up to him for guidance and support. If I only knew the  secrets of his heart!&rdquo; thought she.</p>
  <p>It  was a trembling scale that hung balancing in that young girl&rsquo;s hand that night.  On one side, frankness, cheerfulness, manly worth, honest devotion, and a home  with every adjunct of peace and prosperity; on the other, love, gratitude,  longing, admiration, and a dark shadow enveloping all, called doubt. The scale  would not adjust itself. It tore her heart to turn from Mr. Sylvester, it  troubled her conscience to dismiss the thought of Mr. Ensign. The question was  yet undecided when she rose and began putting away her ornaments for the night.</p>
  <p>What  was there on her dressing-table that made her pause with such a start, and cast  that look of half beseeching inquiry at her own image in the glass? Only  another envelope with her name written upon it. But the way in which she took  it in her hand, and the half guilty air with which she stole back with it to  the fire, would have satisfied any looker-on I imagine, that conscience or no  conscience, debate or no debate, the writer of these lines had gained a hold  upon her heart, which no other could dispute.</p>
  <p>It  was a compactly written note and ran thus:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  man is not always responsible for what he does in moments of great suspense or  agitation. But if, upon reflection, he finds that he has spoken harshly or  acted unwisely, it is his duty to remedy his fault; and therefore it is that I  write you this little note. Paula, I love you; not as I once did, with a  fatherly longing and a protective delight, but passionately, yearningly, and  entirely, with the whole force of my somewhat disappointed life; as a man loves  for whom the world has dissolved leaving but one creature in it, and that a  woman. I showed you this too plainly to-night. I have no right to startle or  intimidate your sweet soul into any relation that might hereafter curb or  dissatisfy you; if you can love me freely, with no back-lookings to any younger  lover left behind, know that naught you could bestow, can ever equal the world  of love and feeling which I long to lavish upon you from my heart of hearts.  But if another has already won upon your affections too much for you to give an  undivided response to my appeal, then by all the purity and innocence of your  nature, forget I have ever marred the past or disturbed the present by any word  warmer than that of a father.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall not meet you at breakfast and possibly not at dinner to-morrow, but when  evening comes I shall look for my soul&rsquo;s dearer and better half, or my  childless manhood&rsquo;s nearest and most cherished friend, as God pleaseth and your  own heart and conscience shall decree.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Edward  Sylvester.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Belinda was very much surprised to be awakened early the next morning, by a  pair of loving arms clasped yearningly about her neck.</p>
  <p>Looking  up, she descried Paula kneeling beside her bed in the faint morning light, her  cheeks burning, and her eyelids drooping; and guessing perhaps how it was,  started up from her recumbent position with an energy strongly suggestive of  the charger, that smells the battle afar off.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  has happened?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You look as if you had not slept a wink.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  reply Paula pulled aside the curtain at the head of her bed, and slipped into  her hand Mr. Ensign&rsquo;s letter. Miss Belinda read it conscientiously through,  with many grunts of approval, and having finished it, laid it down with a  significant nod, after which she turned and surveyed Paula with keen but  cautious scrutiny. &ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t know what answer to give,&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should,&rdquo; said Paula, &ldquo;if&mdash;Oh aunt, you know what stands in my way! I have seen  it in your eyes for some time. There is some one else&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he has not spoken?&rdquo; vigorously ejaculated her aunt.</p>
  <p>Without  answering, Paula put into her hand, with a slow reluctance she had not  manifested before, a second little note, and then hid her head amid the  bedclothes, waiting with quickly beating heart for what her aunt might say.</p>
  <p>She  did not seem in haste to speak, but when she did, her words came with a quick  sigh that echoed very drearily in the young girl&rsquo;s anxious ears. &ldquo;You have been  placed by this in a somewhat painful position. I sympathize with you, my child.  It is very hard to give denial to a benefactor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paula&rsquo;s  head drew nearer to her aunt&rsquo;s breast, her arms crept round her neck. &ldquo;But must  I?&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
  <p>Miss  Belinda knitted her brows with great force, and stared severely at the wall  opposite. &ldquo;I am sorry there is any question about it,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
  <p>Paula  started up and looked at her with sudden determination. &ldquo;Aunt,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what  is your objection to Mr. Sylvester?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Belinda shook her head, and pushing the girl gently away, hurriedly arose and  began dressing with great rapidity. Not until she was entirely prepared for  breakfast did she draw Paula to her, and prepare to answer her question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  objection to him is, that I do not thoroughly understand him. I am afraid of  the skeleton in the closet, Paula. I never feel at ease when I am with him,  much as I admire his conversation and appreciate the undoubtedly noble  instincts of his heart. His brow is not open enough to satisfy an eye which has  accustomed itself to the study of human nature.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has had many sorrows!&rdquo; Paula faintly exclaimed, stricken by this echo of her  own doubts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  returned her aunt, &ldquo;and sorrow bows the head and darkens the eye, but it does  not make the glance wavering or its expression mysterious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  sorrows might,&rdquo; urged Paula tremulously, arguing as much with her own doubts as  with those of her aunt. &ldquo;His have been of no ordinary nature. I have never told  you, aunt, but there were circumstances attending Cousin Ona&rsquo;s death that made  it especially harrowing. He had a stormy interview with her the very morning  she was killed; words passed between them, and he left her with a look that was  almost desperate. When he next saw her, she lay lifeless and inert before him.  I sometimes think that the shadow that fell upon him at that hour will never  pass away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know what was the subject of their disagreement?&rdquo; asked Miss Belinda  anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  but I have reason to believe it had something to do with business affairs, as  nothing else could ever arouse Cousin Ona into being at all disagreeable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t like that phrase, <i>business affairs</i>; like charity, it covers  entirely too much. Have you never had any doubts yourself about Mr. Sylvester?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  you touch me to the quick, aunt. I may have had my doubts, but when I look back  on the past, I cannot see as they have any very substantial foundation.  Supposing, aunt, that he has been merely unfortunate, and I should live to find  that I had discarded one whose heart was darkened by nothing but sorrow? I  should never forgive myself, nor could life yield me any recompense that would  make amends for a sacrifice so unnecessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  love him, then, very dearly, Paula?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  sudden light fell on the young girl&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Hearts cannot tell their love,&rdquo;  said she, &ldquo;but since I received this letter from him, it has seemed as if my  life hung balancing on the question, as to whether he is worthy of a woman&rsquo;s  homage. If he is not, I would give my life to have him so. The world is only  dear to me now as it holds him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Belinda picked up Mr. Ensign&rsquo;s letter with trembling fingers. &ldquo;I thought you  were safe when the younger man came to woo,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Girls, as a rule,  prefer what is bright to what is sombre, and Mr. Ensign is truly a very  agreeable as well as worthy young man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  aunt, and he came very near stealing my heart as he undoubtedly did my fancy,  but a stronger hand snatched it away, and now I do not know what to do or how  to act, so as to awaken in the future no remorse or vain regrets.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Belinda opened the letters again and consulted their contents in a  matter-of-fact way. &ldquo;Mr. Ensign proposes to come this afternoon for his answer,  while Mr. Sylvester defers seeing you till evening. What if I seek Mr.  Sylvester this morning and have a little conversation with him, which shall  determine, for once and all, the question which so troubles us? Would you not  find it easier to meet Mr. Ensign when he comes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  talk to Mr. Sylvester, and upon such a topic! Oh, I could not bear that. Pardon  me, aunt, but I think I am more jealous of his feelings than of my own. If his  secret can be learned in a half-hour&rsquo;s talk, it must be listened to by no one  but myself. And I believe it can,&rdquo; she murmured reverently; &ldquo;he is so tender of  me he would never let me go blindfold into any path, concerning which I had  once expressed anxiety. If I ask him whether there is any good reason before  God or man why I should not give him my entire faith and homage, he will answer  honestly, though it be the destruction of his hopes to do so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you such trust as that in his uprightness as a lover, and the guardian of your  happiness?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  not you, aunt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  Miss Belinda remembering his words on the occasion of his first proposal to  adopt Paula, was forced to acknowledge that she had.</p>
  <p>So  without further preliminaries, it was agreed upon that Paula should refrain  from making a final decision until she had eased her heart by an interview with  Mr. Sylvester.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meantime,  you can request Mr. Ensign to wait another day for his answer,&rdquo; said Miss  Belinda.</p>
  <p>But  Paula with a look of astonishment shook her head. &ldquo;Is it you who would counsel  me to such a piece of coquetry as that?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;No, dear aunt, my heart is  not with Mr. Ensign, as you know, and it is impossible for me to encourage him.  If Mr. Sylvester should prove unworthy of my affection, I must bear, as best I  may, the loss which must accrue; but till he does, let me not dishonor my  womanhood by allowing hope to enter, even for a passing moment, the breast of  his rival.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Belinda blushed, and drew her niece fondly towards her. &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said  she, &ldquo;and my great desire for your happiness has led me into error. Honesty is  the noblest adjunct of all true love, and must never be sacrificed to  considerations of selfish expediency. The refusal which you contemplate  bestowing upon Mr. Ensign, must be forwarded to him at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  with a final embrace, in which Miss Belinda allowed herself to let fall some  few natural tears of disappointment, she dismissed the young girl to her task.</p>

    Paula Makes Her Choice</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Good  fortune then, <br>
To make me bless&rsquo;t or cursed&rsquo;st among men.&rdquo;&mdash;Merchant of Venice. </p>
  <p>It  was evening in the Sylvester mansion. Mr. Sylvester who, according to his understanding  with Paula, had been absent from his home all day, had just come in and now  stood in his library waiting for the coming footfall that should decide whether  the future held for him any promise of joy.</p>
  <p>He  had never looked more worthy of a woman&rsquo;s regard than he did that night. A  matter that had been troubling him for some time had just been satisfactorily  disposed of, and not a shadow, so far as he knew, lay upon his business  outlook. This naturally brightened his cheek and lent a light to his eye. Then,  hope is no mean beautifier, and this he possessed notwithstanding the disparity  of years between himself and Paula. It was not, however, of sufficiently  assured a nature to prevent him from starting at every sound from above, and  flushing with quite a disagreeable sense of betrayal when the door opened and  Bertram entered the room, instead of the gentle and exquisite being he had  expected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle,  I am so full of happiness, I had to stop and bestow a portion of it upon you.  Do you think any one could mistake the nature of Miss Stuyvesant&rsquo;s feelings,  who saw her last night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo;  was the smiling reply. &ldquo;At all events I have not felt like wasting much but  pleasant sympathy upon you. Your pathway to happiness looks secure, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  nephew gave him a wistful glance, but hid his thought whatever it was. &ldquo;I am  going to see her to-night,&rdquo; remarked he. &ldquo;I am afraid my love is something like  a torrent that has once burst its barrier; it cannot rest until it has worked  its channel and won its rightful repose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is something the way with all love,&rdquo; returned his uncle. &ldquo;It may be dallied  with while asleep, but once aroused, better meet a lion in his fury or a  tempest in its rush. Are you going to test your hope, to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man flushed. &ldquo;I cannot say.&rdquo; But in another moment gayly added, &ldquo;I only  know that I am prepared for any emergency.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  my boy, I wish you God-speed. If ever a man has won a right to happiness, you  are that man; and you shall enjoy it too, if any word or action of mine can  serve to advance it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you!&rdquo; replied Bertram, and with a bright look around the apartment, prepared to  take his leave. &ldquo;When I come back,&rdquo; he remarked, with a touch of that manly <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> to which I have before alluded, &ldquo;I hope I shall not find you alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ignoring  this wish which was re-echoed somewhat too deeply within his own breast for  light expression, Mr. Sylvester accompanied his nephew to the front door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us see what kind of a night it is,&rdquo; observed he, stepping out upon the stoop. &ldquo;It  is going to rain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  it is,&rdquo; returned Bertram, with a quick glance overhead; &ldquo;but I shall not let  such a little fuss as that deter me from fulfilling my engagement.&rdquo; And  bestowing a hasty nod upon his uncle, he bounded down the step.</p>
  <p>Instantly  a man who was loitering along the walk in front of the house, stopped, as if  struck by these simple words, turned, gave Bertram a quick look, and then with  a sly glance back at the open door where Mr. Sylvester still stood gazing at  the lowering heavens, set himself cautiously to follow him.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester, who was too much pre-occupied to observe this suspicious action,  remained for a moment contemplating the sky; then with an aimless glance down  the avenue, during which his eye undoubtedly fell upon Bertram and the creeping  shadow of a man behind him, closed the door and returned to the library.</p>
  <p>The  sight of another&rsquo;s joy has the tendency to either unduly depress the spirits or  greatly to elate them. When Paula came into the room a few minutes later, it  was to find Mr. Sylvester awaiting her with an expression that was almost  radiant. It made her duty seem doubly hard, and she came forward with the slow  step of one who goes to meet or carry doom. He saw, and instantly the light  died out of his face, leaving it one blank of despair. But controlling himself,  he took her cold hand in his, and looking down upon her with a tender but  veiled regard, asked in those low and tremulous tones that exerted such an  influence upon her:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  I see before me my affectionate and much to be cherished child, or that still  dearer object of love and worship, which it shall be the delight of my life to  render truly and deeply happy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see,&rdquo; returned she, after a moment of silent emotion, &ldquo;a girl without father or  brother to advise her; who loves, or believes she does, a great and noble man,  but who is smitten with fear also, she cannot tell why, and trembles to take a  step to which no loving and devoted friend has set the seal of his approval.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  clasp with which Mr. Sylvester held her hand in his, tightened for an instant  with irrepressible emotion, then slowly unloosed. Drawing back, he surveyed her  with eyes that slowly filled with a bitter comprehension of her meaning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are the only man,&rdquo; continued she, with a glance of humble entreaty, &ldquo;that has  ever stood to me for a moment in the light of a relation. You <i>have</i> been  a father to me in days gone by, and to you it therefore seems most natural for  me to appeal when a question comes up that either puzzles or distresses me. Mr.  Sylvester, you have offered me your love and the refuge of your home; if you  say that in your judgment the counsel of all true friends would be for me to  accept this love, then my hand is yours and with it my heart; a heart that only  hesitates because it would fain be sure it has the smile of heaven upon its  every prompting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  voice was so strange she looked up to see if it really was Mr. Sylvester who  spoke. He had sunk back into a chair and had covered his face with his hands.  With a cry she moved towards him, but he motioned her back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Condemned  to be my own executioner!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Placed on the rack and bid to turn the  wheel that shall wrench my own sinews! My God, &lsquo;tis hard!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  did not hear the words, but she saw the action. Slowly the blood left her  cheek, and her hand fell upon her swelling breast with a despairing gesture  that would have smitten Miss Belinda to the heart, could she have seen it. &ldquo;I  have asked too much,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
  <p>With  a start Mr. Sylvester rose. &ldquo;Paula,&rdquo; said he, in a stern and different tone, &ldquo;is  this fear of which you speak, the offspring of your own instincts, or has it  been engendered in your breast by the words of another?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  Aunt Belinda is in my confidence, if it is she to whom you allude,&rdquo; rejoined  she, meeting his glance fully and bravely. &ldquo;But from no lips but yours could  any words proceed capable of affecting my estimate of you as the one best  qualified to make me happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  it is my words alone that have awakened this doubt, this apprehension?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have not spoken of doubt,&rdquo; said she, but her eyelids fell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thank God!&rdquo; he passionately exclaimed. &ldquo;And yet you feel it,&rdquo; he went on more  composedly. &ldquo;I have studied your face too long and closely not to understand  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  put out her hands in appeal, but for once it passed unheeded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;you must tell me just what that doubt is; I must know what is passing  in your mind. You say you love me&mdash;&rdquo; he paused, and a tremble shook him from  head to foot, but he went inexorably on&mdash;&ldquo;it is more than I had a right to  expect, and God knows I am grateful for the precious and inestimable boon, far  as it is above my deserts; but while loving me, you hesitate to give me your  hand. Why? What is the name of the doubt that disturbs that pure breast and  affects your choice? Tell me, I must know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  ask me to dissect my own heart!&rdquo; she cried, quivering under the torture of his  glance; &ldquo;how can I? What do I know of its secret springs or the terrors that  disturb its even beatings? I cannot name my fear; it has no name, or if it  has&mdash;Oh, sir!&rdquo; she cried in a burst of passionate longing, &ldquo;your life has been  one of sorrow and disappointment; grief has touched you close, and you might  well be the melancholy and sombre man that all behold. I do not shrink from  grief; say that the only shadow that lies across your dungeon-door is that cast  by the great and heart-rending sorrows of your life, and without question and  without fear I enter that dungeon with you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  hand he raised stopped her. &ldquo;Paula,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;do you believe in repentance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  words struck her like a blow. Falling slowly back, she looked at him for an  instant, then her head sank on her breast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know what your hatred of sin is,&rdquo; continued he. &ldquo;I have seen your whole form  tremble at the thought of evil. Is your belief in the redeeming power of God as  great as your recoil from the wrong that makes that redemption necessary?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Quickly  her head raised, a light fell on her brow, and her lips moved in a vain effort  to utter what her eyes unconsciously expressed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula,  I would be unworthy the name of a man, if with the consciousness of possessing  a dark and evil nature, I strove by use of any hypocrisy or specious pretense  at goodness, to lure to my side one so exceptionally pure, beautiful and  high-minded. The ravening wolf and the innocent lamb would be nothing to it.  Neither would I for an instant be esteemed worthy of your regard, if in this  hour of my wooing there remained in my life the shadow of any latent wrong that  might hereafter rise up and overwhelm you. Whatever of wrong has ever been  committed by me&mdash;and it is my punishment that I must acknowledge before your  pure eyes that my soul is not spotless&mdash;was done in the past, and is known only  to my own heart and the God who I reverently trust has long ago pardoned me.  The shadow is that of remorse, not of fear, and the evil, one against my own  soul, rather than against the life or fortunes of other men. Paula, such sins  can be forgiven if one has a mind to comprehend the temptations that beset men  in their early struggles. I have never forgiven myself, but&mdash;&rdquo; He paused, looked  at her for an instant, his hand clenched over his heart, his whole noble form  shaken by struggle, then said&mdash;&ldquo;forgiveness implies no promise, Paula; you shall  never link yourself to a man who has been obliged to bow his head in shame  before you, but by the mercy that informs that dear glance and trembling lip,  do you think you can ever grow to forgive me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  she cried, with a burst of sobs, violent as her grief and shame, &ldquo;God be  merciful to me, as I am merciful to those who repent of their sins and do good  and not evil all the remaining days of their life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you would <i>forgive</i> me,&rdquo; murmured he, looking down upon her, as  the miser eyes the gold that has slipped from his paralyzed hand. &ldquo;Him whom the  hard-hearted sinner and the hypocrite despise, God&rsquo;s dearest lambs regard with  mercy. I learned to revere God before I knew you, Paula, but I learned to love  Him in the light of your gentleness and your trust. Rise up now and let me wipe  away your tears&mdash;my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  sprang up as if stung. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;not that; I cannot bear that yet.  I must think, I must know what all this means,&rdquo; and she laid her hand upon her  heart. &ldquo;God surely does not give so much love for one&rsquo;s undoing; if I were not  destined to comfort a life so saddened, He would have bequeathed me more pity  and less&mdash;&rdquo; The lifted head fell, the word she would have uttered, stirred her  bosom, but not her lips.</p>
  <p>It  was a trial to his strength, but his firm man&rsquo;s heart did not waver. &ldquo;You do  comfort me,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;from early morning to late night your presence is my  healing and my help, and will always be so, whatever may befal. A daughter can  do much, my Paula.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  took a step back towards the door, her eyes, dark with unfathomable impulses,  flashing on him through the tears that hung thickly on her lashes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it for your own sake or for mine, that you make use of that word?&rdquo; said she.</p>
  <p>He  summoned up his courage, met that searching glance with all its wild,  bewildering beauty, and responded, &ldquo;Can you ask, Paula?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a lift of her head that gave an almost queenly stateliness to her form, she  advanced a step, and drawing a crumpled paper from her pocket, said, &ldquo;When I  went to my room last night, it was to read <i>two</i> letters, one from  yourself, and one from Mr. Ensign. This is his, and a manly and noble letter it  is too; but hearts have right to hearts, and I was obliged to refuse his  petition.&rdquo; And with a reverent but inexorable hand, she dropped the letter on  the burning coals of the grate at their side, and softly turned to leave the  room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula!&rdquo;  With a bound the stern and hitherto forcibly repressed man, leaped to her side.  &ldquo;My darling! my life!&rdquo; and with a wild, uncontrollable impulse, he caught her  for one breathless moment to his heart; then as suddenly released her, and  laying his hand in reverence on her brow, said softly, &ldquo;Now go and pray, little  one; and when you are quite calm, an hour hence or a week hence whichever it  may be, come and tell me my fate as God and the angels reveal it to you.&rdquo; And  he smiled, and she saw his smile, and went out of the room softly, as one who  treadeth upon holy ground.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester was considered by his friends and admirers as a proud man. If a vote  had been cast among those who knew him best, as from what especial passion  common to humanity he would soonest recoil, it would have been unanimously  pronounced shame, and his own hand would have emphasized the judgment of his  fellows. But shame which is open to the gaze of the whole world, differs from  that which is sacred to the eyes of one human being, and that the one who lies  nearest the heart.</p>
  <p>As  Paula&rsquo;s retreating footsteps died away on the stairs, and he awoke to the full  consciousness that his secret was shared by her whose love was his life, and  whose good opinion had been his incentive and his pride, his first sensation  was one of unmitigated anguish, but his next, strange to say, that of a restful  relief. He had cast aside the cloak he had hugged so closely to his breast  these many years, and displayed to her shrinking gaze the fox that was gnawing  at his vitals; and Spartan though he was, the dew that had filled her loving  eyes was balm to him. And not only that; he had won claim to the title of true  man. Her regard, if regard it remained, was no longer an airy fabric built upon  a plausible seeming, but a firm structure with knowledge for its foundation. &ldquo;I  shall not live to whisper, &lsquo;If she knew my whole life, would she love me so  well?&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  first marriage had been so wholly uncongenial and devoid of sympathy, that his  greatest longing in connection with a fresh contract, was to enjoy the full  happiness of perfect union and mutual trust; and though he could never have  summoned up courage to take her into his confidence, unsolicited, now that it  had been done he would not have it undone, no, not if by the doing he had lost  her confidence and affection.</p>
  <p>But  something told him he had not lost it. That out of the darkness and the shock  of this very discovery, a new and deeper love would spring, which having its  birth in human frailty and human repentance, would gain in the actual what it  lost in the ideal, bringing to his weary, suffering and yearning man&rsquo;s nature,  the honest help of a strong and loving sympathy, growing trust, and sweetest  because wisest encouragement.</p>
  <p>It  was therefore, with a growing sense of deep unfathomable comfort, and a  reverent thankfulness for the mercies of God, that he sat by the fire idly  watching the rise and fall of the golden flames above the fluttering ashes of  his rival&rsquo;s letter, and dreaming with a hallowing sense of his unworthiness,  upon the possible bliss of coming days. Happiness in its truest and most serene  sense was so new to him, it affected him like the presence of something  strangely commanding. He was awe-struck before it, and unconsciously bowed his  head at its contemplation. Only his eyes betrayed the peace that comes with all  great joy, his eyes and perhaps the faint, almost unearthly smile that flitted  across his mouth, disturbing its firm line and making his face for all its  inevitable expression of melancholy, one that his mother would have loved to  look upon. &ldquo;Paula!&rdquo; came now and then in a reverent, yearning accent from  between his lips, and once a low, &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; which showed that he was  praying.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  he rose; a more human mood had set in, and he felt the necessity of assuring  himself that it was really he upon whom the dreary past had closed, and a  future of such possible brightness opened. He walked about the room, surveying  the rich articles within it, as the possible belongings of the beautiful woman  he adored; he stood and pictured her as coming into the door as his wife, and  before he realized what he was doing, had planned certain changes he would make  in his home to adapt it to the wants of her young and growing mind, when with a  strange suddenness, the door upon which he was gazing flew back, and Bertram  Sylvester entered just as he had come from the street. He looked so haggard, so  wild, so little the picture of himself as he ventured forth a couple of hours  before, that Mr. Sylvester started, and forgetting his happiness in his alarm,  asked in a tone of dismay:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  has happened? Has Miss Stuyvesant&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bertram&rsquo;s  hand went up as if his uncle had touched him upon a festering wound. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;  gasped he, and advancing to the table, sat down and buried his face for a  moment in his arms, then rose, and summoning up a certain manly dignity that  became him well, met Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s eye with forced calmness, and inquired:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you know there was a thief in our bank, Uncle Edward?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_35"></a>Chapter 35<br>
    The Falling Of The Sword</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Foul  deeds will rise, <br>
  Though all the world o&rsquo;erwhelm them, to men&rsquo;s eyes.&rdquo;&mdash;Hamlet. </p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester towered on his nephew with an expression such as few men had ever  seen even on his powerful and commanding face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; asked he, and his voice rang like a clarion through the room.</p>
  <p>Bertram  trembled and for a moment stood aghast, the ready flush bathing his brow with  burning crimson. &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; stammered he, with difficulty recovering himself, &ldquo;that  when Mr. Stuyvesant came to open his private box in the bank to-day, that he  not only found its lock had been tampered with, but that money and valuables to  the amount of some twelve hundred dollars were missing from among its contents.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  expression which had made Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s brow so terrible had vanished, but  his wonder remained.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is impossible,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Our vaults are too well watched for any such  thing to occur. He has made some mistake; a robbery of that nature could not  take place without detection.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would seem not, and yet the fact remains. Mr. Stuyvesant himself informed me of  it, to-night. He is not a careless man, nor reckless in his statements. Some  one has robbed the bank and it remains with us to find out who.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester, who had been standing all this while, sat down like a man dazed, the  wild lost look on Bertram&rsquo;s face daunting him with a fearful premonition. &ldquo;There  are but four men who have access to the vault where the boxes are kept,&rdquo; said  he: then quickly, &ldquo;Why did Mr. Stuyvesant wait till to-night to speak to you?  Why did he not notify us at once of a loss so important for us to know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  flush on Bertram&rsquo;s brow slowly subsided, giving way to a steady pallor. &ldquo;He  waited to be sure,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;He had a memorandum at home which he desired to  consult; he was not ready to make any rash statement: he is a thinking man and  more considerate than many of his friends are apt to imagine. If the lock had  not been found open he would have thought with you that he had made some  mistake; if he had not missed from the box some of its contents, he would have  considered the condition of the lock the result of some oversight on his own  part or of some mistake on the part of another, but the two facts together were  damning and could force upon him but one conclusion. Uncle,&rdquo; said he, with a  straightforward look into Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s countenance, &ldquo;Mr. Stuyvesant knows as  well as we do who are the men who have access to the vaults. As you say, the opening  of a box during business hours and the abstracting from it of papers or  valuables by any one who has not such access, would be impossible. Only  Hopgood, you and myself, and possibly Folger, could find either time or  opportunity for such a piece of work; while after business hours, the same  four, minus Folger who contents himself with knowing the combination of the  inner safe, could open the vaults even in case of an emergency. Now of the four  named, two are above suspicion. I might almost say three, for Hopgood is not a  man it is easy to mistrust. One alone, then, of all the men whom Mr. Stuyvesant  is in the habit of meeting at the Bank, is open to a doubt. A young man, uncle,  whose rising has been rapid, whose hopes have been lofty, whose life may or may  not be known to himself as pure, but which in the eyes of a matured man of the  world might easily be questioned, just because its hopes are so lofty and its  means for attaining them so limited.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertram!&rdquo;  sprang from Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s white lips.</p>
  <p>But  the young man raised his hand with almost a commanding gesture. &ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; said  he, &ldquo;no sympathy or surprise. Facts like these have to be met with silent  endurance, as we walk up to the mouth of the cannon we cannot evade, or bare  our breast to the thrust of the bayonet gleaming before our eyes.&mdash;I would not  have you think,&rdquo; he somewhat hurriedly pursued, &ldquo;that Mr. Stuyvesant insinuated  anything of the kind, but his daughter was not present in the parlor, and&mdash;&rdquo; A  sigh, almost a gasp finished the sentence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertram!&rdquo;  again exclaimed his uncle, this time with some authority in his voice. &ldquo;The  shock of this discovery has unnerved you. You act like a man capable of being  suspected. That is simply preposterous. One half hour&rsquo;s conversation with Mr.  Stuyvesant on my part will convince him, if he needs convincing, which I do not  believe, that whoever is unworthy of trust in our bank, you are not the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bertram  raised his head with a gleam of hope, but instantly dropped it again with a  despairing gesture that made his uncle frown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not know that you were inclined to be so pusillanimous,&rdquo; cried Mr.  Sylvester; &ldquo;and in presence of a foe so unsubstantial as this you have conjured  up almost out of nothing. If the bank has been robbed, it cannot be difficult  to find the thief. I will order in detectives to-morrow. We will hold a board  of inquiry, and the culprit shall be unmasked; that is, if he is one of the  employees of the bank, which it is very hard to believe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very,  and which, if true, would make it unadvisable in us to give the alarm that any  public measures taken could not fail to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  inquiry shall be private, and the detectives, men who can be trusted to keep  their business secret.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can any inquiry be private? Uncle, we are treading on delicate ground, and have  a task before us requiring great tact and discretion. If the safe had only been  assaulted, or there were any evidences of burglary to be seen! But we surely  should have heard of it from some one of the men, if anything unusual had been  observed. Hopgood would have spoken at least.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Hopgood would have spoken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  tone in which this was uttered made Bertram look up. &ldquo;You agree with me, then,  that Hopgood is absolutely to be relied upon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;  A faint flush on Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s face lent force to this statement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  could not be beguiled or forced by another man to reveal the combination, or to  relax his watch over the vaults entrusted to his keeping?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is alone with the vaults where the boxes are kept for an hour or two in the  early morning!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and has been for three years. Hopgood is honesty itself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so are Folger and Jessup and Watson,&rdquo; exclaimed Bertram emphatically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  his uncle admitted, with equal emphasis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a mystery,&rdquo; Bertram declared; &ldquo;and one I fear that will undo me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;  broke forth somewhat impatiently from Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s lips; &ldquo;there is no reason  at this time for any such conclusion. If there is a thief in the bank he can be  found; if the robbery was committed by an outsider, he may still be discovered.  If he is not, if the mystery rests forever unexplained, you have your  character, Bertram, a character as spotless as that of any of your fellows,  whom we regard as above suspicion. A man is not going to be condemned by such a  judge of human nature as Mr. Stuyvesant, just because a mysterious crime has  been committed, to which the circumstances of his position alone render it  possible for him to be party. You might as well say that Jessup and Folger and  Watson&mdash;yes, or myself, would in that case lose his confidence. They are in the  bank, and are constantly in the habit of going to the vaults.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None  of those gentlemen want to marry his daughter,&rdquo; murmured Bertram. &ldquo;It is not  the director I fear, but the father. I have so little to bring her. Only my  character and my devotion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  well, pluck up courage, my boy. I have hopes yet that the whole matter can be  referred to some mistake easily explainable when once it is discovered.  Mistakes, even amongst the honest and the judicious, are not so uncommon as one  is apt to imagine. I, myself, have known of one which if providence had not  interfered, might have led to doubts seemingly as inconsistent as yours.  To-morrow we will consider the question at length. To-night&mdash;Well, Bertram, what  is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man started and dropped his eyes, which during the last words of his  uncle had been fixed upon his face with strange and penetrating inquiry. &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;that is, nothing more;&rdquo; and rose as if to leave.</p>
  <p>But  Mr. Sylvester put out his hand and stopped him. &ldquo;There <i>is</i> something,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;I have seen it in your face ever since you entered this room. What is  it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man drew a deep breath and leaned back in his chair. Mr. Sylvester  watched him with growing pallor. &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; murmured his nephew at last; &ldquo;there  is something more, and it is only justice that you should hear it. I have had  two adventures to-night; one quite apart from my conversation with Mr.  Stuyvesant. Heaven that watches above us, has seen fit to accumulate difficulties  in my path, and this last, perhaps, is the least explainable and the hardest to  encounter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you allude to?&rdquo; cried his uncle, imperatively; &ldquo;I have had an evening of too  much agitation to endure suspense with equanimity. Explain yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will not take long,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;a few words will reveal to you the  position in which I stand. Let me relate it in the form of a narrative. You  know what a dark portion of the block that is in which Mr. Stuyvesant&rsquo;s house  is situated. A man might hide in any of the areas along there, without being  observed by you unless he made some sound to attract your attention. I was,  therefore, more alarmed than surprised when, shortly after leaving Mr.  Stuyvesant&rsquo;s dwelling, I felt a hand laid on my shoulder, and turning, beheld a  dark figure at my side, of an appearance calculated to arouse any man&rsquo;s  apprehension. He was tall, unkempt, with profuse beard, and eyes that glared  even in the darkness of his surroundings, with a feverish intensity. &lsquo;You are  Mr. Sylvester,&rsquo; said he, with a look of a wild animal ready to pounce upon his  prey. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I, involuntarily stepping back, &lsquo;I am Mr. Sylvester.&rsquo; &lsquo;I want  to speak to you,&rsquo; exclaimed he, with a rush of words as though a stream had  broken loose; &lsquo;now, at once, on business that concerns you. Will you listen?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought of the only business that seemed to concern me then, and starting still  farther back, surveyed him with surprise. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know you,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;what  business can you have with me?&rsquo; &lsquo;Will you step into some place where it is warm  and find out?&rsquo; he asked, shivering in his thin cloak, but not abating a jot of  his eagerness. &lsquo;Go on before me,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and we will see.&rsquo; He complied at  once, and in this way we reached Beale&rsquo;s Coffee-Room, where we went in. &lsquo;Now,&rsquo;  said I, &lsquo;out with what you have to say and be quick about it. I have no time to  listen to nonsense and no heart to attend to it.&rsquo; His eye brightened; he did  not cast a glance at the smoking victuals about him, though I knew he was  hungry as a dog. &lsquo;It is no nonsense,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that I have to communicate to  you.&rsquo; And then I saw he had once been a gentleman. &lsquo;For two years and a half  have I been searching for you,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;in order that I might recall to  your mind a little incident. You remember the afternoon of February, the  twenty-fifth, two years ago?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo;  said I, in great surprise, for his whole countenance was flushed with  expectancy. &lsquo;What was there about that day that I should remember it?&rsquo; He  smiled and bent his face nearer to mine. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you recollect a little  conversation you had in a small eating-house in Dey Street, with a gentleman of  a high-sounding voice to whom you were obliged continually to say &lsquo;hush!&rsquo;&ldquo; I  stared at the man, as you may believe, with some notion of his being a wandering  lunatic. &lsquo;I have never taken a meal in any eating-house in Dey Street,&rsquo; I  declared, motioning to a waiter to approach us. The man observing it, turned  swiftly upon me. &lsquo;Do you think I care for any such petty <i>fuss</i> as that?&rsquo;  asked he, indicating the rather slightly built man I had called to my rescue,  while he covertly studied my face to observe the effect of his words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  started. I could not help it; this use of an expression almost peculiar to  myself, assured me that the man knew me better than I supposed. Involuntarily I  waved the waiter back and turned upon the man with an inquiring look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I  thought you might consider it worth your while to listen,&rsquo; said he, smiling  with the air of one who has or thinks he has a grip upon you. Then suddenly, &lsquo;You  are a rich man, are you not? a proud man and an honored one. You hold a  position of trust and are considered worthy of it; how would you like men to  know that you once committed a mean and dirty trick; that those white hands  that have the handling of such large funds at present, have in days gone by  been known to dip into such funds a little too deeply; that, in short, you,  Bertram Sylvester, cashier of the Madison Bank, and looking forward to no one  knows what future honors and emoluments, have been in a position better suited  to a felon&rsquo;s cell than the trusted agent of a great and wealthy corporation?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not collar him; I was too dumb-stricken for any such display of  indignation. I simply stared, feeling somewhat alarmed as I remembered my late  interview with Mr. Stuyvesant, and considered the possibility of a plot being  formed against me. He smiled again at the effect he had produced, and drew me  into a corner of the room where we sat down. &lsquo;I am going to tell you a story,&rsquo;  said he, &lsquo;just to show you what a good memory I have. One day, a year and more  ago, I sauntered into an eating-house on Dey Street. I have not always been  what you see me now, though to tell you the truth, I was but little better off  at the time of which I speak, except that I did have a dime or so in my pocket,  and could buy a meal of victuals&mdash;if I wished.&rsquo; And his eyes roamed for the  first time to the tables stretching out before him down the room. &lsquo;The  proprietor was an acquaintance of mine, and finding I was sleepy as well as hungry,  let me go into a certain dark pantry, where I curled up amid all sorts of old  rubbish and went to sleep. I was awakened by the sound of voices talking very  earnestly. The closet in which I was hidden was a temporary affair built up of  loose boards, and the talk of a couple of men seated against it was easy enough  to be heard. Do you want to know what that conversation was?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  curiosity was roused by this time and I said yes. If this was a plot to extort  money from me, it was undeniably better for me to know upon just what  foundations it rested. I thought the man looked surprised, but with an aplomb  difficult to believe assumed, he went on to say, &lsquo;The voices gave me my only  means of judging of the age, character, or position of the men conversing, but  I have a quick ear, and my memory is never at fault. From the slow, broken,  nervously anxious tone of one of the men, I made up my mind that he was  elderly, hard up, and not over scrupulous; the other voice was that of a  gentleman, musical and yet pronounced, and not easily forgotten, as you see,  sir. The first words I heard aroused me and convinced me it was worth while to  listen. They were uttered by the gentleman. &lsquo;You come to me with such a dirty  piece of business! What right have you to suppose I would hearken to you for an  instant!&rsquo; &lsquo;The right,&rsquo; returned the other, &lsquo;of knowing you have not been above  doing dirty work in your life time.&rsquo; The partition creaked at that, as though  one of the two had started forward, but I didn&rsquo;t hear any reply made to this  strange accusation. &lsquo;Do you think,&rsquo; the same voice went on, &lsquo;that I do not know  where the five thousand dollars came from which you gave me for that first  speculation? I knew it when I took it, and if I hadn&rsquo;t been sure the operation  would turn out fortunately, you would never have been the man you are to-day.  It came out of funds entrusted to you, and was not the gift of a relative as  you would have made me believe.&rsquo; &lsquo;Good heaven!&rsquo; exclaimed the other, after a  silence that was very expressive just then and there, &lsquo;and you let me&mdash;&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh we  won&rsquo;t go into that,&rsquo; interrupted the less cultivated voice. &lsquo;All you wanted was  a start, to make you the successful man you have since become. I never worried  much about morals, and I don&rsquo;t worry about them now, only when you say you won&rsquo;t  do a thing likely to make my fortune, just because it is not entirely free from  reproach, I say, remember what I know about you, and don&rsquo;t talk virtue to me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I  am rightly punished,&rsquo; came from the other, in a tone that proved him to be a  man more ready to do a wrong thing than to face the accusation of it. &lsquo;If I  ever did what you suppose, the repentance that has embittered all my success,  and the position in which you have this day placed me, is surely an ample  atonement.&rsquo; &lsquo;Will you do what I request?&rsquo; inquired the other, giving little  heed to this expression of misery, of which I on the contrary took special  heed. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; was the energetic reply; &lsquo;because I am not spotless it is no sign  that I will wade into filth. I will give you money as I have done scores of  times before, but I will lend my hand to no scheme which is likely to throw  discredit on me or mine. Were you not connected to me in the way in which you  are&mdash;&rsquo; &lsquo;You would pursue the scheme,&rsquo; interrupted the other; &lsquo;it is because you  know that I cannot talk, that you dare repudiate it. Well I will go to one&mdash;&rsquo; &lsquo;You  shall not,&rsquo; came in short quick tones, just such tones as you used to me, sir,  when we first entered this room. &lsquo;You shall leave the country before you do  anything more, or say anything more, to compromise me or yourself. I may have  done wrong in my day, but that is no reason why I should suffer for it at your  hands, tempter of youth, and deceiver of your own flesh and blood! <i>You</i> shall never bring back those days to me again; they are buried, and have been  stamped out of sight by many an honest dealing since, and many as I trust  before God, good and sterling action. I have long since begun a new life; a  life of honor, and pure, if successful, dealing. Not only my own happiness, but  that of one who should be considered by you, depends upon my maintaining that  life to the end, unshadowed by unholy remembrances, and unharrassed by any such  proffers as you have presumed to make to me here to-day. If you want a few  thousand dollars to leave the country, say so, but never again presume to  offend my ears, or those of any one else we may know, with any such words as  you have made use of to-day.&rsquo; And the spiritless creature subsided, sir, and  said no more to that rich, honored, and successful man who was so sensitive to  even the imputation of guilt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I am not spiritless and just where he dropped the affair, I took it up. &lsquo;Here  is a chance for me to turn an honest penny,&rsquo; thought I, and with a deliberation  little to be expected of me, perhaps, set myself to spot that man and make the  most out of the matter I could. Unfortunately I lost the opportunity of seeing  his face. I was too anxious to catch every word they uttered, to quit my place  of concealment till their conversation was concluded, and then I was too late  to be sure which of the many men leaving the building before me was the one I  was after. The waiters were too busy to talk, and the proprietor himself had  taken no notice. Happily as I have before said, I never forget voices; moreover  one of the two speakers had made use of a phrase peculiar enough to serve as a  clue to his identity. It was in answer to some parting threat of the older man,  and will remind you of an expression uttered by yourself an hour or so ago. &lsquo;Do  you suppose I will let such a little fuss as that deter me?&rsquo; It was the cue to  his speech, by which I intended to hunt out my man from amongst the rich, the  trusted and the influential persons of this city, and when found, to hold him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And  you think you have done this?&rsquo; said I, too conscious of the possible net about  my feet to be simply angry. &lsquo;I know it,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;every word you have uttered  since we have been here has made me more and more certain of the fact. I could  swear to your voice, and as to your use of that tell-tale word, it was not till  I thought to inquire of a certain wide-awake fellow down town, who amongst our  business men were in the habit of using that expression, and was told Mr.  Sylvester of the Madison Bank, that I was enabled to track you. I know I have  got my hand on my man at last and&mdash;&rsquo; He looked down at his thread-bare coat and  around at the tables with their smoking dishes, and left me to draw my own  conclusion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle,  there are crises in life which no former experience teaches you how to meet. I  had arrived at such a one. Perhaps you can understand me when I say I was well  nigh appalled. Denial of what was imputed to me might be wisdom and might not.  I felt the coil of a deadly serpent about me, and knew not whether it was best  to struggle or to simply submit. The man noted the effect he had made and  complacently folded his arms. He was of a nervous organization and possessed an  eye like a hungry wolf, but he could wait. &lsquo;This is a pretty story,&rsquo; said I at  last, and I reject it altogether. &lsquo;I am an honest man and have always been so;  you will have to give up your hopes of making anything out of me.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then you  are willing,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that I should repeat this story to one of the directors  of your bank, whom I know?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  looked at him; he returned my gaze with a cold nonchalence more suggestive of a  deep laid purpose, than even his previous glance of feverish determination. I  immediately let my eye run over his scanty clothing and loose flowing hair and  beard. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I, with as much sarcasm as I knew how to assume, &lsquo;if you  dare risk the consequences, I think I may.&rsquo; He at once drew himself up. &lsquo;You  think,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that you have a common-place adventurer to deal with; that my  appearance is going to testify in your favor; that you have but to deny any  accusation which such a hungry-looking, tattered wretch as I, may make, and  that I shall be ignominiously kicked out of the presence into which I have  forced myself; that in short I have been building my castle in the air. Mr.  Sylvester, I am a poor devil but I am no fool. When I left Dey Street on the  twenty-fifth of February two years ago, it was with a sealed paper in my  pocket, in which was inscribed all that I had heard on that day. This I took to  a lawyer&rsquo;s office, and not being, as I have before said, quite as impecunious  in those days as at present, succeeded in getting the lawyer, whom I took care  should be a most respectable man, to draw up a paper to the effect that I had  entrusted him with this statement&mdash;of whose contents he however knew nothing&mdash;on  such a day and hour, to which paper a gentleman then present, consented at my  respectful solicitation to affix his name as witness, which gentleman, strange  to say, has since proved to be a director of the bank of which you are the present  cashier, and consequently the very man of all others best adapted to open the  paper whose seal you profess to be so willing to see broken.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;His  name!&rsquo; It was all that I could say. &lsquo;Stuyvesant,&rsquo; cried the man, fixing me with  his eye in which I in vain sought for some signs of secret doubt or unconscious  wavering. I rose; the position in which I found myself was too overwhelming for  instant decision. I needed time for reflection, possibly advice&mdash;from you. A  resolution to brave the devil must be founded on something more solid than  impulse, to hold its own unmoved. I only stopped to utter one final word and  ask one leading question. &lsquo;You are a smart man,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and you are also a  villain. Your smartness would give you food and drink, if you exercised it in a  manner worthy of a man, but your villainy if persisted in, will eventually rob  you of both, and bring you to the prison&rsquo;s cell or the hangman&rsquo;s gallows. As  for myself, I persist in saying that I am now and always have been an honest  man, whatever you may have overheard or find yourself capable of swearing to.  Yet a lie is an inconvenient thing to have uttered against you at any time, and  I may want to see you again; if I do, where shall I find you?&rsquo; He thrust his  hand into his pocket and drew out a small slip of folded paper, which he passed  to me with a bow that Chesterfield would have admired. &lsquo;You will find it  written within,&rsquo; said he &lsquo;I shall look for you any time to-morrow, up to seven  o&rsquo;clock. At that hour the lawyer of whom I have spoken, sends the statement  which he has in his possession to Mr. Stuyvesant.&rsquo; I nodded my assent, and he  moved slowly towards the door. As he did so, his eyes fell upon a roll of bread  lying on a counter. I at once stepped forward and bought it. Vile as he was,  and deadly as was the snare he contemplated drawing about me, I could not see  that wolfish look of hunger, and not offer him something to ease it. He took  the loaf from my hands and bit greedily into it but suddenly paused, and shook  his head with a look like self-reproach, and thrusting the loaf under his arm,  turned towards the door with the quick action of one escaping. Instantly, and  before he was out of sight or hearing, I drew the attention of the proprietor  to him. &lsquo;Do you see that man?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;He has been attempting a system of  blackmail upon me.&rsquo; And satisfied with thus having provided a witness able of  identifying the man, in case of an emergency, I left the building.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  now you know it all,&rdquo; concluded he; and the silence that followed the utterance  of those simple words, was a silence that could be felt.</p>
 <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertram?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man started from his fixed position, and his eyes slowly traversed toward  his uncle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you that slip of paper which the man gave you before departing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said he.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me have it, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man with an agitated look, plunged his hand into his pocket, drew out the  small note and laid it on the table between them. Mr. Sylvester let it lie, and  again there was a silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  this had happened at any other time,&rdquo; Bertram pursued, &ldquo;one could afford to let  the man have his say; but now, just as this other mystery has come up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe in submitting to blackmail,&rdquo; came from his uncle in short, quick  tones.</p>
  <p>Bertram  gave a start. &ldquo;You then advise me to leave him alone?&rdquo; asked he, with  unmistakable emotion.</p>
  <p>His  uncle dropped the hand which till now he had held before his face, and hastily  confronted his nephew. &ldquo;You will have enough to do to attend to the other  matter without bestowing any time or attention upon this. The man that robbed  Mr. Stuyvesant&rsquo;s box, can be found and must. It is the one indispensable  business to which I now delegate you. No amount of money and no amount of  diligence is to be spared. I rely on you to carry the affair to a successful  termination. Will you undertake the task?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you ask?&rdquo; murmured the young man, with a shocked look at his uncle&rsquo;s changed  expression.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  to this other matter, we will let it rest for to-night. To-morrow&rsquo;s revelations  may be more favorable than we expect. At all events let us try and get a little  rest now; I am sure we are both in a condition to need it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bertram  rose. &ldquo;I am at your command,&rdquo; said he, and moved to go. Suddenly he turned, and  the two men stood face to face. &ldquo;I have no wish,&rdquo; pursued he, &ldquo;to be relieved  of my burden at the expense of any one else. If it is to be borne by any one,  let it be carried by him who is young and stalwart enough to sustain it.&rdquo; And  his hand went out involuntarily towards his uncle.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester took that hand and eyed his nephew long and earnestly. Bertram  thought he was going to speak, and nerved himself to meet with fortitude  whatever might be said. But the lips which Mr. Sylvester had opened, closed  firmly, and contenting himself with a mere wring of his nephew&rsquo;s hand, he  allowed him to go. The slip of paper remained upon the table unopened.</p>

  <p>That  night as Paula lay slumbering on her pillow, a sound passed through the house.  It was like a quick irrepressible cry of desolation, and the poor child hearing  it, started, thinking her name had been called. But when she listened, all was  still, and believing she had dreamed, she turned her face upon her pillow, and  softly murmuring the name that was dearest to her in all the world, fell again  into a peaceful sleep.</p>
  <p>But  he whose voice had uttered that cry in the dreary emptiness of the great  parlors below, slept not.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_36"></a>Chapter 36<br>
    Morning</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Two  maidens by one fountain&rsquo;s joyous brink, <br>
  And one was sad and one had cause for  sadness.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Cicely  Stuyvesant waiting for her father at the foot of the stairs, on the morning  after these occurrences, was a pretty and a touching spectacle. She had not  slept very well the night before, and her brow showed signs of trouble and so  did her trembling lips. She held in her hand a letter which she twirled about  with very unsteady fingers. The morning was bright, but she did not seem to  observe it; the air was fresh, but it did not seem to invigorate her. A  rose-leaf of care lay on the tremulous waters of her soul, and her sensitive  nature thrilled under it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  does he not come?&rdquo; she whispered, looking again at the letter&rsquo;s inscription.</p>
  <p>It  was in Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s handwriting, and ought not to have occasioned her any  uneasiness, but her father had intimated a wish the night before, that she  should not come down into the parlor if Bertram called, and&mdash;Her thoughts paused  there, but she was anxious about the letter and wished her father would hasten.</p>
  <p>Let  us look at the little lady. She had been so bright and lovesome yesterday at  this time. Never a maiden in all this great city of ours had shown a sweeter or  more etherial smile. At once radiant and reserved, she flashed on the eye and  trembled from the grasp like some dainty tropical creature as yet unused to our  stranger clime. Her father had surveyed her with satisfaction, and her  lover&mdash;oh, that we were all young again to experience that leap of the heart  with which youth meets and recognizes the sweet perfections of the woman it  adores! But a mist had obscured the radiance of her aspect, and she looks very  sad as she stands in her father&rsquo;s hall this morning, leaning her cheek against  the banister, and thinking of the night when three years ago, she lingered in  that very spot, and watched the form of the young musician go by her and  disappear in the darkness of the night, as she then thought forever. Joy had  come to her by such slow steps and after such long waiting. Hope had burst upon  her so brilliantly, and with such a speedy promise of culmination. She thrilled  as she thought how short a time ago it was, since she leaned upon Bertram&rsquo;s arm  and dropped her eyes before his gaze.</p>
  <p>The  appearance of her father at length aroused her. Flushing slightly, she held the  letter towards him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  letter for you, papa. I thought you might like to read it before you went out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Stuyvesant, who for an hour or more had been frowning over his morning paper  with a steady pertinacity that left more than the usual amount of wrinkles upon  his brow, started at the wistful tone of this announcement from his daughter&rsquo;s  lips, and taking the letter from her hand, stepped into the parlor to peruse  it. It was, as the handwriting declared, from Mr. Sylvester, and ran thus:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  Mr. Stuyvesant:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have heard of your loss and am astounded. Though the Bank is not liable for any  accident to trusts of this nature, both Bertram and myself are determined to  make every effort possible, to detect and punish the man who either through our  negligence, or by means of the opportunities afforded him under our present  system of management, has been able to commit this robbery upon your effects.  We therefore request that you will meet us at the bank this morning at as early  an hour as practicable, there to assist us in making such inquiries and  instituting such measures, as may be considered necessary to the immediate  attainment of the object desired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Respectfully  yours,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Edward  Sylvester.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it anything serious?&rdquo; asked his daughter, coming into the parlor and looking up  into his face with a strange wistfulness he could not fail to remark.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Stuyvesant gave her a quick glance, shook his head with some nervousness and  hastily pocketed the epistle. &ldquo;Business,&rdquo; mumbled he, &ldquo;business.&rdquo; And ignoring  the sigh that escaped her lips, began to make his preparations for going at  once down town.</p>
  <p>He  was always an awkward man at such matters, and it was her habit to afford him  what assistance she could. This she now did, lending her hand to help him on  with his overcoat, rising on tip-toe to tie his muffler, and bending her bright  head to see that his galoshes were properly fastened; her charming face with  its far-away look, shining strangely sweet in the dim hall, in contrast with  his severe and antiquated countenance.</p>
  <p>He  watched her carefully but with seeming indifference till all was done and he  stood ready to depart, then in an awkward enough way&mdash;he was not accustomed to  bestow endearments&mdash;drew her to him and kissed her on the forehead; after which  he turned about and departed without a word to season or explain this unwonted  manifestation of tenderness.</p>
  <p>A kiss  was an unusual occurrence in that confiding but undemonstrative household, and  the little maiden trembled. &ldquo;Something is wrong,&rdquo; she murmured half to herself,  half to the dim vista of the lonely parlor, where but a night or so ago had  stood the beloved form of him, who, bury the thought as she would, had become,  if indeed he had not always been, the beginning and the ending of all her  maidenly dreams: &ldquo;what? what?&rdquo; And her young heart swelled painfully as she  realized like many a woman before her, that whatever might be her doubts,  fears, anguish or suspense, nothing remained for her but silence and a tedious  waiting for others to recognize her misery and speak.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  how was it with her dearest friend and confident, Paula? The morning, as I have  already declared, was bright and exceptionally beautiful. Sunshine filled the  air and freshness invigorated the breeze. Cicely was blind to it all, but as  Paula looked from her window preparatory to going below, a close observer might  have perceived that the serenity of the cloudless sky was reflected in her  beaming eyes, that peace brooded above her soul and ruled her tender spirit.  She had held a long conversation with Miss Belinda, she had prayed, she had  slept and she had risen with a confirmed love in her heart for the man who was  at once the admiration of her eyes and the well-spring of her deepest thoughts  and wildest longings. &ldquo;I will show him so plainly what the angels have told me,&rdquo;  whispered she, &ldquo;that he will have no need to ask.&rdquo; And she wound her long locks  into the coil that she knew he best liked and fixed a rose at her throat, and  so with a smile on her lip went softly down stairs. O the timid eager step of  maidenhood when drawing toward the shrine of all it adores! Could those halls  and lofty corridors have whispered their secret, what a story they would have  told of beating heart and tremulous glance, eager longings, and maidenly  shrinkings, as the lovely form, swaying with a thousand hopes and fears, glided  from landing to landing, carrying with it love and joy and peace. And trust! As  she neared the bronze image that had always awakened such vague feelings of  repugnance on her part, and found its terrors gone and its smile assuring, she  realized that her breast held nothing but faith in him, who may have sinned in  his youth, but who had repented in his manhood, and now stood clear and noble  in her eyes. The assurance was too sweet, the flood of feeling too  overwhelming. With a quick glance around her, she stopped and flung her arms  about the hitherto repellant bronze, pressing her young breast against the cold  metal with a fervor that ought to have hallowed its sensuous mould forever.  Then she hurried down.</p>
  <p>Her  first glance into the dining-room brought her a disappointment. Mr. Sylvester  had already breakfasted and gone; only Aunt Belinda sat at the table. With a  slightly troubled brow, Paula advanced to her own place at the board.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Sylvester has urgent business on hand to-day,&rdquo; quoth her aunt. &ldquo;I met him going  out just as I came down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  look lingered on Paula as she said this, and if it had not been for the  servants, she would doubtless have given utterance to some further expression  on the matter, for she had been greatly struck by Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s appearance  and the sad, firm, almost lofty expression of his eye, as it met hers in their  hurried conversation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is a very busy man,&rdquo; returned Paula simply, and was silent, struck by some  secret dread she could not have explained. Suddenly she rose; she had found an  envelope beneath her plate, addressed to herself. It was bulky and evidently  contained a key. Hastening behind the curtains of the window, she opened it.  The key was to that secret study of his at the top of the house, which no one  but himself had ever been seen to enter, and the words that enwrapped it were  these:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;If  I send you no word to the contrary, and if I do not come back by seven o&rsquo;clock  this evening, go to the room of which this is the key, open my desk, and read  what I have prepared for your eyes.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;E.  S.&rdquo;</p>

    The Opinion Of A Certain Noted Detective</b></h2>

  One hope, like a keen sword on starting threads uphung.&rdquo;&mdash;Revolt  of Islam. </p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Facts  are stubborn things.&rdquo;&mdash;Elliott. </p>
  <p>Meanwhile  Mr. Stuyvesant hasted on his way down town and ere long made his appearance at  the bank. He found Mr. Sylvester and Bertram seated in the directors&rsquo; room,  with a portly smooth-faced man whose appearance was at once strange and vaguely  familiar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  detective, sir,&rdquo; explained Mr. Sylvester rising with forced composure; &ldquo;a man  upon whose judgment I have been told we may rely. Mr. Gryce, Mr. Stuyvesant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  latter gentleman nodded, cast a glance around the room, during which his eye  rested for a moment on Bertram&rsquo;s somewhat pale countenance, and nervously took  a seat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  mysterious piece of business, this,&rdquo; came from the detective&rsquo;s lips in an easy  tone, calculated to relieve the tension of embarrassment into which the  entrance of Mr. Stuyvesant seemed to have thrown all parties. &ldquo;What were the  numbers of the bonds found missing, if you please?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Stuyvesant told him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are positively assured these bonds were all in the box when you last locked it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  was that, sir? On what day and at what hour of the day, if you please?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tuesday,  at about three o&rsquo;clock, I should say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  box was locked by you? There is no doubt about that fact?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None  in the least.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  were you standing at the time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  front of the vault door. I had taken out the box myself as I am in the habit of  doing, and had stepped there to put it back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  any one near you then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  The cashier was at his desk and the teller had occasion to go to the safe while  I stood there. I do not remember seeing any one else in my immediate vicinity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you remember ever going to the vaults and not finding some one near you at the  time or at least in full view of your movements?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have informed Mr. Gryce,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Sylvester, with a ring in his deep  voice that made Mr. Stuyvesant start, &ldquo;that our chief desire at present is to  have his judgment upon the all important question, as to whether this theft was  committed by a stranger, or one in the employ and consequently in the  confidence of the bank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Stuyvesant bowed, every wrinkle in his face manifesting itself with startling  distinctness as he slowly moved his eyes and fixed them on the inscrutable  countenance of the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  agree then with these gentlemen,&rdquo; continued the latter, who had a way of  seeming more interested in everything and everybody present than the person he  was addressing, &ldquo;that it would be difficult if not impossible for any one  unconnected with the bank, to approach the vaults during business hours and  abstract anything from them without detection?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  do these gentleman both assert that?&rdquo; queried Mr. Stuyvesant, with a sharp look  from uncle to nephew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe they do,&rdquo; replied the detective, as both the gentlemen bowed, Bertram  with an uncontrollable quiver of his lip, and Mr. Sylvester with a deepening of  the lines about his mouth, which may or may not have been noticed by this man  who appeared to observe nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should be loth to conclude that the robbery was committed by any one but a  stranger,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Stuyvesant; &ldquo;but if these gentlemen concur in the  statement you have just made, I am bound to acknowledge that I do not myself  see how the theft could have been perpetrated by an outsider. Had the box  itself been missing, it would be different. I remember my old friend Mr. A&mdash;,  the president of the police department, telling me of a case where a box containing  securities to the amount of two hundred thousand dollars, was abstracted in  full daylight from the vaults of one of our largest banks; an act requiring  such daring, the directors for a long time refused to believe it possible,  until a detective one day showed them another box of theirs which he had  succeeded in abstracting in the same way. But the vaults in that instance were in a less conspicuous portion of the bank  than ours, besides to approach an open vault, snatch a box from it and escape,  is a much simpler matter than to remain long enough to open a box and choose  from its contents such papers as appeared most marketable. If a regular thief  could do such a thing, it does not seem probable that he would. Nevertheless  the most acute judgment is often at fault in these matters, and I do not  pretend to have formed an opinion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective who had listened to these words with marked attention, bowed his  concurrence and asked if the bonds mentioned by Mr. Stuyvesant were all that  had been found missing from the bank. If any of the other boxes had been  opened, or if the contents of the safe itself had ever been tampered with.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  contents of the safe are all correct,&rdquo; came in deep tones from Mr. Sylvester. &ldquo;Mr.  Folger, my nephew and myself went through them this morning. As for the boxes I  cannot say, many of them belong to persons travelling; some of them have been  left here by trustees of estates, consequently often lie for weeks in the  vaults untouched. If however any of them have been opened, we ought to be able  to see it. Would you like an examination made of their condition?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective nodded.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester at once turned to Mr. Stuyvesant. &ldquo;May I ask you to mention what  officer of the bank you would like to have go to the vaults?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That  gentleman started, looked uneasily about, but meeting Bertram&rsquo;s eye, nervously  dropped his own and muttered the name of Folger.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester suppressed a sigh, sent for the paying-teller, and informed him of  their wishes. He at once proceeded to the vaults. While he was gone, Mr. Gryce  took the opportunity to make the following remark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;let us understand ourselves. What you want of me, is to tell you whether  this robbery has been committed by a stranger or by some one in your employ.  Now to decide this question it is necessary for me to ask first, whether you  have ever had reason to doubt the honesty of any person connected with the  bank?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  came from Mr. Sylvester with sharp and shrill distinctness. &ldquo;Since I have had  the honor of conducting the affairs of this institution, I have made it my  business to observe and note the bearing and character of each and every man  employed under me, and I believe them all to be honest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  glance of the detective while it did not perceptibly move from the large screen  drawn across the room at the back of Mr. Sylvester, seemed to request the  opinions of the other two gentlemen on this point.</p>
  <p>Bertram  observing it, subdued the rapid beatings of his heart and spoke with like  distinctness. &ldquo;I have been in the bank the same length of time as my uncle,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;and most heartily endorse his good opinion of the various persons in  our employ.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Mr. Stuyvesant?&rdquo; the immovable glance seemed to say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Men  are honest in my opinion till they are proved otherwise,&rdquo; came in short stern  accents from the director&rsquo;s lips.</p>
  <p>The  detective drew back in his chair as if he considered that point decided, and  yet Bertram&rsquo;s eye which had clouded at Mr. Stuyvesant&rsquo;s too abrupt assertion,  did not clear again as might have been expected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is one more question I desire to settle,&rdquo; continued the detective, &ldquo;and that  is, whether this robbery could have been perpetrated after business hours, by  some one in collusion with the person who is here left in charge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;&rdquo;  again came from Mr. Sylvester, with impartial justice. &ldquo;The watchman&mdash;who by the  way has been in the bank for twelve years&mdash;could not help a man to find entrance  to the vaults. His simple duty is to watch over the bank and give alarm in case  of fire or burglary. It would necessitate a knowledge of the combination by  which the vault doors are opened, to do what you suggest, and that is possessed  by but three persons in the bank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  those are?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  cashier, the janitor, and myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  endeavored to speak calmly and without any betrayal of the effort it caused him  to utter those simple words, but a detective&rsquo;s ear is nice and it is doubtful  if he perfectly succeeded.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce however limited himself to a muttered, humph! and a long and thoughtful  look at a spot on the green baize of the table before which he sat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  janitor lives in the building, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and is, as I am sure Mr. Stuyvesant will second me in asserting, honesty to the  back-bone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Janitors  always are,&rdquo; observed the detective; then shortly, &ldquo;How long has <i>he</i> been  with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Three  years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Another  &ldquo;humph!&rdquo; and an increased interest in the ink spot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is not long, considering the responsibility of his position.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was on the police force before he came to us,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Sylvester.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce looked as if that was not much of a recommendation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  for the short time he has been with us,&rdquo; resumed the other, &ldquo;he came into the  bank the same winter as my nephew and myself, and has found the time sufficient  to earn the respect of all who know him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective bowed, seemingly awed by the dignity with which the last statement  had been uttered; but any one who knew him well, would have perceived that the  film of uncertainty which had hitherto dimmed the brightness of his regard was  gone, as if in the other&rsquo;s impressive manner, if not in the suggestion his  words had unconsciously offered, the detective had received an answer to some  question which had been puzzling him, or laid his hand upon some clue which had  till now eluded his grasp. The inquiries which he made haste to pursue,  betrayed, however, but little of the tendency of his thoughts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  janitor, you say, knows the combination by which the vault doors are opened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The <i>vault doors</i>,&rdquo; emphasized Mr. Sylvester. &ldquo;The safe is another matter;  that stands inside the vault and is locked by a triple combination which as a  whole is not known to any one man in this building, not even to myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the boxes are not kept in the safe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  they are piled up with the books in the vaults at the side of the safe, as you  can see for yourself, if you choose to join Mr. Folger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  necessary. The janitor, then, is the only man besides yourselves, who under any  circumstances or for any reason, could get at those boxes after business hours?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  question more. Who is the man to attend to those boxes? I mean to ask, which of  the men in your employ is expected to procure a box out of the vaults when it  is called for, and put it back in its place when its owner is through with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hopgood  usually does that business, the janitor of whom we have just been speaking.  When he is upstairs or out of the way, any one else whom it may be convenient  to call.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  janitor, then, has free access to the boxes at all times, night and day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  one sense, yes, in another, no. Should he unlock the vaults at night, the  watchman would report upon his proceedings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  there must be time between the closing and opening of the bank, when the  janitor is alone with the vaults?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is a space of two hours after seven in the morning, when he is likely to be the  sole one in charge. The watchman goes home, and Hopgood employs himself in  sweeping out the bank and preparing it for the business of the day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  the watchman and the janitor on good terms with one another?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very,  I believe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective looked thoughtful. &ldquo;I should like to see this Hopgood,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>But  just then the door opened and Mr. Folger came in, looking somewhat pale and  disturbed. &ldquo;We are in a difficulty,&rdquo; cried he, stepping up to the table where  they sat. &ldquo;I have found two of the boxes unlocked; that belonging to Hicks,  Saltzer and Co., and another with the name of Harrington upon it. The former  has been wrenched apart, the latter opened with some sort of instrument. Would  you like to see them, sir?&rdquo; This to Mr. Sylvester.</p>
  <p>With  a start that gentleman rose, and as suddenly reseated himself. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned  he, carefully avoiding his nephew&rsquo;s eye; &ldquo;bring them in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hicks,  Saltzer and Co., is a foreign house,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Stuyvesant to the detective,  &ldquo;and do not send for their box once a fortnight, as I have heard Mr. Sylvester  declare. Mr. Harrington is on an exploring expedition and is at present in  South America.&rdquo; Then in lower tones, whose sternness was not unmixed with  gloom, &ldquo;The thief seems to have known what boxes to go to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bertram  flushed and made some passing rejoinder; Mr. Sylvester and the detective alone  remained silent.</p>
  <p>The  boxes being brought in, Mr. Gryce opened them without ceremony. Several papers  met his eye in both, but as no one but the owners could know their rightful  contents, it was of course impossible for him to determine whether anything had  been stolen from them or not.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Send  for the New York agent of Hicks, Saltzer and Co.,&rdquo; came from Mr. Sylvester, in  short, business-like command.</p>
  <p>Bertram  at once rose. &ldquo;I will see to it,&rdquo; said he. His agitation was too great for  suppression, the expression of Mr. Stuyvesant&rsquo;s eye, that in its restlessness  wandered in every direction but his own, troubled him beyond endurance. With a  hasty move he left the room. The cold eye of the detective followed him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Looks  bad,&rdquo; came in laconic tones from the paying teller.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had hoped the affair begun and ended with my individual loss,&rdquo; muttered Mr.  Stuyvesant under his breath.</p>
  <p>The  stately president and the inscrutable detective still maintained their silence.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  the latter moved. Turning towards Mr. Sylvester, he requested him to step with  him to the window. &ldquo;I want to have a look at your several employees,&rdquo; whispered  he, as they thus withdrew. &ldquo;I want to see them without being seen by them. If  you can manage to have them come in here one by one upon some pretext or other,  I can so arrange that screen under the mantel-piece, that it shall not only  hide me, but give me a very good view of their faces in the mirror overhead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  will be no difficulty about summoning the men,&rdquo; said Mr. Sylvester.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you consent to the scheme?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  if you think anything is to be gained by it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure that nothing will be lost. And sir, let the cashier be present if you  please; and sir,&rdquo; squeezing his watch chain with a complacent air, as the other  dropped his eyes, &ldquo;talk to them about anything that you please, only let it be  of a nature that will necessitate a sentence or more in reply. I judge a man as  much by his voice as his expression.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester bowed, and without losing his self-command, though the short allusion  to Bertram had greatly startled him, turned back to the table where Mr. Folger  was still standing in conversation with the director.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will not detain you longer,&rdquo; said he to the paying teller. &ldquo;Your discretion  will prevent you from speaking of this matter, I trust.&rdquo; Then as the other  bowed, added carelessly, &ldquo;I have something to say to Jessup; will you see that  he steps here for a moment?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Folger again nodded and left the room. Instantly Mr. Gryce bustled forward, and  pulling the screen into the position he thought best calculated to answer his  requirements, slid rapidly behind it. Mr. Stuyvesant looked up in surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am going to interview the clerks for Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s benefit,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr.  Sylvester. &ldquo;Will you in the meantime look over the morning paper?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; returned the other, edging nervously to one side, &ldquo;my note-book will do  just as well,&rdquo; and sitting down at the remote end of the table, he took out a  book from his pocket, above which he bent with very well simulated  preoccupation. Mr. Sylvester called in Bertram and then seated himself with a  hopeless and unexpectant look, which he for the moment forgot would be  reflected in the mirror before him, and so carried to the eye of the watchful  detective. In another instant Jessup entered.</p>
  <p>What  was said in the short interview that followed, is unimportant. Mr. Jessup, the  third teller, was one of those clear eyed, straightforward appearing men whose  countenance is its own guarantee. It was not necessary to detain him or make  him speak. The next man to come in was Watson, and after he had gone, two or  three of the clerks, and later the receiving teller and one of the runners. All  stopped long enough to insure Mr. Gryce a good view of their faces, and from  each and all did Mr. Sylvester succeed in eliciting more or less conversation in  response to the questions he chose to put.</p>
  <p>With  the disappearance of the last mentioned individual, Mr. Gryce peeped from  behind the screen. &ldquo;A set of as honest-looking men as I wish to see!&rdquo; uttered  he with a frank cordiality that was scarcely reflected in the anxious  countenances about him. &ldquo;No sly-boots among them; how about the janitor,  Hopgood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  shall be summoned at once, if you desire it,&rdquo; said Mr. Sylvester, &ldquo;I have only  delayed calling him that I might have leisure to interrogate him with reference  to his duties, and this very theft. That is if you judge it advisable in me to  tamper with the subject unassisted?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  nephew can help you if necessary,&rdquo; replied the imperturbable detective. &ldquo;I  should like to hear what the man, Hopgood, has to say for himself,&rdquo; and he  glided back into his old position.</p>
  <p>But  Mr. Sylvester had scarcely reached out his hand to ring the bell by which he  usually summoned the janitor, when the agent of Hicks, Saltzer &amp; Co. came  in. It was an interruption that demanded instant attention. Saluting the  gentleman with his usual proud reserve, he drew his attention to the box lying  upon the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is yours, I believe, sir,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It was found in our vaults this morning in  the condition in which you now behold it, and we are anxious to know if its  contents are all correct.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  have been handled,&rdquo; returned the agent, after a careful survey of the various  papers that filled the box, &ldquo;but nothing appears to be missing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Three  persons at least in that room breathed more easily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the truth is,&rdquo; the gentleman continued, with a half smile towards the silent  President of the bank, &ldquo;there was nothing in this box that would have been of  much use to any other parties than ourselves. If there had been a bond or so  here, I doubt if we should have come off so fortunately, eh? The lock has  evidently been wrenched open, and that is certainly a pretty sure sign that  something is not right hereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something  is decidedly wrong,&rdquo; came from Mr. Sylvester sternly; &ldquo;but through whose fault  we do not as yet know.&rdquo; And with a few words expressive of his relief at  finding the other had sustained no material loss, he allowed the agent to  depart.</p>
  <p>He  had no sooner left the room than Mr. Stuyvesant rose. &ldquo;Are you going to  question Hopgood now?&rdquo; queried he, nervously pocketing his note-book.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  sir, if you have no objections.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  director fidgeted with his chair and finally moved towards the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you will get along better with him alone,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;He is a man who very  easily gets embarrassed, and has a way of acting as if he were afraid of me. I  will just step outside while you talk to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Mr. Sylvester with a sudden dark flush on his brow, hastily stopped him. &ldquo;I beg  you will not,&rdquo; said he, with a quick realization of what Hopgood might be led  to say in the forthcoming interview, if he were not restrained by the presence  of the director. &ldquo;Hopgood is not so afraid of you that he will not answer every  question that is put to him with straightforward frankness.&rdquo; And he pushed up a  chair, with a smile that Mr. Stuyvesant evidently found himself unable to  resist. The screen trembled slightly, but none of them noticed it; Mr.  Sylvester at once rang for Hopgood.</p>
  <p>He  came in panting with his hurried descent from the fifth story, his face flushed  and his eyes rolling, but without any of the secret perturbation Bertram had  observed in them on a former occasion. &ldquo;He cannot help us,&rdquo; was the thought  that darkened the young man&rsquo;s brow as his eyes left the janitor, and faltering  towards his uncle, fell upon the table before him.</p>
  <p>Everything  was reflected in the mirror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Hopgood, I have a few questions to put to you this morning,&rdquo; said Mr. Sylvester  in a restrained, but not unkindly tone.</p>
  <p>The  worthy man bowed, bestowed a salutatory roll of his eyes on Mr. Stuyvesant, and  stood deferentially waiting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  he cannot help us,&rdquo; was again Bertram&rsquo;s thought, and again his eyes faltered to  his uncle&rsquo;s face, and again fell anxiously before him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  has not been my habit to trouble you with inquiries about your management of  matters under your charge,&rdquo; continued Mr. Sylvester, stopping till the janitor&rsquo;s  wandering eyes settled upon his own. &ldquo;Your conduct has always been exemplary,  and your attention to duty satisfactory; but I would like to ask you to-day if  you have observed anything amiss with the vaults of late? anything wrong about  the boxes kept there? anything in short, that excited your suspicion or caused  you to ask yourself if everything was as it should be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  janitor&rsquo;s ruddy face grew pale, and his eye fell with startled inquiry on Mr.  Harrington&rsquo;s box that still occupied the centre of the table. &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he  emphatically replied, &ldquo;has anything&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Mr. Sylvester did not wait to be questioned. &ldquo;You have attended to your duties  as promptly and conscientiously as usual; you have allowed no one to go to the  vaults day or night, who had no business there? You have not relaxed your  accustomed vigilance, or left the bank alone at any time during the hours it is  under your charge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  sir, not for a minute, sir; that is&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped and his eye wandered towards  Mr. Stuyvesant. &ldquo;Never for a minute, sir,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;without I knew some one  was in the bank, who was capable of looking after it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  watchman has been at his post every night up to the usual hour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  has been no carelessness in closing the vault doors after the departure of the  clerks?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  no trouble,&rdquo; he continued, with a shade more of dignity, possibly because  Hopgood&rsquo;s tell-tale face was beginning to show signs of anxious confusion, &ldquo;and  no trouble in opening them at the proper time each morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  question more&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  here Bertram was called out, and in the momentary stir occasioned by his  departure, Hopgood allowed himself to glance at the box before him more  intently than he had hitherto presumed to do. He saw it was unlocked, and his  hands began to tremble. Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s voice recalled him to himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a faithful man,&rdquo; said that gentleman, continuing his speech of a minute before,  &ldquo;and as such we are ready to acknowledge you; but the most conscientious  amongst us are sometimes led into indiscretions. Now have you ever through  carelessness or by means of any inadvertence, revealed to any one in or out of  the bank, the particular combination by which the lock of the vault-door is at  present opened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  sir, indeed no; I am much too anxious, and feel my own responsibility entirely  too much, not to preserve so important a secret with the utmost care and  jealousy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester&rsquo;s voice, careful as he was to modulate it, showed a secret  discouragement. &ldquo;The vaults then as far as you know, are safe when once they  are closed for the night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  sir.&rdquo; The janitor&rsquo;s face expressed a slight degree of wonder, but his voice was  emphatic.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester&rsquo;s eye travelled in the direction of the screen. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said he;  and paused to reflect.</p>
  <p>In  the interim the door opened for a second time. &ldquo;A gentleman to see Mr.  Stuyvesant,&rdquo; said a voice.</p>
  <p>With  an air of relief the director hastily rose, and before Mr. Sylvester had  realized his position, left the room and closed the door behind him. A knell  seemed to ring its note in Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s breast. The janitor, released as he  supposed from all constraint, stepped hastily forward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  box has been found unlocked,&rdquo; he cried with a wave of his hand towards the  table; &ldquo;some one has been to the vaults, and I&mdash;Oh, sir,&rdquo; he hurriedly  exclaimed, disregarding in his agitation the stern and forbidding look which  Mr. Sylvester in his secret despair had made haste to assume, &ldquo;you did not want  me to say anything about the time you came down so early in the morning, and I  went out and left you alone in the bank, and you went to the vaults and opened  Mr. Stuyvesant&rsquo;s box by mistake, with a tooth-pick as you remember?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  mirror that looked down upon that pair, showed one very white face at that  moment, but the screen that had trembled a moment before, stood strangely still  in the silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  came at length from Mr. Sylvester, with a composure that astonished himself. &ldquo;I  was not questioning you about matters of a year agone. But you might have told  that incident if you pleased; it was very easily explainable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  sir, I know, and I beg pardon for alluding to it, but I was so taken aback,  sir, by your questions; I wanted to tell the exact truth, and I did not want to  say anything that would hurt you with Mr. Stuyvesant; that is if I could help  it. I hope I did right, sir,&rdquo; he blundered on, conscious he was uttering words  he might better have kept to himself, but too embarrassed to know how to emerge  from the difficulty into which his mingled zeal and anxiety had betrayed him. &ldquo;I  was never a good hand at answering questions, and if any thing really serious  has happened, I shall wish you had taken me at my word and dismissed me  immediately after that affair. Constantia Maria would have been a little worse  off perhaps, but I should not be on hand to answer questions, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hopgood!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man started, eyed Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s white but powerfully controlled countenance,  seemed struck with something he saw there, and was silent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  make too much now, as you made too much then of a matter that having its sole  ground in a mistake, is, as I say, easily explainable. This affair which has  come up now, is not so clear. Three of the boxes have been opened, and from one  certain valuables have been taken. Can you give me any information that will  assist us in our search after the culprit?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  sir.&rdquo; The tone was quite humble, Hopgood drew back unconsciously towards the  door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  for the mistake of a year ago to which you have seen proper to allude, I shall  myself take pains to inform Mr. Stuyvesant of it, since it has made such an  impression upon you that it trammels your honesty and makes you consider it at  all necessary to be anxious about it at this time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  Hopgood unused to sarcasm from those lips, drew himself together, and with one  more agitated look at the box on the table, sidled awkwardly from the room. Mr.  Sylvester at once advanced to the screen which he hastily pushed aside. &ldquo;Well,  sir,&rdquo; said he, meeting the detective&rsquo;s wavering eye and forcing him to return  his look, &ldquo;you have now seen the various employees of the bank and heard most  of them converse. Is there anything more you would like to inquire into before  giving us the opinion I requested?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  sir,&rdquo; said the detective, coming forward, but very slowly and somewhat  hesitatingly for him. &ldquo;I think I am ready to say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  the door opened, and Mr. Stuyvesant returned. The detective drew a breath of  relief and repeated his words with a business-like assurance. &ldquo;I think I am  ready to say, that from the nature of the theft and the mysterious manner in  which it has been perpetrated, suspicion undoubtedly points to some one  connected with the bank. That is all that you require of me to-day?&rdquo; he added,  with a bow of some formality in the direction of Mr. Sylvester.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  was the short reply. But in an instant a change passed over the stately form of  the speaker. Advancing to Mr. Gryce, he confronted him with a countenance  almost majestic in its severity, and somewhat severely remarked, &ldquo;This is a  serious charge to bring against men whose countenances you yourself have  denominated as honest. Are we to believe you have fully considered the  question, and realize the importance of what you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Sylvester,&rdquo; replied the detective, with great self-possession and some dignity,  &ldquo;a man who is brought every day of his life into positions where the least  turning of a hair will sink a man or save him, learns to weigh his words, before  he speaks even in such informal inquiries as these.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester bowed and turned towards Mr. Stuyvesant. &ldquo;Is there any further action  you would like to have taken in regard to this matter to-day?&rdquo; he asked,  without a tremble in his voice.</p>
  <p>With  a glance at the half open box of the absent Mr. Harrington, the agitated  director slowly shook his head. &ldquo;We must have time to think,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce at once took up his hat. &ldquo;If the charge implied in my opinion strikes  you, gentlemen, as serious, you must at least acknowledge that your own  judgment does not greatly differ from mine, or why such unnecessary agitation  in regard to a loss so petty, by a gentleman worth as we are told his millions.&rdquo;  And with this passing shot, to which neither of his auditors responded, he made  his final obeisance and calmly left the room.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester and Mr. Stuyvesant slowly confronted one another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  man speaks the truth,&rdquo; said the former. &ldquo;You at least suspect some one in the  bank, Mr. Stuyvesant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no wish to,&rdquo; hastily returned the other, &ldquo;but facts&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  facts of this nature have any weight with you against the unspotted character  of a man never known by you to meditate, much less commit a dishonest action?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  yet facts are facts, and if it is proved that some one in our employ has  perpetrated a theft, the mind will unconsciously ask who, and remain uneasy  till it is satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  if it never is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will always ask who, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester drew back. &ldquo;The matter shall be pushed,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you shall be  satisfied. Surveillance over each man employed in this institution ought sooner  or later to elicit the truth. The police shall take it in charge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Stuyvesant looked uneasy. &ldquo;I suppose it is only justice,&rdquo; murmured he, &ldquo;but it  is a scandal I would have been glad to avoid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I, but circumstances admit of no other course. The innocent must not suffer for  the guilty, even so far as an unfounded suspicion would lead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no, of course not.&rdquo; And the director bustled about after his overcoat and hat.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester watched him with growing sadness. &ldquo;Mr. Stuyvesant,&rdquo; said he, as the  latter stood before him ready for the street, &ldquo;we have always been on terms of  friendship, and nothing but the most pleasant relations have ever existed  between us. Will you pardon me if I ask you to give me your hand in good-day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  director paused, looked a trifle astonished, but held out his hand not only  with cordiality but very evident affection.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  day,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;good-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester pressed that hand, and then with a dignified bow, allowed the  director to depart. It was his last effort at composure. When the door closed,  his head sank on his hands, and life with all its hopes and honors, love and  happiness, seemed to die within him.</p>
  <p>He  was interrupted at length by Bertram. &ldquo;Well, uncle?&rdquo; asked the young man with  unrestrained emotion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  theft has been committed by some one in this bank; so the detective gives out,  and so we are called upon to believe. <i>Who</i> the man is who has caused us  all this misery, neither he, nor you, nor I, nor any one, is likely to very  soon determine. Meantime&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  cried Bertram anxiously, after a moment of suspense.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meantime,  courage!&rdquo; his uncle resumed with forced cheerfulness.</p>
  <p>But  as he was leaving the bank he came up to Bertram, and laying his hand on his  shoulder, quietly said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want you to go immediately to my house upon leaving here. I may not be back  till midnight, and Miss Fairchild may need the comfort of your presence. Will  you do it, Bertram?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle!  I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!  you will comfort me best by doing what I ask. May I rely upon you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Always.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  with just a final look, the two gentlemen parted, and the shadow which had  rested all day upon the bank, deepened over Bertram&rsquo;s head like a pall.</p>
  <p>It  was not lifted by the sight of Hopgood stealing a few minutes later towards the  door by which his uncle had departed, his face pale, and his eyes fixed in a  stare, that bespoke some deep and moving determination.</p>

    Blue-Beard&rsquo;s Chamber</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Present  fears <br>
  Are less than horrible imaginings.&rdquo;&mdash;Macbeth. </p>
  <p>Clarence  Ensign was not surprised at the refusal he received from Paula. He had realized  from the first that the love of this beautiful woman would be difficult to  obtain, even if no rival with more powerful inducements than his own, should  chance to cross his path. She was one who could be won to give friendship,  consideration, and sympathy without stint; but from the very fact that she  could so easily be induced to grant these, he foresaw the improbability, or at least  the difficulty of enticing her to yield more. A woman whose hand warms towards  the other sex in ready friendship, is the last to succumb to the entreaties of  love. The circle of her sympathies is so large, the man must do well, who of  all his sex, pierces to the sacred centre. The appearance of Mr. Sylvester on  the scene, settled his fate, or so he believed; but he was too much in earnest  to yield his hopes without another effort; so upon the afternoon of this  eventful day, he called upon Paula.</p>
  <p>The  first glimpse he obtained of her countenance, convinced him that he was indeed  too late. Not for him that anxious pallor, giving way to a rosy tinge at the  least sound in the streets without. Not for him that wandering glance, burning  with questions to which nothing seemed able to grant reply. The very smile with  which she greeted him, was a blow; it was so forgetful of the motive that had  brought him there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Fairchild,&rdquo; he stammered, with a generous impulse to save her unnecessary pain,  &ldquo;you have rejected my offer and settled my doom; but let me believe that I have  not lost your regard, or that hold upon your friendship which it has hitherto  been my pleasure to enjoy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  woke at once to a realization of his position. &ldquo;Oh Mr. Ensign,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;can  you doubt my regard or the truth of my friendship? It is for me to doubt; I  have caused you such pain, and as you may think, so ruthlessly and with such  lack of consideration. I have been peculiarly placed,&rdquo; she blushingly  proceeded. &ldquo;A woman does not always know her own heart, or if she does,  sometimes hesitates to yield to its secret impulses. I have led you astray  these last few weeks, but I first went astray myself. The real path in which I  ought to tread, was only last night revealed to me. I can say no more, Mr.  Ensign.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  is it necessary,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;You have chosen the better path, and the better  man. May life abound in joys for you, Miss Fairchild.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  drew herself up and her hand went involuntarily to her heart. &ldquo;It is not joy I  seek,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;  He looked at her face lit with that heavenly gleam that visited it in rare  moments of deepest emotion, and wondered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joy  is in seeing the one you love happy,&rdquo; cried she; &ldquo;earth holds none that is  sweeter or higher.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  may that be yours,&rdquo; he murmured, manfully subduing the jealous pang natural  under the circumstances. And taking the hand she held out to him, he kissed it  with greater reverence and truer affection than when, in the first joyous hours  of their intercourse, he carried it so gallantly to his lips.</p>
  <p>And  she&mdash;oh, difference of time and feeling&mdash;did not remember as of yore, the noble  days of chivalry, though he was in this moment, so much more than ever the true  knight and the reproachless cavalier.</p>
  <p>For  Paula&rsquo;s heart was heavy. Fears too unsubstantial to be met and vanquished, had  haunted her steps all day. The short note which Mr. Sylvester had written her,  lay like lead upon her bosom. She longed for the hours to fly, yet dreaded to  hear the clock tick out the moments that possibly were destined to bring her  untold suffering and disappointment. A revelation awaiting her in Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s  desk up stairs? That meant separation and farewell; for words of promise and  devotion can be spoken, and the heart that hopes, does not limit time to hours.</p>
  <p>With  Bertram&rsquo;s entrance, her fears took absolute shape. Mr. Sylvester was not coming  home to dinner. Thenceforward till seven o&rsquo;clock, she sat with her hand on her  heart, waiting. At the stroke of the clock, she rose, and procuring a candle  from her room, went slowly up stairs. &ldquo;Watch for me,&rdquo; she had said to Aunt  Belinda, &ldquo;for I fear I shall need your care when I come down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What  is there about a mystery however trivial, that thrills the heart with vague  expectancy at the least lift of the concealing curtain! As Paula paused before  the door, which never to her knowledge had opened to the passage of any other  form than that of Mr. Sylvester, she was conscious of an agitation wholly  distinct from that which had hitherto afflicted her. All the past curiosity of  Ona concerning this room, together with her devices for satisfying that  curiosity, recurred to Paula with startling distinctness. It was as if the  white hand of that dead wife had thrust itself forth from the shadows to pull  her back. The candle trembled in her grasp, and she unconsciously recoiled. But  the next moment the thought of Mr. Sylvester struck warmth and determination  through her being, and hastily thrusting the key into the lock, she pushed open  the door and stepped across the threshold.</p>
  <p>Her  first movement was that of surprise. In all her dreams of the possible  appearance of this room, she had never imagined it to be like this. Plain, rude  and homely, its high walls unornamented, its floor uncovered, its furniture  limited to a plain desk and two or three rather uncomfortable-looking chairs,  it struck upon her fancy with the same sense of incongruity, as might the sight  of a low-eaved cottage in the midst of stately palaces and lordly  pleasure-grounds. Setting down her candle, she folded her hands to still their  tremblings, and slowly looked around her. This was the spot, then, to which he  was accustomed to flee when oppressed by any care or harassed by any  difficulty; this cold, bare, uninviting apartment with its forbidding aspect  unsoftened by the tokens of a woman&rsquo;s care or presence! To this room, humbler  than any in her aunt&rsquo;s home in Grotewell, he had brought all his griefs, from  the day his baby lay dead in the rooms below, to that awful hour which saw the  wife and mother brought into his doors and laid a cold and pulseless form in  the midst of his gorgeous parlors! Here he had met his own higher impulses face  to face, and wrestled with them through the watches of the night! In this  wilderness of seeming poverty, he had dreamed, perhaps, his first fond dream of  her as a woman, and signed perhaps his final renunciation of her as the future  companion of his life! What did it mean? Why a spot of so much desolation in  the midst of so much that was lordly and luxurious? Her fears might give her a  possible interpretation, but she would not listen to fears. Only his words  should instruct her. Going to the desk, she opened it. A sealed envelope  addressed to herself, immediately met her eyes. Taking it out with a slow and  reverent touch, she began to read the long and closely written letter which it  contained.</p>
  <p>And  the little candle burned on, shedding its rays over her bended head and upon  the dismal walls about her, with a persistency that seemed to bring out, as in  letters of fire, the hidden history of long ago, with its vanished days and its  forgotten midnights.</p>

    From A. To Z.</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;A  naked human heart.&rdquo;&mdash;Young.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  Beloved Child:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  may I call you in this the final hour of our separation, but never again, dear  one, never again. When I said to you, just twenty-four hours ago, that my sin  was buried and my future was clear, I spake as men speak who forget the justice  of God and dream only of his mercy. An hour&rsquo;s time convinced me that an evil  deed once perpetrated by a man, is never buried so that its ghost will not  rise. Do as we will, repent as we may, the shadowy phantom of a stained and  unrighteous youth is never laid; nor is a man justified in believing it so,  till death has closed his eyes, and fame written its epitaph upon his tomb.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula,  I am at this hour wandering in search of the being who holds the secret of my  life and who will to-morrow blazon it before all the world. It is with no hope  I seek him. God has not brought me to this pass, to release me at last, from  shame and disgrace. Suffering and the loss of all my sad heart cherished, wait  at my gates. Only one boon remains, and that is, your sympathy and the  consolation of your regard. These, though bestowed as friends bestow them, are  very precious to me; I cannot see them go, and that they may not, I tell you  the full story of my life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  youth was happy&mdash;my early youth, I mean. Bertram&rsquo;s father was a dear brother to  me, and my mother a watchful guardian and a tender friend. At fifteen, I  entered a bank, the small bank in Grotewell, which you ought to remember. From  the lowest position in it, I gradually worked my way up till I occupied the  cashier&rsquo;s place; and was just congratulating myself upon my prospects, when Ona  Delafield returned from boarding-school, a young lady.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula,  there is a fascination, which some men who have known nothing deeper and  higher, call love. I, who in those days had cherished but few thoughts beyond  the ordinary reach of a narrow and somewhat selfish business mind, imagined  that the well-spring of all romance had bubbled up within me, when my eyes  first fell upon this regal blonde, with her sleepy, inscrutable eyes and  bewildering smile. Ulysses within sound of the siren&rsquo;s voice, was nothing to  it. He had been warned of his danger and had only his own curiosity to combat,  while I was not even aware of my peril, and floated within reach of this woman&rsquo;s  power, without making an effort to escape. She was so subtle in her influence,  Paula; so careless in the very exercise of her sovereignty. She never seemed to  command; yet men and women obeyed her. Peculiarities which mar the matron, are  often graces in a young, unmarried girl, whose thoughts are a mystery, and  whose emotions an untried field. I believed I had found the queen of all beauty  and when in an unguarded hour she betrayed her first appreciation of my  devotion, I seemed to burst into a Paradise of delights, where every step I  took, only the more intoxicated and bewildered me. My first realization of the  sensuous and earthly character of my happiness came with the glimpse of your  child-face on that never-to-be-forgotten day when we met beside the river. Like  a star seen above the glare of a conflagration, the pure spirit that informed  your glance, flashed on my burning soul, and for a moment I knew that in you  budded the kind of woman-nature which it befitted a man to seek; that in the  hands of such a one as you would make, should he trust his honor and bequeath  his happiness. But when did a lover ever break the bonds that imprisoned his fancy,  at the inspiration of a passing voice. I went back to Ona and forgot the child  by the river.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula,  I have no time to utter regrets. This is a hard plain tale which I have to  relate; but if you love me still&mdash;if, as I have sometimes imagined, you have always  loved me&mdash;think what my life had been if I had heeded the warning which God  vouchsafed me on that day, and contrast it with what it is, and what it must  be.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  went back to Ona, then, and the hold which she had upon me from the first, took  form and shape. As well as she could love any one, she loved me, and though she  had offers from one or two more advantageous sources, she finally decided that  she would risk the future and accept me, if her father consented to the  alliance. You who are the niece of the man of whom I must now speak, may or may  not know what that meant. I doubt if you do; he left Grotewell while you were a  child, and any gossip concerning him must ever fall short of the real truth.  Enough, then, that it meant, if Jacob Delafield could see in my future any  promises of success sufficient to warrant him in accepting me as his  son-in-law, no woman living ought to hesitate to trust me with her hand. He was  the Squire of the town, and as such entitled to respect, but he was also  something more, as you will presently discover. His answer to my plea was:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,  how much money have you to show?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  I had none. My salary as cashier of a small country bank was not large, and my  brother&rsquo;s prolonged sickness and subsequent death, together with my own  somewhat luxurious habits, had utterly exhausted it. I told him so, but added  that I had, somewhere up among the hills, an old maiden aunt who had promised  me five thousand dollars at her death; and that as she was very ill at that  time&mdash;hopelessly so, her neighbors thought&mdash;in a few weeks I should doubtless be  able to satisfy him with the sight of a sum sufficient to start us in  housekeeping, if no more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  nodded at this, but gave me no distinct reply. &lsquo;Let us wait,&rsquo; said he.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  youth is not inclined to wait. I considered my cause as good as won, and began  to make all my preparations accordingly. With a feverish impatience which is no  sign of true love, I watched the days go by, and waited for, if I did not  anticipate, the death which I fondly imagined would make all clear. At last it  came, and I went again into Mr. Delafield&rsquo;s presence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My  aunt has just died,&rsquo; I announced, and stood waiting for the short, concise,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go  ahead, then, my boy!&rsquo; which I certainly expected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Instead  of that, he gave me a queer inexplicable smile, and merely said, &lsquo;I want to see  the greenbacks, my lad. No color so good as green, not even the black upon  white of &lsquo;I promise to pay.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  went back to my desk in the bank, chagrined. Ona had told me a few days before  that she was tired of waiting, that the young doctor from the next town was  very assiduous in his attentions, and as there was no question as to his  ability to support a wife, why&mdash;she did not finish her sentence, but the toss of  her head and her careless tone at parting, were enough to inflame the jealousy  of a less easily aroused nature than mine. I felt that I was in hourly danger  of losing her, and all because I could not satisfy her father with a sight of  the few thousands which were so soon to be mine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  reading of my aunt&rsquo;s will, which confirmed my hopes, did not greatly improve  matters. &lsquo;I want to see the money,&rsquo; the old gentleman repeated; and I was  forced to wait the action of the law and the settlement of the estate. It took  longer than even he foresaw. Weeks went by and my poor little five thousand  seemed as far from my control as on the day the will was read. There was some  trouble, I was not told what, that made it seem improbable that I should reap  the benefit of my legacy for some time. Meanwhile Ona accepted the attentions  of the young doctor, and my chances of winning her, dwindled rapidly day by  day. I became morbidly eager and insanely jealous. Instead of pursuing my  advantage&mdash;for I undoubtedly possessed one in her own secret inclination towards  me&mdash;I stood off, and let my rival work his way into her affections unhindered. I  was too sore to interrupt his play, as I called it, and too afraid of myself to  actually confront him in her presence. But the sight of them riding together  one day, was more than I could endure even in my spirit of unresistance. &lsquo;He  shall not have her,&rsquo; I cried, and cast about in my mind how to bring my own  matters into such shape as to satisfy her father and so win her own consent to  my suit. My first thought was to borrow the money, but that was impracticable  in a town where each man&rsquo;s affairs are known to his neighbor. My next was to  hurry up the settlement of the estate by appeal to my lawyer. The result of the  latter course was a letter of many promises, in the midst of which a great  temptation assailed me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Colonel  Japha, of whose history you have heard more or less true accounts, was at that  time living in the old mansion you took such pains to point out to me in that  walk we took together in Grotewell. He had suffered a great anguish in the  flight and degradation of his only daughter, and though the real facts  connected with her departure were not known in the village, he was so overcome  with shame, and so shattered in health, he lived in the utmost seclusion,  opening his doors to but few visitors, among whom I, for some unexplained  reason, was one. He used to say he liked me and saw in me the makings of a  considerable man; and I, because he was Colonel Japha and a strong spirit,  returned his appreciation, and spent many of my bitter and unhappy hours in his  presence. It was upon one of these occasions the temptation came to which I  have just alluded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had been talking about his health and the advisability of his taking a journey,  when he suddenly rose and said, &lsquo;Come with me to my study.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  of course went. The first thing I saw upon entering was a trunk locked and  strapped. &lsquo;I am going to Europe to-morrow,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;to be gone six months.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was astonished, for in that town no one presumed to do anything of importance  without consulting his neighbors; but I merely bowed my congratulations, and  waited for him to speak, for I saw he had something on his mind that he wished  to say. At last it came out. He had a daughter, he said, a daughter who had  disgraced him and whom he had forbidden his house. She was not worthy of his  consideration, yet he could not help but remember her, and while he never  desired to see her enter his doors, it was not his wish that she should suffer  want. He had a little money which he had laid by and which he wished to put  into my hands for her use, provided anything should happen to him during his  absence. &lsquo;She is a wanderer now,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;but she may one day come back, and  then if I am dead and gone, you may give it to her.&rsquo; I was not to enter it in the  bank under his name, but regard it as a personal trust to be used only under  such circumstances as he mentioned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  joy with which I listened to this proposal amounted almost to ecstacy when he  went to his desk and brought out five one thousand dollar bills and laid them  in my hand. &lsquo;It is not much,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but it will save her from worse  degradation if she chooses to avail herself of it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  much; oh no, not much, but just the sum that would raise me out of the pit of  despondency into which I had fallen, and give me my bride, a chance in the  world, and last, but not least, revenge on the rival I had now learned to hate.  I was obliged to give the colonel a paper acknowledging the trust, but that was  no hindrance. I did not mean to use the money, only to show it; and long before  the colonel could return, my own five thousand would be in my hands&mdash;and so, and  so, and so, as the devil reasons and young infatuated ears listen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Colonel  Japha thought I was an honest man, nor did I consider myself otherwise at that  time. It was a chance for clever action; a bit of opportune luck that it would  be madness to discard. On the day the vessel sailed which carried Colonel Japha  out of the country, I went to Mr. Delafield and showed him the five crisp bank  notes that represented as it were by proxy, the fortune I so speedily expected  to inherit. &lsquo;You have wanted to see five thousand dollars in my hand,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;there  they are.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  look of amazement was peculiar and ought to have given me warning; but I was  blinded by my infatuation and thought it no more than the natural surprise  incident to the occasion. &lsquo;I have been made to wait a long time for your  consent to my suit,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;may I hope that you will now give me leave to  press my claims upon your daughter?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did not answer at once, but smiled, eying meanwhile the notes in my hand with a  fascinated gaze which instinctively warned me to return them to my pocket. But  I no sooner made a move indicative of that resolve, than he thrust out his cold  slim hand and prevented me. &lsquo;Let me see them,&rsquo; cried he.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was no reason for me to refuse so simple a request to one in Mr. Delafield&rsquo;s  position, and though I had rather he had not asked for the notes, I handed them  over. He at once seemed to grow taller. &lsquo;So this is your start off in life,&rsquo;  exclaimed he.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  bowed, and he let his eyes roam for a moment to my face. &lsquo;Many a man would be  glad of worse,&rsquo; smiled he; then suavely, &lsquo;you shall have my daughter, sir.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must have turned white in my relief, for he threw his head back and laughed in  a low unmusical way that at any other time would have affected me unpleasantly.  But my only thought then, was to get the money back and rush with my new hopes  into the room from which came the low ceaseless hum of his daughter&rsquo;s voice.  But at the first movement of my hand towards him, he assumed a mysterious air,  and closing his fingers over the notes, said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;These  are yours, to do what you wish with, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  may have blushed, but if I did, he took no notice. &lsquo;What I wish to do with  them,&rsquo; returned I, &lsquo;is to shut them up in the bank for the present, at least  till Ona is my wife.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh  no, no, no, you do not,&rsquo; came in easy, almost wheedling tones from the man  before me. &lsquo;You want to put them where they will double themselves in two  months.&rsquo; And before I could realize to what he was tempting me, he had me down  before his desk, showing me letters, documents, etc., of a certain scheme into  which if a man should put a dollar to-day, it would &lsquo;come out three and no  mistake, before the year was out. It is a chance in a thousand,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;if I  had half a million I would invest it in this enterprise to-day. If you will  listen to me and put your money in there, you will be a rich man before ten  years have passed over your head.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was dazzled. I knew enough of such matters to see that it was neither a hoax  nor a chimera. He did have a good thing, and if the five thousand dollars had  been my own&mdash;But I soon came to consider the question without that conditional.  He was so specious in his manner of putting the affair before me, so masterful  in the way he held on to the money, he gave me no time to think. &lsquo;Say the word,&rsquo;  cried he, &lsquo;and in two months I bring you back ten thousand for your five. Only  two months,&rsquo; he repeated, and then slowly, &lsquo;Ona was born for luxury.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula,  you cannot realize what that temptation was. To amass wealth had never been my  ambition before, but now everything seemed to urge it upon me. Dreams of  unimagined luxury came to my mind as these words were uttered. A vision of Ona  clad in garments worthy of her beauty floated before my eyes; the humble home I  had hitherto pictured for myself, broadened and towered away into a palace; I  beheld myself honored and accepted as the nabob of the town. I caught a glimpse  of a new paradise, and hesitated to shut down the gate upon it. &lsquo;I will think  of it,&rsquo; said I, and went into the other room to speak to Ona.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  if some angel had met me on the threshold! If my mother&rsquo;s spirit or the thought  of your dear face could have risen before me then and stopped me! Dizzy,  intoxicated with love and ambition, I crossed the room to where she sat reeling  off a skein of blue silk with hands that were whiter than alabaster. Kneeling  down by her side, I caught those fair hands in mine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ona,&rsquo;  I cried, &lsquo;will you marry me? Your father has given his consent, and we shall be  very happy.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  bestowed upon me a little pout, and half mockingly, half earnestly inquired, &lsquo;What  kind of a house are you going to put me in? I cannot live in a cottage.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I  will put you in a palace,&rsquo; I whispered, &lsquo;if you will only say that you will be  mine.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A  palace! Oh, I don&rsquo;t expect palaces; a house like the Japhas&rsquo; would do. Not but  what I should feel at home in a palace,&rsquo; she added, lifting her lordly head and  looking beautiful enough to grace a sceptre. Then, archly for her, &lsquo;And papa  has given his consent?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo;  I ardently cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then  Dr. Burton might as well go,&rsquo; she answered. &lsquo;I will trust my father&rsquo;s judgment,  and take the palace&mdash;when it comes.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  that, it was impossible to disappoint her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula,  in stating all this, I have purposely confined myself to relating bare facts.  You must see us as we were. The glamour which an unreasoning passion casts over  even a dishonest act, if performed for the sake of winning a beautiful woman,  is no excuse in my own soul for the evil to which I succumbed that day, nor  shall it seem so to you. Bare, hard, stern, the fact confronts me from the  past, that at the first call of temptation I fell; and with this blot on my character,  you will have to consider me&mdash;unhappy being that I am!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not realize then, however, all that I had done. The operation entered into  by Mr. Delafield prospered, and in two months I had, as he predicted, ten  thousand dollars instead of five, in my possession. Besides, I had just married  Ona, and for awhile life was a dream of delight and luxury. But there came a  day when I awoke to an insight of the peril I had escaped by a mere chance of  the die. The money which I had expected from my aunt&rsquo;s will, turned out to be  amongst certain funds that had been risked in speculation by some agent during  her sickness, and irrecoverably lost. The expression of her good-will was all  that ever came to me of the legacy upon which I had so confidently relied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was sitting with my young wife in the pretty parlor of our new home, when the  letter came from my lawyer announcing this fact, and I never can make you  understand what effect it had upon me. The very walls seemed to shrivel up into  the dimensions of a prison&rsquo;s cell; the face that only an hour before had  possessed every conceivable charm for me, shone on my changed vision with the  allurement, but also with the unreality of a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp. All that might  have happened if the luck, instead of being in my favor, had turned against me,  crushed like a thunderbolt upon my head, and I rose up and left the presence of  my young wife, with the knowledge at my heart that I was no more nor less than  a thief in the eyes of God, if not in that of my fellow-men; a base thief, who  if he did not meet his fit punishment, was only saved from it by fortuitous  circumstances and the ignorance of those he had been so near despoiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  bitterness of that hour never passed away. The streets in which I had been  raised, the house which had been the scene of my temptation, Mr. Delafield&rsquo;s  face, and my own home, all became unendurable to me. I felt as if each man I  met must know what I had done; and secret as the transaction had been, it was  long before I could enter the bank without a tremor of apprehension lest I  should hear from some quarter, that my services there would no longer be  required. The only comfort I received was in the thought that Ona did not know  at what a cost her hand had been obtained. I was still under the glamour of her  languid smiles and countless graces, and was fain to believe that  notwithstanding a certain unresponsiveness and coldness in her nature, her love  would yet prove a compensation for the remorse that I secretly suffered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  distaste for Grotewell culminated. It was too small for me. The money I had  acquired through the use of my neighbor&rsquo;s funds burned in my pocket. I  determined to move to New York, and with the few thousands I possessed, venture  upon other speculations. But this time in all honesty. Yes, I swore it before  God and my own soul, that never again would I run a risk similar to that from  which I had just escaped. I would profit by the money I had acquired, oh yes,  but henceforth all my operations should be legitimate and honorable. My wife,  who was fast developing a taste for ease and splendor, seconded my plans with  something like fervor, while Mr. Delafield actually went so far as to urge my  departure. &lsquo;You are bound to make a rich man,&rsquo; said he &lsquo;and must go where great  fortunes are to be secured.&rsquo; He never asked me what became of the five thousand  dollars I returned to Colonel Japha upon his arrival from Europe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I came to New York.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula,  the man who loses at the outset of a doubtful game, is fortunate. I did not  lose, I won. As if in that first dishonest deed of mine I had summoned to my  side the aid of evil influences, each and every operation into which I entered  prospered. It seemed as if I could not make a mistake; money flowed towards me  from all quarters; power followed, and I found myself one of the most  successful and one of the most unhappy men in New York. There are some things  of which a man cannot write even to the one dear heart he most cherishes and  adores. You have lived in my home, and will acquit me from saying much about  her who, with all her faults and her omissions, was ever kind to you. But some  things I must repeat in order to make intelligible to you the change which  gradually took place within me as the years advanced. Beauty, while it wins the  lover, can never of itself hold the heart of a husband who possesses  aspirations beyond that which passion supplies. Reckless, worldly and  narrow-minded as I had been before the commission of that deed which embittered  my life, I had become by the very shock that followed the realization of my  wrong-doing, a hungry-hearted, eager-minded and melancholy-spirited man, asking  but one boon in recompense for my secret remorse, and that was domestic  happiness and the sympathetic affection of wife and children. Woman, according to  my belief, was born to be chiefly and above all, the consoler. What a man  missed in the outside world, he was to find treasured at home. What a man  lacked in his own nature, he was to discover in the delicate and sublimated one  of his wife. Beautiful dream, which my life was not destined to see realized!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  birth of my only child was my first great consolation. With the opening of her  blue eyes upon my face, a well-spring deep as my unfathomable longing, bubbled  up within my breast. Alas, that very consolation brought a hideous grief; the  mother did not love her child; and another strand of the regard with which I  still endeavored to surround the wife of my youth, parted and floated away out  of sight. To take my little one in my arms, to feel her delicate cheek press  yearningly to mine, to behold her sweet infantile soul develop itself before my  eyes, and yet to realize that that soul would never know the guidance or  sympathy of a mother, was to me at once rapture and anguish. I sometimes forgot  to follow up a fortunate speculation, in my indulgence of these feelings. I was  passionately the father as I might have been passionately the husband and the  friend. Geraldine died; how and with what attendant circumstances of pain and  regret, I will not, dare not state. The blow struck to the core of my being. I  stood shaken before God. The past, with its one grim remembrance&mdash;a remembrance  that in the tide of business successes and the engrossing affection which had  of late absorbed me, had been well-nigh swamped from sight&mdash;rose before me like  an accusing spirit. I had sinned, and I had been punished; I had sown, and I  had reaped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More  than that, I was sinning still. My very enjoyment of the position I had so  doubtfully acquired, was unworthy of me. My very wealth was a disgrace. Had it  not all been built upon another man&rsquo;s means? Could the very house I lived in be  said to be my own, while a Japha existed in want? In the eyes of the world,  perhaps, yes; in my own eyes, no. I became morbid on the subject. I asked myself  what I could do to escape the sense of obligation that overwhelmed me. The few  sums with which I had been secretly enabled to provide Colonel Japha during the  final days of his ruined and impoverished life, were not sufficient. I desired  to wipe out the past by some large and munificent return. Had the colonel been  living, I should have gone to him, told him my tale and offered him the half of  my fortune; but his death cut off all hopes of my righting myself in that way.  Only his daughter remained, the poor, lost, reprobated being, whom he was  willing to curse, but whom he could not bear to believe suffering. I determined  that the debt due to my own peace of mind should be paid to her. But how? Where  was I to find this wanderer? How was I to let her know that a comfortable  living awaited her if she would only return to her friends and home? Consulting  with a business associate, he advised me to advertise. I did so, but without  success. I next resorted to the detectives, but all without avail. Jacqueline Japha  was not to be found.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I did not relinquish my resolve. Deliberately investing a hundred thousand  dollars in Government bonds, I put them aside for her. They were to be no  longer mine. I gave them to her and to her heirs as completely and irrevocably,  I believed, as if I had laid them in her hand and seen her depart with them. I  even inserted them as a legacy to her in my will. It was a clear and definite  arrangement between me and my own soul; and after I had made it and given  orders to my lawyer in Grotewell to acquaint me if he ever received the least  news of Jacqueline Japha, I slept in peace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  the years that followed I have small need to speak. They were the years that  preceded your coming, my Paula, and their story is best told by what I was when  we met again, and you made me know the sweet things of life by entering into my  home. Woman as a thoughtful, tender, elevated being had been so long unknown to  me! The beauty of the feminine soul with its faith fixed upon high ideals, was  one before which I had ever been ready to bow. All that I had missed in my  youth, all that had failed me in my maturing manhood, seemed to flow back upon  me like a river. I bathed in the sunshine of your pure spirit and imagined that  the evil days were over and peace come at last.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  rude and bitter shock awoke me. Ona&rsquo;s father, who had followed us to New York,  and of whose somewhat checkered career during the past few years, I have  purposely forborne to speak, had not been above appealing to us for assistance  at such times as his frequently unfortunate investments left him in a state of  necessity. These appeals were usually made to Ona, and in a quiet way; but one  day he met me on the street&mdash;it was during the second winter you spent in my  home&mdash;and dragging me into a restaurant down town, began a long tale, to the  effect that he wanted a few thousands from me to put into a certain investment,  which if somewhat shady in its character, was very promising as to its results;  and gave as a reason why he applied to me for the money, that he knew I had not  been above doing a wrongful act once, in order to compass my ends, and  therefore would not be liable to hesitate now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was the thunderbolt of my life. My sin was not then buried. It had been known  to this man from the start. With an insight for which I had never given him  credit, he had read my countenance in the days of my early temptation, and  guessed, if he did not know, where the five thousand dollars came from with  which I began my career as speculator. Worse than that, he had led me on to the  act by which he now sought to hold me. Having been the secret agent in losing  my aunt&rsquo;s money, he knew at the time that I was cherishing empty hopes as  regarded a legacy from her, yet he let me dally with my expectations, and ensnare  myself with his daughter&rsquo;s fascinations, till driven mad by disappointment and  longing, I was ready to resort to any means to gain my purpose. It was a  frightful revelation to come to me in days when, if I were not a thoroughly  honest man, I had at least acquired a deep and ineradicable dread of dishonor.  Answering him I know not how, but in a way that while it repudiated his  proposition, unfortunately acknowledged the truth of the suppositions upon  which it was founded, I left him and went home, a crushed and disheartened man.  Life which had been so long in acquiring cheerful hues, was sunk again in  darkness; and for days I could not bear the sight of your innocent face, or the  sound of your pure voice, or the tokens of your tender and unsuspecting presence  in my home. But soon the very natural thought came to comfort me, that the sin  I so deplored was as much dead now, as it was before I learned the fact of this  man&rsquo;s knowledge of it. That having repented and put it away, I was as free to  accept your gentle offices and the regard of all true men, as ever I had been;  and beguiled by this plausible consideration, I turned again to my one visible  source of consolation, and in the diversion it offered, let the remembrance of  this last bitter experience pass slowly from my mind. The fact that Mr.  Delafield left town shortly after his interview with me, and smitten by shame  perhaps, forbore to acquaint us with his whereabouts or afflict us with his  letters, may have aided me in this strange forgetfulness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  other and sharper trials were in store; trials that were to test me as a man,  and as it proved, find me lacking just where I thought I was strongest. Paula,  that saying of the Bible, &lsquo;Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he  fall,&rsquo; might have been written over the door of my house on that day, ten  months ago, when we two stood by the hearthstone and talked of the temptations  that beset humanity, and the charity we should show to such as succumb to them.  Before the day had waned, my own hour had come; and not all the experience of  my life, not all the resolves, hopes, fears of my later years, not even the  remembrance of your sweet trust and your natural recoil from evil, were  sufficient to save me. The blow came so suddenly! the call for action was so  peremptory! One moment I stood before the world, rich, powerful, honored, and  beloved; the next, I saw myself threatened with a loss that undermined my whole  position, and with it the very consideration that made me what I was. But I  must explain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  I entered the Madison Bank as President, I gave up in deference to the wishes  of Mr. Stuyvesant all open speculation in Wall Street. But a wife and home such  as I then had, are not to be supported on any petty income; and when shortly  after your entrance into my home, the opportunity presented itself of investing  in a particularly promising silver mine out West, I could not resist the  temptation; regarding the affair as legitimate, and the hazard, if such it  were, one that I was amply able to bear. But like most enterprises of the kind,  one dollar drew another after it, and I soon found that to make available what  I had already invested, I was obliged to add to it more and more of my  available funds, until&mdash;to make myself as intelligible to you as I can&mdash;it had  absorbed not only all that had remained to me after my somewhat liberal  purchase of the Madison Bank stock, but all I could raise on a pledge of the  stock itself. But there was nothing in this to alarm me. I had a man at the  mine devoted to my interests; and as the present yield was excellent, and the  future of more promise still, I went on my way with no special anxiety. But who  can trust a silver mine? At the very point where we expected the greatest  result, the vein suddenly gave out, and nothing prevented the stock from  falling utterly flat on the market, but the discretion of my agent, who kept  the fact a secret, while he quietly went about getting another portion of the  mine into working order. He was fast succeeding in this, and affairs were looking  daily more promising, when suddenly an intimation received by me in a bit of  conversation casually overheard at that reception we attended together,  convinced me that the secret was transpiring, and that if great care were not  taken, we should be swamped before we could get things into working trim again.  Filled with this anxiety, I was about to leave the building, in order to  telegraph to my agent, when to my great surprise the card of that very person  was brought in to me, together with a request for an immediate interview. You  remember it, Paula, and how I went out to see him; but what you did not know  then, and what I find some difficulty in relating now, is that his message to  me was one of total ruin unless I could manage to give into his hand, for immediate  use, the sum of a hundred thousand dollars.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  facts making this demand necessary were not what you may have been led to  expect. They had little or nothing to do with the new operations, which were  progressing successfully and with every promise of an immediate return, but  arose entirely out of a law-suit then in the hands of a Colorado judge for  decision, and which, though it involved well-nigh the whole interest of the  mine, had never till this hour given me the least uneasiness, my lawyers having  always assured me of my ultimate success. But it seems that notwithstanding all  this, the decision was to be rendered in favor of the other party. My agent,  who was a man to be trusted in these matters, averred that five days before, he  had learned from most authentic sources what the decision was likely to be.  That the judge&rsquo;s opinion had been seen&mdash;he did not tell me how, he dared not,  nor did I presume to question, but I have since learned that not only had the  copyist employed by the judge turned traitor, but that my own agent had been  anything but scrupulous in the use he had made of a willing and corruptible  instrument&mdash;and that if I wanted to save myself and the others connected with me  from total and irremediable loss, I must compromise with the other parties at  once, who not being advised of the true state of affairs, and having but little  faith in their own case, had long ago expressed their willingness to accept the  sum of a hundred thousand dollars as a final settlement of the controversy. My agent,  if none too nice in his ideas of right and wrong, was, as I have intimated, not  the man to make a mistake; and when to my question as to how long a time he  would give me to look around among my friends and raise the required sum, he  replied, &lsquo;Ten hours and no more,&rsquo; I realized my position, and the urgent  necessity for immediate action.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  remainder of the night is a dream to me. There was but one source from which I  could hope in the present condition of my affairs, to procure a hundred  thousand dollars; and that was from the box where I had stowed away the bonds  destined for the use of the Japha heirs. To borrow was impossible, even if I  had been in possession of proper securities to give. I was considered as having  relinquished speculation and dared not risk the friendship of Mr. Stuyvesant by  a public betrayal of my necessity. The Japha bonds or my own fortune must go,  and it only remained with me to determine which.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula,  nothing but the ingrained principle of a lifetime, the habit of doing the honest  thing without thought or hesitation, saves a man at an hour like that. Strong  as I believed myself to be in the determination never again to flaw my manhood  by the least action unworthy of my position as the guardian of trusts, earnest  as I was in my recoil from evil, and sincere as I may have been in my  admiration of and desire for the good, I no sooner saw myself tottering between  ruin and a compromise with conscience, than I hesitated&mdash;hesitated with you  under my roof, and with the words we had been speaking still ringing in my  ears. Ona&rsquo;s influence, for all the trials of our married life, was still too  strong upon me. To think of her as deprived of the splendor which was her life,  daunted my very soul. I dared not contemplate a future in which she must stand  denuded of everything which made existence dear to her; yet how could I do the  evil thing I contemplated, even to save her and preserve my own position!  For&mdash;and you must understand this&mdash;I regarded any appropriation of these funds I  had delegated to the use of the Japhas, as a fresh and veritable abuse of  trust. They were not mine. I had given them away. Unknown to any one but my own  soul and God, I had deeded them to a special purpose, and to risk them as I now  proposed doing, was an act that carried me back to the days of my former  delinquency, and made the repentance of the last few years the merest mockery.  What if I might recover them hereafter and restore them to their place; the  chances in favor of their utter loss were also possible, and honesty deals not  with chances. I suffered so, I had a momentary temptation towards suicide; but  suddenly, in the midst of the struggle, came the thought that perhaps in my  estimate of Ona I had committed a gross injustice, that while she loved  splendor seemingly more than any woman I had ever known, she might be as far  from wishing me to retain her in it at the price of my own self-respect, as the  most honest-hearted wife in the world; and struck by the hope, I left my agent  at a hotel and hurried home through the early morning to her side. She was  asleep, of course, but I wakened her. It was dark and she had a right to be  fretful, but when I whispered in her ear, &lsquo;Get up and listen to me, for our  fortune is at stake,&rsquo; she at once rose and having risen, was her clearest,  coldest, most implacable self. Paula, I told her my story, my whole story as I  have told it to you here. I dropped no thread, I smoothed over no offence.  Torturing as it was to my pride, I laid bare my soul before her, and then in a  burst of appeal such as I hope never to be obliged to make use of again, asked  her as she was a woman and a wife, to save me in this hour of my temptation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula,  she refused. More than that, she expressed the bitterest scorn of my mawkish  conscientiousness, as she called it. That I should consider myself as owing  anything to the detestable wretch who was the only representative of the  Japhas, was bad enough, but that I should go on treasuring the money that would  save us, was disgraceful if not worse, and betrayed a weakness of mind for  which she had never given me credit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But  Ona,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;if it is a weakness of mind, it is also an equivalent to my  consciousness of right living. Would you have me sacrifice that?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I  would have you sacrifice anything necessary to preserve us in our position,&rsquo;  said she; and I stood aghast before an unscrupulousness greater than any I had  hitherto been called upon to face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ona,&rsquo;  repeated I, for her look was cold, &lsquo;do you realize what I have been telling  you? Most wives would shudder when informed that their husbands had perpetrated  a dishonest act in order to win them.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  thin strange smile heralded her reply. &lsquo;Most wives would,&rsquo; returned she, &lsquo;but  most wives are ignorant. Did you suppose I did not know what it cost you to  marry me? Papa took care I should miss no knowledge that might be useful to me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And  you married me knowing what I had done!&rsquo; exclaimed I, with incredulous dismay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I  married you, knowing you were too clever, or believing you to be too clever, to  run such a risk again.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can say no more concerning that hour. With a horror for this woman such as I  had never before experienced for living creature, I rushed out of her presence,  loathing the air she breathed, yet resolved to do her bidding. Can you  understand a man hating a woman, yet obeying her; despising her, yet yielding?  I cannot, <i>now</i>, but that day there seemed no alternative. Either I must  kill myself or follow her wishes. I chose to do the latter, forgetting that God  can kill, and that, too, whom and when He pleases.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Going  down to the bank, I procured the bonds from my box in the safe. I felt like a  thief, and the manner in which it was done was unwittingly suggestive of crime,  but with that and the position in which I have since found myself placed by this  very action, I need not cumber my present narrative. Handing the bonds to my  agent with orders to sell them to the best advantage, I took a short walk to  quiet my nerves and realize what I had done, and then went home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula,  had God in his righteous anger seen fit to strike me down that day, it would  have been no more than my due and aroused in me, perhaps, no more than a  natural repentence. But when I saw her for whose sake I had ostensibly  committed this fresh abuse of trust, lying cold and dead before me, the sword  of the Almighty pierced me to the soul, and I fell prostrate beneath a remorse  to which any regret I had hitherto experienced, was as the playing of a child  with shadows. Had I by the losing of my right arm been able to recall my  action, I would have done it; indeed I made an effort to recover myself; had my  agent followed up with an order to return me the bonds I had given him, but it  was too late, the compromise had already been effected by telegraph and the  money was out of our hands. The deed was done and I had made myself unworthy of  your presence and your smile at the very hour when both would have been  inestimable to me. You remember those days; remember our farewell. Let me  believe you do not blame me now for what must have seemed harsh and unnecessary  to you then.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is but little more to write, but in that little is compressed the passion,  longing, hope and despair of a lifetime. When I told you as I did a few hours  ago that my sin was dead and its consequences at an end, I repeat that I fully  and truly believed it. The hundred thousand dollars I had sent West, had been  used to advantage, and only day before yesterday I was enabled to sell out my  share in the mine, for a large sum that leaves me free and unembarrassed, to  make the fortune of more than one Japha, should God ever see fit to send them  across my pathway. More than that, Mr. Delafield, of whose discretion I had  sometimes had my fears, was dead, having perished of a fever some months before  in San Francisco; and of all men living, there were none as I believed, who  knew anything to the discredit of my name. I was clear, or so I thought, in  fortune and in fame; and being so, dreamed of taking to my empty and yearning  arms, the loveliest and the purest of mortal women. But God watched over you  and prevented an act whose consequences might have been so cruel. In an hour,  Paula, in an hour, I had learned that the foul thing was not dead, that a  witness had picked up the words I had allowed to fall in my interview with my  father-in-law in the restaurant two years before; an unscrupulous witness who  had been on my track ever since, and who now in his eagerness for a victim, had  by mistake laid his clutch upon our Bertram. Yes, owing to the similarity of  our voices and the fact that we both make use of a certain tell-tale word, this  patient and upright nephew of mine stands at this moment under the charge of  having acknowledged in the hearing of this person, to the committal of an act  of dishonesty in the past. A foolish charge you will say, and one easily  refuted. Alas, a fresh act of dishonesty lately perpetrated in the bank,  complicates matters. A theft has been committed on some of Mr. Stuyvesant&rsquo;s  effects, and that, too, under circumstances that involuntarily arouse suspicion  against some one of the bank officials; and Bertram, if not sustained in his  reputation, must suffer from the doubts which naturally have arisen in Mr.  Stuyvesant&rsquo;s breast. The story which this man could tell, must of course shake  the faith of any one in the reputation of him against whom it is directed, and  the man intends to repeat his story, and that, too, in the very ears of him  upon whose favor Bertram depends for his life&rsquo;s happiness and the winning of  the woman he adores. I adore you, Paula, but I cannot clasp you to my heart  across another sin. If the detectives whom we shall call in to-morrow, cannot  exonerate those connected with the bank from the theft lately committed  there&mdash;and the fact that you have been allowed to read this letter, prove they have  not&mdash;I must do what I can to relieve Bertram from his painful position, by  taking upon myself the onus of that past transgression which of right belongs  to my account; and this once done, let the result be for good or ill, any bond  between you and me is cut loose forever. I have not learned to love at this  late hour, to wrong the precious thing I cherish. Death as it is to me to say  good-bye to the one last gleam of heavenly light that has shot across my  darkened way, it must be done, dear heart, if only to hold myself worthy of the  tender and generous love you have designed to bestow upon me. Bertram, who is  all generosity, may guess but does not know, what I am about to do. Go down to  him, dear; tell him that at this very moment, perhaps, I am clearing his name  before the wretch who has so ruthlessly fastened his fang upon him; that his  love and Cicely&rsquo;s shall prosper, as he has been loyal, and she trusting, all  these years of effort and probation; that I give him my blessing, and that if  we do not meet again, I delegate to him the trust of which I so poorly  acquitted myself. But before you go, stop a moment and in this room, which has  always symbolized to my eyes the poverty which was my rightful due, kneel and  pray for my soul; for if God grants me the wish of my heart, he will strike me  with sudden death after I have taken upon myself the disgrace of my past  offences. Life without love can be borne, but life without honor never. To come  and go amongst my fellow-men with a shadow on the fame they have always  believed spotless! Do not ask me to attempt it! Pray for my soul, but pray too,  that I may perish in some quick and sudden way before ever your dear eyes rest  upon my face again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  now, as though this were to be the end, let me take my last farewell of you. I  have loved you, Paula, loved you with my heart, my mind and my soul. You have  been my angel of inspiration and the source of all my comfort. I kneel before  you in gratitude, and I stand above you in blessing. May every pang I suffer  this hour, redound to you in some sweet happiness hereafter. I do not quarrel  with my fate, I only ask God to spare you from its shadow. And He will. Love  will flow back upon your young life, and in regions where our eye now fails to  pierce, you will taste every joy which your generous heart once thought to  bestow on</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Edward  Sylvester.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_40"></a>Chapter 40<br>
    Half-Past Seven</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;I  would it were midnight, Hal, and all well.&rdquo;&mdash;Henry IV.</p>
  <p>The  library was dim; Bertram, who had felt the oppressive influence of the great  empty room, had turned down the lights, and was now engaged in pacing the  floor, with restless and uneven steps, asking himself a hundred questions, and  wishing with all the power of his soul, that Mr. Sylvester would return, and by  his appearance cut short a suspense that was fast becoming unendurable.</p>
  <p>He  had just returned from his third visit to the front door, when the curtain  between him and the hall was gently raised, and Paula glided in and stood  before him. She was dressed for the street, and her face where the light touched  it, shone like marble upon which has fallen the glare of a lifted torch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula!&rdquo;  burst from the young man&rsquo;s lips in surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;  said she, her voice quavering with an emotion that put to defiance all  conventionalities, &ldquo;I want you to take me to the place where Mr. Sylvester is  gone. He is in danger; I know it, I feel it. I dare not leave him any longer  alone. I might be able to save him if&mdash;if he meditates anything that&mdash;&rdquo; she did  not try to say what, but drew nearer to Bertram and repeated her request. &ldquo;You  will take me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  eyed her with amazement, and a shudder seized his own strong frame. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried  he, &ldquo;I cannot take you; you do not know what you ask; but I will go myself if  you apprehend anything serious. I remember where it is. I studied the address  too closely, to readily forget it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shall not go without me,&rdquo; returned Paula with steady decision. &ldquo;If the danger  is what I fear, no one else can save him. I must go,&rdquo; she added, with  passionate importunity as she saw him still looking doubtful. &ldquo;Darkness and  peril are nothing to me in comparison with his safety. He holds my life in his  hand,&rdquo; she softly whispered, &ldquo;and what will not one do for his life!&rdquo; Then  quickly, &ldquo;If you go without me I shall follow with Aunt Belinda. Nothing shall  keep me in the house to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  felt the uselessness of further objection, yet he ventured to say, &ldquo;The place  where he has gone is one of the worst in the city; a spot which men hesitate to  enter after dark. You don&rsquo;t know what you ask in begging me to take you there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do, I realize everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a sudden awe of the great love which he thus beheld embodied before him,  Bertram bowed his head and moved towards the door. &ldquo;I may consider it wise to  obtain the guidance of a policeman through the quarter into which we are about  to venture. Will you object to that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  was her quick reply, &ldquo;I object to nothing but delay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  with a last look about the room, as if some sensation of farewell were stirring  in her breast, she laid her hand on Bertram&rsquo;s arm, and together they hurried  away into the night.</p>

    The Work Of An Hour</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">Base  is the slave that pays.&rdquo;&mdash;Henry V. </p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Heaven  has no rage like love to hatred turned, <br>
  Nor hell a fury like a woman scorned.&rdquo;&mdash;Congreve. </p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester upon leaving the bank, had taken his usual route up town. But after  an aimless walk of a few blocks, he suddenly paused, and with a quiet look  about him, drew from his pocket the small slip of paper which Bertram had laid  on his table the night before, and hurriedly consulted its contents. Instantly  an irrepressible exclamation escaped him, and he turned his face to the heavens  with the look of one who recognizes the just providence of God. The name which  he had just read, was that of the old lover of Jacqueline Japha, Roger Holt,  and the address given, was 63 Baxter Street.</p>
  <p>Twilight  comes with different aspects to the broad avenues of the rich, and the narrow  alleys of the poor. In the reeking slums of Baxter Street, poetry would have  had to search long for the purple glamour that makes day&rsquo;s dying hour fair in  open fields and perfumed chambers. Even the last dazzling gleam of the sun  could awaken no sparkle from the bleared windows of the hideous tenement houses  that reared their blank and disfigured walls toward the west. The chill of the  night blast and the quick dread that follows in the steps of coming darkness,  were all that could enter these regions, unless it was the stealthy shades of  vice and disease.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester standing before the darkest and most threatening of the many dark and  threatening houses that cumbered the street, was a sight to draw more than one  head from the neighboring windows. Had it been earlier, he would have found  himself surrounded by a dozen ragged and importunate children; had it been later,  he would have run the risk of being garroted by some skulking assassin; as it  was, he stood there unmolested, eying the structure that held within its gloomy  recesses the once handsome and captivating lover of Jacqueline Japha. He was  not the only man who would have hesitated before entering there. Low and  insignificant as the building appeared&mdash;and its two stories certainly looked  dwarfish enough in comparison with the two lofty tenement houses that pressed  it upon either side&mdash;there was something in its quiet, almost uninhabited aspect  that awakened a vague apprehension of lurking danger. A face at a window would  have been a relief; even the sight of a customer in the noisome groggery that  occupied the ground floor. From the dwellings about, came the hum of voices and  now and then the sound of a shrill laugh or a smothered cry, but from this  house came nothing, unless it was the slow ooze of a stream of half-melted snow  that found its way from under the broken-down door-way to the gutter beyond.</p>
  <p>Stepping  bravely forward, Mr. Sylvester entered the open door. A flight of bare and  rickety steps met his eye. Ascending them, he found himself in a hall which  must have been poorly lighted at any time, but which at this late hour was  almost dark. It was not very encouraging, but pressing on, he stopped at a door  and was about to knock, when his eyes becoming accustomed to the darkness, he  detected standing at the foot of the stairs leading to the story above, the  tall and silent figure of a woman. It was no common apparition. Like a sentinel  at his post, or a spy on the outskirts of the enemy&rsquo;s camp, she stood drawn up  against the wall, her whole wasted form quivering with eagerness or some other  secret passion; darkness on her brow and uncertainty on her lip. She was listening,  or waiting, or both, and that with an entire absorption that prevented her from  heeding the approach of a stranger&rsquo;s step. Struck by so sinister a presence in  a place so dark and desolate, Mr. Sylvester unconsciously drew back. As he did  so, the woman thrilled and looked up, but not at him. A lame child&rsquo;s hesitating  and uneven step was heard crossing the floor above, and it was towards it she  turned, and for it she composed her whole form into a strange but evil  calmness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  he let you come then!&rdquo; Mr. Sylvester heard her exclaim in a low smothered tone,  whose attempted lightness did not hide the malevolent nature of her interest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  came back in the clear and confiding tones of childhood. &ldquo;I told him you loved  me and gave me candy-balls, and he let me come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  laugh quick and soon smothered, disturbed the surrounding gloom. &ldquo;You told him  I loved you! Well, that is good; I do love you; love you as I do my own eyes  that I could crush, crush, for ever having lingered on the face of my betrayer!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  last phrase was muttered, and did not seem to convey any impression to the  child. &ldquo;Hold out your arms and catch me,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;I am going to jump.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  appeared to comply; for he gave a little ringing laugh that was startlingly  clear and fresh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  asked me what your name was,&rdquo; babbled he, as he nestled in her arms. &ldquo;He is  always asking what your name is; Dad forgets, Dad does; or else it&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s  never seen you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what did you tell him?&rdquo; she asked, ignoring the last remark with an echo of her  sarcastic laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Smith, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  threw back her head and her whole form acquired an aspect that made Mr.  Sylvester shudder. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;Mrs. Smith by all means.&rdquo; Then  with a sudden lowering of her face to his&mdash;&ldquo;Mrs. Smith is good to you, isn&rsquo;t  she; lets you sit by her fire when she has any, and gives you peanuts to eat  and sometimes spares you a penny!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes,&rdquo; the boy cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  put him down on the floor, and gave him his little crutch. Her manner was not  unkind, and yet Mr. Sylvester trembled as he saw the child about to follow her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t  you ever have any little boys?&rdquo; the child suddenly asked.</p>
  <p>The  woman shrank as if a burning steel had been plunged against her breast. Looking  down on the frightened child, she hissed out from between her teeth, &ldquo;Did he  tell you to ask me that? Did he dare&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped and pressed her arms against  her swelling heart as if she would smother its very beats. &ldquo;Oh no, of course he  didn&rsquo;t tell you; what does he know or care about Mrs. Smith!&rdquo; Then with a quick  gasp and a wild look into the space before her, &ldquo;My child dead, and her child  alive and beloved! What wonder that I hate earth and defy heaven!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  caught the boy by the hand and drew him quickly away. &ldquo;You will be good to me,&rdquo;  he cried, frightened by her manner yet evidently fascinated too, perhaps on  account of the faint sparks of kindness that alternated with gusts of passion  he did not understand. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t hurt me; you&rsquo;ll let me sit by the fire and  get warm?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  eat a bit of bread with butter on it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  drew him down the hall. &ldquo;Why do you like to have me come to your house?&rdquo; he  prattled away.</p>
  <p>She  turned on him with a look which unfortunately Mr. Sylvester could not see. &ldquo;Because  your eyes are so blue and your skin is so white; they make me remember her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  who is <i>her</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  laughed and seemed to hug herself in her rage and bitterness. &ldquo;Your mother!&rdquo;  she cried, and in speaking it, she came upon Mr. Sylvester.</p>
  <p>He  at once put out his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know who you are,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I do not think you had better take the  child out to-night. From what you say, his father is evidently upstairs; if you  will give the boy to me, I will take him back and leave him where he belongs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will?&rdquo; The slow intensity of her tone was indescribable. &ldquo;Know that I don&rsquo;t  bear interference from strangers.&rdquo; And catching up the child, she rushed by him  like a flash. &ldquo;You are probably one of those missionaries who go stealing about  unasked into respectable persons&rsquo; rooms,&rdquo; she called back. &ldquo;If by any chance  you wander into his, tell him his child is in good hands, do you hear, in good  hands!&rdquo; And with a final burst of her hideous laugh, she dashed down the stairs  and was gone.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester stood shocked and undecided. His fatherly heart urged him to search  at once for the parent of this lame boy, and warn him of the possible results  of entrusting his child to a woman with so little command over herself. But  upon taking out his watch and finding it later by a good half-hour than he  expected, he was so struck with the necessity of completing his errand, that he  forgot everything else in his anxiety to confront Holt. Knocking at the first  door he came to, he waited. A quick snarl and a surprised, &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; announced  that he had scared up some sort of a living being, but whether man or woman he  found it impossible to tell, even after the door opened and the creature,  whoever it was, rose upon him from a pile of rags scattered in one corner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want Mr. Holt; can you tell me where to find him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Upstairs,&rdquo;  was the only reply he received, as the creature settled down again upon its  heap of tattered clothing.</p>
  <p>Fain  to be content with this, he went up another flight and opened another door. He  was more successful this time; one glance of his eye assured him that the man  he was in search of, sat before him. He had never seen Mr. Holt; but the  regular if vitiated features of the person upon whom he now intruded, his lank  but not ungraceful form, and free if not airy manners, were not so common among  the denizens of this unwholesome quarter, that there could be any doubt as to  his being the accomplished but degenerate individual whose once attractive air  had stolen the heart of Colonel Japha&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
  <p>He  was sitting in front of a small pine table, and when Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s eyes first  fell upon him, was engaged in watching with a somewhat sinister smile, the  final twirl of a solitary nickle which he had set spinning on the board before  him. But at the sound of a step at the door, a lightning change passed over his  countenance, and rising with a quick anticipatory &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he turned with hasty  action to meet the intruder. A second exclamation and a still more hasty recoil  were the result. This was not the face or the form of him whom he had expected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Holt, I believe?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Sylvester, advancing with his most dignified  mien.</p>
  <p>The  other bowed, but in a doubtful way that for a moment robbed him of his usual  air of impudent self-assertion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I have business with you,&rdquo; continued Mr. Sylvester, laying the man&rsquo;s own card  down on the table before him. &ldquo;My name is Sylvester,&rdquo; he proceeded, with a  calmness that surprised himself; &ldquo;and I am the uncle of the young man upon&mdash;whom  you are at present presuming to levy blackmail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  assurance which for a moment had deserted the countenance of the other,  returned with a flash. &ldquo;His uncle!&rdquo; re&euml;choed he, with a low anomalous bow; &ldquo;then  it is from you I may expect the not unreasonable sum which I demand as the  price of my attentions to your nephew&rsquo;s interest. Very good, I am not  particular from what quarter it comes, so that it does come and that before the  clock has struck the hour which I have set as the limit of my forbearance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  is seven o&rsquo;clock, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  is seven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester folded his arms and sternly eyed the man before him. &ldquo;You still  adhere to your intention, then, of forwarding to Mr. Stuyvesant at that hour,  the sealed communication now in the hands of your lawyer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  smile with which the other responded was like the glint of a partly sheathed  dagger. &ldquo;My lawyer has already received his instructions. Nothing but an  immediate countermand on my part, will prevent the communication of which you  speak, from going to Mr. Stuyvesant at seven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  sigh which rose in Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s breast did not disturb the severe immobility  of his lip. &ldquo;Have you ever considered the possibility,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;of the man  whom you overheard talking in the restaurant in Dey Street two years ago, not  being Mr. Bertram Sylvester of the Madison Bank?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  returned the other, with a short, sharp, and wholly undisturbed laugh, &ldquo;I do  not think I ever have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you give me credit, then, for speaking with reason, when I declare to you that  the man you overheard talking in the manner you profess to describe in your  communication, was not Mr. Bertram Sylvester?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  shrug of the shoulders, highly foreign and suggestive, was the other&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;It  was Mr. Sylvester or it was the devil,&rdquo; proclaimed he&mdash;&ldquo;with all deference to  your reason, my good sir; or why are you here?&rdquo; he keenly added.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester did not reply. With a sarcastic twitch of his lips the man took up  the nickle with which he had been amusing himself when the former came in, and  set it spinning again upon the table. &ldquo;It is half-past six,&rdquo; remarked he. &ldquo;It  will take me a good half hour to go to my lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester made a final effort. &ldquo;If you could be convinced,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that you  have got your grasp upon the wrong man, would you still persist in the course  upon which you seem determined?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a dexterous sleight-of-hand movement, the man picked up the whirling nickle and  laid it flat on the table before him. &ldquo;A fellow whose whole fortune is  represented by a coin like that&rdquo;&mdash;tapping the piece significantly&mdash;&ldquo;is not as  easily convinced as a man of your means, perhaps. But if I should be brought to  own that I had made a mistake in my man, I should still feel myself justified  in proceeding against him, since my very accusation of him seems to be enough  to arouse such interest on the part of his friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo;  leaped to Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s lips, but he did not speak it. &ldquo;His friends,&rdquo;  declared he, &ldquo;have most certainly a great interest in his reputation and his  happiness; but they never will pay any thing upon coercion to preserve the one  or to insure the other.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; And for the first time Roger Holt slightly quavered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  man&rsquo;s honor and happiness are much, and he will struggle long before he will  consent to part from them. But a citizen of a great town like this, owes  something to his fellows, and submitting to blackmail is but a poor precedent  to set. You will have to proceed as you will, Mr. Holt; neither my nephew nor  myself, have any money to give you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  glare in the man&rsquo;s eyes was like that of an aroused tiger. &ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo;  cried he, &ldquo;that you will not give from your abundance, a paltry thousand  dollars to save one of your blood from a suspicion that will never leave him, <i>never  leave him</i> to the end of his miserable days?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean to say that not one cent will pass from me to you in payment of a silence,  which as a gentleman, you ought to feel it incumbent upon you to preserve  unasked, if only to prove to your fellow-men that you have not entirely lost  all the instincts of the caste to which you once belonged. Not that I look for  anything so disinterested from you,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;A man who could enter the  home of a respectable gentleman, and under cover of a brotherly regard, lure  into degradation and despair, the woman who was at once its ornament and pride,  cannot be expected to practice the virtues of ordinary manhood, much less those  of a gentleman and a Christian. He is a wretch, who, whatever his breeding or  antecedents, is open to nothing but execration and contempt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  an oath and a quick backward spring, Roger Holt cried out, &ldquo;Who are you, and by  what right do you come here to reproach me with a matter dead and buried, by  heaven, a dozen years ago?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  right of one who, though a stranger, knows well what you are and what you have  done. Colonel Japha himself is dead, but the avenger of his honor yet lives!  Roger Holt, <i>where is Jacqueline Japha</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  force with which this was uttered, seemed to confound the man. For a moment he  stood silent, his eye upon his guest, then a subtle change took place in his  expression; he smiled with a slow devilish meaning, and tossing his head with  an airy gesture, lightly remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must ask some more constant lover than I. A woman who was charming ten years  ago&mdash;Bah! what would I be likely to know about her now!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything,  when that woman is Jacqueline Japha,&rdquo; cried Mr. Sylvester, advancing upon him  with a look that would have shaken most men, but which only made the eye of  this one burn more eagerly. &ldquo;Though you might easily wish to give her the slip,  she is not one to forget you. If she is alive, you know where she is; speak  then, and let the worth of one good action make what amends it can for a long  list of evil ones.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  really want to see the woman, then; enough to pay for it, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  reward which has been offered for news of the fate or whereabouts of Jacqueline  Japha, still stands good,&rdquo; was Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s reply.</p>
  <p>The  excited stare with which the man received this announcement, slowly subsided  into his former subtle look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we will see.&rdquo; The truth was, that he knew no more than the  other where this woman was to be found. &ldquo;If I happen to come across her in any  of my wanderings, I shall know where to apply for means to make her welcome. But  that is not what at present concerns us. Your nephew is losing ground with  every passing minute. In a half-hour more his future will be decided, unless  you bid me order my lawyer to delay the forwarding of that communication to Mr.  Stuyvesant. In that case&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe I have already made it plain to you that I have no intentions of  interfering with your action in this matter,&rdquo; quoth Mr. Sylvester, turning  slowly toward the door. &ldquo;If you are determined to send your statement, it must  go, only&mdash;&rdquo; And here he turned upon the bitterly disappointed man with an aspect  whose nobility the other was but little calculated to appreciate&mdash;&ldquo;only when you  do so, be particular to state that the person whose story you thus forward to a  director of the Madison Bank, is not Bertram Sylvester, the cashier, but Edward  Sylvester, his uncle, and the bank&rsquo;s president.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  the stately head bowed and the tall form was about to withdraw, when Holt with  an excited tremble that affected even his words, advanced and seized Mr.  Sylvester by the arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  uncle!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;why that is what you&mdash;Great heaven!&rdquo; he exclaimed, falling  back with an expression not unmixed with awe, &ldquo;you are the man and you have  denounced yourself!&rdquo; Then quickly, &ldquo;Speak again; let me hear your voice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  Mr. Sylvester with a sad smile, repeated in a slow and meaning tone, &ldquo;It is but  one little <i>fuss</i> more!&rdquo; then as the other cringed, added a dignified, &ldquo;Good  evening, Mr. Holt,&rdquo; and passed swiftly across the room towards the door.</p>
  <p>What  was it that stopped him half-way, and made him look back with such a startled  glance at the man he had left behind him? A smell of smoke in the air, the  faint yet unmistakable odor of burning wood, as though the house were on fire,  or&mdash;</p>
  <p>Ha!  the man himself has discerned it, is on his feet, is at the window, has seen  what? His cry of mingled terror and dismay does not reveal. Mr. Sylvester  hastens to his side.</p>
  <p>The  sight which met his eyes, did not for the moment seem sufficient to account for  the degree of emotion expressed by the other. To be sure, the lofty  tenement-house which towered above them from the other side of the narrow yard  upon which the window looked, was oozing with smoke, but there were no flames  visible, and as yet no special manifestations of alarm on the part of its occupants.  But in an instant, even while they stood there, arose the sudden and awful cry  of &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; and at the same moment they beheld the roof and casements before  them, swarm with pallid faces, as men, women and children rushed to the first  outlet that offered escape, only to shrink back in renewed terror from the  deadly gulf that yawned beneath them.</p>
  <p>It  was horrible, all the more that the fire seemed to be somewhere in the basement  story, possibly at the foot of the stairs, for none of the poor shrieking wretches  before them seemed to make any effort to escape downwards, but rather surged up  towards the top of the building, waving their arms as they fled, and filling  the dusk with cries that drowned the sound of the coming engines.</p>
  <p>The  scene appeared to madden Holt. &ldquo;My boy! my boy! my boy!&rdquo; rose from his lips in  an agonized shriek; then as Mr. Sylvester gave a sudden start, cried out with  indiscribable anguish, &ldquo;He is there, my boy, my own little chap! A woman in  that house has bewitched him, and when he is not with me, he is always at her  side. O God, curses on my head for ever letting him out of my sight! Do you see  him, sir? Look for him, I beseech you; he is lame and small; his head would  barely reach to the top of the window-sill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that was your boy!&rdquo; cried Mr. Sylvester. And struck by an appeal which in spite  of his abhorrence of the man at his side, woke every instinct of fatherhood  within him, he searched with his glance the long row of windows before them.  But before his eye had travelled half way across the building, he felt the man  at his side quiver with sudden agony, and following the direction of his  glance, saw a wan, little countenance looking down upon them from a window  almost opposite to where they stood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is my boy!&rdquo; shrieked the man, and in his madness would have leaped from the  casement, if Mr. Sylvester had not prevented him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will not help him so,&rdquo; cried the latter. &ldquo;See, he is only a few feet above a  bridge that appears to communicate with the roof of the next house. If he could  be let down&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the man had already precipitated himself towards the door of the room in which  they were. &ldquo;Tell him not to jump,&rdquo; he called back. &ldquo;I am going next door and  will reach him in a moment. Tell him to hold on till I come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester at once raised his voice. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jump, little boy Holt. If there is  no one there to drop you down, wait for your father. He is going on the bridge  and will catch you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  little fellow seemed to hear, for he immediately held out his arms, but if he  spoke, his voice was drowned in the frightful hubbub. Meanwhile the smoke  thickened around him, and a dull ominous glare broke out from the midst of the  building, against which his weazen little face looked pallid as death.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  father will be too late,&rdquo; groaned Mr. Sylvester, feeling himself somehow to  blame for the child&rsquo;s horrible situation; then observing that the other  occupants of the building had all disappeared towards the front, realized that  whatever fire-escapes may have been provided, were doubtless in that direction,  and raising his voice once more, called out across the yard, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait any  longer, little fellow; follow the rest to the front; you will be burned if you  stay there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the child did not move, only held out his arms in a way to unman the strongest  heart; and presently while Mr. Sylvester was asking himself what could be done,  he heard his shrill piping tones rising above the hiss of the flames, and  listening, caught the words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot get away. She is holding me, Dad. Help your little feller; help me, I&rsquo;m  so afraid of being burnt.&rdquo; And looking closer, Mr. Sylvester discerned the  outlines of a woman&rsquo;s head and shoulders above the small white face.</p>
  <p>A  distinct and positive fear at once seized him. Leaning out, the better to  display his own face and figure, he called to that unknown woman to quit her  hold and let the child go; but a discordant laugh, rising above the roar of the  approaching flames, was his only reply. Sickened with apprehension, he drew  back and himself made for the stairs in the wild idea of finding the father.  But just then the mad figure of Holt appeared at the door, with frenzy in all  his looks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot push through the crowd,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I have fought and struggled and  shrieked, but it is all of no use. My boy is burning alive and I cannot reach  him.&rdquo; A lurid flame shot at that moment from the building before them, as if in  emphasis to his words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is prisoned there by a woman,&rdquo; cried Mr. Sylvester, pointing to the figure  whose distorted outlines was every moment becoming more and more visible in the  increasing glare. &ldquo;See, she has him tight in her arms and is pressing him  against the window-sill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man with a terrible recoil, looked in the direction of his child, saw the  little white face with its wild expression of conscious terror, saw the face of  her who towered implacably behind it, and shrieked appalled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jacqueline!&rdquo;  he cried, and put his hands up before his face as if his eyes had fallen upon  an avenging spirit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that Jacqueline Japha?&rdquo; asked Mr. Sylvester, dragging down the other&rsquo;s hands  and pointing relentlessly towards the ominous figure in the window before him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  or her ghost,&rdquo; cried the other, shuddering under a horror that left him little  control of his reason.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  your boy is lost,&rdquo; murmured Mr. Sylvester, with a vivid remembrance of the  words he had overheard. &ldquo;She will never save her rival&rsquo;s child, never.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man looked at him with dazed eyes. &ldquo;She shall save him,&rdquo; he cried, and  stretching far out of the window by which he stood, he pointed to the bridge  and called out, &ldquo;Drop him, Jacqueline, don&rsquo;t let him burn. He can still reach  the next house if he runs. Save my darling, save him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the woman as if waiting for his voice, only threw back her head, and while a  bursting flame flashed up behind her, shrieked mockingly back:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  I have frightened you up at last, have I? You can see me now, can you? You can  call on Jacqueline now? The brat can make you speak, can he? Well, well, call  away, I love to hear your voice. It is music to me even in the face of death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  boy! my boy,&rdquo; was all he could gasp; &ldquo;save the child, Jacqueline, only save the  child!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the harsh scornful laugh she returned, spoke little of saving. &ldquo;He is so dear,&rdquo;  she hissed. &ldquo;I love the offspring of my rival so much! the child that has taken  the place of my own darling, dead before ever I had seen its innocent eyes. Oh  yes, yes, I will save it, save it as my own was saved. When I saw the puny  infant in your arms the day you passed me with <i>her</i>, I swore to be its  friend, don&rsquo;t you remember! And I am so much of a one that I stick by him to  the death, don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; And raising him up in her arms till his whole  stunted body was visible, she turned away her brow and seemed to laugh in the  face of the flames.</p>
  <p>The  father writhed below in his agony. &ldquo;Forgive,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;forgive the past and  give me back my child. It&rsquo;s all I have to love; it&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve ever loved. Be  merciful, Jacqueline, be merciful!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  face flashed back upon him, still and white. &ldquo;And what mercy have you ever shown  to me! Fool, idiot, don&rsquo;t you see I have lived for this hour! To make you feel  for once; to make you suffer for once as I have suffered. You love the boy!  Roger Holt, I once loved you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  heedless of the rolling volume of smoke that now began to pour towards her,  heedless even of the long tongues of hungry flame that were stretched out as if  feeling for her from the distance behind, she stood immovable, gazing down upon  the casement where he knelt, with an indescribable and awful smile upon her  lips.</p>
  <p>The  sight was unbearable. With an instinct of despair both men drew back, when  suddenly they saw the woman start, unloose her clasp and drop the child out of  her arms upon the bridge. A hissing stream of water had fallen upon the flames,  and the shock had taken her by surprise. In a moment the father was himself  again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get  up, little feller, get up,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;or if you cannot walk, crawl along the  bridge to the next house. I see a fireman there; he will lift you in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  at that moment the flames, till now held under some control, burst from an  adjoining window, and caught at the woodwork of the bridge. The father yelled  in dismay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hurry,  little feller, hurry!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Get over towards the next house before it is  too late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  a paralysis seemed to have seized the child; he arose, then stopped, and  looking wildly about, shook his head. &ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I cannot.&rdquo; And the  woman laughed, and with a hug of her empty arms, seemed to throw her taunts  into the space before her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you a demon?&rdquo; burst from Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s lips in uncontrollable horror. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you see you can save him if you will? Jump down, then, and carry him across, or  your father&rsquo;s curse will follow you to the world beyond.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  climb down,&rdquo; cried the fireman, &ldquo;you are lighter than I. Don&rsquo;t waste a minute,  a second.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is your own child, Jacqueline, your own child!&rdquo; came from Holt&rsquo;s white lips in  final desperation. &ldquo;I have deceived you; your baby did not die; I wanted to get  rid of you and I wanted to save him, so I lied to you. The baby did not die; he  lived, and that is he you see lying helpless on the bridge beneath you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Not  the clutch of an advancing flame could have made her shrink more fearfully. &ldquo;It  is false,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;you are lying now; you want me to save <i>her</i> child,  and dare to say it is mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  God lives!&rdquo; he swore, lifting his hand and turning his face to the sky.</p>
  <p>Her  whole attitude seemed to cry, &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; to his assertion but slowly as she  stood there, the conviction of its truth seemed to strike her, and her hair  rose on her forehead and she swayed to and fro, as if the earth were rolling  under her feet. Suddenly she gave a yell, and bounded from the window. Catching  the child in her arms, she attempted to regain the refuge beyond, but the  flames had not dallied at their work while she hesitated. The bridge was on  fire and her retreat was cut off. She did not attempt to escape. Stopping in  the centre of the rocking mass, she looked down as only a mother in her last  agony can do, on the child she held folded in her arms; then as the flames  caught at her floating garments, stooped her head and printed one wild and  passionate kiss upon his brow. Another instant and they saw her head rise to  the accusing heavens, then all was rush and horror, and the swaying structure  fell before their eyes, sweeping its living freight into the courtyard beneath  their feet.</p>

    Paula Relates A Story She Has Heard</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;None  are so desolate but something dear, <br>
  Dearer than self, possesses or possessed.&rdquo;&mdash;Byron. </p>
  <p>In  the centre of a long low room not far from the scene of the late disaster, a  solitary lamp was burning. It had been lit in haste and cast but a feeble  flame, but its light was sufficient to illuminate the sad and silent group that  gathered under its rays.</p>
  <p>On  a bench by the wall, crouched the bowed and stricken form of Roger Holt, his  face buried in his hands, his whole attitude expressive of the utmost grief; at  his side stood Mr. Sylvester, his tall figure looming sombrely in the dim  light; and on the floor at their feet, lay the dead form of the little lame  boy.</p>
  <p>But  it was not upon their faces, sad and striking as they were, that the eyes of  the few men and women scattered in the open door-way, rested most intently. It  was upon her, the bruised, bleeding, half-dead mother, who kneeling above the  little corpse, gazed down upon it with the immobility of despair, moaning in  utter heedlessness of her own condition, &ldquo;My baby, my baby, my own, own baby!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  fixedness with which she eyed the child, though the blood was streaming from  her forehead and bathing with a still deeper red her burned and blistered arms,  made Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s sympathetic heart beat. Turning to the silent figure of  Holt, he touched him on the arm and said with a gesture in her direction:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have not deceived the woman? That is really her own child that lies there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man beside him, started, looked up with slowly comprehending eyes, and  mechanically bowed his head. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented he, and relapsed into his former  heavy silence.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester touched him again. &ldquo;If it is hers, how came she not to know it? How  could you manage to deceive such a woman as that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Holt  started again and muttered, &ldquo;She was sick and insensible. She never saw the  baby; I sent it away, and when she came to herself, told her it was dead. We  had become tired of each other long before, and only needed the breaking of  this bond to separate us. When she saw me again, it was with another woman at  my side and an infant in my arms. The child was weakly and looked younger than  he was. She thought it her rival&rsquo;s and I did not undeceive her.&rdquo; And the heavy  head again fell forward, and nothing disturbed the sombre silence of the room  but the low unvarying moan of the wretched mother, &ldquo;My baby, my baby, my own,  own baby!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester moved over to her side. &ldquo;Jacqueline,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the child is dead and  you yourself are very much hurt. Won&rsquo;t you let these good women lay you on a  bed, and do what they can to bind up your poor blistered arms?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  she heard him no more than the wind&rsquo;s blowing. &ldquo;My baby,&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;my own,  own baby!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  drew back with a troubled air. Grief like this he could understand but knew not  how to alleviate. He was just on the point of beckoning forward one of the many  women clustered in the door-way, when there came a sound from without that made  him start, and in another moment a young man had stepped hastily into the room,  followed by a girl, who no sooner saw Mr. Sylvester, than she bounded forward  with a sudden cry of joy and relief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertram!  Paula! What does this mean? What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  burst of sobs from the agitated girl was her sole reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such  a night! such a place!&rdquo; he exclaimed, throwing his arm about Paula with a look  that made her tremble through her tears. &ldquo;Were you so anxious about me, little  one?&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Would not your fears let you rest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no; and we have had such a dreadful time since we got here. The house where we  expected to find you, is on fire, and we thought of nothing else but that you  had perished within it. But finally some one told us to come here, and&mdash;&rdquo; She  paused horror-stricken; her eyes had just fallen upon the little dead child and  the moaning mother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is Jacqueline Japha,&rdquo; whispered Mr. Sylvester. &ldquo;We have found her, only to  close her eyes, I fear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jacqueline  Japha!&rdquo; Paula&rsquo;s hands unclosed from his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was in the large tenement house that burned first; that is her child whose loss  she is mourning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jacqueline  Japha!&rdquo; again fell with an indescribable tone from Paula&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;And who is  that?&rdquo; she asked, turning and indicating the silent figure by the wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is Roger Holt, the man who should have been her husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I remember him,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;and her, I remember her, and the little child too.  But,&rdquo; she suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;she told me then that she was not his mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  she did not know that she was; the man had deceived her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a quick thrill Paula bounded forward. &ldquo;Jacqueline Japha,&rdquo; she cried, falling  with outstretched hands beside the poor creature; &ldquo;thank God you are found at  last!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the woman was as insensible to this cry as she had been to all others. &ldquo;My  baby,&rdquo; she wailed, &ldquo;my baby, my own, own baby!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paula  recoiled in dismay, and for a moment stood looking down with fear and doubt  upon the fearful being before her. But in another instant a heavenly instinct  seized her, and ignoring the mother, she stooped over the child and tenderly  kissed it. The woman at once woke from her stupor. &ldquo;My baby!&rdquo; she cried,  snatching the child up in her arms with a gleam of wild jealousy; &ldquo;nobody shall  touch it but me. I killed it and it is all mine now!&rdquo; But in a moment she had  dropped the child back into its place, and was going on with the same set  refrain that had stirred her lips from the first.</p>
  <p>Paula  was not to be discouraged. Laying her hand on the child&rsquo;s brow, she gently  smoothed back his hair, and when she saw the old gleam returning to the woman&rsquo;s  countenance, said quietly, &ldquo;Are you going to carry it to Grotewell to be  buried? Margery Hamlin is waiting for you, you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  start which shook the woman&rsquo;s haggard frame, encouraged her to proceed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  you know she has been keeping watch, and waiting for you so long! She is quite  worn out and disheartened; fifteen years is a long time to hope against hope,  Jacqueline.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  stare of the wretched creature deepened into a fierce and maddened glare. &ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about,&rdquo; cried she, and bent herself again over  the child.</p>
  <p>Paula  went on as if she had not spoken. &ldquo;Any one that is loved as much as you are,  Jacqueline, ought not to give way to despair; even if your child is dead, there  is still some one left whom you can make supremely happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Him?&rdquo;  the woman&rsquo;s look seemed to say, as she turned and pointed with frightful  sarcasm to the man at their back.</p>
  <p>Paula  shrank and hastily shook her head. &ldquo;No, no, not him, but&mdash;Let me tell you a  story,&rdquo; she whispered eagerly. &ldquo;In a certain country-town not far from here,  there is a great empty house. It is dark, and cold, and musty. No one ever goes  there but one old lady, who every night at six, crosses its tangled garden,  unlocks its great side door, enters within its deserted precincts, and for an  hour remains there, praying for one whose return she has never ceased to hope  and provide for. She is kneeling there to-night, at this very hour, Jacqueline,  and the love she thus manifests is greater than that of man to woman or woman  to man. It is like that of heaven or the Christ.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  woman before her rose to her feet. She did not speak, but she looked like a  creature before whose eyes a sudden torch had been waved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fifteen  years has she done this,&rdquo; Paula solemnly continues. &ldquo;She promised, you know;  and she never has forgotten her promise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a cry the woman put out her hands. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;stop! I don&rsquo;t believe  it. No one loves like that; else there is a God and I&mdash;&rdquo; She paused, quivered,  gave one wild look about her, and then with a quick cry, something between a  moan and a prayer, succumbed to the pain of her injuries, and sank down  insensible by the side of her dead child.</p>
  <p>With  a reverent look Paula bent over her and kissed her seared and bleeding  forehead. &ldquo;For Mrs. Hamlin&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; she whispered, and quietly smoothed down  the tattered clothing about the poor creature&rsquo;s wasted frame.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester turned quietly upon the man who had been the cause of all this  misery. &ldquo;I charge myself with the care of that woman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and with the  burial of your child. It shall be placed in decent ground with all proper  religious ceremonial.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  you will do this!&rdquo; cried Holt, a flush of real feeling for a moment disturbing  the chalk-white pallor of his cheek. &ldquo;Oh sir, this is Christian charity; and I  beg your pardon for all that I may have meditated against you. It was done for  the child,&rdquo; he went on wildly; &ldquo;to get him the bread and butter he often lacked.  I didn&rsquo;t care so much for myself. I hated to see him hungry and cold and  ailing; I might have worked, but I detest work, and&mdash;But no matter about all  that; enough that I am done with endeavoring to extort money from you. Whatever  may have happened in the past, you are free from my persecutions in the future.  Henceforth you and yours can rest in peace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is well,&rdquo; cried a voice over his shoulder, and Bertram with an air of relief  stepped hastily forward. &ldquo;You must be very tired,&rdquo; remarked he, turning to his  uncle. &ldquo;If you will take charge of Paula, I will do what I can to see that this  injured woman and the dead child are properly cared for. I am so relieved, sir,  at this result,&rdquo; he whispered, with a furtive wring of his uncle&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;that  I must express my joy in some way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester smiled, but in a manner that reflected but little of the other&rsquo;s  satisfaction. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am tired and will gladly delegate my  duties to you. I trust you to do the most you can for both the living and the  dead. That woman for all her seeming poverty is the possessor of a large  fortune;&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;let her be treated as such.&rdquo; And with a final word to  Holt who had sunk back against the wall in his old attitude of silent despair,  Mr. Sylvester took Paula upon his arm, and quietly led her out of this humble  but not unkind refuge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Paula!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  had reached home and were standing in the library.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said she, lowering her head before his gaze with a sweet and conscious blush.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you read the letter I left for you in my desk up stairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  put her hand to her bosom and drew forth the closely written sheet. &ldquo;Every  word,&rdquo; she responded, and smilingly returned it to its place.</p>
  <p>He  started and his chest heaved passionately. &ldquo;You have read it,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and  yet could follow me into that den of unknown dangers at an hour like this, and  with no other guide than Bertram?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she answered.</p>
  <p>He  drew a deep breath and his brow lost its deepest shadow. &ldquo;You do not despise me  then,&rdquo; he exclaimed &ldquo;My sin has not utterly blotted me out of your regard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  glance with which she replied seemed to fill the whole room with its radiance. &ldquo;I  am only beginning to realize the worth of the man who has hitherto been a  mystery to me,&rdquo; she declared. Then as he shook his head, added with a serious  air, &ldquo;The question with all true hearts must ever be, not what a man has been,  but what he is. He who for the sake of shielding the innocent from shame and  sorrow, would have taken upon himself the onus of a past disgrace, is not  unworthy a woman&rsquo;s devotion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester smiled mournfully, and stroked her hand which he had taken in his. &ldquo;Poor  little one,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I know not whether to feel proud or sorry for your  trust and tender devotion. It would have been a great and unspeakable grief to  me to have lost your regard, but it might have been better if I had; it might  have been much better for you if I had!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  why do you say that?&rdquo; she asked, with a startled gleam in her eye. &ldquo;Do you  think I am so eager for ease and enjoyment, that it will be a burden for me to  bear the pain of those I love? A past pain, too,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;that will grow  less and less as the days go by and happiness increases.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  put her back with a quick hand. &ldquo;Do not make it any harder for me than  necessary,&rdquo; he entreated, &ldquo;Do you not see that however gentle may be your  judgment of my deserts, we can never marry, Paula?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  eyes which were fixed on his, deepened passionately. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;no;  not if your remorse for the past is all that separates us. The man who has  conquered himself, has won the right to conquer the heart of a woman. I can say  no more&mdash;&rdquo; She timidly held out her hand.</p>
  <p>He  grasped it with a man&rsquo;s impetuosity and pressed it to his heart, but he did not  retain it. &ldquo;Blessings upon you, dear and noble heart!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;God will hear  my prayers and make you happy&mdash;but not with me. Paula,&rdquo; he passionately  continued, taking her in his arms and holding her to his breast, &ldquo;it cannot be.  I love you&mdash;I will not, dare not say, how much&mdash;but love is no excuse for  wronging you. My remorse is not all that separates us; possible disgrace lies  before me; public exposure at all events; I would indeed be lacking in honor  were I to subject you to these.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo;  she stammered, drawing back to look into his face, &ldquo;I thought that was all  over; that the man had promised silence; that you were henceforth to be  relieved from his persecutions? I am sure he said so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did, but he forgot that my fate no longer rested upon his forbearance. The  letter which records my admission of sin was in his lawyer&rsquo;s hands, Paula, and  has already been despatched to Mr. Stuyvesant. Say what we will, rebel against  it as we will, Cicely&rsquo;s father knows by this time that the name of Sylvester is  not spotless.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  cry which she uttered in her sudden pain and loss made him stoop over her with despairing  fondness. &ldquo;Hush! my darling, hush!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;The trial is so heavy, I need  all my strength to meet it. It breaks my heart to see you grieve. I cannot bear  it. I deserve my fate, but you&mdash;Oh you&mdash;what have you done that you should be  overwhelmed in my fall!&rdquo; Putting her gently away from his breast, he drew  himself up and with forced calmness said, &ldquo;I have yet to inform Mr. Stuyvesant  upon which of the Sylvesters&rsquo; should rest the shadow of his distrust. To-night  he believes in Bertram&rsquo;s lack of principle, but to-morrow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  trembling lips echoed the word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  shall know that the man who confessed to having done a wrong deed in the past,  is myself, Paula.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  head which had fallen on her breast, rose as at the call of a clarion. &ldquo;And is  it at the noblest moment of your life that you would shut me away from your  side? No, no. Heaven does not send us a great and mighty love for trivial  purposes. The simple country maid whom you have sometimes declared was as the  bringer of good news to you, shall not fail you now.&rdquo; Then slowly and with  solemn assurance, &ldquo;If you go to Mr. Stuyvesant&rsquo;s to-morrow, and you will, for  that is your duty, you shall not go alone; Paula Fairchild accompanies you.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_44"></a>Chapter 44<br>
    In Mr. Stuyvesant&rsquo;s Parlors</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Was  I deceived, or did a sable cloud <br>
  Turn forth her silver lining on the night?&rdquo;&mdash;Comus. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unworthy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cicely  stared at her father with wide-open and incredulous eyes. &ldquo;I cannot believe it,&rdquo;  she murmured; &ldquo;no, I cannot believe it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  father drew up a chair to her side. &ldquo;My daughter,&rdquo; said he, with unusual  tenderness, &ldquo;I have hesitated to tell you this, fearing to wound you; but my  discretion will allow me to keep silence no longer. Bertram Sylvester is not an  honest man, and the sooner you make up your mind to forget him, the better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  honest?&rdquo; You would scarcely have recognized Cicely&rsquo;s voice. Her father&rsquo;s hand  trembled as he drew her back to his side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a hard revelation for me to make to you, after testifying my approval of the  young man. I sympathize with you, my child, but none the less I expect you to  meet this disappointment bravely. A theft has been committed in our bank&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not accuse him of theft! Oh father, father!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  he stammered. &ldquo;I do not accuse him, but facts look very strongly against some  one in our trust, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  that is not sufficient,&rdquo; she cried, rising in spite of his detaining hand till  she stood erect before him. &ldquo;You surely would not allow any mere circumstantial  evidence to stand against a character as unblemished as his, even if he were  not the man whom your daughter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  would not let her continue. &ldquo;I admit that I should be careful how I breathed  suspicion against a man whose record was unimpeached,&rdquo; he assented, &ldquo;but  Bertram Sylvester does not enjoy that position. Indeed, I have just received a  communication which goes to show, that he once actually acknowledged to having  perpetrated an act of questionable integrity. Now a man as young as he, who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I cannot believe it,&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;It is impossible, clearly impossible. How could  he look me in the face with such a sin on his conscience! He could not, simply  could not. Why, father, his brow is as open as the day, his glance clear and  unwavering as the sunlight. It is some dreadful mistake. It is not Bertram of  whom you are speaking!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  father sighed. &ldquo;Of whom else should it be? Come my child, do you want to read  the communication which I received last night? Do you want to be convinced?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no;&rdquo; she cried; but quickly contradicted herself with a hurried, &ldquo;Yes, yes, let  me be made acquainted with what there is against him, if only that I may prove  to you it is all a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no mistake,&rdquo; he muttered, handing her a folded paper. &ldquo;This statement was  written two years ago; I witnessed it myself, though I little knew against  whose honor it was directed. Read it, Cicely, and then remember that I have  lost bonds out of my box at the bank, that could only have been taken by some  one connected with the institution.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  took the paper in her hand, and eagerly read it through. Suddenly she started  and looked up. &ldquo;And you say that this was Bertram, this gentleman who allowed  another man to accuse him of a past dishonesty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  the person declares who forwarded me this statement; and though he is a poor  wretch and evidently not above making mischief, I do not know as we have any  special reason to doubt his word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cicely&rsquo;s  eyes fell and she stood before her father with an air of indecision. &ldquo;I do not  think it was Bertram,&rdquo; she faltered, but said no more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would to God for your sake, it was not!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;But this communication  together with the loss we have sustained at the bank, has shaken my faith,  Cicely. Young men are so easily led astray nowadays; especially when playing  for high stakes. A man who could leave his profession for the sake of winning a  great heiress&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know he has made you think it was for love; but when the woman whom a young man  fancies, is rich, love and ambition run too closely together to be easily  disentangled. And now, my dear, I have said my say and leave you to act  according to the dictates of your judgment, sure that it will be in a direction  worthy of your name and breeding.&rdquo; And stooping for a hasty kiss, he gave her a  last fond look and quietly left the room.</p>
  <p>And  Cicely? For a moment she stood as if frozen in her place, then a great tremble  seized her, and sinking down upon a sofa, she buried her face from sight, in a  chaos of feeling that left her scarcely mistress of herself. But suddenly she  started up, her face flushed, her eyes gleaming, her whole delicate form  quivering with an emotion more akin to hope than despair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot doubt him,&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;it were as easy to doubt my own soul. He is  worthy if I am worthy, true if I am true; and I will not try to unlove him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  soon the reaction came again, and she was about to give full sway to her grief  and shame, when the parlor door opened&mdash;she herself was sitting in the extension  room&mdash;and she saw Mr. Sylvester and Paula come in. She at once rose to her feet;  but she did not advance. A thousand hopes and fears held her enchained where  she was; besides there was something in the aspect of her friends, which made  her feel as though a welcome even from her, would at that moment be an  intrusion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  have come to see father,&rdquo; she thought &ldquo;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ah  what, Cicely?</p>
  <p>Paula,  who was too absorbed in her own feelings to glance into the extension room  beyond, approached Mr. Sylvester and laid her hand upon his arm. &ldquo;Whatever  comes,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;truth, honor and love remain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  he bowed his head and seemed to kiss her hand, and Cicely observing the action,  grew pale and dropped her eyes, realizing as by a lightning&rsquo;s flash, both the  nature of the feeling that prompted this unusual manifestation on his part, and  the possible sorrows that lay before her dearest friend, if not before herself,  should the secret suspicions she cherished in regard to Mr. Sylvester prove  true. When she had summoned up courage to glance again in their direction, Mr.  Stuyvesant had entered the parlor and was nervously welcoming his guests.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester waited for no preamble. &ldquo;I have come,&rdquo; said he, in his most even and  determined tones, &ldquo;to speak to you in regard to a communication from a man by  the name of Holt, which I was told was to be sent to you last evening. Did you  receive such a one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Stuyvesant flushed, grew still more nervous in his manner and uttered a short, &ldquo;I  did,&rdquo; in a tone severer than he perhaps intended.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will not be too much for me, then, to conclude, that in your present estimation  my nephew stands committed to a past dishonesty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  has been one of my chief sources of regret&mdash;one of them I say,&rdquo; repeated Mr.  Stuyvesant, &ldquo;that any loss of esteem on the part of your nephew, must  necessarily reflect upon the peace if not the honor of a man I hold in such  high regard as yourself. I assure you I feel it quite as a brother might, quite  as a brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester at once rose. &ldquo;Mr. Stuyvesant,&rdquo; declared he, &ldquo;my nephew is as honest  a man as walks this city&rsquo;s streets. If you will accord me a few minutes private  conversation, I think I can convince you so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should be very glad,&rdquo; replied Mr. Stuyvesant, glancing towards the  extension-room where he had left his daughter. &ldquo;I have always liked the young  man.&rdquo; Then with a quick look in the other&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;You are not well, Mr.  Sylvester?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, I am not ill; let us say what we have to, at once, if you please.&rdquo; And  with just a glance at Paula, he followed the now somewhat agitated director  from the room.</p>
  <p>Cicely  who had started forward at their departure, glanced down the long parlor before  her, and hastily faltered back; Paula was praying. But in a few moments her  feelings overcame her timidity, and hurrying into her friend&rsquo;s presence, she  threw her arms about her neck and pressed her cheek to hers. &ldquo;Let us pray  together,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
  <p>Paula  drew back and looked her friend in the face. &ldquo;You know what all this means?&rdquo;  she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guess,&rdquo; was the low reply.</p>
  <p>Paula  checked a sob and clasped Cicely to her bosom. &ldquo;He loves me,&rdquo; she faltered, &ldquo;and  he is doing at this moment what he believes will separate us. He is a noble  man, Cicely, noble as Bertram, though he once did&mdash;&rdquo; She paused. &ldquo;It is for him  to say what, not I,&rdquo; she softly concluded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  Bertram is noble,&rdquo; Cicely timidly put in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you ever doubted it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  hiding their blushes on each other&rsquo;s shoulders, the two girls sat breathlessly  waiting, while the clock ticked away in the music-room and the moments came and  went that determined their fate. Suddenly they both rose. Mr. Stuyvesant and Mr.  Sylvester were descending the stairs. Mr. Sylvester came in first. Walking  straight up to Paula, he took her in his arms and kissed her on the forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  betrothed wife!&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
  <p>With  a start of incredulous joy, Paula looked up. His glance was clear but strangely  solemn and peaceful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has heard all I had to say,&rdquo; added he; &ldquo;he is a just man, but he is also a  merciful one. Like you he declares that not what a man was, but what he is,  determines the judgment of true men concerning him.&rdquo; And taking her on his arm,  he stood waiting for Mr. Stuyvesant who now came in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is my daughter?&rdquo; were that gentleman&rsquo;s words, as he closed the door behind him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here,  papa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  held out his hand, and she sprang towards him. &ldquo;Cicely,&rdquo; said he, not without some  tokens of emotion in his voice, &ldquo;it is only right that I should inform you that  we were all laboring under a mistake, in charging Mr. Bertram Sylvester with  the words that were uttered in the Dey Street coffee-house two years ago. Mr.  Sylvester has amply convinced me that his nephew neither was, nor could have  been present there at that time. It must have been some other man, of similar  personality.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  thank you, thank you!&rdquo; Cicely&rsquo;s look seemed to say to Mr. Sylvester. &ldquo;And he is  quite freed from reproach?&rdquo; she asked, with a smiling glance into her father&rsquo;s  face.</p>
  <p>A  hesitancy in Mr. Stuyvesant&rsquo;s manner, struck with a chill upon more than one  heart in that room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he admitted at last; &ldquo;the mere fact that a mysterious robbery has been  committed upon certain effects in the bank of which he is cashier, is not  sufficient to awaken distrust as to his integrity, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  that moment the door-bell rung.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  father would say,&rdquo; cried Mr. Sylvester, taking advantage of the momentary  break, to come to the relief of his host, &ldquo;that my nephew is too much of a  gentleman to desire to press any claim he may imagine himself as possessing  over you, while even the possibility of a shadow rests upon his name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  man who stole the bonds will be found,&rdquo; said Cicely.</p>
  <p>And  as if in echo to her words the parlor door opened, and a messenger from the  bank stepped briskly up to Mr. Stuyvesant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  note from Mr. Folger,&rdquo; said he, with a quick glance at Mr. Sylvester.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Stuyvesant took the paper handed him, read it hastily through, and looked up  with an air of some bewilderment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can hardly believe it possible,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;but Hopgood has absconded.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hopgood  absconded?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  is not that the talk at the bank?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Stuyvesant, turning to the  messenger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  sir. He has not been seen since yesterday afternoon when he left before the  bank was closed for the night. His wife says she thinks he meant to run away,  for before going, he came into the room where she was, kissed her and then  kissed the child; besides it seems that he took with him some of his clothes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  and I had as much confidence in that man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I have now,&rdquo; came from Mr. Sylvester as the door closed upon the messenger. &ldquo;If  Hopgood has run away, it was from some generous but mistaken idea of sacrificing  himself to the safety of another whom he may possibly believe guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  rejoined Mr. Stuyvesant, &ldquo;for here is a note from him that refutes that  supposition. It is addressed to me and runs thus:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  Sir.&mdash;I beg your pardon and that of Mr. Sylvester for leaving my duties in this  abrupt manner. But I have betrayed my trust and am no longer worthy of  confidence. I am a wretched man and find it impossible to face those who have  believed in my honesty and discretion. If I can bring the money back, you shall  see me again, but if not, be kind to my wife and little one, for the sake of  the three years when I served the bank faithfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;John  Hopgood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; cried Mr. Sylvester, &ldquo;that looks&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  if he knew where the money was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  begin to hope,&rdquo; breathed Cicely.</p>
  <p>Her  father turned and surveyed her. &ldquo;This puts a new aspect on matters,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>She  glanced up beaming. &ldquo;Oh, will you, do you say, that you think the shadow of  this crime has at last found the spot upon which it can rightfully rest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would not be common sense in me to deny that it has most certainly shifted its  position.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a radiant look at Cicely, Paula crossed to Mr. Stuyvesant&rsquo;s side, and laying  her hand on his sleeve, whispered a word or two in his ear. He immediately  glanced out of the window at the carriage standing before the door, then looked  back at her and nodded with something like a smile. In another moment he stood  at the front door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  prepared,&rdquo; cried Paula to Cicely.</p>
  <p>It  was well she spoke, for when in an instant later Mr. Stuyvesant re-entered the  parlor with Bertram at his side, the rapidly changing cheek of the gentle girl  showed that the surprise, even though thus tempered, was almost too much for  her self-possession.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Stuyvesant did not wait for the inevitable embarrassment of the moment to  betray itself in words. &ldquo;Mr. Sylvester,&rdquo; said he, to the young cashier, &ldquo;we  have just received a piece of news from the bank, that throws unexpected light  upon the robbery we were discussing yesterday. Hopgood has absconded, and  acknowledges here in writing that he had something to do with the theft!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hopgood,  the janitor!&rdquo; The exclamation was directed not to Mr. Stuyvesant but to Mr.  Sylvester, towards whom Bertram turned with looks of amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  it is the greatest surprise I ever received,&rdquo; returned that gentleman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Mr. Sylvester,&rdquo; continued Mr. Stuyvesant, with nervous rapidity and a generous  attempt to speak lightly, &ldquo;there is a little lady here who is so shaken by the  news, that nothing short of a word of reassurance on your part will comfort  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bertram&rsquo;s  eye followed that of Mr. Stuyvesant, and fell upon the blushing cheek of  Cicely. With a flushing of his own brow, he stepped hastily forward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Stuyvesant!&rdquo; he cried, and looking down in her face, forgot everything else in  his infinite joy and satisfaction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  announced the father with abrupt decision, &ldquo;she is yours; you have fairly  earned her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bertram  bowed his head with irrepressible emotion, and for a moment the silence of  perfect peace if not of awe, reigned over the apartment; but suddenly a low,  determined &ldquo;No!&rdquo; was heard, and Bertram turning towards Mr. Stuyvesant,  exclaimed, &ldquo;You are very good, and the joy of this moment atones for many an  hour of grief and impatience; but I have not earned her yet. The fact that  Hopgood admits to having had something to do with the robbery, does not  sufficiently exonerate the officers of the bank from all connection with the  affair, to make it safe or honorable in me to unqualifiedly accept the inestimable  boon of your daughter&rsquo;s regard. Till the real culprit is in custody and the  mystery entirely cleared away, my impatience must continue to curb itself. I  love your daughter too dearly to bring her anything but the purest of  reputations. Am I not right, Miss Stuyvesant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  cast a glance at her father, and bowed her head. &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
  <p>And  Mr. Stuyvesant, with a visible lightening of his whole aspect, took the young  man by the hand, and with as much geniality as his nature would allow, informed  him that he was at last convinced that his daughter had made no mistake when  she expressed her trust in Bertram Sylvester.</p>
  <p>And  in other eyes than Cicely&rsquo;s, shone the light of satisfied love and unswerving  faith.</p>

  &ldquo;The Hour Of Six Is Sacred&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Mightier  far <br>
  Than strength of nerve or sinew, or the sway <br>
  Of magic potent over sun and  star, <br>
  Is love, though oft to agony distrest, <br>
  And  though its favorite seat be feeble woman&rsquo;s breast.&rdquo;&mdash;Wordsworth. </p>
  <p>It  was at the close of a winter afternoon. Paula who had returned to Grotewell for  the few weeks preceding her marriage, sat musing in the window of her aunt&rsquo;s  quaint little parlor. Her eyes were on the fields before her all rosy with the  departing rays of the sun, but her thoughts were far away. They were with him  she best loved&mdash;with Cicely, waiting in patience for the solution of the mystery  of the stolen bonds; with Bertram, eagerly, but as yet vainly, engaged in  searching for the vanished janitor; and last but not least, with that poor,  wretched specimen of humanity moaning away her life in a New York hospital;&mdash;for  the sight of the Japha house, in a walk that day, had reawakened her most vivid  remembrances of Jacqueline. All that had ever been done and suffered by this  forsaken creature, lay on her heart like a weight; and the question which had  disturbed her since her return to Grotewell, viz., whether or not she ought to  acquaint Mrs. Hamlin with the fact that she had seen and spoken to the object  of her love and prayers, pressed upon her mind with an insistence that required  an answer. There was so much to be said for and against it. Mrs. Hamlin was not  well, and though still able to continue her vigil, showed signs of weakening,  day by day. It might be a comfort to her to know that another&rsquo;s eyes had rested  on the haggard form for whose approach she daily watched; that another&rsquo;s kiss  had touched the scarred and pallid forehead she longed to fold against her  breast; that the woman she loved and of whose fate she had no intimation, was  living and well cared for, though her shelter was that of a hospital, and her  prospects those of the grave.</p>
  <p>On  the other hand, the awful nature of the circumstances which had brought her to  her present condition, were such as to make any generous heart pause before  shocking the love and trust of such a woman as Mrs. Hamlin, by a relation of  the criminal act by which Jacqueline had slain her child and endangered her own  existence. Better let the poor old lady go on hoping against hope till she  sinks into her grave, than destroy life and hope at once by a revelation of her  darling&rsquo;s reckless depravity.</p>
  <p>And  yet if the poor creature in the hospital might be moved to repentance by some  word from Mrs. Hamlin, would it not be a kindness to the latter to allow her,  though even at the risk of her life, to accomplish the end for which she indeed  professed to live?</p>
  <p>The  mind of Paula was as yet undecided, when a child from the village passed the  window, and seeing her sitting there, handed her a small package with the  simple message that Mrs. Hamlin was very ill. It contained, as she anticipated,  the great key to the Japha mansion, and understanding without further words,  what was demanded of her, Paula prepared to keep the promise she had long ago  made to this devoted woman. For though she knew the uselessness of the vigil  proposed to her, she none the less determined to complete it. Easier to sit an  hour in that dark old house, than to explain herself to Mrs. Hamlin. Besides,  the time was good for prayer, and God knows the wretched object of all this  care and anxiety, stood in need of all the petitions that might be raised for  her.</p>
  <p>Telling  her aunts that she had a call to make in the village, she glided hurriedly  away, and ere she realized all to which she was committed, found herself standing  in the now darkened streets, before the grim door of that dread and mysterious  mansion. Never had it looked more forbidding; never had the two gruesome  poplars cast a deeper shadow, or rustled with a more woful sound in the chill  evening air. The very windows seemed to repel her with their darkened panes,  behind which she could easily imagine the spirits of the dead, moving and  peering. A chill not unlike that of terror, assailed her limbs, and it was with  a really heroic action that she finally opened the gate and glided up the path  made by the daily steps of her aged friend. To thrust the big key into the lock  required another effort, but that once accomplished, she stilled every  tumultuous beating of her heart, by crying under her breath, &ldquo;She has done this  for one whom she has not seen for fifteen years; shall I then hesitate, who  know the real necessity of her for whom this hour is made sacred?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  slow swinging open of the door was like an ushering into the abode of ghosts,  but she struck a light at once, and soon had the satisfaction of beholding the  dismal room with its weird shadows, resolve into its old and well remembered  aspect. The ancient cabinet and stiff hair-cloth sofa, Colonel Japha&rsquo;s chair by  the table, together with all the other objects that had attracted her attention  in her former visit, confronted her again with the same appearance of standing  ready and waiting, which had previously so thrilled her. Only she was alone  this time, and terror mingled with her awe. She scarcely dared to glance at the  doors that led to other portions of the house. In her present mood it would  seem so natural for them to swing open, and let upon her horrified gaze the  stately phantom of the proud old colonel or the gentler shade of Jacqueline&rsquo;s  mother. The moan of the wind in the chimney was dreadful to her, and the faint  rumbling sounds of mice scampering in the walls, made her start as though a  voice had spoken.</p>
  <p>But  presently the noise of a sleigh careering by the house recalled her to herself,  and remembering it was but early night-fall, she sat down in a chair by the  door, and prepared to keep her vigil with suitable patience and equanimity.  Suddenly she recollected the clock on the mantel-piece and how she had seen  Mrs. Hamlin wind it, and rising up, she followed her example, sighing  unconsciously to find how many of the sixty minutes had yet to tick themselves  away, &ldquo;Can I endure it!&rdquo; she thought, and shuddered as she pictured to herself  the dim old staircase behind those doors, and the empty rooms above, and the  little Bible lying thicker than ever with dust, on the yellowed pillows of  Jacqueline&rsquo;s bed.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  she stood still; the noise she had just heard, was not made by the pattering of  mice along the rafters, or even the creaking of the withered vines that clung  against the walls! It was a human sound, a clicking as of the gate without, a  crunching as of feet dragging slowly over the snow. Was Mrs. Hamlin coming  after all, or&mdash;she could not formulate her fear; a real and palpable danger from  the outside world had never crossed her fancy till now. What if some stranger  should enter, some tramp, some&mdash;a step on the porch without made her hair rise  on her forehead; she clasped her hands and stood trembling, when a sudden moan  startled her ears, followed by the sound of a heavy fall on the threshold, and  throwing aside all hesitation, she flung herself forward, and tearing open the  door, saw&mdash;oh, angels that rejoice in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, let  your voices go up in praise this night, for Jacqueline Japha has returned to  the home of her fathers!</p>
  <p>She  had fainted, and lay quite still on the threshold, but Paula, who was all  energy now, soon had her in the centre of the sitting-room, and was applying to  her such restoratives as had been provided against this very emergency. She was  holding the poor weary head on her knee, when the wan eyes opened, and looking  up, grew wild with a disappointment which Paula was quick to appreciate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are looking for Margery,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Margery will come by-and-by; she is not  well to-night and I am taking her place, but when she hears you have returned,  it will take more than sickness to keep her to her bed. I am Paula, and I love  you, too, and welcome you&mdash;oh, welcome you so gladly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  yearning look which had crept into the woman&rsquo;s bleared and faded eyes, deepened  and softened strangely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are the one who told me about Margery,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and bade me bring my baby  here to be buried. I remember, though I seemed to pay no heed then. Night and  day through all my pain, I have remembered, and as soon as I could walk, stole  away from the hospital. It has killed me, but I shall at least die in my father&rsquo;s  house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paula  stooped and kissed her. &ldquo;I am going to get your bed ready,&rdquo; said she. And  without any hesitation now, she opened the door that led into those dim inner  regions that but a few minutes before had inspired her with such dread.</p>
  <p>She  went straight to Jacqueline&rsquo;s room. &ldquo;It must all be according to Mrs. Hamlin&rsquo;s  wishes,&rdquo; she cried, and lit the fire on the hearth, and pulled back the  curtains yet farther from the bed, and gave the benefit of her womanly touch to  the various objects about her, till cheerfulness seemed to reign in a spot once  so peopled with hideous memories. Going back to Jacqueline, she helped her to  rise, and throwing her arm about her waist, led her into the hall. But here  memory, ghastly accusing memory, stepped in, and catching the wretched woman in  its grasp, shook her, body and soul, till her shrieks reverberated through that  desolate house. But Paula with gentle persistence urged her on, and smiling  upon her like an angel of peace and mercy, led her up step after step of that  dreadful staircase, till at last she saw her safely in the room of her early  girlhood.</p>
  <p>The  sight of it seemed at first to horrify but afterwards to soothe the forlorn  being thus brought face to face with her own past. She moved over to the fire  and held out her two cramped hands to the blaze, as if she saw an altar of  mercy in its welcoming glow. From these she passed tottering and weak to the  embroidery-frame, which she looked at for a moment with something almost like a  smile; but she hurried by the mirror, and scarcely glanced at a portrait of  herself which hung on the wall over her head. To sink on the bed seemed to be  her object, and thither Paula accompanied her. But when she came to where it  stood, and saw the clothes turned down and the pillows heaped at the head, and  the little Bible lying open for her in the midst, she gave a great and mighty  sob, and flinging herself down upon her knees, wept with a breaking up of her  whole nature, in which her sins, red though they were as crimson, seemed to  feel the touch of the Divine love, and vanish away in the oblivion He prepares  for all His penitent ones.</p>
  <p>When  everything was prepared and Jacqueline was laid quiet in bed, Paula stole out  and down the stairs and wended her way to Mrs. Hamlin&rsquo;s cottage. She found her  sitting up, but far from well, and very feeble. At the first sight of Paula&rsquo;s  face, she started erect and seem to forget her weakness in a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it?&rdquo; she asked; &ldquo;you look as though you had been gazing on the faces of  angels. Has&mdash;has my hope come true at last? Has Jacqueline returned? Oh, has my  poor, lost, erring child come back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paula  drew near and gently steadied Mrs. Hamlin&rsquo;s swaying form. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she smiled;  and with the calmness of one who has entered the gates of peace, whispered in  low and reverent tones: &ldquo;She lies in the bed that you spread for her, with the  Bible held close to her breast.&rdquo;</p>
 <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>There  are moments when the world about us seems to pause; when the hopes, fears and  experiences of all humanity appear to sway away and leave us standing alone in  the presence of our own great hope or scarcely comprehended fear. Such a moment  was that which saw Paula re-enter Jacqueline&rsquo;s presence with Mrs. Hamlin at her  side.</p>
  <p>Leaving  the latter near the door, she went towards the bed. Why did she recoil and  glance back at Mrs. Hamlin with that startled and apprehensive look? The face  of Jacqueline was changed&mdash;changed as only one presence could change it, though  the eyes were clearer than when she left her a few minutes before, and the lips  were not without the shadow of a smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is dying,&rdquo; whispered Paula, coming back to Mrs. Hamlin; &ldquo;dying, and you have  waited so long!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the look that met hers from that aged face, was not one of grief; and startled,  she knew not why, Paula drew aside, while Mrs. Hamlin crossed the room and  quietly knelt down by her darling&rsquo;s side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Margery!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jacqueline!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  two cries rang through the room, then all was quiet again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have come back!&rdquo; were the next words Paula heard. &ldquo;How could I ever have  doubted that you would!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have been driven back by awful suffering,&rdquo; was the answer; and another silence  fell. Suddenly Jacqueline&rsquo;s voice was heard. &ldquo;Love slew me, and now love has  saved me!&rdquo; exclaimed she. And there came no answer to that cry, and Paula felt  the shadow of a great awe settle down upon her, and moving nearer to where the  aged woman knelt by her darling&rsquo;s bedside, she looked in her bended face and  then in the one upturned on the pillow, and knew that of all the hearts that  but an instant before had beat with earth&rsquo;s deepest emotion in that quiet room,  one alone throbbed on to thank God and take courage.</p>
  <p>And  the fire which had been kindled to welcome the prodigal back, burned on; and  from the hollow depths of the great room below, came the sound of a clock as it  struck the hour, seven!</p>

    The Man Cummins</b></h2>
  <p class="quote">Oh  day and night, but this is wondrous strange.&rdquo;&mdash;Henry V.</p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Shut  up in measureless content.&rdquo;&mdash;Othello.</p>
  <p>The  lights were yet shining in Mr. Stuyvesant&rsquo;s parlors, though the guests were  gone, who but a short time before had assembled there to witness the marriage  of Cicely&rsquo;s dear friend, Paula.</p>
  <p>At  one end of the room stood Mr. Sylvester and Bertram, the former gazing with the  eyes of a bridegroom, at the delicate white-clad figure of Paula, just leaving  the apartment with Cicely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have but one cause for regret,&rdquo; said Mr. Sylvester as the door closed. &ldquo;I could  have wished that you and Cicely had participated in our joy and received the  minister&rsquo;s benediction at the same moment as ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Bertram with a short sigh. &ldquo;But it will come in time. It cannot be but  that our efforts must finally succeed. I have just had a new idea; that of  putting the watchman on the hunt for Hopgood. They are old friends, and he  ought to know all the other&rsquo;s haunts and possible hiding-places.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  Fanning could have helped us, he would have told us long ago. He knows that  Hopgood is missing and that we are ready to pay well for any information  concerning him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  they are old cronies, and possibly Fanning is keeping quiet out of  consideration for his friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I have had a talk with Fanning, and there was no mistaking his look of surprise  when told the other had run away under suspicion of being connected with a  robbery on the bank&rsquo;s effects. He knows no more of Hopgood than we do, or his  wife does, or the police even. It is a strange mystery, and one to which I fear  we shall never obtain the key. But don&rsquo;t let me discourage you; after a  suitable time Mr. Stuyvesant will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  paused, for that gentleman was approaching him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is a man outside who insists upon seeing me; says he knows there has just been  a wedding here, but that the matter he has to communicate is very important,  and won&rsquo;t bear putting off. The name on his card is Cummins; I am afraid I  shall have to admit him, that is, if you have no objection?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester and Bertram at once drew back with ready acquiescence. They had  scarcely taken their stand at the other end of the apartment, when the man came  in. He was of robust build, round, precise and business-like. He had taken off  his hat, but still wore his overcoat; his face in spite of a profusion of red  whiskers and a decided pair of goggles, was earnest and straightforward. He  walked at once up to Mr. Stuyvesant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  pardon,&rdquo; said he, in a quick tone. &ldquo;But I hear you have been somewhat exercised  of late over the disappearance of certain bonds from one of the boxes in the  Madison Bank. I am a detective, and in the course of my duty have come upon a  few facts that may help to explain matters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester and Bertram at once started forward; this was a topic that demanded  their attention as well as that of the master of the house.</p>
  <p>The  man cast them a quick look from behind his goggles, and seeming to recognize  them, included them in his next question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you think of the watchman, Fanning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Think?  we don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; uttered Mr. Stuyvesant sharply. &ldquo;He has been in the employ of  the bank for twelve years, and we know him to be honest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  he is the man who stole your bonds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  very man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester stepped up to him. &ldquo;Who are you, and how do you know this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have said my name is Cummins, and I know this, because I have wormed myself  into the man&rsquo;s confidence and have got the bonds, together with his confession,  here in my pocket.&rdquo; And he drew out the long lost bonds, which he handed to  their owner, with a bit of paper on which was in-scribed in the handwriting of  the watchman, an acknowledgment to the effect that he, alone and unassisted,  had perpetrated the robbery which had raised such scandal in the bank and led  to the disappearance of Hopgood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the man himself?&rdquo; cried Bertram, when they had all read this. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I allowed him to escape.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester frowned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is something about this I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;How came you to take  such an interest in this matter; and why did you let the man escape after  acknowledging his crime?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a quick, not undignified action, Cummins stepped back. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it  is allowable in a detective in the course of his duty, to resort to means for  eliciting the truth, that in any other cause and for any other purpose, would  be denominated as unmanly, if not mean and contemptible. When I heard of this  robbery, as I did the day after its perpetration, my mind flew immediately to  the watchman as the possible culprit. I did not know that he had done the deed,  and I did not see how he could have possessed the means of doing it, but I had  been acquainted with him for some time, and certain expressions which I had  overheard him use&mdash;expressions that had passed over me lightly at the time, now  recurred to my mind with startling distinctness. &lsquo;If a man knew the combination  of the vault door, how easily he could make himself rich from the contents of  those boxes!&rsquo; was one, I remember; and another, &lsquo;I have worked in the bank for  twelve years and have not so much money laid up against a rainy day, as would  furnish Mr. Sylvester in cigars for a month.&rsquo; The fact that he had no  opportunity to learn the combination, was the only stumbling-block in the way  of my conclusions. But that obstacle was soon removed. In a talk with the  janitor&rsquo;s wife&mdash;a good woman, sirs, but a trifle conceited&mdash;I learned that he had  once had the very opportunity of which I speak, provided he was smart enough to  recognize the fact. The way it came about was this. Hopgood, who always meant  to do about the right thing, as I know, was one morning very sick, so sick that  when the time came for him to go down and open the vaults for the day, he  couldn&rsquo;t stir from his bed, or at least thought he couldn&rsquo;t. Twice had the  watchman rung for him, and twice had he tried to get up, only to fall back  again on his pillow. At last the call became imperative; the clerks would soon  be in, and the books were not even in readiness for them. Calling his wife to  him, he asked if she thought she could open the vault door provided she knew  the combination. She returned a quite eager, &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; being a naturally vain  woman and moreover a little sore over the fact that her husband never entrusted  her with any of his secrets. &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;listen to those three numbers  that I give you; and turn the knob accordingly,&rsquo; explaining the matter in a way  best calculated to enlighten her as to what she had to do. She professed  herself as understanding perfectly and went off in quite a nutter of  satisfaction to accomplish her task. But though he did not know it at the time,  it seems that her heart failed her when she got into the hall, and struck with  fear lest she should forget the numbers before she got to the foot of the  stairs, she came back, and carefully wrote them down on a piece of paper, armed  with which she started for the second time to fulfil her task. The watchman was  in the bank when she entered, and to his expressions of surprise, she answered  that her husband was ill and that she was going to open the vaults. He offered  to help her, but she stared at him with astonishment, and waiting till he had  walked to the other end of the bank, proceeded to the vault door, and after  carefully consulting the paper in her hand, was about to turn the knob as  directed, when Hopgood himself came into the room. He was too anxious, he said,  to keep in bed, and though he trembled at every step, came forward and  accomplished the task himself. He did not see the paper in his wife&rsquo;s hand, nor  notice her when she tore it up and threw the pieces in the waste-basket  near-by, but the watchman may have observed her, and as it afterwards proved,  did; and thus became acquainted with the combination that unlocked the outer  vault doors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;  broke in Mr. Sylvester, &ldquo;if this is true, why didn&rsquo;t Hopgood inform me of the  matter when I questioned him so closely?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  he had forgotten the circumstance. He was in a fever at the time, and having  eventually unlocked the vault himself, lost sight of the fact that he had  previously sent his wife to do it. He went back to his bed after the clerks  came in, and did not get up again till night. He may have thought the whole  occurrence part of the delirium which more than once assailed him that day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  remember his being sick,&rdquo; said Bertram; &ldquo;it was two or three days before the  robbery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  very day before,&rdquo; corrected the man; &ldquo;but let me tell my story in my own way.  Having learned from Mrs. Hopgood of this opportunity which had been given to  Fanning, I made up my mind to sift the matter. Being as I have said a friend of  his, I didn&rsquo;t, want to peach on him unless he was guilty. To blast an honest  man&rsquo;s reputation, is, I think, one of the meanest tricks of which a fellow can  be guilty: but the truth I had to know, and in order to learn it, a deep and  delicate game was necessary. Gentlemen, when the police have strong suspicions  against a person whose reputation is above reproach and whose conduct affords  no opportunity for impeachment, they set a springe for him. One of their number  disguises himself, and making the acquaintance of this person, insinuates  himself by slow degrees&mdash;often at the cost of months of effort&mdash;into his  friendship and if possible into his confidence. &lsquo;Tis a detestable piece of  business, but it is all that will serve in some cases, and has at least the  merit of being as dangerous as it is detestable. This plan, I undertook with  Fanning. Changing my appearance to suit the necessities of the case, I took  board in the small house in Brooklyn where he puts up, and being well  acquainted with his tastes, knew how to adapt myself to his liking. He was a  busy man, and being obliged by his duties to turn night into day, had not much  time to bestow upon me or any one else; but heedful of this, I managed to make  the most of the spare moments that saw us together, and ere long we were very  good comrades, and further on, very good friends. The day when I first ventured  to suggest that honesty was all very well as long as it paid, was a memorable  one to me. In that cast of the die I was either to win or lose the game I had  undertaken. I won. After a feint or two, to see if I were in earnest, he fell  into the net, and though he did not commit himself then, it was not long before  he came to me, and deliberately requested my assistance in disposing of some  bonds which he was smart enough to acquire, but not daring enough to attempt to  sell. Of course the whole story came out, and I was sympathetic enough till I  got the bonds into my hands, then&mdash;But I leave you to imagine what followed.  Enough that I wrung this confession from him, and that in consideration of the  doubtful game I had played upon him, let him go where he is by this time beyond  the chance of pursuit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  your duty to your superior; your oath as a member of the force?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  superior is here!&rdquo; said the man pointing to Mr. Sylvester; &ldquo;an unconscious one  I own, but still my superior; and as for my being a member of the force, that  was true five years ago, but not to-day.&rdquo; And brushing off his whiskers with  one hand and taking off his goggles with the other, Hopgood, the janitor, stood  before them!</p>

  <p>It  was a radiant figure that met Cicely, when she came down stairs with Paula, and  a joyous group that soon surrounded the now blushing and embarrassed janitor,  with questions and remarks concerning this great and unexpected development of  affairs. But the fervor with which Mr. Stuyvesant clasped Bertram&rsquo;s hand, and  the look with which Cicely turned from her young lover to bestow a final kiss  upon the departing bride, was worth all the pains and self-denial of the last  few weeks&mdash;or so the janitor thought, who with a quicker comprehension than  usual, had divined the situation and rejoiced in the result. But the most  curious thing of all was to observe how, with the taking off of his goggles,  Hopgood had relapsed into his old shrinking, easily embarrassed self. The man  who but a few minutes before had related in their hearing a clear and succinct  narrative, now shrank if a question was put him, and stammered in quite his  ancient fashion, when he answered Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s shake of the hand, by a  hurried:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am going to see my wife now, sir. She&rsquo;s a good woman, if a little flighty, and  will be the last one in the future to beg me to put more confidence in her.  Will you tell me where she is, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sylvester informed him; then added, &ldquo;But look here, Hopgood, answer me one  thing before you go. Why is it that with such talents as you possess, you didn&rsquo;t  stay in the police force? You are a regular genius in your way, and ought not  to drone away your existence as a janitor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  sir,&rdquo; replied the other, shaking his head, &ldquo;a man who is only capable of  assuming one disguise, isn&rsquo;t good for much as a professional detective. Goggles  and red whiskers will deceive one rogue, but not fifty. My eyes were my bane,  sir, and ultimately cost me my place. While I could cover them up I was all  right. It not only made a man of me, leaving me free to talk and freer to  think, but disguised me so, my best friends couldn&rsquo;t recognize me; but after  awhile my goggles were too well known for me to be considered of much further  use to the department, and I was obliged to send in my resignation. It is too  bad, but I have no versatility, sir. I&rsquo;m either the clumsy, stammering creature  you have always known, or else I am the man Cummins you saw here a few minutes  ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  either case an honest fellow,&rdquo; answered Mr. Sylvester, and allowed the janitor  to depart.</p>

  <p>One  more scene, and this in the house which Paula is henceforth to make a home for  herself and its once melancholy owner. They have come back from their  wedding-journey, and are standing in their old fashion, he at the foot, and she  half way up the stairs. Suddenly she turns and descends to his side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I will not wait,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Here, on this spot we both love so well, and in  this the first hour of our return, I will unburden my mind of what I have to  say. Edward, is there nothing of all the past that still rests upon you like a  shadow? Not one little regret you could wish taken away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said he, enfolding her in his arms with a solemn smile. &ldquo;The great gift which I  hold is the fruit of that past, perhaps; I cannot wish it changed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the sense of obligation never fulfilled, would you not be happier if that were  removed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;but it cannot be now. I shall have to live without being perfectly  happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  lifted her face and her smile shone like a star. &ldquo;Oh God is good,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you  shall not lack being perfectly happy;&rdquo; and taking a little paper out of her  pocket she put it in his hand. &ldquo;We found that hidden in Jacqueline Japha&rsquo;s  breast, when we went to lay her out for burial.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was only a line; but it made Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s brow flush and his voice tremble.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatever  I own, and I have been told that I am far from penniless, I desire to have  given to the dear and disinterested girl that first told me of Margery Hamlin&rsquo;s  vigil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paula,  Paula, Paula, thou art indeed my good gift! May God make me worthy of your love  and of this His last and most unexpected mercy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  the look which crossed her face, was that sweet and unearthly radiance which  speaks of perfect peace.  </p>
