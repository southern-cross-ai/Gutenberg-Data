  <p class="first">CONSIDERED merely as literary fashions, romanticism and
  realism are both tricks, and tricks alone. The only advantage lies with
  romanticism, which is a little less artificial and technical than realism.
  For the great majority of people here and now do naturally write romanticism,
  as we see it in a love- letter, or a diary, or a quarrel, and nobody on earth
  naturally writes realism as we see it in a description by Flaubert. But both
  are technical dodges and realism only the more eccentric. It is a trick to
  make things happen harmoniously always, and it is a trick to make them always
  happen discordantly. It is a trick to make a heroine, in the act of accepting
  a lover, suddenly aureoled by a chance burst of sunshine, and then to call it
  romance. But it is quite as much of a trick to make her, in the act of
  accepting a lover, drop her umbrella, or trip over a hassock, and then call
  it the bold plain realism of life. If any one wishes to satisfy himself as to
  how excessively little this technical realism has to do, I do not say with
  profound reality, but even with casual truth to life, let him make a simple
  experiment offered to him by the history of literature. Let him ask what is
  of all English books the book most full of this masterly technical realism,
  most full of all these arresting details, all these convincing irrelevancies,
  all these impedimenta of prosaic life; and then as far as truth to life is
  concerned he will find that it is a story about men as big as houses and men
  as small as dandelions, about horses with human souls and an island that flew
  like a balloon.</p>

  <p>We can never understand a writer of the old romantic school, even if he is
  as great and splendid as Dickens is great and splendid, until we realise this
  preliminary fact to which I have drawn attention. The fact that these merely
  technical changes are merely technical, and have nothing whatever to do with
  the force and truth behind. We are bound to find a considerable amount of
  Dickens's work, especially the pathetic and heroic passages, artificial and
  pompous. But that is only because we are far enough off his trick or device
  to see that it is such. Our own trick and device we believe to be as natural
  as the eternal hills.</p>

  <p>It is no more natural, even when compared with the Dickens devices, than a
  rockery is natural, even when compared with a Dutch flower bed. The time will
  come when the wildest upheaval of Zolaism, when the most abrupt and
  colloquial dialogue of Norwegian drama, will appear a fine old piece of
  charming affectation, a stilted minuet of literature, like little Nell in the
  churchyard, or the repentance of the white-haired Dombey. All their
  catchwords will have become catchwords; the professor's explanations of
  heredity will have the mellow, foolish sound of the villain's curses against
  destiny. And in that time men will for the first time become aware of the
  real truth and magnificence of Zola and Ibsen, just as we, if we are wise,
  are now becoming aware of the real truth and magnificence of Dickens.</p><br>

  <p>This is even more true if we look first at that fundamental optimistic
  feeling about life, which as it has been often and truly said is the main
  essence of Dickens. If Dickens's optimism had merely been a matter of happy
  endings, reconciliations, and orange flowers, it would be a mere superficial
  art or craft. But it would not, as in the case discussed above, be in any way
  more superficial than the pessimism of the modern episode, or short story,
  which is an affair of bad endings, disillusionments, and arsenic. The truth
  about life is that joy and sorrow are mingled in an almost rhythmical
  alternation like day and night. The whole of optimistic technique consists in
  the dodge of breaking off the story at dawn, and the whole of pessimistic
  technique in the art of breaking off the story at dusk. But wherever and
  whenever mere artists choose to consider the matter ended, the matter is
  never ended, and trouble and exultation go on in a design larger than any of
  ours, neither vanishing at all. Beyond our greatest happiness there lie
  dangers, and after our greatest dangers there remaineth a rest.</p>

  <p>But the element in Dickens which we are forced to call by the foolish and
  unmanageable word optimism is a very much deeper and more real matter than
  any question of plot and conclusion. If Mr. Pickwick had been drowned when he
  fell through the ice; if Mr. Dick Swiveller had never recovered from the
  fever, these catastrophes might have been artistically inappropriate, but
  they would not have sufficed to make the stories sad. If Sam Weller had
  committed suicide from religious difficulties, if Florence Dombey had been
  murdered (most justly murdered) by Captain Cuttle, the stories would still be
  the happiest stories in the world. For their happiness is a state of the
  soul; a state in which our natures are full of the wine of an ancient youth,
  in which banquets last for ever, and roads lead everywhere, where all things
  are under the exuberant leadership of faith, hope, and charity, the three
  gayest of the virtues.</p>

  <p>There is, of course, an optimism which is evil and debasing, and to this
  it must be confessed that Dickens sometimes descends. The worst optimism is
  that which, in making things comfortable, prevents them from becoming joyful;
  it bears the same relation to an essential and true optimism that the
  pleasure of sitting in an arm-chair bears to the pleasure of sitting on a
  galloping horse. It is the optimism which denies that burning hurts a martyr.
  More profoundly considered, it may be called the optimism which, in order to
  give a being more life, denies him his individual life; in order to give him
  more pleasure, denies him his especial pleasure. It offers the hunter repose,
  and the student pleasure, and the poet an explanation. Dickens, as I have
  said, sometimes fell into this.</p>

  <p>Nothing could be more atrocious for instance, than his course of action in
  concluding "David Copperfield" with an account of the great Micawber at last
  finding wealth and success as a mayor in Australia. Micawber would never
  succeed; never ought to succeed; his kingdom was not of this world. His mind
  to him a kingdom was; he was one of those splendid and triumphant poor, who
  have the faculty of capturing, without a coin of money or a stroke of work,
  that ultimate sense of possessing wealth and luxury, which is the only reward
  of the toils and crimes of the rich. It is but a sentiment after all, this
  idea of money, and a poor man who is also a poet, like Micawber, may find a
  short cut to it. To make such a man, after a million mental triumphs over
  material circumstances, become the mere pauper and dependant of material
  success, is something more than an artistic blunder: it is a moral lapse; it
  is a wicked and blasphemous thing to have done. The end of "David
  Copperfield" is not a happy ending; it is a very miserable ending. To make
  Micawber a mayor is about as satisfying a termination as it would be to make
  Sir Lancelot after Arthur's death become a pork butcher or a millionaire, or
  to make Enoch Arden grow fat and marry an heiress. There is a satisfaction
  that is far more depressing than any tragedy. And the essence of it, as I
  have said, lies in the fact that it violates the real and profound
  philosophical optimism of the universe, which has given to each thing its
  inconmiunicable air and its strange reason for living. It offers instead,
  another joy or peace which is alien and nauseous; it offers grass to the dog
  and fire to the fishes. It is, indeed, in the same tradition as that cruel
  and detestable kindness to animals, which has been one of the disgraces of
  humanity: from the modern lady who pulls a fat dog on a chain through a
  crowded highway, back to the Roman Caesar who fed his horse on wine, and made
  it a political magistrate.</p>

  <p>The same error in an even more irreverent form occurs, of course, in the
  same book. The essence of the Dickens genius was exaggeration, and in that
  general sense Dora, in "David Copperfield," may be called an exaggerated
  character; but she is an extremely real and an extremely agreeable character
  for all that. She is supposed to be very weak and ineffectual, but she has
  about a hundred times more personal character than all Dickens's waxwork
  heroines put together, the unendurable Agnes by no means excluded.</p>

  <p>It almost passes comprehension how a man who could conceive such a
  character should so insult it, as Dickens does, in making Dora recommend her
  husband's second marriage with Agnes. Dora, who stands for the profound and
  exquisite irrationality of simple affection, is made the author of a piece of
  priggish and dehumanised rationalism which is worthy of Miss Agnes herself.
  One could easily respect such a husband when he married again, but surely not
  such a wife when she desired it.</p>

  <p>The truth is, of course, that here again Dickens is following his evil
  genius which bade him make those he loved comfortable instead of happy. It
  may seem at first sight a paradox to say that the special fault of optimism
  is a lack of faith in God: but so it is. There are some whom we should not
  seek to make comfortable: their appeasement is in more awful hands. There are
  conflicts, the reconciliation of which lies beyond the powers not only of
  human effort but of human rational conception. One of them is the
  reconciliation between good and evil themselves in the scheme of nature;
  another is the reconciliation of Dora and Agnes. To say that we know they
  will be reconciled is faith: to say that we see that they wall be reconciled
  is blasphemy.</p>

  <p>Dickens was, of course, as is repeated <i>ad nauseum</i>, a caricaturist,
  and when we have understood this word we have understood the whole matter;
  but in truth the word, caricaturist, is commonly misunderstood; it is even,
  in the case of men like Dickens, used as implying a reproach. Whereas it has
  no more reproach in it than the word organist. Caricature is not merely an
  important form of art: it is a form of art which is often most useful for
  purposes of profound philosophy and powerful symbolism. The age of scepticism
  put caricature into ephemeral feuilletons: but the ages of faith built
  caricatures into their churches of everlasting stone.</p>

  <p>One extraordinary idea has been constantly repeated, the idea that it is
  very easy to make a mere caricature of anything. As a matter of fact it is
  extraordinarily difficult, for it implies a knowledge of what part of a thing
  to caricature. To reproduce the proportions of a face, exactly as they are,
  is a comparatively safe adventure; to arrange those features in an entirely
  new proportion, and yet retain a resemblance, argues a very delicate instinct
  for what features are really the characteristic and essential ones.</p>

  <p>Caricature is only easy when it so happens that the people depicted, like
  Cyrano de Bergerac, are more or less caricatures themselves. In other words
  caricature is only easy when it does not caricature very much. But to see an
  ordinary intelligent face in the street, and to know that, with the nose
  three times as long and the head twice as broad, it will still be a startling
  likeness, argues a profound insight into truth.</p>

  <p>"Caricature," said Sir Willoughby Patterne, in his fatuous way, "is rough

  unquestionable place among artists.</p>

  <p>He realised thoroughly a certain phase or atmosphere of existence, and he
  knew the precise strokes and touches that would bring it home to the reader.
  That Dickens phase or atmosphere may be roughly defined as the phase of a
  vivid sociability in which every man becomes unusually and startlingly
  himself. A good caricature will sometimes seem more like the original than
  the original: so it is in the greatest moments of social life. He is an
  unfortunate man, a man unfitted to value life and certainly unfitted to value
  Dickens, who has not sat at some table or talked in some company in which
  every one was in character, each a beautiful caricature of
  himself.<span class="smcap"

  <p class="first">THE ASSEVERATION that "Dickens" is "a name to conjure with"
  seems almost a truism. The innumerable editions of his works so constantly
  pouring from the press abundantly testify to the continued and unabated
  popularity of the most famous writer of fiction of the Victorian epoch. As
  regards the circumstances appertaining to his career&mdash;the start in life
  under harassing conditions, the brilliant success attending his initial
  efforts in authorship, the manner in which he took the world by storm and
  retained his grip of the public by the sheer force of genius there is, I
  venture to believe, no parallel in the history of literature.</p>

  <p>Born in a humble station of life, his early years spent in the midst of an
  uncongenial (not to say demoralising) environment, his natural gifts,
  combined with almost superhuman powers of perseverance, enabled him to
  overcome obstacles which would have deterred ordinary men, with the result
  that he rapidly attained the topmost rung of the ladder of fame, and remained
  there.</p>

  <p>Although the leading incidents in the life of Charles Dickens are
  generally familiar, thanks to the various biographies of him published from
  time to time, a few facts, briefly stated, will not, I hope, be devoid of
  interest. The novelist first saw the light at No, 387, Commercial Road, Mile
  End, Landport, in the Island of Portsea. Like David Copperfield, he was born
  on a Friday, the natal day being February 7th, 1812. The baptismal register
  of Portsea Parish Church (St. Mary's, Kingston), where he was christened,
  records that three names were bestowed upon him, Charles John Huffam, the
  second being that of his father, and the third the cognomen of his godfather,
  Christopher Huffam, a "Rigger to his Majesty's Navy," who lived at Limehouse
  Hole, on the north bank of the Thames. The birthplace in Landport&mdash;still
  existing&mdash;is an unpretentious tenement of two storeys, surmounted by a
  dormer window, and fronted by a small railed-in garden.</p>

  <p>John Dickens, the father of Charles, had filled a clerical position in the
  Navy Pay Office, Somerset House, whence he was transferred to a similar post
  at Portsea. About four years after the birth of Charles (the second child),
  the Dickens family removed to Chatham, residing there until the boy was
  eleven years old. It was at Chatham where he first went to school, and where
  he, being endowed with exceptional powers of observation, imbibed his
  earliest impressions of humanity, to be subsequently made available as
  material for his inimitable sketches.</p>

  <p>London, however, was again to be the home of John Dickens&mdash;the mighty
  metropolis which, with its phantasmagoria of life in its every aspect, its
  human comedies and tragedies, ever attracted the great writer, whose magic
  pen revelled in the delineation of them. It was in 1823 that the Dickens
  family took up their residence in Bayham Street, Camden Town&mdash;then the
  poorest part of the London suburbs. There had come a crisis in the affairs of
  the elder Dickens which necessitated the strictest economy, and the house in
  Bayham Street (which may still be seen at No. 141) was nothing but "a mean
  tenement, with a wretched little back garden abutting on a squalid court."
  This was the beginning of a sad and bitter experience in the life of Charles
  Dickens. Here he seemed to fall into a solitary condition, apart from all
  other boys of his own age, and, recalling the circumstances in after years,
  he observed to Forster: "As I thought, in the little back-garret in Bayham
  Street, of all I had lost in losing Chatham, what would I have given, if I
  had had anything to give, to have been sent back to any other school, to have
  been taught something anywhere?"</p>

  <p>Not only did the exceptionally intelligent lad miss the pleasures of
  association with his schoolfellows and playmates at Chatham, but he no longer
  had recourse to the famous books whose acquaintance he had made there "Don
  Quixote," "Robinson Crusoe," "The Arabian Nights," <i>et hoc genus
  omne</i>&mdash;which, as admirers of his works will remember, he was so fond
  of quoting. The account given by Forster of the Bayham Street days is painful
  reading, and we are told that, thus living under circumstances of a hopeless
  and struggling poverty, the extreme sensitiveness of the boy caused him to
  experience acute mental suffering.</p>

  <p>After a short residence in Bayham Street, the family removed their
  belongings to Gower Street North (the identical house was demolished a few
  years ago), and an effort was made to bring grist to the mill by an attempt
  on the part of Mrs. Dickens to start a school for young ladies; but the
  venture proved abortive, notwithstanding the fact that Charles did his utmost
  to aid the project by leaving "at a great many doors, a great many
  circulars," calling attention to the advantages of the establishment.</p>

  <p>John Dickens's financial difficulties increased, tradesmen became
  pertinacious in their claims for a settlement of long-standing debts, which
  could not be met, until at last the father was arrested, and lodged in a
  debtors' prison events which the novelist afterwards vividly recalled, and
  which will be found duly set forth in "David Copperfield."</p>

  <p>It was at this awkward juncture that some relatives of the family, named
  Lambert, realising that an opportunity should he given to the poor neglected
  lad of earning a livelihood, found him an occupation in their blacking-
  manufactory (started in opposition to the famous Warren), and here he earned
  a few shillings a week by covering and labelling pots of paste blacking!
  While infinitely preferable to a state of enforced idleness under
  demoralising conditions, the boy's experience during what is usually referred
  to as "the blacking-bottle period," for ever remained a terrible nightmare,
  and the novelist pointedly referred to that unhappy time when in "David
  Copperfield" he observed that no one could express "the secret agony" of his
  soul as he sank into the companionship of those by whom he was then
  surrounded, and felt his "early hopes of growing up to be a learned and
  distinguished man" crushed in his breast. In respect of a miserable and
  neglected boyhood, Alphonse Daudet suffered as did Charles Dickens, and,
  phoenix-like, both emerged triumphantly from the ashes of what to them
  appeared to be a cruel conflagration of their desires and aspirations.</p>

  <p>There is no doubt that the ordeal of poverty, with its unhappy
  accompaniments, had counteracting advantages in the case of Charles Dickens:
  his natural abilities were sharpened, as well as his powers of observation,
  his excellent memory enabling him in after years to record those actualities
  of life which render his books a perpetual joy and delight. Fortunately,
  brighter days were in store. The elder Dickens (in whom it is easy to detect
  glimpses of Mr. Micawber) was in a position to send Charles to a reputable
  school in the Hampstead Road, known as Wellington House Academy (still
  standing), where he remained two years, and on leaving it he entered another
  scholastic establishment near Brunswick Square, there completing his studies,
  rudimentary at the best.</p>

  <p>The year 1827 proved a memorable one for the subject of this sketch, for
  then it was that he, in his fifteenth year, "began life," first as a clerk in
  a lawyer's office in Lincoln's Inn, and then acting in a similar capacity for
  a firm of attorneys in Gray's Inn, where his weekly salary amounted to
  something under a sovereign. As was his wont, he made mental memoranda of his
  environment, noting the manners, customs, and peculiarities of lawyers, their
  clerks and clients, for the result of which one needs only to turn to the
  pages of the immortal "Pickwick." His father, who had left the Navy Pay
  Office, turned his attention to journalism, and at this time had become a
  newspaper parliamentary reporter. Charles, craving for a similar occupation,
  in which he believed there might be an opening for greater things, resolutely
  determined to study shorthand, and became an assiduous attendant at the
  British Museum.</p>

  <p>His persevering struggle with the mysteries of stenography was recalled
  when recording David Copperfield's experience&mdash;a struggle resulting in
  ultimate victory. Following in his fathers footsteps, he, at the age of
  nineteen, succeeded in obtaining an appointment as a reporter in the Press
  Gallery at the House of Commons, where he was presently acknowledged to be
  the most skilful shorthand writer among the many so engaged there.</p>

  <p>Dickens had just attained his majority when, in 1833, he essayed to
  venture into the realm of fiction. He has himself related how, one evening at
  twilight, he stealthily entered "a dark court" in Fleet Street (it was
  Johnsons Court), and with fear and trembling dropped into "a dark letter-box"
  the manuscript of his first paper&mdash;a humorous sketch entitled "A Dinner
  at Poplar Walk," (afterwards called "Mr. Minns and his Cousin"); and how,
  when it "appeared in all the glory of print," he walked down to Westminster
  Hall, and turned into it for half an hour, because (he explains) his eyes
  "were so dimmed with joy and pride, that they could not bear the street, and
  were not fit to be seen there." To this initial effort (which was published
  in the old <i>Monthly Magazine</i>, December. 1833) there is a slight
  reference in the forty-second chapter of "David Copperfield," where the
  youthful hero intimates that he "wrote a little something", in secret, and
  sent it to a magazine, and it was published in the magazine."</p>

  <p>His journeys across country by coach or postchaise, when reporting for his
  newspaper (the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>), proved invaluable from a literary
  standpoint, inasmuch as those expeditions by day and night and in all seasons
  afforded him special opportunities of studying human idiosyncrasies, as he
  necessarily came into contact with "all sorts and conditions of men."</p>

  <p>The success of his little paper in the <i>Monthly Magazine</i> induced him
  to try his hand at others, for gratuitous publication in the same journal.
  They bore no signature until the sixth sketch appeared, when he adopted the
  curious pseudonym of "Boz": this had for some time been to him a familiar
  household word, as it was the nickname of his youngest brother, Augustus,
  whom (in honour of "The Vicar of Wakefield," one of his favourite books) he
  had dubbed Moses, which, being facetiously pronounced through the nose,
  became Boses, and being shortened became Boz.</p>

        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>The time had now arrived when he considered himself justified in
  endeavouring to increase his stipend as a reporter for the <i>Morning
  Chronicle</i> by offering to contribute to its pages a similar series of
  sketches, for which he should be remunerated, and the proposal was acceded
  to. Accordingly we find several papers signed "Boz" in the <i>Evening
  Chronicle</i>, an offshoot of the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>. Some of his
  sketches of "Scenes and Characters" (signed "Tibbs") appeared simultaneously
  in <i>Bell's Life in London</i>, and a couple also in "The Library of
  Fiction," edited by Charles Whitehead. Early in 1836 Dickens collected
  together a number of these bright little articles and stories, and sold the
  copyright for £100 to Macrone, who published them in two volumes under the
  title of "Sketches by Boz."</p>

  <p>Although remarkable for their humour and originality, the "Boz" sketches
  were presently to be eclipsed by a work which immediately took the world by
  storm, and upon which the reputation of Dickens securely rests. I allude to
  the ever fascinating "Pickwick Papers," and perhaps the most extraordinary
  circumstance in connection therewith is the fact that the author was then
  only three-and-twenty, his book rapidly achieving a degree of popularity
  which we cannot but regard as astounding even in these days of large
  editions.</p>

  <p>The "Pickwick Papers" originated in this way. The junior partner of what
  was then a young publishing house, Messrs. Chapman &amp; Hall (now a leading
  London firm), called upon the rising author at his rooms in Furnivals Inn
  with a proposition that he should furnish the letterpress for a "monthly
  something" that should be a vehicle for certain sporting-plates by a humorous
  draughtsman named Seymour. The first idea of a sort of Nimrod Club did not
  appeal to Dickens, for the excellent reason that he was no sportsman, and it
  was therefore eventually decided that, having agreed to supply the text, he
  should exercise a free hand, allowing the illustrations to arise naturally
  from the text. To give a complete history of the "Pickwick Papers" would
  occupy considerable space. Suffice it to say that the book was issued in
  shilling monthly parts (1836-37), then a favourite method of publishing
  novels, and consistently adopted by Dickens; that it was illustrated by means
  of etchings; that the sale of the first few numbers was so small that both
  publishers and author were in despair; and that the success of the work was
  assured as soon as Sam Weller made his first bow to the public&mdash;a
  character which, by reason of its freshness and originality, called forth
  such admiration that the sale of ensuing numbers increased until a
  circulation of forty thousand copies was attained!</p>

  <p>The creation of Sam Weller, therefore, was the turning-point in Dickens's
  fortune, and so great became the popularity of the book that the name of
  "Pickwick" was bestowed by enterprising tradesmen upon their newest goods,
  while portraits of Dickens himself were in the ascendant. People of every
  degree, young and old, revelled in the pages of the "Pickwick
  Papers"&mdash;judges on the bench as well as boys in the street; and we are
  reminded of Carlyle's anecdote of a solemn clergyman who, as he left the room
  of a sick person to whom he had been administering ghostly consolation, heard
  the invalid ejaculate, "Well, thank God, 'Pickwick' [the monthly number] will
  be out in ten days, anyway!"</p>

  <p>The identity of the author of "Pickwick," by-the-bye, was not disclosed
  until that work was nearly completed. It had given rise to much conjecture
  until the name of the young writer was at length revealed, when the following
  "Impromptu" appeared in <i>Bentley's Miscellany</i>:&mdash;</p><br>

  <blockquote>
    Who the <i>dickens</i> "Boz" could be<br>
    Puzzled many a learned elf,<br>
    Till time revealed the mystery,<br>
    And "Boz" appeared as Dickens' self.

  <p>As soon as the first number of the "Pickwick Papers" was launched (that
  is, in April, 1836), its author took unto himself a wife, the bride being
  Miss Catherine Thomson Hogarth, eldest daughter of Mr. George Hogarth, his
  fellow- worker on the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>. By her he had several
  children, and among those surviving are Mrs. Kate Perugini, a clever painter,
  and Mr. Henry Fielding Dickens, the eminent K.C. Mrs. Dickens survived her
  husband nine years and five months.</p>

  <p>Before the last of the twenty numbers of "Pickwick" was launched, the
  author became a public favourite. Certain sage prophets foretold that as
  "Boz" had risen like a rocket, he would of a surety fall like the stick. But,
  as events proved, they were wrong, for Dickens not only became the most
  popular novelist of the 'thirties and 'forties, but, by the sheer strength of
  his genius, maintained that supremacy. Story after story flowed from his pen,
  each characterised by originality of conception, each instinct with a love of
  humanity in its humblest form, each noteworthy for its humour and its pathos,
  and nearly every one "a novel with a purpose," having in view the exposure of
  some great social evil and its ultimate suppression.</p>

  <p>Following "Pickwick" came "Oliver Twist," attacking the Poor laws and
  "Bumbledom"; "Nicholas Nickleby," marking down the cheap boarding-schools of
  Yorkshire; "The Old Curiosity Shop" and "Barnaby Rudge"; "Martin Cluzzlewit";
  "Dombey &amp; Son"; "David Copperfield"; "Bleak House," holding up to
  ridicule and contempt the abuse of Chancery practice; "Little Dorrit"; "A
  Tale of Two Cities"; "Great Expectations"; "Our Mutual Friend"; and, finally,
  the unfinished fragment of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," to which Longfellow
  referred as "certainly one of his most beautiful works, if not the most
  beautiful of all."</p>

  <p>Of his many minor writings, special mention should be made of the
  attractive series of Christmas Books, the first of which, "A Christmas
  Carol," has become almost a text-book; and we know that, by the reading aloud
  of this touching little allegory to enthusiastic audiences. Sir Squire
  Bancroft has afforded substantial aid to many deserving charities. Dickens is
  appropriately termed "the Apostle of Christmas," and it is undoubtedly true
  that his Yuletide stories were the pioneers of Christmas literature.</p>

  <p>Having thus briefly reviewed the literary career of Charles Dickens, it
  becomes almost essential to consider him from a personal and social point of
  view, in order to thoroughly realise what manner of man he was. Referring to
  his personal characteristics, Forster says that to his friends (and their
  name was legion) Dickens was "the pleasantest of companions, with whom they
  forgot that he had ever written anything, and felt only the charm which a
  nature of such capacity for supreme enjoyment causes every one around it to
  enjoy. His talk was unaffected and natural, never bookish in the smallest
  degree. He was quite up to the average of well-read men: but as there was no
  ostentation of it in his writing, so neither was there in his conversation.
  This was so attractive because so keenly observant, and lighted up with so
  many touches of humorous fancy; but with every possible thing to give relish
  to it, there were not many things to bring away." He thoroughly endorsed the
  axiom that "what is worth doing at all is worth doing well." He was most
  methodical in his habits, and energetic to a degree. "In quick and varied
  sympathy, in ready adaptation to every whim and humour, in help to any mirth
  or game, he stood for a dozen men...His versatility made him unique."</p>

  <p>Concerning the novelist's personality, the following testimony has
  recently been placed on record by Mr. Percy Fitzgerald, a surviving member of
  the "Dickens Brigade" of young men who revered him as "the Master": "I say
  advisedly, there [never?] was, and never could be, so genial, amiable,
  unaffected, and untiring a person in his treatment of friends and guests. He
  was always eager to listen rather than to speak&mdash;to take a second or
  third place; more anxious to hear, rather than to tell, an amusing story. His
  very presence was enough, with the bright, radiant face, the glowing,
  searching eyes, which had a language of their own, and the expressive mouth.
  You could see the gleam of a humourous thought, first twinkling there, and
  had a certain foretaste and even understanding of what was coming: then it
  spread downwards&mdash;the mobile muscles of his cheek began to quiver: then
  it came lower, to the expressive mouth, working under shelter of the grizzled
  moustache; then, finally, thus prepared for, came the humorous utterance
  itself!"</p>

  <p>Dickens was intensely fond of the Drama, as evidenced not only by the
  frequent reference in his writings to theatres and actors, but by the fact
  that he himself was an actor of an exceptionally high order, and it is
  conceded that had he adopted the stage as a profession he would have attained
  first rank. Indeed, it was by the merest accident that he did not enter the
  profession, for when he was about twenty he applied for an engagement to the
  stage-manager at Covent Garden Theatre, and an appointment was made, which
  Dickens failed to keep on account of a terribly bad cold. After that he never
  resumed the idea. In later years he became the leading spirit of a wonderful
  company of amateur actors, who, on one occasion, performed before her late
  Majesty Queen Victoria, by special request. Sir John Tenniel is now the sole
  survivor of that merry confraternity.</p>

  <p>As a reader, too, Dickens stood pre-eminent. It has lately transpired that
  his very first public reading took place, early in the 'fifties, at Chatham,
  in aid of the Rochester and Chatham Mechanics' Institution, and the subject
  of the reading was the "Christmas Carol." He gave public readings from his
  own works both in Great Britain and America, and an entertaining account of
  these tours may be found in Mr. George Dolby's volume, "Charles Dickens as I
  Knew Him." There can be no doubt that the mental tension caused by these
  readings (which covered a period of some fifteen years), supplemented by the
  strain of literary and editorial labours, curtailed the brilliant career of
  England's greatest novelist. It was at his charming rural retreat, Gad's Hill
  Place, near Rochester (his home from 1856), that Charles Dickens breathed his
  last, on June 9th, 1870, in his fifty-ninth year. "Before the news of his
  death even reached the remoter parts of England," says Forster, "it had been
  flashed across Europe; was known in the distant continents of India,
  Australia, and America; and not in English-speaking communities only, but in
  every country of the civilised earth, had awakened grief and sympathy. In his
  own land it was as if a personal bereavement had befallen everyone." Although
  he himself would have preferred to lie in the small graveyard under the
  ancient wall of Rochester Castle, or in the pretty Kentish churchyard of
  Cobham or Shorne, public sentiment favoured the suggestion that the mortal
  remains of Charles Dickens should be interred in Westminster Abbey; and
  there, in Poets' Corner, they were laid to rest, quietly and
  unostentatiously. What Carlyle said of him, a few days later, will meet with
  universal acceptance:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn1"
     name="bn1"></a><b>Rochester High Street, showing the "moon-faced"
     clock</b></p>

  <p class="note">Referring to these early memories, Dickens described "how he
  thought the Rochester High Street must be at least as wide as Regent Street,
  which be afterwards discovered to be little better than a lane; how the
  public clock in it, supposed to be the finest clock in the world, turned out
  to be as moon- faced and weak a clock as a man's eyes ever saw; and how, in
  its town hall, which had appeared to him once so glorious a structure that he
  had set it up in his mind as the model on which the genie of the lamp built
  the palace for Aladdin, he had painfully to recognise a mere mean little heap
  of bricks, like a chapel gone demented." In "The Seven Poor Travellers"
  Dickens gave another picture of the same spot. "The silent High Street of
  Rochester is full of gables, with old beams and timbers carved into strange
  faces. It is oddly garnished with a queer old clock that projects over the
  pavement out of a grave red brick building as if time carried on business
  there and hung out his sign."</p>

     Road, Landport, Portsea</b></p>

  <p class="note">Charles Dickens was born at No. 387, Commercial Road.
  Landport, Portsea, on Friday, February 7th, 1812. He was the second son of
  John Dickens, a clerk in the Navy Pay Office, who married Miss Elizabeth
  Barrow, and had a family of eight children, two of whom died in childhood. Of
  his very earliest days Charles Dickens retained many distinct and durable
  impressions. He even recollected the small front garden of the house at
  Portsea, from which he was taken away at the age of two years, and where he
  played with his elder sister whilst watched by a nurse through the kitchen
  window on a level with the gravel walk.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn3"
     name="bn3"></a><b>No. 15, Furnival's Inn, Holborn/ "The Leather Bottle,"
     Cobham</b></p>

  <p class="note">In 1836 Charles Dickens lived at 15, Furnival's Inn, and it
  was here that he "thought of Mr. Pickwick, and wrote the first number," which
  was published March 31st, 1837. Two days later the author married Miss
  Catherine Hogarth, and after spending their honeymoon in the village of
  Chalk, near Gad's Hill, the young couple continued to reside for some time in
  apartments on the top floor of this house.</p>

  <p class="note">"The Leather Bottle," immortalised in "The Pickwick Papers,"
  is situated at Cobham, opposite the church. "And really," added Mr. Pickwick,
  after half an hour's walking had brought them to the village, "really, for a
  misanthrope's choice, this is one of the prettiest and most desirable places
  of residence I ever met with."</p>

  <p class="note">"In this opinion also both Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass
  expressed their concurrence; and, having been directed to the 'Leather
  Bottle,' a clean and commodious village ale-house, the three travellers
  entered, and at once inquired for a gentleman of the name of Tupman."</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn4"
     name="bn4"></a><b>The Grave of Little Nell</b></p>

  <p class="note">"They saw the vault covered and the stone fixed down. Then,
  when the dusk of evening had come on, and not a sound disturbed the sacred
  stillness of the place, when the bright moon poured in her light on tomb and
  monument, on pillar, wall, and arch, and most of all (it seemed to them) upon
  her quiet grave in that calm time, when all outward things and inward
  thoughts teem with assurances of immortality, and worldly hopes and fears are
  humbled in the dust before them&mdash;then, with tranquil and submissive
  hearts, they turned away, and left the child with God."</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn5"
     name="bn5"></a><b>The Old Curiosity Shop</b></p>

  <p class="note">The Old Curiosity Shop in Portugal Street, said to be the
  house assigned by the novelist for the residence of little Nell and her
  grandfather, was "one of those receptacles for old and curious things, which
  seem to crouch in odd corners of this town, and to hide their musty treasure
  from the public eye in jealousy and distrust." It is possibly the best known
  among the landmarks of places made famous by Dickens.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn6"
     name="bn6"></a><b>Dotheboys Hall at Bowes, Yorkshire</b></p>

  <p class="note">Dotheboys Hall, in "Nicholas Nickleby," is said to have borne
  a close resemblance to Shaw's Academy at Howes, Yorkshire, but Dickens in his
  preface to the book, disclaimed his intention of identifying the infamous Mr.
  Squeers with the master of any particular school by his words, "Mr Squeers is
  the representative of a class and not of an individual." "'The fact is it
  ain't a Hall,' observed Squeers, drily...'We call it a hall up in London
  because it sounds better, but they don't know it by that name in these parts.
  A man may call his house an island if he likes: there's no Act of Parliament
  against that, I believe'...The school was a long cold-looking house, one
  storey high, with a few straggling outbuildings behind and a barn and stable
  adjoining."</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn7"
     name="bn7"></a><b>Dickens's Favourite Raven</b></p>

  <p class="note">This raven was the original of "Grip" in "Barnaby Rudge." To
  the great grief of Dickens the bird died, after it had been ailing only a few
  days, on March 12th, 1841. After death the famous raven was stuffed, and when
  sold at the Dickens sale realised £126.</p>

  <p class="note">"'I make <i>him</i> come?' cried Barnaby, pointing to the
  bird. 'Him, who never goes to sleep, or so much as winks! Why, any time of
  night, you may see his eyes in my dark room, shining like two sparks. And
  every night, and all night too, he's broad awake, talking to himself,
  thinking what he shall do tomorrow, where we shall go, and what he shall
  steal, and hide and bury. <i>I</i> make <i>him</i> come! Ha, Ha, Ha!'"</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn8"
     name="bn8"></a><b>Tavistock House, Tavistock Square</b></p>

  <p class="note">After leaving Devonshire Terrace, Dickens resided for nearly
  nine years, dating from November 1851, at Tavistock House, which has of late
  been demolished. During this period he wrote "Bleak House," "Hard Times," a
  part of "Little Dorrit," and "A Tale of Two Cities."</p>

  <p class="note">Hans Christian Andersen, after visiting Dickens in Tavistock
  House, gave the following description of his home:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="note">"In Tavistock Square stands Tavistock House. This and the
  strip of garden in front of it are shut out from the thoroughfare by an iron
  railing. A large garden, with a grass plat and high trees, stretches behind
  the house, and gives it a countrified look in the midst of this coal and gas
  steaming London. In the passage from street to garden hung pictures and
  engravings. On the first floor was a rich library, with a fireplace and a
  writing-table, looking out on the garden; and here it was that in winter
  Dickens and his friends acted plays to the satisfaction of all parties."</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn9"
     name="bn9"></a><b>Eastgate House, Rochester</b></p>

  <p class="note">Eastgate House, the original of the Nuns' House in "The
  Mystery of Edwin Drood," forms one of the most picturesque bits of the
  Rochester High Street, one side of the old building being half hidden from
  the roadway by overhanging trees. "Cloisterham," in "Edwin Drood," of course
  represents Rochester.</p>

  <p class="note">"In the midst of Cloisterham stands the Nuns' House; a
  veritable brick edifice, whose present appellation is doubtless derived from
  the legends of its conventual uses. On the trim gate enclosing its courtyard
  is a resplendent brass plate flashing forth the legend: 'Seminary for Young
  Ladies. Miss Twinkleton.' The house front is so old and worn, and the brass
  plate is so shining and staring, that the general result has reminded
  imaginative strangers of a battered old beau with a large modern eyeglass
  stuck in his blind eye."</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn10"
     name="bn10"></a><b>No. 1, Devonshire Terrace</b></p>

  <p class="note">In 1839 Dickens removed from Doughty Street to No. 1,
  Devonshire Terrace, a handsome house with a garden of considerable size, shut
  out from the New Road by a high brick wall facing the York Gate into Regent's
  Park. The house is entered at the side, and the front looks into Marylebone
  Road. The windows of the lower and first-floor rooms are largely bowed, and
  Dickens described it as "a house of great promise (and great premium),
  undeniable situation, and excessive splendour." He lived here until 1850, and
  in these years, much of his best work was done, including "Master Humphrey's
  Clock," "The Old Curiosity Shop," "Barnaby Rudge," American Notes," "Martin
  Chuzzlewit," "A Christmas Carol," "The Cricket on the Hearth," Dembey and
  Son," "The Haunted Man," and "David Copperfield."</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn11"
     name="bn11"></a><b>Gad's Hill Place, near Rochester</b></p>

  <p class="note">Gad's Hill Place was the novelist's last residence, where he
  wrote "The Uncommercial Traveller," "Great Expectations," "Our Mutual
  Friend," and "The Mystery of Edwin Drood."</p>

  <p class="note">On this house Dickens had fixed his choice in his boyish
  days. It had always held a prominent place amid the recollections connected
  with his childhood. Forster wrote of Dickens that "upon first seeing it as he
  came from Chatham with his father, and looking up at it with admiration, he
  had been promised that he might live in it himself, or some such house, when
  he came to be a man, if he would only work hard enough." It is pleasant to
  record that this ambition was gratified in after life, when the dream of his
  boyhood was realised.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn12"
     name="bn12"></a><b>Restoration House, Rochester</b></p>

  <p class="note">Restoration House, Rochester, is of interest as being the
  "Satis House" of "Great Expectations," in which Miss Havisham lived.
  Restoration House must not, however, be confused with Satis House, Rochester,
  from which Dickens took the name.</p>

  <p class="note">"'Enough House!' said I. 'That's a curious name, miss.'</p>

  <p class="note">"'Yes,' she replied;' but it meant more than it said. It
  meant, when it was given, that whoever had this house could want nothing
  else. They must have been easily satisfied in those days, I should
  think.'</p>

  <p class="note">"To be sure, it was a deserted place, down to the pigeon-
  house in the brewery-yard, which had been blown crooked on its pole by some
  high wind, and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea, if there
  had been any pigeons there to be rocked by it. But there were no pigeons in
  the dovecot, no horses in the stables, no pigs in the sty..."</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn13"
     name="bn13"></a><b>The Bull Hotel, Rochester</b></p>

  <p class="note">The Bull Hotel is a commodious establishment of ancient and
  respectable repute, and the principal posting-house of Rochester. It is the
  celebrated inn where the Pickwickians stayed on the occasion of their first
  visit to Rochester, and which Mr. Jingle so laconically summed up in the
  phrase, "good house&mdash;nice beds."</p>

  <p class="note">The house itself has changed very little. A fine oak
  staircase leads up to the ball-room, where Mr. Jingle masqueraded in Mr.
  Winkle's dress-suit with extraordinary results.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn14"
     name="bn14"></a><b>The Gatehouse, Rochester</b></p>

  <p class="note">In "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" Dickens described the Old
  Gatehouse at Rochester, facing Pump Lane, with its archway, which stands
  angle-wise in the street. There is a small postern at the back of the gate.
  This building was the residence of Mr. Tope, "chief verger and showman" of
  the Cathedral, with whom lodged Mr. John Jaspar, the uncle of Edwin Drood.
  The house is a gabled wooden structure, two storeys high, built over the
  stone gateway. Dickens pictured it as "an old stone gatehouse crossing the
  Close, with an arched thoroughfare passing beneath it."</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn15"
     name="bn15"></a><b>Watts's Charity, The House of the Six Poor Travellers,
     Rochester</b></p>

  <p class="note">This house formed the basis for a short story called, "The
  Seven Poor Travellers," which appeared in the Christmas number of
  <i>Household Words</i> for 1854. The inscription over the doorway of this
  striking-looking building runs as follows:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center; font-size:100%; font-variant:small-caps">Richard

  And Four-Pence Each.</p><br>

  <p class="note">Dickens called it "a clean white house of a staid and
  venerable air, with a quaint old door (an arched door), choice, little, long,
  low lattice windows, and a roof of three gables."</p>

  such ceremonial as would strictly obey all injunctions of privacy. The
  solemnity lost nothing by its simplicity. "All day long," wrote Dean Stanley,
  two days after the funeral, "there was a constant pressure to the spot, and
  many flowers were strewn upon it by unknown hands, many tears shed by unknown

     in the possession of Mr. Horace N. Pym</b></p>

  <p class="note">In 1837 Dickens sat for his portrait to his friend Samuel
  Laurence, an artist distinguished for remarkable skill in the art of
  portrait-sketching. Shortly after the death of Mr. Laurence in 1884, his
  drawings were disposed of by auction at the sale of his effects on June 12th,
  and the "Boz" portrait which is here reproduced then became the property of
  Mr. Horace N. Pym, the editor of "Caroline Fox's Journal." Of this portrait
  Mr. F. G. Kitton writes in "Charles Dickens by Pen and Pencil": "the artist
  has admirably succeeded in rendering with marvellous skill the fire and
  beauty of the eyes&mdash;the sensitiveness and mobility of the mouth."</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="pn2"

     Maclise, R.A.</b></p>

  <p class="note">This painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1840, and
  is now in the National Portrait Gallery. Thackeray referred to it in terms of
  the highest praise. "Look at the portrait of Mr. Dickens," he wrote, "well
  arranged as a picture, good in colour and light and shadow, and as a likeness
  perfectly amazing; a looking-glass could not render a better
  <i>fac-simile</i>. Here we have the real identical man Dickens; the artist
  must have understood the inward 'Boz' as well as the outward before he made
  this admirable representation of him. What cheerful intellectuality is about
  the man's eyes, and a large forehead! The mouth is too large and full, too
  eager and active, perhaps; the smile is very sweet and generous."</p>

  the original sketch by Daniel Maclise, R. A., which is now in the South
  Kensington Museum. Forster called it "An occasion rather memorable in which
  was the germ of those readings to larger audiences, by which, as much as by
  his books, the world knew him in his later life." With reference to Maclise's
  pencil-drawing he continued. "It will tell the reader all he can wish to
  know. He will see of whom the party consisted; and may be assured (with
  allowance for a touch of caricature to which I may claim to be considered
  myself as the chief and very marked victim) that in the grave attention of
  Carlyle, the eager interest of Stanfield and Maclise, the keen look of poor
  Laman Blanchard, Fox's rapt solemnity, Jerrold's skyward gaze, and the tears
  of Harness and Dyce, the characteristic points of the scene are sufficiently
  rendered."</p>

  <p class="note">The original of this pencil drawing by Daniel Maclise, R.A.
  which was executed in 1843, a few years after the marriage of Dickens, is now
  in the South Kensington Museum. It was engraved by C. H. Jeens and dated by
  error 1842. "Never did a touch so light carry with it more truth of
  observation," wrote Forster. "The likenesses of all are excellent...Nothing
  ever done of Dickens himself has conveyed more vividly his look and bearing
  at this yet youthful time. He is in his most pleasing aspect; flattered if
  you will; but nothing that is known to me gives a general impression so

  <p class="note">Dickens had the title to be called a born comedian, declared
  Forster, but his strength was rather in the vividness and variety of his
  assumptions, than in the completeness, finish, or ideality he could give to
  any part of them. The rendering of the novelist as Bobadil by C. R. Leslie.
  R.A., was exhibited in the Royal Academy in 1846. The artist has represented
  Dickens seated upon a sofa, dressed as a bearded swashbuckler and
  braggadocio, just at the moment when Tib enters to announce the arrival of a
  visitor and Captain Bobadil declares: "A gentleman! Odds so, I am not
  within."</p>

  spirited head painted at his [Scheffer's] very best, and with a very easy and
  natural appearance in it. But it does not look to me at all like, nor does it
  strike me that if I saw it in a gallery, I should suppose myself to be the

  <p class="note">Dickens gave his paid public Readings successively, with
  brief intervals, at four several periods&mdash;viz., in 1858-9, in 1861-3, in
  1866-7, and in 1868-70.</p>

  <p class="note">"I must say [he wrote] that the intelligence and warmth of
  the audience are an immense sustainment, and one that always sets me up.
  Sometimes, before I go down to read (especially when it is in the day) I am
  so oppressed by having to do it that I feel perfectly unequal to the task.
  But the people lift me out of this directly, and I find that I have quite
  forgotten everything but them and the book, in a quarter of all hour."</p>

     Watkins</b></p>

  <p class="note">A full-face likeness of the novelist by Watkins has attained
  deservedly a large degree of popularity. The best remembered copy is a
  beautiful lithographic drawing by R. J. Lane which was exhibited at the Royal
  Academy in 1864. It is said to have been an especial favourite with
  Lever.</p>
