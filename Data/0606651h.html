<h1>In a Fog</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Anonymous</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>A FEW minutes before one o'clock on the morning of Sunday, the 8th
of February, 1857, Policeman Smithers, of the Third District, was
meditatively pursuing his path of duty through the quietest streets of
Ward Five, beguiling, as usual, the weariness of his watch by
reminiscent Aethiopianisms, mellifluous in design, though not severely
artistic in execution. Passing from the turbulent precincts of Portland
and Causeway Streets, he had entered upon the solitudes of Green
Street, along which he now dragged himself dreamily enough, ever
extracting consolations from lugubrious cadences mournfully intoned.
Very silent was the neighborhood. Very dismal the night. Very dreary
and damp was Mr. Smithers; for a vile fog wrapped itself around him,
filling his body with moist misery, and his mind with anticipated
rheumatic horrors. Still he surged heavily along, tired Nature with
tuneful charms sweetly restoring.</p>

<p>As he wound off a tender tribute to the virtues of the Ancient Tray,
and was about sounding the opening notes of a requiem over the memory
of the lost African Lily, surnamed Dale, one o'clock was announced by
the bell of the Lynde-Street Church. Mr. Smithers's heart warmed a
little at the thought of speedy respite from his midnight toil, and
with hastening step he approached Chambers Street, and came within
range of his relief post. He paused a moment upon the corner, and gazed
around. It is the peculiar instinct of a policeman to become suspicious
at every corner.</p>

<p>Nothing stirring. Silence everywhere. He listens acutely. No sound.
He strains his eyes to penetrate the misty atmosphere. He is satisfied
that order reigns. He prepares to resume his march, and the measure of
his melancholy chant.</p>

<p>Three seconds more, and Policeman Smithers is another being. Now his
hand convulsively grasps his staff; his foot falls lightly on the
pavement; his carol is changed to a quick, sharp inhalation of the
breath; for directly before him, just visible through the fog, a
figure, lightly clad, leans from a window close upon the street, then
clambers noiselessly upon the sill, leaps over, and dashes swiftly down
Chambers Street, disappearing in the darkness.</p>

<p>Gathering himself well together, in an instant, Mr. Smithers is off
and away in pursuit. His heavy rubber-boots spatter over the bricks
with an echo that startles the sober residents from their slumbers.
Strong of limb, and not wholly unaccustomed to such exercise, he
rapidly gains upon the fugitive, who, finding himself so hotly
followed, utters a faint cry, as if unable to control his terror, and
suddenly darts into one of the numerous narrow passages which connect
Chambers and Leverett Streets.</p>

<p>Not prepared for this sharp dodge, Mr. Smithers is for a moment
unable to check his headlong plunges, and shoots past the opening a
yard or two before the wet sidewalk affords him a foothold.</p>

<p>In great wrath, he turns about, and gropes his way cautiously
through the lane in the narrow labyrinth of which the fugitive has
disappeared,--always cautiously, for there are precipitous descents in
Hammond Avenue, and deep arched door-ways, from which a sudden
onslaught might be dangerous. But he meets no interruption here.
Emerging into Leverett Street, he with difficulty descries a white
garment distantly fluttering in the feeble light of a street-lamp. Any
other color would have eluded him, but the way is clear now, and it is
a mere question of strength and speed. He sets his teeth together,
takes a full breath, and gives chase again.</p>

<p>Mr. Smithers has now passed the limits of his own beat, and he fears
his adventure may be shared by some of his associates. For the world he
would not have this happen. Nothing could tempt him at this moment to
swing his rattle. His blood is roused, and he will make this capture
himself, alone and without aid.</p>

<p>He rapidly reconsiders the chances.</p>

<p>"This fellow does not know the turns," he thinks, "or he would have
taken Cushman Avenue, and then I should have lost him."</p>

<p>This is in his favor. On the other hand, Mr. Smithers's action is
impeded by his heavy overcoat and rubber boots, and he knows that the
pursued is un-incumbered in all his movements.</p>

<p>It is a fierce, desperate struggle, that mad race down Leverett
Street, at one o'clock on Sunday morning.</p>

<p>At each corner, the street lamps throw a dull red haze around,
revealing the fugitive's slender form as he rushes wildly through.
Another moment, and the friendly fog shelters and conceals him from
view.</p>

<p>Breathless, panting, sobbing, he ere long is forced to relax his
speed. The policemen, who has held his best energies in reserve, now
puts forth his utmost strength.</p>

<p>Presently he gains upon the runaway so that he can detect the white
feet pattering along the red bricks, rising and falling quite
noiselessly. He ejects imprecations about his own stout boots, which
not only fail to fasten themselves firmly to the slippery pavements,
but continually betray by their noisy splashing his exact position.</p>

<p>As they pass the next lamp, Mr. Smithers sees plainly enough that
the end is near. The fugitive touches the ground with only the balls of
his feet, as if each step were torture, and expels his breath with
unceasing violence. He does not gasp or pant,--he groans.</p>

<p>Just at the bend in Leverett Street, leading to the bridge, there is
a dark and half-hidden aperture among the ill-assorted houses. Into
this, as a forlorn hope, the fugitive endeavors to fling himself. But
the game is up. Here, at last, he is overhauled by Mr. Smithers, who,
dropping a heavy hand upon his shoulder, whirls him violently to the
ground. Having accomplished this exploit with rare dexterity, he
forthwith proceeds to set the captive on his feet again, and to shake
him about with sprightly vigor, according to established usage.</p>

<p>Mr. Smithers next makes a rapid but close examination of his prize,
who, bewildered by the fall, stares vacantly around, and speaks no
word. He was a young man, apparently about twenty years old, with
nothing peculiar in appearance except an unseasonable deficiency in
clothing. Coat, waistcoat, trousers, boots, hat, had he none; shirt,
drawers, and stockings made up his scant raiment. Mr. Smithers set
aside the suspicion of burglary, which he had originally entertained,
in favor of domestic disorder. The symptoms did not, to his mind, point
towards delirium tremens.</p>

<p>Suddenly recovering consciousness, the youth was seized with a fit
of trembling so violent that he with difficulty stood upright, and
cried out in piteous tones,--</p>

<p>"For God's sake, let me go! let me go!"</p>

<p>Mr. Smithers answered by gruffly ordering the prisoner to move along
with him.</p>

<p>By some species of inspiration--for, as the era of police uniforms
had not then dawned, it could have been nothing else--the young man
conceived the correct idea of the function of his custodian, and, after
verifying his belief, expressed himself enraptured.</p>

<p>All his perturbation seemed to vanish at the moment.</p>

<p>The affair was getting too deep for Mr. Smithers, who could not
fathom the idea of a midnight malefactor becoming jubilant over his
arrest. So he gave no ear to the torrent of excited explanations that
burst upon him, but silently took the direct route to the station.</p>

<p>Here he resigned his charge to Captain Morrill's care, and, after
narrating the circumstances, went forth again, attended by two choice
spirits, to continue investigations. On reaching Chambers Street, he
became confused and dubious. A row of houses, all precisely alike
excepting in color, stood not far from the corner of Green Street. From
a lower window of one of these he believed that the apparition had
sprung; but, in his agitation, he had neglected to mark with sufficient
care the precise spot. Now, no open window nor any other trace of the
event could be discovered.</p>

<p>The three policemen, having arrived at the end of their wits, went
back to the station for an extension.</p>

<p>There they found Captain Morrill listening to a strange and
startling story, the incidents of which can here be more coherently
recapitulated than they were on that occasion by the half-distracted
sufferer.</p>

<p>On the morning of Saturday, February the 7th, this young man, whose
name was Richard Lorrimer, and who was a clerk in a New-York mercantile
house, started from that city in the early train for Boston, whither he
had been despatched to arrange some business matters that needed the
presence of a representative of the firm. It chanced to be his first
journey of any extent; but the day was cheerless and gloomy, and the
novelty of travel, which would otherwise have been attractive, was not
especially agreeable. After exhausting the enlivening resources of a
package of morning papers, which at that time overflowed with records
of every variety of crime, from the daily murder to the hourly garrote,
he dozed. At Springfield he dined. Here, also, he fortified himself
against returning ennui with a supply of the day's journals from
Boston. Singularly enough, five minutes after resuming his place, he
was once more peacefully slumbering. The pause at Worcester scarcely
roused him; but near Framingham a sharp shriek from the locomotive, and
the rapid working of the brakes, banished his dreams, and put an end to
his drowsy humor for the remainder of the journey. It was soon made
known that the engine was suffering from internal disarrangement, and
that a delay of an hour or more might be expected. The red flag was
despatched to the rear, the lamps were lighted, and the passengers
composed themselves, each as patiently and as comfortably as he
could.</p>

<p>Lorrimer felt no inclination for further repose. He was much
disturbed at the prospect of long detention, having received directions
to execute a part of his commission that evening. Comforting himself
with the profound reflection that the fault was not his, he turned
wearily to his newspaper-files.</p>

<p>A middle-aged man with a keen nose and a snapping eye asked
permission to share the benefit of his treasures of journalism. As the
middle-aged man glanced over the New York dailies, he ventured an
anathema upon the abominations of Gotham.</p>

<p>The patriotic pride of a genuine New-Yorker never deserts him.
Lorrimer discovered that the maligner of his city was a Bostonian, and
a stormy debate ensued.</p>

<p>As between cat and dog, so is the hostility which divides the
residents of these two towns. So the conversation became at once
spirited, and eventually spiteful.</p>

<p>Boston pointed with sarcastic finger to the close columns heavily
laden with iniquitous recitals, the result of a reporter's experience
of one day in the metropolis.</p>

<p>New York, with icy imperturbability, rehearsed from memory the
recent revelations of matrimonial and clerical delinquencies which had
given the City of Notions an unpleasant notoriety.</p>

<p>Boston burst out in eloquent denunciation of the Bowery assassin's
knife.</p>

<p>New York was placidly pleased to revert to a tale of bloodshed in
the abiding-place of Massachusetts authority, the State Prison.</p>

<p>Boston fell back upon the garrote,--"the meanest and most diabolical
invention of Five-Point villany,--a thing unknown, Sir, and never to be
known with us, while our police system lasts!"</p>

<p>New York quietly folded together a paper so as to reveal one
particular paragraph, which appeared in smallest type, as seeking to
avoid recognition. Boston read as follows:--</p>

<p>"The garroting system of highway robbery, which has been so
fashionable for some time past in New York, and which has so much
alarmed the people of that city, has been introduced in Boston, and was
practised on Thomas W. Steamburg, barber, on Thursday night. While
crossing the Common to his home, he was attacked by three men; one
seized him by the throat and half strangled him, another sealed his
mouth with a gloved hand, and the third abstracted his wallet, which
contained about seventy-five dollars in money."</p>

<p>This was from the "Courier" of that morning. New York had triumphed,
and Boston, with eyes snapping virulently, sought another portion of
the car, perhaps to hunt up his temper, which had been for some time on
the point of departure, and had now left him altogether.</p>

<p>Lorrimer took to himself great satisfaction, in a mild way, and
laughed inwardly at his opponent's discomfiture.</p>

<p>Presently, the vitalities of the locomotive having been restored,
the train rolled on, and Lorrimer took to calculating the chances of
fulfilling his appointment that evening. He at length abandoned the
hope, and resigned himself to the afflicting prospect of a solitary
Sunday in a strange place.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock, P. M., the Boston station was achieved. Then
followed, for Mr. Lorrimer, the hotel, the supper, the vain search for
Saturday-evening amusements, and a discontented stroll in a wilderness
of unfamiliar streets, with spirits dampened by the dismal foggy
weather.</p>

<p>He found the Common, and secretly admired, but longed for an
opportunity to vilify it to some ardent native. His point of attack
would be, that it furnished dangerous opportunities for crime, as
illustrated in the case he had recently been discussing. He looked
around for some one to accost, and felt aggrieved at finding no
available victim. Finally, in great depth of spirits, and anxious for a
temporary shelter from the all-penetrating moisture, he wandered into a
saloon of inviting appearance, and sought the national
consolation,--Oysters.</p>

<p>While he was accumulating his appetite, a stranger entered the same
stall, and dropped, with a smile and a nod, upon the opposite seat. "I
wouldn't intrude, Sir," he said, "but every other place is filled. It's
wonderful how Boston gives itself up to oysters on Saturday
nights,--all other sorts of rational enjoyment being legally
prohibited."</p>

<p>Lorrimer welcomed the stranger, and, delighted at the opportunity of
a bit of discussion, and still cherishing the malignant desire to
injure somebody's feelings in the matter of the Common, opened a
conversation by asking if Boston were really much given to bivalvular
excesses.</p>

<p>The stranger, who was a strongly built and rough-visaged man, with
nothing specially attractive about him, except a humorous and
fascinating eye-twinkle, straightened himself, and delivered a short
oration.</p>

<p>"Bless me, Sir!" said he, "are you a foreigner? Why, oysters are the
universal bond of brotherhood, not only in Boston, but throughout this
land. They harmonize with our sharp, wide-awake spirit. They are an
element in our politics. Our statesmen, legislators, and high-placed
men, generally, are weaned on them. Why, dear me! oysters are a
fundamental idea in our social system. The best society circles around
'fried' and 'stewed.' Our 'festive scenes,' you know, depend on them in
no small degree for their zest. That isn't all, either. A full third of
our population is over 'oysters' every morning at eleven o'clock. Young
Smith, on his way down town after breakfast, drops into the first
saloon and absorbs some oysters. At precisely eleven o'clock he is
overcome with hunger and takes a few on the 'half-shell.' In the course
of an hour appetite clamors, and he 'oysters' again. So on till
dinner-time, and, after dinner, oysters at short intervals until
bed-time."</p>

<p>And the stalwart stranger leaned back and laughed lustily for a few
seconds, until, abruptly checking his mirth, he, in solemn tones,
directed the waiter to introduce ale.</p>

<p>Then occurred an interesting exchange of courtesies. Social
enlightenment was vividly illustrated. The sparkling ale was set upon
the table. In silent contemplation, the two gentlemen awaited the
subsidence of the head. Then, smiling intensely, they cordially grasped
the flowing mugs; they made the edges click; they paused.</p>

<p>"Sir," said one, with genial blandness.</p>

<p>"Sir," responded the other, in like manner.</p>

<p>Contemporaneously they partook of the cheering fluid. Gradually each
gentleman's nose was eclipsed by the aspiring orb of pottery. The mugs
assumed a lofty elevation, then fell, to rise no more. The two
gentlemen beamed with amity. Each respected the other, and the
acquaintance was formed.</p>

<p>Lorrimer was charmed to meet an intelligent being who would talk and
be talked to. He flattered himself he had exploited a "character," and
was determined not to allow him to slip away. He cautiously broke to
his new companion the fact that he was a native of New York, and was a
little surprised to see the announcement followed by no manifestation
of awe, but only a lively wink. He reserved his defamatory intentions
respecting the Common, and endeavored to draw the stranger out, who, in
return, shot forth eccentricities as profusely as the emery wheel of
the street grinder emits sparks when assailed by a scissors-blade.</p>

<p>Lorrimer learned that this delightful fellow's name was Glover, and
rejoiced greatly in so much knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. Glover ordered in ale, and Mr. Lorrimer ordered in oysters,--and
from oysters to ale they pleasantly alternated for the space of two
hours.</p>

<p>Cloud-compelling cigars varied at intervals the monotony of the
proceedings.</p>

<p>At length the young gentleman from New York vanquished his last
"fried in crumb," and victory perched upon his knife. Just then the
gas-burners began to meander queerly before his eyes. Around and above
him he beheld showers of glittering sparks,--snaky threads of
light,--fantastic figures of fire,--jets of liquid lustre. He
communicated, in confidence, to Mr. Glover, that his seat seemed to him
of the nature of a rocking-chair operating viciously upon a steep
slated roof. Mr. Glover laughed, and proposed an adjournment.</p>

<p>As they settled their little bills, Lorrimer thoughtlessly displayed
a plethoric pile of bank-notes. He saw, or fancied he saw, his
companion gaze at them in a manner which made him restless; but the
circumstances soon passed from his mind, until later events enforced
the recollection.</p>

<p>When they walked into the open air, Mr. Lorrimer first became
intimate with a lamp-post, which he was loath to leave, and then
bitterly bewailed his ignorance of localities. Glover good-naturedly
suggested that his young friend would do well to take up quarters with
him, that night, and promised to conduct him wherever he desired to go,
the next morning. His young friend was not in the humor for hesitation,
and, distrusting his own perambulatory powers, gave himself up, without
reserve, to Glover's guidance. Linked together by their arms, they
sailed along, like an energetic little steam-tug, puffing, plunging,
sputtering, under the shadow of a serene and stately India-man.</p>

<p>The fog had now gathered solidity, and hung chillingly over the
city's heart. How desolate were the thoroughfares! The street-lamps
gleamed luridly from their stands, serving only to make the dreary
darkness visible. Lorrimer's late merry fancies were all extinguished
as suddenly as they had blazed forth. Even his sturdy guide showed a
depression and constraint that strangely contrasted with his former
gayety. He vainly drew upon his mirth-account; there was no issue.
"Beastly fog!" said he, "we might drill holes in it, and blast it with
gunpowder!" They approached the Common, and the hideous structure
opposite West Street glared on them like a fiery monster, and seemed
exactly the reverse of the gate to a forty-acre Paradise. Sheltering
their faces from the wind, which now added its inconveniences to the
saturating atmosphere, they struck the broad avenue, and pushed across
towards the West End.</p>

<p>The wind sang most doleful strains, and the bending branches of the
trees sighed sadly over them. Lorrimer was filled with an anxious
tribulation, as he remembered the story of the villany that, two nights
before, near the spot where they now walked, and perhaps at the same
hour, had been perpetrated. An impulse, which he could not restrain,
caused him to whisper his fears to his companion. Glover laughed, a
little uneasily, he thought, but made no answer.</p>

<p>Soon they reached the opposite boundary of the Common, and continued
through Hancock Street, ascending and descending the hill. While
passing the reservoir in that dull gray darkness, Lorrimer felt as if
under the shadow of some giant tomb. Hastening forward, for it was
growing late, they threaded a number of the short avenues of Ward
Three, and at length, when young New York's endurance was nearly
exhausted, reached their destination in Chambers Street. It must have
been the fatigue which, as they crossed the threshold, propelled Mr.
Lorrimer against the door, causing him to stain himself unbecomingly
with new paint.</p>

<p>They mounted the stairs, and entered a comfortable apartment, in
which a fresh fire was diffusing a most welcome glow, and a spacious
bed luxuriously invited occupancy. Lorrimer had but one grief, which he
freely communicated to his host,--his fingers were liberally decorated
with dark daubs, to which he pointed with unsteady anguish.</p>

<p>"It's a filthy shame!" said he, with more energy of manner than
certainty of utterance.</p>

<p>A section of the chamber was separated from the rest by a screen.
Into this retreat Glover disappeared, and immediately returned with a
bottle, from which he poured an acid that effaced the spots. "It will
wash away anything," said he, laughing.</p>

<p>Lorrimer was superabundantly profuse in thanks, and announced that
his mind was now at ease. By some mysterious process, not clearly
explicable to himself, he contrived to lay aside a portion of his
dress, and to dispose himself within the folds of balmy bedclothes that
awaited him. In forty seconds he was dreaming.</p>

<p>Nearly an hour had elapsed when he half woke from an uneasy slumber,
and strove to collect his drowsy faculties. His sleep had been
disturbed by frightful visions. He had passed through a scene of
violence on the Common; he had been engaged in a life-and-death
struggle with his new acquaintance; he had been seized by unseen hands,
and thrown into a vast vault. His brain throbbed and his heart ached,
as he endeavored to disentangle the bewildering fancies of his sleep
from wakeful reality.</p>

<p>He lay with his face to the wall, and the grotesque decorations of
the paper assumed ghostly forms, and moved menacingly before his eyes,
thrilling him through and through.</p>

<p>In a few moments the murmur of voices close at hand aroused him more
effectually. He then recollected the incidents of the night, and
reproached himself for his wild excesses, and his reckless and
imprudent confidence in a stranger. He dreaded to think what the
consequences might be, and again became confused with the memories of
his distressing dreams.</p>

<p>Three facts, however, were fastened upon his mind. He could not
forget Glover's singular glance at his roll of bank-notes,--the
hesitation to converse about the garrote,--nor the bottle of acid which
would "wash away anything." Would it wash away stains of blood?</p>

<p>The sounds of subdued conversation again arrested his attention. He
listened earnestly, but without changing his position.</p>

<p>"Speak softly," said a voice which he recognized as
Glover's,--"speak softly; you will wake my guest."</p>

<p>Then the words failed to reach him for a few moments. He strained
his ears, and hardly breathed, for fear of interrupting a syllable.
Presently he was able to distinguish a few sentences.</p>

<p>"Do you call this a profitable job?" said a strange voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, very fair,--worth about fifty dollars, I should guess. I
wouldn't undertake such a piece of work at a smaller chance," said
Glover.</p>

<p>"Shall you cut the face?" said the other, after a minute's
pause.</p>

<p>"Of course," was the answer; "it's the only way to do it
handsomely."</p>

<p>"Hum!--what do you use? steel?"</p>

<p>"Steel, by all means."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't."</p>

<p>"I like it better; and I have a nice bit that has done service in
this way before."</p>

<p>From Lorrimer's brow exuded a deadly sudor. His heart ceased to
palpitate. His muscles became rigid; his eyes fixed. His terror was
almost too great for him to bear. With difficulty he controlled
himself, and listened again.</p>

<p>"Can it be done here?" asked the strange voice;--"will not the
features be recognized?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing deeply marked, except the eyes," said Glover, "and
I can easily remove them, you know."</p>

<p>"You can try the acid."</p>

<p>"The other way is best."</p>

<p>"I suppose it must be done quickly."</p>

<p>"So quickly that there will be no chance for any proof."</p>

<p>Lorrimer gasped feebly, and clutched the bedclothes with a nervous,
convulsive movement. He had no power to reflect upon his situation; but
he felt that he was lost. Alone and unaided, he could not hope to
combat the evil designs of two men, a single one of whom he knew was
vastly his superior in strength. His blood seemed to cease flowing in
his veins. He thought for an instant of springing from the bed, and
imploring mercy; but the nature of their conversation, with its
minutiae of cruelty, forbade all hope in that direction. His brain
whirled, and he thought that reason was about to forsake him. But a
movement in the room restored him to a sense of his peril.</p>

<p>He saw the shadows changing their places, and knew that the light
was moving. He heard faint footsteps. Hope deserted him, and he closed
his eyes, quite despairing. When he opened them a minute later, he was
in darkness.</p>

<p>Then hope returned. There might yet be a means of escape. They had
left him,--for how long he could not conjecture; but now, at least, he
was alone. What a flood of joy came over him then!</p>

<p>Swiftly and softly he threw off the bedclothes, and by the uncertain
light of the fire, which was still glimmering, found his way
noiselessly to the floor.</p>

<p>His trembling limbs at first refused to sustain him, but the thought
of his impending fate, should he remain, invested him with an
unexpected courage. Passing around the foot of the bed, he approached
the door of the chamber.</p>

<p>As he moved, his shadow, dimly cast by the flickering embers, fell
across the mouth of the inclosure whence Glover had brought the acid.
He shuddered to think what might be hidden by that screen. He burned
with curiosity, even in that moment of danger. For a moment he even
rashly thought of seeking to penetrate the mystery.</p>

<p>Treading lightly, and partially supporting himself by the wall, lest
his feet should press too heavily upon some loose board and cause it to
rattle beneath him, he reached the door. It was not wholly closed, and
with utmost gentleness he essayed to pull it open. With all his care he
could not prevent it from creaking sharply. His nerves were again
shaken, and a new tremor assailed him. Tears filled his eyes. His heart
was like ice, only heavier, within him.</p>

<p>He stood for a minute motionless and half-unconscious. Then
recovering himself by a powerful effort, he advanced once more. Without
venturing to open the door wider, he worked through the narrow
aperture, inch by inch, stopping every few seconds for fear that the
rustle of his shirt against the jamb might be overheard. At length, by
almost imperceptible movements, he succeeded in gaining the head of the
staircase.</p>

<p>Then he believed that his deliverance was near at hand. He had thus
far eluded detection, and it only remained for him to descend, and
depart by the outer door.</p>

<p>Bending forward at every step to catch the slightest echo of alarm,
he felt his way down through the darkness. The difficulty at this point
was great. As one recovered from a long illness finds his knees yield
under him at the first attempt to descend a staircase, just so it was
with Lorrimer. At one time a faintness came over him, and he was
obliged to sit down and rest. A movement above aroused him, and,
starting up, he hurriedly groped his way to the street-door.</p>

<p>The darkness was absolute. He could discern nothing, but, after a
short search, he caught hold of the handle and turned it slowly. The
door remained immovable. By another exploration he discovered a large
key suspended from a nail near the centre of the door. This he inserted
in the lock, and turned with all the caution he could command. It was
not enough, for it snapped loudly.</p>

<p>A voice from the head of the stairs cried out, "Who is there?"</p>

<p>Lorrimer was appalled. He shook the door, but it remained fast. Like
lightning he passed his hand up and down the crevice in search of a
hidden bolt. He found nothing, and felt that he was in the hands of the
murderers;--for he could entertain no doubt of their design. In the
agony of desperation he flung out his arms, and a door beside him flew
open. He entered, and rushed to a window, which was easily lifted, and
out of which he threw himself at the moment that a light streamed into
the apartment behind him.</p>

<p>When Mr. Lorrimer had finished relating to Captain Morrill, with all
the energy of truth, the more important of the above circumstances,
that officer arose, and, calling to his assistance a couple of his
force, started out in great haste in the direction of Chambers Street.
Lorrimer, who had been provided with shoes, hat, and coat, went with
them. After a little search, a row of houses with windows close upon
the street was found. More diligent examination showed that the door of
one of these was freshly painted. A vigorous assault upon the panels
brought down the household. Mr. Glover, and another person whose voice
was identified by Lorrimer, were marched off with few words to the
station. Mr. Lorrimer's clothes were rescued, and an officer was left
to look after the premises.</p>

<p>Mr. Glover, on arriving at the station, expressed great indignation,
and employed uncivil terms in speaking of his late guest. Under the
subduing influences of Captain Morrill's treatment, he soon became
tranquil, and subsequently manifested an excess of hilarity, which the
guardians of the night strove in vain to check. But he answered
unreservedly all the questions which Captain Morrill put to him. His
statement ran somewhat thus:--</p>

<p>"I met this young man, for the first time, a few hours ago, at an
oyster-saloon on Washington Street. We drank a good deal of ale, and he
lost his balance. I kept mine. I saw he had a pretty large amount of
money, and doubted his ability to keep as good a watch over it as he
ought to. So I took him home with me. On the way he would talk uneasily
about garrote robberies, but I refused to encourage him.</p>

<p>"You want to know about that alarming conversation? Well,"--(here
Mr. Glover was so overcome with merriment, that, after a proper time,
the interposition of official authority became necessary,)--"well, I am
an engraver. My business is mainly to cut heads. Sometimes I use steel,
sometimes copper. My brother, who is also an engraver, and I were
discussing a new commission. I told him I should make use of a good bit
of steel, which had already been engraved upon, but not so deeply but
that the lines could be easily removed, excepting the eyes, which would
have to be scraped away. My allusion to proof is easily explained: it
is common for engravers to have a proof-impression taken of their work
after it is finished, by which they are enabled to detect any
imperfections, and remedy them.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry that my young friend should have considered me so
much of a blood-thirsty ruffian. But the ale of Boston is no doubt
strange to him, and his confusion at finding himself in a large city is
quite natural. Besides, his suspicions were in some degree
reciprocated. When I saw him flying out of the window, I was convinced
that he must be an ingenious burglar, and instantly ran back to examine
my tools. I am glad to find that I was wrong. If he will return now
with me, he shall be welcome to his share of the bed."</p>

<p>Mr. Lorrimer politely, but positively, declined.</p>

<p>Captain Morrill urbanely apologized to Mr. Glover, and engaged
himself to make it right in the morning; whereupon Mr. Glover withdrew
in cachinnatory convulsions. Mr. Lorrimer was instructed to resume his
proper garments, and was then conveyed safely to his hotel, where he
remained in deep abstraction until Monday, when, after transacting his
business, he took the afternoon return-train for New York.</p>

<p>The case was not entered upon the records of the Third District
Police.</p>
